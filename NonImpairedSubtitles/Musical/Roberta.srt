1
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,500
- Did you bring my band of Indians?
- Indians?

2
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,132
Yes, American Indians,
musicians to play in my café.

3
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,972
- Oh, you mean Indians with feathers?
- Yes, with noses.

4
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,376
- Like on the American five cents?
- Yes, yes.

5
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,005
- Have you got them on board, yes?
- No.

6
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,775
Thank you, <i>monsieur.</i>

7
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,649
Indians? Indians?
Are you the Wabash Indians Band?

8
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,820
Are you Voyda?

9
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,558
I am Alexander Petrovitch
Moskovich Voyda.

10
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,531
Let's pick it up from there.

11
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,795
We're the boys you hired
to play at your café.

12
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,804
- The Wabash Indianians.
- Indianians?

13
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,738
Is this the same as Indians?

14
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,735
Well, yes, in a sense.

15
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,304
You see, we don't wear our feathers
in warm weather, do we, boys?

16
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,816
- No.
- No, never, never.

17
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,081
- Well, when do we start, Mr. Voyda?
- You don't start.

18
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,655
I cable for Indians and I want Indians!

19
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:14,759
No pale American face
is going to make me a fool of myself.

20
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,989
Did you ever heard of Alexander
Petrovitch Moskovich Voyda?

21
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,259
- Sure.
- Yes, and how, and how.

22
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,325
As a matter of fact, we hear you're one
of the cleverest fellows in Paris.

23
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,564
In Paris and all Europe.
The whole world.

24
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,368
Well, I was coming to that.
I just wanted to prepare you, that's all.

25
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,204
You got a great bet
in these boys, Mr. Voyda.

26
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,768
- They'll be a knockout in your café.
- They shall never see my café.

27
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,077
I ordered Indians, and what do I get?

28
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,655
Wait, Mr. Voyda.

29
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,790
Huck, do the organ number, quick.

30
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,225
Come on, boys, give us the organ number.
Get the gloves out.

31
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,557
- Oh, Mr. Voyda.
- What?

32
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,927
Aren't you going to
give these boys a chance?

33
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,363
No, why should I?

34
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,431
Sorry, Mr. Voyda,
but I'm afraid you've got to listen.

35
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,902
Just submit quietly
and we'll both keep out of jail.

36
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,497
Well, how did you like that, Mr. Voyda?
You see, you almost made a mistake.

37
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,001
I made a mistake? You made a mistake.

38
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,628
You are not Indians!

39
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,174
The cable mentioned a short engagement.

40
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,705
Well, it was a nice trip over.

41
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:49,009
It'll be a nicer trip going back,
stoking coals.

42
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,549
Come on, boys, the train for Paris.

43
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,062
A grand total of $13.78.

44
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,129
And a button.

45
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,268
Well, boys, at the rate we live,
that'll last us about two months.

46
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,443
Mother told me
there would be days like this.

47
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,876
Say, listen,
they dance in Paris, don't they?

48
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,938
All we have to do
is find out who pays the fiddler.

49
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,778
Does anyone know anyone in Paris?

50
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,375
That top sergeant brother of mine
gave me some addresses.

51
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,545
Quiet.

52
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:33,088
Wait! I know somebody, a little girl
who used to live next door to me.

53
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,617
Gee, I was crazy about her, too.
She's a sensation in Paris,

54
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,289
she's a star of some show or something.

55
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,934
- She'll help us.
- Well, what's her name?

56
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,269
What was her name?

57
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,237
Gee, I could find her like that
if I could only remember her name.

58
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,173
Anybody else you know
you can't remember?

59
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,609
Yeah, but I can't think who they are.

60
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:58,013
I know, it's Lizzie, Lizzie...
Elizabeth Gatz.

61
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,345
That's it. Elizabeth Gatz.

62
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,919
What a beautiful name.

63
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:05,253
Whether you find your Lizzie or not,
I've got an aunt in Paris. Aunt Minnie.

64
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,189
Can Aunt Minnie use a band?

65
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,688
Probably not. She's a dressmaker.

66
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,658
Well, I've knitted and tatted
all my life, but I've never sewed.

67
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,564
- She's very rich and famous. She might...
- Why didn't you say so before?

68
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,961
She's Roberta.

69
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,163
Roberta?

70
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,269
- This Roberta?
- Yeah.

71
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,707
They tell me in Paris if you
don't buy your gowns from Roberta,

72
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,301
you're not dressed at all.

73
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,041
I see, nude if you don't, and nude if you do.

74
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,151
Grab my bag, will you?

75
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,267
Listen, ask your aunt Minnie if she knows
where we can find Lizzie Gatz, will you?

76
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,495
- Okay. I won't be long.
- All right.

77
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,536
You fellows pick yourselves
some comfortable easy chairs.

78
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,280
Hey!

79
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,953
Hey!

80
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,904
What am I supposed to do here
besides pray? Or can't you speak English?

81
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,318
Well, the old trap won't go.

82
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,056
Oh, what's the use? Just a dumb foreigner.

83
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,750
Oh, here, here, here.

84
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,553
You mustn't do that. You might be killed.

85
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,164
Oh, you speak English.

86
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,825
Ladislaw.

87
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,175
Oh, don't go away. I want to thank you.

88
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,550
Gee, you saved my life.
I'm ever so much obliged to you.

89
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,350
Oh, it's nothing at all.

90
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh, I mean you're welcome, of course.

91
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,886
Do you know
where I can find Madam Roberta?

92
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,827
Yes. Come with me.

93
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,804
I didn't really mean that
about a dumb foreigner.

94
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,335
I forgive you.

95
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,008
Gee, that's swell.

96
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,243
You speak English beautifully.

97
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,677
Long ago I went to school in England.

98
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,906
Did you like it?

99
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,884
Oh, yes, I like the English.
And the Americans, too.

100
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,321
Gee, that's swell.

101
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,988
- I'm an American.
- Gee, that's...

102
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,324
I mean, I thought so.

103
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,926
Will you sit here, please?

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,092
Thank you.

105
00:10:56,122 --> 00:11:00,286
But Minnie, you've made a mistake
in the year. You don't look a day over...

106
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,225
- Stephanie!
- How do you do, Lord Henry?

107
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,694
My dear.

108
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,260
I saw your cousin,
Prince Peter, last week in Rome.

109
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,029
He asked after you most solicitously.

110
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,231
I hope you told him I had gone to work
and he should do the same.

111
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,866
When all you titled aristocrats get jobs,

112
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,570
maybe Europe can settle down
to a few years' peace.

113
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,942
What is it, Stephanie?

114
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,778
There's a young gentleman outside
from America, waiting to see you.

115
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,818
Young gentleman from America?

116
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,311
John.

117
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,646
John!

118
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,650
Bring him in, Stephanie. Bring him in!

119
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,089
No, wait. Don't let him come
until I've powdered my nose.

120
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,391
Give me that compact, Henry.
Quick, quick, the compact!

121
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,230
How does he look?

122
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,231
He must look all right.

123
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,470
- Send him in, Stephanie.
- Yes, <i>madame.</i>

124
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,747
- This "John from America", who is he?
- My nephew.

125
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,511
I met him when I was there a few years
ago and took a great fancy to him.

126
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,985
He's quite famous in his way.

127
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,320
"All-American halfback" or
"three quarters back" or something.

128
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,120
- Really?
- Yes, you know, it's queer,

129
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,752
but when you
happen to like your relatives,

130
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,160
you like them better than other people.

131
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,993
- And if you hate them?
- Don't be obvious, Henry.

132
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,330
He was the only one of the whole tribe

133
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,131
who was polite to me
during my entire visit.

134
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,838
I like him, Henry.

135
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,601
He's like a big, affectionate,
blundering Newfoundland dog.

136
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,601
I'd like to see him grow up.

137
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,978
- How big is he now?
- Oh, about 6'2".

138
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:37,349
John, my dear, I'm so glad to see you.

139
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,651
It's swell to see you, Aunt Minnie.

140
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,960
- Here he is, Henry, here is my...
- Newfoundland dog?

141
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,790
I was telling him about you, John.

142
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,324
This is Lord Henry Delves,
a really grand person.

143
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:55,230
And this is Stephanie, my able assistant
whom I couldn't do without.

144
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,516
Well, young man, I think your aunt
should be very much complimented.

145
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,485
When I was in Paris at your age,

146
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,046
I didn't spend my time visiting my aunts.

147
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,992
Maybe you didn't
have any aunts like Aunt Minnie.

148
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,493
Very prettily said, John.

149
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,962
There aren't any like your aunt Minnie.

150
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,659
Well, goodbye, young man,
I'm off to catch a train,

151
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,565
but in a fortnight I'll be back.

152
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,502
And then, as I understand is the custom
in your country,

153
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,234
we'll go places and do something.

154
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,811
Goodbye, Minnie,
miss me just a little, won't you?

155
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,880
A very great deal, my dear.

156
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,548
Nice old duck, isn't he?

157
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,491
Oh, he isn't so terribly old.

158
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,656
Oh, I didn't mean in years, Aunt Minnie.
I meant I like him.

159
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,857
Do you?

160
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,392
Then you're a good judge of men.

161
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,099
Now, tell me about this young lady
you wrote me about. What was her name?

162
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,231
Sophie. She's given me the air.

163
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,399
What?

164
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,737
We had a row.

165
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,604
Oh, I thought she'd given you an heir.

166
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,610
She must be very stupid.

167
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,911
Oh, no, she's brilliant, really.

168
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,454
She speaks German and French
and everything.

169
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,245
Here's her picture.

170
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,552
It isn't very good of her, though.

171
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,086
She has her points.

172
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,456
I take it you're smarting
over this air she has given you.

173
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,131
Well, I'm still in love with her.

174
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,800
But she says I'm just a hick.

175
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,635
- A what?
- A farmer.

176
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,803
I've got hay in my hair.

177
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,042
I can't talk on any subject,

178
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,103
- I can't dance, I can't even dress myself.
- Ridiculous.

179
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,205
And I don't know anything
about women's clothes,

180
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,719
and when I have to order dinner
it's always meat, potatoes and pie.

181
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:51,278
Oh, she says that, does she?
Well, we'll show her she's wrong.

182
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,824
Gosh, John's been in there a long while.

183
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,224
Oh, why didn't we go to a hotel first?

184
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,660
Man, I'm hungry.

185
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,289
Come on, Mac, give him the call.

186
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,273
That's my gang.

187
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,944
- I came over with a band.
- A band of what?

188
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,608
An orchestra.
They're the Wabash Indianians,

189
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,652
hired for a job in Paris
and fired through a misunderstanding.

190
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,211
Now they're looking for an engagement.
They're a swell bunch.

191
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,294
They do that rather prettily.

192
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,795
<i>Madame,</i> Scharwenka wants to see you.

193
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,994
She doesn't like her tissue.
She doesn't like the model,

194
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,366
she doesn't like the fit,
and she doesn't like the price.

195
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,736
Oh, you mean she doesn't like it.

196
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,002
Yes, <i>madame,</i> what will you do about it?

197
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,701
Do about it? Let her go.

198
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:46,869
She'll come back.

199
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,107
She's the rage here right now,
and she's got the best figure in Europe,

200
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,810
but she has to have it dressed,
at least partly.

201
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,876
I'm afraid
she intends to start her screaming.

202
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,545
If she does, stick a pin in her.

203
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,680
Oh, I'd rather use an ice-pick.

204
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,985
This time I left the door open.

205
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,138
Who is she going to stick a pin into?

206
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:19,166
Scharwenka, a Polish countess who has
spurned the hollow mockeries of society

207
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,735
and gone in for nightclub entertaining.

208
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,310
You can see she's talented.

209
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,353
Do you allow her to make such a noise?

210
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,756
- lf she enjoys it, why not?
- Well, suppose the police come in?

211
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,825
Good, they can take her away.

212
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,819
But she must be insane
to make such a row.

213
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,090
Stephanie may not be safe with her.

214
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,165
- You feel inclined to stop her?
- Yes, I do.

215
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,096
No, no, no, no, no!

216
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,762
You are not the only couturier in Paris!

217
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,500
I am a good advertising
for the house that dresses me!

218
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,702
I do not know why
I come to Roberta anyway!

219
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,870
You... Will you quit pushing me?

220
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,577
I... I beg your pardon.

221
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,023
You can't behave like that, you know.

222
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:14,229
You big beautiful American!

223
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,365
You are very strong.

224
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,568
You do not understand.
These Latin races must be shouted at.

225
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,774
I'm not a Latin
and shouting doesn't impress me.

226
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,846
Hey.

227
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,057
I shall never set foot in this place again.

228
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,990
You do not know
how they have treated me.

229
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,996
This horrible old woman here.
The greedy old <i>diable.</i>

230
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,622
Easy, she's my aunt.

231
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,900
Oh, well, I was not blaming it on her.

232
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,998
She is really a genius,

233
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,407
but that little shrew who
runs the business. That Stephanie...

234
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,172
But Stephanie is swell.

235
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,439
What, you are her lover?

236
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,276
I've never seen such a place.

237
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,444
No one thinks of anything
but being somebody's lover.

238
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,852
Well, have you never thought of it?

239
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,923
What happened?

240
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,857
Your nephew has done
most admirably, <i>madame.</i>

241
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,800
What did he do? Where is Scharwenka?

242
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,132
On his neck.

243
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,932
Oh, I see.

244
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,701
Does he like it?

245
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,208
Not particularly.

246
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,978
But I don't hear him shouting for help.

247
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,475
There's that cuckoo band again.

248
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,354
Scharwenka!

249
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,617
Do you think she'd do something
for my nephew if he asked her?

250
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,786
I don't think he'll even have to ask her.

251
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,296
No, no, no.
I mean something for this band of his.

252
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,626
She could get them an engagement

253
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,827
and if they're John's friends,
they're a swell band.

254
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,529
I must show you Paris,

255
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,896
and I want you to love it.

256
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,972
- I've seen the Eiffel Tower.
- Oh, no.

257
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:09,003
My dear Countess. I understand there are
a few things wrong with the gown.

258
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,912
You shall have a new model,
at a new price.

259
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:15,419
Oh, there's nothing wrong with the gown.
I'll be back tomorrow for another fit.

260
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,987
May I present my nephew, John?

261
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,092
Oh, he presented himself
most charmingly.

262
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,192
My nephew is paying me a visit
en route to London,

263
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:30,429
he has a band which is playing at a private
party for the Duke of Wattingham.

264
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,699
I should like to hear
your orchestra sometime.

265
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,364
Now. There's no time like now.

266
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,806
Now, hang on to your hat.

267
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,544
Hey, fellows!

268
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,553
Strike it up. It's a job.

269
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,221
Come on, boys, let's give them
the <i>Let's Begin</i> number.

270
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,389
- Come on, get over here.
- Come on, man, get over there.

271
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,314
All right, boys, let's swing it.

272
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,163
<i>Now that you've got me going</i>
<i>what you gonna do?</i>

273
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,162
<i>Is it up to me or is it up to you?</i>

274
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,300
<i>What kind a game is this we've begun?</i>

275
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,233
<i>Was it done just for fun?</i>

276
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,373
<i>Don't forget since we've met</i>

277
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,638
<i>There's no reason for vain regret. Oh</i>

278
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:54,117
<i>Is this to be a case of "fall</i>
<i>and glad I fell, kiss and never tell</i>

279
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,777
<i>"Folly and farewell?"</i>

280
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,481
<i>Which is going to be "might have been</i>

281
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,048
<i>"Lose or win? Let's begin"</i>

282
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,153
<i>I'm here to tell you, let's begin</i>

283
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,196
<i>Now that you've got me going</i>
<i>what you gonna do?</i>

284
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,243
<i>Is it up to me, or is it up to you?</i>

285
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,106
<i>What kind of game is this we've begun</i>

286
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,946
<i>Was it done just for fun?</i>

287
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,143
<i>- No</i>
<i>- Realize that I'm wise</i>

288
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,585
<i>And please stop rolling</i>
<i>those big blue eyes</i>

289
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,318
<i>Is this to be a case of "Fall and glad I fell</i>

290
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,755
<i>"Kiss and never tell, folly and farewell?"</i>

291
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:41,056
<i>Which is going to be</i>
<i>"might have been"let's begin</i>

292
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,131
<i>Let's begin</i>

293
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,815
- I think I saw...
- Huck, it looks like you're all set.

294
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,082
- You remember the girl I told you about?
- She likes the band.

295
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,090
Well, I was out there dancing.
I looked up and I saw...

296
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,182
Quiet, quiet, quiet!

297
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,251
- You're going in to meet a Polish countess.
- I don't want to meet any countess.

298
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,695
- But she can give the band a job.
- I don't care what she can...

299
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,699
- Who, who can? She can?
- Yeah!

300
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,201
- Well, that's different.
- No cracks, now.

301
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,738
I think they're very good.

302
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,598
Aunt Minnie,
this is my friend Huck Haines.

303
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,768
My nephew has told me about you.

304
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,677
Countess, may I present
<i>Monsieur</i> Huck Haines?

305
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,845
Countess?

306
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:47,558
- Well, if it isn't...
- Huck is for Huckleberry, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

307
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,354
Yes,

308
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,130
and a couple of <i>n'est-ce pas.</i>

309
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,061
Mr. Haines is the piccolo player
I was telling you about.

310
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:01,572
Ah! Piccolo player. How <i>charmant.</i>

311
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,602
No, no, no, <i>madame. Pas de piccolo.</i>

312
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,571
I play what you call a filthy piano.

313
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,744
May I present myself,
Le Marquis de Indiana.

314
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,316
Ah, Indiana,

315
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,249
a province in the south of Greece, eh?

316
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,325
No, no, no, <i>Madame la Comtesse.</i>

317
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,557
Just west of Pittsburgh, babe.

318
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,118
Hey, ix-nay acking-cray.

319
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,666
These Americans are
what you call fresh guys.

320
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,804
No, no, no. Refreshing.

321
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:37,640
<i>Oh, mais oui.</i> Refreshing.
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>

322
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,175
It is nothing, toots.

323
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,449
I should like to talk to this refreshing,

324
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,511
filthy piano, alone.

325
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,817
Oh, certainly, certainly.

326
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:56,992
Is he a lunatic?

327
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,359
Oh, no, that's merely his way
of making her feel at home.

328
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,625
Oh!

329
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,529
Now, listen here, Huck Haines...

330
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,671
No, no, no, no. What a charming surprise.

331
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,641
This little <i>tete-a-tete</i> with you, alone.

332
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:13,971
Huck, please.

333
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,873
What's the racket, Liz?
Did you marry the title or just lift it?

334
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,315
Be a pal, will you, Huck?
It's just a stage name.

335
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,649
You've got to have a title
to croon over here.

336
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,656
I know. Gee, Lizzie, you look grand.

337
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,692
Look, I promise to get you a job
if you won't tell on me.

338
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,388
- Okay, Liz.
- And it's not Liz.

339
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,796
I'm sorry, Princess? Baroness?
Oh, what is it?

340
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,730
You may call me Tanka.

341
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,833
- Tanka.
- You're welcome.

342
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,668
It's swell seeing you again, Tanka.

343
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,341
But what about that job for the boys?

344
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,712
<i>Madame</i> Roberta is having tea
in her sitting room,

345
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,545
and she would like you to join her,
if you'd care to.

346
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,244
Oh, I am so sorry.

347
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,255
But you will tell <i>Madame</i> Roberta
that I have an engagement

348
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,985
with the Marquis de Indiana?

349
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,857
Yes, Countess.

350
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,564
Well, now, I guess
I've got you to add to my worries.

351
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,070
It's time for your nap.

352
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:19,405
Stephanie, my child,
I'm adding to your many duties.

353
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,502
We're going to make John over.

354
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,438
I think he's very nice as he is.

355
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,848
A good tailor never hurt a man,
no matter how nice he is.

356
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,027
That's Ladislaw.

357
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,260
The doctor makes me
take a nap every afternoon

358
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,627
and Stephanie thinks
that music helps me go to sleep.

359
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,436
Ladislaw is our doorman and a prince.

360
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,473
A prince, your doorman?

361
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,937
A Russian prince.

362
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,976
If there were such a thing as a restoration,

363
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,780
Ladislaw would be in line for the throne.

364
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,091
Ladislaw, I hope
you're in good finger today.

365
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,302
- This is my nephew, Mr. Kent.
- Glad to know you.

366
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,796
Are you comfortable?

367
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,904
I want a drink of water.

368
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:31,407
Don't stand there, Ladislaw.
Play something. Play something.

369
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,900
You'll wake her.

370
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,738
You're darn right, you will.

371
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,317
<i>I'll be hard to handle</i>

372
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,081
<i>I promise you that</i>

373
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:58,792
<i>and if you complain here's</i>
<i>one little Jane that will leave you flat</i>

374
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:04,327
<i>I'll be hard to handle</i>
<i>What else can I be?</i>

375
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:09,830
<i>Just ask my dad</i>
<i>the trouble he had controlling me</i>

376
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,006
<i>I have faults, to be specific</i>

377
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,774
<i>In a temper, oh I'm terrific</i>

378
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:20,112
<i>I throw chairs and tables and I never miss</i>

379
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:25,013
<i>Oh, I'm as cold as any shellfish</i>

380
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,853
<i>I tell lies, I'm mean, I'm selfish</i>

381
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,151
<i>Think it over, my warning is this</i>

382
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:37,664
<i>I'll be hard to handle, I'm making it plain</i>

383
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:43,135
<i>now just be a dear and scram out of here</i>
<i>cause I'm gonna raise Cain</i>

384
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,453
<i>I'm as cold as any shellfish</i>
<i>I tell lies, I'm mean, I'm selfish</i>

385
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,157
<i>Think it over my warning is</i>

386
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:07,289
<i>If you want me sweet and hot</i>
<i>Oh, I'll be hard to handle</i>

387
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,830
<i>I'm making it plain</i>

388
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,501
<i>Now just be a dear and scram out of here</i>

389
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,502
Nice work, Countess, nice work.

390
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,804
Oh, well.

391
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,516
That was pretty good, boys

392
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,917
but listen, Candy, give me a better pick-up
after that second break, will you?

393
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,579
Okay. Okay, boss.

394
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:41,494
You know, this reminds me of the old days
when we used to give shows in your barn.

395
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,899
Yeah, we used to fight over
who handled the gate receipts.

396
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,098
You remember the valentine I sent you?

397
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,039
The one with the arrow piercing the heart
and dripping blood?

398
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:55,136
Oh, yes, I remember that. I think that's
the only valentine I ever received.

399
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,703
It's the only one I ever sent.

400
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,715
Those were the happy days, weren't they?

401
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,876
Do you know, I think I was
in love with you then, Huck.

402
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,284
- I know you were.
- You.

403
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,851
Me. And what's more,
I was madly in love with you.

404
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,556
- Oh, we were funny kids, weren't we?
- Oh, I suppose so.

405
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,428
Remember that beauty contest I won?

406
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,263
- Oh, you got a trip to Kansas City.
- Yeah, well you won it for me.

407
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,337
How did you get all those men
from the overall factory to vote for me?

408
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,705
That was easy.
I showed them a picture of Lillian Russell.

409
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,370
Lillian Russell?
What was the matter with my picture?

410
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,605
Well, if you must know,

411
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,477
we got a lot of votes from the farmers
with a picture of a prize heifer.

412
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,049
Oh, you.

413
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,507
He is coming now.

414
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,607
Listen, Huck, give it to him
and make it sweet and hot.

415
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,112
Come on, boys, the big boss is coming.
Let's jam it.

416
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,491
What's that?

417
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,192
You want an orchestra.
I have got one for you.

418
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,327
You are tearing your hair
to get good music, I bring it to you.

419
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,870
I take them away
from the Duke of Wattingham,

420
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,303
just to give it to you.

421
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,932
You give it to me?

422
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,776
How much does it cost?

423
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,109
What does it matter? Listen to them.

424
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,446
They are good.

425
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,486
They are very good.

426
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,023
They are hired.

427
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,794
I am glad
I didn't take those white-faced Indians.

428
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,728
I think maybe sometimes I am wrong.

429
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,298
But this orchestra

430
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,192
is superb.

431
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,861
And who did it for you?

432
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,666
Little Tanka.

433
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,853
The palefaces!

434
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,151
Who did it?

435
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,088
Little Tanka do it for me.

436
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,831
It's a frame-down.

437
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,766
That's what it is, a frame-down!

438
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,093
- Well, up or down, do we stick?
- Stick?

439
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,833
You're right,
you stick a knife upon my back.

440
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,104
- Voyda, what is wrong with them?
- What is wrong for them?

441
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,236
I cable for Wabash Indians

442
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:33,374
and what do I get? Indianians!

443
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,615
Get out! No job!

444
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,247
- I do not get it.
- Neither did we.

445
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:41,052
Very well, let them go!
Then I go with them!

446
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,453
Oh, yes? Where you going to?

447
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:48,290
Now, what was the name of that club
that made you the offer yesterday?

448
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,697
Oh, oh, the Club Antoine.
Oh, I could go there today.

449
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,931
They offered me a six-month contract
and I could take the band with me.

450
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,471
You go, you go.

451
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,699
You are not bluffing with Voyda.

452
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,605
Indians.

453
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,836
Now, listen, Mr. Voyda.

454
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,038
I think you're making a big mistake
by letting the Countess

455
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,139
go to the Café Arman. I mean Antoine.

456
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:09,041
I think you ought to try
and make her stay here, if possible.

457
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,987
After all, Mr. Voyda,
your money is just as good as no money.

458
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,886
I mean, anybody's money.

459
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,488
That Café Antoine.

460
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,322
I hold you to your contract with me.

461
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,456
I have your cable accepting it.

462
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:27,299
As for you, I can pay you as much money
as Antoine can pay you.

463
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,768
Everything is fixed!

464
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,807
I go and telephone my lawyer!

465
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,743
Boys, we're working.

466
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,643
Hurray!

467
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,237
<i>Vive la France!</i>

468
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,079
<i>Vive la</i> Russia, you mean.

469
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,324
Hello, Stephanie.

470
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,859
Stephanie, how's the Newfoundland pup?

471
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,331
- The all-American nephew?
- You won't recognize him.

472
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,368
Since you've been gone, Stephanie
has made a man of the world of him.

473
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,869
He's positively arresting.

474
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,163
You ought to see him, Lord Henry.

475
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,368
Your tailor has surpassed himself.
He looks wonderful.

476
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,139
But then I think
he has the knack of wearing clothes.

477
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,147
Not every man has, you know.

478
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,009
And he has a positive flair for languages.

479
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,980
The way he's taken hold of French
is amazing.

480
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,888
You should have heard him
tell a taxi driver where to go last night.

481
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,493
And Stephanie and I
have given him a few pointers

482
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,292
it would take most men
a lifetime to acquire.

483
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,823
What a start for a young fellow.

484
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,899
<i>Au revoir,</i> my dear.

485
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,971
You never looked lovelier in your life
than you do this minute.

486
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,336
Until tomorrow.

487
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:39,035
It's always nice to know
I shall see you tomorrow, Henry.

488
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,668
You've been saying
very pleasant things to me, lately, Minnie.

489
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,840
- Not really ill, I hope?
- No.

490
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,244
- Stephanie.
- Lord Henry.

491
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,547
- Where is John?
- Taking his French lesson.

492
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,378
Haven't you heard them?

493
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,878
No.

494
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,117
<i>La</i> winner!

495
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,173
Come on, boys, come in.

496
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,943
- So long, prof.
- So long, prof.

497
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,853
Can I get you something?

498
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,193
No, thank you.

499
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,664
Not even a drink of water?

500
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,661
No.

501
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,567
Sing, please.

502
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,586

- Sophie, Sophie.
- What's the matter?

530
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,201
Here's an article about John.

531
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,471
He's turned dressmaker.

532
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:43,779
Can you bear it?

533
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,949
lmagine John Kent in a smart dress shop?

534
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,616
He wouldn't know a smart dress
from last year's awning.

535
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,818
Well, the first place I'll make a beeline for
in Paris is going to be Roberta's.

536
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,633
It's all right, Fernande.

537
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,668
I was just saying goodbye to
a room in which I've been very happy.

538
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,841
But you are not
leaving Roberta's, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

539
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,049
Goodbye, Fernande.

540
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,519
<i>Bonjour, Monsieur</i> Fullback.

541
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,789
I wish to place an order.

542
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,558
Would you mind hemstitching
two dozen touchdowns for me?

543
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:09,724
Oh, lay off.

544
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,462
Would run up for me two field goals
and a bias,

545
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,434
with the score tied in the back?

546
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,062
Kind of a halfback.

547
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:20,908
I don't get sore often, but I will in a minute
if you two don't shut up.

548
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:25,074
Do you plan
fitting the ladies yourself, John?

549
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,781
What a picture. Tape measure around
the neck and pin-cushion on the hip.

550
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,080
I ought to spank the two of you.

551
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,054
Now, don't lose
your sense of humor, Johnny.

552
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,818
Why don't you let a guy alone
when he's trying to figure things out?

553
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,790
She just wants to know
what you're going to do.

554
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,794
- That's all.
- I'm going home.

555
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:42,463
- But you can't. You're Mr. Roberta.
- I'm not. Stephanie is.

556
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,899
I mean, well, Aunt Minnie left no will,
so her property comes to me.

557
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,836
But she always said
the shop was to be Stephanie's.

558
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,736
- Stephanie's going...
- Yes.

559
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,313
We are astonished.

560
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,948
Well, I'm not astonished.

561
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,541
You mean you're going to give
the whole shop to Stephanie?

562
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,849
Yes, right away. That's what Aunt Minnie
wanted and that's what I want.

563
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,719
You're giving it to her without any...

564
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,952
strings?

565
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,790
What do you mean, "strings"?

566
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,796
Oh, she just means

567
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,759
strings.

568
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,734
Well, you make yourselves comfortable.
I've got to find Stephanie.

569
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,507
I was looking for you.

570
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,778
- Well, hello.
- No, no, no.

571
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,719
Can you tell me why no will can be found?

572
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,812
- Well, because there isn't any.
- Why haven't you been able to find it?

573
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,620
- It must have been destroyed.
- So you admit it?

574
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,020
Admit what?

575
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:47,359
For years Stephanie has worked
to build this business.

576
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,625
It was hers as much as Roberta's.

577
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,028
<i>Madame</i> could not destroy that will.

578
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,328
- Are you trying to say I did?
- I will not say yes or not.

579
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:58,203
But it looks queer, very queer.

580
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,535
You... Why, you Russian prince!

581
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,179
I'm still boss of this outfit,
and you're fired!

582
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:06,148
No, no, I am not fired. I am perfectly cool.

583
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,911
I mean you're dismissed.

584
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,744
You think you can get rid of me so easy!

585
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:13,220
- Get out!
- You think no one will protect Stephanie.

586
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:16,053
- Stephanie doesn't need your protection.
- While Stephanie stays here

587
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,150
and remains here, I will protect her.

588
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,932
Aren't you ashamed to be quarreling
like two silly little boys?

589
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,393
Please go, Lad, I'll meet you downstairs.

590
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,705
The Russian nobility burns me up anyway.

591
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,076
They're always sticking their noses
in other people's business.

592
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,114
- You don't like the Russian nobility?
- No.

593
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,683
I don't like his hanging around you.

594
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,446
I was going to give you the shop anyway.

595
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:46,181
Oh, you are very magnanimous,
giving me something I don't want.

596
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,085
- You don't want it?
- No.

597
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,082
And who are you to give me gifts?

598
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:53,287
- Wait a minute, you mustn't act like this.
- I'll act the way I choose.

599
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,194
It's your shop, you run it.

600
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,391
Goodbye.

601
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,457
Hey, wait a minute, Stephanie.

602
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:01,126
I'm sorry, but I can't be a dressmaker.

603
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,604
I couldn't half carry on the business.

604
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,702
- Maybe you could carry it on half.
- How do you mean?

605
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,611
Well, I mean

606
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,482
- maybe we could be partners.
- No, no.

607
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,246
You like it, you take it, Stephanie.

608
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,913
I've got a football team to coach.

609
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,288
No, I wouldn't accept anything
except in partnership.

610
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,950
Not on your life. That's out.

611
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,155
- All right, then I'm out.
- Oh, wait a minute.

612
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,825
<i>Pardon, mademoiselle,</i>
may I finish this now?

613
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,299
Oh, yes, yes.

614
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,070
Oh, wait a minute.

615
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,466
May she?

616
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:41,404
I mean, yes. Certainly, my good woman.

617
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,241
You'll make a very nice partner.

618
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:51,515
It isn't generally known that <i>Madame</i>
has been letting me do all the designing.

619
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,488
So we'll have to startle them
with daring styles.

620
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,357
- Partners.
- Partners.

621
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,858
Oh, John, look. We've had a brainstorm.

622
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:05,662
Instead of you going home, why don't
you and Stephanie become partners?

623
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,637
Huck, you're brilliant.

624
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,640
What do you say, Stephanie?

625
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,848
No, not on your life. That's out.

626
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,517
You'll make a very nice partner.

627
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:25,782
It isn't generally known that <i>Madame</i>
has been letting me do the designing.

628
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,524
We'll have to startle them
with daring styles.

629
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,493
- Partners.
- Partners.

630
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,666
Countess, you shall be our first customer.

631
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:47,804
Yvonne.

632
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,507
This we call <i>le Petit Trianon.</i>

633
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,081
If you don't like any of these,
say so, won't you?

634
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,016
Gee, I think they're swell.

635
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,557
And this is <i>le train bleu.</i>

636
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:08,262
Oh, that one's a honey.
That's the one I'd take.

637
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,835
Do your ecstasies
refer to the gown or the girl?

638
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,600
Oh, I hadn't noticed the girl,
but now that you mention her,

639
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,174
- I'd take...
- Yes?

640
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,676
The gown. Less upkeep.

641
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,183
This is called <i>la sirene noire.</i>

642
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,454
Does not she look wonderful in that?

643
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,527
Marvelous.

644
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,690
Just like a peeled eel.

645
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:49,264
I don't like that one.

646
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,266
Liane...

647
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,936
Albert.

648
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,810
Maybe we could do something about it.

649
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,908
Albert, do you suppose
we could raise this back a little?

650
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,613
If you don't mind, I'd like that dress out.

651
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,389
- As bad as that, huh?
- Worse.

652
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,255
All right, then it's out.

653
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,052
Take it away, Albert.

654
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,558
This is <i>le ciel gris.</i>

655
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,342
That is the one I will take.

656
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,680
And tall, handsome gentlemen
with large bank accounts

657
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:42,314
will be asking for my telephone number.

658
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,526
And getting it.

659
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,655
And won't they be surprised
when I answer?

660
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,434
Well, so long.
Tell the Countess I'll be waiting for her.

661
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,632
Where?

662
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,934
Oh, either on the right side
of the Left Bank,

663
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,705
or the left side of the right bank.

664
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,047
- I think you're swell not to be angry.
- Angry?

665
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,683
I hope we're good enough friends
for you to express an opinion.

666
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:14,223
And I hope we're good enough friends
for you to dine with me tonight.

667
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,349
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Tomorrow night.

668
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,357
I'm very sorry.

669
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,324
I'll tell you, the night
Huck opens at the Café Russe.

670
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,226
All right.

671
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,362
Gee, that'll be swell.

672
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,170
Yes.

673
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,874
I've always been interested
in newspaper work.

674
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,347
Have you anything more to say?

675
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,850
I think he's said enough.

676
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,317
I haven't any more paper.

677
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,911
Oh, we have reams and reams of it here.

678
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,248
Oh, thanks.

679
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,685
A football player
owning a dress shop is news, isn't it?

680
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,852
Good news.

681
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:54,193
Well, that's what I say,
almost too good to be true,

682
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,788
and that's why
we want you to have it first.

683
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:59,596
So that you can write it in your own sweet
charming way that you've made famous,

684
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:00,931
Miss...

685
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:06,102
We want you to introduce it
in your own inimitable style, Miss...

686
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,838
- Jones.
- Jones.

687
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,371
Jones.

688
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,279
But I'm still sore about all those
silly jokes they're printing about me.

689
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:13,849
Yes, but they print it.

690
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,045
Every time they make a joke,
a million francs pour in.

691
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,617
It's a pretty expensive joke
on somebody else, I think.

692
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:24,218
- Now, when Mr. Kent designs clothes...
- When I what?

693
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,524
Does Mr. Kent design clothes, too?

694
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,254
- No.
- Oh, modesty, modesty.

695
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:34,563
Mr. Kent's idea is to introduce
the football motif into dress designing.

696
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:38,630
The outdoor flavor will make
the evening clothes look healthier.

697
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,109
Oh, wait till you see our
end-around-end evening creation.

698
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,213
You know, the one
with the dash-off center.

699
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,112
Has Mr. Kent any more ideas?

700
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,150
- No.
- Oh, yes, thousands and thousands.

701
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:51,550
As a matter of fact, Mr. Kent's
main idea is to design women's dresses

702
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,088
the way men think they should be.

703
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:54,885
And how do you men
think they should be?

704
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,050
Not so naked.

705
00:54:56,126 --> 00:55:00,392
Well, well, he means that
if clothes are to clothe, they should clothe.

706
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,589
It's more stimulating
to the imagination, if clothes clothe.

707
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,897
That's very unique.

708
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,062
Yes.

709
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:12,302
And pockets in all dresses,
especially in the evening ones,

710
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,406
so the women can pack their own junk.

711
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,809
The bulging pockets of the male
will disappear forever.

712
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,245
Women will not have to
depend upon their male escorts.

713
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,681
They'll be much more independent.

714
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,309
As a matter of fact... As a matter of fact,

715
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,555
pockets will make
the female more female.

716
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,783
Very nice.

717
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,383
And gloves attached to the dress,

718
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,620
so they won't get lost.

719
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,494
They'll be worn on a jeweled...
Around the neck.

720
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:36,691
Brilliant!

721
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,799
Well, I really must be going now.

722
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,609
- Oh, that's too bad.
- That's fine.

723
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,883
- Have you had enough?
- Yes, I think I have quite enough.

724
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,884
- Now tell me, what paper will this be in?
- Paper?

725
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,215
Why, I'm Miss Jones. I'm syndicated.

726
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:02,018
When you talk to me,
you're telling the world.

727
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,161
How was I, toots?

728
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,761
Pardon, <i>monsieur,</i> a lady to see you.

729
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,301
- Another newspaper woman?
- An American, I think.

730
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,667
A Miss Teale.

731
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,072
Sophie! Send her in, please.

732
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,069
Huck, she's here.

733
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:22,700
That's great, and just when
you were getting along so swell.

734
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:24,912
You don't appreciate her.

735
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,209
I know she seems
a little hard and sophisticated.

736
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,182
But underneath she's a pearl.

737
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,810
And a pearl, so I am told,

738
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,185
is the result
of a chronic irritation on an oyster.

739
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:35,156
What do you know
about anything, anyway?

740
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,592
- I know about everything, every way.
- Then you must know Sophie's swell.

741
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:42,597
John, every day you act worse,
but today you're acting like tomorrow.

742
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,402
- Hello, John.
- Sophie!

743
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,734
You're awfully hard to see
since you became a couturier.

744
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,864
Not for you, Sophie.
When did you arrive in Paris?

745
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,033
This morning.

746
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,599
How long are you going to stay?

747
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:56,406
Oh, hello, Huckleberry.

748
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:57,773
Hello, Soph.

749
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,106
Mother and I
are going to Switzerland on Saturday.

750
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,411
Goodbye, John. I'll see you Sunday.

751
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,413
Don't mind him, he's only clowning.

752
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:08,718
Thank you, dear.

753
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:12,455
Well, so you're here now.

754
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:13,620
Yes.

755
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,893
- Aren't you pleased to see me?
- Sophie, I've tried to forget you.

756
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,758
And have you, John?

757
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,772
I thought I had,

758
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,069
but now I know I haven't.

759
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,746
Gee, you're swell.

760
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:35,043
John, you have a line
that just sweeps a girl right off her feet.

761
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,642
Yeah, sure.

762
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,117
When are you going to show me Paris?

763
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:42,055
You'd be bored seeing Paris
with a small-town hick like me,

764
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,252
who only knows how to order
meat and potatoes and pie.

765
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,989
Oh, please forget I ever said those things.

766
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,825
I only said them
because you were going away.

767
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,428
I didn't want you to go.

768
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:56,237
- I loved you so much.
- It was a funny way to love me.

769
00:57:56,306 --> 00:58:00,504
But, John, darling,
don't you ever say things you don't mean?

770
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,668
No.

771
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:12,350
Well, maybe I do.
Don't cry, Sophie, I don't like it.

772
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:18,450
I can't help it. I'm so unhappy.

773
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,958
I came all the way to Paris just to see you.

774
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:28,202
- Only to find you don't love me anymore.
- But I do, Sophie, honest I do.

775
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,038
Oh, John.

776
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:40,514
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, come in, Stephanie.

777
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:45,015
May I present Miss Sophie Teale?

778
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,188
My partner Stephanie.

779
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,381
How do you do?

780
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,556
When I come in for a new gown,
may I ask for you?

781
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,493
Oh, that'll be swell.

782
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,566
Well, I'll run along.
I know how busy you are.

783
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:01,159
- No, I'll see you to the door.
- No. No. Business before pleasure.

784
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:04,400
But I'll save Wednesday for you.
Lunch and dinner and the evening.

785
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,566
That's fine. It's a date.

786
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,470
Goodbye, miss.

787
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:27,227
- Stephanie, I want to...
- Why, when you have time,

788
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:31,699
- I wish you'd look over these materials.
- But I want to tell you about Sophie.

789
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:35,996
- She's very lovely.
- Yes, that is... I mean she...

790
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,372
Holy smokes,
haven't we a date for next Wednesday?

791
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:44,607
Oh, have we? I'm sure we haven't.

792
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:03,029
This we call <i>le lys doré.</i>

793
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:12,272
If I weren't going out with Johnny,
I wouldn't be so particular.

794
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:16,072
But I'm sure he'll want me to have
something that expresses my personality.

795
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,376
Suppose we have Johnny come in
and help you select something.

796
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,179
He knows so much more
about your personality than I do.

797
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,719
Oh, no. No, please. I want to surprise him.

798
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,848
You know, he's really just a little boy
in spite of his man-of-the-world exterior.

799
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:32,691
Yes, I suspected that.
I'll see what else I can get for you.

800
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,735
- Oh, hello, Huck.
- Hello.

801
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,272
If you're looking for Johnny,
he's in conference with his lawyer.

802
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:45,898
Well, then,
maybe you'll have lunch with me.

803
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,533
- Are you busy?
- Very.

804
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:51,273
I'm trying to find something to suit
the personality of Miss Sophie Teale.

805
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,939
Then you are busy.

806
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,276
Liane.

807
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,876
Excuse me, won't you?

808
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,081
Liane, that dress was discarded.
Why do you have it on?

809
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,317
Albert wanted to make a new top for it.

810
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,791
Oh, all right. Fine.

811
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:10,431
- Is Miss Teale's personality in there?
- Yes, right in there.

812
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,958
I'll go and torment her a while.

813
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:22,076
Is that beautiful.
And just made for you, Soph.

814
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:25,012
- Oh, hello. Do you really think it suits me?
- Oh, certainly.

815
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:28,345
A little longer sleeves,
it would make an ideal straitjacket.

816
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:29,611
Some day, by sheer accident,

817
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,244
you're going to say
something funny, Huck.

818
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,754
Oh, Soph, now don't be like that.

819
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,984
Do you mind if I sit here
and help you pick out a gown?

820
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:39,357
No, I'm trying to find something
that John will like on me.

821
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,123
Something startling.

822
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,859
John loves to be startled by girls' dresses.

823
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,701
Here is a gown
that might please you, Miss Teale.

824
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:04,343
This gown has both chic
and good breeding.

825
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,888
I'm more interested in its chic.
I can supply the breeding myself.

826
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:17,389
I know the dress.
Look, Stephanie, you know that one that...

827
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,659
It sort of begins and then in the...

828
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,135
You know, the black one.

829
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,232
- The black one?
- Yes, the one you put aside.

830
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,566
Oh, no. No, I can't.

831
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,543
Oh, yes, you can, Stephanie.
Show it to Miss Teale.

832
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,705
- I know she'd like it.
- Oh, no, Mr. Kent wouldn't...

833
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:36,012
I'm quite sure Mr. Kent would want
me to see any model you have.

834
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,645
Please have it shown
as quickly as possible.

835
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:42,054
That's it, Stephanie, please have it shown
as quickly as possible.

836
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,752
Just because it's been set aside
for a marquise,

837
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,489
doesn't mean that it can't be shown.

838
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:53,929
Very well. Anna, have Liane model
<i>la sirene noire</i> at once, please.

839
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:59,339
Oh, thank you, Huck.
Now we're getting someplace.

840
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,271
- She'll probably like that dress.
- She's going to like it.

841
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:07,940
When John sees her in it, oh boy,

842
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,075
he's gonna make her walk home,
ocean and all.

843
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:13,519
- No, he won't. He's in love with her.
- He only thinks he is.

844
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,622
If he were, would you mind?

845
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:25,629
I am minding, Huck. Terribly.

846
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,603
Can't you hurry that model?

847
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,308
Yes. Yes, Miss Teale.

848
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:47,088
Well, now that's the smartest thing
you've shown me. I like it.

849
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,387
It's been discarded.
It wasn't put aside for anyone.

850
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,428
- Huck was mistaken about that.
- Oh, I see.

851
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:56,321
Well, I think I'll have it just the same.

852
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:58,798
What shall I do?

853
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,132
You're doing fine.

854
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,133
- How much is it?
- It's only 1,000 francs.

855
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,003
It's hardly worthy of you.

856
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:11,838
I'm afraid she's right, Sophie.
You know it may not be so becoming.

857
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:15,080
You're not a very good saleslady.

858
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:23,982
Maybe I'm wrong, Miss Teale.
That dress might suit you very well.

859
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,622
This is the bit of international diplomacy

860
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,634
I shall boast about to my grandchildren,
the nasty little demons.

861
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,635
I'll take the dress.
But I want to try it on first.

862
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,934
The more I think of it, the more I am sure

863
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:43,035
the dress will bring out
something elegantly alluring in you.

864
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,705
Well, I always know the moment
I see a dress

865
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,806
whether it'll be right for me or not.

866
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:23,584
I'll take this drink and then the food.

867
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,381
- Gee, I'm starved.
- Me, too.

868
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:28,252
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Oh, hello, Huck.

869
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,184
- Hello, Soph.
- Hello.

870
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,420
Oh, say, Huck,
will you take care of Sophie for a minute?

871
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:35,020
I want to see about a table.
Pardon me, Sophie.

872
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,396
- Here's a drink waiting for you.
- Oh, thanks, John. Thanks.

873
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,577
- Got the new dress on, Soph?
- Certainly.

874
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:56,209
You don't know it,
but this is a great moment in my life.

875
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,276
- Oh, thank you, Huck.
- Thank you.

876
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,719
Don't you think
this dress does something for me?

877
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,884
- It'll do something for me.
- Oh, now, Huck.

878
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:08,959
- A dress like this depends on...
- I know, it depends on that shoulder strap.

879
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,561
Has John seen it yet?

880
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,738
- Afraid he won't like it.
- And why not?

881
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,368
He thinks everything I wear is perfect.

882
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,936
If I ever ask him how he likes a dress,
he just looks at me

883
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:28,244
with calf-eyes and says,
"Gee, darling, you look swell."

884
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,412
I bet he won't say it about that one.

885
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,581
I'll bet you $100 he says,
"Gee, that looks swell."

886
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,421
- Make it francs, and it's a bet.
- Sold.

887
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:49,299
Look, John,
we want you to settle a little bet.

888
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,339
Sophie has a very important question
to ask you.

889
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,237
Gee, that's swell.

890
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:05,152
How do you like it? Isn't it a knockout?

891
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:08,188
It's the worst-looking thing I ever saw.

892
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,324
Gee, darling, you look terrible.

893
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:18,527
- Who sold it to you?
- Your partner.

894
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:22,628
She thought it brought out
something elegantly alluring in me.

895
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,440
Oh, she did, did she?

896
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:30,643
I'm sorry I said anything, Sophie.
It isn't your fault, you send it back.

897
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,774
I will not send it back.
It's the smartest thing in your shop.

898
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,216
But what do you know
about clothes anyway?

899
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,651
You make yourself ridiculous
by even discussing them.

900
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:43,317
I knew enough about them
to order that thing out of our line.

901
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,984
Let me tell you something, John Kent,

902
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,291
now that you think you know something
about women's clothes...

903
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,625
- Please.
- Now that you are carrying on

904
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:49,789
- with your dressmaker.
- Shut up.

905
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,992
I won't shut up. You're in love with her.

906
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,127
I could tell it
the minute she came into your office.

907
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,727
Let's go home.

908
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:58,906
I'll go home and I'll go home alone.

909
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,635
Suit yourself.

910
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:06,013
- What? You'd let me?
- Why not?

911
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,748
And now we're getting down to cases,
here's something I want to tell you.

912
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,979
You've bawled me out for the last time.

913
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,817
I've stood for all your knocking
and criticism

914
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:16,687
because it sounded so cute
coming from such a little snip.

915
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,818
And because I thought I loved you.

916
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:22,921
- Oh, you thought you loved me?
- Yes, and what a sap you've made of me.

917
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:26,191
Well, it certainly didn't take much effort.

918
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:29,328
And don't you ever
come crawling back to me again.

919
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:32,196
Because I'm through. Through!

920
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:37,102
Do you hear me?

921
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:40,439
Do you hear me?

922
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:42,677
Sure, but I thought you said
you were through.

923
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,946
- Well, I am.
- Well, goodbye!

924
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,185
Goodbye!

925
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:52,922
Noisy.

926
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,592
- Give me a dozen brandies.
- A dozen?

927
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,427
Yeah, and line them up right here.

928
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,716
Is there anything I can do for you?

929
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:28,948
No.

930
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:30,886
<i>Think of what you're losing</i>

931
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:33,621
<i>by constantly refusing to dance with me</i>

932
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,323
<i>You'd be the idol of France with me</i>

933
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:40,129
<i>And yet you stand there</i>
<i>and shake your foolish head dramatically</i>

934
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,693
<i>While I wait here so ecstatically</i>

935
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:45,330
<i>You just look and say emphatically</i>

936
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:49,901
<i>Not this season</i>
<i>There's a reason</i>

937
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,837
<i>I won't dance</i>
<i>Don't ask me</i>

938
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,179
<i>I won't dance</i>
<i>Don't ask me</i>

939
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,345
<i>I won't dance, madam, with you</i>

940
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,990
<i>My heart won't let my feet</i>
<i>do things they should do</i>

941
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,259
<i>You know what? You're lovely</i>

942
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,763
<i>And so what? I'm lovely</i>

943
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:12,993
<i>But oh, what you do to me</i>

944
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:17,495
<i>I'm like an ocean wave</i>
<i>that's bumped on the shore</i>

945
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:22,074
<i>I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor</i>

946
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:27,444
<i>Ah, but when you dance</i>
<i>you're charming and you're gentle</i>

947
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:32,084
<i>Especially when you do the Continental</i>

948
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:36,791
<i>But this feeling isn't purely mental</i>

949
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:41,553
<i>For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos</i>

950
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,757
<i>And that's why I won't dance</i>

951
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,158
<i>Why should I?</i>

952
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,225
<i>I won't dance</i>
<i>How could I?</i>

953
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,703
<i>I won't dance, merci beaucoup</i>

954
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:50,898
<i>Won't you?</i>

955
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:54,431
<i>I know that music leads the way</i>
<i>to romance</i>

956
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:59,446
<i>And if I hold you in my arms I won't dance</i>

957
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:36,995
Bravo! Bravo!

958
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:43,876
Good work.

959
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,875
<i>I won't dance, ta-da-dah</i>

960
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,143
<i>I won't dance</i>

961
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:54,515
Get the musicians, quick.

962
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:58,386
<i>I want a drink, ta-da-dah</i>

963
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:01,452
<i>I want a drink, ta-da-dah</i>

964
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,293
<i>I want a drink, ta-da-dah</i>

965
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:15,137
Your Highness, this is a great honor.

966
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:31,585
Broken down prince
rates a lot of trumpeting.

967
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:51,295
- What is it?
- You are going to sing for us.

968
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,532
- Oh, am I?
- Yes.

969
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,343
All right.

970
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:15,422
<i>They asked me how I knew</i>

971
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:20,991
<i>My true love was true</i>

972
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:24,664
<i>I of course replied</i>

973
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,176
<i>Something here inside</i>

974
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:34,443
<i>Cannot be denied</i>

975
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:38,712
<i>They said someday</i>

976
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:44,748
<i>You'll find all who love are blind</i>

977
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:50,064
<i>When your heart's on fire</i>

978
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:53,898
<i>You must realize</i>

979
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:58,929
<i>smoke gets in your eyes</i>

980
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:05,443
<i>So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed</i>

981
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:11,519
<i>To think they could doubt my love</i>

982
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:17,152
<i>Yet today my love has flown away</i>

983
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:23,220
<i>I am without my love</i>

984
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:29,901
<i>Now laughing friends deride</i>

985
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:35,876
<i>Tears I cannot hide</i>

986
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:40,444
<i>So I smile and say</i>

987
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:46,315
<i>When the lovely flame dies</i>

988
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,680
<i>Smoke gets</i>

989
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:54,729
<i>in your eyes</i>

990
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:28,356
<i>They said someday</i>

991
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:34,424
<i>you'll find all who love are blind</i>

992
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:40,334
<i>When your heart's on fire</i>

993
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:44,208
<i>You must realize</i>

994
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:50,273
<i>Smoke gets in your eyes</i>

995
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:56,046
<i>So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed</i>

996
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:57,716
<i>To think I could</i>

997
01:19:57,826 --> 01:20:01,819
<i>Doubt my love</i>

998
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:05,162
<i>Yet to... my love</i>

999
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:14,532
- Nice of you to join us.
- Now, don't try and high-hat me

1000
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:17,442
just because you happen to be
with a broken-down prince.

1001
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:19,673
- Please go away, John.
- No, I wanna talk to you.

1002
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,739
- You're not yourself.
- Yes, I am. I'm twice myself.

1003
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,374
I wanna talk to you.

1004
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,682
What do you mean selling that dress?
Didn't I tell you to throw it out?

1005
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,620
- I didn't intend to.
- You did, too.

1006
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:31,021
It was a dirty trick to play
on a friend of mine.

1007
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:34,186
- Please go away, Mr. Kent.
- You stick to your own business.

1008
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:37,026
- Laddie, please.
- Well, what have you got to say?

1009
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:40,556
- I've nothing to say.
- Oh, you have nothing to say.

1010
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:43,532
Well, I have.
And I think it was a sneaking thing to do.

1011
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:46,631
Telling Sophie she looked
elegantly alluring in an ugly, vulgar...

1012
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:49,733
- Please, John, tomorrow.
- No, I want it out, now.

1013
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:52,903
All right, I'll tell you.
I sold her that vulgar, tasteless dress

1014
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:56,417
because I thought it suited her perfectly.
I think she suits you perfectly.

1015
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:58,384
I think you're perfectly matched.

1016
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:01,945
And after this, you'd better count
on running your business without me.

1017
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:04,992
- Stephanie, I...
- Now, will you please go?

1018
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:35,150
<i>So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed</i>

1019
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:39,990
<i>To think they could doubt my love</i>

1020
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:45,961
<i>Yet today my love has flown away</i>

1021
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:51,833
<i>I am without my love</i>

1022
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:58,845
<i>Now laughing friends deride</i>

1023
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:05,075
<i>Tears I cannot hide</i>

1024
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:09,287
<i>So</i>

1025
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:14,124
<i>I smile and say</i>

1026
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:18,728
<i>When the lovely flame</i>

1027
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,734
<i>dies</i>

1028
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:27,965
<i>Smoke gets in your...</i>

1029
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:44,985
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I know, but look, this is no joke.

1030
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:48,924
I didn't say I'd take care of your silly
dressmaking business indefinitely.

1031
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,691
But you can't give it to me. I won't take it.

1032
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:54,098
- You've got a band to look after.
- I've got a band to look after.

1033
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:56,693
I know, but John,
Stephanie isn't here, either.

1034
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,399
<i>- Monsieur.</i>
- What? Yeah, the one with the spots.

1035
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:01,532
What? Well, how do I know were she is?

1036
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,077
I only agreed to do this thing
to help you out, you know.

1037
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:05,703
But it isn't my racket either.

1038
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,839
- Tell him you've got a band!
- I've got a band!

1039
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:10,544
And both the band and the shop
will be on the rocks this way!

1040
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,711
I don't care which one you use.
They're both terrible.

1041
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:14,778
What? Yeah, that was the Countess.
Well, what about it?

1042
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,516
- Yes, but don't you think...
- I don't think...

1043
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:18,218
Look, use the other one, the both of them.

1044
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,284
The whole flock of them. Out. Out.

1045
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:21,521
What?

1046
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,564
Look, John, if I knew
where Stephanie was

1047
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:26,429
I wouldn't be wasting my time
with you, babe.

1048
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,961
I know,
but somebody's got to come and take

1049
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,231
this ridiculous business off my shoulders.

1050
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:34,707
In the four days I've been here,
my voice is beginning to change.

1051
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,909
John, but wait. Don't hang up.

1052
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:42,311
He won't come back.

1053
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:45,316
Now what am I gonna do?

1054
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:49,555
- You're not asking my opinion, are you?
- Yes. No.

1055
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:51,420
<i>Pardon, monsieur,</i> but do you think

1056
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:55,452
we should use <i>matelassé</i> for
the "after twilight" number or <i>paillettes?</i>

1057
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:57,394
And what about the tippet?

1058
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:06,631
- Well, what do you think?
- I wouldn't know, <i>monsieur.</i>

1059
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:10,671
Well, personally,
I go in for the simple things.

1060
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,340
- Which is the simpler?
- There is no difference, <i>monsieur.</i>

1061
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,814
Well, then,
use whichever we have the most of.

1062
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,820
We have plenty of all.

1063
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:24,351
Oh, we have?

1064
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:30,628
- Well, then use a little of each.
- A sort of a patchwork quilt.

1065
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,929
Yeah. No.

1066
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:37,761
It will be newer that way
and have much more chic.

1067
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,467
Tell <i>Madame</i> Blanchard
that's my final decision.

1068
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:48,675
Stephanie.

1069
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:55,389
- I knew you'd come back.
- I came back to tell John Kent he's insane.

1070
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:57,481
Where is he? Look at those.

1071
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,625
How do you think
women are going to react to those?

1072
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,064
Where is Mr. Kent?

1073
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,863
Oh, he's not here.
He's been staying away, too.

1074
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:13,066
- Who has been running the business?
- Did you say running or ruining?

1075
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:17,005
Well, someone had to do it.
You and John left it flat.

1076
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,043
But I thought surely he was here.

1077
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,980
Well, if he were, he doesn't know
any more about it than Huck does.

1078
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,144
Not as much.
You are the one who is needed, Stephanie.

1079
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,551
Well, that's impossible.

1080
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:29,646
Why? Just because you and John
are in love with each other?

1081
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:33,251
Don't be fantastic, Huck.
John isn't in love with me.

1082
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:37,894
Is it fantastic when a man
is eating his heart out for you?

1083
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:40,160
When your name is continually on his lips?

1084
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:42,100
When he stands around
dark street corners

1085
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:43,932
just to get a glimpse of you?

1086
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:45,665
- He doesn't.
- He does, and more.

1087
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,903
Everyone around here knows it
but you, Stephanie.

1088
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:50,341
And maybe John.

1089
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:53,744
- But he's always quarreling with me.
- Well, what more can you ask?

1090
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:57,841
Oh, that's nothing. People in love
are always quarreling with each other.

1091
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,114
Now you take Liz and myself for instance.

1092
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:02,086
Liz? Who is this Liz?

1093
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:05,392
Oh, a little country girl from back home
that I'm thinking of marrying.

1094
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:09,089
You know, big feet, dumb, simple.
Oh, very simple.

1095
01:26:10,031 --> 01:26:13,523
Well, the simple and dumb ones
make the best wives sometimes.

1096
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:17,730
Well, forgetting about this girl of Huck's
from back home, with the big feet,

1097
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:20,035
what about Roberta? What about John?

1098
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:23,441
Yes, Stephanie, you must come back
for Aunt Minnie's sake.

1099
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,646
No, I'm sorry. I can't.

1100
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:29,813
Stephanie, you must.

1101
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:31,382
Come in.

1102
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,478
Oh, I'm sorry.

1103
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:36,317
Oh, <i>mademoiselle,</i> I am so happy.
Now you can...

1104
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,790
Give those to Mr. Haines, Albert.

1105
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:44,423
Well, there are some dresses
that men will fall for.

1106
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:49,736
- I practically designed those myself.
- I've seen worse, darling, but not much.

1107
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:54,608
And what do you think, Stephanie?
Are they as bad as that?

1108
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:57,839
Well, the men may like them,
but I'm sure the women won't.

1109
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:04,451
Well, maybe you're right
and maybe you're wrong.

1110
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:08,011
- We'll just have to try them out, I guess.
- But, Huck, you can't.

1111
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:10,317
Roberta's never put out clothes like those.

1112
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:12,450
Roberta's is in new hands now.

1113
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:17,588
But this is like the mode
two seasons back.

1114
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:19,858
I know, but I liked them better then.

1115
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:22,027
But nobody will buy them.

1116
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:26,306
Well, you'd be laughed out of Paris
if you did a thing like that.

1117
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:28,968
The trend is away from such styles.

1118
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:31,603
- I'm not interested in the trend.
- But you've got to be.

1119
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,512
You don't understand.
You're giving a fashion show next week.

1120
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:36,481
Every couturier in Europe
is going to be watching.

1121
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,348
You can't afford to show
models like those.

1122
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:41,013
Well, of course you cannot.
Stephanie is right!

1123
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:42,885
What does it matter
as long as they're pretty?

1124
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:44,686
But clothes must be more than pretty.

1125
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:47,454
Look, the trouble with that is it...

1126
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:50,656
It fits in the wrong places.

1127
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:55,128
Such a pity.
The famous Roberta to go second rate.

1128
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:58,466
- Roberta's will never go second rate.
- Who is to stop it?

1129
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,633
The fashion show next week
will be a colossal flop.

1130
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:03,470
Maybe we should call off
the fashion show.

1131
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:04,636
I think so.

1132
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:07,681
- We might better put on a good one.
- Now you're talking, Stephanie.

1133
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:11,014
We'll put on a better-than-good one.
We'll give them some entertainment, too.

1134
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:12,677
- How about your band?
- That's a great idea.

1135
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:13,880
- Yeah.
- We'll bring over my band.

1136
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:15,387
- A musical fashion show.
- Yes, that's it.

1137
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,550
- It'll be marvelous.
- And you can make the new designs.

1138
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,449
<i>We endorse this polo rig, of course</i>

1139
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:51,020
<i>And for an added 1,000 francs</i>
<i>we furnish horses</i>

1140
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:55,453
<i>Or if you're doing splits on skis</i>
<i>at St. Moritz</i>

1141
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,895
<i>You'd be the best-dressed</i>
<i>"faller-downer" on the courses</i>

1142
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:03,762
<i>Now take the dowager who is glad</i>
<i>to leave her watchman for tea</i>

1143
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:07,799
<i>She'll wear this patriotic plaid</i>
<i>and meet that Scotchman for tea</i>

1144
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:11,377
<i>When summertime begins</i>
<i>this costume always wins</i>

1145
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:14,813
<i>When 50 million little Frenchmen</i>
<i>clap their fins</i>

1146
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:18,908
<i>For hunting grouse or quail</i>
<i>Roberta ran up this suit</i>

1147
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:23,420
<i>The modest price includes</i>
<i>the bag, the gun and two ducks to shoot</i>

1148
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,760
<i>And should Amelia Earhart care</i>
<i>to get a breath of air</i>

1149
01:29:26,828 --> 01:29:30,320
<i>this is the last thing in the world</i>
<i>she'd ever wear</i>

1150
01:29:35,837 --> 01:29:40,297
- Ladislaw, are we gathering later?
- The Princess begs to be excused.

1151
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:43,343
We are leaving for Rome
immediately the showing is finished.

1152
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:50,614
<i>It is the hour for dry martinis</i>

1153
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:53,279
<i>The park is full of little Fords</i>
<i>and Isotta Fraschinis</i>

1154
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:55,822
<i>The Ritz bar is serving caviar and weenies</i>

1155
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:57,356
<i>Madame is there</i>

1156
01:29:57,458 --> 01:30:00,120
<i>And from Roberta she has something</i>
<i>that is too divine on</i>

1157
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:03,459
<i>The sort of thing your jealous friends</i>
<i>would love to spill their wine on</i>

1158
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:06,659
<i>For your inspection, our cocktail collection</i>

1159
01:32:28,242 --> 01:32:31,643
<i>Clothes must play a part</i>

1160
01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:35,273
<i>To light an eye, to win a heart</i>

1161
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:38,011
<i>They say a gown can almost speak</i>

1162
01:32:39,153 --> 01:32:41,644
<i>If it is chic</i>

1163
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:46,284
<i>Should you select the right effect</i>
<i>you cannot miss</i>

1164
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:50,521
<i>And night and day</i>

1165
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:55,261
<i>He is sure to say</i>

1166
01:32:58,039 --> 01:33:02,703
<i>Lovely to look at</i>
<i>delightful to know</i>

1167
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:05,802
<i>And heaven to kiss</i>

1168
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:09,881
<i>A combination like this</i>

1169
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:13,886
<i>Is quite my most impossible scheme</i>
<i>come true</i>

1170
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:19,118
<i>lmagine finding a dream like you</i>

1171
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,851
<i>You're lovely to look at</i>

1172
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:24,864
<i>It's thrilling to hold you</i>

1173
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:29,130
<i>Terribly tight</i>

1174
01:33:29,203 --> 01:33:32,366
<i>For we're together, the moon is new</i>

1175
01:33:32,473 --> 01:33:35,670
<i>And oh, it's lovely to look at you</i>

1176
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:40,703
<i>Tonight</i>

I have never seen
Princess Stephanie look so lovely.

1202
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:27,781
Yes. We shall miss her now that
she and Prince Ladislaw are leaving Paris.

1203
01:35:28,756 --> 01:35:31,316
Oh, did she marry him?

1204
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,300
<i>At night when madame</i>
<i>leaves the quiet of her hall room</i>

1205
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:42,801
<i>To drag her very weary feet</i>
<i>around the ballroom</i>

1206
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,600
<i>Her clothes and jewels must be</i>
<i>a monument of power</i>

1207
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:48,164
<i>I mean, the monument</i>
<i>they call the Eiffel Tower</i>

1208
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:50,072
<i>We'll show you the gown we made</i>
<i>Marie,</i>

<i>Queen of Romania</i>

1210
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:55,347
<i>We also ran up three of these</i>
<i>for Mrs. Smudge, Pennsylvania</i>

<i>The lights are low, here we go</i>

1212
01:38:46,153 --> 01:38:50,283
<i>Lovely to look at, delightful to know</i>

1221
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:46,465
- Oh, my. Oh, my.
- What?

1222
01:41:46,967 --> 01:41:50,960
- I said, "My, oh, my." That was lovely.
- It went well, didn't it?

1223
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,875
- I guess I'll have to give in to you.
- To me?

1224
01:41:56,677 --> 01:41:58,838
But I didn't say anything.

1225
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:01,773
But I thought you were
about to want to marry me.

1226
01:42:01,849 --> 01:42:05,046
- Well, I was.
- Well, I accept.

1227
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:07,617
Well, thanks very much.

1228
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:10,714
Well, you're quite welcome,
my fine feathered friend.

1229
01:42:10,858 --> 01:42:14,021
Hey! Hey!

1230
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:20,998
- Hey, do something about this. Will you?
- Just a moment. You stay right there.

1231
01:42:21,068 --> 01:42:23,536
Well, where do you think I can go?

1232
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:29,672
- John.
- Stephanie, I...

1233
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:39,708
- Stephanie, are you happy?
- Tremendously.

1234
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:44,020
- Then I am, too.
- Well.

1235
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:46,686
Haven't you anything more to say?

1236
01:42:47,027 --> 01:42:50,986
No. Only congratulations
and have a good time and goodbye.

1237
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:08,074
I'm sailing for New York tomorrow.

1238
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:12,609
You're being very heroic about something.
What is it?

1239
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:14,346
Oh, I was just thinking it must be fun

1240
01:43:14,421 --> 01:43:17,948
to suddenly find yourself a princess
married to a nice prince.

1241
01:43:21,128 --> 01:43:25,565
I was born a princess. I'm not married
to Ladislaw. He's my cousin.

1242
01:43:25,632 --> 01:43:29,693
And you're still a big blundering,
Newfoundland fullback.

1243
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:33,400
- Where are you going?
- Down.

1244
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:37,907
- Why?
- Because I pushed the button.

1245
01:43:37,978 --> 01:43:41,470
- But I want to talk to you.
- That's what you're doing.

1246
01:43:41,949 --> 01:43:44,417
Just let me tell you I love you.

1247
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:51,921
- What does that mean?
- I love you.

1248
01:43:51,992 --> 01:43:53,789
Gee, that's swell.

1249
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:45,261
