1
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:40,879
Have a nice lunch.

2
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,830
Excuse me.

3
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,198
Just a moment, please.
Rossiter Music Company.

4
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,863
- Ms. LeBoy, it's for you.
- Thank you.

5
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:07,607
- Excuse me, miss. I brought a...
- Hello. Ye...

6
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:12,578
Yes. Yes, I heard your song
and I like it very much.

7
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,050
Could you come in, say, around 4:00?
Fine. You're welcome.

8
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,451
- Look, excuse me...
- Just a moment, please.

9
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:28,629
I asked... I'm sorry about that.

10
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,973
- Sorry.
- That's quite all right.

11
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,172
I have a song
that is just wonderful for you.

12
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,250
I told Mr. Rossiter yours is the voice
that can do it justice.

13
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,683
I'll bet you tell that to all the customers.

14
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:53,982
Of course I do,
but in your case, it's true.

15
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:55,784
All right, then.

16
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:03,896
Shine on

17
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:09,027
Shine on
Harvest moon up in the sky

18
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:12,470
I ain't had no lovin'

19
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:16,442
Since January, February, June or July

20
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:21,312
Snow time ain't no time to stay

21
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,509
Outdoors and spoon

22
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:28,487
So shine on, shine on
Harvest moon

23
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:33,254
For me and my gal

24
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,619
That's lunch.

25
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:37,694
Let's eat someplace
where they don't have any music.

26
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:57,842
You may as well stand still.
I can beat you to that door too.

27
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,889
- Who are you?
- Look, all I want is five minutes.

28
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,154
- Read them.
- What are these?

29
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,289
Song lyrics and poems and an operetta,
and underneath that, two musical comedies.

30
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,196
I want an opinion.

31
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,060
- You want an opinion.
- That's all.

32
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,396
Well, I am going to give you one.

33
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:21,134
You are, without a doubt, the most
persistent young man that I've ever met.

34
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:25,481
Now, get yourself a haircut,
make an appointment, and come back.

35
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,440
And for heaven's sake, wear a tie.

36
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,852
Are you gonna publish my songs
or my tie?

37
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,487
Now, wait a minute.
Do you know what this is?

38
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:36,056
Four years of working nights after
wrestling with crockery all day long...

39
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,125
...and nobody to tell me if they're good.

40
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,762
Today, I made up my mind to find out.
Please.

41
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,829
But I just work here.

42
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,864
Why don't you take these
to Mr. Rossiter?

43
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:47,798
I'm having a tough enough time.
How could I see your boss?

44
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,235
I'm very sorry,
but this is my lunch hour and...

45
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:51,430
Well, be my guest.

46
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:54,775
Salami on pumpernickel,
homemade pumpernickel.

47
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:59,677
You couldn't do better at the Palmer House.
Believe me, you'll enjoy them.

48
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:04,683
I'll get you a drink. There.

49
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:27,201
Are they all about William Howard Taft
and the Statue of Liberty?

50
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:28,366
Anything wrong?

51
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,444
Don't you ever write about
simple things?

52
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,240
Things that you know and you feel?

53
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,543
- You don't like them, huh?
- I didn't say that.

54
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:37,709
But I wouldn't wanna sit
on a boy's lap...

55
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,685
...and have him sing
about Washington crossing the Delaware.

56
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,788
What's that got to do with it?

57
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:46,722
Do you know why
you write a popular song?

58
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:47,885
Let me explain.

59
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:51,431
Because most boys and girls don't
know how to say "I love you."

60
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:56,595
So you've got to say it for them,
in 32 bars of music, no more, no less.

61
00:05:58,374 --> 00:05:59,671
Just like that.

62
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:03,938
Who are you to make new rules? If a song
is good, people will sing it, no matter what.

63
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,207
- You asked for my opinion.
- All right, so I made a mistake.

64
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,851
You'd probably turn down
"The Star-Spangled Banner"...

65
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,979
...if it didn't say
"I love you by the dawn's early light."

66
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:19,225
Two salami sandwiches
down the drain.

67
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,766
At least you've had your lunch.

68
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,934
Thirty-two bars of music to say
"I love you."

69
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,372
What if I said, "I hate you"?
They could shoot me?

70
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,011
What am I talking to you for?

71
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:39,444
You don't understand.
Nobody understands.

72
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,207
I hope I haven't discouraged you.

73
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:44,653
What's four years' work?

74
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,292
For that which we are about
to receive...

75
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:58,229
...we thank the William Rossiter
Music Company.

76
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,562
- Oh, now, Father.
- Well, it's true.

77
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:05,139
My daughter earns as much at that great
citadel of culture as I do teaching school.

78
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:07,868
If it bothers you, Father,
I'll have them cut my salary.

79
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,272
That isn't what bothers me.

80
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:11,777
It's the type of person
you have to associate with.

81
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,816
And the grossness of their nature
will have weight to drag thee down.

82
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:18,385
Father thinks they're not fit
for a nice girl, dear.

83
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:20,181
But he hasn't even met
one of them.

84
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,789
And if he did, he'd like them.

85
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,791
They're sensitive musicians and
composers and poets...

86
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,327
...in spite of what Father thinks.

87
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:30,091
- I'll see who it is.
- Oh, thanks.

88
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,598
Your trouble is
you shouldn't have had a daughter.

89
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:34,633
You should have had a marble statue.

90
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:39,264
Quite right, my dear. Only, we didn't
know how to go about it.

91
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:41,771
Coming.

92
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,613
- A guy could freeze to death.
- What are you doing here?

93
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:51,980
I called your office.
They gave me your address.

94
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:53,281
Nice of them.

95
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:57,119
You know, after I left you this morning,
I got to thinking about what you said.

96
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,352
- So I did it.
- Did what?

97
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:02,657
The lyric. You know, simple, what I feel.

98
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:05,130
Here, read it, Ms. LeBoy.

99
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,934
- What's your name?
- Gus. Gus Kahn.

100
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,368
Well, Mr. Kahn,
we happen to be having our dinner.

101
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,441
If you bring that to the office,
I'll be happy to look at it.

102
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:16,271
It's very cold and I walked a long way.
Look at it now.

103
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:19,881
- Who is it, dear?
- Just a young man I met at the office.

104
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,711
- Bring him into the dining room.
- He has to leave, Mother.

105
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,046
I don't have to leave. I'd like to come in.

106
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,883
- We'll be in in a minute.
- All right, dear.

107
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:30,386
Don't you ever wear a tie?

108
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,994
What's with you and ties?
You'd think I was naked.

109
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:35,494
Wait here. I'll get one of my father's.

110
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:42,397
You and my mother are the same.
Ties, ties. Worried about ties.

111
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:45,006
Hold still. I'll put this on.

112
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,137
You didn't have your hair cut either.

113
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,710
Maybe you could get me one
of your father's.

114
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,868
Come on.

115
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,910
This is Mr. Kahn. He's a lyric-writer.

116
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:58,519
I am not a bit surprised.

117
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:01,680
There is about him
the unmistakable aura of the poet.

118
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:04,052
- How do you do, Mr. Kahn?
- How do you do?

119
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:07,094
You'll excuse us...
Oh, I suppose you've had your dinner?

120
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,691
I could eat.

121
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:12,129
Bring Omar Khayyám
his loaf of bread and jug of wine.

122
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,032
The name's Gus, and if it's
all the same to you, I'll have soup.

123
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:20,232
- Bring Gus his soup.
- Why, yes. Yes, indeed.

124
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:23,640
I had no idea Mr. Kahn was coming tonight.
I'm a little embarrassed.

125
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,611
Oh, think nothing of it, my dear.
You're the only one who Is.

126
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:29,751
- I hope I'm not busting in or anything.
- No apologies, Mr. Kahn.

127
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,683
- Genius is its own excuse.
- Father, please.

128
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:36,882
Tell me, what has the muse
inspired you to today?

129
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:40,859
If you mean what did I write,
I just knocked out a love song.

130
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,259
Beautifully put.

131
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,060
Father, I've read Mr. Kahn's work.

132
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,897
And if he's written a love song,
I'm sure it is beautiful.

133
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:53,030
I can't think of anything
the world needs more than a new love lyric.

134
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,804
After all, Shelley and Keats
have been going downhill for some time...

135
00:09:56,979 --> 00:10:02,315
...and who couldn't knock out something
better than Elizabeth Barrett Browning's:

136
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:06,186
How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

137
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,483
I love thee to the depth
And breadth and height

138
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,628
My soul can reach,
When feeling out of sight

139
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:15,355
For the ends of being and ideal grace.

140
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:22,130
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.

141
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:24,295
Could I have the rest of it?

142
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:28,269
Wring out my tie, Mr. Kahn,
and I'll continue.

143
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:30,805
Gosh, I'm sorry.

144
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:33,610
Oh, gosh.

145
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,010
Gosh, l... Please, would you go on?

146
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:43,322
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.

147
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:46,620
I love thee purely,
As they turn from praise.

148
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,991
I love thee with a passion put to use

149
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:52,396
In my old griefs,
And with my childhood's faith.

150
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,594
I love thee with a...

151
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:02,239
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose

152
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:06,177
With my lost saints.
I love thee with the breath

153
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:10,217
Smiles, tears, of all my life;
And, if God choose

154
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:13,753
I shall but love thee better after death.

155
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,022
Excuse me.

156
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:23,396
Father.

157
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:28,166
Mr. Kahn. Mr. Kahn, I want to apologize.

158
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:30,066
What for? He's right.

159
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,139
What's a mug like me
doing with a pencil?

160
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,902
But nobody expects you to write like that.

161
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:37,170
Express yourself in
your own way, Mr. Kahn.

162
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:41,009
And if you can make others feel
what you feel, that's poetry.

163
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,912
Some people are meant to write poems.

164
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:45,076
Some people are meant
to move crockery.

165
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:48,712
I wouldn't expect my horse to get up
on the seat and start driving.

166
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,886
Good night.
I'm sorry if I've troubled you.

167
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:55,997
Well, what about the lyric
you walked through the snow with?

168
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,624
Have yourself a laugh.

169
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:19,586
"Gee, I wish that I had
a girl like the other fellows have."

170
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,098
Gracie, look at these figures.

171
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,861
"Smiling Through,"
450,000 copies already.

172
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,564
It was an inspiration you had to let
John McCormack introduce it.

173
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,799
I wanna talk to you
about something.

174
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:17,673
You don't have to. Without a word,
I'm raising your salary $5 a week.

175
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,441
Get back to work on the two dogs
we are trying to push.

176
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:21,810
- Mr. Rossiter.
- What?

177
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:23,383
I've written a song.

178
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,514
It happens every time.

179
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,486
Every good demonstrator
wants to be a bad songwriter.

180
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:31,717
But this is a wonderful lyric
I ran across, just crying for a tune.

181
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,863
Better it should cry than me.
No, Gracie, look.

182
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,965
How many good songs do we have
lying in the catalog...

183
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,397
...that die
because they've not been plugged?

184
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,663
And how many bad songs
have you yourself helped to become hits?

185
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,334
Now, Gracie, believe me, to me, you are
a much greater artist than Victor Herbert.

186
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:51,980
I'll make that a $ 10-a-week raise.

187
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:56,777
- Don't you even wanna hear the song?
- No. I might like it.

188
00:13:56,952 --> 00:14:00,752
Then I'll take it someplace else,
because this song has to be published.

189
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,556
But you can't go to another publisher
while you work for me.

190
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,491
I don't work for you anymore,
Mr. Rossiter.

191
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,130
Then you don't get that raise.

192
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,665
I'm sorry, Ms. LeBoy. I just can't do it.

193
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:23,243
But you wouldn't have to pay us very
much for the song. Say $ 10?

194
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,812
You say it. Business is so bad,
I can't say anything.

195
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:28,347
We don't care.
We'll work just for royalties.

196
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,747
We'll work night and day
and do our own plugging.

197
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,616
What's this "we"?
Who's the silent partner in this deal?

198
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,758
- Mr. Kahn, the lyricist.
- Where is he, in hiding?

199
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:40,191
I don't know. I haven't seen him
since he gave me the lyric.

200
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:42,523
That's why I've got to have
this song published.

201
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,290
I don't follow.

202
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,991
Then I'd have reason
to see him again.

203
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:54,539
Mr. Townsend, would it cost me very much
to have a few copies printed?

204
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,715
- Go on, play the number.
- Thank you.

205
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,079
Oh, what can I lose?
I'm in receivership now.

206
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:06,983
Hurry, before they come
and take the piano.

207
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,423
How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

208
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:14,324
I love thee to the depth
And breadth and height

209
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,088
My soul can reach

210
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,665
I love thee purely,
As they turn from praise.

211
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,894
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs

212
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,265
Who is opening the door?

213
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,929
And with my childhood's faith.

214
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:26,768
Me. Like always.

215
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:30,173
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose

216
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,372
With my lost saints.
I love thee with the breath

217
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:34,607
Please come in.

218
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:38,617
- Smile, tears...
- Gus, it's for you. A girl.

219
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:40,254
- Mr. Kahn.
- Ms. LeBoy.

220
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:44,119
Excuse me for being so forward, but
I just had to come and congratulate you.

221
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:46,488
- For what?
- For this.

222
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,929
- When did this happen?
- I put a tune to it that same night.

223
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,696
What'd you do that for?

224
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,805
Let me see.

225
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:06,774
"Lyrics by Gus Kahn."
Gus, your name, printed.

226
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,246
What's the matter?

227
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:11,409
Couldn't your father have lived
to see this?

228
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:14,488
Ma, it's just a song.
It's not the Declaration of Independence.

229
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:15,954
How could you understand it?

230
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,855
Five years old you were
when we came to this country.

231
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:23,624
But your father and I,
how long we struggled with the language.

232
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,267
Me, I'm still struggling.

233
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:30,371
But my son, he makes a song out of it.

234
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,270
Gee, if it means that much to you,
I'm glad she did it.

235
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,911
- Thanks, Ms. LeBoy.
- Gus!

236
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,139
This is the way
how you treat a lady visitor?

237
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:42,215
You should have some strudel with us.

238
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:43,749
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you very much.

239
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,614
- Sit down.
- And coffee.

240
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:48,882
My mother makes
the best strudel in town.

241
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,219
You should excuse the dishes.

242
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:56,431
But if a little bit is chipped off,
he gets it free from the warehouse.

243
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,123
Gus, I forgot,
some more saucers we need.

244
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:02,031
Okay, Ma. I'll chip some tomorrow.

245
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:06,068
Mr. Kahn, you're not going back to the
warehouse after writing a song like this.

246
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:07,230
Well, why not?

247
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,707
I promised the publisher
we'd do our own plugging.

248
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:13,181
- Plugging?
- Get the song heard and played.

249
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:15,839
It takes 24 hours a day, Mr. Kahn.

250
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,952
You mean you want me to quit my job?

251
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,712
But this is your big chance.

252
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:23,551
What if the song doesn't go over?
Who's gonna help pay the rent?

253
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:25,489
Listen to him with the rent.

254
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,788
Who paid the rent
while you were growing up?

255
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,693
And what are your brothers,
pushcart peddlers?

256
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:32,993
Believe me, we won't starve.

257
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:36,331
- And there'll always be strudel.
- Yup.

258
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:37,494
She's very sweet.

259
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:40,574
She gets so excited.
Ma, what are you excited about?

260
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:43,974
When I walk down Michigan Boulevard,
people should say:

261
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,707
"There goes the mother of Gus Kahn,
the songwriter."

262
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:53,253
Not "The mother of Gus Kahn who chips
dishes for Albert Pick and Company."

263
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,854
Now what are you doing?

264
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,856
- Please.
- What's that for?

265
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:02,292
I would like to buy the first one.

266
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,658
Here. Mrs. Kahn, I'd love to play it
for you sometime.

267
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,532
What for? Gus didn't write the music.

268
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:16,143
Come on, now. Everybody sing.

269
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:20,475
Gee, I wish that I had a girl

270
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:26,087
Like the other fellows had

271
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:30,521
Someone to make a fuss over me

272
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:35,454
To cheer me up when I feel sad

273
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:40,091
On Wednesday night, I'm all alone

274
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:46,105
When I ought to be up
At some sweetheart's home

275
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:51,002
And I'm lonesome
Awful lonesome

276
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,447
Gee, I wish I had a girl

277
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:57,846
Follow the pointer!

278
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:42,888
- How do you do, Mr. Kahn?
- It's raining like a son of a gun.

279
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,722
Where are the folks?

280
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:49,359
Oh, they're out. They're both out.
They'll be out for quite a while.

281
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:52,098
Good, we can get right to work.
And, boy, do we need it.

282
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,209
We've written quite a few songs,
but we've had only one hit.

283
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:56,901
That's not exactly a career.

284
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,506
It's nothing against you,
but we've gotta dig a little harder.

285
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,047
I've written two new lyrics.

286
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,685
Take a look, one of them
could be a real good song.

287
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:08,345
- Do we have to start right away?
- Sure. What else is there to do?

288
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:10,514
- What could I have been thinking of?
- What?

289
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,353
Oh, nothing.

290
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:14,995
All right. Sit down. Sit down.

291
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:18,098
There's two of them.
One, I like a little better than the other.

292
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,564
Here's "Love in Springtime."

293
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:23,398
And this one is
"The Month of June is a Song of Love."

294
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,540
You know, June is the month of love.

295
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:29,666
Everybody... Everybody gets married in June,
and that's the whole idea.

296
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,143
Now, let's try the verse, huh?

297
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,839
"Every lassie loves a laddie in
the month of June."

298
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,177
Yeah.

299
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:50,522
Mind if I move these? They're in the way.

300
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:55,430
All right, go ahead. The first two lines.

301
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,768
Now, the third line is "Mid..."

302
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:04,845
Why have you got it so dark in here?

303
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,038
How do you expect us
to work in the dark?

304
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,739
Holy smoke. There, that's better.

305
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,078
Go ahead. From the third line.
"Mid the roses..."

306
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:14,484
"Mid the roses, man proposes,
for the world's in tune."

307
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:17,815
From "mid the roses,"
right from there, from the third line.

308
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:20,723
- "Mid the roses, man proposes..."
- Yeah, right from there.

309
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,955
Play it. See what you hear from that.

310
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:34,704
- What is that? What do you got on?
- Real perfume, Nuit d'Amour.

311
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,207
Yeah.

312
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:44,775
Awfully stuffy in here.
Do you mind if I open a window?

313
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,491
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

314
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:53,560
Gee, I had no idea
it was blowing like that.

315
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,165
Let's try it right from the top, huh?
Right from the top.

316
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,734
Good, good. Good.

317
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,342
Gosh, that's good.

318
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,708
That's wonderful.
I wish your folks would go out every night.

319
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,576
We'd get a lot done.
That's real good.

320
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:17,979
Try it again.

321
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:03,694
Oh, that's a beautiful melody,
Mr. Van Alstyne.

322
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:07,160
Here's the surprise.
I've talked Bert into letting Gus do the lyric.

323
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:10,031
- I like his work.
- It'll be a great break for Gus.

324
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:12,935
Bert works with none but the best.
You know his hits:

325
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:16,305
"Shade of the Old Apple Tree,"
"I'm Afraid to Come Home in the Dark."

326
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,275
Let's not go through the whole catalog.

327
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:21,007
I had a feeling he wasn't here
just to tune the piano.

328
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:24,277
- Now, Grace.
- You think I'm holding Gus back.

329
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,151
Yeah. Not only me,
but the whole music business.

330
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,885
After all, Grace, I deserve another hit.
I've been publishing all your flops.

331
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:36,155
You've made up your mind,
even before you've heard my new tune?

332
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,994
If I'd made up my mind sooner,
I'd have saved myself a lot of money.

333
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,331
You've got him as a husband.
Why hang onto him as a partner?

334
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,268
Mr. Kahn and I are not married.

335
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:52,042
What? But I've seen you together for years.
I took it for granted.

336
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:54,839
Grace, do you mean to say
he never even asked you?

337
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,508
He's cleared his throat once or twice,
but that's as far as he's gotten.

338
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,247
Well, why don't we forget about
the whole thing?

339
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,584
I think Gus and Grace
should stick together.

340
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:06,693
I'll leave the music here.
We can get hold of another lyricist.

341
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,887
Mr. Van Alstyne...

342
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:11,191
- Am I late, Fred?
- No. Come in, Gus. Come in.

343
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,563
- You know Bert Van Alstyne.
- By reputation, and I wish I had it.

344
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,931
Hello. Did you played
the new tune for Fred?

345
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,437
I'm a little anxious to hear it myself.

346
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,734
- Well, so long, everybody.
- Oh, just a minute.

347
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:25,846
Mr. Van Alstyne has a beautiful tune
he wants you to write up.

348
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:28,744
Well, I'm flattered, but Ms. LeBoy and l...

349
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,942
Oh, I think you should do it, Mr. Kahn.

350
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,984
We haven't been doing
very well together.

351
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:36,283
Well, now that's settled, when
are you two boys gonna get to work?

352
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,722
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- Don't be silly.

353
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,362
Any lyricist in the world
would jump at this chance.

354
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:44,631
Well, how do you like that?
That's gratitude.

355
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,361
I put on a tie for her, I quit my job,
even cut my hair. We're partners.

356
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:51,802
Now she wants to pawn me off
on a new tune-writer.

357
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:53,770
- All right, let's forget it.
- No, wait.

358
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:57,673
Mr. Kahn, we've got to stop fooling
ourselves right here and now.

359
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:01,543
My tunes aren't in the same class as
your lyrics. Our first hit was an accident.

360
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,240
You wouldn't know a good tune.

361
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,613
- Don't pass up an opportunity...
- Play the song.

362
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:09,553
- Mr. Kahn...
- Ms. LeBoy, I'll pick my own partners.

363
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,154
Play the song.

364
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:15,189
Yes, Mr. Kahn.

365
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:30,868
Hang around.
Tell her how good it is.

366
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,026
This is good.

367
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:10,145
Wonderful! Wonderful!
That's the best thing you ever did.

368
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,809
- Are you sure?
- Sure? I'll leave it to the expert.

369
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,421
You tell her.

370
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:17,786
Well, frankly,
it sounds a little reminiscent.

371
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,620
What does he know?
A few lucky hits.

372
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:22,661
- Thirty million copies, is all.
- I tell you, this is her.

373
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,628
This is what she's like inside.

374
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,327
Do you think I've caught the real me?

375
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,231
Couldn't be anybody else.

376
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,405
Give me a pencil.
Somebody give me a pencil.

377
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,041
Play it again.

378
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:39,104
Oh, wait. Wait till he leaves.
He's liable to steal it.

379
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:45,144
Goodbye, Fred. Mr. Kahn, Ms. LeBoy.
Good luck with your lyric.

380
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,515
You're about to get yourself a song.

381
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:59,723
Memories, memories

382
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:05,032
Dreams of love so true

383
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:09,867
O'er the sea of memory

384
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:16,217
I'm drifting back to you

385
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,887
Childhood days, wild wood days

386
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,519
Among the birds and bees

387
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:32,963
You left me alone

388
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:38,299
But still you're my own

389
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:45,072
In my beautiful memories

390
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,822
I'm very proud to introduce
that beautiful song.

391
00:27:59,994 --> 00:28:01,928
I know you would like to meet
its writers.

392
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:07,694
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the lyricist, Mr. Gus Kahn.

393
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:20,280
And the composer,
Mr. Egbert Van Alstyne.

394
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:27,014
Meet the real me.

395
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,260
Why make a fool of me
in front of those people?

396
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:39,832
- The song's a bit hit, isn't it?
- I don't have to be tricked into success.

397
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,834
If I can't make it on my own,
what's the use of getting there?

398
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:44,972
If that's all the thanks I get, Mr. Kahn...

399
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,973
I wasn't looking for a new partner,
or another girl.

400
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,304
And now I guess
I better start looking for both.

401
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,639
If I've been your girl,
I've never noticed it.

402
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,782
Why, you're still calling me Ms. LeBoy.

403
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:57,509
For years, you've been
blowing cigar smoke in my face...

404
00:28:57,685 --> 00:29:00,210
...acting like a truck driver
and treating me like one.

405
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:02,515
- What's that got to do with it?
- It's all over.

406
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,319
- I'm through with you and your songs.
- Now, you listen here.

407
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,588
You're the most ungrateful person
I have ever met.

408
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:12,289
Oh, but you're gonna be a big songwriter,
Mr. Kahn.

409
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:14,731
Don't let me stand in your way.

410
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:17,633
You're not in my way at all, Grace.

411
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,642
- Gus.
- What?

412
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,075
- You called me Grace.
- I did?

413
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:28,079
Well, you called me Gus.

414
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:31,477
- You know what?
- What?

415
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:33,951
I guess we'll have to get married.

416
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:35,749
Is that a proposal?

417
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:38,722
What, you have to have it in writing?

418
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:44,061
But you've never kissed me.
You never even said you love me.

419
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:49,702
Well, gosh, what do you want?
Moon, June, love, dove.

420
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,862
That's my business all day.

421
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,564
- Mr. Kahn.
- Yeah?

422
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:56,175
Let's get down to business.

423
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:37,615
Come on in, Bert. Grace, you home?
We've been looking all over for you.

424
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:39,013
- Hello, Bert.
- Hello, Grace.

425
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:41,451
Dinner show's in a half-hour.
We're gonna miss it.

426
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:44,285
- Tony Jackson has a new piece.
- They'll play it tonight.

427
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:48,054
"Jelly Roll Rag." Change the melody,
a good lyric, there may be a song in it.

428
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:49,753
- Yeah.
- I must tell you something.

429
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,057
- So tell me.
- Alone.

430
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:52,460
- What?
- Bert, do you mind?

431
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:55,398
- Come on. We're gonna be late.
- Gus, it's important.

432
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,198
- Won't it keep?
- Not if you keep pushing me this way.

433
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:01,001
Pushing? Who's pushing? Let's go.

434
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,456
Please, let's get out of here.
It's so stuffy and smoky.

435
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,121
This is the tune Tony wants us to fix up.

436
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,962
In the bridge, the middle part,
if you can change that...

437
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,104
I think I've got it, I think I've got it.

438
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,403
Gus, I wanna tell you something.

439
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,777
I've told you, when I'm looking
at the ceiling, I'm working.

440
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,748
You'll have to stop for one minute.
This is important.

441
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:46,648
It can't be more important than this.

442
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:51,250
My dear husband,
I'm gonna have a baby.

443
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:53,621
- What?
- I'm gonna have a baby.

444
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:56,923
- What?
- I'm pregnant!

445
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:07,930
- Well, aren't you surprised?
- No.

446
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:11,278
Really? Gee, you think it'll look like me?

447
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:14,347
Oh, no. It's gonna be a pretty baby.

448
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:21,111
Bert. I've got it. I've got it!

449
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:25,783
Everybody loves a baby
That's why I'm in love with you

450
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,158
Pretty baby, pretty baby

451
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:34,563
And I'd like to be your sister
Brother, dad and mother too

452
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:38,763
Pretty baby, pretty baby

453
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,809
Won't you come and let me rock you
In my cradle of love

454
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:47,311
And we'll cuddle all the time

455
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:53,352
Oh, I want a lovin' baby
And it might as well be you

456
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:56,513
Pretty baby of mine

457
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,765
Pretty baby, pretty baby

458
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:19,670
Won't you come and let me rock you
In my cradle of love

459
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:23,715
And we'll cuddle all the time

460
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:29,847
Oh, I want a lovin' baby
And it might as well be you

461
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:34,552
Pretty baby of mine

462
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,663
Pretty baby of...

463
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:42,935
How much are you paying?

464
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,596
- Well, how much do you usually get?
- How much do you usually pay?

465
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,708
Thirty dollars a month.

466
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:52,175
- I usually get 40.
- That's what we pay.

467
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:54,076
Is the work hard?

468
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:57,877
You know, I'm not so young.
I've got a touch of the lumbago too.

469
00:33:58,052 --> 00:33:59,041
How's your sinus?

470
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:01,214
The work is very easy.

471
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,755
We have a small place
and we like simple cooking.

472
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:05,620
Then why did your last maid quit?

473
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:09,158
She married Jack the Ripper
and couldn't handle both jobs.

474
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:13,091
You know, I don't believe
you ever had a maid.

475
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,898
- What business are you in?
- I'm a chicken-plucker.

476
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:20,563
Gus, please.
My husband is a songwriter.

477
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:24,109
Haven't you heard "I Wish I had a Girl,"
"Memories" and "Pretty Baby"?

478
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:26,803
I heard them. I didn't like them.

479
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,411
You didn't like them?
Grace, this is ridiculous.

480
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:34,214
Wouldn't have her in the house
if she worked for nothing.

481
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:39,348
- Get her out before I lose my temper.
- Well, guess I'd better stay.

482
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:42,758
You're a nice woman,
but him, somebody's got to watch.

483
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,261
- Just a minute...
- It's no use.

484
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:46,332
I've made up my mind.
Where's the kitchen?

485
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,593
- It's over there.
- Look...

486
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:50,431
You can think you're the boss,
I'll think I'm the boss...

487
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:53,301
...and you, you just have the baby.

488
00:34:57,712 --> 00:35:00,545
Well, I'm glad she's gonna
let us do something.

489
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:06,514
Gus, what is the matter with you?
You've been growling like a bear lately.

490
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:11,819
I don't know. I don't know, I...

491
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:16,392
I'm going down and see Fred.

492
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:21,831
- It's the song, isn't it?
- Yeah.

493
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:23,402
Now, you listen to me.

494
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,540
"The One I Love" is the best thing
you've ever done.

495
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,504
Take this and show it to him again.

496
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:31,577
If he still doesn't like it,
I'll take it to another publisher.

497
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,874
- But, honey, listen...
- Let me do the worrying.

498
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,919
- Grace thinks it's the best thing I've done.
- She thinks everything's the best.

499
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:49,585
Tell her to trust my judgment. I've
done all right by you so far, haven't I?

500
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:52,790
I've told her, Fred. She says she'll take it
to another publisher.

501
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,026
She'll take it? When do you start voting?

502
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:58,172
Or hasn't Abraham Lincoln freed
the husbands yet?

503
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:00,603
Fred, I don't think any more
of this than you do.

504
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:03,209
- But I don't know, Grace...
- Grace, Grace, Grace.

505
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:05,436
Look, she got you away
from Bert Van Alstyne.

506
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:10,050
She found an ex-coalminer, Isham Jones,
who writes music by the light of his hat...

507
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:12,516
...and now she wants
to change publishers.

508
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:16,384
She's only doing it
for my good, she says.

509
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:20,550
Gus, Grace is a wonderful woman.
I love her almost as much as you do.

510
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:25,358
But now that she's gonna become a mother,
it's time she was told to stay out of music.

511
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:28,400
You're right, Fred.
You're absolutely right.

512
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:31,402
- When are you gonna tell her?
- Me?

513
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:34,598
You paid for the license, you tell her.
And right now.

514
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,174
- Now?
- Now. You wanna wait...

515
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:39,711
...until she becomes a grandmother?
Go home and face her like a man.

516
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:41,849
Now, look, Fred...

517
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:46,720
- Here.
- Another beer?

518
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:50,255
No, no.
Give me about that much courage.

519
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,330
How can I make you understand that,
in my thinking...

520
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:00,467
...a man's gotta be a man
in his own house?

521
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:02,326
Stop running my life.

522
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:05,301
We're gonna have a family.
That ought to be enough for you.

523
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,374
Forget about "The One I Love."
Forget about the music business.

524
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,601
Stop trying to make me such
a great success.

525
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,245
I'm happy, happy the way I am.

526
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:17,677
It wasn't so long ago
I was pushing a crockery wagon.

527
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:20,286
Well, that's just fine.

528
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:23,912
Be sure you tell her all those things
when she comes home.

529
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:29,492
- Where is Mrs. Kahn?
- Somebody phoned...

530
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,428
...and said a Sam Harris was
hearing new songs, auditioning.

531
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,262
You weren't here,
so she went downtown to see him herself.

532
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,961
You let her, in her condition?
Why didn't you stop her?

533
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:39,572
Somebody has to pay my salary.

534
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:45,912
- I need some coffee.
- And so do I. Make enough for two.

535
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,014
What...?

536
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:55,813
Kick a little higher, girls. Now turn.

537
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,787
- That's fine.
- Thank you, girls.

538
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:00,359
- Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.
- You heard him, 10:00.

539
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,086
And I want every girl on time.

540
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:05,824
That guy's a slave driver. Work half
the night, back at 10 in the morning.

541
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,730
It hardly pays to take my clothes off.

542
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,337
This ending is very weak.
Fill up the last four bars.

543
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:17,242
- Save the house lights.
- Save the house lights.

544
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:20,938
- Bring me those sketches.
- Jim, let's see the new sketches again.

545
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:23,239
No, this clashes. You see what I mean?

546
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:27,547
- No, this is more what I need...
- Excuse me, please. Is Mr. Harris here?

547
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,249
Excuse me, please.
I would like to see Mr. Harris.

548
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:33,723
You're seeing him.

549
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,191
- Get on this.
- How do you do?

550
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:37,797
- I'd like to see the second act costumes.
- Costumes...

551
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:40,058
- How do you do? My name is Grace Kahn.
- Hello.

552
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,828
I heard about your audition.
I've got a wonderful song.

553
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:45,529
That was over hours ago.
I've already selected a song.

554
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:47,640
- No, no, honey...
- That isn't fair.

555
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,834
I didn't hear about it till a half-hour ago.
I was home in bed.

556
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:53,310
Look, the name of my song
is "The One I Love."

557
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:55,449
- I know when you hear it...
- I told you...

558
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:58,084
...l've already selected the song.
It's getting late.

559
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:01,449
I've got a thousand things to do.
I haven't got time to listen to it.

560
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:03,590
I'm a very busy man.
Oh, Joe, Joe, Harry...

561
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,057
...will you show the young lady the door?
I'm very, very busy.

562
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:11,392
You're busy? I'm plugging a song,
keeping house, buying the groceries...

563
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:15,467
...l'm gonna have a baby. Top that.
- Take it easy, boys.

564
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:21,336
We could be sued. All right,
I'll listen to your song, Ms. Kahn.

565
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,538
Mrs. Kahn, if you please.

566
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:27,209
Oh, yes, yes, Mrs. Kahn. I'm sorry.

567
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:32,580
Fred, will you help her out on the piano?
Spotlight.

568
00:39:38,592 --> 00:39:40,856
The one I love

569
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:47,024
Belongs to somebody else

570
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,063
Mr. Harris.

571
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:52,896
I'm listening.
I always listen and walk around.

572
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,240
Not with my husband's songs, you don't.

573
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:58,577
You'll sit right down there
and listen to every word.

574
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:03,774
Oh, I'm sorry. For a minute,
I thought this was my theater.

575
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:07,046
All right, girls, later.

576
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:12,715
Fred, please help the young lady
do her song. Harry, Harry, a chair.

577
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:18,058
The one I love

578
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:23,829
Belongs to somebody else

579
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:28,640
He means his tender songs

580
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:33,746
For somebody else

581
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:37,483
And even when I have

582
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:43,351
My arms around him

583
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,290
I know his thoughts are strong

584
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:51,921
For somebody else

585
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:55,495
The hands I hold

586
00:40:55,669 --> 00:41:01,471
Belong to somebody else

587
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:06,143
I'll bet they're not so cold

588
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:11,114
To somebody else

589
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:17,648
It's tough to be alone on the shelf

590
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:25,190
It's worse to fall in love by yourself

591
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:28,658
The one I love

592
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:35,105
Belongs to somebody else

593
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:41,272
The one I love

594
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:45,144
Belongs

595
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:51,918
To somebody else

596
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:05,605
Lady, you just sold a song.
That's perfect for the first-act finale.

597
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:10,005
- Say, that girl has talent.
- You don't know how much.

598
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:12,771
For an encore, she may have twins.

599
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:39,033
He's a beautiful baby, Mr. Kahn.

600
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:42,466
They all look like that? Where's Grace?

601
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,908
- You like to know how much he weighs?
- Why, who's he fighting?

602
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,809
- Where's Grace?
- Room 708.

603
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,449
Thanks.

604
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,450
- Gracie.
- She's still under the anesthetic.

605
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:58,353
Sweetheart? Hey.

606
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:03,460
Hey. Sweetheart. Hey.

607
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,226
The baby's a big hit. So's the song.

608
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:11,463
Couldn't have managed either of them
without you.

609
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:16,406
Got something for you. Look.

610
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:22,179
Hey. That's for you. Hey, sleepyhead.

611
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:27,847
Take care of yourself, sweetheart.
I love you very much.

612
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:32,182
- Oh, nurse?
- You'll have to leave now.

613
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,021
Do you want me to tell her anything
when she wakes up?

614
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:39,791
Yeah. Tell her I dropped by.
And the kid's all right too.

615
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:03,619
You're nobody's sweetheart now

616
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:07,056
They don't baby you somehow

617
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,923
Fancy hose, silken gown

618
00:44:10,097 --> 00:44:13,225
You'd be out of place
In your own hometown

619
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,494
When you walk down the avenue

620
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,935
I just can't believe that it's you

621
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:23,201
Painted li'I lips
Painted li'I eyes

622
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:26,039
Wearing a bird of paradise.

623
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:29,011
It all seems wrong somehow

624
00:44:29,183 --> 00:44:33,483
That you're nobody's sweetheart now

625
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:51,396
Nights are long since you went away

626
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:58,702
I think about you all through the day

627
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:05,409
My buddy, my buddy

628
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:08,119
Nobody

629
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:13,783
Quite so true

630
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:28,132
Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye
Toot, Toot, Tootsie, don't cry

631
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:33,174
The choo-choo train that
Takes me away from you

632
00:45:33,347 --> 00:45:35,440
No words can tell how sad it makes me

633
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:41,919
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then
I'll do it over again

634
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:45,422
Watch for the mail
I'll never fail

635
00:45:45,592 --> 00:45:48,823
If you don't get a letter
Then you know I'm in jail

636
00:45:49,563 --> 00:45:56,093
Toot, Toot, Tootsie, don't cry
Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye!

637
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:04,302
The armistice, the armistice!
The war's over!

638
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:14,012
Oh, I can't believe it.
Oh, I don't believe it's over.

639
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,918
Oh, I can't believe it.
I can't believe it's over.

640
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:20,582
I'm gonna go and sleep for a month.
No, for a whole year, I'm gonna sleep.

641
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:23,692
I'm gonna go somewhere where there's...

642
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:28,298
Everybody loves a baby
That's why I'm in love with you

643
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:30,403
- Pretty baby
- No.

644
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:32,801
- Pretty baby
- Yes.

645
00:46:32,973 --> 00:46:34,531
Oh, I want a lovin' baby

646
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,302
- And it might as well be you
- Isn't that wonderful?

647
00:46:37,644 --> 00:46:41,740
- Pretty baby of mine
- I wonder which one of us it'll look like.

648
00:46:46,353 --> 00:46:48,981
- Any pains yet?
- No.

649
00:46:49,156 --> 00:46:50,350
What are you doing to me?

650
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:52,890
Six hours, I've been
waiting here in agony.

651
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,221
Gus, you're making yourself
a nervous wreck.

652
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,124
Do something else for a few hours.

653
00:46:57,297 --> 00:46:59,993
Well, I could have my appendix
taken out while I'm waiting.

654
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:03,000
Why don't you go down
and have a drink with the boys, huh?

655
00:47:03,303 --> 00:47:04,463
Well, what about you?

656
00:47:04,638 --> 00:47:06,902
The doctor says the baby
isn't due until midnight.

657
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,103
Doctor says. What, is it coming in
on the Broadway Limited?

658
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:13,735
Will you please do as I say? Honest,
I won't have it till you come back.

659
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:16,680
- Promise?
- Promise.

660
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:23,151
Boy, you don't know
what I've been going through all day.

661
00:47:23,323 --> 00:47:27,020
Gus, as soon as you feel any pains,
hurry back.

662
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,234
Hey, I'm beginning to feel pains.
What time is it?

663
00:47:39,406 --> 00:47:41,772
My watch is worn out.
Why don't you relax?

664
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,569
Who's having this baby, you or me?

665
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:47,646
Gus, listen to the melody again.
Maybe it'll give you an idea.

666
00:47:51,919 --> 00:47:54,615
That's the best tune Isham Jones wrote,
don't you think so?

667
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:58,953
- What time is it?
- Oh, will you listen?

668
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:06,689
That's a good tune.
Yeah, that's a good tune.

669
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:14,464
How do the doctors know?
Could be 10 months, 11.

670
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:19,075
Poor Grace.
How does she get into these things?

671
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:29,589
Anna, are you sure
he hasn't even called?

672
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:32,919
Nope. Are you sure
you're married to him?

673
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:36,119
Come to think of it,
I never have seen the license.

674
00:48:36,697 --> 00:48:39,359
- Anna, I'm worried.
- The main thing is you're all right...

675
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:41,797
...and the baby's all right.

676
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:45,166
I'll go call Fred Townsend again.

677
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:48,769
Well, look who's here.

678
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:51,672
What'd you come up for, take a bow?

679
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:54,542
Honey, I'm sorry.

680
00:48:55,415 --> 00:48:58,316
- I'm sorry.
- Say hello to Irene.

681
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:00,783
Hello, Irene. I'm your father.

682
00:49:00,954 --> 00:49:02,649
Isn't she pretty?

683
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:08,924
Honey, last night, you know,
you told me to go out with the boys...

684
00:49:09,096 --> 00:49:13,430
...and I went over to the club and,
well, I got with Fred...

685
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,037
...and I was really worried about you.
I kept asking every minute what time...

686
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,003
...and then we got on a tune, and...

687
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:22,998
It's all right, Gus.

688
00:49:23,176 --> 00:49:27,272
Well, you know how I am.
I get interested all of a sudden and...

689
00:49:27,748 --> 00:49:30,114
You don't have to explain. I understand.

690
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:32,415
I'm really sorry.

691
00:49:32,586 --> 00:49:35,987
I think we got a good song.
Wanna look at it?

692
00:49:37,524 --> 00:49:40,618
"Why do I do just as you say?

693
00:49:42,029 --> 00:49:46,125
Why must I just give you your way?"

694
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,003
It's so scribbled, I can't read it.

695
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:56,205
Why do I sigh?
Why do I try to forget?

696
00:49:56,810 --> 00:50:00,871
It must have been
that something lovers call fate.

697
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:04,381
That kept on saying I had to wait.

698
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:08,146
I saw them all.

699
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:13,191
Just couldn't fall 'til we met

700
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:21,460
It had to be you
It had to be you

701
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:28,964
I wandered around and finally found
Somebody who

702
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:35,746
Could make me be true
Could make me be blue

703
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:43,182
And even be glad just to be sad
Thinking of you

704
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:51,754
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean

705
00:50:52,265 --> 00:50:56,827
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss

706
00:50:57,003 --> 00:50:59,471
But they wouldn't do

707
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:05,804
Nobody else gave me a thrill

708
00:51:06,413 --> 00:51:12,352
With all your faults, I love you still

709
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:19,450
It had to be you
Wonderful you

710
00:51:20,427 --> 00:51:25,330
It had to be you

711
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,803
By the way, by the way

712
00:51:34,973 --> 00:51:36,031
Take her hand.

713
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:40,804
When we meet the preacher, I'll say

714
00:51:40,979 --> 00:51:45,746
Yes, sir, that's my baby
No, sir, don't mean maybe

715
00:51:45,918 --> 00:51:49,046
Yes, sir, that's my baby now

716
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:55,524
Everybody hand in hand
Swinging down the lane

717
00:51:55,694 --> 00:52:01,633
Everybody feeling grand
Swinging down the lane

718
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:08,296
That's the time I miss the bliss
That we might have known

719
00:52:08,807 --> 00:52:14,746
Nights like this
When I'm all alone

720
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:17,906
Oh, not so hard.

721
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:21,382
You should be very thankful, young lady,
getting a bath every night.

722
00:52:21,553 --> 00:52:23,885
When I was your age,
I got a bath only on Saturday.

723
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:28,220
- Boy, were you lucky.
- Donald, what are you sitting there moping?

724
00:52:28,393 --> 00:52:30,520
Promotion's tomorrow.
You don't know your poem.

725
00:52:30,696 --> 00:52:32,664
- Now, come on, take it from the top.
- Okay.

726
00:52:32,831 --> 00:52:35,664
Ay, tear that tattered ensign down!
That long has waved on high

727
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:38,530
You're reading it like
it's a label on a bottle of ketchup.

728
00:52:38,704 --> 00:52:41,571
Ay, tear her battered ensign down!

729
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,301
And long has it waved on high
On high

730
00:52:45,477 --> 00:52:49,311
And many an eye has danced to see
That banner in the sky;

731
00:52:49,515 --> 00:52:50,573
Who asked you?

732
00:52:50,749 --> 00:52:52,512
I was just helping.

733
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:54,652
Look, I'm big enough
to recite my own poem.

734
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,015
- I'm big enough to take my own bath.
- Shut up.

735
00:52:57,322 --> 00:53:00,553
- That's right. You don't have to soap her.
- Look, I pay all the bills.

736
00:53:00,726 --> 00:53:02,921
Let me make believe
I'm a member of this family.

737
00:53:03,095 --> 00:53:04,289
Telephone, dear.

738
00:53:04,463 --> 00:53:06,556
How do these kids get so dirty?

739
00:53:06,732 --> 00:53:09,064
- It's New York calling. Florenz Ziegfeld.
- Who?

740
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:11,464
- Florenz Ziegfeld.
- Ziegfeld?

741
00:53:11,637 --> 00:53:13,229
- Hello?
- Hello, Gus. This is...

742
00:53:13,405 --> 00:53:14,736
- Hello?
- Giddyup, boy. Come on.

743
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:18,308
Hello, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Yeah, yeah, this is Gus Kahn.

744
00:53:18,477 --> 00:53:20,502
Come on, boy. Giddyup, come on, boy.

745
00:53:20,712 --> 00:53:23,306
Yeah. All right.
You want me to write a show for you?

746
00:53:23,482 --> 00:53:25,450
- Step on it.
- Step on it? Donald, be quiet.

747
00:53:25,617 --> 00:53:26,641
- Get down.
- Giddyup.

748
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:28,150
- Donald, get down.
- Giddyup.

749
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,084
Just a minute, please.
Donald, Donald, I mean it. Get down.

750
00:53:31,256 --> 00:53:33,850
Please stop pestering your father.
He's talking business.

751
00:53:34,026 --> 00:53:35,015
Hello, I'm sorry.

752
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:37,059
Wanna come to New York
and do this show?

753
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:41,165
Well, yes, I'm very flattered, Mr. Ziegfeld,
but why do I have to go to New York?

754
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,461
- I want Daddy to button me.
- Come here, I'll button you.

755
00:53:44,636 --> 00:53:46,831
No, I was talking to my little girl.

756
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:51,704
Look, I have a nice new house here
and my wife likes me around.

757
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:54,869
My kids are very happy.
We're eating three square meals a day.

758
00:53:55,047 --> 00:53:56,639
Are things any better in New York?

759
00:53:56,815 --> 00:54:00,080
- This is the way I've always worked.
- Mr. Ziegfeld, this is Grace Kahn.

760
00:54:00,252 --> 00:54:02,652
- May I ask who's starring in the show?
- Eddie Cantor.

761
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:05,517
- Oh, really? Who's the composer?
- Walter Donaldson.

762
00:54:05,691 --> 00:54:06,919
Gus, it's Walter Donaldson.

763
00:54:07,092 --> 00:54:09,788
I wouldn't care if it was Beethoven
unless he's in Chicago.

764
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:11,691
- Hang up.
- You're impossible.

765
00:54:11,864 --> 00:54:13,832
- Mr. Ziegfeld.
- Who's Ludwig van Beethoven?

766
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:17,696
- A piano player who looked like this:
- I think it's a wonderful idea. Yes, I do.

767
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:19,735
Gus, will you please be quiet?

768
00:54:19,905 --> 00:54:22,100
This is too good a chance
for Gus to miss.

769
00:54:22,274 --> 00:54:23,263
- Will he do it?
- Yes.

770
00:54:23,442 --> 00:54:25,410
- What are you doing?
- He'll be in New York.

771
00:54:25,577 --> 00:54:28,045
- Grace, give me that.
- Fine, we'll consider it closed.

772
00:54:28,213 --> 00:54:29,441
- Honey, I hurt you?
- Mommy.

773
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:32,914
- No, it's all right.
- Anna. Anna. Quick.

774
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:35,019
- What is it? What happened?
- Daddy hit Mama.

775
00:54:35,187 --> 00:54:37,747
- It was an accident.
- Right in the eye.

776
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:40,414
- Dear?
- Oh, go away.

777
00:54:40,592 --> 00:54:43,356
I was trying to help him,
but he insists on being a problem.

778
00:54:43,528 --> 00:54:44,620
And he struck you?

779
00:54:44,796 --> 00:54:47,094
Ziegfeld offered him a show
and he turned it down.

780
00:54:47,266 --> 00:54:48,528
- Please.
- He turned it down?

781
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,794
Please, let me make one decision.

782
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:56,100
All right, make it. Stay in Chicago
and be a big frog in a little puddle.

783
00:54:56,275 --> 00:54:58,641
A man with your talent.
You should be ashamed.

784
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:01,608
- Grace.
- It would be so good for you to go away.

785
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,681
A whole new life.
Different people, different environment.

786
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:07,216
- And different women?
- You're not the type.

787
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,645
Not the type.

788
00:55:09,655 --> 00:55:12,988
Someday, I'm gonna meet a girl
who'll let me win an argument just once.

789
00:55:13,158 --> 00:55:14,386
And you watch out.

790
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,824
I pity the poor girl.
Come on, children, I'll put you to bed.

791
00:55:17,996 --> 00:55:20,931
Now, just a minute.
I put them to bed every night.

792
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:22,999
Get into the kitchen,
check your cookbook.

793
00:55:23,168 --> 00:55:27,969
- Your potato pancakes tonight were terrible.
- I suppose all your songs are hits.

794
00:55:28,373 --> 00:55:31,103
- lf he starts anything, holler.
- We will.

795
00:55:31,276 --> 00:55:34,006
Anna, let's start packing
Mr. Kahn's things.

796
00:55:35,614 --> 00:55:37,377
Thanks for everything, dear God.

797
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:39,710
And please forgive Daddy
for hitting Mommy.

798
00:55:39,885 --> 00:55:43,343
- Right in the eye.
- It was an accident.

799
00:55:43,522 --> 00:55:44,989
You get this through your heads.

800
00:55:45,157 --> 00:55:47,557
I wouldn't hit your mother,
no matter what happened.

801
00:55:47,726 --> 00:55:51,526
- I happen to love Mama very much.
- You never tell her you love her.

802
00:55:51,697 --> 00:55:54,097
You two. Come on. I'll tuck you in bed.

803
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:57,200
I can get in myself, thank you.

804
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:00,770
- Donald?
- Good night.

805
00:56:00,973 --> 00:56:02,406
Good night.

806
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,937
Good night.

807
00:56:07,946 --> 00:56:09,311
Honest to goodness, kids.

808
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:12,575
There's nobody in the world
that means more to me than your mother.

809
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:15,845
- It's all right, Daddy.
- We understand.

810
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:20,424
- It was an accident when you hit her.
- Right in the eye.

811
00:56:41,346 --> 00:56:43,314
Is this Walter Donaldson's apartment?

812
00:56:43,482 --> 00:56:46,918
- Go home. The party's over.
- Oh, I'm Gus Kahn.

813
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,318
You're kidding. Come in.

814
00:56:58,663 --> 00:57:02,121
Ought to be a better way
of starting the day than waking up.

815
00:57:03,702 --> 00:57:07,001
Should have seen this place
before the maid tidied it up.

816
00:57:07,372 --> 00:57:11,433
- Sit down. Had breakfast?
- Had lunch.

817
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:16,707
Oh, one of those.
Pardon me while I fix myself something.

818
00:57:18,717 --> 00:57:22,676
My grandfather had a bottle of beer
for breakfast every day of his life.

819
00:57:22,854 --> 00:57:25,414
Lived to the ripe old age of 28.

820
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,319
Very funny.

821
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:30,325
Hope we don't start work every day
at 1:00 in the afternoon...

822
00:57:30,495 --> 00:57:33,259
...with a stale glass of beer
and a joke to match.

823
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:39,563
If you're the eager-beaver type, I got a tune
you can start working on right now.

824
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:45,476
- Mind if I get dressed?
- lf you can handle it.

825
00:57:46,745 --> 00:57:50,738
Well, this is gonna be
a beautiful collaboration, isn't it?

826
00:58:10,268 --> 00:58:11,565
You don't like me.

827
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:21,576
- Hello.
- Hello.

828
00:58:21,746 --> 00:58:24,544
- You here from last night?
- No, from this afternoon.

829
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:28,513
Well, party's starting early today,
isn't it?

830
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:32,214
- Walter.
- Wait, you can't go in there. He's dressing.

831
00:58:32,924 --> 00:58:36,155
- Are you from out of town or something?
- That you, Frankie?

832
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:40,326
Yeah, honey.
I'll wait out here with your scoutmaster.

833
00:58:40,832 --> 00:58:44,825
That's Gus Kahn from Chicago.
He's the bard of the Corn Belt.

834
00:58:45,003 --> 00:58:46,868
Introduce yourself.

835
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,672
Frankie Mason.

836
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:55,742
Kiss it or shake it.
I don't know what goes in Chicago.

837
00:58:58,884 --> 00:59:01,409
I haven't got much time.
Got an important appointment.

838
00:59:01,586 --> 00:59:03,884
- Can I say something?
- No.

839
00:59:04,356 --> 00:59:07,553
- I thought we were gonna work.
- She'll hum you the tune on the way.

840
00:59:07,726 --> 00:59:09,694
- Come on. She knows it by heart.
- I gotta...

841
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:12,762
Just shut your eyes, honey,
and let it happen.

842
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:49,097
You and your jockey friends.

843
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:52,600
Maybe it was the other jockey.
They're all the same size.

844
00:59:52,904 --> 00:59:55,498
- Here, this ought to help you get even.
- I'm not hungry.

845
00:59:55,674 --> 00:59:57,574
On the back, on the back.

846
00:59:57,809 --> 00:59:59,572
- Sam?
- Yeah?

847
00:59:59,744 --> 01:00:02,372
- Put this on Our Fancy.
- On the nose?

848
01:00:02,547 --> 01:00:05,311
- Where else?
- Okay.

849
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:09,385
It's sort of a going-away present.
I'm leaving.

850
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:13,079
Bye, Frankie.
You better practice those two notes.

851
01:00:13,258 --> 01:00:17,661
Hey, Gus. Wait a minute.
Gus, this is it. I can't let you go now.

852
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:20,821
I've been looking for a partner
who could work at the track.

853
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:22,899
Well, get yourself a horse with a pencil.

854
01:00:23,068 --> 01:00:26,003
No, no. You're not gonna let
a little thing...

855
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:28,833
...like the fact that we hate each other
stand in our way?

856
01:00:29,007 --> 01:00:31,066
This is a business arrangement.
How about it?

857
01:00:31,243 --> 01:00:36,704
Look, in Chicago, composers have a very
quaint custom of working indoors at a piano.

858
01:00:36,881 --> 01:00:41,648
Well, it sounds radical,
but for you, I'll give it a go. Deal?

859
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,109
You're crazy.

860
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:55,024
Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina in the morning

861
01:00:55,533 --> 01:00:58,832
No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her

862
01:00:59,004 --> 01:01:02,405
In the morning

863
01:01:02,574 --> 01:01:09,173
Where the morning glories
Twine around the door

864
01:01:09,381 --> 01:01:15,843
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more

865
01:01:16,288 --> 01:01:19,451
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early

866
01:01:19,624 --> 01:01:23,321
In the morning

867
01:01:23,495 --> 01:01:30,059
Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup at dawning

868
01:01:30,402 --> 01:01:34,168
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day

869
01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:37,968
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

870
01:01:38,143 --> 01:01:41,408
Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina

871
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:45,709
In the morning

872
01:01:45,884 --> 01:01:48,250
Let's go, kids. On your feet.

873
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,878
What kind of a cockamamie lyric
is "mo-ho-ho-rning"?

874
01:01:52,057 --> 01:01:54,992
Well, it fits the "no-ho-ho-hotes,"
doesn't it?

875
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,687
- I'm not doing this song.
- The queen has spoken.

876
01:01:59,431 --> 01:02:01,456
Now, now, let's not lose our tempers.

877
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:05,569
My kind of audience isn't paying 6.60
to see a butterfly kiss a buttercup.

878
01:02:05,737 --> 01:02:08,797
Only Jolson can get by
with a number like that.

879
01:02:08,973 --> 01:02:11,635
When I go down on one knee,
I lose half my charm.

880
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,443
- Can I say something?
- No.

881
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:15,476
Butterflies, buttercup.

882
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:20,311
Honestly, Ziggie, are you going in
for minstrel shows, after all these years?

883
01:02:20,485 --> 01:02:23,545
Gloria's right. This doesn't sound
like her type of material.

884
01:02:23,722 --> 01:02:26,919
No wonder.
She sang it with her clothes on.

885
01:02:27,192 --> 01:02:28,853
Well, I have a dinner engagement.

886
01:02:29,027 --> 01:02:32,622
- I do hope you boys don't mind if I leave.
- It'd be a pleasure.

887
01:02:32,797 --> 01:02:35,129
Welcome to Broadway, Gus.

888
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:39,898
Cockamamie, indeed. Come on, Gus.
We'll talk it over down at the...

889
01:02:40,071 --> 01:02:42,835
Please, please.
All I want is a one-way ticket to Chicago.

890
01:02:43,007 --> 01:02:46,374
Relax. You and Walter can come up
with something much more sophisticated.

891
01:02:46,544 --> 01:02:50,344
I'm sorry, Mr. Ziegfeld,
but New York is just too big a town for me.

892
01:02:52,283 --> 01:02:54,547
Never get another lyric-writer like him.

893
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,416
Wrote the first chorus in 135
and three-fifths on a slow track.

894
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:01,821
- Now can I say something?
- Yeah.

895
01:03:01,993 --> 01:03:04,587
- I liked it.
- She liked it. We're in.

896
01:03:04,763 --> 01:03:09,427
From the top, kids. One, two.
One, two, three, four.

897
01:03:10,935 --> 01:03:12,926
I've been waiting for you.

898
01:03:13,104 --> 01:03:16,437
- What do you want, your knife back?
- Don't run away, Gus.

899
01:03:16,608 --> 01:03:18,769
I wanted to let you in on the facts of life.

900
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:20,376
I may scream.

901
01:03:20,545 --> 01:03:23,343
I happen to be the leading lady
in the new Ziegfeld show.

902
01:03:23,515 --> 01:03:27,451
So my material has got to be great.
That's why I fight so hard.

903
01:03:27,619 --> 01:03:30,486
Yeah, get yourself a new sparring partner.
I'm on my way home.

904
01:03:30,655 --> 01:03:35,786
I want you. I think you're about
the best lyricist there is.

905
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,554
In the butterfly-and-buttercup set,
you mean.

906
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:45,329
Exactly. But you're on Broadway now.
There isn't a morning glory for 15 miles.

907
01:03:45,503 --> 01:03:47,698
You have to write
something sophisticated.

908
01:03:47,872 --> 01:03:52,275
And you can do it, once someone
teaches you the meaning of the word.

909
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:57,075
- You applying for the job?
- lf it's open.

910
01:03:57,916 --> 01:04:01,682
It's funny, you know.
Someone once told me I wasn't the type.

911
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:07,591
- I'd be too much trouble for you.
- No, you have a talent that can help me.

912
01:04:07,759 --> 01:04:10,353
Nothing would be too much trouble.

913
01:04:11,162 --> 01:04:14,996
- Coming with me?
- Thought you had a dinner date.

914
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:18,161
I thought you were going to Chicago.

915
01:04:30,915 --> 01:04:33,110
- Hello?
- Long-distance call.

916
01:04:33,284 --> 01:04:35,252
This is Mrs. Kahn.

917
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,551
Who's calling?

918
01:04:37,956 --> 01:04:39,753
Oh, New York.

919
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,887
What is it? Who's ringing the phone
at 3:00 in the morning?

920
01:04:43,061 --> 01:04:46,963
It's Gus calling from New York.
I hope everything's all right. Hello?

921
01:04:50,735 --> 01:04:53,602
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

922
01:04:53,771 --> 01:04:55,636
- Is Mr. Kahn there?
- Who?

923
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:00,141
- Gus Kahn.
- Oh, just a moment.

924
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:04,874
Gus. Gus, baby. Your call to Chicago.

925
01:05:05,049 --> 01:05:07,074
Go on, go to bed.

926
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:10,779
Could you hold it down a little bit?
Could you be a little quiet?

927
01:05:10,955 --> 01:05:12,286
- Hello, Gus?
- Grace.

928
01:05:12,457 --> 01:05:14,220
- What's the matter?
- I had to call you.

929
01:05:14,392 --> 01:05:17,520
I pinned the Irishman down long enough
to finish most of the score.

930
01:05:17,695 --> 01:05:20,459
- Did you call me for that?
- I thought you'd like to hear it.

931
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:22,998
- It's 3:00 in the morning.
- It's 3:00 in Chicago.

932
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:26,830
Well, tell her it's 4:00 here.
A wonderful invention, the telephone.

933
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:28,632
Well, it's worth staying awake for.

934
01:05:28,806 --> 01:05:30,171
- Gloria's gonna sing.
- Who?

935
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:32,104
- Gloria Knight.
- Who's Gloria Knight?

936
01:05:32,277 --> 01:05:35,075
- Didn't I write to you about her?
- You haven't written to me.

937
01:05:35,246 --> 01:05:38,773
Well, when I was gonna write,
I was gonna tell you about her. Listen.

938
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:40,306
Mrs. Kahn?

939
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:43,519
I just want you to know
you have a wonderful husband.

940
01:05:43,688 --> 01:05:46,919
And he's written a beautiful song for me.
Play, Walter.

941
01:05:47,926 --> 01:05:50,486
- She's gonna love this.
- Yeah.

942
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:59,400
Love me or leave me
And let me be lonely

943
01:05:59,571 --> 01:06:04,372
You won't believe me
And I love you only

944
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:11,038
I'd rather be lonely than happy
With somebody else

945
01:06:13,985 --> 01:06:16,453
- You might find the nighttime
- "Love me or leave me"?

946
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:19,112
The right time for kissing

947
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:24,023
But nighttime is my time
For just reminiscing

948
01:06:24,195 --> 01:06:30,794
Regretting instead of forgetting
With somebody else

949
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:39,469
There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you

950
01:06:41,045 --> 01:06:47,644
I intend to be independently blue

951
01:06:50,288 --> 01:06:55,225
I want your love
But I don't want to borrow

952
01:06:55,393 --> 01:07:00,387
To have it today
And give back tomorrow

953
01:07:00,732 --> 01:07:04,259
For my love is your love

954
01:07:04,902 --> 01:07:11,501
There's no love for nobody else

955
01:07:17,048 --> 01:07:19,949
You ever think your husband
could write something like that?

956
01:07:20,118 --> 01:07:22,586
No, I didn't, baby.

957
01:07:22,754 --> 01:07:26,815
It's a whole new life here in New York.
You were right. It's just what I needed.

958
01:07:27,692 --> 01:07:31,287
- How are the kids?
- "How are the kids"?

959
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,729
Donald recited "Old Ironsides" at school
and the teacher said...

960
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,334
Hello? Gu...?

961
01:07:59,991 --> 01:08:03,791
Love me or leave me
And let me be lonely

962
01:08:03,961 --> 01:08:07,954
You won't believe me
And I love you only

963
01:08:08,132 --> 01:08:14,662
I'd rather be lonely than happy
With somebody else

964
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:20,508
You might find the nighttime
The right time for kissing

965
01:08:20,678 --> 01:08:24,637
But nighttime is my time
For just reminiscing

966
01:08:24,816 --> 01:08:27,842
- Thanks, honey.
- Regretting instead of forgetting

967
01:08:28,019 --> 01:08:32,115
- With somebody else
- Grace.

968
01:08:32,557 --> 01:08:35,549
I come 800 miles and that's all I get?

969
01:08:35,727 --> 01:08:39,527
- Hey, Gus, who's the new blond?
- Does Gloria know about this?

970
01:08:39,697 --> 01:08:41,028
This is my wife.

971
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:43,599
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

972
01:08:43,768 --> 01:08:46,134
- Bigmouth.
- Well, I didn't say anything.

973
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:48,935
Honey, you know
how those chorus girls are.

974
01:08:49,107 --> 01:08:50,096
How are they, Gus?

975
01:08:50,274 --> 01:08:53,971
I want your love
But I don't want to borrow

976
01:08:54,145 --> 01:08:58,013
To have it today
And give back tomorrow

977
01:08:58,182 --> 01:09:00,616
For my love is your love

978
01:09:00,785 --> 01:09:05,154
There's no love for nobody else

979
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,133
That's Gloria Knight,
the girl who sang to you over the phone.

980
01:09:19,303 --> 01:09:21,498
I had to be nice to her...

981
01:09:21,672 --> 01:09:25,938
...because you don't know how hard it was
for us to get her to do our numbers.

982
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:29,511
And she's a very big singer.
She could be a big help to me. Us.

983
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,841
Oh, I understand.

984
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,675
You do?

985
01:09:35,787 --> 01:09:37,755
That why you came
all the way from Chicago?

986
01:09:37,922 --> 01:09:40,652
- Don't be silly.
- I don't think it's being silly.

987
01:09:40,825 --> 01:09:43,157
After all, I don't blame you for worrying.

988
01:09:43,327 --> 01:09:46,524
Here I am in New York,
all alone, and different people...

989
01:09:46,697 --> 01:09:52,226
Gus, please. I wasn't worried at all.
I just came to see the show, that's all.

990
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:58,534
What am I, Jojo the Dog Face Boy
or Peter the Hermit?

991
01:09:58,709 --> 01:10:01,872
Don't you think it's possible
a pretty girl could make a pass at me?

992
01:10:02,046 --> 01:10:07,848
It's possible. But she wouldn't have
gotten anyplace. Not with my Gus.

993
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:23,532
- Gus, darling, the hook.
- Again?

994
01:10:23,701 --> 01:10:26,101
This thing comes open
at the strangest times.

995
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:28,864
- Remember that night in Pittsburgh?
- Oh, don't remind me.

996
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,237
I thought I had it all fastened.
What a second-act curtain.

997
01:10:35,346 --> 01:10:38,008
Oh, by the way, Gloria, this is my wife.

998
01:10:38,549 --> 01:10:39,811
How do you do, Ms. Knight?

999
01:10:39,984 --> 01:10:42,953
Well, Mrs. Kahn. I'm so sorry.

1000
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,213
We've spoken over the telephone,
haven't we?

1001
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:47,983
No. No, I just sort of listened.

1002
01:10:50,428 --> 01:10:52,123
I better put on my winter underwear.

1003
01:10:52,296 --> 01:10:55,356
- Gus, you're wanted out front. Ziggie.
- Thanks.

1004
01:10:55,533 --> 01:10:59,526
That means Ziegfeld.
You'd be surprised how much I've learned.

1005
01:10:59,704 --> 01:11:03,572
You wait right here, young lady.
I gotta talk to you.

1006
01:11:08,112 --> 01:11:11,377
- Mrs. Kahn.
- Yes?

1007
01:11:11,549 --> 01:11:13,744
Will you come in for a second?

1008
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,586
Won't you take off your boxing gloves
and sit down?

1009
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:27,722
Thank you.

1010
01:11:30,801 --> 01:11:33,235
You know,
this is a new experience for me.

1011
01:11:33,404 --> 01:11:36,862
I've never talked to another man's wife
without a lawyer in the room.

1012
01:11:37,842 --> 01:11:43,542
- What is there to talk about?
- Don Juan out there, with the cigars.

1013
01:11:43,948 --> 01:11:46,678
He's putting on a big act
for your benefit.

1014
01:11:46,851 --> 01:11:49,285
And I'm not going
to let him get away with it.

1015
01:11:49,453 --> 01:11:52,422
- Is it an act?
- I never hide my conquests, darling.

1016
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,057
Only my defeats.

1017
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:56,489
And believe me,
this time, I was shut out.

1018
01:11:57,795 --> 01:12:00,229
At first, it was strictly business.

1019
01:12:00,464 --> 01:12:03,228
All of a sudden, I found myself
falling for that sad-eyed...

1020
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:05,096
...old hound of a husband of yours.

1021
01:12:05,269 --> 01:12:07,464
So I tried to get into the Kennel Club.

1022
01:12:09,173 --> 01:12:11,368
Would you mind telling me
what happened?

1023
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:12,566
Nothing.

1024
01:12:13,077 --> 01:12:16,308
Absolutely, positively
and humiliatingly nothing.

1025
01:12:17,214 --> 01:12:20,047
It was almost enough
to make a girl wonder if she was...

1026
01:12:20,551 --> 01:12:22,917
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

1027
01:12:23,087 --> 01:12:25,749
Do you know how many times
he showed me pictures of you...

1028
01:12:25,923 --> 01:12:27,686
...little Donald and little Irene?

1029
01:12:27,858 --> 01:12:30,952
Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!

1030
01:12:31,662 --> 01:12:33,857
After a while, I got to hate those kids.

1031
01:12:34,031 --> 01:12:37,296
They were a symbol of something
that I'd never achieve.

1032
01:12:37,735 --> 01:12:40,101
And how he talked
about the way you play the piano.

1033
01:12:41,105 --> 01:12:43,938
You must play a wonderful piano,
Mrs. Kahn.

1034
01:12:48,946 --> 01:12:51,506
Thank you for being so honest,
Ms. Knight.

1035
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:55,952
But if I ever catch you with him again,
I'm gonna scratch your eyes out.

1036
01:12:59,357 --> 01:13:00,790
Bye.

1037
01:13:11,969 --> 01:13:14,199
- What was that for?
- That's for nothing.

1038
01:13:14,372 --> 01:13:18,001
Absolutely, positively
and humiliatingly nothing.

1039
01:13:27,752 --> 01:13:31,483
Another bride, another June

1040
01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:35,455
Another sunny honeymoon

1041
01:13:35,626 --> 01:13:40,222
Another season, another reason
For makin'

1042
01:13:40,698 --> 01:13:42,097
Whoopee

1043
01:13:43,601 --> 01:13:47,401
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice

1044
01:13:47,571 --> 01:13:51,098
The groom is nervous
He answers twice

1045
01:13:51,275 --> 01:13:55,974
It's really killing that he's so willing

1046
01:13:56,781 --> 01:13:58,009
Whoopee

1047
01:14:00,284 --> 01:14:04,118
Picture a little love nest

1048
01:14:04,288 --> 01:14:07,280
Down where the roses cling

1049
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:11,917
And picture the same sweet love nest

1050
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:15,426
What a year can bring

1051
01:14:15,599 --> 01:14:19,330
He's washing dishes and baby clothes

1052
01:14:19,503 --> 01:14:23,337
He's so ambitious, he even sews

1053
01:14:23,507 --> 01:14:27,534
So don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks

1054
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:30,703
- For makin' whoopee
- For makin' whoopee

1055
01:14:31,782 --> 01:14:35,445
Another year, or maybe less

1056
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:39,453
- What's this I hear?
- Well, can't you guess?

1057
01:14:39,623 --> 01:14:45,892
She feels neglected
And he's suspected of makin' whoopee

1058
01:14:46,063 --> 01:14:47,496
Shot with my own words.

1059
01:14:47,665 --> 01:14:51,499
She sits alone most every night

1060
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:54,866
He doesn't phone
He doesn't write

1061
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:56,097
I was busy.

1062
01:14:56,273 --> 01:14:57,535
He says he's busy

1063
01:14:57,708 --> 01:15:01,735
But she says, "Is he?"
He's makin' whoopee

1064
01:15:01,912 --> 01:15:04,506
- I have to work, don't I?
- That's work?

1065
01:15:04,682 --> 01:15:11,281
He doesn't make much money
Only 5000 per

1066
01:15:12,323 --> 01:15:16,123
Some judge who thinks he's funny

1067
01:15:16,293 --> 01:15:19,228
Says, "You pay 6 to her"

1068
01:15:19,597 --> 01:15:23,533
And then I say, "Judge, suppose I fail?"

1069
01:15:23,701 --> 01:15:27,660
The judge says, "Budge right into jail"

1070
01:15:27,838 --> 01:15:31,535
- You better keep her
- I think it's cheaper

1071
01:15:31,709 --> 01:15:35,167
- Than makin' whoopee
- Than makin' whoopee

1072
01:15:36,647 --> 01:15:40,674
- Come in.
- Aren't you folks gonna have supper?

1073
01:15:41,552 --> 01:15:47,548
- We're makin' whoopee
- We're makin' whoopee

1074
01:16:07,344 --> 01:16:10,745
No, no, Nora
Nobody but you, dear

1075
01:16:10,915 --> 01:16:14,476
You know, Nora
Yours truly is true, dear

1076
01:16:14,652 --> 01:16:17,815
And would I trade you for Venus?

1077
01:16:17,988 --> 01:16:20,286
No, no, Nora, no, no!

1078
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:26,828
I saw your eyes
Your wonderful eyes

1079
01:16:27,364 --> 01:16:33,963
My heart has taught me their meaning

1080
01:16:45,015 --> 01:16:50,578
If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you

1081
01:16:50,754 --> 01:16:56,715
If you like to linger where it's shady
Ukulele Lady linger too

1082
01:16:56,894 --> 01:17:01,524
If you kiss Ukulele Lady
While you promise ever to be true

1083
01:17:01,699 --> 01:17:03,564
Gus, been looking all over for you.

1084
01:17:03,734 --> 01:17:05,167
- Wonderful party.
- Thanks, Fred.

1085
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:07,634
I can't stay.
My train leaves in half an hour.

1086
01:17:07,805 --> 01:17:10,035
I hate to see you go,
but good luck in Hollywood.

1087
01:17:10,207 --> 01:17:12,869
Everybody's moving out there
since pictures began to talk.

1088
01:17:13,043 --> 01:17:16,240
- Why don't you get in on the act?
- I can't get this house on a train.

1089
01:17:16,413 --> 01:17:18,540
- Even Donaldson's coming West.
- Yeah?

1090
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:20,843
I gave him an advance
on your new number.

1091
01:17:21,018 --> 01:17:22,212
Our new number?

1092
01:17:22,386 --> 01:17:26,516
Yeah, you know, the Italian-type song.
You said you were nuts about it.

1093
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:29,682
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The Italian-type song. Yeah.

1094
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:33,318
- Bye.
- So long. Take care.

1095
01:17:33,497 --> 01:17:36,864
If you like Ukulele Lady

1096
01:17:37,134 --> 01:17:39,728
Ukulele Lady like a'you

1097
01:17:41,005 --> 01:17:43,405
I still don't like it.

1098
01:17:46,377 --> 01:17:47,366
Oh, Walter.

1099
01:17:47,544 --> 01:17:50,274
Surprised to see so much liquor
in your house. How come?

1100
01:17:50,447 --> 01:17:53,678
- Expecting to be bit by a snake?
- I have been.

1101
01:17:54,118 --> 01:17:58,452
Come here.
What's the Italian-type number?

1102
01:17:58,622 --> 01:18:01,523
- Oh, the Italian number.
- Yeah.

1103
01:18:01,692 --> 01:18:04,024
You weren't to know
until I got to Hollywood.

1104
01:18:04,194 --> 01:18:07,186
You took an advance from Fred
on a number I never agreed to.

1105
01:18:07,398 --> 01:18:09,764
If you needed money,
all you had to do was ask me.

1106
01:18:09,933 --> 01:18:12,333
Well, I didn't wanna be
beholden to you, chief.

1107
01:18:12,503 --> 01:18:14,630
You're getting to be such a big man now.

1108
01:18:14,805 --> 01:18:16,466
How do you know I'll like this tune?

1109
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,471
My tunes were good enough
for you once.

1110
01:18:18,642 --> 01:18:20,269
Just put the words to it.

1111
01:18:20,444 --> 01:18:22,537
I never write up anything
I don't believe in.

1112
01:18:22,713 --> 01:18:24,704
Is that statement for me or for posterity?

1113
01:18:24,882 --> 01:18:28,079
You could at least have let me hear the tune
and decide if I like it.

1114
01:18:28,252 --> 01:18:30,982
Decide, Gus? Who decides,
you or Grace?

1115
01:18:31,155 --> 01:18:33,623
Since you've been with Isham Jones
and Dick Whiting...

1116
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:35,952
...did she tell you to
get rid of little Walter?

1117
01:18:36,126 --> 01:18:39,254
I've taken an awful lot from you.
I've had to follow you around...

1118
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:42,228
...waiting for you to get in the mood
to sit down at a piano.

1119
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:44,924
Many a time, I had to prop you up
when I got you there.

1120
01:18:45,102 --> 01:18:48,799
Now, I'm not asking for gratitude,
but keep my wife out of this.

1121
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:53,073
As a matter of fact, it's a very good idea
if we quit working together.

1122
01:18:53,243 --> 01:18:56,212
Well, thank you and good afternoon,
Mr. Grace Kahn.

1123
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:58,610
Why don't you take a walk
and sober up?

1124
01:18:58,782 --> 01:19:02,582
Yeah, why don't you get a drink
and get her to give you back your pants?

1125
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:36,386
Well, I see by the tracks
Papa Bear has come home.

1126
01:19:36,553 --> 01:19:40,148
Is she still here? Why do you think
I stayed out half the night?

1127
01:19:40,324 --> 01:19:43,088
- Why didn't you tell her?
- You don't get rid of me so easy.

1128
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,285
I explained to her
we couldn't afford a maid.

1129
01:19:45,462 --> 01:19:48,260
Do you think anybody who could
afford a maid would hire me...

1130
01:19:48,432 --> 01:19:50,059
...an old party with lumbago?

1131
01:19:50,534 --> 01:19:55,164
Anna, you know how things have been.
I haven't even paid you for three months.

1132
01:19:55,372 --> 01:20:00,309
This isn't the kind of job you take
for money. It's like being in the Army.

1133
01:20:00,477 --> 01:20:02,274
You'll owe me.

1134
01:20:03,547 --> 01:20:07,506
All right, if you're gonna stay,
you're gonna stay. Where's my supper?

1135
01:20:07,684 --> 01:20:10,653
If you came home at a decent hour,
you'd have it with the family.

1136
01:20:10,821 --> 01:20:13,654
- I don't cook three times a night.
- What?

1137
01:20:14,892 --> 01:20:17,486
It's on the kitchen table, waiting.

1138
01:20:19,863 --> 01:20:23,060
Gus. Gus, why don't you call
Fred Townsend?

1139
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:24,530
What for?

1140
01:20:24,701 --> 01:20:26,794
Maybe he could get you
something in Hollywood.

1141
01:20:27,504 --> 01:20:29,472
Honey, I don't go begging for favors.

1142
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,507
If Fred wants me,
he knows where he can find me.

1143
01:20:55,933 --> 01:20:59,767
Well, I thought it over.
I'll do it. Ten dollars apiece.

1144
01:20:59,937 --> 01:21:02,531
I thought it over too. Three for 25.

1145
01:21:02,706 --> 01:21:05,539
- All right, in advance.
- Okay.

1146
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:07,301
Here's for six.

1147
01:21:07,478 --> 01:21:11,608
Hey, you think you could write
a song for that tall dame?

1148
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:13,638
I guess so.

1149
01:21:13,817 --> 01:21:18,481
Okay. Now, get out of here, genius.
People think I write this stuff myself.

1150
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:23,486
Gus, I've been so worried about you.

1151
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,491
- Did I awaken you?
- Where have you been?

1152
01:21:25,662 --> 01:21:30,224
I was downtown. I ran into a few guys
who really appreciate my work.

1153
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,868
- What are you doing?
- Writing lyrics.

1154
01:21:33,036 --> 01:21:37,973
Nothing could be finer than to give
The guy a shiner in the first round

1155
01:21:38,141 --> 01:21:41,269
- What kind of a lyric is that?
- It's a parody.

1156
01:21:41,445 --> 01:21:43,379
But you're making fun
of your own songs.

1157
01:21:43,547 --> 01:21:46,778
Well, who has a better right?
And $ 10 a funny.

1158
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:48,975
Oh, I got one I want you to hear.

1159
01:21:49,152 --> 01:21:52,713
This one I think is really cute.
Come here. Listen to this.

1160
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:54,687
Two fellas go out on a blind date, see.

1161
01:21:54,858 --> 01:21:57,793
And this one guy gets a girl named Betty.
Sit down, sit down.

1162
01:21:57,961 --> 01:22:01,590
I planned the name Betty
because it's got a silly rhyme.

1163
01:22:01,765 --> 01:22:06,361
Anyhow, the minute he takes a look
at this girl, this is what he says:

1164
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:13,632
It had to be me
That had to get you

1165
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:17,371
I stand 5-foot- 10
A man among men

1166
01:22:17,548 --> 01:22:19,641
But you're 7'2"

1167
01:22:20,651 --> 01:22:26,112
I meet lots of girls
When I make the rounds

1168
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:31,592
But none are like you
Seven-foot-two, 70 pounds

1169
01:22:32,996 --> 01:22:37,456
But you make me thrill
And you always will

1170
01:22:38,936 --> 01:22:42,599
I realize, Betty
You look like spaghetti

1171
01:22:42,773 --> 01:22:45,742
But what can I do?

1172
01:22:45,909 --> 01:22:49,709
It's your fingertips
That I adore

1173
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,611
When you stand up
They touch the floor

1174
01:22:53,784 --> 01:22:58,244
It had to be you, wonderful you

1175
01:22:58,422 --> 01:23:01,323
Seven-foot-two

1176
01:23:04,161 --> 01:23:06,152
Don't you think that's funny?

1177
01:23:06,797 --> 01:23:08,788
You better get some sleep.

1178
01:23:23,113 --> 01:23:26,310
- Number, please.
- Long distance, please.

1179
01:23:26,984 --> 01:23:29,384
- Hello. Yes, ma'am.
- Hello?

1180
01:23:29,553 --> 01:23:31,885
Hello, I'd like to place
a person-to-person call...

1181
01:23:32,055 --> 01:23:34,785
...to Fred Townsend
in Hollywood, California.

1182
01:23:37,494 --> 01:23:41,897
Hello? Who? Oh, just a minute.

1183
01:23:48,038 --> 01:23:51,838
When the concert's over,
there's a phone call for you, long distance.

1184
01:23:52,009 --> 01:23:54,136
Long distance.
I wonder who that could be.

1185
01:23:54,311 --> 01:23:56,871
- Where's it from?
- Hollywood.

1186
01:23:57,047 --> 01:24:00,380
Maybe Rin Tin Tin
needs a new theme song.

1187
01:24:01,718 --> 01:24:05,279
- Hollywood? Hello?
- Hello, Gus, Fred Townsend.

1188
01:24:05,455 --> 01:24:06,820
- Hello, Fred.
- Merry Christmas.

1189
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:08,389
Merry Christmas to you too.

1190
01:24:08,558 --> 01:24:10,458
- Honey, it's Fred.
- Merry Christmas, Fred.

1191
01:24:10,627 --> 01:24:12,094
- Grace is fine?
- Yes, she's fine.

1192
01:24:12,262 --> 01:24:13,923
- How about the kids?
- We're all fine.

1193
01:24:14,097 --> 01:24:18,158
Good. I wonder if you'd be interested
in doing a picture.

1194
01:24:18,969 --> 01:24:23,030
Well, I don't know, Fred.
I'm kept pretty busy here.

1195
01:24:23,206 --> 01:24:25,731
They want me in Hollywood.
Fred's got a picture for me.

1196
01:24:25,909 --> 01:24:27,342
Oh, Gus.

1197
01:24:27,511 --> 01:24:32,414
Yeah. Yeah, well, as a favor to you,
Fred, I'd do it, sure, but...

1198
01:24:32,582 --> 01:24:36,609
- The money's very good.
- All right. All right. You got a deal.

1199
01:24:36,787 --> 01:24:38,152
- See you in a week.
- Goodbye.

1200
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:39,583
- Goodbye.
- That's wonderful.

1201
01:24:39,756 --> 01:24:41,656
- Where are my cigars?
- Get him a cigar.

1202
01:24:42,526 --> 01:24:45,689
- Think the whole family could go out?
- I wouldn't go without you.

1203
01:24:45,862 --> 01:24:47,796
Did he say anything
about transportation?

1204
01:24:47,964 --> 01:24:50,694
- No.
- Well, who's gonna pay for the tickets?

1205
01:24:50,867 --> 01:24:54,064
- You should have asked him that.
- Oh, honey, I couldn't do that.

1206
01:24:54,237 --> 01:24:57,035
We have to put up a front.
We'll hit somebody for a loan.

1207
01:24:57,207 --> 01:25:00,335
Who? Everybody in Chicago's broke.

1208
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:02,637
How about Bert? Bert Van Alstyne.

1209
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:04,804
- He's in New York.
- Here.

1210
01:25:05,782 --> 01:25:09,445
- What's that?
- It's from not playing the stock market.

1211
01:25:09,619 --> 01:25:11,382
- Annie.
- Oh, no.

1212
01:25:11,555 --> 01:25:17,323
Go on, take it. Who else would
loan money to a songwriter?

1213
01:25:17,494 --> 01:25:19,962
And get me a lower berth.

1214
01:25:20,363 --> 01:25:22,854
- Anna...
- Hey, are we going somewhere?

1215
01:25:23,033 --> 01:25:24,364
Where are we going?

1216
01:25:24,534 --> 01:25:28,026
You missed it. Daddy was talking
to Uncle Fred all the way in Hollywood.

1217
01:25:28,205 --> 01:25:29,934
Daddy has a job out there.

1218
01:25:30,107 --> 01:25:33,508
You're so smart.
I heard Mama talking to him last night.

1219
01:25:33,677 --> 01:25:35,304
Didn't I?

1220
01:25:35,879 --> 01:25:38,814
Well, didn't I?

1221
01:25:45,021 --> 01:25:46,750
Yes, Donald.

1222
01:25:51,962 --> 01:25:55,227
- Can we swim in the ocean, Mommy?
- Yes, darling.

1223
01:25:59,703 --> 01:26:03,605
Gus, we have no secrets from Fred.

1224
01:26:03,774 --> 01:26:07,676
I simply told him the truth, that's all.
You needed this.

1225
01:26:07,844 --> 01:26:10,142
Do I have to be wet-nursed
through my whole life?

1226
01:26:10,313 --> 01:26:14,477
No, Gus. I just have a little less pride
than you have.

1227
01:26:14,651 --> 01:26:17,882
Yeah, sure, sure.
You have a little less pride.

1228
01:26:18,054 --> 01:26:20,113
A little more push too.

1229
01:26:20,557 --> 01:26:24,687
When I was on top, I never knew if I was
writing the hits or you were making them.

1230
01:26:24,861 --> 01:26:27,125
For years, everybody's been saying
the same thing.

1231
01:26:27,297 --> 01:26:28,730
What do you want me to do?

1232
01:26:28,899 --> 01:26:31,800
Stand on the sidelines
and watch your talent dry up?

1233
01:26:31,968 --> 01:26:35,096
I'm your wife, Gus.
I've got a right to help you.

1234
01:26:37,073 --> 01:26:40,634
Would it make you any happier
if I collected an agent's commission?

1235
01:26:41,111 --> 01:26:43,272
There's such a thing as too much help.

1236
01:26:46,216 --> 01:26:48,582
I didn't know I was in the way.

1237
01:26:48,752 --> 01:26:52,552
I've gotten to depend upon you so much,
I can't think for myself anymore.

1238
01:26:53,056 --> 01:26:55,183
Look what's happened to us.

1239
01:26:55,992 --> 01:26:58,426
Is the depression my fault too?

1240
01:26:58,595 --> 01:27:02,656
You pick my ties,
my suits, my tune-writers.

1241
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:05,495
You even order for me in a restaurant.

1242
01:27:06,636 --> 01:27:09,537
Well, from now on, just order for one.

1243
01:27:11,241 --> 01:27:12,833
Gus.

1244
01:27:20,851 --> 01:27:22,443
I'm leaving.

1245
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:26,989
Take the kids out for a walk
or something.

1246
01:27:30,527 --> 01:27:32,927
Aren't you going to
say goodbye to them?

1247
01:27:33,964 --> 01:27:36,125
You'll think of something to tell them.

1248
01:27:37,634 --> 01:27:42,970
Yeah. That's one thing I'm good at.

1249
01:28:05,695 --> 01:28:08,391
- Stop it. Stop it.
- What's the matter?

1250
01:28:08,565 --> 01:28:09,862
Isn't that Johann Strauss?

1251
01:28:10,033 --> 01:28:12,968
I don't see how it can be.
I got paid for it last Thursday.

1252
01:28:13,136 --> 01:28:16,435
Johnny, why don't you try
something of your own?

1253
01:28:16,606 --> 01:28:18,631
This is no time to be revolutionary.

1254
01:28:18,808 --> 01:28:20,935
We've gotta have
a complete score in 10 days.

1255
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:23,375
So we take a little of Strauss.

1256
01:28:25,515 --> 01:28:27,915
And we steal a little of this:

1257
01:28:29,286 --> 01:28:31,720
And we throw in a little of this:

1258
01:28:33,023 --> 01:28:36,652
And then some... and we got it. Listen.

1259
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,526
You're a great tune-writer,
how can you do a thing like this?

1260
01:28:46,703 --> 01:28:52,073
- I'll tell you in one word. Money.
- Yeah.

1261
01:28:52,242 --> 01:28:55,643
Look, Gus, you've been fighting this
for months, and what has it got you?

1262
01:28:55,812 --> 01:28:58,144
You've been thrown out
of two studios already.

1263
01:28:58,315 --> 01:28:59,873
Believe me, you can't win.

1264
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,245
There are only two kinds
of people in this town:

1265
01:29:02,419 --> 01:29:05,115
The ones who eat at Romanoff's
and the ones who serve them.

1266
01:29:05,288 --> 01:29:08,121
Stop rehearsing for a tray
and let's give them what they want.

1267
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:11,692
Okay, okay, I give up. Go ahead, play it.

1268
01:29:28,011 --> 01:29:30,878
I can't put my finger on it,
but it just doesn't ring a bell.

1269
01:29:31,047 --> 01:29:34,676
I've got one outside on my bicycle.
Should I bring it in?

1270
01:29:35,051 --> 01:29:37,315
I know you've been working
14 hours a day on this.

1271
01:29:37,487 --> 01:29:40,479
The bad stuff always comes
twice as hard.

1272
01:29:41,024 --> 01:29:42,548
Well, that's that.

1273
01:29:42,726 --> 01:29:46,526
Gus, did I ever tell you how
I first met you?

1274
01:29:47,831 --> 01:29:49,355
Met me?

1275
01:29:49,532 --> 01:29:53,400
Back in college, there was a beat-up
phonograph in our fraternity house.

1276
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:56,801
Nine out of 10 records we played
were Gus Kahn songs.

1277
01:29:56,973 --> 01:29:58,201
That's how I first met you.

1278
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:03,008
When all the smart boys in Hollywood
said you were through...

1279
01:30:03,179 --> 01:30:04,976
...I remembered that phonograph player.

1280
01:30:05,148 --> 01:30:08,117
Stop. I'm getting all choked up.

1281
01:30:08,284 --> 01:30:11,344
Thanks for the kind words,
but it's no use.

1282
01:30:11,521 --> 01:30:14,046
I don't write what they're singing today.

1283
01:30:14,724 --> 01:30:17,192
Is it that you don't write it
or you can't write it?

1284
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,658
Maybe the smart boys are right.

1285
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:24,894
Listen here, son. Don't you sit there
and tell me I'm through.

1286
01:30:25,068 --> 01:30:27,559
This is Gus Kahn you're talking to.

1287
01:30:27,871 --> 01:30:30,101
I was writing hits
when you were in kindergarten.

1288
01:30:30,273 --> 01:30:33,140
And I'm gonna go on writing them,
but my way, not yours.

1289
01:30:33,309 --> 01:30:37,871
Look, don't fly off the handle, Gus.
Times change, formulas change.

1290
01:30:38,048 --> 01:30:40,846
A man with your talent shouldn't
let the parade pass him by.

1291
01:30:41,017 --> 01:30:43,042
I don't want any part of this parade.

1292
01:30:43,219 --> 01:30:46,916
It was my own fault for trying to copy it.
I don't copy anybody. They copy me.

1293
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:48,557
I don't write by formula.

1294
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:51,888
To me, a song isn't just words
set to music.

1295
01:30:52,062 --> 01:30:56,055
It's something from the heart that's
real and honest and says something.

1296
01:30:56,232 --> 01:31:02,262
- Not silly sounds... and:
- Oh, now, Gus...

1297
01:31:03,473 --> 01:31:05,270
I'm through. Go get yourself a parrot.

1298
01:31:10,847 --> 01:31:11,871
What got into him?

1299
01:31:14,784 --> 01:31:17,685
Better find a parrot who plays the piano.

1300
01:31:22,792 --> 01:31:24,555
Gus!

1301
01:31:34,504 --> 01:31:38,770
- Hello.
- Grace. Hello.

1302
01:31:38,942 --> 01:31:43,402
- You look pretty good.
- I'll get him in the next round.

1303
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:47,676
- Would you mind if I kissed you?
- Come here.

1304
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:56,383
Well, what do you think of me?

1305
01:31:57,127 --> 01:32:01,689
I finally did something all by myself.
No help from anybody.

1306
01:32:02,031 --> 01:32:05,330
- I knew I had a talent.
- Stop. Stop it.

1307
01:32:05,502 --> 01:32:09,233
I had to come 2000 miles to
find out I'm washed up.

1308
01:32:09,572 --> 01:32:11,904
You know, when they brought me
to this hospital...

1309
01:32:12,075 --> 01:32:15,533
...it was the first time in two years
I had my name in Variety.

1310
01:32:16,579 --> 01:32:18,911
I couldn't even get in the Brown Derby.

1311
01:32:19,415 --> 01:32:22,851
When I was younger,
I didn't mind if people pushed me around.

1312
01:32:23,019 --> 01:32:29,083
I had to struggle, because I never knew
what success was really like.

1313
01:32:29,592 --> 01:32:33,358
But once you've lived
on the top of the world...

1314
01:32:34,364 --> 01:32:36,594
...it's no fun anymore at the bottom.

1315
01:32:36,766 --> 01:32:39,030
Gus, I'm ashamed of you.

1316
01:32:39,202 --> 01:32:41,966
I'm ashamed because
you're forgetting who you are...

1317
01:32:42,138 --> 01:32:46,734
...and what you've done
and what you're going to do.

1318
01:32:49,212 --> 01:32:51,806
Who pulled the blinds down?

1319
01:32:54,384 --> 01:32:57,945
This is the town where they'd ask
Shakespeare, "What have you done lately?"

1320
01:32:58,121 --> 01:33:00,988
But you write one hit
and you're back up on top.

1321
01:33:01,157 --> 01:33:05,719
- I don't write their kind of songs. I can't.
- Well, I should hope not.

1322
01:33:06,863 --> 01:33:09,889
First thing I have to do is get you out
and put you to work.

1323
01:33:10,066 --> 01:33:12,967
I can't let you lie here
feeling sorry for yourself.

1324
01:33:17,907 --> 01:33:20,671
- You know something?
- What?

1325
01:33:21,911 --> 01:33:25,506
When you first walked in,
I thought I was sick.

1326
01:33:29,686 --> 01:33:32,849
- You'll have to leave. It's his bath now.
- All right.

1327
01:33:33,022 --> 01:33:37,186
- Isn't she pretty?
- Of course. This is Hollywood, isn't it?

1328
01:33:39,662 --> 01:33:42,187
- Oh, honey.
- What?

1329
01:33:42,365 --> 01:33:46,131
You remember the backstage
that time at Whoopee?

1330
01:33:46,536 --> 01:33:48,561
You mean Gloria Knight?

1331
01:33:49,472 --> 01:33:52,498
Big phony. Nothing happened.

1332
01:33:52,942 --> 01:33:55,843
I've been meaning to tell you that
for a long time.

1333
01:33:56,112 --> 01:33:58,876
Oh, you took a load off my mind.

1334
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:05,515
Thank you.

1335
01:34:08,057 --> 01:34:09,684
Isn't she pretty?

1336
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:12,293
Well?

1337
01:34:16,432 --> 01:34:20,892
- How'd he take it?
- Fine.

1338
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:23,538
He's gonna be all right, Fred.

1339
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:27,441
And he's gonna keep on writing songs.

1340
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:30,344
But, Mrs. Kahn, I've warned you.
If he works...

1341
01:34:30,513 --> 01:34:33,914
What do you think will happen to him
if he doesn't work, doctor?

1342
01:34:34,484 --> 01:34:38,716
You know, there are some things in a man's
heart that don't show up on a cardiogram.

1343
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:49,489
Fred, is it all right for
a girl my age to cry?

1344
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:51,327
Sure.

1345
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:01,409
- How's the new team coming along?
- Great. He's teaching me quite a bit.

1346
01:35:09,452 --> 01:35:11,545
Wouldn't it sound better this way?

1347
01:35:14,857 --> 01:35:16,256
Sorry.

1348
01:35:18,027 --> 01:35:20,689
If that tune doesn't strike you,
how about this one?

1349
01:35:25,201 --> 01:35:28,398
Crackerjack Song Service. If you don't
hear what you want, just ask for it.

1350
01:35:39,615 --> 01:35:41,344
- Walter.
- Hello, Grace.

1351
01:35:41,517 --> 01:35:43,576
I'm so glad to see you.

1352
01:35:43,753 --> 01:35:45,380
I thought you didn't approve of me.

1353
01:35:45,555 --> 01:35:48,718
Then why would I send for you?
Come on in.

1354
01:35:48,891 --> 01:35:51,257
- You're sure it's all right?
- Of course.

1355
01:35:55,498 --> 01:35:56,863
What's the trouble, money?

1356
01:35:57,033 --> 01:36:00,059
No. Money won't help Gus.

1357
01:36:00,236 --> 01:36:02,363
- He needs something only you can give.
- What?

1358
01:36:02,538 --> 01:36:06,030
Another hit, Walter.
That's the best medicine in the world.

1359
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:11,847
Grace, how do you guarantee a hit? I might
come up with nothing. I've done it before.

1360
01:36:12,014 --> 01:36:13,447
But that isn't important.

1361
01:36:13,616 --> 01:36:16,346
Gus has to feel
that he's back with the boys on top.

1362
01:36:16,519 --> 01:36:18,510
He'll take it from there.

1363
01:36:19,088 --> 01:36:22,319
We stopped running as an entry
a long time ago.

1364
01:36:22,492 --> 01:36:24,653
It'll be much easier for him
with somebody else.

1365
01:36:24,827 --> 01:36:25,816
Here he comes.

1366
01:36:28,197 --> 01:36:31,758
- Well, if it isn't the smiling Irishman.
- Hello, Gus.

1367
01:36:31,934 --> 01:36:35,461
I must be in pretty bad shape
to drag you away from the track.

1368
01:36:35,638 --> 01:36:37,299
As a matter of fact, I was losing...

1369
01:36:37,473 --> 01:36:40,408
...and I thought it was about time
I dropped in and said hello.

1370
01:36:40,576 --> 01:36:45,878
- How are you, Gus?
- Fine. Fine, I'm working.

1371
01:36:46,282 --> 01:36:49,843
Matter of fact,
I'm working on a few tunes right now.

1372
01:36:50,019 --> 01:36:55,958
I found an up-and-coming young fellow
with a lot of fresh new ideas.

1373
01:36:56,225 --> 01:37:00,457
We expect to have
a few tunes out any day now and...

1374
01:37:05,568 --> 01:37:07,536
Why am I telling you
the story of my life?

1375
01:37:07,837 --> 01:37:09,464
Visiting hours are over.

1376
01:37:11,374 --> 01:37:17,779
Gus, you kind of put me in a tough spot,
because I came to ask a favor.

1377
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:22,542
I haven't got it anymore, Walter.
You caught me between millions.

1378
01:37:22,718 --> 01:37:26,484
No, it isn't money.
It's something that only you can give me.

1379
01:37:26,656 --> 01:37:28,715
- What?
- Another hit.

1380
01:37:28,891 --> 01:37:30,552
And I sure need one.

1381
01:37:30,726 --> 01:37:34,423
You won't have to chase me around
anymore. I'm a new kind of guy.

1382
01:37:34,597 --> 01:37:39,159
I got a wonderful wife and a new home
and I'd like to be able to afford them.

1383
01:37:39,335 --> 01:37:41,166
So...

1384
01:37:42,104 --> 01:37:46,200
...if I bring you a note from my mother,
could we work together again, chief?

1385
01:37:48,811 --> 01:37:50,039
What do you think, Grace?

1386
01:37:50,213 --> 01:37:54,479
Oh, it's up to you, Gus.
I'm not running your life anymore.

1387
01:37:55,051 --> 01:37:59,181
- I finally got her trained.
- Yeah.

1388
01:37:59,355 --> 01:38:01,152
It's a deal.

1389
01:38:02,091 --> 01:38:05,822
I don't know how word got around so fast,
but I just got a call from Jerry Kern.

1390
01:38:05,995 --> 01:38:08,054
He wants to know how soon
Gus can go to work.

1391
01:38:08,231 --> 01:38:10,859
Same from Harry Akst,
same from Harry Warren...

1392
01:38:11,033 --> 01:38:14,332
...and Isham Jones just airmailed
a melody from Chicago.

1393
01:38:14,504 --> 01:38:17,701
- Well, that's wonderful.
- You're a wonderful woman, Grace.

1394
01:38:17,874 --> 01:38:20,638
I should have married you
the day you walked into my office.

1395
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:22,778
I'd probably be president now.

1396
01:38:22,945 --> 01:38:26,176
No, on second thought,
you'd probably be president.

1397
01:38:28,751 --> 01:38:29,740
Isn't it awful?

1398
01:38:29,919 --> 01:38:33,355
It's the simple tunes that drive you crazy.
I'm stuck right in the middle.

1399
01:38:33,789 --> 01:38:35,450
Play it for me.

1400
01:38:42,265 --> 01:38:44,460
Why have you got it so dark in here?

1401
01:38:47,537 --> 01:38:51,371
- Where'd you get that dress?
- It's an old one.

1402
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:54,999
- I don't like it.
- You always did like it.

1403
01:38:55,177 --> 01:38:57,077
Play it. Play it, will you?

1404
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:03,215
Grace, please, play the melody.

1405
01:39:03,386 --> 01:39:05,980
I'm digging for a line
and you're giving me arrangements.

1406
01:39:06,155 --> 01:39:08,555
- I'm sorry.
- Whoever told you you could play piano?

1407
01:39:08,724 --> 01:39:11,318
- You did.
- I was young then.

1408
01:39:11,494 --> 01:39:12,927
I'll try to do better.

1409
01:39:13,095 --> 01:39:15,859
- Where's my pencil?
- Behind your ear.

1410
01:39:16,766 --> 01:39:18,631
All right, play, play.

1411
01:39:32,248 --> 01:39:37,015
Still I feel the thrill of your charms...

1412
01:39:37,453 --> 01:39:39,182
- Pretty.
- What?

1413
01:39:39,355 --> 01:39:41,050
Your dress.

1414
01:39:41,524 --> 01:39:44,288
- How's my piano-playing?
- Next week, Carnegie Hall.

1415
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:47,827
- What are the words, Gus?
- Take a look at them.

1416
01:39:49,665 --> 01:39:52,634
If you come out even, we've got a song.

1417
01:39:52,802 --> 01:39:55,430
"I'll See You in My Dreams."

1418
01:39:56,739 --> 01:39:58,366
Play it for me.

1419
01:40:03,546 --> 01:40:10,145
I'll see you in my dreams

1420
01:40:12,054 --> 01:40:18,391
Hold you in my dreams

1421
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:26,695
Someone took you out of my arms

1422
01:40:28,938 --> 01:40:31,873
Still I feel

1423
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:38,537
The thrill of your charms

1424
01:40:39,382 --> 01:40:44,786
Lips that once were mine

1425
01:40:46,055 --> 01:40:51,960
Tender eyes that shine

1426
01:40:53,629 --> 01:40:56,655
They will light

1427
01:40:56,832 --> 01:41:01,860
My way tonight

1428
01:41:02,938 --> 01:41:07,398
I'll see you in

1429
01:41:07,576 --> 01:41:14,175
My dreams

1430
01:41:49,285 --> 01:41:51,879
In the main ballroom,
we can seat 300 guests.

1431
01:41:52,054 --> 01:41:54,022
- The table for the guest of honor...
- Fine.

1432
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:56,454
I don't want
any fruit salad or chicken à la king.

1433
01:41:56,625 --> 01:41:59,822
These people are in the music business.
With them, eating's a ritual.

1434
01:41:59,995 --> 01:42:02,327
I don't know why
you're making these arrangements.

1435
01:42:02,498 --> 01:42:04,227
How am I going to get Gus to show up?

1436
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:09,736
I don't know, I don't know. Say anything.
Tell him the dinner's for Jerome Kern.

1437
01:42:09,905 --> 01:42:13,739
What'll I do when Gus finds out the surprise
dinner is for him, that I tricked him?

1438
01:42:13,909 --> 01:42:17,106
Come on, Grace.
He must've gotten to like it by now.

1439
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:19,144
Leave the bottle.

1440
01:42:19,348 --> 01:42:22,715
I'm throwing caution to the wind.
To the party.

1441
01:42:26,055 --> 01:42:27,044
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1442
01:42:27,223 --> 01:42:28,212
Good evening.

1443
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:31,450
- I never can get this tie straight.
- Turn around. I'll fix it for you.

1444
01:42:31,627 --> 01:42:35,290
I could've gone to the ball game.
Instead, you dress me up like a headwaiter.

1445
01:42:35,464 --> 01:42:36,931
- Will you stand still?
- Grace.

1446
01:42:37,099 --> 01:42:38,862
- Hello, Walter.
- Who's your little boy?

1447
01:42:39,034 --> 01:42:41,195
The same one I've been
taking care of for years.

1448
01:42:41,370 --> 01:42:42,928
You're here on Jerome Kern night?

1449
01:42:43,105 --> 01:42:45,630
You never attend a testimonial
for anyone but yourself.

1450
01:42:45,808 --> 01:42:48,299
Well, it got to be a long time
between dinners.

1451
01:42:48,477 --> 01:42:49,808
- Gus.
- Hi, John.

1452
01:42:49,979 --> 01:42:52,379
Don't believe what anyone tells you.
You look lovely.

1453
01:42:52,548 --> 01:42:54,743
It took the family
to get him into that suit.

1454
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:58,444
Why make a big thing about a dinner?
You'd think the guy needed the meal.

1455
01:42:58,621 --> 01:43:02,489
Everybody's here. George Gershwin,
Sigmund Romberg, Vincent Youmans...

1456
01:43:02,658 --> 01:43:06,822
Yeah, come on. Let's go, Grace.
They're waiting for the second team.

1457
01:43:25,748 --> 01:43:28,808
Don't look at me, it was Walter's idea.

1458
01:43:33,756 --> 01:43:35,917
I couldn't let you know
it was for you, darling.

1459
01:43:36,091 --> 01:43:38,116
You'd still be running.

1460
01:44:07,623 --> 01:44:11,354
It's customary for the guest of honor
to make a speech after dinner...

1461
01:44:11,527 --> 01:44:15,122
...but this kid is liable to skip
before the soup course.

1462
01:44:16,198 --> 01:44:18,598
Five years ago,
the doctors were counting him out...

1463
01:44:18,767 --> 01:44:21,292
...but he got up and walked away
before they got to 10.

1464
01:44:23,505 --> 01:44:28,909
May I present the man that we're paying
$ 15 a plate to honor, drinks extra...

1465
01:44:29,812 --> 01:44:32,440
...my friend, Gus Kahn.

1466
01:44:45,761 --> 01:44:48,127
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1467
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:56,100
I've had so much in my life
for which to be grateful.

1468
01:44:57,473 --> 01:45:00,806
And one of the most...

1469
01:45:02,778 --> 01:45:05,338
Well, let me put it this way.

1470
01:45:06,382 --> 01:45:10,045
You all know I was practically raised
on apple strudel.

1471
01:45:11,787 --> 01:45:16,850
But I have two extra-favorite Irish dishes.

1472
01:45:18,394 --> 01:45:23,559
Mulligan stew and Walter Donaldson.

1473
01:45:24,733 --> 01:45:28,464
Which brings up the question,
what am I doing up here by myself?

1474
01:45:29,238 --> 01:45:33,470
It's a room filled with men
I've had the privilege to work with...

1475
01:45:34,243 --> 01:45:37,337
...and this dinner is really for all of you.

1476
01:45:38,881 --> 01:45:42,908
But most of all, it's for Grace.

1477
01:45:43,752 --> 01:45:49,384
I don't know quite how to say it,
but without her, I...

1478
01:45:55,064 --> 01:45:58,363
You're not just gonna sit there
and watch me hang, are you?

1479
01:46:09,578 --> 01:46:12,206
Without this little girl, I'm just a mug.

1480
01:46:12,982 --> 01:46:16,918
I tried it once. Fell flat on my back.

1481
01:46:17,619 --> 01:46:22,488
She taught me something many years ago
that I'll never forget.

1482
01:46:23,125 --> 01:46:28,028
She said, "Young folks don't know
how to say 'I love you'...

1483
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:33,495
...so you say it for them,
put it to 32 bars of music."

1484
01:46:35,938 --> 01:46:40,500
I guess I've written about a thousand
of those "I love you" songs...

1485
01:46:41,777 --> 01:46:44,075
...but never said it to my own girl.

1486
01:46:44,246 --> 01:46:48,478
- Except once, when she was under ether.
- Oh, Gus.

1487
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:52,916
What's there to be ashamed of?
These are our friends.

1488
01:46:54,289 --> 01:47:00,250
Darling, if I never told it to you,
it wasn't that I didn't mean it.

1489
01:47:01,096 --> 01:47:06,728
It's just that I could never believe that a
face like this could say to a face like that...

1490
01:47:06,902 --> 01:47:09,598
..."I love you" and get away with it.

1491
01:47:11,306 --> 01:47:16,573
But I loved you the first day I saw you.
I love you now.

1492
01:47:17,246 --> 01:47:20,443
And God willing,
I'll love you as long as I live.

1493
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:26,778
- Gus, how about singing a song, huh?
- Sing us the first one you ever wrote, huh?

1494
01:47:30,092 --> 01:47:36,190
You wouldn't believe it,
but I really don't even remember it.

1495
01:47:36,365 --> 01:47:40,961
Honestly, I wrote the song, but I'm sure
I don't remember all the words.

1496
01:47:41,136 --> 01:47:43,730
Will this help, Mr. Kahn?

1497
01:47:52,614 --> 01:47:55,276
Would you play it for me, Ms. LeBoy?

1498
01:48:06,195 --> 01:48:12,532
Gee, I wish that I had a girl

1499
01:48:13,969 --> 01:48:17,564
Like the other fellows had

1500
01:48:19,975 --> 01:48:24,674
Someone to make a fuss over me

1501
01:48:25,447 --> 01:48:31,443
To cheer me up when I feel sad

1502
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:37,616
On Wednesday night, I'm all alone

1503
01:48:37,793 --> 01:48:40,853
When I ought to be up

1504
01:48:41,029 --> 01:48:44,795
At some sweetheart's home

1505
01:48:46,602 --> 01:48:53,201
And I'm lonesome, awful lonesome

1506
01:48:53,609 --> 01:48:55,907
Gee

1507
01:48:56,845 --> 01:49:01,475
I wish I had

1508
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:06,587
A girl
