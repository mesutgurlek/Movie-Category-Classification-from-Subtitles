1
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,751
So, Millie...
- Yes.

2
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:49,052
You Russian?
- Yes.

3
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:51,464
You are a very beautiful woman.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:53,123
You like Indian men?
- Yes.

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,225
Yes. Yes. Yes. Very good.

6
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:56,360
Scram.

7
00:00:56,536 --> 00:01:00,404
So maybe... we can go somewhere.
- Maybe.

8
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:02,465
Let me tell you
something in your ears.

9
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:03,270
Yes.

10
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:04,469
Just a minute.

11
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:05,943
What?

12
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:09,807
Tanya.
- You cheat.

13
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:12,351
You're double timing
both me and my sister.

14
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:15,286
No, it is not so.
- I'll go and tell mom everything.

15
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:17,546
She praises you a lot.

16
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,123
Now she too will know what
kind of a person you are.

17
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:21,854
Goodbye.
- Listen...

18
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:24,328
Don't tell anything to your mom. Shit.

19
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,830
Forget the daughters, I
lost their mom as well.

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,295
Not a problem, I still have Millie.

21
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,767
Millie. How are you?

22
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:33,467
Damn...

23
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:35,171
Oh. Hello.

24
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:37,369
I'm Nainsukhbhai Chamanlal Patel.

25
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:39,241
You don't need to memorize it.

26
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:40,904
I don't either.

27
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:43,039
You know what? You can call me Nano.

28
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,051
Small, sweet and affordable.

29
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,221
Before you say "ta-ta,
Nano" and leave.

30
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:52,450
Let me tell you, this isn't my story.

31
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:54,385
It's Sid's. My best friend.

32
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:57,258
Today is the happiest day of his life.

33
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:01,266
You know, not every is lucky
enough to have this pleasure.

34
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,341
Lawyer fees Rs. 500,000.

35
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,848
My Omega watch, Rs. 200,000.

36
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:22,178
My favorite car, Rs. 3000,000.

37
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:38,535
Breathing bachelor again...

38
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:41,101
Priceless!

39
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:45,270
Taxi!

40
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,176
Guys, what will we gift Sid?

41
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:53,409
Condoms.

42
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:56,855
Actually, it's a little confusing.

43
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:58,513
What did we give him for his wedding?

44
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:00,315
Condoms.

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,198
Nice.

46
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,131
Have a look.

47
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,006
Good.

48
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,143
Cut it, boy.

49
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:29,085
Speech.

50
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,056
Speech. Speech. Speech.

51
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:33,591
Such a big piece.

52
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:41,266
Okay. I wasn't half as happy
while having my wedding cake.

53
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:47,573
The journey from that cake to
this has been full of sufferings.

54
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:52,004
At the moment, I neither
have a house nor a car.

55
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:53,539
But...

56
00:03:54,014 --> 00:04:01,352
I don't mind, because
I'm once again single.

57
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,176
"Either this one or that."

58
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,719
"No matter who."

59
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:36,319
"I'll welcome all those come my way."

60
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:37,981
"Even if anyone steals my heart."

61
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,491
"No matter whom I meet."

62
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,992
"Even if someone
falls in love with me."

63
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,619
"I'll welcome her with open arms."

64
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,288
"I'm once again single."

65
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:46,696
"I want to mingle."

66
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:50,027
"Beware, beautiful girls."

67
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:53,196
"I'm single."

68
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:56,241
"I'm single."

69
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:59,335
"I'm single."

70
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:02,609
"I'm single."

71
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:05,685
"I'm single."

72
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,653
"I'm single."

73
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:11,714
"I'm single."

74
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:16,019
"I'm single."

75
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:30,041
"If we look at each other."

76
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,668
"Our eyes will do the talking."

77
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:33,610
"We'll spend the night
look at each other."

78
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:38,006
"We'll exchange
romantic texts at night."

79
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:40,109
"We will talk about love."

80
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,818
"In those nights, those conversations,
she will surrender her heart."

81
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:48,754
"Either she or her."

82
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:53,162
"I should find someone now."

83
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,358
"I'm once again single."

84
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,026
"I want to mingle."

85
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:00,163
"Beware, beautiful girls."

86
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:03,367
"I'm single."

87
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,378
"I'm single."

88
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,448
"I'm single."

89
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:12,643
"I'm single."

90
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:15,687
"I'm single."

91
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:18,758
"I'm single."

92
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:22,056
"I'm single."

93
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:26,861
"I'm single."

94
00:06:57,097 --> 00:07:00,260
"I'm single."

95
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:06,628
"I'm someone who is happy
for someone else's happiness."

96
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,731
"I might not come back home."

97
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:12,871
"No one will question where I was."

98
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:15,138
"I have nothing to worry about."

99
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:18,408
"Either this one or that."

100
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:19,884
"No matter who."

101
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:21,518
"I'll welcome all those come my way."

102
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,179
"Even if anyone steals my heart."

103
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,655
"No matter whom I meet."

104
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,191
"Even if someone
falls in love with me."

105
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:28,692
"I'll welcome her with open arms."

106
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:30,453
"I'm once again single."

107
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,155
"I want to mingle."

108
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:34,893
"Beware, beautiful girls."

109
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,361
"I'm single."

110
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:41,440
"I'm single."

111
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:44,500
"I'm single."

112
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:47,705
"I'm single."

113
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:50,681
"I'm single."

114
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,878
"I'm single."

115
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:56,820
"I'm single."

116
00:07:56,923 --> 00:08:00,723
"I'm single."

117
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,572
What's wrong with Sid?

118
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:22,842
What happened?

119
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:25,148
I'll go and see.

120
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:26,776
Wait, wait, wait.
- Please. Please. Please.

121
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:28,417
Let the guys handle this.
- Yeah.

122
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:29,453
You stay here.
- Yeah.

123
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:30,689
Let's go.
- Good luck. - Okay.

124
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,122
Sid.
- Not there. This way.

125
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:34,458
You are drunk.

126
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,066
Guys. What happened?

127
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,156
You don't have a drink in your hand.

128
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:43,293
Are the drinks over?

129
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:47,566
Cut it, Sid. We very well
know how happy you are. Okay?

130
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,437
Don't hide it from us.

131
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,134
You are missing her, right?
- Yeah.

132
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:52,370
Tell us the truth.

133
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,373
I'm missing her a lot.

134
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:58,116
I can't believe that she left me.

135
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:01,248
We had such good times together.

136
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:04,420
Those long drives.

137
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:08,355
Just me and her. No one else.

138
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:12,331
I really miss her, man.
- Me too.

139
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,532
God willing, she will come back.

140
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:17,567
No. She will have to come back.
- Yes.

141
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,898
She has to come back to me.

142
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:20,400
Please, guys.

143
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:24,470
Please don't tell me you are once
again talking about that stupid car.

144
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,172
Hey, please. Don't call it stupid.
And don't you dare call it a car.

145
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,578
She is my love. Look
at her. How beautiful.

146
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,343
She even has a name.

147
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,611
She is my pomp-pomp. My Horny.

148
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,486
Sid, don't you worry.
Your future is rocking.

149
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:39,923
Really?
- My seventh sense says so.

150
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,389
Not seventh, sixth.
- Yes, it's sixth sense.

151
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:46,728
Sorry, guys. But my sixth
sense is only for my sexy aunties.

152
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,634
So Sid, you want to know how
bright your future is, right?

153
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:53,763
Yes, tell me.
- Alright. Listen.

154
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:57,207
My seventh sense tells me...

155
00:09:57,277 --> 00:10:03,739
Exactly after one year you will have
a chauffeur driven Lamborghini car.

156
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:07,311
And a palatial sea-facing bungalow.

157
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,193
Shefali!
- Oh! No.

158
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:19,161
Were you sleeping?
- No.

159
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:24,433
Give it to me. I will keep it.
- No. No. It's okay.

160
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:25,698
What are you doing, dear?

161
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:27,169
I am trying to wear clothes.

162
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,468
You should have at least knocked.

163
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,838
I am sorry.
- It is okay.

164
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:32,444
What?

165
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:34,710
Hey! Who are you?

166
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:35,677
What are you doing here?

167
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:39,240
Well, I wouldn't be watching IPL by
sitting nude inside your cupboard.

168
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:41,853
She is so hot. Try to understand, sir.

169
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:43,752
You bloody swine.
How dare you? Shut up!

170
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:45,188
Sorry.

171
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,623
Shefali! Who is he?
- Thief! Thief! Look how he is...

172
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,488
Nude thief, Shefali.

173
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:51,697
Yes. He must have come
to steal your clothes.

174
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,857
That's why he is hiding inside
the cupboard. - Oh! What nonsense?

175
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,458
You know, chief. I wore
enough clothes while coming.

176
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:57,798
But I didn't know when I removed them.

177
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,462
You know she was so amazing.

178
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:01,404
You bloody...
- Take it easy.

179
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:02,532
Oh, my God!

180
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,439
Look, he tried to attack me and
he himself suffered heart attack.

181
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:07,306
Hey, did he really
suffer heart attack? Hello.

182
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,779
Sir! Sir! What happened?

183
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:11,940
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!

184
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:13,478
Oh, my god. He is not breathing.

185
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:14,881
He is not breathing.

186
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,819
Hey. What are you
doing by sitting there?

187
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,255
Give him mouth to mouth.
He is your husband.

188
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,724
You must be having practice.

189
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,792
At least call the doctor.
Call the ambulance.

190
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,455
Do something. Otherwise he will die.

191
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,429
Not he will die. He has died.

192
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:34,597
Oh! Yes. Yes! Oh! Yes! Oh! Yes!

193
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:38,371
God, thank you. Thank you so much.

194
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:39,934
Finally you heard me.

195
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:41,378
I promise that...

196
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,381
...I will eat chicken during Navratri
(Hindu festival) without onions.

197
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:44,006
What?

198
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,741
Hey, dear. You have
got an ill-fated face.

199
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,309
Old man died
immediately after watching it.

200
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:51,380
Excuse me. Not excuse me. Thank you.

201
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:55,254
My three boyfriends were trying
to kill him since last 6 months.

202
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:56,989
But those useless
guys failed every time.

203
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,895
And you... I met you today.

204
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,027
And work is done
immediately after meeting.

205
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:04,934
So tell me how I
should say thanks to you.

206
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:07,565
Shall we finish the work
which was left incomplete...

207
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,709
...before the old man arrived?
- Hey, have little shame.

208
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,377
Your husband died just now.

209
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,538
Yes. Didn't I wear
white colored night dress?

210
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:15,609
Wow!

211
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,740
Do you know that
there is no tension now?

212
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,646
This entire property is mine.

213
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:21,912
I will fulfill all my dreams.

214
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:23,922
Wow! What a woman?

215
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,548
I am sorry my dear ex-wife.

216
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,956
The title of being the worst woman in
this world has been snatched from you.

217
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,296
We have a better girl.

218
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:33,993
And as far as your
dreams are concerned...

219
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,864
...I have news for you lady.

220
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:37,599
Bad news.

221
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:41,539
'My three boy friends are trying
to kill him since last 6 months.'

222
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:42,904
What is this?

223
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:44,704
But they are useless...
- Give that to me.

224
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,777
'And I met you today only.'

225
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:52,384
One minute. One minute. And
now we have the grand finale.

226
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:54,317
Rise from the dead.

227
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:57,584
You had lot of interest in
getting my will written.

228
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:01,284
Forget the will, I will definitely
send all yours bills to you.

229
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,123
But listen to me...
- I see you in court.

230
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,754
But listen to me!
- I said get out.

231
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,256
I said go.
- Bye.

232
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:11,564
Hey! Give my jeans and go.

233
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,207
I will never repay your favor.

234
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:20,100
But I can definitely
thank you in this way.

235
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,237
One minute please.

236
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,179
You deposit this money in my account.

237
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:26,412
The thing is that I feel I am in a
different profession for taking money...

238
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,281
...from you without wearing clothes.

239
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:32,417
Okay, you take care of yourself.
And that is for you.

240
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,258
Have a good day.
- Thank you.

241
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:38,293
Didn't you get
shocked on watching Sid?

242
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:40,589
Hey, how are you?
- Hi, sexy.

243
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:42,700
Dude became a divorce expert.

244
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:45,530
Actually people were
scared of Lord Shani before.

245
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,797
These days they are afraid of alimony.

246
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,902
Lord Shani leaves
after seven and half years.

247
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,674
Alimony stays with you all your life.

248
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,741
And Sid will get rid of you from it.

249
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:01,176
And under this pretext,
I would get newly divorced and

250
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,151
vulnerable fresh aunts.

251
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:05,383
Look, what happened?

252
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:08,486
I don't know why he cheated on me.

253
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,492
Don't worry. I am there, okay?

254
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,358
Thank you Sid.

255
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,201
Oh! I am sorry.

256
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:23,303
But there is a disappointment
in the story of this hero.

257
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,404
Divorce has got him new business.

258
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:30,939
Sid, who helped the world
couldn't escape from his own alimony.

259
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:35,844
Even today he has to give half
of his income to his ex-wife.

260
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,357
Poor guy, his ex is
still angry with him.

261
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:44,719
What did you say? How
does Sid do all this?

262
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:46,625
Well actually I think...

263
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:51,599
Oh! Yes, dear.
How does Sid do all this?

264
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,463
What do you mean by how I know?

265
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,666
Presence of mind at the right time.
That is needed.

266
00:14:57,643 --> 00:15:02,979
The person who is entering now.
He will order for 650 ml beer.

267
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:04,012
Want to see?

268
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,013
One fosters 650 ml please.

269
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,513
And the aunt sitting behind.
- Yes.

270
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:15,218
She will double the
profit of your bar tonight.

271
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,589
I know it is her fifth shot.

272
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:18,789
That's why I love aunts.

273
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,388
Yes but she doesn't love her husband.

274
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:23,765
Because just now she came to know
that her husband is cheating on her.

275
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:26,396
How do you know?
- Hey, come on, man. Experience, dear.

276
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,108
Yes. On the rocks, buddy.
- Thanks, buddy. Cheers.

277
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,408
And that girl?

278
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:37,242
Oh! That girl is like
solo intellectual type.

279
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,213
Excuse me. - So she comes
to the bar and orders coke.

280
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:44,085
Do you have diet coke?
- Sorry. Diet coke.

281
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,816
Great. One large
whisky with diet coke.

282
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,819
Thanks.

283
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:53,489
What happened to your intelligence?
Has the fuse failed?

284
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,557
Not, dear. Voltage power decreased.

285
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,930
Hey, just now I remembered.
Listen! Listen! Listen!

286
00:15:58,004 --> 00:15:59,335
I think she is Namrata.
She is my client.

287
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,895
I called her here at 6 o'clock.

288
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:02,298
What are you doing, friend?

289
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,173
Hey, hi. I am Sid.

290
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:07,812
Hi, Sid.

291
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,844
So tell me.

292
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:13,207
What?

293
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,150
About your husband.

294
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:18,380
My husband.
- Yes.

295
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,350
Yes. Fine. Why?

296
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:26,420
Look, Namrata. If you
don't tell me about...

297
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,296
...your husband then
how will I help you?

298
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:32,162
Hey, does your husband cheat on you.

299
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:36,872
No.

300
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:39,466
Oh, my god.

301
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:42,207
Does he beat you?

302
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:47,579
Yes, he beats me.

303
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,249
He tortures me badly.

304
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,593
Such a person should
be taught a lesson.

305
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:56,995
I have done the same.

306
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:01,056
I killed him, Sid.
- What...

307
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:04,531
When he was sleeping in the morning,
I took a big knife...

308
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:06,900
...and stabbed in his chest.

309
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:11,432
And I kept stabbing until
he turned red with blood.

310
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,876
Is it?
- Sid. Sid, help me.

311
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,440
Please. Please help me.

312
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:19,907
Oh!

313
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,350
Hello.
- 'Hi, Sid. Namrata here.'

314
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:25,046
'I cannot come today.
Sorry about this.'

315
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:26,485
'Will call you.'

316
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:30,620
So you are not Namrata.

317
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,996
You are...

318
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,369
What fun. Nice joke. Good. Good.

319
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:42,335
I am sorry. The matter which
you started, I have finished it.

320
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:43,932
By the way, I am Ramsay.

321
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:47,111
I am joking, dear. I am Sonali.

322
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:49,111
Yes, Hi, Sonali. This is Sid again.

323
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,712
By the way, what was all this.

324
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,642
I thought you were my client. Namrata.

325
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,312
Client?

326
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:59,319
I am a divorce expert.

327
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:02,555
I get people divorced without
having any complications and problems.

328
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:04,390
I think it is fantastic.

329
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:09,167
Really? - Because my
parents too had a divorce.

330
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:13,161
Oh! I am sorry. - My mother and
father never loved each other at all.

331
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:15,267
But they stayed
together because of me.

332
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,966
That's why finally
I got them divorced.

333
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:21,171
By the way, I am your
senior in this business.

334
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,306
I have solved my
first case 10 years back.

335
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:29,277
Vijender Singh.

336
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:30,447
The famous Indian boxer.
- Brother Vijju.

337
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:33,114
How are you?
- I am fine.

338
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,322
Where is he?
- Sid?

339
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,323
Don't know.

340
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,994
Okay. So you are hiding here?

341
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:44,433
No, friend. Something fell down.

342
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:45,731
What fell down?

343
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:48,205
Why should I tell you? Why are you
chasing me? What's your problem?

344
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:51,607
If you don't get me rid of my
marriage then I will not spare you.

345
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,177
Hey! Are you threatening me?
I am not scared at all.

346
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:54,769
Anyways, nothing can
happen with your marriage.

347
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,039
You come and sit.
- No! No! No! I am busy.

348
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,674
What are you doing?
- I am... I am... I am...

349
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:01,009
What I?
- Mr. Vijender Singh.

350
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,149
He is with me.
- Yes.

351
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,714
Sister-in-law?
Greetings, sister-in-law.

352
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,725
No. Not sister-in-law.
- Then? - She is...

353
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,721
I am his partner. Don't listen.

354
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:13,094
Okay. This is the matter.
Okay. You listen to my problem.

355
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:16,760
Come. The matter is that...

356
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,065
Here...
- This is your drink, Gajwa.

357
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:21,573
Milk.

358
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:27,275
Mr. Gajju. Why are you crying so much?

359
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:29,204
What happened?

360
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,610
What is his problem?

361
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:34,545
His problem is that his wife...
She... With his...

362
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,114
You only tell her, brother Gajju.
What should I say?

363
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,749
Yes.
- Very sad story. You don't cry. - No.

364
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:46,556
The problem is with demand and supply.
I will tell you from the beginning.

365
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:51,735
'Lt was once upon a time.
My career was going great.'

366
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:57,208
'I was a champion. Champion.
24 fights. 22 were knockouts.'

367
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,469
'Every boxer I faced was
defeated in my hands.'

368
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:06,446
'When I would come home
after winning the bout.'

369
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,248
'My wife would keep my prize ready.'

370
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:11,349
Gajju.
- Present, madam.

371
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:13,818
What do you wish to
become today, Gajju?

372
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,383
What will you teach today, madam?

373
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:18,089
'I would lose all the cheese
and butter fed by my mother.'

374
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:19,357
'There was nothing left for the bout.'

375
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:22,360
'Gradually boxers made
me their punching bags.'

376
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:23,594
Hold! Hold! Hold!

377
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:26,463
'Present the next criminal.'

378
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,336
'Lnitially it was lot of fun.'

379
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:31,706
'Slowly I have understood that
destiny is playing with me.'

380
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:38,578
'Finally what I feared has happened.
I was knocked out in the ring.'

381
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:39,709
1. 2.

382
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:42,617
There was no problem with supply.

383
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:44,483
Demand kept increasing.

384
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,622
If I stay with her for few more days...

385
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,626
...then my boxing career
will come to an end.

386
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,229
And if I ask for
divorce citing this reason...

387
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:52,730
...then what is the use of
becoming a champion bearing such image.

388
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,288
World will laugh at me.

389
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:59,498
Sorry. But if your wife
loves you so much then...

390
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:01,567
...you have to adjust a bit. Right?

391
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,734
She doesn't love me at all.
She is filled with lust.

392
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,176
And according to her there
is no man greater than me.

393
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,515
In this situation, I am finished.
Everything is lost.

394
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:14,583
Kamdev.

395
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:17,449
Kamdev will do your work.

396
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:18,922
Look, get it done with Kamdev or
anybody, my work should be done.

397
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:21,454
Get my work done at any cost.

398
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:22,653
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

399
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:24,161
Drink milk. Please.

400
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:25,958
You too drink little.
- No. You drink.

401
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:31,430
Greetings, devotees.

402
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:34,063
There are many yoga
gurus in our country.

403
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:36,902
But not a single sex guru.

404
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:42,236
Baba Kamdev has spent his
entire life on this work.

405
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:45,183
Baba has got only one guru mantra.

406
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:48,081
Work. Work. Work.

407
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,854
Morning. Afternoon. Evening.

408
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:54,321
Silence. Silence.

409
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:58,989
And today Baba will
teach various techniques...

410
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:01,023
...which will turn men into...

411
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,034
And women into Dushasan
(character from Mahabharata).

412
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:08,037
Baba Kamdev!
- Hail!

413
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,268
Baba Kamdev!
- Hail!

414
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:13,903
Did you give the speech to Nano?

415
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:15,844
I did, sir. Don't worry.

416
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:17,040
Good.

417
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:21,547
Are you drunk?

418
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,014
By the way I've made
all the arrangements.

419
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:28,554
Have a look.

420
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,197
My dear devotees.

421
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:40,501
Hey, this is Nano's speech.

422
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:42,438
What did you give him?

423
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,102
Then where's the bar's menu?

424
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:46,511
Fakar!

425
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:57,319
I am proud of all my devotees.

426
00:22:57,423 --> 00:23:03,123
You took out time from
your busy lives and came here.

427
00:23:04,897 --> 00:23:06,125
You idiot.

428
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:08,560
Bar menu.

429
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:14,971
New things keep happening outside.

430
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:18,009
But this is the
question of what lies within.

431
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:23,347
One Old Monk had said that...

432
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:27,181
...you should keep the Black
Dog in you in a tight leash.

433
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:31,117
Otherwise you will be
given a Black Label.

434
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:40,921
But what can a Virgin Lady do?

435
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:45,164
There is no "Sex on the beach."

436
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:48,963
Bloody Mary doesn't even have a Gin...

437
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,908
...from whom she can
ask for a Screwdriver.

438
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:56,106
Poor Margarita has
turned white from red...

439
00:23:56,181 --> 00:24:00,481
...but no Johnnie Walker
gave her a Thunderbolt.

440
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:09,250
It's... It's a Royal Challenge.

441
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:17,495
Even if you have to stay 'On the
Rocks', but don't settle for Small.

442
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:19,499
Go for Large.

443
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:22,039
One shot after another.
One shot after another.

444
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,631
One shot after another.

445
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,336
That's when you will get Happy Hours.

446
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:31,541
Four to eight, plus taxes. VAT extra.

447
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:35,081
I mean...

448
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:41,286
What extra does a woman need?

449
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:51,566
Whiskey. Whiskey...

450
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:59,433
I wish I could share
this feeling with everyone.

451
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:04,242
It's a pity that...

452
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:08,115
...I can share it with only one.

453
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:09,854
So any auntie...

454
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:17,327
Any anticipation won't help.

455
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:23,296
As I said only one fortunate one.

456
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:30,099
Come on, devotees. Come here one
by one and seek sage's blessings.

457
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,674
And only one will get much
more than his blessings.

458
00:25:33,946 --> 00:25:35,641
Much more.
- I'll slap you.

459
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:37,373
Please come.

460
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:46,681
Move.

461
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:58,563
Kamdev, if you make a mistake,
I'll make you run dressed as a woman.

462
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:07,471
What a bomb.

463
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:13,984
Praise the Lord. Lord has signed
that you are that fortunate one.

464
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:18,921
See you later.

465
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,460
Gajju. How are you?
- Very well, brother.

466
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:26,292
Was my job done?
- Yes.

467
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:28,396
This contains Nano's and
your wife's photographs...

468
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,025
...which will make the
judge sweat bullets.

469
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:32,434
Really?
- No. You don't have a look at them.

470
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:33,629
You won't be able to endure it.

471
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:37,140
No. No deed of this
woman can shock me.

472
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:39,206
I was talking about Nano's state.

473
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,042
Have you seen sugarcane from which
its juice has been extracted? - Yes.

474
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:44,012
No jaggery or sugar
could be made from it.

475
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:45,413
It will be help in setting
something on fire. - Right.

476
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:48,743
More? No. No.

477
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:50,648
Oh, my God.

478
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,386
This is seriously bad.

479
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:56,055
Doctor, how is he?
- In a very bad state.

480
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:58,292
I have already given him
four bottles of glucose.

481
00:26:58,397 --> 00:26:59,455
I am about to give him the fifth one.

482
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,499
There are 2-3 sprains on his back,
a hairline fracture in his hips.

483
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:06,762
And a very unusual fracture, you know.

484
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,336
I mean his...
- I know. I know.

485
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:11,069
I don't understand. What has he done?

486
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:13,371
Not what has he done,
doctor. Ask, who has he done.

487
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:14,639
Who?

488
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,215
I am really sorry, man. I
thought this would be a fun experience.

489
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:20,382
Come here.

490
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:21,611
This is for you.
- Relax.

491
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:22,779
What?

492
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:33,323
Hello.

493
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:34,729
Can you please
get my check, please?

494
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,365
Thanks.

495
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:45,301
Now what is this?
- Your share.

496
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:48,776
A fee for a smart idea
and a brilliant speech.

497
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,817
Wow. You actually mint money.

498
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:56,582
Yeah.

499
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:59,654
Interesting profession.
Loads of money.

500
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:01,488
You are so lucky.
- Thank you.

501
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,552
I don't need this.
- Why?

502
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:06,355
I was just happy to help.

503
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:08,293
Look, Sonali,
according to my experience...

504
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:09,800
...relationships should be very clear.

505
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:12,332
Yes.
- You helped me professionally.

506
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:13,803
I am paying you for it.
You are not taking the money.

507
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:15,505
You are not taking the money. It
might create a complication in future.

508
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:17,234
There won't be any complications.

509
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:18,536
Sure?
- Yeah.

510
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:24,773
Happy?
- I guess I am.

511
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,074
Thanks.
- Bye.

512
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,757
Hey Sonali...

513
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:42,597
I was thinking...

514
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,600
Sir, I need a divorce.
- Why?

515
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:55,907
I contracted Malaria
when I got married.

516
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,710
I just escaped death.

517
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:00,383
So didn't your wife support you?

518
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:03,386
No. No, I mean she did.

519
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:05,280
She took great care of me.
She took great care of me.

520
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,017
Because of my mother-in-law.

521
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,456
Because of my mother-in-law.

522
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:10,060
My mother-in-law.

523
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:11,386
Mother-in-law.

524
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,054
Because of my mother-in-law.

525
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:14,598
My mother-in-law.

526
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:17,729
Divorce granted.

527
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:21,495
Two years after we got married,
I suffered huge loss in business.

528
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:25,003
I lost everything. I was ruined.

529
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:27,509
Yet she didn't leave me.

530
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:31,673
My husband and I have
religious differences.

531
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:33,211
How?

532
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:37,152
Like he feels he is God.

533
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:39,723
But I know that he is a devil.

534
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:42,084
Divorce granted.

535
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,152
After that, I lost
everything that I had in gambling.

536
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:48,423
Yet she didn't leave me.

537
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,661
We have health issues.
- What do you mean?

538
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:52,760
I mean I am just sick of him.

539
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:55,066
Divorce granted.

540
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:58,765
A year ago in a cyclone...

541
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:02,513
My entire family, sir...

542
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:05,309
Thank you, ma'am.

543
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,715
Thank you. Thank you very much, ma'am.

544
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,649
Yet she didn't leave me.

545
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:14,054
What?

546
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:18,753
So, what's the problem?

547
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:21,197
You didn't get it?

548
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:24,131
She is inauspicious.

549
00:30:24,202 --> 00:30:25,999
Bad luck.

550
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:27,538
Divorce granted.

551
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:34,541
Sonali, I'd like you
to meet Sahil and Isha.

552
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:35,442
Hi.
- Hi.

553
00:30:35,514 --> 00:30:37,709
They are my foster parents.
They have adopted me.

554
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,181
Adopted you?

555
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,081
Wow. You guys have
been doing a great job.

556
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:42,551
It's been really tough.
- Really tough.

557
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:44,383
It's great to finally meet you.

558
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:47,151
Because nowadays,
Sid only praises you.

559
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,387
All the time. - And we thought
today would be a great day to see you.

560
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:52,285
Really?

561
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,829
I didn't think that you
would celebrate Valentine's day.

562
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,592
I do. It's a fantastic day.

563
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:01,263
People fall in love. They
express it. Then they get married.

564
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:03,170
And then they come straight to us.

565
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:04,742
And then of course our business does...

566
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,135
How unromantic.
- Totally.

567
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:08,145
You and your
fundamentals of love. God.

568
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:09,373
Hey, there's logic behind it.

569
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,813
As if you believe in
love and marriage.

570
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:15,176
Of course, I do. I believe
in both love and marriage.

571
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,312
I thought that after you got
your parents divorced, you don't...

572
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:18,719
That's not the point.
- What is the point?

573
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:21,490
The point is marriage is the
ultimate destination for love.

574
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:25,486
Sometimes we fall in love or
get married to the wrong person.

575
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,826
But divorce gives us another
chance to find our true love.

576
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:33,061
We like this.
- We like this.

577
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:36,838
Nano, you are still on duty?

578
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:39,342
No. It's business during
the day and home at night.

579
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:41,878
Wow, man. I love this.

580
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:46,978
Guys, finally Sid is
yearning for a heart.

581
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,916
Have you lost your mind?
What kind of a doctor are you?

582
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,954
I think you cheated and
cleared your exams. - Shut up.

583
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:55,083
Of course it is true, because the shape
of our heart is nowhere close to this.

584
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:57,525
The only part it resembles is...

585
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:58,857
Oh no.

586
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:01,025
A bum.
- Oh yeah.

587
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:02,930
And it can give only one thing.

588
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:04,259
Potty.

589
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:06,400
Potty. Potty. Potty.

590
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:08,870
Nano, come let's eat.
- No, you eat it.

591
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,838
Why? What happened?

592
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:11,375
I have an upset stomach since morning.

593
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:14,206
Think of it that I am
expelling a lot of love out.

594
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,304
Oh no.
- Disgusting.

595
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:17,438
More love is going to come out.

596
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:18,640
Yuck.

597
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:27,448
Divorce granted.

598
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:30,895
Today is taxi strike.

599
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:33,357
You earn good money.
Why don't you buy a car?

600
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:36,894
Oh! Believe it or not.
Because of love. - Really?

601
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:39,160
Here's my first love.

602
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,563
My Horny.

603
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:43,067
But she is no longer
with me. She left me.

604
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:46,110
I won't rest in peace
till I don't get her back.

605
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:48,372
How sweet. Horny. She had an accident?

606
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,471
No, I had an accident.

607
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:54,248
I got divorced and she
is now with my ex-wife.

608
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,048
Excuse me? What?

609
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:59,014
You are divorced and
you didn't even tell me.

610
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:02,387
When did you tell me that you
believe in love and marriage?

611
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:07,356
People get divorced
for such weird reasons.

612
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:11,094
By the way, what was your reason?

613
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:16,134
Can we concentrate on the case?
- Yes, of course.

614
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:24,414
You don't look like
the one who will cheat.

615
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:27,378
Was she cheating on you?

616
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:31,655
Sonali, let's just
concentrate on the work.

617
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:33,351
Sorry.

618
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:35,188
Now we won't discuss
this topic at all.

619
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,249
Thank you.

620
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,465
Listen...

621
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:51,398
You are not impotent, right?

622
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,945
Fine. Let's go.
- Where?

623
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:57,878
Come let me show it to you...
- Where?

624
00:33:57,949 --> 00:34:00,383
Otherwise you won't
believe me. You wanted to know.

625
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:04,078
I will prove it to you.
- No.

626
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:08,125
Hey, what is this, guys?
- Sorry.

627
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:09,989
You are making noise at 1:00am?

628
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:12,029
Decent people are sleeping.

629
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,461
What happened, darling?

630
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:15,499
Nothing, baby. Nothing to worry.

631
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:17,262
Sure, love?

632
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,831
Yuck.

633
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:49,364
Who was she?

634
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:52,536
Our next client.

635
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:54,805
Mark Pereira's wife.

636
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:56,396
The business tycoon Pereira?

637
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:58,203
Yes. - Wow.

638
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:00,368
Lucky girl.
- Not really.

639
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:04,378
She just found out
that he's cheating on her.

640
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,876
In fact, right now he is in Greece,
with his mistress.

641
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:12,189
What ajerk. Let him come back.
We'll teach him a lesson.

642
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:15,317
Yes, but why should we
wait for him to come back?

643
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:17,185
What do you mean?

644
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:18,854
We too can go there.

645
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:20,329
Greece?

646
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:21,228
Really.

647
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:24,096
Yes, a work and leisure trip.

648
00:35:24,202 --> 00:35:25,134
Wow.

649
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:29,904
Babes, need any help?
- No, I am done.

650
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:32,367
Oh God. Such a big bag.

651
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:34,945
This case is very complicated, right?

652
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:37,041
Nothing to do with the case.

653
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,241
Just taking some
personal girlie stuff.

654
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:40,648
Dresses for occasions.

655
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,953
I thought this is an official trip.

656
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:45,648
But it looks like you are
going for a different trip.

657
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,984
By the way if you go out
for fun, take him with you.

658
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:51,584
Not me, he will take me
sightseeing in Greece.

659
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:52,994
He has promised me.

660
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:54,894
Really?
- Yeah.

661
00:35:55,233 --> 00:36:01,001
Okay. Here comes coffee,
lots of mint and menthol. Done.

662
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:02,603
These are Sid's things?

663
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:05,373
Perhaps these things
aren't available in Greece.

664
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:09,346
By the way, have you do
this for anyone before?

665
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:13,578
Isha. - See, Greece is
a romantic destination.

666
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,118
Clearly, you are very excited.

667
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,209
You are taking so
many clothes with you.

668
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:18,915
And Sid has promised you
that he will take you out.

669
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,357
I don't know about you but I am
getting that "couple" feeling.

670
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:24,024
You know I can sense it.

671
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:26,221
Something is surely
going to happen in Greece.

672
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:28,025
Isha, you are mad.

673
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,258
No, Sonali. You are mad.
Let us leave. We are getting late.

674
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:31,734
I don't want to miss this flight.
- Yes.

675
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,370
Less work and more holidays in Greece.

676
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:46,650
"Have you ever got this feeling?"

677
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:51,120
"Can you hear me calling I love you?"

678
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:59,325
"Standing here beside you, want
so much to give you and love you."

679
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:23,519
"Why am I excited when I am with you?"

680
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:32,686
"Why does this city look
beautiful when you are with me?"

681
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:39,061
"Why do I feel that
your feelings are mine?"

682
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:47,372
"Why does this city look
beautiful when you are with me?"

683
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:54,475
"When I am with you, time flies."

684
00:37:55,286 --> 00:38:03,091
"When I am with you,
tell me why silence speaks."

685
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:07,027
"Why does this world
look like heaven?"

686
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:14,503
"Why does the sky start
worshiping when I am with you?"

687
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:16,299
"I am with you."

688
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:20,811
"Yes, I am with you."

689
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:31,789
"I am with you."

690
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:34,484
"I am with you."

691
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:45,093
"The moments I spend
with you I feel...

692
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:53,099
...as if happiness is being
sold for free everywhere."

693
00:38:54,312 --> 00:39:03,084
"My breath feels musical when I am..."

694
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:07,419
"When I am with you."

695
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:10,689
"When I am with you."

696
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:12,354
"I am with you."

697
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,888
"Yes, I am with you."

698
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:25,374
"I am with you."

699
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:40,655
"The path treaded a
million times seems new."

700
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:50,464
"Why do I once again feel
that any distance is less?"

701
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:59,443
"My desires come alive when I am..."

702
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,537
"When I am with you."

703
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:14,923
"When I am with you, time flies.
- I am with you."

704
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:19,524
"When I am with you,
tell me why silence speaks."

705
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:23,464
"Why does this world
look like heaven?"

706
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:31,303
"Why does the sky start worshiping
when I am with you? - With you."

707
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:32,932
"I am with you.
- With you."

708
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:36,374
"Yes, I am with you."

709
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:39,280
"Have you ever got this feeling?"

710
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:44,811
"Can you hear me calling I love you?
- I love you."

711
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:49,256
"Should have seen it coming,
got me caught for nothing."

712
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:50,794
"I love you."

713
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:56,459
"I am with you."

714
00:40:57,735 --> 00:40:59,760
Thank you.
- You are welcome.

715
00:40:59,871 --> 00:41:01,805
Feel good?
- Yeah. Nice.

716
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:04,603
Oh, my God. Mark
this is the night club...

717
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:06,609
...everyone in the
hotel is talking about.

718
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:08,474
Please, we will go
there for sure, tomorrow.

719
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,206
Please Mark. Please.

720
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:13,008
I have some other plans for tomorrow.

721
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:16,578
Not this.
- Please, book a table for tomorrow.

722
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:20,316
After that we will go
wherever you want. Promise,

723
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,590
Promise?
- Promise. Wherever you say.

724
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:26,391
You will do whatever I say?
- Anything.

725
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:29,297
What about...

726
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:33,232
Shut up.
- What? Come on.

727
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:34,965
No.

728
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:46,378
Hi. What are you doing?

729
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:48,209
Proofs. What else?

730
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:50,277
Have a look.
- Yes.

731
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:53,923
You know what, Sonali?

732
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:58,527
I was thinking of using these
proofs in a different manner this time.

733
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:02,291
In fact, we shouldn't use them.

734
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,158
What?
- Yes.

735
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:06,637
I have a plan.
- Okay.

736
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,170
Do you want to hear it?
- Yes.

737
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:09,671
Come on.
- Let's go.

738
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:14,070
Sonali. You know I
have met Mrs. Pereira.

739
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:16,008
And she's a really-really sweet lady.

740
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,740
So I was thinking, instead of
getting Mr. And Mrs. Pereira divorced...

741
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:24,420
...why don't we break
Mark and Maggie's pair?

742
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:27,557
At least Mrs. Pereira will have
a chance of saving her marriage.

743
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,988
Because she is sure Mark
will come back to her.

744
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:34,291
So, what do you think?

745
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:37,529
Are you sure?

746
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:40,671
No, I too am not sure.

747
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,369
But I feel that this is
the right thing to do.

748
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:46,266
Looks like your bum
has started beating,

749
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:49,771
It's your fundamental, right?

750
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:52,447
That marriage is the
final destination of love.

751
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,984
So, I thought that this time
we should unite the love birds.

752
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,078
And save Mark from the shopping mall.
What do you say? - Okay.

753
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,088
Let's go.

754
00:43:00,558 --> 00:43:03,254
Mrs. Pereira, other than
being Mark's life partner...

755
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:05,261
...is also his business partner.

756
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:07,761
In fact, she is going
to come here next week...

757
00:43:08,032 --> 00:43:10,466
...to attend a business
conference with Mark.

758
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:14,502
What if Mrs. Pereira
comes a week early?

759
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,802
Sonali, you are very slow.

760
00:43:19,577 --> 00:43:20,669
Why?

761
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:22,109
Hi, Mrs. Pereira.

762
00:43:28,052 --> 00:43:29,349
What do you think?

763
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:55,305
Hello, Mark.

764
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:58,370
Coffee.

765
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:04,053
You take such good care
of my likes and dislikes.

766
00:44:06,857 --> 00:44:08,256
What are you doing here?

767
00:44:09,694 --> 00:44:13,425
Don't worry, Mark. I am not
here to spoil your honeymoon.

768
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:17,092
I called you a number of times.
You didn't answer any.

769
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:20,063
The meeting we were
to have with Costa...

770
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:21,695
...is taking place today.

771
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:24,472
If the deal is not signed
today then I don't know.

772
00:44:25,276 --> 00:44:28,177
So you know what? Enjoy your coffee.

773
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:31,548
Call me.

774
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:39,620
Mark.
- Yeah?

775
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:51,565
What is this, Mark?

776
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,362
You had promised me that...

777
00:44:54,438 --> 00:44:56,463
...you will come with me for
the opening of Club Medusa.

778
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:59,508
I know. I know, Maggie. But
I have to go to Athens today.

779
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,441
Costa is leaving for Germany tonight.

780
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:04,345
And I cannot skip this meeting.
Please try and understand.

781
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:06,447
I don't want to understand anything.

782
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,677
You had promised "no work".

783
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:12,979
Maggie.

784
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:18,160
Maggie, one last meeting.

785
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:22,590
Trust me. - You are
saying this. How would I know?

786
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:24,663
Baby, it's important.

787
00:45:24,735 --> 00:45:26,430
You know I wouldn't
have gone otherwise.

788
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:28,266
Right?
- Fine. Go.

789
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:29,528
Go for sure.

790
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,371
But remember I won't
change my program.

791
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:35,744
I'll go there alone.

792
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:37,444
You wait and see.

793
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:41,309
Mark.

794
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,611
I'll go there alone and dance. And
I'll also flirt with Greek boys.

795
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:47,351
I'd like to see that.

796
00:45:47,558 --> 00:45:49,025
Do make a video of it.

797
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:50,657
Let's go.
- Mark.

798
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:26,829
Wait forjust two minutes. I
have opened many such locks.

799
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:28,222
This lock...
- Excuse me. - Yes?

800
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:31,166
Hi. We left our keys inside.
Could you please help us?

801
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:33,366
Okay. No problem, madam.
- Yeah.

I'll open it for you.

803
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:35,697
Just a moment.

804
00:46:35,806 --> 00:46:37,535
Thank you. I'm really sorry.

805
00:46:37,641 --> 00:46:39,336
It's okay.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

806
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,345
My wife keeps forgetting the keys.
- It's okay. No problem. - Thank you.

807
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:45,313
I'll open it for you. For your wife.
- Thank you.

808
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:46,246
Thank you.
- Bye.

809
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:47,341
Bye.
- Bye.

810
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:53,553
Hello. Yeah, I'm
calling from Villa 214.

811
00:46:53,891 --> 00:46:55,722
I would like to book a
massage for tonight.

812
00:46:56,193 --> 00:46:57,387
Yeah, around nine.

813
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,592
Yeah, one more thing.

814
00:46:59,864 --> 00:47:02,492
I want the hottest
masseur that you guys have.

815
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,165
Yeah? Thank you.

816
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:07,099
What was that? What?

817
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:09,901
Okay. How dense of me.

818
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:11,399
I'll just be back.

819
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,272
You are mad.

820
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:08,457
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen and welcome to Club Medusa.

And we bring to you the
super hot babe from Bollywood.

this stage with her super hot...

824
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:20,495
...super sexy and super cool number.

825
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:22,399
Bipasha.

826
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,475
So ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Maggie.

827
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:32,773
"Come on."

828
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,172
"Yeah."

829
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:35,309
"Come on."

830
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:36,585
"Just like that."

831
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,382
"I love you."

832
00:49:46,196 --> 00:49:48,460
"Love sets desire on fire."

833
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:50,829
"I hope Bipasha doesn't catch one."

834
00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:57,601
"Everyone here has laid a trap."

835
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,972
"I hope Bipasha doesn't get trapped."

836
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:08,813
"Everybody. Everybody
come on, shake a leg."

837
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:13,016
"Why don't you create a scene?"

838
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:18,024
"I know... I know you
are different than me."

839
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:22,627
"No, I won't give you false hope."

840
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:25,463
"Never going to get her, baby.
Never going to get her, baby."

841
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:27,560
"Bipasha."

842
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:29,866
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."

843
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,340
"Bipasha."

844
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:34,467
"Come, make your dreams come true."

845
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:36,773
"Bipasha."

846
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,007
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."

847
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:40,307
"I am not so easy."

848
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:41,543
"I am not so easy."

849
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:45,247
"You can never ever get Bipasha."

850
00:50:57,901 --> 00:51:02,429
"Come, my breath
will set you on fire."

851
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:07,033
"Come, my beauty will drown you."

852
00:51:07,277 --> 00:51:11,737
"Come, no force will be useful."

853
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:16,047
"Come, you will regret
once you are in my arms."

854
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:18,277
"Talk to your nave heart."

855
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:20,914
"Get rid of your trouble."

856
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:29,923
"Anyone who fell in love
with me will regret it."

857
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:34,630
"Never going to get her, baby.
Never going to get her, baby."

858
00:51:34,738 --> 00:51:36,831
"Bipasha."

859
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,965
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."

860
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,636
"Bipasha."

861
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:43,646
"Come, make your dreams come true."

862
00:51:43,714 --> 00:51:45,944
"Bipasha."

863
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:48,075
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."

864
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:49,444
"I am not so easy."

865
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,748
"I am not so easy."

866
00:51:50,821 --> 00:51:54,382
"You can never ever get Bipasha."

867
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:05,059
"Bips, you got the eyes,
you got the lips."

868
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:07,462
"Now come on, shake your hips."

869
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:09,663
"You got the moves,
you got the grooves."

870
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:14,836
"I cannot control myself anymore."

871
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:16,812
"Now come on, shake your hips."

872
00:52:16,914 --> 00:52:18,882
"You got the moves,
you got the groove."

873
00:52:18,982 --> 00:52:21,473
"You are magic, Bipasha."

874
00:52:21,552 --> 00:52:23,543
"You are mesmerizing, Bipasha."

875
00:52:23,654 --> 00:52:25,815
"You are intoxicating, Bipasha."

876
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:30,383
"You are amazing."

877
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:34,727
"Go, you won't be able to love."

878
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:39,462
"Go, you won't be
able to live with me."

879
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:43,904
"Go, you will die for no reason."

880
00:52:43,974 --> 00:52:48,104
"Go, you will burn."

881
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:50,403
"Talk to your nave heart."

882
00:52:50,514 --> 00:52:52,880
"Get rid of your trouble."

883
00:52:57,654 --> 00:53:02,421
"Anyone who fell in love
with me will regret it."

884
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:06,794
"Never going to get her, baby.
Never going to get her, baby."

885
00:53:06,897 --> 00:53:08,956
"Bipasha."

886
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:11,124
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."

887
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:13,669
"Bipasha."

888
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,829
"Come, make your dreams come true."

889
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:18,500
"Bipasha."

890
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:20,634
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."

891
00:53:20,744 --> 00:53:23,008
"I am not so easy."

892
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:25,547
"You can never ever get Bipasha."

893
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:16,099
Madam, you ordered a massage?

894
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,698
I didn't order any massage.

895
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:19,762
Madam, we have a caller ID.

896
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:21,527
The call was made from your room.

897
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:24,406
Look, I didn't order for any massage.

898
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,031
There must be some confusion.

899
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:27,235
But anyway...

900
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:32,041
This is for you. You may leave.

901
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:33,548
What a lovely lady.

902
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:34,842
Thank you, madam.

903
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:36,312
You are welcome.

904
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:41,388
So how was it? You had fun without me?

905
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:43,250
Yes, I had a lot of fun.

906
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:45,557
Greek men are stupendous.
- I saw.

907
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:49,424
The man you were
paying looked like a stud.

908
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:55,266
He? He said that someone from
our villa ordered for a massage.

909
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:57,396
Yeah, sure. Massage.

910
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:01,436
Wait a minute. You doubt me?

911
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:03,638
I don't doubt you. I am sure about it.

912
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:07,348
After an amazing dance one
needs an amazing massage, right?

913
00:55:08,285 --> 00:55:09,752
What the hell are you talking about?

914
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,311
That I'm not a fool.

915
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:13,886
What? How could...

916
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:16,218
Mark!

917
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:17,686
Mark!

918
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:19,827
Mark!

919
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:22,354
Mark!

920
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:23,433
Mark!

921
00:55:26,703 --> 00:55:28,295
What is wrong with you?

922
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,740
What is this?
- What?

923
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,744
Do you have an
explanation for this affair?

924
00:56:09,413 --> 00:56:10,437
Mark.

925
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:15,351
Mark, what's wrong? Mark.

926
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:18,452
Maggie, I don't want to hear it.

927
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,450
I can't believe this.

928
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:23,758
I don't want to deal with it.

929
00:56:27,464 --> 00:56:29,227
Mark. Mark.

930
00:56:56,626 --> 00:56:57,718
You are here like this?

931
00:56:58,395 --> 00:56:59,692
What happened, Mark?

932
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:01,628
Can I...

933
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:05,657
Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course. Please, come in.

934
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:17,573
Don't worry, baby.
Everything will be fine.

935
00:57:18,782 --> 00:57:22,718
Anyway, finally all that
matters is that you are with me.

936
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:25,878
Mark, your drink.

937
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:38,527
Take it.
- Sorry.

938
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:42,903
Hello.

939
00:57:43,573 --> 00:57:44,699
Yes.

940
00:57:50,013 --> 00:57:51,139
That's good.

941
00:57:51,248 --> 00:57:54,445
Congratulations. Have a
great time. Enjoy yourself.

942
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:56,244
Bye.

943
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:57,343
Got it. Yes!

944
00:57:57,454 --> 00:57:59,422
What?
- Congratulations.

945
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:01,957
Mr. And Mrs. Pereira
are back together.

946
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:04,716
It's time to celebrate, right?
- Yeah.

947
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:06,688
Excuse me. Yeah. Hi.

948
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:08,397
Can I have a bottle
of champagne, please?

949
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:10,466
Hey, hey, hey. No champagne for me.

950
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,730
Why? - I become a different
person when I drink Champagne.

951
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:17,132
It's good. We will get to
see another form of Sonali.

952
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,605
Sonali No. 3. It's good.

953
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:20,266
Yeah, right.

954
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:23,143
Oh, that was quick. Thank you.

955
00:58:24,314 --> 00:58:25,747
Thank you very much.

956
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:27,238
Close your eyes.

957
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:28,381
Voila.

958
00:58:29,319 --> 00:58:32,083
Okay, so cheers to our great victory.

959
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:33,383
Come on, lift it.

960
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:36,216
Sid, you are in trouble.

961
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:37,653
You won't be able to handle me.

962
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:38,659
Really?

963
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:40,127
So it's a challenge?

964
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,754
Fine. Game's on.

965
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:43,698
Fine. Cheers.

966
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,627
Don't say that I didn't warn you.

967
00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:47,327
Okay?
- Okay, done.

968
00:58:53,777 --> 00:58:55,142
Let's party.

969
00:58:55,779 --> 00:58:57,007
Come on.

970
00:58:57,981 --> 00:58:59,209
Okay.
- Come on.

971
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:06,578
Come on.

972
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:13,193
Tell me about your first crush.

973
00:59:13,263 --> 00:59:16,255
My first crush was Rasna Orange Crush.

974
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:18,558
No.

975
00:59:18,668 --> 00:59:20,295
Tell me about your first love.

976
00:59:21,438 --> 00:59:22,735
My first love.

977
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,541
My seventh grade history teacher,
Mrs. Mathews.

978
00:59:28,645 --> 00:59:32,172
Long hair, big eyes.

979
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:36,441
An amazing smile that
would make you happy, you know.

980
00:59:36,753 --> 00:59:42,089
And the most beautiful,
sweet lips in the world.

981
00:59:42,192 --> 00:59:43,489
Lips.

982
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:45,089
Better than mine.

983
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:47,129
Of course.

984
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:49,191
Let me have a look. Don't move.

985
00:59:49,299 --> 00:59:50,561
Don't move. Don't move. Okay?

986
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:02,609
Actually, your lips are
very beautiful as well.

987
01:00:03,246 --> 01:00:06,682
But Mrs. Mathews' lips
were something else.

988
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:09,010
Rubbish.
- Really.

989
01:00:11,588 --> 01:00:13,351
Champagne is over.

990
01:00:13,456 --> 01:00:15,321
Hello.
- Hello.

991
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:16,585
Nice man.

992
01:00:18,194 --> 01:00:20,924
Take this and give us one
more of this, please. - Yes.

993
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:22,621
Sorry, lady, but the bar is closed.

994
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:27,201
Come on. One last drink, my
friend from Greece. - Please.

995
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:29,067
Sorry. Good night.

996
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:32,474
Let's do one thing.
Let's use our Indian tactics.

997
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,100
Let's try it.
- Try it. Come on.

998
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:36,710
Hey listen, I will
give you this 100 Euros...

999
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,915
...and this pretty, sweet
lady with luscious lips...

1000
01:00:39,983 --> 01:00:42,417
...will give you a kiss.
- Hey.

1001
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:44,517
I can't do that.
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

1002
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:46,384
One has to sacrifice to party.

1003
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:48,116
This is nothing. Do it. Do it. Do it.

1004
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:51,991
Okay. I will take the money.
- Thank you.

1005
01:00:52,262 --> 01:00:54,594
Only, I don't want a kiss from her.

1006
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:56,325
Okay. Fine.

1007
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:57,928
I want a kiss from you.

1008
01:00:59,536 --> 01:01:00,969
I won't do it. I won't.

1009
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,166
You have to sacrifice a
little to party. - This is rape.

1010
01:01:06,276 --> 01:01:07,641
He will do it.
- Hey, I...

1011
01:01:12,148 --> 01:01:13,740
Thank you.

1012
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:17,313
Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting.

1013
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:18,648
Give it to me.
- No.

1014
01:01:18,755 --> 01:01:20,120
Just a minute, please.

1015
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:23,556
Hey! You are wasting it.

1016
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:27,259
It is wasted.
The entire evening got ruined.

1017
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:30,529
I kissed him and you are
drinking the champagne.

1018
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:31,964
Give it to me.

1019
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:33,461
Thank you.

1020
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:37,535
Today's scene was very good.
- Scene?

1021
01:01:37,674 --> 01:01:42,441
But you are such a lousy kisser.

1022
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:43,705
Yuck.

1023
01:01:44,748 --> 01:01:46,579
I'm a lousy kisser?

1024
01:01:46,783 --> 01:01:51,049
You would make a similar face if
you had to kiss a foolish girl.

1025
01:01:51,187 --> 01:01:53,747
And as far as my kissing
capabilities are concerned...

1026
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:56,785
You can ask 24 girlfriends of mine.
They will vouch for it.

1027
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,550
Really?
- Yes.

1028
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:00,151
Are you a kissing expert?

1029
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,663
I am. I am. Yes, I am.

1030
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:03,130
Okay.

1031
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:09,536
Fine then, tell me what
the best part of kissing is.

1032
01:02:15,412 --> 01:02:16,504
Disgusting.

1033
01:02:16,613 --> 01:02:23,212
The best part of kissing is
exactly a moment before the kiss.

1034
01:02:23,486 --> 01:02:24,612
Really?

1035
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:28,122
When you don't know
whether you will kiss or not.

1036
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:31,025
If you do, how will it be.

1037
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:34,789
Will the other
person agree to it or not.

1038
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:36,796
That moment.

1039
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:41,433
Who waits a moment before a kiss?

1040
01:02:41,538 --> 01:02:43,597
I just get to work. I get into it.

1041
01:02:43,706 --> 01:02:45,037
No.

1042
01:02:45,141 --> 01:02:46,574
Seriously.
- Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. No.

1043
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:48,142
I will show you.
- Show it to me. Show it to me.

1044
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:49,235
Look here.

1045
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:52,512
No glasses.

1046
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:54,310
Where are you?
- Right here.

1047
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:56,675
Okay, now don't move.
- Okay.

1048
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:04,459
When two people are this close...
- Oh my.

1049
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:07,389
Then their eyes meet.

1050
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,498
Then they look at the lips.

1051
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:18,266
When two people are this close...

1052
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:24,740
They can feel each other breathing.
- I can. I can.

1053
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:29,182
Their heads bend a little.

1054
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:33,749
Then their eyes close.
- Yes.

1055
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:36,725
And then that moment...

1056
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:43,658
But Mrs. Mathews'
lips are something else.

1057
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:45,291
Shut up. Go to her then.

1058
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:47,431
Hey, hey, hey. Listen.
- What happened?

1059
01:03:47,537 --> 01:03:48,731
There is a problem.
- What happened?

1060
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:50,563
There is a lizard in my room.

1061
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:52,735
I hate lizards.

1062
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:55,034
Me too.
- I won't sleep in my room.

1063
01:03:55,145 --> 01:03:56,635
Okay.
- I am sleeping in your room.

1064
01:03:57,147 --> 01:03:59,308
Fine. I will sleep on the couch.

1065
01:03:59,415 --> 01:04:00,575
And you can sleep on the couch.

1066
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:02,207
Okay.
- What am I saying?

1067
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:05,014
Sorry. I will sleep on the couch
and you can sleep on the couch.

1068
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,283
Let's go.
- Very good idea. Let's go.

1069
01:04:24,407 --> 01:04:25,999
Sonali, can I ask you something?

1070
01:04:27,343 --> 01:04:28,970
You are so beautiful.

1071
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:30,641
You are smart.

1072
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:34,442
You are talented. Etcetera. Etcetera.

1073
01:04:35,518 --> 01:04:37,645
How come you are still single?

1074
01:04:40,123 --> 01:04:43,991
You know I believe in fairy tales.

1075
01:04:45,128 --> 01:04:47,688
I still didn't find
my charming prince.

1076
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:51,290
But I haven't stopped looking.

1077
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:53,660
Soon I will find him.

1078
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,037
I will see for how long
he will stay away from me.

1079
01:04:56,973 --> 01:04:58,600
Yes, look for him. Look for him.

1080
01:04:59,142 --> 01:05:03,442
But Sonali, don't look for a loser.

1081
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:08,583
Who keeps an account of every
moment and every penny, in life.

1082
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:12,352
You know who is very selfish.

1083
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:18,053
We will surely go to
uncle's place because he is rich.

1084
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:22,461
No need to call aunt at home.
She has no class.

1085
01:05:23,366 --> 01:05:25,630
We will surely attend our
new neighbor's birthday party.

1086
01:05:25,735 --> 01:05:29,102
Because a lot of influential
people come to their place.

1087
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:32,367
Meet him. Don't meet him.

1088
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:37,035
Let me tell you Sonali...

1089
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:40,048
...don't fall in love with an
"I Me Myself" kind of a person.

1090
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:44,576
Who always keep an
account of everything.

1091
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:47,716
I made that mistake.

1092
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:51,151
I was in love.

1093
01:05:54,731 --> 01:06:00,431
And after two months love
ended and accounting started.

1094
01:06:03,406 --> 01:06:10,141
Sonali, when your heart breaks,
it hurts a lot.

1095
01:06:11,581 --> 01:06:13,208
It's hell.

1096
01:06:15,718 --> 01:06:21,315
It feels as a hand has ripped
your heart apart from your body.

1097
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:27,121
Hey.

1098
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,424
Sonali.

1099
01:06:29,999 --> 01:06:31,466
Wait a minute.

1100
01:06:32,402 --> 01:06:37,704
Sonali. What happened
to your special moment?

1101
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:40,435
I missed it.

1102
01:06:41,244 --> 01:06:42,734
Let's do it again.

1103
01:06:58,094 --> 01:07:04,499
Sonali, is there really
a lizard in your room?

1104
01:07:06,736 --> 01:07:08,260
It's right in front of me.

1105
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:41,796
My dear ex-husband, thank you.

1106
01:07:43,206 --> 01:07:45,265
You are now free.

1107
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:48,207
Your days of alimony are over.

1108
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:50,102
Congratulations.

1109
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:54,478
Thank you my dear ex husband.

1110
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,675
Had it not been for you then
it was not possible for me...

1111
01:07:56,753 --> 01:07:58,880
...to separate Marc and
Mrs. Magi Pereira.

1112
01:07:59,322 --> 01:08:01,722
Now Marc is mine and Honey is yours.

1113
01:08:28,179 --> 01:08:30,147
Isha! Isha! Isha!

1114
01:08:30,214 --> 01:08:31,112
Sorry. Isha.

1115
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:32,948
Sid. When did you return?
And what are you doing here?

1116
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,109
I am here to eat 'Pani Puri' (snacks).

1117
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,641
Why is your phone switched off?

1118
01:08:35,753 --> 01:08:36,981
I've been trying to
call you since so long.

1119
01:08:37,088 --> 01:08:38,680
Have you lost your mind?
An operation is going on.

1120
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:39,654
Forget him.

1121
01:08:39,757 --> 01:08:40,917
The real emergency is in my life.

1122
01:08:41,025 --> 01:08:43,550
I'll have a cardiac
arrest if you don't help me.

1123
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,593
Shut up, Sid and leave.

1124
01:08:44,696 --> 01:08:45,822
I'll call you after 2 hours.

1125
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:46,624
Go.
- No. No. No.

1126
01:08:46,698 --> 01:08:48,131
Isha, listen to me. - Leave.
I don't want to hear anything.

1127
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:49,460
Have you lost your mind? Leave.
- At least listen to me.

1128
01:08:49,534 --> 01:08:50,933
An operation...
- I had sex with Sonali.

1129
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:54,060
What?
- What?

1130
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:55,967
I mean I had sex with Sonali.

1131
01:08:56,074 --> 01:08:57,598
I mean damn, yeah.

1132
01:08:57,742 --> 01:08:58,436
What? - Yeah.

1133
01:08:58,543 --> 01:09:01,103
You had sex with Sonali?
- Yeah. Who are you?

1134
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,540
Oh, Dr. Khurana. How are you doing?
What are you doing here?

1135
01:09:04,649 --> 01:09:06,776
Should I give you four options?
- No. It's obvious.

1136
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,045
How's your life after divorce?

1137
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,881
I hope your new wife doesn't beat you.

1138
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,213
I mean... Look, our
clients found out everything.

1139
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:14,116
What should I do now?

1140
01:09:14,225 --> 01:09:15,487
Will you calm down and relax.

1141
01:09:15,593 --> 01:09:17,185
We will talk after
the operation. Okay?

1142
01:09:17,261 --> 01:09:18,125
Calm down? Relax?

1143
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:19,753
What if Sonali falls in love with me?

1144
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:22,698
And worse, what if she holds
me responsible for all this?

1145
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,267
Just shut up. You also know that
Sonali is not that kind of a girl.

1146
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:25,695
Yes, but she is a girl.

1147
01:09:25,803 --> 01:09:27,600
And girls cannot be trusted
when it comes to this.

1148
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:28,194
Right.
- Right?

1149
01:09:28,506 --> 01:09:29,768
You are absolutely right, my friend.

1150
01:09:30,508 --> 01:09:32,840
At first my wife was my friend.

1151
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,011
One night after we got drunk...

1152
01:09:35,613 --> 01:09:36,637
And after that...

1153
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:37,845
Shit.

1154
01:09:37,949 --> 01:09:40,281
Such a big punishment
for getting sloshed once?

1155
01:09:40,518 --> 01:09:42,713
Right. See. I told you.
I... I am doomed.

1156
01:09:42,854 --> 01:09:45,015
Sir, by the way if you want a
divorce you should get in touch with me.

1157
01:09:45,123 --> 01:09:46,556
I'm really good at this. - Really?
- Will you stop this nonsense?

1158
01:09:46,658 --> 01:09:47,989
And you should stop overreacting.

1159
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:50,050
I am overreacting?
- This is what all the men do.

1160
01:09:50,161 --> 01:09:51,219
First they have all the fun...

1161
01:09:51,496 --> 01:09:53,487
...and they back out when it is
time to shoulder the responsibility.

1162
01:09:53,598 --> 01:09:55,259
Okay. Okay. Do only we men
have all the fun? - Yes.

1163
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,195
You women also have just as much fun.
- Yes.

1164
01:09:57,301 --> 01:09:58,859
After that they all act
innocent by doing this.

1165
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,268
Dr. Kelkar, how dare you?
- Like this.

1166
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:03,769
Disgusting. After all the education
your thinking has still not changed.

1167
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,103
You bloody male chauvinist pig.

1168
01:10:05,209 --> 01:10:06,540
Pig?
- Yes. - Please.

1169
01:10:06,778 --> 01:10:08,507
Can we concentrate on the operation?

1170
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:09,773
Dr. Khurana, please keep quiet.

1171
01:10:09,881 --> 01:10:11,746
You get beaten up by your
wife at home. - What? What?

1172
01:10:11,849 --> 01:10:12,873
What are you saying?
- How can you say that?

1173
01:10:12,984 --> 01:10:14,110
What do you know about it?
- I just found out.

1174
01:10:14,218 --> 01:10:15,845
That is his job.
- Dr. Kelkar, how can you.

1175
01:10:15,953 --> 01:10:16,885
A fight at home doesn't mean...

1176
01:10:16,954 --> 01:10:19,081
Keep quiet. Dr. Khurana, you...
- Quiet.

1177
01:10:19,624 --> 01:10:20,784
Stop your nonsense.

1178
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:23,650
For how long can a patient be patient?

1179
01:10:23,895 --> 01:10:26,557
And you are playing with my life?
- No, sir.

1180
01:10:26,731 --> 01:10:28,961
Do you think this is
child's play? Fool.

1181
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,329
And you? Idiot.
- Yes, sir. Sorry.

1182
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,001
You are standing here
and wasting your time.

1183
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:35,095
Go to that girl and talk to her.

1184
01:10:35,173 --> 01:10:38,904
Specifically discuss it with
her and find out what she feels.

1185
01:10:39,877 --> 01:10:43,244
And you idiots, concentrate on
the operation. - Right, sir.

1186
01:10:43,548 --> 01:10:45,914
Do you know how much
money I have spent?

1187
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:50,543
I tell you, nothing can be done
for the medical services in India.

1188
01:10:50,755 --> 01:10:53,189
Come on, start the operation.
I've loads more to do. - Okay.

1189
01:10:57,695 --> 01:10:58,320
What is this, man?

1190
01:10:58,596 --> 01:11:01,292
Ever since you have returned
from Greece you stay quiet.

1191
01:11:01,566 --> 01:11:03,659
Tell me something. How are
the sexy babes of that place?

1192
01:11:03,768 --> 01:11:06,134
They are hot, right?
- Nano, my brother, I've a request.

1193
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,899
For a while don't talk about
sex or anything related to that.

1194
01:11:10,007 --> 01:11:13,204
Just say that I should
keep quiet for a while. - Yes.

1195
01:11:13,277 --> 01:11:15,370
That's what I am saying,
keep quiet for a while.

1196
01:11:15,613 --> 01:11:17,672
Just one thing. Please tell me.
- Shut up, Nano. Please, man.

1197
01:11:17,782 --> 01:11:18,646
Hi, guys.

1198
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,784
Hi.
- Hey, Sonali.

1199
01:11:20,918 --> 01:11:21,942
You know, how was Greece?

1200
01:11:22,053 --> 01:11:24,385
I heard the sexy babes there...
- Shut up!

1201
01:11:25,857 --> 01:11:28,917
Sid. Sid, I want to talk to you.

1202
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,952
Actually, me too. Thank God.
- Mr. Sid...

1203
01:11:31,062 --> 01:11:32,620
Yes?
- Mr. Tejani is here.

1204
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:35,724
Who Tejani? - You gave him
an appointment for today.

1205
01:11:39,303 --> 01:11:41,362
I am fed up of my wife.

1206
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,333
There is no love between us.

1207
01:11:43,407 --> 01:11:46,001
And no relationship
since the last two years.

1208
01:11:47,044 --> 01:11:48,341
Any special reason for all this?

1209
01:11:48,646 --> 01:11:51,672
Sweety. She works in my office.

1210
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:54,349
And we were friends
at first and then...

1211
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:57,047
One night in an office
party we got madly drunk

1212
01:11:57,155 --> 01:11:58,918
and then you know what happened.

1213
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,949
And now we are totally inseparable.

1214
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:01,956
We are in love.

1215
01:12:02,059 --> 01:12:03,686
And we want to get married.
- No!

1216
01:12:04,128 --> 01:12:06,028
No. You shouldn't do that.

1217
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:07,427
Excuse me? I am sorry?

1218
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,393
No, no. You will be
sorry if you get married.

1219
01:12:10,067 --> 01:12:12,433
You see we sometimes
get drunk and then...

1220
01:12:13,104 --> 01:12:16,096
...do some things which
we shouldn't, you know.

1221
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:18,437
And you can
apologize for that, you know.

1222
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,176
Marriage is not a
solution for all these things.

1223
01:12:20,278 --> 01:12:23,111
But Sid, I really love Sweety.

1224
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,842
Mr. Tejani, you don't
need to feel guilty.

1225
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,248
And you don't need
to apologize either.

1226
01:12:28,452 --> 01:12:31,182
Both of you were drunk.
You didn't force her for it.

1227
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:33,020
Thank God.
- What are you saying?

1228
01:12:33,124 --> 01:12:36,389
I really love Sweety.
What are you saying?

1229
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:39,459
Listen, forget about love.
Let's get down to business.

1230
01:12:39,764 --> 01:12:41,425
Both of you work together.
In the same office. - Yes.

1231
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:44,724
If you get married what will
your clients think about you?

1232
01:12:44,836 --> 01:12:45,928
Your business will get ruined, right?

1233
01:12:46,037 --> 01:12:47,698
We work in a garments company.

1234
01:12:47,805 --> 01:12:49,238
What does that have to
do with our marriage?

1235
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,808
Forget about work.
What about friendship?

1236
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,399
You know both of you
have so much fun together.

1237
01:12:53,477 --> 01:12:54,910
You go around.

1238
01:12:55,146 --> 01:12:56,773
Everything will be
over after marriage.

1239
01:12:56,881 --> 01:12:59,008
Yeah. I mean totally. Totally. Really.

1240
01:12:59,116 --> 01:13:00,276
Stop your nonsense.

1241
01:13:00,351 --> 01:13:02,444
Do you stop people from
getting married or get them divorced?

1242
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,120
You guys are totally out
of sync, man. What the hell!

1243
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,292
God.

1244
01:13:11,128 --> 01:13:14,291
This is our first
failure out of 112 cases.

1245
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,359
What are we doing, Sonali?

1246
01:13:18,336 --> 01:13:22,136
Forget it, Sid. Anyway, we weren't
going to do this after marriage.

1247
01:13:22,807 --> 01:13:23,466
What?

1248
01:13:25,243 --> 01:13:27,837
Will we get people
divorced after we get married?

1249
01:13:28,813 --> 01:13:31,043
Good that you didn't let
Tejani find out anything.

1250
01:13:31,482 --> 01:13:33,746
Let's keep the
wedding low profile, okay?

1251
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:36,913
By the way, how does
the 18th suit you?

1252
01:13:39,156 --> 01:13:40,748
Sid. 18th.

1253
01:13:41,425 --> 01:13:42,483
Sonali...

1254
01:13:46,063 --> 01:13:47,052
That...

1255
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,226
You were joking.

1256
01:13:53,037 --> 01:13:55,301
Got you.
- Wow. Oh, my God. Yes!

1257
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:56,498
Got you again.
- Got me again.

1258
01:13:56,774 --> 01:13:57,968
What do I do with you?

1259
01:14:00,878 --> 01:14:03,244
You are not that good that
I'll fall in love with you.

1260
01:14:04,515 --> 01:14:06,278
Thanks for the compliment.

1261
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,842
I need another drink. Nano!

1262
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:24,494
Thanks, buddy.

1263
01:14:24,769 --> 01:14:25,793
That was actually a naughty one.

1264
01:14:44,555 --> 01:14:47,115
Hey, Isha. You were absolutely right.

1265
01:14:47,224 --> 01:14:48,885
Sonali isn't like other girls.

1266
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,427
She is really quite out
of the world, I tell you.

1267
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:53,156
You know she didn't
speak about that night.

1268
01:14:53,297 --> 01:14:54,423
She's really cool.

1269
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:55,558
What?

1270
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,794
What happened?

1271
01:15:00,104 --> 01:15:00,866
Hey.

1272
01:15:01,005 --> 01:15:02,996
Hi. Sorry. This is a
little embarrassing. I was...

1273
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,989
I don't know whether
you'd understand this or not.

1274
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,228
Sonali, I really had to do it.

1275
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:32,368
This woman had everything.
My money, my car.

1276
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:35,564
I mean the alimony was
killing me. I had no other choice.

1277
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,471
I hope you understand.

1278
01:15:41,545 --> 01:15:43,103
I know you won't understand.

1279
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:46,141
And perhaps that's
why I didn't tell you.

1280
01:15:46,617 --> 01:15:49,347
Come on, Sonali. We
have seen so many couples.

1281
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,077
Does anyone stay happy after marriage?

1282
01:15:51,188 --> 01:15:52,177
Do they?

1283
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,953
What difference does it
make if Mark and Maggie spilt?

1284
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,391
What difference does
it make to anyone?

1285
01:15:58,529 --> 01:16:00,087
There is no such thing called love.

1286
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,232
I... am trying to make her understand.

1287
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:09,531
Now I get it.

1288
01:16:10,374 --> 01:16:11,466
You are pulling my leg again, right?

1289
01:16:11,575 --> 01:16:12,906
Like this. Like this.

1290
01:16:14,412 --> 01:16:16,437
I got you. I got you this time.

1291
01:16:16,547 --> 01:16:19,072
I am not falling for it this time.

1292
01:16:20,518 --> 01:16:22,042
Why doesn't she say anything?

1293
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,518
Why are you quiet, goddamn it?

1294
01:16:27,525 --> 01:16:29,618
We have spilt a lot
of couples, together.

1295
01:16:31,395 --> 01:16:32,589
But I didn't know...

1296
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,600
...the last one will be ours.

1297
01:16:38,903 --> 01:16:39,995
I quit, Sid.

1298
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:48,643
Fine!

1299
01:17:33,324 --> 01:17:34,256
Hey.

1300
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:36,119
Why aren't you answering the phone?

1301
01:17:36,227 --> 01:17:38,752
Forget it. - We've been looking
for you since the last three hours.

1302
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,223
It's okay.
- Enough. You've had enough. Get up.

1303
01:17:40,331 --> 01:17:41,525
No, don't do that. One more please.

1304
01:17:41,632 --> 01:17:44,123
Come on. Let's go home. Let's go.
- Let go. Leave me alone, Sahil.

1305
01:17:44,235 --> 01:17:46,328
I'm absolutely fine.
What's your problem?

1306
01:17:46,437 --> 01:17:48,029
Talk to him. I'm absolutely fine.

1307
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:49,264
I'm absolutely fine.

1308
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,772
I am okay.

1309
01:17:51,075 --> 01:17:52,599
If you want to be
rocking then look there.

1310
01:17:53,577 --> 01:17:55,272
Priya. Remember?

1311
01:17:55,446 --> 01:17:57,380
You chased her for six months.

1312
01:17:57,481 --> 01:17:59,005
Yes.
- Lucky dog.

1313
01:17:59,116 --> 01:18:01,778
And today you are
getting to be with her.

1314
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:03,246
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1315
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:05,316
Hey. Thanks.

1316
01:18:06,157 --> 01:18:06,748
Good luck, buddy.

1317
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,684
What?

1318
01:18:11,629 --> 01:18:15,690
I missed you, Sid.
Baby. Love you baby.

1319
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,328
Where were you?

1320
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:18,759
Sid.

1321
01:18:21,805 --> 01:18:23,033
Sid.

1322
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:26,268
Sonali, you are amazing.

1323
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,007
You are amazing, Sonali.

1324
01:18:28,379 --> 01:18:29,437
Sonali?

1325
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,075
Who's Sonali?

1326
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:45,258
I'm sorry.

1327
01:18:47,031 --> 01:18:48,191
Sid!

1328
01:19:10,087 --> 01:19:13,147
"The one which was beyond words."

1329
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,350
"The one who filled the void."

1330
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:22,330
"There was something between us."

1331
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:26,061
"How should I take this
relationship further?"

1332
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:29,139
"Should I end the tie?"

1333
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:35,076
"Or should I leave it, in between?"

1334
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:40,074
"A nameless relationship."

1335
01:19:45,122 --> 01:19:48,057
"A nameless relationship."

1336
01:19:48,292 --> 01:19:51,261
"It makes you restless."

1337
01:19:51,795 --> 01:19:57,199
"The one that cannot be expressed,
between us."

1338
01:19:58,235 --> 01:20:01,295
"Between us. Between us."

1339
01:20:01,538 --> 01:20:04,769
"Between us. Between us."

1340
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:10,177
"There was something between us."

1341
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,150
"Between us. Between us."

1342
01:20:14,285 --> 01:20:17,448
"Between us. Between us."

1343
01:20:17,755 --> 01:20:23,091
"There was something between us."

1344
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:28,992
"Oh, it's a special feeling."

1345
01:20:29,566 --> 01:20:32,433
"These moments between us."

1346
01:20:32,836 --> 01:20:36,328
"How will I live without you?"

1347
01:20:36,473 --> 01:20:39,271
"Between us."

1348
01:20:39,343 --> 01:20:41,504
"Oh, it's a special feeling."

1349
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:45,039
"These moments between us."

1350
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:49,144
"How will I live without you?"

1351
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:53,948
"Your image still lingers in my eyes."

1352
01:20:54,058 --> 01:21:02,557
"I cannot distance myself from
your memories even if I want to."

1353
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:09,830
"Your presence can be felt
even after you have left."

1354
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:14,875
"Why do you dwell in
my heart as a desire?"

1355
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,440
"Why do I think of you?"

1356
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:22,815
"Why do I end and then
I exist once again?"

1357
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:27,516
"Where have you brought me?"

1358
01:21:29,226 --> 01:21:32,195
"A nameless relationship."

1359
01:21:32,396 --> 01:21:35,297
"It makes you restless."

1360
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:41,565
"The one that cannot be expressed,
between us."

1361
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:46,500
Yes. Tell me, Nano.

1362
01:21:47,077 --> 01:21:48,806
Sid, quickly come to the hospital.

1363
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:50,546
Hospital? Why? What happened?

1364
01:21:50,981 --> 01:21:53,916
An operation. Don't
ask questions. Just rush.

1365
01:21:54,084 --> 01:21:56,018
Whose, Nano? Yes? Hello?

1366
01:21:56,186 --> 01:21:57,175
Nano!

1367
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:02,921
What happened?

1368
01:22:03,026 --> 01:22:04,857
What's the emergency?
Who isn't feeling well?

1369
01:22:05,829 --> 01:22:07,387
I have to do an open-heart surgery.

1370
01:22:07,898 --> 01:22:09,388
Who?
- You.

1371
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,831
Sit.
- Come on.

1372
01:22:10,934 --> 01:22:12,902
What are you doing?
- Quiet. - Keep quiet and sit.

1373
01:22:13,036 --> 01:22:14,094
Remain seated.
- What nonsense is this, guys?

1374
01:22:14,204 --> 01:22:16,229
Till we don't spilt your
heart open and show you...

1375
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,331
...you won't
understand who lies in it.

1376
01:22:18,442 --> 01:22:19,136
Who?

1377
01:22:19,209 --> 01:22:20,836
Sonali.
- Come on.

1378
01:22:20,944 --> 01:22:23,037
Look, I know that
you guys love me a lot.

1379
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,409
And you want to take care of me.

1380
01:22:24,515 --> 01:22:26,483
But this time you guys
are absolutely wrong.

1381
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:28,210
You guys are firing blind.
It's not so.

1382
01:22:28,352 --> 01:22:28,977
Oh really?
- Yes.

1383
01:22:29,086 --> 01:22:31,554
Sid, I've seen a fool bigger
than you when it comes to love.

1384
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:34,518
You sometimes give your heart
to Ira and sometimes to a car.

1385
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:36,252
Don't call it "any car".

1386
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,452
Yes, please. Horny.
- Don't call it a car.

1387
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:38,585
Both of you, keep quiet.

1388
01:22:38,862 --> 01:22:41,126
Come on, Sid. - Listen, I agree
that that incident has disturbed me.

1389
01:22:41,231 --> 01:22:43,529
But love? Not at all.

1390
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,392
And as far as my heart is
concerned it is beating just fine.

1391
01:22:45,536 --> 01:22:46,434
So, please, just stop it.

1392
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:47,366
Stop it, guys.

1393
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:48,562
Come on, guys.

1394
01:22:48,972 --> 01:22:51,406
Good, you at least
acknowledged that you have a heart.

1395
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,499
Otherwise until a few
days back it was your bum.

1396
01:22:53,644 --> 01:22:56,545
According to you, we aren't
doing an open-heart surgery on you...

1397
01:22:56,613 --> 01:22:58,308
...but an operation for piles.

1398
01:23:03,387 --> 01:23:04,411
Sid.

1399
01:23:05,923 --> 01:23:08,448
Look, for the first time in life...

1400
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:11,060
...you have given your
heart to the right girl.

1401
01:23:11,562 --> 01:23:13,029
Let it stay with her.

1402
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,191
She will take good care of it.

1403
01:23:18,168 --> 01:23:20,227
Won't you listen to
a heart specialist?

1404
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:24,097
Admit it. You are in love with Sonali.

1405
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:27,934
Congratulations, Doctor.

1406
01:23:29,146 --> 01:23:30,340
Operation successful.

1407
01:23:30,447 --> 01:23:32,278
I knew it.
- Really? - Yes!

1408
01:23:34,151 --> 01:23:36,051
Thanks, guys.

1409
01:23:36,687 --> 01:23:39,520
But I don't know about Sonali.

1410
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:41,523
We don't need to worry
about Sonali's feelings.

1411
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,593
She isn't confused like you

1412
01:23:43,927 --> 01:23:47,021
She knows that she hates you.
- Stop it.

1413
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:50,931
Tell me, did both of you
talk since the time she left?

1414
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:54,200
Any idea where she is
and how she is doing?

1415
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,006
So... It's okay.

1416
01:23:58,075 --> 01:23:59,042
Step one.

1417
01:23:59,109 --> 01:24:01,475
We'll find out where she
is and how she is doing.

1418
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:02,567
Come on. Let's do it.

1419
01:24:12,556 --> 01:24:15,423
Now Sonali doesn't get up in
the morning and go to the bar.

1420
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,990
She has chosen a healthy way of life.
- Five.

1421
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:21,155
'Om.'

1422
01:24:21,231 --> 01:24:23,631
Now she gets up every
morning and does yoga.

1423
01:24:23,901 --> 01:24:25,163
Six to eight.

1424
01:24:25,335 --> 01:24:28,065
In short, her life is
absolutely comfortable.

1425
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:30,605
'Om.'

1426
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:38,078
Sonali, no longer breaks marriages.

1427
01:24:38,181 --> 01:24:39,273
She breaks bones.

1428
01:24:41,018 --> 01:24:43,179
And I think she is very happy.

1429
01:24:52,563 --> 01:24:56,693
You know it this jogger's park
no one has a stamina like Sonali.

1430
01:24:57,067 --> 01:25:00,332
After doing yoga and
boxing the whole day...

1431
01:25:00,437 --> 01:25:02,462
...she runs here for
two years every evening.

1432
01:25:05,542 --> 01:25:07,601
And the speed with
which she is running...

1433
01:25:07,678 --> 01:25:09,202
...I don't think she needs anyone.

1434
01:25:09,446 --> 01:25:10,310
Hey...

1435
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,718
I was wrong. She doesn't hate you.

1436
01:25:16,954 --> 01:25:18,717
In fact, you are not
even a part of her life.

1437
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:20,616
You don't exist for her anymore.

1438
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:22,349
Shut up.

1439
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:23,752
You talk without thinking.

1440
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:25,651
Sid, try to understand.

1441
01:25:26,029 --> 01:25:28,725
She is doing all this so
that she can run away from you.

1442
01:25:29,232 --> 01:25:30,130
Exactly.

1443
01:25:30,233 --> 01:25:30,961
She isn't
running on a treadmill.

1444
01:25:31,034 --> 01:25:32,058
She is running away from you.

1445
01:25:35,105 --> 01:25:38,506
No, guys I think... this
idiot is right. - Yes.

1446
01:25:39,476 --> 01:25:42,104
She is over me. She
no longer needs me.

1447
01:25:42,379 --> 01:25:43,175
Don't be silly.

1448
01:25:43,246 --> 01:25:44,406
I'm fine. I'm okay with it.

1449
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:45,606
I really am.

1450
01:26:10,907 --> 01:26:12,898
Esha, I don't want to
come inside the hospital.

1451
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:14,271
Hey, come inside. I
will buy you coffee.

1452
01:26:14,778 --> 01:26:15,904
I will wait here for 10 minutes.

1453
01:26:15,979 --> 01:26:17,310
Hey, what is the problem?
Why are you doing drama?

1454
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:18,439
Hey, leave it.

1455
01:26:18,682 --> 01:26:20,115
I don't want to
leave the vehicle alone.

1456
01:26:20,183 --> 01:26:21,480
You and your vehicle.

1457
01:26:21,852 --> 01:26:23,444
I don't get it. Absolutely paranoid.

1458
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,879
Hey, nothing will happen
to your vehicle. Calm down.

1459
01:26:26,089 --> 01:26:27,021
It is doctor's parking, right?

1460
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:28,352
It is my first love.

1461
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:29,451
I know. But I don't get it.

1462
01:26:29,693 --> 01:26:31,320
You know today's patient...
- Yes.

1463
01:26:31,762 --> 01:26:33,286
His operation took
place a month or so ago.

1464
01:26:33,363 --> 01:26:34,455
This is his fourth follow-up.

1465
01:26:34,765 --> 01:26:35,925
He's just really paranoid.
- Okay.

1466
01:26:35,999 --> 01:26:37,330
But I am his doctor so what do I do?

1467
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:38,459
Sorry.

1468
01:26:39,436 --> 01:26:42,701
Mrs. Pereira. You are pregnant.
Please be careful.

1469
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:44,239
I am so sorry.
- Thank you.

1470
01:27:08,331 --> 01:27:10,128
I, too, just found out.
And I was shocked.

1471
01:27:12,869 --> 01:27:15,099
I made a big mistake by
listening to Ira, Sonali.

1472
01:27:17,007 --> 01:27:18,804
We really have to
get them back together.

1473
01:27:19,076 --> 01:27:21,374
Why, Sid? Did she cancel the deal?

1474
01:27:22,145 --> 01:27:25,046
Or is someone paying you
more to get them back together?

1475
01:27:25,148 --> 01:27:25,944
Yes?

1476
01:27:26,049 --> 01:27:27,516
Sonali, I won't give
any justifications.

1477
01:27:28,051 --> 01:27:31,919
Because I know no
explanation will be right and enough.

1478
01:27:32,522 --> 01:27:34,990
But I know that I will
get them back together.

1479
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,057
This is very difficult, Sonali.

1480
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,160
I really need you for this.

1481
01:27:41,164 --> 01:27:41,994
Please.

1482
01:28:05,055 --> 01:28:05,919
Hi.

1483
01:28:08,258 --> 01:28:09,953
My dear ex-husband.

1484
01:28:10,594 --> 01:28:12,824
I thought you wanted freedom from me.

1485
01:28:13,463 --> 01:28:14,395
What are you doing here?

1486
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:17,391
Ira, I'll pay you alimony
for the rest of your life.

1487
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,094
I really will give
you whatever you want.

1488
01:28:20,237 --> 01:28:21,431
Whatever I want?

1489
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:22,803
Seriously?

1490
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,538
Ira, we cannot
separate Mark and Maggie.

1491
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,205
We have to get them back together.

1492
01:28:31,982 --> 01:28:34,246
And seriously, why would I do that?

1493
01:28:36,953 --> 01:28:37,920
Because...

1494
01:28:38,622 --> 01:28:40,112
Because Maggie is pregnant.

1495
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:41,585
What?

1496
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,355
Sid, are you serious?
- I am serious.

1497
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,463
Oh, thank God.

1498
01:28:49,966 --> 01:28:52,161
Thank God the timing was perfect.

1499
01:28:52,235 --> 01:28:55,466
I mean one month here or there
and the entire plan would go bust.

1500
01:28:55,839 --> 01:28:57,397
Mark would have never left Maggie.

1501
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,133
Shit. Thank God.

1502
01:28:59,276 --> 01:29:00,504
You are unbelievable.

1503
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:02,606
How can you stoop so low?

1504
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:05,370
Really, I mean.
- Oh, come on, baby.

1505
01:29:05,482 --> 01:29:06,915
Life's like bungee jumping.

1506
01:29:07,317 --> 01:29:08,841
The fun is in the fall, right?

1507
01:29:47,624 --> 01:29:49,489
After breaking marriages you
have started breaking cars as well?

1508
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:53,393
Why, Sid? Whose anger are
you venting out on this Horny?

1509
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,659
Sid, two things.

1510
01:29:59,236 --> 01:30:01,568
Number one: I am not
coming back to you.

1511
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:03,466
That's over and done with.

1512
01:30:03,673 --> 01:30:06,005
I am just helping you
with this assignment.

1513
01:30:06,209 --> 01:30:08,541
Because I too had a hand in
separating Mark and Maggie.

1514
01:30:09,646 --> 01:30:13,446
And number two: No battle
can be won without homework.

1515
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:18,645
What is this? - Mark and
Maggie's divorce application file.

1516
01:30:18,989 --> 01:30:20,115
It contains all the details.

1517
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:22,925
How did you get it?

1518
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,391
I've learnt from my past mistakes.

1519
01:30:25,595 --> 01:30:27,028
I've done a thorough research.

1520
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:30,057
So that no one can use me again.

1521
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:35,399
Now that you have
done so much research...

1522
01:30:36,006 --> 01:30:37,667
...also tell me what
needs to be done next.

1523
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:39,267
Meet Madonna.

1524
01:30:40,543 --> 01:30:41,373
Madonna?

1525
01:30:41,544 --> 01:30:43,034
Marc Pereira's granny.

1526
01:30:43,213 --> 01:30:44,441
She lives in Goa.

1527
01:31:28,992 --> 01:31:29,890
Hi.
- Hi.

1528
01:31:30,493 --> 01:31:34,122
Sorry. Youngster's show is at night.

1529
01:31:35,632 --> 01:31:39,159
Actually, we have come to talk
to you about Mark and Maggie.

1530
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:41,464
Mark and Maggie?

1531
01:31:47,978 --> 01:31:51,038
In short, we are the
villains of their love story.

1532
01:31:54,584 --> 01:31:57,178
Not us, granny. Me.

1533
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:01,452
I did all this. I am really sorry.

1534
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:06,286
How dare you!

1535
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:10,422
You separated my Mark and Maggie.

1536
01:32:10,967 --> 01:32:12,662
You bloody rascals.

1537
01:32:12,969 --> 01:32:15,494
You are making a
bloody business out of this.

1538
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:17,430
Shameful.

1539
01:32:18,475 --> 01:32:21,273
I know I deserve more than this,
but I am... I am really sorry, granny.

1540
01:32:21,378 --> 01:32:23,437
Sorry? How will sorry help?

1541
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:24,878
Sorry.

1542
01:32:25,281 --> 01:32:26,509
Granny.
- Granny.

1543
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:28,879
We want to rectify our mistake.

1544
01:32:28,985 --> 01:32:30,885
We want to make them sit
and tell them everything.

1545
01:32:30,987 --> 01:32:34,320
But... at the moment they don't
even want to see each other's face.

1546
01:32:34,391 --> 01:32:36,018
Granny, we need you.

1547
01:32:36,192 --> 01:32:38,422
They will surely
come if you call them.

1548
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,358
Please, granny.

1549
01:32:39,896 --> 01:32:42,421
And what if things
don't go back to normal?

1550
01:32:44,401 --> 01:32:46,266
Then your hand and my cheek.

1551
01:32:46,369 --> 01:32:47,893
You can continue hitting
me till they don't come.

1552
01:33:01,718 --> 01:33:03,743
Excuse me.
- What?

1553
01:33:05,822 --> 01:33:07,346
My darling Madonna.

1554
01:33:07,757 --> 01:33:09,850
Mark, my handsome prince.

1555
01:33:09,993 --> 01:33:12,257
How are you?
- Very well, thank you, Mark.

1556
01:33:12,862 --> 01:33:15,023
Except, I have got some pimples.

1557
01:33:15,865 --> 01:33:16,490
Pimples?

1558
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,099
Yes. One gets pimples
in adolescence, right?

1559
01:33:22,205 --> 01:33:24,799
Are you busy? Should I call you later?

1560
01:33:24,874 --> 01:33:27,968
Don't be funny, granny. I
always have time for you.

1561
01:33:28,078 --> 01:33:29,045
You know that.

1562
01:33:31,214 --> 01:33:32,238
Are you alright?

1563
01:33:32,348 --> 01:33:35,511
What can be wrong with me?
Young and rocking.

1564
01:33:36,086 --> 01:33:41,046
You don't worry about me. Work
well and don't worry about me.

1565
01:33:44,227 --> 01:33:45,159
Relax.

1566
01:33:45,762 --> 01:33:48,959
Flight to Goa leaves at four.
He will be home by six.

1567
01:33:56,106 --> 01:33:59,007
Maggie, my darling. How are you?

1568
01:34:09,552 --> 01:34:10,450
Mark is here.

1569
01:34:11,921 --> 01:34:13,252
Thermometer.
- Here.

1570
01:34:18,328 --> 01:34:19,488
Madonna.

1571
01:34:20,096 --> 01:34:22,792
I knew it. You are not well.

1572
01:34:22,932 --> 01:34:24,559
It took me just a
minute to understand.

1573
01:34:25,335 --> 01:34:28,202
My son. My life.

1574
01:34:28,338 --> 01:34:31,967
Who will understand
if you won't? Tell me.

1575
01:34:32,075 --> 01:34:33,565
You should take your
age into consideration.

1576
01:34:34,077 --> 01:34:35,544
How much will you lie?

1577
01:34:37,947 --> 01:34:39,346
Where is Maggie?

1578
01:34:40,817 --> 01:34:42,182
Maggie...

1579
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:44,918
Granny.

1580
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:47,189
Maggie.

1581
01:34:51,194 --> 01:34:54,288
My God, you are pregnant.

1582
01:34:55,999 --> 01:34:58,399
I'm going to be a great grandmother.

1583
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:04,032
Why didn't you tell me? Why
are you hiding this from me?

1584
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:07,001
You didn't think it
was important to tell me?

1585
01:35:08,912 --> 01:35:10,607
I don't believe this.

1586
01:35:12,415 --> 01:35:14,007
Granny. Granny.

1587
01:35:14,317 --> 01:35:15,284
Granny.

1588
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:17,981
Granny. Granny, please.

1589
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:18,917
Maggie.

1590
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:21,584
I am asking you something.

1591
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:23,452
Why didn't you tell me?

1592
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:25,652
Tell you what?

1593
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:27,619
Why didn't you tell
me you are pregnant?

1594
01:35:27,864 --> 01:35:29,263
Why do I need to tell you?

1595
01:35:30,466 --> 01:35:33,526
Maggie, this child as
much mine as it is yours.

1596
01:35:33,903 --> 01:35:36,394
Really? You have a lot of confidence.

1597
01:35:37,407 --> 01:35:39,238
How do you know that
this child is yours?

1598
01:35:40,143 --> 01:35:43,306
You were confident that I
was sleeping around in Greece.

1599
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,145
That's why you left me
alone over there, right?

1600
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:47,480
Yes?

1601
01:35:47,884 --> 01:35:48,509
Well...

1602
01:35:48,685 --> 01:35:51,449
Maggie, whatever
happened that night...

1603
01:35:51,554 --> 01:35:55,081
Mark, it's not just about that night.

1604
01:35:56,192 --> 01:36:03,325
The truth is there is no
love or trust left between us.

1605
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:10,128
You know what, Mark?

1606
01:36:11,407 --> 01:36:14,308
Even if I had seen you
with a woman in bed...

1607
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,636
...I would have at least
given you a chance to explain.

1608
01:36:22,418 --> 01:36:26,286
Maggie... this is not the place...
- To hell with you.

1609
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:41,201
The problem is more
serious than we thought.

1610
01:36:48,811 --> 01:36:52,474
Maggie will never forgive Mark.

1611
01:36:53,049 --> 01:36:55,347
No, if we tell Maggie
everything she will understand...

1612
01:36:55,485 --> 01:36:56,816
...that it is all my fault.

1613
01:36:56,986 --> 01:36:58,214
And that Mark is not at fault.

1614
01:36:58,321 --> 01:37:03,315
That idiot's mistake is
that he suspected Maggie.

1615
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,224
Problem is that both of them have
forgotten the love that they had.

1616
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:13,131
Now you two have to do something.

1617
01:37:14,103 --> 01:37:16,162
You have split this couple.

1618
01:37:16,406 --> 01:37:18,033
Now you will unite them.

1619
01:37:19,309 --> 01:37:20,367
Granny.

1620
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:22,000
Granny, Mark is here.

1621
01:37:22,111 --> 01:37:23,840
Go inside. I will talk to him.
- Granny.

1622
01:37:26,983 --> 01:37:27,950
Granny, where are you?

1623
01:37:32,588 --> 01:37:34,078
Hi.
- Hi.

1624
01:37:34,157 --> 01:37:35,215
I'm Sid.
- Hi, Sid.

1625
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:36,223
This is Sonali.
- Hi.

1626
01:37:36,326 --> 01:37:37,793
Hi, Sonali. Pleased to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

1627
01:37:37,927 --> 01:37:40,225
We met granny at aunt
Anita's place in London.

1628
01:37:40,463 --> 01:37:42,488
We came to Goa and she
said stay for a few days...

1629
01:37:42,799 --> 01:37:44,960
...and we did as she
wasn't keeping well.

1630
01:37:45,368 --> 01:37:47,427
Good. Thanks for staying. Do you
know where she is? - No problem.

1631
01:37:47,537 --> 01:37:48,469
Granny?
- Yes.

1632
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:50,835
Yeah. She is in that room.
- Thanks.

1633
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:54,307
Granny.

1634
01:37:56,279 --> 01:37:57,211
Granny.

1635
01:37:59,482 --> 01:38:02,110
I'm sorry, granny. How
many times should I say sorry?

1636
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,980
Tomorrow after I
leave you will miss me.

1637
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:10,085
I will come out on one condition.

1638
01:38:10,626 --> 01:38:16,929
If both of you promise that you
will stay here with me for a week.

1639
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:22,237
Say yes, she isn't keep well.

1640
01:38:23,306 --> 01:38:25,331
Look, her condition is quite delicate.

1641
01:38:26,008 --> 01:38:27,475
We shouldn't trouble her.

1642
01:38:33,983 --> 01:38:36,474
Okay, granny, we
promise that we will stay.

1643
01:38:36,586 --> 01:38:38,986
As long as you say. Now come out.

1644
01:39:14,924 --> 01:39:16,789
We'll do that as well.

1645
01:39:21,764 --> 01:39:23,231
Just a minute, baby.

1646
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:32,137
Hey, Ira.
- Hi, Nano.

1647
01:39:33,709 --> 01:39:36,007
Where is Sid?
- Not in my pocket. Promise.

1648
01:39:37,046 --> 01:39:38,411
You are so funny.
- Thank you.

1649
01:39:38,714 --> 01:39:40,272
He isn't answering my
calls since a few days.

1650
01:39:40,383 --> 01:39:42,681
He isn't coming to
your stupid bar as well.

1651
01:39:43,085 --> 01:39:43,983
What's going on?

1652
01:39:44,086 --> 01:39:45,212
Sid's a busy guy.

1653
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:48,721
You know nowadays people take
divorce at the drop of a hat.

1654
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:51,282
That's right.
- Sid's business is booming.

1655
01:39:51,394 --> 01:39:53,089
He must have gone
somewhere for his case.

1656
01:39:53,763 --> 01:39:57,255
But Nano, how is it possible
that you don't know where he is.

1657
01:39:57,834 --> 01:39:59,426
It has happened number of times.

1658
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:01,693
I am his friend, not his wife.

1659
01:40:01,838 --> 01:40:02,998
You are not, either, right?

1660
01:40:04,173 --> 01:40:06,073
No, Nano. I am not, either.

1661
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:10,137
That's why you might
have to pay a heavy price...

1662
01:40:10,213 --> 01:40:12,147
...for acting smart with me.

1663
01:40:12,748 --> 01:40:15,273
Tell Sid that I want
to talk to him urgently.

1664
01:40:15,785 --> 01:40:17,309
He should just pick up
the phone and call me.

1665
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:19,411
Get it?
- Sure, ma'am.

1666
01:40:19,489 --> 01:40:20,683
Okay. Wonderful.

1667
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:22,122
Bye.

1668
01:40:25,027 --> 01:40:26,961
We...
- Granny.

1669
01:40:27,363 --> 01:40:30,924
I just saw Mark's phone.
18 missed calls. From Ira.

1670
01:40:31,501 --> 01:40:33,935
I don't think Mark has
told her where we are.

1671
01:40:34,337 --> 01:40:37,431
She is after Mark.
- I know her every well.

1672
01:40:37,707 --> 01:40:40,904
She is very clever. It won't
tell her long to get here.

1673
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:42,472
That witch.

1674
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:44,846
She has ruined my Mark's life.

1675
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:47,382
Granny, that's why I saw
we should quickly start...

1676
01:40:47,483 --> 01:40:49,314
...that plan you have
made of rekindling...

1677
01:40:49,385 --> 01:40:50,443
...the love between Mark and Maggie.

1678
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:51,778
When should we start it?

1679
01:40:52,188 --> 01:40:53,849
Tomorrow morning, from church.

1680
01:40:54,056 --> 01:40:56,490
Where Mark and Maggie got married.

1681
01:40:59,328 --> 01:41:05,164
You know Sonali, this church
is very special for our family.

1682
01:41:06,002 --> 01:41:10,939
Last four generations of Pereira
family got married here. - Wow.

1683
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,031
Both of them wrote their own vows.

1684
01:41:13,709 --> 01:41:14,903
Wow.
- Really?

1685
01:41:15,077 --> 01:41:16,135
What were the vows?

1686
01:41:16,245 --> 01:41:21,114
During their wedding they
made promises to each other.

1687
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:23,816
Remember, Mark and Maggie?

1688
01:41:24,854 --> 01:41:26,947
Mark. Maggie. Come.

1689
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:29,651
Come here, darlings. Come.
- Come.

1690
01:41:34,263 --> 01:41:35,093
Good.

1691
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:38,157
Mark, say your vows.

1692
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:41,998
It will be a
rehearsal for Sonali and Sid.

1693
01:41:48,177 --> 01:41:50,304
This is how both of
you were standing, right?

1694
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:54,247
Mark, your vows?

1695
01:42:04,093 --> 01:42:08,223
I perhaps won't be able
to keep you always happy.

1696
01:42:09,932 --> 01:42:13,299
I might sometimes not be able to
understand what lies in your heart.

1697
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:17,134
Actually, I'll not be
able to understand...

1698
01:42:17,239 --> 01:42:19,469
...what lies in your
heart a number of times.

1699
01:42:22,778 --> 01:42:25,212
But... one sign from you...

1700
01:42:25,948 --> 01:42:30,248
...and I'll keep all my
happiness and thoughts aside...

1701
01:42:32,321 --> 01:42:33,913
...and agree to whatever you say.

1702
01:42:35,758 --> 01:42:37,953
I'll listen to only
what lies in your heart.

1703
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:46,461
I give my heart... my life to you.

1704
01:42:48,871 --> 01:42:54,400
Because you... know what
I want more than I do.

1705
01:42:59,148 --> 01:43:02,140
Maggie, your vows.

1706
01:43:02,485 --> 01:43:03,975
What had you said?

1707
01:43:08,924 --> 01:43:12,621
I know you aren't the
perfect husband material.

1708
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:16,724
But for me...

1709
01:43:19,201 --> 01:43:20,964
there cannot be anyone
more perfect than you.

1710
01:43:22,972 --> 01:43:27,932
I know you don't share
your feeling with anyone.

1711
01:43:29,011 --> 01:43:30,501
Sometimes, not even with me.

1712
01:43:31,847 --> 01:43:32,871
It's okay.

1713
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:41,485
I promise that I'll understand
everything without you saying anything.

1714
01:43:44,627 --> 01:43:50,566
Today I hand over my
trust and faith to you.

1715
01:43:55,037 --> 01:43:58,700
I know... I have your heart.

1716
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:07,310
And I promise that I
will... I will take good care of it.

1717
01:44:18,294 --> 01:44:19,261
Wow.

1718
01:44:27,203 --> 01:44:30,570
"Your image still lingers in my eyes."

1719
01:44:30,873 --> 01:44:40,180
"I cannot distance myself from
your memories even if I want to."

1720
01:44:41,684 --> 01:44:48,613
"Your presence can be felt
even after you have left."

1721
01:44:48,958 --> 01:44:54,794
"Why do you dwell in
my heart as a desire?"

1722
01:44:56,098 --> 01:44:59,499
"Why do I think of you?"

1723
01:44:59,635 --> 01:45:03,002
"Why do I end and then
I exist once again?"

1724
01:45:03,272 --> 01:45:09,177
"Where have you brought me?"

1725
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:17,919
Isha, what medicine should
one give to make someone vomit?

1726
01:45:19,054 --> 01:45:20,749
No, no, no. Not to stop vomiting.
To make someone vomit.

1727
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:22,721
To make someone vomit. To induce it.

1728
01:45:23,058 --> 01:45:24,320
Okay. Thanks.

1729
01:45:24,593 --> 01:45:25,218
Sure?

1730
01:45:25,594 --> 01:45:26,583
I'll tell you later.

1731
01:45:26,695 --> 01:45:28,925
See you later. Bye. Bye, baby. Bye.

1732
01:46:40,536 --> 01:46:43,130
Hey, Mark. What are you doing here?

1733
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:46,934
Nothing. Just like that.

1734
01:46:50,045 --> 01:46:53,606
Hey, now I get it. You can't
sleep because you are hungry, right?

1735
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:57,742
Because of no dinner.
- True.

1736
01:46:59,154 --> 01:47:02,248
Idea. Maggie.
- What?

1737
01:47:02,324 --> 01:47:06,351
When nothing helps
Maggie comes in handy.

1738
01:47:07,029 --> 01:47:07,996
What do you mean?

1739
01:47:08,063 --> 01:47:10,031
Give me two minutes. I'll
make Maggie noodles and come.

1740
01:47:10,099 --> 01:47:11,088
I'm also hungry. Okay?

1741
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:12,133
Don't go anywhere.

1742
01:47:12,701 --> 01:47:14,191
That's really kind of you.
- Hey, no problem.

1743
01:47:14,637 --> 01:47:15,626
Two minutes.

1744
01:47:48,604 --> 01:47:51,368
Hey, Mark.
- Thanks, Sid.

1745
01:47:52,007 --> 01:47:53,702
That's for you.
- Thanks, Sid.

1746
01:47:55,844 --> 01:47:57,778
Smells good.
- Yeah, nice.

1747
01:48:01,183 --> 01:48:04,118
So when are you and
Sonali getting married?

1748
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,019
It's complicated?
- Yeah.

1749
01:48:13,796 --> 01:48:16,731
Sid, if you love Sonali,

1750
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:19,324
don't let her go.

1751
01:48:23,739 --> 01:48:24,706
Yeah, Mark.

1752
01:48:26,275 --> 01:48:27,264
And you too.

1753
01:48:30,412 --> 01:48:32,277
Maggie is a lovely woman.

1754
01:48:33,115 --> 01:48:36,346
You are very fortunate, I think.

1755
01:48:37,953 --> 01:48:39,978
Yes, that's true.

1756
01:48:40,756 --> 01:48:44,021
I am very fortunate.

1757
01:48:46,962 --> 01:48:49,726
Anyway, Sid, thanks again.
The noodles were great.

1758
01:48:49,865 --> 01:48:51,298
I'm feeling much better.

1759
01:48:51,934 --> 01:48:54,402
Yeah. This is what is
special about Maggie.

1760
01:49:00,009 --> 01:49:00,873
Let's go.

1761
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:06,681
Yeah. Maggie to the rescue again.

1762
01:49:07,282 --> 01:49:08,044
Come, give it. I'll do it.

1763
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:10,118
You sure?
- Yeah. I had a nice time.

1764
01:49:10,219 --> 01:49:12,210
Thanks. Take care, Sid. Bye.
- Goodnight.

1765
01:49:16,325 --> 01:49:17,257
Job's done?

1766
01:49:18,227 --> 01:49:21,321
Yes, 90% of it is done. Only
one thing needs to be done.

1767
01:49:22,197 --> 01:49:23,391
It all went according to plan.

1768
01:49:25,334 --> 01:49:27,859
Hello, Dr. Kelkar? Sid here.

1769
01:49:28,437 --> 01:49:29,927
Nano's friend.

1770
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:34,303
The one who had a fracture
at a strange place. Nano.

1771
01:49:35,744 --> 01:49:36,301
Yes. Yes.

1772
01:49:37,179 --> 01:49:42,947
Dr. Kelkar, I am in Goa
right now and I need your help.

1773
01:50:48,984 --> 01:50:51,179
Hi. Feeling better?

1774
01:50:51,453 --> 01:50:52,351
Okay, good news.

1775
01:50:52,454 --> 01:50:55,082
Doctor said it's nothing serious.
There is nothing to worry about.

1776
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:57,055
Still he wants you to
go for a blood test.

1777
01:50:57,159 --> 01:50:59,423
Hence he is sending someone
from the lab to take a sample.

1778
01:50:59,528 --> 01:51:01,257
Okay? Take care.

1779
01:51:01,463 --> 01:51:02,452
Thanks.

1780
01:51:07,503 --> 01:51:09,471
Nano, please. Just listen to me.

1781
01:51:09,838 --> 01:51:11,499
If you are saying that
Ira has come to meet you

1782
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:13,935
then it means that she
can come to Goa anytime.

1783
01:51:14,143 --> 01:51:15,405
I know her very well.

1784
01:51:15,477 --> 01:51:17,342
I also know what she will do next.

1785
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:18,979
I have made all the arrangements.

1786
01:51:19,181 --> 01:51:20,978
The three of you come to Goa
immediately. Did you understand?

1787
01:51:21,416 --> 01:51:22,849
Alright? Bye.

1788
01:51:23,051 --> 01:51:25,281
Coffee.
- Goddamn it.

1789
01:51:25,988 --> 01:51:28,149
I had lost my mind.
Why did I listen to Ira?

1790
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:29,747
Look at what I have done.

1791
01:51:31,126 --> 01:51:32,525
She is such an evil woman.

1792
01:51:33,762 --> 01:51:35,195
And you know what the worst part it?

1793
01:51:35,797 --> 01:51:39,563
I did all this and you are
the one who has to suffer.

1794
01:51:40,169 --> 01:51:41,568
Are you done with your speech?

1795
01:51:42,838 --> 01:51:44,772
You don't need to be a hero.

1796
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,840
Anyway, both of them are
never going to forgive you.

1797
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,373
Please, at least forgive me.

1798
01:51:54,016 --> 01:51:55,005
You know I really regret this.

1799
01:51:55,117 --> 01:51:56,448
I am... I am really sorry, Sonali.

1800
01:51:57,085 --> 01:51:58,211
I am sorry.

1801
01:51:59,888 --> 01:52:00,582
Done.

1802
01:52:04,593 --> 01:52:05,457
Thanks.

1803
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:07,061
So, when are you proposing?

1804
01:52:09,998 --> 01:52:10,589
Sorry.

1805
01:52:11,099 --> 01:52:12,532
It's a plan, Sid.

1806
01:52:13,869 --> 01:52:16,099
Granny told me that...

1807
01:52:16,171 --> 01:52:19,106
...Mark had proposed Maggie
grandly on her birthday.

1808
01:52:19,508 --> 01:52:21,840
So, what's tomorrow?

1809
01:52:22,477 --> 01:52:25,935
Sunday. And it's also your birthday.

1810
01:52:26,148 --> 01:52:28,844
Right. So did you get it?

1811
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:30,448
No wonder you are my partner.

1812
01:52:31,186 --> 01:52:32,448
Let's do it.

1813
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,931
"I don't know whether you
are the one I desire..."

1814
01:53:25,607 --> 01:53:31,910
"Or the one I love."

1815
01:53:45,127 --> 01:53:50,588
"I don't know whether you
are the one I desire..."

1816
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:58,237
"Or the one I love."

1817
01:53:58,507 --> 01:54:01,567
"This is all I know..."

1818
01:54:01,643 --> 01:54:04,806
"I just ask for you."

1819
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,008
"This is all I believe in..."

1820
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:13,952
"That I need you."

1821
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:20,686
"I need you."

1822
01:54:21,596 --> 01:54:28,126
"I need you."

1823
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:34,607
"I need you."

1824
01:54:34,776 --> 01:54:41,238
"I need you."

1825
01:54:41,483 --> 01:54:47,285
"I need you."

1826
01:55:13,982 --> 01:55:21,013
"Fame or money
cannot give me divinity."

1827
01:55:26,995 --> 01:55:33,525
"Fame or money
cannot give me divinity."

1828
01:55:33,635 --> 01:55:40,040
"They cannot get me
freedom from loneliness."

1829
01:55:40,108 --> 01:55:43,339
"The world has a right over me."

1830
01:55:43,612 --> 01:55:47,013
"But I have a right on your dreams."

1831
01:55:47,115 --> 01:55:53,714
"No one other than me can see them."

1832
01:55:53,789 --> 01:55:58,123
"I don't know whether it's a right..."

1833
01:55:58,193 --> 01:56:00,161
"It's a right. It's a right..."

1834
01:56:00,228 --> 01:56:06,792
"A right or a daring."

1835
01:56:06,868 --> 01:56:09,769
"This is all I know..."

1836
01:56:10,105 --> 01:56:13,097
"I just ask for you."

1837
01:56:13,341 --> 01:56:16,333
"This is all I believe in..."

1838
01:56:16,745 --> 01:56:22,581
"That I need you."

1839
01:56:23,051 --> 01:56:29,047
"I need you."

1840
01:56:30,091 --> 01:56:35,290
"I need you."

1841
01:56:36,765 --> 01:56:42,670
"I need you."

1842
01:56:43,071 --> 01:56:48,031
"I need you."

1843
01:56:48,143 --> 01:56:49,405
"Need you."

1844
01:56:49,678 --> 01:56:55,412
"I need you."

1845
01:56:56,184 --> 01:57:01,212
"I need you."

1846
01:57:01,323 --> 01:57:03,188
"Need you."

1847
01:57:03,291 --> 01:57:08,888
"I need you."

1848
01:57:09,698 --> 01:57:16,365
"I need you."

1849
01:57:27,182 --> 01:57:28,171
Hi, Mark.

1850
01:57:31,086 --> 01:57:35,045
Mark, where have you been?
Darling. I missed you so much.

1851
01:57:35,123 --> 01:57:37,421
Ira. Ira, please.

1852
01:57:38,527 --> 01:57:40,893
What? I missed you so much, baby.

1853
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:43,862
Or should I say the father of my baby?

1854
01:57:46,835 --> 01:57:50,862
I had told you that that night in
Greece was so special. Remember?

1855
01:57:51,506 --> 01:57:53,974
Ira. Ira, listen. This is not the...

1856
01:57:54,075 --> 01:57:56,100
Mark, listen to me. You
are going to be a father.

1857
01:57:56,845 --> 01:57:58,107
Aren't you excited?

1858
01:58:02,083 --> 01:58:03,778
Maggie. Maggie.

1859
01:58:04,553 --> 01:58:05,110
Maggie.

1860
01:58:05,353 --> 01:58:07,116
Maggie. Maggie. Please.
Please. Please. Please wait.

1861
01:58:07,222 --> 01:58:08,280
Please. Please relax.

1862
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:10,483
I want to say something very
important. Please bear with me.

1863
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:13,793
Mark, I have a confession to make.

1864
01:58:18,266 --> 01:58:20,996
Mark, I created the misunderstanding...

1865
01:58:21,069 --> 01:58:24,869
...and made both of
you fought in Greece.

1866
01:58:27,809 --> 01:58:28,366
What?

1867
01:58:28,443 --> 01:58:33,380
Mark, that night in Club Medusa, I
sent Sonali as Maggie Pereira...

1868
01:58:33,448 --> 01:58:35,416
...and organized for a hot number.

1869
01:58:35,951 --> 01:58:37,509
Maggie had left that
place long before.

1870
01:58:40,055 --> 01:58:41,283
Sid.
- No. Stop, Sonali.

1871
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:44,515
I had called the masseur to your room.

1872
01:58:47,162 --> 01:58:48,959
I had planted the condom in your room.

1873
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,798
You can hit me as much as you
want but let me finish, Mark.

1874
01:58:54,903 --> 01:58:56,302
Listen to me. - Mark. - There
must be a reason for it, right?

1875
01:58:56,404 --> 01:58:57,268
Mark!
- You cheat! - Mark, stop it.

1876
01:58:57,372 --> 01:58:58,134
There must be a reason for it, right?

1877
01:58:58,239 --> 01:58:59,536
How could you do this?
- Sid.

1878
01:58:59,808 --> 01:59:00,570
Mark, there must be a reason
for it, right? - How could you?

1879
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:03,072
Mark, please. There must
be a reason for it, right?

1880
01:59:03,178 --> 01:59:04,509
Stop. Stop it, Mark.

1881
01:59:04,613 --> 01:59:06,877
There must be a reason
why I separated you, right?

1882
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:09,912
I am sorry, man, but...

1883
01:59:10,852 --> 01:59:14,913
Would you like to tell,
my dear ex-wife?

1884
01:59:17,492 --> 01:59:20,950
Yes, Mark. It's true that
Sid is my ex-husband. - What?

1885
01:59:23,365 --> 01:59:27,301
But perhaps they both didn't tell
you that they are divorce experts.

1886
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:31,170
And Mark... Mark.

1887
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:37,437
Ask Maggie how much she has paid
them to get a big alimony from you.

1888
01:59:37,545 --> 01:59:38,534
What rubbish!

1889
01:59:38,647 --> 01:59:40,137
What?
- What? - Ira, what nonsense is this?

1890
01:59:40,248 --> 01:59:42,546
Excuse me, Mr. Pereira.
- Yes?

1891
01:59:46,021 --> 01:59:49,855
I think you guys already know.

1892
01:59:50,191 --> 01:59:52,159
Why? What happened?

1893
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,656
No, we got Mr. Pereira's blood tested.

1894
01:59:57,632 --> 01:59:59,031
We have got its report.

1895
01:59:59,234 --> 02:00:01,532
Why, Doctor? What
happened to Mark? Is he alright?

1896
02:00:01,870 --> 02:00:03,235
Who are you?

1897
02:00:03,505 --> 02:00:06,565
I'm pregnant with Mark's child.
But is Mark alright?

1898
02:00:06,641 --> 02:00:07,437
What?

1899
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:11,041
Mrs. Pereira is... She...

1900
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:18,114
Oh. This was bound to happen.

1901
02:00:18,219 --> 02:00:20,119
Why don't you come to the point?
What is the problem?

1902
02:00:22,457 --> 02:00:23,924
Mr. Pereira, you...

1903
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:26,987
You are HIV positive.

1904
02:00:34,102 --> 02:00:36,900
Mrs. Pereira, we need to
test your blood. And yours too.

1905
02:00:37,005 --> 02:00:37,835
No, I don't want to
get my blood tested.

1906
02:00:37,939 --> 02:00:39,873
Look, we will have to start the
treatment immediately, please.

1907
02:00:39,974 --> 02:00:40,963
But I am absolutely alright.

1908
02:00:41,042 --> 02:00:42,100
Look, I can understand.

1909
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:43,336
People don't accept
it in the beginning...

1910
02:00:43,611 --> 02:00:44,839
...but everything works
out fine, later. - No, but...

1911
02:00:44,913 --> 02:00:46,540
Medical science has
made so much progress.

1912
02:00:46,648 --> 02:00:47,740
We won't let anything happen to you.
- Listen to me.

1913
02:00:47,816 --> 02:00:49,340
Many a times in youth one makes...

1914
02:00:49,617 --> 02:00:50,549
What nonsense are you talking about?

1915
02:00:50,618 --> 02:00:52,085
I am not talking nonsense. Who
is a doctor here? Me or you?

1916
02:00:52,187 --> 02:00:53,586
Have you lost your mind?
- Please calm down.

1917
02:00:53,688 --> 02:00:54,586
Someone get some water.

1918
02:00:54,689 --> 02:00:56,657
Yes, but when I haven't
slept with him then how can I...

1919
02:01:01,996 --> 02:01:03,088
Exactly.

1920
02:01:09,804 --> 02:01:13,296
Madam, it was his test but you failed.

1921
02:01:16,711 --> 02:01:17,700
Get out.

1922
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:19,143
Get out.

1923
02:01:20,315 --> 02:01:21,577
You lost so much blood.
Do something. Here.

1924
02:01:21,683 --> 02:01:22,741
It hurts. It hurts.

1925
02:01:22,884 --> 02:01:24,078
It's nothing. It's nothing.

1926
02:01:24,152 --> 02:01:27,679
Ourjob is to get the people who
are in a troubled marriage, divorced.

1927
02:01:29,057 --> 02:01:32,959
We shouldn't have done
what we did with you.

1928
02:01:34,629 --> 02:01:36,722
Couples like you are very rare.

1929
02:01:37,365 --> 02:01:39,265
You guys make marriage look good.

1930
02:01:40,101 --> 02:01:40,965
Take care.

1931
02:01:46,241 --> 02:01:47,333
Good timing.

1932
02:01:50,945 --> 02:01:51,877
Maggie.

1933
02:01:52,313 --> 02:01:53,837
I am really sorry. I
shouldn't have done this.

1934
02:01:53,948 --> 02:01:55,313
I am feeling really awful.

1935
02:01:55,617 --> 02:01:56,845
I hope you can forgive me.

1936
02:01:57,185 --> 02:01:58,117
It's okay.

1937
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:00,052
Mark.

1938
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:04,722
You rascal.
- Oh God.

1939
02:02:05,627 --> 02:02:07,117
You hit hard. I got scared.

1940
02:02:09,631 --> 02:02:13,965
Their love story is back on track,
but what about yours?

1941
02:02:14,269 --> 02:02:15,759
Go. Get her.

1942
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:18,134
Go. Go. Go.
- Go. Go. Go. - Go, Sid. Good luck.

1943
02:02:19,007 --> 02:02:19,939
Hey.

1944
02:02:20,708 --> 02:02:21,800
Sonali.

1945
02:02:25,113 --> 02:02:26,637
Congratulations, partner.

1946
02:02:26,714 --> 02:02:28,375
Our first case was successful.

1947
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:29,444
First?

1948
02:02:29,684 --> 02:02:31,447
Yes, now we will
stop splitting couple,

1949
02:02:31,719 --> 02:02:33,016
we will instead get them together.

1950
02:02:35,957 --> 02:02:38,687
By the way, there is a
very important case pending.

1951
02:02:39,227 --> 02:02:43,027
An idiot got influenced by the
vamp and broke his heroine's heart.

1952
02:02:43,464 --> 02:02:45,398
We will have to
anyhow get them together.

1953
02:02:46,167 --> 02:02:48,294
Sid, what do you want?
- You.

1954
02:02:50,104 --> 02:02:51,298
After 26 flings, 6 affairs...

1955
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:54,307
...and a very bad marriage
I have found my soul mate.

1956
02:02:54,943 --> 02:02:56,877
I won't let go of you so easily.

1957
02:02:59,113 --> 02:02:59,807
Take this.

1958
02:02:59,948 --> 02:03:00,915
Come on, check it out.

1959
02:03:06,054 --> 02:03:09,285
I've heard that things written in
blood have greater impact in love.

1960
02:03:09,424 --> 02:03:11,824
I was anyway bleeding. I
thought I shouldn't waste it.

1961
02:03:13,194 --> 02:03:15,719
You are such a pain in the bum, Sid.

1962
02:03:16,464 --> 02:03:18,398
Bum?
- Heart.

1963
02:03:18,466 --> 02:03:19,455
It's bum for you, right?

1964
02:03:19,734 --> 02:03:20,462
Yes.

1965
02:03:21,336 --> 02:03:23,327
You have hurt me a lot over here, Sid.

1966
02:03:23,738 --> 02:03:25,399
Look Sonali, you are
looking for a prince charming.

1967
02:03:25,506 --> 02:03:27,201
And I am no where close to that.

1968
02:03:27,342 --> 02:03:29,037
You are a fitness
freak and I am a freak.

1969
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:30,702
I cannot think of
anything other than food.

1970
02:03:30,812 --> 02:03:31,779
I accept it.

1971
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,941
You are near perfect
and I make mistakes.

1972
02:03:34,015 --> 02:03:34,913
I stray.

1973
02:03:34,983 --> 02:03:36,780
In short, I am full of imperfections.

1974
02:03:38,753 --> 02:03:41,153
But Sonali, that's the
beauty of the whole thing.

1975
02:03:41,222 --> 02:03:43,713
I agree that we make a strange pair.

1976
02:03:44,859 --> 02:03:47,225
What can be more odd that I
am proposing to you now...

1977
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:50,058
...whereas you are already
wearing my engagement ring.

1978
02:03:54,903 --> 02:03:56,029
No, Sonali.

1979
02:03:59,908 --> 02:04:00,840
Sonali.

1980
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:03,901
Sonali, please. Listen.

1981
02:04:04,245 --> 02:04:05,303
Sonali, I am sorry.

1982
02:04:12,287 --> 02:04:13,276
You...

1983
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,157
I love you, too.

1984
02:04:21,462 --> 02:04:23,930
Come here, you... sexy woman.

1985
02:04:29,938 --> 02:04:30,768
Listen.

1986
02:04:31,172 --> 02:04:32,799
Never ever remove it. Got it?

1987
02:04:36,544 --> 02:04:37,841
I really love you.

1988
02:04:39,113 --> 02:04:40,978
Let's go.
- Where?

1989
02:04:41,416 --> 02:04:43,384
Home.
- Whose?

1990
02:04:44,419 --> 02:04:47,411
Yours. I have a
lizard at my place, right?

1991
02:04:49,223 --> 02:04:51,282
One lizard is right in front of you.

1992
02:04:55,930 --> 02:04:57,022
Not a lizard.

1993
02:04:57,966 --> 02:04:59,433
My prince charming
