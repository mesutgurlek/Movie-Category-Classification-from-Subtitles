1
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,160
Wait a minute, fellows.
You got this all wrong.

2
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,288
- l never laid a hand on her.
- We got there just in time.

3
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,855
That's the trouble with you nightclub
entertainers. You're all alike.

4
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,833
You think you can own
every dame in the country.

5
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:40,134
Show me a law in the country that says
l can't buy a doll a friendly drink.

6
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:44,905
No law, just don't buy a drink in your
hotel room for a doll that's underage.

7
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,970
- Let's get goin', bud.
- How'd l know she was jailbait?

8
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,346
She looked like she was 35.

9
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,578
Want I should ask
for a driver's license?

10
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,450
lf you had, you would have found out
she was the mayor's daughter.

11
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,082
But-- Well, can't
we talk this over?

12
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,251
Come on !
You're leaving town now!

13
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,624
- l can't. l'm broke.
- Here's your ticket.

14
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,560
One-way.

15
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,895
All aboard!

16
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,130
Thank you.

17
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,118
- Taxi!
- Taxicab!

18
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,614
Cab, lady?

19
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,988
Taxi, sir?

20
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,425
No, thanks. l got my car
and chauffeur meetin' me.

21
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:53,025
Step lively for a tour
of San Francisco.

22
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,557
Aid, young man?
Can l give you aid?

23
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,196
- What did you have in mind?
- l beg your pardon.

24
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,538
- Lovely homes and gardens.
- Get your early morning paper.

25
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,206
Golden Gate Park,
the world-renowned Cliff House...

26
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,476
overlooking the Pacific.

27
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,627
- Let your hips swing around the whirl.
- Herm, you need a singer?

28
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:35,902
Singer? l don't care if you sing like a
nightingale. l'm runnin' a girls' show.

29
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,046
Legs, not tonsils.

30
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,776
l see what you mean.

31
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,773
Thanks a lot.

32
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,543
Hurry, hurry.

33
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,381
This is the place
you can write home about.

34
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,891
This is the spot.

35
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,724
Hurry, hurry.
The show is just about to begin.

36
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,767
Plenty of seats available.
Step right on in out of the rain.

37
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,532
Everybody happy on the inside.

38
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,941
We got the greatest show in town.
The greatest show.

39
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,813
Come on in and hear
Ned Galvin And His Galvinizers...

40
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,908
the hottest band in town.

41
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,146
We got the finest food in town.

42
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,156
Hurry, hurry.
Everybody happy on the inside.

43
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,283
Go on right in, bud.
Hey, hey!

44
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,237
How are your fortune cookies?

45
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,706
Hi, maestro.

46
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,812
Remember your old pal Joey?

47
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,549
How could l forget? You still owe me
30 bucks from San Diego.

48
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,818
What do you think l'm doing here?
l came back to pay you the loot.

49
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,520
- Oh, man, am l glad to see you.
- Sure.

50
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,529
Take it out of
my first week's salary.

51
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,588
Tell the management
l'm available.

52
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,498
- You're always available.
- You got to stay loose.

53
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,763
That's the trouble, you see,
but we have an M.C.

54
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,771
Excuse me a minute.

55
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,302
Listen, can't we go
someplace after the show?

56
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,110
Have a cup of coffee and
yak up old times? Have some laughs?

57
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,118
That'd be good,
but l got a date with a girl.

58
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,916
lf she's a good-looking chick,
bring her along.

59
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,388
She's good-lookin' all right.

60
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:08,018
You don't understand.
Joey's turned over a new leaf.

61
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,530
New Joey, huh?
Sure, how about that?

62
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,122
How good-lookin' is she?

63
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,133
Back again, huh?

64
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,777
I'm a red-hot mama

65
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,785
But I'm blue for you

66
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,822
l get purple with anger

67
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,188
At the things you do

68
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,386
And l'm green with envy

69
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,129
When you meet a dame

70
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,633
And you burn my heart up

71
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,226
With an orange flame

72
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,239
I'm a red-hot mama

73
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,436
But you're white and cold

74
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,479
Don't you know your mama

75
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,840
Has a heart of gold

76
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,846
Hey. Who's the mouse
with the built?

77
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,925
A terrific rainbow
over you and l

78
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,521
You got to lay off of her, Joey.
She's a nice kid.

79
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,432
She has ambition too.
She wants to be a singer.

80
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,994
By the way, l'm helping her
with some of her arrangements.

81
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,199
Looks like she's pretty
well arranged as it is.

82
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,446
- Has that crummy M.C. shown up yet?
- Not yet, Mike. He must be stuck.

83
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,455
Yeah, in a crap game. That's twice
this week this bum has been late.

84
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,152
What do you want me to do? Cut his
number out and we'll go right to finale?

85
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,558
- Yeah, go right into the finale.
- Okay then.

86
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,793
Over you and I

87
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,235
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's hear it. Make the ladies know it.

88
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,272
You can do better than that.

89
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,371
Thank you. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

90
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:09,642
We bid you good evening. l'm very happy
to be working in my hometown of...

91
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,307
San Francisco.

92
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,783
l've never seen him before.

93
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,652
l was born right here in this town,
right top of Telegraph Hill.

94
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,282
Yes, sir, my mother
was sending a wire at the time.

95
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,849
That's in Morse code. Secret Service
joke. What are you gonna do?

96
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,260
- You know this bum?
- Yeah, l know him.

97
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,527
- What's his name?
- His name's Joey Evans.

98
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,125
ls that the same Joey Evans
that caused all that trouble...

99
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,171
at the Hi-Ho Club a few years back?

100
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,173
You mean the same Joey Evans who--

101
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,903
l've had a request to do a song that's
dedicated to all the saloon keepers...

102
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,946
who are blowing their liquor license
called ""l Didn't Know What Time lt Was."'

103
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,573
""l didn't know--''
Oh, boy. C7, please.

104
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:50,088
l didn't know what time it was

105
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,750
Till l met you

106
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,986
Oh, what a lovely time it was

107
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:03,092
How sublime it was too

108
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:08,436
I didn't know what day it was

109
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,533
You held my hand

110
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:17,106
Warm like the month of May it was

111
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,174
And I'll say it was grand

112
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,946
He's got them in a trance.

113
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,754
Better they stay awake.
ln a trance, they won't drink.

114
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,487
lf they won't drink,
I got to go out of business.

115
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,997
Grand to see your face
Feel your touch

116
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,397
Hear your voice say I'm yours

117
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,902
Alone

118
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:43,874
l didn't know what time it was

119
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,570
And then I met you

120
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:51,074
Oh, what a lovely time it was

121
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,675
How sublime it was too

122
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:58,349
I didn't know what day it was

123
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,882
Then you held my hand

124
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,920
Warm like the month of May it was

125
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,490
And I'll say it was grand

126
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,560
Grand to be alive, to be young

127
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:16,597
To be mad, to be yours alone

128
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,645
Grand to see your face
Feel your touch

129
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,546
Hear your voice say
I'm all your own

130
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,683
He's cute!

131
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,517
You think anyone
with pants on is cute!

132
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,217
That's a lie.
l Iike lots of people without pants.

133
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,784
- What l mean is--
- Let it lay, honey.

134
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:43,893
l'm wise and
l know what time it is now

135
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:51,476
l'm wise and
I know what time it is now

136
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,907
I'm so wise

137
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,940
And I know what time it is now

138
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,890
Thank you very much.

139
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,222
Okay, hit the finale.

140
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,755
- Say, when do I start?
- You already started.

141
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,802
- What about my billing?
- Your what?

142
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,235
My billing. You know,
my picture out front.

143
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,273
- Are you kidding?
- Who's kiddin', Mike?

144
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,535
l got a big following. Put my picture
out front, they'll break the door down.

145
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,008
You'll have the rope up
every night.

146
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,307
One bad night
and you'Il be on the end of it.

147
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,041
Get this straight, lover boy.
l heard a lot about you.

148
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,846
I don't want you sniffing
around the customers' dames.

149
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,786
One false move and
you're out on your Frances.

150
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,790
Yeah, you.

151
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,316
That's what l like, Mike.
Security in a job.

152
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:47,661
Say, nobody's brought it up yet,
but l get 200 a week.

153
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,598
- What?
- l'll take less.

154
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:54,002
l made it a point never to argue
with the fellow who owns the saloon.

155
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,702
When the sun goes down
it is wide awake

156
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,905
Take your ma and your pa
and go to Frisco

157
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,609
Boston is England
New Orleans is France

158
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,413
New York is anyone
for ten cents a dance

159
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,580
But this great big town
by the Golden Gate

160
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,285
ls America's first
and Americans make

161
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,988
San Francisco

162
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,799
She was one of those new kids,
a little nervous, you know.

163
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,633
So l coached her a little bit,
if you excuse the expression.

164
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,673
She was singin' all those ballads
and that draggy jazz.

165
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,675
One day when the fleet landed...

166
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,870
she wanted to know from me
what would please the sailors most.

167
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,072
So l told her.

168
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,672
Things were never
the same between us again.

169
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,981
- Linda English, Joey Evans.
- Hi.

170
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:48,420
Yeah, she was quite a doll, that little
redheaded girl of yours in San Diego.

171
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,462
Mine? lt was your redheaded girl.

172
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,463
lf you want to get technical
about the situation...

173
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,261
she was really the manager's girl,
and she was a brunette at the time.

174
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,165
So good to see
American food again.

175
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,501
l've been out of the country. l've been
working for six months in Honolulu.

176
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,804
- You don't look very tan.
- lt was the rainy season.

177
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:09,473
lf you really want to know what
they wore under those grass skirts--

178
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,140
- Easy.
- Sorry.

179
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,742
- Excuse me, Miss, uh--
- English.

180
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,346
- For you, Ned.
- Okay, baby. Excuse me.

181
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,932
l heard about you, buster.

182
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,992
- Big reputation.
- Yeah.

183
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,938
But I'm too much of a lady
to say what for.

184
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,400
My sister worked
with you in Fresno.

185
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,605
She told me all about you.

186
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,204
Which one was she?

187
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,581
The one you didn't
get to first base with.

188
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,587
Oh, she was the ugly one.
Must be twins.

189
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,521
Hey, fellows, good news.
We're coming up in the world.

190
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:59,792
Got a call from the agent, and he wants
us to play a society party on Nob Hill.

191
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,232
Shorty, you call the union
and get four extra guys.

192
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,963
Okay, Ned.

193
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,564
Something must have happened to
the band bus. lt broke down somewhere.

194
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,575
- You want to go along?
- We'd love to.

195
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:16,637
Wait a minute. Maybe this could be
a chance to pick up a couple of bucks.

196
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,649
Ned boy, l'll never
forget you for this.

197
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:22,050
Oh, yes, you wiIl forget it.
Tell the drummer to get you a jacket.

198
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,352
- Nice to have met you, Miss, uh--
- English.

199
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,255
Gotta remember that.

200
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,619
There is a small hotel

201
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,025
With a wishing well

202
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,825
l wish that we were there

203
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,597
Together

204
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,596
There is a bridal suite

205
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,698
One room bright and neat

206
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,505
Complete for us to share

207
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:23,912
Together

208
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,281
Looking through the window

209
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:30,345
You can see a distant steeple

210
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,653
Not a sign of people

211
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,854
Who wants people

212
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,593
When the steeple bell

213
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,328
Says, good night, sleep well

214
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:49,002
We'll thank the small hotel
together

215
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,880
l don't recognize the body,
but the face is familiar.

216
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,582
That's Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.
She owns the place.

217
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,792
She didn't pick up that action
at Arthur Murray's.

218
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,297
You're right. She used to be
vera vanessa. She was in show business.

219
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,355
Then she married a wealthy guy
and retired. Don't you remember?

220
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,334
- lt was all in the papers.
- Yeah, now l remember.

221
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:21,169
""vanessa, the Undresser.'' l didn't
recognize her with her clothes on.

222
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,174
Not a bad-looking mouse.

223
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,973
lt's too bad you can't
afford her brand of cheese.

224
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,585
And when the steeple bell

225
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,952
Says, good night, sleep well

226
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,958
We'll thank the small hotel

227
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,257
Together

228
00:17:55,841 --> 00:18:00,437
Sold to the highest bidder, our
charming hostess, Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.

229
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,681
Ladies and gentlemen, l believe
this ends our little auction.

230
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,746
l know you'll be
very happy to learn...

231
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,122
that the Children's Hospital
will be richer by--

232
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,787
$17,605.

233
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,258
lt's a wee bit short
of our goal of 20,000...

234
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:27,636
but unfortunately we seem to
have run out of articles to auction.

235
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,731
Just a minute, Mrs. Simpson.

236
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,504
l believe l have
something to auction.

237
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:36,412
How much would you bid to hear
Mrs. Simpson do one of her numbers?

238
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,150
This is her favorite charity.
She couldn't possibly say no.

239
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,416
How much will you pay
to see the lady do the number...

240
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,017
that made her name
a byword from coast to coast?

241
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,189
Don't tell me you don't
remember vera vanessa?

242
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,256
She used to be vera
with the vanishing veils.

243
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,071
You needn't start the bidding.
l will open the bidding.

244
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:05,008
l will get things going
by bidding $1,000.

245
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,341
Yes, sir, a thousand bucks
to see our lovely hostess...

246
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,214
do the number exactly
as she did it on the New York stage.

247
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,221
Well, not exactly because...

248
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:21,817
she promised the police commissioner
she would never do it that way again.

249
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,561
Do l hear 2,000? 2,000?

250
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,997
2,000!

251
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,658
- 3,000!
- That's hardly enough.

252
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,669
That's hardly half enough.

253
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,968
We've got to do
a lot better than that.

254
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,974
l'll bid $4,000.

255
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:47,042
Do I hear $5,000?
$5,000, ladies and gentlemen.

256
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,718
Doesn't any--
$5,000?

257
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,725
5,000--

258
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,935
Please-- $5,000!

259
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,639
- l'll bid 5,000!
- $5,000 the man bids.

260
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,336
Sold to the man for $5,000!

261
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:16,279
Ladies and gentlemen,
l give you Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.

262
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,346
You louse.

263
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,755
ln Paris
I headlined the follies

264
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,593
Billed as doll
of all the dollies

265
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,657
Admired by the great Stravinsky

266
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,501
But my greatest achievement
in the height of my career

267
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:45,441
Was the time I starred for Minsky

268
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,212
You're looking at
a former stripper

269
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,910
But before I unzip one zipper

270
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,512
I want it known
I was quite the artiste

271
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,080
But the intellectual kind

272
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,193
What was I thinking
while I worked you might ask

273
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:12,966
While I worked these thoughts
kept crossing my mind

274
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:21,444
Zip, Walter Lippmann
wasn't brilliant today

275
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:27,585
Zip, will the Giants
ever take it away

276
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,482
Zip, l was reading
Schopenhauer last night

277
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,663
Zip, and I think
that Schopenhauer was right

278
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,960
Sigmund Freud has often stated
dreams and drives are all related

279
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,301
Zip, I'm a firm believer

280
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,364
Dorothy Dix's daily column
tells that love is dear and solemn

281
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,309
Zip, l can take or leave her

282
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:59,248
Zip, it took intellect
to master my art

283
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,220
Zip, every movement
from the heart

284
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,424
l have read the works of Plato
Translated most of Cato

285
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,656
Zip, I am such a scholar

286
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,631
I don't care for Whistler's mother
Charley's aunt or Schubert's brother

287
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,692
Zip, had to make a dollar

288
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:22,638
Zip, you have asked me
what l think while l work

289
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,269
Zip, I've an intellectual quirk

290
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:35,311
And my thoughts may skip
whenever so inclined

291
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,617
Oh, zip

292
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,954
Zip, zip

293
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:47,192
l'm a broad
with a broad, broad mind

294
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,568
More! More!

295
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,977
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

296
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:04,175
Now if you'll all step onto
the terrace, supper is being served.

297
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,213
l think that's a dandy idea.
Nothing like a midnight snack--

298
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,983
Just a minute,
my presumptuous friend.

299
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,252
The help is being fed
in the kitchen.

300
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,385
T-R-U--

301
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,486
lf you ever want to make a comeback,
l got some dandy material.

302
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,531
You can reach me
at the Barbary Coast Club.

303
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,434
- Good night, Ned.
- Good night. See you in the morning.

304
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:20,153
Before l go, there's
one thing l'd like to know.

305
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,522
What's that?

306
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,562
What would you have done
if you'd been stuck for the 4,000?

307
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,223
Simple. l'd have killed myself.

308
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,099
- Good night, Miss, uh--
- Forget it.

309
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,938
- Good night, Linda.
- Good night, Ned. See you at rehearsal.

310
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,206
Of all the dirty,
rotten, lowdown tricks.

311
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,546
- What are you talking about?
- You know what l'm talking about.

312
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,348
Linda. You know
l'm stuck on her.

313
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,322
- l never even gave her a second look.
- That's just it.

314
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,655
This is a beautiful girl,
and you act like she doesn't exist.

315
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,888
What are you trying to do?
Make a move with her?

316
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,555
- Who, me?
- No, him!

317
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:03,829
l told you l turned over a new leaf.
She's not my type.

318
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,302
They're all your type, Joey.

319
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,208
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

320
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,043
l'm going to stay with you.
l got to have a place to stay.

321
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,948
Not with me. I just as soon
bunk with a cobra.

322
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,078
Just a minute.
Here's 20 bucks.

323
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,748
This is your share of tonight's take.
And you know what?

324
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,019
- What?
- Get your own room.

325
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:32,120
Ned, l'm hurt, really.

326
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,290
But if that's the way
you want it, okay.

327
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,802
Sure, l know. l'm going
to hate myself in the morning.

328
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,497
You may not have
to wait that long.

329
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,926
- What do you want?
- l want to rent the room.

330
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,434
At this hour?
Come back later.

331
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,994
l need it now.
l'm tired.

332
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,784
Sure you're not
one of those sex fiends?

333
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,961
Me? No, but l'm not against it.

334
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,596
- Where's your baggage?
- l left it at the airport.

335
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,258
lt's coming in the morning.

336
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,135
By the way, when the boy comes,
would you tip him? Here's $10.

337
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,737
All right.

338
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,379
l'd like something quiet.

339
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,280
You wouldn't have a room next
to someone who works nights, would you?

340
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,410
l've got just the thing.
Second floor front...

341
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,684
next to a young lady--
an actress-- but very refined.

342
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,658
You share a bath.

343
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,126
We do?

344
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,062
She's nice and clean.

345
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,661
ls this what you want?

346
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,672
lt's the closest thing to it.

347
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,143
l don't allow pets, cooking in the room
or guests of the opposite sex...

348
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,611
unless related.

349
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,046
l have several nieces.

350
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:35,610
That'll be $40 a month
in advance.

351
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,155
You wouldn't have change of
a hundred dollars, would you?

352
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,248
Think l want to get
murdered in my bed?

353
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:44,386
No, of course. Well,
here's 10, ma'am, on account.

354
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,898
Right. l'll get you some towels.

355
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,338
Thank you.

356
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,108
l'll hurry her up.

357
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,877
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Casey.

358
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,475
l want you
to meet your new neighbor.

359
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,289
- You know each other?
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,992
- What a coincidence.
- lsn't it though?

361
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,797
If you were my girl,
you wouldn't need one of those.

362
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:31,933
Well, l'm filling it
for Mrs. Casey.

363
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:39,079
You shouldn't really wear pajamas.
You're definitely the nightgown type.

364
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,583
The shorties.

365
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,097
l'll pay you next week.

366
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,259
You alter that one to fit this good,
l'll send around all my friends.

367
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,532
Never mind sending your friends.
Just send your money.

368
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,085
Hi there, fellow. Bet you wish
you were out here, don't you?

369
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,623
- Well, if it isn't Ned's girl?
- l'm not his girl.

370
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:24,184
Oh? He told me you were.

371
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:28,028
l don't want to complain, but you
used all the hot water this morning.

372
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,195
l thought that you
could use a cold shower.

373
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,103
He's a cute fellow, isn't he?

374
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,840
Reminds me of a dog l had when
l was a kid. His name was Snuffy.

375
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,611
l was crazy about him. One day
he got run over by a milk truck.

376
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,744
l haven't been able
to drink milk since.

377
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,748
Wish l could afford to buy him.

378
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,793
Gets a little lonely traveling
around the country all by yourself.

379
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,021
Don't you have to run a song over
with your boyfriend today?

380
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,395
lf you're speaking about Ned,
I told you once and for all he's--

381
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,491
You're just good friends.
That's right.

382
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,160
So long, Snuffy.

383
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,740
By the way, both of us
use a green toothbrush.

384
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,870
One of us is
going to have to change.

385
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,945
Barbary Coast Club. Come right in
and see our sensational girls...

386
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,547
and featuring Joey Evans.

387
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,155
Come on.

388
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,196
- Come on.
- Joey, stop.

389
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,037
When do l get a door
on this broom closet?

390
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,447
You don't. l couldn't
trust you behind a door.

391
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,147
Say, lover boy, where's that big
foIlowing you're supposed to have?

392
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,452
lt takes a little while, Mike.
You got to let the word percolate.

393
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,754
lt better percolate pretty quick.

394
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:05,193
- Evening, Mr. Megans. Hi, Joey.
- Hi, doll.

395
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:09,324
Stop over tonight?
l want to show you my hi-fi.

396
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,568
This kid's got
a fine woofer and tweeter.

397
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,106
Hey, Herm.

398
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,768
Like l was saying, Mike, you got
to let the people know l'm here.

399
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:22,472
Your name's out front, isn't it? What's
the matter? Your public can't read?

400
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,606
Sure, they can read, boss.
Blow up my picture.

401
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,912
You're blown up enough already.

402
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:32,446
Here are your shirts, Joey.
Just the way you like them, no starch.

403
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,651
What an arrangement.

404
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:41,256
You bum. ln two weeks you've moved in
on every doll but Gladys and Linda.

405
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,129
Show time!

406
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,568
- Gladys doesn't appeal to me.
- And you don't appeal to Linda.

407
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:52,076
Oh, no? l got plans for this doll.
Ring-a-ding plans.

408
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,839
This little mouse takes
a special kind of baiting, Mike.

409
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,347
You're wasting your time.
She'll never go for it.

410
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,218
They all do.

411
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:09,324
lf they asked me
l could write a book

412
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:16,627
About the way you walk
and whisper and look

413
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,167
I could write a preface

414
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,800
On how we met

415
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:29,939
So the world would never forget

416
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:36,944
And the simple secret of the plot

417
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,647
ls just to tell them

418
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,819
That l love you a lot

419
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:49,722
Then the world discovers

420
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,862
As my book ends

421
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:57,635
How to make two lovers of friends

422
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,806
Whoever heard of singing a love song
like this without a girl?

423
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,313
Come on.

424
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:12,082
About the way you walk
and whisper and look

425
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:32,498
And the simple secret of the plot

426
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,706
ls just to tell them

427
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:40,239
That l love you a lot

428
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:45,117
Then the world discovers
Sing.

429
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,989
As my book ends

430
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,518
How to make

431
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:56,158
Two lovers

432
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,670
Of friends

433
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,984
- Fun, huh?
- lt was wonderful.

434
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,855
How's it feeI
working with a star?

435
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,827
Oh, don't let it go to your head.

436
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,231
Just baiting the trap.

437
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,539
Why, you--

438
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,717
Hey, Linda.

439
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,725
l'm taking a bath.
l'll be out in ten minutes.

440
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,727
Would you like me
to scrub your back?

441
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,262
No, and you needn't bother
peeking through the keyhole.

442
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,806
There's a Band-Aid over it.

443
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,011
How about a nice Sunday dinner?

444
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,879
l'll take you out to the Cliff House,
and we'll have shrimp cocktail...

445
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,317
and a steak and French fries
and a little wine.

446
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,547
You know, the whole mishmash.

447
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,250
Thanks. l can't afford it.

448
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,623
What do you mean you can't afford it?
l'm poppin'.

449
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:36,397
Why, that's very generous
of you, Joey.

450
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,232
l'd love to.

451
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,413
lt's funny how we both
use the same toothpaste.

452
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,417
Yes, mine.

453
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,648
lt's little things like that
that bring people together.

454
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,986
Look, there's your friend.

455
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,991
Why, he's glad to see you.

456
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,118
Look how he likes you.
lt's just amazing.

457
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,629
l come by and talk to him
every day through the window.

458
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,722
l pretend like he's mine.

459
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,901
You really would like
to own him, wouldn't you?

460
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,664
l'd give my right arm.

461
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,707
- How much is this little terrier?
- Twenty-five dollars.

462
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,708
- Twenty-five bucks?
- We'lI take him.

463
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:22,439
- Wait a minute. What are you doing?
- No excuses. l made up my mind.

464
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,311
l couldn't let you throw away
all that money on a date with me.

465
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:29,342
l want you to buy what you really want.
A dog to replace Snuffy.

466
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,583
l don't want the--
What l mean is...

467
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,057
Mrs. Casey wouId never
let me have a dog.

468
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,720
Oh, but she will.
l told her how much it meant to you.

469
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,490
She was touched.

470
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,532
She won't be so touched
when he ruins the rug.

471
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,295
Nonsense. He'll be housebroke
in no time.

472
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,201
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

473
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:52,834
Here. A dog to replace Snuffy. He's
all yours. You'll never be lonely again.

474
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,538
That'll be $25, mister.

475
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,344
Would you like to take
some worm medicine?

476
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,147
Not if l can help it.

477
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,711
What about dinner? They'll never let us
in the restaurant like this.

478
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,987
Now don't worry about me.
You just run along home with Snuffy.

479
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,722
Look at that.
He's crazy over him.

480
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,855
Yeah, he loves me.

481
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,263
Well, don't Iet it
go to your head.

482
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,700
Bye, Joey. Bye, Snuffy.

483
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,532
Twenty-five bucks
for a mutt like you.

484
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,637
You're not exactly what l expected
to wind up with tonight.

485
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,380
Terrier.

486
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,511
Terrier, my ankle.

487
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,556
Bet you don't even know
who your old man is.

488
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:43,355
Don't worry about it.
l don't know who mine is either.

489
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,554
That makes us members
of the same club.

490
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,465
Let's see what you know.
Sit up. Roll over.

491
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,062
What a no-talent pooch.

492
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,367
Okay, get some sleep.
Tomorrow we start working.

493
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,373
Teach you some tricks.

494
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,243
No, my little fellow.
Off. O-R-F.

495
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,749
Off!

496
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,081
Here. Come on.

497
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:24,166
And remember.
The powder room is in the park.

498
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,281
Okay, fatten up.

499
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,620
Snuffy! Don't take it!

500
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,321
- You mustn't do that.
- Why not? The pooch is hungry.

501
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:55,092
- What? Chicken bones?
- What's wrong with that?

502
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,226
You mean you used
to feed them to Snuffy?

503
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,206
There never really
was a Snuffy, now was there?

504
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,742
There is now.

505
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,283
l guess l played
a dirty trick on you, huh?

506
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,119
Doesn't matter.
He's beginning to grow on me now.

507
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,422
So are you too.

508
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,063
What's with the milk bit?

509
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,905
l says, ""Doc, how long do l have to
sneak in the back and drink this stuff?

510
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,466
lt doesn't Look good
to the customers."'

511
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,638
Hey, Mike, Mrs. Simpson,
the big society dame, just come in.

512
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,848
Mrs. Simpson? ln my place?

513
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,612
Table nine.

514
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,551
Take him for a walk.

515
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,062
That's her. l told you l'd bring her in.
Wait a minute.

516
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,329
Do me a favor, will you? Let me
handle this. l'm very big with her kind.

517
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,370
- You're pretty big above your ears.
- l'm serious.

518
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,600
Some guys got a system with horses,
and l got a system with dames.

519
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,607
- Hit me.
- lt's a snap.

520
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:17,272
You treat a dame like a lady,
and treat a lady like a dame.

521
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,542
And underneath those furs,
that is pure dame.

522
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,613
This place was definitely
not recommended by Duncan Hines.

523
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,626
Wouldn't we have more fun bobbing
for apples? Why bring us here?

524
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,720
l've got a little score to settle
with one of the inmates.

525
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,390
Watch Joey lay on the class.

526
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,367
ln the meantime, you stock up
on the caviar and the champagne...

527
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:43,135
because this dump is going to cater
to nothing but the carriage trade.

528
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,971
Good evening, Mrs. Simpson.
We're honored to have you here.

529
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,944
l'm so pleased to see you came
all the way down from the Nob Hill.

530
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:52,540
Well, the boy auctioneer.
Won't you join us?

531
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,916
l'd be delighted.
l'm Joey Evans.

532
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,785
- My name's Stanley.
- Mine's Livingston.

533
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,848
Stanley and Livingston.
That's funny.

534
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,362
They have a sense of humor. l like that.
Reminds me of old Dad's.

535
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,488
- Dad's?
- Yes, my father.

536
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,228
He used to tease me about one thing or
another, particularly about my flying.

537
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,270
Your flying?

538
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,430
ln my sports plane.

539
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,100
Oh, l love my life.

540
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,338
There's something you get out of flying
that you get out of nothing else.

541
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,970
Really?

542
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:28,041
It used to upset him, because
l started when l was quite young.

543
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,916
l'm sure you started very young.

544
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:35,357
lt was while l was studying aeronautics
and conversational French at Princeton.

545
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:39,294
That is, before l resigned
to go into the theater.

546
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,523
Pierre!

547
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,965
When is he going to study
conversational English?

548
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,663
Would you bring the folks a bottle
of the best champagne in the cellar?

549
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,933
- Oh, yes. Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

550
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,499
Care for something to eat? They have
a piece of resistance that's great.

551
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:56,910
No, thank you.
We ate before we came.

552
00:41:56,981 --> 00:42:01,475
Yes, l can't say l blame you.
l must apologize for the crum-- decor.

553
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,544
The man who owns this place
is an old buddy of mine.

554
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,385
We were in the same platoon.

555
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:10,291
WelI, he wired me for help
when l was in New York.

556
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,852
l quit my job at the Waldorf,
and here l am.

557
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,097
l've always admired men
who were loyal to their friends.

558
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:26,568
Just between you and me l have been
thinking about opening my own place.

559
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,670
Something very intimate, quiet.

560
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,307
Classy. Maybe have
a quartet of violins.

561
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,345
l'd be there every night.

562
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,884
- You would?
- Mm-hmm.

563
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,390
That's wonderful.

564
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,560
What are we going to call it?

565
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:49,494
Well, l thought
we'd call it something romantic...

566
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,092
and maybe foreign even.

567
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,431
How about...

568
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,173
Chez Joey?

569
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,842
That's very good. That's perfect.
l like that. lt's even French.

570
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,712
Here we are.

571
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,184
You sure that stuff is old enough
to be out on its own?

572
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,984
Yes, sir, 1950,
a very good year.

573
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,788
May have been a good year for the grape,
but it was a lousy year for M.C.s.

574
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,261
To Chez Joey.

575
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:28,096
That's what l like.
Champagne that fights back.

576
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,436
Show time.

577
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,975
That's me. Excuse me.

578
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,102
l do a little song
in this show.

579
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,773
It's a lovely love song,
especially for some of my friends.

580
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,419
What is this?

581
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,821
Oh, we were just slumming, beauty,
and we have a lot of spots to make.

582
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:51,759
What's next, boys? That place where
the young lady dances with the snakes?

583
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,928
So that"s your system, huh?

584
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,938
Guess l tried it
on the wrong mare.

585
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:07,034
Your system just run out of the money
and so have you. You're through!

586
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:10,672
You're kiddin'! Don't you know
a phony act when you see it, Mike?

587
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,184
She had to do that with those
two guys along. She'll be back.

588
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,482
Get your things and get out of here
before l wreck my furniture.

589
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:21,581
Wait, wait, wait. You'll be sorry.
Come here. l want to make you a deal.

590
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,753
lf she doesn't come back by Saturday,
l'll leave without pay.

591
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:29,094
- You bet you wilI.
- But if she comes back, l stay.

592
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,100
With a raise?

593
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,333
Okay, you got a deal.

594
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,323
Excuse me, madam.
There's a gentleman to see you.

595
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,360
He wouldn't give his name.

596
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:02,388
When l asked his business, he seemed
to talk a vernacular l couldn't follow.

597
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,026
- Sounds like Superboy.
- l beg your pardon?

598
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,071
Same vernacular. l'lI see him.

599
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:12,131
You bet you will.
Get rid of the pallbearer.

600
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:18,112
All right, what is it?

601
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:22,050
- l dropped in to say good-bye.
- Are you going somewhere?

602
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,849
Yep, away.

603
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,254
lt worked, baby.
l got the old bounceroo.

604
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,725
- l'm through at the end of this week.
- l didn't mean that to happen.

605
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:36,426
Don't worry your head about it.
l'm sick of this lousy town anyway.

606
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,469
What l really come up here for
is to straighten you out...

607
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:42,630
so you wouldn't get any wrong ideas
why l made a play for you.

608
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:48,076
Wouldn't want you to get any cockeyed
impressions that you appeal to me.

609
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:52,445
The only thing about you that
appeals to me is your M-U-N-Y, money.

610
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,449
- Do l make myself clear?
- Crystal clear.

611
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,691
By the way...

612
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,993
if you knew what you were throwing away,
you'd cut your throat.

613
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:12,034
Oh, Mr. Evans?

614
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,404
Have you had lunch?

615
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:22,309
Thank you, Mrs. Simpson,
but l have a luncheon date with a dog.

616
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:49,871
Okay, it's lunchtime. Come on.

617
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,635
There you go.

618
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,733
Come on, boy.

619
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,244
l know it's not chopped liver,
but you eat what l eat...

620
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,250
for the time being, anyway.

621
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,452
Here. Try this bagel.

622
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,821
Hey, the fingers are mine. Easy.

623
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,861
You ought to try that with
cream cheese and lox. lt's great.

624
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,556
You stick with me,
you'll learn nothing but bad habits.

625
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,941
Okay, it's time for your lessons.

626
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,273
Let's see what you've learned.

627
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,772
We'll begin with the praying bit.
That always gets them.

628
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,310
And while you're at it, pray that
Mrs. Simpson remembers to show up.

629
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,861
Lover boy.

630
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,869
You're gonna love it on the road.

631
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,430
Joey, it's Linda.
May l come in?

632
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,306
Yeah, sure, come in.
Make yourself at home.

633
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,140
Gladys says you're leaving.

634
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:12,848
Yeah, that's right.
l got a wire from Hollywood.

635
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,425
Why didn't you tell me?

636
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,360
Why should l?
You don't care what happens to me.

637
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:23,866
Well, of course l do.
All the girls do.

638
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,529
l don't care about
all the girls, baby.

639
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,572
l just care about you.

640
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:35,134
Do you mean that, Joey,
or is it just an act?

641
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,806
Of course l mean it.

642
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,816
We're sure gonna miss her,
aren't we, Snuffy?

643
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,818
l'm gonna miss you too.

644
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,982
l'm very fond of Snuffy.

645
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,287
Why don't the three of us
have supper tonight?

646
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,397
Show business
is a funny business.

647
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:58,901
We may never run into each other again.
Tonight could be our last night.

648
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:06,238
All right, Joey.
l'll change my things.

649
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,711
l'll take you out to the Cliff House,
and we'll have shrimp cocktail...

650
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,306
and steak and French fries
and a little wine.

651
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,647
You know, the whole mishmash.

652
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,488
Mind the store.

653
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:35,635
l'll finish your laundry, Joey.
You can pick it up later.

654
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,231
Gee, l sure am gonna miss you.

655
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:42,870
l'm gonna miss you too, doll.
Your flatwork is a gasser.

656
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:52,119
l hear you got
the old bounceroo, big shot.

657
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:55,454
lf you mean that you heard l was
leaving, you got it straight.

658
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,323
l'm on my way to New York,
El Morocco.

659
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,987
Are you kiddin'?

660
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,362
The only way you could get to Morocco
is to join the Foreign Legion.

661
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,730
Funny! Funny!

662
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,565
- Here's some scraps for your dog, Joey.
- Thank you, chef.

663
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,731
- Don't mention it.
- Dog, my foot. He eats them himself.

664
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,674
Why not? lt's good stuff.

665
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:17,441
Would you care to join us, sloppy?

666
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,952
Take it easy.
Don't get excited.

667
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,791
- Mrs. Simpson !
- Good evening.

668
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:39,768
- Won't you come in?
- Oh, am l too late?

669
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,929
You? Never!

670
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,576
l'm in the mood
for a little entertainment.

671
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,908
- Pete, get the boys out of the kitchen.
- Yes, sir, right away.

672
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,313
Champagne for the band
and make mine a double brandy.

673
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,841
- Double brandy for Mrs. Simpson!
- Okay, Mike.

674
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:11,193
- l believe you have a singer.
- Yeah, Joey.

675
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:14,203
Joey, sing a song for the lady.

676
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,205
What would the lady
like to hear me sing?

677
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,434
Tell him to surprise me.

678
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:21,204
Joey, surprise the lady.

679
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,441
l'lI surprise the lady.

680
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,511
Double brandy.

681
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:39,561
Twenty-six.

682
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,478
She gets too hungry

683
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,640
For dinner at 8:00

684
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,245
She likes the theater

685
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:08,052
Never comes late

686
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,185
She'd never bother

687
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:15,060
With people she'd hate

688
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:20,069
That's why the lady is a tramp

689
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,173
Doesn't like crap games

690
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,872
With barons and earls

691
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,111
Won't go to Harlem

692
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,676
In ermine and pearls

693
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,349
Won't dish the dirt

694
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,883
With the rest of the girls

695
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:50,194
That's why the lady is a tramp

696
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:55,031
She likes the free

697
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:59,565
Free fresh wind in her hair

698
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:04,272
Life without care

699
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:08,044
She's broke, but it's oke

700
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,712
Hates California

701
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:15,516
It's cold and it's damp

702
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:19,358
That's why the lady is a tramp

703
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:26,268
She gets far too hungry

704
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,827
To wait for dinner at 8:00

705
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,402
She adores the theater

706
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,775
And she doesn't arrive late

707
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,847
She'd never bother

708
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:45,319
With people she'd hate

709
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:49,381
That is why the lady is a tramp

710
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,695
Won't have a dice game

711
00:53:56,766 --> 00:54:00,031
With any barons and earls

712
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:03,539
She will never go up to Harlem

713
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:07,475
Dressed in ermine and pearls

714
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,536
Won't dish the dirt

715
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:15,210
With all the other girls

716
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:19,517
That is why the lady is a tramp

717
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:25,085
She loves the free

718
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:30,360
Free fresh wind in her hair

719
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,493
Life without care

720
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,299
She's broke

721
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:41,099
Hates California

722
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:45,011
'Cause it's so cold and so damp

723
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,845
That's why the lady

724
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:52,581
That's why the lady

725
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:57,992
That's why the lady is a tramp

726
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,431
Come now, beauty.

727
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,690
Not only will l give him a raise,
l'll buy him a bicycle.

728
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,727
Champagne for everybody!

729
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,643
What do you know,
a parking lot for boats.

730
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:59,546
- v-E-R-A.
- That's correct.

731
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,880
- See how smart l am?
- Care to come aboard?

732
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,317
I'd love to, Captain.

733
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,396
This is quite a hideout.

734
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:16,523
Providing you have
something to hide.

735
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,965
Oh, that can be arranged.

736
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,902
Yeah, this is a clever kayak,
isn't it?

737
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,132
My husband gave it to me.

738
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,198
He's never been aboard.

739
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,710
Why doesn't he try
a little Dramamine?

740
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:35,541
This is the dining salon.
And just beyond is the galley.

741
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,985
l know, it's where you keep
your slaves. Slaves?

742
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,647
Nothing. Well--

743
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,287
And this is the master suite.

744
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:48,159
By the way,
where is the master?

745
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:52,496
My husband died two years ago.

746
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,161
And no cracks.

747
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:58,230
l was just gonna say that if you ever
get tired of being a wealthy widow...

748
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,004
you might like to go back
into show business.

749
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,806
No thank you.

750
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,404
l like being Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.

751
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,610
l'm not knocking you
being Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.

752
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:12,416
But l just thought you and me as a team,
we'd make a dandy double.

753
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,389
Aren't you afraid you might
find me a bit rusty?

754
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:20,554
Don't be ridiculous.

755
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,258
Why don't you get out
of something uncomfortable...

756
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,597
and l'll give you
a small audition.

757
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,168
Oh, beauty.

758
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:32,868
You have all the subtlety
of a battering ram.

759
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,373
But you wrong me, my dear.

760
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:45,679
What l meant was perhaps you'd like to
run through one of my old routines--

761
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,588
one l used to do
before l became an M.C.

762
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,421
No thank you.

763
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,927
That would bring back
too many memories.

764
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:57,330
The sticks, split weeks,
drafty dressing rooms.

765
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,334
Drunks tossing pennies.

766
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,400
That's the story of my life.

767
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,268
But l'm going places
one of these days.

768
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:12,473
l gonna have a club
all my very own...

769
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,608
my name up in lights.

770
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,716
No hokey waiters rattling plates
when l'm on.

771
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:21,586
No tough managers
beItin' me around.

772
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,257
Be my own boss.

773
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,021
Nobody owns Joey but Joey.

774
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,628
Chez Joey?

775
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:40,809
Chez Joey:
a place with real class.

776
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,545
l might even appear
in white tie and tails.

777
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,075
Might even wear an opera hat.

778
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,553
Suave stuff.

779
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,561
Easygoing stuff.

780
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:03,461
l might do all of the patter
like that.

781
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,433
Maybe l'll do
the whole thing in French.

782
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,492
Maybe you'd better not.

783
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,562
That's what l said.
Maybe l'd better not.

784
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,575
You'd give a lot
for a place like that, wouldn't you?

785
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,370
Anything.

786
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:22,450
How about it?
You and me could be partners.

787
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,151
What would l get out of it?

788
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,483
Name something.

789
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:35,026
There"s nothing l don't have.

790
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,724
You want a bet?

791
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:43,063
After all, two years is a long time
between drinks.

792
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:49,344
Oh, you can hit
better than that, partner.

793
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,563
Yes, isn't it?

794
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,805
He's a fool...

795
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,898
and don't l know it.

796
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:56,809
But a fool can have his charms.

797
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,379
l'm in love...

798
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,647
and don't l show it.

799
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,723
Like a babe...

800
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,788
in arms.

801
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:18,124
Men are not a new sensation

802
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:22,194
l've done pretty well
I think

803
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:26,640
But this half-pint imitation

804
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:30,509
Put me on the blink

805
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,349
I'm wild again

806
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,652
Beguiled again

807
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:42,454
A simpering, whimpering

808
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,789
Child again

809
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:49,328
Bewitched, bothered

810
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,866
And bewildered

811
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,367
Am I

812
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,843
Couldn't sleep

813
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,345
And wouldn't sleep

814
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:09,610
And what would l do

815
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,483
If l shouldn't sleep

816
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,717
Bewitched, bothered

817
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,387
And bewildered

818
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:23,021
Am l

819
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,497
Lost my heart

820
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,835
But what of it

821
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,538
My mistake

822
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:39,547
I agree

823
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,511
He's a laugh

824
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,511
But I love it

825
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:52,990
Because the love's
on me

826
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,664
A pill he is

827
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:01,669
But still he is

828
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:04,103
All mine

829
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:08,803
And l'll keep him until he is

830
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:12,439
Bewitched, bothered

831
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:16,007
And bewildered

832
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,679
Like me

833
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:44,579
l guess the laugh's on me

834
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:48,807
I've slipped again

835
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,116
I've tripped again

836
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:58,522
The way to my heart
is unzipped again

837
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,259
Linda, you up yet?

838
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,922
l've been up for hours.

839
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,329
Open the door.
l want to talk to you.

840
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:44,672
What do you want?

841
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,334
What's the idea
with all the ice?

842
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:50,675
l get it. You're burned up
because l took a powder last night.

843
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:54,341
What possible difference
could it make to me?

844
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,543
Good morning, Snuffy.

845
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,813
l've got a bone for you.

846
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,248
Speaking of Snuffy, l'm thinking
of making you a present of him.

847
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:06,887
l'm planning on
blowin' this trap.

848
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:11,327
Gonna move to a place that fits
my personality a little better.

849
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,130
- You're not gonna leave the club?
- Nope.

850
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:18,264
l'm gonna take the club with me.
Come here. Let me show you something.

851
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,606
Look straight up the top
of that hill, Nob Hill.

852
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:23,304
That's where l'll take the club.

853
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,472
Little old me.

854
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,414
- You?
- Me...

855
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:33,444
and Mike and all the girls
and everybody in the joint.

856
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:37,288
lt's gonna be the same cast,
the same booze but a new address.

857
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,295
How? What happened?
Did somebody die?

858
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:43,059
No. As a matter of fact,
somebody came to life.

859
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,828
- l have a partner.
- Who?

860
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:51,168
Yes, ma'am, we're gonna have
a real classy joint. K-L-A-S-Y.

861
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,936
- Who's we?
- Me and my partner.

862
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,604
Who is your partner, Joey?

863
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,073
Mrs. Simpson.

864
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:04,880
Now wait a minute.
Don't get the wrong idea.

865
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,979
This is a legitimate business--

866
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,115
lawyers, six-percent interest,
everything.

867
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,556
Everything?

868
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:13,891
Now don't give me
that ""everything'' jazz.

869
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,864
After all, this could be my big chance,
and it could be yours too...

870
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:19,457
because l got a great idea for you
in a number in the show.

871
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,369
Tell me. Just what do l
have to do for it?

872
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:26,374
Just remember all the lyrics.

873
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:31,040
How about Snuffy?
You gonna take him or aren't you?

874
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:36,210
You bet l'll take him.
Not even a dog should live with you!

875
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,487
His leash.

876
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:53,500
Bye, Snuffy.
So long, old pal.

877
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,094
Lucky little dog,
gettin' to live with Linda.

878
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,697
Don't let her fool you.
She's a nice girl.

879
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,743
She just acts like
all nice girIs act: lousy.

880
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,485
Good morning, Mr. Boss.

881
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,154
How are you, Herm?

882
01:08:56,298 --> 01:09:00,598
Now that you got this swell new joint,
l guess there's no place for me.

883
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:02,830
Not at all.
You got a job.

884
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:05,032
Gee, Joey, thanks.

885
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:07,837
Wherever there's mice,
there's always a rat.

886
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:21,886
l'd like them about
out to there.

887
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,159
Out to here.

888
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:45,046
Well, there it is, Chez Joey,
just like l pictured it to be.

889
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,207
A dream come true.

890
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:52,216
- lt means that much to you?
- You bet it does.

891
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:56,452
Took a lot of years of scrounging
and scratching to get a joint like this.

892
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,925
That isn't how you got it.

893
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,657
Oh, l'm sorry.

894
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,334
l shouldn't have said it.
Maybe--

895
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,833
Maybe you're in love with her.

896
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:16,308
He looks a little thin.
Don't you feed him?

897
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,609
A lot better than you did.
He just doesn't eat.

898
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,950
Maybe he's getting lonely.

899
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:29,514
Don't look at me.
l'm eating fine.

900
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,004
Who was that?

901
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,104
One of the mice in the line.

902
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:55,514
- The pretty one?
- ls she? l didn't even notice.

903
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,848
You were certainly knee-deep
in conversation.

904
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,888
l was asking about my dog.

905
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:03,391
Yours? What's she doing with it?

906
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:07,589
l gave him to her when
I evacuated Mrs. Casey's rattrap.

907
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:10,257
- She lived there too?
- Yep.

908
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,160
Why didn't you bring him with you?

909
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:16,830
Because he wasn't yet
yacht broken.

910
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:43,963
My funny valentine

911
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:47,161
Sweet comic valentine

912
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:51,138
You make me smile

913
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,175
With my heart

914
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:59,642
Your looks are laughable

915
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:04,217
Unphotographable

916
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:07,585
Yet you're my favorite

917
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,318
Work of art

918
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:16,697
ls your figure less than Greek

919
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,962
Is your mouth a little weak

920
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:25,430
When you open it to speak

921
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:29,443
Are you smart

922
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:36,009
But don't change a hair for me

923
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,815
Not if you care for me

924
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:43,016
Stay, little valentine

925
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:51,459
Each day

926
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:56,402
Is Valentine's Day

927
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,873
- When did she spring from the chorus?
- Who?

928
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,212
The mouse in the spotlight.

929
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,352
l'm beginning to talk like you.

930
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:15,220
You mean Linda?
Well, she's Ned's girl.

931
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,690
He's kind of stuck on her.

932
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,321
We talked it over
and we figured she was ready.

933
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,229
Ready for what?

934
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,259
very nice, Miss English.

935
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:58,697
lt was just wonderful,
beautiful.

936
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,565
Pretty good, huh, Ned?
Let's do the ""Kick lt Around'' number.

937
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,400
Come on, kids. Let's go.

938
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,702
Don't you think
she was pretty good, partner?

939
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,139
Not quite good enough.

940
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:10,542
She's just beginning. Give her time.
Wait till you hear this next number.

941
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,949
l think she'd be better off
someplace else.

942
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,349
Would you like to explain that?

943
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:19,478
l'll make it simple for you.

944
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,921
She's out.

945
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,550
- You want me to fire her?
- Yes, partner.

946
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:30,057
l figure it's the onIy way
to protect my investment.

947
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,430
l don't mean the club,
l mean you.

948
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,936
l think it's a stinkin' trick.

949
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:39,999
Come now, beauty.

950
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:44,010
Don't tell me you've developed
a better nature.

951
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,757
Come on, Snuffy.

952
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:01,019
Linda, you decent?

953
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:02,927
Just about. Come in.

954
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:11,970
l've been thinking that
you were so good in that number...

955
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,304
l decided to give you
something better to do.

956
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,537
- You did?
- A real blockbuster.

957
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:19,080
That's wonderful.
Which one?

958
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:22,480
l thought maybe
you ought to do the strip.

959
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,819
But Gladys does that number.

960
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:29,858
You wind up out there
with nothing on.

961
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,893
What do you think l am?

962
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,158
You're the best built mouse in the
joint, so let's take advantage of it.

963
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:41,226
l won't do it!
l'm sticking to my song.

964
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:45,569
l'm sorry, baby, but l've already
given the song to Gladys.

965
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:49,236
- l just thought you'd be pleased.
- Wait a minute.

966
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,507
There's something more to this.

967
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,675
You knew l'd say no.
You wanted me to. Why?

968
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:59,517
Your girlfriend told you
to get rid of me, didn't she?

969
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:01,579
- Look--
- Don't interrupt!

970
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:04,717
But you didn't have the guts, did you?
You wanted me to quit!

971
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,092
Chez Joey.
Well, that's a laugh.

972
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,427
Why don't you change it
to Chez vera?

973
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,529
What are you waiting for?
You've run your errand.

974
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,361
What happened to your head?

975
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:48,164
There's something you ought to know.
l didn't have to fire her. She quit.

976
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,363
That's the same thing.

977
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,840
Don't let it bother you. l'm sure she'll
have no trouble finding another job.

978
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,673
Sure. She can always pitch
for the New York Giants.

979
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,525
l want a bourbon, straight.

980
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:18,124
lsn't it a little early in the day
for a girl who doesn't drink at night?

981
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,468
On second thought,
make it two.

982
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:07,905
- What's with the watch bit?
- lt's getting late. Finish your drink.

983
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:10,679
What for? We got all night.

984
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:12,777
Oh, no, we haven't, beauty.

985
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,947
l'm giving a dinner party.

986
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:17,218
So?

987
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,817
Put another plate at the table.

988
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:22,989
lt would make 13,
and l'm superstitious.

989
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:28,233
Only thing l'm superstitious about
is 13 in bed.

990
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:30,237
You'll have to leave.

991
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:35,234
l guess you think maybe l don't know
what fork to use.

992
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:40,043
Well, you're right, l don't, but l
wouldn't eat with those creeps anyway.

993
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,379
l'll see you at the boat later.

994
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:48,617
l'll go down to the corner
and grab a hamburger.

995
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,952
How should l have my hamburger...

996
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:54,962
with or without onions?

997
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,326
Without.

998
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,992
You're a cinch.

999
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,884
What happened?
How come you didn't show?

1000
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:26,894
l had to hear ""Tristan and lsolde.''

1001
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,623
Hear him do what?

1002
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,790
lt's an opera.

1003
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:33,664
Of course.

1004
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:36,397
Afterward, they all came back here
and l couldn't get out of it.

1005
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,411
Aren't you gonna pipe me aboard?

1006
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,936
- What was that?
- l'm listening to the late news.

1007
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,347
Sleep tight, doll.
Talk to you tomorrow.

1008
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,988
Man's best friend.

1009
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:58,817
Or was that your mother?

1010
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:02,489
I wonder what she'd say
if she could see me now.

1011
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,259
She'd say that you were stoned.

1012
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:09,428
And she'd also want to know
what you're doing in my bedroom.

1013
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:11,495
l decided to take your offer.

1014
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,006
What offer?

1015
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:16,039
Strip.

1016
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:17,669
Peeled.

1017
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,775
Take it off and let it lay.

1018
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,554
You were right.

1019
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:30,784
l do have a good shape.

1020
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:34,720
Confidentially...

1021
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,465
l'm stacked.

1022
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,627
Bet you thought l wouldn't,
didn't you?

1023
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:43,830
l'll bet you even thought
that l couldn't.

1024
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,703
But l can.

1025
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,541
And l will.

1026
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,706
Bewitched

1027
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,715
Bothered

1028
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:59,063
lt's all right, Snuffy.

1029
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,904
lf l walk in my sleep,
bite me.

1030
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,734
Well, good morning.

1031
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:32,131
Oh, what's good about it?

1032
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:34,801
Oh, your first hangover, huh?

1033
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:39,372
Well, there's a first time
for everybody.

1034
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:48,820
Why do people drink when
it feels so awful the morning after?

1035
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,882
Maybe because it feels so good
the night before.

1036
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,532
What did l do last night?

1037
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,464
You kissed me.

1038
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:05,434
l wasn't myself.

1039
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:08,135
Yeah, but whoever you were,
you were great.

1040
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:11,936
Then what?

1041
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:14,675
Then you passed out.

1042
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,683
I'm ashamed of myself.

1043
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:18,343
Me too.

1044
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:22,484
Why? What did you do?

1045
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,726
Nothing.

1046
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:28,524
Let's try on some breakfast.
Come on.

1047
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:30,530
lt'll do you good.

1048
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:35,794
Nice and easy.

1049
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:43,474
Snuffy, please.
Not so loud.

1050
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,542
- There you are.
- You cook?

1051
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:52,484
You can't go through your life
on Wheaties alone.

1052
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:56,381
l couldn't, Joey.

1053
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,824
l got an idea.

1054
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:03,159
lt's an old family recipe.
Hangovers run in my family.

1055
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:05,495
My old man wrote the book.

1056
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:10,704
l think this will
straighten you out. Go on.

1057
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,037
Come on, Snuff.
Come on, boy. Up.

1058
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,212
A bagel.

1059
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:31,452
Something he picked up from me.

1060
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,524
Fine pupil.

1061
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:39,727
- You really don't feel well, do you?
- It's not just the hangover.

1062
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:43,764
You see, where l come from...

1063
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:48,241
a girl just doesn't spend the night
on a yacht and then stay for breakfast.

1064
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:51,778
Of course, we don't have
any yachts.

1065
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,905
By the way,
where do you come from?

1066
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,574
Albuquerque.

1067
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,786
What's wrong with Albuquerque?

1068
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:02,288
For one thing,
they don't have any yachts.

1069
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:05,622
Secondly, l'm surprised your mother
let you come to the big town.

1070
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:09,629
Well, my mother says a nice girl's
a nice girl wherever she is.

1071
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:12,165
Yeah, l know.
And a bum is a bum.

1072
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:14,167
She didn't say that.

1073
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:18,170
Besides, what about last night?

1074
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,106
l made a fool out of myself,
and you didn't take advantage of it.

1075
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,303
Don't pin any medals on me.

1076
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:26,313
lt just so happens in my book
it takes two to tango.

1077
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:30,145
Why are you ashamed
of your good impulses?

1078
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:32,516
Maybe it's because
l don't get many.

1079
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:35,681
You got a feIlow in Albuquerque?

1080
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:40,456
l suppose you could caIl him that.
His name's Alfred. Works in a garage.

1081
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:44,624
Grease monkey. No contest.
lt's a boat race.

1082
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,633
He owns the garage.

1083
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,638
Well, l better go.

1084
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,298
Thanks for everything.

1085
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,027
Maybe l ought to start
rehearsing that number.

1086
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:17,030
You mean, now that you're sober
you still wanna do the strip number?

1087
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,497
Was it your idea...

1088
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,229
or was it hers?

1089
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,237
Of course it was my idea.

1090
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:28,036
l run the joint, don't l?
lt says ""Chez Joey.''

1091
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:31,203
All right then, if you really want
me to do it, then l'Il do it.

1092
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:33,713
Good. l'm glad you decided to.

1093
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:40,372
The first guy who drops a knife
on the opening gets it in the back.

1094
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:44,516
That's all, kids. Thank you.
Okay, next number.

1095
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:42,435
l never thought she'd do it.

1096
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:46,906
l've seen 'em come and go,
but l thought this girl was different.

1097
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,513
Hold it.

1098
01:30:57,251 --> 01:30:58,718
Cut.

1099
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:02,255
You can all stop drooling.

1100
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:03,984
Put your clothes on.

1101
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:09,861
Well, what do you know.
Prince valiant.

1102
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:13,264
l'll hit you a shot in the head.
Get up and do the number.

1103
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:14,926
A pIeasure.

1104
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:36,686
Here. Try this.
Blow your nose.

1105
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:39,953
l'm sorry.

1106
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:43,292
Forget it.
lt was a nice try.

1107
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:46,492
No, it wasn't. lt was awful.
l just wanted to die.

1108
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:49,229
l know what you mean.

1109
01:31:49,303 --> 01:31:51,567
l guess your mother was right.

1110
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:55,803
A nice girl's a nice girl anywhere
and a bum is a bum.

1111
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,811
l shouldn't have let you do it.

1112
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:09,417
Fix your face and put on your dress.
We're gonna do the love song.

1113
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:19,322
Joey, somebody wants to see you.

1114
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:26,664
l won't be long.

1115
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:53,626
Hi, doll. What's the rush?
l was rehearsing.

1116
01:32:55,202 --> 01:32:57,466
lt may not be necessary.

1117
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,370
What do you mean?

1118
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:03,740
You lied to me.
You told me she quit.

1119
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:08,907
Well, she did,
but she decided to come back.

1120
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:12,509
Be reasonable, baby.

1121
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,920
The mouse means nothing to me. She needs
the dough. She's got a sick mother.

1122
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:17,924
Then tell her
to get Blue Cross.

1123
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:19,550
Get her out.

1124
01:33:21,495 --> 01:33:22,826
ls that an order?

1125
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,565
Yes, it is.

1126
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:32,733
- But l don't like orders.
- You'll obey or the club won't open.

1127
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:40,213
You mean you'd shut the whole thing
over one stagestruck little broad?

1128
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:43,946
lt isn't just one
stagestruck little broad.

1129
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:48,011
lt's what she stands for.
You paraded her in front of everybody.

1130
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:51,354
You made a fool of yourself--
of me!

1131
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:54,622
Now go out there
and tell the girl she's through.

1132
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:58,325
What are you waiting for?

1133
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:04,398
l told you something once.
l'm gonna tell it to you again.

1134
01:34:06,007 --> 01:34:08,407
Nobody owns Joey but Joey.

1135
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:13,871
l'll show you who owns Joey.

1136
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:22,818
Mike, pay everybody off.
Chez Joey is not going to open.

1137
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,222
And take down the sign.

1138
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:45,770
Joey, shalI l break the news?

1139
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:48,747
Thanks, Mike. l'll do it.

1140
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:55,285
Mr. Evans, we have the house lights on
the dimmer system. lt's all checked out.

1141
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:56,948
Fine.

1142
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:01,222
Mr. Evans, l've arranged
all the flowers like this.

1143
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:03,229
They're lovely. Thank you.

1144
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:09,030
- The tables will be ready for 7:30.
- Good.

1145
01:35:12,506 --> 01:35:14,838
Mike's okay now.
You wanna try it?

1146
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:16,843
Yeah, l'll try it.

1147
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,384
Gather around, kids.
l got something to tell you.

1148
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:31,425
l got a short announcement to make,
and this is gonna kill you.

1149
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,326
Don't look now,
but the joint's folded.

1150
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:41,726
l told you you'd get
a big laugh out of it.

1151
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,733
But l'm not kidding about it.
Chez Joey won't open tonight...

1152
01:35:46,807 --> 01:35:50,402
or tomorrow night
or any other night after that.

1153
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:54,576
l'm sorry to tell you this, kids,
but the party's over.

1154
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:59,215
The little lady picked up her marbles
and went home.

1155
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:25,534
- l'm sorry.
- Beat it, kid.

1156
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:32,216
l said beat it!
Leave me alone.

1157
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:10,286
Someone to see you, madam.

1158
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:14,357
- Show him in.
- But it's a young lady, madam.

1159
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:17,625
- A Miss English.
- Ask her to come in.

1160
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:23,594
This way, miss.

1161
01:37:29,977 --> 01:37:31,672
You wanted to see me?

1162
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:33,645
lt's about Joey.

1163
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:35,841
l know how you feel.

1164
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:38,350
And you're wrong.
There's been nothing between us.

1165
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:43,254
Are you sure about that,
Miss English?

1166
01:37:43,324 --> 01:37:45,087
l am quite sure.

1167
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:48,688
Let the club open, please.

1168
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:51,060
You're hurting
a lot of other people.

1169
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:55,727
You're not concerned with other people.
lt's Joey. You're in love with him.

1170
01:37:55,803 --> 01:37:57,327
Aren't you?

1171
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,172
Well, let's say
we understand each other.

1172
01:38:02,243 --> 01:38:05,235
We're alike, Joey and l--
the same breed of cat.

1173
01:38:05,312 --> 01:38:07,439
I'm not so sure of that.

1174
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:11,075
Joey's better than you think.
He's better than he thinks.

1175
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:14,581
Nobody's better than he thinks.

1176
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:19,424
lt may come as quite a surprise,
Miss English, but...

1177
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:23,686
l do believe there's been nothing
between you and Joey.

1178
01:38:23,764 --> 01:38:25,823
That makes you all
the more dangerous.

1179
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:30,667
You may not know it, but when Joey told
you to keep your clothes on today...

1180
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:33,605
he played the greatest love scene
of his career.

1181
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:40,447
l could undress in the lobby
of the Fairmont Hotel and...

1182
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:42,448
he'd never turn a hair.

1183
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:46,110
So, you see, Miss English...

1184
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:49,689
with you on the scene...

1185
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:52,317
l couldn't possibly
reopen the cIub.

1186
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,351
lf l wasn't on the scene?

1187
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:59,126
Well, I might give it
serious consideration.

1188
01:39:00,801 --> 01:39:03,895
After all, I rather enjoyed
owning a nightclub.

1189
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:08,236
Of course, it wouldn't do to let our boy
know why you're leaving town.

1190
01:39:08,309 --> 01:39:11,506
He dislikes being
under any obligation...

1191
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:14,172
except financial.

1192
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:58,083
Why not? l earned them.

1193
01:40:05,265 --> 01:40:08,393
You can unpack, Joey.
l've changed my mind.

1194
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:15,237
- l said l've changed my mind.
- l got ears.

1195
01:40:16,877 --> 01:40:19,710
But you don't understand.
lt's all right.

1196
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,873
The club will open.

1197
01:40:22,983 --> 01:40:24,780
lt won't happen again.

1198
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:27,980
Sure. One false move and
l'm right out on my Frances.

1199
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,782
That's not true.

1200
01:40:33,894 --> 01:40:37,523
very well. l'll prove it.

1201
01:40:37,598 --> 01:40:39,429
We'll get married.

1202
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:46,037
Don't give me that marriage bit.
Don't do me any favors.

1203
01:40:46,106 --> 01:40:48,097
lt isn't a favor.

1204
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:50,109
l want it that way.

1205
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:53,938
So the lady wants it that way.

1206
01:40:54,014 --> 01:40:55,879
""Well, jump, Joey.''

1207
01:40:55,949 --> 01:40:58,918
Now, darling, Joey,
you've had your fun.

1208
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:01,445
Can we go now?

1209
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:06,954
l got a big flash for you, Mrs. Simpson.
You and me ain't goin' nowhere.

1210
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:09,188
Don't take it so big.

1211
01:41:09,263 --> 01:41:11,891
l'm doing you a big favor.

1212
01:41:14,535 --> 01:41:17,595
Darling, l--
l want to marry you.

1213
01:41:18,672 --> 01:41:21,072
Take more than a gold band
and a two-buck license...

1214
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:23,735
to make an honest man
out of a bum like me.

1215
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:27,972
That's a little job
l'm gonna have to work out myself.

1216
01:41:28,048 --> 01:41:29,982
Thanks for the use of the pad.

1217
01:41:39,793 --> 01:41:41,385
l guess that's that.

1218
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:44,392
That's that.

1219
01:41:55,509 --> 01:41:57,443
ls it the mouse?

1220
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:01,246
Maybe.

1221
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:06,947
Maybe you should tell her.

1222
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:11,389
What for?
Why should l louse up her life?

1223
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:53,424
All of this could have been yours,
Joey-- the whole joint.

1224
01:42:54,968 --> 01:42:57,801
And you blew it
on account of two dames.

1225
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:00,897
You never seem to learn,
do you?

1226
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:17,923
Dames

1227
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:24,797
What do I care for a dame

1228
01:43:28,068 --> 01:43:31,162
Every old dame is the same

1229
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:33,798
Every hokey dame is the same

1230
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:37,775
l got a future
a rosy future

1231
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:40,142
You can be sure I'll be tops

1232
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:44,216
I'm independent
I'm no dependent

1233
01:43:44,284 --> 01:43:46,548
And l'll own a nightclub
that's tops

1234
01:43:47,788 --> 01:43:50,052
I'll be in with the cops

1235
01:43:52,593 --> 01:43:55,027
What do l care for the skirts

1236
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:01,026
l'll make 'em pay
till it hurts

1237
01:44:02,369 --> 01:44:05,167
Let 'em put up
till it hurts

1238
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,673
I'm gonna own a nightclub

1239
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:11,234
It's gonna be
the right club

1240
01:44:11,311 --> 01:44:14,610
For the swell gentry
it's elementary

1241
01:44:14,681 --> 01:44:17,275
l'll wear a top hat and cane

1242
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:22,080
In Chez Joey
They'll pay Joey

1243
01:44:22,155 --> 01:44:24,146
The gay Joey

1244
01:44:24,224 --> 01:44:28,160
l can see it

1245
01:44:28,228 --> 01:44:30,162
Plain

1246
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:09,589
So long, little bird.
Don't pick up any nails.

1247
01:46:27,447 --> 01:46:29,745
Where are we going?

1248
01:46:29,816 --> 01:46:31,750
What do you mean ""we''?

1249
01:46:31,818 --> 01:46:34,184
We're both out of work,
aren't we?

1250
01:46:35,255 --> 01:46:38,224
l don't know about you,
but l'm on my way to Sacramento.

1251
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:41,522
Fine. l've always wanted
to see the state capitol.

1252
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:47,761
Well, look, you asked me
to do the love song with you.

1253
01:46:47,834 --> 01:46:50,200
What are you trying to do,
crawl out of it?

1254
01:46:51,271 --> 01:46:54,672
- l thought we were good together.
- Are you out of your mind or something?

1255
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:59,269
Know what you're getting into?
l'll brush you off before the station.

1256
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:01,280
Why don't you beat it?

1257
01:47:04,484 --> 01:47:07,715
Look, l have no desire
to be hemmed in.

1258
01:47:07,788 --> 01:47:10,814
Now why don't you beat it?
Take the mutt with you.

1259
01:47:14,594 --> 01:47:17,529
Why don't you get out
while you got the chance?

1260
01:47:28,909 --> 01:47:34,176
What do you think l'm made of? Don't
you know l got a low boiling point?

1261
01:47:55,936 --> 01:47:58,928
Well, l guess we weren't
so bad at that, were we?

1262
01:47:59,005 --> 01:48:02,532
And l can use a girl in the act--
give it a little class.

1263
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:06,136
- l could always do a strip.
- Don't bring that up again.

1264
01:48:06,213 --> 01:48:08,408
Well, how about my billing?

1265
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:10,814
- Your what?
- My name? My picture?

1266
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:16,286
Well, it'lI be ""Joey Evans
and Linda English.''

1267
01:48:18,391 --> 01:48:20,859
Well, how about...

1268
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:22,485
""Joey and Linda Evans''?

1269
01:48:22,562 --> 01:48:23,859
lt"s shorter.

1270
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:26,490
l got a better idea.

1271
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:31,827
How about ""Joey Evans and Company''?
That's shorter still. Let's go.

1272
01:48:33,306 --> 01:48:36,901
And the simple secret
of the plot

1273
01:48:38,111 --> 01:48:42,047
ls just to tell them
that I love you a lot

1274
01:48:43,316 --> 01:48:48,515
Then the world discovers
as my book ends

1275
01:48:48,588 --> 01:48:52,456
How to make two lovers

1276
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:55,017
Of friends
