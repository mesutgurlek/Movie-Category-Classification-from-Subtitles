You shouldn't oughta wait *

329
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:25,267
* 'Cause now you're stuck
We wish you luck *

330
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,634
* Here comes a 6.8 *

331
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,334
* Who's fault? Who's fault? *

332
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,033
* The San Andreas' fault *

333
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,767
* 'Cause Mr. Richter
Can't predict *

334
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,000
* Her kicking our asphalt *

335
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,634
* Seismologists all say *

336
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:36,367
* Tectonic plates
Are in between *

337
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:37,868
* An encroaching
Crustal mantle *

338
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:39,734
* Yeah, so what the heck's
That mean? *

339
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:41,200
* It means a quake, a quake *

340
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,968
DOT & WAKKO:
* Oh, really, yeah, no fake? *

341
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,300
* We kind of had that feeling *

342
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,868
* When the ground
Began to shake *

343
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,200
* California's great
It's such a lovely state *

344
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,467
* And every lawn is sitting
On a continental plate *

345
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:55,467
* Los Angeles had fires
And a riot, and a flood *

346
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,234
* And then a drought
And a recession *

347
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:58,701
* And then now
We hear this thud *

348
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,434
* Of a quake, a quake *

349
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,100
ALL:
* How much more can we take? *

350
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,701
* We thought that we had
Seen it all *

351
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,033
* But this one
Takes the cake *

352
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,834
* The dirt *
* The rocks *

353
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,267
* And all those aftershocks *

354
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,267
ALL:
* It's just the planet
Moving granite *

355
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:11,434
* Several city blocks *

356
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:13,601
* L.A. town is falling down *

357
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:15,133
* While the ground
Moves around *

358
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:18,767
* We won't let it get us down
We're Californians *

359
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,267
* A quake *
* A quake *

360
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,300
* It's time
To pull up stake *

361
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,133
* We're all fed up
We can't deny it *

362
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,634
* Fires quakes
And floods and riot *

363
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:29,067
ALL:
* We want some place
With peace and quiet *

364
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:32,067
* So we're moving to Beirut *

365
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:34,834
[***]

366
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,367
[***]

367
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:05,501
ALL:
Go nuts!
