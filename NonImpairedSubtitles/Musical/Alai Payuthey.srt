Hey! Karthik,are you waiting

She didn't tell anything,
after her duty she left

When did she leave?

00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,959
Why there is an Auspicious thread
for the bride?

83
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,461
Why they are tying 3 knots?

84
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:11,807
The first knot is for the rights!

85
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,473
The second knot is for relationship!!

86
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,143

Oh! The knot,knot....knot....

88
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,657
What's the need for the Auspicious
thread to the bride?

89
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,833
Why they are tying 3 knots?

Mother,ls breakfast ready? where is it?

00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,364
Shut up! don't talk
too much

95
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,870
Close the book while you
are eating

96
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,709
What ever you study,it will not get
into your mind

97
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,706
And your food will also not be

101
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,714
Go! But,don't fall in
front of the train

102
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:26,543
lt will be problem to all

103
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,047
Will you both stop fighting
for sometime?

104
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,722
lf she behaves like you, why
should l fight with her?

105
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,550
See her hair,all dishavilled

106
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:33,725
ls this my mistake that
hair is dishavilled?

107
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,223
You should have tied it.isn't it?

108
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,224
Your sister is making plats,isn't it?

109
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,727
You always support sister,all others
are llnd class citizens for you

110
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,059
Then,why you gave birth to me?
you would have stopped after sister

111
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,230
See her temper

112
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,229
She is going to become a Doctor
and patients will be coming to her...

113
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,902
lf l was in death bed also,don't
take me to her

114
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,400
Okay,mother

115
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:50,567

121
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,598
You told me to fall in front
of the train

122
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,101
Fighter cock! l said don't fall
infront of the train

123
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,270
Sir,what's it?

124
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,434
Shakthi is going for
the exam,that's why....

125
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:21,602
Oh! that's the reason

126
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:23,934
Sister,l am coming...

127
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,107
Move,move....

128
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,942
This side...

00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:38,923
lt's alright

130
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,620
Grandpa,shave your face....

131
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,294
lt will,it will disturb you

132
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,457
Uncle...

133
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:50,461
l educated you & what sort
of work you have done?

134
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,637
Do you know,what work your
son has done?

135
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,139
He is also your son

136
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:55,803
Do you have doubt?

137
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,309
l was standing near the
spencer signal

138
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,645
And he & 4 of his friends
were on the bike

139
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,306
l don't know,whether they were
girls or boys

140
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,816
They wear wearing earings....

141
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,819
Full of smoke,do you understand?

142
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,489
What do you know,you & your
father will not understand anything

143
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,315
Why are you talking indirectly?

144
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,992
Mother,father saw me while
l was smoking

145
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,327
Bring me Coffee

146
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,995
Not his cigarette,he was smoking
somebody's cigarette

147
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,328
On his back seat,a girl wearing pant
was there on his bike

148
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,663
They both are sharing
a cigarette

149
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,171
What a wonderful scene?!

150
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,833
This kind of boy,born
in our family!!

151
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,171
Who was that girl? why are
you giving us shocks?

152
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,006
Mother,he is a guy like
a brother

153
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,010
Hey! That is very dangerous

00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,843
Grandma,he is Era,
Uncle classmate

155
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,849
You used to tease him
calling 'Needle',isn't it?

156
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,021
Hey! Keep quiet

157
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,858
Hey! You smoke & you room anywhere
l am not bothered

158
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:47,851
Then what?!

159
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,688
Don't smoke with my money
you earn & then smoke

160
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,857
Keep one cigarette in one hand
& another in other hand

161
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,362
You can even keep it on
your ear also

162
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,865
Oh! God! ls smoking a sin?

163
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,536
No,No-lt's a virtuous
deed

164
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,035
What do you all think
about me?

165
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,707
Am l printing money?

166
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,703
When l was at his age,l didn't
even have slippers

167
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,874
My father used to give me
only 25 paise

168
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,381
l'll go to the Hotel & take
a Dosa & Coffee

169
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,219
Then,l'll go to College
by walking

170
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,046
lf we give 25 paise in Madras -

171
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,386
Even the beggar will return
it to me -

172
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,387
Father,what's the problem?

173
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,392
You have come up with so many
difficulties,isn't it?

174
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,562
Okay,we'll accept it
we'll respect you

175
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,564
But,for that,shouldn't we wear
slippers & walk?

176
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,229
Slowly,you may drop
it down

177
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,560
Karthik,don't talk back

178
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,562
Yes,l am useless

179
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,567
For that,why is he always
finding fault with me?

180
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,567
Come,Come,Raja come!!

181
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,571
Give me your purse

182
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,404
You can talk nicely,but for this
you should come to me

183
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:40,908
Okay,No need!

184
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:41,738
Hey! Wait...

185
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,415
Look at his haughtiness,ln this
age he is like this...

186
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,582
At the age of 30,didn't you
show your anger?

187
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,583
l said a word about your sister,and
you didn't talk to me for 5 years -

188
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:53,925
He is like you....

189
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,761
Karthik,where are you going?

190
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,097
l am going to spend my father's
money by smoking

191
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,266
Grandpa,all your property is going
to go in smoke

192
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:19,781
Who is he? Who is your
future husband?

193
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:27,619
Who? Who is the King
of your headweight?

194
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:34,788
Who? Who is he? Who is
your future husband?

195
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:41,962
Who? Who is the King
of your headweight?

196
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,472
This is very silly?

197
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,470
What is silly? What?

198
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,472
You don't know who she is
and you don't know her name -

199
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,807
You don't know anything

200
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,812
How will you find her out in the
Population of 7 Million

201
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,986
ln the 7 million Population,how many
women will be there?

202
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,313
Tell me,Tell me

203
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:57,989
50% means,how many?

204
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,324
3 1/2 Million

205
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,822
ln this 3 1/2 Million Population -

206
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,662
How many women come under
the age group of 18-22?

207
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,824
10% means,how many?

208
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,492
3 1/2 lakhs,you don't know even this?

209
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,495
ln this 3 1/2 lakhs,how many
are from Medical College?

210
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,500
Oh! ls she a Doctor?

211
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,506
Tell me,Tell me,how many?

212
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,503
Keep it as 1%

213
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,835
1% means how many? 3500

214
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,509
ln this 3500,how many girls
will go by train from Tambaram?

215
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,682
No,there will be atleast 2%

216
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,680
2% means,how many?
-70

217
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,350
ln these 70 girls,l should
search only one girl

218
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,852
That's the subject matter.
Can we not find her?

219
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:31,681
We can!!

220
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,526
lt might be ''Love''

221
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,526
lf we see each other,will love occur?
lt's all foolishness

222
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,191
Then,whom you saw in the
morning at 8.55-

223
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,526
Why are you talking about him
at 10.30 in the night?

224
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,369
A mad guy is eying me
on the train

225
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:46,696
What can l do for that?

226
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:15,757
Oh! Friend,My friend...

227
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,267
This is not love,its only lust

228
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,339
Hey! You shut up

229
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,412
lt's not a true love which
admires only physical beauty

230
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,548
ln your body,your hormones
work overtime

231
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,979
Hey! Don't degrade my love

232
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,617
Then,is it true love?

233
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,122
Oh! The love which started
from Electric train,isn't it?

234
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,457
Or love at the first sight?

235
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,620
Hey! You stupid,shut up!

236
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,263
l think,you like him?

237
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,269
Poorni,will l love someone? 
who has no other job,they will love

238
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,299
lf you talk like this,definitely
you are in love

239
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,603
lt is seen on your face

240
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:56,338
What's it?

241
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,107
Suddenly,40 watts brightness
has come

242
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,044
Hey shut up!

243

See carefully,he will be
somewhere around

246
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,684
Didn't l tell you,he has
not come,l know

247
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:14,557
He must have come

248
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,128
Really!!

249
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,120
He will be here only

250
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,345
Hey! Look there!

251
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:44,554
Oh! Friend,my friend!

252

Oh! Friend,my friend!

Shall l ask him?

254
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,750
Go inside

255
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:16,712
Whom do you want?

256
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:19,624
Shakthi?!!

257
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:24,284
Shakthi! lsn't it?

258
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:25,829
You are insulting me!

259
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,732
Your Devadas is coming...

But,l am afraid if all

00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,189
But,l am afraid if all
this may become true

268
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,201
He has come here also

269
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,609
We'll wait here, Go
and talk to him

270
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,940
Where are you going?

And if l come to ask you

431
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,271
But,not for me,for Shakthi

00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,274
Varadharajan,a Popular Lawyer

00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:55,512
His son,Karthik...

Shakthi,ls it true what Poorni says?

435
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:00,450
Tell me

Have l educated you for this?

437
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,458
For this purpose only,have we borrowed
money & put you in the Medical College?

438
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,790
Mother,l didn't call anyone,they
are coming on their own -

439
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:14,464
What can l do?

440
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,725
You have only encouraged someone,that's why
they are coming here

441
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,692
l didn't encourage anyone
you always find fault with me!

442
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:20,800
Mother,Karthik is a good guy
you,shut up

443
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,141
To educate you,she didn't marry
and is going to the office -

444
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,467
Do you know that?

445
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,738
Mother,don't scold me

446
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,145
This year's college fee's is paid
from her loan

447
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,678
She herself didn't marry,Why
are you in a hurry?

448
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:33,982
You have selected a boy...

00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,067
ls this the place?
-Yes sir

450
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,305
They said 51 1 ,isn't it?-Yes

451
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,166
Park the car in the shade

452
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:04,847
Come,come

453
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:05,947
Sit down

454
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,176

455
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,177
Yes,please sit down

456
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,150
We thought that we have come
to the wrong house -

457
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,824
ln quarters,all houses look same
that's why l am confused

458
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,662
This is the standard of
middle class family

459
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:22,724
She is Saroja

460
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:23,834
Greetings

461
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,067
They both are my daughters

462
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,931
We know them,they have come
to my house

463
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,102
They even sang song

464
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,171
Really!

465
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:31,707
Sit down,Sit down

466
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,943
l don't know
l won't watch all that

467
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,374
All are secret plans

468
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,048
They tortured me a lot to see her
that's why,l came...

469
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,412
Shall we get coffee?

470
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:46,852
You sit down

471
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,490
Madam,l want coffee without sugar
She won't have it

472
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,663
Among these two girls,which one our
son is loving?

473
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,335
He will not remember faces

474
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,231
Even when l return from my brother's
house after 2 days -

475
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,269
He will ask me ''Who are you''?

476
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,532
Younger girl Shakthi!!

477
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,432
Okay

478
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,275
Haven't you fixed the alliance for
the elder daughter?

479
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,012
No

480
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:10,804
ls it?

481
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,682
Do you prefer arranged marriage or
else like your sister -

482
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,949
Without giving financial burden to
your parents,you will love someone

483
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:18,778
What are you talking?

484
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,654
There is no harm in asking her view

485
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,759
Asking questions is my
Profession

486
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,858
They call him as a criminal lawyer

487
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,228
May be you will earn money
by telling lots of lies

488
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,712
l have brought up my son as
a successful advocate's son

489
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,412
l have brought up my daughters
as Queens

490
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,018
We don't have that status...But...

491
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,184
Coffee may become cold,take it

492
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,583
lf Queen's father starts talking
he will keep on talking...

493
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:56,657
Let him talk

494
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,193
What l am trying to say is...

495
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,290
When the children attain the
age of 20 -

496
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,064
There's no need to ask you & me
to take a decision

497
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,164
That is the law,l had brought him up
by teaching the law

498
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,005
Sir,l didn't bring up my
daughters like that

499
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,137
You have mistaken me

500
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,110
l am explaining to you
the law

501
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:18,543
Not only your daughter but for any
girl going on the road

502
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,175
lf Karthik says
''l will marry her''

503
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,586
We can't do anything we must
accept the choice of that donkey

504
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,460
Are you pointing out that you are
rich and we are beggars?

505
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:31,322
Sir,when did you get this
proudness?!!

506
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:35,997
When you completed your education?!

507
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,595
Or after earning money?!!

508
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:39,795
Father!!

509
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,673
He has come to our house
and he is saying -

510
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,066
That our girl and the girl on
the road are same!

511
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,409
Mr.Selvaraj,you have mistaken me

512
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,511
l have mistaken you?

513
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,342
Sir,you are only talking
in a wrong way

514
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:57,620
l have come here to talk about
your daughter and my son

515
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:01,851
l didn't come here to talk about
our inferiority & Superiority complexes

516
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,193
My son is a Computer Engineer,l thought
he will rise to greater heights

517
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,956
l didn't expect that he will
indulge in love affair

518
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,098
Sir,no one has laid a bait
for your son's love

519
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,372
For a while,we'll not
discuss about this

520
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,376
lf my son ask me,what should
l reply? Tell me that

521
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,507
Tell him that we are honest
people,its enough

522
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,547
Hey! What happened?

523
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,393
l think it won't suit us
we'll leave it

524
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,225
We'll forget everything and
let us remain friends

525
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,727
We'll say bye to each other

526
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,224
Because of this,will the earth
stop functioning?

527
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,660
Did my father say anything
incorrectly?

528
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,406
Nothing was good,they talked
incorrectly

529
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:51,734
They talked beyond their
limits

530
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,903
lt was like a talk between
lndia & Pakistan

531
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,940
Shakthi,are they both going
to marry?

532
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,206
Only l & you are going
to marry

533
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,273
We asked their permission just
for a formality,that's all

534
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,343
Karthik,what do you want me
to do?

535
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,418
lf they didn't give respect to our love
we'll leave them

536
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,249
But,l can't

537
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:09,252
What! You can't?

538
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,093
l can't leave my Parents,my house
and my dog..

539
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,689
That means...

540
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,964
This love is not a big thing to you
isn't it?

541
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,363
From when do you know me?

542
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:23,372
For 20 weeks...

543
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,276
But my Parents are like my soul
for 20 years

544
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,943
l can't leave ''Them'' for ''You''

545
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,578
But,l can leave ''Anything''
for''you''!!

546
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,784
Today,for a girl,you are ready to
leave your parents & come -

547
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,646
Tomorrow,for another girl you
will not leave me

548
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:36,113
What's the guarantee for it?

549
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,949
Hello,your logic is horrible

550
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,293
Now,what? Sacrifice?
Am l its offering?

551
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,956
Why our love is so deep?

552
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,629
We met each other & talked

553
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:50,332
You were after me for sometime
and you made me happy

554
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,633
But now,you are making me to cry!!
That's it!

555
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,062
Earlier,lf l said ''No'' to you what
would you have done?

556
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,738
l would have thought you are
not lucky

557
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,308
Now,you think like that

558
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,144
Shakthi,what you are saying
is right

559
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:09,319
l accept that love is foolish...
but don't leave me..

560
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,481
Give me some more time

561
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,686
For one week,till 10th...

562
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,981
After that also,if you feel like this
tell me

563
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:14,990
We'll leave it

564
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,092
What will happen in one week?
Why unnecessarily...

565
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:17,884
Anything may happen within
one week..

566
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:18,493
Hey! Be careful!

567
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,157
l may convince you,you may change

568
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,424
or l may fall in love
with someone

569
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,157
Hey! What are you doing?

570
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,369
Shakthi,only one week,okay?

571
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,505
Simply we'll meet & talk
that's all,okay?!

572
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:29,502
No

573
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,863
Today-Nungambakkam Station
Night 7.55

574
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,563
Shakthi,open the door

575
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,107
l am Karthik speaking
Dr.Shakthi's husband

576
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,249
Hey! Keep quiet,l am talking
isn't it?

577
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,521
Do you know,where is Shakthi?

578
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,754
No,she has gone from the
hospital around 5.30

579
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:55,923
Has she not yet come
to the house?

580
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,430
No,l am calling from outside,she
might have gone home by this time

581
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:15,612
ls Raji there?

582
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,813
Hai Karthik,l am Raji speaking
How are you?

583
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,439
How is Shakthi?

584
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:25,617
How about you?

585
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:26,956
You are very busy,isn't it?

586
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,625
You are not coming to
meet us

587
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,620
They said,you have given
birth to a child

588
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:32,485
Yes,baby girl

589
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,791
We'll come & meet you
in the weekend

590
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,630
Come with Shakthi
-sure

591
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,584
Karthik,don't want this
1 week matter & all...

592
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,484
Leave it means leave it

593
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,984
Are you sure?

594
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:07,497
Okay

595
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,543
l pray to God that you get
an ugly & foolish wife!

596
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,187
Be like this,don't change

597
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:35,684
Always crying?

598
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,854
No,always smiling!!

599
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,948
For how many days you will
continue like this?

600
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,419
What do you mean by
how many days?

601
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,623
Hiding yourself like this instead of
train,you are going by bus,auto..

602
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,585
lf we leave anything we
should really leave it

603
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,594
lnstead we should not encourage love
its foolishness to test it

604
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:49,625
l don't want to do that
foolishness

605
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,595
What's it?

606
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,110
We'll succeed like Bill Gates

607
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:08,114
Or we'll go to jail like Financial
firms who won't return the deposits

608
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,121
Begining itself,he is talking
negatively

609
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:16,452
From today onwards,Cinema,House
Girls...all are stopped

610
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,389
ln the 1st year,we'll grow up
in Madras

611
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:25,795
And in the 2nd year - All lndia No.1
ln the 3rd year-lnternational

612
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,805
Future stars,shall we start
our work today itself?

613
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:41,150
Hey! Take that camphor packet

614
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,487
Karthik uncle,call for you

615
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:46,985
Who's it?

616
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:49,785
Hey! lt has become your habit,isn't it?

617
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,345
Shakthi,why are you not
talking?

618
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,439
Has the line got cut
-No

619
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:12,181
Then talk...

620
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,445
l won't listen to all
these things...

621
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:43,675
Where is your father?

622
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,215
Hey! Where are you?

623
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,218
Did you not say that after
finishing her Medicine -

624
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,720
We'll perform the marriage of Shakthi
with my son?

625
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:58,052
Mother,while coming from home
what did l say?

626
00:44:58,262 --> 00:44:59,058
You keep quiet

627
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,725
Only she must have refused it

628
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,725
She doesn't like our
family at all

629
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,494
What all l did for him?

630
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,294
He had grown up by eating
my food...

631
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,503
Hey! You have promised me! Don't
cheat your own sister

632
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,233
Sister,who is cheating whom?

633
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,306
How can l fix the marriage of Shakthi
before Poorni?

634
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,414
Hey! Who got the job for you
in Railway?

635
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:20,514
Why are you talking about
that now?

636
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,743
After my husband's death,l recommended
you for that job

637
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,420
Do l have to die returning
back that job?

638
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:25,917
Father!!

639
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:26,919
You will talk like this

640
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:30,191
Your daughter has done Medicine
isn't it?

641
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,258

that,don't forget us

642
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:39,433
One day or other,this Aunty will
parcel you & take you in the bag

643
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,329
Shakthi,have you got my point?

644
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:49,268
Shakthi,they are starting the old stories
trying to marry you to him

645
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,538
Be careful!

646
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,456
What are you doing here?

647
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,293
Where is Shakthi?

648
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,458
l thought you both had
separated

649
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,965
Yes,but..

650
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:13,795
Then what?

651
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,569
Nothing,since 4-5 days she has not
to be seen...where is she?

652
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,568
She has gone to U.S

653
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:23,979
Why?

654
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,482
She has not gone to U.S

655
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:26,580
She has gone for Medical
Camp,is it enough?

656
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:32,981
For 3 weeks

657
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,986
3 weeks?!!

658
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,820
Only for 3 weeks!! She will come back
here only

659
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:51,674
How much money do you want?

00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:52,500
Rs.2000/-

661
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:53,838
Why that much money?

662
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,408
Mother,l am going to town

663
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:56,677
Don't ask me why?

664
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,173
lf father comes to know about this,he
will break the house into two

665
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,348
Before that,you somehow arrange
the money & keep it

666
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:03,944
ls it for that girl?

667
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:07,690

Be careful,come back quickly

669
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:35,716

00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,267
Sir,where is the medical camp?

675
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:27,269
They have gone to
some other place

676
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:31,100

681
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:51,956
But,he didn't know that

With this sweet Melody,l'll
forget my sorrows!!

689
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:30,216
lf this melodious music was not here

690
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:34,219
Some one is playing the Music...!!

l am staying in the darkness
and listening to it!!

692
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,291
Why you took so many days
to search me?!!

lf they propose me to someone...

704

What are you saying?

707

your split second vision!!

794
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:29,037
Hey! Wife!!

796
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,206
Hey! You are my wife

797
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,035
Who are you to tell me?

798
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:36,712

799
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:39,544

Don't tell all these stories..
Get up-

00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,209
Come, sitdown

802
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,049
lf the young girls come alone
the guys will come immediately

803
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,394
Look,how he is seeing
you?

804
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:53,926
He touched your hand,isn't it?

805
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,388
We should not leave these
kind of guys

806
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,591
Sister,Are you married!

00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:34,929

lf it's true,tell me

816
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,373
Now,l can't tell you

817
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:42,110
Why you can't?

818
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,943
Doctor,you get away!!!

819
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:46,175
Karthik,l am going to putdown
the phone

820
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,713
Why? People are around you?

821
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:51,276
Okay,then,say it in whisper
Yes or No?

822
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:52,511

00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:53,518
Tell me,'Yes'

824
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,318
l said'Yes' to you

825
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,324
She will not say it!!

826
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:04,292
What? Haven't she said?

827
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,467
Hey! Do your work

828
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,013
Only 2 minutes more,l have asked
Poorni to wait at the Bus stop

829
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,814
Are you waiting for me
for a long time?

830
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,492
For these ''2 minutes''l can

831
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:35,821
Shall l go?

01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,759
No,don't go

833
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:46,671
Oh! My friend! My secret friend!!

Oh! Friend!! Listen to my
small,small wishes...

This same way of hugging me!!

837

l want this,till the end
of our life!!

838
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:19,468
Oh! My friend! My friend!!

839
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:23,610
My secret friend!!

Do small,small love things
beyond your limits!!

841
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:53,230
Blossom my cells by
your actions!!

842
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,571
Among the flower,you blossom!

843
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:02,642
Like the priest,
who is plucking flowers! slowly...

844
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:07,080
When l am sleeping,you
nip my nails!!

845
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:12,421
You sleep without any
sound!!

846
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:21,768
You should apply Olive oil
to me

847
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:30,445
When you cry,lf l also cry,l need
your fingers to wipe off my tears!!

848
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:40,285
Oh! Friend!! My friend!!

851
01:02:54,871 --> 01:03:02,300
Can the air come in between us
Oh! l was enjoined with my soul!!

852
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:08,480
Today,ln your Moon,with

854
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:26,833
ln your remembarance and in
your beautiful tradition!!

855
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:34,842
My Pride vanquished,my

856
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:44,745
What all you said,l'll do it
in the morning!!

857
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:49,015
What all you said,l'll do it
in the morning!!

858
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,022
Even what you didn't say,l'll do it
in the night!!

859
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:58,689
l'll love you & make you
to love!!

860
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:02,830
l'll roam by wearing
your shirt!!

861
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,200
When you take bath,l'll also
get wet a little!!

862
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:12,571
l'll carry you on my back!!

863
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,217
l'll gather you fully-

864
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:22,213
l'll cover you on my hand and l'll
hide you inside the kercheif!!

865
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:26,885
When you come outside,l'll
release you!!

866
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:31,064
And l'll fulfil my wish!!

867
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:35,566
Oh! My friend!! My friend!!

868
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,730
My secret friend!!

869
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:49,081
Oh! Friend!! Listen to my
small,small wishes...

870
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:07,797
Uncle it's she...

871
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:08,770
Wait

872
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:13,999
Don't think that
Poorni is quiet girl!

873
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,900
lf she starts talking,she'll
discuss about the Whole world!

874
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,772
There's only one problem,
she is very intelligent -

875
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,639
For that you'll have to co-operate
its possible,isn't it?

876
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:21,882
l'll try

877
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:28,256
Shakthi being the last kid,her father with his
indulgence brought her up differently!

878
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,153
But Poorni is
not like that -

879
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,691
She is patient
and a humble girl -

880
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:36,457
She goes to the Bank for her job and
she's also very responsible in her house

881
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,863
She doesn't get
angry at all

882
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,599
What about our Raghu Brother
he is a complete Saint

883
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,368
Because of him,l have
a bad name

884
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:48,909
From our side its okay
What,Raghu,is it fine?

885
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,579
We'll have to ask Poornima whether she
likes,and is it okay to her?

886
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,645
Poorni will agree for it -

887
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,816
Don't worry
about that

888
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:55,483
Please...

889
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:56,677
Tell,Uncle!

890
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:00,612
lf its okay from your side,on an
Auspicious day,we'll fix the marriage

891
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:04,319
You like,isn't it?
come on tell!

892
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,788
lsn't he handsome?
lsn't he intelligent?

893
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,460
l have given the groom coffee
should l give him the kercheif also?

894
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,997
No after seeing our Poornima
he's becoming eulogical!

895
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:13,998
Ay,look at Uncle

896
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,402
While talking this,l'll tell
what l felt in my heart!...

897
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,003
l didn't even talk to
Shyam about this -

898
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,707
You also have one more daughter
l too have one more son -

899
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,712
He is also studying medicine
even she is studying Medicine -

900
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,578
Let's ask both about
their opinions -

901
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,285
lf they like.we can perform both
the marriages at a time!

902
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:32,645
What do you say?

903
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:33,721
Madam

904
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,685
Don't mistake me l said
what l felt in my heart!

905
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,737
Come Shakthi come,don't
think Aunty,come

906
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,434
Good occassions come
like this only...

907
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:55,371
Mother!
-Wait!

908
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:57,671
Do they know that you have a groom
ready in your relatives itself -

909
01:06:58,247 --> 01:06:58,941
Mother,its not possible

910
01:06:59,148 --> 01:06:59,614
lt's possible,you go

911
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:00,474
Listen to me...

912
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,708
Go,he is more educated than me
stays in America

913
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:07,315
l can buy only the map of
America for Shakthi

914
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,455
lf something good has to happen,certain
useless have to be discarded

915
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,153
Mother,listen to what l say
atleast once?

916
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:12,755
First remove

917
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,727
Mother,please listen to
what l say?

918
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,558
You don't say anything
you have an evil tongue

919
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,231
Mother what's this uncivilized?
Going for two,silly!

920
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:21,831
Remove it
-Why?

921
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,369
You should atleast wear a
Silk saree and some jewels

922
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:25,005
Should you be
like this jewel less?

923
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:27,201
What's this? All this time l was
like this,isn't it? -

924
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,240
Now,why this
silk saree?

925
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:29,911
l'll remove!

926
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:30,912
Take

927
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,080
Wear them on your ear,and
around the neck

928
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:36,883
This is very indecent

929
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,982
ls this a discount business
buy one and take one free

930
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,147
Mother,its not possible listen
to what l say

931
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:43,518
Don't spoil the Poorni's proposal

932
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:53,933
Come

933
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:57,939
Come...

934
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:05,036
Suddenly

935
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:06,539
After hearing to
the proposal...

936
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,147
l am sorry,its a
little embarrasing

937
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:15,956
Had l knew,that they'll trap
me like this...

938
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,658
Father is always like this,he'll
burst out whatever he feels

939
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:30,604
lf l tell you honestly all my
family members have a fear -

940
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,474
Whether,l'll marry some U.S girl
a black girl etc...

941
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,969
That's why with Raghu's marriage
they are trapping me also!

942
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:42,815
Had they said

Mother,l don't want
such a marriage

1002
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,233
You don't want it
but look at her -

1003
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:50,744
What she needed,when she needed it

1004
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:51,738
Shameless

Oh! My beloved,you're my eyes,my tears

To express my love your life
will be insufficient!

1067
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:26,577
You're heart will never be able to
know the value of my love!

1068

But still my kiss will not

1085
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,559
No,wife is more important

1093
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:55,759
You leave today itself,give
me the key,give me

1094
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,065
Brother,what's this the other day,you
said it like your own house...

1095
01:23:58,266 --> 01:23:59,324
Who...Who said?

1096
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:01,632
You didn't pay the rent,
you didn't deposit the Society fund?

1097
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,338
Even you haven't constructed the
ceiling,raised the wall,plastered the cement

1098
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:06,905
Only for that,l am asking you
are you threatening me?

1099
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:08,302
l am going to call
the Police

1100
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:11,639
You have to pay me 5 months
rent as advance

1101
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,575
That's not on this month's 1st
its on the next 1st

1102
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:16,876
Oh God! l have dealt with many people
like you,don't play a game with me!

1103
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:19,747
Brother,Brother only now we have
started this Computer Software...

1104
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:21,979
Whether you start a Software or
Underwear,that's not my problem

1105
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,748
l need my rent that's it!
Arrange for it!

1106
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:31,856
Don't have these love scenes on
the staircase,have it on bed

1107
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:38,030
Ay,Bhaskar,in which directory
is that syntom file?

1108
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,533
Are you following
it or not?

1109
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:42,834
We are doing it,only they
haven't telephoned us yet

1110
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:50,447
Mr.Naidu,give us the project
Shave the head at Tirupathi

1111
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:51,777
Bhaskar's..

1112
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:58,185
Ay! lts a wrong number!

1113
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:02,192
All because of him
he'll shave the head

1114
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:11,563
Sorry,l had gone for fetching
vegetables,got late

1115
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,632
l am waiting for the
last 45 minutes

1116
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:15,641
Come!

1117
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,803
lf you knew,that you'll get late
you should have kept the keys up

1118
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:21,943
l got a little late,for that
so much of anger?

1119
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,777
You'll go somewhere and
come late as you wish -

1120
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:25,213
l should be
waiting outside

1121
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,978
What am l going out
on a pleasure trip? -

1122
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,280
l had gone for fetching things to
cook food for you,isn't it?

1123
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:31,753
Who said that don't go,why are you
making me wait like a watchman?

1124
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:34,319
Didn't you wait for 3 hours on
the beach,before the marriage -

1125
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:35,927
Now,can't you wait
for 10 minutes

1126
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:36,753
That's different

1127
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:38,097
What do you mean
''Different''?

1128
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,667
That was before the marriage

1129
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,596
Then after the marriage
that's all,isn't it?

1130
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:45,300
Now,who said like this
open the door

1131
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,231
Now you said
isn't it?

1132
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:47,100
Shakthi,open the door

1133
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:48,865
Don't change your words
-Open the door!

1134
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:49,736
Then,why did you say?

1135
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:50,603
Why did you say
like that?

1136
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:51,437
Did you say or not?

1137
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,375
Don't ask standing outside
you come in,l'll tell you,Go in...

1138
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:53,876
Tell me?

1139
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:54,446
Get in,l'll tell

1140
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:55,013
Tell me? Why you tell like that?

1141
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:55,773
Get in,Get in,Go...

1142
01:25:58,553 --> 01:25:59,019
Give me

1143
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,785
Ay,do you know,how long was
l waiting for this

1144
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:04,691
Leave me
-l'll not

1145
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:06,861
Leave,Leave,Leave,not now

1146
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:07,860
Why?

1147
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:08,758
ln the afternoon you want...

1148
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:11,022
So,what if its
afternoon

1149
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:14,334
Ay leave me,after fighting with me
now you are even hugging me

1150
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:16,901
l fought with you
only for this

1151
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,102
lts all for you

1152
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:20,704
Leave me,l haven't even taken my
bath after coming from the hospital!

1153
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:22,707
Move

1154
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:23,206
l'll not

1155
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:23,809
Move

1156
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:24,376
Hug me

1157
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:25,045
Move...

1158
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:30,082
What's this?

1159
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,017
l am marking the day
which we fought

1160
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:33,053
For what?

1161
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,687
To show how big a problem
is marriage

1162
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:36,890
Oh! Cruel!

1163
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:44,721
What are you searching?

1164
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:48,292
You haven't even given a cup of coffee
to your husband

1165
01:26:58,613 --> 01:26:59,045
What are you searching?

1166
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:00,380
The Auspicious thread!!

1167
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:03,310
You sinner! Are you
a Traditional Tamil girl

1168
01:27:03,985 --> 01:27:05,953
Don't laugh,last night you had removed
it because it was hurting you

1169
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:08,916
Me...? Are you blaming me
after losing it

1170
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,987
The time is not good,if anything happens
to me,my wife will be responsible for it

1171
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:14,752
Don't scare me

1172
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:16,086
Where has it gone?

1173
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:18,831
l am sitting like a Statue of God
infront of you -

1174
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,597
Leaving me,you are searching for the
Auspicious thread

1175
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:22,770
l only want the Auspicious thread
l don't want you,Go

1176
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,703
Allright,search the auspicious thread
and marry that itself

1177
01:27:26,107 --> 01:27:26,630
ls there any one?

1178
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:27,573
Who is it?

1179
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:31,938
Are you too busy?

1180
01:27:32,146 --> 01:27:32,635
No,No

1181
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:33,313
Was it Good?

1182
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:35,240
Wasn't it good?

1183
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:35,914
What?

1184
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:39,616
Oh God,Last night didn't l send
you hot fish curry for your dinner?

1185
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,755
After eating you didn't even
say a word about it

1186
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:44,117
Oh! l am sorry,it was very good
we ate the entire

1187
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:47,555
Should l ask for it? Allright
can l have the vessels?

1188
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:48,361
This one,isn't it?

1189
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:49,229
Yes,this one

1190
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:53,796
Oh God,if l give someone Rs.1 Lakh
and that person cheats me,l can bear -

1191
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,560
But,l can't bear if the
lid gets exchanged

1192
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:56,134
Should l leave?

1193
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:00,433
What have you done?
-What?

1194
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:01,141
This

1195
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:04,143
What's that hanging like a garland?

1196
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:07,813
This is an Auspicious thread
isn't it?

1197
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:09,449
This is a real marriage
isn't it?

1198
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,416
Oh God! Please
save them

1199
01:28:15,223 --> 01:28:16,554
Karthik,is it
your work?

1200
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:18,723
He's putting my honour in stake!

1201
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:21,320
Ay,where are you,why are
you taking my life?

1202
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:28,263
Your friend has come

1203
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:30,227
Just watch,in another 1 minute
a fight will flare up

1204
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:31,163
Don't tell it
just like that!

1205
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:32,238
You just watch

1206
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:33,503
You shouldn't start the fight!

1207
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:34,332
l'll be quiet

1208
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:40,477
What happened about
Hyderabad?

1209
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:43,381
Hai wife,what are
you doing?

1210
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:44,284
Hai husband

1211

01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:46,583
l have made it,you go

1213
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:49,351
Are you telling it because
Meera is there

1214
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:54,019
30 seconds

1215
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:55,160
He is sweet

1216
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:10,767
Shakthi,where is my
project report?

1217
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:11,576
Why are you
asking me?

1218
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:15,611
l had kept it
here only

1219
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:18,551
Coming,Coming,Coming...
Don't shout

1220
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:19,685
Don't lose my papers

1221
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:21,821
Shakthi,tomorrow l have
a presentation -

1222
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:22,754
These papers....

1223
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,059
Shakthi,that report....

1224
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:14,938
The care you're showing,when
you saw me!

1225
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,607
lf you have even a little,when you
do not see me,would be much better!

1226
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:20,606
You didn't even see whether
we are alive or....

1227
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:25,615
l do have care for you in plenty
only you're not recognizing it!

1228
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:28,451
Not a day passes without your
thoughts and its distress!

1229
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:30,620
Have you ever felt distressed
with my thoughts?

1230
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:32,459
You would have only cursed me
isn't it,sister?

1231
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:33,452
How are you?

1232
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:35,629
How many time l would have
called Nadar's stores!

1233
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:36,964
Did you come even once
on the line?

1234
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:38,461
You too have left me,isn't it?

1235
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:40,463
Mother,how's father?

1236
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:43,800
He has been Hospitalised!

1237
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:47,807
Mother! Why? What happened?

1238
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:51,645
What do l know? Did l study Medicine?

1239
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,474
That's...what did they say?

1240
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:03,650
Did they say it as Jaundice?
Have they diagonised it lmmediately?

1241
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:06,486
Mother,why has he been admitted
into a Hospital?

1242
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:07,995
l want to see father immediately!

1243
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,494
Don't tell him that,l had met
you and talked with you!

1244
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:14,331
He'll get better,if
he sees you!

1245
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:20,362
l have come here to beg you,to
come & see your father!

1246
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:43,196
Hey! Didn't you go to work?

1247
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:47,030
lt seems father isn't keeping
good health!

1248
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:52,873
We'll go and...

1249
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:56,202
...We don't have parents!!!

1250
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:58,211
You have only''me'' and l have only''you''
that's what you had said!

1251
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:04,381
He has been admitted into
the Railway Hospital!

1252
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:06,379
Shakthi! Who told you that?

1253
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:08,885
Why do you want that?....

1254
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:09,715
Who told you?

1255
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:15,053
Mother told me!

1256
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:17,389
l met her in the Train!

1257
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:20,901
Without coming to Home!

1258
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:22,228
Without my knowledge
only for you!

1259
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:26,065
Karthik,please listen to
what l say?

1260
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:28,238
He's just an ordinary
Railway Employee!

1261
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:30,911
He struggled and took loans to
make me study Medicine!

1262
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:33,743
Now,he's not well!....

1263
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:35,909
lf l don't go there now,what's
use of me studying Medicine?

1264
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,246
Okay! You go and see him!...

1265
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:41,914
....But,l'll not come!!

1266
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:49,422
Karthik,Can't you do atleast
this for me?

1267
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:53,934
Shakthi! Do you want me to come there
throwing away my honour,prestige!

1268
01:32:55,803 --> 01:32:56,929
He has slapped me!

1269
01:32:57,638 --> 01:32:58,434
....l can never forget it!

1270
01:32:58,806 --> 01:33:00,103
Even my own father has
never beaten me!

1271
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:04,111
lt's better to die than to come
face to face with him!

1272
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:09,279
ln this world l don't have even
10 people who l may need!!

1273
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:12,282
lf l want you,l have to
forsake them!

1274
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:14,454
lf l want them,then,l have to
forsake you! How is it possible?

1275
01:33:15,656 --> 01:33:16,782
Shakthi,do whatever you feel
like doing?

1276
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:18,958
lf You want them,
go their home,Go

1277
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:20,460
lf you want to come back
or may be not!

1278
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:21,624
Do whatever you want to do?

1279
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:23,297
But,Please leave
me alone!

1280
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:44,814
Just one marriage means
so many troubles!

1281
01:33:45,853 --> 01:33:47,480
l don't know how people
marry 2 or 3 times?

1282
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:48,651
Our Rohit will marry....

1283
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:50,987
...2 or 3...

1284
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:57,164
How is your father?

1285
01:33:58,699 --> 01:33:59,324
How do l know?

1286
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:02,666
l had told you to go
and see your father!

1287
01:34:04,038 --> 01:34:05,835
You had even told about
killing yourself!

1288
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:07,841
Okay!....

1289
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:10,510
Tomorrow,we both will go!

1290
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:12,838
No Karthik!

1291
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:15,348
We'll not go to the House
who don't respect you!

1292
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:17,175
Leave that aside!

1293
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:19,182
Tomorrow morning we'll go!

1294
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:23,682
You go inside and see him!
l'll stand outside!

1295
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:24,854
Please,you also come inside!

1296
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:26,690
Let him see that we are
happy together!

1297
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:28,028
Are we really happy?!

1298
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:29,025
You're going to get
beating for this!

1299
01:34:30,231 --> 01:34:32,529
Karthik,if he talks anything
out of anger-

1300
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:33,700
You'll not take it
seriously! isn't it?

1301
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:35,365
Even if he slaps me again
l'll bear it!

1302
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:18,575
Shouldn't you have come
a day before?

1303
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:36,429
l have lost my brother....

1304
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:51,441
Hey! You have become the cause
of death of your father!

1305
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:53,940
Father! Look,l am Shakthi!
who has come

1306
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:56,776
lf you had come early you would
have met your father!

1307
01:35:56,984 --> 01:35:58,611
Father,Shakthi has again
come back to our House

1308
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,281
Father,please,open your eyes!!
and see for once

1309
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:21,967
Mother,why did you give
birth to me?

1310
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:26,142
Mother,why did you bring me up
like an obstinate girl?

1311
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:29,479
The day when l spoke
illmannerly!

1312
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:30,650
lf you had broken my limbs and
threw me in a corner!

1313
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:31,647
Would this had happened?

1314
01:36:34,522 --> 01:36:36,490
Mother,why did you allow me to
go out of the House?

1315
01:36:38,192 --> 01:36:38,817
ls your mistake!....

1316
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:42,496
Dream of making me a Doctor....

1317
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:45,658
...He never had any other wish!

1318
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:50,499
Mother,when he wasn't well
where was l?

1319
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:53,666
Why do you need marriage
and family?...

1320
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:54,841
...Saying this why didn't you beat me
and brought me back to Home?

1321
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:56,168
Why did you
leave me?

1322
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:58,671
Was he so angry on me?

1323
01:36:59,713 --> 01:37:01,510
He left without even seeing me!

1324
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:06,345
l have done a mistake....
....l have done a great mistake!

1325
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:09,682
Mother,tell me to say that
he has forgiven me!

1326
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:13,018
Mother,atleast you tell that
you have forgiven me!

1327
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:15,525
Mother...atleast you...

1328
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:16,354
No need for all that!

1329
01:37:18,065 --> 01:37:19,191
Whatever you may say....

1330
01:37:21,068 --> 01:37:24,196
Even for 1 minute can you make your
father come alive before me?

1331
01:37:26,574 --> 01:37:27,199
lt is not possible....isn't it?...

1332
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:30,710
...Then don't talk!

1333
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:32,871
Get out!!

1334
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:43,379
They won't inform and go from a
House of death!...Go!

1335
01:37:50,097 --> 01:37:51,894
Because of our marriage,Poorani's
marriage was broken!

1336
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:56,562
Both homes broke up,and one even
went up to the cremation grand!

1337
01:37:59,607 --> 01:38:01,234
How am l going to face Shakthi?

1338
01:38:03,444 --> 01:38:05,071
Till his last,he left with anger

1339
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:09,575
He died with a sorrow forgetting
a daughter like me!

1340
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,756
She pestered....but l didn't
take her there!

1341
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:20,760
l could have taken her there and
spoken with him!

1342
01:38:22,963 --> 01:38:24,089
l was obstinate!

1343
01:38:26,634 --> 01:38:27,430
Okay! Leave it!

1344
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:31,605
Why do you want to unnecessarily take it
upon yourself and get distressed?

1345
01:38:32,139 --> 01:38:33,265
My father used to say always...

1346
01:38:34,808 --> 01:38:36,435
That he'll go only after
marrying me to a good boy

1347
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:40,280
Shakthi! Elders will never
go away from us!

1348
01:38:40,814 --> 01:38:41,940
They'll always be with us!

1349
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:45,118
He would have come to know that
Karthik is a good boy!

1350
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:48,288
That's why,he has left us
and went away!

1351
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:50,453
Take this coffee...

1352
01:38:50,824 --> 01:38:51,620
...Please have this coffee,my child!

1353
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:06,803
How many more days,are you going
to cry within yourself?

1354
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:07,803
Then,what do you want me
to do?!

1355
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:09,635
Anger can't be dissolved
with tears!

1356
01:39:11,178 --> 01:39:12,145
l am not angry on anyone!

1357
01:39:13,514 --> 01:39:15,311
l am angry on myself
for being selfish

1358
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:19,311
l had decided considering
only my choice!!

1359
01:39:20,688 --> 01:39:21,655
That's why,God has
done all this!

1360
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:24,157
Why are you beating
around the bush?

1361
01:39:24,858 --> 01:39:25,825
...Why don't you say it
straight on my face?

1362
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:28,328
That you have killed
my father!!

1363
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:30,155
Not you....it's me!!!

1364
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:30,830
Look....

1365
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:33,333
...The man who's gone,isn't
going to come back!

1366
01:39:36,203 --> 01:39:36,828
Whenever you cry!

1367
01:39:37,371 --> 01:39:38,497
As if you're saying
it's all because of you!!

1368
01:39:39,873 --> 01:39:40,840
Tell me,if you don't want
to see me!

1369
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:42,676
Even l'll also get lost!

1370
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:43,501
Alright! You also go away!

1371
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:47,673
After that without anyone for me
l'll distress alone and die!

1372
01:39:49,383 --> 01:39:51,180
What'll be my fate?
what's written in fate?...

1373
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:52,181
Stop!! Enough!!

1374
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:57,186
Don't talk with me for my
entire life! lt's enough!...

1375
01:40:10,404 --> 01:40:11,029
...What l mean to say....

1376
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:11,704
No need,don't say
anything!

1377
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:15,371
lt's alright! When l can live
without my father!

1378
01:40:16,243 --> 01:40:17,210
l can live without you also!

1379
01:40:17,745 --> 01:40:18,370
Don't worry!

1380
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:30,890
Where are you going?

1381
01:40:31,592 --> 01:40:36,052
Leave me! Don't utter even a word!
lt's enough!

1382
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:00,587
Hello! ls it Hyundai Factory?

1383
01:41:01,789 --> 01:41:03,757
Can l speak to works manager
Mr.Raghuraman?

1384
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:06,926
What should l say?

1385
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:08,924
lt's enough,if you say only
what is written on this?!

1386
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:10,593
l wouldn't be in any soup,isn't it?

1387
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:12,595
Talk softly like a girl!
that's enough!

1388
01:41:13,801 --> 01:41:14,927
Hello l am....

1389
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:16,432
....l am unable to talk!

1390
01:41:16,637 --> 01:41:17,763
l'll hit you! Look here and talk!

1391
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:19,264
My name is Poorni!

1392
01:41:19,473 --> 01:41:19,939
Soft soft soft....

1393
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:23,609
My name is Poorni,l am calling
from Tambaram Nirmala College!

1394
01:41:23,811 --> 01:41:24,778
Do you remember me?

1395
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:27,605
How are you?

1396
01:41:28,315 --> 01:41:31,284

1398
01:41:35,155 --> 01:41:37,123
Don't worry! l'll not kidnap you!

1399
01:41:41,662 --> 01:41:43,289
l am Raghuraman from Hyundai
factory speaking!

1400
01:41:44,998 --> 01:41:45,623
What do you want?

1401
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:48,301
l want to meet you personally
for a small talk!

1402
01:41:49,002 --> 01:41:50,469
Your family had insulted us
isn't that enough?

1403
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:51,638
Please,only for 5 minutes!

1404
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:56,472
When you're going home,l'll meet you

1405
01:41:58,512 --> 01:41:59,979
l'll meet you by 4 PM only
for 5 minutes,please!!

1406
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:21,159
lt seems he is that
Hyundai Guy!

1407
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:22,498
Only God should save!

1408
01:42:24,037 --> 01:42:27,006
My family was destroyed
dispersed and perished!

1409
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:28,841
Are you happy?

1410
01:42:31,044 --> 01:42:34,673
The day you came and went away
they had started crying...

1411
01:42:35,048 --> 01:42:36,345
lt hasn't yet stopped!
ls it enough?

1412
01:42:36,717 --> 01:42:37,513
Whatever happened,has happened?

1413
01:42:38,218 --> 01:42:40,345
lf you think that all was wrong because
of our wrong doings...

1414
01:42:41,054 --> 01:42:42,021
l don't think this
will come good...

1415
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:44,683
Calling personally one who
is depressed to feel happy!

1416
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:45,859
What do l do without getting
angry on such people?

1417
01:42:46,059 --> 01:42:47,356
Excuse me! You only called me!

1418
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:48,023
Me!?!

1419
01:42:48,395 --> 01:42:49,862
You only called me!
Am l mad?

1420
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:52,357
No! You only called my factory
to meet personally...

1421
01:42:52,566 --> 01:42:54,033
Not me! You only called
my bank!

1422
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:54,700
Wasn't it you who had talked?

1423
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:57,029
Told me to come at 4 p.m to
disrespect me personally!

1424
01:42:57,404 --> 01:42:58,530
Who's that,who had called
me by 4.30 p.m?

1425
01:43:03,243 --> 01:43:04,210
l am quitting from this game!

1426
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:16,218
ls it your handy work?

1427
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:23,726
Are you bringing a
couple together?

1428
01:43:24,598 --> 01:43:25,565
Otherwise are you working
as a Marriage broker?

1429
01:43:26,433 --> 01:43:27,229
l feel like using choicest abuses...

1430
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:30,896
The marriage which was stopped
because of me!

1431
01:43:31,438 --> 01:43:32,905
A small wish that it
may happen that's all!

1432
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:36,906
You have done so much
for Shakthi!

1433
01:43:37,778 --> 01:43:38,904
For that,l wanted to repay by
doing a good thing but...

1434
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:43,408
Please forgive me!

1435
01:43:51,959 --> 01:43:52,584
What? ls it a flop?

1436
01:43:53,794 --> 01:43:54,920
ls it a bigger flop than
our company?

1437
01:43:56,296 --> 01:43:56,762
Come!

1438
01:43:59,633 --> 01:44:01,601
lts more than 10 days since we
talked with each other!

1439
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:03,436
Marriage means,it'll be
like that only!

1440
01:44:04,304 --> 01:44:06,431
Do you know that,not a single day passes
without me and Rajesh fighting?

1441
01:44:07,975 --> 01:44:08,771
We were never like that!

1442
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:13,105
May be Karthik doesn't
like me anymore!

1443
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:18,947
Leaving you,he isn't roaming with
other girls! Why bother?

1444
01:44:19,486 --> 01:44:21,113
Look,everything will be alright!

1445
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:24,450
l was considering you both as
perfect in all our group!

1446
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:26,622
Why are you bothering yourself?
...Come...!

1447
01:44:42,009 --> 01:44:42,976
One ice-cream for both of you!

1448
01:44:43,677 --> 01:44:44,302
What did you say?...

1449
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:45,303
What did she say that day...

1450
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:47,480
...Am l a marriage broker to
bring a couple together?

1451
01:44:48,849 --> 01:44:49,816
She wanted to mouth
choicest abuses?..

1452
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:51,984
Now,it doesn't seem to
look like that!

1453
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:53,987
Are you both convinced?

1454
01:44:54,688 --> 01:44:56,315
Why are you staring?
Come on tell!...

1455
01:45:00,193 --> 01:45:02,161
Hey! When is the marriage?...
When is the marriage?

1456
01:45:03,196 --> 01:45:04,663
He has told that he'll come and
talk in another 2 days!

1457
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:04,386
l want to tell you one thing...

1458
01:46:06,593 --> 01:46:07,389
Okay,l'll tell you later!

1459
01:46:08,929 --> 01:46:10,897
ln my office Rohit's marriage
has been settled!

1460
01:46:12,099 --> 01:46:13,396
With both families consent!

1461
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:15,893
...Not like us!

1462
01:46:17,437 --> 01:46:18,870
Tomorrow,all my friends are going
out together!

1463
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:24,736
There may be 100 problems
between us!

1464
01:46:25,278 --> 01:46:26,575
But no one outside should
know about it!

1465
01:46:27,781 --> 01:46:31,080
They are thinking that we
both are an ideal couple!

1466
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:34,078
Come atleast for me!

1467
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,096
How did you manage
to bring her?

1468
01:46:48,468 --> 01:46:49,093
Everything is like that only!

1469
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:51,270
Now it'll be like that only!

1470
01:46:51,471 --> 01:46:53,268
But after marriage you're a gonner
Doomed forever!

1471
01:46:54,141 --> 01:46:54,937
Hey! Ashok! Keep quiet!

1472
01:46:55,142 --> 01:46:56,268
You seem to look like a
very good girl!

1473
01:46:56,643 --> 01:46:57,769
How did you deceived like
this with Rohit?

1474
01:46:58,145 --> 01:47:00,613
Just as l got deceived by Shakthi
Another sinner got stucked up!

1475
01:47:02,315 --> 01:47:04,283
Hey! What's all this guys? lnstead of
Greeting,why are you scaring me?

1476
01:47:04,484 --> 01:47:06,452
Buddy! You're getting really
married! No,don't do it!

1477
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:07,620
lt'll be very difficult!
lsn't it?

1478
01:47:07,821 --> 01:47:08,446
Well said!

1479
01:47:08,655 --> 01:47:09,451
Hey! You'll get thrashed!

1480
01:47:09,656 --> 01:47:10,953
You are married and happy!

1481
01:47:11,158 --> 01:47:12,625
Are you scaring one who's
going to get married?

1482
01:47:12,993 --> 01:47:13,960
Hey Boy! You don't worry!

1483
01:47:14,828 --> 01:47:16,125
After marriage all men will
be like this only!

1484
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:17,125
Their true colours will be out!

1485
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:17,796
How,How,How....

1486
01:47:17,998 --> 01:47:19,124
First they'll open the car door!

1487
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:21,293
After that,they'll hold
the umbrella!

1488
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:25,467
After that,with great love...
they'll chase like gentlemen!

1489
01:47:26,673 --> 01:47:27,298
But after marriage...

1490
01:47:27,507 --> 01:47:28,303
After?...

1491
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:29,634
Everything will fly out of
the windows!

1492
01:47:31,845 --> 01:47:34,143
Look at me! l am even
pressing my wife's legs!

1493
01:47:34,347 --> 01:47:35,974
lt's more than enough if you
don't pull my legs!

1494
01:47:36,183 --> 01:47:37,309
Only 25 days are remaining
for the marriage!

1495
01:47:39,019 --> 01:47:39,644
You get married!

1496
01:47:40,353 --> 01:47:43,151
The difficulties l am undergoing,let
this whole World also undergo!

1497
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:45,984
Okay...Okay...Who all want
me to marry?

1498
01:47:46,193 --> 01:47:46,989
Who..Who...

1499
01:47:47,527 --> 01:47:48,994
Now who all don't want
me to marry?

1500
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:52,498
Marry...but...

1501
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:55,001
Tell...Tell...Tell...

1502
01:47:55,535 --> 01:47:56,832
My sorrow is lost...

1503
01:47:58,538 --> 01:48:00,005
My happiness is lost...

1504
01:48:05,712 --> 01:48:07,509
My happiness is lost!

1505
01:48:23,563 --> 01:48:30,366
September month!...September month
Lost the sorrows of the life!

1506
01:48:30,737 --> 01:48:37,370
September month...September month!
Lost the sorrows of the life!

1507
01:48:41,248 --> 01:48:47,881
October month...October month!
Lost the happiness of life!

1508
01:48:48,088 --> 01:48:51,057
When you lost your sorrows...

1509
01:48:51,424 --> 01:48:54,552
Love was born at that time....

1510
01:48:54,928 --> 01:48:58,227
When you lost the happiness..

1511
01:48:58,431 --> 01:49:01,730
You got married at that time..

1512
01:49:02,102 --> 01:49:08,905
September month...September month
Lost the sorrows of the life

1513
01:49:09,276 --> 01:49:15,738
October month...October month
Lost the happiness of life!

1514
01:49:16,116 --> 01:49:19,244
When you lost your sorrows...

1515
01:49:19,452 --> 01:49:22,580
Love was born at that time...

1516
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:26,247
When you test the happiness...

1517
01:49:26,626 --> 01:49:31,928
You got married at
that time!

1518
01:49:51,151 --> 01:49:59,957
Oh girl! Love is like a feast of sweets!
Marriage is the bitterness of the neem!

1519
01:50:00,493 --> 01:50:07,456
Oh! My boy! Love sees only strengths
Marriage sees only weaknesses!

1520
01:50:08,668 --> 01:50:13,628
Oh Girl! Love is seen only by half eye!
Marriage is seen by 4 pairs of eyes!

1521
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:20,143
On the tip of the noses,love enjoys
even the beauty of crows!

1522
01:50:20,847 --> 01:50:27,480
After marriage even mole hills become
mountains! Why this clashes?

1523
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:34,483
Men without women,man can't
have the consolation!

1524
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:41,824
lf women aren't there in this World
men may never need consolation!

1525
01:50:42,202 --> 01:50:45,330
September month...September month!

1526
01:50:49,209 --> 01:50:52,337
October month...October month!

1527
01:51:24,077 --> 01:51:29,208
l have found out the love means
heavy chains!

1528
01:51:29,416 --> 01:51:33,216
Marriage means Auspicious chain
what can l do?

1529
01:51:34,587 --> 01:51:40,548
Postpone the marriage till 90 and
come my love,let's cross 100 also?

1530
01:51:41,594 --> 01:51:46,054
My friend! l don't get the love's irons
and splinters in marriage's cot!

1531
01:51:46,933 --> 01:51:50,232
There's no happiness in relationship in
which there isn't a separation!

1532
01:51:50,437 --> 01:51:52,905
That's what is love!

1533
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:59,742
Come let's live with sometime with relationship
and sometime with separations!

1534
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:07,580
Without men,women don't
have the consolation!

1535
01:52:07,954 --> 01:52:13,756
lf there aren't any men in this World
there's no need for consolation!

1536
01:52:15,128 --> 01:52:21,931
September month...September month
Lost the sorrows of the life!

1537
01:52:22,302 --> 01:52:28,764
October month...October month
Lost the happiness of life!

1538
01:52:28,975 --> 01:52:32,274
When you lost your sorrows!

1539
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:35,607
Love was born at that time...

1540
01:52:35,982 --> 01:52:39,281
When you lost the happiness...

1541
01:52:39,486 --> 01:52:44,788
You got married at that time

1542
01:52:53,833 --> 01:52:54,800
You have lost interest
in me,isn't it?

1543
01:52:56,002 --> 01:52:56,798
Why are you starting it now?

1544
01:52:58,171 --> 01:52:59,297
Or else has marriage become bitter?

1545
01:53:00,507 --> 01:53:01,633
What l said was just for fun...

1546
01:53:02,509 --> 01:53:03,806
lf you don't feel like that in your
heart,will it come out?

1547
01:53:04,677 --> 01:53:06,474
What do you mean by saying that you
have lost happiness after marriage?

1548
01:53:07,013 --> 01:53:07,809
You don't like me....

1549
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:09,478
lt means you like
some one else!

1550
01:53:11,184 --> 01:53:11,980
Why are you killing me?

1551
01:53:13,186 --> 01:53:14,153
Whatever l do,ls
it wrong?

1552
01:53:14,854 --> 01:53:15,980
Then do you say that you
haven't done anything wrong?

1553
01:53:17,357 --> 01:53:18,654
l am like that only...
l had seen in the street corner!

1554
01:53:18,858 --> 01:53:19,654
Then,why did you marry me?

1555
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:23,655
You should have married
the girl you like?

1556
01:53:23,863 --> 01:53:24,329
lt was a mistake!!...

1557
01:53:25,532 --> 01:53:26,829
l and you shouldn't
have married!

1558
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,325
We should have remained
as friends!

1559
01:53:31,371 --> 01:53:32,497
l am able to understand very well
what you're saying!

1560
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:36,008
Look!...Crying...

1561
01:53:37,043 --> 01:53:38,510
What cruelty have l done to you
for crying like this?

1562
01:53:38,711 --> 01:53:39,507
l have done the cruelty!

1563
01:53:40,547 --> 01:53:42,515
Leaving my parents behind
l came believing you!

1564
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:43,849
That was the biggest mistake
l had committed!

1565
01:53:45,385 --> 01:53:47,353
Why this love marriages?
ls it necessary?

1566
01:53:47,554 --> 01:53:48,179
lf you don't want then get away!

1567
01:53:50,557 --> 01:53:51,182
Leave me also!

1568
01:53:52,058 --> 01:53:52,854
Even l'll live in peace!

1569
01:54:11,077 --> 01:54:12,374
l am unable to understand
these women!

1570
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:15,377
This love...this marriage!

1571
01:54:15,582 --> 01:54:18,210
Marriage means...We have to sacrifice
little things for each other!

1572
01:54:19,586 --> 01:54:21,554
We have to keep her before
our self interest!

1573
01:54:23,256 --> 01:54:24,723
Throw away this Ego!

1574
01:54:25,725 --> 01:54:26,885
What was the reason that made
you to love Shakthi?

1575
01:54:28,094 --> 01:54:30,392
Meeting her in Beach
hugging in Parks!

1576
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:34,058
What you see in Cinema
is not at all love!

1577
01:54:34,767 --> 01:54:35,734
Boy! That is not love!

1578
01:54:37,437 --> 01:54:39,905
lts just an infatuation
before marriage!

1579
01:54:41,441 --> 01:54:43,409
Flower...just like a flower!

1580
01:54:43,776 --> 01:54:45,744
lt'll be intoxicated,fragrant
and beautiful!

1581
01:54:47,113 --> 01:54:47,738
...But it'll wither away!

1582
01:54:50,283 --> 01:54:51,580
What you get after marriage...

1583
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:53,745
...ls like Roots!

1584
01:54:54,621 --> 01:54:56,088
lt'll be inside the soil
rooted firmly!

1585
01:55:01,628 --> 01:55:04,096
Whatever may happen you must
make small sacrifices!

1586
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:05,597
Sacrifice!

1587
01:55:09,135 --> 01:55:09,931
Want a small?!

1588
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,947
Oh! God! How much l have
to search for you?

1589
01:55:22,815 --> 01:55:23,941
Are you trying to hide
from me?

1590
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:27,286
l want to tell you
one thing!

1591
01:55:27,487 --> 01:55:28,613
But l am unable to understand
how to tell you about it?

1592
01:55:29,155 --> 01:55:30,281
At this age,l am
feeling shy...

1593
01:55:36,496 --> 01:55:37,622
Hey! Why didn't you tell me
about this earlier itself?

1594
01:55:37,997 --> 01:55:38,964
Did l hide anything from you?

1595
01:55:39,666 --> 01:55:41,634
No! Lest it doesn't end up like
previous one!

1596
01:55:41,834 --> 01:55:42,801
l was just waiting to finalize
everything...

1597
01:55:43,002 --> 01:55:43,297
l'll thrash you!

1598
01:55:43,503 --> 01:55:45,471
That's why l took a promise
from Karthik

1599
01:55:45,838 --> 01:55:46,634
That he should not reveal it you!

1600
01:55:48,174 --> 01:55:50,301
He's the reason behind this
our second innings!

1601
01:55:54,847 --> 01:55:57,645
He pursued,hit and crashed against
and brought us together!

1602
01:55:59,519 --> 01:56:00,986
l...Yuck!

1603
01:56:02,021 --> 01:56:03,318
Shakthi,don't cry

1604
01:56:04,857 --> 01:56:05,824
lf you cry,l will also feel!

1605
01:56:07,193 --> 01:56:08,160
My elder sister is very precious!

1606
01:56:08,861 --> 01:56:09,657
Will you look after her without
tears in her eyes?

1607
01:56:12,699 --> 01:56:14,326
Don't fight with him!
Be nice!

1608
01:56:16,369 --> 01:56:17,165
l want to meet
Karthik immediately!

1609
01:56:18,705 --> 01:56:19,000
l'll go!

1610
01:56:24,377 --> 01:56:26,345
Shakthi,tonight l am invited for
a dinner in his house!

1611
01:56:27,046 --> 01:56:28,013
Mother-in-law's house dinner!

1612
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:15,561
we have got the 2 Million dollar
contract!! Rs.9 crores!!

1613
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:19,958
What,are you waiting for Shakthi?

1614
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:22,127
lt would have been better if you
would have married me!

1615
01:58:22,328 --> 01:58:23,955
l'll inform Shakthi after that
let's us arrange

1616
01:58:24,163 --> 01:58:25,460
Hey! will you come good in life?

1617
01:58:42,348 --> 01:58:43,474
Did she tell you about
her going some where?

1618
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:11,506
Did you drive it yourself?

1619
01:59:16,048 --> 01:59:18,016
Why did you take it,you know
that you don't have a licence?

1620
01:59:24,223 --> 01:59:24,848
Did you get hurt?

1621
01:59:28,895 --> 01:59:29,520
You didn't get hurt,isn't it?

1622
01:59:32,899 --> 01:59:33,866
Did anyone else get hurt?

1623
01:59:38,404 --> 01:59:38,870
A girl!

1624
01:59:39,572 --> 01:59:40,038
Severely hurt?!

1625
01:59:41,574 --> 01:59:42,199
She is alive isn't it?

1626
01:59:43,075 --> 01:59:44,201
Have they taken her to
any hospital?

1627
01:59:45,745 --> 01:59:46,211
l don't know

1628
01:59:46,579 --> 01:59:47,375
What did you do?

1629
01:59:48,581 --> 01:59:49,206
l got scared!!

1630
01:59:54,921 --> 01:59:55,717
Do you know where she is?

1631
01:59:58,758 --> 01:59:59,725
Where did the accident
took place?

1632
02:00:06,599 --> 02:00:09,727
Okay! You take compose
and sleep!

Accident's?

1635
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,577
Has any accident case been
admitted today?

1636
02:00:25,284 --> 02:00:26,751
Who are you?..Relative?

1637
02:00:27,954 --> 02:00:28,750
A lady has been admitted

1638
02:00:29,622 --> 02:00:30,919
Please call Dr.Srinivasan immediately

1639

They have kept ORP in standby!
Surgeons are waiting!

1643
02:00:58,985 --> 02:01:01,453
They are hesitating to open the skull
without near one's signatures!

1644
02:01:01,654 --> 02:01:02,279
What's her name?

How is she related to you?

1646

She hasn't turned up yet,we're searching

1667
02:01:48,334 --> 02:01:49,130

1669

Today,there was an
accident here also!

02:01:55,207 --> 02:01:55,730
Which Hospital?

1672
02:01:56,375 --> 02:01:57,103
What was that Hospital?

1673
02:02:01,714 --> 02:02:02,578

ln that tension,l couldn't

1677
02:02:10,923 --> 02:02:11,855
So,l had telephoned you!

1679

Where was the accident...

1680
02:02:16,562 --> 02:02:18,553
No,Arumugam,l didn't tell you
to close this matter!

1681
02:02:18,864 --> 02:02:20,161
Whatever has happened...

l am ready to face for
whatever has happened?

1683
02:02:38,384 --> 02:02:40,352
Has any girl been admitted
after an accident?

1684
02:02:40,753 --> 02:02:41,151
What's the name?

1687

l don't know anything
about her?

1688
02:02:50,596 --> 02:02:51,722
No! There's no one by
that name!

1689
02:02:53,099 --> 02:02:54,794
No! The people who had admitted
may not know her name?

1690
02:02:55,434 --> 02:02:56,731
Has any other young lady
been admitted here?

1691
02:02:59,038 --> 02:03:00,232
She's there in the
Trauma Centre!!

02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:03,675
The man who's calling
his wife!!

1693
02:03:08,514 --> 02:03:09,708
No other young lady has
been admitted?

1694
02:03:09,915 --> 02:03:10,882
No sir! No one else!

1695
02:03:21,727 --> 02:03:23,354
You can check police stations!
isn't it?

1696
02:03:23,562 --> 02:03:24,927
There may be reports of complaints
of missing people!

1697
02:03:25,564 --> 02:03:26,826
Karthik,we'll go!

1698
02:03:31,437 --> 02:03:32,927
l am calling from

1703

We have to operate to
remove the Clot!

1705
02:03:57,029 --> 02:03:58,018
Chances of her Survival....

1706
02:04:00,499 --> 02:04:00,897

02:20:02,293 --> 02:20:05,922
you'll sleep soundlessly

1862
02:20:07,098 --> 02:20:14,095
You should stay near me and massage
with olive oil and do service to me!

1863
02:20:16,474 --> 02:20:23,277
When you cry,if it makes me also cry
l need your fingers to wipe my tears!
