14
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:40,203
...and making us realize
that life is beautiful!

15
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,434

17
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,135
Your views may differ
from theirs...

18
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,301
...l don't expect you to blindly
obey their wishes...

19
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:04,470
...but do listen to them &
gain from their experience.

20
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,168
Never forget...they love you!

21
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:09,300
Yes Mother!

22
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:14,036
For the farewell function today...
we've invited your parents too!

23
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:18,337
We plan to discuss a current,
hot topic with our parents today...

24
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,300
MARRIAGE !!

25
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,806
North, South, East or West...
Sophiya is the best!!

26
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,069
Respected Mother Fernandes,
teachers & dear parents...

27
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:50,171
...on behalf of Sophiya College,
we extend a warm welcome to all!

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,667
She's our daughter!

29
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,368
Today's topic is marriage!

30
00:03:57,433 --> 00:04:01,570
Girls of our age are passing
through this phase now.

31
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,036
ARer marriage,
life is a pam for guys...

32
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,803
...they continue living with
their parents in their own space...

33
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,067
...and we girls...

34
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:18,003
We girls sacrifice our
career, family, likes, dislikes...

35
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:21,803
...toothbrush, toothpaste...
- manicure kits, body lotions...

36
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,502
...and other comforts
for an absolute stranger!

37
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,769
Even today, boys have an upper
hand in matters of marriage...

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,502
...and we're presented as
adorned dolls before them!

39
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:32,567
We're deemed fortunate...
ifthey accept us as their wives...

40
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:33,800
How funny...!

41
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,667
All dads are adorable!

42
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:43,336
l guess our moms present here
may not like to hear this!

43
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,135
But we too must've evey right
to choose our life partner...

44
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,134
...and these boys...
better feel obliged!

45
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,301
Ladies & Gentlemen...

46
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:10,802
A son is a son
till he gets himselfa wife...

47
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:15,270
But...a daughter is a daughter
all her life!!

48
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,502
l'm my dad's li'l angel!

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,805
Here l come...
right from the blue sky...

50
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:48,071
...bringing stars
as giRs from God.

51
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:53,469
The one...
who has been made for me...

52
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,668
You better listen...
wherever you may be hidden...

53
00:05:56,733 --> 00:06:00,703
lt ain't easy to get me...

00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:04,169
My heart ain't easy to please...

55
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,469

l'm my dad's li'l angel!

57
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:50,502
With my mom wishing
all the time...

58
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:53,702
...to hear her daughter's
wedding bells chime...

59
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,137
She works on a plan...
shows me a photo of a man...

60
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,736
Did l like him...
she wants to know...

61
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,236
And all that my head nods...
is a definite NO!

62
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,369
For the boy,
who wishes to mary me...

63
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,003
l won't be a shy bride-to-be...

64
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,802

have him impressed...

65
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,769

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,303

even if he had cheered!

67
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:39,802

68
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,703

94
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,368
Rarely do we come across
good grooms...

95
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:38,803
...and to top it all, these girls
will cross-examine them...

123
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:44,807
A boy who'll consider Ur parents

lf Sanjana becomes a part
ofthis family...it'll be perFect!

158
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:48,668
But they're so rich...

159
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:52,002
But what's the harm in
approaching them with our proposal?

00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:41,437
To serve tea or coffee, l'll send
Sanjana to meet him evey now & then!

174
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,536
Wait & watch...

175
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,467
Looks like we've got Roopa's

176
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,568
Prem Kumar is reaching Mumbai

177
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:59,235
...and he'll arrive at Sundernagar

178
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:02,636
That means, aRer four days...
Good! It's an auspicious day too!

179

He's a quiet & reserved person...

180
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:11,670
Tell mom, not to go overboard
with her volley of questions!

181
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:16,169
Do l ask too many questions or
you? Read ahead!

182
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,605
He is a gem of a person...
Sanjana will be fortunate!

183
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,134
What else did Roopa say?

184
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,103
The boy is from a good family
& heads a big business abroad.

185
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,468
You girls ask too many questions!

186
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:37,504
l'll arrange the flowers in this
cystal vase, for our bridegroom!

187
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,068
What! What did you just say?

188
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,569
For the would-be son-in-law...
the one who's arriving...

189
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,735
...l mean your would-be husband!

190
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:48,467
Paro...come here...

191
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,505
Should your newly-wedded bride
be sent back to the village?

192
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,467
No...no...pardon me...!

193
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,202
Then, you won't arrange the flowers
for him in this cystal vase.

194
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,504
ls it necessay to serve Mr.Stranger
evemhing on a silver platter!

195
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,467
Why can't we present ourselves
the way we are!

196
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:11,602
No! He'll be served evemhing
on a silver platter...

197
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,502
...and the flowers will be

198
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,369
...and you'll not utter a word
in front of him. Understood!

199
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,368
You mean, l shouldn't
even talk to him?

200
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:23,135
Yes! If he asks you anything,
you'll just smile!

201
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:28,168
How...?

204
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,468
Why did you bring
this parrot inside?

205
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,701
Pardon me ma'am...
- Throw him out...

206
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,336
Why is eveybody so quiet?

...aRer all this farmhouse is being
decorated for Prince Charming!

208
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,268
Oops! Bull's-eye!!

209
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,702
By the way, how will you smile...
Like this?

210
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:08,767
Wait...l'll fix you!

211
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:15,367
Cut the comedy guys!
Sanjana has a major problem!

212
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:17,735
Yes! Mr.Stranger is coming to
check her out.

213
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,436
We know nothing of his character...
whether he dopes or drinks?!

214
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,503
He'll say ''Yes''...

215
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,267
My foot!!

216
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:30,435
Hell! Why can't our parents
ever understand us?

217
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,400
Such a royal pain!!

218
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:37,403
These super rich boys
are said to be vey snooty!

219
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:40,101

00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:41,634
They're for our Hindi
professor Mrs.Kapoor...

601
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:43,735

Why do you combine
such issues with sex!

619
00:56:57,533 --> 00:57:00,235
Love is a vey beautiful
& sacred thing...

620
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,568
...love should
always be expressed...

00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:04,067
...or else
it's a national wastage!

622
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:04,733

00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:11,267
l think we should always
talk about it...openly!!

626
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:14,468
Love is the starting point
of all life!

634
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,567
Holy cow!!

635
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,133
Somebody's forgetting
something again!

636
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:54,933

643
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,436
''Six ofthose yellow flowers...

644
00:58:33,966 --> 00:58:35,967
Ma'am...these too...!

645
00:58:37,066 --> 00:58:38,967
On whose behalf
are these flowers?

646
00:58:41,933 --> 00:58:44,235
lt's from someone who's
dropped Sanjana to college!

647
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:47,568
Red shirt!
- The brown blazer guy!

648
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:49,567
Love divided by sex!

649
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,236

What happened...confusion!

652
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,434
We're poles apart in our
tastes!

653
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:19,336
Do you know what he relishes...
''methi parathas''!!

His hobbies are

...underwater diving, horse
riding!

656
00:59:26,533 --> 00:59:27,667
l've never even tried
horse riding!

657
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:30,666
Then ty it now...!

658
00:59:33,933 --> 00:59:35,567
Though your likes & dislikes
may differ...

659
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:39,336
...the most important thing is
how much he loves you!

660
00:59:41,733 --> 00:59:43,067
And he loves you a lot...

661
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:46,301
...or else he wouldn't have been
waiting for you till now!

662
00:59:48,966 --> 00:59:49,232
Look...

663
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:53,669
That red shirt, brown blazer guy...
isn't he the one...

664
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,935
...love divided by sex!

665
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:27,103
What's good...what's bad...

...a treasure full of happiness
awaits you!

669
01:00:57,099 --> 01:00:59,168
May l ask you another
guy kinda question!

670
01:01:03,066 --> 01:01:06,269
lf l say...that a guy
couldn't go for work today...

671
01:01:08,533 --> 01:01:09,600
...that he kept waiting
for his girl...

672
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,234
...to ask her several questions...

673
01:01:15,266 --> 01:01:16,400
...to get to know her better...

674
01:01:18,933 --> 01:01:21,735
...when she forgets something...
to always be there for her...

675
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,067
and...to take her into
his life...

676
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:30,500
...will she come with him...?

677
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,070

678
01:02:26,966 --> 01:02:31,203

679

Besides his weak eyesight,

Hey! We've an e-mail from Roopa!

759
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,601
Hello Sister!

760
01:11:54,566 --> 01:11:57,835
Let me read it
my dear...!

761
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:08,801
Roopa must be eager to
know...

762
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,534
...whether Sanjana & Prem
have liked each other!

763
01:12:11,066 --> 01:12:14,803
Listen, take the phone number
of Prem's mother from Roopa...

764
01:12:15,533 --> 01:12:17,568
...we'll have to talk
to her too!

765
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,768
We'll fix an early
wedding date...

766
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:24,836
...your Let's think about it
attitude won't do!

767
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:27,967
What's Roopa written?

768
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:39,075
Prem Kumar had to detour suddenly
to Japan for some urgent work...

769
01:12:39,766 --> 01:12:42,301
...that's why he didn't
make it to Sundernagar.

770
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,769
Now, he's reaching the day aRer.

771
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,100
What kind of a joke is this?!

772
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:59,302
Prem Kumar had to detour to
Japan for some urgent work...

773
01:12:59,533 --> 01:13:02,535
...that's why he didn't
make it to Sundernagar...

774
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:05,034
...now he's reaching
the day aRer!

775
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:08,300
lf Prem Kumar's still to come...

776
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:14,903
...then, who's this?

777
01:13:40,533 --> 01:13:43,936
Believe me...
there's no reason to wory!

778
01:13:45,033 --> 01:13:47,602
Roopa must have
misunderstood...

779
01:13:47,933 --> 01:13:51,269
...l'll call her up right away
& clarify evemhing!

780
01:13:51,566 --> 01:13:52,233
Yes...call her up just now!

781
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,937
Bless you dear...
we got your e-mail...

782
01:14:05,466 --> 01:14:09,770
Dad! We were on a vacation to
the West Coast for the past few days.

783
01:14:10,066 --> 01:14:13,769
We never got to know ofthe
change in Prem Kumar's plan.

784
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:16,802
Only when we got back, did we come
to know about his trip to Japan.

785
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,670
He regretted that he
couldn't inform you earlier.

786
01:14:20,733 --> 01:14:22,734
Now he's surely reaching
day aRer tomorrow.

787
01:14:28,633 --> 01:14:29,667
What's the matter dad?

788
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:34,636
Well, the matter is...
- The matter is...

789
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:37,602
...that there's an impostor here
who's been posing as Prem!

790
01:14:38,566 --> 01:14:39,566
What are you saying!

791
01:14:39,699 --> 01:14:42,736
Yes! He's been staying with us
since mo weeks!

792
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,535
He's even attending
Prem's office!

793
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,601
ln short, he's taken Prem's place
in evey way...and...

794
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:49,568
...he & Sanjana have been spending
most oftheir time together!

795
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:51,166
Behave sensibly!

796
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:56,568
Tell mom not to wory!

797
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:58,801
l'll find out right away, who's
come in the place of Prem Kumar!

798
01:15:00,533 --> 01:15:01,867
We're waiting for your
phone call!

799
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,668
Yes, ma'am!
- Open the store room!

800
01:15:06,933 --> 01:15:08,734
Mr.Prem's room...?
- Yes!

801
01:15:12,733 --> 01:15:14,534
Ma'am...
- You may go!

802
01:15:40,066 --> 01:15:43,235
What are you doing?
- Searching through his belongings!

803
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:51,668
Tell me what's his name!

804
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,701
Prem Kishen!

805
01:16:07,566 --> 01:16:09,534
That means in place
of Prem Kumar...

806
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:11,734
...a Prem Kishen has come here?!

807
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:18,234
lt's all your fault!

808
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:21,468
Without enquiring his full name...
you've broughtjust anybody home!

809
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,603
Good Lord! Who's he...
what does he do...

810
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:29,535
...where has he come from...
we've absolutely no clue!

811
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:32,668
And our daughter is out...
with this stranger...

812
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:36,103
...till mo in the night!!

813
01:16:56,933 --> 01:17:03,506
O stranger...!

814
01:17:04,266 --> 01:17:10,939
O stranger...!

01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:24,905
O stranger...!

816
01:17:32,966 --> 01:17:39,505
Where have you come from...

817
01:17:39,866 --> 01:17:45,838
...with so much love...
such abundance of love!

818
01:17:47,533 --> 01:17:53,538
Where have you come from...

819
01:17:53,800 --> 01:18:00,173
...with so much love...
such abundance of love!

820
01:18:00,766 --> 01:18:07,506
How beautiful...
this stary night seems with you!

821
01:18:08,033 --> 01:18:15,106
O stranger...!
My stranger...!

822
01:19:29,233 --> 01:19:35,272
Once in a lifetime...
comes the season of love!

823
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:42,473
Once in a lifetime...
you lose your heart to someone!

824
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:46,270
ln the first flush of love...

825
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:53,206
...the heart makes a place
for someone...

826
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,102
...once and for all!

827
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,469
What's happening to me...

828
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:04,734
l'm on cloud nine!

829
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:12,706
O stranger...!
My stranger...!

830
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:42,471
This stranger has come
to steal your heart away!

831
01:20:44,866 --> 01:20:49,670
This stranger has come
to take your peace away!

832
01:20:51,733 --> 01:20:57,638
But, even this thief
will not find any peace...

833
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:04,204
...he'll be bereR of evemhing
before he leaves!

834
01:21:09,133 --> 01:21:11,935
But where can he go...

835
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,803
...when he lives for you...

836
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:19,035
...he shall die for you...

837
01:21:19,699 --> 01:21:25,238
...this stranger ofyours!

838
01:21:30,733 --> 01:21:37,106
Where have you come from...

839
01:21:37,866 --> 01:21:43,271
...with so much love...
such abundance of love!

840
01:22:23,133 --> 01:22:26,469
Yes Roopa, tell me!

841
01:22:27,133 --> 01:22:28,601
l found out evemhing...

842
01:22:28,733 --> 01:22:31,735
...a boy named Prem Kishen
has come there...

843
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:36,070
...he's a business development
manager in Prem Kumar's company...

844
01:22:36,466 --> 01:22:38,935
...and has studied with Prem Kumar
in the same college.

845
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,670
Prem Kumar has made the careers
of many of his college friends...

846
01:22:42,733 --> 01:22:45,135
...by providing them jobs
in his company!

847
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:45,934
He's a great man!

848
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:49,969
As he couldn't make it himself,
he decided to send Prem Kishen.

849
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:52,667
An_ay, l've met this boy...

850
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:55,869
...he's come over to our place
many a time. He's a decent boy.

851
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:58,134
But he's the wrong boy!
Isn't he!

852
01:22:58,666 --> 01:23:04,805
And your dad has been
singing his praises to Sanjana!

853
01:23:04,966 --> 01:23:07,668
He's been encouraging them
to meet as & when they please...

854
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,235
...and Sanjana's lost
her heart to him...!

855
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:12,968
No mom...we have to
make Sanjana understand...

856
01:23:13,033 --> 01:23:15,034
...that things have
already moved ahead!

857
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:19,537
ln fact, l've already spoken about
Sanjana to Prem Kumar's mother!

858
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,802
She has really liked
Sanjana's snaps!

859
01:23:21,866 --> 01:23:25,202
That's why she's coming along
with her son to meet Sanjana!

860
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:29,003
What...? She's coming too...?!

861
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:33,671
Yes! Looks like Prem Kumar too
has liked Sanjana's snaps!

862
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:38,703
Please ask Sanjana to forget
whatever has taken place.

863
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:40,667
Rarely do we come across
such proposals!

864
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:44,136
Don't wory...l'll make Sanjana
understand evemhing!

865
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:48,003
Thank God, we've come to know
the truth at the right time!

866
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:50,535
We'll surely receive them
at the airport.

867
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:53,134
This time...l'll go myself!

868
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:00,069
Listen...what do you
intend telling Sanjana?

869
01:24:02,466 --> 01:24:02,766
Nothing...!

870
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:06,603
You intend to hide the truth
from your daughter?

871
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:10,236
Look...
girls these days are a crazy lot!

872
01:24:10,899 --> 01:24:12,067
lf Sanjana is told the truth...

873
01:24:12,133 --> 01:24:14,802
...she will flatly refuse
to even meet Prem Kumar!

874
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:17,201
Let her meet Prem
Kumar unawares!

875
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:21,269
And just see...how she forgets
this impostor in a few days!

876
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,569
Prem Kishen too...
is a vey nice boy...!

877
01:24:27,666 --> 01:24:30,201
Good Lord!
Have you lost your senses!

878
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,536
How can you compare
the status ofthe owner...

879
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,502
...to that of an ordinay
worker in his company!

880
01:24:36,566 --> 01:24:38,668
Money isn't evemhing
in this world...

881
01:24:38,933 --> 01:24:40,267
For God's sake, just keep quiet!

882
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,903
Now, this Prem Kishen should be
thrown out as soon as possible...

883
01:24:43,966 --> 01:24:46,635
...l don't want him here
even for a moment!

884
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:56,138
Papa, you're still awake!
- There's no electricity...

885
01:24:56,533 --> 01:24:59,602
Come on uncle...
l'll take you out for a drive!

886
01:25:00,566 --> 01:25:05,704
No thank you. How was the pam?
- It was great dad! l'm so happy!

887
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:09,202
Get inside...change your clothes!
- Yes mom.

888
01:25:15,933 --> 01:25:19,002
We've got an e-mail
from Roopa that...

889
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,201

01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,801
You'll be vey happy
to meet them!

894
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,767

our farmhouse...

895
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:44,938
...and you've got to take
good care ofthem! No excuses!

896
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:51,137
Where's Sanjana...!

897
01:25:53,466 --> 01:25:55,968

And do remember...to
miss me too!!

933
01:29:08,633 --> 01:29:10,634
Your town is a lovely place!

01:29:10,699 --> 01:29:12,668
lt's become lovely...

935
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,034

936
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:16,633
God bless you!

937
01:29:20,033 --> 01:29:23,503
l find you exactly
as Roopa described you!

938
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:26,901
That's my son...Prem!!

939
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:53,567
Yes, ma'am!

940
01:29:54,699 --> 01:29:56,501
Mr.Johnny Singh,
why're you still in the car?

941
01:29:57,666 --> 01:29:59,100
Please save me from
this commando!

942
01:30:00,566 --> 01:30:03,635
Stop it, Johnny!
Quiet...!

943
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,800
Please step out...
- Yes!

944
01:30:06,933 --> 01:30:08,267
No! l'm okay here!

945
01:30:09,633 --> 01:30:11,134
Why's he barking so
much today?

946
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:12,734
Exactly! l just wished him
Good evening...

947
01:30:13,566 --> 01:30:15,801
No...l said something more...
l said l'm Prem Kumar's P.A....

948
01:30:15,866 --> 01:30:19,169
...l've come from America &
my name is Johnny...he lost it!

949
01:30:20,133 --> 01:30:21,634
Dear Mr.Johnny...
his name is Johnny too!

950
01:30:22,699 --> 01:30:25,102
He thought that you're
making fun of him! Please come!

951
01:30:27,133 --> 01:30:32,104
Oh! He's Johnny too?
Johnny, please don't bark at Johnny!

952
01:30:39,699 --> 01:30:40,734
Please have this aunty...

953
01:30:41,966 --> 01:30:44,601
So you wish to study
Child Psychology?

954
01:30:44,666 --> 01:30:44,866
Yes!

955
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,667
Oh no! She'll just get
married now!

956
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:51,501
This is rather unfair
on your part...

957
01:30:51,566 --> 01:30:53,067
...evey girl has to mary someday...

958
01:30:53,133 --> 01:30:55,502
...but it doesn't mean
that her wishes remain unfulfilled!

959
01:30:57,133 --> 01:30:59,101
OK. Study as much as you wish to!

960
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:00,500
Have some ofthese
deep-fried snacks.

961
01:31:00,566 --> 01:31:03,068
No please!
l'm already putting on weight!

962
01:31:04,233 --> 01:31:06,034
No way! You're so slim & trim!

963
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:09,201
Go...call Prem Kumar for high tea!

964
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:27,900
Boss...high tea is served!

965
01:31:30,866 --> 01:31:32,133

Foolish Johnny! Idiot Johnny!

968
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,467
Doggy Johnny...!

01:31:50,233 --> 01:31:53,169
Good Johnny! Happy Johnny!
Clever Johnny!

970
01:31:53,233 --> 01:31:56,502
Sweet Johnny...
To hell with Johnny...!!

01:32:04,933 --> 01:32:05,199
Sory!

972
01:32:11,133 --> 01:32:13,268
There was a sudden change
in my travel plans to come here...

973
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:17,070
l'm sory, l couldn't inform you.
- That's okay!

974
01:32:18,066 --> 01:32:23,671
l've brought you some ofthe latest
books on publishing business...

975
01:32:23,733 --> 01:32:26,702
...perhaps they could be of some
use to you...just a second!

976
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,801
Hey Johnny! Buddy...
room partner!

977
01:32:48,033 --> 01:32:49,634

978

l'm OK! You're fine...

979
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:00,866
Welcome to India boss!

980
01:33:01,233 --> 01:33:01,266
Thank you...

981
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,168
l saw the site while coming
from the airport...it's perFect!

982
01:33:09,699 --> 01:33:10,500
You can go ahead!

983
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,200
Thank you sir!

984
01:33:11,266 --> 01:33:13,067
Just see how swiRly
this project gets completed!

985
01:33:14,899 --> 01:33:18,203
lt feels good to
hear your voice today!

986
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,635
Hmm...talk to mom!

987
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:26,567
Ma'am...Good evening!

988
01:33:27,633 --> 01:33:30,002
This isn't right!
We're here...& you're missing!

989
01:33:30,066 --> 01:33:31,967
Can't help it!
Boss gives us so much work...

990
01:33:32,033 --> 01:33:35,069
...just get him married...
then he'll get busy at home!

991
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,070
This time l'll make sure...
that he agrees!

992
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:51,671
Good Lord! Why should you
bother about cooking!

993
01:33:52,966 --> 01:33:56,102
As long as you're here,
you shall dine at our place!

994
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,034
Sory to interrupt you...

995
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,801
...whenever my boss is
with his mom...

996
01:34:00,866 --> 01:34:03,101
...he relishes the food
cooked by her!

997
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:06,669
An_ay, he's an introvert...
doesn't pam at all!

998
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:09,468
Doesn't he hang around with friends,
or go to a restaurant?

999
01:34:10,566 --> 01:34:13,001
He doesn't have a friend
to hang around with!

1000
01:34:13,066 --> 01:34:15,735
No friends...no enemies!

1001
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:19,535
No indulgence...no desires!!

1002
01:34:27,133 --> 01:34:29,502
Prem Kumar seems to have
a vey gentle heart...

1003
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,536
...l hope he comes for
Sanjana's cultural programme today!

1004
01:34:34,199 --> 01:34:36,135
He'll surely come...
l'll invite him personally!

1005
01:34:44,433 --> 01:34:45,133
Come in.

1006
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,101
We've not been formally
introduced till now...

1007
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:55,166

1011
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:08,768
We ex-students have worked
our heart out for this show.

1012
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:11,869

1016
01:35:40,966 --> 01:35:41,633

What's the matter?
Why've you come out?

1047
01:39:34,733 --> 01:39:37,769
We haven't done the right thing by
concealing the truth from Sanjana!

1048
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:39,034
What do you mean?

1049
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,837
Can't you see how deeply Sanjana
is in love with Prem Kishen!

1050
01:40:04,899 --> 01:40:11,873

Your perFormance was

01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,435
That boss began tapping
his fingers unknowingly...!

1072
01:43:09,933 --> 01:43:11,067
Share some more time with us...

1073

How many injections will l need?

1084
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:17,167
You'll have to do me a favour too!
- Yes aunty!

1085
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:20,500
Please give me your mobile...

1086
01:44:23,899 --> 01:44:25,167
This mobile will remain
with Sanjana today.

1087
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:28,001
He's here on a vacation with me...

1088
01:44:29,966 --> 01:44:30,866
...teach him to smile...

1089
01:44:32,166 --> 01:44:35,435
...specially when, he has
a beautiful girl by his side!

1090
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:41,135
Mr.Fast...go slow!!

1091
01:44:46,166 --> 01:44:48,601
Looks like you want to finish
the sightseeing in 15 mins.!

1092
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,133
Sory!

1093
01:44:52,933 --> 01:44:54,901
Boys would love
to walk along with girls...

1094
01:44:54,966 --> 01:44:56,500
...and there's you,
who'd rather run ahead!

1095
01:44:58,699 --> 01:45:00,034
Why do you shy away from girls?

1096
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:04,469
Know what's the problem with you?
You're just too good a person!

1097
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,568
This is the most beautiful place
in Sundernagar!

1098
01:45:10,033 --> 01:45:11,667
Have you ever enjoyed
such cool breeze?

1099
01:45:12,199 --> 01:45:12,900
No...

1100
01:45:13,233 --> 01:45:15,635

How many times l've told you to
give the flowers to the right person!

1106
01:56:31,533 --> 01:56:34,636
The owner of Prem Group of Companies
is not that man...

1107
01:56:34,699 --> 01:56:36,968
...whom we'd invited for
the Valentine party!

1108
01:56:37,033 --> 01:56:40,536
He's iust an employee!
The boss is someone else!

1109
01:56:40,566 --> 01:56:45,604
From now on, no mistakes!
- Yes sir!

1110
01:56:46,233 --> 01:56:48,501

1111

You've brought the cake!
We've been waiting for you!

1112
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:57,136
Please come in!

1113
01:56:58,866 --> 01:57:00,968
Yes, l'm Prem Kumar, tell me!

1114
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:09,171
Money talks, my lord...
May you live a thousand years!

1115
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:11,402
May you lead a prosperous life!

1118
01:57:16,466 --> 01:57:18,668
But l'm not Prem Kumar...

1119
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:21,301
You're the secretay?!

1122
01:57:28,866 --> 01:57:32,002
Shut up!!
Take the flowers back 8 follow me!

1123
01:57:33,633 --> 01:57:34,967
Crash-landed?!

1124
01:57:39,566 --> 01:57:44,570
A driver without headlights...
he made that poor girl cy!

1125
01:57:45,533 --> 01:57:46,834
Have you seen such
atrocious behaviour!

1126
01:57:50,466 --> 01:57:51,600
Thank you for the cake!

1127
01:57:51,666 --> 01:57:54,668
Hello Mr.Prem Kishen!

Good evening sir!

1132
01:58:06,833 --> 01:58:10,870
Money talks, my lord!
May you live a thousand years!

1133
01:58:10,933 --> 01:58:13,001
May you lead a prosperous life!

1134
01:58:15,033 --> 01:58:16,667
Happy Birthday to you!

1135
01:58:18,066 --> 01:58:20,201

The Impostor! The Traitor!
Shameless! The Terminator!

1239

She's his would-be bride...yet
he feels shy to stand beside her!

1240
02:09:39,899 --> 02:09:43,703
l've never seen my son

1241
02:09:45,399 --> 02:09:47,068
You have my acceptance

daughter-in-law.

1243
02:09:58,899 --> 02:10:00,868

To make this a memorable photo,
why don't you...!

1250
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:29,934
Why don't you make him understand!

1251
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,435
They're going to tie the knot
yet he's behaving so formally!

1252
02:10:46,566 --> 02:10:50,202
My lord! All the best

Good night Mr.Prem Kishen.

Sit down secretay.
Don't waste time!

1258
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,136
How dare you party around with
the wife of your boss as your own!

1259
02:11:22,199 --> 02:11:25,570
Both of you may have the same name
but you can never take his place!

1260
02:11:27,199 --> 02:11:28,200
Money Talks!!

instead of my boss...

1264
02:11:58,466 --> 02:11:59,667
...entered this home
instead of him...

1265
02:12:02,033 --> 02:12:04,201
...and l got so much love from all
of you that l forgot evemhing...

1266
02:12:06,199 --> 02:12:09,169
...what l am...who l am!

1267
02:12:11,733 --> 02:12:13,801
Boss has done so much...
for boys like Johnny & me...

1268
02:12:16,633 --> 02:12:18,568
...that l cannot even dream
of taking his place!

1269
02:12:20,199 --> 02:12:22,769
Please tell aunty, that no one
will trouble her hereafter...

1270
02:12:24,833 --> 02:12:26,935
l'll never be a barrier
to the happiness of this house.

1271
02:12:37,166 --> 02:12:37,966
Sir...!

1272
02:12:44,666 --> 02:12:47,568
Please...don't go, my dear...

1273
02:12:51,166 --> 02:12:52,834
Sanjana is yours...!

1274
02:12:52,899 --> 02:12:56,870
No uncle...my conscience
doesn't allow me.

1275
02:13:00,533 --> 02:13:01,934
Uncle, you're vey lovable...

1276
02:13:04,533 --> 02:13:08,870
...ask him...who never got
any love in his childhood!

1277
02:13:21,433 --> 02:13:23,034
This stranger asks you...to...

1278
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:40,635
May l take the car for sometime?
- Yes my dear.

1279
02:13:45,166 --> 02:13:48,102
This engagement will not
take place without your consent...

1280
02:13:49,833 --> 02:13:50,833
...this is your father's word!

1281
02:13:53,066 --> 02:13:53,633
Thank you dad!

1282
02:14:14,833 --> 02:14:17,402
My decision remains the same.

1283
02:14:19,833 --> 02:14:21,100
l'm here by default...

1284
02:14:22,966 --> 02:14:26,102
...you belong to boss.
He has a right over you.

1285
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,134
lt doesn't matter...
who has a right over whom!

1286
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,435
l've known him
only as your friend...

1287
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:35,935
...that's all l know
about my relationship with him.

1288
02:14:38,466 --> 02:14:42,069
l've always seen you in him...
l've heard your name...in his name.

1289
02:14:42,833 --> 02:14:44,034
Why did you love me so much...

1290
02:14:44,733 --> 02:14:45,800
...that my heart is no longer mine!

1291
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:50,801
l can't give you
all the happiness that...

1292
02:14:51,666 --> 02:14:53,834
l know where my happiness lies...
don't dissuade me!

1293
02:15:00,133 --> 02:15:04,904
None of us will be happy...
neither you, nor me...nor him...

1294
02:15:05,899 --> 02:15:07,668
...whom l won't be able to love...

1295
02:15:08,699 --> 02:15:10,068
...the way he'd be entitled to
after marriage.

1296
02:15:11,133 --> 02:15:12,734
This evening, the engagement date
is to be decided.

1297
02:15:13,666 --> 02:15:16,035
We should tell Prem Kumar's mother
evemhing about us right away!

1298
02:15:16,933 --> 02:15:18,000
Let's return all those gifts...

1299
02:15:19,466 --> 02:15:21,401
...that she's given me
with much hope & love.

1300

You're too good a person, but it's
not about being good or bad...

1304
02:15:34,766 --> 02:15:35,633
...we've to do what is right...

1305
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:37,834
...though it may hurt somebody
or break someone's heart!

1306
02:15:40,066 --> 02:15:41,967
You've got to come with me...

1307
02:15:44,833 --> 02:15:45,200

1314
02:16:57,166 --> 02:16:59,735
Where are you off to?
- l'm racing against time...!

1315
02:17:00,866 --> 02:17:02,200
But where are you going...!

1316
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:05,735

1318
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:11,134
This proiect in Sundernagar

1319
02:17:12,033 --> 02:17:13,768
...l won't be at peace

1320

The priest is here...!

02:18:50,166 --> 02:18:53,168
Please give us an auspicious date

1333
02:18:57,433 --> 02:18:58,867
Why isn't Gurpreet back

1334
02:18:58,933 --> 02:19:00,534
Why don't you go & check...

He's left for Delhi...

1338
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:21,833

1339
02:19:23,533 --> 02:19:26,168
Yes...he won't be coming...

1340

...your dad's asking

1342
02:20:02,033 --> 02:20:04,135
Don't ever feel

1343
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:08,602

1350
02:21:34,866 --> 02:21:41,706
The path of love...

1351
02:21:42,633 --> 02:21:49,906
Oh! Stranger...!
Dearest stranger...!

1352
02:22:04,933 --> 02:22:05,566
Call up Prem...

1353
02:22:13,700 --> 02:22:16,035
Hey! You haven't left Delhi

We're leaving for the engagement

1355

Come soon, Prem!

1356
02:22:38,433 --> 02:22:43,938
Those moments of love...

1357
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:52,506
...are just memories now...!

1358
02:23:02,799 --> 02:23:09,640
Oh! How do l fall in love...
all over again!

1359
02:23:10,833 --> 02:23:17,072
How do l commit my love

1361
02:23:26,533 --> 02:23:33,840
Oh! Stranger...!
Dearest stranger...!

1362
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:19,705
With whom do l share
this pain...

1363
02:24:22,066 --> 02:24:28,572
Come back...
and take me into your arms!

1364
02:24:38,633 --> 02:24:45,539
With evey passing moment...
we're drifting apart...

1365
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:53,172
With each moment...
l'm slipping away.

1366
02:24:54,500 --> 02:25:01,073
Please...even now...
come and take me away!

1367
02:25:02,666 --> 02:25:09,939
Oh! Stranger...!
Dearest stranger...!

1368
02:26:49,933 --> 02:26:51,034
ls this the time to come?

1369
02:26:55,666 --> 02:26:55,999
Sory!

1370
02:28:55,033 --> 02:28:56,768
There's a limit to being insolent!

1371
02:28:57,666 --> 02:28:59,634
What must Prem Kumar & his mother
be thinking?

1372
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:03,536
You're engaged to him now...
how could you forget this!

1373
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:05,468
What was this madness!

1374
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:09,169
Do you know what the guests
are gossiping inside!

1375
02:29:10,133 --> 02:29:13,503
You've maligned the name of not only
our family but also theirs...

1376
02:29:14,066 --> 02:29:16,935
That's enough! Now no one's
going to say anything to Sanjana.

1377
02:29:20,799 --> 02:29:21,167
Uncle...

1378
02:29:23,533 --> 02:29:29,405
Our family name,
guests gossiping inside...

1379
02:29:31,866 --> 02:29:33,500
...don't matter at all!

1380
02:29:36,366 --> 02:29:37,800
All that matters is...

1381
02:29:40,966 --> 02:29:43,068
...what's in Sanjana's heart!

1382
02:29:57,166 --> 02:30:01,970
Tell me...what's in your heart!

1383
02:30:11,899 --> 02:30:16,137
You're free from evey bond...

1384
02:30:24,133 --> 02:30:26,768
...my other son...is right there...

1385
02:30:31,799 --> 02:30:33,501
Do you love him...

1386
02:30:50,766 --> 02:30:52,634
Saniana & l are well-matched
for marriage...

1387
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,068
...we belong to the same community...
we've similar tastes...

1388
02:30:56,966 --> 02:30:58,167
...even our horoscopes match...

1389
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:02,168
...but love writes
it's own destiny...

1390
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:06,668
...or you wouldn't have come here
before me!

1391
02:31:08,566 --> 02:31:12,436
The one whom Saniana loves...
has a right over Sanjana!

1392
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:18,470
We men may bow down
before wealth, name & fame...

1393
02:31:19,766 --> 02:31:21,901
...but it's said, that a woman
never does so!

1394
02:31:22,866 --> 02:31:25,401
You & Roopa have always
wished well for Sanjana...

1395
02:31:26,466 --> 02:31:29,168
...as a mother...as a sister.

1396
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:32,902
Look at Saniana...once...
through the eyes of a woman...

1397
02:31:35,899 --> 02:31:38,135
...you will see
sheer honesty on her face!

1398
02:31:58,100 --> 02:32:00,902
Your daughter has chosen
a gem of a person!

1399
02:32:12,799 --> 02:32:15,502
Just one slap
was not enough for him...

1400
02:32:16,433 --> 02:32:17,700
...you hid the truth from me!

1401
02:32:18,566 --> 02:32:20,501
You rascal, you scoundrel!
Boss, l'll abuse him today...

1402
02:32:21,533 --> 02:32:22,767
Now you slap me...!
- Why...?!

1403
02:32:24,733 --> 02:32:25,733
Slap me, l say!

1404
02:32:27,666 --> 02:32:28,633
That's because...

1405
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:32,769
...despite being a buddy, l didn't
hear the voice of your heart!

1406
02:32:36,100 --> 02:32:41,071
Hey you all! Welcome to
this year's Friendship Day bash!

1407
02:32:41,799 --> 02:32:45,703
Hey! You're late!
The last leg of the game is on!

1408
02:32:46,633 --> 02:32:48,501
Evey team out here
is making a hand painting...

1409
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:51,168
...the team that finishes first...
is the winner!

1410
02:32:55,500 --> 02:33:00,004
Go Boss Go! Go Sanjana Go!

1411
02:33:04,866 --> 02:33:06,067
And we've won!!

1412
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:15,972
Our special prize goes to...
the most compatible team...

1413
02:33:16,933 --> 02:33:18,100
...Sanjana & Prem!

1414
02:33:27,433 --> 02:33:29,535
And now Prem, it's question time!

1415
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:32,969
lt's slightly personal...
but what the hell!

1416
02:33:33,966 --> 02:33:37,169
She is...his!
Hey there, my man!

1417
02:33:39,033 --> 02:33:40,934

02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:42,667
His wife!

1419
02:33:46,833 --> 02:33:50,903
Which means his beloved, sweetheart,

1420
02:33:51,133 --> 02:33:53,134
...but...she is his!

1421
02:33:54,966 --> 02:33:56,133
And yet you love her?!

1422
02:34:03,833 --> 02:34:04,733
Yes, l do...

1423
02:34:07,733 --> 02:34:10,068
Do we have to possess someone...
in order to get someone's love?!

1424
02:34:12,899 --> 02:34:13,800
l haven't lost anything...

1428
02:34:29,466 --> 02:34:31,167
...now, she has to search...
a Sanjana for me!

1429
02:34:36,166 --> 02:34:38,601
