1
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,483
The task of cleaning up the
Ganga that we have undertaken...

2
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:05,776
...is a great religious
undertaking.

3
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:12,023
But I have come here to warn you
about those political leaders...

4
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,163
...who embark on such
grandiose schemes...

5
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,146
...and misguide the innocent
public for their selfishness.

6
00:01:22,142 --> 00:01:24,864
I have but one request to make.

7
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:28,313
You must support those
who gave their...

8
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,603
...blood to protect the Ganga.

9
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,840
The fresh stream
flows toward the south.

10
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,631
But, the water in west has
changed its colour and turned salty.

11
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:04,074
The western culture has
taunted at Rama and Krishna.

12
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:08,865
Ram, your Ganges has
turned dirty.

13
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:29,026
No filth can remain
in the flowing water.

14
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:33,855
And, in such waters the sins of
the whole world get washed out.

15
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:38,877
So, who can say after
sighting such a Ganges?

16
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:44,089
Ram, your Ganges has turned dirty.

17
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:13,718
The one revered the Ganges
and bowed before it.

18
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:18,662
The one who praised the country
wherein the Ganges flows.

19
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:23,606
There must be something so as he
came back and is talking about it.

20
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,666
Ram, your Ganges has
turned dirty.

21
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:51,701
Everybody knows why
the Ganges is filthy.

22
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:55,458
But I must warn you once again.

23
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,716
Beware of leaders who
appear to be clean...

24
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:02,702
...but who possess hearts
that are evil.

25
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:06,381
Brothers, our soul is pure.

26
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,601
But we have gone wrong
in our deeds.

27
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:16,040
Had it not been so, today we
wouldn't have polluted this Ganges.

28
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:22,211
The Ganges that we all
undoubtedly revere.

29
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:27,501
That is why, if we have to
keep this river clean...

30
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:31,027
...we must first clean its' source.

31
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:33,557
Hail our leader!

32
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:38,386
And that source lies within us.

33
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:40,916
In the dirty politics of today!

34
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:47,010
We have to destroy the crime,
corruption from our country.

35
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:52,376
Or else these sinners, these
traitors will wash their sins off...

36
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:55,557
...in our chaste Ganga
and pollute it!

37
00:04:56,362 --> 00:05:00,042
Brothers, I'll become
your party president...

38
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:03,568
- I'll keep all these
promises... - He is lying!

39
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:06,136
Don't get taken in by
this rascal's words!

40
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:08,359
He is a cheat! A hypocrite!

41
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:16,677
I will kill him!

42
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,245
I will kill you!

43
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,454
He doesn't deserve to live!
Let go of me!

44
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:32,966
You can't escape!

45
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:48,259
Jeeva sir, By wielding a knife...

46
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:50,253
...I've killed the
ideals of my Gandhian Dad.

47
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:55,312
I regret that we had to use
you to defame your Dad.

48
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:59,605
But today everything is fair
in politics and business.

49
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,859
I've done as you said.
Now you keep your word.

50
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:05,201
Why not? First, let's go home.

51
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:10,337
Hello. - Here,
Brijkishore sir.

52
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:11,908
I've got your son free.

53
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:15,128
I'm grateful. Have a seat.

54
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:20,532
I'm obliged to you or else
in today's world...

55
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:27,853
Your patriotism, honesty and
sincerity couldn't bail him out.

56
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:35,251
Well, as decided now
you must bail me out.

57
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:41,652
Can one really not live
honestly in today's world?

58
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:45,101
The honest brigade got martyred.

59
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,976
And the others like
you are starving.

60
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,460
At least let your son,
live in peace.

61
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,028
And look after your old age.

62
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:57,251
Take these.

63
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,834
Don't you trust my word
that you had to bring money?

64
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,621
I admit you can buy and sell
everything in the world with cash.

65
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,301
But the price of my
ideals is not money!

66
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:20,594
I won't take this money.

67
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,646
If possible, give my son,
Chander a job.

68
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:30,521
He will get the job.

69
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:34,967
The day my mill is opened, your
son will be Chief Engineer.

70
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:38,685
I'll have his case withdrawn
in no time.

71
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:42,901
You must withdraw your name
and help Mr. Bhagwat win.

72
00:07:44,894 --> 00:07:50,107
I'm leaving this money for Chander
and his family, not for you.

73
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:55,396
Long live the Party President!

74
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:57,811
Come, sir.
- How is Daddy?

75
00:07:57,888 --> 00:08:00,801
The doctor has asked him to
rest but look at him...

76
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:03,637
He doesn't listen to me.
You must talk to him.

77
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:06,588
If the leader rests, how
will the country run?

78
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,076
Congratulations, Mr. Bhagwat.
- Welcome Mr. Jeeva.

79
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:11,686
Congratulations.

80
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:16,631
Actually this is your victory.

81
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:19,352
The victory of our unity,
the people.

82
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,268
Long live, Bhagwat Chaudhary!

83
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:24,718
Long live! - Now you must rest.

84
00:08:27,094 --> 00:08:28,972
Sir, our members want
to throw a party...

85
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:31,195
...in his honour this evening.

86
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:34,377
You must grace the occasion.
- Bring Naren too.

87
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:38,056
Though Radha doesn't say it,
but, that's what she desires.

88
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:06,305
So you won't attend the party?

89
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:11,172
I don't like them, father.

90
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:15,235
Mr. Bhagwat hasn't invited
you especially for your liking!

91
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:19,413
It's no mean task to be elected
the Party President!

92
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:23,169
- Problems are solved... - Of
business and work, mother!

93
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,856
Not of life.

94
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,299
Then stay here and solve the
problems of your life!

95
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:34,438
I don't waste time in
needless arguments!

96
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,146
- Aren't you taking Naren?
- How can I take him along?

97
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,714
His brain is elder to him.

98
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:48,811
He doesn't understand me and
his talks... nobody understands.

99
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:51,073
This is the outcome of your
teachings and love.

100
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:02,878
Yes grandma?

101
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,931
What's wrong with you? Why
don't you obey your father?

102
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:12,805
Father? Where's my father?

103
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:17,903
He can't see his son
because of his money.

104
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:23,614
And the son can't see his
father behind all that money.

105
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:26,565
For whom is he doing this?

106
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:28,788
For you... your happiness.

107
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:34,154
I want peace which I get
from these thoughts.

108
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:39,865
Grandma, millions born in
this world earn money.

109
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,430
But why can't a Vivekanand
be born?

110
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:51,441
The day people learn to live
in love and elation...

111
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:55,120
That will be the day that each
house will sport a Vivekanand!

112
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,946
But that's an awakening which
brings many questions.

113
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:03,591
And you have to
find the answers.

114
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:08,689
By going out of the walls of
the house, seeing the world.

115
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,988
By understanding yourself.

116
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:13,480
Radha must be waiting for you.

117
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:15,090
Go, my son.

118
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,547
You're so late. I was
feeling so restless!

119
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:30,690
First meet Daddy. I have
lots to talk about.

120
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:34,522
- Naren has come.
- Hello. - Welcome.

121
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:36,822
How are you? - Very fine.

122
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:38,700
My best wishes.

123
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,798
- What's this? - The book you
wrote in college 25 years ago.

124
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,704
Politics and corruption.

125
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:56,906
Is this a joke? Couldn't
you find another present?

126
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,130
He only refreshed his memory.

127
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,158
Earlier there was corruption
in politics...

128
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,917
...today it's only corruption!

129
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:07,792
Congratulations.

130
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:12,583
Just as you went to a brothel
away from the dirt of the house.

131
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:15,573
I joined politics to remove
the dirt in it.

132
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:17,566
Long live Bhagwat Chaudhary!

133
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,350
What is this Professor?

134
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:30,099
We're presenting this to you
influenced by your speech.

135
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:32,514
Unveil it.

136
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:49,264
2 years ago our college trip
brought this water from Gangotri.

137
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,943
And this one has just been
brought from Calcutta.

138
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:57,581
- See the difference?
- To study pollution...

139
00:12:57,658 --> 00:12:59,191
We wish to go to Gangotri.

140
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:03,522
Please grant us some money
from your personal fund.

141
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:08,466
Sure. Chamanlal, fulfill
their demands tomorrow.

142
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:17,090
Daddy is concerned with praise
and they want to collect money.

143
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:20,923
And I want to say that which I
haven't been able to as yet.

144
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:24,756
Yes, tell me. What
do you want to say?

145
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:31,272
I want to know who you see when
you look in the mirror.

146
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,032
Who else but myself?

147
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:40,739
That's what I want to say. I see
you when I look in the mirror.

148
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:46,757
I see our friendship not
you in that mirror.

149
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:49,977
I'll take leave.

150
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:56,991
When will you understand me?

151
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:58,907
When will you understand
my heart?

152
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,817
My... factory problem?

153
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,266
Now that's my problem not yours.

154
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,834
I can see its' solution clearly.

155
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:16,194
Watch where this water takes
your factory and it's problems.

156
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:18,915
Save Ganga! Save India!

157
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,291
Long live Bhagwat Chaudhary!

158
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:57,052
According to news we've
received, today Calcutta...

159
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,969
...a man was killed in a feud...

160
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:02,456
...among factory workers
and demonstrators.

161
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:06,634
Sahai and Co. Pvt. Ltd. Was
burnt by anti-social elements.

162
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:10,851
...which has caused damage
of millions of rupees.

163
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:19,283
Bhagwat Chaudhary has strongly
condemned this dastardly act.

164
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,234
He claims his demonstration
was meant...

165
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:23,844
...to be peaceful and purposeful.

166
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:28,788
He demanded a judicial inquiry
be set up to look into this.

167
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:36,378
This is a miracle.

168
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,869
The old mill got torched before
the new was opened.

169
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:41,399
And the insurance company
will pay for the loss.

170
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,967
You saved the millions you'd
have to pay the workers being...

171
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,270
...laid off.

172
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:49,716
And the best thing is that
you'll have buildings...

173
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:53,012
...worth millions right in
the middle of the city.

174
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,117
Our buildings not mine.

175
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:02,594
But this sudden protest for
the sullying of the Ganga...?

176
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,741
These are the rules of politics.

177
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:11,142
The motive behind every loot
and arson should be chaste.

178
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,703
I think I'll pay 10000 bucks to
the families of the martyred.

179
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,808
You are so generous.

180
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:23,254
Your business is expanding like
the sea, so give the money away.

181
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,351
Your sins will be washed away.
The Ganga will get more dirty.

182
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,261
You are great!

183
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:38,892
I want to know why you want to
go to Gangotri with those boys.

184
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,070
Grandma, I'm asking you. May
I go for the college tour?

185
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:47,363
Why don't you answer your Dad?
Why do you want to go?

186
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:50,582
I want to be free from
this suffocation.

187
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,568
Suffocation? Who is
suffocating you?

188
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,095
From my own and myself.

189
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,659
I've seen why the Ganga
here is so murky.

190
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:05,875
I want to see it's origin.

191
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,635
There must be something
there that's not here.

192
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,705
If there isn't...

193
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,813
...then what's the point in
worshiping such a river?

194
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,534
Well said!

195
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:21,705
My beloved Ganga... do
you recall the days...?

196
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:25,002
When my wagon stopped
by your shores.

197
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,761
Poor Naren is stuck amidst foes.

198
00:17:30,636 --> 00:17:33,779
Why do you want to constrict
his freedom by your bonds?

199
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:39,260
Whether a bird teaches her
young to fly or not...

200
00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:43,093
He learns on his own for his
freedom. And goes faraway.

201
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:47,577
You are both full of nonsense!

202
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:50,452
Let Naren go.

203
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,936
Mother, you're supporting them!
If something happens to him...

204
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:59,268
Nothing will harm him. It's
my order. He will definitely go.

205
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:01,529
Grandma! - Go and get ready.

206
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,163
Refusing a young son's
wish is strangling him.

207
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:12,836
You're taking so many clothes!
Will you stay there long?

208
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,895
Can't say. If someone holds
me back, I may never return.

209
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,728
I've heard the girls from the
mountains trap men in a snap.

210
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:25,561
- They practice black magic.
- You must learn white magic.

211
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:30,046
If I did, I wouldn't
let you go so far.

212
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,614
We have a strange friendship.

213
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:35,795
We never meet when we're close.

214
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:39,628
Today when you're going away,
I don't like it.

215
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,778
Whether it be planning
of war or a trip...

216
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:53,235
...leave no stone unturned.

217
00:18:53,388 --> 00:18:54,653
Hello. - God bless you.

218
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:57,681
Take this Alpine hat.

219
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,012
And here's a suede
jacket. French.

220
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:06,803
I too have been around but
they were different unions.

221
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:10,598
Let's see how he looks
on donning them

222
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,246
Sure, wear it.

223
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:22,786
If you can't snare a catch now,
you won't do it ever in life.

224
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:26,312
One more gift.

225
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:30,490
You don't have to develop or
bother about this camera.

226
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,936
Just aim and shoot...

227
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:40,072
Here's the picture.

228
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:42,027
Son, come here. - Yes, grandma.

229
00:19:44,212 --> 00:19:46,473
- Yes, grandma? -
Good day grandma.

230
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:52,529
You are going to Gangotri.
Who knows when I'll leave...

231
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:55,097
Before I shut my eyes...

232
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,279
Get me Ganga!

233
00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:00,502
Fulfill this wish of mine.

234
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,112
Get me Ganga.

235
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:07,133
Will you make me cry right here?

236
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,512
How will I return with a smile?

237
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,463
What greenery and beauty!

238
00:21:46,826 --> 00:21:48,321
- Good day Professor.
- Good day.

239
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:51,272
- Sudden trip this time? -
Didn't you get our cable?

240
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:54,530
No sir. But we'll
arrange everything.

241
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:40,525
Grandma!

242
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:45,163
Grandma!

243
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:30,276
I've come to take the Ganga
and I'll return with her.

244
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:12,782
Who is it?

245
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:16,807
Who are you? I ask...

246
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:40,149
If you embrace death, how
will you take Ganga home?

247
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:44,059
- Why? - Take one step
forward and see.

248
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:58,777
Who are you?

249
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,070
Your life. - My life...?

250
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:06,826
Life and death don't
come invited.

251
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:08,934
You were to be saved
so I came by.

252
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:13,150
But how will you take Ganga
without any introduction?

253
00:25:16,102 --> 00:25:17,328
In this jug.

254
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:21,161
Tell me truthfully, are
you a man or an angel?

255
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:26,067
- Why? - Lord Shankar had
trapped Mother Ganga in his locks.

256
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,785
Today you've come to
take me in your jug.

257
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:32,851
- Where will I take you?
- You just said...

258
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,534
You've come to take Ganga.
I am Ganga.

259
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:38,102
Yes.

260
00:25:57,535 --> 00:26:00,563
Hurry. We're having
an emergency meeting.

261
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:05,277
Is your name Naren? - Yes.

262
00:26:25,094 --> 00:26:27,930
We've just found
out the road to...

263
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,188
...Bhairav and Janta Pass is
blocked. Due to heavy rains.

264
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:34,599
So instead of going to Gangotri,
we'll have to stay here for...

265
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,979
...some days.

266
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:44,795
Mingle with the locals and
study their customs and traditions.

267
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:48,053
Postman!

268
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:53,265
- Where are you running from?
- Tell you later...

269
00:26:53,802 --> 00:26:56,140
You're the only wise
man in this village.

270
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:59,168
Tell me what Naren means.

271
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:03,346
Not Naren but Narendra.

272
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:07,485
He among men who is akin to God.

273
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:13,886
That is why I wondered
whether the one...

274
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:16,301
...I met was a man or an angel.

275
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:19,942
Don't delay me with your angel.

276
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:21,552
Have to take a cable to the inn.

277
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:23,545
Some boys are coming
from Calcutta.

278
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:27,378
The postal service of the
mountains is really strange.

279
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:30,521
The guests land up and their
message arrives later.

280
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:39,260
Do you believe in fate?

281
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:40,755
Why not?

282
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:45,852
Till yesterday I didn't believe
in fate and destiny.

283
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:51,563
But now I feel that life
is a game of destiny.

284
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:56,355
- Or how would I get a new
life today? - New life?

285
00:27:57,044 --> 00:28:01,452
Yes, I'd probably have died
if she hadn't saved me.

286
00:28:04,135 --> 00:28:08,811
I feel this life
is hers not mine.

287
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:11,686
Whose...?

288
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,435
Who has the innocence of the
innocents on her face.

289
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:20,578
The freshness of flowers
in her smile.

290
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:24,143
The sweetness of the
waves in her voice.

291
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:28,321
And her eyes are as
deep as the Ganga

292
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:33,112
I've cut lots of wood.

293
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:35,987
I've made a pile. Did you hear?

294
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:38,861
Take them to the guest
house tomorrow.

295
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:47,830
I don't understand why these
folk come at such times to risk...

296
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:49,172
...their lives

297
00:28:50,322 --> 00:28:54,921
Not all brother, only one
has come to risk his life.

298
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:57,412
That too, my life.

299
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:02,510
Who are you? - Your life.

300
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:05,078
My life...?

301
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:08,604
You can't take care of yourself.
How will you take me with you?

302
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,402
You...? Where will I take you?

303
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:16,117
You just said, you've come
to take Ganga... I am Ganga.

304
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:09,279
My arms call out for you.

305
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:14,415
And, you would neither
find a Ganga as such.

306
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:22,081
I'm your life and
I'm your destiny.

307
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:25,914
And, you'll get salvation
from me, right here.

308
00:30:28,137 --> 00:30:34,538
Indeed, you've to come to me.

309
00:30:34,614 --> 00:30:40,287
And, indeed,
I've to go along with you.

310
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:43,813
Indeed, you've to come to me.

311
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:52,706
And, indeed, I've to
go along with you.

312
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:04,856
What sort of delay is that,
since Ganga is yours?

313
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:09,839
So, do come. Now, come
over here, O dear.

314
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:16,431
From the peaks of the mountains.

315
00:31:31,763 --> 00:31:37,934
And, sometimes from
the midst of the trees.

316
00:31:37,972 --> 00:31:43,491
Sometimes with the eyes and
sometimes with these lips.

317
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:49,892
I've called for you through
all and sundry ways.

318
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:55,833
The one for whom you've
come searching.

319
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,130
And, the one who has
called out for you.

320
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:07,715
She below the mountain
and behind the spring.

321
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:20,057
So, do come. Now, come
over here, O dear.

322
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:22,663
I've covered myself
with this foggy sheet...

323
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,925
...and I've recoiled
myself in this water.

324
00:32:25,002 --> 00:32:31,134
In the loop of my arms and in
the habitat of the heart.

325
00:32:37,382 --> 00:32:43,131
So, do come. Now, come
over here, O dear.

326
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:55,550
Come over here, O dear.

327
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:06,588
Ganga! - Sir?

328
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,439
How did you come here?

329
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:20,463
First I felt the mountains
were calling out to me.

330
00:33:20,1000 --> 00:33:23,415
Then I felt must be some
melodious stream.

331
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:27,018
But everything culminated
in you.

332
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,199
Were you calling out
to somebody your own?

333
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,460
In the mountains we say...

334
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:35,642
...call with your heart
and he'll truly come.

335
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:38,133
But who are you waiting for?

336
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:42,924
That which is in your heart
but not before you...

337
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:45,799
He is the one called.

338
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:50,283
I'm standing before you. When
did I enter your heart?

339
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:53,465
This is no mountain.

340
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:57,834
Where the voice resounds back.

341
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,667
The voice of the heart
clashes with the heart.

342
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,002
And then settles there.

343
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:11,249
Who teaches you these
nice, philosophies?

344
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,890
The school of the
poor is his heart.

345
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:19,950
Whether it be good or bad, the
heart does what it wants.

346
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,383
Tikam, I've brought
wood. Where should I keep it?

347
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:56,132
Come... you've brought
so much wood!

348
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,199
Have these put in a corner.

349
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:02,648
I'm off to the market.

350
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:06,788
How are you? You
seem very happy.

351
00:35:07,324 --> 00:35:09,816
These foreigners bring
life to this place.

352
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:12,575
Don't ask, work too increases.

353
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,565
I haven't cooked as yet. Help
me and clean the rooms.

354
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:17,826
Give me the broom.

355
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,659
Hey, girl!

356
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:24,534
Did you clean the room? - Yes.

357
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:26,565
- Give me my watch!
- What watch?

358
00:35:26,642 --> 00:35:28,942
- Wristwatch! - I didn't
find any watch.

359
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,695
First you steal, then
you lie! Come!

360
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:35,994
Come with me! - Let go!

361
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:40,134
Let me go sir! I did
not take your watch!

362
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,744
I didn't take it.

363
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,078
I'll call the police right away.
She'll herself admit everything.

364
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:46,535
Mugger, bitch!
- Sir, I didn't steal!

365
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,409
Please open the door. I
didn't steal anything.

366
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:51,632
Open the door!

367
00:35:53,894 --> 00:35:56,768
I'll open it and I'll save
you from the police as well.

368
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,601
But you'll have to pay
the cost of the watch.

369
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:03,783
Sir, open the door!

370
00:36:07,271 --> 00:36:09,877
Anybody there? Sir,
open the door!

371
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:13,710
- Ganga...? - Sir,
he's locked me in!

372
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:16,891
He wants to... open the door!

373
00:36:23,637 --> 00:36:24,902
Have you locked up Ganga?

374
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:29,616
- She stole my watch.
- Are you the warden?

375
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:33,794
Let her go or I'll beat
you black and blue!

376
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:35,711
Are you her brother?

377
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:16,799
What's going on? What are
you watching? Stop them!

378
00:37:18,217 --> 00:37:19,520
I'll show you!

379
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:26,496
Now where will you escape to?

380
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:45,661
Stop it!

381
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:51,410
- Why are you fighting?
- I'll tell you, sir!

382
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:55,588
- He has locked Ganga and...
- Sir, he's lying!

383
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:58,769
She stole my watch! Just
wait for a moment.

384
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:08,045
Sir, ask her whether she
stole my watch or not!

385
00:38:09,885 --> 00:38:12,836
- Did you steal it? - Sir,
we maybe poor...

386
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:16,516
- But not thieves. - Sir,
here's his watch!

387
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:22,763
Here's his watch. Last night,
both these men went to the bar.

388
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,676
And his watch fell off.
A child found it.

389
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:28,167
He gave it to me and
I'm giving it to you.

390
00:38:29,777 --> 00:38:30,889
Is this your watch?

391
00:38:32,652 --> 00:38:33,763
Sir...

392
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:49,095
Did you witness the honesty
of the mountain people?

393
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:51,855
You consider yourself educated?

394
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:55,994
Spreading the filth of the
cities here! Aren't you ashamed?

395
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,562
Let's go!

396
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:12,936
- Why did you leave? -
It's not their fault?

397
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,504
They are city bred folk.

398
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,918
They'll act according
to what they've learnt.

399
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,713
- But I too am city bred.
- Only in dress.

400
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:26,006
Not by heart. Else you wouldn't
believe in Ganga.

401
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:29,494
Why would you fight for me?

402
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:35,205
It must be the blessing of
some elderly family person.

403
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,811
That's why you worship Ganga.

404
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:40,379
My grandma's blessings.

405
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:42,870
She's asked me to get
water from Gangotri.

406
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,822
I would definitely go
had the road been open.

407
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:50,306
You want to go to Gangotri?

408
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:55,097
I want to go to keep my faith
and my grandma's love.

409
00:39:55,404 --> 00:39:58,125
I will take you there,
by the mountain path.

410
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:02,763
Meet me at the first crow of
the cock at the lower mountain.

411
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:04,795
Okay? Tomorrow morning.

412
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,150
Tomorrow morning...
the first crow...

413
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,221
Sir? Did you stay
here all night?

414
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:40,287
How did you know? - Obviously.

415
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:42,740
The cock will now crow.

416
00:40:51,939 --> 00:40:56,232
Careful! Give me the
jug and walk with me.

417
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,006
Strange! Do you practice magic?

418
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:11,563
In the city you can't even be
sure when the alarm will ring.

419
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,940
And you know about the cocks!

420
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,696
- I can find out much
more. - What?

421
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:20,341
Walk with me, you
too will find out.

422
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,410
What shall I find out?

423
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:26,243
The smartness of these city
clothes! What else?

424
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:28,658
You know where we're going?

425
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,146
Where the Ganga originates
from ice.

426
00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:35,979
Little higher and you'll freeze!

427
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:40,732
This jacket is from France and
Alpine hat from Switzerland!

428
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:43,683
Wear it in normal cold
and you'll be roasted.

429
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:46,558
As for the cold here, it will
stand far and shiver!

430
00:41:47,899 --> 00:41:52,154
Is that so? Let's go far
and see who shivers!

431
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,878
The cold or you!

432
00:43:14,714 --> 00:43:18,432
What's the matter? Now tell
me, who is shivering?

433
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:20,732
The cold or you?

434
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:24,565
- I'm not shivering. - then
take off your shoes.

435
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:26,558
And follow me. - Yes.

436
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:32,269
Is the water very cold?

437
00:43:33,802 --> 00:43:37,060
Stepping in cold water when
it's cold gives you warmth.

438
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:41,851
I'm coming!

439
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:49,517
I'm frozen!

440
00:43:52,468 --> 00:43:54,959
You walk less and fall more.

441
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,792
I know that Ganga will
hold me before I fall.

442
00:43:59,674 --> 00:44:02,510
- Where do I keep my feet?
- On the ground.

443
00:44:02,548 --> 00:44:05,002
The ground has slipped away
from under my feet!

444
00:44:12,552 --> 00:44:13,740
I'm freezing!

445
00:44:13,894 --> 00:44:16,615
I'll freeze to death!
Can't feel my limbs!

446
00:44:17,343 --> 00:44:20,793
Which ones? - Nose and legs!

447
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:26,542
Legs are all right but I can't
feel if I still have a nose!

448
00:44:31,985 --> 00:44:34,208
It's very much in place.
Can't you feel it?

449
00:44:40,341 --> 00:44:41,567
Now...?

450
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:44,135
Then it's frozen.

451
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:46,358
It will get better only
if you shut your eyes.

452
00:45:08,474 --> 00:45:11,234
What did you do?
Touched my feet?

453
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:17,060
Sir, in this world, people fall
at their mother's feet.

454
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:21,084
But Ganga first touches
everybody's feet.

455
00:45:23,001 --> 00:45:25,607
Do you know who
serves like this?

456
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:27,677
The wife.

457
00:45:28,252 --> 00:45:32,353
Who takes you to your destination
when all paths are closed?

458
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,423
Beloved.

459
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:38,409
And what is she called when
they culminate in one person?

460
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:43,545
Your Ganga, dear sir.

461
00:45:45,768 --> 00:45:46,841
Dear sir...?

462
00:45:48,758 --> 00:45:53,127
It's so strange. One feels cold
when he goes to this Ganga.

463
00:45:54,162 --> 00:45:56,615
Close to you, one feels warm.

464
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:42,916
The weather of these mountains.

465
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:51,962
O, sir, the weather
of these mountains.

466
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,983
It's indeed great as the whole
year has a chilly weather.

467
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:14,538
This moment is verily pleasant.

468
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:23,660
So, why should I
dread the chill?

469
00:47:23,737 --> 00:47:28,528
When I've the sizzling
beauty along with me.

470
00:47:58,693 --> 00:48:05,362
This valley is full of
the blooming flowers.

471
00:48:05,438 --> 00:48:11,686
So, who is it that
beatified it overnight?

472
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:18,317
It seems it's our
marriage in here.

473
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,356
These are indeed flowery words.

474
00:48:29,394 --> 00:48:34,147
As, it's often said
in the mountains.

475
00:48:34,185 --> 00:48:39,436
That, outsiders are
no doubt liars.

476
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:12,131
O stranger, where did
you come from?

477
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:18,838
The moment you came; you carved
a niche in my heart.

478
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:25,239
What should I do as my heart
is seeping out of my eyes?

479
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:36,431
These are some small streams.

480
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:40,762
And, I've to swear by touching
the water of these streams.

481
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:46,013
The streams keep on flowing.

482
00:49:48,006 --> 00:49:52,146
Instead, swear by the mountains...

483
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:56,937
...who remain in the same place.

484
00:49:57,014 --> 00:50:02,227
The hand is in the hand.

485
00:50:05,446 --> 00:50:10,314
So, the path has passed away
amidst this sweet chat.

486
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:14,722
This world keeps on singing.

487
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:20,088
Listen to us; this world
keeps on singing.

488
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:26,220
That let alone a path;
the whole life passes in love.

489
00:50:32,621 --> 00:50:37,297
That let alone a path;
the whole life passes in love.

490
00:51:22,832 --> 00:51:27,930
It was our perseverance that a
river took the form of Ganga.

491
00:51:28,006 --> 00:51:33,296
And, it's we, who have
seen your two parts.

492
00:51:33,832 --> 00:51:38,624
And, it's we, who're blessed
enough to get your holy milk.

493
00:51:58,746 --> 00:52:01,698
- May I ask you something?
- Yes.

494
00:52:02,617 --> 00:52:05,454
The postman says Ganga
flows even in Calcutta.

495
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,098
Then why did your grandma ask
for its' water from here?

496
00:52:12,621 --> 00:52:15,113
Because she hasn't seen
this pure form of Ganga.

497
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:19,291
If she would, she'd take
it with her forever.

498
00:52:20,325 --> 00:52:22,472
It's not only about
a pot of water.

499
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,956
But of the faith that
flows with the Ganga.

500
00:52:27,915 --> 00:52:30,521
And lives like a drop
in a woman's heart.

501
00:52:35,657 --> 00:52:37,842
That drop is called love.

502
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:41,023
Man drowns in its' depth
and becomes a lover.

503
00:52:42,364 --> 00:52:45,431
He lives in Ganga
and belongs to her.

504
00:52:46,657 --> 00:52:47,999
He gives in to her.

505
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:51,448
Do you understand her so well?

506
00:52:53,825 --> 00:52:55,665
Then take her along.

507
00:52:58,884 --> 00:52:59,996
Take her...

508
00:53:02,066 --> 00:53:04,289
There's a letter from
Manglu in Paharganj.

509
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:08,773
- What does he say?
- He wishes me.

510
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:14,484
Our fathers had decided it and
now I'm eligible for marriage.

511
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:16,439
Ganga too must not be a child.

512
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:18,700
I'll be taking part
in the ceremony...

513
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:21,230
...on full moon night
with friends.

514
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:26,673
Tell Ganga to put the garland in
my neck publicly and marry me.

515
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:29,892
Our welfare lies in it. Your
brother-in-law, Manglu.

516
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:36,102
He's making up relations as
if we're already married!

517
00:53:36,523 --> 00:53:39,168
You will be very soon.

518
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:42,924
Marriages are not
made in heaven.

519
00:53:43,576 --> 00:53:48,865
They are made on earth. And
that's what father wanted.

520
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:54,614
I've quit a military job
to fulfill his wish.

521
00:53:55,151 --> 00:54:01,169
Didn't get married, wanting
you to settle first.

522
00:54:07,148 --> 00:54:09,064
Where has she gone leaving
the bread on the fire?

523
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:17,458
I've made my decision.
I want to know yours.

524
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:21,560
- But what's the occasion?
- Full moon.

525
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:24,358
We get married without
ceremonies in the mountains.

526
00:54:25,852 --> 00:54:27,692
That's the only day in a year...

527
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:30,260
...when a woman can
choose her husband.

528
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,442
Regarding what you said,
what happens to Mangru?

529
00:54:33,518 --> 00:54:36,968
- Your Dad chose him for
you. - But I didn't.

530
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,376
My life and my joys...
lie at your feet now.

531
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:47,393
Will you let me live
by your love?

532
00:55:30,053 --> 00:55:31,433
Are you mad?

533
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,848
Who believes the traditions
of these mountains?

534
00:55:34,116 --> 00:55:38,524
Industrialist Sahai won't
accept a tribal as your bride...

535
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,865
...because of you!

536
00:55:39,942 --> 00:55:43,660
Naren Sahai has to get married
not industrialist Jeeva Sahai!

537
00:55:44,618 --> 00:55:46,535
The man who couldn't give
me the love of a father...

538
00:55:47,225 --> 00:55:50,214
He'll give me a doll of
money instead of love.

539
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:54,085
Yes, I do care about grandma.

540
00:55:55,312 --> 00:55:58,378
But when she reveres the
river Ganga so much...

541
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,560
Won't she accept
Ganga in person?

542
00:56:12,752 --> 00:56:15,128
Read out what Naren writes.

543
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:19,306
Respected grandma, my greetings.

544
00:56:20,226 --> 00:56:25,208
I met Ganga in person and she
filled the loneliness in me.

545
00:56:26,128 --> 00:56:29,885
I need your blessings so that
you too can see her pure form.

546
00:56:30,919 --> 00:56:34,752
Rest when we meet. Regards to
elders and love to younger ones.

547
00:56:35,404 --> 00:56:36,975
Your darling, Naren.

548
00:56:37,512 --> 00:56:42,418
As if there's anyone younger
than you! Hides his love!

549
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,056
Let him come. I'll get both
of you tied together.

550
00:56:48,129 --> 00:56:49,777
I'll talk to your father.

551
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:54,262
- Now write just as I say.
- All right, grandma.

552
00:57:27,186 --> 00:57:30,253
Listen, O sir. The tune of love.

553
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:32,207
I've chosen you, so you
do choose me as well.

554
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:45,661
Listen, O sir. The tune of love.

555
00:58:30,122 --> 00:58:35,488
I've chosen you, so you
do choose me as well.

556
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:41,276
No girl ever takes
the first step.

557
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:51,586
And, she never comes close if she
isn't helpless by the heart.

558
00:58:51,663 --> 00:58:54,729
There is no limit to my joy as I
intend to spend my life with you.

559
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:04,120
So, weave the threads of
love along with me.

560
00:59:04,197 --> 00:59:05,615
Listen, O sir.

561
00:59:07,186 --> 00:59:09,103
The tune of love.

562
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:16,155
I've chosen you, so you do
choose me as well.

563
00:59:35,703 --> 00:59:41,606
If you affirm to it then
the whole thing is set.

564
00:59:41,682 --> 00:59:47,738
And, if you indicate then
I'm ready to come along.

565
00:59:53,641 --> 00:59:56,822
And, if you indicate then
I'm ready to come along.

566
00:59:56,899 --> 01:00:00,195
I'll dance and sing
for you, O sir.

567
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:09,241
So, give refuge to
me in your heart.

568
01:00:09,432 --> 01:00:11,310
And, I'll turn your house
into a proper refuge.

569
01:00:12,345 --> 01:00:13,649
So, raise an eye at me and
give me the token of love.

570
01:00:40,479 --> 01:00:46,190
The blood of my heart
testifies for me.

571
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:52,054
Perhaps, my doom is
written at your hands.

572
01:00:59,107 --> 01:01:02,020
I've given my heart to you.

573
01:01:02,096 --> 01:01:05,431
I'm ready to give my
life for you.

574
01:01:08,804 --> 01:01:14,016
So, accept me as it
would be a virtuous deed.

575
01:01:14,515 --> 01:01:15,933
Listen, O sir.

576
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:19,114
The tune of love.

577
01:01:21,146 --> 01:01:26,703
I've chosen you, so you
do choose me as well.

578
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,313
Listen, O sir.

579
01:01:30,306 --> 01:01:32,146
The tune of love.

580
01:01:39,467 --> 01:01:43,146
Dharma Singh!

581
01:01:43,223 --> 01:01:45,906
I've chosen you, so you do
choose me as well.

582
01:02:03,384 --> 01:02:04,764
Let's go.

583
01:02:49,954 --> 01:02:53,940
Your love adorned me and I
became your bride today.

584
01:02:54,668 --> 01:02:57,849
But will your family accept me?

585
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:04,327
If they want their son, they
have to accept his wife.

586
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:28,091
Move out of the way.

587
01:03:28,397 --> 01:03:31,924
Their nuptial night will
be their last one!

588
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:35,450
You will never reach my
sister and her husband.

589
01:03:36,102 --> 01:03:39,589
I'll hack you and your men
to pieces and burn you up!

590
01:07:24,503 --> 01:07:26,420
Naren will return on the 15th.

591
01:07:26,803 --> 01:07:31,057
We received his telegram this
morning so we came with gifts.

592
01:07:31,594 --> 01:07:34,085
I thought we should consult
Naren once he returns.

593
01:07:34,469 --> 01:07:38,800
Why do you need his opinion? Our
decision is his life's decree.

594
01:07:39,413 --> 01:07:44,319
When things are to happen,
everything falls into place.

595
01:07:45,469 --> 01:07:46,887
Come here, Radha.

596
01:07:51,295 --> 01:07:54,860
Live long. Do you know how
much Naren loves me?

597
01:07:54,936 --> 01:07:57,811
He has written in his cable.
I'm not coming alone.

598
01:07:57,888 --> 01:07:59,804
I'm bringing your Ganga along.

599
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:18,470
Your Ganga.

600
01:08:24,296 --> 01:08:25,753
I'm taking water.

601
01:08:26,213 --> 01:08:29,509
With my grandma's blessings
I'll come for my bride.

602
01:08:30,046 --> 01:08:36,063
I'll wait for you. Whether
you return or not.

603
01:08:38,018 --> 01:08:39,934
Separation doesn't
break relations.

604
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:44,994
I'll return soon, very soon.

605
01:08:53,388 --> 01:08:55,534
I've given you all I had.

606
01:08:56,914 --> 01:09:01,897
Your Ganga will live in rags.
I only have one request...

607
01:09:02,587 --> 01:09:05,078
Don't let your Ganga be sullied.

608
01:09:19,337 --> 01:09:21,368
It's time to leave.
Where is Naren?

609
01:09:39,038 --> 01:09:43,752
At least, listen to what
Ganga wants to say.

610
01:09:44,787 --> 01:09:48,620
That, verily those
people came on my path.

611
01:09:50,536 --> 01:09:55,596
The ones who formed such rules.

612
01:09:56,554 --> 01:09:59,543
That, even though life ends,
the promise shouldn't be broken.

613
01:10:02,456 --> 01:10:08,129
I've trust in your promise.

614
01:10:08,206 --> 01:10:12,805
As I indeed know
that you're mine.

615
01:10:13,495 --> 01:10:17,290
So, till you don't come.

616
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:25,530
My heart will keep on singing.

617
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:37,911
Do come.

618
01:10:37,987 --> 01:10:42,548
Please come, O sir.

619
01:11:01,866 --> 01:11:04,779
- How are you, mother?
- I'm fine. And you...?

620
01:11:04,856 --> 01:11:07,079
I'm fine. Where's grandma?

621
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:13,327
- Grandma! Grandma!
- My son has come!

622
01:11:14,131 --> 01:11:17,313
- My grandma! - what
are you doing?

623
01:11:17,696 --> 01:11:19,574
You grandma will fall down.

624
01:11:20,571 --> 01:11:22,755
Who will let you fall
as long as I'm alive?

625
01:11:25,362 --> 01:11:27,700
Bring the jug from my luggage.

626
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:32,031
Quickly bless me and listen
to some good news.

627
01:11:32,108 --> 01:11:36,362
First won't you ask what
the decorations are for.

628
01:11:36,515 --> 01:11:39,237
That's because I've
returned home.

629
01:11:39,314 --> 01:11:42,725
No. Today you're getting
engaged to Radha.

630
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:48,666
Engagement?

631
01:11:50,314 --> 01:11:52,192
Mine? - Yes.

632
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:17,374
At least, listen to what
Ganga wants to say.

633
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:22,012
That, verily those
people came on my path.

634
01:12:22,165 --> 01:12:23,775
What's the matter?

635
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:26,650
Nothing...

636
01:12:27,646 --> 01:12:29,524
I want to say something to you.

637
01:12:31,517 --> 01:12:33,970
What's it about? Say
it before everybody.

638
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:38,340
First you hear it. Then
you tell the others.

639
01:12:39,566 --> 01:12:41,675
God knows what he wants to
quietly tell his grandma...

640
01:12:44,549 --> 01:12:48,689
The ones who formed such rules.

641
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:53,901
That, even though life ends,
the promise shouldn't be broken.

642
01:13:05,975 --> 01:13:07,815
I too gave my word.

643
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:12,299
I'd give this water to you
and bring my Ganga here.

644
01:13:14,982 --> 01:13:17,742
Don't do this to me! Please!

645
01:13:19,007 --> 01:13:23,146
She won't bear it!

646
01:13:24,565 --> 01:13:26,021
I've accepted her.

647
01:13:26,673 --> 01:13:29,509
Our union is witness to
it not the sacred fire.

648
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:35,642
It's a bond of promise
not marriage ceremony.

649
01:13:36,293 --> 01:13:39,474
It can be destroyed not broken.

650
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:48,980
What have you done...!

651
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:55,764
- Grandma! Father...!
- What's wrong?

652
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:02,932
Mother! Quickly call the doctor!

653
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:06,420
- What happened? - I...
- What happened!

654
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:09,141
Mother...

655
01:14:33,633 --> 01:14:35,665
I don't understand
what's happened...

656
01:14:37,466 --> 01:14:39,497
Anything can trigger
off a heart attack.

657
01:14:40,877 --> 01:14:42,066
I've given her an injection.

658
01:14:42,794 --> 01:14:46,090
If there's no relief I'll
arrange for a cardiac monitor.

659
01:15:44,618 --> 01:15:45,883
Grandma...

660
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:49,294
Get well soon... please...

661
01:15:53,127 --> 01:15:55,044
All that I said is a lie.

662
01:15:55,695 --> 01:15:58,033
Consider it a lie...

663
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:01,560
You had asked me
to bring water...

664
01:16:01,636 --> 01:16:02,824
...from the Ganga for
your last days.

665
01:16:04,703 --> 01:16:07,616
I brought your last breath!

666
01:16:24,787 --> 01:16:26,167
Yes, grandma...?

667
01:16:45,829 --> 01:16:50,314
Not this, silly boy.
Your Ganga...

668
01:16:51,579 --> 01:16:53,534
Bring your bride...

669
01:17:02,004 --> 01:17:03,077
Grandma!

670
01:17:10,743 --> 01:17:13,733
Father! Mother!

671
01:17:14,768 --> 01:17:16,071
Hurry up! - What's wrong?

672
01:17:16,109 --> 01:17:20,057
Something has happened
to grandma! Mother!

673
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,849
What did you tell her?

674
01:18:01,146 --> 01:18:02,334
Nothing. - Nothing...?

675
01:18:02,602 --> 01:18:06,358
Speak the truth! What did you
say that killed my mother?

676
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:10,996
- I didn't say anything!
- My mother died but...

677
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:13,871
I won't keep you alive to carry
the family name forward!

678
01:18:15,519 --> 01:18:17,397
What did you tell her?

679
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:20,310
- Don't beat a grown-up
son! - Move away!

680
01:18:20,693 --> 01:18:23,606
I raised my mother's murderer
in my own house!

681
01:18:24,143 --> 01:18:27,286
What did you tell her?

682
01:18:28,512 --> 01:18:32,269
Since you went out, I knew
something would happen!

683
01:18:35,297 --> 01:18:40,663
You did as you pleased and left
me to bear the consequences!

684
01:18:42,311 --> 01:18:43,537
Answer me!

685
01:18:44,764 --> 01:18:46,105
Stop it, Jeeva.

686
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:50,552
What has he done? Do you
want to send out 2 pyres?

687
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:56,148
This family doesn't
need your sympathy

688
01:18:56,722 --> 01:19:00,785
Earlier it was you alone. Now
this family has 2 blots.

689
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:04,810
Don't be mistaken. Even
I lose my temper.

690
01:19:05,346 --> 01:19:07,186
Will you raise your hand?

691
01:19:08,681 --> 01:19:10,713
Brothel-keeper! Living
off your mistress!

692
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:13,894
I tolerated you as long
as mother lived.

693
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:16,155
I'll hack and throw you out!

694
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:19,030
A brothel-keeper
doesn't die easy.

695
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:22,135
Tough to kill him.
As for your house...

696
01:19:22,594 --> 01:19:25,967
I never returned to the brothel
where I once spat!

697
01:19:26,696 --> 01:19:29,877
Call me names if I ever
step here again!

698
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:36,278
Brothel-keeper! But keep one
thing in mind. I don't have a son.

699
01:19:36,929 --> 01:19:40,072
If you harm Naren, I'll turn
your stars upside down!

700
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:56,056
I've tried Naren's number
5 times since morning.

701
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:59,390
But I can't get him Did
he come to college?

702
01:20:00,923 --> 01:20:02,763
No. - Then meet him at home.

703
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:07,861
I went to his house though
I didn't want to.

704
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:11,080
He's not ready to meet me.

705
01:20:11,464 --> 01:20:14,568
He sent word that he did
not want to meet anyone.

706
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:18,248
Sometime he may have said
something to you!

707
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,356
You are good friends.

708
01:20:21,544 --> 01:20:24,227
I don't understand what's wrong.

709
01:20:26,795 --> 01:20:28,022
What can I say?

710
01:20:42,012 --> 01:20:44,503
Post uncle, has
he sent a letter?

711
01:20:44,963 --> 01:20:49,218
No but a letter has
come for Naren Sahai.

712
01:20:49,754 --> 01:20:50,981
When he has already left.

713
01:20:53,587 --> 01:20:57,842
Give it to me. I'll give
it to him when he comes.

714
01:20:59,873 --> 01:21:04,089
But I fear, letters still
reach the mountains.

715
01:21:05,622 --> 01:21:09,379
- He mustn't be late. - Why?
Is something the matter?

716
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:12,215
Ganga is pregnant.

717
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:27,738
He must be on his way and
he'll get lots of gifts.

718
01:21:28,658 --> 01:21:33,756
And a child is the greatest
gift which you can give him.

719
01:22:37,075 --> 01:22:44,166
Wherever you'll see for me.

720
01:22:44,243 --> 01:22:47,539
You'll find me over there.

721
01:22:47,616 --> 01:22:51,065
From the way till the caravan.

722
01:22:51,448 --> 01:22:54,783
And, from the
ground till the sky.

723
01:22:54,821 --> 01:22:57,121
It me and me and
none other but me.

724
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:54,614
Since, you're walking along
with your hand in my hand.

725
01:24:01,935 --> 01:24:05,193
The whole ambience and
all the four directions.

726
01:24:05,231 --> 01:24:08,528
Seem to be along with me.

727
01:24:08,681 --> 01:24:15,235
And, there's no path
that doesn't come to me.

728
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:19,222
It me and me.

729
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:22,901
And none other but me.

730
01:24:22,939 --> 01:24:29,570
Wherever you'll see for me.

731
01:24:30,069 --> 01:24:33,365
You'll find me over there.

732
01:24:33,442 --> 01:24:36,891
From the way till the caravan.

733
01:24:36,968 --> 01:24:40,226
And, from the ground
till the sky.

734
01:24:40,686 --> 01:24:43,790
It me and me and
none other but me.

735
01:25:05,025 --> 01:25:08,397
You haven't stepped out of the
house since grandma passed away.

736
01:25:09,011 --> 01:25:12,652
Radha calls up, many friends
came and returned.

737
01:25:13,265 --> 01:25:16,715
What do I answer them?
At least talk to Radha.

738
01:25:18,516 --> 01:25:22,349
- What do I tell her? - How do
I know what's in your heart?

739
01:25:24,227 --> 01:25:28,482
Grandma was right. Sitting
within 4 walls doesn't help.

740
01:25:31,701 --> 01:25:33,273
Neither does pain reduce.

741
01:25:41,475 --> 01:25:45,308
You are right, mother.
I must do something.

742
01:25:47,186 --> 01:25:48,259
I must.

743
01:26:16,661 --> 01:26:17,926
Trust me.

744
01:26:19,344 --> 01:26:21,874
Meet me at Howrah station
at 5 this evening.

745
01:26:23,752 --> 01:26:27,470
Why? - Don't ask me that.

746
01:26:28,275 --> 01:26:32,759
- But... - If possible,
get a thousand bucks too.

747
01:26:33,794 --> 01:26:36,899
Yes, I'll get the cash. Wait
for me at the inquiry counter.

748
01:27:03,154 --> 01:27:07,600
At least tell me where you're
going and when you'll return.

749
01:27:07,945 --> 01:27:11,510
Nobody returns after proceeding
on the path of love.

750
01:27:13,043 --> 01:27:14,269
I too won't return.

751
01:27:22,012 --> 01:27:24,120
I'll speak on social reform
in tomorrow's congregation.

752
01:27:24,542 --> 01:27:26,458
I'll talk to the CM tomorrow.

753
01:27:29,371 --> 01:27:34,737
- What's the matter? - I
want to go out of town.

754
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,417
Sure. Want to go with friends?

755
01:27:39,911 --> 01:27:43,208
- Is Naren too going?
- Nobody is going.

756
01:27:44,243 --> 01:27:46,236
I'll go alone. - What's wrong?

757
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:53,901
I know I can't give you
time because of my work.

758
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:59,957
Your marriage is postponed
because of grandma's death.

759
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:05,170
Go to Darjeeling with Naren.
I'll call and fix everything.

760
01:28:07,355 --> 01:28:10,958
Don't call up, Daddy!
Naren has left!

761
01:28:13,411 --> 01:28:16,554
There's nothing I can't
do for your happiness.

762
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:19,428
Truthfully tell me where he is.

763
01:28:22,303 --> 01:28:25,829
Now he'll never return! Never!

764
01:28:27,784 --> 01:28:29,662
I've lost Naren!

765
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:32,537
Now he'll never return!

766
01:28:33,572 --> 01:28:34,760
He will never return!

767
01:28:40,318 --> 01:28:42,158
How can that be possible?

768
01:28:43,192 --> 01:28:44,572
He has never gone to college
without informing us!

769
01:28:44,649 --> 01:28:45,990
How can he leave the city?

770
01:28:48,367 --> 01:28:49,823
He has left and will
never return!

771
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:53,350
But... where could he have gone?

772
01:28:56,224 --> 01:28:58,792
I'm not worried about
where he has gone.

773
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:05,155
I'm worried because the daughter
whose happiness is my aim...

774
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:08,374
...unfortunately loves your son!

775
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:11,901
I'm worried about how easily...

776
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:17,382
...I can ruin you if
Naren doesn't return!

777
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:23,054
There must be something
if Chaudhary says so.

778
01:29:23,476 --> 01:29:25,967
You've pampered him! Did
he say anything to you?

779
01:29:26,351 --> 01:29:31,372
No but maybe he has left
some letter or address.

780
01:30:03,108 --> 01:30:04,181
Listen...

781
01:30:05,599 --> 01:30:06,826
Look at this.

782
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:10,007
Isn't this the pot in which
Naren bought water for mother?

783
01:30:10,391 --> 01:30:12,882
Yes, it is. But why?

784
01:30:29,593 --> 01:30:31,433
Why are you worried?

785
01:30:32,085 --> 01:30:34,729
Often young men lose
their senses.

786
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,061
Get me the Home Minister.

787
01:30:41,552 --> 01:30:43,200
Naren can't go anywhere now.

788
01:30:46,343 --> 01:30:50,099
Hear this again. A
fair skinned boy.

789
01:30:50,176 --> 01:30:53,740
Height 5 feet 9 inches.
Black bag in hand.

790
01:30:54,009 --> 01:30:56,807
Surround the train so
he doesn't escape.

791
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:07,501
Don't forget the bathroom.

792
01:32:09,478 --> 01:32:11,050
One ticket to Gangotri.

793
01:32:13,043 --> 01:32:14,269
Which bus?

794
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,963
You can't go further.
Come with me.

795
01:32:25,883 --> 01:32:29,371
- What's my crime? - We
don't nab only criminals.

796
01:32:29,793 --> 01:32:31,709
You have run away from home.

797
01:32:31,786 --> 01:32:34,085
Your protection is
our responsibility.

798
01:32:35,504 --> 01:32:38,187
Don't worry about me.
Let me go, inspector.

799
01:32:38,493 --> 01:32:41,061
If I don't reach in time,
her life will be ruined.

800
01:32:42,824 --> 01:32:46,657
Let me meet her just once.
Then I'll surrender myself.

801
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:49,417
Trust me.

802
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:05,017
Son, don't consider this a cell.

803
01:33:05,745 --> 01:33:07,585
Till your family takes you...

804
01:33:07,662 --> 01:33:11,111
...it's my duty to keep
you in this outhouse.

805
01:33:11,993 --> 01:33:16,362
You are under police watch so
don't try to make a run for it.

806
01:33:36,485 --> 01:33:41,084
O companion... O my beloved.

807
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:50,245
I get my inspiration
to live, from you.

808
01:33:50,322 --> 01:33:55,151
You have given me the
courage and motivation

809
01:33:55,534 --> 01:34:00,785
O beloved, I surrender to you.

810
01:34:00,862 --> 01:34:05,385
All my breaths are
indebted to you.

811
01:34:05,461 --> 01:34:08,413
How will I ever repay it?

812
01:34:08,451 --> 01:34:16,922
O dear... O beloved...

813
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:21,943
You are the dearest to me.

814
01:34:22,403 --> 01:34:27,462
You are my destination
and my support.

815
01:34:27,577 --> 01:34:32,445
O guest of my heart,
listen to me.

816
01:34:32,905 --> 01:34:37,619
Feels as if the life
is going along with you.

817
01:34:37,696 --> 01:34:40,494
Please come soon.

818
01:34:40,571 --> 01:34:43,714
O dear... O beloved.

819
01:35:00,003 --> 01:35:04,986
I have won the ornament
of your heart.

820
01:35:10,812 --> 01:35:15,603
Difficult for me to
live without you now.

821
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:21,238
May the tears not fall,
all day and night.

822
01:35:26,795 --> 01:35:31,701
One has to face
separation in love.

823
01:35:31,778 --> 01:35:39,597
O dear... O beloved.

824
01:35:40,287 --> 01:35:45,270
Just do not know, what will
happen tomorrow.

825
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:50,904
I have offered this virgin
beauty of mine to you.

826
01:35:50,981 --> 01:35:55,810
O guest of the heart,
listen to me.

827
01:35:56,270 --> 01:36:00,486
Feels as if the life is
going along with you.

828
01:36:00,563 --> 01:36:03,859
Please come soon.

829
01:36:03,936 --> 01:36:06,121
O dear... O beloved.

830
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,898
My child!

831
01:36:30,728 --> 01:36:33,219
Where did you go without
telling your mother?

832
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:35,481
YOU could have told me...

833
01:36:36,515 --> 01:36:38,969
I would if I intended to return.

834
01:36:39,965 --> 01:36:44,411
Now you can't even peer out of
this room without my permission!

835
01:36:47,554 --> 01:36:48,896
All of you listen!

836
01:36:49,547 --> 01:36:51,119
If he gets out of this room...

837
01:36:52,115 --> 01:36:54,837
I'll fire and kill you!

838
01:36:56,638 --> 01:37:00,088
But how long will you
keep him locked?

839
01:37:00,739 --> 01:37:02,311
Till he gets married.

840
01:37:04,572 --> 01:37:08,712
I've lost my son due to
my mother's pampering.

841
01:37:10,973 --> 01:37:13,081
I don't want to lose my
business and power due to your...

842
01:37:13,158 --> 01:37:14,346
...maternal love!

843
01:37:53,173 --> 01:37:55,013
Be patient.

844
01:37:56,623 --> 01:37:58,539
Just a little while.

845
01:38:07,125 --> 01:38:08,466
There...

846
01:38:30,582 --> 01:38:31,770
You've delivered a son.

847
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:42,349
- Post man... - What
is it? - A son.

848
01:38:43,576 --> 01:38:48,482
Son! Didn't I say my Ganga
would have a son?

849
01:38:49,325 --> 01:38:52,046
I'm a grandfather! I've
got a grandson!

850
01:38:52,621 --> 01:38:55,918
Have some sweet. You too.

851
01:38:57,872 --> 01:39:03,622
Distribute this to the village
and tell them I'm a grandfather!

852
01:39:03,775 --> 01:39:06,573
I've become a grandfather!

853
01:39:07,033 --> 01:39:08,221
I've got a grandson!

854
01:39:10,406 --> 01:39:12,207
Listen, you villagers!

855
01:39:12,284 --> 01:39:13,625
I've got a grandson!

856
01:39:37,773 --> 01:39:38,846
Why are you sad?

857
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:41,759
I've made all the arrangements
for the wedding.

858
01:39:42,449 --> 01:39:44,634
I've even fixed the
auspicious moment.

859
01:39:45,323 --> 01:39:48,773
Radha's prayers be answered
both of you get married.

860
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:52,299
My job is done. Come in.

861
01:40:23,652 --> 01:40:24,841
Uncle!

862
01:40:25,569 --> 01:40:28,673
Just because I stopped coming
home you've thrown me out of...

863
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:29,900
...your heart.

864
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:34,269
Don't say that uncle. Please.

865
01:40:35,649 --> 01:40:40,210
Your father's door maybe shut
on me but Kunj knows of your...

866
01:40:40,249 --> 01:40:41,475
...every breath.

867
01:40:43,315 --> 01:40:47,225
- I know everything.
- I know that.

868
01:40:49,524 --> 01:40:51,709
There's something
in your silence.

869
01:40:52,936 --> 01:40:54,584
Your heart is talking to mother.

870
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:59,375
But tell me too. I
won't let you down.

871
01:41:00,065 --> 01:41:02,403
I'll tell you everything.

872
01:41:03,284 --> 01:41:05,776
You'll probably understand
what nobody else does.

873
01:41:06,351 --> 01:41:07,616
Come on.

874
01:41:11,142 --> 01:41:12,407
Come on.

875
01:41:14,936 --> 01:41:16,814
Where is that rascal
taking Naren?

876
01:41:17,734 --> 01:41:19,153
Don't use such words
in a temple.

877
01:41:20,264 --> 01:41:24,519
Naren has come out after so
long and Kunj is no outsider.

878
01:41:24,902 --> 01:41:26,857
- He wants his welfare.
- I know that!

879
01:41:28,236 --> 01:41:29,693
I know what welfare he's up to!

880
01:41:32,108 --> 01:41:34,024
He hasn't sent any word.

881
01:41:34,982 --> 01:41:38,010
Read out the letter
that came for him

882
01:41:40,693 --> 01:41:44,718
If we find his address, I'll
send the good news of his son.

883
01:41:57,175 --> 01:41:59,934
Will you be able to hear
me read out this letter?

884
01:42:02,886 --> 01:42:07,025
Can't the one who had a son
without him listen to a letter?

885
01:42:09,977 --> 01:42:12,276
Dear Naren, love.

886
01:42:12,353 --> 01:42:13,733
Received you letter.

887
01:42:14,078 --> 01:42:16,301
Grandma is elated.

888
01:42:16,684 --> 01:42:21,015
She is convinced only the pure
Ganga can give you new life.

889
01:42:21,629 --> 01:42:25,270
By the time you reach here,
everything would be arranged.

890
01:42:25,883 --> 01:42:28,451
Grandma has fixed your
marriage to me.

891
01:42:29,141 --> 01:42:34,200
I wait for you to return so we
can be tied in a firm bond.

892
01:42:35,159 --> 01:42:38,187
Waiting for you.
Your very own...

893
01:42:53,135 --> 01:42:54,361
He is right.

894
01:42:55,588 --> 01:42:57,849
He's already given me
what he owed my love.

895
01:43:00,417 --> 01:43:02,909
The mother may nurture
the child.

896
01:43:04,212 --> 01:43:05,477
But the seed is the father's

897
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:13,143
And if he doesn't get his
father's name, he won't forgive me...

898
01:43:13,219 --> 01:43:14,752
...till death!

899
01:43:16,094 --> 01:43:19,237
Even if I don't have a
right on him today...

900
01:43:21,843 --> 01:43:24,028
But he does.

901
01:43:25,293 --> 01:43:28,167
I'll go to Calcutta to
give him his rights.

902
01:43:29,509 --> 01:43:32,805
You'll go to Calcutta?
I'll take you there.

903
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,670
The father bids farewell to
his daughter at the door.

904
01:43:39,704 --> 01:43:41,276
Not to her husband's door.

905
01:43:42,387 --> 01:43:45,262
Only tell me, where is Calcutta.

906
01:43:46,335 --> 01:43:49,210
The place where Ganga
originates is your home.

907
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:52,813
Where it ends is Calcutta.

908
01:43:56,761 --> 01:44:01,054
Look, neither has the dwarf
touched the moon...

909
01:44:02,089 --> 01:44:03,967
Nor the moon the dwarf.

910
01:44:05,385 --> 01:44:06,803
This is just a passing fancy.

911
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:11,287
In today's world, does anyone
be faithful to such relations?

912
01:44:13,587 --> 01:44:16,692
Actually nobody has.

913
01:44:18,762 --> 01:44:23,438
But what relation was it that
made you stop going to brothels?

914
01:44:24,281 --> 01:44:26,926
Where lamps were
lit by your name.

915
01:44:27,577 --> 01:44:30,452
What is it here that you made
this brothel your home?

916
01:44:31,372 --> 01:44:33,250
You gave up everything for her.

917
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:37,811
- Even the caste. -
That was different.

918
01:44:39,574 --> 01:44:43,560
Caste, community can't
erase my destiny.

919
01:44:44,365 --> 01:44:46,320
Don't blame destiny.

920
01:44:47,738 --> 01:44:51,226
The truth is you love her.

921
01:44:51,954 --> 01:44:55,327
A lot of love which your
wife never gave you.

922
01:44:57,895 --> 01:45:01,728
If she understood me, I'd probably
never have gone to brothels.

923
01:45:02,418 --> 01:45:06,788
I was alone so nobody cared,
but you are not alone.

924
01:45:07,631 --> 01:45:11,579
You're stuck between 2 walls.
On one side is your father.

925
01:45:11,655 --> 01:45:14,185
Who thinks your life
is his property.

926
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:17,060
And there's Bhagwat Chaudhary
on the other side!

927
01:45:17,865 --> 01:45:20,893
Even the government can't fight
his tactics and games.

928
01:45:21,621 --> 01:45:24,802
So what are you? On what
basis will you fight him?

929
01:45:26,412 --> 01:45:29,210
Ganga. With her love.

930
01:45:30,245 --> 01:45:32,430
If I win, I'll get life.

931
01:45:33,656 --> 01:45:35,611
If I lose, I'll be free.

932
01:45:39,329 --> 01:45:42,663
This is in your hands.
Bring my Ganga.

933
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:46,803
I won't live without
her! I can't!

934
01:45:47,071 --> 01:45:49,026
Bring my Ganga!

935
01:45:55,695 --> 01:45:57,612
You're crying?

936
01:45:58,953 --> 01:46:02,403
All his life, your uncle
could not be a good man.

937
01:46:04,204 --> 01:46:07,041
Maybe he can be Bhagirath
for you.

938
01:46:08,037 --> 01:46:11,027
I'll go and bring your Ganga!

939
01:46:35,404 --> 01:46:37,320
This bus will go to Rishikesh.

940
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:40,463
Get off and ask anyone
the way to the station.

941
01:46:40,847 --> 01:46:43,990
Buy a ticket and
sit in the train.

942
01:46:44,296 --> 01:46:48,934
I've kept the address and
the photo in this pouch.

943
01:46:51,004 --> 01:46:52,077
Take care.

944
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:54,798
Sit in the bus.

945
01:46:56,830 --> 01:46:58,823
You had no palanquin.

946
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:02,617
Take your son to his father
before your bier is carried.

947
01:47:55,473 --> 01:47:56,814
You've sent off your daughter.

948
01:47:57,466 --> 01:48:00,264
Instead of feeling happy,
you're feeling disheartened.

949
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:05,745
I'm praying that Ganga's son
gets his father's name.

950
01:48:06,473 --> 01:48:08,390
And doesn't die maligned.

951
01:48:09,655 --> 01:48:14,062
Excuse me, where does
the post man live?

952
01:48:15,097 --> 01:48:17,972
I'm the postman but I
don't recognise you.

953
01:48:21,383 --> 01:48:22,725
I'm Naren's uncle.

954
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,822
I've come to take Ganga.
He asked me to meet you.

955
01:48:28,781 --> 01:48:31,349
Like letters to mountains
you too are late.

956
01:48:31,924 --> 01:48:33,878
Ganga has left. - Where?

957
01:48:36,791 --> 01:48:38,056
Yes, she has taken Naren's son...

958
01:48:38,133 --> 01:48:41,238
...and gone to look for
him in Calcutta.

959
01:48:44,151 --> 01:48:47,217
Naren's son! What
are you saying?

960
01:48:47,754 --> 01:48:50,130
Yes sir. Our girls are poor.

961
01:48:50,513 --> 01:48:53,503
Without asking for it, they
give everything to strangers.

962
01:48:55,841 --> 01:48:59,252
Wasn't it better she left
rather than listen to abuse?

963
01:49:00,709 --> 01:49:02,932
- When did she leave?
- By the afternoon bus.

964
01:49:03,008 --> 01:49:06,381
She wouldn't have reached
Rishikesh. I'll catch her on the way.

965
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:07,723
But how will you recognise her?

966
01:49:09,256 --> 01:49:11,249
Who knows his choice
better than me?

967
01:49:11,632 --> 01:49:13,855
She must be one in a million.
I'll know her all right.

968
01:49:15,734 --> 01:49:16,807
Let's go.

969
01:49:34,208 --> 01:49:39,689
Do you have a girl called Ganga in
your bus? - Well... I wish to know...

970
01:49:41,951 --> 01:49:45,400
Is anyone among
you called Ganga?

971
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:49,923
Anybody...? - No, none.

972
01:49:51,839 --> 01:49:55,059
- There's nobody sir.
- Thanks a lot.

973
01:50:12,499 --> 01:50:13,840
Sit...

974
01:50:13,917 --> 01:50:17,213
Sir, my baby is starving...

975
01:50:25,032 --> 01:50:28,558
Sister, where's
Calcutta station?

976
01:50:30,781 --> 01:50:33,043
I mean I have to go to Calcutta.

977
01:50:34,039 --> 01:50:36,224
Can you tell me where
the station is?

978
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:42,548
Are you alone?

979
01:50:47,416 --> 01:50:49,831
It's quite close. I'll
drop you there.

980
01:50:51,211 --> 01:50:55,580
It's growing dark. Come with me.

981
01:50:58,340 --> 01:51:00,831
- Is this your bundle?
- Yes. - Here you are.

982
01:51:14,285 --> 01:51:15,473
Come on.

983
01:51:20,034 --> 01:51:21,874
Come on. Don't be scared.

984
01:51:40,118 --> 01:51:43,070
Has this bus come from
Gangotri? - Yes, this is the one.

985
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:48,052
- Conductor! - Yes? -
Have you seen Ganga?

986
01:51:48,167 --> 01:51:53,074
- Who hasn't seen it? - I
mean a girl called Ganga.

987
01:51:53,533 --> 01:51:57,711
Little baby, pretty girl,
One in million.

988
01:51:57,750 --> 01:52:00,701
Yes, there was a
girl in the bus.

989
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:03,384
But I don't know
where she's gone.

990
01:52:05,185 --> 01:52:08,022
I know where she must have
gone! Driver, come on!

991
01:52:13,694 --> 01:52:15,841
- How much did you get?
- Rupees 7 and 10 paise.

992
01:52:15,918 --> 01:52:21,782
Give. Rascals come here to
atone and are ashamed to give alms!

993
01:52:21,859 --> 01:52:23,200
Give!

994
01:52:25,768 --> 01:52:27,033
Go and sit with her!

995
01:52:37,612 --> 01:52:39,950
Wait here. I'll tell
mother and return.

996
01:52:45,661 --> 01:52:49,494
- Mother! - Bitch! It's turned
dark and now you return!

997
01:52:49,570 --> 01:52:52,560
- Will your Pop give accounts?
- Talk softly.

998
01:52:53,058 --> 01:52:55,320
Take... I got 40 bucks today.

999
01:52:55,818 --> 01:52:58,309
Good. Good catch.

1000
01:53:00,111 --> 01:53:03,407
- I've got better earnings.
- Where?

1001
01:53:04,059 --> 01:53:06,627
Standing outside. Come with me.

1002
01:53:14,484 --> 01:53:16,515
Very pretty. Cute girl.

1003
01:53:18,317 --> 01:53:20,233
Cute baby too. Is it yours?

1004
01:53:23,185 --> 01:53:26,749
- Shop earning? - What
does that mean?

1005
01:53:28,052 --> 01:53:31,694
You've got a child and
you don't understand?

1006
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:33,687
Come in, I'll explain.

1007
01:53:35,067 --> 01:53:36,293
Careful.

1008
01:53:40,854 --> 01:53:42,694
Take a seat.

1009
01:53:42,771 --> 01:53:45,569
Give me the bundle. - No...!

1010
01:53:45,645 --> 01:53:49,555
Take it in. Take the child.

1011
01:53:49,977 --> 01:53:54,538
- No rented child for her.
- Give the child.

1012
01:53:54,576 --> 01:53:56,761
Give my bundle. I have
to go to the station!

1013
01:53:57,144 --> 01:54:00,517
- Give my bundle! I must
go! - You may go.

1014
01:54:01,552 --> 01:54:03,468
First get yourself marked.

1015
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:07,148
What will she get?

1016
01:54:12,476 --> 01:54:16,845
- Anybody will pay 30-40.
- I'll pay 50 right away!

1017
01:54:17,305 --> 01:54:19,451
Well done! Go with him!

1018
01:54:19,528 --> 01:54:23,054
I won't go anywhere! I want
to go to the station!

1019
01:54:23,476 --> 01:54:24,894
Don't touch me!

1020
01:54:24,971 --> 01:54:28,075
Go with him! Making a fuss!

1021
01:54:30,222 --> 01:54:31,602
Let go!

1022
01:54:32,828 --> 01:54:34,438
I've paid so I must get
my worth! Come on!

1023
01:54:34,476 --> 01:54:40,647
- Save me somebody!
- Paid 2000 for her...

1024
01:54:40,686 --> 01:54:43,675
Refuses to sit. What are
you watching? Get her!

1025
01:55:49,754 --> 01:55:51,096
No!

1026
01:55:51,556 --> 01:55:53,012
Don't be scared.

1027
01:55:55,082 --> 01:55:56,385
Who are you?

1028
01:56:03,169 --> 01:56:05,622
The cemetery lies at the
shore of the Ganga.

1029
01:56:06,121 --> 01:56:09,647
What is Ganga doing
in the cemetery?

1030
01:56:10,912 --> 01:56:12,828
Father, I want to spend
the night here.

1031
01:56:13,212 --> 01:56:16,240
Even relatives of the deceased
don't stay all night.

1032
01:56:17,428 --> 01:56:20,034
Had I not been of a low caste,
I'd have taken you home.

1033
01:56:20,341 --> 01:56:25,132
I'll stay here. - As you wish.

1034
01:56:25,707 --> 01:56:27,010
You won't be scared?

1035
01:56:27,662 --> 01:56:31,801
I fear living humans. Why
should I fear the dead?

1036
01:56:34,829 --> 01:56:38,355
This corpse will burn all
night. Warm yourself by it.

1037
01:56:38,432 --> 01:56:39,927
It is very cold.

1038
01:57:15,764 --> 01:57:17,719
Priest, I want to
go to Calcutta.

1039
01:57:18,371 --> 01:57:22,625
- Where is the station?
- I could tell you child.

1040
01:57:23,162 --> 01:57:24,542
There's just one problem.

1041
01:57:25,078 --> 01:57:28,873
Unless I finish the prayers
I can't talk to anyone.

1042
01:57:29,333 --> 01:57:32,246
Come to my house. We'll
leave from there.

1043
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:37,995
Come in. Go and sit on that bed.

1044
01:57:38,532 --> 01:57:42,441
I'll show you the way after
I finish my ablutions.

1045
01:57:42,863 --> 01:57:44,856
It's not very far off.

1046
01:57:48,995 --> 01:57:51,257
Why... did you shut the door?

1047
01:57:51,947 --> 01:57:54,438
If it's open, it disturbs
my prayers.

1048
01:57:56,163 --> 01:57:57,236
Come.

1049
01:57:59,038 --> 01:58:01,031
Let go! Leave my hand!

1050
01:58:01,107 --> 01:58:03,062
You were to show me the
path to the station!

1051
01:58:07,317 --> 01:58:08,505
Let go!

1052
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:09,655
Let me go!

1053
01:58:22,955 --> 01:58:24,948
Child, nothing wrong in it.

1054
01:58:25,983 --> 01:58:28,282
Open the door! - Let me go!

1055
01:58:29,816 --> 01:58:32,269
- Who is it? - Police!
Open the door.

1056
01:58:41,774 --> 01:58:42,962
What was going on?

1057
01:58:43,231 --> 01:58:46,182
Yes, you priest? What
were you doing?

1058
01:58:48,022 --> 01:58:49,363
Listen...

1059
01:58:53,273 --> 01:58:55,113
Hiding here? Get up!

1060
01:58:57,642 --> 01:59:01,322
Is that your child? Take it and
come to the police station.

1061
01:59:01,399 --> 01:59:03,430
Give your statement about
this rascal over there.

1062
01:59:14,392 --> 01:59:16,538
Did this rascal force
you to come home?

1063
01:59:22,364 --> 01:59:24,473
No, I went on my own.

1064
01:59:24,856 --> 01:59:29,264
Fat lady, why did you tell me
that he took her by force?

1065
01:59:30,222 --> 01:59:34,400
How could I bear to see my
husband with another girl?

1066
01:59:34,706 --> 01:59:37,581
All right. Hear me carefully.

1067
01:59:38,309 --> 01:59:43,522
Next time you do this, I'll
lock you up forever!

1068
01:59:44,059 --> 01:59:45,898
You may leave. You too.

1069
01:59:51,648 --> 01:59:53,564
You want to go to Calcutta?

1070
01:59:55,174 --> 01:59:56,439
Do you have money
for the ticket?

1071
02:00:02,648 --> 02:00:04,756
Buy her a ticket to Calcutta
and put her in.

1072
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:18,056
Look sister, nobody
likes me coming home.

1073
02:00:19,934 --> 02:00:21,813
Nor is my name attached
to your family.

1074
02:00:23,307 --> 02:00:27,715
Yet I feel it's my duty
to at least inform you.

1075
02:00:28,098 --> 02:00:33,005
This is destruction! Naren's
Dad will never agree!

1076
02:00:34,921 --> 02:00:40,670
If you cancel this marriage,
Chaudhary will put us on the road!

1077
02:00:41,015 --> 02:00:43,047
Nobody will give us alms!

1078
02:00:43,890 --> 02:00:46,726
That is why let Naren
marry Radha.

1079
02:00:46,765 --> 02:00:49,448
I beg you! I fall at your feet!

1080
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:54,277
Save us! Say anything
to assure Naren.

1081
02:00:54,315 --> 02:00:56,960
But save us!

1082
02:01:00,218 --> 02:01:01,598
Uncle!

1083
02:01:06,466 --> 02:01:09,762
Uncle! - Come, Naren...

1084
02:01:11,793 --> 02:01:13,710
I got the news and came running!

1085
02:01:17,926 --> 02:01:19,766
Come and sit.

1086
02:01:21,069 --> 02:01:24,250
Later. First tell
me where is Ganga?

1087
02:01:27,968 --> 02:01:29,808
I found nothing about her.

1088
02:01:32,836 --> 02:01:35,519
Meaning? - I searched for her.

1089
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:38,317
Made inquiries.

1090
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:41,843
But I didn't find her.

1091
02:01:43,453 --> 02:01:48,934
Her brother died so she
left the village one day.

1092
02:01:54,377 --> 02:01:56,868
I don't believe this. I don't.

1093
02:02:01,008 --> 02:02:04,227
Ganga can't leave
me and go anywhere.

1094
02:02:05,377 --> 02:02:07,409
I swear she is not
in the village!

1095
02:02:10,666 --> 02:02:14,691
She had already turned crazy
with your memories.

1096
02:02:17,757 --> 02:02:21,399
Somebody said she went absolutely
mad when her brother died.

1097
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:28,451
Some even said, maybe
she's no more...

1098
02:02:33,625 --> 02:02:35,504
No uncle!

1099
02:02:37,458 --> 02:02:40,908
My life can't go away from me

1100
02:02:45,737 --> 02:02:48,919
I can believe that Ganga
could be misled.

1101
02:02:51,142 --> 02:02:52,752
But she can't be angry with me!

1102
02:02:53,786 --> 02:02:56,891
Never! It can never happen!

1103
02:02:59,804 --> 02:03:01,682
Stop crying!

1104
02:03:24,028 --> 02:03:25,293
Forgive me.

1105
02:03:38,746 --> 02:03:41,276
Without fodder even an
animal won't give milk.

1106
02:03:41,659 --> 02:03:43,997
Feed the child some water
when a station comes.

1107
02:03:47,945 --> 02:03:50,858
This contains water from the
Ganga for my death bed.

1108
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:52,468
I'd give it if it was normal.

1109
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:57,527
My darling... my sweetheart...

1110
02:03:57,987 --> 02:04:00,134
...is hungry.

1111
02:04:02,778 --> 02:04:09,524
From where the bring the milk...
the breasts are dry.

1112
02:04:12,552 --> 02:04:17,458
With tears in my eyes.

1113
02:04:17,535 --> 02:04:22,326
How to console him?

1114
02:04:22,403 --> 02:04:31,103
If possible, go to sleep, dear.

1115
02:04:56,822 --> 02:04:58,777
A station has come.
Feed him some water.

1116
02:05:15,527 --> 02:05:17,711
- Where can I get some
water? - There.

1117
02:05:57,228 --> 02:06:00,870
This... stop the train!

1118
02:06:01,905 --> 02:06:05,277
Stop the train! Stop!

1119
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:14,246
Girl! Don't run!

1120
02:06:15,895 --> 02:06:17,773
Leave the bars!

1121
02:06:21,261 --> 02:06:23,829
You'll fall with the child!
Both of you will die!

1122
02:06:28,965 --> 02:06:30,230
I missed my train!

1123
02:06:33,411 --> 02:06:35,327
If you're alive, you
can get anything.

1124
02:06:36,554 --> 02:06:39,505
If the station exists many
trains will come by.

1125
02:06:40,387 --> 02:06:43,645
What can I tell you?
I lost my family.

1126
02:06:43,990 --> 02:06:45,906
His address got stolen!

1127
02:06:46,596 --> 02:06:49,011
This was the last resort
to reach him!

1128
02:06:49,586 --> 02:06:52,882
- That too deserted me! - But
where do you have to go?

1129
02:06:55,603 --> 02:06:57,711
Father, can you take me there?

1130
02:06:58,363 --> 02:07:01,544
I'm blind. I may not be
able to see the path.

1131
02:07:03,882 --> 02:07:07,792
But I will definitely take
you to your destination.

1132
02:07:39,375 --> 02:07:40,563
Take the next right.

1133
02:07:41,291 --> 02:07:44,243
You... - I'm not blind.

1134
02:07:45,354 --> 02:07:46,964
The glasses...?

1135
02:07:47,041 --> 02:07:50,145
To frisk diamonds like you from
the eyes of the sighted.

1136
02:07:51,908 --> 02:07:53,671
I have to act blind.

1137
02:08:13,832 --> 02:08:16,171
Come along. Don't be scared.

1138
02:08:25,331 --> 02:08:28,627
Welcome. Where have you been?

1139
02:08:29,164 --> 02:08:34,377
You totally forget us. And
who is this with you?

1140
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:40,624
Manilal has brought a
priceless jewel today.

1141
02:08:41,238 --> 02:08:43,806
Hear her voice filled with pain.

1142
02:08:44,151 --> 02:08:45,415
It will pierce through
your heart.

1143
02:08:46,450 --> 02:08:48,290
Has she learnt singing?

1144
02:08:48,367 --> 02:08:54,039
The Goddess Herself
resides in her songs.

1145
02:09:06,765 --> 02:09:09,639
Saraswati in her voice,
Urvashi-like face...

1146
02:09:10,789 --> 02:09:12,514
Goddess Laxmi will
kiss your feet.

1147
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:15,734
Just learn to dance.

1148
02:09:16,615 --> 02:09:19,298
Destiny has made me dance.

1149
02:09:20,448 --> 02:09:23,399
I beg you, don't ruin me!

1150
02:09:24,281 --> 02:09:26,274
Don't kill my child alive!

1151
02:09:28,190 --> 02:09:29,455
Let me leave!

1152
02:09:30,107 --> 02:09:31,372
Let me leave!

1153
02:09:31,448 --> 02:09:33,288
I will not stay here.

1154
02:09:33,365 --> 02:09:35,205
Do you want to leave?

1155
02:09:35,818 --> 02:09:37,159
I won't stop you.

1156
02:09:38,539 --> 02:09:43,215
But hear this, woman comes to
a brothel when she is ditched.

1157
02:09:45,438 --> 02:09:49,233
Go one step down and
you'll find Chakla.

1158
02:09:50,651 --> 02:09:52,721
Do you know what that is?

1159
02:09:53,449 --> 02:09:56,400
A woman's body is shredded
worse than a mattress.

1160
02:09:57,282 --> 02:09:59,697
You might know who fathered
this child.

1161
02:10:01,690 --> 02:10:02,993
Even God Himself won't be able...

1162
02:10:03,031 --> 02:10:06,174
...to tell you who fathered
your child!

1163
02:10:08,091 --> 02:10:10,007
I'll be ruined here too.

1164
02:10:10,659 --> 02:10:13,189
I want to take my child
to his father.

1165
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:17,826
But where? How can you find
him without any address?

1166
02:10:18,823 --> 02:10:22,157
Outside you'll wander and be
kicked from door to door.

1167
02:10:22,464 --> 02:10:25,530
Every man will want
to tear you apart.

1168
02:10:26,067 --> 02:10:28,558
And this place is maligned.

1169
02:10:29,517 --> 02:10:33,043
No sin is committed here.
No trade of humans.

1170
02:10:34,231 --> 02:10:36,148
Only wounded hearts come here.

1171
02:10:36,876 --> 02:10:38,792
They leave with some balm.

1172
02:10:40,019 --> 02:10:42,625
Manilal says your
voice is magical.

1173
02:10:43,315 --> 02:10:45,653
We don't lack in admirers.

1174
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:51,019
Earn some money. Your son won't
get his father's support.

1175
02:10:51,901 --> 02:10:55,274
But he'll be supported by
his mother's sacrifice.

1176
02:11:35,519 --> 02:11:39,927
Arrange for her stay. I'm
going to the temple.

1177
02:11:45,983 --> 02:11:48,014
- Is the room upstairs
vacant? - Yes.

1178
02:11:48,857 --> 02:11:50,774
Arrange for her to stay there.

1179
02:11:53,304 --> 02:11:56,523
Ganga will stay here.

1180
02:12:03,384 --> 02:12:06,910
Father, the way you misled
and brought me here.

1181
02:12:07,868 --> 02:12:09,785
Don't show that path to another.

1182
02:12:11,011 --> 02:12:14,576
Else people won't ever
trust the blind.

1183
02:12:18,677 --> 02:12:22,242
Your Ganga touches your
hermitage and enters the sea.

1184
02:12:23,545 --> 02:12:24,810
Why did you push my
Ganga in the sea...

1185
02:12:24,887 --> 02:12:27,340
...of death without meeting me?

1186
02:12:31,211 --> 02:12:34,009
You only travel from home
to the hermitage.

1187
02:12:34,469 --> 02:12:35,925
Mr. Chaudhary is
here to see you.

1188
02:12:36,002 --> 02:12:39,835
I'm going to Benares for a
meeting. I'll return in 2-3 days.

1189
02:12:40,793 --> 02:12:42,403
Radha has given her list.

1190
02:12:44,511 --> 02:12:45,852
Do you want anything from there?

1191
02:12:47,845 --> 02:12:50,260
Bring Ganga if you
find her somewhere

1192
02:12:52,637 --> 02:12:57,504
I would but unfortunately Ganga
also flows in Calcutta.

1193
02:12:58,616 --> 02:13:01,337
Let's go Jeeva. I'll
get him something.

1194
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:11,724
Your belonging.

1195
02:13:12,261 --> 02:13:15,902
Your remembrance.

1196
02:13:18,010 --> 02:13:23,568
I carry along.

1197
02:13:24,871 --> 02:13:29,471
Like a crazy person

1198
02:13:30,467 --> 02:13:34,760
O the one who has forgotten me.

1199
02:13:35,335 --> 02:13:39,551
Come, at least sometime.

1200
02:13:41,084 --> 02:13:44,764
That you Ganga...

1201
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:50,513
...awaits you with
tears in her eyes.

1202
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:07,608
Who is that singing?

1203
02:14:08,336 --> 02:14:12,437
Are you joking? She's a novice,
absolutely raw.

1204
02:14:12,629 --> 02:14:15,465
We don't want to ruin our name.

1205
02:14:15,964 --> 02:14:17,842
If her voice is filled
with such pain...

1206
02:14:17,918 --> 02:14:19,835
...what must her face depict?

1207
02:14:19,911 --> 02:14:24,243
- Let's meet her.
- Definitely, sir.

1208
02:14:27,079 --> 02:14:28,420
Come here.

1209
02:14:31,372 --> 02:14:33,212
Sir is calling for you.

1210
02:14:44,825 --> 02:14:47,853
But, sir, her education
is still incomplete.

1211
02:14:48,543 --> 02:14:49,1000
She is learning the arts.

1212
02:14:50,421 --> 02:14:53,296
If she commits a blunder in
Chaudhary sir's presence...

1213
02:14:55,289 --> 02:14:57,742
Chaudhary's religion
maybe patriotism.

1214
02:14:58,394 --> 02:15:00,655
But his real life lies in this.

1215
02:15:01,997 --> 02:15:03,836
Why are you risking your life?

1216
02:15:03,913 --> 02:15:07,209
Spit your anger in a spittoon.

1217
02:15:08,321 --> 02:15:12,614
Ganga will adorn the party
in Chaudhary's honour.

1218
02:16:04,856 --> 02:16:07,232
Offer a betel leaf to Chaudhary.

1219
02:16:50,889 --> 02:16:53,610
Is she a virgin?

1220
02:16:57,021 --> 02:16:59,206
She has a child, sir.

1221
02:17:10,053 --> 02:17:14,691
The child of a prostitute
doesn't carry his father's name.

1222
02:17:17,182 --> 02:17:19,329
Nobody's child has his father's
name written on his forehead!

1223
02:17:20,479 --> 02:17:24,772
Bitch! Do you want to say our
mothers too were whores?

1224
02:17:25,270 --> 02:17:28,298
We don't frequent markets
with the sins of our flesh!

1225
02:17:32,437 --> 02:17:34,622
But sir you do sit
in the market!

1226
02:17:36,270 --> 02:17:40,678
Chamanlal, she has learnt
everything but manners.

1227
02:17:43,246 --> 02:17:47,424
Disrobe her before
she disrobes us.

1228
02:17:49,187 --> 02:17:53,480
That was Draupadi to save
whom Krishna appeared.

1229
02:17:58,616 --> 02:18:01,146
Nobody comes to a whore's aid!

1230
02:18:03,139 --> 02:18:05,937
I've gifted my shame
to my Mohan long ago.

1231
02:18:07,087 --> 02:18:09,156
Don't act coy under
the garb of clothes!

1232
02:18:11,341 --> 02:18:14,101
Scream, yell.

1233
02:18:15,097 --> 02:18:19,390
Else people will say Ganga
quietly became nude!

1234
02:18:44,917 --> 02:18:50,973
A troubled soul

1235
02:18:53,924 --> 02:19:02,088
Says this with tears in her eyes.

1236
02:19:02,548 --> 02:19:08,221
O Lord, you Ganga
has been sullied

1237
02:19:08,298 --> 02:19:12,552
While washing away the
sins of the sinners.

1238
02:19:37,964 --> 02:19:43,714
Had descended on earth...

1239
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:47,815
...with such pious waters.

1240
02:19:49,731 --> 02:19:55,634
But perverts,
short tempered ones...

1241
02:19:55,672 --> 02:19:59,582
...greedy and ignorant have
taken a dip in it.

1242
02:20:00,463 --> 02:20:06,289
It brought with it, waters
which was like pure nectar.

1243
02:20:06,366 --> 02:20:12,767
It carried life in its waters,
and supported one and all.

1244
02:20:13,074 --> 02:20:19,168
A river and a woman...

1245
02:20:22,081 --> 02:20:30,092
...both lead their lives, washing
away the dirt of other.

1246
02:20:30,666 --> 02:20:36,799
O Lord, your Ganga
has been sullied.

1247
02:20:36,876 --> 02:20:40,517
While washing away the
sins of the sinners.

1248
02:21:30,076 --> 02:21:36,094
The soul is the
one which is precious.

1249
02:21:36,132 --> 02:21:40,157
While the body is
just a covering.

1250
02:21:42,035 --> 02:21:47,784
Don't call the real
one as an illusion.

1251
02:21:47,861 --> 02:21:51,579
The covering can become dirty.

1252
02:21:52,690 --> 02:21:58,440
No one taunt her.
Rather she is worth worshipping.

1253
02:21:58,861 --> 02:22:01,813
She should be called
a Goddess and she should...

1254
02:22:01,889 --> 02:22:04,994
...be looked from the
eyes of the soul.

1255
02:22:05,569 --> 02:22:11,548
One should guard it.

1256
02:22:14,193 --> 02:22:22,318
One should guard this
valuable at all times.

1257
02:22:23,008 --> 02:22:28,949
O Lord, your Ganga
has been sullied.

1258
02:22:29,026 --> 02:22:33,319
While washing away
the sins of the sinner.

1259
02:23:11,149 --> 02:23:13,066
She's definitely
not professional.

1260
02:23:13,219 --> 02:23:17,627
This wounded girl has
wounded me today.

1261
02:23:18,317 --> 02:23:21,460
You are an admirer, a jeweler.

1262
02:23:22,610 --> 02:23:26,558
Tell Tajeshwaribai she can
take any sum from me.

1263
02:23:27,478 --> 02:23:29,394
I'll take her to Calcutta.

1264
02:23:29,854 --> 02:23:32,307
You will bring her
to my orchard.

1265
02:23:36,561 --> 02:23:40,318
What was the need for this? God
has blessed us with everything.

1266
02:23:41,353 --> 02:23:43,844
- Radha will reign over
it. - That's true.

1267
02:23:44,534 --> 02:23:47,562
I'll fulfill anything
that's left out.

1268
02:23:49,018 --> 02:23:54,729
You must. You condemn
dowry for the public.

1269
02:23:54,768 --> 02:23:57,911
But it's below the leader's
dignity to follow it.

1270
02:23:58,102 --> 02:24:00,134
Why did you call for me?

1271
02:24:02,012 --> 02:24:05,576
Don't be so harsh. Instead
help the girl's side.

1272
02:24:07,685 --> 02:24:09,103
I haven't seen as
many weddings...

1273
02:24:09,179 --> 02:24:11,019
...as many times you've
been married!

1274
02:24:12,054 --> 02:24:14,162
You'll arrange the music
for the wedding.

1275
02:24:16,768 --> 02:24:18,647
Then I'll have to go to Benares.

1276
02:24:18,685 --> 02:24:21,100
Because I belong to the
greatest lineage of Calcutta.

1277
02:24:21,176 --> 02:24:23,438
Is it? Then leave today itself.

1278
02:24:23,744 --> 02:24:25,661
But be here by that night.

1279
02:24:30,222 --> 02:24:33,327
You've landed up here too!
Still wriggling your way into homes

1280
02:24:37,351 --> 02:24:40,839
Even if a dog is bad,
he's still loyal.

1281
02:24:41,337 --> 02:24:42,602
But you're human!

1282
02:24:44,595 --> 02:24:46,435
Welcome.

1283
02:24:47,930 --> 02:24:49,310
Take a look.

1284
02:24:52,836 --> 02:24:54,446
Did you buy up all Benares?

1285
02:24:54,522 --> 02:24:59,237
This is nothing. Half of
Benares is in my orchard.

1286
02:25:01,153 --> 02:25:04,680
- What do you mean? - Tomorrow
my daughter will leave.

1287
02:25:06,136 --> 02:25:08,052
For whom will I live then?

1288
02:25:09,087 --> 02:25:10,429
Thought I'd get something
for myself...

1289
02:25:10,506 --> 02:25:12,575
...so what if she has a kid?

1290
02:25:13,304 --> 02:25:15,143
She'll entertain you too.

1291
02:25:15,220 --> 02:25:17,558
You too must take a look.

1292
02:25:31,088 --> 02:25:32,430
Let it be.

1293
02:25:33,081 --> 02:25:37,796
He's family. Tomorrow if not
today, you have to do this.

1294
02:25:38,486 --> 02:25:42,012
Did you think the same when
you were being nursed?

1295
02:25:59,873 --> 02:26:02,633
Why? Aren't you amazed?

1296
02:26:03,706 --> 02:26:05,354
I had the same reaction.

1297
02:26:06,044 --> 02:26:10,797
I didn't buy her for nothing.
We'll share her.

1298
02:26:11,793 --> 02:26:15,243
Let's get the marriage done.
She's the Ganga at home.

1299
02:26:16,163 --> 02:26:18,118
We'll take a dip when
we feel like.

1300
02:26:19,497 --> 02:26:21,337
Right?

1301
02:26:30,613 --> 02:26:32,223
Did you hear that?

1302
02:26:32,529 --> 02:26:36,362
Tajeshwaribai said they
don't trade in humans.

1303
02:26:37,205 --> 02:26:39,237
Then why did she send me here?

1304
02:26:42,495 --> 02:26:45,331
I swear by my son...

1305
02:26:45,369 --> 02:26:48,512
Each time I see you,
I curse you!

1306
02:26:49,202 --> 02:26:51,387
A woman's curse
can destroy iron.

1307
02:26:52,115 --> 02:26:56,983
But you are human. I fear
my curse may ruin you.

1308
02:26:58,286 --> 02:27:03,997
Go away from here!

1309
02:27:39,298 --> 02:27:40,870
Can't you see where you walk?

1310
02:27:43,821 --> 02:27:46,964
- You...? - I was going
to Benares to meet you.

1311
02:27:47,079 --> 02:27:50,452
What are you doing here?
And tell me the truth.

1312
02:27:50,988 --> 02:27:53,020
Are you going on a hunt
or back from a hunt?

1313
02:27:53,940 --> 02:27:55,895
I no longer do that.

1314
02:27:57,658 --> 02:28:00,379
Misleading women, I finally
came on the right track.

1315
02:28:01,529 --> 02:28:05,323
I've decided never to walk
on this sinful path.

1316
02:28:06,780 --> 02:28:09,271
Maybe poor Ganga
might forgive me.

1317
02:28:11,571 --> 02:28:14,561
- Which Ganga? - A
poor mountain girl.

1318
02:28:14,906 --> 02:28:18,547
She's come from Gangotri.
Wandering with her son.

1319
02:28:18,854 --> 02:28:22,073
The child's father
lives in Calcutta.

1320
02:28:23,683 --> 02:28:27,439
Don't say another word.
Take me to her!

1321
02:28:29,087 --> 02:28:30,697
Do you know what you've done?

1322
02:28:30,774 --> 02:28:33,265
The one you brought from
Benares is a fire not a spark!

1323
02:28:34,223 --> 02:28:38,861
You are not able to see it but
I can see the destruction.

1324
02:28:39,398 --> 02:28:40,624
What are you saying?

1325
02:28:41,889 --> 02:28:43,806
Look at this.

1326
02:28:50,207 --> 02:28:53,081
This is the same girl for
whom Naren ran away.

1327
02:28:54,729 --> 02:28:55,956
How did this happen?

1328
02:28:56,071 --> 02:29:00,440
If Naren finds out this girl is
in your house not the hills...

1329
02:29:00,517 --> 02:29:02,280
What will be the outcome?

1330
02:29:06,765 --> 02:29:08,029
That can never happen.

1331
02:29:24,051 --> 02:29:26,734
I'm Kunj, Naren's uncle.

1332
02:29:36,508 --> 02:29:39,996
Do you know Naren?

1333
02:29:40,724 --> 02:29:44,174
You know him? Take me to him!

1334
02:29:44,825 --> 02:29:48,888
Take me to him just once.
I beg you...!

1335
02:29:49,348 --> 02:29:52,491
Take me to him once!

1336
02:29:53,181 --> 02:29:55,672
I went to your village for you.

1337
02:29:57,014 --> 02:29:59,122
I searched for you everywhere
but I couldn't find you.

1338
02:30:00,272 --> 02:30:01,690
And now that I've found you...

1339
02:30:04,066 --> 02:30:06,021
Luck has changed.

1340
02:30:08,091 --> 02:30:11,272
I forced Naren to marry another.

1341
02:30:12,307 --> 02:30:15,182
By lying that you're dead.

1342
02:30:17,558 --> 02:30:21,046
I died the day I sat
in the market.

1343
02:30:22,272 --> 02:30:26,642
I'm carrying my dead body
to give him his son.

1344
02:30:27,677 --> 02:30:29,823
Take me to him just once!

1345
02:30:30,092 --> 02:30:33,005
Then I'll go away
from here forever!

1346
02:30:33,426 --> 02:30:36,377
I can take you to him right now.

1347
02:30:37,489 --> 02:30:40,057
But the people who have made
you a prisoner of this city...

1348
02:30:40,134 --> 02:30:42,510
...bought you for
their debauchery...

1349
02:30:43,583 --> 02:30:45,346
Will they accept you as
the bride of their house?

1350
02:30:48,758 --> 02:30:53,012
And till Naren accepts you
in front of the world...

1351
02:30:53,817 --> 02:30:55,734
People will call your son names.

1352
02:30:56,385 --> 02:31:01,598
All this while you were being
tested. Now it's Ram's turn.

1353
02:31:12,215 --> 02:31:13,556
Chaudhary is calling you.

1354
02:31:18,424 --> 02:31:20,302
So late in the night?

1355
02:31:20,877 --> 02:31:22,832
Is all fine? - Where is Ganga?

1356
02:31:23,675 --> 02:31:27,317
- She's inside. Should I call
her? - Listen carefully.

1357
02:31:28,965 --> 02:31:31,456
You'll get the train to
Benares in half an hour.

1358
02:31:32,836 --> 02:31:35,289
Immediately take her
to Tajeshwaribai.

1359
02:31:37,550 --> 02:31:38,815
Take this.

1360
02:31:39,543 --> 02:31:41,383
Now if this girl is seen
within Calcutta...

1361
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:43,606
I'll have both of you hacked!

1362
02:31:46,366 --> 02:31:48,397
Take her and leave right now.

1363
02:31:49,126 --> 02:31:50,965
Understood? Take this.

1364
02:31:57,711 --> 02:31:59,551
Let's go.

1365
02:32:05,377 --> 02:32:09,632
Got it but the Ganga doesn't
flow backwards.

1366
02:32:12,085 --> 02:32:16,799
Ganga has never returned from
Calcutta to Benares nor will she!

1367
02:32:17,949 --> 02:32:22,127
I won't get married! At
the most, you'll kill me!

1368
02:32:22,203 --> 02:32:25,768
Then kill me! But I
won't get married!

1369
02:32:27,033 --> 02:32:28,336
Please leave.

1370
02:32:32,782 --> 02:32:36,500
You've made up your mind that
you won't get married.

1371
02:32:37,420 --> 02:32:41,905
You want to live for a girl
who is not in this world?

1372
02:32:42,786 --> 02:32:44,626
Mother, you...!

1373
02:32:47,577 --> 02:32:50,950
I don't know everything but
I know a little about Ganga.

1374
02:32:52,292 --> 02:32:54,208
But understand one
thing, my son.

1375
02:32:54,591 --> 02:32:58,616
If you don't get married, 2
biers will leave this house.

1376
02:32:59,957 --> 02:33:03,100
Your father's and mine!

1377
02:33:07,278 --> 02:33:11,724
An old saying comes to mind.
The groom comes for the bride.

1378
02:33:12,453 --> 02:33:14,292
The parents to meet each other.

1379
02:33:14,369 --> 02:33:18,624
But the guests come for
good music and dance.

1380
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:23,875
I've asked Kunjbihari do organise
this. He must be on his way.

1381
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:40,816
Welcome Kunj.

1382
02:33:41,238 --> 02:33:44,611
Everybody is complaining about
you. You're quite late.

1383
02:33:45,070 --> 02:33:48,175
I've come early so
it's not too late.

1384
02:33:48,827 --> 02:33:51,011
It's Radha's wedding.

1385
02:33:52,276 --> 02:33:56,952
I had to find Meera for
this musical night.

1386
02:33:57,451 --> 02:33:59,329
Now we'll see whether Mohan...

1387
02:33:59,367 --> 02:34:02,510
...is bound by Radha's
marriage flowers.

1388
02:34:03,468 --> 02:34:05,385
Or a lost Meera's song.

1389
02:34:19,145 --> 02:34:27,616
Radha and Meera...

1390
02:34:28,727 --> 02:34:36,738
Both loved Krisha.

1391
02:34:36,929 --> 02:34:44,710
But what is the difference
between their love.

1392
02:34:51,111 --> 02:34:56,285
One was emotional,
the other devotional.

1393
02:35:36,454 --> 02:35:41,897
Radha searched him
in the Madhuban.

1394
02:35:41,935 --> 02:35:46,190
But Meera met him
in her inner self.

1395
02:35:47,723 --> 02:35:53,012
The Govind whom Radha lost...

1396
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:57,880
Was available to Meera,
whenever she wished.

1397
02:35:58,263 --> 02:36:03,553
One side was the flute...
and anklet on the other.

1398
02:36:04,013 --> 02:36:09,302
One was a madcap one was wounded.

1399
02:36:09,762 --> 02:36:15,013
What was the difference?

1400
02:36:20,839 --> 02:36:26,013
One loved the person,
the other his image.

1401
02:36:31,839 --> 02:36:37,819
One was emotional,
the other decotioal.

1402
02:36:44,181 --> 02:36:49,471
Meera loved him as
Giridhar Nagar, the saviour.

1403
02:36:49,547 --> 02:36:53,418
While Radha loved
him as a companion.

1404
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:29,256
Radha decked up
for him, everyday.

1405
02:37:29,294 --> 02:37:33,702
While Meera turned
in as ascetic.

1406
02:37:34,124 --> 02:37:39,413
One was the queen, another
surrendered just like a maid.

1407
02:37:39,796 --> 02:37:45,162
Both craved for Hari's love.

1408
02:37:45,546 --> 02:37:51,257
What was the difference
between their contentment?

1409
02:37:56,699 --> 02:38:02,104
One never won, another
never gave up.

1410
02:39:21,406 --> 02:39:23,591
Your Ganga has been sullied.

1411
02:39:36,929 --> 02:39:41,721
Uncle? - Yes, I lied!

1412
02:39:43,024 --> 02:39:47,163
But won't you ask why?
Why did your uncle lie?

1413
02:39:48,198 --> 02:39:51,533
Ask your mother the reason!
She made me lie.

1414
02:39:52,989 --> 02:39:54,906
To stop the destruction
of her home.

1415
02:39:54,982 --> 02:40:01,115
...who wanted to ruin
the Sahai family!

1416
02:40:02,533 --> 02:40:05,714
- Ruin...? - Sister, tell
him that I'm lying!

1417
02:40:09,816 --> 02:40:11,157
Mother...?

1418
02:40:13,725 --> 02:40:15,642
But how does that affect you?

1419
02:40:16,485 --> 02:40:18,363
You are going to marry Radha.

1420
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:22,042
And your Ganga is a singing
dancing whore!

1421
02:40:22,732 --> 02:40:25,224
A woman with no character.
Somebody to be hated!

1422
02:40:26,949 --> 02:40:30,015
Home are adorned with things
bought from the market.

1423
02:40:30,398 --> 02:40:32,276
- They don't make a home.
- Quiet, uncle!

1424
02:40:33,235 --> 02:40:38,256
After hearing this, if you
still wish to have her...

1425
02:40:38,447 --> 02:40:44,657
Ask this white garbed Bhagwat
Chaudhary who made her a whore!

1426
02:40:45,691 --> 02:40:47,876
Why did he buy her from Benares
and bring her here?

1427
02:40:47,914 --> 02:40:51,556
Why did he keep her in his
orchard as his mistress?

1428
02:40:55,274 --> 02:40:59,681
Shame on you! You lust for a
girl the age of your daughter!

1429
02:41:01,483 --> 02:41:02,901
Radha is your daughter.

1430
02:41:03,208 --> 02:41:06,159
How would you feel somebody
treated her so?

1431
02:41:06,236 --> 02:41:07,692
Shameless! Curb your tongue!

1432
02:41:17,926 --> 02:41:20,456
Don't make the mistake
of raising your hand!

1433
02:41:21,644 --> 02:41:23,675
Or I won't maintain the
distance between our age.

1434
02:41:25,975 --> 02:41:27,815
The two penny promiscuous
woman...

1435
02:41:27,891 --> 02:41:30,306
...for whom you're
ready to beat me.

1436
02:41:31,648 --> 02:41:33,832
May I know how she is
related to my dreams?

1437
02:41:34,561 --> 02:41:36,400
Would you like to know?

1438
02:41:38,969 --> 02:41:41,690
Do you know who she is?
She is my Ganga!

1439
02:41:41,767 --> 02:41:44,373
She is the daughter-in-law
of the Sahai family!

1440
02:41:56,217 --> 02:41:58,440
Do you think I'll accept any
girl as my daughter-in-law for...

1441
02:41:58,516 --> 02:41:59,896
...your sake?

1442
02:42:00,433 --> 02:42:03,269
Don't. The one who had to
accept her has done it.

1443
02:42:03,307 --> 02:42:04,840
You don't matter.

1444
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:08,367
You scoundrel! It
won't matter to you

1445
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:14,116
You've had your revenge
for that day's fight!

1446
02:42:15,419 --> 02:42:18,601
You settled in a whore house
and you want my family too to...

1447
02:42:18,677 --> 02:42:20,134
...settle there!

1448
02:42:21,092 --> 02:42:23,085
Uncle only settled
in a brothel...

1449
02:42:23,737 --> 02:42:26,841
But you took my Ganga to a
brothel instead of home!

1450
02:42:27,225 --> 02:42:31,556
Cut the crap, I've seen
many such dramas in my life.

1451
02:42:32,284 --> 02:42:35,465
Throw this girl
out of the house!

1452
02:42:36,308 --> 02:42:38,340
Stop! - Stop it, Daddy.

1453
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:40,908
Stop it.

1454
02:42:42,211 --> 02:42:46,351
You can't snatch another's joys
and make your child happy.

1455
02:42:48,919 --> 02:42:53,212
If you'd get adopt a daughter,
I'd worship you all my life.

1456
02:42:54,093 --> 02:42:58,194
I'd even accept a step mother
if you needed a companion.

1457
02:42:59,152 --> 02:43:01,069
But... you're terrific Daddy!

1458
02:43:01,759 --> 02:43:04,250
On one hand you're giving your
daughter away in marriage.

1459
02:43:05,093 --> 02:43:07,776
And with the other, you turned a
married woman into a mistress!

1460
02:43:12,836 --> 02:43:17,359
Saw the outcome? Your daughter
became a widow without marriage!

1461
02:43:18,010 --> 02:43:19,927
Forgive me.

1462
02:43:25,676 --> 02:43:28,819
Don't ask any questions. I have
no proof of my honesty.

1463
02:43:29,777 --> 02:43:31,847
I'll only ask you
to leave with me.

1464
02:43:32,844 --> 02:43:35,833
We're not needed amidst
these reputed families.

1465
02:43:36,791 --> 02:43:39,628
We'll build our home where
the Ganga lives.

1466
02:43:40,509 --> 02:43:44,151
A singing dancing whore
looks good in brothels.

1467
02:43:45,109 --> 02:43:46,220
Not in homes.

1468
02:43:46,795 --> 02:43:49,287
I haven't come to
ruin your life.

1469
02:43:50,628 --> 02:43:52,775
I haven't come to ask
you for anything.

1470
02:43:53,503 --> 02:43:57,259
The aim of my life
is to give you...

1471
02:44:03,085 --> 02:44:07,340
Your son. Ganga can bear
thousands of abuses on herself...

1472
02:44:08,144 --> 02:44:11,632
But she can't bear to see
anyone point a finger at her son!

1473
02:44:12,667 --> 02:44:14,545
Accept this innocent...

1474
02:44:17,458 --> 02:44:18,685
My son!

1475
02:44:23,169 --> 02:44:24,358
Is this our child?

1476
02:44:27,960 --> 02:44:31,142
This is your grandson, father!
The lamp of the Sahai family!

1477
02:44:31,793 --> 02:44:35,895
She hasn't brought a stranger.
She came to give me my son.

1478
02:44:36,086 --> 02:44:38,463
Stop her! She's gone!

1479
02:44:44,863 --> 02:44:46,128
Stop!

1480
02:45:01,537 --> 02:45:02,725
Stop!

1481
02:45:05,868 --> 02:45:07,554
Shoot her dead!
- Stop, Ganga!

1482
02:45:41,130 --> 02:45:43,967
You killed Ganga! You
killed my Ganga!

1483
02:45:49,486 --> 02:45:50,866
What are you watching?
Shoot him.

1484
02:45:53,319 --> 02:45:55,197
Don't anyone dare
come between us!

1485
02:45:55,504 --> 02:45:57,612
Or he too will die with
Bhagwat Chaudhary!

1486
02:46:04,473 --> 02:46:07,002
Rascal! Scoundrel! Why
did you kill my Ganga?

1487
02:46:11,793 --> 02:46:14,361
Swine! You are polluted
not Ganga!

1488
02:46:14,438 --> 02:46:16,814
Men like you are filthy!

1489
02:46:18,654 --> 02:46:20,072
Answer me, you worm!

1490
02:46:22,027 --> 02:46:23,254
Filthy murderer!

1491
02:46:23,522 --> 02:46:26,128
I won't let you live!

1492
02:46:27,815 --> 02:46:29,655
It's best you die!

1493
02:46:29,731 --> 02:46:33,143
- I'll kill you! - Stop!
I say, stop!

1494
02:46:35,481 --> 02:46:37,320
Stop this madness!

1495
02:46:40,847 --> 02:46:42,763
Move out father.

1496
02:46:43,415 --> 02:46:46,251
Or the world will say a
son killed his father.

1497
02:46:46,596 --> 02:46:51,080
Don't do that. Ganga is alive.

1498
02:47:02,771 --> 02:47:05,454
I'm taking Ganga and my son
away from here, father.

1499
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:08,328
You can't give us life.

1500
02:47:09,632 --> 02:47:13,771
Give us death. Here,
pick up the gun.

1501
02:47:14,269 --> 02:47:17,872
Kill us and get rid of
the hatred within you!

1502
02:47:18,562 --> 02:47:20,747
Kill us, father! Kill us!

1503
02:47:37,765 --> 02:47:41,828
Let's go. We'll go
faraway from here.

1504
02:47:50,797 --> 02:47:52,062
You are the ocean.

1505
02:47:52,713 --> 02:47:54,323
And Ganga is the flow.

1506
02:47:55,971 --> 02:47:58,309
The Ganga is united
with the ocean.

1507
02:47:59,306 --> 02:48:01,989
She achieves salvation
when they unite.

1508
02:48:16,515 --> 02:48:18,854
Listen to what the Ganga says...

1509
02:48:19,045 --> 02:48:22,686
...that such great souls
have come to my shores.

1510
02:48:22,763 --> 02:48:25,983
Who believed in principles.

1511
02:48:26,021 --> 02:48:28,436
Of laying their lives...

1512
02:48:28,512 --> 02:48:32,614
...for their promises.

1513
02:48:32,805 --> 02:48:39,321
Our Ganga...

1514
02:48:41,966 --> 02:48:50,207
...thus narrates so with
tears in her eyes.

1515
02:48:50,590 --> 02:48:56,837
O Lord, your Ganga
has been sullied.

1516
02:48:56,914 --> 02:49:01,552
By washing away the
sins of the sinners.

1517
02:49:26,274 --> 02:49:31,257
We belong to that rare land.

1518
02:49:31,333 --> 02:49:36,163
In which the Ganga flows.

1519
02:49:38,463 --> 02:49:44,212
The one who resided
with the sages.

1520
02:49:44,289 --> 02:49:48,658
Also resides with the sinners.

1521
02:49:49,463 --> 02:49:55,212
No truth in thoughts and deeds.

1522
02:49:55,289 --> 02:50:01,115
They soil the Ganga and then
claim to be its saviours.

1523
02:50:14,147 --> 02:50:20,088
What can the poor one do?

1524
02:50:23,001 --> 02:50:31,548
What can the poor one do,
when she is betrayed by her own

1525
02:50:31,625 --> 02:50:37,489
O Lord, your Ganga
has been sullied.

1526
02:50:37,872 --> 02:50:42,280
By washing away the
sins of the sinners.
