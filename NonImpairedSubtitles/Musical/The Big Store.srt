1
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,807
See? That's the way to play it.

2
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:44,645
Someday, you all gonna be big musicians
just like me, but you gotta practice.

3
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,357
Not on this piano.

4
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,570
Hey, you can't take this piano.
She belongs to the professor.

5
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,698
- He's upstairs, sick.
- Go on, play something soft.

6
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,285
- You're breaking my heart. Come on, Joe.
- Hey, wait. Please, please.

7
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,204
My friend Tommy Rogers,
he's gonna be here right away.

8
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,415
He'll fix everything.

9
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,585
- Who's Tommy Rogers?
- You don't know Rogers, the singer?

10
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,795
- Never heard of him.
- You never heard of him?

11
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,092
Let me show you who's Tommy Rogers.
That's his picture. Look at what he say.

12
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,679
"The late Hiram Phelps wills half interest
in his department store...

13
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,390
...to his protégé, Tommy Rogers. "

14
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,142
You mean a guy like that
would come to a joint like this?

15
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,145
What do you mean, "joint"?
Tommy get his start right here.

16
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,688
- Hi, Ravelli.
- Hey, Tommy.

17
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,275
Where's the professor?
I brought that money for him.

18
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,735
- You see?
- Hey, what's going on around here?

19
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,530
I had orders to take this piano.
We thought the place was closing up.

20
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,827
Closing up? Why, I'm gonna tear this
place down and build a real conservatory.

21
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:46,874
- Now, what did I tell you? Conservatory.
- Excuse me, Mr. Rogers. Come on, Joe.

22
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,795
You hear that, kids? A new conservatory.

23
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,922
A new conservatory!

24
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,298
Hooray for Tommy!

25
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,553
I'll build a conservatory we'll be proud of,
stained-glass windows, a real auditorium...

26
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,805
...and we'll have soundproof
practice rooms.

27
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,182
That's fine. When do we start?

28
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,810
As soon as I sell my share
of the Phelps store.

29
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,853
- You gonna sell the store?
- Sure.

30
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,482
What do I know about department stores?
I'm a musician. That's my business.

31
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,152
I want kids like these to have
the same opportunity that I've had.

32
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,655
Hey, let's go upstairs
and tell the professor.

33
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,532
- Sure.
- Come on.

34
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,033
- See you later.
- So long.

35
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,786
- So long.
- Goodbye.

36
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,830
Now, you kids practice
till I come back.

37
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,584
But remember, no woogie-boogie.

38
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,443
Get working on those books, Sutton,
or we'll be in trouble.

39
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,029
- You think Rogers will sell, Mr. Grover?
- He'll try.

40
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,908
And if any real businessman
gets a look at our figures, we're sunk.

41
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,202
Get going on those books.
We haven't much time.

42
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,662
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

43
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,167
Can you trust that guy?

44
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,003
His sister works in the music department
and runs with Rogers.

45
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,754
- She won't run with him long.
- Why?

46
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,925
If Tommy Rogers disappears,
his share of the store reverts...

47
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,469
...to Martha Phelps, the old man's sister.

48
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,179
So what?

49
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,724
Well, there'll be a society wedding.
Martha will make a stunning bride...

50
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,435
...and I rather fancy myself
as a bridegroom.

51
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,855
- And complete owner of the Phelps store?
- Naturally.

52
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,859
Now, can you arrange
the necessary disappearance?

53
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,279
- I didn't bring Butch along for company.
- Yeah, I know what to do.

54
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,531
And make it look
like one of those accidents.

55
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:46,452
- Sure, boss. You know me.
- Now, don't bungle it. Get going.

56
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,547
- Will you keep a secret?
- Sure, even from me.

57
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,674
I think I found buyers for the store.

58
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,385
- Who and for how much?
- The price hasn't been settled...

59
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,179
...but it's the Hastings brothers,
the big store owners.

60
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,683
The deal looks pretty set.
Tell the professor to start looking at plans.

61
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,604
I better not leave you. From now on,
you and me is gonna be insufferable.

62
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,982
Hey, turn on the lights.
Turn on the lights.

63
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,402
Second floor.

64
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,406
- Oh, help.
- What happened?

65
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,702
Tommy, what happened?

66
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,746
- I don't know. Something happened.
- I didn't see nothing wrong.

67
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,541
The lights went off
and went right on again.

68
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,711
Tommy. Tommy.

69
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,673
Are you all right, Tommy?

70
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,424
I mean, Mr. Rogers.

71
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,932
Excuse me, just a minute, please.
Why, Mr. Rogers, what's the trouble?

72
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,185
Just a little bump.
Somebody's elbow, I guess.

73
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,812
- First the lights go out, then Tommy.
- Let me help.

74
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,691
- No, I'm all right.
- You'd better see your aunt right away.

75
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,778
- I want to see you a little later, Joan.
- Yes, sir.

76
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,113
Now come along with me.

77
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,785
Going down.

78
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,219
- Nobody tell me that was an accident.
- It's the work of a disgruntled employee.

79
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,722
I'm calling the police.
Call the police department.

80
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,808
Wait a minute. Aren't you
taking this a little too seriously?

81
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,312
No, if anything should happen to you,
I'd be the first one blamed.

82
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,731
Aunt Martha, you read
too many detective stories.

83
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,150
Tommy's right.
You're making too much of this.

84
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,990
- What's the matter, Ravelli?
- I see a very suspicious-looking man.

85
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,411
- Tommy, who is this person?
- I'm Ravelli. I'm Tommy's best friend.

86
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,163
Your best friends are the police.
I'll call them.

87
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,374
Don't you think that calling the police
might result in a lot of...

88
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,586
...well, undesirable publicity?
Remember the name of Phelps.

89
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,923
You're so right again.
You're always so right.

90
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,009
- Mr. Grover.
- I'll take it in my office.

91
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,097
- May I have the phone book?
- Yes.

92
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,307
Thank you.

93
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,030
<i>Exercise number four. </i>

94
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,701
<i>Come on, now. One, two. </i>
<i>Now stretch. </i>

95
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,871
<i>One, two. Now stretch. </i>

96
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:41,544
<i>And now, friends, stand on your head</i>
<i>with your back against the wall. This is... </i>

97
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,684
Wacky.

98
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,814
Take this paper out and sell it.
Never mind.

99
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,233
What about my egg?

100
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,027
Wacky, quick, a customer.

101
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,801
Winthrop, get me the district attorney.

102
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:16,847
Hello, DA? That's ridiculous, I've been
in constant touch with Scotland Yard.

103
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,900
Winthrop, get me Trinidad.

104
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,112
Hello, Dad, I won't be home for dinner.

105
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,280
- I came here to...
- Just a minute.

106
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,950
Winthrop, get me Gangbusters.

107
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,661
Hello, Gangbusters,
who caught the crook last night?

108
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,163
Sheriff Hawkins? Thank you.

109
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:46,461
Winthrop, get me Sheriff Hawkins.
Sheriff Hawkins, congratulations.

110
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:52,091
Well, madam... Take this down.
Go on, please.

111
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,843
I saw your name in the classified...

112
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,392
And I'm awfully worried about... .

113
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,275
...need your protection.

114
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,986
That's why I'm here.

115
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,365
This case is more baffling
than I thought. Tell it to me again.

116
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,202
I saw your name in the classified...

117
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,846
I know you're a very busy man,
but you must do something.

118
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,808
We need your protection.
That's why I'm here.

119
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,645
Fascinating. Now tell it to me in detail.

120
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,397
I saw your name...

121
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,275
Oh, dear!

122
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,777
Oh, my!

123
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,197
- Be careful.
- It's the new type-flying machine.

124
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,908
They're really not perfected yet.

125
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,243
Yes? As you were...?
As you were saying?

126
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,955
You've heard of Tommy Rogers,
who recently inherited...

127
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,999
...half the Phelps department store.
- Why, of course.

128
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,293
You must take this case.

129
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,926
Well, I'd like to help you,
but I'm just dripping with offers.

130
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,433
I don't even answer the phone.

131
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,441
- You'll pardon me?
- Of course.

132
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,449
Ten thousand dollars, ridiculous.
One would think I was starving.

133
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,909
- It's warm in here.
- It's funny, I don't feel it.

134
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,620
Well, I do.

135
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,790
Winthrop, have the janitor come up
and break a window.

136
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,379
- Things are certainly getting hot.
- Oh, they certainly are.

137
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,298
Miss Phelps, I'm turning down
all offers to take your case.

138
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,802
After all, you're a woman.
You are a woman, aren't you?

139
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,554
Tell me, what would you want
to handle this case for me?

140
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,433
- Twenty thousand dollars.
- Don't you think that's too much?

141
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,102
Of course. Only a cheap chiseler
would ask that much.

142
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:13,232
- I was prepared to pay $500.
- Oddly enough, I'm prepared to take it.

143
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,153
Shall we bind the deal with a kiss
or $5 in cash?

144
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,072
- You lose either way.
- There you are.

145
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,491
That's fine.

146
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,120
Now, let's get to the bottom of...
Let's get to the bottom of this, eh?

147
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,873
Now, tell me everything.

148
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,376
- As you were saying?
- Look, what's this?

149
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,839
Camouflage. A precaution
I must take for my life.

150
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,550
Every gangster in town
would like to do away with me...

151
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:43,054
...but we'll outwit them. We'll leave
under cover of my private smoke screen.

152
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,640
There goes my breakfast.

153
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,100
One more important thing, Mr. Flywheel.

154
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,562
Nobody at the store, not even Tommy,
must know that you're a detective.

155
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,275
You're safe. I've kept it a secret for years.

156
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,320
- This is a gift from a grateful client.
- Indeed? Well.

157
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,740
They hung him last year.

158
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:09,914
That's strange. I could have sworn
I shaved this morning.

159
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,753
- My car will be here in a moment.
- Nonsense. We'll take my car.

160
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,297
Speed is imperative.

161
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,470
- Quaint, isn't it?
- Demonstrator's model.

162
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,932
I've been trying to make up my mind
for years whether to buy this car or not.

163
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,648
My man will be along shortly.

164
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,108
Oh, my. Oh, dear.

165
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,445
I had that seat built below window level.
Makes me safe from bullets.

166
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,072
How ingenious.

167
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,034
- Take my seat. It's more comfortable.
- Thank you.

168
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,002
To the Phelps department store,
and make it snappy.

169
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,238
That settles it. I'm not buying this car.
Fix the door and take it back.

170
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,325
My veil. My veil. Oh, dear.

171
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,161
- Foreign cars are worthless.
- Oh, what a trip.

172
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,768
Hey, wait a minute,
you'll have to fix that door someplace...

173
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,520
...and get all this junk out of here.

174
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,526
What's going on here?

175
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,327
Yes, your work on these books
is okay for a sucker like Tommy...

176
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,831
...but it won't take the Hastings brothers
long to find out they've been juggled.

177
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,375
Now, we've gotta work fast.

178
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,127
Incidentally, your sister's
getting chummy with Tommy.

179
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,880
Joan doesn't know about this,
and she's not going to.

180
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,091
Now, I hope you're right.

181
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,804
If this falls through
on account of you or her... .

182
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,931
Well, it better not, that's all.

183
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,893
You better not let
the boss catch you around here.

184
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,396
That's all right.
The boss and I are like that.

185
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,566
- Tommy, I'm awfully busy.
- I'm here strictly on business.

186
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,818
I just came over to check
our recording sales.

187
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,071
If you mean your latest recording,
we sold the last one yesterday.

188
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,324
- How many does that make we've sold?
- Two.

189
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,202
A new high, huh?

190
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,578
Oh, pardon me.

191
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,081
Have you Tommy Rogers' latest record,
<i>If It's You</i>?

192
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,085
Sorry, we're completely sold out,
but we're expecting some in any minute.

193
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,587
We have the sheet music here.

194
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,468
Why, you're Mr. Rogers.

195
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,306
Yes. You see, every Friday is celebrity day.

196
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,644
Oh, Mr. Rogers, I wanted
one of your records.

197
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,439
Madam, I'd be more than happy
to make one for you personally.

198
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:26,068
- Lf you'd just step around the counter.
- Thank you.

199
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,735
With our compliments.

200
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,154
Thank you.

201
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,448
Thank you.

202
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,243
Oh, that was swell.

203
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,914
Just think, one of the toughest
kids in our neighborhood...

204
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,458
...turning out to be the great
Tommy Rogers.

205
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,670
What's great about a fella that's written
songs and leads a corny little band?

206
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,841
- It's a matter of breaks.
- Dad always said you were going places.

207
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:39,178
Well, wherever I'm going doesn't mean
a thing unless you go with me.

208
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,598
You won't be going anywhere
if you keep ignoring the danger you're in.

209
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:48,605
- Is Mr. Grover in his office?
- Yes, just a moment.

210
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,274
Miss Phelps would like to see you.
He'll be right out.

211
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,861
Thank you. Don't forget.

212
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:01,117
- Oh, Mr. Grover, this is Wolf J. Flywheel.
- How do you do?

213
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:05,621
That's rather a personal question, old man.
How I do and what I do is my concern.

214
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,291
And if you marry me,
your concern will be my concern.

215
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,793
I've just hired Mr. Flywheel
as a floorwalker.

216
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,379
- Martha, we have enough floorwalkers.
- Oh, please.

217
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,882
Well, if you desire. What experience
have you had in a department store?

218
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,638
- I was a shoplifter for three years.
- Mr. Flywheel likes a little joke.

219
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,643
Just tell Mr. Grover
what experience you've had.

220
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,145
- Do you object if I ask a few questions?
- Not at all.

221
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,106
- Ask her anything.
- It's you that I'm asking the questions.

222
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:36,443
I just heard you ask her if you could
ask me a few questions. I'm not blind.

223
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,363
We will assume that I am a customer.

224
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,450
- I'm returning a baby carriage.
- Are you married?

225
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,202
- Of course not.
- What are you doing with a baby carriage?

226
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,538
This man's a cad, a yellow cad.

227
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,459
Why, the whole thing is utterly ridiculous.
Now, I'll ask you a simple question.

228
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,880
It's bargain day. The store is crowded.
A woman faints. What do you do?

229
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,007
How old is she?

230
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,510
- What difference does it make?
- Hear that? A woman's life is in danger...

231
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,097
...and he asks,
"What difference does it make?"

232
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,850
And that charlatan is running your store?
Martha, I'd fire him immediately.

233
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,228
If Miss Phelps were not my fiancée...

234
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,939
...I would tender my resignation
and walk out for good.

235
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,857
- Oh, no, no.
- Fiancée?

236
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,152
- Yes.
- You mean that a woman of your culture...

237
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:21,196
...and beauty and money and wealth
and money would marry that impostor?

238
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,327
Just a moment. What's the idea
of prowling around here?

239
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,538
- Why, that's Tommy Rogers.
- Oh, how are you, Tommy?

240
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,582
- No, I'm Tommy Rogers.
- Well, how are you?

241
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,462
- How do you do?
- I'm Ravelli. I'm Tommy's bodyguard.

242
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,882
You're Tommy...? I'm Tommy's bodyguard.
And I've just been engaged.

243
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,260
You'll excuse me.

244
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,970
So you all been engaged, huh?

245
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,556
Of course.
Here's my $5 deposit to prove it.

246
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:50,101
Well, keep the $5.
I'll guard Tommy for nothing.

247
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:53,271
- Scab.
- I heard that.

248
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,899
You're not a floorwalker.
You're a so-called bodyguard.

249
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,610
- What does this mean?
- Why, l...

250
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:03,823
I felt Tommy needed a real, experienced
detective to safeguard him, so I... .

251
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,159
So she hired me, the greatest
detective since Sherlock Holmes.

252
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,079
- I'm crazy about Sherlock Holmes.
- It won't do you any good.

253
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,580
He's got a wife and kids.

254
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:15,209
- So this man is a detective?
- Yes.

255
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,879
- Mr. Flywheel.
- Just call me Wolf.

256
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,257
You revealed yourself.
You've spoiled everything.

257
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,592
And after you promised not to tell.

258
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,222
How could I keep from telling the world
of your beauty and my feelings about you?

259
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,100
<i>She walks in beauty</i>
<i>Like the night</i>

260
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,936
<i>Of cloudless climes and starry skies</i>

261
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,606
Why, that's Byron.

262
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,817
He was thinking of you when he wrote it.

263
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,944
Wolf, do you remember this?

264
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:45,448
<i>Thou friend, whose presence</i>
<i>On my wintry heart</i>

265
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:50,786
<i>Fell, like bright spring</i>
<i>Upon some herbless plain</i>

266
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,790
- Shelley?
- Shelley.

267
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:57,585
They're not writing
that kind of stuff anymore.

268
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,295
Here's a little something to you.

269
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,882
<i>Your eyes so blue</i>
<i>Your heart so true</i>

270
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,302
<i>Your lips divine</i>
<i>Say you'll be mine</i>

271
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:10,639
Wolf, where did you ever learn
to write such beautiful poetry?

272
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,518
I worked five years for Burma-Shave.

273
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:17,689
What is this man? A detective,
a floorwalker or a poet?

274
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:21,067
All three and not bad
at making love, eh, Martha?

275
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,653
I can't stand this any longer,
and I won't stand it.

276
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,323
Just a moment, Mr. Grover. If my aunt
wants this man to be my bodyguard...

277
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,325
...it's okay with me.

278
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:32,453
Mr. Flywheel, my life is in your hands.

279
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,042
I wouldn't be happy here.
I'm not appreciated.

280
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,837
Not appreciated?
Why, I think you're great.

281
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,841
What do you...?
What do you really think of me?

282
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,845
- Well, I think you're wonderful.
- Do you...?

283
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:53,057
- Do you think I'm any good?
- Man, you're terrific.

284
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:58,270
- How am I? All right?
- Want to know? You're sensational.

285
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,274
I could listen to this man forever.

286
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,694
And now, if you don't mind...

287
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:08,531
...Martha and I would like to be alone.
Scram!

288
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,706
Hey. Hey.

289
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:20,209
Come on, get that thing away
from that fireplug before I start writing.

290
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:26,758
Nobody puts anything over on me.
Thanks, buddy.

291
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,285
Give me that purse.

292
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,120
You stole it.

293
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,913
Then where'd you get it?

294
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,834
Oh, so you found it, huh?

295
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:05,380
Well, if you found it, take it
to the lost-and-found department.

296
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,551
Tier 76.

297
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:15,056
There's a suspicious character
bringing a purse in. He claims he found it.

298
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:22,146
- Give me that.
- He's all right. He's the detective here.

299
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,440
Where did you find it?

300
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,446
Miss Phelps.

301
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,032
Mr. Grover's office, please.

302
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,120
No.

303
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,121
- Hello?
- Pardon me.

304
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,790
Pardon me.

305
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:45,336
Just a moment. I just caught
the crook that stole your purse.

306
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,381
Drag him up.

307
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,716
You may have it.

308
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:56,722
Come on, my boy, there's a judge in this
precinct who just loves purse-snatchers.

309
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,608
Get up out of there.

310
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,779
Why'd you run away from me?
Now I know you're a thief.

311
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:15,033
- You didn't think I was a real detective?
- Lf you are, I'm a monkey's uncle.

312
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,868
- Keep your family out of this.
- Please.

313
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,536
This is between we two men...

314
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:21,414
...and this little slip of a girl.

315
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:28,922
You were right. Mr. Flywheel is a wizard.
He caught the man who stole my purse.

316
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,174
Martha, I told you that man
was sensational.

317
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,092
Oh, he's wonderful.

318
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,763
Same tailor. How much do you owe him?

319
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:41,142
Snatching purses around here?
We don't stand for that.

320
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,352
Here's the purse.

321
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,857
There's a mistake.
I'll take it to the Supreme Court.

322
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:52,945
- Why, that man's your driver.
- He's no driver, that's my brother.

323
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,989
Wacky.

324
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,408
You still like it, huh?

325
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,537
A detective, eh?

326
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,374
Hey, Tommy, you remember
my brother Wacky.

327
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:09,128
Why, of course. Hi, Wacky.
I haven't seen you in years.

328
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,715
That man's no thief.
Just look at his face.

329
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,717
Frightening, isn't it?

330
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:17,052
Why, this place
is becoming a madhouse.

331
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,222
Right. This was a clever trick
on my part...

332
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,808
...to show you the kind of man
you employ as manager.

333
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,894
Your aunt left her purse in my car.
This lovable little waif...

334
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:29,899
...unselfishly returns it
and is accused of being a thief.

335
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:36,239
You better let Flywheel
handle this case. He's a smart man.

336
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:40,034
I think so too. We won't need
any store detectives with him around.

337
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,995
Very well, Mr. Flywheel,
you have carte blanche.

338
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,331
Okay, I'll take her.

339
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:51,670
- You make me think of my youth.
- Really? He must be a big boy by now.

340
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,840
Come on, men.

341
00:27:55,675 --> 00:28:00,680
Grover, pay off this flatfoot as of today.
Give him what's coming to him.

342
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,768
Don't you think there's something
charming about Mr. Flywheel?

343
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,353
Yes, there certainly is.

344
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,273
You take care of the first floor.
You, the second floor.

345
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,942
- I'll take care of Martha.
- You'll take care of nothing.

346
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,945
I'm fed up with you.
How do you expect me to run a store...

347
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,781
...with you maniacs destroying
priceless antiques...

348
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,617
...insulting customers,
disturbing the general routine?

349
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:26,873
- No wonder business is bad.
- Mr. Grover, you are just a quack to me.

350
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:46,637
<i>This jacket svelte is made of felt</i>
<i>But it feels more like a mat</i>

351
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,140
<i>If the felt should itch</i>
<i>You could make a switch</i>

352
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:50,850
<i>And wear it for a hat</i>

353
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,351
This is an American Navy girl.

354
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,855
Every night, two sailors
wait to convoy her home.

355
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:01,819
<i>This step-in gay is recherché</i>
<i>And fits both slim and stout</i>

356
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:06,198
<i>To smart affairs, my lady wears</i>
<i>The step-in to step out</i>

357
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:10,953
This is known as a California dress.
On a clear night, you can see Catalina.

358
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:16,751
<i>This daring gown has stormed the town</i>
<i>lts lamé will not crack</i>

359
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:21,547
<i>As a special offer, Phelps will proffer</i>
<i>A free belt in the back</i>

360
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:26,136
This is a bright-red dress,
but Technicolor is so expensive.

361
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,974
<i>This Eton coat right off the boat</i>
<i>Of quality unbeaten</i>

362
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,355
<i>Is the only cloth the cultured moth</i>
<i>Has never, ever eaten</i>

363
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:50,984
Peggy, the Hastings brothers
are taking the store over tomorrow.

364
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,652
That means I've gotta work fast.

365
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,822
I've gotta meet Tommy and get him
up to the roadhouse by tonight.

366
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,825
Just get him there. The boys
will see that he won't come back.

367
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,369
Your worries are over. Lead me to him.

368
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:05,915
He's at the music counter, expecting you.
I told him you're an important music critic.

369
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,501
Peggy...

370
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:12,338
...six months from now, we'll own
this store together and be rolling in money.

371
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:14,298
What about Martha?

372
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:19,137
After she and I are married, who knows?
Maybe there'll be an accident.

373
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:21,306
Stop worrying.

374
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,529
After lunch, we'll take a trip
to the conservatory.

375
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,781
I'm anxious to show
the professor the plans.

376
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,283
I can't go until Kitty gets back
from her lunch.

377
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:44,704
- I'll get someone to take your place.
- Go ahead. I watch the counter.

378
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:48,374
- You go ahead. I'll watch Ravelli.
- Who's gonna watch you?

379
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,710
Boys, you take over till Kitty gets back.

380
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:54,213
What about your interview
with that female critic?

381
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,841
I don't want any publicity
about the conservatory.

382
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,635
The only interview I want is with you.

383
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,764
Looks like a counter attack.

384
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,897
Hey, look!

385
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,566
It's only a woman.

386
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:21,574
You pay $2.40 to place.
Wolf J. Flywheel, at your service.

387
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,534
I represent the magazine <i>Musical Life. </i>

388
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,245
Working your way through college.

389
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:28,581
I'm sorry, but I've already subscribed to
<i>Click, Pick, Hick, Tick... </i>

390
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:32,293
<i>...Gaff, Staff, Laugh</i> and <i>Chaff. </i>
- Pardon me.

391
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:36,547
Young lady,
do you expect Mr. Rogers soon?

392
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:40,635
I'm here to interview him, and I don't care
to be annoyed by these silly creatures.

393
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:42,386
Flattery will get you nowhere.

394
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,514
Mr. Rogers is probably in his office.

395
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:47,725
No. He went to lunch with Joan,
the girl who works at this counter.

396
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:50,060
Anyhow, Tommy says
he didn't wanna meet you.

397
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:53,397
Oh, not really. You mean he took one
of the help to lunch?

398
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:55,024
Sure. Why not?

399
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:57,276
I didn't know it was being done anywhere.

400
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:03,157
I'll be at the millinery counter.
Call me when Mr. Rogers returns.

401
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,700
Out of my way, stupid.

402
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,589
Good afternoon. Just a moment, please.

403
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,051
Here it is, madam.

404
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:27,432
I want you to get me a piece of cloth
to cover this hat and match this dress.

405
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,643
- But that will take at least a week.
- I want it now.

406
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:35,064
I'm sorry, madam, but you must realize
the material in that dress is very unusual.

407
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:39,902
- We'll have to send out for it.
- Get it at once, or I'll speak to Mr. Grover.

408
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,196
Well, I'll call the buyer.

409
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:44,449
And hurry it up.
I can't wait here all day.

410
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:48,911
Mr. Williams, please.

411
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:51,289
I'm sure we have nothing like it in stock.

412
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:52,915
Hurry up, please.

413
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,585
Yes, yes, I will. Hello?

414
00:38:57,879 --> 00:39:01,465
So you did have it.
Saving it for another customer.

415
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:13,019
I've changed my mind.
I don't want the thing at all. It's awful.

416
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,149
Joan.

417
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,818
Oh, Fred.
Something's happened to Tommy.

418
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:23,404
I phoned his hotel three times.
There was no answer.

419
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,656
We were here till 5 a.m.
going over the books.

420
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:28,660
Then he and his bodyguard went
to the bed department to sleep.

421
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:31,663
I hope he won't be late.
He has an important meeting at 1 0.

422
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,582
- He won't be. He's in his office now.
- Thanks, Fred.

423
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:38,502
You've gotta get those bodyguards out of
the bed department and out of the store!

424
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:42,173
I've got to get those bodyguards
out of the bed department.

425
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,175
- That's no problem.
- What do you mean?

426
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:46,093
If I don't, Grover will throw me out.

427
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:48,846
And if I do get them out,
Rogers will fire me.

428
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:50,265
I don't know what to do.

429
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:52,183
I'd follow Grover's instructions.

430
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,852
But how will I get them out of the store?

431
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:58,022
Why not start a sale in the bed department
and drive them out?

432
00:39:58,189 --> 00:39:59,732
That's a great idea!

433
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:03,611
They're selling the store in an hour
and starting a sale. I don't get it.

434
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:09,284
Just wait till you see this bed, Henry.
I saw it yesterday, and I'm crazy about it.

435
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,286
I fell in love with it. Turn around.

436
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:13,204
Now, wait a minute.

437
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,047
Pardon me.

438
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,301
Mister. Mister!

439
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,929
- What's the price of this bed?
- Eight thousand dollars.

440
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:31,347
Preposterous.

441
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,891
I can get the same bed
anywhere in town for $25.

442
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,268
Not with me in it.

443
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:39,146
Sir, how dare you talk
that way to my wife?

444
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,357
How dare I talk that way to your wife?

445
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,068
- Have you ever met me before?
- No!

446
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:47,780
Then why do you allow your wife
to go around waking up strange men?

447
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,408
Come, Henry, before you lose your temper.

448
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:52,743
I'll bet he does the cooking.

449
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,924
Look at the funny man!

450
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:11,429
What other hobbies have you got?

451
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:16,934
We like to see something
that is different in a bed.

452
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:20,438
You would? Just press that button
over by the davenport.

453
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:21,981
Where is the davenport?

454
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:24,984
It's in lowa. Too bad you missed,
that was a $9 question.

455
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:42,919
Hey.

456
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,803
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.

457
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,179
What you want?

458
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:57,350
Well, me and my family,
we live in a three-room apartment...

459
00:41:57,517 --> 00:42:00,144
...and all I can see is beds, beds, beds.

460
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:03,605
And believe me,
I got no room for nothing else.

461
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:08,110
That's why I'm looking for something
that no look like a bed.

462
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:10,154
Well, you gonna worry no more.

463
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,823
I got just the thing you want.

464
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,785
Don't get fresh.
No make fun of how I talk.

465
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,789
I no make fun.
I'm the same national like you.

466
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:23,167
- Is you was born in Naples?
- Sure. Is you was?

467
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:26,379
- Sure.
- I was too.

468
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,714
Hey! I remember you.

469
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:32,677
Guiseppi, the best grape presser
in all Italy.

470
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:34,970
Hey, Wacky.

471
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,598
Look who's here. Guiseppi!

472
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,851
Excuse me, please. Do I know you?

473
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,186
You no remember me?

474
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:45,648
I used to press the grapes with you.

475
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:48,526
- Ravelli!
- Guiseppi!

476
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:50,486
Hey!

477
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,697
Press the grapes. No press my wife.

478
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:56,367
Don't get mad.
You remember my brother Wacky.

479
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:58,870
<i>Cumpa! </i>

480
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:01,831
Excuse me, mister.
I wanna see some beds.

481
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,751
Come on. Right here. Come on.

482
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:08,879
See? That's a wonderful bed.

483
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:11,340
- That's a bed?
- Sure. I show you.

484
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:14,219
- What's the matter that fella?
- I don't know.

485
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,887
Look, Guiseppi!

486
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:20,391
It's a bookcase by day, is a bed by night.

487
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:22,309
I don't like this bed.

488
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:26,105
All right. All right. You no like this bed,
I show you another one. Come on.

489
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:28,233
- Where you take me?
- I don't know.

490
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:30,693
I don't know myself.

491
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:34,239
All right, all right, all right.

492
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:36,783
Here we go!

493
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:42,706
- Guiseppi, watch out!
- It's all right.

494
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,168
It's okay, it's a bed.

495
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:53,174
Hey, you see?
That's a safe place to keep the kids.

496
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:54,925
Hey.

497
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:56,761
- Guiseppi!
- What's the matter?

498
00:43:57,178 --> 00:44:00,431
Brenda, Garibaldi, Dion! Guiseppi!

499
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,104
- Hey! No get excited.
- Excited? Hey, mister, where are my kids?

500
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,981
- What kids?
- My kids.

501
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:10,900
- Lucretia!
- Brenda!

502
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:16,489
Hey, what's the difficulty here?

503
00:44:16,656 --> 00:44:21,619
Look, I no get excited like my wife,
but I come in here with 1 2 kids...

504
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:23,329
...and now there are only six.

505
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:26,749
- What happened my six kids?
- What are their draft numbers?

506
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:32,338
Look, there's only six kids,
and I know I got 1 2 kids.

507
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:35,216
Twelve kids, eh?
How much do you make a week?

508
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:37,968
- Twenty-five dollars.
- You can't afford to have 1 2 kids.

509
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:40,138
No tell me what I can afford!

510
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:44,267
The only thing I know is, I got 1 2 kids,
and now there are only six.

511
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:48,312
My good man, statistics prove it costs
$5 a week to provide for a child.

512
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,108
Twelve times five is $60.
You only make $25 a week.

513
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:56,028
It's economically impossible for you
to have 1 2 children!

514
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:00,825
That's right. That's right.

515
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,797
We got 1 2 kids!

516
00:45:17,842 --> 00:45:21,136
Quiet! Please, quiet!

517
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:24,807
Look, mister, I come in here with six kids...

518
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:26,225
No six, 1 2 kids.

519
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:28,728
Twelve and six? That's 1 8.
How many have you got?

520
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:30,187
Where is my 1 8 kids?

521
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:32,982
Mister, if you don't get my kids,
I call the police.

522
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:35,276
Please don't let your wife call the police.

523
00:45:35,443 --> 00:45:36,694
Remember the grapes.

524
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,362
- Remember the grapes.
- The grapes!

525
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,532
Remember the <i>Maine</i> too,
while you remember.

526
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:43,034
- You look like the boss.
- Wait a minute. Quiet!

527
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:44,618
Now, let's get this straight.

528
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:47,747
You say you came in with 1 2 grapes,
and now you've only got six.

529
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:51,000
- No grapes. Six kids!
- You just said you had 1 2 kids.

530
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:53,252
She says you've got 1 8.
How many have you got?

531
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,046
How many grapes have your kids got?

532
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:58,132
- I no want no grapes!
- You got no grapes? I get you some.

533
00:45:58,299 --> 00:45:59,967
- Get him a bunch of grapes.
- My kids!

534
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:03,012
You should've gone
to the fruit department. This is furniture.

535
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:05,347
We don't have any grapes here.

536
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:07,850
- My kids, please!
- Stop! Stop!

537
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:16,650
Where have you been?
Your father's been looking for you.

538
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:20,196
There you are. You came in with 1 2 kids,
you're going out with 1 2 kids.

539
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:22,865
Who took my children over here like that?

540
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:27,328
Hey, you get down here.
Come on, now.

541
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:32,959
- You gotta get me 1 2 kids!
- How'd I get mixed up in your family life?

542
00:46:34,794 --> 00:46:38,631
Hey! Where you been?
Your father's been looking all over for you.

543
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:40,549
Come on. Come on.

544
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:43,261
Hey! Guiseppi! Here's your kids!

545
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:45,596
Yes, now, go on home.
I wanna go back to sleep.

546
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:49,142
- These are not my kids!
- Guiseppi... .

547
00:46:50,518 --> 00:46:52,228
- I cannot believe... .
- Water!

548
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:55,273
- It's got a ladder to the top.
- They sleep on it.

549
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,649
Water!

550
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:03,114
Water!

551
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:25,469
Hey, here's your kids.

552
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:27,221
These are not my kids!

553
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:30,642
Tom, Steven, Harry, John.

554
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:42,487
Hey, you two! Go on, get!

555
00:47:42,987 --> 00:47:44,446
Push the button!

556
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,658
Come here. Come on.

557
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:52,705
Joan?

558
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:56,667
- Did you find Tommy all right?
- Yes. I just spoke to him.

559
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:58,419
You were rather worried about him.

560
00:47:58,586 --> 00:48:01,589
Why shouldn't I be?
Tommy asked me to marry him.

561
00:48:01,756 --> 00:48:04,592
- And?
- And I said yes.

562
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:07,469
Oh, that's it, huh?

563
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:09,597
What's the matter? Don't you like him?

564
00:48:09,764 --> 00:48:13,642
Oh, sure, sure. I think he's a grand guy,
and I'm very happy for you, sis.

565
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,567
- I feel much better now.
- That's good.

566
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:23,778
Another hour, it'll be all over.

567
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:29,116
- Morning, Mr. Grover.
- Good morning.

568
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:31,077
Never mind. Here they are.

569
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,245
Gentlemen.

570
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:36,624
Just a minute. Going down?

571
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:41,295
- They're in the music department.
- Let's get it over with.

572
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,089
Wait a minute.

573
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,883
Now, remember...

574
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:48,303
...he's got to be rubbed out
in the next hour.

575
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,264
- It's as good as done.
- In the bag.

576
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:00,815
- There's the music counter.
- I wish I knew what Rogers looked like.

577
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:03,818
What's the difference? We'll find him.

578
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:11,659
- Flywheel, wake up.
- Go away. Find your own kids.

579
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:14,161
Tommy's in danger.
A couple thugs wanna kill him.

580
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:16,372
They can't kill him,
I haven't been paid yet.

581
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:19,500
Come on, get up and find Tommy
while I get the police.

582
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,378
Get up! The killers are in the store!

583
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:23,337
Why doesn't somebody wait on them?

584
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:25,757
They're about your height,
wearing gray topcoats.

585
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:27,425
Gray topcoats. Yeah, yeah.

586
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:29,343
- Gray top... Gray topcoats.
- Yeah.

587
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:32,930
- And be very careful. They're dangerous.
- I got that. Yeah.

588
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:36,184
Ravelli! Ravelli, wake up.

589
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,852
Go away. I got insomnia.

590
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:39,562
Wake up. There's no time to lose.

591
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:42,857
Two killers in gray topcoats
are after Tommy.

592
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:49,822
Hey, Wacky! Wake up.

593
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:52,866
We gotta find the killers. Come on.

594
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,745
Turn out the lights.

595
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:05,588
Hey, Wacky, I don't see no gray coats.

596
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:07,131
Wait! I got an idea.

597
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:11,468
I play the piano. We get enough people
around, and we catch them. Come on.

598
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,475
Remember, I used to give you lessons too?

599
00:50:17,642 --> 00:50:19,393
Go on. Let me hear you play something.

600
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,368
Wacky, there's no gray coats here.
Come on.

601
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:28,582
The killers are on the second floor.
Go the back way so they don't see us.

602
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,918
I'll go ahead and point them out to you.

603
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:47,852
Where did he go?

604
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:55,943
Just think, Arthur,
within an hour, this store will be ours.

605
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:57,320
At our own price.

606
00:53:57,487 --> 00:53:59,655
We're not buying the store.
We're stealing it.

607
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:02,951
Just remember, it's the Hastings'
reputation that makes it possible.

608
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:06,454
I always have a hard time realizing
how important we are.

609
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:07,663
Yes.

610
00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:10,624
Pardon me, gentlemen.

611
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,960
Are those gray coats gray,
or am I colorblind?

612
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:15,547
No, you're not colorblind.
They're gray, all right.

613
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:19,509
Oh, fine. Then I'd like to show you
a cute little trick. Put out your hands.

614
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:21,302
Handcuffs.

615
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:24,556
- Demonstrating something?
- It's a new department.

616
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:27,350
That's only half the trick.
Now step forward.

617
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:29,810
Now put out the other hands.

618
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,732
Now, don't go away.

619
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:38,820
Keep an eye on these boys.

620
00:54:41,197 --> 00:54:42,448
Get me Grover's office.

621
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:45,034
What? You've captured the killers?

622
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:48,495
Isn't Mr. Flywheel wonderful?
Single-handed, he's caught the criminals.

623
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:50,956
How right I was in bringing him
into the store.

624
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:52,583
We'll be right down, Wolf.

625
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:54,210
My hero!

626
00:54:54,377 --> 00:54:56,295
- Where is he?
- On the first floor.

627
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:58,089
You better come along.

628
00:54:58,506 --> 00:55:01,592
Take these off at once
and cut out this infernal nonsense!

629
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,845
There you are. I give you the killers.

630
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:07,515
Why, it's the Hastings brothers,
the men who are going to buy the store.

631
00:55:07,682 --> 00:55:10,768
Gentlemen, I'm terribly sorry,
but it's really not my fault.

632
00:55:10,935 --> 00:55:13,354
You certainly do look like crooks.

633
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:17,025
Well, we'll forget about it this time.
Mistakes can happen.

634
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:19,527
Give me those keys so I can
unlock these handcuffs.

635
00:55:19,694 --> 00:55:21,237
Hurry up.

636
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:24,532
What's the matter with you?

637
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:26,867
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

638
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,749
Up!

639
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:37,420
The gray coats! Keep them up.
Start walking.

640
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:48,723
- Well, look who's here!
- Austin Benny and the Snapper.

641
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:50,975
Been looking for these guys
for a long time.

642
00:55:51,142 --> 00:55:53,561
Be careful.
We don't wanna be sued for false arrest.

643
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,063
Sued? Why, you're entitled to a reward.

644
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:58,691
- Come on, you thugs.
- Come on, you guys, get moving.

645
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:00,359
Get along.

646
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:04,738
We're ready to close the deal, Mr. Rogers.
I have a certified check in my pocket.

647
00:56:04,906 --> 00:56:06,949
If you take us to your office,
we'll sign it.

648
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:08,910
Gentlemen, I have an idea.

649
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,871
This being Saturday,
the store closes at 1:00.

650
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:13,914
Why not postpone the signing until then?

651
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:17,502
The employees can meet the new owners.
We can make it a regular ceremony.

652
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:19,587
That's a splendid idea.

653
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:22,173
We can invite the press,
get a lot of free publicity.

654
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,549
Sounds good to me.

655
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:25,760
We can have a party,
just like in Hollywood.

656
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:28,596
- That's fine. Let there be wine.
- And women.

657
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:30,097
- And song.
- And women.

658
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:31,766
- And caviar.
- And women.

659
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:33,267
And more women.

660
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,439
Hey, Wacky. I got a good idea.

661
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:41,650
Why don't you and me
go play for the party.

662
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:44,529
Look how you're dressed.
You look terrible.

663
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:48,825
There's a bunch of high-class people there.
You're dressed like a scared scarecrow.

664
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:51,661
That's too bad.
They wouldn't let you in dressed that way.

665
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,621
Goodbye, Wacky.

666
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:08,853
Hey, Wacky? Hey, Wacky, come on.

667
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,106
Everything's fixed. You're gonna play
at the party. Come on.

668
01:02:20,865 --> 01:02:22,449
Hey, Wacky.

669
01:02:24,786 --> 01:02:26,204
Why...!

670
01:02:28,623 --> 01:02:31,375
- Gentlemen, are you well taken care of?
- Yes, thank you.

671
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:34,295
If we shoot the signing now,
we can make the first editions.

672
01:02:34,462 --> 01:02:37,298
I'll have Mr. Rogers and
the Hastings brothers ready for you.

673
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:41,010
Never mind the Hastings. We want
a picture of Rogers signing. That's news.

674
01:02:41,177 --> 01:02:42,845
Yes, I'm sure it will be.

675
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:45,682
Well, be patient.
It'll only be a few minutes.

676
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:15,503
Now, there's one thing more.
Did you get Sutton out of the store yet?

677
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:16,921
I'm waiting till dark.

678
01:03:17,088 --> 01:03:20,049
When Rogers is rubbed out,
there'll be cops. Get him out fast.

679
01:03:20,216 --> 01:03:21,967
I'll take care of it right now.

680
01:03:24,387 --> 01:03:27,807
Hop in here. There's a few things
I'd like to discuss with you.

681
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:32,645
What I'm about to say is intended
for your ears alone.

682
01:03:32,812 --> 01:03:34,855
Oh, Wolf.

683
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,902
Martha, dear, there are many bonds
that will hold us together through eternity.

684
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,780
Really, Wolf? What are they?

685
01:03:41,946 --> 01:03:45,366
Your government bonds,
your savings bonds, your liberty bonds.

686
01:03:45,533 --> 01:03:48,035
- Maybe in a year, after we're married... .
- Yes?

687
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:52,332
Who knows?
There may be a little baby bond.

688
01:03:52,582 --> 01:03:55,960
Oh, it all seems so wonderful!

689
01:03:56,127 --> 01:03:59,588
Tell me, Wolfie dear,
will we have a beautiful home?

690
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:02,049
Of course.
You're not planning on moving, are you?

691
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:06,304
No, but I'm afraid after
we're married a while...

692
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:09,557
...a beautiful young girl
will come along...

693
01:04:10,016 --> 01:04:11,892
...and you'll forget all about me.

694
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,063
Don't be silly.
I'll write you twice a week.

695
01:04:25,573 --> 01:04:26,865
Are we all ready?

696
01:04:27,033 --> 01:04:28,492
Yes.

697
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:32,580
Fellow employees...

698
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:35,583
...all of you know that Tommy Rogers'
musical education...

699
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:39,795
...was made possible by the sympathetic
understanding of the late Hiram Phelps.

700
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:41,297
If it weren't for that...

701
01:04:41,464 --> 01:04:44,633
...he might never have composed
the music you're about to hear now.

702
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:49,263
Friends, I hope you'll enjoy
Tommy Rogers' "Tenement Symphony. "

703
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:52,001
Sorry to have kept you waiting, boys.

704
01:10:52,168 --> 01:10:54,336
Don't shoot till you see
the whites of my eyes.

705
01:10:54,504 --> 01:10:58,132
This will call for a headline change.
Shove the war news to the second page.

706
01:10:58,299 --> 01:11:01,468
Tonight, the front page is mine.

707
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:06,057
- I see. Snobs.
- Don't worry. I take your picture.

708
01:11:06,224 --> 01:11:08,434
- Drop that before I drop you!
- I drop it.

709
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:09,852
Why, you!

710
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,105
- What paper do you represent?
<i>-The News. </i>

711
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:14,524
Take out a subscription to <i>The News</i>
and cancel it.

712
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:17,568
And sign the cancellation
"Disgusted Reader. "

713
01:11:20,739 --> 01:11:22,615
Would you mind if I borrowed
your camera?

714
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:26,535
Thank you, sir. You made
a powerful friend. We'll get a picture.

715
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:30,581
We'll ignore the dailies and send it
to the American Museum of Art.

716
01:11:32,834 --> 01:11:34,085
What is it, Duke?

717
01:11:34,252 --> 01:11:37,588
Sutton got away. When I spotted him,
he was talking to his sister Joan.

718
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:41,176
- Why didn't you get him?
- He ducked into a crowd and disappeared.

719
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:44,095
We've got to get Joan.
She'll talk. Come on.

720
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:46,514
Hey, look at me and laugh.

721
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:48,724
I've been doing that for 20 years.

722
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:53,104
- I must speak to you at once.
- What a lucky girl.

723
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:55,940
Just in time to get in the picture with me.

724
01:11:57,108 --> 01:11:58,651
- Pose pretty, now.
- Get ready.

725
01:11:58,818 --> 01:12:00,236
Look nice, now.

726
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:03,781
- Turn on the lights!
- What's the meaning of this?

727
01:12:03,948 --> 01:12:06,241
Don't worry, Joan, I'll protect you.

728
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:08,702
I can't understand why Tommy
wants to marry you.

729
01:12:10,288 --> 01:12:13,791
- Where did that scream come from?
- Stand back, everybody. Touch nothing.

730
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:17,169
- Luckily, Wolf was at the crime scene.
- Where's Joan?

731
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:20,965
- Hey, Tommy, I got the picture.
- Oh, gentlemen, the case is solved.

732
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:23,968
He'll develop this picture
and bring to light what took place.

733
01:12:24,135 --> 01:12:26,470
I'll look for Joan while you
develop the picture.

734
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:30,308
- You know how to develop it?
- He can use potassium or silver nitrate.

735
01:12:30,475 --> 01:12:33,227
Use the nitrate, it's cheaper.

736
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:38,524
- Are you all right, Tommy?
- Yeah.

737
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:49,619
This looks like Grover, is built like
Grover and is dressed like Grover.

738
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:51,996
- Who do you think it is?
- Grover Cleveland.

739
01:12:52,163 --> 01:12:54,957
Why don't you assist
Basil Rathbone and let me alone.

740
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:59,003
Hurry with the picture. I'm going to the
police. This means 99 years for Grover.

741
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:01,213
Maybe even life.

742
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:05,176
- Give me that negative.
- Quiet.

743
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:07,970
Give me that negative.

744
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:16,646
- Give me that picture.
- Can't we talk this over sociably?

745
01:13:16,813 --> 01:13:18,981
- Give me the picture.
- They're a dollar a dozen.

746
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:22,277
- Give me that picture.
- I guess we better give him the picture.

747
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:39,544
Come on!

748
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:49,262
Hey, come on!

749
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,061
I think he's unconscious.

750
01:13:57,228 --> 01:13:59,563
What's the difference?
We've still got the picture.

751
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:02,191
All right, up with your hands.

752
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:07,029
I got him! I got him! Here!

753
01:14:07,364 --> 01:14:09,240
Thought we wouldn't get you, huh?

754
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:11,700
Now give me that picture.

755
01:14:30,387 --> 01:14:32,263
<i>-Adiós, senor! </i>
<i>-Arrivederci! </i>

756
01:14:50,907 --> 01:14:54,118
There's a couple crazy killers loose
in the store. Rogers' bodyguard.

757
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:58,164
Turn out the lights, lock the doors
and shoot on sight.

758
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:25,066
- We can't go this way. The cops.
- Let's go this way, it's quicker.

759
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:35,201
Hey, we got to skate faster than
they can shoot.

760
01:15:35,368 --> 01:15:38,913
There's an exit at the end
of the aisle. Skate like mad!

761
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,957
- Come on!
- Come on!

762
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:49,381
You go down that way.
I'll go down this!

763
01:17:01,621 --> 01:17:03,456
Look! Wacky!

764
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:36,489
Don't move! Get Mr. Grover.

765
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:06,603
We've got to get this picture
to Tommy immediately!

766
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,312
There he is!

767
01:19:06,246 --> 01:19:09,374
Hey, Wacky! Flywheel!
Help! Help!

768
01:19:09,582 --> 01:19:13,419
Hey, Flywheel!
Hey, Wacky! Flywheel!

769
01:19:24,055 --> 01:19:27,349
- Hey! Don't let him get that!
- What do you think you're doing?

770
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:33,439
- Stick them up, or I'll shoot.
- He'll shoot.

771
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,612
Wacky.

772
01:19:39,821 --> 01:19:41,447
Come on, Wacky.

773
01:19:48,371 --> 01:19:50,831
Flywheel, in here!

774
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:54,335
Hurry, Wacky! Come on! Come on!

775
01:19:56,921 --> 01:19:58,964
- Turn that over here.
- Get that over there.

776
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:00,633
Hey, Wacky, come here.

777
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:03,428
Quick! Quick!

778
01:20:03,636 --> 01:20:05,512
Up against the door, now.

779
01:20:07,557 --> 01:20:10,351
Give me that picture!

780
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:14,647
- All right! All right!
- Don't shoot!

781
01:20:14,814 --> 01:20:17,817
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot! We give up!
- All right. Come on.

782
01:20:26,242 --> 01:20:28,702
- Well, that takes care of him.
- Let's get out of here.

783
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:31,288
Get the police, quick!

784
01:20:31,706 --> 01:20:34,041
- Here I am.
- That's what I call quick.

785
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:37,295
- Certainly give you service from this door.
- Get them up.

786
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,048
Hey, Tommy, we got Grover in there!

787
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,801
Good. I've got some unfinished business
to take care of.

788
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:47,305
Come on out, Grover!

789
01:20:48,139 --> 01:20:51,892
- You've got nothing on me.
- Wasn't there anything on that negative?

790
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,980
- Yes. It wasn't a good picture of me.
- No, nor of me.

791
01:20:57,399 --> 01:20:59,567
Go upstairs and peddle your store.

792
01:20:59,734 --> 01:21:02,611
- Not before we get a shot of you first.
- No, no, please!

793
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:05,907
- Don't take a picture of me yet.
- Go on, take his picture.

794
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,826
No! There's a gun concealed
in one of those cameras.

795
01:21:08,993 --> 01:21:12,788
So that's why you wanted them
to take my picture alone. Why, you...

796
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:22,298
I told you in the first reel
he was a crook.

797
01:21:22,465 --> 01:21:25,301
Come upstairs before the
Hastings brothers change their minds.

798
01:21:25,468 --> 01:21:30,264
Perhaps they'll buy me out too. Tommy,
whatever you want to do is all right.

799
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:31,641
Thank you, Aunt Martha.

800
01:21:42,527 --> 01:21:43,903
Hey, Flywheel.

801
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:49,367
I've been looking for you.
I'm from the finance company.

802
01:21:49,534 --> 01:21:51,744
You haven't made a car payment
for 1 2 years.

803
01:21:51,911 --> 01:21:54,121
You can't fool me this time.
I know who you are.

804
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,291
You're one of Mr. Flywheel's
assistants.

805
01:21:56,458 --> 01:22:01,004
Don't you just love working
for a man like Mr. Flywheel?

806
01:22:01,254 --> 01:22:03,214
Look, lady, cut out the double talk.

807
01:22:03,381 --> 01:22:05,883
He hasn't made a payment
on that car for 1 2 years.

808
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:08,511
I'll see that you get a check
in the morning, old man.

809
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:10,805
Miss Phelps' residence.

810
01:22:12,849 --> 01:22:17,019
