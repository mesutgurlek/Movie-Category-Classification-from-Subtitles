1
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:12,024
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

2
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:15,104
Welcome to the newest,
the greatest...

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,496
the most spectacular
show in entertainment history.

4
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:25,332
Put your hands together for
the fabulous Feebles Variety Hour!

5
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:33,812
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles...</i>

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,572
<i>We're not average ordinary people.</i>

7
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:41,373
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

8
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:47,566
<i>Animal acts
and other attractions.</i>

9
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:50,727
<i>Bring me a pussy
and I show you some action.</i>

10
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:52,048
<i>I'm a contortionist.</i>

11
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:53,846
<i>A modernist.
An hippopotamus.</i>

12
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:56,533
<i>Be sure we guarantee
to amuse you.</i>

13
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:58,449
<i>Wait to meet the Feebles.</i>

14
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:00,688
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

15
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,803
<i>We're not average ordinary people.</i>

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:10,323
<i>Meet the Feebles,
Meet the Feebles.</i>

17
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:13,521
And now...

18
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:16,156
here's...

19
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,479
Harry.

20
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:22,399
Yipeee! Ha ha!
Hi, folks!

21
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:25,243
Welcome to the Feebles
Variety Hour.

22
00:01:25,364 --> 00:01:28,275
Oh boy, what a line-up
we've got for you tonight.

23
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:33,561
But first, give a huge reception
to our very own Venus...

24
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:38,072
that gorgeous hunk
of hippo-hood, Heidi!

25
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:47,071
<i>I'm Heidi, hi!</i>

26
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:48,710
<i>I love you all.</i>

27
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:52,192
<i>You're as pretty as me,
but I'm the star.</i>

28
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:55,193
<i>I put on my best,
my talents are huge.</i>

29
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,191
<i>We've got a show...</i>

30
00:01:57,314 --> 00:02:00,225
<i>but it's about to start
to meet the Feebles.</i>

31
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,706
<i>Meet the Feebles.</i>

32
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:05,268
<i>We're not average
ordinary people.</i>

33
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:09,224
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

34
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,188
All right you fat slag,
move your ass!

35
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:22,616
How dare you speak to me like that,
you horrible, spiteful little rat!

36
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:26,577
I've heard better singing from
a mongoose with throat cancer.

37
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:28,979
I won't stand for this treatment
any longer.

38
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:32,374
I'm an artiste.
I demand respect.

39
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:34,891
Artiste, that's a good one.

40
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,853
That's it!
I've had enough!

41
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:40,291
- I'm going straight to Bletch.
- You do that darling.

42
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:42,297
What is going on over there?

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,218
Heidi, where are you going?

44
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,818
Have you upset her again?

45
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,287
You know what happens
when she gets into a tizz.

46
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,056
The old cow's had it too good
for too long.

47
00:02:51,177 --> 00:02:54,213
Like it or not, Trevor,
she's the star of the show.

48
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,167
There's no Feebles without Heidi.

49
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:58,014
Come on everybody.

50
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,410
We're going out live
in twelve hours.

51
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,201
Heaven forbid injecting
some urgency into this occasion...

52
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,368
but for God's sake
get a move on!

53
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,765
Have a good rehearsal, Miss Heidi.

54
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:19,323
Bleeetch!

55
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:33,913
Oh, shit!

56
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:36,637
I was just about
to pop my cookies!

57
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:44,276
Sorry, Heidi, I was just
finishing off some paperwork.

58
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:47,515
Trevor's been insulting me.

59
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,869
Why, that foul-mouthed little rodent.

60
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,598
I'll give him a good talking to.

61
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,107
If it happens again,
I shan't perform.

62
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,705
There there Heidi,
don't upset yourself.

63
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,267
Do I smell perfume?

64
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,866
You're imagining things
my sweet.

65
00:04:05,994 --> 00:04:09,542
Now you go and rest up.
Big night tonight.

66
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:12,222
Come to my room later on?

67
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:15,187
I'll try.

68
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,739
Oh God!
Women!

69
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,218
When are you going to dump
that huckery moll?

70
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,902
Huckery moll she may be,
but she's also our major drawcard.

71
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,336
Show some guts, Bletch!
Get rid of her!

72
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:33,742
- God, wouldn't like to!
- I'm not waiting around for ever.

73
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:36,857
Don't worry, honey.
I'm working on it.

74
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:53,216
Excuse me, please.
I wonder if you can help me.

75
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,129
I've a letter here requesting me
to report to the stage manager.

76
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:59,613
I'm busy.
Ask somebody else.

77
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:02,889
Oh, well, no... you see...

78
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:13,407
Excuse me, sir.
I wonder if you can help.

79
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:16,053
I've a letter here asking me
to report to the stage manager.

80
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,241
I don't know man.

81
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:20,407
It's been a hell of a day.

82
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:22,680
I can feel a migraine coming on.

83
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,005
I need a paracetamol.

84
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,875
Up here!

85
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:45,353
New boy are you?
Looking for Arthur?

86
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:47,121
Is he the stage manager?

87
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:49,153
That's what he calls himself.

88
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,319
You'll never find him.
I'll take you there.

89
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,597
Thank you very much.

90
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,598
I had an audition six months ago
and I've just got the confirmation...

91
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:00,994
of my acceptance
into the Feeble Chorus.

92
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,109
I tell you what, kiddo.

93
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,716
It's not that crash hot.

94
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:07,271
They run you ragged
and they pay's lousy.

95
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,991
I'm not worried about the pay.

96
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:13,027
It's an honour just to get a chance...

97
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,752
to perform in the show.

98
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,865
I've been an admirer
of the Feebles for such a long time.

99
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:17,948
Yeah?

100
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:21,582
You'll find it pretty tough
on the wages they dish out.

101
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:24,942
But if you ever want to earn
a little extra on the side...

102
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:28,506
I'm always interested
in little stories...

103
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,308
anything spicy
or even smutty.

104
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,619
Hey Arthur!
There's a new boy to see you.

105
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,703
There's more filth here
than in the city sewers.

106
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,499
And I pay good money
for the right info.

107
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:43,345
Here you go, kid.
Don't hesitate to get in touch.

108
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:48,136
You must be Robert.
I've been expecting you.

109
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:49,935
Pleased to meet you sir.

110
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:53,021
Just call me Arthur.

111
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,861
Here you don't want that, son.

112
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:00,937
He's a non-good muckraker
from the gutter press.

113
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,890
Got nothing better to do
than make up lies...

114
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,857
and nasty stories about the cast.

115
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:07,973
Ooh!

116
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:13,488
That's Miss Heidi.
You'll have heard of her.

117
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:17,369
I certainly have.
She's my favourite star.

118
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:22,371
Excuse me, girls.

119
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,600
Can I have your attention
for a minute?

120
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:28,565
I'd like to introduce you all
to a new member of the chorus.

121
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:32,444
I'm sure you'll do your best to make
him feel a part of the Feeble family.

122
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,281
Come on, say hello Robert.
Don't be bashful.

123
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:39,006
Oh, isn't he handsome?

124
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:42,005
What a lovely set of quills!

125
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:47,683
That's Lucille.

126
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:50,239
She's just joined the chorus
as well.

127
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:52,514
You two should get together
sometime.

128
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,073
Is it true that long quills
are a sign of virility?

129
00:07:57,882 --> 00:07:59,554
Now look what you've done!

130
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:02,394
You've gone and got him
all embarrassed.

131
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:07,355
Come on Robert old son.
Uncurl, there's a good boy.

132
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,067
I think he fancies you, Lucy.

133
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,428
Yes, it's true love all right.

134
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:14,787
See the way he looked at you.

135
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:18,272
Stop it!
He's just an old hedgehog!

136
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:24,662
Get up your knees!
Put your head up!

137
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:27,228
Don't forget to breath!

138
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:36,460
<i>Funny little sandhopper
basking in the sun...</i>

139
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,820
<i>dancing and a-hopping
having lots of fun.</i>

140
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,179
<i>Bit of sand landed
in that hopper's eye.</i>

141
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,617
<i>Little sandhopper said,
"My oh my"...</i>

142
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:45,227
<i>I get one leg missing...</i>

143
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,943
<i>one leg missing...</i>

144
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:51,060
<i>I get one leg missing...</i>

145
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:52,539
<i>How do I get around?</i>

146
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,500
<i>Shiny shiny fishy
in the ocean blue.</i>

147
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,092
<i>Swam into a sewage pipe,
pooh, pooh, pooh.</i>

148
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,373
<i>Said "I'm in the shit,
better take a dive".</i>

149
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:02,811
<i>Stuck his head out of the water
and began to jive.</i>

150
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,295
<i>I got one leg missing...</i>

151
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,814
<i>one leg missing...</i>

152
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,975
<i>I got one leg missing...</i>

153
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,768
<i>How do I get around?</i>

154
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,854
<i>All right!</i>

155
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:23,246
What are you doing here,
pincushion?

156
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,809
I was just watching the chorus.

157
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:30,246
- You're the new boy, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

158
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:33,605
I just started today.
I'm Robert.

159
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,447
You may be Robert to your friends,
but you're fly shit to me.

160
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,839
Piss off!

161
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:41,765
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,957
Goddamn prickleback!

163
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,766
<i>I got one leg missing...</i>

164
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:54,003
<i>I got one leg missing...</i>

165
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:57,244
<i>I got one leg missing.</i>

166
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:58,434
<i>How do I get around?</i>

167
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:02,079
That Lucille's got
a cute tush.

168
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:06,082
I wouldn't mind giving her
a poke with the old pork sword.

169
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:07,836
<i>I get one leg missing.</i>

170
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:09,071
<i>How do I get around?</i>

171
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,188
Trevor, please,
I need it, man.

172
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:24,235
I need it.

173
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,426
I told you before,
it's coming.

174
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:30,150
Yeah, but...
I got the shakes something bad.

175
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:33,823
If I don't get a fix,
I won't be able to perform.

176
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,785
Listen, it'll be here, all right?

177
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:37,426
Stop bothering me.

178
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:38,952
I can pay for it.

179
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,305
Thanks froggy.
This'll cover what you owe me.

180
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,069
But that's all I've got!

181
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,628
Well, you'd better find
another fifty bucks before six.

182
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,740
That's all I've got!

183
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,135
Thank you everybody.

184
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:11,651
You've all mutilated
that number rather nicely.

185
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:14,336
We'll have another shot at it
at two thirty...

186
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,332
and perhaps put it out
of its misery.

187
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,849
Excuse me, Mr. Bletch.

188
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:23,414
Sir...

189
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,813
If I could have a minute
of your time.

190
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:28,132
I've been waiting to see you
all day.

191
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:31,407
I've got a smashing little routine
I think will go down a treat.

192
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:33,731
So, you want to join the Feebles?

193
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:35,493
Oh, rather!

194
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:39,653
Ok son, I'll give you one minute.
Impress me.

195
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:43,802
It's one of my own compositions.

196
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:48,123
It's called:
"Glad to Be a Guppy".

197
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:53,479
<i>I'm a fishy little fellow
with a scaly sort of skin...</i>

198
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,248
<i>and I frolic in the shadows
when the tide is coming in.</i>

199
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,757
Is something the matter,
Mr. Bletch?

200
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:02,924
I think I've got a cavity
in a rear molar.

201
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,241
Would you mind
having a look for me?

202
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:06,593
Oh, Certainly.

203
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:10,913
It's right at the back.

204
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:13,511
Oh, it's awful dark in here!

205
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:22,078
Went down a treat, all right.
Heh, heh!

206
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,918
Hello, Lucille.

207
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,035
You may not remember me.

208
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,752
My name is Robert
and I'd just like to say that...

209
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,471
you're the most pretty girl
I've ever met.

210
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:37,987
I was wondering if you would like
to go to the movies tomorrow night.

211
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:39,514
Those flowers are for you!

212
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:44,233
Maybe I should give her
the flowers first.

213
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:48,941
Gorblimey!
The poor little blighter's smitten!

214
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:54,905
Hi, these flowers are for you.
They are white roses.

215
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,862
I hope you like them.

216
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,497
You may not remember me,
but my name is Robert.

217
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,943
I was wondering if you'd like
to go to the movies.

218
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:05,696
I tried on the lace camisole
and it fitted perfectly.

219
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:10,177
Hi, my name is...
movies...

220
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:12,984
I'd like to Robert you with...

221
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:18,903
Here Rob old son.
Come on in for a cup of tea.

222
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,774
When are we due on the course?

223
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,847
One o'clock sharp.
It's all arranged.

224
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:36,568
How's your handicap, Barry?

225
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:40,695
She's at home baking a cake, boss.

226
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:08,363
Heavens, Heidi!

227
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,041
You haven't been exercising,
have you?

228
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,363
All that excess flab must put
a terrible strain on your heart.

229
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:18,963
If you're referring to my muscle tone,
it's never been better.

230
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:21,882
You must have awful trouble
buying clothes.

231
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:25,439
Still, at your age I suppose
you might as well let your figure go.

232
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:29,151
How dare you insult me, you,
you cheap pussy?

233
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:32,828
You shuddering great herbivore!

234
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,110
No wonder Bletch can't stand
the sight of you!

235
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,195
You're lying!
He loves me!

236
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,354
- He detests you!
- That's not true!

237
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,071
You bore him to tears and
you're awful in bed.

238
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:46,114
It's me he wants.
He can't get enough of me.

239
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,231
Liar!

240
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,147
If you weren't so stupid...

241
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:51,908
you'd know we've been
having an affair for months.

242
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:56,823
You liar!
You liar!

243
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:59,544
Hey, good one!
You showed her!

244
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:06,787
Right, Robbie.
Now you got everything I told you.

245
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,742
She's in there now,
so you give it your best shot.

246
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:13,980
Are you sure that this is a good
idea?

247
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:16,940
She'll love it.

248
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:33,139
<i>You are my amour, what I adore.
Oh Lucille!</i>

249
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:42,656
<i>This is the way that I must say
how my heart feels!</i>

250
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:47,134
<i>Oh, Lucille!
Oh, Lucille!</i>

251
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:50,726
<i>Oohh, Luc... ciii!</i>

252
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:57,564
Keep going, keep going!
It's magic!

253
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:05,569
<i>Under the light
of the Spanish moon...</i>

254
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:11,003
<i>it's for love that I croon this tune,
Lucille...</i>

255
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,847
<i>Lucille...</i>

256
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:16,643
<i>Lucille...</i>

257
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:24,554
I'm terribly sorry.
You must think I'm an idiot.

258
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,722
I should never have done this.

259
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:30,521
I promise you,
I shan't ever bother you again.

260
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:32,474
Robert... wait!

261
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,916
How did you know
I love flamenco?

262
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:43,400
That were beautiful,
just beautiful.

263
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:55,632
Oh, God!

264
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,831
How did you get in?

265
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:02,751
Oh, no!
Not the cold cream!

266
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:07,821
I told you guys before,
stay out of my room!

267
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,228
Stay out!

268
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:26,579
Flipping heck!

269
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:38,734
What am I going to do now?

270
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:42,099
It took me six months
to train that lot.

271
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:52,374
Not a bad little meat pattie.

272
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,414
Good shot, boss!

273
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:05,565
Your shot, Cedric!

274
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:24,323
O thought I told you
to wipe my clubs.

275
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:33,965
Take that you bastard!

276
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:43,398
Shit!

277
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:47,994
I'm on form today!

278
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,237
It's a lovely course.

279
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,959
I'm tempted to join
the club myself.

280
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,434
No chance of that,
I'm afraid, Cedric.

281
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,953
You mean they discriminate
against Scots?

282
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:02,189
No, we just don't like assholes
in the clubhouse.

283
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:07,107
Sid, it's really decent of you
to have me in for a lager...

284
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:11,144
after today's little mishap.

285
00:19:11,554 --> 00:19:14,113
No hard feelings Arthur.

286
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,144
It's just my bad luck.

287
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:19,151
This sort of thing is
always happening to me.

288
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:23,259
Did I tell you Sanyd's slapping
a paternity suit on me?

289
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,345
Is that right?

290
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,024
Yeah, she reckons that kid
she dropped is mine.

291
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:29,979
I'd like to see her prove it, though.

292
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:32,178
She's slept with half the chorus.

293
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:33,422
Has he?

294
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,737
She hasn't slept with me.

295
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:39,262
Oh, no.
I wasn't suggesting anything.

296
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:43,855
Like you're a mate, Arthur.
I know I can trust you.

297
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:47,420
Oh, Christ,
here she comes now.

298
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:57,049
Sidney, the date's been
set down as the 16th.

299
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,654
If you don't appear in court,
it'll be held over until the 21st...

300
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,407
at which time you'll be compelled
to provide a blood sample.

301
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:08,925
Sandy, why did you bring it here?
It's not mine!

302
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:11,410
You know it's not!

303
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:14,651
We'll let the court decide that,
shall we?

304
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,245
It's got your eyes, Sid.

305
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,990
<i>You want a slice of the action
but you're not acting...</i>

306
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:03,195
<i>You want a slice of the action
but you don't want to pay the price...</i>

307
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:09,148
<i>You're going to end up in traction
if you don't take my advice.</i>

308
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:11,745
<i>You want a piece of the pie...</i>

309
00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:13,912
<i>but you don't want
to share with me...</i>

310
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:17,353
<i>You want a piece of that pie...</i>

311
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,749
<i>but you'll never get
nothing for free.</i>

312
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:22,984
<i>You better watch what you say...</i>

313
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:25,229
<i>'cause that ain't my recipe.</i>

314
00:21:26,512 --> 00:21:28,979
<i>I'm hip to your lip...</i>

315
00:21:29,151 --> 00:21:30,584
<i>you'll see...</i>

316
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,664
<i>You're just a low-down snake
with a two-time repartee.</i>

317
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:42,020
<i>I'm hip to your jive,
but it don't sound hip to me.</i>

318
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:48,224
Say, who is that dame?

319
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:52,099
That's Heidi.
Ain't she something?

320
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:56,853
She's only been here a week
and already she's packing the joint.

321
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,098
With a voice like that
she's going to go places!

322
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:03,570
<i>You want a hot potato,
but baby you're just too cold.</i>

323
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,178
<i>You want a hot potato
to go with your sausage roll.</i>

324
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:14,332
<i>Don't look at me baby,
I'm much too hot to hold.</i>

325
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:19,014
<i>I'm hip to your lip...</i>

326
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,285
<i>you'll see...</i>

327
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:23,567
Yeah!

328
00:22:25,254 --> 00:22:27,084
Thank you!

329
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:31,803
From the gentleman
with the red carnation.

330
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:36,281
So, you're from the East?

331
00:22:36,411 --> 00:22:38,878
I hear they've got some
great swamps out that way.

332
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,126
What's a cute young think like you
doing in the big smoke?

333
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:46,003
I'm not so young.
In two years I'll be eighteen.

334
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:48,806
Really?
But you're so well developed...

335
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:51,238
Vocally, I mean.

336
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:54,357
My singing teachers said
I've enormous lung power.

337
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:57,078
I like your style, Heidi.

338
00:22:57,524 --> 00:23:00,117
- Really?
- You've got a lot of class.

339
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:02,074
But that sometimes ain't enough.

340
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:04,921
I seen a lot of girls like you
ruined in this town.

341
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:07,077
You need to make
the right connections,,,

342
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:08,714
and that's where I can help.

343
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,152
Are you a producer?

344
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:16,829
I am to be the best goddam producer
this town has ever seen.

345
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,073
I got the contacts,
I got the capital...

346
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,586
what I need is what you got:

347
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,195
Talent!

348
00:23:23,516 --> 00:23:27,110
Heidi, I want to manage you.

349
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:29,063
But...

350
00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:31,822
I don't even know who you are!

351
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,223
They call me Bletch!

352
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:41,027
Bletch!
What a lovely name!

353
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,708
Tell me Heidi...

354
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,708
do those lips kiss as good
as they sing?

355
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:53,946
Bletch!

356
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:11,976
Very nice, Mr. Bletch.

357
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:15,888
Perhaps you'd like to inspect
my range of clubs.

358
00:24:25,217 --> 00:24:27,855
It's good gear,
I can assure you.

359
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:29,694
O that I have no doubts.

360
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:31,328
It's good stuff boss.

361
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:33,812
When can we expect delivery?

362
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,885
Meet Louie in the alleyway
at six.

363
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,442
Sorry.
A touch of the ptomaine.

364
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:59,916
It must be all this fresh air.
It gives me hay fever.

365
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:06,758
Bad luck old chap!

366
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,360
What the?

367
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,753
My apologies Cedric!

368
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,029
I had a bone stuck in my throat.

369
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,436
My game, I think.

370
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:25,952
Shit!

371
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:33,950
Did I pass the audition,
Mr. Bletch?

372
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:40,385
Oh, harder Harry, oh!

373
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:42,788
Oh, yes, yes, oh!

374
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:44,028
Harry!

375
00:25:45,832 --> 00:25:49,187
All those carrots
make me good in the dark.

376
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:51,824
But it feels so good!

377
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,867
They don't call it "bunnylingus"
for nothing, sweetheart.

378
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:57,661
What about me?
Are you going to service me too?

379
00:25:57,788 --> 00:26:00,347
Sure, climb on up and
I'll give you a valve grind.

380
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:04,136
Hey!
Hold on a moment!

381
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:05,979
What's going on?
I can't see.

382
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:09,624
Goddamn pervert!

383
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:10,938
Who was it, Harry?

384
00:26:11,064 --> 00:26:13,531
Just a little creep
with a bad case of jizm pressure.

385
00:26:13,663 --> 00:26:15,938
How's your jizm pressure,
Harry?

386
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:18,132
I can feel it coming on.

387
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:21,492
Oh, boy,
it's going to be a gusher!

388
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,019
Oh, no!

389
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:33,329
No, no!

390
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:39,094
No, help!

391
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:40,648
Take that!

392
00:26:42,694 --> 00:26:45,003
Oh, no!

393
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:47,843
Take that, you bitch!

394
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:51,966
I beg you, please now stop it!

395
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:53,809
Call me "sir", slut!

396
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:54,886
Ow!

397
00:26:55,011 --> 00:27:00,242
Leave her alone!
Are you all right, madam?

398
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,928
Cut!

399
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:05,166
Jesus Christ!

400
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:09,074
You've a nasty habit of sticking
your nose in where it's not wanted.

401
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:11,242
I'm sorry.

402
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:14,595
You ruined my take, kid.
I never do two takes!

403
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:17,200
I didn't know it was a film.

404
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:19,598
Hurry it up,
I'm freezing!

405
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:23,870
I'm sorry for interrupting.
I won't disturb you any longer.

406
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,631
We'll skip the whipping.

407
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:28,039
Let's move on to the blowjob.

408
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,878
Where's the Masked Masochist?

409
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,987
Oh Christ that's all I need!

410
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:35,147
He's carked!

411
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,349
Didn't you realise
you were sitting on his face?

412
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:42,344
I felt a bit uncomfortable, but
I thought it was my haemorrhoids.

413
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:45,831
What the hell, maybe I can sell it
as a snuff movie.

414
00:27:54,312 --> 00:27:56,303
You'll have to find a substitute.

415
00:27:56,432 --> 00:27:58,228
I don't do self abuse.

416
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:03,940
No sorries, Daisy.
I know just the guy.

417
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:25,016
What do you know!
It's Dennis on a smelly minge binge.

418
00:28:25,143 --> 00:28:28,532
Oh gosh! I was just looking
for the soap powder.

419
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:31,539
Sure, Dennis.
Have a whiff of these.

420
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:34,936
They've got
a real distinctive bouquet.

421
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,457
Dennis,
we've got a little job for you.

422
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:25,480
Oh my god!
Next!

423
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,474
All right everybody,
from the top!

424
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,594
Music, please!

425
00:30:26,345 --> 00:30:27,300
For Chrissake!

426
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,416
What the hell was wrong
with that?

427
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:33,615
Who is holding
that red pennant?

428
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:37,851
Me sir.

429
00:30:37,982 --> 00:30:40,700
And what on earth do you think
you're doing?

430
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:42,776
I'm patrolling the moat, sir.

431
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,931
Patrolling the moat?
I see.

432
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:50,212
You were instructed to stay
upstage left.

433
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:53,653
Italian pennant bearers of
the XVll century were frequently...

434
00:30:53,777 --> 00:30:57,529
known to patrol the rampart
on the lookout for Turkish invaders.

435
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,566
How very elucidating.

436
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,651
I've been reading up on it, sir.

437
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:03,492
My drama teacher at school
said...

438
00:31:03,574 --> 00:31:05,848
I should always research
a role thoroughly.

439
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:08,167
Really?
Let me tell you something.

440
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:10,805
This is a television variety show...

441
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:13,445
not a homage to Soviet Realism!

442
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,800
I asked for a pennant,
not a pedant!

443
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,199
All right, again!
From the top!

444
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:29,355
Excuse me!

445
00:31:29,726 --> 00:31:30,714
Stop!

446
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:31,880
Shit!

447
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:33,198
Oh, God!

448
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,313
What is it?

449
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:38,842
It's just I'm having trouble
with my motivation.

450
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:41,910
I don't understand
why I would remain still...

451
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:45,277
when the scene itself suggests
vigorous physical action...

452
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:46,709
danger even.

453
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,717
I suppose you'd like everyone
to stop singing...

454
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,115
while you come forward to do
a little war dance centre stage.

455
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:54,193
Is that it?

456
00:31:54,318 --> 00:31:56,114
Well, it had crossed my mind!

457
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:57,590
My god!

458
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:00,230
Sorry guy, I hate to interrupt,
but I don't think...

459
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:03,113
the knife thrower's assistant
is going to pull through.

460
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:05,869
Shall I cancel Winyard's act
entirely?

461
00:32:06,154 --> 00:32:07,712
I think not.

462
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:10,666
I've got just the substitute.

463
00:32:15,871 --> 00:32:18,430
"Dennis Does Daisy!
Take 1.

464
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,302
Dennis, drop your strides.

465
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:23,905
Come on, come on,
the camera's rolling.

466
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,825
Oh for Chrissake!

467
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:30,824
Is that the best you can do?

468
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:32,584
Trevor do something about this guy!

469
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:34,025
Come on, get aroused!

470
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:35,660
I can't.

471
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:38,582
Well, I'm not doing anything
until he cracks a fat.

472
00:32:38,704 --> 00:32:40,820
What's the matter?
Doesn't she turn you on?

473
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:45,298
Here you go.
Will these help?

474
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:48,141
Oh god, not another panty-sniffer!

475
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:50,774
He's going to want me
to piss in his mouth next.

476
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,538
Ok kid, do your stuff.

477
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:56,692
Oh yes!
Yes! ¡

478
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:00,210
Oh, God!
It's terrible!

479
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:03,249
I feel terrible!
What's happening to me?

480
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:06,129
What's the matter, Harry?
Not feeling too well?

481
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,526
What?
Who said that?

482
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,412
It's all those last nights.

483
00:33:10,494 --> 00:33:13,167
Maybe you're not getting
enough vitamins.

484
00:33:15,413 --> 00:33:17,642
Care to join me for lunch?

485
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:26,207
Hmm, carrots!
It's not one of yours, is it Harry?

486
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:27,842
You are sick!

487
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:30,277
No, Harry.
I think you are.

488
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,404
Give me the rundown
on your symptoms.

489
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:36,280
I ain't got nothing,
you shit-eating journo.

490
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:39,522
You can't suppress the media,
Harry.

491
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:45,912
Come on, you can tell me,
I'll be very discreet.

492
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm as fit as a fiddle.
I feel fantastic.

493
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:51,033
And I'm sick and tired of your...

494
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,310
Hold it right there!

495
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:54,432
"I'm tired and I'm sick",
says Harry...

496
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:56,988
the Hare star of
the Feebles Variety Hour.

497
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,509
Sounds like the germs
of a good story.

498
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,714
Leave me alone!

499
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:03,317
You can't hide the truth.

500
00:34:03,438 --> 00:34:06,509
Whatever you've got, I'll find it out
or I'll make it up.

501
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:14,232
This is going to be a great scoop!

502
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,311
Jesus Trevor,
have you got the stuff?

503
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,990
I'm hanging out, man.

504
00:34:22,152 --> 00:34:24,824
I'll get you the money tomorrow,
I promise.

505
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:27,107
Hello, my name's Robert.

506
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:30,501
- Are you the new supplier?
- I've been sent by the director...

507
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,063
to assist you in your
knife-throwing routine.

508
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:36,987
- Oh, shit!
- I wondered if you'd like to practice.

509
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:40,418
No, I don't know, man,
I really don't know.

510
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:43,106
It's not such a hot idea.

511
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:47,096
- Have you got any smack?
- Smack?

512
00:34:47,224 --> 00:34:49,943
Horse, liquid sky,
skag...

513
00:34:50,064 --> 00:34:52,861
snow, coke, crack,
methadone...

514
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:54,301
benzedrine, pinkies, San Ped...

515
00:34:54,462 --> 00:34:56,339
Morning Glory, nutmeg,
blue meanies...

516
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:58,776
aspirin, Ados, paracetamol...

517
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:01,211
Vicks Vapour Rub?

518
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:06,809
Oh, you don't happen to be
an asthmatic by any chance?

519
00:35:07,978 --> 00:35:10,093
Could I borrow your huffer?

520
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:11,366
I don't take drugs of any sort.

521
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:14,135
I don't believe it's right
to abuse your body like that.

522
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:16,723
Oh, that's easy for you to say.

523
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,409
You haven't been to hell and back.

524
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,092
- Eh?
- Nam!

525
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:24,842
- You've been to Vietnam?
- I saw the worst of it, kid.

526
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:32,081
Tet Offensive 1968.

527
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,409
Charlie had our backs
against the wall!

528
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:37,759
There were six of us.

529
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,686
No, there were five of us.

530
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:46,436
Every gook north of Saigon
was drawing a bead on us.

531
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:06,239
Winyard!
Cover me!

532
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,714
Jim! ¡Jim!

533
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:23,870
Thanks Jim, I owe you one!

534
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:27,463
I wasn't about to see my best buddy
peppered with Charlie's lead.

535
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:34,102
Three weeks later...

536
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:37,859
we were on a routine patrol
north of Tai Pang.

537
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,379
Charlie was close...

538
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:44,547
so close
you could almost smell him.

539
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:58,063
Where's Eightball?

540
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,981
We better go back and look for him.

541
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,537
Eightball!
Thank God!

542
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,253
We thought the gooks
had got you, Eightball.

543
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:21,846
Drop your weapons and put your hands up
revisionist running dogs.

544
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:32,809
In the days that followed
I wished a thousand times...

545
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:36,208
that it was my head
on that stake.

546
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:41,200
Re-education time
for fascist imperialists.

547
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:46,241
You... read...

548
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:48,924
You... read.

549
00:37:49,928 --> 00:37:53,158
I can't see, you bastards!

550
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:07,241
We didn't see Chuck for two days.

551
00:38:07,362 --> 00:38:09,318
We thought he was a goner.

552
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:13,275
But then on the third night
they brought him back to us.

553
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:21,748
The bastards had taken his legs.

554
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:28,067
I still say that private enterprise...

555
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:31,153
is acceptable
at a village level...

556
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,425
providing it is strictly controlled
by the party.

557
00:38:35,194 --> 00:38:40,061
We must not let petty
bourgeois aspirations...

558
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,263
taint socialist pedagogy.

559
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:48,022
Reform is the enemy
of revolution.

560
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:54,223
The one hadn't finished with us yet.

561
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:58,784
Their twisted communist minds
had devised one last torture.

562
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:36,849
As I stared down
the muzzle of that gun...

563
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,647
I thought of Chuck and Eightball...

564
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:42,122
and the thousands of others
who had perished...

565
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:45,562
in that godforsaken wilderness.

566
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:49,051
I was not afraid to join them.

567
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:02,526
Let's go out of here1

568
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,238
Help me!

569
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:20,991
Come on buddy, help me up!

570
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:25,677
Winyard! Winyard!
Don't leave me!

571
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,869
Please!
Dear god-no!

572
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:46,392
It was six months before
I got out that Saigon hospital.

573
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:51,068
By then I was hooked
on every barbiturate known to man.

574
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:53,421
Gosh!
What an awful time you've had!

575
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,779
Hey kid...

576
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:59,221
you want to express your sympathy
in some kind of material away?

577
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:00,868
How can I do that?

578
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:02,819
Vietnam Vets Association.

579
00:41:03,468 --> 00:41:06,061
We're badly under-funded.

580
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:13,857
Minimum donation fifty bucks.

581
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:18,942
Thanks, kid.

582
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,656
The Association was in bad need...

583
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:23,852
of a cash injection.

584
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,935
Ooh! Ooh!
What an organ!

585
00:41:37,777 --> 00:41:41,769
Do you really think people
are interested in nasal sex?

586
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,887
Sure boss.
It's the latest fad.

587
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:46,164
You got a title?

588
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,286
I thought:
"Dennis Does Daisy".

589
00:41:49,414 --> 00:41:50,971
Nah, that's lousy.

590
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:54,129
Well how about:

591
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,565
"Anal Antics"?

592
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:58,010
Not bad.

593
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:59,769
It's got a certain ring to it.

594
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:02,688
It'll appeal to the intellectuals.

595
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,318
Do you think it'll do as well as
our last release...

596
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:07,200
and win the Hooker Prize?

597
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:12,166
You know I'm worried
about Madame Bovine.

598
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:14,800
We've lost money on
hr last two pictures.

599
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:17,155
You want her replaced, boss?

600
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,117
I think the public are tired
of big udders.

601
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:22,996
Find someone young and petite.

602
00:42:26,482 --> 00:42:29,234
Sure thing, boss.

603
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:32,313
Bring on the next act!

604
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,194
It's the contortionist,
Arbee Bargwan.

605
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,958
I told him he wasn't needed
for half an hour.

606
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,636
He'll be meditating.

607
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:42,351
Well you'll just have
to interrupt him, won't you?

608
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:46,115
Never mind.
I'll get him myself.

609
00:42:52,074 --> 00:42:55,782
Arbee darling,
I hate to intrude upon nirvana...

610
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:57,744
but you're needed on stage.

611
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:02,183
Please don't interrupt me.
I am travelling on the astral plane.

612
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:06,544
Perhaps you could change
your flight plan...

613
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,223
and grace us mere mortals
with your presence.

614
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:11,816
I'm impervious to your cynicism.

615
00:43:11,948 --> 00:43:14,666
Listen to me,
you double-jointed freak!

616
00:43:14,787 --> 00:43:17,176
If you're not on stage
in five minutes...

617
00:43:17,307 --> 00:43:20,775
you can consider yourself permanently
disembodied from the show.

618
00:43:21,585 --> 00:43:22,813
Hey!

619
00:43:51,376 --> 00:43:54,094
Oh good gracious, Harry!

620
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:56,569
Somebody call a doctor!

621
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:59,124
How are we feeling, Harry?

622
00:43:59,573 --> 00:44:03,724
I feel real bad, Doc.
What have I got.

623
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:07,400
I'll do some tests,
but I don't hold out much hope.

624
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:10,761
There's only one disease
that fits these symptoms.

625
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,527
It's the big one, Harry.

626
00:44:12,649 --> 00:44:14,446
No!
Not the big one!

627
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,036
I'll have to notify
the health authorities.

628
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:19,283
They'll want a list of
your sexual partners...

629
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:22,006
for the last twelve months.

630
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,242
It can't be true!
It can't be!

631
00:44:24,406 --> 00:44:26,316
I've taken precautions!

632
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,684
Ah, tell me Doc...

633
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:31,958
how long have I got?

634
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,755
It's difficult to tell...

635
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,396
but with a case
as advanced as yours...

636
00:44:36,522 --> 00:44:38,796
ten,
maybe twelve...

637
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:41,071
- Months?
- Hours.

638
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,192
I'm sorry, Harry.

639
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,916
Doc, can you do me
one favour

640
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:49,393
Sure Harry, shoot.

641
00:44:49,518 --> 00:44:53,715
Don't tell anyone.
Let me do the show tonight.

642
00:44:53,837 --> 00:44:55,315
OK Harry.

643
00:44:55,516 --> 00:44:59,747
I want to go out
with my reputation intact.

644
00:45:01,914 --> 00:45:04,222
Fat chance Harry!

645
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,625
All right then Arbee,
thrill me!

646
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:17,861
Hippy shit!

647
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:46,170
Sorry Guv.
Should I start again?

648
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,177
Move on, move on.

649
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:11,572
Oh dear!

650
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:14,204
Are you all right up there?

651
00:46:14,332 --> 00:46:17,960
I seem to have stuck
my head up rectum.

652
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,479
You mean it's not part of your act?
Pity.

653
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:26,917
We could call it:
"Passage to India".

654
00:46:27,728 --> 00:46:29,763
Come on, come on, uncontort!

655
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:32,077
Somebody help him!

656
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,197
It's no good Guv,
he's stuck fast.

657
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:40,443
I am in need of assistance here,
please.

658
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:44,476
Oh god, this is it!
This is the last straw!

659
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,628
Bletch!

660
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:56,233
We've got to talk!

661
00:46:56,879 --> 00:46:58,436
We've got a crisis on our hands!

662
00:46:59,118 --> 00:47:01,187
Winyard's killed his assistant.

663
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:02,636
Arbee's out of action...

664
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:05,316
Sid's routine is
a complete write-off!!

665
00:47:05,596 --> 00:47:09,508
We've got no alternative but
to reinstate my song!

666
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:10,589
No!

667
00:47:10,674 --> 00:47:11,743
Bletch, I'm sorry...

668
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:14,228
but the show is
in a shambles!

669
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:16,469
This is a family show,
for Chrissake!

670
00:47:16,553 --> 00:47:18,508
The network would never allow it.

671
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:20,940
But it's a superb piece of song
and dance...

672
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:23,339
It'll go down fabulously
with the public.

673
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,705
I demand it be included!

674
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:29,583
Keep your filthy paws
off my furniture!

675
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,339
We've got a wonderful new
interpretation.

676
00:47:32,468 --> 00:47:35,300
It sort of goes like this.
Watch.

677
00:47:36,266 --> 00:47:38,541
The chorus come sin stage left...

678
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:42,582
and there's a lovely little bit
with a piano...

679
00:47:42,784 --> 00:47:45,218
and that's where I come in
from upstage.

680
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:47,015
And I sort of pirouette...

681
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:49,417
and the strings are swirling
around me...

682
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:50,855
and if you can imagine...

683
00:47:50,982 --> 00:47:53,859
and the cellos re coming in
and it's just...

684
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:57,209
And I leap across la la!

685
00:47:58,899 --> 00:48:02,254
I say, Bletch,
put me down!

686
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:06,767
I've had just about enough
of your goddamn compositions.

687
00:48:07,057 --> 00:48:11,015
Now get back on the stage
and do your job!

688
00:48:13,815 --> 00:48:16,408
It's your loss, Philistine!

689
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:17,683
Faggot!

690
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:32,157
Good morning, Frau Heidi!
What will it be today?

691
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:36,322
Just one of those tiny truffles,
please.

692
00:48:39,327 --> 00:48:41,237
This one...

693
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:22,350
Will that be all, Frau Heidi?

694
00:49:22,474 --> 00:49:24,145
Something to take away, maybe?

695
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:28,623
The black forest cherry cake?

696
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:39,061
Hi Harry!
Just doing a bit of undercover work.

697
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:41,656
Heh!
That rash on your groin...

698
00:49:41,748 --> 00:49:42,941
Iooks pretty ugly...

699
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:45,534
and don't taste too good neither.

700
00:49:45,826 --> 00:49:48,420
Get out of my bed, you parasite!

701
00:49:48,545 --> 00:49:51,059
Hold it right here, Harry.
That's great!

702
00:49:54,584 --> 00:49:56,653
Me nuts!

703
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:02,221
I was sorry to hear
about your fatal disease.

704
00:50:02,341 --> 00:50:03,694
Do you have any comments?

705
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:05,139
It's a slander,
it's libel!

706
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,455
I have no fatal disease!
I'm perfectly healthy!

707
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:13,174
Let me just see what
Dr. Quack had to say.

708
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:14,287
Quote:

709
00:50:15,657 --> 00:50:18,568
"There's only one disease
that fits these symptoms.

710
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:20,574
It's the big one, Harry."

711
00:50:20,656 --> 00:50:21,770
Unquote.

712
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:25,446
Move your hand away.

713
00:50:25,574 --> 00:50:27,723
I want some shots of real tears.

714
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:29,650
Want do you want from me?
Money?

715
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:31,967
I'll pay you anything.

716
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:33,207
Sorry, Harry.

717
00:50:33,332 --> 00:50:35,799
You could never pay me
what this story's worth.

718
00:50:36,331 --> 00:50:37,683
Wait! Wait!

719
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,198
I'll give you
my life insurance policy.

720
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,638
Life insurance?
Now you're talking.

721
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:45,805
Come over here,
I'll sign it over to you.

722
00:50:45,928 --> 00:50:48,760
Great, I'll be able to cash it
in this time tomorrow.

723
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:52,239
Nice try, Harry!

724
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:54,720
I've got to go, we both
have deadlines to meet.

725
00:50:54,845 --> 00:50:57,199
Get it, Harry?
"Deadline".

726
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,317
That's not a bad one.
Stop press!

727
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:03,002
Hold the front page!
I got an exclusive!

728
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,553
Here!
You stuck it in the wrong way round!

729
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:20,950
I'm sorry.
I didn't know worms had nerves.

730
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:24,625
Since the nightmare of Vietnam
he's been a hopeless drug addict.

731
00:51:24,796 --> 00:51:28,265
It made me realise
just how lucky I am.

732
00:51:28,395 --> 00:51:31,192
How lucky we both are!

733
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:36,551
I'm so glad we decided
to get engaged.

734
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:39,428
Good luck for tonight, Lucy.

735
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:41,586
- Are you nervous?
- Just a bit.

736
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:42,779
Me too.

737
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,424
Actually I'm terribly nervous.

738
00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:47,268
This is my first show.

739
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:50,146
You'll be wonderful.
I know you will.

740
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:07,538
I hope I'm not interrupting.

741
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:09,937
I was just dressing
for the show.

742
00:52:10,062 --> 00:52:11,130
So I see.

743
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,376
What do you want?

744
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:15,090
A moment of your time.

745
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,813
We've got something
to celebrate.

746
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:20,447
- What's that?
- Your new career.

747
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:24,252
Lucille, I'm going to put you
in the movies.

748
00:52:24,377 --> 00:52:25,571
Movies!

749
00:52:25,697 --> 00:52:27,891
I've been watching you
for some time.

750
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:30,364
You've got
that indefinable something.

751
00:52:30,895 --> 00:52:32,851
Star quality!

752
00:52:33,614 --> 00:52:37,208
That's my real ambition,
to be in films!

753
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:39,926
I've got a meaty part for you.

754
00:52:40,052 --> 00:52:42,725
Will I have to audition?

755
00:52:42,852 --> 00:52:45,411
That's what I'm here for.

756
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:48,727
I feel woozy.

757
00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:53,406
Let me loosen your clothes.

758
00:52:53,528 --> 00:52:58,521
What beautiful white fur
you've got, my dear.

759
00:53:00,806 --> 00:53:02,159
Lucille, you left this...

760
00:53:02,286 --> 00:53:05,004
Hike!
Can't you see that we're busy?

761
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:07,196
- Lucille!
- Oh, Jesus!

762
00:53:07,724 --> 00:53:10,840
- Robert!
- You've been drinking.

763
00:53:12,162 --> 00:53:15,074
It's OK.
I've finished with her anyway.

764
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:18,989
Oh, go for your life, kid.
She's a real good ride.

765
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,557
- How could you do this?
- Robert!

766
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,552
Lucille, ho could you?

767
00:53:25,678 --> 00:53:27,555
No!
Robert!

768
00:53:28,078 --> 00:53:29,795
Wait!

769
00:53:30,357 --> 00:53:33,632
Where's she for God's sake?
Look at the time!

770
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:36,747
It's all right, Guv.
Miss Heidi's arrived on stage.

771
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:39,786
At last!
From the top!

772
00:53:50,471 --> 00:53:52,938
<i>On a magic night...</i>

773
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:56,142
<i>when the way you feel...</i>

774
00:53:56,589 --> 00:53:58,624
<i>is a mystery...</i>

775
00:53:59,748 --> 00:54:02,545
<i>that will be revealed...</i>

776
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:05,459
<i>Could be an angel...</i>

777
00:54:05,586 --> 00:54:08,577
<i>from up above...</i>

778
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:12,980
<i>with a flower...</i>

779
00:54:13,264 --> 00:54:15,219
<i>from the garden of love.</i>

780
00:54:18,262 --> 00:54:21,378
<i>Garden of love...</i>

781
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:31,567
<i>On another day...</i>

782
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:34,370
<i>it may come again...</i>

783
00:54:36,456 --> 00:54:38,492
<i>It's a Valentine...</i>

784
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:40,893
<i>from a special friend.</i>

785
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:44,490
<i>That certain someone...</i>

786
00:54:45,614 --> 00:54:47,649
<i>you'be been thinking of...</i>

787
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:52,167
<i>with a flower from the garden...</i>

788
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:55,363
<i>the garden of love...</i>

789
00:54:58,889 --> 00:55:03,564
<i>garden of love...</i>

790
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:13,717
<i>There are mysteries
that no one knows...</i>

791
00:55:14,805 --> 00:55:19,354
<i>someone offers you
a simple rose...</i>

792
00:55:19,523 --> 00:55:23,720
<i>There's no limit to...</i>

793
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:53,871
It wasn't my fault.

794
00:55:53,992 --> 00:55:56,824
You've been over-eating again

795
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:57,946
No I haven't.

796
00:55:59,391 --> 00:56:02,985
There is black forest cherry cake
in your cleavage.

797
00:56:03,749 --> 00:56:05,102
How did that get there?

798
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:07,537
You know what chocolate
does to your system.

799
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:09,739
It was only a small wedge.

800
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,062
Your contract states
you are forbidden...

801
00:56:12,147 --> 00:56:14,341
to eat gateaux
on the day of a performance.

802
00:56:14,426 --> 00:56:17,178
- I was depressed.
- You're depressed!

803
00:56:17,305 --> 00:56:21,183
We're going out live in three hours,
for godsake.

804
00:56:21,304 --> 00:56:24,534
Don't speak to me like that.
You don't understand.

805
00:56:24,663 --> 00:56:27,381
None of you understand!

806
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:31,658
Bletch... Bletch...

807
00:56:31,981 --> 00:56:36,609
Suddenly I feel very very old.

808
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:43,407
Bletch!
Don't you want to have me?

809
00:56:43,537 --> 00:56:45,016
I must talk to you.

810
00:56:45,137 --> 00:56:46,649
Say you love only me!

811
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:48,129
Don't you love me?

812
00:56:48,256 --> 00:56:50,211
Don't you, Bletch?

813
00:56:50,935 --> 00:56:53,323
Oh... er...

814
00:56:53,454 --> 00:56:55,250
Bletch?

815
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:07,725
No!

816
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,680
Heidi!
It's not what you think.

817
00:57:10,129 --> 00:57:11,084
Heidi!

818
00:57:24,364 --> 00:57:26,320
Miss Heidi,
what on earth's the matter?

819
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:35,280
Damn!

820
00:57:58,714 --> 00:58:00,590
What took you so long?

821
00:58:00,713 --> 00:58:03,180
We were starting to think
you weren't going to show.

822
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:08,146
We had some trouble
with Customs snooping around.

823
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,305
Is it all there?

824
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,943
Yeah, yeah.
It's all there.

825
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,139
I've got to go.

826
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:13,827
Not so fast.

827
00:58:14,109 --> 00:58:16,224
It's all there, I tell you.

828
00:58:16,628 --> 00:58:19,380
What's the hurry, Louie?

829
00:58:21,307 --> 00:58:24,742
It's one hundred per cent
pure-uncut.

830
00:58:24,866 --> 00:58:26,344
I'm sure it is.

831
00:58:26,465 --> 00:58:28,773
Barry, do me a line.

832
00:58:41,181 --> 00:58:43,250
Some contracts
for you to sign, Mr. Bletch.

833
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,859
Here Dennis.
I've got a little treat for you.

834
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,328
Don't mind if I do Mr. Bletch.

835
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:20,523
Borax!

836
00:59:20,768 --> 00:59:22,998
Honest to God,
I didn't know.

837
00:59:23,128 --> 00:59:24,845
I'm as surprised as you are.

838
00:59:25,127 --> 00:59:28,084
Please Mr. Bletch,
let's talk about this.

839
00:59:28,206 --> 00:59:30,003
I think that's a very good idea.

840
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:31,962
Where's the merchandise?

841
00:59:32,805 --> 00:59:36,160
It's... it's...

842
00:59:36,284 --> 00:59:37,955
Speak up.
I can't hear you.

843
00:59:39,323 --> 00:59:41,631
It's down on the docks.

844
00:59:41,762 --> 00:59:44,833
Mr. Big's shipping it out
tonight.

845
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:46,155
Whereabouts on the docks?

846
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,839
Shed 11.

847
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,393
There, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

848
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:55,828
What are we going to do
with all this borax?

849
00:59:56,557 --> 00:59:58,752
You seem a bit congested, Louie.

850
00:59:58,877 --> 01:00:01,390
Maybe your passages need
cleaning.

851
01:00:01,716 --> 01:00:03,387
I don't understand.

852
01:00:03,715 --> 01:00:05,307
Say "ah".

853
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,550
Oh, no... no!

854
01:00:07,754 --> 01:00:11,143
No, Mr. Bletch, please!

855
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:24,139
You liquidated him real good,
boss.

856
01:00:32,346 --> 01:00:35,940
I think it's time we paid out
Mr. Big a visit.

857
01:00:39,504 --> 01:00:40,539
Bletch...

858
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:44,611
- I'm sorry, the show's off.
- What are you talking about?

859
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:45,936
Heidi refuses to perform.

860
01:00:46,022 --> 01:00:49,696
The network won't proceed without her
and cancel the transmission.

861
01:00:49,781 --> 01:00:51,611
What do you mean?
Of course she'll perform.

862
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,735
I'm sorry Bletch.

863
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:56,454
She's locked herself in her room
and won't talk to anyone.

864
01:00:57,259 --> 01:00:59,488
Give me five minutes.

865
01:01:00,617 --> 01:01:03,006
It's all over.
Go home everybody.

866
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:04,285
It's kaput.

867
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:05,769
Finito!
Buggered!

868
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:08,329
It's all off!

869
01:01:08,775 --> 01:01:11,846
Oh my goodness!
Steady me, Barton.

870
01:01:12,094 --> 01:01:14,812
I think I'm going to faint.

871
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:18,843
Heidi!
It's Bletch!

872
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:29,045
Heidi,
I want to make love to you.

873
01:01:29,169 --> 01:01:31,159
Oh, Bletch!

874
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:35,803
You drive me crazy.
Come over here and undo my buttons!

875
01:01:38,806 --> 01:01:41,558
You mad impetuous brute!

876
01:01:42,604 --> 01:01:45,038
I knew you'd come.

877
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,951
Somebody call the network.

878
01:02:10,076 --> 01:02:13,385
The show will go on!

879
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:36,421
So I got out my razor
and slit his throat.

880
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:38,981
Then I buggered the bastard.

881
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:41,545
Oh, strut Cedric.

882
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:44,133
It's bad enough getting wasted,
but...

883
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:48,382
to have your last living memory
being rooted by a Scots psychopath...

884
01:02:48,504 --> 01:02:51,540
it's what I call a real bummer,
mate.

885
01:02:51,943 --> 01:02:54,331
What's that?

886
01:02:55,782 --> 01:02:57,055
Bastards!

887
01:03:51,405 --> 01:03:54,123
I'm buggered!

888
01:03:58,762 --> 01:04:01,356
Right men, let's load up.

889
01:04:15,357 --> 01:04:17,075
That's the lot, boss.

890
01:04:17,637 --> 01:04:19,513
Time we made ourselves scarce.

891
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:29,388
Aaah!

892
01:04:29,513 --> 01:04:31,230
Oh, no!

893
01:04:31,352 --> 01:04:35,060
Help me boss!

894
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,381
Move it, Trevor!

895
01:04:44,228 --> 01:04:47,299
Oh Jesus!
Shit!

896
01:04:49,587 --> 01:04:51,224
Drive, for Chrissake!

897
01:04:53,545 --> 01:04:54,898
Plant boot!

898
01:05:00,983 --> 01:05:03,815
God I hate arachnids!

899
01:05:24,376 --> 01:05:26,445
Christ-it's Mr. Big!

900
01:05:29,014 --> 01:05:33,131
Hello Bletch.
Where are you going?

901
01:05:33,253 --> 01:05:36,164
I'm taking what's mine.
Don't try to stop us.

902
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:40,409
You're out of your league,
little fella.

903
01:05:40,531 --> 01:05:43,124
Kiss your arse goodbye!

904
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,205
Take him out Trevor.

905
01:05:53,647 --> 01:05:57,275
Change down Trevor,
the duodenum's pretty steep.

906
01:06:03,164 --> 01:06:05,074
Which way, boss?
Left or right?

907
01:06:05,163 --> 01:06:06,312
Follow the light.

908
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,990
Get me back to the theatre
double quick!

909
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,518
Sure thing, boss.

910
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,190
I'll have to change my suit.
I'm covered in ambergris.

911
01:06:26,517 --> 01:06:28,711
Where's Harry?
He's meant to be here!

912
01:06:28,836 --> 01:06:31,110
Move the carrot to the left.
Have you focused the spot?

913
01:06:31,235 --> 01:06:33,112
Where's Harry for God's sake?

914
01:06:33,235 --> 01:06:35,509
Don't look like
Harry's going to perform.

915
01:06:35,634 --> 01:06:36,907
He's had a bad turn.

916
01:06:37,033 --> 01:06:38,261
No problem...

917
01:06:38,393 --> 01:06:40,701
We'll bring forward
"The Garden of Love".

918
01:06:40,832 --> 01:06:42,504
We're on a roll everybody.

919
01:06:43,191 --> 01:06:46,500
Miss Heidi, you look radiant.

920
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:49,541
Dorothy, I feel radiant!

921
01:06:49,669 --> 01:06:52,785
Tonight will be
the performance of my life!

922
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:56,026
- Kill me if you want to, Harry.
- It's too lat.

923
01:06:56,187 --> 01:06:59,383
It won't make any difference.
The story's already gone to press.

924
01:06:59,866 --> 01:07:02,618
You overgrown maggot!
You're bluffing!

925
01:07:02,745 --> 01:07:04,224
Am I Harry?

926
01:07:04,345 --> 01:07:05,902
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

927
01:07:06,024 --> 01:07:08,618
Famous Feeble has
death row sex disease!

928
01:07:08,784 --> 01:07:13,697
Congratulations,
you're front-page news.

929
01:07:14,102 --> 01:07:16,774
Extra, extra!
Read all about it!

930
01:07:17,341 --> 01:07:20,138
Extra!
¡Extra, extra!

931
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,978
Sex disease strikes
Feeble fraternity.

932
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:25,248
Thank you, ma'am.
Extra, extra!

933
01:07:25,378 --> 01:07:27,289
Sex disease...
Thank you, sir.

934
01:07:30,497 --> 01:07:33,374
Jesus Christ!
Do you know anything about this?

935
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:34,848
Not a thing, boss.

936
01:07:34,975 --> 01:07:38,762
Why couldn't that bed-hopping bunny
keep his member to himself?

937
01:07:38,894 --> 01:07:40,646
Who wrote this crap?

938
01:07:40,774 --> 01:07:42,411
I've got a good idea, boss.

939
01:07:42,573 --> 01:07:44,131
Find him!

940
01:07:45,692 --> 01:07:49,650
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

941
01:07:49,971 --> 01:07:53,007
Welcome to the newest,
the greatest...

942
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,478
the most spectacular show...

943
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:57,644
in entertainment history.

944
01:07:57,768 --> 01:07:59,724
Put your hand together...,

945
01:07:59,848 --> 01:08:03,556
for the fabulous
Feebles Variety Hour!

946
01:08:08,805 --> 01:08:12,035
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

947
01:08:12,644 --> 01:08:15,521
<i>We're not average ordinary people.</i>

948
01:08:15,643 --> 01:08:19,430
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

949
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:22,599
This is a historic moment, Arthur.

950
01:08:23,201 --> 01:08:26,874
Tonight we rocket
into superstardom!

951
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:30,388
It's an honour to be a part of it,
Mr. Bletch.

952
01:08:31,918 --> 01:08:34,750
<i>Be sure we guarantee
to amuse you.</i>

953

954
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:42,271
Hey Trev,
I've got fifty bucks, man.

955
01:08:42,395 --> 01:08:44,350
I've got to have it.
I'm on real soon.

956
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:47,624
This is serious, man.
Look at my hands.

957
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:49,391
Come with me.

958
01:08:50,432 --> 01:08:51,467
Gorblimey!

959
01:08:51,592 --> 01:08:53,900
Is that a real Havana, Mr. Bletch?

960
01:08:54,031 --> 01:08:56,464
Would you like one, Arthur?

961
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,909
Would I ever?

962
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:12,375
Thanks a million, Mr. Bletch.
You're a scholar and a gent.

963
01:09:15,744 --> 01:09:19,133
I haven't had one of these
since my twenty first.

964
01:09:21,902 --> 01:09:25,894
It's a real man's smoke,
ain't it, Mr. Bletch?

01:09:55,492 --> 01:09:58,085

01:10:04,849 --> 01:10:07,726
Bletch,
it's going fabulously!

971
01:10:07,848 --> 01:10:09,566
I've just heard
from the network.

972
01:10:09,848 --> 01:10:12,645
They've confirmed
a syndicated series!

973
01:10:12,767 --> 01:10:17,520
And the critics!
The critics are adoring it!

974
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:20,876
A syndicated series, eh?

975
01:10:21,524 --> 01:10:23,354
Well done, Sebastian.

976
01:10:23,523 --> 01:10:25,673
I can see the headlines now.

977
01:10:25,923 --> 01:10:28,197
"Director's Artistic Genius...

978

I've got to go on!

981
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,071
I've got to go on!

982
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,917
My public loves me.

983
01:10:39,038 --> 01:10:40,994
I can't disappoint them.

984
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:44,756
Robert, we have to talk.

985
01:10:44,877 --> 01:10:46,594
We've nothing to say each other.

986
01:10:46,796 --> 01:10:48,706
I want to tell you what happened.

987
01:10:48,835 --> 01:10:50,234
I thought you were nice.

988
01:10:50,355 --> 01:10:51,708
I am nice.

989
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:53,950
No, you're not.
You're loose!

990
01:10:55,153 --> 01:10:57,144
- And you drink!
- No!

991
01:10:58,273 --> 01:11:00,467
You're nothing but
a loose lush, Lucille!

992
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:03,509
And... I never want
to see you again.

993
01:11:10,749 --> 01:11:16,663
<i>The garden of love...</i>

I say everyone,
who's the dirty person...

995
01:11:31,102 --> 01:11:35,379
who did the great big stinky poo
that's blocking up the toilet?

996
01:11:35,501 --> 01:11:38,731
God Trevor, must you be
so disgusting?

997
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,417
Oh, choice!

998
01:11:49,817 --> 01:11:51,488
What are you doing?
Let me go!

999
01:11:52,256 --> 01:11:55,247
You've been telling stories again,
haven't you?

1000
01:11:55,495 --> 01:11:58,804
You got a problem with the article,
write to the editor.

1001
01:11:58,934 --> 01:12:00,730
That won't be necessary.

1002
01:12:00,853 --> 01:12:03,241
Help me!

1003
01:12:04,012 --> 01:12:07,481
What do you know, boss,
a left-wing reporter!

1004
01:12:07,611 --> 01:12:10,647
We can't have a biased press,
can we Trevor?

1005
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:11,964
No boss.

1006
01:12:19,647 --> 01:12:22,604
Now that's what I call
an impartial journalist.

1007
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:38,756
Hello Bletch!

1008
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:42,038
Heidi!
What the hell are you doing here?

1009
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,593
Congratulations!

1010
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,597
The show is a wonderful success!

1011
01:12:46,919 --> 01:12:47,988
What do you want?

1012
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:50,996
Our encounter this afternoon
was so brief!

1013
01:12:51,358 --> 01:12:54,746
I thought you might like
a second helping.

1014
01:12:55,716 --> 01:12:56,671
Heidi!

1015
01:12:56,796 --> 01:12:59,229
For Chrissake
put your dress back on!

1016
01:12:59,355 --> 01:13:01,027
Come and sit next to me.

1017
01:13:01,394 --> 01:13:04,385
If it's too hot for you,
I can turn on the air conditioning.

1018
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:08,346
I'm hot Bletch,
but not the way you think.

1019
01:13:09,432 --> 01:13:12,741
You're not feeling shy,
are you Bletch?

1020
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:17,622
Do you remember that time
in Paris?

1021
01:13:17,749 --> 01:13:21,423
We didn't leave the hotel
for three whole days!

1022
01:13:21,548 --> 01:13:22,583
I remember all right.

1023
01:13:22,668 --> 01:13:25,135
I had to go to the hospital
with severe chafing.

1024
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,620
Kiss me, Bletch!

1025
01:13:26,747 --> 01:13:29,419
Get away from me!
You shuddering mound of blubber!

1026
01:13:29,546 --> 01:13:32,662
Have you any idea
how revolting you look?

1027
01:13:32,785 --> 01:13:34,263
Bletch... no!

1028
01:13:34,384 --> 01:13:36,102
You disgust me!
Look at you!

1029
01:13:36,184 --> 01:13:39,061
You're old and you're fat...
and you smell bad...

1030
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:40,137
Aggh!

1031
01:13:40,222 --> 01:13:41,177
No!

1032
01:13:41,302 --> 01:13:43,133
I was going to wait
till after the show...

1033
01:13:43,221 --> 01:13:44,700
but I might as well tell you now.

1034
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:47,778
You're through with the Feebles!
I don't need you!

1035
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:50,367
I've got a syndicated series...

1036
01:13:50,499 --> 01:13:52,808
and I'm grooming Samantha
to be the star.

1037
01:13:53,218 --> 01:13:54,253
No!

1038
01:13:54,378 --> 01:13:57,608
I hope you enjoyed tonight.
That was your last performance!

1039
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:59,727
Now get out of here!

1040
01:14:35,085 --> 01:14:39,362
And now, someone
who needs no introduction.

1041
01:14:40,044 --> 01:14:42,273
Heeere's...

1042
01:14:42,403 --> 01:14:43,358
Well.

1043
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:45,234
...Harry...

1044
01:15:04,516 --> 01:15:06,393
Yipiii!

1045
01:15:16,313 --> 01:15:17,665
Launch!

1046
01:15:18,232 --> 01:15:20,222
Come on!
Launch the carrot!

1047
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:27,140
What am I going to do?
Oh my god!

1048
01:15:27,629 --> 01:15:30,188
Sidney, you're going to have
to fill in for a few minutes.

1049
01:15:30,628 --> 01:15:33,664
But... I've got to go the toilet.

1050
01:15:33,787 --> 01:15:35,186
Improvise!

1051
01:15:35,467 --> 01:15:36,615
Lmprovise!

1052
01:15:37,226 --> 01:15:40,456
But I've got a really weak bladder.

1053
01:15:43,024 --> 01:15:44,218
Say something!

1054
01:15:44,344 --> 01:15:46,493
Go on, say something!
Anything!

1055
01:15:47,423 --> 01:15:51,051
The show is going really well,
I think.

1056
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,134
Goodbye, Bletch.

1057
01:16:08,696 --> 01:16:12,449
We'll drop the barrel balancing act
and bring the knife throwing forward.

1058
01:16:12,575 --> 01:16:16,169
Where the hell is Winyard?
Why isn't anybody listening to me?

1059
01:16:16,854 --> 01:16:19,686
And so without further ado
please give a big hand...

1060
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:22,451
for our fabulous knife thrower.

1061
01:16:22,572 --> 01:16:23,527
Sidney!

1062
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:26,528
Oh, no!

1063
01:16:26,651 --> 01:16:28,720
You philandering bastard!

1064
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:32,404
Sandy, not in front of all the people!

1065
01:16:32,529 --> 01:16:34,996
What I have to say
I want the world to know.

1066
01:16:35,328 --> 01:16:38,205
He may look like
a lovable old pachyderm...

1067
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:39,760
but he's a steaming great shit!

1068
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,604
I don't believe it!

1069
01:16:50,723 --> 01:16:54,601
Goodbye life!
Hello death!

1070
01:17:14,636 --> 01:17:18,628
Hey Seb!
God to see you, man.

1071
01:17:18,755 --> 01:17:21,222
Pull yourself together!
You're next up!

1072
01:17:22,194 --> 01:17:26,788
Have you ever noticed
the beautiful lighting in this toilet?

1073
01:17:27,512 --> 01:17:29,627
He used me to vent
his lustful passions...

1074
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:32,219
but as soon as I was up the duff
it was another story.

1075
01:17:32,351 --> 01:17:35,660
He had his pleasure
and left me with this.

1076
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:37,507
Dadda!

1077
01:17:37,629 --> 01:17:39,744
Seymour, run to Daddy.

1078
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:41,506
Dadda! Dadda!

1079
01:17:41,628 --> 01:17:43,504
Oh, no!
Look, I've got to go.

1080
01:17:43,627 --> 01:17:45,299
I've got an urgent call of nature.

1081
01:17:46,426 --> 01:17:48,417
That's right, run away!

1082
01:17:48,546 --> 01:17:50,422
That's what you've always done.

1083
01:17:53,024 --> 01:17:56,060
I don't think I'm going to make it!

1084
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:02,299
Oh yes, a good conditioner
works wonders on my coat.

1085
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:05,289
Oh, Sid, no!

1086
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:08,252
Oh sorry guys.
I was bursting.

1087
01:18:08,379 --> 01:18:09,528
Oh Sid-you bastard!

1088
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:12,052
You're supposed to wait
till it's all clear!

1089
01:18:12,298 --> 01:18:14,448
Thanks a lot, Sid!
I'm on in five minutes.

1090
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:25,451
Goodbye life!

1091
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:37,928
Oh, there it is!

1092
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:46,488
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1093
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:48,599
Don't let me stop you.

1094
01:18:52,046 --> 01:18:54,843
I think you'll find
the safety catch is on.

1095
01:18:59,004 --> 01:19:03,359
Eat lead you man-stealing slut!

1096
01:19:19,957 --> 01:19:23,232
Oh yeah!
Hey, wow!

1097
01:19:23,716 --> 01:19:25,308
Amazing!

1098
01:19:30,234 --> 01:19:31,553
Bastard!

1099
01:19:35,113 --> 01:19:36,067
Bastard!

1100
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:42,905
Ach!

1101
01:19:58,105 --> 01:20:00,903
That's it!
I'm left no alternative!

1102
01:20:01,025 --> 01:20:04,902
I don't care what Bletch says.
We're doing my song!

1103
01:20:05,023 --> 01:20:08,935
It's up to me to save the show,
as usual.

1104
01:20:09,182 --> 01:20:11,695
All right, everybody!
As we rehearsed!

1105
01:20:12,101 --> 01:20:13,659
Ah, please God!

1106
01:20:13,781 --> 01:20:17,170
I know I've been a bad bunny...

1107
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:21,576
but if you make me well again
I promise... promise...

1108
01:20:21,658 --> 01:20:24,490
I'll be good
for the rest of my life.

1109
01:20:26,417 --> 01:20:28,372
- What?
- Hi Harry.

1110
01:20:28,496 --> 01:20:31,248
I've just received your test results...

1111
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:32,649
and guess what...

1112
01:20:32,775 --> 01:20:35,447
- I made a boo boo.
- A boo boo?

1113
01:20:35,574 --> 01:20:37,609
Yeah Harry.
You're in the clear.

1114
01:20:37,973 --> 01:20:40,532
You just got a bad case
of bunny pox.

1115
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:44,407
Take two aspirins
and stay in bed for a week.

1116
01:20:45,531 --> 01:20:47,248
I'll send you my bill.

1117
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:51,007
Yippeee!

1118
01:20:51,169 --> 01:20:53,124
Yipeeee!

1119
01:20:53,288 --> 01:20:55,961
I'm in the clear everybody!

1120
01:20:56,088 --> 01:20:59,159
I haven't got it!
I haven't got myxamatosis!

1121
01:20:59,327 --> 01:21:00,645
I haven't got myx...

1122
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:11,836
He wouldn't dare!

1123
01:21:12,402 --> 01:21:14,279
Oh Christ, he's not!

1124
01:21:14,482 --> 01:21:16,711
Oh yes he is, boss.

1125
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:26,633
<i>Sodomy...</i>

1126
01:21:26,758 --> 01:21:28,350

very odd of me...</i>

1127

1128

1129
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:39,431

that you enjoy the act of sodomy.</i>

1130
01:21:45,112 --> 01:21:49,423
<i>Don't worry if you feel ashamed.
It's been around for years.</i>

1131
01:21:49,551 --> 01:21:52,940
<i>Thousands more than can be named
are interested in rears.</i>

1132
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:56,103
<i>Don't worry about hell...</i>

1133
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:58,298
<i>no harm will come to your soul.</i>

1134
01:21:58,428 --> 01:22:03,865
<i>We're not all Pentecostal,
but everybody's got an arsehole.</i>

1135
01:22:04,946 --> 01:22:07,743
<i>Let me tell you about sodomy.</i>

1136
01:22:07,865 --> 01:22:10,060

1140
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:26,729
<i>It might just improve your sex,
it's a hard act to follow.</i>

1141
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:29,895
<i>A fact that fundamentalists
find difficult to swallow.</i>

1142
01:22:31,258 --> 01:22:32,691
<i>So join me as I sing...</i>

1143
01:22:32,818 --> 01:22:36,331
<i>of an activity that's fun.</i>

1144
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:41,768
<i>Open up your ring

1145
01:22:41,895 --> 01:22:44,692
<i>Bum, bum, bum, bum...</i>

1146
01:22:44,814 --> 01:22:46,041
<i>Sodomy...</i>

1147
01:22:46,173 --> 01:22:48,767

1151
01:23:05,567 --> 01:23:06,920
<i>Sodomy!</i>

1152
01:23:21,483 --> 01:23:23,234
- Trevor.
- Yes boss?

1153
01:23:23,362 --> 01:23:26,433
I want that fudge-packer eliminated.

1154
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:35,109
Now put that gun down Heidi.

1155
01:23:35,638 --> 01:23:38,868
You're not solving anything
by massacring people.

1156
01:23:45,555 --> 01:23:48,751
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles...</i>

1157

1158
01:23:52,353 --> 01:23:56,311
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles...</i>

1159
01:24:28,182 --> 01:24:29,409
My god!

1160
01:24:29,621 --> 01:24:31,976
Oh god no!

1161
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:14,965
Seymour!

1162
01:25:15,847 --> 01:25:16,962
Seymour!

1163
01:25:19,806 --> 01:25:23,480
I'm coming!
Seymour!

1164
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:31,482
Daddy...

1165
01:25:32,322 --> 01:25:35,154
Daddy is here!
Seymour!

1166
01:25:35,281 --> 01:25:37,874
Seymour!

1167
01:25:44,318 --> 01:25:46,274
Daddy!

1168
01:26:18,988 --> 01:26:21,217
I don't care what you've done,
Lucille.

1169
01:26:21,347 --> 01:26:23,302
I love you so very very much...

1170
01:26:23,466 --> 01:26:25,343
and I want you to marry me.

1171
01:26:25,466 --> 01:26:29,013
Oh Robert, I love you too!

1172
01:26:29,144 --> 01:26:31,533
I was never unfaithful,
it was Trevor.

1173
01:26:31,664 --> 01:26:34,416
He drugged my drink
and tried to ravish me.

1174
01:26:34,983 --> 01:26:36,574
That dirty rat!

1175
01:26:41,221 --> 01:26:42,289
Heidi!

1176
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,896
Put the gun down!

1177
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:25,518
Heidi, for godsake!

1178
01:27:29,446 --> 01:27:33,518
Heidi, I still love you!

1179
01:27:38,963 --> 01:27:41,317
Bletch...

1180
01:27:52,359 --> 01:27:54,428
Kill her, Trevor!

1181
01:27:54,558 --> 01:27:56,593
Lt'll be a pleasure, boss.

1182
01:27:57,517 --> 01:27:59,507
You rotter!

1183
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,067
Shit!

1184
01:28:38,464 --> 01:28:43,014
Miss Heidi,
I know you're a real star...

1185
01:28:43,143 --> 01:28:45,861
but I'm afraid I'm going to
have to dob you in.

1186
01:28:48,061 --> 01:28:51,098
Could you do
one last thing for me, Arthur?

1187
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,897
Anything, Miss Heidi.

1188
01:28:55,979 --> 01:28:58,811
