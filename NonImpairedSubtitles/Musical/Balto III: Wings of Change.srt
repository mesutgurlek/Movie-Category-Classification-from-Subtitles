1
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:38,344
(Barking)

2
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:51,321
The wind across the water

3
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:54,391
A cloud across the skies

4
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:57,335
The music in the echo

5
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:00,431
Of the eagle as she cries

6
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:03,068
The winter light at sunset

7
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,843
The full moon on the rise

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,048
Everything, everything flies

9
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:18,787
A mother's prayers to heaven

10
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:22,158
A young boy's paper kite

11
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:25,221
The breeze that brings the morning

12
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:28,325
A comet through the night

13
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:31,132
Aurora borealis

14
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:34,663
As it sweeps across the skies

15
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:40,704
Everything, everything flies

16
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:43,773
Time and stars and innocence

17
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:46,650
Childhood's waking dream

18
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:50,622
The spark that leaves a dying fire

19
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:56,493
The trout that breaks the stream

20
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:04,667
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

21
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:08,299
La-la, la-la, la, la-la

22
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:14,370
The sound of children's laughter

23
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:16,279
When they're having fun...

24
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:18,045
Whoa, there!

25
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:20,348
The pride that leaps from heart to heart

26
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:23,481
When a job has been well done

27
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:26,219
The love of friends and family

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,888
Shining from their eyes

29
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:39,396
Everything, everything flies

30
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:50,312
Ah, ooh-ooh-ooh

31
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:01,960
Ah, ooh-ooh-ooh

32
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:33,019
(Birdsong)

33
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,856
Lt'll come. You'll see.

34
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,298
It'll come.

35
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,567
Why does that have
such a familiar ring to it?

36
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,871
I know. We've been
coming here for the
last three days.

37
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,299
At the crack of dawn.
So it's been a little early.

38
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:53,107
But that's when I saw it.

39
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:55,046
Trust me. It'll be worth it.

40
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:58,209
(Chuckles) Well, wake me up when it arrives.

41
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:07,854
(Airplane engine growling)

42
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:14,265
That's louder than a wild-eyed grizzly!

43
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,531
Isn't it beautiful? Come on, Jenna.

44
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:34,578
(Panting)

45
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:40,683
(Jenna, panting)
OK. It was... worth it.

46
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:44,128
Even if I am going to have
a heart attack. Phew!

47
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:45,961
What is it?

48
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:48,832
(Balto) I don't know. But look at it go.

49
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,860
Don't you ever wonder
what it's like up there,

50
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,964
looking down on the world?

51
00:04:54,474 --> 00:05:00,936
No, not me. I don't get how
that big steel whatever-it-is
can fly like a bird.

52
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:03,916
But what a feeling.

53
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,885
You wanna be up there, flying?

54
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,414
Sometimes,
in my dreams,

55
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:13,284
I'm soaring above
the clouds, free.

56
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,729
(Yapping and panting)

57
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:24,998
(Bell ringing)

58
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:39,482
(Man) Dipsy!

59
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,955
You're not getting
into anything, now,
are you girl?

60
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:46,117
Didn't think so.
Good girl.

61
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:03,837
It's a disaster, mayhem,
a catastrophe.

62
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:07,313
Hey, Mel. I brought you
a treat from the store.

63
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,941
Thanks, Dipsy,
but I can't eat a thing.

64
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,348
(Belches)

65
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:14,114
Nervous stomach.
Good.

66
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:17,021
I already ate it.
So, what's news?

67
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:20,117
News? Don't you know
the mail is late?

68
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,958
Honey, it's late at least
once a week. Why
worry?

69
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:25,931
I'm not worried.
I'm just reasonably concerned.

70
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:28,934
I'm frantic. Why are the dogs
late with the mail?

71
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:33,064
Uh, they're playing bridge?
No. I'll tell you why.

72
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,438
Something terrible
must have happened.

73
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,137
What if the dogs
went right over a cliff?

74
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,907
Splat!

75
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:42,380
Or they coulda been
buried in an avalanche.

76
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,508
Mel, calm down.

77
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,711
Ow!

78
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,312
No, they're probably
out there right now,

79
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,015
bleeding and torn to shreds

80
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:52,320
after a vicious attack by grizzlies.

81
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,349
Oh, my.

82
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:56,658
(Growling)

83
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:58,687
I think I feel a migraine
coming on.

84
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:01,223
I think I'll join you.
(Airplane approaching)

85
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:04,361
What in the name
of Yukon Jack is that?

86
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,278
What the heck is it?

87
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:14,473
(Mel) Trouble. That's what it is.

88
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,591
Yah! Yah!

89
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,355
Yah!

90
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,727
(Barking)

91
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:32,891
Mush! Mush!

92
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:36,866
(Dogs barking)

93
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:40,305
Whoa, whoa!

94
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:46,573
We're late again.
What's the big deal?

95
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:49,707
We're just running the mail,
not saving the town.

96
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,240
- Like your old man.
- Zip it, Ralph.

97
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:55,846
We would have been on time
if you hadn't been dragging your butt.

98
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,449
Me? I've got a broken toenail

99
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:00,482
and it's driving me crazy.

100
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,757
Besides, Kirby kept yanking to the right.

101
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:06,163
I had a lousy
breakfast this morning.
I got no energy.

102
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,430
It wasn't our fault.
Hello. The ice
was slippery.

103
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:12,802
Everybody knows the
snow is treacherous
in the spring.

104
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,104
Yeah. That's it.
The snow's getting
soft.

105
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:19,043
Warmer weather,
mushier snow.

106
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:20,545
(Laughter)

107
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,980
But that's no excuse
for being late.

108
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:25,007
Everyone counts on us.

109
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,884
Neither snow nor rain
nor sleet nor hail

110
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,582
will stop the U.S. Mail.

111
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,682
Yeah. What are they
gonna do? Fire us?

112
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:34,090
(Laughter)

113
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,261
Rookies. They're
all the same.

114
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:44,233
Look, Kodi. Bottom line -
we got the mail to Nome.

115
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,204
Enough said.

116
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:50,039
(Man) Mail's here, Mr. Conner.
Hey there, Mr. Simpson.

117
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:52,842
(Screams)

118
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,346
(Crashing)

119
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:56,375
I'm OK.

120
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,717
Looks like the mail
finally arrived today.

121
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:04,985
(Chuckles) Very funny, Balto.
You know Kodi is proud
of his new job.

122
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:08,157
He does get that
gleam in his eye.

123
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,859
Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.

124
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:14,094
Looking good out there, son.
You think so?

125
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,897
I've been practicing on
the beach. I'm kind of...

126
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:21,873
Well, I'm hoping to get
a chance at lead dog.
Like you, Dad.

127
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:26,004
Well, you keep working
hard and I'm sure
you'll get there.

128
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,912
It's here. My God, it's here.

129
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:31,007
What's here?

130
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,764
Hey, boy. A dog
welcoming committee, huh?

131
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,107
Why don't you guard my plane?

132
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,803
I'll be back soon.

133
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,949
What is that thing?
Watch it, Balto.

134
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:09,116
Dad, don't go getting any ideas.

135
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,645
Me?

136
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,250
You think I'd just hop in
and go for a flight?

137
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:17,787
Yes.
You're right. I would if I could.

138
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,629
I got a bad feeling
about this.

139
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,967
When don't you
have a bad feeling?

140
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:26,468
(Geese honking)

141
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:29,600
Guess we can
agree that spring
is officially here.

142
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:31,735
So where's Boris?

143
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:35,713
( Boris singing heartily in Russian)

144
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:41,686
( Singing continues)

145
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:47,321
( Gargly singing and laughter)

146
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,590
(Female voice)
Be-ba-ba ba-doo ba

147
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,859
Wah-wah, mmm

148
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:53,388
Ba-ba-a-am

149
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,333
(Shrieks)

150
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,138
Ba-wah-wah, whoa

151
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:01,902
Morning, big boy.

152
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:04,307
Your moving is
getting me grooving.

153
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:09,370
Oh, you cannot see
I'm taking personal bath
here?

154
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,681
You bet your little patootie.

155
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:15,313
But I figure two in a bath is
a whole lot more fun than one.

156
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,380
The name's Stella.

157
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,357
I just flew in for the summer.

158
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:22,828
It's my first trip to Nome
and I like what I see so far.

159
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,762
What's your name, big boy?

160
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:34,103
Boris. But my friends
are calling me...

161
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:36,468
Boris.

162
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:39,706
All right, honey. Boris it is.

163
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:45,150
That's a strong, handsome
name for a strong,
handsome goose.

164
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:48,153
(Chuckles) So, where
are you from, Boris?

165
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:50,553
I can tell it's not from around here.

166
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,718
I am living in Nome for a long, long time

167
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,228
but I was born in Russia.

168
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:59,231
Really? Cos you don't have an accent at all.

169
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:02,663
I was hoping to see
the picturesque sites here.

170
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:06,763
Then later,
you can show me
this one-horse town.

171
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:09,138
That can be arranged.

172
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,004
(Honking)

173
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,647
(Laughter and whooping)

174
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:19,014
Hold it! Hold it!

175
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,713
Uncle Boris!

176
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:24,151
Enough. Enough! Put me down.

177
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:27,291
(Splash)

178
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:31,028
Play with us, Uncle Boris.
Give it a go, please?

179
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:32,656
No. No!

180
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:35,531
Not another game of...
Slosh!

181
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:40,572
Absolutely not.
No slosh. No.

182
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:42,597
No. No.

183
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:46,009
All right, Luc, on three.
Maximum velocity.

184
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:47,910
One...
No!

185
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:51,075
Two...
No! Nyet! Hold!

186
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:53,675
Three!

187
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,848
(Boris) No! No! Nooo!

188
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,051
(Boris screaming)

189
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:05,055
(Laughing)

190
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:07,532
Enough! Enough! Enough!

191
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:11,003
How many times am I telling you?
Stop what you are doing.

192
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:14,905
But wasn't that fun, Uncle Boris?

193
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:17,239
Fun? Fun is birthday party.

194
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,403
That was big pain in tush.

195
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,276
I say stop, you go.

196
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,805
I say no more,
you do more.

197
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,478
What? You have
rocks in your head?

198
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,348
(Muc) No. I'm all clear.
Can't say the same
for Luc, though.

199
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:33,916
(Boris) Sit down when
I am talking to you.

200
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,057
There's a goose with guts.

201
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:41,191
Now, go away and
do not come back

202
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:44,169
for 40 or 50 years!

203
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:46,797
Yes, Uncle Boris. Right away.

204
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,932
See you tomorrow.

205
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:52,741
Phew.
My, my. Boris, baby.

206
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:57,415
You weren't afraid
of those big, bad bears.

207
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,975
You are one loose goose.

208
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,249
Afraid of Muc and Luc?

209
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:04,518
They are just a c...

210
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:07,025
No, of course not.

211
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,425
What should a goose
fear from a bear?

212
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:12,590
We are more smart,
more bold...

213
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:14,896
And more cute.

214
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:19,428
So, big boy, what do
you say we do a little
flying together?

215
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:23,101
Say, around sunset?

216
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:24,666
(Gulps)

217
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,645
Fly with you?

218
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,773
Is that a yes?

219
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,716
Uh... Wh...

220
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:34,913
See you then, hot stuff.

221
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:40,492
Oh! What have I done?

222
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,990
Balto! Balto!

223
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:48,424
Wake up. Eyes open.

224
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,458
What? What? What's up?

225
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:52,027
Repeat after me -

226
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:54,631
Boris, come right away.
It's an emergency.

227
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,270
What emergency?

228
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,039
No. Say like this -

229
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:02,411
Boris, come right away.
It's an emergency!

230
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:04,541
Now you go.

231
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,816
First tell me what's going on.

232
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:11,380
Is terrible. I'm
going on date with
gorgeous goose.

233
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,221
Now, that is scary.

234
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:17,821
And she's wanting
me to fly with her
but I do not fly.

235
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,888
(Laughing)

236
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:23,265
Boris, you goof. Why
don't you just call it off?

237
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,293
I... I...

238
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:27,465
You're really hooked, aren't you?

239
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,406
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,810
Wow. She must be something.

241
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:36,872
Here is my plan. I go
on date, I charm Stella,

242
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,750
then you come,
get me before she
finds out I do not fly.

243
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,276
Is good, no?

244
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:45,085
Here's my plan.
You learn to fly.

245
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,115
Is terrible plan.

246
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,094
Why? What's wrong with it?
I already know how to fly.

247
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,859
You're kidding, right?
Not right.

248
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,995
You know how to fly?
Since when?

249
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:59,493
Look at me. I am bird.
All birds can fly.

250
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:03,702
You just came here
begging for my help
because you can't fly.

251
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:07,474
I do not fly. I did not
say I could not fly.

252
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:11,108
All right. I'll bite.
What's the deal here?

253
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,017
I'd give my eye teeth
to fly just once.

254
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,782
Why don't you?

255
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:18,221
The flying part is not hard.

256
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:21,122
It's where you go when you do it.

257
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:24,053
Psst!

258
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:27,357
I hate heights.

259
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,197
(Laughing)

260
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:34,036
Wait a minute.
Are you saying that
you're afraid of heights?

261
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,302
No. Of course not.

262
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:40,505
Just a little.

263
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:47,813
Come on, Boris.
I have an idea.

264
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,684
(Balto) Don't worry. This'll work.

265
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:54,352
(Boris) Don't worry, he says. Ha!

266
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,452
There. What do you see?

267
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:59,726
Nothing. What do
you think I see?

268
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:04,225
Flap around like this
for a while and you'll
get used to the feel of flying.

269
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,670
Then you'll forget that
you're up in the air.

270
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,537
You know,
this makes sense,

271
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:10,701
in absurd,
illogical way.

272
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:15,236
(Boris) Ah! Ahhh!

273
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:17,408
That's it! You're doing it.

274
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:21,343
You're doing great!
How does it feel?

275
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:26,188
Not bad, except I have
no idea where I'm going!

276
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,758
(Loud crash, Boris yells)

277
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,660
(Thud)

278
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:34,029
Keep going! Keep going!

279
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,193
Is working! Is working!

280
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:39,799
You got it. Now, open your eyes.

281
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:43,531
(Screams)

282
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:50,541
Ah! What do you know?
I am flying.

283
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,777
Ha-haaa!

284
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:54,115
I am one hot goose.

285
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:56,849
I'm not sure Stella's
gonna see it that way.

286
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:58,151
Hoo!

287
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,353
I am good.
I am the goose.

288
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:06,156
(Crash, Boris screams)

289
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:11,567
(Mr. Conner) Duke, you
make a good argument.

290
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,265
Maybe we should
give it a try.

291
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:17,605
(Duke) lt'll be an honor
to work for you and the
U.S. Mail, Mr. Conner.

292
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:24,645
OK, this is really
horrible. Devastating.

293
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:28,585
Besides that, give me
the particulars.

294
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:32,286
We gotta spread the word.
And what word would that be?

295
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:36,158
That the mail is
gonna be delivered by
that flying whatever.

296
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:40,655
The sled dogs are
through. Canned. Fired.
Out on their butts.

297
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,564
Unbelievable.

298
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:46,697
Dipsy, we're gonna have
to activate the E.D.A.S.

299
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,969
And what would that be?

300
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:53,475
Numbskull! The Emergency
Dog Alert System.

301
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,639
Ohhh. Oh, yeah.

302
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,112
(Barking)

303
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,957
(Barking continues)

304
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,921
(Resounding barking)

305
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,157
(Barks)

306
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:19,632
(Barking)

307
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:26,407
(Tapping sounds, icicles shattering)

308
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:29,642
(Dogs barking)

309
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,051
(Barking)

310
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:43,655
(Barking continues)

311
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,332
(Snoring)

312
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:51,233
(Dogs barking)

313
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,676
(Barking increases)

314
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:04,948
(Dogs howling)

315
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:10,616
(Barking in distance)

316
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:11,987
Heh-heh-heh.

317
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:14,015
(Barking)

318
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,993
Oh!

319
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,586
Oh, now what?

320
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,293
(Kodi) We have to deliver the mail.
(Kirby) Dogs have always done it.

321
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,233
I don't know how to
do anything else.

322
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:26,636
If we don't deliver the mail,
who will want us?

323
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,670
(Man) Mr. Conner, there must
be something we can do

324
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,438
to keep delivering the mail.

325
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:35,447
(Mr. Conner) The bush pilot
makes a good case.

326
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:37,176
(Man) It isn't fair.
(2nd man) It's not right.

327
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:39,650
(3rd man) We need our jobs.
(4th man) We've always delivered...

328
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,585
(Kodi) What are they saying?
Tell us.

329
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,554
Is it good news, bad news, what?

330
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,783
OK. The mushers are
talking to Conner.

331
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:49,123
That's bad. That's gotta be bad.

332
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:54,531
And, he's saying
that airplanes are
faster than dogs.

333
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,125
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

334
00:20:56,168 --> 00:21:00,195
Now he's saying air mail
is the wave of the future.

335
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:03,437
Oh! It's worse than I thought.

336
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:06,401
Hold on a minute. OK.

337
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,879
All right. This could
be interesting.

338
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:13,715
Oh, my. Oh! Um... Huh?

339
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:16,084
What the...? Whoa.

340
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,513
(Dipsy) Yikes.

341
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:20,388
Oh, my.

342
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,018
(All) What?

343
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,724
The postmaster's
agreed to a race
to see who's faster,

344
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:28,130
the bush plane or the dogs.

345
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:32,601
We're saved.
We'll beat the tail off
of that bush plane.

346
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:35,835
Are you crazy?
Have you seen how
fast that monster flies?

347
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:38,968
We can't afford to lose.
No kidding.

348
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,070
We need somebody
fast and experienced

349
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:42,944
to lead us in the race.

350
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:45,177
You can count on me.

351
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:52,955
What? What?

352
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:55,324
Well, Kirby, it's just...

353
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:58,286
We don't need fast,

354
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,958
we need really, really fast.

355
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,467
Oh?

356
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:06,938
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

357
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,440
The fastest dog in Nome.

358
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:12,103
The most famous dog in Nome.

359
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,773
My dad.

360
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:18,107
That's... Oh! That's good.

361
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:22,277
Now back. Stay down, brows.

362
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:24,585
Get bee wax, maybe make better.

363
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:27,518
Now I looking good.

364
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,856
(Boing!)

365
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:30,555
Not good now.

366
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:32,757
(Stella) Well, hi there, flyboy.

367
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,066
You're right on time.

368
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:39,093
I did not want to miss a minute with you.

369
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:41,868
Mmm, a goose
with intelligence.

370
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:44,205
Let's hit the skies, big boy.

371
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:47,076
Why rush things?
Let us take time

372
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:50,172
to be getting to know
each other first.

373
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:52,206
We can catch up in the air.

374
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:55,152
Flying really gets my feathers tingling.

375
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,415
Oh!

376
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:59,822
Wait, I am... I cannot... I have...

377
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:01,985
I have a crick in wing.

378
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:04,018
Ready?

379
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,962
No. I am meaning my other wing.

380
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:10,127
Ah! Ow! Oh! Ah...

381
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:12,637
Sit down, Boris.

382
00:23:14,573 --> 00:23:16,768
Let me tell you something.

383
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:22,171
I've been around the pond
a time or two

384
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:26,274
I've done my share of migrating

385
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,614
When I look at you,
I enjoy the view

386
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:39,029
You set my little
wishbone to palpitating

387
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:41,589
(Honking)
Come on down, boys.

388
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:45,259
I'm a goose

389
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,703
On the loose

390
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:52,977
On the prowl for a handsome fowl

391
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:57,614
You've got the style,
got the form

392
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:02,109
Got the big strong wings
to keep me warm

393
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:04,554
I know what I like

394
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,423
-  And I like what I see
- (Boris giggles)

395
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:12,158
How'd you like to do
a little flying with me?

396
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:14,165
(Giggling)

397
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,698
I ain't no quail
Wah-wah-ooh

398
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:19,727
You ain't no chicken

399
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:21,171
Wah-wah-wah-waaah

400
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:25,006
You've got my heart
doing more than ticking

401
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:30,281
I'd like to rest
against your chest

402
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:34,615
Aah-ooh
We could build ourselves a sugar nest

403
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:39,488
Oh, can't you feel
we've got some chemistry?

404
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,993
Don't you wanna try
a little flying with me?

405
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,760
Wah-wah-wah
Beak to beak

406
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,735
Wing to wing
Wah!

407
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:53,704
We could have ourselves quite a fling

408
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,671
Tail to tail, feather to feather

409
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:03,977
Don't you think
we oughta flock together?

410
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:06,644
(Geese)  Wah-wah wah-waaah

411
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:10,781
I'm the goose
Goose

412
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:13,053
With the juice
Juice

413
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:18,256
Wah-ooh
Mr. Gander, let's meander

414
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:22,890
On my own up here in Nome

415
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:27,428
I'm a chick who's
oh-so-far from home

416
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:28,496
Awww!

417
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,135
We could honk in harmony

418
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:37,139
Come on up and do
a little flying with me

419
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:39,548
Where the air is rare

420
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:41,951
And the wind blows free

421
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:45,183
Come on up and do a little...

422
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:47,249
Do a little

423
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:50,420
Come on up and do a little...

424
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:55,863
Flying with me

425
00:25:57,502 --> 00:26:00,300
Let's you and I get
down and fly, flyboy.

426
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:03,802
(Geese) Bye-bye!

427
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,136
(Balto) Boris! Boris!
Huh?

428
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,273
It's an emergency.

429
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:12,681
Balto! It's about time.

430
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:16,654
Ah, is Balto. Always
in trouble, this dog.

431
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:20,021
If I'm not bailing him out,
then he is kaput.

432
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:22,583
Maybe we fly some other time.

433
00:26:23,262 --> 00:26:25,127
But, but, but...

434
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:27,222
You must be the famous Stella.

435
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:29,996
And you must be the famous Balto.

436
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,595
The trouble dog.
Boris...

437
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:35,732
Come. We take care
of emergency. Come.

438
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:38,072
Goodbye, Stella!
Huh?

439
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:40,534
Bye... Boris.

440
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:46,015
Bravo, Balto. Magnificent.

441
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,814
Except for talking too much at end.

442
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:49,844
Hee-hee! We fooled her.

443
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:51,913
Boris, I wasn't faking it.

444
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:53,948
There really is an emergency.

445
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:57,359
A big race.
The mail dogs
against the bush plane.

446
00:26:57,396 --> 00:26:59,990
Whoever wins
gets to deliver
the mail to Nome.

447
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,795
They want me
to lead the
dogsled team.

448
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,768
So what is problem?

449
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:07,931
I've chased that bush
plane. I can't beat it.

450
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:10,134
That could be problem.

451
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:13,942
(Dogs cheering)

452
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:17,437
(Ralphy) We'll beat
that plane paws down,
now that you're lead dog.

453
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:20,815
Listen...
We're behind you 100 percent.

454
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:24,049
(Dipsy) To the max!
100 percent!

455
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:26,557
If anyone can do it, you can.

456
00:27:26,591 --> 00:27:29,890
Everyone, listen. I've seen it fly.

457
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:31,862
We have to consider the possibility...

458
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:33,990
Let's do the call!

459
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:36,262
(All howling and barking)

460
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,004
(Howling and barking continues)

461
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:50,477
Yes, this is good. Very good.

462
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:53,382
You think a bunch of dogs
can beat an airplane?

463
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:55,784
Of course not. Is impossible.

464
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:58,381
Oh. Thanks for the vote of confidence.

465
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,051
If you think we're
gonna lose, why
are you so happy?

466
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:03,891
Because I have solved
my Stella problem.

467
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:05,487
Oh.

468
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,590
Let me guess. You're
gonna tell her the truth.

469
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:11,124
Are you crazy?

470
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:13,228
Ah! Oy! The pain!

471
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:15,206
The pain! Oh!

472
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,902
An old migratory injury is back.

473
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:22,744
What migratory
injury? You've never
migrated anywhere.

474
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:27,115
What does it matter?
If I'm in pain,
I cannot fly, yes?

475
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:35,655
(Dog howling)

476
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:43,060
What are you
doing here? It's late.

477
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:45,729
I just thought I'd say hello.

478
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:48,433
(Laughs) You couldn't
wait until morning?

479
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:50,600
I thought you'd miss me too much.

480
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:53,475
Always. So, what's up?

481
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:55,878
With me? Nothing.

482
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:57,279
Uh-huh.

483
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:59,776
I don't know. It's just...

484
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:03,684
Well, you saw that
plane. It's so fast.

485
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:05,280
I can't...

486
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:07,518
There's no way
to keep up with it.

487
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,085
How can I look Kodi
in the eyes if we lose?

488
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:15,929
You're his father.
He loves you.

489
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,800
He knows me as
the town hero.

490
00:29:18,837 --> 00:29:21,362
The great Balto
who saved Nome.

491
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:26,607
What happens when
I'm the same Balto
who loses the mail run?

492
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,636
Oh, Balto.

493
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:33,642
You don't have
to be a hero

494
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,981
You just have to be there

495
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:41,724
He doesn't need to
know you're perfect

496
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,628
He needs to know you care

497
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:50,366
And when the race is over

498
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:54,031
You've done all you can do

499
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:58,604
Be a father, not a hero

500
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:03,478
That's all he needs from you

501
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:11,380
You don't have to be a winner

502
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,385
If you give it your best

503
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:19,258
Believe in who you are

504
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:25,065
And then time can do the rest

505
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:28,504
Your heart is his example

506
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,408
Brave and strong and true

507
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:36,743
You don't have to be a hero

508
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:41,316
You just have to be you

509
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:46,286
Trust in your son

510
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:50,727
He's more than he seems

511
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:55,724
Like you, he can run

512
00:30:55,767 --> 00:31:00,830
Like you, he has dreams

513
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:04,968
Ooh-ooh-ooh

514
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:13,615
Whatever happens, Balto,

515
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:15,813
you'll always be his hero.

516
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:27,923
Have faith in yourself, my love

517
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:32,460
Have faith in him too

518
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:36,565
He will always have a hero

519
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:45,442
He will always have a hero

520
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:52,846
For he'll always have you

521
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:12,933
(Sniffing)

522
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,712
(Sniffing)

523
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,328
It's OK, boy. I'm not
gonna hurt you.

524
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:39,960
Wait a minute, I saw you
this morning. Balto?

525
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:43,133
Heh. Heard a lot
about you, boy.

526
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:45,142
Quite a hero around here.

527
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:48,737
You saved a lot of lives
in that diphtheria scare.

528
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:55,577
I can't figure out how you
found your way back
here with the medicine.

529
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,713
That was some storm.

530
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:05,918
(Sniffing)

531
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:07,932
Come on. It's OK.

532
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:18,809
You seem to like
my plane, huh, boy?

533
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:21,437
I call her the Tundra Express.

534
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:23,777
Nothing can beat being up there,

535
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:26,375
soaring above the clouds, free.

536
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:35,883
(Stella) More seeds, Boris?

537
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,020
(Boris) Maybe just a few.

538
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:42,900
Is that better?

539
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,401
A little.

540
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:47,462
That must have
been some fight
you were in, hot stuff,

541
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:50,338
if you're still feeling it all these years later.

542
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,343
You've heard of bald eagle?

543
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:55,813
He wasn't bald till
I finished with him.

544
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:58,543
(Laughs)

545
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:02,713
So, honey, what else
can I do to get you
back on your wings?

546
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:07,014
Well, I do have this itch.

547
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,750
Here?

548
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:11,386
Oh... oh...

549
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:13,420
Little to the left.

550
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:15,399
Here?

551
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:17,630
To the right.

552
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,660
How's this?

553
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:22,033
Heaven.

554
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:24,268
When you're better,
we can fly around.

555
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:26,174
Who knows what
could happen then?

556
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,270
Say, tomorrow?

557
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:32,475
The pain! Oh, the pain!

558
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:35,350
Oh, it's excruciating.

559
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,519
Ohh. Mmm.

560
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:43,124
(People chatting excitedly)

561
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:50,657
Are you ready? I'm ready.
Are you ready? Cos I'm ready.

562
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,795
Something tells me
he's ready.

563
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:55,032
This is gonna be great, Dad.

564
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:00,843
Good luck, you two.

565
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,905
Luck? Ha! Like that
will make a difference.

566
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:06,008
Mr. Optimism.

567
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,075
That's why I like having you around.

568
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,416
Always a pleasure.

569
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:12,582
Why are you here,
anyway? I thought
you'd be with Stella.

570
00:35:12,624 --> 00:35:15,593
Believe me, I'm going right away back.

571
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:18,391
Did she fall for that
ridiculous story of yours?

572
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,762
I have her eating out of wing.

573
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,130
(Clears throat)

574
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:25,864
Oh, oh, the pain!

575
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:32,236
(Laughs) I tell you, Balto,
I am having cake
and eating it too.

576
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:33,574
(Balto) Uh, Boris...

577
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:37,138
Whoever called me
a silly goose will
eat his words.

578
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:39,912
- Boris!
- Stella is treating me like a king.

579
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:43,216
I just have to keep
this up for summer.

580
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:46,155
I am made in the shade.

581
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:49,183
I am a genius.

582
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:54,724
Ahh!

583
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:59,135
It is a miracle! I am
suddenly all better.

584
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:04,301
So, you're a big, fat liar.

585
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:08,438
You're just another
slick bird honking out
of both sides of his beak.

586
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,311
Stella, listen to me.

587
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:12,339
And make a bigger
fool of myself?

588
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:15,045
No. Your goose is
cooked. (Honks angrily)

589
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:18,112
Ouch. I-I can explain.

590
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:20,488
You don't know whole story.
(Stella honking)

591
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:21,856
(Screams)

592
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:28,491
(Boris) Ow! No! Oh! Ooh!

593
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:31,661
Well, well, couldn't happen
to a nicer bird.

594
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:34,337
Have a good ride, flyboy.

595
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,265
(Boris, muffled) Hey!

596
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:40,539
Hello! Anybody!

597
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:44,070
Here's your mail, Mr. Simpson.
Good luck to you.

598
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:47,050
Thanks, Mr. Conner.
(Dogs barking)

599
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:48,985
(Howls)

600
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:52,812
Attention. Attention, everybody.

601
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:58,022
The U.S. Mail is now
aboard both the dogsled
and the bush plane.

602
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:00,223
The winner'll be the competitor

603
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:05,168
who is first to deliver
the mail safely to the
town of White Mountain

604
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:07,865
then returns to Nome
with the new bag of mail.

605
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:11,672
(All cheering)
All right, everybody. On your mark,

606
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:14,567
get set...

607
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:18,472
(All cheering)
Ha! Hey! Hey!

608
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:22,050
(Barking)

609
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:24,520
(Switches clicking)

610
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:28,455
(Panting)

611
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:31,553
- Come on.
- (Engine growls, then stutters)

612
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:35,626
Come on.

613
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:39,594
(Starter motor whirring)

614
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:41,229
(Engine starts)

615
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,094
(Chirping)

616
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,061
Go! Go! Go!

617
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:24,337
Hey! Ow! Ahh!

618
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:30,544
(Barking)

619
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:36,422
Ooh! Ooh!

620
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:38,827
My toenail. It's killing me.

621
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:42,498
We gotta slow down.

622
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,859
Or not.

623
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:47,056
Kirby, you're pulling me again.

624
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:49,692
Me? You gotta be kidding.

625
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:53,629
Keep in line, boys.
(Kirby) You got it, Balto

626
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:10,915
(Growls)

627
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:15,122
(Balto) All right,
everybody.
Move those feet.

628
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,887
(Kodi) Come on, everybody.

629
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,327
(Balto) White Mountain. There it is.

630
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:28,195
Oh, no.

631
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,174
(Kodi) I don't believe it.
(Kirby) How'd he do that?

632
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:33,609
(Dusty) What are we gonna do now?

633
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:36,340
Hey, the race is only half over.

634
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,473
Don't give up now.

635
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:40,916
Ha! Hey!

636
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:59,459
Mail delivery, sir.

637
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:00,960
(Honking)

638
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:03,701
Thanks, Duke.
Here's the return batch.

639
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:17,553
(Starter motor whirring)

640
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:19,818
(Engine stuttering)

641
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,685
(Grunting)

642
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:25,958
(Engine starts)

643
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:44,308
(Grunting)

644
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:48,875
Wait a minute. Hold the wire.
Where am I?

645
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,148
Oh!

646
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:56,655
(Barking)

647
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,631
(Engine stuttering)

648
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:11,801
(Engine stops)

649
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:14,140
Here's the mail from Nome, sir.

650
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:17,477
Thanks. Let's load you up
for the return trip.

651
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:28,721
White Mountain?
How did this disaster happen?

652
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:30,818
This mail goes right back to Nome.

653
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:32,796
Good luck to you.

654
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,230
Balto! Balto! Take me home!

655
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:37,461
(Dogs barking)

656
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:43,867
No! No!

657
00:42:43,908 --> 00:42:46,502
I am stuck in White Mountain.

658
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:50,446
I'm going to spend
the rest of my days
in White Mountain.

659
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:55,708
I'm going to die of boredom
in White Mountain.

660
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:58,187
(Banging)
I am...

661
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:03,287
Huh?

662
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:06,454
Going home!

663
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:11,064
Sled team already left.
What's your holdup?

664
00:43:11,102 --> 00:43:13,900
Ice. Gotta get it off
the wings before I can fly.

665
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:22,543
Oh...

666
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:27,647
(Starter motor whirring)

667
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:29,619
(Engine stuttering)

668
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:31,781
(Engine starts)

669
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,465
Aaah-oooh!

670
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,302
(Crash)

671
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:16,195
Oh, I wonder how far
they are by now?

672
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:18,326
Well, assuming they didn't get lost

673
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:21,736
or get attacked by bears
or Balto didn't break his leg

674
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:23,763
or the mail didn't fall out of the sled

675
00:44:23,808 --> 00:44:26,106
or Kodi didn't barf or...

676
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:28,236
Never mind.

677
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:33,382
Look at what the dog dragged in.

678
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:36,443
Triple A, number one,
first quality beef jerky.

679
00:44:36,487 --> 00:44:39,684
And did old Guntersson
see a thing?
Absolutely not.

680
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:43,353
You know, I am getting
so good, I scare
myself. Anyone?

681
00:44:43,794 --> 00:44:46,024
Eat? At a time like this?

682
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,962
Go ahead, Dipsy.
(Muffled) Thanks.

683
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,797
I don't mind if I do.

684
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:52,826
(Humming and munching)

685
00:44:56,474 --> 00:44:58,908
(Dogs barking)

686
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:04,311
I can't see my nose
in front of my face.

687
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:08,649
That's good. Cos it's ugly.
Very funny, wise guy.

688
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:11,587
What if we don't catch up? What if we lose?

689
00:45:11,622 --> 00:45:14,785
(Dusty) That plane's gotta be
halfway to Nome by now.

690
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:16,816
Nobody quits on my team.

691
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:19,523
Nobody. Move, move, move!

692
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:26,101
(Howling and barking)

693
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:34,373
(Honking)

694
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:39,214
Other reason I do not like to fly.

695
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,275
I'm about to lose my lunch.

696
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:47,288
(Balto) Do you hear that?
(Kodi) The plane engine?

697
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:50,583
We're catching up.

698
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:53,461
I can't see it.
It's up there, all right.

699
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:56,192
And we're beating it.

700
00:46:25,096 --> 00:46:26,825
Ahhh!

701
00:46:26,864 --> 00:46:29,128
(Howling and barking)

702
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,225
Whoa, there.

703
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:34,563
Come on, Dusty. You got it.

704
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:38,098
I'm OK.

705
00:46:40,778 --> 00:46:43,076
Do you hear the plane
anymore, Dad?

706
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:45,679
No.

707
00:46:50,488 --> 00:46:52,649
Where the heck am I?

708
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:57,124
Come on, baby.

709
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:00,187
Ohhh!

710
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:10,205
(Mel) They should have
been back by now.

711
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:12,573
I knew it. They're in trouble.

712
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,771
Please, Mel,
don't get started.

713
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:16,870
(Grinding sounds)

714
00:47:16,914 --> 00:47:19,610
The plane.
It's gonna win?

715
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,481
Oh, brother.

716
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:23,783
Well, where is it?

717
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:25,219
(Silence)

718
00:47:25,256 --> 00:47:27,588
Wait. What happened?
(Grinding)

719
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,059
Wait a minute.
That's the sawmill.

720
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:32,028
Not the plane?

721
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:34,053
(Howling and barking)

722
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:38,025
Balto.

723
00:47:38,936 --> 00:47:40,767
Balto!

724
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:49,377
(Jenna) They won!
(Dipsy) They did it?

725
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:51,540
I don't believe it.

726
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:04,352
(People cheering)

727
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:06,386
Easy, easy.

728
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,762
(Cheering continues)

729
00:48:11,502 --> 00:48:13,595
Did we beat the plane,
Mr. Conner?

730
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:16,936
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.
You've done it.

731
00:48:16,974 --> 00:48:19,272
You're the winners.

732
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,335
Yes!

733
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:24,108
(People cheering, dogs barking)

734
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:33,346
(Kodi) Yeah, we beat
that plane. Kicked its tail.

735
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,052
Yeah! If this doesn't prove
us dogs rule...

736
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:39,153
what does?

737
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:50,706
Thanks for saving our jobs, Dad.

738
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:52,572
For the time being.

739
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,475
What do you mean?

740
00:48:54,511 --> 00:48:57,412
I don't think that's
the last of the
bush planes, son.

741
00:48:57,448 --> 00:48:59,348
Their day is coming.

742
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:03,012
How can you say that?
We beat him.

743
00:49:03,053 --> 00:49:04,884
This time, Kodi.

744
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:08,187
But I've seen them.
We can't do this every time.

745
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:13,555
You're just wrong.

746
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:22,162
It's what I think.

747
00:49:22,206 --> 00:49:24,504
You know how much
this job means to him.

748
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:26,270
Yeah, I know.

749
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:28,174
Where's Boris?

750
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:31,909
I thought Mr. Positive
would be here
celebrating with us.

751
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:34,679
Maybe he made up
with his new girlfriend.

752
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:36,618
Probably.

753
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,315
You know, I don't get it.

754
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:40,346
Duke should be here by now.

755
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:45,590
A little bad weather and
that yellow-bellied plane
flies south for winter.

756
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:48,325
He'll show up with his
tail between his wings.

757
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:50,959
I know what's wrong.
He's a sore loser.

758
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:52,366
(All laughing)

759
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:59,604
What could be wrong?
We still have our jobs.

760
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:03,135
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

761
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:07,779
And we're gonna keep them.
Come on, let's go.

762
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:21,097
What are you doing
out here? The party's
on the beach.

763
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:23,793
I'm just wondering
what happened to Duke.

764
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:25,358
Are you really worried?

765
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:26,528
Balto! Balto!

766
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:31,673
(Panting) It was awful. It was terrible.

767
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:33,540
Did I say it was awful?

768
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:37,513
There we were,
fishing the river, just minding
or own business when it...

769
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:39,072
attacked!

770
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:40,811
What attacked?

771
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:42,842
The monster.

772
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:45,354
(Growling and shrieking)

773
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:49,089
Wait a minute. A monster?

774
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:51,390
We could barely see it through the fog

775
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:53,988
but we could hear it getting closer

776
00:50:54,031 --> 00:50:56,022
and closer.

777
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:57,328
We didn't stick around

778
00:50:57,368 --> 00:51:00,531
to introduce
ourselves. We bolted!

779
00:51:00,571 --> 00:51:03,631
But it chased us,
growling and snarling,

780
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:06,643
until finally, it pounced
out of the sky.

781
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:10,408
If Luc hadn't yanked
me out of the way,
we would have been...

782
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:12,813
crushed.
(Both wail and sob)

783
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,182
Where's this... monster now?

784
00:51:16,086 --> 00:51:17,986
Out there.

785
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:19,784
Stuck in the snow.

786
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:21,552
That's how we escaped.

787
00:51:21,592 --> 00:51:24,152
It pounced out of the sky?

788
00:51:24,194 --> 00:51:26,560
And the snarling,
was it really loud?

789
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:31,296
Loud? It was louder
than a wild-eyed grizzly.

790
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:33,394
(Both) The bush plane.

791
00:51:40,244 --> 00:51:42,235
(Thudding and creaking)

792
00:51:43,947 --> 00:51:46,575
(Boris moaning)

793
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:49,916
Ay! Ow! Oh!

794
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:55,183
I must get help.

795
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:04,290
Oh!

796
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:06,859
(Wind whistling)

797
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:09,964
(Kirby) Balto,
you don't even know
the plane is out there.

798
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:13,272
Your sources are
a couple of mentally
challenged polar bears

799
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,608
talking about a monster.

800
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:17,136
Need I say more?

801
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:19,445
I just have a hunch.

802
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:21,246
It's worth finding out, right?

803
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:24,254
I don't get it. We won
the race, fair and square,

804
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:26,688
and now you want us
to help the enemy?

805
00:52:26,723 --> 00:52:28,987
He's not the enemy.

806
00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:31,551
He's a man. A nice one.

807
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:33,324
But Dad, he is the enemy.

808
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:35,422
He wants to take away our jobs.

809
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:37,934
It's not our fault
that plane's unreliable.

810
00:52:37,968 --> 00:52:40,368
Not to mention
loud and smelly.

811
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:42,702
Yeah, kinda like
you, Ralphy boy.

812
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:44,070
(All laughing)

813
00:52:44,107 --> 00:52:46,041
This is serious.

814
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:48,135
That plane is out there
somewhere.

815
00:52:48,178 --> 00:52:51,978
We're the only ones who can help.
That just proves our point.

816
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:54,813
The difference between
a dog and a machine

817
00:52:54,852 --> 00:52:56,945
is dogs are tough and reliable.

818
00:52:56,987 --> 00:52:59,785
I thought the difference
is only one has a heart.

819
00:53:02,926 --> 00:53:05,724
I'm not gonna let Duke freeze to death.

820
00:53:05,762 --> 00:53:07,855
Who's coming with me?

821
00:53:09,132 --> 00:53:11,157
Kodi?

822
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:16,101
I don't even think he's out there.

823
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:19,267
But my job is to deliver the mail.

824
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:21,641
I'm sorry you see it that way.

825
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:24,337
Dad, wait.

826
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:43,595
Balto the trouble dog, right?

827
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:46,432
Hey, Stella. Sorry, but I'm kinda busy.

828
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,735
Tell Boris that I'll be gone for a while.

829
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:52,207
But Boris is why
I'm coming to see you.

830
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:55,939
Not that I'm interested
but did you see
the bum come back?

831
00:53:55,979 --> 00:53:59,915
Come back? Where'd he go?
I thought he was with you.

832
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,477
Let's say he took
an unscheduled flight
on that bush plane.

833
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,750
Served him right, the stinker.

834
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,215
Boris was on the plane?

835
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:12,353
I saw him get packed
on myself. Don't ask.

836
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,430
Stella, I think...

837
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:18,332
Well, I think the plane crashed.

838
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:20,359
What?

839
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:26,032
As fast as you can, boys.
It's gonna be a cold night.

840
00:54:26,076 --> 00:54:30,035
Er, you're positive when
we get back there

841
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,810
the monster won't get us?
Trust me.

842
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:36,376
I don't even know
why I'm going on
this rescue operation,

843
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,287
that lying, untrustworthy
ball of feathers.

844
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:42,383
- You know, he's nuts about you.
- Really?

845
00:54:42,426 --> 00:54:44,087
Did he say something?

846
00:54:44,127 --> 00:54:47,096
He only said that you
were more beautiful
than a wild rose

847
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,394
and more luminous
than the northern lights.

848
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:51,560
He didn't say that.

849
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:55,231
No, he didn't, but I know
it's what he thought.

850
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:57,365
And how do you
know so much?

851
00:54:57,407 --> 00:54:59,398
I've known Boris
since I was a pup.

852
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:04,069
He may be a pain
in the butt but he's...

853
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:05,945
He's the dad I never had.

854
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:10,443
Yeah, a pain. That's
what he is, all right.

855
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:14,014
I wish I'd never
laid eyes on that
lying beak of his

856
00:55:14,057 --> 00:55:17,083
or that little cute waddle
when he walks

857
00:55:17,127 --> 00:55:21,928
or that feather that sticks out
in that funny way on
his neck, you know?

858
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:27,103
I was the one who
chased him onto that plane.

859
00:55:27,137 --> 00:55:31,096
If anything happens to him,
I'll never forgive myself.

860
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:34,975
At this rate, we won't
get there till next spring.

861
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:40,211
Say, fellas, why don't you
tell me where the plane
went down so I can fly there?

862
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,877
Good idea.

863
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:45,251
Let's see. The frightening
monster ran amok at...

864
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:50,019
I mean, the bush plane
attacked us by Bear Claw Rock,

865
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,721
just past Falcon's Peak.

866
00:55:51,762 --> 00:55:54,094
Got it. Bear Rock, Falcon's Peak.

867
00:55:54,131 --> 00:55:56,122
Wish me luck, boys.

868
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:03,897
(Laughs) Good one, Luc.
Got beat by the spring snow.

869
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,874
There's gotta be soft patches all over the...

870
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:07,900
(Screams)

871
00:56:12,382 --> 00:56:15,442
Would you look at that?
Stella's found them already.

872
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:17,077
She's better than I thought.

873
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,554
Bear Peak, Falcon Rock?

874
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:22,717
Whatever it was you told me,
I have no clue where I'm going.

875
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:24,693
I'm just here on vacation.

876
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:27,891
I guess that leaves you out
as our tour guide, then.

877
00:56:27,931 --> 00:56:30,491
Come on. Let's get going.

878
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:33,199
(Cracking)

879
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:37,329
(Man) Something's happened to the plane.
(Woman) Let's send out a search party.

880
00:56:37,374 --> 00:56:40,343
(2nd man) Where to look?
(3rd man) It could be anywhere.

881
00:56:40,377 --> 00:56:43,107
Do you know how
much open territory

882
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:45,080
there is between us
and White Mountain?

883
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:48,778
No, but I bet you're gonna tell us.
Millions of miles.

884
00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:51,151
They'll be looking for it for weeks.

885
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:54,351
Listen, if anyone can find him, Balto can.

886
00:56:57,828 --> 00:56:59,819
Kodi?

887
00:56:59,863 --> 00:57:02,195
Kodiak, come here.

888
00:57:02,232 --> 00:57:04,291
Yeah, Mom.

889
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:11,766
I thought you went with your dad.

890
00:57:11,808 --> 00:57:14,174
No, I didn't.

891
00:57:14,211 --> 00:57:16,543
You mean your dad's out there alone?

892
00:57:17,314 --> 00:57:19,805
Why didn't you go?
Well, I...

893
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:24,919
I don't know. I don't know
why he's even looking.

894
00:57:24,955 --> 00:57:28,118
There is a man out
there, maybe dying.

895
00:57:28,158 --> 00:57:31,525
We could have lost our jobs
because of that man.

896
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:34,621
You think your job is
worth more than a life?

897
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:36,461
(Sighs)

898
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,264
I should have gone with Balto.

899
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:50,905
Do you think Uncle Boris is OK?

900
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:54,747
He's probably griping
about what's taking
us so long.

901
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:57,979
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

902
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:00,954
Right. Onward. Onward.

903
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:06,857
Oh!

904
00:58:12,435 --> 00:58:14,460
(Grunting)

905
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,298
Hmmm...

906
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:23,179
Their hearts are
in the right place.

907
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:27,309
They are kinda cute,
if you have a thing
for polar bears.

908
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:38,393
(Cracking)

909
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:41,130
(Cracking)

910
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:45,867
(Crashing)

911
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:48,063
(All screaming)

912
00:59:01,184 --> 00:59:03,550
This is no time to be playing games.

913
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:58,298
(Muc) Help! Stella!

914
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:03,508
Quick, grab my leg.

915
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:08,641
What was I thinking?

916
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:16,415
Hang on, Balto!

917
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:21,996
Muc! Luc!

918
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:27,563
Hang in there, boys.
There's got to be a way out.

919
01:00:27,604 --> 01:00:29,834
I'll fly ahead and
look for something.

920
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:31,898
Hurry!

921
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:37,343
Reverse! Reverse!

922
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,439
Go the other way!
Trouble ahead?

923
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:41,916
Depends how you feel about waterfalls.

924
01:00:59,636 --> 01:01:01,331
(Crashing)

925
01:01:11,014 --> 01:01:13,574
What are you trying to do?
Give me a stroke?

926
01:01:13,616 --> 01:01:15,447
Because you did. That's it.

927
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:17,885
No more white water
adventures. No more.

928
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:19,354
(Panting)

929
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:24,790
It's a deal.

930
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:26,622
(Groans)

931
01:01:26,663 --> 01:01:29,632
I ache in places I didn't know I had.

932
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:32,794
Come on, you sore
from that little run?

933
01:01:32,836 --> 01:01:34,804
And you aren't?
Me?

934
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:37,432
Don't be ridiculous.
(Twang)

935
01:01:37,474 --> 01:01:39,965
The big talker.

936
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:43,104
Hey-hey. Our newest teammate.

937
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:45,740
Listen, guys, I've been thinking.

938
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:48,980
Maybe the pilot really is lost.

939
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:50,884
Joining the other side?

940
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,083
Of course not.
I'm one of you. It's just...

941
01:01:54,124 --> 01:01:57,252
(Kodi) Well... the
temperature's dropping.

942
01:01:57,293 --> 01:02:01,389
He's just a human.
He could freeze to death.

943
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,956
So? He shoulda
thought of the risks

944
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,366
before he challenged
us to a race.

945
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:10,430
Yeah, but...
You're either with us or against us.

946
01:02:10,473 --> 01:02:13,340
All I ever wanted
to do was be a
part of your team.

947
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:16,436
Bringing the mail
and supplies is
about helping everyone.

948
01:02:16,479 --> 01:02:19,312
And when somebody
really needs our help,

949
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:21,749
we're sitting on our butts.

950
01:02:21,785 --> 01:02:24,549
If this is what it means
to be a mail dog,

951
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:28,019
I'm not sure that's what I wanna be.

952
01:02:52,816 --> 01:02:56,217
Any more, Balto?
Sorry, Stella.

953
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:59,153
So, now what?

954
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:02,522
Well, I think I know where we are.

955
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,255
Think? Why don't I like
the sound of that?

956
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:08,822
(Muc) I know where
we are. Much too close
to moose territory.

957
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:10,526
You have a thing about mooses?

958
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:13,798
Everybody knows bull moose are mean.
(Whimpering)

959
01:03:13,837 --> 01:03:16,863
Mean and stubborn.
And did I mention
those antlers?

960
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:19,636
Sharp and big.
Sharp and strong.

961
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:21,803
(Growling)

962
01:03:21,845 --> 01:03:23,437
Ooh!

963
01:03:25,115 --> 01:03:27,106
See how dangerous they are?

964
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,119
I'm guessing the river
pushed us past
Bear Rock.

965
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:33,584
I can't tell from here
how far we need
to backtrack.

966
01:03:33,623 --> 01:03:36,148
Stella, can you take
a look around?

967
01:03:36,192 --> 01:03:38,422
Bear Rock looks like...

968
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,292
well, a giant bear.

969
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,423
You don't say.

970
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:44,626
Back in a flash, fellas.

971
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,933
I see it! I see it!
I'm going over.

972
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:03,719
(Gasps) Boris...

973
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:06,218
Boris!

974
01:04:07,157 --> 01:04:09,284
Where are you?

975
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:17,695
It's there. I saw it. The plane.

976
01:04:17,734 --> 01:04:19,599
No sign of Boris.

977
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:21,729
Come on, let's go.

978
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:23,898
Through moose territory?

979
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,840
(Luc whimpering)

980
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:29,902
Luc says we're doomed
if we meet one
of those bull moose.

981
01:04:29,946 --> 01:04:33,211
The faster we go in,
the faster we come out.

982
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:34,910
Come on.

983
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:39,713
(Muc) You know, they
only have two moods -

984
01:04:39,756 --> 01:04:42,247
angry and very angry.

985
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:44,487
Move those buns, fellas.

986
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:53,497
(Balto) No.
(Muc) Uncle Boris.

987
01:04:58,141 --> 01:04:59,972
(Gasps)

988
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:02,374
(Growling)

989
01:05:04,214 --> 01:05:06,682
Look, we don't
want any trouble.

990
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:08,911
We're just
passing through.

991
01:05:08,952 --> 01:05:10,749
You talkin' to me?

992
01:05:10,787 --> 01:05:12,880
Our friend down
there might be hurt.

993
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:14,116
You talkin' to me?

994
01:05:14,157 --> 01:05:15,920
We just wanna get by.

995
01:05:15,959 --> 01:05:18,257
I just wanna know if
you're talkin' to me.

996
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:20,125
Here's a newsflash,
genius.

997
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:22,222
We're talking to you!

998
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,198
(Growling)

999
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:26,702
Whoa, whoa,
buddy, please.

1000
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:29,398
This is an emergency.
We don't want
any trouble.

1001
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:31,737
I think you're talkin' to me.

1002
01:05:31,774 --> 01:05:33,605
Now he gets it.

1003
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:39,278
(Both screaming)

1004
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:50,582
Pull, Luc. Pull harder.

1005
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:52,993
You talkin' to me?
No. Course not.

1006
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:55,088
Just talking amongst ourselves.

1007
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:57,463
I think you're talkin' to me.

1008
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,899
(Shrieking)

1009
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:03,261
(Growling)

1010
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,307
Ooh!

1011
01:06:06,209 --> 01:06:08,200
(Groans)

1012
01:06:08,244 --> 01:06:10,235
Balto, talk to me, honey.

1013
01:06:12,148 --> 01:06:16,209
Come on, sugar.
This isn't a good time
for a snooze.

1014
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,088
(Shrieking)

1015
01:06:23,793 --> 01:06:26,091
Hey, lamebrain! >

1016
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:29,394
(Growling)

1017
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:32,300
You're standin'
on my turf.

1018
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:34,030
You talkin' to me?

1019
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:35,594
Am I here to amuse you?

1020
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:38,402
You see any other
lamebrain moose here?

1021
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:40,636
Yeah. I'm lookin' at one.

1022
01:06:46,249 --> 01:06:48,274
(Thunderous crashing)

1023
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,162
(Sniffing)

1024
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:07,328
He's alive.
Boris?

1025
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:10,062
Where are you?

1026
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:14,202
Maybe he wasn't
on the plane after all.

1027
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,040
But I could swear he...

1028
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:20,308
(Gasps)

1029
01:07:22,952 --> 01:07:25,216
Boris? Can you hear us?

1030
01:07:26,322 --> 01:07:30,053
Uncle Boris! Uncle Boris!

1031
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:32,425
(Stella) Flyboy?

1032
01:07:32,462 --> 01:07:33,986
(Sniffing)

1033
01:07:36,933 --> 01:07:39,094
(Gibbering)

1034
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:41,431
Luc says he's found him.

1035
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,539
(Hissing)

1036
01:07:50,346 --> 01:07:52,041
(Deflated honk)

1037
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:53,673
No!

1038
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:56,146
Boris. Boris.

1039
01:07:56,786 --> 01:07:59,084
Come on. Wake up.

1040
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:02,922
Come on, big boy.
Don't you give up!

1041
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:05,086
You owe me an apology!

1042
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:10,992
What...? What...
What am I doing here?

1043
01:08:11,033 --> 01:08:13,399
Uncle Boris.

1044
01:08:13,436 --> 01:08:15,165
(Laughing gleefully)

1045
01:08:15,204 --> 01:08:17,229
What? What?
All right, already.

1046
01:08:17,273 --> 01:08:19,935
I almost die once.
It was enough.

1047
01:08:19,976 --> 01:08:21,705
Easy does it, Luc.

1048
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:24,639
(Sighing)

1049
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,979
Oh, the plane.
It was terrible.

1050
01:08:29,218 --> 01:08:30,879
Ahhh...

1051
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,581
(Giggles)

1052
01:08:34,357 --> 01:08:36,416
We'd better get him home.

1053
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:38,654
What about the pilot?

1054
01:08:38,694 --> 01:08:40,855
Duke! You guys go on ahead.

1055
01:08:40,897 --> 01:08:44,731
But what about you?
It's getting cold out.

1056
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:47,759
I'll be fine. Just
take care of Boris.

1057
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:51,663
Come on, we're going to
take Uncle Boris home.

1058
01:08:54,444 --> 01:08:56,207
(Groans)

1059
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:01,276
Balto?

1060
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:04,480
What are you
doing here? How...?

1061
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,511
How did you know?

1062
01:09:06,556 --> 01:09:07,545
(Groans)

1063
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:10,184
Darn leg.

1064
01:09:10,827 --> 01:09:13,091
Guess I won't be
walking back to Nome.

1065
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:17,432
(Grunts)

1066
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:27,766
(Grunting)

1067
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:56,762
(Cracking and rumbling)

1068
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,004
No!

1069
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:21,756
Hang in there, boy.

1070
01:10:21,797 --> 01:10:24,391
(Grunting)

1071
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:26,025
(Rope creaking)

1072
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:28,434
(Dogs howling)

1073
01:10:28,471 --> 01:10:30,336
Now what?

1074
01:10:30,373 --> 01:10:31,738
Oh!

1075
01:10:37,313 --> 01:10:39,144
Kodi?

1076
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:43,918
We heard you had
a special delivery for Nome.

1077
01:10:44,787 --> 01:10:47,255
(Howling)

1078
01:10:53,262 --> 01:10:55,355
Right on time, son.

1079
01:10:57,633 --> 01:11:00,727
(Dipsy) Whoo! It is cold,
cold, cold, huh?

1080
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,603
I don't know. Balto's
been gone a while.

1081
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:06,164
Eight hours,
41 minutes
and counting.

1082
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,335
Don't count him out.

1083
01:11:09,612 --> 01:11:11,375
(Howling)

1084
01:11:12,782 --> 01:11:14,215
(Howls)

1085
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:18,684
(Howls)

1086
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:21,849
(All howling)

1087
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:26,321
(Howls)

1088
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:27,954
(Barking)

1089
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:31,192
Kodi.

1090
01:11:31,968 --> 01:11:34,630
(Man) I don't believe it!
(Woman) Hallelujah!

1091
01:11:42,011 --> 01:11:44,605
(Excited chatter)

1092
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:50,413
Balto saved my life.
He and the other dogs.

1093
01:11:50,453 --> 01:11:52,717
Good dogs.

1094
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:55,223
Good boy, Balto.

1095
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,519
That's my team.

1096
01:11:59,562 --> 01:12:01,553
(Woman) I can't believe it!

1097
01:12:01,597 --> 01:12:03,895
(Chatter)

1098
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:08,635
I knew he could do it.
I lost my appetite.

1099
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:14,468
(Boris) I still am not believing
you came looking for me.

1100
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:18,471
Is it maybe because
you still like me?

1101
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:20,141
Maybe.

1102
01:12:20,182 --> 01:12:23,481
Or maybe it's because
I had a few more things
to get off my chest.

1103
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:28,047
I forgot to say
you were a rotten, lying,
good-for-nothing snow goose.

1104
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:30,749
Wait, wait! Stella!

1105
01:12:31,227 --> 01:12:33,923
Bye, Boris.
It's been an education.

1106
01:12:33,963 --> 01:12:35,954
No, Stella, come back!

1107
01:12:35,998 --> 01:12:38,796
Do not go. Please. Stella!

1108
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:40,461
Stella-a-a-a!

1109
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:43,430
Now, that's more like it.

1110
01:12:45,675 --> 01:12:47,666
I... Well...

1111
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:51,771
The truth is I am
a low-altitude flyer.

1112
01:12:52,748 --> 01:12:54,909
What are you talking about?

1113
01:12:55,518 --> 01:12:57,577
I hate heights.

1114
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,611
That is why I lied to you.

1115
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:01,987
That was the problem?

1116
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:04,788
It wasn't me?
You?

1117
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:07,261
What could be wrong with you?

1118
01:13:07,296 --> 01:13:09,526
You are perfect.

1119
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:11,362
So you did notice.

1120
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,163
Now, let me get this straight.

1121
01:13:13,202 --> 01:13:16,535
All this fuss was because
you don't like to fly?

1122
01:13:16,572 --> 01:13:19,564
No matter what I answer, I sound foolish.

1123
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:21,542
Well, the way I see it,

1124
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:23,636
having a grounded goose for a boyfriend

1125
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,206
sure beats having a lying,
cheating, double-talking,

1126
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:29,717
no good, high-flying,
fair-weather fowl...

1127
01:13:29,752 --> 01:13:31,879
Did you say boyfriend?

1128
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:34,048
Among other things.

1129
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:35,352
Stella...

1130
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:38,360
Would you do me
the honor of joining me

1131
01:13:38,394 --> 01:13:41,625
for a little midnight swim?

1132
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:43,598
Swimming at midnight?

1133
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:45,293
I like it already.

1134
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:55,905
(Geese honking)

1135
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:06,886
(Chuckles) Did Dad
tell you when he saw
you leading the others

1136
01:14:06,922 --> 01:14:10,187
it was one of the proudest
moments of his life?

1137
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:13,392
Yeah, well, not
in so many words

1138
01:14:13,429 --> 01:14:15,693
but I got it.

1139
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:18,297
Hey. Hey, there he is!

1140
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:19,767
(Airplane approaching)

1141
01:14:19,802 --> 01:14:21,292
Living out a dream.

1142
01:14:33,783 --> 01:14:36,013
Nothing like it, huh, boy?

1143
01:14:37,019 --> 01:14:40,011
The wind across the water

1144
01:14:40,055 --> 01:14:43,081
A cloud across the skies

1145
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:45,787
The music in the echo

1146
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:49,229
Of the eagle as she cries

1147
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:52,200
The winter land at sunset

1148
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:55,635
The full moon on the rise

1149
01:14:55,671 --> 01:15:02,304
Everything, everything flies

1150
01:15:04,613 --> 01:15:07,605
A deer across the meadow

1151
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:10,278
A rabbit on the run

1152
01:15:10,753 --> 01:15:13,881
The young colt with a flashing tail

1153
01:15:13,923 --> 01:15:16,892
Leaping for the sun

1154
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:20,191
A million crystal snowflakes

1155
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:23,255
Dance before your eyes

1156
01:15:23,299 --> 01:15:29,363
Everything, everything flies

1157
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:32,397
Time and stars and innocence

1158
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:35,171
Childhood's waking dream

1159
01:15:35,211 --> 01:15:39,147
The spark that leaves a dying fire

1160
01:15:39,181 --> 01:15:44,847
The trout that breaks the stream

1161
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:50,716
A mother's prayers to heaven

1162
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:53,751
A young boy's paper kite

1163
01:15:53,796 --> 01:15:56,890
The breeze that brings the morning

1164
01:15:56,932 --> 01:16:00,026
A comet through the night

1165
01:16:00,069 --> 01:16:02,867
Aurora borealis

1166
01:16:02,905 --> 01:16:06,170
As it sweeps across the skies

1167
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:14,479
Everything, everything flies

1168
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:21,586
The moment that we first appear
something in us sees

1169
01:16:21,624 --> 01:16:25,458
We tell the world with arms unfurled

1170
01:16:25,494 --> 01:16:33,299
Give me sky, give me wings

1171
01:16:33,335 --> 01:16:40,104
Oooh-ooh-ooh

1172
01:16:45,848 --> 01:16:52,219
When we lift a heart with goodness
or lend a helping hand

1173
01:16:52,254 --> 01:16:55,189
We share the load upon the road

1174
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:58,352
Through despair and fragile lands

1175
01:16:58,394 --> 01:17:01,795
The things that keep us earthbound

1176
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:04,856
Melt before our eyes

1177
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:12,500
Everything, everything flies

1178
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:20,141
Everything flies

1179
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:32,225
Everything flies

1180
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:38,090
Everything, everything flies

1181
01:17:38,133 --> 01:17:43,435
Everything flies

1182
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:48,139
Everything flies...
