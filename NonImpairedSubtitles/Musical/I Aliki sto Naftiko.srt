1
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:30,942
Go, Vassilis!

2
00:02:31,987 --> 00:02:34,182
Vassilis is out of gas!

3
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:44,737
Guys, what about my ball?
Have they taken it? Who has?

4
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:46,506
There!

5
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,627
Oh! Let me see...

6
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:02,746
- You mean, they really took it?
- Can't you see?

7
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:05,143
That's impossible!
Well, l want my ball!

8
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,742
You, pirate! l want my ball!

9
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:14,265
- But what are they saying?
- They are not giving it to us.

10
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,943
Unbelievable! What's the meaning
of this? l'll show them now!

11
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:22,460
Hey, pirate! Give me my ball,
or l'll call the police!

12
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:26,496
lf you find a policeman in
bathing suit, send him over!

13
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:33,261
We say jokes like this to make
ice when the fridge is broken!

14
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:37,782
lt seems to me that
your fridge is broken again!

15
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,422
To hell with you!

16
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,056
Well, he went looking for it!
Don't tell me he didn't!

17
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,298
Guys, what's going
to happen to my ball?

18
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:48,344
They are just kidding.
We know them.

19
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:50,663
- Lakis, Lela...
- Paul...

20
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:53,580
- Do they live here, in Poros?
- They've come for the weekend.

21
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,335
- How come l don't know them?
- You haven't been here too long.

22
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:59,346
You are right.
What about that... funny lad?

23
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:03,217
- The one who was kidding around.
- A friend of Lakis's probably.

24
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:05,463
l'm going to get my ball.

25
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,063
- She is going to make a fuss.
- Nobody can stop her now.

26
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,417
She is such a strange girl...

27
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,702
Hey, you on the yacht!
We have sent a torpedo against you!

28
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,735
We've seen it
and we are ready for it!

29
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:23,820
lt's no big deal for us!

30
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,498
This is going to be very funny.
Get me a newspaper at once.

31
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:31,942
Didn't she call me a pirate?
Now you'll see!

32
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:34,024
Get ready to sail off.

33
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:37,305
She is getting closer.
This is going to be so funny.

34
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:41,498
Our torpedo reached its target.
Let's wait for it to explode.

35
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:45,696
Where is that funny guy,
if you please?

36
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:54,178
This way, miss.

37
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,736
What's going on?
ls it Halloween already?

38
00:04:57,027 --> 00:05:00,702
My beautiful lady, as you
correctly noticed right away...

39
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,422
this is a pirate ship.

40
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,538
Really? Don't tell me...

41
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:11,020
Yes, but don't worry. Your life
is not in any kind of danger.

42
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:14,023
Yours is, on the other hand.

43
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:18,824
l'm sorry, but l am inclined
to inform you...

44
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,417
that l shall hold you prisoner
until the ransom has been paid.

45
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:30,697
You, from the boat!
The girl is our prisoner!

46
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,939
You'll take her back only
if you give us 20 bottles of beer!

47
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:52,905
Mister Chief Pirate,
the ransom has been paid.

48
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,866
lt is only appropriate now
that you let her go.

49
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,701
There you are, miss...
l am setting you free.

50
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:04,423
l am not doing the same for you.
We'll see after this song.

51
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,703
Hurrah!

52
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,298
As you see, the situation is
reversed. l am the prisoner now.

53
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:14,142
And don't anyone pay for ransom
because l'll be very mad at him.

54
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:24,735
Go and tell them
that we are here.

55
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:28,545
- Guys, are you staying here?
- No, we're leaving on the yacht.

56
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,220
What about you?

57
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:41,140
Hey, mister! We are here.

58
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:44,141
- And who are you?
- The donkeys.

59
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,976
So, you are the donkeys?
And l thought...

60
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:51,537
Guys, sail off!

61
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:03,100
Which one was l riding?

62
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,904
They are all the same.

63
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,343
Miss, this is your donkey.

64
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:41,096
lf only my life
could always be like today...

65
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,863
when everything around us
is beautiful and peaceful...

66
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:48,942
and there is such a blue
and bright...

67
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,427
sky!

68
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:58,543
lf only time
could freeze right now...

69
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:02,382
so that this moment
could last forever...

70
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:07,577
not allowing for darkness
to ever cover us.

71
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:16,104
Go, my little donkey, go!

72
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:20,742
Go with the rest
of the donkeys...

73
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:24,265
My silly little donkey...

74
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,900
What is it, little donkey?

75
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:32,137
What do you want to run for?

76
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:35,460
Only the silly ones run.

77
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:40,455
Go wherever they want
to take you...

78
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:44,177
and let your horseshoes
sound on the ground...

79
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:47,260
let them sound...

80
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,860
and wherever you go...

81
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:55,656
if you want to live
a beautiful life...

82
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:59,377
never think like
a human being...

83
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:03,860
let it roll on quietly.

84
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:11,303
lf only my life
could always be like today...

85
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:15,222
when everything around us
is beautiful and peaceful...

86
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:20,343
and there is such a blue
and bright sky!

87
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,457
lf only time
could freeze right now...

88
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:32,496
so that this moment
could last forever... .

89
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:37,782
not allowing for darkness
to cover us!

90
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:47,215
And not allowing for darkness
to cover us!

91
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:56,023
lf only time
could freeze right now...

92
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:59,857
so that this moment
could last forever...

93
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:05,341
not allowing for darkness
to ever cover us!

94
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:31,380
Won't you put me down
to stand on my own feet?

95
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:36,061
- Thank you.
- For letting you stand?

96
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:38,020
For everything.

97
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,144
Hey, guys, listen up!

98
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:43,539
Those who are coming to Piraeus
on my yacht had better hurry.

99
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:46,261
- ls there some room for me?
- Sure.

100
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:52,422
- Aren't you coming with us?
- l am, if you want me...

101
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:55,096
The yacht is not mine, you know.

102
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:34,897
Girls, please step down.
We are going to hoist the sails.

103
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,707
- Do you mind?
- My pirate...

104
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:58,255
May l sit down?

105
00:11:58,547 --> 00:12:01,619
lf you promise that you won't
try to steal anything from me.

106
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:04,904
What if l tell you that
l have fears for the opposite?

107
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:08,496
That you might steal from me.

108
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:12,059
Do you have anything worth
stealing? ls it valuable?

109
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:16,261
l don't know about that.
lt is of great value for me.

110
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:20,096
lf l ever stole something,
it should be very valuable.

111
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:23,698
l won't do with some plastic
balls, like some people...

112
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:26,502
not to mention any names...

113
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,021
- We are here.
- Nice things don't last long.

114
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:54,901
lf they did, they might not
be nice anymore.

115
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:58,185
ls this something you believe,
or just a way to argue with me?

116
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:02,062
None of the two.
lt is something l fear.

117
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:04,343
Because of a disappointment?

118
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:07,579
l've no complains from my life.
l have been lucky up to now...

119
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,380
To the right!

120
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:16,419
- Well?
- All right...

121
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,464
On Saturday.

122
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,144
At 5.

123
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:23,743
Under the clock.

124
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:34,377
Ready?

125
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:41,417
And you don't even know
her name?

126
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,863
- Alice.
- Just that?

127
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:47,784
- Just her first name: Alice.
- You don't know anything else?

128
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:52,141
Nothing. She was with some
kids that my friends knew.

129
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:54,942
l didn't even know
most of them.

130
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:58,066
lt's hard to find out.
lf l don't go today...

131
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:01,857
Didn't you speak to mister
Papavassiliou? What did he say?

132
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,823
lmpossible. Penalties
are meant to be imposed.

133
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:12,262
The Commander! No, sit down!

134
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,301
- ls the Commander still inside?
- l think so.

135
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:19,780
Wait for me. l am going
to ask them to let me see him.

136
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,346
Costas!

137
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,903
You are late!

138
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:28,300
- ls that clear?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:29,621
You can go now.

140
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:31,455
Come in.

141
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,821
- The cadet l told you about.
- Show him in.

142
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:38,665
Degleris!

143
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,664
Fourth-year cadet,
Constantinos Degleris.

144
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,098
All right.

145
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:51,058
What is it, Degleris?

146
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:54,663
Commander, l wouldn't dare
disturb you for such a matter.

147
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:59,498
l am doing it because
it is a family emergency.

148
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,941
l can only tell you this, sir.
lt might be completely lost.

149
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,862
What might be lost?

150
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,098
Everything, Commander.

151
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:13,903
The fact that l was grounded,
quite unjustly l might add...

152
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:18,182
Well, if it is possible...
With interest, if l have to.

153
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,779
l could go out today and stay
inside the next two weekends.

154
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,944
Or the next three.

155
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,385
What do you say, Commander?
Could this be possible?

156
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:47,581
No.

157
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,945
l said no! And no means no!
ls that clear?

158
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:54,623
Daddy, why do you treat me
like l'm some petty officer?

159
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:56,977
Did l ask you for something
that difficult?

160
00:15:57,267 --> 00:16:00,782
Are you nuts? You're going to
the cinema at 5 in the afternoon?

161
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:04,503
Me and the girls agreed
to meet a little earlier...

162
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:08,900
to kid around, to have some
ice-cream... ls it so bad?

163
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,577
Do not say anything more
on the matter.

164
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:15,217
Your aunt and cousins are coming
and we are going out together.

165
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:18,823
What shall we say? That Alice
went to the movies at 5 p. m. ?

166
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:22,184
Never mind the movies. Can l
have an ice-cream and come back?

167
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,820
You are going nowhere!

168
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,420
ls that clear?

169
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:30,506
She is blonde and tanned,
like a well-baked bagel.

170
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:33,825
You'll see her under the clock.
Go to her bravely and say...

171
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:38,146
"On behalf of your pirate. "
She'll understand.

172
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:42,226
She will... And then,
you'll explain to her.

173
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:45,220
- What shall l explain to him?
- What do you think?

174
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:48,903
That l wasn't allowed to go out
and l'd like him to call me.

175
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:52,856
- During the hours l've written.
- And how shall l know him?

176
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:55,377
His name is Costas.

177
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:58,585
He is tall, with brown hair
and green eyes.

178
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:02,902
How shall l speak to a stranger?
What if it is not him?

179
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,019
Wait!

180
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:11,984
lt's the ball l told you about.

181
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:18,815
lf he sees it, he'll know it
and will approach you instead.

182
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:23,225
Go on, it's 10 past 4!
You are going to be late! Go!

183
00:18:21,627 --> 00:18:23,345
- Miss Alice?
- Pardon?

184
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:27,501
On behalf of your pirate.
Your pirate...

185
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:31,220
Beware of the heat!
lt's bad for you!

186
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,661
- Nothing.
- What do you mean?

187
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,263
She probably didn't come.
Not to mention the embarrassment.

188
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:56,019
l saw a blonde, just like you
said and l walked towards her.

189
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:59,185
"Miss Alice?" l asked her.
She probably didn't understand.

190
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:01,498
"On behalf of your pirate",
l said to her.

191
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:04,347
And she said,
"The heat is bad for you. "

192
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:10,058
lmpossible. She is not like
the girls who don't show up.

193
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,261
- She must have come!
- Do you think l am crazy?

194
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:17,183
Are you sure there was no girl
under the clock?

195
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,942
- Under the clock?
- Wasn't there any girl?

196
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:22,743
- There was one.
- What did she look like?

197
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:26,259
No way!
She can't have been her!

198
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:29,824
lt was a girl with dark hair
holding a...

199
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:33,663
How do you call it...
A... plastic ball.

200
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,377
A ball, you say?
What kind of ball?

201
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,501
A plastic ball
for playing in the sea.

202
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,778
That was her!

203
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:54,946
Costas, she wasn't blonde.
She had dark hair.

204
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,500
Dark hair...

205
00:20:58,587 --> 00:21:00,896
She must have dyed it.
Women are like that.

206
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:04,145
Dark hair today and fair
tomorrow. Go figure...

207
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:09,705
Costas, she was also plump.

208
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:18,858
- How plump do you mean?
- Quite plump.

209
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:25,344
She's gained weight. She grew
an appetite and got fatter.

210
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:28,016
Who are we to tell her
not to eat?

211
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:33,867
Costas, she was short too.

212
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:39,542
- Short? How short?
- Short enough.

213
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:43,659
Could it be that you stood on
the pavement and she did not?

214
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:47,064
No, Costas, l'm not stupid.
The girl was short.

215
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:51,824
- How short was she?
- Up to here.

216
00:21:57,387 --> 00:22:00,185
- l'm confused now.
- Short...

217
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:04,500
She may have got fatter, but
how could she become shorter?

218
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,460
How could she?

219
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:09,857
Tell me again,
how short was she?

220
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:12,463
She was up to here, Costas.

221
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:21,457
- lmpossible.
- Why is it impossible?

222
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:25,502
To say that it was a short cadet
with long nose and black eyes...

223
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:27,379
of course it is impossible.

224
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:31,501
lf he had one black eye, l'd
say that they had blackened it.

225
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:35,581
But they were both black.
And then, you say he was short.

226
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:37,459
No more!

227
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:43,301
There it goes now,
there goes the dream, l think.

228
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:50,458
l know she doesn't love me
and l'll never find her again.

229
00:22:52,347 --> 00:22:57,705
There it goes now,
but how can l say it to you?

230
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:05,064
Though she doesn't love me,
l love her even more!

231
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:12,577
Though she doesn't love me,
l love her even more!

232
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:05,943
This year's ball
is a great success, isn't it?

233
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:09,105
- Greater than the last year's.
- Here comes our Commander.

234
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:12,017
How are you?

235
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:14,657
Good evening.

236
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,066
Takis?

237
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:23,386
l've come especially for you,
to talk about the old times.

238
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:27,419
Who is the young lady? Don't
tell me it's your daughter.

239
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:30,660
- lt is. Mister Panagakis.
- Happy to meet you.

240
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:33,905
l was happy for you 20 years
ago, when you were born.

241
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:37,975
He is a good old friend.
The pasta we've cooked for him...

242
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:42,940
- l didn't see her last year.
- She was in Switzerland.

243
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,980
She studied there for 3 years.
She only came back a month ago.

244
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:47,740
Alice!

245
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:51,465
Come, it's Spiros.

246
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:54,540
How are you, Spiros?
Come now, sit down...

247
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:57,381
Go on, young lady. You'll
be bored with us the old men.

248
00:24:57,627 --> 00:25:00,061
Who are you calling old?
Go on...

249
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:04,338
How are you?

250
00:25:04,707 --> 00:25:08,256
She's a young lady...
So many years have passed...

251
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,982
Don't remind me.

252
00:25:12,587 --> 00:25:14,100
Good evening.

253
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:18,379
ls Sophia here too?
Where is she?

254
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:22,064
- She's dancing over there.
- There she is.

255
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:24,458
Sophia!

256
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,658
Sophia...

257
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:32,746
What's wrong?

258
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:35,980
Nothing.
Excuse me for a moment.

259
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:39,625
Excuse me, Jenny.

260
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:46,977
My pirate...

261
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:51,462
And tonight you are really
something worth stealing.

262
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:53,898
What about that Saturday?

263
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:57,658
Don't "aha" me! You never
showed up, Mr. No-good Pirate.

264
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:02,501
Or was it the other way around?
Perhaps you never showed up.

265
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:04,903
- Why? Did you?
- Did you?

266
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:08,385
- l'm asking you. Did you go?
- And l'm asking you. Did you?

267
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:11,016
Let's say l didn't go.
Did you?

268
00:26:13,027 --> 00:26:16,702
You know something? Shall we
talk about this while dancing?

269
00:26:16,987 --> 00:26:18,625
Yes.

270
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:25,100
Good evening!

271
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:27,099
- Who is this?
- lt's Chronis.

272
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:29,658
Hello, Chronis.

273
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:33,696
- Are you wearing glasses?
- lt's some strange eye problem.

274
00:26:33,987 --> 00:26:36,865
Strange things always happen
to me. lt's temporary though.

275
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:40,941
lt is very annoying, because
l cannot recognize other people.

276
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:46,343
And l said, "lt couldn't be
a short guy with a big nose. "

277
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:49,938
My pirate has a pretty nice
nose at least.

278
00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:52,826
To give the devil his due now.

279
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:55,542
l went nuts when he told me
about the ball.

280
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,303
But then, dark haired, plump
and short? There was no way.

281
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:04,023
Who is that? The girl
dancing with Degleris.

282
00:27:04,427 --> 00:27:08,261
What? Don't you know her? She's
your Commander's daughter.

283
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,221
What did you say?
Our Commander's daughter?

284
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:14,779
l must warn him. That she is
our Commander's daughter.

285
00:27:15,107 --> 00:27:17,746
- Do you think he doesn't know?
- Would he dance like that?

286
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:21,258
The Commander is mad at him.
He mustn't see him like that.

287
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:27,985
l am sorry to interrupt.
Come with me for a moment.

288
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:32,260
Are you nuts? Why should l leave
the girl l nearly lost once?

289
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:35,898
Someone has asked for you.
You must go to the gate at once.

290
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:39,544
- Go, if it is an emergency.
- l'll be right back.

291
00:27:39,947 --> 00:27:42,381
See you in a moment
on the stairs.

292
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,624
l hope you come this time.

293
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:48,098
Don't send any shorty
with a long nose again.

294
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,504
Let's go.

295
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,140
Wait, where are we going?
On a field trip?

296
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:07,184
- We are okay here.
- Don't they need me at the gate?

297
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:10,698
Forget about the gate. l must
tell you something important.

298
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:13,097
Why did we have to go
so far away?

299
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:22,904
Do you know who is the girl
you are dancing with like that?

300
00:28:23,307 --> 00:28:25,537
- Of course l know.
- And you are not scared?

301
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,823
- Scared of what?
- Tell me, who is she?

302
00:28:28,027 --> 00:28:29,699
The girl l'd meet at the clock.

303
00:28:30,347 --> 00:28:33,464
lf she was just that girl,
it would be alright.

304
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:35,936
She is the Commander's daughter.

305
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:40,460
The one you were dancing with?
The cadet? Costas Degleris.

306
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:43,858
Do you know what happened
between me and Degleris?

307
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,896
lt was like an old man looking
for the glasses he's wearing.

308
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:50,743
- What are you looking for?
- My glasses.

309
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:52,625
You are wearing them.

310
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:56,099
Damn... l'm starting
to believe that l got old.

311
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:00,061
- Do what l'm telling you.
- What are you telling me?

312
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:02,981
- Disappear.
- Are you crazy?

313
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:06,219
You are the crazy one! Do you
want to waste your time?

314
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:08,384
He's already mad at you.

315
00:29:11,747 --> 00:29:14,466
He went to the gate.
There he is...

316
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:17,702
Let me see who he is already!

317
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:20,746
Girls, he's coming for me.
Please, go away.

318
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:29,338
Well, here l am, Mr. Pirate.
Shall we continue our dance...

319
00:29:29,707 --> 00:29:32,426
which we left unfinished,
like Schubert's symphony?

320
00:29:32,747 --> 00:29:34,977
Of course we'll continue it.

321
00:29:48,907 --> 00:29:51,626
- What about Degleris?
- l'll tell you.

322
00:30:00,787 --> 00:30:05,065
Did you by any chance meet some
kind of a voice-taking witch?

323
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:07,936
- Why do you say that?
- You are not speaking at all.

324
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,985
What should l say?

325
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:13,022
You don't have anything
to tell me, do you?

326
00:30:16,187 --> 00:30:18,064
Thank you very much.

327
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:24,065
Alice! Come here, my child.

328
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:32,099
Good night.

329
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:35,103
Good night.

330
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:40,537
Have a good night.
Glad to see you, child.

331
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,697
- What's going on?
- They are leaving.

332
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:53,897
Good night, Commander.

333
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:10,382
lt's been very nice tonight.
The music was good too.

334
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:13,176
Better and better every year.

335
00:31:18,747 --> 00:31:22,456
Alice! Come here, child.
Come on now, we are leaving.

336
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:50,179
l am amazed at myself!
How could l be so rude!

337
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:54,381
Rude more than anything...
What will the girl think?

338
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:57,898
You'll explain to her some time.
lf you're still interested.

339
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:01,265
- You don't understand!
- What should l understand?

340
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:06,139
That this girl is...
That l am going nuts.

341
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,898
- Why would you go nuts?
- Because it's like that.

342
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,459
Think about it. You see me
out of a sudden, mister...

343
00:32:13,707 --> 00:32:16,699
and you are acting like a man
who sees the sea after 10 years.

344
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:19,825
Had you been a dog, you'd be
wagging your tail like crazy.

345
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:21,859
You were so happy...

346
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:26,305
Then, all of sudden, you become
speechless and very cold.

347
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:29,181
Why? What have l done to you?

348
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:32,340
lf l've done you wrong, tell me
and l shall apologize to you.

349
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,942
lt's really a mystery.

350
00:32:35,347 --> 00:32:40,262
Yes, but l don't care so much
about mysteries...

351
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:45,866
so, l'll try to figure it out
first thing tomorrow.

352
00:32:47,427 --> 00:32:52,217
Extend, raise and stretch your
hands! One-two-three-four!

353
00:32:53,107 --> 00:32:55,143
One-two-three-halt!

354
00:32:55,627 --> 00:32:59,017
The same! Begin!
One-two-three-four!

355
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,697
l'm sorry,
but this is the procedure.

356
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:04,545
l understand.

357
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:08,099
Extending and stretching out
the hands along with clapping!

358
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:11,579
One-two-three-four!
One-two-three-four!

359
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:19,217
- Come in, miss.
- Thank you.

360
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:26,137
March forward!

361
00:33:42,307 --> 00:33:44,775
Look over there!

362
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:48,897
- l told you to look over there!
- l did!

363
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,616
And you look over there now!

364
00:34:06,307 --> 00:34:09,344
- Do you know where Degleris is?
- Around here, miss!

365
00:34:15,827 --> 00:34:17,704
Alice!

366
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:26,262
Lazarus, come forward.

367
00:34:27,787 --> 00:34:30,096
- Has she gone?
- She has.

368
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:34,503
Degleris, what are you doing?

369
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:37,058
Diving exercises, sir.

370
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:44,703
- l don't like this.
- But why, daddy?

371
00:34:45,227 --> 00:34:48,583
- What did you come here for?
- To ask you...

372
00:34:49,307 --> 00:34:52,822
Whether l'm letting you go to
the theatre with Liza tonight.

373
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:56,825
Why didn't you ask me before
l left home in the morning?

374
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:58,460
l forgot.

375
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:00,698
Why didn't you wait
to tell me at noon?

376
00:35:00,947 --> 00:35:04,656
l was afraid l'd forget again.
Since l remembered it...

377
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:09,018
- Why didn't you phone me?
- l thought l'd take a walk.

378
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:14,256
Next time you want to tell me
something, you should call me.

379
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:18,826
And if you feel like taking
a walk, go somewhere else.

380
00:35:19,347 --> 00:35:22,225
The Academy is not the
proper place for... walks.

381
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:24,697
- All right.
- All right, what?

382
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:29,345
You said something and l agree.
ls it so bad? Tell me if it is.

383
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:01,064
Alkis...

384
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,897
Alkis!

385
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:09,779
Alkis!

386
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:16,140
Pssst! Alkis!

387
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,459
l'm just beginning to realize
how much l love her.

388
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,898
And you chose to tell me
at this time of the night?

389
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:27,980
Couldn't it wait
till tomorrow morning?

390
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:30,417
- l can't sleep.
- l can though.

391
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:33,660
Does it feel right to let me
stay awake all by myself?

392
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:37,775
Sure it does. Should l lie awake
because you've fallen in love?

393
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:00,704
Takis...

394
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:03,580
Ha?

395
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:08,176
- You are not sleeping either.
- No, l can't sleep.

396
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:10,943
Thinking about your girl?

397
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:13,781
No, l've had too much melon.

398
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:22,466
Takis, do you know anything
about that training trip?

399
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:25,142
- When are we leaving?
- On Wednesday.

400
00:37:27,867 --> 00:37:29,505
Good...

401
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:32,224
Next Wednesday?

402
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:34,977
- That's right.
- On the training ship?

403
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:37,019
Of course, what else?

404
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:40,823
- And are you all going?
- What do you mean by "all"?

405
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:46,264
The whole Academy?
The cadets too?

406
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:50,582
Especially the cadets. Those
trips are for their training.

407
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:53,705
Are all the cadets going?

408
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:57,185
Would you like us
to leave one behind?

409
00:37:57,507 --> 00:38:00,419
To do what? Jesus...

410
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:03,344
Alice!

411
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:08,264
- Don't let them wait for you.
- And don't be late!

412
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:21,338
Hello!

413
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:24,097
Hi, how are you?

414
00:38:49,947 --> 00:38:52,939
For your information,
your daughter is in love.

415
00:38:54,787 --> 00:38:57,540
- And very much so.
- With whom?

416
00:38:57,987 --> 00:39:01,377
l don't know about that.
l just know that she's in love.

417
00:39:31,947 --> 00:39:36,816
And, if l may ask you, how have
you reached this conclusion?

418
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:41,738
- That Alice is in love.
- l've noticed.

419
00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:43,984
You've noticed what?

420
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:47,105
The symptoms of this "illness"
are so typical...

421
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:50,459
Temper, loss of appetite,
staying in her bedroom...

422
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:52,818
crying with no reason...

423
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:56,338
- l know because l've had them.
- You've had those symptoms?

424
00:39:56,707 --> 00:40:01,098
l have also been in love.
With you, silly.

425
00:40:02,587 --> 00:40:07,980
Remember? You were a cadet.
You were about to sail off...

426
00:40:08,547 --> 00:40:11,584
and watching the preparations
l said to myself...

427
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:15,377
"Virgin Mary! lf only l could
sneak inside the ship... "

428
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:17,902
Well, l'll sneak inside!

429
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:21,862
- How are you going to do it?
- l haven't figured it out yet.

430
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:25,304
But l'm sure
l'll think of something.

431
00:40:25,707 --> 00:40:28,301
Left-right! Left-right!

432
00:40:30,107 --> 00:40:32,746
Left-right!

433
00:40:38,947 --> 00:40:40,539
Left-right!

434
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:42,740
More lively now!

435
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:47,141
The song says it. No medicines
or change of scenery may help.

436
00:40:47,387 --> 00:40:49,184
No talking, Vranas!

437
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:51,743
Left-right! Left-right!

438
00:41:09,507 --> 00:41:13,102
Have a safe trip
and call me.

439
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:17,143
- Where is Alice?
- At the car.

440
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:34,623
Are we ready? Good...

441
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,817
- Goodbye then.
- Have a safe trip.

442
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:40,183
- And listen to your mother.
- Yes, sir!

443
00:42:03,907 --> 00:42:06,182
Do you understand? And hurry.

444
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:08,106
Mom!

445
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,939
Daddy left his suitcase!

446
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:17,057
- How did he forget about it?
- l don't know. lt was outside.

447
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:19,816
l put it into the car!

448
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:25,506
Perhaps the sailor took it out
to put something else inside.

449
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:29,537
- l put it in the car myself!
- That's what l'm saying, lrene!

450
00:42:29,787 --> 00:42:31,982
You put it in the car and
the sailor took it outside...

451
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:34,303
and left it on the pavement.

452
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:37,778
- Wait, l'll call him.
- Who are you going to call?

453
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:40,946
Your father, to tell him
to send for it.

454
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,464
The car doesn't have a phone.
Where are you going to call him?

455
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:46,942
Daddy won't be there
for at least half an hour.

456
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:50,020
lf you call him in half
an hour and he sends a car...

457
00:42:50,507 --> 00:42:53,544
they'd need an hour to come
here and go back again.

458
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:57,422
There are things that he needs
in the suitcase. How do you know?

459
00:42:57,947 --> 00:43:01,337
l can imagine. lt's a suitcase,
so it has things that he needs.

460
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,658
Would he put a vase inside?

461
00:43:03,907 --> 00:43:06,137
- l'll call at the Academy.
- l'll go, mommy.

462
00:43:06,547 --> 00:43:08,583
What's the big deal?
l'm getting a cab.

463
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:11,222
Call and tell them to let me
go through just in case.

464
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:15,062
- We'd better send lrene.
- lrene can't handle this.

465
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:18,265
She'll get mixed up and go
to a different place.

466
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:47,984
lt's daddy's suitcase.
The Commander's, that is.

467
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:50,817
Leave it here.
l'll send it at once.

468
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:54,384
Can l take it to him?
l need to tell him something.

469
00:43:54,787 --> 00:43:57,301
- You see, l am...
- Miss Alice!

470
00:43:58,747 --> 00:44:01,944
Hello! How are you?
Of course l remember you.

471
00:44:02,587 --> 00:44:04,737
Have you come
to see your father off?

472
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:09,226
He forgot his suitcase, but
they won't let me go through.

473
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:12,223
- Send it at once.
- No!

474
00:44:12,747 --> 00:44:16,865
l'd like to board the ship
to tell him something important.

475
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:20,862
ls this so hard? Come now...

476
00:44:23,107 --> 00:44:26,099
- Let her go through.
- Thank you!

477
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:48,259
Take the suitcase and lead the
young lady to the Commander.

478
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:51,147
- l know how to go there.
- This way, miss.

479
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:57,423
Do you know what l'm thinking
about? Where can she be now?

480
00:44:57,747 --> 00:45:02,218
Can you do me a favour?
Take the suitcase to my father.

481
00:45:02,587 --> 00:45:06,023
And don't tell him l'm here.
l want to surprise him.

482
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:08,662
- Yes, miss.
- Thank you.

483
00:45:52,787 --> 00:45:55,062
Pull up the staircase!

484
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:01,262
Ready to sail off!

485
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:06,060
Both engines
reverse half speed.

486
00:46:07,707 --> 00:46:09,823
The helm to the right!

487
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:44,941
- Play some music!
- l'm eating now!

488
00:47:45,347 --> 00:47:47,258
Come on now, play!

489
00:47:47,627 --> 00:47:49,424
Leave the bread!

490
00:48:46,747 --> 00:48:48,977
- You are very good.
- Play the other song too.

491
00:48:49,267 --> 00:48:50,586
No more now.

492
00:48:56,707 --> 00:48:58,902
My bread! Where is my bread?

493
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:02,900
ls this why you told me
to play the harmonica?

494
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,858
Like the raven and the fox?
Give me the bread!

495
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:10,742
The raven is not so foolish,
like in the time Aesopus lived.

496
00:49:11,387 --> 00:49:14,663
This is not your bread!
Let it go! lt's my bread!

497
00:49:14,987 --> 00:49:17,023
- lt's mine!
- What happened to my bread?

498
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:19,656
How should l know?
This is mine, l swear!

499
00:49:20,547 --> 00:49:22,663
Give me my bread!

500
00:49:59,587 --> 00:50:03,136
- Are you gloomy again?
- Leave me alone.

501
00:50:04,147 --> 00:50:07,344
Well, this is becoming
a joke now.

502
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:10,347
- Do you think it's funny?
- Not to say ridiculous.

503
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,744
- Unacceptable for a man like you.
- You don't know my problem.

504
00:50:13,987 --> 00:50:15,978
What is your problem?

505
00:50:17,067 --> 00:50:19,217
Let's talk over here.

506
00:50:32,747 --> 00:50:36,183
Can you understand it?
lt has become like a nightmare.

507
00:50:36,587 --> 00:50:38,782
l cannot concentrate,
or find any peace.

508
00:50:39,187 --> 00:50:42,941
lt's like she is a ghost.
l can even hear her voice.

509
00:50:43,387 --> 00:50:45,821
- Nonsense...
- l can hear her voice.

510
00:50:46,187 --> 00:50:47,586
Mister Pirate...

511
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:50,058
Damn! l can hear her too!

512
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:54,657
- lmpossible!
- l am scared, Costas.

513
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,065
Alice!

514
00:50:57,627 --> 00:51:01,620
Ghosts don't go out at noon
for sunbathing.

515
00:51:02,027 --> 00:51:05,224
Don't look around. Just look
whether someone is coming.

516
00:51:06,387 --> 00:51:07,945
Nobody is coming.

517
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:10,464
Good morning!

518
00:51:10,987 --> 00:51:13,376
lt's a nice weather today.
Don't you think?

519
00:51:13,707 --> 00:51:17,097
l've never seen a pirate
so confused in my life.

520
00:51:17,627 --> 00:51:19,140
Someone's coming.

521
00:51:24,187 --> 00:51:25,939
Stay where you are.

522
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:29,259
l feel numb.
l need to stretch my legs.

523
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:31,583
Please, Alice,
don't say crazy things.

524
00:51:36,147 --> 00:51:38,786
- What is going to happen?
- l have an idea.

525
00:51:39,187 --> 00:51:41,257
Don't you move it from here, miss.

526
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:44,135
l swear, you guys.
And for a moment...

527
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:47,346
What is it?

528
00:51:47,747 --> 00:51:52,184
Those guys were talking and one
of them spoke like a woman.

529
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:56,103
ln the end, the tall guy
called the other one "Alice".

530
00:51:56,427 --> 00:51:58,895
- Go to hell!
- l swear to you!

531
00:51:59,627 --> 00:52:01,697
Come with me.

532
00:52:17,227 --> 00:52:19,695
- ls everyone alerted?
- Yes, they are all coming.

533
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:25,182
- Hurry up!
- Why did you call for us?

534
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:34,736
- Are the doors closed?
- Yes!

535
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:37,423
ls everyone here?

536
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:40,897
Come with me.

537
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:49,663
We called you here for a very
serious and top secret matter.

538
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,379
We rely on your chivalry,
your discretion...

539
00:52:53,747 --> 00:52:56,784
and the sense of solidarity
that exists among us.

540
00:52:57,147 --> 00:52:58,865
Tell us!

541
00:53:00,107 --> 00:53:02,302
Gentlemen, l'll say it
in just two words.

542
00:53:03,187 --> 00:53:05,303
There is a mine aboard ship.

543
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:09,059
And l repeat, a live mine.

544
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,226
Live, completely live!
And blonde.

545
00:53:14,307 --> 00:53:17,504
And to be more precise on the
matter, most of you guys...

546
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:21,462
know about the love drama our
friend Degleris is experiencing.

547
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:24,864
All of you remember, don't you?
Well, Degleris...

548
00:53:25,227 --> 00:53:27,422
- Wait, let me speak now.
- Go ahead then.

549
00:53:27,707 --> 00:53:29,902
About 3 months ago,
Degleris...

550
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:34,056
- 2 and a half months.
- About 2 and a half months ago...

551
00:53:36,907 --> 00:53:40,786
Take out the cover of the boat
and fold it carefully...

552
00:53:41,187 --> 00:53:44,145
Or rather leave it for now
and come with me.

553
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:49,543
- And at the first harbour...
- How shall we bring her here?

554
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,505
Gentlemen, there is a solution
to this problem also.

555
00:53:53,827 --> 00:53:56,944
But we must find somebody
with almost the same height.

556
00:54:00,827 --> 00:54:03,341
Papasotiriou, come here.
Costas!

557
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:07,778
What? Are we dancing now?

558
00:54:08,387 --> 00:54:10,457
l need to check you out.

559
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:14,337
No. She was just up to here.

560
00:54:18,747 --> 00:54:20,977
Come here, Nakos.

561
00:54:26,787 --> 00:54:29,665
- This should be all right.
- Undress!

562
00:54:29,907 --> 00:54:32,944
- What am l going to do?
- Pretend to be sick.

563
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:37,738
This daring operation must be
executed only by volunteers.

564
00:54:38,147 --> 00:54:41,662
There must be 5 of us. Takis,
Costas and l will be the three.

565
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:45,463
We need 2 more. Those of you who
wish to come, raise your hand.

566
00:54:46,547 --> 00:54:48,617
Thanks a lot, boys.

567
00:54:49,147 --> 00:54:52,139
Guys, we are ready.
Here is the uniform.

568
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:56,622
Quiet, boys.

569
00:55:01,707 --> 00:55:03,823
Take it easy.

570
00:55:04,107 --> 00:55:08,100
Guys, we must leave quietly
not to raise any suspicions.

571
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:12,665
Some of you stand in some parts
of the route to cover us.

572
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:17,739
We can't leave all together.
Costas, leave with Takis.

573
00:55:18,507 --> 00:55:21,624
Apostolou will go by himself
and then, Papadopoulos and l.

574
00:55:21,987 --> 00:55:23,420
All right?

575
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,457
Let's go.

576
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:29,301
- Let's go with the help of God.
- Amen.

577
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:09,418
Let's go. Guys, as we agreed.
All right?

578
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:27,537
l drink water over and over
and l have a full belly.

579
00:56:48,707 --> 00:56:52,586
The one called Alice by the
other one had a round belly.

580
00:56:52,987 --> 00:56:56,900
- You are impossible!
- Why do you hit me, guys?

581
00:56:57,427 --> 00:56:59,338
- Understood?
- Yes.

582
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,618
The clothes, boys.

583
00:57:09,707 --> 00:57:13,222
When you are ready, tell us
and wait there.

584
00:57:13,587 --> 00:57:16,101
- We'll tell you when to come out.
- Okay.

585
00:57:16,427 --> 00:57:18,895
Apostolou, go over there
to check things out.

586
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:33,221
- l am ready.
- Wait for a moment.

587
00:57:48,587 --> 00:57:50,976
- Hurry up, guys.
- Come on out.

588
00:57:57,187 --> 00:57:59,417
Walk forward
like nothing is happening!

589
00:58:27,747 --> 00:58:29,897
You are something else!

590
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:35,656
This is not acceptable.

591
00:58:36,827 --> 00:58:38,146
Come in!

592
00:58:40,427 --> 00:58:43,021
Bringing you a sample
of the food, sir.

593
00:58:45,227 --> 00:58:47,661
Commander,
would you like to try it?

594
00:58:50,867 --> 00:58:54,018
l left my glasses
at my cabin again.

595
00:58:54,507 --> 00:58:57,226
- What's for today?
- Fish.

596
00:58:57,787 --> 00:59:01,826
lf you were patient, the mystery
wouldn't be a mystery any more.

597
00:59:02,227 --> 00:59:05,697
Why didn't you tell me to wait?
Why didn't you explain to me?

598
00:59:06,227 --> 00:59:09,697
- l got confused that night.
- You should call, or write.

599
00:59:10,787 --> 00:59:12,743
lt's all simple to you.

600
00:59:13,147 --> 00:59:14,865
Guys!

601
00:59:15,587 --> 00:59:18,340
l am sorry to interrupt, but
you can talk about it later.

602
00:59:18,587 --> 00:59:22,057
There are more pressing
matters at hand here.

603
00:59:22,507 --> 00:59:26,420
This situation is unprecedented
and if they find out about it...

604
00:59:26,747 --> 00:59:30,422
not only must we all be expelled
but we should get hung too.

605
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:33,659
The young lady must disembark
at the next harbour.

606
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,626
- l will then.
- That's easier said than done.

607
00:59:36,947 --> 00:59:40,064
This is not a bus, where
anyone can get on or off.

608
00:59:40,427 --> 00:59:43,419
What if she goes ashore among
the others wearing the uniform?

609
00:59:43,707 --> 00:59:46,744
This is the only way, but what
if the Commander is present?

610
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:51,023
The other officers might
not notice one more cadet... .

611
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:56,860
though l doubt it, but the
Commander is bound to know her.

612
00:59:57,227 --> 00:59:58,945
That's right.

613
00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:03,380
Let's take his glasses!
He can't see anything without them!

614
01:00:04,707 --> 01:00:07,824
- That's it!
- The glasses is an idea.

615
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:10,822
- What's that?
- lt's the signal for dinner.

616
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,177
- Good. Let's eat.
- Are you crazy?

617
01:00:13,507 --> 01:00:14,656
l'm hungry.

618
01:00:14,947 --> 01:00:17,017
You can't possibly
come to the dining-room.

619
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:20,543
They won't know it's me
among so many men. Let's go.

620
01:00:20,947 --> 01:00:23,939
l feel like putting on a life-
jacket and falling into the sea.

621
01:00:24,227 --> 01:00:27,219
- Please, stay here.
- OK, but won't l have dinner?

622
01:00:27,547 --> 01:00:30,061
- We'll bring you food.
- We'll bring you something to eat.

623
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:31,940
Bring me a lot of food.

624
01:01:03,787 --> 01:01:06,426
- Are you sick?
- No, l'm fine.

625
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:09,705
- Then, why are you in bed?
- You are wearing my clothes.

626
01:01:10,027 --> 01:01:13,099
These are yours?
Would you like to trade places?

627
01:01:13,307 --> 01:01:14,979
What do you mean?

628
01:01:15,267 --> 01:01:18,418
l could stay in bed and give
you the clothes to go and eat.

629
01:01:19,187 --> 01:01:22,577
- Will you stay like that?
- l hope they'll remember me.

630
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:27,219
The army boots are so big.

631
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:31,423
First l make a step inside
the boots and then they move.

632
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:34,898
l'm telling you, our basketball
team will crash you.

633
01:01:35,347 --> 01:01:37,781
- We are stronger.
- We'll see about that.

634
01:01:38,547 --> 01:01:40,583
And it will be noon.

635
01:01:48,547 --> 01:01:51,459
- They are late.
- Yes, they are.

636
01:01:53,227 --> 01:01:56,219
lt seems that you eat well
at the Navy.

637
01:01:57,387 --> 01:01:59,537
Costas, Takis, move!

638
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:03,343
Take it easy!

639
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:07,457
Come, Costas!

640
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:10,105
Guys!

641
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:13,256
Alla una, alla due, alla tre!

642
01:02:13,827 --> 01:02:15,545
Hurrah!

643
01:02:16,947 --> 01:02:19,939
Guys, don't shout so loudly,
because we are dead.

644
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:23,339
We could cheer in a lower
voice, like this: Hurrah...

645
01:02:27,387 --> 01:02:31,778
Easy! The bottles go below!
Put the appetisers above!

646
01:02:33,627 --> 01:02:37,142
We have one here too.
Take some of these too.

647
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:41,618
But, this is a proper dinner!

648
01:02:42,187 --> 01:02:45,657
Of course it's a proper dinner.
lt's your engagement dinner.

649
01:02:46,227 --> 01:02:47,899
Bravo!

650
01:02:48,427 --> 01:02:51,180
Lower your voices,
or we are all going to prison.

651
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,059
lt's a triumph, gentlemen!

652
01:02:53,307 --> 01:02:55,059
Daddy's glasses!

653
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:59,103
- How did you do it?
- l got lucky.

654
01:02:59,467 --> 01:03:02,618
He'd left them on a table and
as soon as l got the chance...

655
01:03:06,627 --> 01:03:09,699
Holy Christ... Where on earth
have l left them again?

656
01:03:10,027 --> 01:03:12,541
- Steward...
- At your service.

657
01:03:13,027 --> 01:03:15,985
ls that you, son?
Go to my cabin, please.

658
01:03:16,507 --> 01:03:19,499
l've left my glasses there.
Go on...

659
01:03:35,987 --> 01:03:37,943
Oh no... Oh no!

660
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:41,186
She's laughing too much
and l don't like it at all.

661
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:44,903
She's getting crazy when sober.
lmagine now that she's drunk.

662
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:46,859
Costas!

663
01:03:52,907 --> 01:03:55,102
Come on, Alice, that's enough.

664
01:03:55,387 --> 01:03:58,504
- l haven't drunk anything yet.
- The others want to drink too.

665
01:03:58,827 --> 01:04:00,340
All right, take it.

666
01:04:03,947 --> 01:04:06,586
Tell me, am l the superior
or are you?

667
01:04:07,387 --> 01:04:09,776
- l'd say that l am.
- Not likely. l am.

668
01:04:18,707 --> 01:04:21,619
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. l'm thinking.

669
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:24,178
About my future.

670
01:04:24,747 --> 01:04:27,659
What l'm going to do now that
l'll be kicked off the Navy.

671
01:04:27,987 --> 01:04:29,864
l must do something to get by.

672
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:31,938
Shall we do a trio?

673
01:04:32,227 --> 01:04:33,979
Guys! Sh!

674
01:04:34,307 --> 01:04:37,458
lt was a wonderful dinner,
but it can't end in silence.

675
01:04:37,787 --> 01:04:40,904
Dancing and singing
is in order.

676
01:04:42,547 --> 01:04:45,857
lt's clear now.
We are finished.

677
01:04:46,187 --> 01:04:48,337
- What did you say?
- Nothing...

678
01:04:48,707 --> 01:04:53,383
We could do without the song,
or we could just say a psalm...

679
01:04:53,747 --> 01:04:56,978
and then fall into the sea
one by one. What do you think?

680
01:04:57,547 --> 01:05:01,096
You are right. lf we have time
to fall before they drop us.

681
01:05:01,587 --> 01:05:05,978
We are going to sing!
We'll sing and dance, right?

682
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:10,979
This is a mystery, because l
remember they were on the table!

683
01:05:11,747 --> 01:05:15,137
- Did you search the place?
- Yes, sir. They are not there.

684
01:05:15,507 --> 01:05:17,702
We've looked everywhere.

685
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,219
Could l by any chance wear
them and haven't noticed?

686
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:23,936
Yes...

687
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:44,144
Move on and fear nothing.
We need to be brave in our life.

688
01:05:45,747 --> 01:05:50,867
And hope always keeps us
good company.

689
01:05:53,067 --> 01:05:58,539
You shouldn't burden your heart
with bitterness or sadness.

690
01:05:59,867 --> 01:06:05,658
Move on and fear nothing!
Move on and have no worries!

691
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:09,943
Move on not thinking
about the future!

692
01:06:10,387 --> 01:06:13,743
Move on and do
whatever you like!

693
01:06:14,227 --> 01:06:17,264
Move on before
your youth goes away!

694
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:21,017
Move on,
our life is so short!

695
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:27,825
Move on and fear nothing, the
night is followed by the dawn...

696
01:06:28,587 --> 01:06:33,945
and the world is just a sphere
rolling day and night.

697
01:06:35,667 --> 01:06:38,306
Be sad about nothing...

698
01:06:38,987 --> 01:06:41,660
Have no fears...

699
01:06:42,627 --> 01:06:47,747
Move on and have no worries,
it's just a rolling sphere.

700
01:06:49,267 --> 01:06:52,498
- Move on!
- Not thinking about the future!

701
01:06:53,027 --> 01:06:56,337
- Move on!
- And do whatever you like!

702
01:06:56,827 --> 01:07:00,103
- Move on!
- Before your youth goes away.

703
01:07:00,587 --> 01:07:03,784
- Move on!
- Life is so short!

704
01:07:04,347 --> 01:07:10,058
Move on and have no fears,
our life keeps changing.

705
01:07:11,187 --> 01:07:16,466
And you never know
what's going to happen next!

706
01:07:18,707 --> 01:07:24,259
Drink, sing and laugh,
do all kinds of crazy things.

707
01:07:25,507 --> 01:07:30,979
Move on and have no fears,
move on and keep smiling.

708
01:07:32,387 --> 01:07:35,697
- Move on!
- Not worrying about the future!

709
01:07:36,187 --> 01:07:39,304
- Move on!
- And do whatever you like.

710
01:07:39,707 --> 01:07:43,017
- Move on!
- Before your youth goes away!

711
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:47,062
- Move on!
- Our life is so short.

712
01:08:02,267 --> 01:08:05,577
- Goodnight, gentlemen.
- What about you, Commander?

713
01:08:06,067 --> 01:08:09,457
Since l can't read, l'll go
for a walk around the ship.

714
01:08:10,107 --> 01:08:12,098
Have a good night.

715
01:08:41,107 --> 01:08:44,702
A boat was all alone
on a blue sea...

716
01:08:45,267 --> 01:08:48,862
and there was also a sea- gull
with white feathers.

717
01:08:49,507 --> 01:08:52,943
And it kept flying around her
to tease her...

718
01:08:53,347 --> 01:08:56,976
making its wings wet
in the blue water.

719
01:08:57,627 --> 01:09:01,097
l felt jealous of the small
white boat...

720
01:09:01,507 --> 01:09:05,182
because the sea-gull
was speaking to her sail!

721
01:09:05,587 --> 01:09:09,216
And l feel like a little boat
in the blue sea...

722
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:13,455
always waiting
for the sea-gull to appear.

723
01:09:21,867 --> 01:09:25,496
A red geranium blossomed
in the pot...

724
01:09:25,987 --> 01:09:29,059
and a butterfly came
flying like crazy...

725
01:09:30,107 --> 01:09:34,066
and who knows what the
little tease said to it...

726
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:38,266
forcing it to become
even more red!

727
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:42,382
l keep thinking about
its wide wings...

728
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:46,940
but l can't figure out
what they said to each other.

729
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:50,577
Whoever knows it
should also tell me...

730
01:09:51,107 --> 01:09:55,180
l wish l could hear it from
you even though l blushed too.

731
01:10:03,427 --> 01:10:07,625
Last night's moon made the
poplar's leaves look silver...

732
01:10:08,067 --> 01:10:11,662
as it stood still
in the middle of nowhere.

733
01:10:12,067 --> 01:10:15,423
At the first sea-breeze
it rustled...

734
01:10:15,867 --> 01:10:19,496
and its silver leaves
quivered.

735
01:10:20,187 --> 01:10:24,066
l keep thinking
and thinking that something...

736
01:10:24,507 --> 01:10:28,341
must have been said by the
sea- breeze through its branches.

737
01:10:28,747 --> 01:10:32,376
lf only l could hear from you
the sea- breeze's words...

738
01:10:32,747 --> 01:10:36,456
even if my heart would quiver
like the leaves.

739
01:10:47,747 --> 01:10:50,341
- What are you doing here?
- Just talking, sir.

740
01:10:50,627 --> 01:10:52,663
Get out of here! Go!

741
01:11:01,707 --> 01:11:03,299
Bravo!

742
01:11:24,027 --> 01:11:27,463
What is going on, gentlemen?
l heard voices and songs...

743
01:11:27,987 --> 01:11:29,978
- Permission to speak, sir.
- Go on.

744
01:11:30,267 --> 01:11:33,145
Degleris has his birthday
and because of the occasion...

745
01:11:33,467 --> 01:11:36,140
not being bed time yet,
we were singing quietly.

746
01:11:36,587 --> 01:11:40,136
Do you call this "quietly"?
But this is not what's about.

747
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:42,378
l also heard a woman's voice.

748
01:11:43,027 --> 01:11:45,780
l pretended for the laughs.

749
01:11:46,187 --> 01:11:49,304
- Do it again then.
- Right away, sir. Listen...

750
01:12:01,187 --> 01:12:04,224
- So you can sing like a woman.
- Yes, sir.

751
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:06,703
- And you speak with two voices.
- No, sir.

752
01:12:07,027 --> 01:12:09,541
l got carried away and l spoke
in a woman's voice...

753
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:12,375
while Apostolou
spoke in a man's voice.

754
01:12:12,987 --> 01:12:16,536
We'll talk about it tomorrow,
gentlemen and... ladies.

755
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,544
Hurry up. First of all,
take out the cover carefully.

756
01:12:49,627 --> 01:12:50,901
Hey!

757
01:12:51,587 --> 01:12:53,066
Hey...

758
01:12:54,587 --> 01:12:56,896
Hey, you! Hurry up!

759
01:12:57,387 --> 01:12:59,378
Cha-cha-cha!

760
01:12:59,907 --> 01:13:02,660
What is going on here? Did you
find those inside the boat?

761
01:13:05,107 --> 01:13:07,496
- lt looked good on me.
- Get out of here, silly!

762
01:13:09,267 --> 01:13:13,101
These were found in the boat?
And you heard a woman's voice?

763
01:13:13,507 --> 01:13:15,020
l did, sir.

764
01:13:15,387 --> 01:13:18,777
Would you recognize the men
talking in front of the boat?

765
01:13:19,067 --> 01:13:20,216
Sure...

766
01:13:20,867 --> 01:13:22,937
Costas, don't sit around.
We are arriving at Volos.

767
01:13:23,187 --> 01:13:25,621
Go and take the young lady's
dress very discreetly.

768
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:28,945
- Shall l disembark in these?
- Yes, with the help of God.

769
01:13:29,227 --> 01:13:32,219
We are sure on the Commander's
side. We'll see about the others.

770
01:13:32,547 --> 01:13:36,222
- l'll change at Volos?
- And you'll give us the uniform.

771
01:13:36,547 --> 01:13:39,744
Poor Nakos will be able
to get out of bed at last.

772
01:14:14,027 --> 01:14:17,224
- Shall we surprise him?
- No. Let's follow him.

773
01:14:50,507 --> 01:14:53,897
The dress is not there.
l looked everywhere.

774
01:15:38,347 --> 01:15:39,985
All clear.

775
01:15:40,547 --> 01:15:43,220
- What happened to the dress?
- lt's a mystery.

776
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:45,697
- Did you search thoroughly?
- Of course l did.

777
01:15:46,027 --> 01:15:49,258
Guys! Let's face this matter
realistically.

778
01:15:49,507 --> 01:15:52,385
l don't know about the dress,
but miss Alice will go ashore...

779
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,259
even without a dress.

780
01:15:54,587 --> 01:15:57,659
What do you mean? l'll get off
at Volos and strip?

781
01:15:58,027 --> 01:16:01,258
- You'll get off in the uniform.
- And go home like a cadet?

782
01:16:01,627 --> 01:16:03,857
We'll purchase a dress
at Volos.

783
01:16:04,187 --> 01:16:08,021
Yes, but what about the other
dress? This is inexplicable.

784
01:16:08,387 --> 01:16:12,346
lnexplicable! This dress
and this hat, gentlemen...

785
01:16:12,747 --> 01:16:15,819
l would bet that they belong
to my daughter! That's right!

786
01:16:16,307 --> 01:16:18,502
l have no doubt
particularly for the hat...

787
01:16:18,747 --> 01:16:20,942
because l bought it for her
myself in ltaly.

788
01:16:21,307 --> 01:16:25,095
One could say there are many
like it, but what a coincidence!

789
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:28,464
And it's not only the hat!
lt's the dress, the shoes!

790
01:16:30,427 --> 01:16:33,385
- Who was looking in the boat?
- Degleris.

791
01:16:35,907 --> 01:16:37,977
- A fourth- year cadet.
- Yes, l know.

792
01:16:38,267 --> 01:16:42,624
Please, be very careful
now that we'll get to Volos.

793
01:16:42,907 --> 01:16:45,899
Do a thorough control, but
without anyone realizing it.

794
01:16:46,187 --> 01:16:48,178
And have somebody
watching Degleris.

795
01:16:48,467 --> 01:16:50,139
He's already under surveillance.

796
01:16:50,427 --> 01:16:51,906
And 57 down.

797
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:56,218
Choose something thin, so that
l can wear it under these.

798
01:16:56,587 --> 01:16:58,737
lt's better like this.
Let's take the dress first...

799
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:02,662
Right. How could l go shopping
dressed like a cadet?

800
01:17:02,987 --> 01:17:06,582
Aren't we going dressed like
cadets? What's the difference?

801
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:08,505
lt's not the same.

802
01:17:08,827 --> 01:17:11,102
- The disembarkation's begun.
- Are the leaves in order?

803
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:14,385
Let's go, guys. And you do
as we said. Be careful.

804
01:17:14,787 --> 01:17:16,140
Bye.

805
01:17:34,787 --> 01:17:37,938
- How long shall we remain here?
- A couple of hours.

806
01:17:38,227 --> 01:17:40,821
- l'll have time to go ashore.
- Propably not.

807
01:17:41,107 --> 01:17:43,860
You'll have to disembark
among the other sailors.

808
01:17:44,267 --> 01:17:46,781
l see. lt's all right.
l'll disembark at Salonika.

809
01:17:49,147 --> 01:17:52,503
We want to do a joke,
to play a game, you know.

810
01:17:52,867 --> 01:17:55,062
We are playful guys.

811
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:42,103
- What are you doing here?
- Just hanging around, sir.

812
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:53,785
What's your name, son?

813
01:18:54,107 --> 01:18:57,144
l am the fourth-year cadet
Dimitrios Beliris.

814
01:18:59,827 --> 01:19:01,624
Right...

815
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:14,344
What's your name?

816
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,864
l am the fourth-year cadet
Panagiotis Dimitriou.

817
01:19:20,347 --> 01:19:22,144
Right...

818
01:19:34,787 --> 01:19:36,140
What's your name?

819
01:19:36,427 --> 01:19:39,385
l am the fourth-year cadet
Nicolaos Apostolou.

820
01:19:39,867 --> 01:19:41,425
Right...

821
01:19:41,987 --> 01:19:44,182
You back there, what's your name?

822
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,857
l am the fourth-year cadet
loannis Nakos.

823
01:19:51,867 --> 01:19:53,346
Right...

824
01:20:37,267 --> 01:20:39,861
Don't go in there.
The Commander is inside.

825
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,141
Let's take these things
out of sight.

826
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:12,104
Too many dresses, guys.
Too many dresses.

827
01:21:12,747 --> 01:21:15,898
This is a destroyer,
not a school for girls.

828
01:21:29,947 --> 01:21:33,417
So the one is my daughter.
There are documents now.

829
01:21:34,027 --> 01:21:36,746
- Her identification.
- What about the other one?

830
01:21:37,307 --> 01:21:40,299
Two dresses, two girls.
lt's quite clear.

831
01:21:42,467 --> 01:21:44,139
Come in!

832
01:21:49,067 --> 01:21:52,104
There is a message for you,
Commander.

833
01:21:52,467 --> 01:21:54,185
Thank you.

834
01:21:57,387 --> 01:22:00,060
Please, read it for me,
mr. Papadakis.

835
01:22:00,427 --> 01:22:03,419
"Alice disappeared yesterday
when came to bring suitcase. "

836
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:06,386
"l am going crazy.
Send instructions what to do. "

837
01:22:06,707 --> 01:22:10,302
Here is the confirmation.
You can go now. Thank you.

838
01:22:13,427 --> 01:22:16,658
Aren't you going to send her
a message to put her at ease?

839
01:22:17,587 --> 01:22:21,182
We are arriving at Salonica
in 15 minutes. l'll call her.

840
01:22:50,347 --> 01:22:53,942
- Could it be your husband?
- Since it's from Salonika!

841
01:22:57,107 --> 01:22:58,904
Yes?

842
01:22:59,907 --> 01:23:01,704
Yes!

843
01:23:02,947 --> 01:23:05,017
Hello? Hi!

844
01:23:06,587 --> 01:23:08,657
Yes, l got it.

845
01:23:10,467 --> 01:23:13,618
l said l'd got it.
Don't worry though.

846
01:23:14,307 --> 01:23:16,867
Our pride and joy is here.

847
01:23:17,627 --> 01:23:21,142
She is here, l tell you.
Alice is here.

848
01:23:21,787 --> 01:23:24,938
No, she is parading
right now.

849
01:23:26,507 --> 01:23:30,864
Parading, l tell you!
As what? As a cadet!

850
01:23:31,427 --> 01:23:34,499
Slope arms! March forward!

851
01:23:38,307 --> 01:23:42,346
All the officers are staring
at me. l think they know.

852
01:23:42,627 --> 01:23:45,346
- Pretend that you don't see!
- Oh oh!

853
01:23:56,427 --> 01:23:58,258
- Keep your gun up, miss!
- Pardon?

854
01:23:58,627 --> 01:24:00,583
March without talking!

855
01:24:06,507 --> 01:24:09,067
Haven't they brought the new
glasses l sent for yet?

856
01:24:09,387 --> 01:24:10,661
Not yet.

857
01:24:11,227 --> 01:24:12,296
Come in!

858
01:24:12,627 --> 01:24:16,142
Sir, with all due respect,
the young lady...

859
01:24:17,107 --> 01:24:20,463
- Did she get away?
- She's outside. With the others.

860
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:23,699
Let them come in!
All four of them!

861
01:24:46,947 --> 01:24:49,222
- You naughty girl!
- Not a girl, sir!

862
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:52,664
Naughty boy, perhaps.
Not a naughty girl though!

863
01:24:53,867 --> 01:24:56,176
- Alice!
- Here l am, daddy.

864
01:25:01,747 --> 01:25:03,624
Your glasses, sir.

865
01:25:05,107 --> 01:25:08,656
Give them to me, because
it's time we told...

866
01:25:09,507 --> 01:25:12,340
the males from the females.

867
01:25:23,347 --> 01:25:26,896
May l, sir? l am responsible
for everything that's happened.

868
01:25:28,467 --> 01:25:30,856
And what are you, child?
Male or female?

869
01:25:31,267 --> 01:25:32,985
l am a man, sir.

870
01:25:33,307 --> 01:25:35,867
Shut up!
What about the other girl?

871
01:25:36,147 --> 01:25:38,980
- There isn't any other girl.
- Why the two dresses then?

872
01:25:39,307 --> 01:25:42,458
l bought the second one in Volos
because the first disappeared.

873
01:25:42,747 --> 01:25:44,897
l'm telling you, sir,
l am the only responsible here.

874
01:25:45,107 --> 01:25:47,063
Don't listen to him, daddy.
lt's all my fault.

875
01:25:47,347 --> 01:25:50,464
You didn't invite me aboard
the ship, did you?

876
01:25:50,787 --> 01:25:52,857
- He's talking rubbish.
- lt's my fault, sir.

877
01:25:53,147 --> 01:25:55,866
l made a serious mistake.
l have no place in here.

878
01:25:56,227 --> 01:25:59,902
You do! Your place is hanging
from the highest mast!

879
01:26:00,147 --> 01:26:02,456
l'm going to hang both of you!

880
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:04,943
- He did what he said.
- What?

881
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:07,502
He hanged them for life.

882
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,826
