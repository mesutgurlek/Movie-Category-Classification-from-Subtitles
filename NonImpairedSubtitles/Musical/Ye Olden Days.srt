00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,873
<i>In days of old
when knights were bold</i>

2
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,349
<i>And nightshirts
held their sway</i>

3
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:37,582
<i>A jolly minstrel
strummed his uke</i>

6
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:49,655
<i> I journey from afar</i>

7
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:52,828
<i> My worldly goods
