1
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:15,712
Cheetah Love. Scene 1 A.
Take one. Mark it!

2
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:22,641
Cheetah love, Cheetah love
Cheetah love, Cheetah love

3
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:29,364
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah, Cheetah

4
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:36,575
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah, Cheetah

5
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:39,853
This girl is a friend for life

6
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:42,897
I'm gonna be there
when you need me, that's right

7
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:46,425
Yeah, this girl's never gonna change

8
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,260
No matter where I go,
I'll still be the same

9
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,351
And this girl wants to have some fun

10
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:56,911
So put your hands up
'cause we've only begun

11
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:00,155
And there's no stopping us because

12
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:03,671
We got that Cheetah love

13
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:07,000
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls
We stick together for life

14
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:10,516
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye,
but we roll side by side

15
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:14,085
Yeah, there's nothing in the world
that we can't overcome

16
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,445
Strength in numbers,
got each other, got that Cheetah love

17
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:21,612
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah, Cheetah

18
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:25,413
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah love

19
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:28,533
I know there's a place to turn

20
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:32,338
When I really need you to,
you put me first

21
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:35,344
And my girls have always got my back

22
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:39,145
No matter what happens,
I can count on that

23
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,263
And when I wanna escape it all

24
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:45,670
My sisters are always
gonna be my first call

25
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:51,988
'Cause there's no stopping us
because we got that Cheetah love

26
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,834
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls
We stick together for life

27
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:59,356
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye,
but we roll side by side

28
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,879
There is nothing in the world
that we can't overcome

29
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,560
Strength in numbers,
got each other, got that Cheetah love

30
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:10,724
I'll never be someone who hurts you

31
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:14,168
I'll never be someone who deserts you

32
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:17,737
We have a bond no one is breaking

33
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:21,742
And if they try, we will still survive

34
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:26,216
- Cheetah love
- Cheetah love

35
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:29,626
- Cheetah love
- Cheetah love

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,029
- Cheetah love
- Cheetah love

37
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,224
- Cheetah love
- Cheetah love

38
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,393
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls
We stick together for life

39
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:38,666
Together for life

40
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:41,438
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye,
but we roll side by side

41
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:44,918
There is nothing in the world
that we can't overcome

42
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:48,355
Strength in numbers,
got each other, got that Cheetah love

43
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:51,763
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls
We stick together for life

44
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:55,405
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye,
but we roll side by side

45
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,889
There is nothing in the world
that we can't overcome

46
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:03,249
Strength in numbers,
got each other, got that Cheetah love

47
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:05,494
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah, Cheetah

48
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,052
Side by side

49
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:09,012
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah love

50
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:10,461
Cheetah, Cheetah

51
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:12,496
- Love
- Cheetah love

52
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,298
- Love
- Cheetah love

53
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:15,985
- Love
- Cheetah love

54
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:17,508
Love, love

55
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,905
Love, Cheetah, love

56
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,985
- Chanel, snap out of it.
- The song is over.

57
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,306
- But they loved us.
- Who?

58
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:28,710
The fans?

59
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:30,667
That's it?

60
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,154
It's kind of rough.

61
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,431
Well, we're still working out the kinks.

62
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,442
- Yeah, we used to be a foursome.
- Yes.

63
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:38,634
Then Galleria got into Cambridge...

64
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,245
Which, you know,
is great and amazing...

65
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,119
Especially considering
her study habits.

66
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:44,081
But that's why she's in summer school.

67
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,683
- But trust us, we totally got this down.
- Yeah, whatever.

68
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,607
Look, you get your act together,
you give me a call.

69
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:54,536
Then we can talk about representation.

70
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:55,853
Thanks.

71
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,861
Now what?

72
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:01,939
It just seems so hopeless.

73
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:06,586
- What happened to your laptop?
- Nothing.

74
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:09,342
You are not messing
with your computer

75
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,826
so you can flirt
with that tech support guy?

76
00:04:12,313 --> 00:04:13,268
No.

77
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,223
Maybe.

78
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:18,594
He has a name.

79
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,108
Kevin, extension 347.

80
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,316
Wow.

81
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:23,874
What is your dad going to say
when he finds out

82
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,755
you've been wasting
precious study time

83
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:27,236
flirting with the nerd patrol?

84
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:31,645
Okay. We cannot all have a gorgeous,
devoted Spanish boyfriend.

85
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,928
Well, actually,

86
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:39,605
no one has a gorgeous,
devoted Spanish boyfriend.

87
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,292
- What?
- Joaquin broke up with you?

88
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:45,091
- I'm so sorry, Do.
- I'm okay.

89
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,891
What happened?

90
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:50,811
Time differences, phone bills.
I'm here, he's there.

91
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:55,016
Things changed.
It just got to be too hard.

92
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:58,507
Yo, I'm so sorry.
I know you really liked him.

93
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,101
I'm cool. And I'm hungry.
Anybody else?

94
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:04,791
- Starving as usual.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:06,268
Let's get out of here.

96
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:08,115
You pick whatever spot you want,
Do, all right?

97
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:09,910
Anything but Spanish.

98
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:34,134
I see you've met Ganesh.

99
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:35,893
The statue?

100
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,656
He's known as the remover
of obstacles.

101
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:41,422
Well, that's perfect.
We've got nothing but obstacles.

102
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:43,376
- Such as?
- No work.

103
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:45,941
- No agent.
- No singing career.

104
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,822
Sometimes all you need is a little faith.

105
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,551
Okay, this is depressing.

106
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:57,031
We've been on, like, a million auditions
and what have we booked?

107
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:58,590
That would be nothing.

108
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:00,832
I can't deal with the stress of failure.

109
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,838
I'm already behind
in my reading for Columbia.

110
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,839
We still have two months until college.

111
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:05,952
Yeah, but when it does start,

112
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,598
we're not going to have time
to rehearse.

113
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:10,286
Maybe it is time for things to change.

114
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,923
I really should be taking
that college prep class.

115
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:16,566
Yeah, and I've got that dance camp
lined up for the summer.

116
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:19,811
Are you guys seriously ready
to give up the Cheetah dream?

117
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:23,054
- No. I don't want it to end.
- Me, either.

118
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:25,647
Well, it's now or never,
so let's make it now.

119
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:28,454
Look, I promise from now on,
I will stay so focused,

120
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,334
nothing will get in our way.

121
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,700
Exactly.

122
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:38,098
Hello?

123
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,986
Okay.

124
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:44,225
Are you kidding?
Of course we're interested.

125
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:45,834
What? Who is it?

126
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:48,630
You want us to audition for a movie?
Where?

127
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:51,431
Somebody wants
the Cheetah Girls to audition for,

128
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,199
like, a huge Hollywood musical.

129
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:56,121
Hello? Definitely, we will be there.

130
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,079
Okay, what's the movie about?

131
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:02,324
Yeah, I don't remember,

132
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,442
because I kind of lost my focus
after the whole "Hollywood" part.

133
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,890
- We have to get this.
- We will.

134
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:10,654
I haven't been this nervous in so long.

135
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:13,134
Our luck is changing. I can feel it.

136
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:16,099
Well, what are we waiting for?
Cheetahs, it's on!

137
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:27,347
No one can hold us back
when we're set to go

138
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:28,458
Go!

139
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,469
No one can tell us that we're not
ready when we're ready to flow

140
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:32,582
Flow!

141
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:35,991
Lead by example
Here's a sample on the floor

142
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:38,233
Yeah, try a little harder
Move a little faster

143
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,155
If you can't find the strength
you're after

144
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:44,400
Dig a little deeper, dig a little deeper

145
00:07:44,522 --> 00:07:47,517
Just like we had to do it
Just like we had to do it

146
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:52,404
You got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

147
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:59,407
We're celebrating
like we never did before

148
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:00,524
Before!

149
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:03,455
Went through the fire,
took it higher, check the score

150
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,573
Score!

151
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:07,261
If you wanna be a leader,
check your ego at the door

152
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:08,336
Right there

153
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:12,299
Yeah, be a trendsetter, be a go-getter
if you want to do everything better

154
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:16,306
Dig a little deeper, dig a little deeper

155
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:19,661
Just like we had to do it
Just like we had to do it

156
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,310
You got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

157
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:28,309
Don't ask the question
what it is you should do

158
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:29,393
Don't ask

159
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:32,399
Just take some action, it'll come to you

160
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:33,510
It will

161
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:37,033
It's all connected
All you have to do

162
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:41,126
Is move, baby, move, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

163
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:44,287
You're on a roll, let it go, lose control

164
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,406
Don't you know it's the best thing
you can do?

165
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,247
Yeah!

166
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:01,052
Go!

167
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:04,417
- Dig a little deeper
- Here we go

168
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:08,508
Dig a little deeper, dig a little deeper

169
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:11,703
Just like we had to do it
Just like we had to do it

170
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:12,868
Like we had to

171
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:16,624
You got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

172
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,795
Just like we had to do it
Just like we had to do it

173
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:24,712
You got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

174
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:27,758
Just like we had to do

175
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:32,041
You've got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

176
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:33,204
Yeah

177
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:41,695
Just give us a moment, please.

178
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:42,129
Just give us a moment, please.

179
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:45,014
Okay. All right.
How do you think we did?

180
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:47,257
- We nailed it.
- I so want to go to California.

181
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:50,101
- We are going to California.
- Here he comes.

182
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:54,538
Hi, and thank you for coming.
I'm the director. Well, I'm Vik.

183
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:59,945
But actually my parents say,
"Hello, Vikram." But I prefer Vik.

184
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:06,349
So anyway, I'm Vik, the director.

185
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:08,665
You were very, very good.

186
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:10,915
- Amazing, really.
- Thank you.

187
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,750
We have a plane to catch.

188
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,918
Right. So, here's the deal.

189
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:17,001
I would like you, all of you,
to star in my movie.

190
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,243
My first Bollywood movie.
If that's okay with you.

191
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,288
We're going to be in a movie

192
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:23,558
Yes! Yes! Yes!

193
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,679
Thank you, thank you.

194
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,449
You have no idea
what this means to us.

195
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:27,722
No, thank you.

196
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:30,574
If it wasn't for you, I'd be packing
my bags for dental school.

197
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:34,088
Nothing, it's...
Well, just my parents, they...

198
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:37,410
Never mind.
So you're cool with the schedule, right?

199
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,180
Your flight leaves
the day after tomorrow.

200
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:41,453
Things move fast in Bollywood.

201
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,496
The Cheetahs are going...

202
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:46,338
- What did he just say?
- Bollywood.

203
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,902
That's what I thought you said.

204
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,748
India? Bollywood?

205
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,863
The movie-making capital of the world?

206
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:55,793
India?
Like the other side of the world, India?

207
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:57,191
- Chanel.
- Bollywood. Hollywood.

208
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:59,274
My cell phone connection
was bad, okay?

209
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:00,514
Stupid teléfono.

210
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,950
I'm positive I said that we'd be
shooting in Mumbai.

211
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,515
Okay. Well, like, in my defence,

212
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:06,952
I didn't exactly know
where Mumbai was.

213
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,281
It's the biggest city in India.

214
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:12,401
You'll love it.
I mean, I hope that you'll love it.

215
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,848
No, I'm sorry.

216
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:18,490
Why are we sorry? We're not sorry.

217
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:20,252
Is there a problem?
There can't be a problem.

218
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,333
Yeah, I don't have time for a problem.

219
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:24,210
Yeah. There is.

220
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:27,174
I'm sorry. There's not a problem.
Could you just give us a minute?

221
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,290
Sure.

222
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:32,464
Come on. This is a chance of a lifetime.

223
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:35,784
Hello? Once again, India,
other side of the world!

224
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:37,024
Yeah, I thought we were going to try

225
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,948
to make it big
on this side of the world first.

226
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,868
And I have a college prep this summer.

227
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,346
And I'm teaching dance camp.

228
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:44,827
Dance camp and college prep?

229
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,513
This is an opportunity for
the Cheetah Girls

230
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:49,391
to become international movie stars.

231
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:51,475
How can you pass this up?

232
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:55,633
You're serious?
You really think we should do this?

233
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:58,074
I am more sure about this
than I've been about anything.

234
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,403
This is our Cheetah destiny.

235
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,683
It is the movie-making
capital of the world.

236
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:09,052
I guess I can get some
studying done on the plane.

237
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:12,772
And I could probably teach
the second session of dance camp.

238
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,048
Yo, and come on.
That director's mad cute.

239
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:16,771
I know.

240
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,339
Wait. No. No talk about boys.

241
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:23,343
- Cute or not cute.
- All right, cool. No talk about boys.

242
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:25,058
Anything else?

243
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:26,859
Yeah, just one thing.

244
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,428
We're going to India!

245
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:33,708
One girl, Vik.

246
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:36,110
You're supposed to bring back one girl.

247
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,228
What's your uncle going to say
when you show up with three?

248
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,586
Once my uncle meets them,

249
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,793
he'll see that they should
all be in the movie.

250
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,435
Don't you maybe just
want to talk to your uncle

251
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:45,837
before you make this decision?

252
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:48,479
Look, okay,
the Cheetah Girls are my stars.

253
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:52,397
I'll just rewrite the script for
three beautiful leading ladies.

254
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:54,729
Why do I have to tell my uncle?

255
00:12:55,611 --> 00:12:58,811
Because he's the producer.
He's paying for the movie.

256
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,891
Right. There's always that.

257
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:17,462
It's going to be so good to get out
of New York for the summer.

258
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,943
I know, the heat.

259
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,027
And all that crazy traffic.

260
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,954
Watch out! Watch out!

261
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:37,154
- Okay, slow down!
- Oh, my God!

262
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,087
Okay, so it's crowded and hot.

263
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:48,044
Yeah, but we're in India.

264
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:50,291
And it's Cheetah-licious!

265
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:34,641
Loving Mumbai. This hotel is beautiful.

266
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,965
Room service.

267
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:38,209
And jewellery for sale
right by the front door.

268
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:46,327
Wow.

269
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,177
Yes.

270
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,452
Cheetah...

271
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,099
Are you sure you got it?

272
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,500
Okay. Right this way.

273
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:55,776
Please don't drop
the bag on the bottom.

274
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,627
It's muy importante.

275
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,188
Well, at least she packed light.

276
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,593
- Here you go. Have a good day.
- Thank you.

277
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,315
You're welcome.

278
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,004
Miss?

279
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,406
- Come here. Come.
- Thank you, sir.

280
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,093
- My mom will love this.
- You're welcome.

281
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:35,012
- Take this string and tie it in the tree.
- Don't get me wrong.

282
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,418
I mean, it's colourful, but I think
there's enough strings in this tree.

283
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,531
It's for a wish.

284
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:41,619
You make a wish, tie the string,

285
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:43,657
and when it comes true, you return,

286
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:46,381
untie the string, and say thank you.

287
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:49,702
- To the tree?
- Who else?

288
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:53,384
Come on, Cheetahs,
we could use the luck.

289
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:56,154
Everybody grab a string.
Come on, let's make a wish.

290
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:57,676
Thank you.

291
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,624
Who would ever think
that a girl from New York

292
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:40,426
would be in this beautiful hotel room
next to the Indian Ocean?

293
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:41,872
Arabian Sea.

294
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:46,348
Pardon me for ever
cracking open a guidebook.

295
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:56,997
Hey, should I call Kevin 347 now?

296
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,639
'Cause it's night back home.

297
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:01,966
Or should I wait until tonight,
which is yesterday?

298
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,206
Honestly, why are you
even wasting your time?

299
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,049
Phone relationships are doomed.

300
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:07,731
You used to think it was romantic.

301
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:10,130
Yeah, well, learn from my mistakes.

302
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:12,532
Ready for your close-ups,
amigas Cheetahs?

303
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,137
Vik just sent over
the rehearsal schedule,

304
00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:16,295
and if we don't hurry up,
we're going to be late.

305
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,333
- Ch-chop.
- All right.

306
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,942
Hey, Chanel?

307
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:24,661
- Thanks.
- For what?

308
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,339
You know,
for believing in the Cheetahs.

309
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:30,190
Yeah, if it wasn't for you,
we'd never be here.

310
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:31,426
You were fierce.

311
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,872
You guys know
there's nothing I wouldn't do

312
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,552
to keep the Cheetahs together.

313
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:36,074
Including kick their butts and tell them,

314
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:38,348
"We have got to go."
We've got to get ready.

315
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:40,231
- Bollywood, here we come.
- Yeah.

316
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:50,000
- Look at that.
- Check that out.

317
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:55,126
Let them know
the Cheetah Girls have arrived.

318
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:58,171
I can't believe this is really happening.

319
00:17:58,294 --> 00:17:59,283
- Really.
- This is amazing.

320
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:00,734
Better than amazing.

321
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,376
The Taj Mahal.

322
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:18,308
Built in 1643, it's one of
the Seven Wonders of the World.

323
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,711
And one of the most
romantic places in all of India.

324
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:27,756
They say if you kiss
someone there at sunset,

325
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:30,791
you'll know in your heart
if your love is true.

326
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,159
Well, you can count me out.

327
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,802
- What?
- Glad you made it.

328
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:38,995
Me, too.

329
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:42,003
Shall we?

330
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:49,008
So I really wanted to do
a more traditional remake

331
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:50,887
of the classic hit Namaste Bombay.

332
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:52,928
But, Uncle, the producer,

333
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:54,810
well, it was his idea
to make it more marketable.

334
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:58,617
Cast Americans, make it more modern,
more contemporary.

335
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:00,574
Well, what's the script about anyway?

336
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:02,696
Well, there's still a couple of
adjustments that we have to make.

337
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:05,705
But basically... It's a love story.

338
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:07,822
I love romance.

339
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:10,226
I can't wait to tell
Kevin about our movie.

340
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:12,821
Hello? Does anyone
remember the deal? No boys.

341
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,069
My bad.

342
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,712
Anyway, it's classic Bollywood cinema.

343
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:22,559
It's all about singing, dancing,
romance and intrigue.

344
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:26,601
- That's Rahim. He's your co-star.
- He's our co-star?

345
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:28,720
He's a big star,

346
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:30,246
like Bollywood royalty.

347
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:32,041
And Uncle gave him his first movie.

348
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:34,085
Here he comes now.

349
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:52,574
Please, can I have your autograph?

350
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:54,537
- Please, please, please?
- Sign mine, please.

351
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,257
- Gorgeous.
- Thank you, thank you.

352
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,460
- Who should I make this out to?
- My mom.

353
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,990
No, wait, wait, me!

354
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:03,548
No, no, no, no, my mom, my mom!
Sorry.

355
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:06,505
My mom loved your parents
in Namaste Bombay.

356
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:09,516
And they actually fell in love
with each other while filming.

357
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:12,474
Wow, that is so romantic.

358
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:15,356
- Yes, it is very romantic. Thank you.
- Thank you!

359
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:16,759
Next, please.

360
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:19,846
Who should I make this out to?

361
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,923
- That is so embarrassing.
- Girl, he's just a guy.

362
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:30,253
Rahim. Meet your co-leads.
Chanel. Dorinda. Aqua.

363
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,930
Nice to meet you. I hear you're great.
I'm looking forward to working with you.

364
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:40,493
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get busy writing.

365
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:42,263
Well, rewriting.

366
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:45,744
Come on, ladies. They're ready for you.

367
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,145
Bye.

368
00:20:58,838 --> 00:21:01,514
I don't understand. These Americans
are supposed to be on time.

369
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:05,079
Hey, ladies. I can't spend
half my day chasing after...

370
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,637
Hi, Rahim.

371
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:11,001
That's Gita. She's our choreographer.

372
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,200
- She's our choreographer?
- Yeah.

373
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,128
Whoa.

374
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:20,764
- Hi, Rahim.
- Gita, let me help you.

375
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:22,774
- I didn't know you were...
- You're fine, yeah? You okay?

376
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:24,855
- Okay.
- I'm okay. He was supposed to be...

377
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,412
Careful!

378
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:36,462
Rahim. Rahim. We have to go.
He's got his costume fitting.

379
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:39,582
- It's okay.
- It's okay. Okay, bye.

380
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,860
- Bye.
- Excuse us, ladies.

381
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:42,346
- Bye.
- Later.

382
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:46,514
- I think he just snorted.
- Yeah, twice.

383
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,390
Yeah, kind of over him.

384
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,718
Okay, ladies. Come on in.

385
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,521
Okay, listen up.

386
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:59,604
I've managed to track down our stars.
This is...

387
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:00,876
- Aqua.
- Dorinda.

388
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:02,488
- What's up? Chanel.
- Hi.

389
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:04,566
And these are your dancers.

390
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,803
Vik says you're amazing dancers,

391
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:10,687
so you shouldn't have
a problem picking it up.

392
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:12,455
- You ready?
- Yeah.

393
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:16,095
So it's one, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four, one, two, three.

394
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,813
One, two. Pop.

395
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:20,894
One, two, three, four.

396
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:24,265
Bollywood 101.

397
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:27,863
Well, what if you haven't had,
like, Bollywood one?

398
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:30,505
- Is it all going to be like this?
- All right!

399
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:32,430
Five, six, seven, eight.

400
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:35,069
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four. One, two, three...

401
00:22:35,195 --> 00:22:37,028
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

402
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:42,360
Sorry. It's just, you know,
we've really never done this before.

403
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:45,043
Yeah. I can see that.

404
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,837
Are you saying we can't dance?

405
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,000
It's okay.

406
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:51,599
It's my job to make sure you look
like you can, even if you can't.

407
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:54,198
All right, people. I think we have to
break it down even more.

408
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:56,041
A lot more.

409
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,686
That's it. You got to stop!

410
00:22:57,813 --> 00:23:00,613
Chica, look, she's the choreographer.
It's her vision.

411
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:03,252
- Whatever. Just chill.
- We'll get it. It's new. Come on.

412
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:04,778
All right. Whatever.

413
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:07,938
But nobody tells me I can't dance.
Let's see your moves.

414
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:10,256
Come on, bring it, bring it.

415
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:13,264
- Yeah, let's see what you've got.
- Come on, girl.

416
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:26,748
Are you sure that you're up for this?

417
00:23:26,877 --> 00:23:28,436
Do you think you can handle it?

418
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,238
It's complicated
You might get frustrated

419
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:35,433
We got the moves that you never seen

420
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:37,283
Let me show you just what I mean

421
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:41,402
There's really no chance
that you can do our dance

422
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,486
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

423
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,522
Try to keep up, try to keep up, yeah

424
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:47,883
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

425
00:23:48,014 --> 00:23:49,733
Oh, no

426
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,848
Oh, no, show me what you got

427
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:54,094
Try to follow, watch me now

428
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:57,372
If you think that you know how,
then dance me

429
00:23:58,182 --> 00:24:00,299
Dance me if you can

430
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:02,575
Get it together or fall apart

431
00:24:02,705 --> 00:24:05,585
If you think it's not that hard,
then dance me

432
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:09,149
Dance me if you can

433
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:12,789
Dance me if you can

434
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:16,225
Dance me
Dance me if you can

435
00:24:17,077 --> 00:24:19,069
I know you think that you're in control

436
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:21,795
But watch and learn
'cause this is how we roll

437
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:25,438
Work it just like this
Let's see you try and do that

438
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:27,203
What's the matter?
Can't you figure it out?

439
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:29,601
'Cause you look confused,
mixed up, no doubt

440
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:33,803
There's really no chance
that you can do our dance

441
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,887
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

442
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:37,924
Try to keep up, try to keep up, yeah

443
00:24:38,054 --> 00:24:40,330
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

444
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:43,295
- Come on, come on
- Yeah, yeah

445
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:44,373
Show me what you got

446
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:46,537
Try to follow, watch me now

447
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:49,415
If you think that you know how,
then dance me

448
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:50,538
Dance me

449
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:51,620
Dance me if you can

450
00:24:51,745 --> 00:24:52,700
Oh, yeah

451
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,943
Get it together or fall apart

452
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:57,742
If you think it's not that hard,
then dance me

453
00:24:57,869 --> 00:24:58,825
Dance me

454
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,179
Dance me if you can

455
00:25:00,311 --> 00:25:01,746
Yeah!

456
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:04,468
Is that the best that you can do?

457
00:25:06,115 --> 00:25:09,554
You're gonna have to try much harder

458
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:13,832
Now's the time to make your move,
you know

459
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:17,560
Hey, hey, get ready!
Hey, hey, let's go!

460
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,718
Yeah!

461
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:31,088
That's right

462
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,625
Here we go

463
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:47,908
What?

464
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,984
Yeah, yeah!

465
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:53,709
Try to follow, watch me now

466
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:56,351
If you think that you know how,
then dance me

467
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:57,512
Dance me

468
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,755
- Dance me if you can
- Dance me if you can

469
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:02,031
Get it together or fall apart

470
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:04,677
If you think it's not that hard,
then dance me

471
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:05,792
Dance me

472
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:08,121
- Dance me if you can
- Dance me if you can

473
00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:10,363
- Everybody wants to win
- Wants to win

474
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:13,641
If you think you can handle it,
then dance me

475
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,648
Dance me if you can

476
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:18,732
- Make it look easy, that's the way
- That's the way

477
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:21,894
If you think you got what it takes,
then dance me

478
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:25,737
- Dance me if you can
- Dance me if you can

479
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:29,091
Yeah!

480
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:35,300
- That was great!
- Awesome.

481
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,384
Hello, ji.

482
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:42,386
Myself, Kamal Bhatia.
Who might you be?

483
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,354
We're the stars of the movie.
We're the Cheetah Girls.

484
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:49,151
Stars? Vikram Kumar Bhatia!

485
00:26:52,481 --> 00:26:53,915
Why you hiding?

486
00:26:55,403 --> 00:26:56,633
I see you.

487
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:02,198
Yes, Uncle-ji.

488
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:06,085
One star.
Your script is saying one star.

489
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:10,254
Your budget is saying one star.
So I am saying, one star.

490
00:27:11,217 --> 00:27:13,493
- What?
- But there are three of us.

491
00:27:14,138 --> 00:27:15,697
Well, I just made a couple of changes.

492
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:18,177
But budget has
not made couple of changes.

493
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:20,498
Listen, Uncle, these girls are fantastic.

494
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:23,060
If you would just take
a moment to watch them perform,

495
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:24,666
I'm sure that you'll see that they have...

496
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:27,508
- Good idea.
- But I really think that they have...

497
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:28,665
What? Excuse me?

498
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,672
Each Cheetah performs.
I will choose best one.

499
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:35,868
What? Like, audition?

500
00:27:36,717 --> 00:27:39,027
- Against each other?
- Correct.

501
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:43,235
I will choose one star,
others go home. Goodbye.

502
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:47,557
Otherwise,
two ladies are having Indian holiday

503
00:27:47,685 --> 00:27:49,643
and Kamal Bhatia is paying.

504
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,887
- No, no, no, no. No, no.
- Okay. Uncle, please.

505
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,608
But I'm the director.
I spent days rewriting the script.

506
00:27:57,533 --> 00:27:59,172
- Do you want to make movie?
- Yes.

507
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:00,694
Or shall I telephone your parents

508
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:03,810
and tell them you would
prefer to be dentist?

509
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:06,611
Good point. I'll start rewriting.

510
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:09,019
- Again.
- Good idea.

511
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:11,744
Goodbye.

512
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:21,828
What is going on?

513
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:24,229
You can't book one of us
and not the other.

514
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:28,397
Okay, we're a group.
You cast the Cheetahs. Plural.

515
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,029
I know this must be a little bit
shocking right now.

516
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:33,118
That's an understatement.

517
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:35,757
Whatever. No deal.
Cheetahs, we're out.

518
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:38,875
What were we thinking?

519
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:42,798
- I gave up a college prep class.
- I gave up teaching dance camp.

520
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:49,206
Maybe the Cheetahs are over.

521
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:57,374
All right

522
00:28:58,062 --> 00:28:59,177
Hey

523
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:11,503
Oh, yeah

524
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,704
We're standing on the edge
of something

525
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:19,276
Do we stay or do we run?
It's obvious everything's changed

526
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:24,515
My head can't seem to figure out
why my heart is full of doubt

527
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:27,956
Maybe we're just tired of the game

528
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:32,287
Guess you never know
what's going to happen

529
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,608
So you do the best you can

530
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,933
Following your soul
might bring you back

531
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:44,893
Or it may have another plan

532
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:50,418
Please don't let it fly away, high away

533
00:29:50,903 --> 00:29:54,582
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow

534
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:58,942
Don't fly away, high away

535
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:04,148
Please don't
Don't let it fly away

536
00:30:04,314 --> 00:30:08,596
We've never felt this place before
Wondering if any more

537
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:12,031
We can find in us what it takes

538
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:17,521
It's not about who's to blame
I pray that they're just growing pains

539
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:20,798
Laughing while they're testing our faith

540
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:24,890
'Cause you never know
what's going to happen

541
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:29,454
So you do the best you can

542
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:33,617
Following our souls
might bring us back

543
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:38,293
Unless it has another plan, yeah, yeah

544
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:42,977
Please don't let it fly away, high away

545
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:47,224
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow

546
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:51,665
Don't fly away, high away

547
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:57,076
Please don't
Don't let it fly away

548
00:30:57,317 --> 00:31:00,516
It's yes, it's no
We stay, we go

549
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:01,630
We go

550
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:05,438
Feels like we're questioning
everything, yeah

551
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:10,444
- We run, we fall, but through it all
- Through it all

552
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,605
We never thought we would break

553
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,404
We never thought we would break

554
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:16,886
Please

555
00:31:17,734 --> 00:31:22,367
Please don't let it fly away, high away

556
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:27,094
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow

557
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:31,258
- Fly away
- High away

558
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:34,105
- Please don't
- Please don't

559
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,380
Don't let it fly away

560
00:31:47,517 --> 00:31:48,633
Thank you.

561
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:56,356
So, what do you think?

562
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:58,758
Cute earrings.

563
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,357
No, about the whole auditioning thing.

564
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:04,050
I don't know. What do you think?

565
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,286
I think it stinks.

566
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:07,928
What? This colour is perfect on you.

567
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:09,488
Aqua, the audition.

568
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:11,608
Yeah, it does.

569
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:16,178
I mean, they can't really expect us to
audition against each other, can they?

570
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:23,425
Look, I'm really sorry for
getting us into this mess.

571
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:26,579
And, Do, you should take the part.

572
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:28,826
Come on, you actually
turned down a job for this,

573
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,387
and you really need the money.

574
00:32:31,513 --> 00:32:33,709
No, Aqua should do it.

575
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:37,386
This is an awesome opportunity,
and you're an amazing actress.

576
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:40,113
No. Vik clearly wants Chanel.

577
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,310
What?

578
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:44,161
"What?" He barely even looks
at us when you're around.

579
00:32:44,283 --> 00:32:46,355
That is so not true.
And even if that were true,

580
00:32:46,485 --> 00:32:49,399
I would never use that to get
an unfair advantage over my girls.

581
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:53,481
Look, seriously, we could all do this.

582
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,650
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.
How could we pass this up?

583
00:32:58,094 --> 00:33:00,325
Okay. I think we should audition.

584
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:03,496
- Fair and square, Cheetah-style.
- Yes.

585
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:07,741
That's weird, there's no caller ID.
Hello?

586
00:33:08,782 --> 00:33:12,300
Aqua? This is Kevin from
Totally Tech Support.

587
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:13,654
Kevin 347.

588
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:18,068
You guys, it's Kevin 347.
He's never called me before.

589
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,829
What? What are you doing, girl?
Talk to him.

590
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:21,022
Hi. Hello?

591
00:33:21,153 --> 00:33:22,553
I hope it's okay that I'm calling.

592
00:33:22,674 --> 00:33:25,587
I was just following up
on your computer problem.

593
00:33:25,715 --> 00:33:28,630
You were right.
I just needed to defrag the disc,

594
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,238
and replace the corrupted registry file

595
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,559
and reload the 802.11 B driver,
and it was fine.

596
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:35,560
Now I'm officially impressed.

597
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:38,075
I knew you really didn't need my help.

598
00:33:38,206 --> 00:33:40,767
Is that the only reason why you called?

599
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:43,764
Not entirely. Are you busy?

600
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:47,569
- No. I'm not doing anything.
- Me, neither.

601
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:51,815
I mean, other than looking at the most
beautiful sunset I've ever seen.

602
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:53,936
It is beautiful.

603
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:58,260
Wait a minute.
You're watching the sunset, too?

604
00:33:58,382 --> 00:33:59,338
That means...

605
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:03,664
We're in the same time zone!
There's this beautiful temple.

606
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:05,015
With white carved elephants?

607
00:34:05,147 --> 00:34:06,343
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.

608
00:34:06,469 --> 00:34:07,664
Describe exactly where you are.

609
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,702
Okay. I'm on a gorgeous path...

610
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:11,664
Along the Arabian Sea...

611
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:13,625
And there are people out,
and they're holding hands.

612
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:16,476
And there's an ice cream stand,
and it's called...

613
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,587
Naturals?

614
00:34:17,718 --> 00:34:19,071
That's right!

615
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,646
You didn't tell me
you were coming to India.

616
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,962
You didn't tell me you lived in India.

617
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:33,848
Wait, you don't sound like
you live in India.

618
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:37,043
See, I watch a lot
of American television.

619
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:39,894
Aqua?

620
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:41,530
Kevin 347?

621
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,573
Amar.

622
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:47,413
Actually, I'm only Kevin at work.
No, really.

623
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:49,182
This is him!

624
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:51,661
Yo, I think we should
give our girl some privacy.

625
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:54,859
No, I know how these long-distance
things end. I'm going to talk to her.

626
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:55,944
What? Are you crazy?

627
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:59,984
This is so romantic.
We are in India, anything can happen.

628
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:02,308
Fine.

629
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:12,873
Have you noticed that
every elephant looks at me?

630
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:16,117
Are you serious? It's an elephant!

631
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:17,439
No, I'm not kidding.

632
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:19,319
It's like they're wanting
to tell me something.

633
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:21,679
Okay, now.
The elephant is wanting to tell you

634
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:24,530
that it's okay for your friends to flirt
and have some fun.

635
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:27,008
It doesn't mean they're
going to abandon you.

636
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:30,093
Good. Because this is our
last summer together.

637
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:32,971
I'm really nervous things are going
to change when we go to college.

638
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:37,174
Nothing is going to change.
We'll always be there for each other.

639
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:39,415
- Okay.
- Hold up, this is Vik.

640
00:35:39,543 --> 00:35:40,498
I'm going to tell him about the audition.

641
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:43,584
- But your...
- Hello? Hey, how are you?

642
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:52,793
Having doubts?

643
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,106
What, me? No.

644
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:58,877
Maybe.

645
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:03,120
Sometimes what we wish for
is not what we really need.

646
00:36:04,443 --> 00:36:09,077
Don't miss where you are now
because you're anxious for the future.

647
00:36:09,287 --> 00:36:10,515
Understand?

648
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:13,289
But what if I'm afraid
of where I'm going?

649
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:15,645
Look at this tree.

650
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:20,087
The branches grow out to the sky,
but the trunk remains the same.

651
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:22,976
Life brings changes,

652
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:26,897
but the things that really matter
always stay with us.

653
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:31,293
Yeah, well, I'm not really
a big fan of change.

654
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:34,867
Change will take place
whether you like it or not.

655
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:36,578
Yeah.

656
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,825
I can see
you have been through a lot in life.

657
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:48,108
So you know, when things are bad,
they don't stay that way.

658
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:52,637
Here.

659
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,078
Ganesh?

660
00:36:56,045 --> 00:36:59,517
He was supposed to remove obstacles.
Now we have more.

661
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:02,240
Do you have anything else
that will help me?

662
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,922
Oh, yes. I have just the thing.
Close your eyes.

663
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:12,215
What was that for?

664
00:37:12,778 --> 00:37:13,927
Clarity.

665
00:37:15,741 --> 00:37:16,890
Clarity?

666
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:27,298
- Too spicy?
- Are you kidding?

667
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,789
This is like breakfast in Texas.
What's it called again?

668
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:33,587
Chaat. Papri Chaat, actually.

669
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:38,036
I like it. It's like Indian nachos.

670
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:40,755
It's crunchy, with a little bit of kick.

671
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:43,992
I love a girl that can handle her chillies.

672
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:46,559
See, I bet you cannot find
this in New York.

673
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:49,076
Well, maybe you could
bring me some?

674
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:53,760
You know,
Columbia has one of the best

675
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,566
Physics departments
in the whole world.

676
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:59,732
My father would never agree to that.
It's all planned.

677
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:02,497
I start at the Indian School of Business
in the fall.

678
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:06,738
Can't you just tell him you want
to keep your options open?

679
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:08,982
The only time I talk to my father

680
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:11,539
is when I'm listening to him
telling me what to do.

681
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,340
Sometimes I get frustrated
that I don't have as many options,

682
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:17,746
but I think I'd be terrified
if I had as many as you do.

683
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,945
The one thing my dad always told me
was to go after my dreams.

684
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:24,109
So what's one of your dreams?

685
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:27,669
To star in Vik's movie.

686
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:29,869
So go for it. What's stopping you?

687
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,359
It's a little bit more
complicated than that.

688
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:36,114
I mean, there's only one role
and three Cheetahs want it.

689
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,764
One, two, three, four...

690
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:49,168
One and two.

691
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:52,371
Three, four.

692
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:56,732
All right, guys. We'll just take a break.

693
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:58,215
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

694
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:00,974
Bye!

695
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:06,784
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

696
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,785
Cool.

697
00:39:09,711 --> 00:39:11,590
You got to be kidding me.

698
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:13,628
What?

699
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:14,949
You can't even rehearse.

700
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:17,717
Any time you're around her,
you act like a big dork.

701
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:19,955
I do not act like a dork.

702
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,070
Okay.

703
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:23,874
Really? A dork?

704
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:26,244
Well, a little.

705
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,958
No, that's a lie. A lot.

706
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:29,805
You act like a huge dork around her.

707
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:32,398
I know! It's just that I get so...

708
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,283
So nervous around her.

709
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:37,530
Why? You're the big movie star.

710
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:41,206
Because I've never felt this way before.

711
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,454
Yeah, well,
that's the oldest line in the book.

712
00:39:43,578 --> 00:39:46,049
- I've heard it before.
- I mean it.

713
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:48,571
I've never even kissed a girl. Ever.

714
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:50,613
Seriously?

715
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,900
No, but I've seen you kiss.
In your movies.

716
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:57,943
Yes. On camera, but never for real.
Not off camera.

717
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:01,468
That's actually kind of romantic.

718
00:40:01,753 --> 00:40:02,823
It is?

719
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,587
Dorinda, would you help me?

720
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:07,146
What?

721
00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:10,032
Help me not act like such a dork
around Gita.

722
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:13,960
You really like her, huh?

723
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:20,084
No, sorry. Crushes lead to boyfriends,
and boyfriends lead to heartache.

724
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,326
- You're on your own, buddy.
- Hey.

725
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,366
If you help me with Gita,
I promise to help you with the audition.

726
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:30,088
I don't know.

727
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:32,217
I've seen you dance.

728
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:35,251
I can help you show the world
what you can do.

729
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:41,983
- You're rewriting it again?
- It was either rewrite the script or

730
00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:47,263
"Vik Bhatia, dental school,"
as Uncle likes to say.

731
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,224
Well, I guess if that's what it takes
to get your movie made.

732
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:53,710
I know what you're thinking,
but this is my one shot.

733
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,668
And, yes,
if I have to make some compromises,

734
00:40:55,797 --> 00:40:58,187
at least I get a shot at my dream.

735
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,556
What if this was your
only shot to be a star?

736
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:04,800
Don't you think you'd give it
everything you've got?

737
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:08,202
I mean, how could you
spend the rest of your life

738
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,881
wondering if you really
could've made it?

739
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,683
Well, I have to get back to writing.

740
00:41:18,814 --> 00:41:19,804
- All right.
- See you later.

741
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,006
Yeah.

742
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:36,497
Maybe this was meant to be

743
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,748
Maybe now it should be me

744
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:43,945
Been dreaming of this forever

745
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:48,390
But I'm feeling so confused, yeah

746
00:41:48,558 --> 00:41:51,473
It's hard to see what's right
between you and I

747
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:53,878
And I don't know what to do

748
00:41:54,003 --> 00:41:59,843
Oh, we'd stay together always
is the promise we made

749
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:02,643
But suddenly it's not so clear

750
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,410
And I'm being pulled both ways

751
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:08,332
And it's breaking my heart
Tearing me apart

752
00:42:08,454 --> 00:42:11,449
It's impossible to choose

753
00:42:11,577 --> 00:42:14,218
What if I don't try?

754
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,696
What if I do?

755
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:19,496
Everything that I've dreamed
is right in front of me

756
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:22,663
If I win, what would I lose?

757
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:25,826
How could I learn to live

758
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:29,864
Wondering what if?

759
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:39,957
Things would never be the same
Oh, no

760
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:43,598
Maybe that's the price of fame

761
00:42:43,722 --> 00:42:45,681
Been waiting for this forever

762
00:42:45,805 --> 00:42:49,846
It's close enough for me to touch

763
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,042
But if I don't go for it
I might always regret

764
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,733
But is it worth us breaking up?

765
00:42:55,853 --> 00:43:00,851
Oh, we'd stay together always
is the promise we made

766
00:43:01,857 --> 00:43:04,498
But suddenly it's not so clear

767
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:07,216
And I don't know what to say

768
00:43:07,342 --> 00:43:10,176
And it's breaking my heart
Tearing me apart

769
00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:13,218
It's impossible to choose

770
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:16,068
What if I don't try?

771
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:18,545
What if I do?

772
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,392
Everything that I've dreamed
is right in front of me

773
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:24,507
If I win, what would I lose?

774
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:29,315
How could I learn to live, wondering

775
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,641
What if I would've tried?
I can shine, even fly

776
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:37,442
I don't wanna realise
after it's too late, no

777
00:43:38,286 --> 00:43:41,122
And see it all pass me by

778
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:43,924
If I do, if I don't
Will I ever really know

779
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:48,047
What the future could hold
before it slips away?

780
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:53,731
Could be the chance of a lifetime

781
00:44:03,586 --> 00:44:06,387
And it's breaking my heart
Tearing me apart

782
00:44:06,509 --> 00:44:09,583
It's impossible to choose

783
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:12,353
What if I don't try?

784
00:44:12,474 --> 00:44:14,784
What if I do?

785
00:44:14,915 --> 00:44:17,591
Everything that I dreamed
is right in front of me

786
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:20,713
If I win, what would I lose?

787
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:25,361
How could I learn to live, wondering

788
00:44:25,485 --> 00:44:29,082
What if?

789
00:44:29,207 --> 00:44:30,483
Chanel!

790
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:34,081
I never wanna say

791
00:44:34,211 --> 00:44:36,932
"What if?"

792
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:45,296
So, are you guys okay
auditioning against each other?

793
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:48,859
Yeah. I mean, we're best friends,
and we completely trust each other.

794
00:44:48,983 --> 00:44:52,695
And no one's going to betray that
just to get a part in a movie.

795
00:44:52,866 --> 00:44:55,301
Wow, that's refreshing.

796
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:58,149
Obviously, you've never worked
in Bollywood.

797
00:45:00,313 --> 00:45:03,705
- Do you want to be a star?
- Maybe, once.

798
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:05,748
But I don't think I could ever be a star.

799
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:10,031
I just love performing.
Acting, singing, dancing.

800
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:12,835
I've always loved to dance.

801
00:45:12,962 --> 00:45:16,560
- You have to try this on.
- I could never pull that off.

802
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:18,278
Just something plain for me.

803
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:21,162
He's here.

804
00:45:26,813 --> 00:45:29,488
Gita, is that
what you were worried about?

805
00:45:31,457 --> 00:45:36,376
- It's okay. I know you like him.
- Yeah, so what?

806
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:40,657
He would never want to go out with me.
Like I said, I'm not a movie star.

807
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:42,663
That doesn't matter.

808
00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:45,349
And besides,
when you're on that dance floor,

809
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:47,665
it's pretty clear that you are a star.

810
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,307
You don't need a guy to tell you that.

811
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,807
Are you sure he invited me?

812
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:18,006
Of course. It's not like it's a date
or something.

813
00:46:21,097 --> 00:46:24,978
Do I look okay? 'Cause, like,
I could totally go home and change.

814
00:46:26,501 --> 00:46:27,776
Yeah.

815
00:46:29,903 --> 00:46:32,261
- So glad you could make it.
- Hey.

816
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:33,826
Wouldn't miss it.

817
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:36,908
Hey, listen, I'm really sorry
about the whole mess with my uncle.

818
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,343
- Look, I totally understand.
- You do?

819
00:46:40,473 --> 00:46:41,701
Yeah. Well, I know you'll figure it out,

820
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,951
and you'll make the movie
you want to make.

821
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:45,226
Come on.

822
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,794
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

823
00:46:52,522 --> 00:46:55,483
In this one. By myself.

824
00:46:58,847 --> 00:47:01,409
Feels like love

825
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:03,965
Feels like love

826
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:07,245
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

827
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:10,173
You got me spinning now

828
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:12,607
I feel your happiness all around

829
00:47:12,738 --> 00:47:15,778
I'm not sure what I'm getting into

830
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:18,052
Feels like love

831
00:47:18,222 --> 00:47:20,785
We're not the same, everybody knows

832
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:23,340
That's the best thing about us, though

833
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,267
So hard to believe it, but it's true

834
00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:28,301
Feels like love

835
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,663
We see the world in different ways

836
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:34,071
But I'm loving every minute
of every day

837
00:47:34,195 --> 00:47:37,474
Against the odds, we'll make it through

838
00:47:37,598 --> 00:47:42,232
Maybe this could be
more than just fun

839
00:47:42,802 --> 00:47:47,596
This could be everything that I want

840
00:47:47,726 --> 00:47:50,289
What's happening to me?

841
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,288
Could you be the one?

842
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:58,408
This could be everything that I want

843
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:01,978
I didn't know how good it could be

844
00:48:02,098 --> 00:48:06,379
And it feels like love to me

845
00:48:06,942 --> 00:48:09,457
Feels like love

846
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:12,100
Feels like love

847
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:14,661
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

848
00:48:15,107 --> 00:48:18,068
I didn't know I could feel this way

849
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,105
It's a new world, maybe that's okay

850
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:23,829
You're like a part of me I never knew

851
00:48:23,995 --> 00:48:26,352
Feels like love

852
00:48:26,477 --> 00:48:28,947
You're the one I need next to me

853
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:31,470
But I know that it's hard to be

854
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:34,322
Living for everybody else but you

855
00:48:34,443 --> 00:48:36,197
Feels like love

856
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:39,276
Real love's not supposed to be

857
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:41,878
Afraid of what everybody thinks

858
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,642
So let's show them all
what we can do

859
00:48:45,773 --> 00:48:49,654
Maybe this could be
more than just fun

860
00:48:49,775 --> 00:48:50,892
More than just fun

861
00:48:51,017 --> 00:48:54,409
This could be everything that I want

862
00:48:54,899 --> 00:48:56,016
Everything that I want

863
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,372
What's happening to me?

864
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:01,338
- Could you be the one?
- Could you be the one?

865
00:49:01,465 --> 00:49:05,906
This could be everything that I want

866
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,311
I didn't know how good it could be

867
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:13,984
It feels like love to me

868
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:21,513
I've got to say it now

869
00:49:21,641 --> 00:49:23,599
Seems too hard to do this

870
00:49:23,723 --> 00:49:26,558
We're gonna work it out

871
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:29,202
Nothing about us makes sense

872
00:49:29,327 --> 00:49:33,289
I'd build a bridge from where I am
to where you are

873
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:38,604
It shouldn't have to be this hard

874
00:49:40,737 --> 00:49:45,132
Maybe this could be
more than just fun

875
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:49,811
This could be everything that I want

876
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:50,980
Everything that I want

877
00:49:51,105 --> 00:49:53,462
What's happening to me?

878
00:49:53,587 --> 00:49:56,501
- Could you be the one?
- The one I love

879
00:49:56,629 --> 00:50:00,592
This could be everything that I want

880
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,472
Oh, yeah

881
00:50:02,594 --> 00:50:05,191
- I didn't know how good it could be
- No, no

882
00:50:05,317 --> 00:50:08,116
And it feels like love to me

883
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:10,036
Like love to me

884
00:50:10,161 --> 00:50:12,676
Feels like love

885
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:15,842
Feels like love

886
00:50:15,965 --> 00:50:19,437
It feels like love to me

887
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:23,118
- Feels like love
- Like love

888
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,445
Feels like love

889
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:26,370
Feels like love

890
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:30,649
It feels like love to me

891
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:50,505
So, what do you think?
Isn't it fantastic?

892
00:50:53,995 --> 00:50:55,953
This isn't my wedding set.

893
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:04,362
Where are the flowers?
Where's the set dressing?

894
00:51:17,134 --> 00:51:20,334
Vik, talk to your uncle.

895
00:51:21,257 --> 00:51:24,535
He said this is what we could afford.

896
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:27,574
See this chair? We got it for free.

897
00:51:27,702 --> 00:51:30,424
Your uncle sure hates
to pass up a bargain.

898
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:39,150
Tell me about it.

899
00:51:39,951 --> 00:51:41,706
I just need one minute.

900
00:51:41,834 --> 00:51:48,152
Okay, look, Uncle-ji,
it's just not what I had in mind.

901
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:51,391
- None of it is.
- Viku, beta.

902
00:51:52,002 --> 00:51:57,876
You need to learn some things
about how real world works.

903
00:51:58,246 --> 00:52:01,799
I went to film school, Uncle.
NYU. I won awards.

904
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,691
- I know how to do this.
- Oh, really?

905
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:07,567
You are already over the budget
and under the schedule.

906
00:52:07,694 --> 00:52:10,131
You won awards for that also in NYU?

907
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:12,567
Look, I just need some more time.

908
00:52:12,698 --> 00:52:15,659
Time is one thing you don't have.
Another thing is money.

909
00:52:15,781 --> 00:52:19,253
So if you don't start
shooting next week,

910
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:22,981
I'm pulling plug
on American Girl in India.

911
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:26,659
Actually, you re-titled it
Kamal Bhatia's Namaste Bombay.

912
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:31,150
Correct. And if you don't fix it,
I'm going to re-title it

913
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:35,270
Vik Bhatia's Bye-bye, Bombay,
Hello, Dental School.

914
00:52:35,477 --> 00:52:38,117
Actually, your name has
a nice ring to it.

915
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,837
Kamal Uncle, the palace set is a wreck.

916
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:45,364
I can't have it ready in a week.

917
00:52:45,485 --> 00:52:47,044
- What about a location?
- What about?

918
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:51,003
If it's free, okay.
Otherwise, movie is over. And...

919
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:58,771
You think about how many cavities
you're going to have to drill

920
00:52:58,895 --> 00:53:01,651
to pay back
what you have spent already!

921
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:02,767
Okay.

922
00:53:06,982 --> 00:53:08,097
No set?

923
00:53:09,903 --> 00:53:12,420
I guess this weekend's auditions
are off.

924
00:53:12,546 --> 00:53:13,946
Guess you heard.

925
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:18,143
I can't possibly find a location
in a week, let alone for free.

926
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,143
Uncle is going to shut down the movie
for sure.

927
00:53:21,273 --> 00:53:23,345
Time to book our flights home.

928
00:53:24,395 --> 00:53:27,993
You can't go home yet.
You haven't seen anything of India.

929
00:53:28,118 --> 00:53:30,316
Come home with me for Holi.
It's my favourite holiday.

930
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,717
In fact, you're all invited.

931
00:53:33,683 --> 00:53:36,723
- What's Holi?
- It's the festival of colours.

932
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:40,285
I can't go. I only have a week
to audition, rehearse,

933
00:53:40,409 --> 00:53:41,398
and find a location.

934
00:53:41,529 --> 00:53:46,004
Vik, trust me, Rajasthan is
the best place to find a location.

935
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:47,283
The village that my parents live in

936
00:53:47,414 --> 00:53:50,011
is a hundred times more beautiful
than any movie set.

937
00:53:50,137 --> 00:53:52,413
And I just might have a palace for you.

938
00:53:52,538 --> 00:53:56,250
Yeah, you can audition, rehearse.
I'll take care of everything.

939
00:53:57,262 --> 00:53:59,938
Wow. Thank you?

940
00:54:01,746 --> 00:54:03,783
How exciting! Cheetah road trip.

941
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,868
Viku, what you are doing sitting
talking to ladies?

942
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,221
You have no set and only one week.

943
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:15,190
We're just making a plan
to do some location scouting.

944
00:54:15,317 --> 00:54:17,673
Location scouting? What do you know
about location scouting?

945
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:18,788
I'm coming with you.

946
00:54:25,405 --> 00:54:30,722
- See you later, Swami.
- Girls, don't forget to untie your strings!

947
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:35,202
Looks like our strings
are going to be up there for a long time.

948
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,894
Look, I don't think our wishes
are going to come true.

949
00:54:38,014 --> 00:54:41,567
The tree is still working.
You must give it some time.

950
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:44,008
Well, can you tell that tree
to get a move on it?

951
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:45,574
For real. Like, we're running late.

952
00:54:45,701 --> 00:54:49,252
The point of time is
to help you understand where you are,

953
00:54:49,383 --> 00:54:52,139
not to make you rush
to the next place, understand?

954
00:54:52,266 --> 00:54:53,746
Not really. No.

955
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:57,146
I have just the thing
that will help you see more clearly.

956
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,185
Oh, no, no, no. No, we're good.
But thank you so much.

957
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:02,623
- Okay, well, bye, Swami.
- Bye.

958
00:55:45,189 --> 00:55:46,258
Hello?

959
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:55,433
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Sorry.
No, no, no, 15%.

960
00:55:56,397 --> 00:55:59,152
So why did you want
to be a director, anyway?

961
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:03,680
When I was a kid, my parents used
to take me to see movies,

962
00:56:03,803 --> 00:56:04,794
like, all the time.

963
00:56:04,925 --> 00:56:06,439
And sometimes
you'd go see Uncle films,

964
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:11,165
and it was the most amazing thing
to think that he made all that happen.

965
00:56:11,289 --> 00:56:14,044
He created those great stories.

966
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:17,564
And now when I write a script,
it's like I can see the movie in my head.

967
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:21,532
It's like I've met the characters
and I've been to the places.

968
00:56:22,698 --> 00:56:26,615
I want the whole world to see my films.

969
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:30,741
I get it. It's like when I sing.
I, like, go somewhere else,

970
00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:33,745
- become somebody else.
- Yeah.

971
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:36,430
It's the greatest feeling in the world.

972
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,789
And I just want to share it.

973
00:57:07,134 --> 00:57:10,015
Do you see that?
That elephant is staring right at me.

974
00:57:10,137 --> 00:57:12,447
Don't worry.
My grandmother says it's good luck.

975
00:57:12,578 --> 00:57:15,334
- They're trying to help you.
- Like Ganesh?

976
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:16,736
It's a sign.

977
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:21,380
- You're lucky. They always ignore me.
- Really?

978
00:57:21,506 --> 00:57:23,737
Well, maybe my luck is changing.

979
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:30,788
Or not.

980
00:58:22,714 --> 00:58:24,273
Glad you made it.

981
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:28,470
Did they just get married?

982
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:31,514
No. If this was a wedding,
he'd be riding a horse.

983
00:58:45,973 --> 00:58:50,846
- Is that your palace?
- Don't be ridiculous. It's my parents'.

984
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:53,771
Oh, my. Oh, my.

985
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:03,023
Why didn't you mention any of this?

986
00:59:03,147 --> 00:59:05,902
Were you just playing a joke
on the smart girl

987
00:59:06,029 --> 00:59:08,989
who's too dumb to realise
you're a maharajah?

988
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:13,666
I am no such thing,
technically, until my grandfather dies.

989
00:59:14,757 --> 00:59:16,589
You should have told me.

990
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:21,801
Okay, I'm sorry,
but it doesn't change anything.

991
00:59:22,802 --> 00:59:24,841
If anything,
it makes my life more difficult.

992
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:26,718
It limits my options.

993
00:59:26,846 --> 00:59:28,075
- Really?
- Yeah.

994
00:59:28,207 --> 00:59:32,966
'Cause it seems to me
that you've got lots of options.

995
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:35,526
Not like you.

996
00:59:35,653 --> 00:59:38,613
If the Cheetahs don't work out,
there are a million things you can do.

997
00:59:38,735 --> 00:59:40,853
You can make your own decisions.

998
00:59:41,858 --> 00:59:45,171
- I can never do that.
- Well, have you ever even tried?

999
00:59:46,502 --> 00:59:48,733
That's just not how things work
with my father.

1000
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:53,224
Amar, beta? It's time to eat.
Please tell your friends, beta.

1001
00:59:55,749 --> 00:59:57,388
Ready? Come on.

1002
01:00:00,753 --> 01:00:03,269
Seriously... So good.

1003
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:06,595
I'm sorry my husband is away
on business.

1004
01:00:06,718 --> 01:00:09,074
But we are both so happy
that you are here

1005
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:11,432
celebrating the holiday with our family.

1006
01:00:11,562 --> 01:00:13,474
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1007
01:00:13,603 --> 01:00:15,596
Personally, I had never imagined
the day

1008
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:20,086
that Rahim Khan and Kamal Bhatia
would be seated at our table.

1009
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:24,692
Most honoured. Most honoured.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1010
01:00:24,813 --> 01:00:26,212
And another small thing.

1011
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:29,886
I have prepared
all of Amar's favourite dishes tonight.

1012
01:00:30,017 --> 01:00:32,578
So, Aqua, pay close attention.

1013
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:37,700
- Yeah, Aqua. Take notes.
- She's just being friendly.

1014
01:00:37,822 --> 01:00:40,259
Yeah, right.
I think it's a little more than that.

1015
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:41,421
- Aqua?
- Yes.

1016
01:00:41,546 --> 01:00:43,583
Did you try the chicken tikka masala?

1017
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:46,861
- Yeah. It's actually my favourite.
- Really?

1018
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:51,351
I make it every time Amar comes home.
I'll give you the recipe later, okay?

1019
01:00:51,474 --> 01:00:52,702
Okay.

1020
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:55,226
Don't worry.
She did this to his last girlfriend, too.

1021
01:00:56,398 --> 01:00:57,433
- What?
- Thank you.

1022
01:00:57,558 --> 01:00:58,674
She did.

1023
01:01:01,922 --> 01:01:06,681
- I'm not his girlfriend.
- Not yet, anyway.

1024
01:01:07,326 --> 01:01:08,965
This is seriously incredible.

1025
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:11,684
It's just like the palace
in Namaste Bombay.

1026
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,608
I mean, I wouldn't ask
if this wasn't crucial or anything,

1027
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:16,487
but is there any way
that we could shoot here?

1028
01:01:16,614 --> 01:01:19,334
I don't think my mom
would let Rahim leave, even if he tried.

1029
01:01:19,455 --> 01:01:20,572
I'm sure she'd be thrilled.

1030
01:01:20,697 --> 01:01:23,008
- I hope so.
- One thing.

1031
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:26,418
For the guy that saved my movie?
Anything. You name it.

1032
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,982
Guess who the newest member
of the movie crew is?

1033
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:37,944
What? You're in the movie now?

1034
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:42,823
Well, not really.
But I am the new location owner.

1035
01:01:43,675 --> 01:01:45,793
Well, congratulations.

1036
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:49,229
- There is just one condition.
- What's that?

1037
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:52,115
- That he casts you in the lead.
- What?

1038
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,517
Don't worry about Kamal Uncle.

1039
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:57,559
I think I have a bit more pull
now that I am the new location owner.

1040
01:02:18,823 --> 01:02:21,784
Please tell me you're not doing
what I think you're doing.

1041
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:27,621
- I was just rehearsing.
- The love duet? By yourself?

1042
01:02:28,991 --> 01:02:31,189
How long are you going
to keep running away?

1043
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,909
How long do I have?

1044
01:02:34,035 --> 01:02:37,269
Do you really want to spend the rest
of your life doing half the dance?

1045
01:02:37,398 --> 01:02:39,835
What am I supposed to do?
I act like a total fool in front of her.

1046
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:42,430
It doesn't matter. None of this matters.

1047
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:43,837
Look, if you really care about her,

1048
01:02:43,963 --> 01:02:46,878
you have to be willing
to take the chance.

1049
01:02:47,006 --> 01:02:50,365
No more dancing in archways
or hiding behind fake doors.

1050
01:02:50,489 --> 01:02:51,843
None of that.

1051
01:02:58,415 --> 01:03:01,774
You give pretty good advice.
Ever take it yourself?

1052
01:03:06,502 --> 01:03:08,494
Wait. What is that?

1053
01:03:08,703 --> 01:03:13,178
- See, I told you.
- Wow, you were right. This is amazing.

1054
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,629
I thought they said
they were going to play fair.

1055
01:03:19,753 --> 01:03:22,827
Who, Chanel and Vik?
They're a couple, aren't they?

1056
01:03:25,237 --> 01:03:28,470
- They are?
- Well, everyone kind of thinks they are.

1057
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:32,199
Why wouldn't she tell me?

1058
01:03:34,163 --> 01:03:35,518
Maybe she didn't want you to know

1059
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,083
so that if she gets the part,
you would think it was fair.

1060
01:03:45,373 --> 01:03:48,014
So, think this would be a good place
for the wedding scene?

1061
01:03:48,135 --> 01:03:50,605
Totally. This is incredibly romantic.

1062
01:03:53,459 --> 01:03:55,338
Don't even get any ideas.

1063
01:03:55,461 --> 01:03:58,216
The girls and I already talked about it.
No unfair advantages.

1064
01:03:58,343 --> 01:03:59,332
Okay.

1065
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:02,257
So, is Amar going
to let you shoot here?

1066
01:04:02,386 --> 01:04:05,267
- Yeah. He said I could.
- Hot.

1067
01:04:05,389 --> 01:04:07,780
But only if I cast Aqua as the lead.

1068
01:04:10,273 --> 01:04:12,948
Don't worry.
I told him it wasn't up to me.

1069
01:04:14,035 --> 01:04:16,074
But we promised each other.

1070
01:04:16,838 --> 01:04:19,228
Seems like you're the only one
keeping that promise.

1071
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:20,919
The other Cheetahs,

1072
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:23,318
they're not letting anything stand
in their way.

1073
01:04:24,363 --> 01:04:25,320
Look, I gotta turn in.

1074
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,405
I have to meet Rahim and Dorinda
for dance rehearsal tomorrow morning.

1075
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:30,645
Dorinda? Why is she rehearsing
with Rahim?

1076
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,889
He's helping her get ready
for the audition.

1077
01:04:33,011 --> 01:04:34,810
What?

1078
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:38,405
I keep telling you,
you're the only one who's playing fair.

1079
01:04:41,098 --> 01:04:42,817
Catch you later. Okay?

1080
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,015
So what can I do
to be more comfortable around Gita?

1081
01:04:50,145 --> 01:04:51,704
You gotta tell her how you feel.

1082
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:54,057
But rehearsing with her
would be a start.

1083
01:04:54,187 --> 01:04:55,304
I can't.

1084
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:02,150
They look good together.
We should choose the dancer.

1085
01:05:03,355 --> 01:05:06,316
But, Uncle, you've really got to listen
to Chanel sing.

1086
01:05:06,438 --> 01:05:08,270
I truly believe that she's the one.

1087
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,082
Okay.

1088
01:05:45,069 --> 01:05:48,427
- What is that?
- My string.

1089
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:50,426
From the wishing tree?

1090
01:05:51,154 --> 01:05:53,271
But our wish hasn't even come true yet.

1091
01:05:53,395 --> 01:05:56,629
- Mine did.
- No, the... Wait.

1092
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:59,514
I wished for the Cheetah Girls
to become the biggest movie stars.

1093
01:05:59,641 --> 01:06:01,121
What did you wish for?

1094
01:06:01,242 --> 01:06:02,801
I wished for the Cheetahs
to stay the same,

1095
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:04,276
the way we've always been.

1096
01:06:04,405 --> 01:06:05,758
Thanks for cancelling out my wish.

1097
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:08,117
Sorry, I didn't want our group
to break up.

1098
01:06:08,247 --> 01:06:09,523
Well, that still leaves Aqua.

1099
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:14,369
I wished that I would meet Kevin 347
in person.

1100
01:06:15,053 --> 01:06:16,089
Nice.

1101
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:19,536
Did you also wish for your boyfriend
to buy your way into the movie?

1102
01:06:19,657 --> 01:06:22,731
- What? I would never!
- Yeah. Spare us.

1103
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:24,212
Like you're any better?

1104
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:25,980
I couldn't pry you off of Rahim
with a crowbar.

1105
01:06:26,102 --> 01:06:27,091
Really? Coming from the girl

1106
01:06:27,222 --> 01:06:28,815
who wouldn't bat an eyelash
at our director?

1107
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,060
- I didn't have to.
- Yeah, all right.

1108
01:06:30,185 --> 01:06:31,106
Whatever.

1109
01:06:31,106 --> 01:06:31,379
Whatever.

1110
01:06:31,506 --> 01:06:34,180
Excuse me, ladies. Who is first?

1111
01:06:42,795 --> 01:06:44,069
I'm the one

1112
01:06:45,037 --> 01:06:46,596
Oh, yeah

1113
01:06:54,003 --> 01:06:55,563
Come on

1114
01:06:56,406 --> 01:06:58,967
Nobody can sing like me

1115
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:01,001
I can hit any note you give for me

1116
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:05,251
From A to Z
Yes, I can

1117
01:07:05,373 --> 01:07:07,889
Nobody can dance like me

1118
01:07:08,015 --> 01:07:09,769
I can move to the beat you're playing

1119
01:07:09,897 --> 01:07:13,938
Baby, with my feet
Yeah, yeah

1120
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:17,020
Nobody can act like me

1121
01:07:17,142 --> 01:07:20,900
I can fall to pieces
and make you believe

1122
01:07:21,026 --> 01:07:23,746
In almost anything

1123
01:07:23,867 --> 01:07:25,507
I'm the one

1124
01:07:25,629 --> 01:07:28,304
I'm stepping out
and breaking all the rules

1125
01:07:28,431 --> 01:07:30,151
All alone

1126
01:07:30,273 --> 01:07:32,789
I'm gonna show everybody
what I can do

1127
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:34,714
I'm the one

1128
01:07:34,837 --> 01:07:35,953
Put your bet on me

1129
01:07:36,078 --> 01:07:39,196
Can't you see that I'm the one?

1130
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,677
Don't need anybody now
I'm making it on my own

1131
01:07:41,802 --> 01:07:43,600
Got a voice like an angel

1132
01:07:43,723 --> 01:07:47,959
She can turn every word
into a lovely melody

1133
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,837
Yes, she can

1134
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:52,086
The girl's got her own groove

1135
01:07:52,771 --> 01:07:57,052
Put the music on and watch her
as she does her thing

1136
01:07:57,735 --> 01:07:58,690
She can do everything

1137
01:07:58,815 --> 01:08:01,491
My girl is a drama queen

1138
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:05,941
Any role you give her,
she does perfectly

1139
01:08:07,302 --> 01:08:08,702
Oh, can't you see that

1140
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:10,338
She's the one?

1141
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:13,140
She's stepping out
and breaking all the rules

1142
01:08:13,267 --> 01:08:14,987
All alone

1143
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:17,419
She's gonna show everybody
what she can do

1144
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,589
She's the one

1145
01:08:19,713 --> 01:08:20,863
Put your bet on her

1146
01:08:20,994 --> 01:08:23,907
Can't you see that she's the one?

1147
01:08:24,035 --> 01:08:26,996
She don't need anybody now
She's making it on her own

1148
01:08:27,398 --> 01:08:33,035
I wanna be the one
who everybody notices

1149
01:08:33,163 --> 01:08:35,839
I'm stepping out, stepping out, all right

1150
01:08:36,326 --> 01:08:41,688
I wanna be the one
who's always front and centre

1151
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,121
For the first time in my life

1152
01:08:44,573 --> 01:08:46,292
I'm the one

1153
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:48,929
I'm stepping out
and breaking all the rules

1154
01:08:49,055 --> 01:08:50,695
All alone

1155
01:08:50,818 --> 01:08:53,413
I'm gonna show everybody
what I can do

1156
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:55,293
I'm the one

1157
01:08:55,421 --> 01:08:56,571
Put your bet on me

1158
01:08:56,702 --> 01:08:59,822
Can't you see that I'm the one?

1159
01:08:59,945 --> 01:09:02,541
Don't need anybody now
I'm making it on my own

1160
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:04,100
I'm the one

1161
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:06,824
I'm stepping out
and breaking all the rules

1162
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,543
All alone

1163
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:11,313
I'm gonna show everybody
what I can do

1164
01:09:11,434 --> 01:09:13,232
I'm the one

1165
01:09:13,355 --> 01:09:14,506
Put your bet on me

1166
01:09:14,637 --> 01:09:17,711
Can't you see that I'm the one?

1167
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,435
Don't need anybody now
I'm making it on my own

1168
01:09:20,561 --> 01:09:22,041
I'm the one

1169
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:30,880
Wonderful, wonderful. Wonderful.

1170
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:35,689
Now, I can see why you wanted
to choose all three. Wonderful.

1171
01:09:35,814 --> 01:09:39,446
But we still cannot afford it.

1172
01:09:40,377 --> 01:09:43,769
So role goes to...

1173
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:50,018
- Chanel.
- Yes, girls. Yes.

1174
01:09:50,866 --> 01:09:52,219
Big surprise.

1175
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:56,107
Yeah, congratulations.
Fair and square, right?

1176
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:00,341
Thank you, Uncle-ji.

1177
01:10:09,721 --> 01:10:11,440
Congratulations, Chanel.

1178
01:10:14,605 --> 01:10:15,925
Thanks.

1179
01:10:41,186 --> 01:10:45,546
I could be recognised from a distance

1180
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:50,625
Yeah, I could be the biggest name
on the screen

1181
01:10:51,074 --> 01:10:53,669
Singing and dancing forever

1182
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:55,993
Signing my name for whoever

1183
01:10:56,598 --> 01:11:00,560
Yeah, it's all in my reach, yeah

1184
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:03,436
If I give it all that I've got

1185
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:05,796
I get there to the top

1186
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:08,282
But I don't even wanna go

1187
01:11:08,407 --> 01:11:11,129
If I have to go there alone, so

1188
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:15,048
Set me on top of that mountain

1189
01:11:15,173 --> 01:11:20,297
Let me fly to the end
of the world

1190
01:11:21,018 --> 01:11:24,411
Yeah, I can go anywhere

1191
01:11:24,581 --> 01:11:26,971
But if you're not with me there

1192
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,339
It'll never be enough

1193
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:35,225
There's no place like us

1194
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,742
There's no place like us

1195
01:11:37,911 --> 01:11:42,352
If I find the other side of the rainbow

1196
01:11:43,075 --> 01:11:46,866
Will I find that the gold
ain't worth any price?

1197
01:11:47,799 --> 01:11:50,440
'Cause if we ain't there for each other

1198
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:53,077
Then all I got doesn't matter

1199
01:11:53,363 --> 01:11:57,360
No, it won't be right to

1200
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:00,124
Give it all that I got

1201
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,526
And get there to the top

1202
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,564
If you're not up there with me

1203
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:08,088
There's nothing I wanna see, so

1204
01:12:08,215 --> 01:12:11,813
Set me on top of that mountain

1205
01:12:11,938 --> 01:12:18,178
Let me fly to the end
of the world, yeah

1206
01:12:18,503 --> 01:12:21,304
I can go anywhere

1207
01:12:21,426 --> 01:12:23,657
But if you're not with me there

1208
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:27,303
It'll never be enough

1209
01:12:27,431 --> 01:12:30,824
There's no place like us

1210
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,269
There's no place like us

1211
01:12:35,077 --> 01:12:37,593
It doesn't matter where we are

1212
01:12:37,719 --> 01:12:40,155
Or matter how far

1213
01:12:40,281 --> 01:12:42,513
'Cause even when we go
our separate ways

1214
01:12:42,883 --> 01:12:44,682
We'll be the place

1215
01:12:45,525 --> 01:12:47,836
I believe that I can do it

1216
01:12:47,967 --> 01:12:50,039
But alone, I won't get through it

1217
01:12:50,609 --> 01:12:52,647
We know we gotta stick together

1218
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:55,367
'Cause no matter what

1219
01:12:55,493 --> 01:12:58,967
There's no place like us

1220
01:13:03,939 --> 01:13:05,215
You were great.

1221
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:08,380
I'm sorry about what I said.
I didn't mean any of it.

1222
01:13:08,503 --> 01:13:11,703
Me, too. You sang your heart out.

1223
01:13:11,826 --> 01:13:14,263
Thanks. We were all great.

1224
01:13:14,829 --> 01:13:17,789
Look, it doesn't matter what happens,
where we go or what we do.

1225
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:21,429
Change is inevitable,
but we'll always be Cheetahs.

1226
01:13:22,154 --> 01:13:24,546
Cheetahs, say it like you mean it.

1227
01:13:24,677 --> 01:13:26,270
- Together.
- Now.

1228
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:28,961
- And forever.
- And forever.

1229
01:13:29,081 --> 01:13:30,913
We're going to miss you so much.

1230
01:13:31,042 --> 01:13:32,715
You're not going to miss me that much.

1231
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:34,676
- What?
- Why not?

1232
01:13:34,805 --> 01:13:36,842
I'm not going to take the part.

1233
01:13:36,966 --> 01:13:40,120
Look, it just isn't worth losing you guys
as friends.

1234
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,652
So you're all bowing out?

1235
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:57,135
Look, starring in a movie just isn't
worth destroying our friendship.

1236
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,411
Well, I better start writing.

1237
01:13:59,542 --> 01:14:01,454
I have no idea
how I'm going to write a love story

1238
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:02,573
without a love interest.

1239
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:05,425
I think it's time you stand up
to your uncle,

1240
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:06,662
and make the movie you want to make.

1241
01:14:06,787 --> 01:14:09,588
And if you can't, then maybe this isn't
the movie you should be making.

1242
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:14,713
Yeah, Chanel,
but what if this is my only chance?

1243
01:14:15,194 --> 01:14:18,745
It's not your chance
if it's not the movie you want to make.

1244
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:23,311
Don't give up on your dream.

1245
01:14:28,244 --> 01:14:30,920
If you can't be
my leading lady on screen,

1246
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:37,002
maybe you'd consider
playing the role in real life?

1247
01:14:49,222 --> 01:14:51,612
Too bad we're not at the Taj Mahal.

1248
01:14:53,544 --> 01:14:55,138
- That can be arranged.
- Yeah?

1249
01:14:55,266 --> 01:14:56,541
I think so.

1250
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:10,874
Sorry for the mess.

1251
01:15:10,999 --> 01:15:14,995
I was just trying to take your advice
and make things happen.

1252
01:15:17,564 --> 01:15:22,163
I meant for you to follow your dreams,
not try to buy me mine.

1253
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:26,606
But I think you're cute for trying.

1254
01:15:30,334 --> 01:15:31,734
One question.

1255
01:15:31,855 --> 01:15:35,294
Would applying to Columbia
count as following my dream?

1256
01:15:35,418 --> 01:15:37,490
Because I talked to my parents,

1257
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,581
and they don't think
it's such a bad idea.

1258
01:15:41,783 --> 01:15:42,773
Yes.

1259
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:47,148
- Ready?
- No. I'm scared.

1260
01:15:48,148 --> 01:15:49,708
What if she doesn't like me back?

1261
01:15:50,871 --> 01:15:53,227
Sometimes you just got to
put yourself out there

1262
01:15:53,352 --> 01:15:55,390
and not worry about what happens.

1263
01:15:55,795 --> 01:15:57,593
Come on, you can do it.

1264
01:16:12,047 --> 01:16:13,083
Gita?

1265
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:24,289
Just ignore that.

1266
01:16:25,979 --> 01:16:27,493
You were saying?

1267
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,097
Do you want to have dinner
with these flowers?

1268
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:34,457
I mean, do your flowers
want to have dinner with me?

1269
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:43,466
Yeah, I would love to have dinner
with your flowers.

1270
01:16:45,515 --> 01:16:47,028
- You would?
- Yeah.

1271
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:51,390
And by the way,
I love the way you laugh.

1272
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:59,442
Thank you. I love them.

1273
01:16:59,566 --> 01:17:01,523
- You like the flowers?
- Yeah, I do.

1274
01:17:01,647 --> 01:17:04,722
They're red. They match your dress.
It's beautiful.

1275
01:17:07,812 --> 01:17:12,047
Thanks so much. I love them.
They smell so good.

1276
01:17:12,256 --> 01:17:14,692
- You look so beautiful.
- Thanks, Rahim.

1277
01:17:14,818 --> 01:17:16,491
I picked these flowers out
especially for you.

1278
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:19,694
- I knew you would like them.
- Joaquin?

1279
01:17:19,822 --> 01:17:22,497
I'm sorry I've been avoiding your calls.

1280
01:17:22,624 --> 01:17:26,222
We're in India,
which is kind of a crazy story, but...

1281
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:31,025
Anyway, I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

1282
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:35,067
and I realise that
just because we're not going out,

1283
01:17:35,194 --> 01:17:37,426
doesn't mean we can't be friends.

1284
01:17:38,076 --> 01:17:40,798
And I miss you.

1285
01:17:40,919 --> 01:17:43,914
Call me when you can,
I promise I'll pick up.

1286
01:17:50,487 --> 01:17:53,207
Thanks for helping me realise
I was the obstacle all along.

1287
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,365
Hey, look what I got for Vik.

1288
01:18:00,655 --> 01:18:02,965
It's the original poster
to Namaste Bombay.

1289
01:18:05,178 --> 01:18:07,740
Guys, I feel so bad for him.

1290
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:09,454
Who's going to be the star
of his movie now?

1291
01:18:11,623 --> 01:18:13,182
Cheetahs? Look.

1292
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:24,383
Where is this Raju?
Why he is not here?

1293
01:18:24,514 --> 01:18:26,153
Send him. Goodbye.

1294
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:33,751
Why you are not filling out
application form for dental school?

1295
01:18:34,842 --> 01:18:37,312
We found the perfect lead
for the movie.

1296
01:18:37,444 --> 01:18:41,076
Me, too. Rahim in a wig is wonderful.

1297
01:18:41,887 --> 01:18:44,279
No, Uncle. It's Gita.

1298
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,806
What you talking?

1299
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,771
No one wants to see choreographer
on the screen.

1300
01:18:53,898 --> 01:18:56,652
That's why they are always
behind the scenes.

1301
01:18:56,779 --> 01:18:59,899
She's a star. And I'm going to prove it.

1302
01:19:00,022 --> 01:19:03,141
This is my movie.
And this is my one chance.

1303
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:07,266
- So I have to do what I believe in.
- And?

1304
01:19:11,992 --> 01:19:13,311
And make a great movie.

1305
01:19:17,996 --> 01:19:22,039
Now you're talking like real director.

1306
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,400
Thank you. Thank you so much.
I promise I won't let you down.

1307
01:19:26,843 --> 01:19:28,962
Let's see what you got. Come on!

1308
01:19:29,086 --> 01:19:32,080
- Let's make a movie!
- Let's get you Cheetah-fied!

1309
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,922
Silence, please.
We are going for a take.

1310
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:38,727
Namaste Bombay, BBS, One World.

1311
01:19:39,054 --> 01:19:40,693
- Mark it!
- Playback!

1312
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,414
Hey

1313
01:19:54,866 --> 01:19:56,095
Yeah

1314
01:19:56,227 --> 01:19:58,423
Love always finds a way

1315
01:19:58,548 --> 01:20:00,142
Every single time

1316
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:02,342
Once we learn to trust our hearts

1317
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:03,987
And look inside, it feels right

1318
01:20:04,114 --> 01:20:06,231
Now we see who we are

1319
01:20:06,355 --> 01:20:07,835
In a different light

1320
01:20:07,956 --> 01:20:10,108
We're not so far apart

1321
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:11,877
Anything is possible

1322
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,916
With all the differences,
we're stronger here

1323
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:19,834
Now the truth has been discovered
Oh, yeah

1324
01:20:19,966 --> 01:20:22,687
After all we've been through,
now it's clear

1325
01:20:22,808 --> 01:20:26,440
That all of us, we share

1326
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:28,369
- One world
- One world

1327
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:30,326
- One love
- One love

1328
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:32,492
- One and all
- One and all

1329
01:20:32,616 --> 01:20:34,256
We're a circle together

1330
01:20:34,378 --> 01:20:36,131
- One world
- One world

1331
01:20:36,259 --> 01:20:38,091
- One heart
- One heart

1332
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:40,498
- One song
- One song

1333
01:20:40,623 --> 01:20:41,851
Now and forever

1334
01:20:42,584 --> 01:20:44,338
Everybody celebrate

1335
01:20:44,466 --> 01:20:46,264
Bring on the party, bring on the dance

1336
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:48,424
Time to let the music play

1337
01:20:48,548 --> 01:20:50,142
The party never ends

1338
01:20:50,271 --> 01:20:52,024
Every guy and every girl

1339
01:20:52,152 --> 01:20:53,951
Stand up and shout, say it loud

1340
01:20:54,074 --> 01:20:56,066
Everyone around the world

1341
01:20:56,195 --> 01:20:57,834
- Come on and join in
- Yeah

1342
01:20:57,956 --> 01:20:59,949
We're gathered here today

1343
01:21:00,078 --> 01:21:01,432
- Everything just right
- Yeah

1344
01:21:01,559 --> 01:21:03,871
'Cause when you give from the heart

1345
01:21:04,002 --> 01:21:05,516
The things you do come back to you

1346
01:21:05,643 --> 01:21:07,600
Dare to be strong and brave

1347
01:21:07,724 --> 01:21:09,318
Not afraid to try

1348
01:21:09,446 --> 01:21:11,483
That's when we see who we are

1349
01:21:11,607 --> 01:21:13,405
The best of friends and that's when

1350
01:21:13,528 --> 01:21:17,002
With all the differences,
we're stronger here

1351
01:21:17,412 --> 01:21:20,851
Now the truth has been discovered
Oh, yeah

1352
01:21:21,215 --> 01:21:24,176
After all we've been through,
now it's clear

1353
01:21:24,298 --> 01:21:28,009
We're all right here to share

1354
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,973
- One world
- World

1355
01:21:30,102 --> 01:21:31,901
- One love
- One love

1356
01:21:32,024 --> 01:21:33,823
- One and all
- One and all

1357
01:21:33,946 --> 01:21:35,778

1361
01:21:42,112 --> 01:21:43,752
Now and forever

1362
01:21:43,874 --> 01:21:48,554
Oh, I never knew that love
would find a way

1363
01:21:48,678 --> 01:21:51,956
To bring together both of us

1364
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,234
Now, inside, I know it's true

1365
01:21:55,363 --> 01:21:57,116
'Cause what we have is meant to be

1366
01:21:57,244 --> 01:21:59,123
You let me be the real me

1367
01:21:59,246 --> 01:22:02,957
Together here is where we belong

1368
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,406
Hey!

1369
01:22:06,411 --> 01:22:07,765
Come on, now

01:22:08,292 --> 01:22:09,693

One love

One and all
