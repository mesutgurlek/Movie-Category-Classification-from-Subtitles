1
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:42,710
Dismissed.

2
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:46,115
Boys.

3
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:50,622
Remember this, when Mr. Butterbass
calls you to attention...

4
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:54,659
...I want to see every eyelid snap.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:56,826
Take your posts.

6
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:05,961
- Good morning, young ladies.
- Good morning, Mr. Hammerstein.

7
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:15,008
About face.

8
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:33,763
That is one thing
I will not tolerate in this hotel.

9
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:39,331
Dismissed.

10
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,445
And now, the band.

11
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:48,046
Right over here.

12
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:03,856
Good morning, Popeye.

13
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,659
How dare you speak
when I have not asked you a question.

14
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:11,065
Now then, I have had several complaints
about all of you.

15
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:14,131
That's funny.
No one has complained me.

16
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,331
Silence.

17
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,875
I will dismiss, discharge and disqualify...

18
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:21,013
...any employee
who gets familiar with the guests.

19
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:23,911
But what happens
if the guests get familiar with us?

20
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,981
- Quiet.
- Please.

21
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:31,046
I have been imported from Switzerland
by the management of this hotel...

22
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,124
...to enforce discipline...

23
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:35,488
...and I will.

24
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,958
Where is the boss of this outfit?

25
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:43,694
Where is that loafer, Roger Bond,
and his assistant loafer, Fred Ayres?

26
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,338
Coming right down.

27
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:03,522
Yeah.

28
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,984
- How do you feel, boy?
- Yeah.

29
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:10,425
Well, this is all in one piece.

30
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:13,896
That's more than we'll be if we don't
get to that hotel in 29 seconds.

31
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:15,796
Come on, kid, will you?

32
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,038
Well, why don't he put
a kitchenette and bath in here?

33
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:26,804
- Crazy, I guess.
- Crazy nothing. That guy writes songs.

34
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,675
Well, that's screwy, ain't it?

35
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:33,547
It's so screwy
that he can buy a plane just like this.

36
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:35,715
No touch.

37
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:57,339
In just 10 seconds they go on the air.

38
00:04:57,544 --> 00:05:01,310
If those two loafers aren't here
I'm going to fire them.

39
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,847
One, to make ready...

40
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:05,917
...two, to go...

41
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:13,824
Five, six, pick up sticks.

42
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,189
Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

43
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:25,930
This is Roger Bond and his Yankee Clippers
from the Date Grove of the Hotel Hibiscus...

44
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,971
...at Miami, Florida.

45
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:30,735
We offer for your pleasure
as our first selection...

46
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,777
..."Music Makes Me,"
with a complete vocalization...

47
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,609
...by that charming, bubbling,
effervescent little lady...

48
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:40,913
...Miss Honey Hale. Contact.

49
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,799
<i>In me you see a sinner</i>
<i>And dancing is my crime</i>

50
00:05:55,969 --> 00:06:00,736
<i>It seems a sin I've got to give in</i>
<i>To syncopated time</i>

51
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:05,674
<i>It makes me lose my dignity</i>
<i>It makes me lose my poise</i>

52
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:10,680
<i>Some folks call it music</i>
<i>My folks call it noise</i>

53
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:14,680
<i>I like music, old and new</i>

54
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:19,120
<i>But music makes me do the things</i>
<i>I never should do</i>

55
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:23,854
<i>Oh, I like music, sweet and blue</i>

56
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,933
<i>But music makes me do the things</i>
<i>I never should do</i>

57
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:31,999
<i>My self-control</i>
<i>was something to brag about</i>

58
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:33,969
<i>Now it's a gag about town</i>

59
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,510
<i>The things I do are never forgiven</i>
<i>And just when I'm living them down</i>

60
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:43,147

61
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:46,649
<i>'Cause music makes me do the things</i>

62
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:50,719

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,653

00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:00,060

00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:02,063

00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,884

74
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:56,587
Hey, Rog.

75
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:59,554
Go easy, will you?
Don't bite the job that feeds you.

76
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:01,091
Just what am I doing?

77
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:05,823
That Swiss bell ringer is on the level
about not fooling with the cash customers.

78
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,501
Hold your hats, boys.
Here we go again.

79
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:19,804
The Latin type.

80
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:25,707
Belinha, my head aches so badly.
I think I will go and eat an aspirin.

81
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:29,616
You will excuse me.
Do not rise.

82
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,721
- Titia, shall I go with you?
- No, stay.

83
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:37,056
But while I am gone
please do not introduce to Belinha...

84
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,290
...too many American customs.

85
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,194
Rog.

86
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:46,895
Hey, Rog.

87
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:49,501
The last time you had that look...

88
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:53,874
...all we had to live on for two weeks
was a can of prepared dog food.

89
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:57,482
His father owns
the sunny side of Wall Street.

90
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,345
And writes the preferred list.

91
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,148
They say if he'd only give up airplanes,
songwriting and leading orchestras...

92
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,348
...that he could name his own figure.

93
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,494
He could name mine any time.

94
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:13,064
You know, if a Brazilian girl
was half as interested in him as you are...

95
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,827
...and had half your freedom...

96
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:18,835
...she'd...
- She'd what?

97
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,139
- She'd get him over here, just for you.
- Oh, yeah?

98
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,800
You mean, she'd try?

99
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,638
Watch me.

100
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,864
Oh, Rog.

101
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:53,437
What is he doing now?

102
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,166
He just fell into the trombone.

103
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:59,969
You'd better have a heart, Belinha.
You'll break up the whole orchestra.

104
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:04,774
Whenever a Brazilian girl starts something,
she must finish it.

105
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:09,588
- Yes, madam?
- A pencil.

106
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:10,882
Yes.

107
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,382
Thank you.

108
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:28,640
Remember the dog food.

109
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:31,675
And it was the kind
they made out of fish.

110
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,277
Mr. Bond?

111
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:38,815
For you, sir.
From the lady, sir. The dark one.

112
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:52,157
After all, look at her.
What have I got to lose?

113
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:53,321
Only 20 jobs.

114
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:56,161
Since when is dancing a familiarity?

115
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:00,370
Perhaps it's a formal resignation.

116
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,409
She's smiling at him.

117
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:24,853
What have these South Americans got
below the equator that we haven't?

118
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:15,480
- Excuse me, sir...
- Tell Senhora De Rezende...

119
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:18,583
...that her niece is dancing
with the orchestra leader.

120
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:21,049
Hurry, please.

121
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:24,550
Oh, waiter, tell De Rezende
that Belinha is dancing with a musician.

122
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:26,589
- Yes, sir.
- Go on. Make it snappy.

123
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,058
Here, boy, tell Rezende
the kid is dancing with the drummer.

124
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,026
Okay, pop.

125
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:38,331
Tell the old sea lion that baby
is hoofing with a piccolo player.

126
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:43,171
- Oh, madam. Oh, madam.
- Yes?

127
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:45,708
Mademoiselle is going in a big way
for a gigolo.

128
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:48,904
Belinha? A gigolo?

129
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:54,581
My niece.

130
00:12:58,157 --> 00:12:59,886
Is it possible?

131
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,462
The flower of the womanhood of the
Alves Lima De Castro Pimenta De Rezende.

132
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,522
Isn't it terrible?

133
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:13,262
Titia.

134
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:15,600
- This is my aunt.
- Oh, how do you do?

135
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:18,642
My niece thanks you for your politeness,
young man.

136
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:22,941
She will not require
any more of your services this afternoon.

137
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:27,419
Is the usual rate higher?

138
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,987
I am not familiar with such matters.

139
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:34,149
No, no. It's quite all right.
It's very generous.

140
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,327
I think. Oh, just a moment.

141
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,227
- Thank you, sir.
- With my compliments.

142
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:44,294
The quaint young man
has given me an orchid.

143
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:51,172
In my country they grow like weeds,
you know.

144
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:53,144
Come, Belinha.

145
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:58,841
Senhora, would your niece prefer
a geranium? Or a begonia, perhaps?

146
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:33,642
Pull in your apples, boys.
Here comes William Tell.

147
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,594
Well, Roger's done it again.

148
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:51,760
Yeah, and just as I was getting
caught up with my alimony too.

149
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:56,898
That Sir Galahad has gotten us kicked out
of every job from Maine to Miami.

150
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,203
I wonder where we go from here.

151
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:02,677
Heads we go north,
and tails we go south.

152
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:04,509
And the quarter goes to the bellhop.

153
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:07,585
- Hey, that's my case two bits.
- Here comes Fred.

154
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:10,244
Boys, boys and girls,
and you too, Honey.

155
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,015
Have I got a surprise for you?

156
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,591
- It couldn't be money.
- Well, what is it?

157
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,285
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is really good news.

158
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,124
Rog has outdone himself.

159
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:22,631
I'll bet he's broken both legs running after
two women at the same time.

160
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:25,635
Nothing of the kind.
He's landed us a job in Rio.

161
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:28,831
Rio de Janeiro.
The Hotel Atlantico.

162
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:34,275
- We'll be flying down any morning now.
- And swimming back in the afternoon.

163
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:36,244
I'm taking my water wings.

164
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,282
Will one of you boys pass out
these salary checks?

165
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:40,942
- Gladly.
- I said one of you.

166
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,314
Well, I can pass them out.

167
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:45,480
Here, Eddie, you do it.
Get in line, you guys.

168
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,196
Oh, I beg your par...

169
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:31,398
- Good morning.
- Mr. Bond, I'm so sorry.

170
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,300
- I had no idea I was making trouble.
- Think nothing of it.

171
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:38,569
I'm just accepting a new engagement,
and not to dance either.

172
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:41,975
Please don't be angry with me.

173
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:43,911
I'm sorry.

174
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:51,415
I must send this.

175
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,491
You see, we missed the plane
to Rio de Janeiro...

176
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:57,327
...on account of Titia's headache.

177
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:02,433
- Did you say Rio de Janeiro?
- Yes.

178
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:06,367
Father is not so well
and wants me there right away.

179
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:09,403
What a strange coincidence.

180
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:11,834
It happens...

181
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:15,970
It just so happens that I have a friend
who's flying his own plane down south.

182
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,979
How far is he going?

183
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,516
Just as far as you want him to.

184
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:26,056
If he could fly me to Port-au-Prince, I could
still catch this morning's plane to Rio.

185
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,692
Do you think he'd take me?

186
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,487
Take you?

187
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,755
Well, I think I could persuade him.

188
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:33,796
Oh, how nice of you.

189
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:36,298
I'll go right up
and tell Titia to pack at once.

190
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:40,303
No, just a moment. You see...

191
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:45,240
...my friend's plane is very small,
and it only has room for one passenger.

192
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:48,744
- Oh, dear.
- Are you afraid your aunt won't let you?

193
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:52,077
She'd have to for Father's sake.

194
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,548
Dear Father.

195
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:56,688
Titia can take the next plane.
I'll tell her.

196
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:06,227
- Hi, Rog. Everything all set?
- I hope so, baby. I hope so.

197
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:10,392
Shall I lay out your heliotrope coveralls,
or the pink ones with the tan grease spots?

198
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:14,698
Well, I usually fly with you, don't I?
Or am I just a fly in the carburetor?

199
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,570
Well, I tell you, Freddy, old man,
you see, it's this way:

200
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:21,543
I met a friend, a very old friend
who asked me as a very special favor.

201
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,410
You know how it is.
You'll have to fly down with the boys.

202
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,019
You don't mind, do you? See they
have a dill pickle with their box lunch.

203
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:31,418
Oh, and send this wire saying
we're coming, and I'll see you in Rio.

204
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,989
"Flying Down to Rio."

205
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,320
Boy, what a title for a new song.
You like that?

206
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:36,927
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

207
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:38,996
And the very name
for that new number too.

208
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:40,291
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

209
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,798
Well, see you in Rio, boy.

210
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,229
Yeah.

211
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:59,083
Is this the plane of the gentleman
who is taking a lady to Rio?

212
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:03,347
Yes, ma'am. If you're the lady who expects
to go to Rio with the gentleman in the plane.

213
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:04,853
My niece is going.

214
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:08,187
- Kindly conduct us.
- Yes, ma'am. Right this way.

215
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:12,390
Are you the conductor?

216
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:15,033
Have you the proper credentials?

217
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,167
Are you married?

218
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:23,300
You have children?

219
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:31,341
Why does he not speak?
Is he a deaf mute, or only dumb?

220
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:34,145
Please, Titia, he's doing us a favor.

221
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,118
I don't know.
He does not appear to be quite right.

222
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,223
Perhaps I'd better go along.

223
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,360
No, you can't. You see, it won't fly
with more than two aboard.

224
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:45,554
Here we go.
Step right up, miss.

225
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,630
There we are.

226
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:52,637
- Wait, I have not kissed my niece yet.
- Don't worry, lady.

227
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:54,272
He'll take care of that for you.

228
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,844
Belinha, do not speak to him
unless it is absolutely necessary.

229
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:14,725
Oh, dear me. Something tells me
I should never have let her go.

230
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:18,352
Rodriguez, get them down.
Go after them.

231
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,967
Senhora De Rezende,
I was a good coachman.

232
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:27,128
You made of me a chauffeur,
but you cannot expect me to be an eagle.

233
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:39,084
Do I have to fly all the way to Haiti
on a piano bench?

234
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:44,149
Do l...?

235
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:09,343
<i>Just a gigolo</i>

236
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:13,374
<i>Everywhere I go</i>

237
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:08,004
Was that a close shave.

238
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:21,549
Wasn't it fortunate this
convenient beach was at your disposal...

239
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,052
...when the motor went wrong?

240
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:40,632
Or perhaps your plane always makes a forced
landing when you have a lady passenger?

241
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:46,367
I don't think it's anything serious.

242
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:49,006
Probably just the gas line.

243
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:50,580
We should be off in no time.

244
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:54,881
I'll believe you
when we're in the air again.

245
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:25,680
- So you're going to be a sap and fix it, huh?
- What?

246
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:29,787
When was there a better opportunity
for dirty work at the crossroads?

247
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:33,914
Throw away a part of the motor.
She'll never know the difference.

248
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,920
Listen, your suggestions have been
getting me into messes all my life.

249
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:40,497
And I'm the one who ends up
getting his face slapped.

250
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:45,899
All right, but don't keep reminding me
of the opportunity you missed.

251
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:50,698
Well, I suppose I'll never hear the end of it
unless I do as you say.

252
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,914
This is gonna be more serious
than I thought.

253
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:09,185
Of course he's deliberately
trying to keep you here.

254
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,921
That's why he picked a deserted island.

255
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,860
Isn't that what you want?

256
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:16,500
I can't let him know that.

257
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:20,365
After all, I must maintain my reserve.

258
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:22,798
You and your reserve.

259
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:28,242
If people knew you as I do,
they might be a little bit shocked.

260
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,949
Now give her your bag of tricks.
You know how we always do it.

261
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,087
Start with your music.

262
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:41,453
- I don't think she'll fall for that old line.
- We haven't met one yet who didn't.

263
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:47,326
What will I play?

264
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:51,765
Can't you get an inspiration
by just looking at her? Look at her.

265
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,973
She's like an orchid.

266
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:00,569
And there's the moonlight.
"Orchids in the Moonlight."

267
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:03,681
There, I've given you
another title for a song.

268
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:33,565
If they only understood themselves
as we do.

269
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:36,970
Isn't it silly how humans deny themselves
the things they want most?

270
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:42,011
To satisfy stupid convention.
But we can speak the truth.

271
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,613
I can say I love you.

272
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:03,430
Oh, I didn't mean this.
I don't know how it happened.

273
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:07,629
What difference does it make?
It happened, isn't that enough?

274
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:15,403
No, you don't understand.

275
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,810
I haven't the right.

276
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:22,678
My life has long been arranged.

277
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:31,761
Don't tell me anything so 18th-century
as a family arrangement could...

278
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,990
We do things so in my country.

279
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:41,766
Then I'm going to institute
some radical changes in your country.

280
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:46,974
But my fiancé has even built me
a beautiful home on Rio bay.

281
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,204
But you love me.

282
00:27:49,448 --> 00:27:52,975
- You're taking a lot for granted.
- And I love you.

283
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:56,919
You don't even know my name.
You must forget tonight.

284
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:59,114
Now you're talking a lot for granted.

285
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,452
I'm determined
that you'll never see me again.

286
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,823
If I have to turn the country upside down,
I'll see you.

287
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:08,228
- I won't permit you.
- We'll see about that.

288
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,665
- You'll do just as I say.
- Oh, will I?

289
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:13,800
- You will.
- I will not.

290
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:17,908
Your family, your fiancé, the army, the navy,
and all of South America can't stop me.

291
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,544
And if you're silly enough to think that...

292
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:25,348
I've stood about enough from you.

293
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,775
Oh, miss.

294
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:56,837
Oh, miss.

295
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,042
Good morning.

296
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:06,147
I'm just going down to the corner drugstore
to get some breakfast.

297
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:09,555
Is there any special way
you like your coconut juice?

298
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:12,252
Say, listen...

299
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:16,094
...l'm not going to spend the rest
of my days with a dumb wife.

300
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:24,465
Well, if you're going to act that way,
I've got some looking around to do.

301
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,703
Mr. Bond.

302
00:29:56,441 --> 00:30:00,605
Mr. Bond, where are you?
Where are you?

303
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:03,005
Roger, where are you?
Where have you gone?

304
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:05,046
- What's the matter?
- Wild men. Cannibals.

305
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:07,014
Where?

306
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:11,947
Roger. Roger, darling. Roger.

307
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:14,453
What happened?

308
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:16,890
I don't know.

309
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:31,507
Oh, I say.

310
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,871
I beg your pardon, sir...

311
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,639
...but it is strictly
against the rules to move the ball.

312
00:30:39,684 --> 00:30:42,551
Say, what kind of
a desert island is this, anyway?

313
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:45,281
- Where are we?
- This is Haiti, sir.

314
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:47,448
Port-au-Prince Golf Club.

315
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,026
I was availing myself
an early morning practice...

316
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:53,358
...for the caddy's tournament, sir.
- But I saw wild men.

317
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:59,061
The bellhops taking their morning dip.

318
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:03,708
Wild men, fancy that.

319
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:08,138
Say, is there any place near here
where I can get a mechanic to fix my plane?

320
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:12,215
Oh, certainly, sir.
The airport's a five-minute jaunt from here.

321
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,410
If you'll listen, you can hear them
warming up the Rio plane.

322
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:17,384
We caught up
with yesterday's plane?

323
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:20,047
Oh, yes, sir.
It spends the night here.

324
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:23,352
- It leaves in 10 minutes.
- Splendid.

325
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:26,827
I'll get my bag and take the Rio plane
the rest of the way.

326
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:32,095
Thank you so much for the lift, Mr. Bond.
It was lovely of you. Goodbye.

327
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,364
- Come.
- Right-o.

328
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,703
Say, wait a minute.
I can fix my plane in a jiffy.

329
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:47,144
- To Rio.
- Right-o.

330
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:54,222
If you're looking for the part
of your motor you threw away...

331
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:57,190
...you'll find it on top of the piano.

332
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:08,632
Oh, this isn't just another girl, Julio.
This is the real thing.

333
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,064
Old man cupid
didn't fire an arrow this time.

334
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:13,704
No, sir. He sunk a harpoon.

335
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:17,399
- So this time it's a Brazilian girl?
- And what a Brazilian girl.

336
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:21,773
I'm goofy about her.
I am crazy for her.

337
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:23,846
As a matter of fact, I like her.

338
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:27,314
I met her in Miami at the Hibiscus Hotel.

339
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:31,681
Yes, she was traveling
with one of those Dona Elenas.

340
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:34,420
And talk about luck.

341
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:39,222
The day you sent for me, her father got
sick and she had to hurry back here to Rio.

342
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:43,060
And you'll be seeing her here, of course?

343
00:33:43,234 --> 00:33:47,568
No, that's the catch.
She wouldn't tell me her name or address.

344
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,001
Then it's all on your side.

345
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:51,506
In a pig's monocle.
She's dizzy about me.

346
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:52,938
Did she tell you so?

347
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:55,739
She didn't have to tell me.
I can take a hint.

348
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:58,041
I tell you, Julio, she is exquisite.

349
00:33:58,216 --> 00:34:02,243
She has a face like a flower, a rose.

350
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,355
What am I talking about?
She's like an orchid, a white orchid.

351
00:34:06,691 --> 00:34:09,626
- She sounds enchanting.
- Enchanting, bewildering.

352
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:12,490
Bewitching, intoxicating, devastating.

353
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:16,725
I tell you, Julio, every time I think about her
I want to bite myself, and that's news.

354
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:23,063
She has beautiful black hair
and big brown eyes, eh, Roger?

355
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:27,143
How true, how true.
And has she got:

356
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:33,948
And when she smiles
there's a funny little curve to her mouth?

357
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,587
That's right.
But how would you know?

358
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:41,056
And, Julio, that wonderful night
we spent on the beach together.

359
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:46,562
Just the two of us alone,
not a soul for miles and miles.

360
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,065
- Was there a moon?
- A glorious moon.

361
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,300
There would be a moon.

362
00:34:58,476 --> 00:35:01,445
- It all comes back to me now.
- Yes?

363
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:03,740
- I took her passionately in my arms.
- Yes?

364
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:06,679
- And as I drew her to me...
- Yes?

365
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:08,716
No, it was too beautiful.

366
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:11,449
Too sacred to talk about.

367
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:15,252
Roger, what happened after you took her
passionately in your arms...

368
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:17,520
...and drew her to you?

369
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:22,132
- That's when I ran into difficulties.
- Difficulties?

370
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,168
It seems the poor kid is already engaged
to some local cluck...

371
00:35:26,337 --> 00:35:29,067
...who signed her before
she knew any better.

372
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:34,036
A poor, defenseless child
in a baby buggy.

373
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:37,010
And now the mug is trying
to hold her to it...

374
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:41,710
...by squawking about some shack he's
knocked together for her on the waterfront.

375
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,621
- Did you ever hear of a heel like that?
- No.

376
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:47,581
Thanks.

377
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:50,821
Julio, I want you to do something for me.

378
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:52,690
I want you to help me find her.

379
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:54,764
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

380
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:57,458
Oh, no, Roger. I could not do that.

381
00:35:57,635 --> 00:36:00,536
- With us an engagement is very serious.
- Serious?

382
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:04,402
Don't you think it's serious when every time
I think of her I wanna bite myself?

383
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:07,636
Boy, am I suffering.
Well, here's to her.

384
00:36:07,812 --> 00:36:09,177
And happiness.

385
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:12,407
Thanks, old man. Thanks a lot.

386
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:17,811
Hey, Rog? Oh, Rog, the boys are downstairs.
We're waiting for you.

387
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:20,583
Hey, hey, no more
of that bathroom drinking.

388
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:24,926
Listen, we have to go and hear
the Turuna Turuna band tonight.

389
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:27,360
I can't go hear anything.
I gotta go find someone.

390
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:28,760
Go find someone?

391
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,460
That look in his eye.

392
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:33,228
You don't mean the senhorita?

393
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:35,634
After that frosting you got in Miami?

394
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:39,038
Boy, she made him look
like an angel cake.

395
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,700
Well, I guess it's no use.

396
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,211
I see you've got your hunting suit on.

397
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:47,875
Say, keep out of jail, will you?
They throw the keys in the bay down here.

398
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:52,386
So long, fella. Nice guy,
but he takes his work too seriously.

399
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:54,787
Pardon me, Rog.
I must make a phone call.

400
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:57,018
Sure, help yourself.
Make yourself at home.

401
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:01,454
Julio. I was just thinking about you.

402
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:05,425
But you're going to see me tomorrow night
at the Aviator's Club.

403
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,665
I must see you tonight.

404
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,101
It's very important.

405
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:12,507
Wait, dear, I'll ask Titia.

406
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:14,508
Julio wants to see me tonight.

407
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:17,376
Have him come over.

408
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:23,144
Julio, darling, I'm so sorry.
Titia says no.

409
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:25,221
You see, we're so busy.

410
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:28,014
You do understand, don't you?

411
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,592
Oh, you're such a dear.

412
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:32,286
Good night.

413
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:35,889
We are so busy thinking
about a band leader.

414
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,500
Darling, Titia...

415
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:49,045
...you know I'd never do anything
to hurt Julio, don't you?

416
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:53,950
But, darling, mayn't I have just a little fun
before I settle down...

417
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:57,110
...and start having all of those thousands
of children?

418
00:37:57,288 --> 00:37:59,051
Belinha!

419
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:03,956
What's the matter?

420
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:06,926
- Didn't she have a friend for you?
- Yes. Oh, no.

421
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:09,089
- We are just making some plans.
- No, thanks.

422
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:12,361
There's going to be a ball
at the Aviator's Club tomorrow night.

423
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:16,997
- I want you and Fred to be my guests.
- Swell. Maybe she'll be there.

424
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:18,164
It's possible.

425
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:21,278
Say, that would be a great place
to try out my new song.

426
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:23,107
Listen, I'll show you how it goes.

427
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:27,449
I call it "Orchids in the Moonlight."
I wrote it for her.

428
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:57,209
- It's a nice cozy little spot you have here.
- Thank you.

429
00:38:57,382 --> 00:39:01,580
I personally myself
will escort you to your table.

430
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:03,584
This way, please.

431
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:06,383
I also have the honor to visit
your country once.

432
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:08,115
I play vaudeville.

433
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:12,228
I played Milwaukee, Cincinnati,
Newport News...

434
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,990
...and Schenectady.

435
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,428
- Schenectady?
- Yes.

436
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:21,038
- You ever play Syracuse?
- Syracuse, sure. I play four, five times a day.

437
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:24,902
- Nice work, if you can get it.
- Yes, and the most astonishing thing was...

438
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:27,442
- Did you play there?
- Yes. No. Yes.

439
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:30,445
The most astonishing was
that the audience always laughed.

440
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,708
Laughed. You're telling us.

441
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:35,876
I also have reserved those tables
for your Clippings.

442
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,681
Clippers, if you don't mind.

443
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:39,447
Yes, thank you, Clippings.

444
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:43,151
And this table here, please.
This table for you.

445
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:44,794
Senhorita, sit down.

446
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:48,921
Now, I want you to admire
my greatest attraction, the Turunas.

447
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:55,830
Turunas? They look like
a bunch of zombies to me.

448
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:58,202
So that quartet's a band.

449
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,606
Well, if that's our only competition...

450
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:02,678
Don't hurt the old boy's feelings.

451
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:12,985
We have some distinguished visitors
from our sister continent, North America.

452
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:16,183
- Shall we play them a foxtrot?
- No, we want the Carioca.

453
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,624
- Play the Carioca.
- The Carioca. Play the Carioca.

454
00:40:19,297 --> 00:40:21,629
- Carioca.
- Why don't you play the Carioca?

455
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:25,762
What's the matter
with the foxtrot?

456
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:30,670
Pardon me, senhor. The American foxtrot
is considered too tame, too dull.

457
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:33,970
- Our people prefer the Carioca.
- I see.

458
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:38,707
- You mean, they prefer it in public?
- <i>Sí, senhorita.</i> Everybody in Rio.

459
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:42,576
Very well, then.

460
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:45,712
Boys, the Carioca.

461
00:40:57,235 --> 00:41:00,534
If that's all they can do, we're a cinch.
Our band will be a sensation.

462
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:05,630
- Think they've got something.
- They have.

463
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,670
This stuff is swell, but we can't do it.

464
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:24,883
So that's the Carioca.

465
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:30,084
- What's this business about the foreheads?
- Mental telepathy.

466
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:32,729
I can tell what they're thinking
about from here.

467
00:42:39,437 --> 00:42:41,530
The trick is to keep
your mind a blank.

468
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:43,674
With that music?

469
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:49,473
Oh, Freddy, is my mind red.

470
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:27,480
- Our stuff can't top this.
- I guess Roger's gotten us in bad again.

471
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:29,779
It'll be a long walk back home from here.

472
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:32,889
Just how much does it cost
to get home from here?

473
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:37,960
Home nothing. I'd like to try
this thing just once.

474
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:40,123
Come on, Honey.

475
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:42,129
We'll show them a thing or three.

476
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,310
It's a Carioca!

477
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,193
<i>Say, have you seen the Carioca?</i>

478
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:01,031
<i>It's not a foxtrot or a polka</i>

479
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:06,404
<i>It has a little bit of a new rhythm</i>
<i>A blue rhythm that sighs</i>

480
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:09,311
<i>It has a meter that is tricky</i>

481
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,108
<i>A bit of wicked wacki-wicky</i>

482
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:18,244
<i>But when you dance it with a new love</i>
<i>There'll be true love in her eyes</i>

483
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:24,661
<i>You'll dream of the new Carioca</i>

484
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:29,664
<i>Its theme is a kiss and sigh</i>

485
00:46:29,834 --> 00:46:34,794
<i>You'll dream of the new Carioca</i>

486
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:39,910
<i>When music and lights are gone</i>
<i>And we're saying goodbye</i>

487
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:56,452
<i>Two heads together</i>
<i>They say are better than one</i>

488
00:46:56,627 --> 00:46:59,152
<i>Two heads together</i>
<i>That's how this dance is begun</i>

489
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,422
<i>Two arms around you</i>

490
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:03,192
<i>And lips that sigh</i>
<i>"I am yours, and you are mine"</i>

491
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:08,066
<i>While the Carioca carries you away</i>

492
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:13,905
<i>Mine while we Carioca</i>
<i>Till the break of day</i>

493
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,631
<i>Say, have you seen the Carioca?</i>

494
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,496
<i>It's not a foxtrot or a polka</i>

495
00:48:45,669 --> 00:48:51,039
<i>It has a little bit of new rhythm</i>
<i>A blue rhythm that sighs</i>

496
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:53,642
<i>It's got a meter that is tricky</i>

497
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:56,439
<i>A bit of wicked wacki-wicky</i>

498
00:48:56,614 --> 00:49:02,780
<i>But when you dance it with a new love</i>
<i>There'll be true love in her eyes</i>

499
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:08,687
<i>You'll dream of a new Carioca</i>

500
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:13,728
<i>Its theme is a kiss and a sigh</i>

501
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:20,234
<i>I'll say, you're gonna dream</i>
<i>Of the new Carioca</i>

502
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:26,468
<i>When music and lights are gone</i>
<i>And you're saying goodbye</i>

503
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:01,240
Boy, no wonder it never gets cold
in this country.

504
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:48,792
Kind of hot.
Let's try a little of that, babe.

505
00:51:42,112 --> 00:51:44,307
<i>Now that you've done the Carioca</i>

506
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:46,813
<i>You'll never care to do the polka</i>

507
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:51,284
<i>And then you'll realize the blue hula</i>
<i>And bamboola are through</i>

508
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:54,219
<i>Tomorrow morning you'll discover</i>

509
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:56,621
<i>You're just a Carioca lover</i>

510
00:51:56,794 --> 00:52:01,595
<i>And when you dance it with your new love</i>
<i>There'll be true love just for you</i>

511
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:06,902
<i>You're gonna dream of the new Carioca</i>

512
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:11,200
<i>Its theme is a kiss and a sigh</i>

513
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:17,109
<i>I say, you're gonna dream</i>
<i>Of the new Carioca</i>

514
00:52:17,281 --> 00:52:21,741
<i>When music and lights are gone</i>
<i>And you've said goodbye</i>

515
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,540
Those shadows are here again.

516
00:52:49,713 --> 00:52:51,738
- Who are they, Antonio?
- They're Greeks.

517
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,213
A gambling syndicate from Monte Carlo.

518
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:56,079
They want to take this hotel over.

519
00:52:56,253 --> 00:52:58,414
How can they get it away
from De Rezende?

520
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:01,456
They look like they could take anything
away from anybody.

521
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:04,253
Speaking for myself
and my colleagues at the bank...

522
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:09,866
...we anticipate some difficulty
concerning the gambling permit.

523
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,193
The permit will be arranged.

524
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:13,666
Wires will be pulled.

525
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:17,238
Myself and my colleagues would feel
considerably embarrassed...

526
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:23,312
...should Carlos De Rezende be able
to meet his obligation in spite of everything.

527
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:29,275
That contingency will not arise.
Steps will be taken.

528
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:32,280
Speaking for myself and my colleagues...

529
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:36,153
...we will give the matter
our personal attention.

530
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:49,838
Listen, I'd recognize her a block away.

531
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:52,237
You're looking for a noodle in a haystack.

532
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:53,398
Cookies!

533
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:56,603
Come on, we've got to think up an idea
that will top that Carioca.

534
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,715
I know. Supposing we do
a number with musical saws...

535
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:02,408
...and we could end up
by sawing Honey in half.

536
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:06,420
I'd much rather split a banana split
three ways. Come on.

537
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:11,220
Well, you two work it out.
I'll go and find her.

538
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:15,161
- She's probably miles from here.
- That's right. Sure she is. I know she is.

539
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:17,698
- You do?
- Yeah, I feel psychic.

540
00:54:17,868 --> 00:54:20,803
Look. Walk straight ahead three blocks,
then turn left three...

541
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:23,132
...then to your right two,
then bear left four.

542
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:25,867
Then to the right, then to the left.

543
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:29,411
- I'm gonna settle this thing right now.
- Oh, Freddy.

544
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,707
How did you ask
for little tarts in Portuguese?

545
00:54:31,882 --> 00:54:35,283
Don't heckle me.
Try the Culbertson System.

546
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:39,117
Good afternoon, <i>senhorita e senhora.</i>
You remember me.

547
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,849
I'm Roger Bond's friend.
You had us thrown out of Miami.

548
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:48,760
This man, take him away.

549
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:54,302
You have insulted my patrons, senhor.
You are in the wrong part of town.

550
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:56,268
Scram.

551
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:06,742
Hiya, Tarzan.

552
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:08,646
Been having fun?

553
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:11,845
If you even speak to that girl
they throw you out on the sidewalk.

554
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:13,922
Boy, is that class.

555
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:17,026
Want a cookie? Take your choice?

556
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:56,998
Not bad.

557
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:15,709
Pardon.

558
00:56:18,722 --> 00:56:20,815
- Hello, Fred.
- Hello, Julio.

559
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,891
- Where's Roger?
- Where's Roger?

560
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,487
I haven't seen him.
I thought he'd be with you.

561
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:27,926
No, I haven't heard a word from him.

562
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:31,363
Well, shall we try the jails first,
or the asylums?

563
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:33,626
- I hope he gets here soon.
- So do I.

564
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:37,069
The junior members are putting on
a special tango to his new music.

565
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:43,270
Fred, I want you to meet my fiancée,
Senhorita Rezende. This is Mr. Ayres.

566
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:46,848
- How do you do?
- Yes, how do you do?

567
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:51,784
And her aunt, Dona Elena De Rezende.
Mr. Ayres.

568
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:57,082
- Belinha, is that not the young man?
- Of course.

569
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:00,752
We met Mr. Ayres today
in the pastry shop quite by accident.

570
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:04,867
He left rather suddenly
and without saying goodbye.

571
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:08,471
Yes. I said goodbye
but you didn't hear me.

572
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:11,539
I was out on my...
I was outside at the time.

573
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,835
Well, I guess I'd better go
and stop Roger...

574
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,604
I mean, I think I know
where to find Roger.

575
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,441
If you'll excuse me.

576
00:57:18,615 --> 00:57:21,243
It's awfully nice to have meeting you.

577
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:26,789
The boys are here again.

578
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,658
It's okay with me.

579
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,038
Darling, I thought you had deserted us.

580
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:47,938
I was looking for the mayor.

581
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:24,476
Is this the new composition?

582
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:28,940
Oh, yes. They're playing it
for the first time.

583
00:59:55,972 --> 00:59:58,873
Will you excuse me for a moment?

584
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:07,248
Did you say something to her?

585
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:10,782
Not a word. Pardon me.

586
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:15,022
Oh, let them be alone.

587
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:20,652
After all, the child has been away so long.
They'll soon be married.

588
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:34,039
Anything wrong, dear?

589
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:37,211
No. Oh, no.

590
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,980
It was so warm in there.

591
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:46,250
- Romantic music, isn't it?
- Isn't it?

592
01:00:48,091 --> 01:00:51,356
The words are romantic too.
And dangerous.

593
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:56,522
For instance, in the moonlight
on a tropical island...

594
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:01,797
...they might make any woman
fall in love with any man.

595
01:01:14,985 --> 01:01:20,150
<i>When orchids bloom in the moonlight</i>

596
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:25,488
<i>And lovers vow to be true</i>

597
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:31,032
<i>I still can dream in the moonlight</i>

598
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:37,037
<i>Of one dear night that we knew</i>

599
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:42,406
<i>When orchids fade in the dawning</i>

600
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:48,176
<i>They speak of tears and goodbye</i>

601
01:01:48,618 --> 01:01:54,523
<i>Though my dreams are shattered</i>
<i>Like the petals scattered</i>

602
01:01:54,691 --> 01:02:00,652
<i>Still my love can never die</i>

603
01:02:01,664 --> 01:02:06,931
<i>There is rest in the twilight</i>

604
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:12,473
<i>When the day is through</i>

605
01:02:12,642 --> 01:02:18,274
<i>But the shadows that fall</i>
<i>Only seem to recall</i>

606
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:24,648
<i>All my longing for you</i>

607
01:02:24,821 --> 01:02:29,758
<i>There's a dream in the moonbeams</i>

608
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:35,455
<i>Upon a sea of blue</i>

609
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:38,863
<i>But the moonbeams that fall</i>

610
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:43,165
<i>Only seem to recall</i>

611
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:46,604
<i>Love is all</i>

612
01:02:46,776 --> 01:02:52,715
<i>Love is you</i>

613
01:02:53,716 --> 01:02:55,115
Belinha.

614
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:59,779
Julio. Oh, Julio, marry me right away.

615
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:02,186
Of course, darling.

616
01:03:02,826 --> 01:03:05,795
Hiya, boy. You seem to be
doing all right with my song.

617
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:13,967
Belinha, I want you to meet my friend,
my best friend.

618
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:16,630
Mr. Roger Bond.

619
01:03:17,574 --> 01:03:21,408
This is Senhorita Rezende,
my fiancée.

620
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:24,137
Your fiancée?

621
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,972
But this is the...

622
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:28,077
- Then you're the...?
- Yes.

623
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:32,210
I'm the local cluck who built her
a shack on the waterfront.

624
01:03:32,522 --> 01:03:36,583
Say, this is going to be just too bad...

625
01:03:36,926 --> 01:03:39,087
...for one of us.

626
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:48,430
Oh, Mr. Ayres.

627
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:53,374
Isn't this our dance?

628
01:03:53,543 --> 01:03:58,446
Oh, yes. Yes, of course. As a matter
of fact, I was just looking for you.

629
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:09,288
I am so glad you came along.

630
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:11,791
Thanks. But I guess
I'll be going along any minute.

631
01:04:11,961 --> 01:04:12,985
Why?

632
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:17,827
Well, maybe those shock troops at the door
won't see me with you out here.

633
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:35,073
I knew it.

634
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:45,355
Look, Belinha is dancing our tango
with an <i>americano.</i>

635
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:54,295
What laundry do you send your shirts to?

636
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,403
Say, this is a kind of tough spot, isn't it?

637
01:04:59,576 --> 01:05:00,873
I don't know.

638
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:03,410
Things like this usually
straighten themselves out.

639
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,639
Shall we let nature take
its course?

640
01:05:05,815 --> 01:05:09,649
Yes, nature and common sense.

641
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:12,720
Well, I guess I'll just stick to nature.

642
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:18,220
Anyhow, the girl usually does the deciding,
doesn't she, Julio?

643
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:33,867
Gentlemen...

644
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:38,070
...my colleagues at the bank
and I are perfectly satisfied...

645
01:05:38,248 --> 01:05:41,308
...that De Rezende's opening
will be a failure.

646
01:05:41,484 --> 01:05:43,645
The mayor is away.

647
01:05:44,254 --> 01:05:49,385
Without an entertainment permit
the hotel will be a fiasco.

648
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:53,359
In a week we should be able to turn it over
to your syndicate.

649
01:06:02,739 --> 01:06:05,003
- Good morning, Freddy.
- Hello, Honey.

650
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:07,904
Where did you get
the dog-and-pony act?

651
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,942
It's worse than that.

652
01:06:10,113 --> 01:06:12,013
The MacCarthy sisters.

653
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:14,615
A bicycle act from Brooklyn.

654
01:06:15,852 --> 01:06:19,379
I found those two
on the American consul's doorstep.

655
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:23,848
That one was left behind
on a world cruise for school teachers.

656
01:06:24,027 --> 01:06:28,521
And last but not the least, we have
the yes girls from that Carioca cabaret.

657
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:33,902
Cheer up, Freddy.
They teach kangaroos to box.

658
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:39,872
Well, toodle-oo. If you need me, send one
of the MacCarthy's over on her bicycle.

659
01:06:41,744 --> 01:06:45,043
All right, girls. Now, sit down
and we'll talk this thing over.

660
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:50,345
Now, the first thing we've got to do
is concentrate, understand? If we don't...

661
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,819
Hey, boys.
Wait a minute, will you?

662
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:56,015
Now, the idea is...

663
01:06:56,192 --> 01:06:57,750
Hey, Rog.

664
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,364
Listen, girls...

665
01:07:03,366 --> 01:07:06,961
Hey, Rog, how do you expect me
to teach these follies girls if you don't...?

666
01:07:07,837 --> 01:07:09,737
Listen, girls...

667
01:08:07,096 --> 01:08:09,064
Now, girls, listen.
The idea...

668
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:15,633
- You always was good, Fred.
- Thanks.

669
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:19,707
Listen, girls, you got a routine
to learn here, you understand?

670
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:26,280
Oh, you like it? Great, great.
Listen, girls...

671
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,116
Oh, thanks very much. Thanks.
And you too, son.

672
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:37,991
Listen, now, girls,
why not take this thing...

673
01:08:42,165 --> 01:08:45,828
- No, senhor.
- No? Maybe you'll like this one better.

674
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:54,942
- No, no.
- You're right. That's terrible.

675
01:08:58,281 --> 01:08:59,612
No, no, no.

676
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:07,345
No, no, no.

677
01:09:24,173 --> 01:09:26,835
- What is it? What's happened?
- Senhorita Rezende.

678
01:09:30,947 --> 01:09:34,075
- They say the rehearsals must stop.
- What?

679
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,844
It seems my father
has no entertainment permit.

680
01:09:37,019 --> 01:09:41,217
Oh, is that all? Well, in my country...
Hey, Rog, give me 50 bucks.

681
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,381
No, don't. That's a prison offense.

682
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:47,455
Belinha, your robe.

683
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:51,191
Senhor Rezende. The police tell us
you forgot to get a license for the show.

684
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:52,595
Oh, I did not forget.

685
01:09:52,768 --> 01:09:55,601
I have a license
for the original opening date.

686
01:09:55,771 --> 01:09:59,138
I did not know there would be trouble
about opening earlier.

687
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:03,074
But a new license cannot be issued
without the authority of the mayor...

688
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:05,840
...and he has gone on a trip
to the interior.

689
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:08,916
Nobody knows why or when
or for how long.

690
01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:11,485
What about the acting mayor,
the district attorney?

691
01:10:11,654 --> 01:10:14,020
The commissioner of parks and buildings?

692
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:16,920
- Sure, there must be someone.
- I have tried everything.

693
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:20,119
I am afraid there will be no opening.
I hope you will forgive me.

694
01:10:27,336 --> 01:10:29,361
Come, darling.

695
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:35,739
Hey, Rog, we gotta do something
about this.

696
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:40,781
And I know just what to do.

697
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,747
- Where's Julio?
- At the Aviator's Club

698
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:45,217
That's perfect.
Now, listen, this is terrific.

699
01:10:45,388 --> 01:10:48,846
If we can get all the members
of that organization to cooperate with us...

700
01:10:49,025 --> 01:10:50,890
...then the president of China
can't stop us.

701
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:06,440
Back off, girls.

702
01:11:06,609 --> 01:11:08,338
- Everything fixed, Julio?
- Yes.

703
01:11:08,511 --> 01:11:10,376
- Hello, boy. Hello, babe.
- Hello.

704
01:11:10,546 --> 01:11:12,480
Oh, this is swell.
Look at all the planes.

705
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:16,448
Behold. As you requested, the gentlemen
of the Aviator's Club at your service.

706
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:17,847
Julio, you're marvelous.

707
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:22,514
Now all we have to do is sales talk the girls
into coming across. Come on, let's go.

708
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:26,287
And in conclusion, girls, I want to say
that I'm not asking anything of you...

709
01:11:26,462 --> 01:11:29,989
...that I wouldn't ask of my own sister.
Now, will you do it?

710
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:31,929
I'll do it. Sounds like a new thrill.

711
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:33,693
- Come on, girls.
- That's the stuff.

712
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:35,302
So that's the way it is, girls.

713
01:11:35,471 --> 01:11:39,271
And I'm not holding a thing back. I know
you'll all come through. How's about it?

714
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:41,672
- Okay with me.
- Why don't you do it yourself?

715
01:11:41,844 --> 01:11:44,210
That's just what I'm going to do,
you little witch.

716
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,814
Come on, girls, let's go.

717
01:11:53,222 --> 01:11:56,123
It's a new game, girls,
and it's just too ducky for words.

718
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:58,419
Now, let me see.

719
01:12:01,063 --> 01:12:03,759
Now, the rest of you girls
turn your backs.

720
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:06,731
That's right.
Now, don't you dare peek.

721
01:12:06,902 --> 01:12:10,065
Oh, this is going to be more darn fun.

722
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,571
- Blindman's bluff?
- That's right.

723
01:12:12,742 --> 01:12:16,439
- I thought so.
- Oh, you did, did you?

724
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:20,612
See that they're all fastened on tight.
We don't want any slip-ups.

725
01:12:30,826 --> 01:12:32,157
All right, hold still, girls.

726
01:12:32,328 --> 01:12:35,161
- <i>Say, do you think it's safe?</i>
- <i>I hope these straps will hold.</i>

727
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:38,698
<i>It's a good thing my parents</i>
<i>don't know about this.</i>

728
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:41,897
<i>To think I'd ever come to this.</i>

729
01:12:42,438 --> 01:12:45,839
- <i>I don't know whether I like this.</i>
- <i>We can't make the same mistake twice.</i>

730
01:12:46,008 --> 01:12:49,205
- Up you go.
- Okay by me.

731
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:53,073
Oh, not so tight, please.

732
01:12:55,017 --> 01:12:56,882
That hurts.

733
01:12:57,186 --> 01:13:00,678
<i>Something tells me</i>
<i>this is the wrong thing to do.</i>

734
01:13:00,956 --> 01:13:03,550
<i>I'll try anything once.</i>

735
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:06,291
Senhor Bond, one moment
of your precious time.

736
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:08,487
Senhor De Rezende send you this.

737
01:13:08,664 --> 01:13:10,325
Oh, thanks.

738
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:20,839
Saint Christopher.

739
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:52,335
I seem to have walked
into something this time.

740
01:14:08,157 --> 01:14:09,749
Oh, Mr. Fred.

741
01:14:09,925 --> 01:14:12,826
Everything's all right at the airport.
How's the house?

742
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:17,364
Look, the American tourists
from the other hotels.

743
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:20,300
I persuaded them to come here.

744
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:23,597
That's great, and they all look as if
they could pay their checks.

745
01:14:23,773 --> 01:14:27,140
- Good day, Senhorita Belinha.
- Good day, Senhor Vianna.

746
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:32,941
I came to express my sympathy...
My best wishes to your dear father.

747
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:36,243
Thank you. I will take you to him.

748
01:14:36,786 --> 01:14:40,278
Not many people here
for a grand opening.

749
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,500
Nice beach you have here.
That's what I always say.

750
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:57,230
There's nothing like a nice beach.
We have nice beaches at home too.

751
01:14:57,406 --> 01:14:59,897
We have Rockaway Beach
and we have Revere Beach.

752
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:02,300
- Check your package, sir?
- It's my medicine.

753
01:15:02,478 --> 01:15:04,207
- Check your...
- My lunch.

754
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,712
- Check...
- Am-scray.

755
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:08,473
How do you do?

756
01:15:09,218 --> 01:15:11,686
- What are all these packages?
- It's my laundry.

757
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:13,287
This is a present.

758
01:15:14,456 --> 01:15:19,985
Oh, no, no, no.
I insist that she must be checked.

759
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:23,296
We had a hard time getting her asleep.

760
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,797
I am a patient man,
but this is beyond endurance.

761
01:15:28,971 --> 01:15:32,771
Who are all these strange people
with those bundles, my dear Carlos?

762
01:15:32,942 --> 01:15:36,639
Why, they're guests
of the hotel, my dear Alfredo.

763
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:40,177
Where is Roger?
It's time for him to lead the flight.

764
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:42,715
- I don't know. I haven't seen him.
- Senhor Julio.

765
01:15:42,885 --> 01:15:46,218
The young American requested me
to give you this, this and this.

766
01:15:46,388 --> 01:15:49,050
Thank you. Pardon me.

767
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:51,988
"Dear Julio, this one is on me.

768
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:57,030
You can fly as well as I can,
so you lead the parade and be the hero.

769
01:15:58,133 --> 01:16:01,591
I'm taking a plane down to Buenos Aires.
So long, Roger.

770
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:05,171
P.S. Why don't you marry the girl?"

771
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:07,133
- What shall I do?
- Do?

772
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:11,905
Do exactly as he says and you'll be doing
everybody a favor, particularly that P.S. Part.

773
01:16:12,081 --> 01:16:14,413
"Why don't you marry the girl?"

774
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:18,248
- Elope. That's it. You and Belinha elope.
- Elope?

775
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,513
- Yeah.
- In Brazil we do not elope.

776
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:23,180
It's against the law. It's bad taste.

777
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:27,090
In Brazil it takes two weeks
to be respectably married.

778
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:30,926
Listen, I've heard somewhere,
and what's more I believe it...

779
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,968
...that the pilot of a plane is exactly like
the captain of a transatlantic liner.

780
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:37,037
Twelve miles out of port
he can marry you.

781
01:16:37,206 --> 01:16:40,107
As soon as this party's over,
you grab Belinha and a plane...

782
01:16:40,276 --> 01:16:42,335
...and put an end to all of this nonsense.

783
01:16:42,511 --> 01:16:44,411
Come on, Julio, use your Brazil nut.

784
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:56,414
What a pity it is
that you cannot have some entertainment.

785
01:16:56,725 --> 01:16:59,558
With such a distinguished guest as you,
Senhor Vianna...

786
01:16:59,728 --> 01:17:01,889
...there is no need for anything else.

787
01:17:17,613 --> 01:17:19,945
- Look.
- Oh, look.

788
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:32,416
I trust, my dear Carlos,
you are not doing anything...

789
01:17:32,594 --> 01:17:35,062
...which might offend the authorities.

790
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:38,757
I trust not, dear Alfredo.

791
01:18:35,491 --> 01:18:38,153
Roger, what are you doing here?

792
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:41,819
Well, Julio's leading the planes. I'm...

793
01:18:42,998 --> 01:18:44,795
I'm going away.

794
01:18:44,967 --> 01:18:47,731
- You're going away?
- Yeah.

795
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:52,572
Belinha, I thought everything
would work out for us...

796
01:18:53,342 --> 01:18:56,038
...but things are different
down here in Brazil...

797
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:58,202
...and I realize now that...

798
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:01,076
...well, you never could belong to me.

799
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:04,409
Yes, Roger, you're right.

800
01:19:04,686 --> 01:19:08,349
Here we belong to our families
and our promises.

801
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:13,086
Even though all we want in the world
is beautiful, crazy happiness.

802
01:19:16,865 --> 01:19:20,460
I guess I should have checked out
when I first learned about Julio.

803
01:19:21,937 --> 01:19:23,962
So...

804
01:19:24,873 --> 01:19:26,397
Goodbye.

805
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:29,270
Goodbye.

806
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,884
- Any of you fellows like music?
- Sure.

807
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:16,650
Well, let's tear it wide open.

808
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,370
- Are you ready, boys?
- Ready.

809
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:40,947
Take it.

810
01:20:44,786 --> 01:20:48,586
<i>An old sailor in old times</i>
<i>Would sing an old song</i>

811
01:20:48,757 --> 01:20:53,057
<i>Rolling down to Rio by the sea</i>

812
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:57,130
<i>A young sailor in these times</i>

814

<i>Where the lovely Brazilian ladies</i>
<i>Will catch your eye</i>

815
01:21:05,374 --> 01:21:10,209

01:21:41,243 --> 01:21:43,734

827
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:20,419
- The mayor.
- Hey, mayor!

828
01:25:24,866 --> 01:25:28,859
Carlos, Alfredo.
Sit down, gentlemen, please?

829
01:25:30,138 --> 01:25:33,403
My dear, dear Carlos.
A tremendous success.

830
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:35,600
My congratulations.

831
01:25:35,777 --> 01:25:39,907
I saw the sky writing at Teresópolis,
and I hurried down here at once.

832
01:25:40,115 --> 01:25:43,551
Vianna, you and your colleagues
ought to be very happy.

833
01:25:43,718 --> 01:25:47,449
- Yes?
- You must buy us all champagne.

834
01:25:47,622 --> 01:25:50,216
I insist. I insist.

835
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:54,458
Oh, very well. Waiter.

836
01:26:13,048 --> 01:26:14,982
Hey, how do I get out of this?

837
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,741
What's the combination?

838
01:26:20,188 --> 01:26:23,351
- Come, Belinha.
- But where? Why?

839
01:26:30,432 --> 01:26:33,162
This time, I'm taking no chances.

840
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:38,904
- Julio, where are you taking me?
- On your honeymoon.

841
01:26:39,074 --> 01:26:41,099
Don't be silly. I'm not married.

842
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:43,471
You will be before you know it.

843
01:27:28,757 --> 01:27:30,418
Can you legally marry people?

844
01:27:30,592 --> 01:27:32,822
Well, yes, if they're fools enough
to ask for it.

845
01:27:32,994 --> 01:27:34,393
Fine.

846
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:44,971
- Is this the young lady?
- Yes.

847
01:27:49,077 --> 01:27:52,240
- And this is the young man.
- Oh, fine.

848
01:27:52,414 --> 01:27:56,407
Roger, her happiness is my happiness.

849
01:28:03,024 --> 01:28:04,582
Good luck.

850
01:28:22,177 --> 01:28:24,668
Oh, look, look.

851
01:28:27,048 --> 01:28:29,539
Look, here comes Julio.

852
01:28:30,285 --> 01:28:34,449
Gosh, that gal don't care
who she gets thrown out of what.

853
