1
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:06,700
<i>We're gassed up and headed
for the Surfers' Route</i>

2
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:10,140
<i>The guys are hot-doggers
and the honeys are cute</i>

3
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,806
<i>Got a waxed board of wood
and then we're on our way</i>

4
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:20,251
<i>Yeah, Easter vacation
just started today, now</i>

5
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,414
<i>We might stay till the middle of May, now</i>

6
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,926
<i>Grab your board and
follow us to Surfers' Holiday</i>

7
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:29,554
<i>Come along, the Surfers' Holiday</i>

8
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,929
<i>We've planned out the trip
for such a long, long time, oh</i>

9
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,763
<i>Working after school, gotta save every dime</i>

10
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:40,464
<i>And all the kids knew
they had to have work before play</i>

11
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:45,836
<i>Yeah, we'll build a fire
on the beach at night, now</i>

12
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:48,938
<i>Cuddle up and I'll hold you tight, now</i>

13
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:52,315
<i>Grab your board and follow us,
it's Surfers' Holiday</i>

14
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,953
<i>Come along to Surfers' Holiday</i>

15
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:17,403
<i>Come along, the Surfers' Holiday</i>

16
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:46,802
<i>Yeah, we'll build a fire
on the beach at night, now</i>

17
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,066
<i>Cuddle up and I'll hold you tight, now</i>

18
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:53,943
<i>Grab your board and follow us
to Surfers' Holiday</i>

19
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:58,813
<i>Surfers' Holiday</i>

20
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:02,685
<i>Okay, guys, let's get going!
Get those bags and those boards! Let's go!</i>

21
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,690
Come on, Johnny boy.

22
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:07,591
<i>Come on, everybody. Let's go!</i>

23
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,167
But, honey...

24
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,370
Not again!

25
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:24,936
Boy, this is great!

26
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:27,070
Cowabunga!

27
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:29,936
<i>I'm really tired.</i>

28
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:32,534
- Good night, fellas.
- Good night.

29
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:35,775
- Animal, can you help me here?
- Why the blanket bit?

30
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,079
We might as well be staying at the YWCA.

31
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:41,143
Whose brainstorm was
the "his" and "hers" bit?

32
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,883
- Dee Dee's.
- Figures.

33
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:47,554
<i>You're wasting your time.
This little thing won't stop them.</i>

34
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:50,255
<i>Don't worry, Animal,
if any of you want to defect...</i>

35
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,389
we believe in peaceful co-existence.

36
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:56,532
Yeah. We'll be glad to take in refugees.

37
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,573
Okay, guys, knock it off. Bag some Z's.
Somebody shoot out the light.

38
00:06:02,943 --> 00:06:04,740
<i>Let's rest our eyeballs.</i>

39
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:07,974
Forget it. We've just constructed
the Walls of Jericho.

40
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:12,051
I hope one of those guys can play a trumpet.

41
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,417
<i>Let's sneak across the border.</i>

42
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:26,458
You win some, you lose some.

43
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:30,531
Do you believe this?

44
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:41,470
<i>Hey, let's go!</i>

45
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,425
<i>- Dig the Queen Mary.
- Yeah...</i>

46
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:02,457
<i>Deadhead, don't notice those things,
then you won't miss them.</i>

47
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:04,401
<i>Come on, let's hit it.</i>

48
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:58,008
This is the life, Dee Dee.
Sun and the surf. This is it.

49
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:03,154
Can you send them back to the reservation?
The other braves might get lonesome.

50
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:04,315
Yeah.

51
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:05,818
Hey, chicks.

52
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:09,589
Heap big split.
Bring back hot dog, cold drink from wars.

53
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:10,994
Go. Split.

54
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:12,691
Anything you say.

55
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,032
Man, how do you stand it?

56
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,706
- Stand what?
- Being the greatest?

57
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:27,507
How do you stand it?

58
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,311
<i>I hadn't thought about it that way.
How do I stand it?</i>

59
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,055
I'll let you in on it, Dee Dee.

60
00:09:37,157 --> 00:09:39,751
<i>It's a monkey on my back. I'm hooked.</i>

61
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:42,027
I'll tell the world you are.

62
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,585
Let me tell you.

63
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,265
Take a look at those waves out there.

64
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,268
Squint that surf.

65
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:51,826
They keep rolling in, like a belt.

66
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:54,465
5 feet, 6 feet, maybe 15, maybe 20.

67
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:58,770
When you stand on the point of them,
when you get on that step...

68
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:03,305
<i>you know there's nothing out there
but you, the sea, the sky...</i>

69
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:07,145
so mixed up, the whole world
turns over bright inside you.

70
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,650
You make it sound good.

71
00:10:09,723 --> 00:10:12,988
<i>That ain't all of it.
I think about it sometimes.</i>

72
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,029
I think that out there,
farther out than that big white boat...

73
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:19,892
<i>there's a wave, building.</i>

74
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:22,958
<i>Maybe it's 40 feet up to the crest, maybe 80.</i>

75
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:25,462
That wave is in your head.

76
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:28,731
<i>You know, that's the trouble with girls.</i>

77
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,338
<i>Girls don't fly.</i>

78
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:35,412
<i>Frankie, even a sea gull's
got to come down to earth sometime.</i>

79
00:10:36,216 --> 00:10:40,346
Not me, Dee Dee, not until the wings fall off.

80
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:42,718
- Frankie!
- Yeah.

81
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:46,722
<i>I ran so your hot dog wouldn't get cold.</i>

82
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,459
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks a lot, Animal.</i>

83
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:57,229
Remind me never to send you for hot coffee.

84
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:01,629
- Anyone for Dramamine?
- Are you sick, Dee Dee?

85
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,306
<i>Only because I don't have wings.</i>

86
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:07,345
- Forget it.
- Here, Dee Dee.

87
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,840
<i>- Johnny, thank you.
- That's all right.</i>

88
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,647
<i>No, that's really sweet.
Frankie never does anything for me.</i>

89
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,322
<i>He's always too busy
thinking about 80-foot waves.</i>

90
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,552
80-foot waves? Where?

91
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,395
Wow, here they come. Muscles Anonymous.

92
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,251
And the horses are on the track.

93
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,304
<i>If it isn't Seabiscuit!</i>

94
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,227
All right. Capes off!

95
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,974
<i>Isn't this ridiculous? Do you believe that?</i>

96
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,740
At least they know how to treat their women.

97
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:52,807
Yeah.

98
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,759
Are you all right, Jack Fanny?

99
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:03,561
Off.

100
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,200
Sorry, Jack Fanny.

101
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,714
Stand tall. Look smart. Come on.
Tall and straight.

102
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:30,783
Straighter and taller.

103
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:33,883
Today is the day of the latissimus dorsi.

104
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:35,453
We will give...

105
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,553
<i>That creep's on my blanket.</i>

106
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,497
<i>- Yeah. Let's get him off it.
- Don't forget to say "please."</i>

107
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:43,433
<i>I'm not afraid of those muscle-bound jerks.</i>

108
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:45,664
Yeah, they're not for real, anyway.

109
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:48,070
The latissimus is...

110
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,069
here. Now...

111
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:05,154
I may need your help.

112
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,490
Sorry. You were on his blanket.

113
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,856
- You made me fall.
- It was my blanket.

114
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:14,823
- It was in my way.
- It was in your way?

115
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:17,034
Wait a second, hoe-dad.

116
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:20,129
Nobody invited you
and your muscle farm to cut in here.

117
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:22,003
<i>- You live there?
- That's right.</i>

118
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:24,475
- We live over there.
- I know that.

119
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:25,772
I got an idea.

120
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:28,914
You stay on your side of the beach,
and we'll stay on ours.

121
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:31,849
<i>The beach is public. It's for everybody.</i>

122
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,352
<i>I don't think I made myself clear.</i>

123
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,716
- Him.
- "Him" what?

124
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:43,494
Frankie! Deadhead!

125
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:45,123
Help!

126
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,300
<i>Johnny! That's a cuckoo way to travel.</i>

127
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:51,560
Next time, try the train!

128
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,299
Frankie!

129
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:58,508
Help!

130
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:00,669
Come on, Frank!

131
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,114
- See that line?
- Yeah.

132
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,955
That side of the beach is yours,
and this side is mine.

133
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,148
- Get it?
- Get it?

134
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:13,419
I get it!

135
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:17,520
<i>That's the double line.
Cross it and you run into oncoming traffic.</i>

136
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,087
- Right?
- Right!

137
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,366
- Right.
- Yeah.

138
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:36,479
<i>- I'm dizzy.
- Yeah.</i>

139
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:38,380
- Did I do that?
- Yeah.

140
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,043
<i>What's so funny?</i>

141
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,985
<i>Always said you'd make headlines.</i>

142
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:10,907
What? Are you nuts?
I said a 26-story building, not 25.

143
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:14,653
Enter! I want to have a 26-story building.

144
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,711
They never have a 13th floor.

145
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:19,849
I want a 13th floor, I like the 13th floor.

146
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:23,256
<i>All right, have a 13th floor.
But it's very unlucky.</i>

147
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,058
<i>Not if it's rented.</i>

148
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:28,198
- Italy coming through.
- Italy. Hello.

149
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,569
Yeah, Gino, this is S.Z.

150
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,663
Look. Yeah, weather is beautiful.
Yeah, nice trip. Listen to me.

151
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:36,239
Buy Sicily.

152
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:37,602
What?

153
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:42,144
Okay, buy half of Sicily.
Let Sinatra have the other half.

154
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,441
All right.

155
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,943
<i>It's a nice place to put up tract homes.</i>

156
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:48,509
S.Z., I went ahead, just as you wanted.

157
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:51,386
I've checked it all out.
They're out there, all of them.

158
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:53,687
Especially him. That big one.

159
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:57,460
- Do you want me to wake the Contessa?
- No, I'll take care of that.

160
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,021
Do you think you're doing the right thing?

161
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:03,125
<i>Of course I'm doing the right thing.
I always do.</i>

162
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:06,694
<i>She's been moping in that cabin
ever since we lost that flamenco dancer...</i>

163
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:09,639
off the coast of Gibraltar.
I had to promise her something.

164
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,836
<i>I think that girl's had too much.</i>

165
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:15,039
You're a lawyer. What do you know
about beautiful, lonely women?

166
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:18,880
<i>I know that girl hasn't been alone
for two weeks since she was 18 years old.</i>

167
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,919
- You're stuffy.
- Yes.

168
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:23,751
I want you to put up a space needle in lowa.

169
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:26,792
All we own out in lowa are cornfields.

170
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,625
Stick a space needle in the middle
of the corn! Give the corn a little class.

171
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:33,256
Scout around.
When you hear something, let me know.

172
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:35,459
Mr. Matts, Madrid calling.

173
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:37,929
Cancel Spain.

174
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:41,064
We've got to leave something
for somebody else.

175
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:47,176
Julie!

176
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:49,205
<i>Julie, it's day.</i>

177
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:51,544
Coffee.

178
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,416
Coffee.

179
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:58,717
Julie?

180
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:03,928
What kind of a day
did you make for me, S. Z?

181
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,930
You just bought Sicily.

182
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:08,262
- Do I want Sicily?
- Who doesn't?

183
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:12,634
Had to give half to a singer.
You're building a space needle in lowa.

184
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:17,506
I wish your father were alive to see space
from a needle, and you say "Aww."

185
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:19,602
Julie, you're one of the giants.

186
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,308
You build skyscrapers, hotels, whole cities.

187
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:26,613
<i>- It's boring.
- Boring? Whole cities?</i>

188
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,317
Julie, where would people live?

189
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:30,952
Enter!

190
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:34,254
- Good morning, Fairchild.
- Good morning, Contessa.

191
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:36,955
Goodbye, Fairchild.

192
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:44,601
<i>I don't know.</i>

193
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,764
<i>Sometimes you don't act like
the daughter of Big Rocky Valenti.</i>

194
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,740
My name is not Valenti.

195
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:53,839
My name is Juliana Giotto-Borgini.
I am a contessa.

196
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,771
Giotto-Borgini.

197
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:59,115
You get married so you can have
a name like a foreign car.

198
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:01,210
<i>I like my name. It's sexy.</i>

199
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:04,983
Only when you say it.

200
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:09,519
<i>S.Z., you have no respect.
You know I'm a widow.</i>

201
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:13,329
<i>Pardon me,
I didn't notice that you're wearing black.</i>

202
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:19,771
- S.Z., do you have any news?
- Yeah, we found him.

203
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,136
You did?

204
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:25,473
<i>But I think it's ridiculous,
falling in love with a picture in a magazine.</i>

205
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:28,741
Put some clothes on.
I'll meet you on deck in about five minutes.

206
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:30,281
All right. Thank you.

207
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,324
<i>Theodore, I'm going to need you over there
to look after things.</i>

208
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:49,493
I'll hate it.

209
00:19:56,542 --> 00:20:00,069
What is there to hate?
Beautiful beach, healthy kids.

210
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:04,047
<i>They don't look too bad.</i>

211
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:25,861
<i>Candy's gonna start. Watch her. Wow.
Come on, Candy.</i>

212
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:40,609
There she goes.

213
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,522
<i>I'm glad I'm not out there riding the curl.</i>

214
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:49,891
<i>Once Candy gets started, it's all over.</i>

215
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,746
<i>Wow, that gal's got power.
Look at over there.</i>

216
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,285
How about that?
She must've knocked him 20 feet.

217
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:40,007
All muscles are beautiful.
The latissimus is beautiful, too...

218
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:42,647
<i>because it's a muscle.</i>

219
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:46,042
- Do you understand?
- I have a question.

220
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,045
Later.

221
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:09,303
- You like it?
- Get me over there.

222
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:19,114
<i>- He's a giant. He needs a keeper.
- I'll keep him.</i>

223
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:28,183
Come on, S.Z.

224
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,126
You, move that boat.
We want to get out to the chopper.

225
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,638
To make the muscles beautiful,
you must always have beautiful muscles.

226
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:48,942
<i>Beautiful muscles build up a guy's beauty...</i>

227
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:51,073
and the basis of the latissimus...

228
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,143
is to bring out the beauty
in the spinal column of the rib cage.

229
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:58,884
<i>That's why it's called Beauty
Latissimus Dorsi Spinal Column Rib Cage.</i>

230
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:24,847
<i>- Lower! Go lower!
- It's not a submarine!</i>

231
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:41,533
There he is! Oh, my.

232
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,228
<i>He's even more gorgeous than in photos.</i>

233
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:55,307
- Lower! Go lower!
- Lf we go any lower, we'll cut off their heads!

234
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:57,779
<i>I'm not interested in their heads.</i>

235
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:10,323
- Will you please land?
- Land? Where?

236
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:12,954
<i>I don't care. Just anywhere.
Just get me down.</i>

237
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:15,000
Anywhere. Land anywhere.

238
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:25,802
Wait a minute. Will you wait a sec?

239
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:28,039
Will you guys...

240
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:30,809
Will you hold it?

241
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:40,247
- This is one crazy beach.
- You can say that again.

242
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:43,054
This is one crazy beach.

243
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:56,132
- What are you trying to do, kill my boys?
- Not exactly. Who are you?

244
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,473
<i>- Can't you read? Jack Fanny.
- He's Jack Fanny.</i>

245
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:01,012
I would keep that quiet.

246
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,947
- Hey, wait a second...
- There he is.

247
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:06,576
- Wait a minute.
- Jack Fanny...

248
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:09,849
she came 5,000 miles to get a look
at that beast, in the flesh.

249
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:12,550
Relax. Let her take a good look, okay?

250
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:28,635
Come on, Jack Fanny.

251
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:48,553
What is this?

252
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:51,824
<i>You're looking at him
like he's some prime bull or something.</i>

253
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:55,264
<i>- Quiet, will you? She's concentrating.
- On what?</i>

254
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,397
<i>I don't like the look in her eye.
That's not a ladylike look.</i>

255
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:05,375
<i>She is not a lady. She is a contessa.
And she's very rich. Rich.</i>

256
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:09,039
Rich.

257
00:26:11,784 --> 00:26:12,910
Yeah?

258
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:16,651
I own him.

259
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:19,284
We got a contract.

260
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:22,392
You own him?

261
00:26:22,695 --> 00:26:26,028
This magnificently shaped,
perfectly carved...

262
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:29,932
piece of human real estate belongs to you?

263
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:31,497
How much?

264
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:36,372
I mean, can I buy just him,
or do I have to take the whole set?

265
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,973
I want to be formally introduced.

266
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:41,308
Sure, sure.

267
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:44,516
All right, boys, line up. Stand tall.

268
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,814
<i>Let's have a straight line.
Let's look real nice for the lady here.</i>

269
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:51,185
<i>Stand tall now. Let's look wonderful.
This is Biff.</i>

270
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:57,495
This is Rock.

271
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:07,704
This is Tug.

272
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:12,643
This is Riff.

273
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:19,784
This is Hulk.

274
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:24,912
This is Sulk.

275
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:30,388
And this is Clod.

276
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:34,424
Clod.

277
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:42,832
- I made up all those names myself.
- Wonderful. Yourself?

278
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:56,477
<i>- What's his name?
- This? This is Mr. Galaxy.</i>

279
00:27:56,655 --> 00:27:58,122
Flex Martian.

280
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,917
I made up that name, too.

281
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:03,052
I had a feeling that was one of your names.

282
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:08,129
Flex Martian,
this is the Contessa Juliana Giotto-Borgini.

283
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,128
Julie, meet Flex.

284
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:13,863
- Glad to meet you, Flex.
- Nice to meet you, lady.

285
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:16,869
<i>- What's going on?
- Can't you see they want to be alone?</i>

286
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:18,603
<i>But I don't think it's right...</i>

287
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:22,078
You've got to understand,
we have a lot of business to talk about.

288
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:24,206
They just have to do things like that.

289
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:27,150
<i>- You are so strong.
- I'm the strongest.</i>

290
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:32,918
<i>- And so handsome.
- I'm the handsomest.</i>

291
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:37,859
- And so big.
- Yes, ma'am.

292
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:47,594
- I want to be alone with you.
- Did you see this tricep?

293
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:54,278
- I want to take you away with me.
- Look at the way I can make it ripple.

294
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,040
<i>- Right now.
- I haven't had my lunch.</i>

295
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,040
I'll feed you.

296
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,112
Yeah, yeah,
you want him bigger than Mr. Galaxy.

297
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,687
<i>- What's bigger than a galaxy?
- Think of something.</i>

298
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:12,559
Yeah, I'll think of something.

299
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:20,633
- I'll have to show it to my partner.
- What partner?

300
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:25,166
- A silent partner. Mr. Strangdour.
- Mr. Strangdour?

301
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:27,942
Yeah. He bends things.

302
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:32,715
Turn around.

303
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:39,045
- We're taking Flex back for lunch!
- Ta-ta.

304
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:43,289
You gotta bring him back!

305
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:47,888
We'll bring him back soon as
we're through with him, Jack Fanny.

306
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:54,234
<i>There's no room in there for him with us.</i>

307
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:57,002
<i>There's no room in there for him without us.</i>

308
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:59,407
Relax. Flex thinks of everything.

309
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:03,881
- Should've thought of another name for...
- Come on, get in the chopper.

310
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:13,323
- Lift it!
- Lift it.

311
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:59,431
Flex, let go!

312
00:30:59,972 --> 00:31:01,837
<i>Don't go, Flex!</i>

313
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,266
<i>Don't let go, Flex!</i>

314
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:07,338
<i>Don't let go!</i>

315
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,613
Will you beat that?

316
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:12,445
<i>Yes, look at him,
and he doesn't even have wings.</i>

317
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:17,720
Come back!

318
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:27,362
Come back for supper!

319
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:33,632
Have a nice lunch!

320
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,079
I wish I could find a drummer
who could swing like that.

321
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,014
<i>Surf's up!</i>

322
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:25,022
<i>- Surf's up!
- Surf's up!</i>

323
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:44,866
- Frankie, that air.
- Yeah, warm.

324
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:48,065
<i>Warm, like somebody's arms around you.</i>

325
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,307
<i>- You've got a funny face.
- It's the way I comb my hair.</i>

326
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:52,940
Funny mouth.

327
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:57,380
<i>- You're not laughing.
- I don't feel like it.</i>

328
00:33:57,449 --> 00:34:01,442
<i>Come on, honey, everything's going great.
What's the matter now?</i>

329
00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:05,222
<i>- I've been thinking.
- That's a great way to ruin an evening.</i>

330
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,416
<i>That's just it.</i>

331
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:09,619
<i>"Relax. Take it easy.
Let the whole world slide."</i>

332
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:13,520
You've got so much going for you,
and you're just wasting it.

333
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:16,429
<i>- I'm happy, you goof.
- That's not enough.</i>

334
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:21,495
You should be making your life count for
something besides the next big wave.

335
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:24,667
<i>- I don't want to go through that again.
- I do.</i>

336
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:28,368
You're beginning to sound like
something more than just my girl.

337
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:31,210
- Like you want to slip the handcuffs on.
- Like your wife?

338
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:33,717
- You said it, I didn't.
- You always cop out.

339
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:35,776
<i>Sure I cop out. I'm too young to die.</i>

340
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:38,516
<i>I'm talking about a house, not a coffin.</i>

341
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,559
Sure. Time-payment city. Ice boxes and TV.

342
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:44,026
- A family with kids.
- Two-car garage and bills.

343
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:46,928
- Being together.
- Being in hock. Working 8:00 to 5:00.

344
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:49,558
Honey, this beach is free.

345
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:53,263
<i>The sky goes straight on up and your life
is your own. Isn't that enough?</i>

346
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:56,101
- No, it isn't.
- It is for me.

347
00:34:57,209 --> 00:35:00,508
This is the way I want it.
I want it easy, and I want it free.

348
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:03,707
I want it without the ropes,
squares, bills or bombs.

349
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:06,444
<i>This is my world,
because I don't ask anything of it.</i>

350
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:10,579
<i>- That's just it. All you ever do is take.
- I only take what's free.</i>

351
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:14,284
<i>You swing with me on that,
or you don't swing at all.</i>

352
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:20,762
<i>Cool it, Dee Dee. I'm gonna hit the surf.</i>

353
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:32,866
<i>A boy needs a girl</i>

354
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:36,072

00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:45,877
<i>Can't you see?</i>

373
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:50,653
<i>I offer you my heart</i>

00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:19,139
Do you understand all of this?

378
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:22,051
<i>Let's go over the last part again.</i>

379
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:24,152
Very well.

380
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:27,622
<i>"And furthermore,

386
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:48,779
<i>I'm worried about him.
Why ain't he back yet?</i>

387
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:51,577
<i>He'll be back. She's never lost one yet.</i>

388
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,415
All right.

389
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:58,013
- You say I get my name on all the gyms?
- All 273 of them.

390
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:00,683
<i>And the Jack Fanny
"Enriched Whole-Wheat Germ Bread"?</i>

391
00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:03,489
Every slice in the shape of Flex Martian.

392
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:07,460
<i>- I should talk to Mr. Strangdour.
- What's that?</i>

393
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:09,523
I talk to him about everything.

394
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:13,536
- He bends things.
- Mr. Fanny, just sign here, please?

395
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,366
<i>- Let's go over it again.
- Again?</i>

396
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,738
We've already been over it five times.

397
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:18,935
Yeah.

398
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:22,274
But I like the part about the gyms
with my name.

399
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:27,646
Very well. Just once more.

400
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:30,914
<i>"And furthermore,

401
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:42,990
- Okay, big boy, you're home.
- Sorry about that.

402
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:46,332
<i>I know it's early, but I've already missed
my wheat germ once today.</i>

403
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:48,133
I understand, Flex.

404
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,571
Wheat germ helps to make the muscles hard.

405
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:53,236
Did you happen to notice
my rhomboideus majors?

406
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:54,835
How could I have missed it?

407
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:57,541
- Wheat germ.
- Good old wheat germ.

408
00:38:57,615 --> 00:38:59,708
I'll fix him up for you in the morning.

409
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:02,048
Flex, where you been?

410
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,089

beddy-bye an hour ago.</i>

- I was with her.

412
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:09,892
- They were with each other. Understand?
- I can spell.

413
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:13,727
<i>Flex, go inside.
There's some hot mush on the table for you.</i>

414
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:18,362
- Good night, Julie.
- Get the hot mush, boy. Mush, big boy.

415
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,661
<i>- He hasn't signed the papers yet.
- What happened?</i>

416
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:26,039
- He reads kinda funny.
- We have a language barrier. English.

417
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:27,744
I think I'll take a walk.

418
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:30,576
Yes, do that. We're gonna hammer out
some things anyway.

Hi.

456
00:43:27,085 --> 00:43:29,519
Mind if I share your beach?

457
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:31,386
Be my guest.

458
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:36,450

00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:52,909
water and sky always look the same.

463
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:55,468
Big and sad when the moon comes up.

464
00:43:57,815 --> 00:44:00,375
<i>- What's your name?
- Frankie.</i>

465
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:04,052
<i>- You're cute.
- It's the way I comb my hair.</i>

466
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:06,950
My name is Julie.

467
00:44:08,893 --> 00:44:12,556
You know, when you sang,
it gave me a very funny feeling.

468
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:20,099
<i>Julie's a nice name.</i>

469
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:22,234
<i>It's really Juliana.</i>

470
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:25,875
<i>That's a nice name, too.</i>

471
00:44:26,644 --> 00:44:28,168
You move fast.

472
00:44:28,613 --> 00:44:30,376
- Do you mind?
- Yeah!

473
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:34,280
When there are moves to be made,
I want to make them.

474
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:36,149
<i>I don't like to wait.</i>

475
00:44:36,788 --> 00:44:38,517
I had that feeling.

476
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,116
You know,
you're not like anyone I've ever met.

477
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:43,922
Maybe you're lucky.

478
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:46,122
<i>I don't think so.</i>

479
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:01,207
Hi, Dee Dee. You remember...

480
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:05,113
<i>- Her name's Julie.
- I remember her, the bride of Godzilla.</i>

481
00:45:05,183 --> 00:45:08,949
- Wait a second, Dee Dee...
- Did you run out of musclemen?

482
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,615
<i>No. It's just that he looked so sad,
like a lost puppy.</i>

483
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,681
<i>Maybe you didn't notice his license.</i>

484
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:17,227
<i>- I didn't even notice his leash.
- Wait a second...</i>

485
00:45:17,295 --> 00:45:19,195
- Perhaps I should leave.
- No, wait.

486
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,697
This is a public beach.
Dee Dee, calm down...

487
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:24,428
<i>One question,
did you kiss him 'cause he's lovable...</i>

488
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,732
<i>or because he's the only man on the beach?</i>

489
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:31,366
<i>Because he looked hungry.
His last meal obviously didn't satisfy him.</i>

490
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,807
<i>It's a good thing you happened along.</i>

491
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:36,676
<i>I'm sure you could cater supper
for an entire army.</i>

492
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:38,339
<i>Now that's in bad taste.</i>

493
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:41,943
No, one man at a time.
I like to be a devoted chef.

494
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:46,080
Right now you're serving a lot of free meals,
sort of a one-woman bread line.

495
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:48,455
- That smarts.
- I can afford it.

496
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:50,551
Then he must be a charity case.

497
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:53,461
Wait a second,
the football would like to say something.

498
00:45:53,531 --> 00:45:55,260
<i>- I'm not through.
- Figures.</i>

499
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:58,791
As he said, this is a public beach,
and we're supposed to keep it clean.

500
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:02,533
<i>- That's really in bad taste.
- Then perhaps you'd better leave.</i>

501
00:46:02,607 --> 00:46:04,268
- Very good.
- I plan to.

502
00:46:04,342 --> 00:46:06,640
<i>Don't quit now, Dee Dee.
I think you're ahead.</i>

503
00:46:06,711 --> 00:46:08,941
<i>Okay, how's this for a closer?</i>

504
00:46:12,717 --> 00:46:14,184
Does it hurt?

505
00:46:14,685 --> 00:46:15,811
Yeah.

506
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:18,214
I am sorry I said those things to her.

507
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:21,588
<i>I'm sorry she started it.
She really didn't mean to.</i>

508
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:29,856
- Now where are you going?
- I have a lot of arrangements to make.

509
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:34,295
- I think I will be in love with someone.
- And you have to arrange that?

510
00:46:34,372 --> 00:46:37,773
Yes, especially if that someone
is going to be you.

511
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,110
<i>I don't deserve such happiness.</i>

512
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:49,016
- You got it?
- I got it.

513
00:46:49,153 --> 00:46:52,589
But Flex has got to win something
bigger than Mr. Galaxy.

514
00:46:52,657 --> 00:46:54,056
That, or no deal.

515
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,457
<i>He'll win. I don't know what, but he'll win.</i>

516
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:59,621
- How can you be sure?
- The Contessa will be the judge.

517
00:46:59,697 --> 00:47:01,562
<i>He'll win because he's strong.</i>

518
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:04,328
<i>That's right. Go ahead, just sign here.</i>

519
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:10,136
<i>Tonight you'll have a good night's sleep.</i>

520
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:13,474
<i>- I ain't tired.
- Lift something heavy.</i>

521
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:17,241
<i>Jack, it's a pleasure to do business
with a Fanny like you.</i>

522
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,382
S. Z?

523
00:47:31,062 --> 00:47:32,256
I am in love.

524
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,855
I know, I just made the deal.
We own seven King Kongs.

525
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:37,901
<i>I don't want them now.
Couldn't you sell them to a zoo?</i>

526
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:39,766
<i>You don't want them now?</i>

527
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:41,600
What have you been up to?

528
00:47:41,672 --> 00:47:43,867
- I met a boy.
- You met a boy?

529
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:47,342
She met a boy, on a deserted beach,
in the middle of the night.

530
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:49,902
<i>- You've got a talent.
- He's handsome and young.</i>

531
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:53,109
- And he sings like an angel.
- A choirboy? She met a choirboy.

532
00:47:53,184 --> 00:47:55,414
<i>No, silly, he's all grown up. Let's go.</i>

533
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:58,546
- We have to make all-new plans.
- But, S.Z., what about them?

534
00:47:58,622 --> 00:48:00,385
Those supermen?

535
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:01,925
We've got signed contracts.

536
00:48:01,993 --> 00:48:04,018
<i>- Who cares?
- It's expensive.</i>

537
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,791
<i>I've found someone to love.
Isn't that what you wanted?</i>

538
00:48:06,864 --> 00:48:11,460
<i>I have a feeling it's another of those
"love now, pay later" plans.</i>

539
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:16,838
Theodore, you handle the muscle bunch.

540
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:19,740
Work on them.
Maybe you can save something.

541
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,870
- You never let me down.
- Hope no one ever does.

542
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:24,905
- But...
- No buts!

543
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,093
Hello, lgor?

544
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:13,855
Is Mr. Strangdour there?

545
00:49:22,907 --> 00:49:24,431
<i>Mr. Strangdour?</i>

546
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,935
<i>It's like I said, gyms all over the country...</i>

547
00:49:28,746 --> 00:49:32,204
our own bread, a TV series, with her money.

548
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:37,917
You like that, Mr. Strangdour?
We'll make millions.

549
00:49:41,092 --> 00:49:44,357
<i>But what's more important,
we can give the whole world the word!</i>

550
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,988
<i>Strength, Mr. Strangdour!</i>

551
00:49:47,064 --> 00:49:49,328
<i>Everybody will think "strength."</i>

552
00:49:54,105 --> 00:49:56,403
Not only that, but with Flex...

553
00:49:56,674 --> 00:49:59,336
they promised to make him
bigger than Mr. Galaxy.

554
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,310
<i>Bigger, Mr. Strangdour.</i>

555
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:19,863
Okay, good talking to you, Mr. Strangdour.

556
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:26,829
<i>Hey, that's them.</i>

557
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:32,331
Look smart. Okay, stand up tall, men.
Come on.

558
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:36,778
<i>Taller! Stand smart, stand tall.
That's what I want.</i>

559
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:50,424
Hi! Hey, here we are! Where are you going?

560
00:50:55,766 --> 00:50:57,324
Here we are.

561
00:50:57,401 --> 00:50:58,925
Hi, Jack Fanny.

562
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:01,862
Gosh sakes.

563
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,602
<i>Why are they going to the kid's house?</i>

564
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,774
How do I know?
Maybe they got lost or something.

565
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:24,285
There they are. Okay, get ready. Stand tall.

566
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:25,385
Hi!

567
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,028
Over here. Flex!

568
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,260
You guys, back in the house!

569
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:36,566
<i>Hi! Guess you didn't see us over there.
Mr. Strangdour said the deal is set.</i>

570
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,301
- Right.
- Then we can start.

571
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,309
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

572
00:51:40,945 --> 00:51:43,641
You promised to make me
a Mister something, right away.

573
00:51:43,714 --> 00:51:45,011
We're working on it.

574
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:47,573
<i>Julie, what about me?
You haven't said a word to me.</i>

575
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:50,017
Julie, say something to this mountain,
will you?

576
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:53,614
I only have one thing to say to you, Flex.
I'll never forget you.

577
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:56,023
How do you like that?
She'll never forget you.

578
00:51:56,093 --> 00:51:57,583
<i>Wilbur, Cappy's Place.</i>

579
00:51:57,661 --> 00:51:59,629
Let go!

580
00:52:03,234 --> 00:52:06,499
- I think something happened.
- I want my Julie back.

581
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:10,333
<i>Forget about her, Flex.
We've got our deal. Isn't that enough?</i>

582
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:11,396
No.

583
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:15,168
<i>I'm the only man good enough for her!</i>

584
00:52:15,246 --> 00:52:17,680
<i>If I don't get her, I'll do something vicious.</i>

585
00:52:17,748 --> 00:52:20,080
You'll get her back!

586
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,812
Jack Fanny will get to the bottom of this.

587
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:24,945
Put me down, before I get a nosebleed.

588
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:27,582
<i>You know I'm a bleeder. Put me down!</i>

589
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:30,557
<i>Hear ye, hear ye, water babies.</i>

590
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:34,762
<i>Now, what you've been waiting for.
Listen, while I hover above you.</i>

591
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:38,393
<i>The king of the surf guitar,
Dick Dale and the Del Tones.</i>

592
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:06,691
<i>You can have your girls
and silly romances, now</i>

593
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:10,164
<i>On a wave is where I'll take my chance, now</i>

594
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:13,498
<i>When the surf is breakin',
you know I'm ready, girl</i>

595
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,767
<i>Got no eyes for chicks
and time for a steady girl</i>

596
00:53:16,874 --> 00:53:19,604
<i>While the other guys talk to the chicks</i>

597
00:53:20,144 --> 00:53:22,908
<i>I'm at the beach now, gonna get my kicks</i>

598
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,313
<i>I know a gal who'd make a real great wife</i>

599
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:27,914
Guess who?

600
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:30,649
- Bluebeard!
- Wrong.

601
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:33,989
- King Henry the Eighth.
- Closer.

602
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,823
- I was right the first time.
- Dee Dee.

603
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:42,989
<i>What's the matter?
Too much pizza give you heartburn?</i>

604
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:46,093
<i>- Don't they ever stop?
- Let's start, come on.</i>

605
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:49,469
<i>- Come on, Dee Dee, don't be like that.
- Why shouldn't I still be mad?</i>

606
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:53,135
<i>Because you're wrong,
and it's not polite to hold a grudge.</i>

607
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:55,508
I'll hold it as long as I want.

608
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:57,308
<i>Wouldn't you rather dance?</i>

609
00:53:57,381 --> 00:54:00,009
Besides, a boy needs a girl he can count on.

610
00:54:00,084 --> 00:54:03,611
<i>That's our trouble.
It's supposed to work the other way, too.</i>

611
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:07,214
<i>Everyone says that there's
a love for me, now</i>

612
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:12,251
<i>A boy needs a girl he can count on</i>

613
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:17,957
<i>A boy needs a girl he can love</i>

614
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:36,142
You know, if there was no music here,
this place would be raided.

615
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:42,483
There he is, the one with the pretty brunette.

616
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,356
<i>You mean, he's the one?</i>

617
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:50,529
- I sure hope he sings better than he dances.
- Wait until you hear him.

618
00:54:56,407 --> 00:54:58,967
<i>All right, you squares, take a seat.</i>

619
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:02,068
What? Who said that? Where...

620
00:55:02,146 --> 00:55:04,137
<i>Me, I said that. Up here.</i>

621
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:08,707
<i>- What is that?
- I don't know, but I'm glad it's in a cage.</i>

622
00:55:08,786 --> 00:55:10,879
<i>Wait a second, I'll come right down.</i>

623
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:14,412
<i>I don't get a chance
to talk to real people very often.</i>

624
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:24,225
<i>Be careful, he's going to reach out.</i>

625
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,826
<i>It's me, Cappy. I own this joint.</i>

626
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,334
What're they doing with that box?
Is it a bomb?

627
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:36,209
<i>Relax, it's recording equipment.
We want to make a recording.</i>

628
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,312
$100, $150...

629
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:43,715
$200. What kind of recording?

630
00:55:43,854 --> 00:55:46,118
A recording of him.

631
00:55:46,457 --> 00:55:49,824
- Who him?
- Him, that wild waltzer.

632
00:55:51,762 --> 00:55:54,094
You mean Frankie the Mouth?

633
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:56,326
Is that how they call him?

634
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,767
<i>That's what I call him.
I don't listen to anything that goes on here.</i>

635
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:01,964
I'll show you how I work it.

636
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:10,678
Peace, quiet, heaven, bliss.

637
00:56:10,814 --> 00:56:13,374
<i>Cappy, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.</i>

638
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,677
Silence, beautiful silence!

639
00:56:17,982 --> 00:56:20,951
Do you know what this place is?
This is a nuthouse.

640
00:56:21,018 --> 00:56:24,647
<i>And do you know who's running it?
The nuts are running it.</i>

641
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:26,382
<i>I think it's fun.</i>

642
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:36,489
What was that?

643
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:30,687
<i>I'm seeing it, and I'm feeling it,
but I don't believe it.</i>

644
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:32,919
Do you feel anything?

645
00:57:33,424 --> 00:57:35,358
I think it only works on men.

646
00:57:35,426 --> 00:57:37,451
<i>That's just impossible.</i>

647
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:45,528
Any questions now?

648
00:57:46,203 --> 00:57:47,227
No.

649
00:57:47,304 --> 00:57:51,400
<i>That chick's really got the power.
Probably related to the fourth dimension.</i>

650
00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:54,308
<i>She looks like
she's moving somewhere else.</i>

651
00:57:54,445 --> 00:57:56,811
What were you saying
before she flattened you?

652
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,474
How come you're in there protected...

653
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:02,110
<i>and I'm out here getting bumped off?</i>

654
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,879
- Sanctuary.
- Sanctuary?

655
00:58:04,955 --> 00:58:07,947
Sanctuary from them.
I had to build this to protect myself.

656
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:11,688
<i>I used to have a beautiful Cappy's Place,
even better than this.</i>

657
00:58:11,762 --> 00:58:14,663
And they completely demolished it,
and nearly me with it...

658
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:17,326
and on account of a stranger, like you.

659
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:21,404
You're not an anthropologist
or explorer or something, are you?

660
00:58:21,472 --> 00:58:24,305
<i>- Sex maniac, maybe?
- I don't have any hobbies.</i>

661
00:58:24,808 --> 00:58:27,106
<i>I can't take any chances.</i>

662
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:34,117
<i>I'm telling you, Julie, this is a nuthouse...</i>

663
00:58:34,184 --> 00:58:36,482
<i>and that's the head nut, up there.</i>

664
00:58:36,553 --> 00:58:41,183
<i>- I'm getting out of here.
- Not yet, S.Z., definitely not yet.</i>

665
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,835
<i>Uh-oh, the Mafia's back.</i>

666
00:58:52,903 --> 00:58:55,269
<i>Don't start. Julie, what are you doing here?</i>

667
00:58:55,339 --> 00:58:57,569
<i>I'm here because I want to hear you sing.</i>

668
00:58:57,641 --> 00:58:59,506
Sure, Caruso, go ahead and sing.

669
00:58:59,576 --> 00:59:01,908
Wait a second, Dee Dee.

670
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:03,771
Thanks a lot.

671
00:59:03,847 --> 00:59:07,305
- Frankie, I really did come to hear you sing.
- Yeah, but...

672
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,851
Thank you.

673
00:59:12,222 --> 00:59:13,553
All right.

674
00:59:17,694 --> 00:59:19,184
- Dick?
- Yeah, Frank?

675
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:21,060
- Hit it.
- Start it up.

676
00:59:24,735 --> 00:59:28,068
<i>If you really want to swing,
Cappy's is the place to go</i>

677
00:59:28,138 --> 00:59:30,129
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

678
00:59:30,207 --> 00:59:33,301
<i>The band's working out,
and the sax man's starting to blow</i>

679
00:59:33,377 --> 00:59:35,242
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

680
00:59:35,312 --> 00:59:38,577
<i>So come on, little girl,
let's really put on a show</i>

681
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:40,480
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

682
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:43,748
<i>Yeah, the kid's are clapping
while the guitar's wailing away</i>

683
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:45,948
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

684
00:59:46,023 --> 00:59:49,049
<i>They're movin' and groovin'
and yellin' for what I say</i>

685
00:59:49,126 --> 00:59:50,957
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

686
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:54,327
<i>Yeah, we can't stop now,
gonna go till the break of day</i>

687
00:59:54,398 --> 00:59:56,866
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

688
00:59:57,868 --> 00:59:59,529
<i>Aw, runnin' wild</i>

689
00:59:59,603 --> 01:00:02,094
<i>Everybody's gotta grab a chick now</i>

690
01:00:02,172 --> 01:00:04,800
<i>Yeah, runnin' wild</i>

691
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:06,536
<i>Everybody's gonna get their kicks now</i>

692
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:10,011
<i>Well, we can't stop now,
gonna go till the break of day</i>

693
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,514
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

694
01:00:43,313 --> 01:00:46,180
<i>Let's get together,
'cause that's the way I want it to be</i>

695
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,411
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

696
01:00:48,485 --> 01:00:51,454
<i>The more we dance, now,
the better you look to me</i>

697
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,353
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

698
01:00:53,423 --> 01:00:56,620
<i>When the party's over,
there's a place I want you to see</i>

699
01:00:56,693 --> 01:00:58,524
<i>Run, run, everybody's runnin' wild</i>

700
01:00:58,595 --> 01:00:59,960
<i>Well, wild</i>

701
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:02,125
<i>Yeah, runnin' wild</i>

702
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:04,900
<i>Yeah, man, runnin' wild</i>

703
01:01:05,269 --> 01:01:06,964
<i>Yeah, runnin' wild</i>

704
01:01:07,037 --> 01:01:09,665
<i>Everybody's gonna get their kicks now</i>

705
01:01:19,616 --> 01:01:22,744
- Frankie, you were marvelous.
- Thank you, Julie.

706
01:01:22,819 --> 01:01:25,310
Darling, I have a surprise for you.

707
01:01:26,957 --> 01:01:29,289
- See those men over there?
- Yeah.

708
01:01:29,526 --> 01:01:32,723
Your song is down on tape.
We're going to make a record of it.

709
01:01:32,796 --> 01:01:35,492
A million copies, all on your own label.

710
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,091
We'll give you to the world.
You'll be a sensation.

711
01:01:38,168 --> 01:01:42,628
With my money and your talent,
you'll be a star, you're going to be famous!

712
01:01:42,706 --> 01:01:44,173
That does it!

713
01:01:50,681 --> 01:01:53,047
You listen to me, Miss Moneybags.

714
01:01:53,116 --> 01:01:57,052
<i>If you think I'm putting up with this,
you'd better wipe your fuzzy brain clean.</i>

715
01:01:57,754 --> 01:02:00,780
You start peddling your pasta
somewhere else right now...

716
01:02:00,857 --> 01:02:03,348
because if you don't,
I'll send you into orbit...

717
01:02:03,427 --> 01:02:07,329
<i>with a blastoff that will make
Friendship 7 look like a wet firecracker!</i>

718
01:02:07,397 --> 01:02:11,333
Dee Dee, do something about your temper.
Have you tried Miltown?

719
01:02:11,401 --> 01:02:14,598
- Julie, baby!
- Flex!

720
01:02:14,671 --> 01:02:17,765
<i>- What's going on around here?
- Yeah, what's going on?</i>

721
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:19,172
I want to talk to you.

722
01:02:19,243 --> 01:02:21,108
- Please, let me down!
- But, Julie...

723
01:02:21,178 --> 01:02:23,339
<i>We've got a contract. You ain't quitting.</i>

724
01:02:23,413 --> 01:02:27,679
<i>- I'm not, I'll give you everything I promised.
- But it's more than that.</i>

725
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:30,015
<i>She's hurt Flex's feelings.</i>

726
01:02:30,087 --> 01:02:32,988
<i>Oh, she's mean.</i>

727
01:02:33,056 --> 01:02:38,050
<i>It's not that I don't like muscles anymore.
But I've found something more exciting.</i>

728
01:02:38,695 --> 01:02:39,719
Him.

729
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:43,492
You mean, that little thing?

730
01:02:44,101 --> 01:02:46,092
You heard her, Gargantua.

731
01:02:48,138 --> 01:02:50,766
You mean, you would trade Gargantua...

732
01:02:51,675 --> 01:02:54,007
I mean, Mr. Galaxy...

733
01:02:54,911 --> 01:02:57,709
for that undernourished mouse?

734
01:02:57,781 --> 01:03:00,079
- Would you?
- I sure would.

735
01:03:00,584 --> 01:03:02,017
How about that?

736
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:03,552
Yeah, how about that?

737
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,919
<i>You think we ain't got dignity,
we ain't got honor?</i>

738
01:03:07,357 --> 01:03:10,849
<i>Flex, for that mouse?
We ain't standing for it.</i>

739
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:13,656
And that can mean only one thing. War!

740
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,300
- War!
- No.

741
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:22,304
Okay, fellas.
Come on, we're ready, come on.

742
01:03:24,107 --> 01:03:26,473
<i>- Let's get out of here.
- Come on!</i>

743
01:03:31,181 --> 01:03:32,978
War!

744
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,950
Fellas, everybody!

745
01:03:35,018 --> 01:03:36,349
<i>Surf's up!</i>

746
01:03:47,731 --> 01:03:49,961
Get those guys. What are you waiting for?

747
01:03:50,033 --> 01:03:53,196
<i>Lover boy, let's see you get out of this one.</i>

748
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:55,238
<i>He's all mine.</i>

749
01:04:13,623 --> 01:04:15,386
<i>- No.
- Surf's up.</i>

750
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:28,997
You were wonderful.
You sang, and I felt something right here.

751
01:05:29,065 --> 01:05:31,124
- Do you really mean it?
- Of course I do.

752
01:05:31,201 --> 01:05:35,797
- No, I mean about the records and all that.
- I mean everything I say to you.

753
01:05:37,707 --> 01:05:41,108
<i>Julie, I don't know if I want that.</i>

754
01:05:41,178 --> 01:05:44,341
I mean,
I've got everything going for me right here.

755
01:05:44,414 --> 01:05:47,144
I've got the surf, the sky and the beach.

756
01:05:47,217 --> 01:05:50,675
But, Frankie, there is that and much more.
There is me.

757
01:05:52,722 --> 01:05:55,953
Julie, you know, you're beautiful.

758
01:05:56,393 --> 01:05:57,917
You really are.

759
01:05:58,261 --> 01:06:00,627
Where do you go on that big boat?

760
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:03,427
- Anywhere you like.
- The Islands, Makaha?

761
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,161
Makaha, Tahiti, straight across to Australia.

762
01:06:07,637 --> 01:06:09,832
I hear it rolls in Australia.

763
01:06:09,906 --> 01:06:13,307
The surf comes in for miles
off the Barrier Reef.

764
01:06:14,077 --> 01:06:17,843
The riders look like gulls
skimming the crests of the waves.

765
01:06:19,049 --> 01:06:21,449
<i>We'd be good for each other.</i>

766
01:06:21,518 --> 01:06:22,849
Would we?

767
01:06:23,553 --> 01:06:27,512
I can show you so much.
I can open the world for you.

768
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:31,817
You'll see Tangiers in October,
we'll cruise the Greek islands in summer...

769
01:06:31,895 --> 01:06:34,762
and Paris,
when the streets are wet with rain.

770
01:06:34,831 --> 01:06:38,130
<i>- It's an 80-foot wave.
- It's even higher than that.</i>

771
01:06:38,735 --> 01:06:40,566
How far does it ride?

772
01:06:40,837 --> 01:06:42,566
As far as you want.

773
01:06:43,373 --> 01:06:45,034
As far as I want.

774
01:06:51,915 --> 01:06:54,281
<i>Come along with me,
and we'll all have some fun</i>

775
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:57,013
<i>To a swingin' little beach off the 101</i>

776
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,055
<i>There's a new dance craze
that they're gonna teach</i>

777
01:07:00,123 --> 01:07:02,956
<i>The only place you'll learn it
is down at Muscle Beach</i>

778
01:07:03,026 --> 01:07:05,551
<i>Flex up your biceps, and that's how it goes</i>

779
01:07:05,629 --> 01:07:08,530
<i>Turn your head, and strike up a pose</i>

780
01:07:08,598 --> 01:07:11,089
<i>Do the Mashed Potatoes,
and you stick out your chest</i>

781
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:14,762
<i>The guys are lookin' good,
but the girls are lookin' best</i>

782
01:07:15,205 --> 01:07:17,230
<i>Everybody do it now</i>

783
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:19,770
<i>Oh, a little muscle now</i>

784
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:22,234
<i>Everybody kick the sand</i>

785
01:07:22,312 --> 01:07:25,748
<i>Come on, now, just like a muscle man</i>

786
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:36,651
Good heavens!
Where are the mothers of America?

787
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:43,795
<i>It's the latest dance that's goin' round</i>

788
01:07:43,867 --> 01:07:46,631
<i>And if you can't cut it, you're muscle-bound</i>

789
01:07:46,703 --> 01:07:49,228
<i>Do the scruffle-shuffle, and kick up the sand</i>

790
01:07:49,306 --> 01:07:52,070
<i>Pick up your chick,
and you're a huckle-buckle man</i>

791
01:07:52,142 --> 01:07:54,576
<i>Flex up your biceps, and that's how it goes</i>

792
01:07:54,644 --> 01:07:57,408
<i>You turn your head,
and you strike up a pose</i>

793
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,971
<i>Do the Mashed Potatoes,
and you stick out your chest</i>

794
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:03,645
<i>The guys are lookin' good,
but the girls are lookin' best</i>

795
01:08:04,087 --> 01:08:05,850
<i>Everybody do it now</i>

796
01:08:06,756 --> 01:08:08,553
<i>Oh, a little muscle now</i>

797
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:10,286
Look what they're doing now.

798
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,091
<i>- They're doing exercises.
- They ain't doing them good.</i>

799
01:08:19,302 --> 01:08:21,930
Exercises? My Trapezius!

800
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:25,340
Do you know what they're doing?
They're making fun of us.

801
01:08:25,408 --> 01:08:27,740
<i>That's it, that's the last straw.</i>

802
01:08:30,113 --> 01:08:31,808
Inside!

803
01:08:33,883 --> 01:08:35,817
<i>Everybody kick the sand</i>

804
01:08:41,358 --> 01:08:44,259
Lift something heavy. It helps me to think.

805
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:47,726
Crush them. Not one of them,
not two of them, but all of them.

806
01:08:47,797 --> 01:08:52,234
Crush them in our mighty fists.
Break them into shattered little pieces.

807
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:55,271
Twist them like a wet bathing suit,
till they cry for mercy.

808
01:08:55,338 --> 01:09:00,139
- And then what?
- Break their bones, one by one, snap.

809
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:04,169
Crush their feet, gouge their eyes,
wring their necks.

810
01:09:04,247 --> 01:09:08,183
Pull their hair, bite them,
break their glasses and everything!

811
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,448
Come in!

812
01:09:12,555 --> 01:09:14,580
Good evening, gentlemen...

813
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:17,259
and accessories.

814
01:09:17,594 --> 01:09:20,688
- I think we have some unfinished business.
- You!

815
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:24,889
- Now, Mr. Fanny?
- Now? What, am I interrupting something?

816
01:09:24,968 --> 01:09:28,529
No, you're just the man I want to see.

817
01:09:28,605 --> 01:09:30,402
Clod, put that thing down.

818
01:09:30,473 --> 01:09:32,441
- Down?
- Yeah, on him.

819
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:37,610
<i>You can't do this!</i>

820
01:09:37,814 --> 01:09:42,751
<i>My little surfin' woody
is the cleanest on the street</i>

821
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:45,849
<i>With a fuel-injected Chrysler</i>

822
01:09:45,922 --> 01:09:48,322
<i>now she's really hard to beat</i>

823
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:56,030
<i>Surfin', surfin', woody</i>

824
01:09:57,233 --> 01:10:02,102
<i>Those big old JE pistons
with that brand-new Vertex mag</i>

825
01:10:02,172 --> 01:10:04,697
Hold it.

826
01:10:04,774 --> 01:10:07,436
<i>- Lover boy's back.
- Hi, Frankie.</i>

827
01:10:09,112 --> 01:10:11,637
Would you believe it?
One little record, and wham!

828
01:10:11,715 --> 01:10:13,842
<i>Yeah, we heard it before. It's not bad.</i>

829
01:10:13,917 --> 01:10:17,045
<i>Not bad? It's great! I'm cutting everybody in.</i>

830
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,384
I can see it. This summer we hit Makaha...

831
01:10:19,456 --> 01:10:22,823
<i>straight down the Bonzai Line,
and it's all on me.</i>

832
01:10:24,027 --> 01:10:27,463
Sounds great. I know your first one
will be a record breaker, man.

833
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,225
We might as well start now.

834
01:10:29,299 --> 01:10:33,030
<i>Don't break mine.
I want to use mine for a skim board.</i>

835
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,594
All right, now, hold it.
Come on, knock it off!

836
01:10:35,672 --> 01:10:37,799
This is going a little too far.

837
01:10:37,874 --> 01:10:41,139
<i>- What's the matter?
- You want to say something, just say it.</i>

838
01:10:41,211 --> 01:10:44,612
Okay, you tell the Contessa
that we said thanks, but no thanks.

839
01:10:44,681 --> 01:10:47,115
- You and that piece of pizza.
- Cool it, Animal.

840
01:10:47,183 --> 01:10:49,344
- We've been thinking...
- Sounds like it.

841
01:10:49,419 --> 01:10:51,649
Whose brains you been using,
Flex Martian's?

842
01:10:51,721 --> 01:10:53,518
- No, mine.
- Figures.

843
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:56,684
Cut it. You better listen to me,
and listen good.

844
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,285
<i>You wanna play big time, okay.
But don't pull us in.</i>

845
01:10:59,362 --> 01:11:01,557
<i>Don't do us favors. Those waves are too big.</i>

846
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:04,122
You get wiped out.
You swallow a lot of salt water.

847
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,135
Not me, Johnny.
I can ride it on top the whole way.

848
01:11:07,203 --> 01:11:10,138
<i>That's cool. But count us out.
You ride it alone.</i>

849
01:11:10,206 --> 01:11:12,299
<i>Solid-gold surfboards don't float well.</i>

850
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:15,776
<i>- Come on, let's split down to Cappy's.
- Yeah.</i>

851
01:11:26,189 --> 01:11:29,215
<i>Frank, I'm sorry, man, but I had to.</i>

852
01:11:30,727 --> 01:11:31,819
Sure.

853
01:11:32,395 --> 01:11:34,386
<i>- Johnny, we...
- It's okay.</i>

854
01:11:34,464 --> 01:11:36,659
<i>Good luck with la dolce vita.</i>

855
01:11:45,742 --> 01:11:48,643
<i>Frankie's down on the beach.
You probably missed him.</i>

856
01:11:48,711 --> 01:11:51,578
<i>It's around the bend,
near the rocks down there.</i>

857
01:11:51,648 --> 01:11:55,778
- Then what are you doing up here?
- I've had enough of moonlit beaches.

858
01:11:55,852 --> 01:11:58,150
<i>You don't sound as if you care.</i>

859
01:11:58,555 --> 01:12:01,649
If I sounded like I cared,
would it change anything?

860
01:12:01,724 --> 01:12:03,487
<i>Then you won't mind?</i>

861
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,925
- Mind what?
- Frankie and I are going away together.

862
01:12:07,797 --> 01:12:09,059
You are?

863
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,494
Yes, tonight.

864
01:12:12,802 --> 01:12:14,064
Tonight?

865
01:12:15,405 --> 01:12:16,394
<i>Ciao.</i>

866
01:12:16,973 --> 01:12:18,565
You are not mad?

867
01:12:19,676 --> 01:12:20,768
Mad?

868
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:24,474
<i>You just don't have any idea how mad I am.</i>

869
01:12:24,848 --> 01:12:27,578
But, more than anything,
I want Frankie to be happy...

870
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:30,744
and if this is what he wants,
this is what he can have.

871
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,617
Okay, swell. Goodbye.

872
01:12:41,664 --> 01:12:44,098
<i>That Frankie's a nice kid...</i>

873
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:47,261
and he had a nice girl, too,
until you bit him.

874
01:12:47,837 --> 01:12:49,429
<i>That wasn't nice.</i>

875
01:12:49,873 --> 01:12:51,340
And what am I, S. Z?

876
01:12:51,407 --> 01:12:54,035
<i>Just because I have too much money,
I can't be nice?</i>

877
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:57,511
<i>I can't love a nice boy?
I can't have what they have?</i>

878
01:12:58,448 --> 01:13:00,382
<i>There's a difference, Julie.</i>

879
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:02,475
<i>There's people for people.</i>

880
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:06,814
<i>- You don't fit with that kid, that's all.
- I could learn.</i>

881
01:13:07,123 --> 01:13:09,182
<i>No, but you'd make him learn.</i>

882
01:13:14,163 --> 01:13:16,495
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, darling.

883
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,997
- Hi, S.Z.
- Hi, baby!

884
01:13:19,068 --> 01:13:21,434
<i>- Are you ready?
- I'm always ready.</i>

885
01:13:21,504 --> 01:13:24,701
Then hurry.
I've such a marvelous trip planned.

886
01:13:24,774 --> 01:13:28,801
- I wanna tell you all about it, too.
- I've heard already, S.Z.

887
01:13:28,878 --> 01:13:32,075
<i>Yeah, but I wanna tell you what it's like,
life with la Contessa.</i>

888
01:13:32,148 --> 01:13:36,517
I got lots of work to do. I manage her estate,
take care of the hotels and things.

889
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:40,317
- But you're really gonna have the life, right?
- Right.

890
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:43,120
Just picture it.
Sitting on the boat, having a drink...

891
01:13:43,192 --> 01:13:46,320
- getting a suntan, you laugh a little.
- Sounds great.

892
01:13:46,396 --> 01:13:49,923
<i>And at night, it's just you and Julie,
alone under the stars.</i>

893
01:13:49,999 --> 01:13:52,467
Unless, if you go to the gambling casino.

894
01:13:52,535 --> 01:13:53,832
Frank, how about that?

895
01:13:58,474 --> 01:14:01,671
<i>- You like to gamble?
- I don't have much, but I wouldn't mind.</i>

896
01:14:01,744 --> 01:14:05,009
<i>But Julie's got lots of money.
You wouldn't mind gambling with that.</i>

897
01:14:05,081 --> 01:14:06,878
She'll let you keep the winnings.

898
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:09,350
- Yes, but...
- And she'll buy you clothes.

899
01:14:09,419 --> 01:14:11,751
- Anything you want.
- Maybe a sports car, even.

900
01:14:11,821 --> 01:14:14,654
- I thought I was supposed to sing.
- Yes, darling, you are.

901
01:14:14,724 --> 01:14:17,818
Julie, we'll buy him a nightclub.
How about that?

902
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:22,297
And we hire people, we pay them to come in
and sit down and to applaud.

903
01:14:23,099 --> 01:14:26,500
<i>Wait a second.
You're saying I'm gonna live off Julie.</i>

904
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:29,861
<i>Darling, don't listen to him.
That's the wrong way to put it.</i>

905
01:14:29,939 --> 01:14:31,372
Let me put it this way.

906
01:14:31,441 --> 01:14:34,933
You're a bird in a gilded cage,
she lets you out occasionally...

907
01:14:35,011 --> 01:14:38,071
<i>and the two of you read
the Wall Street Journal together.</i>

908
01:14:38,448 --> 01:14:41,849
<i>- Isn't that a pretty picture?
- No, I don't think it is.</i>

909
01:14:41,918 --> 01:14:44,716
<i>Darling, please don't listen to him.
It's not that way.</i>

910
01:14:44,787 --> 01:14:48,279
<i>What it's going to be,
you're going to be my protg.</i>

911
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:51,953
Yeah, like she had four painters,
and she had two musicians...

912
01:14:52,028 --> 01:14:55,862
and the Spanish dancer, a flamenco guy
that screwed himself into the ground.

913
01:14:55,932 --> 01:14:58,400
And the bullfighter she picked up in Spain...

914
01:14:58,468 --> 01:15:01,631
a guy with a sword,
until the bull caught him with a horn.

915
01:15:01,704 --> 01:15:05,435
Then there was a guy
with a chisel and a hammer, a sculptor.

916
01:15:05,508 --> 01:15:09,535
He filled up the ship with marble,
and we nearly sunk off Africa or someplace.

917
01:15:09,612 --> 01:15:13,571
She called them all protgs.
Know what I call them? Puppy dogs!

918
01:15:13,983 --> 01:15:15,780
<i>S.Z., that's enough.</i>

919
01:15:25,161 --> 01:15:27,391
<i>I don't know how to thank you.</i>

920
01:15:27,697 --> 01:15:30,257
<i>You don't have to thank me.
It's part of my job.</i>

921
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:33,564
Julie, this time was different.
Someone could have gotten hurt.

922
01:15:33,636 --> 01:15:36,070
<i>- Maybe even you.
- Now I'm hurt!</i>

923
01:15:38,508 --> 01:15:40,169
I love him, S.Z.

924
01:15:41,277 --> 01:15:42,835
I really love him.

925
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,315
<i>Now, children of the surf...</i>

926
01:15:49,385 --> 01:15:51,876
<i>you think there are
seven wonders of the world?</i>

927
01:15:51,954 --> 01:15:55,014
<i>Well, here's the eighth. Little Stevie Wonder.</i>

928
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:08,203
<i>Everybody come on, yeah, yeah</i>

929
01:16:08,271 --> 01:16:10,739
<i>Clap your hands, yeah</i>

930
01:16:10,873 --> 01:16:13,603
<i>Everybody come on, yeah, yeah</i>

931
01:16:13,843 --> 01:16:16,505
<i>Clap your hands, yeah, yeah</i>

932
01:16:16,879 --> 01:16:19,939
<i>Come on and clap your hands,
stomp your feet</i>

933
01:16:20,283 --> 01:16:23,013
<i>Get with the rhythm of the Happy Street</i>

934
01:16:23,519 --> 01:16:26,977
<i>'Cause that's my street, Happy Street</i>

935
01:16:50,213 --> 01:16:53,205
<i>Everybody sing out, yeah, yeah</i>

936
01:16:53,282 --> 01:16:54,613
<i>Hallelu</i>

937
01:16:55,952 --> 01:16:58,614
<i>Everybody sing out, yeah, yeah</i>

938
01:16:58,921 --> 01:17:00,252
<i>Hallelu</i>

939
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:05,117
<i>Oh, hallelu, ain't that a treat?</i>

940
01:17:05,628 --> 01:17:08,495
<i>Oh, lots of lovin' on Happy Street</i>

941
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:12,757
<i>'Cause that's my street, yeah, Happy Street</i>

942
01:17:35,424 --> 01:17:38,484
<i>Everybody come on, yeah, yeah</i>

943
01:17:38,561 --> 01:17:41,155
<i>Clap your hands</i>

944
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:44,165
<i>Everybody come on, yeah, yeah</i>

945
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:46,360
<i>Clap your hands</i>

946
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:50,601
<i>You're gonna clap your hands,
stomp your feet</i>

947
01:17:50,673 --> 01:17:54,040
<i>Yeah, get with the rhythm of Happy Street</i>

948
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:57,978
<i>'Cause that's my street, Happy Street</i>

949
01:17:58,281 --> 01:18:01,216
<i>Come on, clap your hands, yeah, yeah</i>

950
01:18:01,284 --> 01:18:03,684
<i>on Happy Street</i>

951
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,750
<i>Everybody come on, yeah, yeah</i>

952
01:18:06,822 --> 01:18:09,188
<i>on Happy Street</i>

953
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:14,619
<i>Yeah, come on, yeah, on Happy Street</i>

954
01:18:15,264 --> 01:18:18,324
<i>'Cause when you're happy,
you make me happy</i>

955
01:18:18,401 --> 01:18:20,869
<i>on Happy Street</i>

956
01:18:39,589 --> 01:18:41,853
- Johnny, get me out of here.
- Dee Dee.

957
01:18:41,924 --> 01:18:46,327
Dee Dee, you'll sit right here and listen.
I've got something to say.

958
01:18:46,395 --> 01:18:50,627
<i>- Whatever it is, I don't want to hear it.
- You sit down and be quiet.</i>

959
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,665
I've got something to say,
and I wanna say it in front of you all.

960
01:18:54,737 --> 01:18:56,637
<i>How about bon voyage?</i>

961
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:02,175
Wait, I owe someone an apology,
and I want to say it in front of all of you.

962
01:19:02,245 --> 01:19:05,339
<i>- Aren't you a little late?
- Why don't you sing for your supper?</i>

963
01:19:05,414 --> 01:19:06,972
<i>The surfin' gigolo</i>

964
01:19:07,049 --> 01:19:09,108
<i>Is often on the go</i>

965
01:19:09,185 --> 01:19:11,050
<i>His surfboard's getting cold</i>

966
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,714
<i>While he's diggin' for her gold!</i>

967
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:17,759
Knock it off! I said, hold it!

968
01:19:17,827 --> 01:19:20,421
You guys put me down good
a while ago on the beach...

969
01:19:20,496 --> 01:19:23,590
and I listened.
Now, you're gonna listen to me!

970
01:19:31,841 --> 01:19:33,433
<i>Dee Dee, I'm sorry.</i>

971
01:19:33,509 --> 01:19:36,774
I hope you can forgive me
for what almost happened.

972
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:39,812
You guys were right, and I was wrong.

973
01:19:40,182 --> 01:19:43,811
The air was so thin up on that big wave
that I went a little stupid.

974
01:19:43,886 --> 01:19:46,821
I've come down to earth now, and I realize.

975
01:19:50,059 --> 01:19:52,425
<i>Dee Dee, if it's not too late...</i>

976
01:19:55,798 --> 01:19:57,265
I love you...

977
01:19:57,533 --> 01:20:00,366
and I guess nothing will ever change that.

978
01:20:27,463 --> 01:20:30,023
I wanted to tell you back at the house...

979
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:32,465
but I suddenly thought I better get here fast.

980
01:20:32,535 --> 01:20:34,935
You see, I like you a lot, Julie.

981
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:38,465
<i>But it's like S.Z. Said,
"It's people for people."</i>

982
01:20:38,841 --> 01:20:41,207
<i>And it's also people for places.</i>

983
01:20:43,012 --> 01:20:46,379
This is my place, and these are my people.

984
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:49,947
<i>This is where I belong.
I wouldn't fit into your life.</i>

985
01:20:51,954 --> 01:20:55,412
<i>That's why I'm here, Frankie,
to tell you I understand.</i>

986
01:20:56,792 --> 01:21:01,252
Maybe, in another place at another time,
things might have been different.

987
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:04,390
They're gonna be different,
starting right now!

988
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:06,395
- Julie!
- Flex!

989
01:21:06,502 --> 01:21:08,197
<i>- He can't have you.
- Let me go.</i>

990
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:11,296
<i>- Wait, you don't understand.
- I understand everything.</i>

991
01:21:11,374 --> 01:21:13,740
- Fanny, you're not...
- Help!

992
01:21:14,143 --> 01:21:16,373
Theodore! What are you doing up there?

993
01:21:16,445 --> 01:21:19,243
Come down this minute,
and help straighten this out!

994
01:21:19,315 --> 01:21:22,580
- All right, fellas, put him down over there.
- Help!

995
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,289
Theodore, you come down!
This is gonna cost you your job!

996
01:21:27,356 --> 01:21:28,448
Help!

997
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:40,935
<i>And that's the start. Onward, men!</i>

998
01:21:41,003 --> 01:21:43,870
<i>- The war's begun!
- Wait a minute, Fanny!</i>

999
01:21:48,611 --> 01:21:51,205
- Onward!
- Are you guys with me?

1000
01:21:56,952 --> 01:21:59,580
No! They're not gonna ruin my place again!

1001
01:22:00,456 --> 01:22:02,117
Yes, they are.

1002
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:06,356
Their bones, break them.
Break them in half. Squeeze them.

1003
01:22:06,429 --> 01:22:08,863
Step on their eyes, gouge out their heads!

1004
01:22:08,931 --> 01:22:11,729
Stamp their necks!
Wring them like a wet bathing suit!

1005
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:14,770
<i>Destroy all of them!
Don't hurt your muscles!</i>

1006
01:22:20,176 --> 01:22:22,804
<i>Don't just lay there.
Get up and do something.</i>

1007
01:22:42,465 --> 01:22:43,659
Watch yourself!

1008
01:22:50,773 --> 01:22:51,967
<i>Don't do that!</i>

1009
01:22:53,409 --> 01:22:55,240
No, fellas, please!

1010
01:23:00,049 --> 01:23:01,846
Come on, you guys!

1011
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:33,843
Thanks.

1012
01:23:48,497 --> 01:23:50,829
<i>Wonder if I'm a bad influence on these kids.</i>

1013
01:23:53,536 --> 01:23:55,731
Come on, Googoo!

1014
01:23:59,341 --> 01:24:00,933
Too bad, baby!

1015
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:03,843
Will you stop that? You'll hurt somebody!

1016
01:24:09,118 --> 01:24:11,484
<i>Don't get excited! That was close!</i>

1017
01:24:19,728 --> 01:24:21,787
Use secret weapon, use it!

1018
01:24:21,864 --> 01:24:23,923
Dick Dale! Play, Dick Dale.

1019
01:24:52,328 --> 01:24:53,693
Get 'em now!

1020
01:24:59,468 --> 01:25:02,631
<i>You don't aim good.
You got a weapon, but you're a bad aimer.</i>

1021
01:25:02,705 --> 01:25:06,072
Follow that sight.
The big one, get the big one.

1022
01:25:12,514 --> 01:25:14,812
You're getting upset, you guys!

1023
01:25:33,435 --> 01:25:36,461
Squeeze them! Step on their eyes!
Gouge out their heads!

1024
01:25:36,538 --> 01:25:38,062
<i>I'm tellin' you!</i>

1025
01:25:38,374 --> 01:25:40,069
Break them in half!

1026
01:25:43,746 --> 01:25:46,180
<i>- That wasn't nice.
- Sorry.</i>

1027
01:25:54,423 --> 01:25:56,789
<i>"Now I lay me down to sleep..."</i>

1028
01:26:10,773 --> 01:26:13,264
- Flex, watch it!
- Help!

1029
01:26:13,342 --> 01:26:15,310
Stop that nonsense!

1030
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:22,517
Stop that nonsense!

1031
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:37,228
<i>It's the boss, Mr. Strangdour.</i>

1032
01:26:38,934 --> 01:26:41,095
You. What are you doing here?

1033
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:44,105
We got them, Mr. Strangdour,
and we're going to crush them...

1034
01:26:44,173 --> 01:26:46,004
<i>because they hurt Flex's dignity.</i>

1035
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:47,133
You!

1036
01:26:48,277 --> 01:26:50,006
You stoop to violence?

1037
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:52,741
You forgot the code of the strong man?

1038
01:26:54,049 --> 01:26:56,074
Wait for me in my office.

1039
01:26:56,318 --> 01:26:58,286
I'll talk to you later.

1040
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:03,422
<i>I think the kid didn't hear me.</i>

1041
01:27:08,363 --> 01:27:10,263
<i>Applicazione dolorosa...</i>

1042
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:12,291
The painful one.

1043
01:27:14,002 --> 01:27:17,460
Now, put that kid down, do you hear?
Gently!

1044
01:27:17,773 --> 01:27:19,297
Yes, Papa.

1045
01:27:22,911 --> 01:27:24,469
Thank you, sir.

1046
01:27:28,517 --> 01:27:30,144
<i>Don't I know you?</i>

1047
01:27:30,219 --> 01:27:31,777
Well, now...

1048
01:27:31,854 --> 01:27:34,584
you might have seen my face quite often.

1049
01:27:34,957 --> 01:27:38,688
<i>It just so happens
that I'm the strongest man in the world.</i>

1050
01:27:39,762 --> 01:27:41,889
And you, you young creep...

1051
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:45,498
you're much too young to look at girls,
you hear me?

1052
01:27:45,834 --> 01:27:47,927
Come with me to the office.

1053
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:50,138
<i>Please, Papa, don't spank me.</i>

1054
01:27:50,205 --> 01:27:54,141
<i>Don't spank me, Papa,
please, don't spank me.</i>

1055
01:27:57,279 --> 01:27:59,042
Do you believe that?

1056
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:10,350
- Hi, gang.
- Hi, Frankie, hi, Dee Dee.

1057
01:28:11,527 --> 01:28:14,223
- You know I love you.
- I think you've said that before.

1058
01:28:14,296 --> 01:28:17,754
<i>- And I'm going to go right on saying it.
- I don't mind.</i>

1059
01:28:18,967 --> 01:28:20,400
<i>Look who's here!</i>

1060
01:28:20,469 --> 01:28:22,664
<i>- It's Deadhead!
- Yeah, Deadhead!</i>

1061
01:28:24,072 --> 01:28:27,667
<i>- He really went through that wall, didn't he?
- What wall?</i>

1062
01:28:30,913 --> 01:28:32,676
Sit, Deadhead, sit.

1063
01:28:33,348 --> 01:28:36,613
He'll be all right.
Tomorrow we'll buy him a leash.

1064
01:28:37,452 --> 01:28:40,182
<i>There's Julie's boat. It's leaving.</i>

1065
01:28:40,989 --> 01:28:42,513
Are you sorry?

1066
01:28:43,725 --> 01:28:46,319
<i>I've got you. That's all I ever wanted.</i>

1067
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:50,921
I hope I never see the likes of them again.

1068
01:28:50,999 --> 01:28:53,297
Relax, Grumpy, we're on our way.

1069
01:28:53,368 --> 01:28:55,768
Where are the mothers of America?

1070
01:28:57,005 --> 01:28:59,200
- I'll miss him, S.Z.
- I know.

1071
01:29:00,843 --> 01:29:02,470
But not for long.

1072
01:29:04,446 --> 01:29:06,209
Where to now, Julie?

1073
01:29:06,682 --> 01:29:10,015
<i>No place. It's people for people, S.Z.</i>

1074
01:29:40,749 --> 01:29:44,207
<i>A girl needs a boy</i>

1075
01:29:44,286 --> 01:29:47,221
<i>she can love</i>

1076
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:52,318
<i>She needs him by her side</i>

1077
01:29:52,394 --> 01:29:55,989
<i>so she can turn with pride</i>

1078
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:59,234
<i>And say he's the boy</i>

1079
01:29:59,301 --> 01:30:02,361
<i>she's dreaming of</i>

1080
01:30:13,482 --> 01:30:16,212
What are you trying to do, kill my boys?

1081
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,354
Where are the mothers of America?
