1
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:30,095
Police siren ...

2
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:40,087
Gentlemen, you are all responsible
officers of Defense, Police, & lntelligence.

3
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:47,094
You all understand the seriousness
of the matter to be discussed

4
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,110
Whatever is to be said will
be not be enough

5
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:57,115
According to this CBl report the
powers responsible for this violence

6
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,118
erupting all over,

7
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:05,056
those business groups whose
job is adulteration, racketeering.

8
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:10,061
Those smuglers that sold drugs
are now smuggling arms as well

9
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:15,055
These are not different gropus.
There is a much bigger organization

10
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:19,070
And behind this orgaization is
the might of someone foreign.

11
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,093
Hail Mogambo!
Hail Mogambo!

12
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:56,101
After the government godowns
were set on fire

13
00:04:57,136 --> 00:05:00,139
wherever there was a shortage
of food in the country

14
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,040
adulterated food at black market
prices has been spread

15
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,039
There are over a lakh of liquor
and gambling dens now in the country

16
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:19,046
There will be over a crore profit
from adulterated food.

17
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:36,074
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY(satisfied)

18
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:42,080
Daaga...Teja...

19
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:49,076
This crore of rupees invest in other
nefarious activities.

20
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:53,091
Within lndia, this violence and destruction ...

21
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:58,085
this stealing, fighting, riots,
breakouts ... ...

22
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:03,033
ALL of this, if it continues as is

23
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:09,029
that day is not too far when
Mogambo's dream will be for real.

24
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,048
We need a place on the Bombay shores,
where from we can smuggle arms

25
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,051
as we wish, when we wish.

26
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:25,045
Preparations wil be done?
Absolutely!

27
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:29,060
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY

28
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:34,065
lgnorant and uncouth lndians

29
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,059
have not learnt a thing from
their history as yet

30
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:45,065
As and when they have fought,
foreign forces have enslaved them.

31
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:51,082
To date they continue fighting...
LET THEM FlGHT

32
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:57,077
On the basis of religion ...
language ... race ...

33
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:00,091
whatever weapons they need to
fight ... Mogambo will give them

34
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,020
And when the foundations of this
country are destroyed, THEN

35
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:13,026
then l will take the next step,
and all of lndia will be at my feet.

36
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:18,042
And every lndian my slave

37
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:24,037
then all the world will cheer ...
''Hail Mogambo, the King of lndia!!''

38
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:34,058
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY

39
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:42,055
mechanical whirring...bubbling

40
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:09,016
You ... you ... you ...

41
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:29,036
Jump ... jump ... jump

42
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:43,061
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY

43
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:49,056
The day l find that formula.

44
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:56,063
Which formula?
Using which one cannot be seen.

45
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,012
turns invisible.
Think! These soldiers that would

46
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:07,007
do anything, were invisible.
Who could fight them?

47
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:12,023
An invisible man ... such a formula?

48
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:18,018
About 20 years back, an lndian
scientist had invented such a formula.

49
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:22,033
He is dead, but did not give the
formula to anyone

50
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:26,037
An invisible man ... such a formula?
How could this be??

51
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:30,041
Why not?
Science is moving so rapidly

52
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:34,045
lt would be wrong to say that
what was not possible then

53
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,049
is not posible now.
l am not going too far in history,

54
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:42,053
about 100 - 150 years.
Those days if someone claimed

55
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:46,057
that steel planes would fly
going 1000 miles in a few hours

56
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:50,061
people would call him crazy.

57
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:53,064
But planes were made, and no
one questions their existence.

58
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:58,058
To King Akbar, if someone was
to speak of phones, radio, cars,

59
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:02,073
he would not believe it

60
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:07,067
That we cannot see, we refuse
to believe

61
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:13,073
lfwe had spoken of transparent
photographs that could see inside us

62
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,089
They would have laughed
exactly as you all do now.

63
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:23,083
But, X-Ray is a common thing now.
Sir... Yes, Raman

64
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:32,093
How X-ray could see within,
Can science make someone invisible

65
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,098
What nonsense? There is no such thing

66
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:41,112
But Sir ... you had said that

67
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:44,115
Please sit down
This is no time for jokes

68
00:10:58,163 --> 00:11:04,068
We want - Dr. Jagdish Verma,
that formula- give it to us.

69
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:06,070
At no cost

70
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:11,075
Don't be a fool.
lfyou do not, your assistant

71
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,069
Prof. Sinha will give it to us
at a price.

72
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:22,075
That's why, don't be a fool.
Give us that formula

73
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:27,080
We will give you your price.
You cannot buy me. l'll call the Police

74
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:33,086
NO
Mr. Sinha? Catch him, shouldn't escape

75
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:49,113
Oh! Raman, what is it?

76
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:54,107
Sir, l think l have upset you ...
lt's no such thing

77
00:11:56,154 --> 00:12:00,113
Actually it was my fault.
Your question was appropriate

78
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:05,051
But... the right to answer is his

79
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:08,065
Sir, whose picture is this?

80
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:16,062
He was a well renowned Scientist
Raman, you had met Arun

81
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:19,076
He is Arun's father, remember.

82
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:23,080
The one you said had several children.
Yes... he is the one

83
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:28,085
He grew up an orphan,
maybe that's what pains him

84
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,080
Wherever he sees an orphan child
he takes them home.

85
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:38,095
What's his home, but
a small huge Hostel.

86
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,099
Calendar, oh! Calendar
Oh, my egg!

87
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:50,096
What is it Arun brother, like a madman
are you yelling for me?

88
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:55,101
This l cannot understand yet,
why your parents named you 'Calendar'

89
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:59,116
Well, they wanted to name me
something in English

90
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:04,053
Even if they had named you Queen Elizabeth
You would still be a cook here.

91
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,058
ln english - Cook
Where were you?

92
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:11,062
l was dead in my room.
Die where you want,

93
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:15,066
but why is it that l have to cook
over halfthe breakfast every morning.

94
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:21,061
Why is it? Answer me?
lt's your luck, whose mistake is it?

95
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:25,076
The mistake is - you do not
know difference between sleep and death.

96
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:30,070
People who sleep, wake up
You refuse to wake up.

97
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:35,075
See Calendar, if you awake late tomorrow
something will be deducted from your pay.

98
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:39,090
Sure, at least that way l will be paid

99
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:44,095
By God, its been 5 years
This way l could see a salary.

100
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,097
What colour is it?

101
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:49,100
The colour of Brinjal (Eggplant)

102
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:53,104
Do hear the Morning News.
The food ration is almost 'finished'

103
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,107
We will bring some from the grocers.

104
00:13:57,142 --> 00:14:01,044
Second news, landlord came for rent.
We will give the rent

105
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,049
The kids have showered?
Yes, did so yesterday, right now

106
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:08,052
they are sleeping, sweet dreams

107
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:12,056
Good Morning... Children

108
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:36,080
faucet turning

109
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,052
Let's go, hurry up, breakfast is ready

110
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:19,056
One by one, go to the bathroom,
get ready. Hurry. Brush up.

111
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:27,053
Arun brother, it would ne so nice if
these unexpected showers would stop

112
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:31,068
Dear Jugal, if you'll were to wake up
without same and go to school

113
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:37,063
that would be so nice.
Brother, why are schools in the morning?

114
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:42,068
Because everything starts in the morning
Life sleeps at night & awakes in the morning

115
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:46,083
lfwe have to walk with life,
we have to wake up in the morning.

116
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:50,087
Why are Mondays always after Sundays?

117
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:55,081
Just as sadness after happiness,
happiness after sadness, night after day

118
00:15:56,127 --> 00:16:00,086
day after night, Monday is after Sunday
and after Saturday is Sunday ...

119
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,033
S U N D A Y!!

120
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:59,118
lt's been 2 hours - and just 4 bags?
Working like turtles!

121
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:05,058
Roopchandji, greetings
There goes buffalo in the water'

122
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:11,064
Here they come again.
Your credit will someday destroy me.

123
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:17,070
May your enemies be destroyed
That is my prayer everyday.

124
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:21,085
There goes buffalo in the water'
Hi Roop!

125
00:21:23,121 --> 00:21:27,080
l thought l would make one lumpsum
payment. What do you think?

126
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:32,096
Full Payment? You?

127
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:40,093
Laughs. See he laughs
Money coming in makes him laugh.

128
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:45,098
So why are you standing?
Take what we need.

129
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:49,113
Accountant, do write it down

130
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:54,118
l have to stop these monthly credits,
but my heart is such.

131
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:59,112
Your heart is speechless, otherwise
who would sell stone for grain prices.

132
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:04,060
One kilo of grain contains halfkilo stones.
But wheat, rice, pebbles, stones are same

133
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:08,065
price in your store. Amazing.

134
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,068
There goes buffalo in the water'

135
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:15,072
Stones in my grain. Go elsewhere.

136
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:20,077
How could we? Habit is such.

137
00:22:21,112 --> 00:22:24,081
Eating food is no fun without
the crunching sound of stones.

138
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:28,085
Let's go Arun, we have to go home
and cook, and before that

139
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,089
we need to separte the rice from
the stones.

140
00:22:33,124 --> 00:22:36,093
Your full payment will made in 2-4 days
l have to go for Music tuitions.

141
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:43,100
There... Goes... Buffalo in the water'

142
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,069
This looks like the house.
This lS the house...

143
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:35,085
Lets go.
Do not worry. This will be easy.

144
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:51,101
Did you order the the black stones for Lentil?
Yes Sir.

145
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:56,106
Black for Lentil, White for Rice, and

146
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:59,109
brown for wheat, ordered 100 bags each.

147
00:24:01,078 --> 00:24:05,037
The Boss' business is doubling everyday
By the grace of God.

148
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,052
Why? Aren't you benefiting too?
With your grace, yes l am.

149
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:13,056
Should l leave?

150
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:16,059
Leave, but that house should be empty.

151
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:20,063
That landlord is our man.
He will vacate that house in a snap.

152
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:23,066
You want the house. You'll get it.

153
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:26,069
Vacate the house. What are you saying?

154
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:29,072
Just what you hear.

155
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:32,075
Think of all the years we have spent here.

156
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,078
Why think of all the years you
have spent here?

157
00:24:36,113 --> 00:24:37,080
What of all the months you have not paid?

158
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:41,084
l will pay the rent...
Not will pay... but HAVE to pay.

159
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:45,088
Here is the notice of your dues.

160
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:48,091
Pay up or vacate the house.

161
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:53,096
You cannot pay this, better to leave

162
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:05,042
lfwe don't pay, we may lose the house.

163
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:09,046
Where will l take these children?

164
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:13,050
l have an idea.

165
00:25:14,085 --> 00:25:16,053
Why don't we rent the room upstairs?
A paying guest.

166
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,058
The idea is good.
The idea is very good.

167
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:24,061
l will place a newspaper ad today itself.

168
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:27,064
Typewriter clicking...office chatter

169
00:25:35,106 --> 00:25:37,074
How can l tolerate this?

170
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,079
Hello... What?
Please take this for printing.

171
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:46,083
... not about printing
l am not talking to you.

172
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:50,087
l need to book some tickets.
l. l. l cannot book your tickets.

173
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:53,090
Who is this?
This is not Ruby Talkies.

174
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:58,084
This is a newspaper office.
Try to understand.

175
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,097
Wrong number yaar (friend)

176
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:05,024
Take this and... give it to the reader

177
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:16,035
Hello. Yes.
Your buffalo has stopped giving milk?

178
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:24,054
This is not the Animal Hospital.

179
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:38,057
Yes Sir. - Who Sir?
ls she here? ... that girl

180
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:41,071
Which girl Sir?
That girl... what's her name.

181
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,076
Have this typed for the Editor. Today.

182
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:51,081
This 'Sorry' is weird.
Do, say as you please, then say 'Sorry'

183
00:26:53,117 --> 00:26:56,086
Mr. Gupta, why is this news item
still on my table?

184
00:26:59,123 --> 00:27:02,024
The same 'Sorry' again.
The day is not far when

185
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,028
when people will rob someone,
say 'Sorry', and then...

186
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:13,036
l have brought... the article
that you needed

187
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:17,040
You have brought it (coughs)
Why did you put it on the chair?

188
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:21,044
Since you are sitting on your table
l thought to use the chair.

189
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:31,054
So your pyjamas are not clean.
What could l do about it?

190
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,057
This is not 'Bharat Laundry'

191
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:41,053
Now... this... l mean this article
cannot be printed on Sunday

192
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:47,070
lt's too late
Ought to be. Why won't it be late?

193
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:51,074
There are children where l stay.
l cannot work with children around me.

194
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:55,078
l am looking for a new place
Please sit.

195
00:27:56,113 --> 00:27:59,082
Why do children exist.
Couldn't they be born as grown ups?

196
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:15,020
Do you have any work for me?
Yes, yes. Very interseting work.

197
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:20,025
A thiefhas been released from Jail
25 years old, but been to jail 50 times.

198
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:25,041
What is his name?
Manglu. He should be here any minute.

199
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:29,045
You take his interview.
People will enjoy his story

200
00:28:32,082 --> 00:28:35,051
Brother, Madam.

201
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:38,054
l have a room. l need to place an Ad.

202
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,056
Go into that room.

203
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:43,059
Make 4 copies and place it in
my office

204
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:51,067
So. You are the one.

205
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:04,014
You may say what you want.

206
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,017
No need to fear.

207
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:10,020
What is there to fear. lts quite pleasant.

208
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:21,020
The way you are? How long?

209
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:23,033
Since childhood.

210
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:26,036
Since childhood.

211
00:29:30,074 --> 00:29:32,042
What you are doing, Why?

212
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:36,046
Money. Simple.
Actually l am not too happy about it

213
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:41,040
But sometimes a man has to do things
against his wishes. Helplessness.

214
00:29:42,086 --> 00:29:45,055
You think that all helpless people
are corrupt.

215
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,059
No. There are some virtuous too.
Sveral of them.

216
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:52,062
That's life

217
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:58,057
OK. Right. How old were you when
you first went to jail?

218
00:30:00,104 --> 00:30:05,064
My... my age.
What are you saying? Me & jail.

219
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,078
Have you not been to jail 50 times?

220
00:30:09,113 --> 00:30:12,082
50 times. Who said so?
So how times have you been...

221
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:16,086
l have not been to jail even once,
and why do you want to send me to jail.

222
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:19,089
ls this a Newspaper office or Police Station?

223
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:22,092
Listen Manglu.
Manglu?

224
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:27,086

00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:36,106
You too are in this room.

227
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:40,110

And what are you doing here?

228
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:43,113
l am a room. On rent. To place an Ad

229
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:46,116
Now l just wish to go. Salutations.

230
00:30:49,153 --> 00:30:50,120
Be careful.

231
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:53,123
This woman. Does she work here?

232
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:56,126
Come here. Are you married?

233
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:00,130
l am not here to place a matrimonial ad.
l know that.

234
00:31:01,098 --> 00:31:05,057
You do not have any kids?
lfneed to be married for kids.

235
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:13,076
That room you want to rent. l will take it.

236
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:18,081
So why don't you say that.

237
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:25,077
Madam, what a room.
Room, balcony, garden, and the Ocean.

238
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:30,082
and 24 hours breeze. That too free.
l am taking the room.

239
00:31:31,128 --> 00:31:34,097
Without seeing it?
No kids is enough reason for me.

240
00:31:35,132 --> 00:31:37,100
Take it. 500 Rupees. Advance.

241
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:42,105
Those Kids.
There are none that's why l am taking it

242
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:49,112
OK, the room is yours. Rest is up to God

243
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:54,151
Here we are.

244
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:58,110
For this they have said
''A Beautiful Bungalow''

245
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:05,095
Cook... Cook

246
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:09,054
You see Madam
So beautiful, such peace & silence

247
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,069
Calendar, is everything arranged?
Yes all the children...

248
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:16,072
Children!
Not Children.

249
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:21,077
What l... meant was all the...
small... big... suitcases

250
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:25,081
the light... heavy suitcases
have been put away.

251
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:35,091
The field is totally clear.
What?

252
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:37,093
He is talking about your clean room.

253
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,089
So beautiful, lovely, and so qui...

254

00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,050
...that is important for my work.

258
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:08,047
Than you have come to right place.
Soon you will clamour for human voice

259
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:17,067
Lets go upstairs
to your room.

260
00:33:23,107 --> 00:33:25,075
What's the matter? - Yes
Should we go upstairs?

261
00:33:30,114 --> 00:33:33,083
You see this stairs...
they go upstairs,

262
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:36,086
and these same stairs also come down.

263
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:41,080
Wonderful. Very Good
Everything is well planned here. Lets go.

264
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:51,101
Yes Arun brother.
is everything in its right place?

265
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:56,095
Yes, but what about all those small
pieces that are downstairs.

266
00:33:57,141 --> 00:34:00,110
We will see.
Somethings will work out

267
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,046
You manage. lt's up to you.

268
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:09,052
How do you like your room?

269
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:13,056
Umm... its good... good

270
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:16,059
Here l can write a ghost story

271
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:20,063
What happened?

272
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:26,069
What happened?

273
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:29,072
C..C..Cockroach! Cockroach!!

274
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:34,077
Wh.. Where is it?

275
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,086
You are scared of a cockroach.

276
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:48,080
l am not scared of even tigers,
but Cockroaches... yes l am.

277
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:52,095
l am not scared
What is there to be scared of?.

278
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:57,100
Why don't you call someone to kill it

279
00:34:58,135 --> 00:35:00,103
l would call, but those that will
come are children.

280
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:04,040
Whoever it is, at least we will
be free of its clutches.

281
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:08,044
The cockroach wil be dead... dead
What will be left is you & the children.

282
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,038
Quickly call someone.

00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:48,084
What are these children doing here?

286
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,088
They are killing the cockroach.
You said you did not have children

287
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:56,092
These are not my children
You rascal...

l will take you to Supreme Court.

289

292
00:36:14,077 --> 00:36:17,046
plus the deposit, l want it back.

295
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,057
E.. E.. Ea..

296
00:36:41,104 --> 00:36:44,073
Till we owe you, you may stay
here as long as you please.

297
00:36:45,108 --> 00:36:48,077
Even longer if you wish.
By the way the room is not so bad.

298
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:52,081
the room, the balcony,
the garden, the ocean... Madam

299
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:07,030
You always mentioned that father
was a renowned scientist.

300
00:37:08,065 --> 00:37:10,033
And that he invented something
beyond compare in the world.

301
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:12,035
What was that thing?

302
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:18,030
What was that thing?
people would not believe it.

303
00:37:21,078 --> 00:37:24,047
But you are his son.
l will tell you.

304
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:30,042
lt was a gadget, that by turning
on would make someone invisible.

305
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,059
An lnvisible man.
How is that possible?

306
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:40,063
Why cant you see in the dark?
Because there is no light... uhh

307
00:37:41,098 --> 00:37:43,066
Why can you see in the light?

308
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:45,068
l will tell you.

309
00:37:46,103 --> 00:37:50,062
Because the light bouncing off
of someone makes them visible.

310
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:56,068
But if there was something created
that would allow the light to go

311
00:38:06,056 --> 00:38:09,025
Did not understand.
Like glass.

312
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,029
Light hits the glass, and passes
through hence its invisible.

313
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:19,035
l see you'll do not believe me.

314
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,038
No No Mr. Sinha. lfyou say.. so..

315
00:38:24,074 --> 00:38:28,033
But where is that gadget to
let light pass through the body.

316
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:36,041
Your father destroyed the formula
as.. he.. did not want it to be abused.

317
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:42,058
But where is that thing. The gadget?
You have it?

318
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:47,063
Let that be.
Did you find a paying guest?

319
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:51,067
Not found (him) found (her)

320
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:53,069
And how wonderful is she!!

321
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:17,026
lfyou all do not stop making noise,
l will report you to the police...

322
00:39:18,061 --> 00:39:22,020
You all will be handcuffed in prison.
What is a prison?

323
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:30,028
You have come at the right time.
see what is going on

324
00:39:33,076 --> 00:39:35,044
Arun brother, we will wear handcuffs.

325
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,048
What happened Madam?
You ask what happened

326
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:43,052
You had said the room, balcony, garden
but did not mention the kids in the garden

327
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:47,056
And with the kids a football.

328
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:50,059
There will ne no more noise.

329
00:39:53,096 --> 00:39:56,065
l had told you all not to create a
disturbance here.

330
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,068
But... (all talking at same time)

331
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:11,080
l am not saying do not
play here. Play on the beach.

332
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:15,084
in fact l too will come with you all.
Lets go to the beach...

333
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:36,105
lt's my fault.

334
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,107
Please listen to me Madam.

335
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:43,112
lt is not the children's fault.
Actually l.. By me..

336
00:40:45,148 --> 00:40:48,117
Yes l do know it is a scheme, plan
against me.

337
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,121
All children to one side.
And l still wont allow them to succeed.

338
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:57,115
Now l will take civil action against you.
This football will be presented in court.

339
00:40:59,162 --> 00:41:02,063
Why in the court?
Nobody plays football there.

340
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:08,070
Please listen to me Madam.

341
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:12,074
l will.. l will not let you go.
Absolutely not.

342
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,079
Such annoyance... those children...

343
00:41:18,114 --> 00:41:20,082
l will definitely take them to court.

344
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,066
Please come Mr. Manicklal

345
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:57,061
l am here, but you do remember
that your rent is due today.

346
00:48:59,108 --> 00:49:03,010
Either pay the full amount up to
today or vacate the house.

347
00:49:04,047 --> 00:49:07,016
Either pay the full amount
or vacate the house.

348
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:11,020
Well if l have do either one, then
may as well pay you the rent.

349
00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:14,023
What...
ls that OK

350
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:20,029
The full rent?
Anything else.. Tea..Cold drink

351
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:27,036
You mean you could not
vacate that house.

352
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:30,039
lts possible that l may have to
vacate your store, Roopchand.

353
00:49:32,075 --> 00:49:33,042
There goes buffalo in the water'

354
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:35,044
Darling, watch your blood pressure

355
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,048
Mr. Teja, you are worried over nothing
our Karga runs a gambling den..

356
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:43,052
in that neighborhood. He will take
a few of his men to... what's his name's...

357
00:49:44,087 --> 00:49:47,056
place. A few beatings and the
him and his children are out.

358
00:49:48,091 --> 00:49:49,058
Honor, please wait 2 - 4 days more.

359
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:52,061
Why, what will you do in
the additional 2 - 4 days?

360
00:49:53,096 --> 00:49:56,065
l will squeeze them so tight...
That's it.

361
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,069
lfthey have nothing to eat, then
why won't they vacate the house?

362
00:50:01,104 --> 00:50:03,072
Calendar, give us food. (all yelling)

363
00:50:14,117 --> 00:50:18,076
Children please be quiet.
Why are you all creatng a ruckus?

364
00:50:20,123 --> 00:50:23,092
Calendar, till such time we do not
get food, we will continue...

365
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:27,096
yelling continues...

366
00:50:29,132 --> 00:50:31,100
Jugal.. Jugal.. Behave yourself

367
00:50:40,143 --> 00:50:43,112
We are all hungry.
l do not have 10 hands to feed you'll

368
00:50:44,147 --> 00:50:47,116
lt takes time to cook food.
...yelling continues

369
00:50:50,153 --> 00:50:52,121
Urmi, come into the kitchen for help.

370
00:50:53,156 --> 00:50:57,115
Cant you all stay quiet.
Cant you all stay quiet. (mockingly)

371
00:51:00,163 --> 00:51:02,063
See. See this.

372
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,068
No Rice, flour. No Lentil.

373
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:09,071
How can l make you all understand...

374
00:51:11,107 --> 00:51:13,075
lndeed, we do not have anything?

375
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,077
You can see for yourself.

376
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:18,080
l cannot see these starving children.

377
00:51:19,115 --> 00:51:21,083
Now we can only hope for Arun
to do something.

378
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,088
Calendar, can't we stay hungry
for one day?

379
00:51:35,131 --> 00:51:38,100
lfwe do not have it at home,
why don't we get it from Roopchand's

380
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:42,104
l had been there in the morning,
but he will listen only to Arun.

381
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:45,107
You won't die if you go hungry
for one day.

382
00:51:46,142 --> 00:51:47,109
And what if l die.

383
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:51,113
Tina, we will good food in the evening.
OK.. OK

384
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:11,066
Arun brother, l will not die

385
00:52:12,101 --> 00:52:14,069
lfl do not eat for a day,
l will not die.

386
00:52:17,106 --> 00:52:18,073
You have not eaten.

387
00:52:19,108 --> 00:52:20,075
Calendar did not give it.

388
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,093
Calendar you have not fed
the children since morning.

389
00:52:39,128 --> 00:52:41,096
What could l do. l did go
to Roopcahnd, but...

390
00:52:43,132 --> 00:52:44,099
Yes, he must have wanted money.

391
00:52:47,136 --> 00:52:51,095
Don't worry children, l have money.
l received my tuition fees today.

392
00:52:53,142 --> 00:52:54,109
Just 15 minutes.

393
00:52:56,145 --> 00:52:58,113
l will get lots to eat. OK

394
00:53:00,149 --> 00:53:03,050
There goes buffalo in the water'
So what sin have l committed

395
00:53:04,086 --> 00:53:06,054
l am running a business, not charity.

396
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:09,057
Want to buy, pay up and take.

397
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:12,060
l have brought money.
There goes buffalo in the water'

398
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:16,064
And your money l have always
paid on time.

399
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:19,067
but since l was not there, the children
were hungry all day.

400
00:53:20,102 --> 00:53:22,070
Count it, it's all there.
lt's all there.

401
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:25,073
So all accounts are settled to date.

402
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:28,076
Thank you very much.

403
00:53:31,113 --> 00:53:34,082
Hit the road. Go.
At least give me the ration...

404
00:53:35,117 --> 00:53:36,084
Do you have money for that?

405
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,089
l just paid off your full credit.
And now you wish for credit again.

406
00:53:42,124 --> 00:53:45,093
l want hard cash, or l will not
give you a single grain.

407
00:53:46,128 --> 00:53:49,097
Please don't do so.
So what l am to do.

408
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:53,101
lfthey are to die tomorrow, let them
die today. Children of swine.

409
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:59,107
Raghu.. Bansi.. Help me
Dare you say such things...

410
00:54:02,078 --> 00:54:03,045
Get it out of here.

411
00:54:08,084 --> 00:54:11,053
Eats from my store, and dares
to hit me.

412
00:54:22,098 --> 00:54:25,067
Have l ever refused you anything..
the fact is l do not have any money.

413
00:54:26,102 --> 00:54:29,071
This is the problem with people like you
Take your violin and go.

414
00:54:30,106 --> 00:54:33,075
We do not want your tuition.
Leave at your car at the garage.

415
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,078
lfit is sold we will pay you.
We do not give advances on jalopies.

416
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:58,100
Arun brother has not returned yet?

417
00:55:04,073 --> 00:55:07,042
Just a little while longer
He will soon be here. Come.

418
00:55:56,125 --> 00:56:00,084
At the door, she waved her magic
broom, and the door opened

419
00:56:03,065 --> 00:56:06,034
You know what happened then.
The fairy took the prince...

420
00:56:07,069 --> 00:56:09,037
l don't want to hear stories.
l am hungry.

421
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:12,040
Tina, not the same talk. Arun...

422
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:28,056
Arun brother l am hungry.
The fairy took the prince

423
00:56:31,093 --> 00:56:34,062
and went towards the stars.
Then they hid behind the moon.

424
00:56:35,097 --> 00:56:38,066
You know what happened then.
Then it started to rain over there.

425
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:42,070
A heavy rainfall.
Then there was aloud noise.

426
00:56:43,105 --> 00:56:47,064
The fairy was scared.
So scared.. That..

427
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:34,055
We are not hungry

428
00:57:36,091 --> 00:57:37,058
We are only sleepy.

429
00:57:38,093 --> 00:57:40,061
Really, we are not hungry.

430
00:57:41,096 --> 00:57:43,064
We are not hungry

431
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:47,068
l promise you, we are not hungry.

432
00:58:25,074 --> 00:58:27,042
l have failed today.

433
00:58:29,078 --> 00:58:32,047
l spent my entire childhood
without my parents,

434
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:37,052
helpless, alone.

435
00:58:39,088 --> 00:58:40,055
l brought you all..

436
00:58:43,092 --> 00:58:45,060
one by one to this house

437
00:58:48,097 --> 00:58:50,065
so the pains l have suffered

438
00:58:52,101 --> 00:58:53,068
you all won't have to suffer

439
00:58:56,105 --> 00:59:00,064
to show you all happiness that
l had never seen.

440
00:59:03,045 --> 00:59:06,014
but... l couldn't do anything

441
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:10,018
l have lost.

442
00:59:12,054 --> 00:59:14,022
l have lost, Umi

443
01:01:09,104 --> 01:01:11,072
What's the matter today?

444
01:01:12,107 --> 01:01:15,076
What happened?
The children are very quiet today.

445
01:01:17,112 --> 01:01:19,080
How could starved children for
2 days make any noises?

446
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:24,078
We both have holidays on Sundays.

447
01:02:25,113 --> 01:02:27,081
Why not we give our fight
a holiday too.

448
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:31,085
l thought why don't we have
a picnic here itself. Uh.

449
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:47,101
Can l tell you all something
You all do not look good when quiet,

450
01:02:48,136 --> 01:02:50,104
it's better when you'll are making a noise.

451
01:02:55,143 --> 01:02:58,112
Anyways, why don't we eat
something first, then make noise.

452
01:02:59,147 --> 01:03:01,047
l am very hungry.

453
01:03:05,087 --> 01:03:06,054
What we you'll have?

454
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:29,077
Tina, what will you have? First..

455
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,087
Take. Eat.

456
01:03:51,133 --> 01:03:53,101
Come, let's all be friends.

457
01:04:01,076 --> 01:04:03,044
So Tina, will you be my friend?

458
01:04:10,085 --> 01:04:11,052
Yes.

459
01:04:30,105 --> 01:04:35,065
Calendar, give some to everyone,
and me too. l am very hungry too.

460
01:04:43,118 --> 01:04:46,087
l had given you a 3-months advance.
But l really like this place.

461
01:04:48,123 --> 01:04:50,091
Balcony.. Garden.. Ocean..

462
01:04:54,129 --> 01:04:56,097
So if you wish you nay have
another 6-months advance.

463
01:04:57,132 --> 01:05:01,034
But if ever the football hits me again,
l will never return it. Understood.

464
01:05:14,082 --> 01:05:18,041
Daga and Teja. Soon to be
appointed Advisors in my new...

465
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:23,057
Empire... are so useless that
they are unable to get me a

466
01:05:24,092 --> 01:05:28,051
palce from where l can supply
arms all over lndia.

467
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:31,065
But Mr. Mogambo...
Mogambo does not wish to hear...

468
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:35,069
any excuses. Just wants to hear
about his victories, rule, and

469
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:38,072
Emperorship

470
01:05:39,107 --> 01:05:41,075
Mogambo's dreams even tower
above the skies.

471
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:46,069
And you...
The place you desire will be aranged.

472
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:50,084
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY

473
01:06:06,068 --> 01:06:09,037
Who are you people, and
what do you'll want? But...

474
01:06:12,074 --> 01:06:13,041
Leave the children...
All screaming for help

475
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:18,046
What do you want?

476
01:06:32,094 --> 01:06:33,061
Let me go!

477
01:06:40,102 --> 01:06:42,070
Karga, don't toch the children.

478
01:06:44,106 --> 01:06:46,074
Don't hit Arun, please don't hit him.

479
01:07:10,065 --> 01:07:12,033
Leave my children alone.

480
01:07:16,071 --> 01:07:19,040
There goes buffalo in the water'
Roopchandji, my children

481
01:07:27,082 --> 01:07:29,050
Greetings, Mr. Daga
Greetings, Mr. Teja

482
01:07:33,088 --> 01:07:34,055
ls this him?

483
01:07:36,091 --> 01:07:39,060
Whether you are Arun or not, its
better if you leave within 2 days.

484
01:07:41,096 --> 01:07:42,063
Honor, its better for him if he
leaves within 2 days.

485
01:07:43,098 --> 01:07:47,057
Worthless, keeps spreading rumours
about stones in our grain.

486
01:07:48,103 --> 01:07:49,070
Really.

487
01:07:54,109 --> 01:07:57,078
These businesses and people are
all mine. lfyou utter one

488
01:07:58,113 --> 01:08:01,014
word against them. We will
pull your tongue out.

489
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,018
Let's go Mr. Teja.

490
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:11,025
TWO DAYS!

491
01:08:20,068 --> 01:08:22,036
Arun brother, get up.

492
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:45,059
Uncleji, those are very dangerous people
l realized Arun was worried,

493
01:08:48,096 --> 01:08:51,065
but such people were his enemies,
l never knew that.

494
01:08:54,102 --> 01:08:58,061
lt's good you told me. Ask Arun to
come see me. Maybe l can help.

495
01:09:00,108 --> 01:09:02,008
Now you go home. l have to
go elsewhere.

496
01:09:05,046 --> 01:09:06,013
Go home carefully.

497
01:09:24,065 --> 01:09:26,033
Sinha. Driver stop the car.
That was Proffessor Sinha.

498
01:09:28,069 --> 01:09:31,038
Turn the car around.
Back. Back...

499
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:40,047
That's him. Catch him.
Don't let him escape.

500
01:09:51,092 --> 01:09:53,060
Sir, could l make a call.
But where to?

501
01:09:54,095 --> 01:09:57,064
The press...
l meant where from. Where's the phone?

502
01:10:00,101 --> 01:10:02,069
What is this?
Not a phone. This is a radio.

503
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:07,074
Either you get wrong numbers,
or when you want to dial out

504
01:10:08,109 --> 01:10:11,078
you get to hear colourful programs
Childish programs??

505
01:10:12,113 --> 01:10:17,073
Two women talking of in-laws.
Two business men talking about prices

506
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:21,088
sometimes there is a discussion
on love between two lovers

507
01:10:22,123 --> 01:10:25,092
simply amazing.

508
01:10:33,134 --> 01:10:35,102
Hello Mr. Daga, what do you want?

509
01:10:36,137 --> 01:10:39,106
Gold, Silver, Rifles

510
01:10:40,141 --> 01:10:41,108
And hand grenades.

511
01:10:43,144 --> 01:10:46,113
This evening come over to my
place, we will discuss these,

512
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:49,116
and also take care of your entertainment.
How is that?

513
01:10:51,152 --> 01:10:53,120
You must have heard of Awala's
famous dancer- 'Breeze Breezy'

514
01:10:54,155 --> 01:10:57,124
Mr. Wolcott, we will paint your
evenings with her colours.

515
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,127
Breeze Breezy, l have heard of her.

516
01:11:01,096 --> 01:11:03,064
l too have heard of her name.
Today we will see her too.

517
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,069
But where do l have to come?
Powai Lake, Bungalow No. 24

518
01:11:12,107 --> 01:11:13,074
Breeze... Breezy...

519
01:11:17,112 --> 01:11:20,081
Good l met you here.
There is a letter for you.

520
01:11:22,117 --> 01:11:23,084
Mr. Sinha's letter.

521
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:25,086
Arun, l am going far,

522
01:11:28,123 --> 01:11:32,082
but before l leave l want to share
a secret with you, that l never did.

523
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:36,097
Your father... (audio trails off)

524
01:12:14,102 --> 01:12:15,069
Seems like there is no power

525
01:13:27,108 --> 01:13:31,067
Whosoever put this adget around
their wrist and clicks the button

526
01:13:32,113 --> 01:13:33,080
will turn invisible.

527
01:13:36,117 --> 01:13:39,086
Under these circumstances, they
can only be seen through red

528
01:13:40,121 --> 01:13:43,090
light or glass, as the gadget has
no effect on the colour red.

529
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:48,084
Except for that with a flip
of the switch the person will

530
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:52,099
become completely visible, and
no pair of eyes in the world

531
01:13:53,134 --> 01:13:55,102
can see them.

532
01:14:28,102 --> 01:14:31,071
What do you think Jugal?
What should we do?

533
01:14:32,106 --> 01:14:34,074
Whatever Mr. Sinha said is true.

534
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:39,079
Should l wear it?
Yes.

535
01:14:47,121 --> 01:14:49,089
Should l turn on the switch?
Yes. Yes.

536
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:00,100
Arun brother. The lights...

537
01:15:06,074 --> 01:15:08,042
Where are you?
l am here Jugal.

538
01:15:10,078 --> 01:15:15,038
l can hardly se.. see you
l really can't be seen?

539
01:15:16,084 --> 01:15:18,052
No.
Absolutely not.

540
01:15:19,087 --> 01:15:22,056
No.
l cannot believe that l am invisible.

541
01:15:28,096 --> 01:15:32,055
l cannot be seen even in the mirror
Come take a look

542
01:15:34,102 --> 01:15:38,061
l know that too.
But how will you come back?

543
01:15:39,107 --> 01:15:40,074
Should l press this button again?

544
01:15:45,113 --> 01:15:48,082
So you are back.
l am back.

545
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:54,088
Now l can see you.
This is amazing.

546
01:15:55,123 --> 01:15:56,090
Amazing. lsn't it.

547
01:15:58,126 --> 01:16:01,027
Should l disppear again.
Yes. No No No...

548
01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:05,032
Please come back.
l am very scared.

549
01:16:10,071 --> 01:16:14,030
l can be seen. See.
Should l be invisible again?

550
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:16,043
Yes.

551
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:25,052
My good brother.
Please come back again.

552
01:16:28,089 --> 01:16:32,048
What is happening?
l will go crazy. l will go crazy.

553
01:16:57,118 --> 01:16:59,086
Please don't do that.
l may fall down.

554
01:17:05,059 --> 01:17:08,028
lfyou do that again. l will
never talk to you

555
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:11,031
ln that case l will turn
invisible forever.

556
01:17:12,066 --> 01:17:15,035
Jugal, see those red pieces
of glass there.

557
01:17:17,071 --> 01:17:18,038
bring one of those pieces here.

558
01:17:20,074 --> 01:17:21,041
Now see me through them.

559
01:17:23,077 --> 01:17:26,046
l can see you in the red glass.

560
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:30,050
And now?
Now l cannot see you.

561
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:33,053
Can you see me now?
l can see you again.

562
01:17:38,092 --> 01:17:40,060
Beware of the red colour.

563
01:17:41,095 --> 01:17:45,054
l will save myself, but Daga and
Teja wherever they are,

564
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,068
who will save them from me.

565
01:17:58,112 --> 01:18:01,013
You Mr. Dhaga (thread)
Not Dhaga, Daga (betray)

566
01:18:06,053 --> 01:18:08,021
This is Mr. Teja
Bheja (brain) Funny name.

567
01:18:09,056 --> 01:18:12,025
Teja- Teja
Bheja (brain) - Bheja, right

568
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,028
We have a special guest tonight
Mr. Wolcott.

569
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,030
Boycott
whom you have to entertain.

570
01:18:28,075 --> 01:18:30,043
Show Madam to her dressing room.

571
01:18:38,085 --> 01:18:41,054
Mr. Daga why does she call
me Bheja (brain)?

572
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:47,060
Madam, this is your room.

573
01:19:00,107 --> 01:19:03,008
You can have as much gold
as you need.

574
01:19:05,046 --> 01:19:08,015
and l can supply you
with guns and drugs.

575
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:12,019
That's good, we will take the
gold and the guns and the drugs.

576
01:19:13,054 --> 01:19:17,013
Before all that, l need something
the Golden Hanuman

577
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:21,028
Show it to me.
Do you recognise it.

578
01:19:22,063 --> 01:19:25,032
This statue is in the city's
big Hanuman temple.

579
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:28,035
This is very valuable in
the foreign nations.

580
01:19:30,071 --> 01:19:34,030
We will definitely get you this statue.
Let's set up the business first.

581
01:19:36,077 --> 01:19:37,044
Where did Mr. Daga go?
