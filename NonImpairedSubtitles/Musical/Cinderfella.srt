159
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,074
There, Rupert.
There was a strange man in our pool.

160
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,157
In my pool.

161
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,717
Oh, yes, dear Stepmother.
In your pool.

162
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,040
And we were just talking, and
all of a sudden, he just disappeared.

163
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,153
- What do you mean, "disappeared"?
- Just like I say, Mother... Stepmother.

164
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,716
We were there talking
and he was just gone.

165
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,273
Pshtwaa...

166
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,436
And there he wasn't, and...

167
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,870
- Pshtwaa...
- Pshtwaa...

168
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,194
How do we make
Corkhead here disappear?

169
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,756
If the princess sees him, she'll think
there's insanity in the family.

170
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,953
But this is true. I'm not making it up.
I was standing there talking to him.

171
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,197
In fact, he told me
all about the ball we're having.

172
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,836
And he said it to me
before the paper even came out.

173
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,871
You're cracking, kid.

174
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,868
Just like those dreams you have
about your old man.

175
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,756
Is that so, Mr Smart Alec?
Well, those dreams are true.

176
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,918
Fella's father's always telling him
that he's rich.

177
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,509
- Isn't he, Fella?
- Yes, Stepmother dear.

178
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,473
Yes. Except that I always
wake up too soon.

179
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,514
I don't think you ever woke up.
You're a spook. Beat it!

180
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,392
Yeah, but all I...

181
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,559
OK. I'll set the table for dinner.

182

...is open.
And I'll leave while I can.

have me sit down?

I hope this doesn't sound
like braggadocio,

428
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,678

You see, the women reporters
of that period wrote the story.

436
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,795
So naturally, they attributed
my magic to a woman.

437
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,310
Women are strange, Fella.
They're like the Russians.

No! I know the story of Cinderella.

The Prince is waiting.

471
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,920
It was so nice to see you again.

472
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,396
So nice to see you again, Godfather.

473
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,989
Delighted to have met you, sire.

474
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,273
Oh, also very good to meet up you.

475
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,393
And you'll love living in a castle.
Castles are so roomy.

476
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,876
So much more comfortable
than tract houses.

477
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,672
Yeah, that's true,
some houses are not the same as...

478
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,393

Goodbye, Cinderella.

I mean, Mrs Charming.

Goodbye.

Me, in a castle? What did she mean,
I would live in a castle?

483
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,917
Fella, you do believe that
I'm your fairy godfather?

484
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,872
Yes, sire. Yes, sir, I do.

485
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,595
- Then you'll believe what I tell you?
- Yes, without a doubt.

486
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,074
Good.

487
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,356
Fella, you have been chosen
to rectify all the great wrongs

488
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,074
brought about by the original
Cinderella story.

489
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,990
Through the centuries, women,
influenced by Cinderella, have waited

490
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,430
for their Prince Charmings
to come galloping

491
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,995
out of the wild blue yonder
on white horses

492
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,158
to claim their hands in marriage.

493
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,157
Yeah, I... I read that once.

494
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,193
But there was only
one Prince Charming.

495
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,076
When he didn't appear, these women
married the closest available man.

496
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,396
They were forever after miserable,

497
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,639
because they always regretted it,
and they felt that...

498
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,274
...that they had taken second best.

499
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,790
But what is worse, they made
their poor husbands miserable

500
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,197
because the poor fellow
wasn't a prince.

501
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,796
Oh, the Cinderella legend

502
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,709
has brought nothing but dissatisfaction
to the hearts of women,

503
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,354
and their husbands
have taken the brunt of it.

504
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,794
- It's not fair.
- I won't bother you with statistics.

505
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,993
But the unhappy husbands
of the world are crying for help.

506
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,589
They're crying for a chance
to get even.

507
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,196
It's time for a change.

508
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,310
And you have been chosen
to bring out that change.

509
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,436
Change? Out? Chosen me?
I'm...? Who chosen?

510
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,074
You've been chosen
by the head man.

511
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,874
- The head man?
- The head man.

512
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,675
The chairman of the board
of directors of all fairy godfathers.

513
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,919
And the Society for the Prevention
of Distorting the Truth in Fairy Tales,

514
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,998
and the Committee
for Sanity of Married Men.

515
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,953
Chairman of the board?
You had a meeting?

516
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,197
A meeting?
Why, we argued like a summit.

517
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,996
- There were some against you.
- What did I do to them?

518
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,273
They thought the one chosen should
be tall, handsome and clever.

519
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,198
But I fought for you.

520
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,279
I said you were perfect for the task,
because you're ordinary.

521
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,359
You're not tall or handsome,
and you're anything but clever.

522
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,120
Thank you, Godfather,
for taking my part.

523
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,958
That's all right.

524
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,390
- I appreciate it.
- Would you?

525
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,434
No, thank you.
The filters make me cough.

526
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,157
So you are the one
who is going to settle the score

527
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,433
for all the downtrodden married men,
and when we finish,

528
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,996
married men will be able to look
their wives in the face -

529
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,398
that is, if they have their make-up on -
and put them in their place.

530
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,991
I can hear the husbands saying,
"Why wasn't I lucky like Fella?

531
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,636
"He's not handsome,
he's not tall, he's not clever,

532
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:57,039
"but he ended up married to
a beautiful princess, instead of you."

533
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,917
The men will be able to get even
for centuries of female abuse.

534
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,588
But best of all, the best part of it is

535
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,794
men and women will learn to be
happy with each other as they are.

536
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,869
I get it now. Ordinary people
will accept one another.

537
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,954
Ordinary people will be
satisfied with one another.

538
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,396
Yeah. Sure. They won't be looking
around for something better.

That's the idea.
