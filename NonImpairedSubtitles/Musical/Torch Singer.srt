1
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,714
$1.60, lady.

2
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,847
Well?

3
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,059
I've only got $1.55.

4
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,959
Oh, yeah?

5
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,296
All right, lady, give me
the $1 and keep the change.

6
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,967
But...
Listen, lady,

7
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:28,343
don't ever argue with a taxi
driver. Some of us is hard eggs.

8
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,574
I've had a couple
of kids me-self.

9
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,643
I know what it's like
to be a mother.

10
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,915
Thanks.

11
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,623
Good luck!

12
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,759
St. Anne's Hospital.
Room 46? Yes, hold the line.

13
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,110
Dr. Koenig sent me.

14
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,879
St. Anne's Hospital.
Mrs. O'Connor?

15
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,319
Yes. An 11-pound baby boy.

16
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,124
This way, please.

17
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,131
St. Anne's Hospital.

18
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,846
Be seated. Mother Angelica will
see you in just a few minutes.

19
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,189
Your name is Dora Nichols?

20
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,418
Yes.

21
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,326
And your address is
1014 Brooks Avenue, Bronx?

22
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,556
Yes.

23
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,156
And your husband,
Mrs. Nichols?

24
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,199
My husband was
killed two months ago.

25
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:04,004
I'm so sorry, my poor child.

26
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,308
And now, if you'll wait
outside a few minutes.

27
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,240
Scared?

28
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,940
Stiff.

29
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,986
You and me both.
Ain't women darned fools?

30
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,519
Will you come in, please?

31
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,614
Yes.

32
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,596
Your name is Sally Trent?

33
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,902
Yes.

34
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,604
Your address is
816 East 97th Street?

35
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,169
Yes.

36
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,874
And your husband?

37
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,817
I haven't any husband.

38
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,555
You'll have to give me the
name of the baby's father.

39
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,327
No, I'd rather not.

40
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,024
I'm afraid I must insist.

41
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:41,737
I'm sorry, I'll have
to go somewhere else.

42
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,473
Sit down, my child.

43
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,983
Good.

44
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,651
And how are you
feeling this morning?

45
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,252
Swell!

46
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,092
Think you'll care
for a little breakfast?

47
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,188
What have you got?

48
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,664
What would you like?

49
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,826
Have you got
any cantaloupe?

50
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:09,925
I think so.

51
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,300
Some cantaloupe,
ham and eggs,

52
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,465
and some toast that
should be buttered.

53
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,241
And some gooseberry jam.

54
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,609
We must have plenty to eat.

55
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,310
I hope the Trent girl pulls
through. It's such a nice baby.

56
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,985
Don't leave me, Mike!

57
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,590
Don't leave me, Mike!

58
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,457
Don't go!

59
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,123
Isn't there anything more
you can do for her, Doctor?

60
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,292
Mike!

61
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:47,465
What she needs is a new body
with some strength to it and Mike.

62
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,541
Come closer.

63
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:52,936
Mike.

64
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,076
Mike.

65
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,321
Mike.

66
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,050
It isn't a Mike.
It's a Sally.

67
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,344
Why couldn't you
have been a boy?

68
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,959
This world's such a tough
place for a girl to come to.

69
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,864
Good morning, everybody!
Good morning.

70
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,035
Hello.
Hello, Dora.

71
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,839
And how are all the little
mothers this morning?

72
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,903
Just fine.
That's good!

73
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,186
And where is my son?

74
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,620
I'll get him for you.

75
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,749
Well, we are all set, kid.

76
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,985
Did you find an apartment?

77
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,427
Did I? Wait till you
see it! It isn't so big,

78
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,522
but it's a lovely
neighborhood for the children,

79
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,626
and the view as far
as your eyes can see.

80
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,261
The river?

81
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,363
No, garbage cans.

82
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,573
Dora, I hate to
sponge off you like this.

83
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,209
Don't be dumb.
I got a job to go back to.

84
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,946
Well, I'll have one
before long.

85
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,079
There'll be a lot of
shows opening soon.

86
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,816
Sure there will.

87
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,122
Besides, honey, you know
nothing about babies,

88
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,094
and I know
nothing about babies,

89
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,426
so we got to stick together!

90
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,297
He's all ready, Dora.

91
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,130
Oh, no, he isn't!

92
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,537
Not again!

93
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,543
He's wonderful that way.

94
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,678
What's the bow-wow doing?

95
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:20,652
Sally's not going to cry.
No, Sally's a big girl now.

96
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,456
She loves
to take her bath. Yes.

97
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,902
There, it'll be
all over in a minute.

98
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,136
Yes, and it'll feel so good.

99
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,369
There.

100
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,913
Where's my soap?
Bobby, where's my soap?

101
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,324
Where's... Here it is!

102
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,386
There's the soap. Yes, there.

103
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,432
Did you see
Bobby steal the soap?

104
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,023
Did you see
that naughty boy?

105
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,537
There, there!

106
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,304
Now, it's all over.
It's all over.

107
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,777
It's all over, honey.
Up we go.

108
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,907
Come on. There!

109
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,782
It's all over. Look.

110
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,115
You're not gonna cry.

111
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,486
Look what
a good boy Bobby is.

112
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,117
He didn't cry one bit.

113
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,026
When Mommy comes home, I'm going
to tell her how good you've been.

114
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,495
Yes.

115
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,689
Look, and Sally's
such a big girl.

116
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,902
You lay off my daughter,
you little flirt!

117
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,509
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!

118
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:54,877
<i>Don't be a crybaby</i>

119
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,922
<i>But the boogeyman will get you</i>

120
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,463
<i>If you let him catch you</i>

121
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:09,467
<i>Starting to sing the blues</i>

122
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:15,998
<i>Don't be a crybaby</i>

123
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,678
Hello, Dora.

124
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,614
What's eating you?

125
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,088
The big stiff!

126
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,146
Who?

127
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,454
My boss,
the dirty old coconut!

128
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,651
What did he do?

129
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:41,159
He has been creeping up on me
for the past week.

130
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:45,067
Well, today, just when I
was getting ready to leave,

131
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,836
he makes a pass at me. I says,
"Take your hands off of me!"

132
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,036
He says,
"Don't act like that.

133
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,545
"How would you like to
come and see me tonight

134
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,478
"and play hide and seek?"

135
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,712
I says, "Listen, you,
you snake in the bush,

136
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,821
"if you and I
was Adam and Eve,

137
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,948
"I wouldn't go hide
and go seek you!"

138
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,788
Then I wallop him!

139
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,384
Oh, Dora!

140
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,330
When he open
his eyes, he says,

141
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,161
"How you like
me to fire you?"

142
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,225
I say, "You won't get a chance,
you big bozo, for I'm leaving. "

143
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,134
So I slammed the door
right in his nose.

144
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,297
What day is this?

145
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,669
Friday.

146
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,436
Good. I got fish.

147
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,641
Bobby!

148
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,717
Here, let me.

149
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,447
Oh, my goodness.

150
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,422
Now listen, boy, you'd
better hurry and grow up.

151
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,358
You might have to
support the whole family.

152
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,309
Hey, wait for me.
Come on!

153
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,395
I never heard
anything so preposterous!

154
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,403
You don't know
what you're asking.

155
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,268
Yes, I do.

156
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,209
I'm asking you to take care of
Michael's baby, his and mine.

157
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,678
I've tried to
do it myself.

158
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,409
I've tried
like the devil.

159
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,178
Don't mind me,
Miss Alden.

160
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,550
I'm liable to say much worse
before I'm through.

161
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,021
There's only one thing
I care about now,

162
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,650
to give my baby a chance.

163
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,785
Is that asking too much?

164
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,354
If my nephew is involved,
as you say he is,

165
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:30,801
why didn't you settle this matter
with him before he left for China?

166
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,667
I don't know.

167
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,002
Maybe I had
some pride then.

168
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,004
How do I know, Miss...

169
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,204
Trent, Trent.
Sally Trent.

170
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,581
How do I know, Miss Trent, that
your claims are to be believed?

171
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,211
Because...
Because I'm telling you.

172
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,350
Very true, Miss Trent, but a
woman I've never seen before

173
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,950
or even heard of!

174
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,656
And you'll never see or
hear of me again, I swear it!

175
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,598
I'll give up all claim
to my little girl.

176
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,295
I'll sign any kind
of a paper you like.

177
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:09,669
I'll even promise
never to see her again.

178
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,010
How do you like that,
Miss Alden?

179
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,071
How would you like never
to see your baby again?

180
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,583
There's some mistake,
Miss Trent.

181
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,449
I've never had a baby.

182
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,152
That's too bad.
It might do you some good!

183
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,692
It might soften you a bit!

184
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,890
Oh, no, no!
No, no, I'm sorry! I'm...

185
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,364
That's not what I
meant to say at all.

186
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,197
Please forgive me! Please!

187
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,668
And say you will take her.

188
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:43,333
I'm sorry, Miss Trent,
but I'm not interested.

189
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,644
Have you exhausted
every possibility?

190
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,817
Yeah, I even did that.

191
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:02,986
Well?

192
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,158
She wasn't interested.

193
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,733
Baby.
What became of Dora?

194
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,664
Baby.

195
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,565
Dora was swell to me,
but she lost her job,

196
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,613
and she decided to marry
a boy from out West.

197
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,776
Dora's the kind of girl that
some guy always wants to marry.

198
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,250
I get a lot of
proposals, too,

199
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,783
but marriage
isn't one of them.

200
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,224
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,464
Well, kid,

202
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,399
I'll be a seeing you.

203
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,598
Baby.

204
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,870
Sally, you understand
that if you give up your baby

205
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,211
it will be
completely and forever.

206
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,477
Sure I do!

207
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,719
Let's get it over with!

208
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,458
I'll go and get the papers
ready for you to sign.

209
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,528
I haven't been much
good to you, have I?

210
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,271
Maybe you...

211
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,011
Maybe you'll take a mother's
advice before she goes.

212
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,479
You might as well.

213
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,423
That's all she's
got to give you.

214
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,357
Don't ever let any man
make a sucker out of you.

215
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,864
Make them know
what you're worth.

216
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,901
Anything they get for nothing
is always cheap.

217
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,955
There's just
one thing, Mother.

218
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,120
Would you fix it so her name
will always be Sally?

219
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,898
It's sort of... It's sort of silly not
to know your own kid's name, isn't it?

220
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,834
Of course, my dear.
I promise.

221
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,023
Is that all?

222
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,024
That's all.

223
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,331
Baby. Baby.

224
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,314
<i>I only know</i>

225
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:25,830
<i>That I can't go on, darling</i>

226
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:32,135
<i>And here lies love</i>

227
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,801
Well, Miss Benton...

228
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,869
You don't have to say it.
I was terrible.

229
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,575
No, no, no.
Your voice is okay.

230
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,777
What you need is experience.

231
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,342
What kind of experience?

232
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,756
Well, you know, see something
of life, learn how to suffer.

233
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,319
A woman must suffer much
before she can sing a little.

234
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,360
I see.

235
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,266
Come back to me
in about a year.

236
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,502
All right.

237
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,099
In the meantime,
watch me suffer.

238
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,714
<i>It's a long dark night</i>

239
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:22,516
<i>Come on home, Daddy
'Cause I'm lonely and blue</i>

240
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,751
<i>You know I worry, Daddy
Won't you hurry?</i>

241
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,384
<i>Mama's waiting for you</i>

242
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,428
<i>Now you know it ain't right</i>

243
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:35,330
<i>To fool me, baby
'Cause I'm faithful and true</i>

244
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,665
<i>And I won't struggle
If you want to snuggle</i>

245
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,103
<i>Dear, I'm waiting for you</i>

246
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,738
<i>Although you've
kept me yearning</i>

247
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,041
<i>I hope my yearning is through</i>

248
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,480
<i>I've kept those
home fires burning</i>

249
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,452
<i>So give your devil her due</i>

250
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,957
<i>Come and hold me tight
You great big baddie</i>

251
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,825
<i>And do, do like you do</i>

252
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:08,264
<i>It's, oh, so cold out
I can hardly hold out</i>

253
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,099
<i>Still I'm waiting for you</i>

254
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,306
Miss Benton,
you are marvelous!

255
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,816
So you think I've
suffered enough, do you?

256
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,349
Waiter, bring me
a telephone, please.

257
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,727
I want you to be
hostess in my night club.

258
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,732
Are you tied up
here with a contract?

259
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,835
I'm not tied up anywhere.

260
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,702
I'm as free as
a bird on the wing.

261
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,036
CARLOTTl: Splendid!

262
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,069
Lend me your
pencil, please.

263
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,643
Thanks.

264
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,787
This is
Tony Cummings speaking.

265
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,318
Cummings, of the
American Radio Corporation.

266
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,594
I wonder if you'd care to
take luncheon with me tomorrow.

267
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,931
No, no, I'll stop by for you.

268
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,397
Why don't you ring me
at noon and verify this?

269
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,005
My number is
Vanderbilt 39970.

270
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,104
I look forward to it.

271
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,443
And now about terms.

272
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,784
Yes, terms.

273
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:42,657
But I warn you, I'm going
to cost you a lot of money.

274
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,057
That'll be okay.

275
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,361
<i>I'm a slave to you</i>

276
00:22:54,439 --> 00:23:00,139
<i>Don't you want
the heart I gave to you?</i>

277
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:06,048
<i>You can have me if you want me
But you must be mine alone</i>

278
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:12,057
<i>Give me liberty
or give me love</i>

279
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:16,356
<i>You're so dear to me</i>

280
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,725
I wish I was like that.

281
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:18,922
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

282
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,123
If you were,
I'd smack you down.

283
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,497
<i>When you're near to me</i>

284
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,058
<i>You can have me
if you want me</i>

285
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,765
Carlotti, she is superb.
Yes.

286
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,170
<i>But you must be mine alone</i>

287
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,640
I give her her chance.

288
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:35,078
<i>Give me liberty
or give me love</i>

289
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:44,948
<i>I'm only a slave to you</i>

290
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:52,220
<i>Now you can have me
if you really want me</i>

291
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:57,024
<i>Give me liberty or love</i>

292
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:02,904
<i>You're so dear to me</i>

293
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:08,708
<i>When you are near to me</i>

294
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:14,513
<i>You can have me
But you must be mine alone</i>

295
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:19,614
<i>Give me liberty
or give me love</i>

296
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:25,791
<i>You've been kind of strange
Why the sudden change?</i>

297
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:29,630
<i>Do you want somebody new?</i>

298
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,464
<i>I'd be glad to share...</i>

299
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,096
How do you like her?

300
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,142
I don't care for any woman
as notorious as Mimi Benton.

301
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,734
What has her private
life got to do with it?

302
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,609
It isn't private.
It's a public scandal.

303
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,208
Well, Mrs. Judson, those stories
are very much exaggerated.

304
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,876
I want you both to meet her.

305
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:53,391
<i>Yours to have and hold
and call your own, dear</i>

306
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:59,260
<i>You can have me if you want me
But you must be mine alone</i>

307
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:05,065
<i>Give me liberty
or give me love</i>

308
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:11,803
<i>Give me liberty or love</i>

309
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:33,587
Of course you don't want
to dance with me, my dear.

310
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:37,726
Not with you, Andrew. You
have no rhythm in your soul.

311
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,703
However, if Tony
would care to join me...

312
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:45,471
Care? Why, Mrs. Judson, this is
one of the big moments of my life.

313
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,783
I'm Mimi Benton.
How do you do?

314
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,344
Miss Benton,
I'm afraid I'm all right.

315
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,118
I'm Andrew Judson of the
Judson Pure Food Corporation.

316
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,351
No!
Yes.

317
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,087
That's marvelous!

318
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,459
I've heard Tony
speak of you 100 times.

319
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,191
Yes?
Where is Tony?

320
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,699
He's fighting... I mean,
he's dancing with my wife.

321
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:13,898
Tony's very fascinating. Aren't
you afraid you'll lose her?

322
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,600
I don't think
there's a chance.

323
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,937
I've been asking Tony for weeks
to bring you up some evening.

324
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,876
Yeah? Well,
that's funny.

325
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,744
He never said
a word to me about it.

326
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,409
No? Poor Tony!

327
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,745
He's such a jealous boy.

328
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:34,315
Jealous of me?
That's nonsense.

329
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:38,123
Look here, I'm giving a little
party tonight. Tony'll be there.

330
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,788
Don't you want
to come over?

331
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,559
I'd love to, but...

332
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:47,037
Bring Mrs. Judson, of course,
yes, if you think she'll be amused.

333
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,199
She wouldn't. No, she
wouldn't. I'm sure she wouldn't.

334
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:55,479
You come up anyhow.
I've so wanted to meet you.

335
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,208
Say yes.

336
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,712
Say yes?

337
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,344
Yes.

338
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,183
I want you to tell me all about
Pure Foods. We'll talk until dawn.

339
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:12,958
I don't stay up that late
on account of my lumbago.

340
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,022
Lumbago?

341
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,170
I have something
grand for lumbago.

342
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,864
Yes?
Yes.

343
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,433
I'll fix you up.

344
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,512
I am Edwardo Pasquale of
the Baltimore Opera Company.

345
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,516
I must see the big man from
the radio, Mr. Cummings.

346
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,676
Good afternoon, Miss Benton.

347
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,776
Hello, Helen.

348
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,821
I'm sorry, but Mr.
Cummings is busy.

349
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,384
Hello, Dorothy. Mr. Cummings
is busy, Miss Benton.

350
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,050
All right. Well, you
just tell him I'm here,

351
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,890
and I'll wander around.
All right.

352
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,361
I don't think he's
telling me the truth.

353
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,932
Excuse me.

354
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,596
Yes? Who?

355
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,697
My apologies to Miss...

356
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,673
Tell the young lady I'll see
her in just a moment. Thank you.

357
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,008
I want to know
everything that happened.

358
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,479
Well, Mrs. Judson,

359
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,483
Mimi spent the entire evening
treating your husband's lumbago.

360
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,246
I hope I never
have the misfortune

361
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,946
to encounter that
wretched creature!

362
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,784
Forget it, Julia.

363
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,758
We came here to listen to our
first Pure Foods' broadcast,

364
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,295
not to talk
about Miss Benton.

365
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,354
Will you pardon me just
a moment? Why, certainly.

366
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,490
Thank you.

367
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,172
Tony, darling!
What's the matter?

368
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,003
What brings you
down here so early?

369
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,544
The Judson
Pure Food broadcast.

370
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,811
Juddy told me all
about it last night.

371
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,076
You know me,
anything for a laugh.

372
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,947
He didn't ask you
down here, did he?

373
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,214
Well, yes and no.

374
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,653
Is that so?

375
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,520
Well, you'd better make
yourself scarce around here.

376
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,024
Mrs. Judson's
in there with him.

377
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,526
Oh, goodie!
I want to meet her.

378
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,788
No, you don't, Mimi.
Come on now.

379
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:51,920
Yes, I do.

380
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,204
Hello, Miss Benton.
Hello.

381
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,381
What goes on here,
a marathon race?

382
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,748
She's an expert in
child psychology.

383
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,811
In a few seconds, she's facing
the mike for the first time.

384
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,858
It looks as if she's
facing a firing squad.

385
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,355
Hello. Miss Spaulding, time to go on.

386
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,867
Now, now...

387
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,700
That's not going to bite you.

388
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,173
You go in there
and knock them cold!

389
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,769
If only I could knock them
as cold as I am right now.

390
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,005
Go on.

391
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,915
Little boys and girls
of Radioland,

392
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,982
you are going to hear
the first program

393
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,027
we are sending
you by Aunt Jenny.

394
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,223
Now, Aunt Jenny is going to
tell you all about lovely Oatina,

395
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,823
made by the Judson
Pure Foods Company.

396
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,493
Aunt Jenny will
sing you songs,

397
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,333
tell you stories and
play games with you,

398
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,373
just like your own auntie.

399
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,203
Here she is, kiddies.

400
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,305
Good evening...

401
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,712
little children.

402
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:29,158
This is your Aunt...

403
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,689
No, no.

404
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,098
Here I am, darlings,
your Aunt Jenny.

405
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,106
You know what
interrupted me just now?

406
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:47,975
A big dragon sneaked up behind
me and grabbed me by the shoulder.

407
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,877
"Listen here,
Aunt Jenny," he said,

408
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,246
"you can't talk to
all those boys and girls

409
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,649
"because maybe
some of them have been bad,

410
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,187
"and the bad ones
belong to me. "

411
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,951
<i>So I said to him,
"What do you mean, bad?</i>

412
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,653
<i>"Maybe some of them are naughty
once in a while, but who isn't?"</i>

413
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,253
When I was a little girl,
I was pretty naughty myself,

414
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,731
but no bad dragon ever got me.

415
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,324
And do you know why?

416
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:14,337
<i>Because I always ate Oatina,
so you see...</i>

417
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,849
It makes everybody
feel like singing,

418
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,084
and there's nothing dragons
hate so much as a song.

419
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:38,185
So just to spite that old
grouch, I'm going to sing.

420
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,958
You're wanted in
the control room immediately.

421
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,226
Tell him I'll be there
in a minute. Yes, sir.

422
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,308
<i>And now,
good night, children.</i>

423
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,208
<i>Be sure and tune in
again tomorrow night</i>

424
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,541
and hear Aunt Jenny.

425
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,012
This program
has come to you

426
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,572
through the courtesy of
the Judson Pure Foods Company,

427
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,312
sponsoring Oatina.

428
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,786
That was marvelous!

429
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,584
Congratulations,
my dear Tony.

430
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,591
The woman you picked
for Aunt Jenny is a winner.

431
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,854
Thanks. Such refinement and such charm.

432
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,091
I always say you can tell a
true gentlewoman by her voice.

433
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,029
Have her in, Mr. Cummings.
I must meet her.

434
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,999
Yes, by all means.

435
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,969
With this woman at the microphone,
Oatina should be a sensation.

436
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,436
A positive sensation!

437
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,708
What's the matter, Andrew?
Nothing.

438
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,771
Yes, Tony, we must meet her, by
all means, but some other time.

439
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,112
Come, dear, I have a very,
very important engagement.

440
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,776
I'm sorry you have to go.
So am I.

441
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,410
Goodbye, Mrs. Judson.

442
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,079
Can't you have
dinner with us tonight?

443
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,714
Sorry, I'm sponsoring
a new program.

444
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,281
I'm so sorry.
Another night soon?

445
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,348
I'll be very glad to.

446
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,792
Goodbye.

447
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,159
Goodbye, Tony.
Goodbye, Juddy.

448
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,537
"Such refinement!
Such charm!"

449
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,437
I suppose you know
what you've done.

450
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,636
Sure, I've been
having the time of my life.

451
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,009
I could kill you.

452
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,311
You could?
That's gratitude.

453
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,375
Where would your Pure Foods
hour be if it weren't for me?

454
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,943
Mimi, dear,
you were wonderful,

455
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,012
but you've got to
understand my position.

456
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,216
What is it?

457
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,588
Supposing word
got around that

458
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,524
the most notorious
torch singer in town

459
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,084
was broadcasting to kiddies.

460
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,220
Well, who's going
to tell them?

461
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,321
That's not the point.

462
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,300
Listen, boy, I only tell
bedtime stories to grownups.

463
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,030
Now, come on, I've wasted
enough time around here.

464
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,196
But, Mimi, listen,
you've got to be reasonable.

465
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,205
Take me to 21.
Mimi, don't you understand?

466
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,002
What's going to...
No!

467
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,145
Good morning, Carrie.

468
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,847
Well, in the name of say,
you can't come in here!

469
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,149
I'm in, Carrie.

470
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,681
No, sir, Mr. Cummings. I
wouldn't take the responsibility

471
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,854
of trying to get Miss Benton up out
of bed at this hour of the morning.

472
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,260
No, sir.

473
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,959
I wouldn't have it
on my conscience.

474
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,701
See what you can do. Yes,
sir, Mr. Cummings. I sure will.

475
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,391
Miss Benton.

476
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,890
Miss Benton, honey.

477
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,197
Time you was getting up, sweetie lamb.

478
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,867
What time is it?

479
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,111
Land sakes, honey,
it's going on 1:00.

480
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,913
Why, you!

481
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,719
Miss Benton, don't
throw that clock at me.

482
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,056
Mimi, it's Tony.

483
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,363
So that's who it is!

484
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,135
Waking up people in
the middle of the night,

485
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,231
who does he think
he is, Paul Revere?

486
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,606
I'll tell that one
where to get off!

487
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,201
Why, you big...

488
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,238
Pure Foods!

489
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,212
Listen, Mimi, we... I wouldn't
listen to Gabriel's trumpet

490
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,913
before I've had my coffee.

491
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,580
Coffee?
No, thanks.

492
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,318
Juddy? No, thanks. I believe not.

493
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,416
Carrie!

494
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,621
What do you want, honey?
Coffee before I murder you.

495
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,186
Coming right in,
sweetie lamb.

496
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,094
Mimi, will you listen to me
for just one second?

497
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,501
Sure I will. Why don't
you say something?

498
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,697
It's about your broadcast.

499
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,830
What about it?

500
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,432
Mr. Judson and I want you
to continue as Aunt Jenny.

501
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,840
That's a panic, Tony!

502
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,442
This is not a joking matter.

503
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,420
Why, Mimi,
you were a sensation.

504
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,388
Telegrams, letters and the
telephones we've received.

505
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,891
Are you two boys
trying to kid me?

506
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,824
I was never more
serious in my life.

507
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,227
If the Judson Pure Food hour
is to continue,

508
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,822
Miss Benton,
we simply must have you.

509
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,231
Take a look at
this contract, Mimi.

510
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,895
I'm sure you'll be pleased
with the terms, Miss Benton.

511
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,165
Now, look, every day
at 5:00 you broadcast

512
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,639
in the studio for
only 15 minutes.

513
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,505
Not me!

514
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,671
What?

515
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,974
Studio's out.

516
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,381
You have to bring the
microphone to my apartment.

517
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:30,284
Now, Mimi, be reasonable.
You know that's impossible.

518
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,289
What do you mean? It's not
impossible for opera stars, is it?

519
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,188
Anything that's good
enough for a prima donna

520
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,853
is good enough for
this prima donna!

521
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,191
Now, listen, Mimi dear.

522
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:43,199
No. If I'm going to
tell bedtime stories,

523
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,701
I'll tell them
from my own bed.

524
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,941
Excuse me, Miss Benton, but the
men have come about your radio.

525
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,408
There's nothing
the matter with my radio.

526
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,638
They've got the wrong
apartment. Send them away.

527
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,874
Wait a minute.
Send them in.

528
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,578
Have you forgotten?
You've got a broadcast.

529
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,175
Broadcast?
Well!

530
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,221
What do you mean, broadcast?

531
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,653
Yes! What are you trying to do,

532
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,054
put one over on us?

533
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,989
Well, what is
this all about?

534
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,891
Listen, children,
I've got a surprise for you.

535
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,429
You'd better hang around.

536
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,430
I've got a new racket.

537
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:19,231
I'm telling bedtime stories for
the Judson Pure Foods Company.

538
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,967
All right, boys,
set it up in the other room.

539
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,703
MIMl: Look at her,
she's dying.

540
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,148
Come on, kids, out, out.

541
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,843
You can't stay here
while Mimi's broadcasting.

542
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,250
Come on.
Don't be like that!

543
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,344
Come on,
gather around, children.

544
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,219
Your Aunt Jenny's
going to tell you fairy tales.

545
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,522
One, two, three, four.
Okay.

546
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,357
Everything all set, Harry?
All right, Mr. Cummings.

547
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,954
All right, Mimi. Here's
your script, Miss Benton,

548
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,192
and the lullaby.

549
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,393
Lullaby?

550
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,596
All ready.

551
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,730
Listen, if you think I'm
going to say this, you're nuts.

552
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,331
Give me a drink,
somebody, will you?

553
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,638
I'm so nervous!

554
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,201
Quiet, please!

555
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,811
Little boys and girls of
Radioland, here we are again,

556
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:10,115
and here comes Aunt Jenny who's
going to talk to you, sing to you

557
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,178
and tell you some
more about Oatina.

558
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,383
Here she is, boys and girls.

559
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,718
Good evening, my darlings.

560
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,560
Your Aunt Jenny
almost didn't get here

561
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,964
to talk to you
this afternoon.

562
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,627
Do you remember
that green dragon

563
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,637
I was telling you
about yesterday?

564
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,141
Well, he followed me
right up to the studio.

565
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,768
He's here now,
my darlings,

566
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:38,008
and he brought along with him
a lot of very naughty boys

567
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:42,746
who are determined to spoil Aunt
Jenny's program. But they won't.

568
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,583
No, they won't.

569
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,455
Naughty boys have often tried
to tease your Aunt Jenny.

570
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,893
Sometimes they've teased her
till she had to give in,

571
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,463
but she won't
this afternoon.

572
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,124
And do you know why?

573
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,900
Because Aunt Jenny has a dish
of lovely Oatina in her hand.

574
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:07,738
I want you all to try it. You'll be
surprised how it'll make you grow.

575
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:14,279
And now, my darlings,
it's bedtime for most of you,

576
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,152
so Aunt Jenny is going to
sing you a good night song.

577
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:32,568
<i>Baby's boat's
the silver moon</i>

578
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:37,968
<i>Sailing in the sky</i>

579
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:43,436
<i>Sailing over the sea of sleep</i>

580
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:49,750
<i>While the clouds float by</i>

581
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,584
<i>Sail, baby, sail</i>

582
00:39:55,326 --> 00:40:00,025
<i>Out upon that sea</i>

583
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:06,699
<i>Only don't forget to sail</i>

584
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:14,210
<i>Back again to me</i>

585
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:23,381
<i>Baby's boat's the silver moon</i>

586
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,011
<i>Sailing in the sky</i>

587
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,717
I tell you, Mike,
I've combed this old town.

588
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,158
I've talked with every theatrical
manager of my acquaintance,

589
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,956
and I can't find
a trace of her.

590
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:36,125
Well, that may be, but a girl can't
just disappear off the face of the Earth

591
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,134
and not leave some
trail behind her.

592
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,430
You'd be surprised!

593
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,937
I've employed hundreds
of girls in my shows

594
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,974
and all sorts of things
happen to them.

595
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,837
One out of 100
gets to the top.

596
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,104
Some stick
in the chorus

597
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,375
and some get married and
lose their identity that way.

598
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,440
That's what I thought would be the
fate of Sally Trent when she met you.

599
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,811
At least, I hoped it would.
She was a swell kid.

600
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,149
One of the best.

601
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,587
You know, every time I get
near one of those radios,

602
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,422
I have to listen to one of
those confounded bedtime hours.

603
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,428
Would you mind...
Sure.

604
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,457
Thanks.

605
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:11,060
Mike, what happened?

606
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,700
Well, I was just
a plain fool, that's all.

607
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,739
You see, I had to leave
for China in a hurry.

608
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,171
Instead of marrying
her then and there

609
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,471
and taking her with me,
I went alone.

610
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,637
Then, when I did write, asking
her to join me, I got no reply.

611
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:26,410
My letters were returned. No
such person known living there.

612
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,082
You know, I'd give anything
if I could find her.

613
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,691
I'll try again, old man.

614
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,996
Mr. Cummings sent
these letters over.

615
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,635
All right, Dolly,
that's swell. Thanks.

616
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,631
Read them out.

617
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,344
Sugar, looks to me like
you've gotten to be famous.

618
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:57,641
You bet your life.

619
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,980
Known from coast to coast
as "Everybody's Auntie!"

620
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,848
"My dear Aunt Jenny.

621
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,686
"My nephew and I are crazy
about you on the radio.

622
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,251
"Your voice comes over
like a million dollars.

623
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,626
"I would dearly love
to meet you sometime.

624
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,397
"Hopefully, Uncle Edgar. "

625
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,708
"Dear Aunt Jenny.
I am a little girl.

626
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,338
"I am five years old.

627
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:35,147
"I like you, Aunt Jenny. You
sing pretty, too, Aunt Jenny.

628
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,780
"Well, goodbye,
Aunt Jenny. Sally. "

629
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,086
That one's kind
of sweet, ain't it?

630
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,682
Let me see.

631
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,322
"Dear Aunt Jenny... "

632
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,127
That's enough.
Never mind. Never mind.

633
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,523
Hello.
Hello.

634
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,092
I'm looking for
a little girl named Sally.

635
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,604
My name is Sally.
What's your name?

636
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,067
My name's Aunt Jenny.

637
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,609
Did you get my letter,
Aunt Jenny?

638
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,201
Yes, darling.

639
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,104
I used to have a little girl
once whose name was Sally.

640
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,548
Was she black
like me, Aunt Jenny?

641
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,917
Darling, it was so long ago,
Aunt Jenny wouldn't remember.

642
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,054
Guess what I've got here.

643
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,421
Candy.

644
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,960
That's right.
Would you like some?

645
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,311
Aunt Jenny, that's swell.

646
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,151
Aunt Jenny,
will you tell me a story?

647
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,417
Yes, darling.
You bet I will.

648
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,119
Now, let's see.

649
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,186
Once upon a time...

650
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:48,216
Keep the party clean,
whatever you do.

651
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,719
Mimi! Hello!

652
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,782
Boy, are we having fun!

653
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:58,316
Listen, kids, listen.

654
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:01,523
I've got to broadcast,
and I'm so darned tired now.

655
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,690
Be nice and
clear out, would you?

656
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,131
Come on,
don't be like that.

657
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,726
We want to stay!
Yeah, we want to stay.

658
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,601
All right, then stay.

659
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,441
I don't want to
seem inhospitable,

660
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,445
but as long as you're here
there'll be no broadcast.

661
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:17,605
Well!

662
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,842
Let's go down to 22. We've been
put out of better places than this.

663
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,680
That's a very good idea.
Come on, everyone.

664
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,918
Hello, Tony!
Hi, Tony!

665
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,986
Say, you'd better be careful.
We just got thrown out.

666
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,258
What's happened?
What's the matter?

667
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,594
Come on, kids. Say, how
does she get that way?

668
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,100
Where's Mimi?
When they get famous,

669
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,362
they all get that way.

670
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:43,372
Never mind, forget it. We'll have
a lot of fun before the day is over.

671
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,515
Hello, Tony.

672
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,120
What's the matter, dear?

673
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,484
I had a shock
this afternoon, Tony.

674
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,963
One of those
letters you sent over

675
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,090
was from a little
girl named Sally.

676
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,764
Well, what about it?

677
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,699
That was the
name of my kid.

678
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,821
All of a sudden you remember
you're a mother.

679
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,784
Well, strange as
it may seem to you,

680
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,659
I've never forgotten it.

681
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:44,030
I gave her up four years
ago completely and forever.

682
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:48,670
Those were the conditions.
I've lived up to them.

683
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,766
But now I've got to
do something about it.

684
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,437
Tony, I didn't
realize it at first,

685
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,913
but every time
I broadcast, maybe...

686
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,283
Maybe I'm talking
to my own kid.

687
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:06,045
That letter today signed
Sally, don't you see?

688
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,287
I'm sorry, Mimi dear.

689
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,721
If you're suggesting
using the radio

690
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,887
as a means of
finding your child,

691
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,627
it can't be done.
It's out of the question.

692
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,668
Well, what do you mean?

693
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:21,636
Don't you understand?
You're a torch singer.

694
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,974
I'll give it up. Carlotti can
find someone else to take my place.

695
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,675
I'll tell him tonight.

696
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,912
Even if you give it up,
you're still Mimi Benton.

697
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,481
I'm sorry, dear.

698
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,523
I hate to be so
blunt about it,

699
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:43,890
but business is business.
You understand that, Mimi?

700
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,654
I see.

701
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,496
All right, Miss Benton.

702
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,830
That's what I am?

703
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,706
Just a voice.

704
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,909
All right, Tony,
a contract's a contract.

705
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:05,210
I'll never do anything
to embarrass you,

706
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,409
but I'm going
to find my kid.

707
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,287
And now I have
a surprise for you.

708
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:18,318
I don't know of anything that little
girls and boys love so much as a birthday,

709
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,421
so Aunt Jenny has plans
for a birthday club.

710
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,961
Right here
on the table beside me

711
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,094
there's a great big hat
filled with hundreds of names.

712
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,271
I'm going to
close my eyes tight,

713
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,332
and I'm going to draw the name
for our first birthday club.

714
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,672
Just a moment now.

715
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,008
Here we are.

716
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,415
And what name do you suppose
Aunt Jenny has drawn?

717
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,044
Sally!

718
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,521
I want all the little
girls named Sally

719
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,115
to write in and tell
me their birthdays.

720
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,819
That's very important,

721
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,953
and don't forget
your addresses,

722
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,260
because you're
going to get a doll.

723
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,994
Aunt Jenny's going to have
a special doll made,

724
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,037
just the loveliest
doll you ever saw.

725
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,503
And now, my darlings, I'm
going to sing you a little song

726
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,135
that I used to know
a long time ago.

727
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:20,290
<i>Don't be a crybaby</i>

728
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:25,427
<i>You've nothing to lose</i>

729
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:29,423
<i>But the boogeyman will get you</i>

730
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,024
Hey, Mickey,
let's go out and play.

731
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:37,437
<i>Starting to sing the blues</i>

732
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:43,971
<i>Don't be a crybaby</i>

733
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:49,575
<i>Whatever may be</i>

734
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:53,687
<i>'Cause I never will desert you</i>

735
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:57,090
<i>Nothing's going to hurt you</i>

736
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,429
<i>You can depend on me</i>

737
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:09,829
<i>You can depend on me</i>

738
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:18,341
<i>You can have me
But you must be mine alone</i>

739
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:23,409
<i>Give me liberty
or give me love</i>

740
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,821
<i>You've been kind of strange</i>

741
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,620
<i>Why the sudden change?</i>

742
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,928
<i>Do you want somebody new?</i>

743
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:39,367
<i>I'd be glad to share
All of your grief and care</i>

744
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:40,630
Sally!

745
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:45,771
<i>But never will
I ever share you</i>

746
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:51,011
<i>I'll be all your own, dear</i>

747
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:57,013
<i>Yours to have and hold
and call your own, dear</i>

748
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:02,851
<i>You can have me if you want me
But you must be mine alone</i>

749
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,625
<i>Give me liberty
or give me love</i>

750
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,127
Mimi Benton!

751
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:16,004
<i>Give me liberty or love</i>

752
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,177
Where you going?
Where do you think?

753
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,717
Come in.

754
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,299
Well, look who's here!

755
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,239
I hear you've been away.

756
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,671
The trip must have done you
a world of good.

757
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,608
You look simply swell.

758
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,374
Sally.

759
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,439
So you remember the name!

760
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,783
Do tell me about China.

761
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,482
It's a beautiful country,
I hear.

762
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,992
Is it so, or is it so and so?

763
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,688
What's happened
to Sally Trent?

764
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,862
Sally Trent?

765
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,123
Let me think.

766
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:23,635
Please stop acting.
You know I loved you.

767
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,169
Oh, no!

768
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:35,483
I can't believe that Michael
Gardner, Boston's gift to China,

769
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,817
could ever have loved that
shabby little chorus girl.

770
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,686
Well, I'll tell you
what happened to her.

771
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:43,920
While you were touring China,
she went through hell!

772
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,462
It's a nice place.
You must go there someday.

773
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,191
It's all right, Mike.

774
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:52,326
I got along without you then, and
I can get along without you now.

775
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,769
Darling, listen to me.

776
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,364
I love you a thousand times
more than I ever did before.

777
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,033
Does that mean
anything to you?

778
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,305
Yes, indeed!

779
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:07,343
There's nothing this world needs
so much as love, love, more love!

780
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,312
What do we talk about now?

781
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,684
I want to hear
about you, Sally.

782
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,382
Aren't you nice?

783
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,982
There isn't anything a woman likes
as well as talking about herself,

784
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,925
especially when
there's so much to tell.

785
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,257
Let me see, now.

786
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,764
Oh, yes,
I changed my name.

787
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:26,131
I got sick of being Sally Trent,
so I switched to Mimi Benton.

788
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,137
It's a nice name,
don't you think?

789
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:32,574
And then... Oh, yes,
I almost forgot to tell you.

790
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,543
I had a baby, not that
you'd be interested.

791
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,411
Yes, I had your child
in a charity ward!

792
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,086
I kept her with me
until things got so bad

793
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,124
I was afraid what
might happen to her.

794
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,886
Well, why didn't
you go to my family?

795
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,129
I thought of that, too.

796
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:58,591
Miss Agatha Alden of Beacon
Hill wasn't interested.

797
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:04,799
So I took her back where we
started, the charity ward,

798
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,468
and signed her away
just like that.

799
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,806
Well, where is this place?

800
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:11,278
You'd like to know,
wouldn't you?

801
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,575
I've got to know!

802
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,140
Well, make the rounds.

803
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,847
That's what Ihad to do before I
found one that would take me in.

804
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,014
I'm sorry, Sally.

805
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,250
I've made a lot
of rotten mistakes,

806
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,552
but I'm trying to
make up for them.

807
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:26,027
The first thing I did when I
got back was to try and find you.

808
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,893
I didn't expect
you to believe me,

809
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,933
but I did hope that
you'd meet me halfway.

810
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,469
You've changed, all right.

811
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,232
You're selfish, hard.

812
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,671
Sure I am.

813
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,334
Just like glass.

814
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:44,009
So hard nothing will
cut it but diamonds.

815
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,016
Come around someday with a
fistful, maybe we can get together.

816
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,832
I don't see how you could
have done it, Aunt Agatha.

817
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,596
But this girl had no means
of proving her claim.

818
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,138
How was I to know... You
could have taken a chance.

819
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,196
That having failed, at least
you could have cabled me.

820
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:16,234
I'm glad I didn't. A girl like this
Sally Trent would have ruined your life.

821
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:20,173
I was in a position to save
you, and I thank heaven for it.

822
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,683
That's fine.

823
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,680
The next time you go
in for rescue work,

824
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,984
pick out someone
who wants to be saved.

825
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,319
I don't.

826
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:31,554
I love Sally Trent,
and I'm going to win her back.

827
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,595
And I'm sending you a Sally
doll for your birthday.

828
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,296
With love and best wishes,
Aunt Jenny.

829
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,766
Is that your last one?
Yes, Miss Benton.

830
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,468
Excuse me, Miss Benton, but
Mr. Cummings is on the wire.

831
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:49,512
Well, you take the message,
Carrie. I'm busy.

832
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,247
Did you call
the express company?

833
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:56,581
Yes, Miss Benton. They'll be here
the first thing in the morning.

834
00:55:56,653 --> 00:56:00,714
Good. All right, girls, finish what
you're doing and we'll call it a day.

835
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:05,017
Excuse me. Mr. Seymour from
the detective agency is here.

836
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,723
Have him come in, please.
All right.

837
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,693
Hello, Mr. Seymour.
How do you do?

838
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,825
I've been waiting for you.

839
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:16,094
Have you got some
good news for me?

840
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,670
Here's your check from
the charity hospital.

841
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:20,903
What's the matter with it?

842
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,810
Mother Angelica won't take
any more of your money.

843
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,678
She says they're always glad
to have freewill offerings,

844
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,877
but she can't take bribes.

845
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,320
I can't go on taking your
money, either, Miss Benton.

846
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,384
Why not? I'm not
bribing you, am I?

847
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:41,897
I'm not saying you are, but
I can't help you anymore, see?

848
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,365
You haven't tried
very hard, I imagine.

849
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,335
I don't lay down on
any job, Miss Benton.

850
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,133
I haven't got
a ghost of a chance.

851
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,399
What do you mean?

852
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,941
I've turned this
town upside down,

853
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,943
and there's not
a trace of your child.

854
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:58,174
How do you know
she's in New York?

855
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,740
For all we know, she may be
in another part of the world.

856
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,946
For all you know,
she may even be dead.

857
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,699
Thanks for reminding me.

858
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,564
I didn't mean it that way.

859
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,071
I owe you
a week's salary, don't I?

860
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:24,163
You don't owe me anything.

861
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,605
Yes, I do.

862
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:28,542
Good night.

863
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,610
I'm sorry.

864
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,862
For all you know,
she may be dead.

865
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,647
Maybe he's right.

866
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,129
Aunt Jenny!

867
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,259
Bedtime stories!

868
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:28,403
What a laugh!

869
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,708
Carrie, give me a drink.

870
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:36,643
No, no, get me
my black velvet dress.

871
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:37,975
What are you
going to do, honey?

872
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,514
I'm going places!

873
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:40,947
Atta baby!

874
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,520
Little boys and
girls of Radioland,

875
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,055
I have some bad news
for you again.

876
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,784
It isn't likely that
Aunt Jenny will be here

877
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,725
to talk to you tonight at
5:00 as she is still ill.

878
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,657
However, we have
every hope that tomorrow

879
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,756
she will be
with us once more.

880
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,131
You don't seem to
realize, my dear Julia,

881
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,693
that if Miss Benton
continues to hide herself

882
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,604
we'll simply have to abandon
the Oatina program.

883
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:07,040
Well, I still think it's
very strange, Mr. Cummings,

884
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,635
that you can't find someone
else to take this woman's place.

885
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,009
My dear Mrs. Judson,

886
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,640
I have had 100 women up here
the last three days,

887
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,843
each one worse
than the one before.

888
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,079
There's only one Mimi Benton.

889
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,621
Well, that's something
to be grateful for!

890
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,021
Miss Benton needs us
much worse than we need her.

891
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,719
She's trying to make every
effort to find her child.

892
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:27,160
You know this Sally
birthday doll idea?

893
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,528
Why, only this morning, we received
a letter from a child which...

894
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,260
Well, it's too disgusting!

895
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,234
To think of that
disreputable woman

896
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:36,568
talking every evening to
America's dear little kiddies!

897
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:37,833
Rats!

898
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,774
She's an evil influence
invading a million decent homes!

899
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,037
More rats!

900
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:45,376
How would you like to have
such a creature in your home?

901
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:48,042
I'd love nothing better!

902
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,345
Yes?

903
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,980
Speaking. What?

904
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:57,258
They've found her. Where?

905
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:01,024
185 East. Certainly, I'll be
right over. You stay right there.

906
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,724
Okay.

907
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,596
Come on, Juddy.
Andrew Judson!

908
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,658
Are you going in search
of that dreadful woman?

909
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:09,933
Yes! And if I thought you'd be of
any earthly use, I'd drag you along.

910
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,132
What?

911
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,731
You don't know your luck.

912
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,778
That new mink coat you
have on, Mimi Benton.

913
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:18,313
Those diamond earrings,
Mimi Benton.

914
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,609
And if you want
to know the truth,

915
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:22,310
that dreadful woman
is all but keeping you!

916
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:51,645
Hello, Mimi.

917
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:57,408
Hi, Tony.

918
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,512
Sit down and have a drink.

919
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,522
Mimi, let's get out of here.

920
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,757
No.

921
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,391
What for?

922
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,062
Well, I don't
like this place.

923
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,107
That's right.

924
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,976
It's a terrible joint.

925
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,375
I know a swell
place over on...

926
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:31,783
You know, over on...

927
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,488
We'll ride around,
we'll we find it.

928
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,049
All right.

929
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:45,127
Who's this guy that's
got his arm around me?

930
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,862
That's Mr. Judson.

931
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,301
I think he's drunk.

932
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,913
I want to sit down.

933
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,881
Mimi, dear,
we've got to get you home.

934
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,951
What's the big idea? We've
got all day, haven't we?

935
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,018
What's the big idea?

936
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:16,190
Listen, dear,
I have a letter here.

937
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,324
I know some letters.

938
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,268
"A," "B," "C... "

939
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:24,636
No, but listen. This letter is
from a little girl named Sally.

940
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:25,969
Sally who?

941
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,510
Well, it's her birthday,
September 2nd.

942
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,705
It may be your little Sally.

943
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,246
September 2nd.

944
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:36,480
My Sally.

945
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,218
Come on, Mimi dear.
Pull yourself together.

946
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,191
You've got a broadcast
in less than an hour.

947
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:46,753
Yeah.

948
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,164
Yeah, I gotta.
Yeah. Come on, Tony.

949
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,329
Yeah.
Taxi.

950
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,039
Miss Benton, honey,

951
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,306
Carrie's brought you
some nice, hot, black coffee.

952
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,884
Take just one little sip,
won't you, honey?

953
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,418
I don't want coffee.

954
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,656
She'll never make it.

955
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,490
Oh, yeah?

956
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,058
What do you know about it?

957
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,867
Good evening,
little children of Radioland.

958
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:36,605
Have you had
your Oatina today?

959
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,613
This evening your
Aunt Elizabeth will...

960
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,546
Miss Spaulding,
just half a second, please.

961
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:42,413
How much time
have we got, Harry?

962
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,079
About a minute. All
right. Fine. Hold it.

963
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,123
Give me that, Carrie.
I'll take care of her.

964
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:52,484
Mimi, listen to me, dear.

965
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,229
Mimi, you're due on
the air any minute.

966
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,959
Come on,
pull yourself together.

967
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,127
Mimi, you said you'd never
let me down. Now, come on.

968
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,570
I'm trying.

969
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,100
Mr. Cummings,
we're due on the air.

970
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:16,013
All right, Harry.
Ready, Miss Spaulding.

971
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,621
Little boys and
girls of Radioland,

972
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,886
I'm sorry to keep disappointing
you about Aunt Jenny.

973
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,655
She wanted us to bring the
microphone to her bedside,

974
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:28,196
but the doctor
refused to allow it.

975
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,356
However,

976
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,559
I have a pleasant
surprise for you.

977
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,033
Your Aunt...

978
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:35,868
Your...
Your Aunt Jenny speaking.

979
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:40,375
I couldn't bear to be
away from you any longer,

980
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,412
so as soon as
the doctor left,

981
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:46,004
I got out of bed,
and here I am.

982
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:51,275
Yes, darlings.
I've been ill,

983
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:56,557
so I can't talk to you very
long, but before I say good night,

984
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:03,397
I want to wish a happy, happy
birthday to a little girl named Sally,

985
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,060
whose birthday
is September 2nd.

986
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:11,036
I have her letter here,
but there's no address.

987
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,840
Won't Sally please
call me on the telephone

988
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,904
as soon as
the broadcast is over?

989
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:25,548
The number is
Murray Hill, 29969.

990
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,187
I have such
a lovely doll to send,

991
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,354
but I must have the address.

992
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,163
Are you sure you have
the number, darling?

993
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:43,395
Murray Hill, 29969.

994
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:50,479
And now,
good night, my dears.

995
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:55,146
Aunt Jenny is so glad
to be back with you once more.

996
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,722
That's all for tonight,
boys and girls.

997
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,555
I know that you
are all glad to have

998
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,027
Aunt Jenny back
with you once more.

999
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:10,293
So be sure, children, to
tune in tomorrow at this hour

1000
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,527
for Aunt Jenny and
her Oatina program.

1001
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,432
Take it easy, Mimi.

1002
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,528
Give me a cigarette, Tony.

1003
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,298
I wonder why
she doesn't phone.

1004
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,672
She'll phone, dear.

1005
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:21,971
Maybe she won't.

1006
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:23,702
Maybe she's sick!

1007
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,407
Or she hasn't had
time to call, dear.

1008
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,647
Hello?

1009
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:34,518
What?
What number do you want?

1010
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:36,718
No, wrong number.

1011
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:40,221
Now, now... Tony, what if
she wasn't listening in?

1012
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,161
No, I'm sure she was
listening in. She was?

1013
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:44,222
Now, be patient, darling.

1014
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,660
Hello.

1015
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,364
Yeah?

1016
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:50,598
Hello?

1017
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,364
Yes, darling.

1018
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:55,901
Is this Sally?

1019
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,540
Now tell Aunt Jenny
where you live.

1020
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,280
No, no,
wait a minute, darling.

1021
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,117
I didn't hear you.

1022
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:10,056
Now, say it again,
very slowly, will you?

1023
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:14,789
85 East...

1024
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,563
Do you think
you'll be all right?

1025
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:18,930
Sure.

1026
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:21,834
Good luck.

1027
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,250
Hello, Daddy.

1028
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,452
Isn't it time little girls
were getting ready for bed?

1029
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,079
Not yet, Daddy.

1030
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:43,549
Do you know, the most wonderfulest
thing happened to me today.

1031
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,059
You could never guess.

1032
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,526
Come on, tell me.

1033
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:50,053
Aunt Jenny's coming to this
house specially to see me.

1034
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:51,258
Aunt Jenny?

1035
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,769
Beg pardon, sir, Aunt Jenny
is here to see Miss Sally.

1036
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,196
Daddy, you can go bring her
in while I fix my children.

1037
01:07:58,274 --> 01:07:59,639
All right.

1038
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,207
Sally!

1039
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:11,516
Well, I guess
the joke's on me.

1040
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,355
I don't know what miracle's
brought you here

1041
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,153
or what all this Aunt Jenny business
is, but now that you are here,

1042
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,352
I'm not going
to let you go.

1043
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,588
It's no use, Mike. I
didn't come here to see you.

1044
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,427
Forget me. There's a kid in
there who's waiting to see you.

1045
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,694
Don't disappoint her.

1046
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,292
Mike!
Yes.

1047
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:28,893
She's been here a week now.

1048
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,337
She belongs to me.

1049
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,068
I want to see her.

1050
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,419
Are you Aunt Jenny?

1051
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,017
Yes, darling.

1052
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,793
Hello, Aunt Jenny.
I'm Sally.

1053
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,492
Hello, Sally.

1054
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:03,766
Don't cry, Aunt Jenny.
This is my birthday.

1055
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,034
Aren't you going to kiss me?

1056
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:08,576
Yes, darling.

1057
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:20,954
Look, look at what Aunt Jenny
brought you, darling.

1058
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,595
She's beautiful!

1059
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:37,801
Thank you, Aunt Jenny.

1060
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:39,636
Sally. Sally, dear!

1061
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,276
I'm coming.

1062
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,112
Miss Thomas!
Look, Miss Thomas!

1063
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:51,449
Aunt Jenny brought me
the most beautifulest doll!

1064
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,852
Isn't that nice?

1065
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:56,448
Come on, darling.
We go to bed.

1066
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,083
Goodbye, Aunt Jenny.

1067
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,094
Goodbye, darling.

1068
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:01,789
Isn't she lovely?

1069
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:04,456
She's adorable,

1070
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,993
no thanks to me.

1071
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:09,127
No thanks to either of us.

1072
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:15,535
Don't go, darling. I've
got so much to say to you.

1073
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,135
There's someone out
there waiting for me.

1074
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,646
But I must talk to you.

1075
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:28,381
The maid says Michael
Gardner lives there, sir.

1076
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:31,989
The club.
Yes, sir.

1077
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:50,142
So you see, darling,
she needs both of us.

1078
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,547
I'll be the best
father to her I can,

1079
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,982
but I couldn't possibly
be a mother to her.

1080
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:01,750
Could I?
