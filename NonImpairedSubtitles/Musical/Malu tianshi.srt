Autumn 1935
In the world of Shanghai's underclass.

43
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,050
Xiaohong. Come here.

44
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,530
What do you think you were going to do?

45
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,050
Such a mature girl, with a wild spirit.

46
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:11,186
- What song do you want to hear?
- Anything is fine.

47
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,451
How about the "Song of Four Seasons", OK?

48
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,878
- Fine...fine, whatever.
- OK, OK.

49
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:42,633
<i>Springtime has arrived and
green fills the window.</i>

50
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:48,290
<i>Under the window the maiden
embroiders a pair of mandarin ducks.</i>

51
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:55,725
<i>Suddenly a ruthless blow</i>

52
00:07:56,538 --> 00:08:03,717
<i>Splits the ducks apart</i>

53
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:15,670
<i>Summer has arrived and
the willow fronds are long</i>

54
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:21,769
<i>The maiden drifts south of the river</i>

55
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:29,250
<i>The wind and sun is fine on
the south and north parts of the river</i>

56
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:36,325
<i>But how can it compare to
the green sorghum of home?</i>

57
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,673
<i>Autumn has arrived and
the lotus flowers are fragrant</i>

58
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:54,609
<i>Each night the maiden
dreams of her home town</i>

59
00:08:55,481 --> 00:09:02,427
<i>Waking up, she doesn't see
her dad and mom's faces</i>

60
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:10,234
<i>She only sees the bright moon
in front of her window.</i>

61
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:22,152
<i>Winter has arrived and
the snow is wide and vast</i>

62
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:28,216
<i>Winter clothes are mended and
sent to her husband</i>

63
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:35,581
<i>Flesh and blood built
the length of the Great Wall</i>

64
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:44,340
<i>I wish I could be Meng Jiang of those days</i>

65
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:48,127
That girl is really not bad.

66
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:50,253
You really like her?

67
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:54,772
- Yes
- I know the string player. Ah, Old Wang!

68
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:58,710
Yes, Old Chen...thank you.

69
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,171
- When did you get here?
- Please sit.

70
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,995
- Thank you.
- This is Mr. Gu.

71
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:08,422
- Oh, ah...
- That's right, the Mr. Gu.

72
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,422
Ah, I've wanted to meet you for a long time!

73
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,613
Mr Gu really enjoyed your song girl.

74
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:18,911
Oh, really? I'll call her over here.
Xiao Hong, come here.

75
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,726
- Greet Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

76
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,724
Really not bad!

77
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,035
Sit, take a seat.

78
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:48,836
- Hey, Lu.
- Hey, you scared me there.

79
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:51,287
- Whats up?
- You're such scaredy pants!

80
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:53,018
- You're half done?
- Yea, half done.

81
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:54,923
Nice smell.

82
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:59,105
- Hey boss, how's business?
- So-so.

83
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,112
OK, OK, enough shaving heads already.
Let's go to my place and have fun. Hurry up!

84
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:05,645
OK, OK.

85
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,698
I'm going out for a while.
Give him a careful shave..

86
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,555
Do a good job. You don't want to
hurt a person's head.

87
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:54,958
<i>Peaceful Lane</i>

88
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:21,978
- Monster, you scared him to death.
- Baby, don't be afraid.

89
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:25,707
The little darling heard your trumpet from far off,
so he knew you were on your way home.

90
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,356
Is that so? What a good baby!

91
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:31,806
Look, are Uncle's Chen's foreign clothes nice?

92
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,676
They're ugly!

93
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:36,383
Look, does Uncle Chen look like a foreign soldier?

94
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:41,262
Do I? Baby, I'll do some military drills
for you to see, OK?

95
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:45,235
Just watch me!
One, two, one, two.

96
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:46,908
Attention!

97
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:49,754
Little darling, let Uncle Chen hold you.

98
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:53,273
I won't hold him... I won't.
Let me kiss him.

99
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:55,504
Don't let him kiss you. He's got bad breath.

100
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:57,850
Don't let him kiss.
He's got bad breath, isn't that right?

101
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:18,191
She's gone downstairs.

102
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,583
The landlady seems to have a little thing for you.

103
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,290
'He's got bad breath, don't let him kiss you, don't let him.'

104
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,959
Ugh, lots of little hairs.

105
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:35,175
- Chen, how does she know if you have bad breath?
- Get out of here!

106
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:40,437
Like a foreign soldier indeed! Would a
foreign soldier have only this much left of his shirt?

107
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:52,356
OK, enough already. If you can't talk,
then try not to talk so much, OK?

108
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,651
- Chen, He's found a picture.
- Let's hang it up

109
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:03,426
- OK, but let me write something on it first.
- That's OK, I'll write.

110
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:05,426
Bring me a brush.

111
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,368
In the saying "Have prosperity shared,
Have difficulty beared", how do you write "difficulty"?

112
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,481
Idiot! Can't even write the character
for 'difficult'. I'm coming.

113
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:23,848
One, two, three. Three idiots!

114
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:25,939
- Let me do it.
- OK, You do it.

115
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:31,794
together...

116
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,467
shared.

117
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,467
Have...

118
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:36,999
difficulty

119
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,645
Difficulty...difficulty...difficulty...

120
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:45,723
Difficulty...difficulty...

121
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,650
Wang, how do you write the character for difficult?

122
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,703
Isn't 'difficulty' easy? It's about the same
as the character for chicken.

123
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,897
One side looks like the character 'beauty',
as in talented scholar and beautiful maiden...

124
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,592
and the other side is like the
"hai" in Shanghai. Oh, no...

125
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:03,694
Its like the "jin" in Tianjin...
no, that's not right either.

126
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:06,816
Slow down...

127
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:08,816
'Difficult'...'Difficult'

128
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:11,163
It's on the tip of my tongue.

129
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:14,671
Now I remember.

130
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,192
It was in yesterday's paper.

131
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:21,409
<i>The nation faces difficulties, so everyone
must stand up and take responsibility.<i>

132
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:22,942
Here it is.

133
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:30,063
See, look here, isn't this half of the character
beauty in 'talented scholar and beauty'?

134
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:35,407
But, that's not half of the 'hai' in Shanghai
and it isn't half of the  'jin' in Tianjin.

135
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:37,407
It's the 'Han' half of Hankou.

136
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:42,145
Although you got the place wrong,
you knew the character.

137
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,905
"Have prosperity together shared,
Have difficulty together beared"

138
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:51,473
Good. Here, take it.

139
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,634
Hey, look, a wireless telegram for you!

140
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:57,119
Be quiet. Hide.
Time for some tricks!

141
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,305
Xiaohong!

142
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:55,028
Look.

143
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:00,592
See how dirty it is

144
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:03,961
Such a big girl. You can't even do
something as little as this.

145
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:08,782
All you know how to do is eat!

146
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:15,159
What do you think of what I was
just telling you? What do you think?

147
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:18,331
Haven't I told you already?
I don't have any.

148
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:21,026
Lao Lao, your temper is back.

149
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:25,382
You know as well as I do how Gu has
deals going on all over Shanghai.

150
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:28,913
It wasn't easy to get a chance to meet him today.

151
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:33,781
I should go have a drink with him
and become friends. Right?

152
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,881
Come on, quick, give me the money!

153
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,322
Just like a ghost!

154
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,296
Skulking around without making a sound.

155
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:09,781
Not even a simple 3 tile straight!
Old Liu, you go ahead and play for me.

156
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,965
I might as well go home to sleep.

157
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:15,403
It's enough to drive one crazy.

158
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:29,668
Wait up! Why do you run away whenever
you see me? I did nothing wrong to you.

159
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:34,106
It was just that we weren't careful enough
and the old lady found about us.

160

She was jealous, she beat you, but 
what could I say about it, don't you think...

You leave with an empty pocketbook
and come back empty too!

164

What other dishes will you have?

199
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:52,148
Bring a sauteed tripe,
chicken fillets, and stir fried shrimp.

200
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:53,795
Anything else?

201

Go. Get lost!

203
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:03,753
I saw it, I saw it with my own eyes.

204
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,480
After they bought the fabric, they went
to a restaurant for some snacks.

205
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:12,868
I followed them up there too,
until the waiter chased me off.

206
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:15,574
I saw Xiao Hong, she was really happy.

207
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,634
When that fatty gave her some
cloth at the foreign fabric shop...

208
00:31:19,863 --> 00:31:21,076
...she was also very happy.

209
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:23,987
As soon as I saw that fatty,
I knew he was up to no good.

210
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:27,536
That's why I had Ah Bing follow him.

211
00:31:28,978 --> 00:31:31,965
See, my eyes weren't wrong when I saw it!

212
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,702
Enough already!
If you can't speak, then shut up.

213
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:20,080
- What do you want?
- Look.

214
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,982
Xiao Hong!

215
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:32,629
- I hate you!
- I hate you too!

216
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:34,629
- You shouldn't have...
- Why shouldn't I have?

217
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,493
- Let me go!
- I won't let you go!

218
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:40,219
- I'm going anyway!
- Ok, if you go, make sure you never come back!

219
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:43,255
Let go! Let go...

220

What are you doing?

221
00:35:07,044 --> 00:35:08,740
Put that down. You can't drink anymore!

222
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,895
Just let me be.

223
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:13,629
I'm too upset now. Just let me be.

224
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:18,427
No way. You're not much of a drinker.
You've drunk too much.

225
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:20,898
Put it down!

Leave me alone. You...

229
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:32,398
Look at yourself.
You're already drunk.

230
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,191

231
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,255

232
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:49,209

Why aren't you coming?

233
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,209
Come here!

234

236
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,238

so why won't she come down?

237
00:35:58,317 --> 00:36:00,722
- Chen!
- I just want her to come down.

238
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:05,796
- I want you to come down and sing.
- Chen!

239

Oh, right, right, right.

240
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,763
Xiao Hong, the guest asked you to
come down and sing. Didn't you hear?

241
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,837
What do you want sung?

242
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:22,265

I heard everything they said.

I also saw him give some money to ma.
They're selling me for sure.

- He gave her money?
- Money?

311
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:27,061
- What do you say we go see this one?
- OK, let's go see him.

312
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,638
Are you feeling better?

313
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:35,137
- That wasn't much of an illness anyway.
- OK, you come with us.

314
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:38,896
But how can we go like this?

315
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:43,353
No problem. I can wear my nice uniform.

316
00:46:43,353 --> 00:46:45,574
I'll say that I work at the Customs House.

317
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:47,810
And me...?

318
00:46:50,451 --> 00:46:51,778
You...

319
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:57,283
Take this cloth and say say you're a chauffeur.
Yes, you're my chauffeur.

320
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,784
Look, she's laughing.

321
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:05,359
- Laugh, laugh, laugh
- I didn't laugh

322
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,313
You didn't laugh?
Does he look like my chauffeur or not?

323
00:47:35,427 --> 00:47:39,073
Look, we're already standing above the clouds!

324
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:51,872
- This is really paradise.
- That's for sure.

325
00:48:00,674 --> 00:48:03,049
Paradise seems hotter than it was at home.

326
00:48:04,027 --> 00:48:05,704
Warm alright.

327
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:16,389
Mr Bao is in.

328
00:49:25,736 --> 00:49:27,133
Please have a seat.

329
00:49:36,858 --> 00:49:40,253
Have you come to file a complaint?

330
00:49:41,357 --> 00:49:43,970
No, we've come to sue.

331
00:49:49,475 --> 00:49:51,892
Filing a complaint means to sue.

332
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:58,179
Yes, yes, we've come to file a complaint.

333
00:50:01,672 --> 00:50:04,522
So what is the problem?

334
00:50:06,241 --> 00:50:09,049
He's my chauffeur. He...

335
00:50:18,033 --> 00:50:20,506
There's someone in his family...

336
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:22,812
Not my family!

337
00:50:23,622 --> 00:50:26,179
Yes, right, it's his...

338
00:50:38,894 --> 00:50:41,297
...one of his relatives, who...

339
00:50:42,317 --> 00:50:44,329
Not one of my relatives either!

340
00:50:47,808 --> 00:50:50,043
Well, then who is it?

341
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,802
It's about a, a neighbor.

342
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:58,832
I'm sorry, but according our practice, we charge
five ounces of silver for an hour of consultation, 

343
00:50:58,832 --> 00:51:01,221
fifteen for a legal document,

344
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:03,820
one hundred to arrange for a hearing in court,

345
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,321
and five hundred for an appearance
in court to represent a case.

346
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:08,500
I think perhaps you need to reconsider.

347
00:51:22,193 --> 00:51:24,275
Five hundred ounces of silver?

348
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,263
- How much money is five hundred ounces of silver?
- Damn, it costs money to bring a lawsuit!

349
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:32,546
I hadn't thought of that.

350
00:51:32,546 --> 00:51:34,546
Five hundred ounces of silver.

351
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,544
Damn, it costs money to bring a lawsuit!

352
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:43,822
I've never heard of this before.

353
00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:47,161
So what do we do now?

354
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,219
Don't panic. We'll think of something eventually.

355
00:51:52,345 --> 00:51:54,441
<i>Escaped Criminal Apprehended</i>

356
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,129
Hey. What about this idea?

357
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:11,011
Xiao Hong

358
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:16,251
- No, no, that's not a good way.

359
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:19,129
Silly, you have us, so what are you worried about?

360
00:52:19,129 --> 00:52:23,223
- And we have lots of friends willing to help out.
- That's right. We have lots of 'brothers-in-arms.' 

361
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:28,365
Quick. You go back first, and a little later, we'll
help you escape across the 'bridge' across the alley.

362
00:52:28,365 --> 00:52:29,888
OK, go back.

363
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:37,628
It's no good. This plan is no good.

364
00:52:41,862 --> 00:52:46,738
Don't worry. If anything goes wrong,
we can find our 'brothers' to help us out.

365
00:52:46,738 --> 00:52:49,029
They'll help us out for sure.

366
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:13,089
Escaping...

367
00:53:14,137 --> 00:53:16,191
...means she'll be living together with me!

368
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:27,487
Don't cry.

369
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,487
Go along with them.

370
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:33,676
They're all good people.
They'll never treat you bad.

371
00:55:34,794 --> 00:55:36,904
But what about you, sister?

372
00:55:37,994 --> 00:55:39,894
Me?

373
00:55:39,894 --> 00:55:43,331
They all dislike me.
They look down on me.

374
00:55:43,946 --> 00:55:45,455
I know.

375
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:49,646
Why don't you come with us?

376
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:54,578
No.

377
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:41,095
You're the one who's always out playing cards
and now you want to blame me?

378
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:44,144
Do you really want a man to
take care of domestic affairs?

379
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:49,217
Don't put on airs with me. Your
ambitions don't make us any money.

380
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:52,525
When I gamble, it's with my own money.

381
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:57,650
And you're the one who's been teaching that girl
to sing and taking her around to the wine houses.

382
00:56:58,156 --> 00:57:00,193
She's your responsibility!

383
00:57:00,868 --> 00:57:03,151
Fine, fine, let's not waste our
breath on this anymore.

384
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:19,447
Are you thinking about moving over to my side?

385
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:24,013
Our place is better, you know. We face
south and the rooms are bigger.

386
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:36,417
It's strange but last night those
two scoundrels moved out on the sly.

387
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:41,035
No conscience, them. But that
trumpet player is a nice man!

388
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:46,342
What trumpet player? I've never seen him.

389
00:57:46,342 --> 00:57:51,493
Don't pay any attention to that. You ought to
be asking Xiao Yun about this. She must know.

390
00:57:51,895 --> 00:57:54,697
Otherwise why would she
want to go across the lane.

391
00:57:55,177 --> 00:57:58,109
Ask her. You'll see if I'm right or not.

392
00:57:58,109 --> 00:58:00,109
Cheap slut!

393
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,792
No wonder you...Stop right there!

394
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,724
Where do you think
you're going? Get in here!

395
00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:12,705
Then I'll be off to tell Old Gu...

396
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,009
Close the door!

397
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:24,018
Come here!

398
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:28,144
If you don't tell me the truth,
I'll kill you right here and now.

399
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:31,388
Take off your clothes.

400
00:58:32,867 --> 00:58:34,229
Did you hear me?

401
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:37,940
Take off all your clothes.

402
00:58:40,924 --> 00:58:42,156
Quicker!

403
00:58:56,791 --> 00:59:00,631
Old Gu, would you like to eat a snack after
your bath or have something to eat now?

404
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:02,396
Hungry again, huh?

405
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,960
- Is Mr. Gu here?
- He's here. Just arrived.

406
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,490
Mr. Gu. So you're here.

407
00:59:13,229 --> 00:59:16,693
I've been looking all over for you.
It's terrible!

408
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:26,722
That little girl of mine, Xiao Hong.
Last night, she suddenly ran away.

409
00:59:26,722 --> 00:59:28,435
She ran away?

410
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:45,054
- Is it almost done?
- Just about, almost done.

411
00:59:45,054 --> 00:59:48,493
- Forget it! I can't stand sitting here anymore!
- But I'm almost finished.

412
00:59:57,743 --> 01:00:02,154
Xiao Hong, look what I bought you.
I know you'll like it, look!

413
01:00:03,283 --> 01:00:06,033
Give it to me! Don't curl my hair!

414
01:00:11,919 --> 01:00:15,427
- When did you get this? Why didn't you tell me?
- I've been carrying it for the last few days.

415
01:00:17,801 --> 01:00:21,200
Wang, how come you're always
pasting newspaper on the wall?

416
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:24,422
This broken down old wall,
I can't stand looking at it.

417
01:00:25,183 --> 01:00:27,908
What do you think we
should give to Xiao Hong?

418
01:00:28,933 --> 01:00:31,060
I think, I think I'll give her a comb.

419
01:00:31,073 --> 01:00:33,876
- What about us?
- I hadn't thought of that.

420
01:00:34,615 --> 01:00:36,847
Xiao Hong, here's a comb for you.

421
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,714
- I don't want this broken old comb.
- Hey, why don't you give her your earring instead.

422
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:41,582
- OK
- I don't want this earring.

423
01:00:41,582 --> 01:00:43,723
But it's not intended for your ears.
Put out your hand.

424
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,615
This is our engagement ring!

425
01:00:47,824 --> 01:00:49,389
Congratulations!

426
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:51,558
Quick, let's have a wedding celebration!

427
01:00:57,793 --> 01:01:01,354
Hey, it's not done yet. Why don't you drink it all.

428
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,000
You...come on, drink up!

429
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:13,442
- Xiao Hong, you drink more too!
- Oh. But I'm dizzy...

430
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:17,656
No matter. Who'll drink for Xiao Hong? Who?

431
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:19,656
Old Wang, why don't you have a drink for her?

432
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:23,312
Well, why do you sit there
and not say anything?

433
01:01:23,411 --> 01:01:27,169
- I've already drank a lot.
- That's right. Old Wang is so happy tonight.

434
01:01:27,169 --> 01:01:30,435
I've never seen him drink
as much wine as he has tonight.

435
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:33,700
- Let's all be happy!
- I...

436
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:38,382
- OK, enough already.
- Don't stop him. Everyone's so happy tonight...

437
01:01:38,382 --> 01:01:40,382
Let him finish his sentence.

438
01:01:44,112 --> 01:01:46,564
I...uh...want Xiao Hong to...

439
01:01:46,564 --> 01:01:48,598
...sing a song.

440
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,715
That's the best thing you've said in your life!

441
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:54,290
Xiao Hong, go on, sing.

442
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,003
No, I'm dizzy. I don't want to sing.

443
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:59,749
- You must sing. I'll go get my instrument.
- Slow down. Do a magic trick for me then I'll sing.

444
01:02:00,144 --> 01:02:02,423
Good idea, bravo!

445
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:32,332
<i>Make way! Make way! Let me sit here.</i>

446
01:02:07,118 --> 01:02:08,708
<i>Good.</i>

447
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:24,591
This is the real stuff, no fooling around.

448
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:26,131
Here's another one.

449
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,148
It goes in this eye, it comes out from here.
Now, go in!

450
01:02:32,527 --> 01:02:34,720
Is that the real stuff or fooling around?

451
01:02:36,815 --> 01:02:39,291
That one was called 'Silver Flying Away'

452
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:41,291
Do another one! Do another one!

453
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,456
OK, I'll do another one.

454
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,110
What's that one called?

455
01:02:50,776 --> 01:02:54,645
- That was called 'Silver...'
- I know, I know, I saw this in the paper.

456
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,845
<i>Massive exports of silver last month</i>

457
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:04,749
It's called 'silver coming out of the mouth'

458
01:03:05,636 --> 01:03:06,795
Correct.

459
01:03:07,399 --> 01:03:12,722
"Massive export of silver!" Hey, get your <i>Daily News</i>,
hey, get your <i>Shanghai News</i>...

460
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:37,342
There's no business.
What am I supposed to do?

461
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:41,383
We don't care if you don't have any business

462
01:03:41,383 --> 01:03:43,383
You still ought to give us what you owe.

463
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,004
If you don't pay, how will my children eat?

464
01:03:46,867 --> 01:03:48,604
Look, I even pawned my earring.

465
01:04:08,209 --> 01:04:10,772
We could certainly feed another mouth.

466
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,333
Xiao Hong misses you a lot.

467
01:04:15,627 --> 01:04:17,340
Why don't you run away too?

468
01:04:19,718 --> 01:04:21,788
I think you should run away too.

469
01:04:24,499 --> 01:04:26,631
I don't understand you.

470
01:05:42,794 --> 01:05:46,750
And when night came and it was
so quiet you couldn't hear a sound...

471
01:05:47,034 --> 01:05:49,769
except the wind outside the windows sighing.

472
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:57,471
The room candle light flickered.

473
01:05:57,471 --> 01:05:59,344
It was just then that...

474
01:05:59,344 --> 01:06:01,344
the ghost came downstairs...

475
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,211
All you could hear from the stairwell
was a series of thumps.

476
01:06:16,065 --> 01:06:17,716
Sister!

477
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:27,734
Did they send you here?

478
01:06:35,744 --> 01:06:37,715
Sister, here's some cool water.

479
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:52,637
- Chen, how could you...
- Shut up!

480
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:54,313
- She wasn't...
- Shut up!

481
01:06:54,313 --> 01:06:58,515
I don't care why she's here, but she shouldn't
come sneaking over here in the middle of the night.

482
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,515
She shouldn't be sneaking
over here where we live.

483
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:03,235
How did she know we live here anyway.
Who told her?

484
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,118
You must have told her.

485
01:07:11,626 --> 01:07:13,955
Does this woman live here?

486
01:07:16,506 --> 01:07:18,625
<i>Does this woman live here?</i>

487
01:07:20,572 --> 01:07:22,162
Yes.

488
01:07:22,162 --> 01:07:24,162
I wasn't asking you!

489
01:07:26,228 --> 01:07:27,682
<i>What do you say?</i>

490
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:37,121
Yes.

491
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:56,048
Sister, I'm going to go cook some rice.
They should be coming home soon.

492
01:08:14,396 --> 01:08:19,509
Oh? You're home already?
Look, my new dress is finished.

493
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:21,509
Oh. It's pretty. Very nice.

494
01:08:21,509 --> 01:08:23,509
What? You're going upstairs?

495
01:08:25,111 --> 01:08:28,559
Oh, well, the wall up there is broken,
so I wanted to cover it up with newspapers.

496
01:08:28,559 --> 01:08:30,559
- Do we have any paste?
- Yes.

497
01:08:47,558 --> 01:08:49,549
I bought you some medicine.

498
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:53,713
From now on, you don't have to live
the kind of life you've been living.

499
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,788
Xiao Hong!

500
01:09:27,781 --> 01:09:29,616
I can do that trick too.

501
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:42,070
I made up a new trick.
Do you want me to show it to you?

502
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:53,118
This cup if full of red wine...

503
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:56,904
...and that one is full of green wine.

504
01:09:56,904 --> 01:09:59,429
How about your rent?

505
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:03,554
Oh, right. I still have a dollar on me,
why don't you take that?

506
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:07,952
- One dollar isn't enough.
- Well, then, I'll give you more tomorrow.

507
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,022
OK.

508
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:36,321
Did you get their rent?

509
01:10:36,321 --> 01:10:38,897
Yeah, he gave me one foreign dollar.

510
01:10:38,897 --> 01:10:41,305
Foreign dollar? Idiot! 

511
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:43,231
What were you thinking, taking a foreign dollar?

512
01:10:43,894 --> 01:10:47,239
- Foreign dollars aren't any good anymore.
- Foreign dollars aren't any good?

513
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,219
Your crazy. Foreign dollars aren't any good?
You must be joking.

514
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:53,706
You don't get it. From today forward, anyone
who uses foreign dollars could be prosecuted.

515
01:10:53,706 --> 01:10:56,257
- Prosecuted?
- Give it to me. I'll give it back to him.

516
01:11:10,688 --> 01:11:13,759
Mr. Chen, can you exchange
this for a paper bill?

517
01:11:13,759 --> 01:11:16,518
What for? It's not as if
foreign dollars are made of bronze.

518
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:20,643
No, foreign dollars aren't any good anymore.
Didn't you hear about it?

519
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:23,805
No good anymore? You're joking.
Then give it back to me.

520
01:11:23,805 --> 01:11:26,044
- Do you have paper money?
- No.

521
01:11:28,191 --> 01:11:29,414
OK.

522
01:11:45,537 --> 01:11:47,879
My hands are killing me, I can't move.

523
01:11:47,879 --> 01:11:49,879
I need to cook the rice.

524
01:11:49,879 --> 01:11:54,412
Don't worry. I'll make the rice appear in the glass.

525
01:11:54,412 --> 01:11:57,912
- I don't believe it.
- You don't believe it? Then close your eyes.

526
01:12:22,611 --> 01:12:24,615
What was that noise?

527
01:12:28,805 --> 01:12:30,588
It was the landlord.

528
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:34,635
He says, he says foreign dollars
aren't any good anymore.

529
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:37,485
Foreign money no good?

530
01:12:38,448 --> 01:12:39,749
Foreign money...

531
01:12:42,417 --> 01:12:44,759
How did you get upstairs?

532
01:12:44,759 --> 01:12:46,347
Why are you home so early?

533
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,347
I...

534
01:12:57,135 --> 01:12:59,464
Damn! Does That must mean
rents are going up again?

535
01:12:59,464 --> 01:13:02,405
- Who was that talking?
- That was the boss of the barber shop next door.

536
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,604
I was just looking for you.

537
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,870
What about your rent?
Are you planning to pay or not?

538
01:13:09,276 --> 01:13:11,228
- Who are you?
- I am the rent collection agent.

539
01:13:11,228 --> 01:13:14,052
- It used to be someone else.
- There's been a change in management.

540
01:13:14,052 --> 01:13:16,862
I'll be the collector from now on.

541
01:13:16,862 --> 01:13:20,467
You must pay the three months of rent
that you owe within three days.

542
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:22,601
If not, we'll request that you vacate.

543
01:13:23,304 --> 01:13:24,917
Within three days?

544
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:36,720
- Damn
- Boss, what's the problem?

545
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,737
Why such a temper this time?

546
01:13:38,893 --> 01:13:42,576
OK, OK. You'll have to hurry up and find
jobs elsewhere. We're closing up shop here!

547
01:13:42,576 --> 01:13:44,576
Closing? Closing?

548
01:13:46,532 --> 01:13:48,315
- Closing?
- Closing?

549
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:51,945
Closing.

550
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:55,290
Don't. Don't cry.

551
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:14,783
Take this.

552
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,997
I have a way to prevent your
boss from having to close.

553
01:14:17,997 --> 01:14:19,715
You two come with me!

554
01:14:50,959 --> 01:14:53,523
Hey! Quick, come on in!
Big sale going on here!

555
01:14:54,226 --> 01:14:57,180
Quick, come on in!
Big sale going on here!

556
01:15:07,902 --> 01:15:10,245
Hey! Two heads shaved for the price of one!

557
01:15:10,245 --> 01:15:12,860
Hey! Shave a big head
and get a small one free!

558
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,380
Let me through. let me through.

559
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,258
Here's one with hair!

560
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:53,305
<i>Let me through.</i>

561
01:15:58,718 --> 01:16:02,310
Come on inside! Sit down!

562
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,423
<i>It's very inexpensive.</i>

563
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,624
<i>I didn't come by to have my head shaved!</i>

564
01:16:16,663 --> 01:16:18,797
I came to see the boss,
not get my head shaved!

565
01:16:18,797 --> 01:16:21,387
Big sale, very inexpensive!

566
01:16:23,586 --> 01:16:25,525
Bastards! Let me go!

567
01:16:26,085 --> 01:16:29,572
Don't talk. Don't talk. Big sale today.

568
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,914
It's very cheap.

569
01:16:32,175 --> 01:16:33,775
Bastards!

570
01:16:35,051 --> 01:16:36,625
<i>You'll be done soon.</i>

571
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,850
The way they shave people
is just like catching a pig.

572
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:40,425
<i>We'll be done in a moment.</i>

573
01:16:41,661 --> 01:16:45,279
Don't worry. With us three
shaving, you'll be done in a flash.

574
01:16:46,073 --> 01:16:51,733
<i>Help! Help...</i>

575
01:16:56,184 --> 01:16:58,006
Bastards!

576
01:16:58,006 --> 01:17:00,283
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

577
01:17:04,889 --> 01:17:08,013
Damn...Damn.

578
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,537
I'm sorry!

579
01:17:25,827 --> 01:17:26,894
<i>Damn</i>

580
01:17:41,898 --> 01:17:44,653
Damn...Damn.

581
01:17:44,872 --> 01:17:46,603
<i>For Rent</i>

582
01:18:15,381 --> 01:18:17,970
I've already found out where they live!

583
01:18:19,688 --> 01:18:23,384
So have you seen that girl inside?

584
01:18:24,334 --> 01:18:28,641
I haven't seen her exactly, but she has to be there. 

585
01:18:29,123 --> 01:18:34,497
It couldn't have been a coincidence
that the day she disappeared

586
01:18:34,497 --> 01:18:37,698
that little devil moved out too.

587
01:18:38,596 --> 01:18:43,112
Moreover, I noticed a long time
how that devil and Xiao Hong

588
01:18:43,112 --> 01:18:45,480
sometimes carried on...

589
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,486
Mr Gu, what do you think we should do?

590
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:52,793
Just say the word and we'll take care of it.

591
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:58,740
OK, let's go have a look tomorrow.

592
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,887
Damn.

593
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:31,312
What should we do? Those two
haven't come back yet either.

594
01:19:55,997 --> 01:19:58,067
I've finally found you out! 

595
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:06,655
I'm asking you, where is Xiao Hong.
Tell me!

596
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,609
Tell me!

597
01:20:10,884 --> 01:20:13,214
Quick. Tell me!

598
01:20:15,881 --> 01:20:17,703
Cheap slut!

599
01:20:20,436 --> 01:20:22,193
Hold on a second. Put that down.

600
01:20:26,617 --> 01:20:30,118
You want to kill me huh?

601
01:20:32,044 --> 01:20:34,750
Well, I'll kill you first!

602
01:20:43,248 --> 01:20:45,525
Tell me, where is she?

603
01:20:47,568 --> 01:20:49,676
Right. We should go up and have a look.

604
01:20:50,769 --> 01:20:52,578
Keep an eye on her, Old Gu.

605
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:24,564
Old Gu!

606
01:21:25,371 --> 01:21:27,349
She must have escaped that way.

607
01:21:27,817 --> 01:21:29,349
Cheap slut!

608
01:21:34,233 --> 01:21:37,018
Old Gu...Old Gu!

609
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:42,743
Old Gu?

610
01:21:51,371 --> 01:21:53,973
Old Gu! Could it be that he's
setting us up to take the fall?

611
01:22:04,657 --> 01:22:07,052
Think about it. Am I right or am I wrong?

612
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,088
- Don't try to stop me!
- Don't do it!

613
01:22:14,088 --> 01:22:15,601
- Why not?
- What are you going for?

614
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:17,861
- I'm going to fight.
- Is it worth it?

615
01:22:17,861 --> 01:22:21,269
- What do you mean by that?
- Is it worth fighting for that kind of woman?

616
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:24,641
- What are you saying?
- Is it worth fighting for that kind of woman?

617
01:22:36,889 --> 01:22:38,547
Old Wang

618
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:42,393
I'm sorry.

619
01:22:48,007 --> 01:22:49,246
Chen!

620
01:22:52,144 --> 01:22:54,240
Chen, where do you think you're going?

621
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:57,503
I'll...I'll go find her for you.

622
01:22:59,398 --> 01:23:01,585
Calm down!

623
01:23:01,585 --> 01:23:03,608
This isn't some kind of game.

624
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:16,877
Xiao Yun! Xiao Yun!

625
01:23:27,612 --> 01:23:30,346
Are you injured? Xiao Yun!

626
01:23:35,285 --> 01:23:37,144
Quickly!

627
01:23:42,102 --> 01:23:43,687
Old Wang is back!

628
01:23:51,032 --> 01:23:54,495
Quick! You all look after her
and I'll go find a doctor.

629
01:23:54,495 --> 01:23:56,495
Ah! Sister!

630
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:16,877
Xiao Yun.

631
01:25:42,393 --> 01:25:44,252
I'm sorry.

632
01:25:48,736 --> 01:25:52,946
We all share the same miserable fate.

633
01:25:52,946 --> 01:25:57,029
What does forgiveness mean anyway?

634
01:25:57,029 --> 01:25:58,669
Sister!

635
01:26:02,351 --> 01:26:04,866
Don't be sad, Xiao Yun.

636
01:26:04,866 --> 01:26:06,866
Rest easy.

637
01:26:07,272 --> 01:26:09,714
Wang has already gone
to get you a doctor.

638
01:26:10,188 --> 01:26:12,339
A doctor?

639
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:15,783
Old Wang?

640
01:26:17,059 --> 01:26:20,540
Old Wang is a real friend...

641
01:26:22,837 --> 01:26:25,042
Old Wang... 

642
01:26:26,318 --> 01:26:29,034
Is that him coming back?

643
01:26:35,577 --> 01:26:40,170
No, that's not him. That's just
the policeman on the night beat.

644
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:44,234
- Old Wang will be back any moment now.
- Police?

645
01:26:45,437 --> 01:26:48,298
Police? What's he coming here for?

646
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:52,837
To arrest people?

647
01:26:52,837 --> 01:26:55,425
To arrest me?

648
01:26:55,425 --> 01:26:57,557
To arrest him?

649
01:26:58,851 --> 01:27:00,601
- Arrest him! ... Arrest him!
- Xiao Yun

650
01:27:04,939 --> 01:27:07,399
- Xiao Yun.
- Let him go.

651
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:09,399
- Xiao Yun
- Let him go.

652
01:27:11,701 --> 01:27:14,380
It's OK, nothing is happening, Xiao Yun.

653
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,380
Your eyes are playing
tricks on you, Xiao Yun.

654
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:23,985
Release him.

655
01:27:24,969 --> 01:27:26,865
Release him.

656
01:27:28,013 --> 01:27:30,054
He's a good man.

657
01:27:32,132 --> 01:27:34,811
He helps poor people.

658
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:49,520
Ants.

659
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:53,055
Ants.

660
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:11,810
Sister!

661
01:28:41,391 --> 01:28:43,104
She's gone to sleep.

662
01:29:03,116 --> 01:29:05,212
Are you tired?

663
01:29:08,566 --> 01:29:12,831
Not enough money. The doctor won't come.
