1
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,074
(Singing) My Royal day
can be a Royal bore.

2
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,353
It leaves me colder
than a basement floor.

3
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,238
The only moment I keep waiting for,
is when the day will be through.

4
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,869
I never notice if it's dark or clear.
What people say to me I hardly hear.

5
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,432
The passing hours are an endless year
until at last I'm alone with you.

6
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,795
Every night at seven you walk in
as fresh as clover

7
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,953
and I begin to sigh all over again.

8
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,150
Every night at seven
you come by like May returning

9
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,998
and me, o my
I start in yearning again.

10
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,589
You seem to bring
far away spring near me.

11
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,594
I'm always in full bloom
when you're in the room.

12
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,594
For every night at seven,
every time the same thing happens.

13
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,510
I fall once again in love
but only with you.

14
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,110
(Chorus) Every night at seven,
every time the same thing happens.

15
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,675
I fall once again in love,
but only with you.

16
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,791
May I say your performance
was a bit ragged.

17
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,190
You were so slow going around
the throne I almost caught you.

18
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,548
Well the audience
seemed to like it.

19
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,678
It's so hot in New York in the summer.
I'm glad we're closing tomorrow night.

20
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,639
I wonder what happened
to the air conditioning.

21
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,836
Mr. Hiller probably turned it off
to save money.

22
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,672
Oh, would you blot my face too.

23
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,639
Up here it's dripping.
Who's Mr. Hiller?

24
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,638
The house manager.
You ought to know that.

25
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,557
You've been playing his theatre
for the past year and a half.

26
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,995
Is that that evil little man
who comes around and pinches?

27
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,394
That's your department
sister dear.

28
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,790
All I can say is let Mr. Hiller
keep his air conditioning.

29
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,349
He can't take it with him,
and where's he's going, he'll need it.

30
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,830
Boy, it's hot!

31
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,152
If I ever play a king again,
I'll be one of those Asiatic boys

32
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,759
who just wears
earrings and a sheet.

33
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,075
Hey! What's your hurry?

34
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,510
Pete.

35
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,709
Hi Ellen honey.

36
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,875
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

37
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,393
You know my brother Tom,
don't you?

38
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,158
No I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

39
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,837
How are you?

40
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,752
I'm fine Sir,
and thank you for asking.

41
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,235
I'll be out in five. Oh, my peach
you look so nice and cool.

42
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,716
Make yourself at home.
Sit down, anywhere.

43
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,118
- Oh, how was it sir?
- Hot.

44
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,910
Oh, Um your agent stopped
by to see you sir.

45
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,714
Irving. What brought him out
this clammy night?

46
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,956
(Chesley) He didn't say.

47
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,509
He just told me to tell you
it was imperative that you and

48
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,234
Miss Ellen meet him at McGuffie's bar,
next door, right after the performance.

49
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,235
Oh Ellen.

50
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,396
(Ellen) Yeah.

51
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,039
Irving wants us to meet him
at Mcguffies.

52
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,397
Okay. How do you like Pete?
Isn't he cute. He's from the south.

53
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,556
Why Ellen honey,
I never would have guessed it.

54
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,597
He owns miles and miles
of tobacco land in Virginia.

55
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,718
And you ought to hear him chant. I met
him two days ago at Hilda's Barn sales.

56
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,432
And I'm simply mad about him.
Is that all.

57
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,351
That's all.

58
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,077
Roger.

59
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,911
Miss Ellen seems quite taken.
Doesn't she?

60
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,238
This will probably be one of those long
affairs that drags on a whole evening.

61
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,914
(Radio) News overseas concerns the
Royal Wedding in London.

62
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,991
The British capital is already
festive and happy

63
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,469
in anticipation of the wedding,
which is still several weeks off.

64
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,510
- Towel.
- Ssh. Please Sir.

65
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,392
(Radio Broadcast contd.)
As for the Princess,

66
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,954
the most guarded secret in England
since radar is her wedding gown.

67
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,310
The Princess herself will see it
for the first time this weekend.

68
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,676
- Just give me...
- Please Sir.

69
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,597
(Radio Broadcast cont.)
Other news. In Miami Florida,

70
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,273
a new tropical hurricane
seems to be approaching.

71
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,310
Can I talk now?

72
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,677
Yes Sir, You know Mr Bowen
I danced in Trafalgar Square

73
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,279
the day her grandfather
was married.

74
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,758
Oh.

75
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,314
I'd give anything to be there again
this fall, wouldn't you?

76
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,635
Yes. I like weddings provided,
of course, they're not mine.

77
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,478
Oh, marriages
are very healthy sir.

78
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,835
They say married men live
much longer that bachelors.

79
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,157
If that's true, they're only trying
to outlive their wives

80
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,599
so they can be bachelors again.

81
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,393
Haven't you ever thought
of getting married Sir?

82
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,919
Once,
as a matter of fact I did.

83
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,396
The young lady changed
her mind at the last moment.

84
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,671
I've been indebted to her
ever since.

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,910
Goodnight Chesley.

86
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,873
Gee, I wonder what Irving wants?
I hope it' s something that...

87
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,156
My gosh what a muscle,
It's like cement.

88
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,238
Oh, it's nothing.
All us tobacco men get kinda strong.

89
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,635
- What from?
- Lifting money.

90
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,988
(Loud laughter)

91
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,591
Come now
it wasn't that good.

92
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,751
Good night Eddie.

93
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,478
Goodnight.

94
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,157
Goodnight Eddie.

95
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,678
Goodnight.

96
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,439
He's the only stage door man
I know that isn't called pop.

97
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,590
Hello Bill.

98
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,676
Hi Irv.

99
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,399
I couldn't wait for you
backstage tonight.

100
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,353
What's it with that heat? Who needs it?
So how was the show?

101
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,068
- The first act was a little...
- Dollboat, how are you baby?

102
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,950
Fine. How are you?

103
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,554
- Oh, you look so sweet tonight.
- I do, don't I?

104
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,033
Okay. Come on, order.
I got new, big news.

105
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,071
Can I present
Pete Cumberley?

106
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,236
How do you do, Mr. Cumberley.
It's a great pleasure.

107
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,708
Thank you Sir.
That's very nice.

108
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,194
- Who's this square?
- A friend.

109
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,390
- A Tom Collins please.
- Nothing for me, thanks.

110
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,431
Hit me with a rye.
Shall I give it to you?

111
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,032
What is it?

112
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,594
This'll kill you. My brother Edgar
called tonight from England.

113
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,358
He's the boss of our London
Office, been there for years.

114
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,914
The Mayfair Theatre people
want your whole show for London.

115
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,438
No!

116
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,551
But quick they want you there
during the wedding season.

117
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,591
- England during the wedding.
- I like that.

118
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,789
Oh, Tommy.

119
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,876
Ellen honey, does this mean
you'll be leaving me?

120
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,036
Yes Pete. Isn't it wonderful?
When do we open?

121
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,435
As soon as possible. Of course you
gotta rehearse the English cast first.

122
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,310
Hit me son.

123
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,190
What about transportation?

124
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,356
There's some French boat
leaving a week from next Monday.

125
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,196
Which one?

126
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,311
Who knows what's the name,
it's in French.

127
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,589
Don't worry I'll get you on it.

128
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,876
Ellen, this means we'll be
saying good-bye in ten days.

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,797
Oh yes Pete I'm so happy.

130
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,151
- Ellen.
- Oh, hello Dick.

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,231
I was waiting for you backstage.
That's why I'm late. I'm sorry.

132
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,755
- Ellen, who is this fella?
- Finish your drink Pete.

133
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,790
Did you hear the good news?

134
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,229
We're going to England
and we'll be there during the wedding!

135
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,549
What are you doing here, Sir?

136
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,274
- What do you mean? Who's he?
- A friend.

137
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,032
What are you doing here Sir?
I demand an answer.

138
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,912
Go peddle your papers!
When do you leave?

139
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,996
- That's an insult.
- What's an insult?

140
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,116
(Argument in background)
This is terribly embarrassing.

141
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,913
I forgot all about Dick.
I hope they don't hit each other.

142
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,115
We ought to start packing.

143
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,157
I have to buy all my new clothes
before I go.

144
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,110
You'll have time.

145
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,992
I'll send the rest of the Company
the week after you leave.

146
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,553
- I wonder what they'll be wearing?
- I don't know.

147
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,910
- Pay the man, will you?
- Sure. How much do we owe you?

148
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,235
- May I?
- Yes you may.

149
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,190
And keep the change.

150
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,990
I have a little business to take care of,
I'll meet you on deck.

151
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,434
Okay sister dear.

152
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,077
Hello Billy.
This is good-bye.

153
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,833
Thanks for coming down
to see me off.

154
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,197
It's hard saying good-bye
after all we've been to each other.

155
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,590
I know,
it's been a lovely three days.

156
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,079
But I'll be back soon.

157
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,749
Oh, dear.
I must go now.

158
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,393
May I walk you
up the gangplank?

159
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,437
Well, I'd rather you wouldn't,
you understand.

160
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,196
No.

161
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,598
Well, it's just better that way
Write to me Billy.

162
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,233
I will. Goodbye Ellen.

163
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,637
(English male voice)
I'll miss you very much Linda.

164
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,113
Knowing you
these past few weeks

165
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,993
has been one of the most exciting
things that's ever happened to me.

166
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,832
To me too, John.

167
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,755
Pete!

168
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,798
Ellen honey.
I thought I went to the wrong gate.

169
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,308
We haven't much time.

170
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,635
Really?
And I have so much to say.

171
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,190
- What?
- Well, you gonna be away.

172
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,554
Yes I know Pete, but what?

173
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,671
Suddenly knowing
you're gonna be away

174
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,677
makes me realise
my feelings for you.

175
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,837
So I thought I'd.
I mean, Ellen honey.

176
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,870
Visitors ashore please!

177
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,832
Oh dear Pete,
you'll have to go now.

178
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,790
But Ellen honey.

179
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,878
Better hurry. Write me
what you had to say, huh? Bye.

180
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,549
(English male voice) Barbara,
knowing you these past few weeks

181
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,955
has been one of the most exciting
things that's ever happened to me.

182
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,956
I'll miss you John.

183
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,918
- Good-bye baby.
- Goodbye Irv.

184
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,589
I know you'll be a smash. Now if you
want anything you ask my brother Edgar.

185
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,835
He's gonna meet you
at the hotel.

186
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,393
- So long Irv.
- Bye.

187
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,355
So long Ellen. So long.

188
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,789
Bye honey!
See you soon.

189
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,638
So long, see ya!

190
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,637
Hey. Who are you
waiving up there?

191
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,829
My girl, right there, see.

192
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,995
That's my girl.

193
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,156
Oh, don't give me that.
That's my girl.

194
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,916
I bet against five
on Dixie boy.

195
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,959
What a beautiful,
beautiful day.

196
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,595
Isn't it wonderful.
We don't know a soul on the boat,

197
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,312
and we can have fun
together for a change.

198
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,838
Yeah.

199
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,679
- Good day.
- Good day.

200
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,996
I don't know him, Tom.
Honest I don't. I want to write a letter.

201
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,991
Okay baby.

202
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,235
Don't forget
we've got to rehearse.

203
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,196
What time should
I meet you?

204
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,389
Two o'clock sharp,
in the gym.

205
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,953
- I won't keep you long.
- I'll be there don't worry.

206
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,235
- Now don't be late.
- Okay.

207
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,038
- Good day.
- Good day.

208
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,319
There's carbon paper in the middle
drawer, if you want to make duplicates.

209
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,791
I'm not writing a letter,
I was just doodling,

210
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,712
waiting for an opportunity
to introduce myself.

211
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,629
My name is Brindale. Lord
John Brindale, and what's yours?

212
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,711
Bowen.
Duchess Agatha Bowen.

213
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,476
Oh, no really. What is it?
Oh, let's see now.

214
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,111
E. B. E, is that Ethel?
Wait a minute.

215
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,510
Bowen, why of course -
you're Ellen Bowen aren't you?

216
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,915
You're doing fine.

217
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,593
It's very stupid of me,
I should have known.

218
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,157
I only saw your show a few
weeks ago. Please forgive me.

219
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,272
Oh, that's alright,
I know you have a lot on your mind.

220
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,148
Oh, I can explain those two little
episodes that you witnessed yesterday.

221
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,588
- Oh, you can?
- Yes.

222
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,710
Then go ahead.

223
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,759
Well, you see,
they're both terribly nice girls,

224
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,112
and they're so fond of me, that I couldn't
bear depriving either one of them.

225
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,559
You know how it is.

226
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,069
To be kind to people,
one has to be a very good liar.

227
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,598
Tell me,
why were you following me?

228
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,838
Following you?
I was doing no such thing.

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,275
I was only saying goodbye
to a couple of...

230
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,717
- The same?
- Yeah.

231
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,595
Does this sort of thing
happen to you very often?

232
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,153
Oh, all the time.
And you?

233
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,316
Constantly.

234
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,272
I guess we're both
two kind people.

235
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,274
I have to get a stamp.
Do you live in New York?

236
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,197
No,
I've been there on business,

237
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,793
but I'm just going home
for the wedding.

238
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,194
- The Royal Wedding?
- Yeah.

239
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,674
You're going to the wedding?

240
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,553
Well
I'm escorting someone, yes.

241
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,912
You really are
a Lord aren't you?

242
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,950
I'm afraid so.

243
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,515
My, my!

244
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,995
Haven't you met anyone
who held a title before?

245
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,269
Only Joe Louis.

246
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,713
- I'm very glad you're Ellen Bowen.
- Why?

247
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,559
It means that the chap you're with
is your brother, not your husband.

248
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,275
Do you know
what I did last night?

249
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,116
No, what?

250
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,316
I surveyed this whole boat,
and I discovered

251
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,873
that you were the most
attractive girl on board.

252
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,997
Well, thank you.

253
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,475
And I kept thinking that,
what a pity she's married,

254
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,989
because that's going
to make things terribly awkward.

255
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,996
But it isn't going to be
awkward at all now.

256
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,875
- Thanks for the use of the hall, purser.
- Not at all.

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,956
If you see my sister on deck,
tell her I'm waiting for her please.

258
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,871
I will.

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,672
- I like your boat.
- Thank you Monsieur.

260
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,678
Monsieur Bowen.
I have a favour to ask.

261
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,998
On every crossing, we have a gala
benefit for the disabled seamen.

262
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,597
I was wondering if you and your sister
would dance for us on that night.

263
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,592
Oh, we'd love to. Just tell us when.

264
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,676
One number
would be sufficient.

265
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,438
No trouble at all.

266
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,353
I know it's an imposition to ask
you two. But I would feel so...

267
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,476
We'd love to.
Don't worry we'll do it.

268
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,117
There's a fella that won't take yes
for an answer.

269
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,309
Oh, fine. Thanks for showing up
for rehearsals.

270
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,155
Oh... Er John, this is my brother Tom.
Tom this is John.

271
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,474
- How do you do?
- Glad to know you.

272
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,158
I just picked up John
in the writing room.

273
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,992
- So I gather.
- He's a real Lord.

274
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,633
Oh, it's nothing at all.

275
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,755
- Miss Bowen.
- Yes.

276
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,916
- A cable.
- Oh, thank you. Excuse me please.

277
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,070
Oh, Tom. That was from Pete.

278
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,835
He says he's very blue
except for his eye which is black.

279
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,512
Let's forget Pete for this trip, shall we?
Excuse us.

280
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,596
Oh dear. It looks a little dim
out there, doesn't it?

281
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,118
Yeah.

282
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,715
Monsieur Bowen,
I'm wondering if you and your sister

283
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,274
would dance right away
instead of waiting until 10:30.

284
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,793
We're a little afraid
of the weather.

285
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,389
- You mean it might be a little rocky?
- Yes.

286
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,555
That won't bother us,
we can handle it.

287
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,636
- Thank you, Monsieur.
- Any time you say.

288
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,113
I'd better change my dress.

289
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,396
Open your eyes,
there's a sapphire sky above us.

290
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,835
High above us.

291
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,355
Made for you.

292
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,874
When you open your eyes.

293
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,634
Open your eyes,
there's a carpet of jade around us.

294
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,353
Laid around us.
All for you.

295
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,878
When you open your eyes.

296
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,549
Let me show you the sight.

297
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:39,877
Take you on a tour of this great,
new fabulous world.

298
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,431
We own. We alone.

299
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:56,910
So open you eyes
and you'll see how this momentary,

300
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:07,158
ordinary night can seem.
More unreal than a dream.

301
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,439
We can handle it alright.
What do we do now?

302
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,313
- Keep your balance.
- Oh, sure.

303
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,835
So sorry.

304
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,355
- Oh, it's nothing.
- Pardon us.

305
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,553
(Applause)

306
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,957
What?

307
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,150
- Isn't it wonderful Tommy?
- It sure is.

308
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,515
(Phone rings)

309
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,550
Hello. Yes. Oh, sure. Yes, yes.
Do come on up.

310
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,713
Room two hundred & eleven,
twelve and fourteen. OK.

311
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,916
Who was that?

312
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,996
Edgar Klinger, Irving's brother,
he's coming up.

313
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,713
I'm so happy Tommy.

314
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,477
I wonder what the Princess
is doing this morning?

315
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,639
Why don't you call her
and ask her?

316
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,796
I know what I'd be doing
a month before my wedding.

317
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,479
Probably trying to figure
a way to get out of it.

318
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,189
Do you really think so?

319
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,912
You know you would,
and so would I.

320
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,990
(Door bell)

321
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,791
How do you do?
I'm Edgar Klinger.

322
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,629
Oh, we didn't know...

323
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,513
- That Irving and I were twins.
- No, we didn't.

324
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,597
I must say.
He should have told you, you know.

325
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,679
After all this is a pretty box of pickles.
May I come in?

326
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,195
Of course, I'm sorry.

327
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,630
How do you do?

328
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,796
So happy to meet you
at long last.

329
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,275
- My, it's amazing.
- It is rather, isn't it?

330
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,152
I do hope the rooms
are satisfactory.

331
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,475
Oh, they're fine.
It's a miracle you could get them.

332
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,074
Yes quite. The wedding
has backed things up a bit.

333
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,077
But, er, then there are ways.

334
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,709
How's everything
in the theatre?

335
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,432
Oh, seems to be humming.

336
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,233
The dancers are coming to audition
this afternoon. The singers tomorrow.

337
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,870
(Phone rings)
Excuse me please.

338
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,398
Hello. Oh, hello Johnny,
how are you?

339
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,713
Ellen's boat romance. John Brindale.
You know him?

340
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,393
Know the family, very old.

341
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,558
They do say that young John's
a bit of a chaser.

342
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,911
Didn't have to chase very hard
after Ellen. She stood still and waited.

343
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,238
This afternoon, no they're
auditioning all day. Just a minute.

344
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,988
Tom you don't need me
this afternoon, do you?

345
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,435
John wants me to drive down
and see his old country house with him.

346
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,915
I suppose it's alright.

347
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,230
But I thought you'd want to come
and see who you're working with.

348
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,277
Oh, I never notice
anyone but you.

349
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,079
- John.
- I want you home for dinner.

350
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,872
And no dates at night
until after we open.

351
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,191
You come strolling in at four in the
morning, and be tired out next day.

352
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,875
Yes Poppa.

353
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,508
It's all set.
What time will you pick me up?

354
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,034
Ok. I'll be ready.
Bye Johnny.

355
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,396
Shall we?

356
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,476
Yeah. I'll see you at seven
and be back.

357
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,636
- Oh, I will. I will.
- Cheerio.

358
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,556
Goodbye Edgar.

359
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,676
Oh, and if there's anything
you need, do call.

360
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,232
Thank you.

361
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,476
After you...

362
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,157
Tell me old boy, how are things
in the Colonies, these day?

363
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,548
Oh, fine, fine.

364
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,319
These English clothes
are terrific.

365
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,119
Frankly amusing tie.

366
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,593
Yeah.

367
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,030
Got a match?

368
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,237
Thanks. I hear that shaving lotion's
great stuff, do you ever use it?

369
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,390
Oh, every day.

370
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,750
Sorry. I thought you were him.

371
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,039
How odd. Thank you.

372
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,354
I must get back to the office. You know
where the theatre is, don't you?

373
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:13,912
Sure.

374
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,274
Well I'll see you later.
Cheerio.

375
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,355
Okay.

376
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,189
Well hello again.

377
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,759
I wish
you'd stop following me.

378
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,830
Following you?

379
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,870
I'm not a bit flattered.

380
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,396
Mr. Bowen. I'm Charles Gordon
your stage manager.

381
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,316
Oh, it's nice to see you.

382
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,953
- Everything's ready Sir.
- Oh good.

383
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,516
See that girl in the green dress,
near the end changing her shoes.

384
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,995
Yes Sir.

385
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,429
Let's begin with her. They can each
show me a few steps.

386
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,470
Very good Sir.

387
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,356
- You name please?
- Anne Ashmond.

388
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,959
Thank you.
Will you begin please?

389
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,796
Why, yes.

390
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,915
Miss Anne Ashman.

391
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,793
Will you try a few steps
with me please?

392
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,670
Oh, dear.

393
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,555
Can't you dance
with a partner?

394
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,874
I could
until a moment ago.

395
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,077
Well try. We'll take
something easy to start.

396
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,753
May I have a pick-up please?

397
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,671
You should have seen the expression
on your face, when you saw me.

398
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,315
- How did I look?
- As if I were a dentist.

399
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,392
- You dance very well.
- Thank you.

400
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,078
- I think you'll do fine.
- Will I really?

401
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,275
Sure.

402
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,514
It's very nice of you not to hold
what happened against me.

403
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,789
I do a little bit.

404
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,790
Well, what can I do?

405
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,755
You can have dinner
with me some night.

406
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,075
- Well, I should love to.
- How about tonight?

407
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,668
Well, I don't really know.

408
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,310
She'll do fine. Pick you up at eight.
Thank you. Who's next?

409
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,314
Is it much further?

410
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,955
No, we're almost there
My, you look pretty.

411
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,231
I know. What do you have
to do at the house?

412
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,236
Get the wedding present.

413
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,030
We sold almost everything at auction,
except for one set of china plates.

414
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,796
I was supposed to get those
when I got married.

415
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,558
Since there's little chance of that,

416
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,432
we decided to hand them
to the Prince & Princess.

417
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,393
- Why is there precious little chance?
- Oh, I don't know.

418
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,673
You have
to enjoy living with yourself,

419
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,876
before you have the nerve
to ask anyone else to.

420
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,838
Besides, you know how I am.

421
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,355
Oh, here we are.

422
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,675
John, it's beautiful!

423
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,995
Yes it was.

424
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,639
I think they're in here.

425
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,914
What a wonderful floor
to dance on.

426
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,952
How long since
anyone's lived here, John?

427
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,311
About five years. No one
could afford places like this today.

428
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,555
- I imagine you miss it terribly.
- I don't think I do anymore.

429
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,918
I just don't have anything
to replace it with.

430
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,833
- What time do you have to be back?
- Seven sharp.

431
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,428
Oh, I wish you could have
dinner with me.

432
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,313
I don't know when
I'll get another free evening.

433
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,789
There's some sort of party
every night from now on.

434
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,550
Can't you?

435
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,469
I don't know.
You know how Tom is?

436
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,996
Will you try?

437
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,071
- Yes I'll try.
- Good.

438
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,477
Hello.

439
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,716
Hi. Back on time.

440
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,030
How was the afternoon?

441
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,111
It was wonderful.
How were your dancers?

442
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,110
Dancers.

443
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,073
What do you want
to do tonight?

444
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,919
I'm kinda tired Ellie.

445
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,470
I thought I'd just skip dinner and
go straight to bed. Would you mind?

446
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,156
Oh, no. It's a good idea.
That country air really knocks me out.

447
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,874
- Yeah. Sure you don't mind?
- Oh, gosh no.

448
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,353
Matter of fact, I think I'll turn in
right now if it's alright with you.

449
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,034
It's a good idea.
It's been a kind of a rough day.

450
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,877
Yeah.

451
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,799
- Goodnight honey.
- Goodnight Tommy. Sweet dreams.

452
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,435
Taxi, please.

453
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,429
Thank you!

454
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,113
Taxi!

455
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,113
Thank you.

456
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,956
- More coffee?
- Thank you.

457
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,510
Yes. Ellie and I have done
quite a few shows together.

458
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,829
Do you like to dance?

459
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,034
Yes, yes. It's hard work but it's fun.
What made you decide to dance?

460
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,992
Oh, a very silly reason.

461
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,076
How silly?

462
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,951
When I was eleven I fell in love
for the first time with a boy much older.

463
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,431
- Twelve?
- No thirteen.

464
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,789
His name was Alonzo,
and I was so happy

465
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,956
that suddenly
all I wanted to do was dance.

466
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,558
So I figured that if I danced
when I was happy,

467
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,999
I should be happy
if I dance.

468
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,435
Is that silly enough?

469
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,110
I think so.

470
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,793
I felt so good about Alonzo
I used to close my eyes

471
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,430
and pretend I could dance all over
the floor, walls, even the ceilings.

472
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,950
If you ever learn to do that,
I could get you a very good booking.

473
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,269
Want anything else?

474
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,912
No.

475
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,870
Let's go.

476
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,631
- You'd better not take me home.
- Why not?

477
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,711
Well it's a long way,
and besides this is Friday.

478
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,592
Friday I have to stop
and see my Father.

479
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,552
- Oh, I'd like to meet him. Cabby!
- Alright.

480
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,995
- What's the address?
- 150, Mitchell Street.

481
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,356
Cabby, could you take us to
150, Mitchell Street?

482
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,192
Love to Guvnor. Love to.

483
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,238
- Wait will you please, driver?
- Love to Guvnor, love to.

484
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,874
- That's my father he's the proprietor.
- Oh.

485
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,312
Oh dear. I hope he won't offend you.
He's quite impossible really.

486
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,675
He and my mother
have been separated for three years,

487
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,995
and I have to stop here every Friday
and get her money.

488
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,914
- Why doesn't your mother do it?
- They're not speaking to each other.

489
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,318
So I says to him. McBride,
every time you get four drinks

490
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,590
under that belt o' yours,
you become a bloomin' nuisance.

491
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,870
And what's more,
every time you fall down,

492
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,956
you chip a piece
out of the bar with your chin.

493
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,395
So I says from now on...
Annie!

494
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,392
Well my little girl,
how are you dear?

495
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,751
Hello Jamie. Tom, this is my father.
Father, this Tom Bowen.

496
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,677
Glad to know you, Mr. Ashmond
- Please to meet you Sir.

497
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,358
To the Royal couple.

498
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,110
Bowen eh? I used to know
a Willie Bowen. Good old Willie.

499
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,272
Married a girl we used to know
named Gladys Hawksley.

500
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,596
I don't think
you knew Gladys, Annie.

501
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,159
Very happy they were for years.

502
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,192
Then one night good old Willie
threw her out of the window.

503
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,389
Nobody knows why.

504
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,909
But I always figured
they must have had an argument.

505
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,989
- I don't suppose you'd be any relation?
- Why no.

506
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,678
I don't believe
I have any relations over here.

507
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,357
Over here?

508
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,350
You see I'm from America.

509
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,879
America! America!
Get out of my pub.

510
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,756
Leave the premises.

511
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,558
I'm not on speaking terms
with the United States.

512
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,158
Jamie!

513
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,396
How dare you bring
another yank to my tavern.

514
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,868
Out, do you hear? Out!

515
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,228
What's the matter
with the United States?

516
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,437
Matter! You owe me money, you do.
Where is it?

517
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,957
Look at this, two pounds, ten shillings,
run up by your bloomin' soldiers.

518
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,514
And what did they do? Hopped it.
Walked out without paying.

519
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,630
I'll not serve you a drink Sir.

520
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,636
Now stop it Jamie.

521
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,193
To the Royal Couple.

522
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,997
Well, I can't allow Anglo-American
relations to be threatened like this.

523
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,519
I'd like to square that bill.

524
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,119
- Tom you shouldn't.
- Oh, sure. How much is that?

525
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,835
Two pounds ten, let me see.
There you are Sir.

526
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,748
Now there's a gentleman for you. Not
like the other Yank you're so fond of.

527
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,077
Well, you can just add ten bob
and give it to me for mother.

528
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,077
Has she found out
when we go to the Palace yet?

529
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,514
Or is she keeping it from me?

530
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,039
Three pounds Jamie.

531
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,035
You see we sent a little token to the
Royal Highnesses for the wedding.

532
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,474
According to the papers,

533
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,795
anybody who did are allowed
to see the wedding presents.

534
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,394
It's a nice custom.

535
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,391
Three pounds Jamie.

536
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,278
Oh alright. Here.

537
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,838
What you counting for?
Don't you trust me?

538
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,798
Just like her mother, no faith.

539
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,075
You're five shillings short.

540
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,512
Oh, that's what you might
call a typographical error. Here.

541
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,439
Thank you. We'd better go.
Goodnight Jamie.

542
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,518
Goodnight dearie.
Goodnight pal.

543
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,396
Goodnight buddy.

544
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,874
To the Royal Couple.

545
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,517
Thanks.

546
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,354
Looks like Mother
is still up.

547
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,677
Since she and Jamie separated, she
can never get to sleep till I get home.

548
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,876
Let's walk a minute
and get some nice fresh fog...

549
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,519
Who, er, who's the yank
you're so fond of?

550
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,672
Hal Rayton.
He's my fiancé.

551
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,079
You don't sound
very happy about it.

552
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,155
Oh I am really.

553
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,430
Is it a secret?

554
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,632
No. Oh, this is ridiculous.
He's in Chicago.

555
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,997
Illinois?

556
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,791
He lives there.

557
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,792
- And you live here?
- Yes.

558
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,635
If you keep that arrangement after
you're married, you'll be very happy.

559
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,748
How long since
you've seen him?

560
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,995
About two years.

561
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,795
Two years!
And you're still in love with him.

562
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,518
I've never thought
of not being.

563
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,553
- Do you hear from him very often?
- Every few days as a rule.

564
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,717
Oh?

565
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,357
Actually, I haven't heard from him
for two months now.

566
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,152
But he's probably been busy.

567
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,916
I wrote to him tonight
and told him I was in your show,

568
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,871
and asked him
to call me opening night.

569
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,360
I assume you have some plans
about getting together in the future?

570
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,276
Oh yes.

571
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,551
Are you going over there?
Is he coming over here?

572
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,472
Or are you going to meet
in the middle?

573
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,318
He works in Ogilvies
department store in Chicago.

574
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,635
Oh, well?

575
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,832
Well, as soon as he makes
enough to send for me

576
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,030
or I make enough to go over there,
we're going to be married.

577
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,316
That's fine.

578
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,238
- You... You don't mind do you?
- Mind what?

579
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,549
My getting married.

580
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,593
I should love to go out with you again,
I had an awfully good time.

581
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,352
So did I.
Of course I don't mind.

582
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,916
Actually
I'm kinda glad you're all tied up,

583
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,235
now we can go out and have fun
without any pressure. Can't we?

584
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,152
Yes I guess so.

585
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,790
Goodnight Anne.

586
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,910
Goodnight Tom.

587
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,315
Mr. Irving Klinger.

588
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,159
We're ready with Mr. Edgar Klinger
in London. Go ahead please.

589
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,028
Hello! Hello! Ed this is Irv,
how are you twinsie?

590
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,436
Buzzing old boy.
Simply buzzing.

591
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,755
I got a fast note by airmail
from Tombo this morning.

592
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,949
He says everything is terrif.

593
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,038
Well, that is good news.

594
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,515
Tell me have you heard
from Tom?

595
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,873
No. How are things?

596
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,957
Absolutely superb.

597
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,277
We should have a fantastic opening
night tomorrow night. Fantastic.

598
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,000
What about Ellen? Tom having trouble
keeping her caged up at night?

599
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,958
Oh no. Quite the contrary,
she's been frightfully conscientious.

600
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,270
Goes straight home
from the theatre each night.

601
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,551
Tom's the one
who's been romping about.

602
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,990
Tom? No kidding. What did he do,
catch himself a chick?

603
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,515
No. No. No.
Tom's quite well.

604
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,915
He's taken a fancy to some girl
in the show. Pretty little thing she is too.

605
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,634
Hey Eddie, call me
after the opening, will you?

606
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,275
The light in the window's
gonna be me sitting and waiting.

607
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,834
I will do old boy.
Don't give it a second thought.

608
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,560
By the by,
how's the Mater?

609
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,795
Oh, Mom's fine.

610
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,115
Oh splendid. Do give her a peck
on the cheek for me.

611
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,559
I gotcha.
Dig you tomorrow night.

612
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,596
Pip now.

613
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,435
Pip Now?

614
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,915
Dig you?

615
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,229
(Crowds cheering)

616
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,918
What's
all the commotion about?

617
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,349
Some regiment that hasn't
paraded its finery in years.

618
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,078
You can just feel
the excitement growing!

619
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,919
The wedding's
only a week off!

620
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,518
I wonder what the groom
is doing this morning?

621
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,519
Well why don't you
call him and ask him?

622
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,116
Very funny.

623
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,349
Well I thought it was.

624
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,752
What time did you get in
last night, lover boy?

625
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,428
Around eleven I guess. I don't know,
I didn't pay much attention.

626
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,312
Well I did.
It was around two.

627
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,308
My! You're a busy little man
these p. M's, aren't you?

628
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,272
We were just having
a few laughs.

629
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,037
Just a few laughs?

630
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,996
That's all.

631
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,036
Ha.

632
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,556
(Door buzzer)

633
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,510
Come in!

634
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,352
Morning.

635
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,788
Johnny!
What a pleasant surprise?

636
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,035
- How are you?
- Fine.

637
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,195
- Hi John.
- Hello Tom.

638
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,992
I thought this was
a good place to see the parade.

639
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,237
We have a sensational view. Before
I forget: Your ticket for the opening.

640
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,595
Second row
right on the aisle.

641
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,630
Wonderful,
thanks very much.

642
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,510
What time is the parade?

643
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,749
Should pass here any minute.

644
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,238
Ellen, wonderful seeing you again,
how's the show going?

645
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,550
Just fine.
Gee, it's been a long time.

646
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,789
I know four days.

647
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,993
(Noise of bagpipes) Tomorrow after the
opening, Edgar's giving a party.

648
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,315
You're going with me, OK.

649
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,835
- OK. It'll take a little doing though.
- Why?

650
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,195
There's a huge affair being given,
and I'm supposed to take someone.

651
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,351
But you can get out of it, can't you?
This is my opening night.

652
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,991
Besides, if you don't take me,
nobody will.

653
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,998
(Sound of bagpipes,
getting increasingly loud)

654
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,149
I'll get out of it.

655
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,550
You're looking so well these days.

656
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,311
Thank you.

657
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,515
I think about you so much.

658
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,630
I think about you Ellen.

659
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,357
What?

660
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,834
I said I think about you.

661
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,350
It's so different from anything
I ever felt before.

662
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,032
How?

663
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,916
First of all, I'm not interested
in anybody or anything I do.

664
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,239
And that's completely new for me.

665
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,111
Huh?

666
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,392
(Shouting) I said
that's completely new for me.

667
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,878
Ellen, I think
this is getting very serious.

668
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,878
(Sounds of bagpipes fading)

669
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,430
What a parade.

670
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,312
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

671
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,271
Parade?

672
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,515
Oh it's over.

673
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,635
Wait. I'll tell them
to come back.

674
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,111
Oh ignore him Johnny
I'm so excited

675
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,990
about tomorrow night.

676
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,077
Come on girl we're due
at the theatre, five minutes ago.

677
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,950
Um. In a minute.

678
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,078
Do you realise we've only
Been out at night together,

679
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,713
about three times
since I've been here.

680
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,716
Well.

681
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,517
Come on, come on.

682
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,550
Oh, Just a minute.

683
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,154
What's that your playing Tom?

684
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,316
The song she's supposed be
rehearsing at the theatre, now.

685
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,758
Oh why don't you
rehearse it here?

686
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,556
Oh, that's a good idea.
Is that alright with you Tommy?

687
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,231
Alright.

688
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,557
I wake up and sigh
each morning.

689
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,953
Happy the night's gone by.

690
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,235
I wake up and pray
each morning.

691
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,556
Pray that the day will fly.

692
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,671
And then,
I sit back and smile...

693
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,836
and dream of that day...

694
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:20,079
when I'll be standing by your side,
my love.

695
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,878
The happiest day of my life.

696
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,919
How my heart will swell
with pride, my love.

697
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,669
The happiest day in a lifetime.

698
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,590
Then, as the last words
are spoken,

699
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:07,237
the bells
in the steeple will chime.

700
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,160
And I will love you so,

701
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,919
and you will see.

702
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,752
It will be for a lifetime.

703
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,479
Hold it. Hold it, please.
Charlie what time is it?

704
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,908
It's four a.m. Sir.

705
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,152
Oh that's enough. Alright everybody
that will be all for tonight.

706
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,833
I'm sorry to keep you
working so late.

707
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,473
What about
our last two numbers, Tom?

708
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,995
We don't have to rehearse those.
You were fine this afternoon.

709
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,270
I thought so too. The show
looks pretty good, doesn't it?

710
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,958
Not bad. Anne!

711
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,035
Yes?

712
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,716
Don't forget tomorrow night.

713
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,593
The opening, how could I?

714
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,549
Oh yes, do try to make that
we'd love to have you.

715
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,071
I meant afterwards. Edgar's
giving a party, we'll go together.

716
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,839
Oh Tom I can't.

717
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,788
You can't. Why not?

718
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,268
Hal is calling.

719
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,674
Oh that's right. I forgot all about him.
Well it doesn't matter.

720
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,833
I wouldn't bother, except I haven't heard
from him for such a long time now,

721
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,998
and I do have
to talk to him.

722
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,394
Taking the bus home
tonight Anne?

723
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,915
I'll be right with you.
Sorry Tom.

724
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,999
Oh, that's alright.

725
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,471
(Male voice)
What time tomorrow Sir?

726
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,074
Three o'clock for the company.
Eleven for Miss Bowen and me.

727
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,432
Eleven?!
What for, Tom?

728
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,192
I want to take those two numbers
we didn't do tonight.

729
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,078
I thought you were
satisfied with them.

730
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,355
There's still
a few rough spots.

731
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,550
What happened to you?
Did you get stood up?

732
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,955
What are you talking about?

733
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,949
My! What a manic
depressive life you lead.

734
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,630
It's going to be a
marvellous party tomorrow night.

735
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,593
I'm going with John.
Who are you taking?

736
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,073
(Humming) Every night at seven...
Dum dum dum.

737
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,678
Da de di dum
de dum dem.

738
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,439
- Where's the key?
- Well you have it.

739
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,835
I have not. I gave it to you.

740
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,072
I'll suppose I'll have to go
all the way down to the desk and...

741
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,149
See, if you think nice things,
all doors open to you.

742
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,032
Is that
your message for the day?

743
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,670
Flowers! For me.
I wonder who they're from.

744
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,195
Not from me.

745
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,349
Oh, well that I know.

746
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,270
Who?

747
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,269
It's from John.
Can't make the opening.

748
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,118
He can't?
My! What a shame!

749
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,790
I had a feeling this morning
he wouldn't be able to make it,

750
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,239
but he just
didn't know how to tell me.

751
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,794
Isn't that terrible?
Now isn't that terrible?

752
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,309
He's weak
and I just hate weak people.

753
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,152
Yes dear, I know you do.

754
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,590
Up one minute, down the next.
What a manic-depressive life you lead.

755
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,434
Alright, alright,
so we're even.

756
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,718
Who are you going
with tomorrow night?

757
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,075
I don't know.

758
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,517
Why don't you take me?

759
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,153
I think we should go together anyway.
After all, we're the stars of the show.

760
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,833
Yes
I think we should...

761
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,757
Miss Bowen may I escort you to
Klinger's clambake tomorrow night?

762
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,636
Why, I'd be delighted, and
what a surprise you're asking me.

763
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,670
Oh Tommy,
let's be terrific tomorrow night.

764
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,398
- We'll be cosmic.
- Stupendous.

765
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,391
A smash! We hope.

766
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,791
And Ellen, don't forget that's
still the most important thing.

767
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,030
Yes Tommy, I know it is.

768
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:56,957
Goodnight.

769
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,757
Goodnight.

770
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,589
(Overlapping dialogue) - Oh yeah, yeah.
- You listen to me just once.

771
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,996
- Oh sure.
- I've told you a million times.

772
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,309
You never want
to listen to me.

773
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,597
Yeah. So I said it.
So you heard it. So what?

774
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,599
So this. It's the last time
I'll ever go to a party with you.

775
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,835
Will you put that in writing?

776
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,109
Well you're always
making cracks.

777
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:27,797
Like what?

778
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,195
Well you're always
humiliating me.

779
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,073
Didn't your mother never
teach you no manners?

780
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,270
I never had no mother,
we was too poor.

781
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,958
Say what's the matter
with you lately?

782
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,799
You used to tell me
you loved me.

783
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,515
You used to treat me like a high-class
dame. Well, usedn't you?

784
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,079
- So I used.
- So there you admit it.

785
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,553
I ain't admitting nothing.

786
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,638
I'll give you one more chance.
Do you love me or don't you?

787
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,749
No I don't.

788
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,751
Quit stalling.
I want a direct answer.

789
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,032
There's one thing about you
I can't understand.

790
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,835
(Starts singing) How could you
believe me when I said I love ya?

791
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,191
When you know
I've been a liar all my life.

792
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,190
You've had that reputation
since you was a youth.

793
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,268
You must have been insane
to think I'd tell you the truth.

794
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,876
How could I believe you
when ya said we'd marry?

795
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,436
Well, you know
I'd rather hang than have a wife.

796
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,436
I know I said
I'd make you mine.

797
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,515
Now wouldn't you's know
that I would go for that old line.

798
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,236
How could you believe me
when I said I love you?

799
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,073
When you know
I've been a liar.

800
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,151
You sure have been a liar.

801
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,952
A double-crossing liar.

802
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,912
A double-crossing liar.

803
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,640
All my doggone cheating life.

804
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,953
You said you would
love me long.

805
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,910
So what?

806
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,874
And never would do
me wrong.

807
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,474
Stop bending the suit.

808
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,676
Faithful you'd always be.

809
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,316
Me?

810
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,076
Why baby you must be loony to trust
a lower than low two-timer like me.

811
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,273
You said I'd have everything.

812
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,835
Get her.

813
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,195
A beautiful diamond ring.

814
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,074
Ha. Ha. Ha.

815
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,316
A bungalow by the sea.

816
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,909
A bungalow yet.

817
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,557
You're really naive to ever believe
a full of baloney phony like me.

818
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,393
Why, I should have
just lost my head.

819
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,079
You ain't lost nothing
you never had.

820
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,518
What about the time
you went to Indiana?

821
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,917
I was lying
I was down in Ala-bam.

822
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,070
You said you had some business
you had to complete.

823
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,597
What I was doing
I would be a cad to repeat.

824
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,551
What about the evening's
you was with your mother?

825
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,558
I was romping
with another honey-lamb.

826
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,717
To think you swore
our love was real.

827
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,556
Baby leave us not forget
that I am a heal.

828
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,478
How could I believe you
when you said you loved me?

829
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,517
Why,
you know I've been a liar?

830
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,073
A good for nothing liar.

831
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,993
All my good for nothing life.

832
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,397
(Music goes mad)

833
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,192
You know you've been a liar.

834
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,958
I know I've been a liar.

835
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,752
A double-crossing liar.

836
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,359
A double-crossing liar.

837
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,990
All your good-for-nothing life.

838
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,278
(Applause)

839
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,949
Johnny!

840
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,710
Darling I just had to come.
I just had to.

841
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,432
- Who's that with Ellen?
- Who?

842
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,879
- The chap with the accent.
- Him?

843
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,115
- Yes.
- Brindale.

844
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:39,712
Aah.

845
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,509
They've become very good friends.

846
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,590
Oh yes.

847
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,070
Don't you think we should
be getting over to Edgar's?

848
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,269
Later Johnny.

849
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,472
Tonight's my night
and tonight I want to be alone with you.

850
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,309
When you didn't show up at the
opening,

851
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,668
I didn't even feel like going on.

852
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,955
How'd you get away from your party?

853
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,590
Oh I just walked out. I couldn't stand
not being with you tonight.

854
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,273
Ellen, Ellen, I think we're in love.

855
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,193
Yes darling I know.

856
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,432
Well what are we going to do about it?

857
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,316
Nothing.

858
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,190
Well we can't go on
in this indefinite state.

859
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,749
Well aren't you happy?

860
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,509
Oh you know I am.

861
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,910
So am I, let's not kill it
with improvement now.

862
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,712
But something might happen.

863
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,830
Like what?

864
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,913
Well, some day, you might look over
my shoulder and see someone else.

865
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,310
Someone else?

866
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,230
Yes.

867
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:37,792
(Starts singing)
Too late now to forget your smile.

868
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:42,915
The way we cling
when we dance awhile.

869
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:50,553
Too late now to forget
and go on to someone new.

870
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,957
Too late now
to forget your voice.

871
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,755
The way one word
makes my heart rejoice.

872
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:16,110
Too late now
to imagine myself away from you.

873
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:30,996
All the things we've done together.
I relive when we're apart.

874
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:43,274
All the tender fun together
stays on in my heart.

875
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:59,270
How could I ever close the door
and be the same as I was before.

876
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:11,470
Darling. No, no I can't anymore.
It's too late now.

877
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,991
(Johnny whistling the tune)

878
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,918
- Does Tom know how you feel?
- Oh goodness no.

879
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,958
Do you think he'd mind?

880
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,229
Well, I imagine if he ever found
out he'd get us a booking

881
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,716
some place in South Africa,
just to get me away from you.

882
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,239
Would you forget about me
in South Africa?

883
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,313
Well how could I?

884
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,438
(Starts singing)
All the things we've done together,

885
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,070
I relive when we're apart.

886
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,357
All the tender fun together

887
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,111
stays on in my heart.

888
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:38,833
How could I ever close the door?
And be the same as I was before.

889
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:49,790
Darling no, no I can't anymore.
It's too late now.

890
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,391
(Rattle on door)
Who is it?

891
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,118
It's me Jamie, Tom.

892
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,319
Tommy me boy,
come in.

893
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,993
You all closed up
for the night?

894
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,118
Well, it's after two. But I never
close for you Tommy boy.

895
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:33,990
Thanks.

896
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,075
The show went well?

897
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,839
Fine! I didn't feel like going home
straight after the party

898
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,598
so I thought I'd stop by
and say hello.

899
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,709
Well you're just in time.

900
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,034
It was announced we go to see
the presents on Monday.

901
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:44,512
Thanks.

902
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,358
I was just about to try on
me suit for the Palace.

903
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,959
I'll slip into it. You have a look,
then you can tell me what you think?

904
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,989
Sure. Oh by the way,
isn't this Anne's night to visit you?

905
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,072
Yes, she was by
about an hour ago.

906
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,595
Picked up her money
and stole away like a pickpocket.

907
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,632
Did her call come through
from Chicago?

908
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,434
Naw! The bloomin' blighter
never called.

909
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,109
She must be upset?

910
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,309
Well I couldn't say.

911
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,556
I don't know
how Anne feels about anything.

912
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,036
She's not an easy one to get to know.
Very quiet she is, but deep.

913
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,118
At least I hope she is deep,

914
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,470
or else she's wasting
a lot of her time being quiet.

915
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,310
Well, brace yourself.

916
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,396
What do you think?
Do I look like a gentleman?

917
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,271
Jamie,
you look like a banker.

918
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,592
- But do I look like a gentleman?
- It's written all over you.

919
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,711
I got it this afternoon
from Percy Munro.

920
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,350
Last year, when he got pneumonia,
they bought it for him to be buried in.

921
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,469
But he recovered.

922
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,879
My only advice is, if you meet the
Royal Family, I wouldn't bow too low.

923
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,429
Remember this is a wedding,
not a coming out party.

924
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,432
I see what you mean.
I'll watch it.

925
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,276
Are you excited?

926
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,477
Excited. No, I'm just scared.
Nervous and scared.

927
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,317
Why?

928
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,155
It's meeting the old crow again. I haven't
clapped eyes on her in three years.

929
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:56,712
I know.

930
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,632
It's funny, if it wasn't
for this Royal Wedding,

931
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,791
probably I'd never
cross her path again.

932
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,710
I tell you what.

933
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,274
On Monday, I'll call for you
and take you down to meet her.

934
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,310
I'll give you moral support.

935
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,193
That's nice of you, Tommy.
Unusually nice of you.

936
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,199
You're a good man
you are.

937
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,912
I don't know what Annie's doing waiting
for this knucklehead in Chicago

938
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,435
when she knows a fellow like you
here in town.

939
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,239
That's love Jamie.

940
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,429
What about you?

941
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,558
Do I look like
the settling down kind?

942
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,795
Come on let me out.

943
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,475
Oops. I'll do the bending,
I'm dressed for it.

944
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,555
Thank you Tommy.

945
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,036
Goodnight pal.

946
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,115
Goodnight buddy.

947
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,552
(Tommy voice-over in song)
Everywhere that beauty glows you are.

948
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,635
Everywhere an orchid grows
you are.

949
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:24,073
Everything that's young and gay.
Brighter than a holiday.

950
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,438
Everywhere the angels play
you are.

951
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:40,756
You're like Paris in April and May.
You're New York on a silvery day.

952
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:45,628
A Swiss Alp
as the sun grows fainter.

953
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,833
You're Loch Lomond
when autumn is the painter.

954
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:57,629
You're moonlight on a night in Capri.
And Cape Cod looking out at the sea.

955
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,195
You're all places
that leave me breathless.

956
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,918
And no wonder,
you're all the world to me.

957
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,111
(Singing) Every night at seven.
Dum de Dem.

958
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,552
(Ellen)
Come in!

959
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,749
- Morning.
- Oh hello Edgar.

960
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,673
Absolutely fantastic notices,
everyone.

961
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,189
You could stay on for years.
Have you seen the dailies?

962
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,470
- Rather!
- Oh, we're so thrilled.

963
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,431
There's been an eight-week call
at the libraries.

964
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,913
There's been a what?
At the what?

965
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,112
The libraries, old boy.
That's what we call our ticket brokers.

966
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,755
They want block of seats
eight weeks in advance.

967
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,114
Why didn't you say so?

968
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,316
Oh Tom, did you see the one
where they say we're brilliant?

969
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,037
Where?

970
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,554
Oh Edgar have you called Irving yet?
- I'm off to the office now.

971
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,718
(Phone rings)
I'll take it in my room.

972
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,999
Edgar, sit down a sec, will you?
I want you to do a favour for me.

973
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,354
At your command old boy.

974
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,756
When you call Irving, ask him
to find out what happened to a boy

975
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,155
who used to work at Ogilvies
Department Store in Chicago.

976
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,631
His name is, er, Hal Rayton.
I've written it all down.

977
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,672
- Oh, right you are.
- Will you do that?

978
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,515
And don't say anything
to anybody about it. Will ya?

979
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,995
It shall be graveyard old boy.
Graveyard.

980
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,639
- Thanks.
- Cheerio!

981
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,076
This is New York.
We're ready in London.

982
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,793
Mr Irving Klinger
is on the line.

983
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,195
Hello. Hello.

984
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,191
Irving there. Edgar here.

985
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,595
- Hey Eddie, so how are things?
- Buzzin' right along.

986
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,432
Smash huh.
So how are the notices?

987
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,868
Wizard old boy,
wizard!

988
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,313
- That bad, huh?
- No. No. No. Wizard, wizard.

989
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,239
Oh!
Wizard.

990
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:40,474
Yes. Now look, Tom wants you to
follow up on a chap named Hal Rayton.

991
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,912
Hal Rayton, huh.
What does he do a single?

992
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,150
Mr. Rayton is not
in the theatrical profession.

993
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,072
He ain't in the theatre,
so who needs him?

994
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,673
It's a personal matter
of Tom's.

995
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,070
When last heard from,
Mr. Rayton was employed

996
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,316
at Ogilvies department store
in Chicago.

997
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,791
Ogilvies. Dig ya. I'll throw
the hassle to our Chicago branch.

998
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,309
Have the whole mess in your lap
in a fast two days.

999
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,999
No, no,
that won't be necessary.

1000
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,196
Just follow up on the Rayton matter
and let us know.

1001
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,035
Nadge. I just said:
Pip now!

1002
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,629
Oh. Oh yes, er er...
Dig you!

1003
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,235
Oh,
there's Jamie for you.

1004
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,315
Wouldn't you know he'd be late?
Even to the Palace.

1005
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,835
Now take it easy, Mother,
maybe the traffic was heavy.

1006
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,912
It's not the traffic, it's Jamie.
Ever since I told him

1007
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:31,112
I don't like to be kept waiting,
he's been keeping me waiting.

1008
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,278
You know Mother, there's an old
Spanish proverb which goes:

1009
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,472
He who doesn't love the faults
of his loved one doesn't love at all.

1010
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,156
That may be well and good
for the Spanish, but I'm English.

1011
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,878
- Do you know what I think?
- No dearie.

1012
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,553
I think he's excited
about seeing you.

1013
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,829
- Do you think so?
- Mm...

1014
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,679
- How do I look?
- As elegant as can be.

1015
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,679
Tommy,
tell him he's going too fast.

1016
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,230
- Driver, could you slow down a little?
- Yes Sir.

1017
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,153
What if we stopped to have a quick one,
to the health of the Royal Couple?

1018
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,272
Sit back Jamie,
we're not stopping anywhere.

1019
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,955
- Tell him to go a little slower.
- He can't. Don't be so nervous.

1020
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,754
When you see her, be sure you act
like the gentleman you look like.

1021
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,836
I will. But if she says
one word of criticism,

1022
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,109
I'll hit her on the head
with this cap.

1023
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,993
You'll do nothing of the kind.
Here we are, stop here driver.

1024
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,518
Walk the rest of the way.

1025
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,639
Go on now, don't lose your nerve.
Get in there. Go on.

1026
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,435
Hello Jamie.

1027
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,396
Good-day Sarah.

1028
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,154
Jamie, your suit's handsome,
handsome.

1029
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:45,429
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

1030
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,512
The traffic was heavy today.

1031
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,710
I told the cabby
to go as fast as he could.

1032
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,476
- Shall we go?
- Allow me.

1033
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,356
Jamie don't.

1034
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,117
I knew the code. There are some days
when you can do nothing wrong.

1035
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,556
- Do you think they'll stay together?
- Sure.

1036
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,318
I hope so. For them as well as for me.
I could never have left Mother alone.

1037
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,672
Now you can get married
and forget about it.

1038
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,750
Yes...

1039
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,278
(Knock on door)
Yeah.

1040
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,272
- Good evening.
- Edgar!

1041
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,954
I have the information you require
regarding Mr. Rayton.

1042
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:21,876
Oh, what?

1043
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,555
Oh it's nothing terribly exciting.
Mr. Rayton still works at Ogilvies.

1044
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,872
He's still in the luggage department.
He used to live in Chicago proper,

1045
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,634
but not long ago, he and his wife
moved to Evanston.

1046
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,510
His wife?

1047
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,358
Why yes, he was married
several months ago.

1048
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,673
My, my, my!

1049
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,151
I say,
who is this chap anyway?

1050
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,995
He was engaged to a girl in the show.
I was just finding out about him for her.

1051
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,794
- Oh I say that's frightful.
- Yes isn't it.

1052
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,872
Well, what are you
so pleased about?

1053
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:51,077
I always smile when I'm
heartbroken. I'd better tell her.

1054
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,913
Oh no, not now. Don't you think you
should wait until after the performance?

1055
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,149
It would seem kinder.

1056
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,148
Maybe you're right.
Edgar, you're a real pal.

1057
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,633
I'd stick up for you anytime.

1058
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,399
Thanks old chap, that's frightfully
decent of you to say.

1059
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,959
Well,
if you'll excuse me.

1060
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,271
Oh, I shall be around to pick you up
early tomorrow morning.

1061
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,231
- What's tomorrow?
- Why the Royal Wedding.

1062
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,079
And I shall take you some place
where you'll see all the pageantry.

1063
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:12,837
Great.

1064
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,036
(Male voice)
Second act Mr. Bowen!

1065
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:41,958
I left my hat in Haiti.
In some forgotten flat in Haiti.

1066
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:49,875
I couldn't tell you how I got there.
I only know it was so hot there.

1067
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,031
She took my hat politely.

1068
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,591
And wound her arms
around me tightly.

1069
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,748
But I remember
nothing clearly.

1070
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,550
Except the flame
when she came near me.

1071
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:14,074
Her eyes had the fire of surrender.
And her touch, it was tender.

1072
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,431
And I guess in the moment as that,
you'd forget about your hat.

1073
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:28,792
So if you go to Haiti,
there is a girl I know in Haiti.

1074
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,079
If you can find her
you'll adore her.

1075
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,879
Just look around
till you find someone

1076
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,077
who has a blue grey fedora.

1077
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:47,071
I think of that gorgeous creature
when I'm all alone.

1078
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:55,030
Whenever I do, from down inside
there comes a groan.

1079
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:03,235
That son of a gun in Haiti
has got the prettiest hat I own.

1080
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,795
When it's bleak and chilly
and life is flat.

1081
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,912
I think of that Haitian dilly.

1082
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,280
And think
I'd better go get my hat.

1083
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,677
I left my hat in Haiti.

1084
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:10,355
In some forgotten flat in Haiti.
I couldn't tell you how I got there.

1085
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,351
I only know
it was so hot there.

1086
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,869
But I remember
nothing clearly.

1087
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:29,351
Except the flame
when she came near me.

1088
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,838
(Chorus) Her eyes
had the fire of surrender.

1089
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,918
And her touch,
it was tender.

1090
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:45,435
And I guess in a moment as that.
You'd forget about your hat.

1091
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:52,591
So if you go to Haiti.
There is a girl I know in Haiti.

1092
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,594
If you can find her
you'll adore her.

1093
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,873
Just look around and you'll find
someone who has a blue-grey fedora.

1094
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,599
(Applause)

1095
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,076
Ellen!

1096
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,120
Ellen,
got anybody to take you home?

1097
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,270
Good.

1098
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,673
- Goodnight Mr. Bowen.
- Goodnight.

1099
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,998
Anne,
I've something to tell you.

1100
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:54,956
Yes.

1101
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,436
I hope you won't think
I've butted in where I shouldn't have.

1102
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,160
But Jamie told me
your friend didn't call.

1103
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,036
Oh?

1104
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,835
I didn't ask. He told me.
I don't quite know why I did it

1105
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,191
but I decided to try and find out
what happened to him.

1106
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,110
Did you?

1107
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,870
Yes I did.

1108
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:11,910
Well?

1109
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,474
Anne, he's married.

1110
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,116
Married?

1111
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,630
I'm sorry.

1112
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,392
How wonderful,
how simply wonderful.

1113
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,071
Oh Tom, thank you.

1114
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,676
Oh it was nothing...
Anne...

1115
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,472
I've been worrying myself
to death over him

1116
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,710
on account of you
and he's been married all the time.

1117
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,029
Isn't it wonderful?

1118
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,959
What do you mean
on account of me?

1119
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,953
On account of me being in love with you
and you being in love with me.

1120
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,310
I'm in love with you?

1121
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:45,795
Well aren't you?

1122
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,429
Yeah.

1123
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,275
What a mess.

1124
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,630
The next thing that happens,
we'll be thinking about getting married.

1125
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,028
I'm thinking about it right now.

1126
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,076
There you see.

1127
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,679
Well,
don't you want to marry me?

1128
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:06,036
Yes I do.
Anne, it isn't you it's marriage.

1129
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,669
I'm afraid I couldn't be married
and make a go of it.

1130
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,633
I've been living one way too long.
For me it's always been work.

1131
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,552
Everything else has just been
a side issue.

1132
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,359
It isn't because
I don't want to,

1133
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,512
it's just
that I... I don't know if I could change.

1134
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,237
Anne, I'll know
I'll be an awful flop as a husband.

1135
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,429
Do you understand?

1136
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,993
I think I do Tom.

1137
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,190
What'll we do?

1138
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,198
Perhaps
you'd better take me home.

1139
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,559
Tom,
I only disagree with one thing.

1140
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,276
What's that?

1141
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,791
I think you'll make
a marvellous husband.

1142
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,070
You do?

1143
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,192
Yes I do Tom.

1144
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:22,916
Hi.

1145
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,675
Hi.
You're back early.

1146
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,589
It isn't early.

1147
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,315
I thought it was.

1148
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,798
Well it isn't. It's late.

1149
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,556
Is it?

1150
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,710
Hm?

1151
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,349
I didn't say anything.

1152
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,512
Tom,
John wants to marry me.

1153
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,071
He does?
That's funny.

1154
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,434
It might be to you,
but it's terribly serious to him.

1155
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,872
He's very much in love with me.

1156
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,191
He says he's found a new faith,
and everything. All on account of me.

1157
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,714
How do you feel?

1158
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,751
Well, very constructive.

1159
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,199
I never thought
I'd see the day

1160
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,675
you'd inspire anybody
to do anything but slug it out.

1161
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,555
Alright,
go ahead make fun of me.

1162
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,877
I'm sorry Ellie. You really are
involved this time, aren't you?

1163
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,309
Up to here.

1164
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,677
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

1165
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,276
I was hoping you'd make up my mind
for me, like you usually do.

1166
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,908
It sure is funny.

1167
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,079
Why do you keep saying that?
When it isn't funny at all.

1168
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,519
It's very important.

1169
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:30,675
I know it is.

1170
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,714
I only meant it's funny because
Anne wants me to marry her.

1171
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,715
She does?

1172
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,959
My gosh,
it sure is funny, isn't it?

1173
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,750
Why?

1174
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,554
I don't know.
It's just funny that's all.

1175
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,989
What's so funny about someone
wanting to marry me?

1176
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,111
I have
a few good points you know.

1177
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,316
Tommy, are you really
in love with her?

1178
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,874
Up to here.

1179
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,035
I wonder
what would happen

1180
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,594
if we just threw over all our principles
and got married anyway.

1181
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,432
You'll stay here
in England with John?

1182
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,595
Why would I stay here?

1183
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,950
You can't go traipsing all over the world
and leave your husband at home.

1184
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,752
What kind of a marriage
would that be?

1185
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:15,954
No, I suppose not.
Well, what would you do?

1186
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,233
- I'd marry Anne and...
- I mean who would you dance with?

1187
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,430
I never thought of that,
I might try Anne, if she wants to,

1188
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,949
she loves to dance
and shows a lot of promise.

1189
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,390
- Do you really think so?
- Yeah.

1190
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,912
I thought she was
a little awkward myself.

1191
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,633
So were you
when you started.

1192
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,439
I know it but it takes years
to build a good team.

1193
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,549
You've always said that.

1194
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,869
And there's a lot of excitement
in doing it.

1195
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,635
- It just isn't fair Tommy.
- What isn't?

1196
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,518
I'm getting the short end
of the stick.

1197
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,277
What?

1198
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,833
You want me to settle back
and get out of the way,

1199
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,116
while you go off with someone
and have all of the fun.

1200
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,512
I think
it's rotten of you, Tommy.

1201
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,510
I didn't ask you to...

1202
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,035
Everything's been so perfect,
we've had a wonderful life together.

1203
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,958
We've been very successful. How can
you even consider breaking it up?

1204
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,917
And for what,
to get married?

1205
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,076
Oh no Tom,
marriage is a tough business.

1206
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,269
You know what I've always
thought of marriage.

1207
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,436
Responsibilities. Obligations.
A home to take care of.

1208
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,152
Maybe children to look after.

1209
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,236
Imagine being married
to someone you're dancing with.

1210
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,157
If either the marriage
or the dancing doesn't work out

1211
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,315
both of them go kabooey.

1212
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,874
No, Thomas,
it's a terrible chance to take.

1213
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,595
It is, isn't it?

1214
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:13,277
We mustn't do it.

1215
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,038
We've slaved too hard
to get where we are.

1216
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,275
Why should we give it up?

1217
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,429
It does seem foolish,
doesn't it?

1218
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,791
We're a team and a darn good one,
we ought to stay that way.

1219
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:21,836
Maybe you're right.

1220
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,470
Of course I'm right.
You do see it, don't you Tommy?

1221
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,795
Sure I see it. It's you and me
just like it's always been.

1222
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,433
I'm sure we're doing the right thing.
Thank you so much for deciding for me.

1223
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,391
Forget it.

1224
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,355
(Children singing) What a lovely day
for a wedding. Happy are we to say.

1225
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:56,308
It's a lovely day for a wedding.
Lovely in every way.

1226
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,719
The sun is out, the flower is out.
To see what all the joy's about.

1227
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,991
For everywhere
the world is merry and gay.

1228
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,873
What a lovely day for a wedding.
Over again we say.

1229
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,908
It's a lovely lovely lovely
wedding day.

1230
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:21,154
(Singing) What a lovely day for a
wedding. Happy are we to say.

1231
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,237
It's a lovely day
for a wedding.

1232
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,038
Lovely in every way.

1233
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:29,268
The Royal Guard is ********
Scotland Yard.

1234
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,398
Big Ben
**** the time of the day.

1235
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,350
What a lovely day for a wedding.
Over again we say.

1236
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,599
- It's a lovely, lovely wedding.
- A lovely, lovely wedding.

1237
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,632
- Lovely.
- Lovely.

1238
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,831
- Lovely.
- Lovely.

1239
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,759
Wedding day!

1240
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,512
- Hello.
- Good morning old chappie.

1241
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,954
- Hello Edgar.
- Good morning.

1242
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,348
I've come to take you
to the wedding

1243
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,596
and what a wedding parade
we shall see.

1244
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,035
- Are you ready?
- As ready as I'll ever be.

1245
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,192
What's the matter with you two this
morning? You all at sixes and sevens.

1246
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,554
Nothing's the matter.
Let's go.

1247
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:53,473
- Tom...
- Ellie I've got to have her. I lose.

1248
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,431
So do I.
I want to get married today!

1249
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:55,912
Today?

1250
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,156
Yes, before I change my mind.
Do you think we can do it?

1251
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,231
Edgar,
we want to get married.

1252
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:00,991
I thought
you two were related.

1253
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,838
Oh no, no... And we want
to get married today.

1254
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,479
But it takes three weeks.

1255
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,232
Three weeks! Anything can happen
in three weeks.

1256
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,157
- You can fix it for us Edgar.
- Irving says you can do anything.

1257
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,033
I know, but one must have permission
from the Archbishop's office.

1258
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,798
After all,
he's busy today.

1259
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,029
You've got to swing it
for us Edgar.

1260
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,158
I'll try. You two meet me
at the Vicar General's in two hours.

1261
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,590
If it's at all possible to get a licence,
you shall be married this afternoon.

1262
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,709
Where, where?

1263
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,956
Clyde Street Church.
I believe I know the minister there.

1264
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,759
This is pretty box of pickles.
I beg your pardon Sir.

1265
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,269
- Now what can we do?
- We have to find Anne and John.

1266
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:29,991
In these crowds?

1267
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,076
I know what corner she's standing on.
Where's John?

1268
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,271
Should be leaving the Abbey
for the reception any minute now.

1269
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,910
You'd better find him. Ellen, I'm
going to miss you a lot from now on.

1270
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,032
Tommy,
you're a wonderful brother.

1271
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:40,876
Good luck, darling.

1272
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:41,638
Thanks, Tommy.

1273
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,789
Excuse me, excuse me.

1274
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,319
Will you excuse me.

1275
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:09,916
John!

1276
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,199
- Ellen, what's the matter?
- John I want to marry you.

1277
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,550
- What?
- I said I want to marry you.

1278
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,510
You do?

1279
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,676
Yes, meet me at Clyde Street church
at four o'clock.

1280
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,198
Right.

1281
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,351
What do you think
you're doing miss?

1282
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,993
Oh officer,
I love you.

1283
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,593
Anne! Anne!

1284
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:30,910
Tom!

1285
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,636
- Will you marry me?
- What?

1286
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:36,189
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

1287
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,117
They didn't have to go to all this trouble,
a small wedding would've been alright.
