00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:09,468
BEACH PARTY

2
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,544
<i>We got an early start</i>

3
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,823
<i>We're gonna have a ball</i>

4
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,538
<i>We're gonna ride the surf</i>

5
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,599
<i>And that ain't is all</i>

6
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,360
<i>Nothing is greater than
the sand, surf and salt air</i>

7
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,921
<i>Unrack our boards
just as soon as we get there</i>

8
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,464
<i>Stack 'em in the sand
while they're breaking' just right</i>

9
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,424
<i>Yeah, we're surfing' all day
and we're swinging' all night</i>

10
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:30,560
<i>Vacations is here
Beach party tonight</i>

11
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,130
<i>- We're chalking' our boards
- Chalking' our boards</i>

12
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,682
<i>- While we're in school
- We're in school</i>

13
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:40,982
<i>- Now we're waxing' our boards
- Waxing' our boards</i>

14
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:43,781
<i>At Balboa, too</i>

15
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:46,946
<i>Nothing is greater than
the sand, surf and salt air</i>

16
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:49,650
<i>Unrack our boards
just as soon as we get there</i>

17
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:52,160
<i>Stack 'em in the sand
while they're breaking' just right</i>

18
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:54,959
<i>Yeah, we're surfing' all day
and we're swinging' all night</i>

19
00:02:55,064 --> 00:02:59,899
<i>Vacation is here
Beach party tonight</i>

20
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:04,005
<i>Nothing is greater than
the sand, surf and salt air</i>

21
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:06,317
<i>Unrack our boards
just as soon as we get there</i>

22
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,444
<i>Stack them in the sand
while they're breaking just right</i>

23
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:12,107
<i>Yeah, we're surfing' all day
and we're swinging' all night</i>

24
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:16,948
<i>Vacation is here
Beach party tonight</i>

25
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:28,855
<i>Vacation is here
Beach party tonight</i>

26
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:49,144
Well, there it is, honey,
and it's all ours.

27
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:52,215
Just you and me all alone.

28
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,052
Exactly.

29
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,189
- It's just like we're married.
- Exactly!

30
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:12,019
There's nothing like the beach
early in the morning.

31
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:15,174
It's so quiet and peaceful
and mysterious.

32
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:18,253
- Come on. Let's get the stuff inside.
- Right now?

33
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,141
We've waited a long time.

34
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:24,549
You know, the only thing
I've studied this semester is you.

35
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,883
Well, I hope you don't flunk.

36
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:28,493
There's always summer
school, you know.

37
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:42,469
Hold it, Dolores.

38
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:45,966
We've got to do this right.

39
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,669
It's like there's nobody else
in the whole world.

40
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:52,314
That's right. Nobody else.

41
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:54,549
Just you and me.

42
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:00,008
- Just you and me.
- Exactly.

43
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:08,024
Hey!

44
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:13,409
- What's going on here?
- Deadhead! What are you doing here?

45
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,603
Sleeping. Good night.

46
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:18,109
Now, you get your big carcass out
of here before I pick you up...

47
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,135
- You're gonna wake everybody up.
- Who's everybody?

48
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:25,437
There's just me and Ken...

49
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:28,107
Tommy y Big Boy.

50
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:30,580
I guess about all of us.

51
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:33,090
- Gee, what a wonderful surprise.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:36,505
I wonder who thought
of this wonderful surprise.

53
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,599
This is such a big house, and
I didn't want you to get lonely.

54
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:42,753
She's all heart.

55
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:45,944
Well, you know it's more fun
with the whole gang.

56
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,786
- Not what I had in mind!
- Frankie, that's just it.

57
00:05:48,787 --> 00:05:51,325
I don't trust myself
when I'm alone with you.

58
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,799
- You really put me on.
- Frankie...

59
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:58,629
"Just the two of us. Nobody else in
the whole world. Like being married."

60
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,517
You're not going to get away with it.
I'm going to get rid of all these guys.

61
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:03,651
Then there's going to
be the two of us...

62
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:05,412
rattling around this
great big house together.

63
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:06,413
Frankie!

64
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:14,429
- Hey. Wall-to-wall girls.
- What are you doing here?

65
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,930
Get out of here.

66
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,833
You get out and stay out!

67
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:28,004
- Take off.
- Thanks for the invitation, Frankie.

68
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:33,652
Where'd I go wrong?

69
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:10,474
Hey, you're gonna rub a hole
right through it.

70
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:12,920
Hello, there.

71
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:16,020
Hi, there.

72
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:19,360
Come on. Let's go.

73
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:22,663
All right. You can go now.

74
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:24,530
- What do you mean?
- Get lost.

75
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,398
Well! I can see
the headlines now.

76
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,927
"Famed Anthropologist Dr. R.O. Sutwell
Arrested as a Peeping Tom."

77
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:51,528
My dear young woman,
at this moment, I'm concentrating...

78
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:55,440
on developmental biology
in human beings.

79
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:59,708
- That's what I mean.
- Marianne, I'm no match for your wit.

80
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,772
Here. Take a look, please.

81
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:04,819
Not me. I blush easily.
I'm a Philadelphia girl.

82
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,754
But tell me about it.

83
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:09,286
I presume you've guessed.
It's my new book.

84
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:11,504
By the way, how do
you like this title?

85
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,785
"The Behavioral Pattern
of the Young Adult

86
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:16,564
"and It's Relation to
Primitive Tribes."

87
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,665
- I've got a shorter title.
- What's that?

88
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:22,198
- Teenage Sex.
- You know, Marianne,

89
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:25,136
it's absolutely fascinating
how similar the behavior patterns...

90
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:27,608
of these young people is to
the other tribes we've observed.

91
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:31,375
Oh, come on, Professor,
these are just normal American kids.

92
00:11:31,446 --> 00:11:34,464
American, yes. Normal, no.

93
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:36,424
Marianne, they're a
true subculture.

94
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:40,415
They live in a society as primitive
as the aborigine of New Guinea.

95
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:42,515
Now, listen to this, quickly.

96
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:44,827
<i>- Dis you dig his action?
- His action?</i>

97
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:47,428
<i>He was hanging ten, when
he tried to shoot the pier,</i>

98
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:50,364
and dinged his board
just when he took the air.

99
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,415
- Maybe you've got a point.
- You bet I have.

100
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:58,197
I'm gonna need reference books All of
Max Jacobson's works on puberty rites.

101
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:01,104
Murchison's studies of the Aztec
fertility symbols at Spanish Key.

102
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,171
Coming of age.
That sort of things.

103
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,358
Marianne, this book will
be my triumph.

104
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:07,510
And you'll never get
it through the mails.

105
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:08,883
But hang on the
picture rights.

106
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:11,478
American International
will snap it up in a minute.

107
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,627
- I take then that you won't help me?
- Have I ever said no?

108
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:18,492
Come to think of it,
you never have.

109
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:19,721
I'll help.

110
00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:21,786
Thank you, Marianne.

111
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:25,745
- On one condition.
- Yes? What's that?

112
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,220
After you write this
book on sex...

113
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:29,804
Yes?

114
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:30,863
Read it.

115
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:48,355
Rhonda, what are you doing?

116
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:50,916
Watch. They come all unhinged.

117
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,929
See, it works every time.

118
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:15,742
At the present time
I am secluded approximately...

119
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:18,650
37 to 40 yards from the subject group.

120
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,223
Did it ever occur to you
that there's something else in life...

121
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:24,249
besides getting a boy?

122
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,560
- Like what?
- Love.

123
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:29,591
Here's something now.
Here's something coming in.

124
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:33,067
<i>What's your problem? Frankie giving
you the cold treatment or something?</i>

125
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:35,229
Deep freeze would be more like it.

126
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:36,737
You can't really blame him.

127
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:40,508
<i>He brought you down here alone, and you
turn the place into a teenage flophouse.</i>

128
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:43,137
Well, at the last minute
I got cold feet.

129
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:47,443
If somebody had wild plans for me,
why stop him?

130
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:53,614
Rhonda, I want Frankie to think of me
as more than just a girl.

131
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:57,092
- There's something else?
- Yes! A wife

132
00:13:57,607 --> 00:14:00,018
<i>Wife? Dee Dee,
you're not even a woman.</i>

133
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:02,694
<i>But I'm close.</i>

134
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:06,297
And I'm not getting any closer
until I'm a wife!

135
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:11,837
Dolores, come here!

136
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:19,376
The music you hear in the background
they're playing...

137
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:23,601
Oh, brief footnote on comparison
to Haitian voodoo ceremonial.

138
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,388
<i>Well, along the coast past Malibu</i>

139
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:30,217
<i>I make it every day
after school is through</i>

140
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:33,192
<i>My secret surfing' spot
where only I know</i>

141
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:35,526
<i>- The gremmies and the hodads never go
- Never go</i>

142
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:37,292
<i>I said the gremmies
and the hodads never go</i>

143
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,727
Incredible.

144
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,463
<i>Well, I'm hotdogging on my board
till the sun goes down</i>

145
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:45,467
<i>I jump into my woodie
and I make it back to town.</i>

146
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,476
<i>My secret surfing' spot
where only I know</i>

147
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,872
<i>- The gremmies and the hodads never go
- Never go</i>

148
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:52,937
<i>I said the gremmies
and the hodads never go</i>

149
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:54,072
Never go

150
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,180
<i>My secret surfing' spot
is the talk of the school</i>

151
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:01,120
The Samoan puberty
dance all over again.

152
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:03,953
<i>My secret surfing' spot
where only I know</i>

153
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:06,391
<i>- The gremmies and the hodads never go
- Never go</i>

154
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:08,520
<i>I said the gremmies
and the hodads never go</i>

155
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:12,737
<i>Yeah, I'm hotdogging on my board
till the sun goes down</i>

156
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:16,070
The mating dance of
the whooping crane.

157
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:19,199
<i>My secret surfing' spot
where only I know</i>

158
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:21,799
<i>- The gremmies and the hodads never go
- Never go</i>

159
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,741
<i>I said the gremmies

160
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:24,870
<i>Never go</i>

161
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:43,598
Absolutely impossible.

162
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:47,227
<i>I'm hotdogging on my board
till the sun goes down</i>

163
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:49,807
<i>I jump into my woodie
and I make it back to town</i>

164
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:52,237
<i>My secret surfing' spot
where only I know</i>

165
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:54,762
They're now concluding
their ceremony.

166
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:57,180
And they're collapsing
exhausted in the sand.

167
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:02,283
That was great.

168
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:09,822
By use of the directional
audio phonic microphone now,

169
00:16:09,924 --> 00:16:15,226
I shall attempt to pick up
some of their more secret yearnings.

170
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,907
Gee, girls are pretty.

171
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:39,920
- You just found that out, huh?
- Well, I mean when they move.

172
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:42,422
- Right, Frankie?
- Come on, knock it off, huh?

173
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,459
- What's bugging you, Frank?
- It's Dolores. She racked him up.

174
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,550
Deadhead, you've got the
biggest mouth in the world.

175
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:49,996
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

176
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:53,359
Well, he's right. It is Dolores.

177
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:55,129
Fellows, how would you like
to have plans for a girl

178
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:56,492
and end up with a surfboard?

179
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:57,971
If you're smart,
you'll dump her.

180
00:16:57,972 --> 00:16:59,166
- He's right.
- Yeah.

181
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:00,580
She's not gonna get away with it.

182
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:02,236
<i>I've been building for
this scene all year.</i>

183
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:05,479
<i>- Then you're gonna dump her?
- Well, I would in a flash.</i>

184
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,038
- Except for one little thing.
- What's that?

185
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:10,015
- I love her.
- Never say that!

186
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:11,779
Man, you want to ruin
it for the rest of us?

187
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,314
- We'll throw you out the union.
- What am I gonna do? I'm hooked.

188
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:17,191
Look, you're been building all
year for this scene, right?

189
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:20,320
- Okay, so you build someplace else, huh?
- Yeah, right.

190
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:23,127
- Yeah. Put her down.
- Right.

191
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:30,066
You know what happens
when a chick knows you dig her?

192
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:31,798
What?

193
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,454
- She walks all over you.
- Yeah!

194
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,202
Well, I'll show.
I'll dig somebody else.

195
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:42,353
- Another chick?
- If I were Dolores, I wouldn't like that.

196
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:47,882
That's the point, goo-goo. Put her down.
But who? Who can I...

197
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:48,883
<i>- Hey, is she still there?
- Who?</i>

198
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,621
<i>The one at
Big Daddy's, you know.</i>

199
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:54,862
- The cream puff.
- You mean, Ava.

200
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,529
- Yeah, Ava.
- Man, she's something else.

201
00:17:57,699 --> 00:17:59,257
She's got everything, huh?

202
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,164
Well, I'll tell you,
if she hasn't got it,

203
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:03,898
it's only because
she hasn't got room for it.

204
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:07,163
- Big Daddy's tonight.
- You're on!

205
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,211
And now,

206
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:48,948
a poem

207
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:54,272
by our beloved teacher...

208
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:56,618
Cappy Caplan!

209
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:08,800
A poem dedicated
to Big Daddy!

210
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,344
D is for Dallas.

211
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,274
I may not go there.

212
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:26,452
A is for, "Ah, ah, ah."

213
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:29,488
D is for Nicholas.

214
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,113
Long may he wave.

215
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:40,029
D is for D-Day or maybe Day D.

216
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,637
Y...

217
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:46,853
- Why not?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

218
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,512
Put them all together,
the spell Daddy!

219
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,557
He's been a mother to us all.

220
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:58,344
Yeah. Yeah!

221
00:19:58,419 --> 00:19:59,818
Dance, swing, live, kids.

222
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:03,585
Remember that tomorrow may be
the day after today.

223
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:08,294
Swing, live, dance.
I will walk among you.

224
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:17,564
<i>Well, I looked at the heavies

- Hey, man.

00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,773
- Yeah!
- Yeah, she's some chick, huh?

00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:36,075
Yeah!

260
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:43,901
- Is this what you wanted?
- It sure is.

261

- I'm sorry!
- Here. I'll help you with that.

262
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:59,054
Oh, would you?
I always spill things.

263

- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

265
00:23:09,444 --> 00:23:14,177
Say, listen, maybe when you take a break,
we could kind of dance a little, huh?

266
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:16,790
Oh yes.
I break very soon.

267
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:20,136
Well, here. Let me take you tray.
I'll take this for you here.

268
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:20,103
You done it again, boss.

269

You stupid.
You stupid.

270
00:24:24,018 --> 00:24:25,508
Fix it.

Just what we needed,
the black plague.

273
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,282
Out!

274
00:24:58,452 --> 00:24:59,851
Out!

275
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:08,688
Hold this.

276
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,761
Any moment I shall try for my
first contact. This is always difficult.

277
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,269
- Hey, Dad.
- I thought maybe you'd skip us this year.

278
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,836
I like you. And when Eric Von Zipper
likes somebody, they stay liked.

279
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:22,387
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- Yeah, and I like it here.

- He likes it here.

281
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:26,079
You see, I told you.
I like it here.

282
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,377
- I get the message.
- Yeah.

283
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:28,378
Look, just don't make
any trouble, huh?

284
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,516
Who me?

285
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:40,024
Aggressive. Definite aggression.

286
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,897
Something's about to...

287
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:18,912
Definite jungle reversion.
Well-executed, too.

288

by that look in your eye</i>

305
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:24,637
<i>You got a kind of pleasure
making' my temperature rise</i>

306
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:29,923
<i>Let me tell you now
That's all right with me.</i>

307
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,856
<i>Long as you never let
it drop a single degree</i>

308
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,979
<i>Keep a-saying' what you're saying'
Don't stop now</i>

309
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,607
<i>Don't stop now</i>

310
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:46,051
<i>Yeah, keep a-saying' what you're saying'
Don't stop now</i>

311
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:48,316
<i>Don't stop now</i>

312
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:51,158
<i>Whoa, each time
you twist your hips</i>

313
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,719
<i>Somethin' inside goes
a- flippety flip</i>

314
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:57,029
<i>What you're doing' is getting' to me
Don't stop now</i>

315
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:59,065
<i>Don't stop now</i>

316
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:04,394
<i>Don't stop now</i>

317
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,237
<i>Don't stop now</i>

318
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,681
<i>Don't stop now</i>

319
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:24,248
<i>Little girl, I can tell
by that look in your eye</i>

320
00:28:26,261 --> 00:28:30,163
<i>You get a kind of pleasure
making' my temperature rise</i>

321
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,760
<i>Let me tell you now
That's all right with me</i>

322
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:41,906
<i>Long as you never let it drop
a single degree</i>

323
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:45,210
<i>Keep a-saying' what you're saying'
Don't stop now</i>

324
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,440
<i>Don't stop now</i>

325
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,717
<i>Keep a-saying' what you're saying'
Don't stop now</i>

326
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:51,946
<i>Don't stop now</i>

327
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:54,919
<i>Whoa, every time
you twist your hips</i>

328
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,518
<i>Somethin' inside goes
a- flippety flip</i>

329
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,961
<i>What you're doing' is getting' to me
Don't stop now</i>

330
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:02,361
<i>Don't stop now</i>

331
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:06,522
<i>What you're doing' is getting' to me
Don't stop now</i>

332
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:08,229
<i>Don't stop now</i>

333
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:10,363
<i>Yeah, yeah, what you're doing'
is getting' to me</i>

334
00:29:10,364 --> 00:29:13,219
<i>Don't stop now
Don't stop now</i>

335
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,311
<i>What you're doing' is getting' to me
Don't stop now</i>

336
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:20,576
<i>Don't stop now
Don't stop now</i>

337
00:29:20,648 --> 00:29:23,139
<i>Don't stop now
Don't stop now!</i>

338
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:24,616
<i>Don't stop now</i>

339
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:37,829
- Hey.
- Oh. Oh, please, excuse me.

340
00:29:37,932 --> 00:29:40,298
What's the matter, baby?
You got a problem?

341
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:44,167
Yeah, that oversexed maniac
with that girl.

342
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:47,193
- Well, don't think about him no more.
- What?

343
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:51,384
- Eric Von Zipper likes you.
- Who's that?

344
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:53,312
Me!

345
00:29:58,252 --> 00:30:02,154
- Well, you've done it again, boss.
- You stupid.

346
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:03,919
I'd better go now.

347
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:09,262
Hey, baby. Girls fall for
Eric Von Zipper.

348
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:11,788
- I didn't fall. I tripped.
- Tripped, schmipped.

349
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:15,700
What's the difference?
You're here, and you look good to me.

350
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,694
Yeah, I'm here with friends.

351
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:21,673
Yeah, well, he found a new chick.

352
00:30:22,776 --> 00:30:26,769
- You'd better let me go.
- Hey! I like you.

353
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,999
And whatever Eric Von Zipper
wants, he gets.

354
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:33,854
No! No! Don't!

355
00:30:33,855 --> 00:30:36,016
Excuse me. Excuse me?

356
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:42,789
I'm R.O. Sutwell. I'm sorry to intrude,
but you're molesting this young lady.

357
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,562
What are you, her grandfather?

358
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:50,457
To be perfectly factual,
I've really never met her.

359
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:53,466
Now, if you'll be so kind
as to unwrap her.

360
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:58,577
Look, nobody tells
Eric Von Zipper nothing.

361
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:01,679
Yeah, that's right.
No one tells Eric Von Zipper nothing.

362
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:04,650
- Couldn't... Who are you?
- J.D.

363
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:07,120
That's short for
juvenile delinquent.

364
00:31:07,188 --> 00:31:08,951
One moment. Before you do
something you may regret,

365
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,324
I think it only fair to
caution you that I practice...

366
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:14,692
a most potent oriental
physic-psycho philosophy.

367
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,497
Yeah, and he looks
like one, too.

368
00:31:20,702 --> 00:31:22,837
Well, I'm gonna give you
something new to practice.

369
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:25,267
- Wait just a moment...
- Like pain.

370
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,993
Excuse me. Would you
hold this for just...

371
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:47,554
I'll have to send for another one of these.
Could you hold these parts for me?

372
00:31:50,397 --> 00:31:52,522
Hold these, too, please, will you?

373
00:31:52,523 --> 00:31:54,498
And watch the battery.
They're very hot. Be careful.

374
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,438
I don't think they
manufacture this model...

375
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:01,430
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, I'm gonna rip you for that.

376
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:03,865
The Himalayan time
suspensions technique.

377
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:10,139
I think it would be...

378
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:17,447
Hey, what'd you do to him?

379
00:32:17,448 --> 00:32:21,728
It's very simple. A complex
pressure point and applied force.

380
00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:26,428
You see? Now he's in the clutches
of what we call time suspension.

381
00:32:32,147 --> 00:32:33,147
Hey, boss?

382
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:36,675
You're fantastic.
Just wonderful!

383
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,142
Thank you very kindly.

384
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:41,610
May I escort you home?

385
00:32:41,682 --> 00:32:43,115
Thank you.

386
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:49,456
I appreciate so much your
holding those parts for me.

387
00:32:49,757 --> 00:32:51,452
Thank you. They're very
precious to me.

388
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:53,356
- Hey...
- The battery, yes.

389
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,520
But, listen.
What about him?

390
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:57,836
Oh, yes. Fortunately,
the force was light.

391
00:32:57,837 --> 00:33:01,137
He'll come around in a few hours.
Just keep him warm and comfortable.

392
00:33:01,702 --> 00:33:03,135
My dear.

393
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:05,771
Dolores.

394
00:33:05,939 --> 00:33:07,873
Where do you think you're going?

395
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:11,638
I'm being escorted home
by this nice, old gentleman.

396
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:14,977
- Okay!
- A-OK!

397
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:21,844
He done it with his finger.
One lousy finger. Zap!

398
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:24,856
And look at him.
He don't even move. No nothing.

399
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:28,951
- He said he slipped a clutch or something.
- And he's in time suspenders.

400
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:31,862
I don't care what he's wearing.
Get this stiff out of here. Out!

401
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:34,866
Hey, gently! Gently!
Don't break him.

402
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:53,685
Careful.

403
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:56,154
I just can't get over how
great you were.

404
00:33:56,223 --> 00:33:58,874
I mean, the way you saved me
from that storm trooper.

405
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:02,995
That was nothing, Dolores, nothing.
But thank you. Thank you just the same.

406
00:34:02,996 --> 00:34:05,988
Oh, say, you don't mind
my calling you Dolores, do you?

407
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:09,593
Oh, not at all, if I can call you...
What is your name?

408
00:34:09,703 --> 00:34:13,537
- Sutwell. Robert Orwell Sutwell.
- Orwell?

409
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:16,608
Yes, I'm sorry. That's always
been sort of a problem with me.

410
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,612
- I'll just call you Robert, okay?
- A-OK.

411
00:34:20,714 --> 00:34:23,581
Dolores, I've got to
confess something to you.

412
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:26,676
You've suddenly
become very important to me.

413
00:34:26,754 --> 00:34:29,951
And I'm interested
in finding out more about you.

414
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:33,506
- Oh?
- You see, I'm an explorer.

415
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:38,467
I explore.
You understand?

416
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:41,897
Yes, I understand.

417
00:34:42,202 --> 00:34:44,102
You're my first contact.

418
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,739
Really? At your age?

419
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:55,715
Yes, and to a man of my age,
first contacts are terribly important.

420
00:34:55,716 --> 00:34:58,276
I know. Contact's the
most important thing...

421
00:34:58,277 --> 00:34:59,277
in the whole world.

422
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:02,778
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.

423
00:35:02,779 --> 00:35:04,274
- You wouldn't?
- No.

424
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:10,491
You're so right. I guess old men
always seem to know so much more.

425
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:14,657
I don't know. We old codgers
make mistakes, too, you know.

426
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,659
- Not very often, I'll bet.
- Well...

427
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:20,270
You're so distinguished.

428
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,604
- And you study people.
- Yes, that I do.

429
00:35:22,676 --> 00:35:25,338
Are you a doctor,
like Dr. Shootser?

430
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:29,282
- Well, when I... Dr. Shootser?
- Yes.

431
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:31,911
Wait a minute.
Don't you mean Dr. Schweitzer?

432
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:33,204
Is that his name?

433
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:35,516
Yes. I think he's still
using it. You see...

434
00:35:35,622 --> 00:35:38,284
- And you're so exciting.
- You think so?

435
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:40,618
- You're not at all like...
- Like Frankie?

436
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,695
You'd like Frankie
to think of you...

437
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:44,755
as something more than a mere girl?
Wouldn't you?

438
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:45,322
That's right.

439
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:48,099
You'd like him to
consider you as a wife.

440
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:51,630
- That's exactly what I said to Rhonda.
- I know.

441
00:35:52,168 --> 00:35:55,004
I mean, I knew that that's
the way you'd feel about it

442
00:35:55,624 --> 00:35:59,448
Dolores, now that we've met
and sort gotten together...

443
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,843
Well, I guess you could say
that we've made contact.

444
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:07,720
It's funny that with all you experience
that I'd be your first contact.

445
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:09,154
Yes...

446
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,576
- May I say something to you?
- Oh, yes, please do.

447
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:15,988
You may be my first contact, too.

448
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:19,398
Dolores, dear, could we just go
past contact for a moment?

449
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:23,358
It isn't contact I want so much
as your help.

450
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,114
- Me help you?
- Yes, with my research.

451
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:28,308
You see, I want to find
out all about you.

452
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:31,176
How you live, where you live,
your friends, what you like to do.

453
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,236
Anything you want, Robert.

454
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:36,645
Now, now, somehow I don't seem to...

455
00:36:37,718 --> 00:36:41,708
You know, I think it, would be better
if we talk this over at my place.

456
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:49,352
- All right.
- You mean you will?

457
00:36:50,764 --> 00:36:52,391
Yes.

458
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:55,364
Tomorrow then.

459
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,162
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, say about noon?

460
00:37:00,707 --> 00:37:05,576
Oh, Robert, you even know
when a girl shouldn't be rushed.

461
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:08,874
Dolores...

462
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,213
Now, steady, old man.
You have the age but not the experience.

463
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:23,055
"You even know when a
girl shouldn't be rushed.".

464
00:37:41,582 --> 00:37:43,072
Who said old?

465
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:51,937
- Gee, what do you think of that?
- I think he ought to grow a beard.

466
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,660
- Deadhead, you've got a flabby mouth.
- Yeah?

467
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:55,821
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

468
00:37:56,597 --> 00:38:00,397
I didn't say nothing.
Boy, this has been some night.

469
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:02,298
You can say that again.

470
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,666
Boy, this has been some night.

471
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:17,616
Professor!

472
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:24,851
Oh, yes! Oh, yes, Marianne!

473
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:26,299
I'll be there in
just a moment.

474
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:29,353
Just a second.

475
00:38:29,463 --> 00:38:31,021
Hurry!

476
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:32,598
Oh, yes.

477
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:37,033
I'm sorry.

478
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:40,004
There's your old Fitzhampton
and Murchison and...

479
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:41,597
- Thank you.
- ...Jacobson.

480
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:44,701
Thank you.
My, you've done this swiftly, Marianne.

481
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:50,679
Marianne, would you believe
that last night I made contact?

482
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:53,052
From the looks of your eyes,
I would believe it.

483
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:56,122
Imagine. Contact in just two days.

484
00:38:57,557 --> 00:39:01,493
Marianne, incidentally,
I want to ask you something.

485
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:03,961
Would you say that
I'm an old man?

486
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:07,626
- Older than what?
- Well, older than young.

487
00:39:07,701 --> 00:39:10,067
Do you know what
you're talking about?

488
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:14,800
- You know you're a very pretty woman.
- You're not bad yourself.

489
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:16,342
Thank you.

490
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:19,110
In a bearded,
academic sort of way.

491
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:20,784
Yeah, that's what I thought.

492
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:23,573
You know, all those
young people out there,

493
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,210
with their squirming tribal dances...

494
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:29,185
Strange. All the years
I spent in the jungle,

495
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:31,110
I never took time out
to learn to squirm.

496
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,938
You think maybe
you missed something?

497
00:39:34,895 --> 00:39:36,886
Maybe not all of it.

498
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:41,114
But mostly with me,
it's been a spectator sport.

499
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:44,170
I've never really played
on one of the teams.

500
00:39:44,671 --> 00:39:47,606
Don't you think it's time
that you got off the bench

501
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:49,608
and into the game?

502
00:39:49,843 --> 00:39:50,867
<i>Robert?</i>

503
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:53,345
Ah, hi, Rob...

504
00:39:54,347 --> 00:39:58,113
There's one of your teammates
here for batting practice.

505
00:39:58,218 --> 00:39:59,776
Oh, yes, hello.

506
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:02,754
Good morning, Dolores.

507
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:07,195
You asked me to come by tomorrow,
so there I am today just like you wanted.

508
00:40:07,627 --> 00:40:10,357
Oh, yes. Dolores, I think it might be well

509
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:12,542
if I got dressed for the beach
and met you down there.

510
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:15,300
All righty. Don't be long.

511
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:17,967
All righty.

512
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:20,525
No wonder you feel old.

513
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:24,234
Marianne, that's my first contact.
It's pure research. It's business!

514
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:27,075
- Lolita business.
- I'm not the...

515
00:40:56,543 --> 00:40:58,238
Ava, I love you!

516
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,730
Thank you, darling.

517
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:13,817
Hey, Ava.

518
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:17,049
- Hi, I look for Frankie.
- He's coming in off the curl.

519
00:41:22,786 --> 00:41:25,431
- You coming surfing tonight?
- If he takes me.

520
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:28,037
Well, if he doesn't take you, I will.

521
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:29,199
Frankie.

522
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,270
- Oh, hello, Ava.
- Hi, darling.

523
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:38,684
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?

524
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:42,712
Yeah, sure, I like you, honey,
but alone, not in front of so many people.

525
00:41:43,824 --> 00:41:45,815
Now, you're going to
take me surfing tonight?

526
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:46,816
Well, I...

527
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:51,728
I just might.

528
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:53,732
Come here, baby.

529
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:05,396
- Tell me you love me.
- Yeah, yeah, I love you.

530
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:11,613
Where are you going?
What you think you're doing?

531
00:42:22,747 --> 00:42:24,951
- Robert.
- Oh, yes, right here.

532
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:31,428
Good afternoon or good morning.
No, it's afternoon.

533
00:42:34,423 --> 00:42:37,382
- Something wrong?
- Oh, no, there's nothing...

534
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:40,137
Where did you get
those banana boats?

535
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:43,196
Oh, yes. I'm very proud of these.
I brought them back from Africa.

536
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,175
How'd you get them
away from the witch doctor?

537
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:49,086
No, no. They weren't his.
They belonged to the Chief.

538
00:42:49,189 --> 00:42:53,053
- Robert, they've got to go.
- Do you think so?

539
00:42:53,054 --> 00:42:55,052
Well, all right.
They're very comfortable.

540
00:42:56,964 --> 00:42:59,974
- What is this?
- Oh, yes. I'm very proud of this too.

541
00:42:59,975 --> 00:43:01,496
This was present to
me by another chief,

542
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:03,381
the Chief of the
Tokyo Fire Department.

543
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:07,632
The firemen wear them to fires.
It's fireproof, also waterproof.

544
00:43:07,695 --> 00:43:09,717
It's sort of a conversation piece.

545
00:43:10,543 --> 00:43:13,637
No one around here converses
in the Japanese firehouse talk,

546
00:43:13,747 --> 00:43:15,237
so take it off.

547
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:16,949
All right.

548
00:43:21,488 --> 00:43:22,849
A bathing suit?

549
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,272
Yes, I've had it
for quite a while.

550
00:43:25,273 --> 00:43:27,804
It was presented to me
by the Hong Kong YMCA.

551
00:43:28,228 --> 00:43:32,289
- With a skirt?
- Yes, that's part of it.

552
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:34,499
I'm afraid that's going
to have to go, too.

553
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:37,126
No, no, no, I'm afraid this
will have to stay. This is it.

554
00:43:37,162 --> 00:43:39,772
- Well, maybe you could...
- Maybe I could, but I'm not going to.

555
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:42,765
I'm just fine as I am.
Thank you very much.

556
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:46,276
Well, in that case, here.
Put this back on.

557
00:43:46,346 --> 00:43:47,779
Very well.

558
00:43:50,483 --> 00:43:53,111
My... I'm terribly sorry.

559
00:43:53,112 --> 00:43:56,629
Oh, no. Actually, I think
you're kind of cute.

560
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,559
Sort of a walking United Nations.

561
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,121
Thank you very much.

562
00:44:01,122 --> 00:44:03,829
You know Dolores,
I don't get to the beach very often,

563
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:04,830
so I really wasn't prepared.

564
00:44:05,932 --> 00:44:07,923
What does she see
in old beaver puss anyway?

565
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:11,937
I don't know. If he had a twin,
he'd make a good cough drop.

566
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:15,940
- You get what you pay for.
- Deal!

567
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,963
Hey, pops!
Where'd you get that crazy kimono?

568
00:44:23,717 --> 00:44:28,950
It just so happens it was presented to him
by the Chief of the Tokyo Fire Department.

569
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:33,682
Wonderful! If my rickshaw ever
catches fire, I'll know who to call!

570
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:36,662
Come on.

571
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,700
- Isn't it a hooting day?
- Yes, is it...

572
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,508
A hooting day?

573
00:44:49,576 --> 00:44:53,876
- The sets are so glassy.
- The sets are glassy?

574
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:58,006
- The waves! They're just like glass.
- Oh, I see.

575
00:44:58,186 --> 00:44:59,930
Tell me something?
Hooting?

576
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:04,541
Now, as I see it, it means a sort of
a cry of pleasure from the word "to hoot"?

577
00:45:06,726 --> 00:45:11,060
Oh, yeah, Robert,
You´re so intelligent.

578
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:13,896
Hey, come on.
Let's skeg him.

579
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:17,393
I think you're just perfect.

580
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:19,566
Hooting, hooting.

581
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:25,841
- What about Dolores? She likes him.
- She's Frankie's girl. Come on.

582
00:45:26,046 --> 00:45:29,880
- And stoked? Now, stoked means happy?
- Right.

583
00:45:30,016 --> 00:45:33,076
Hi, Dolores, we thought
maybe we'd like to meet your friend.

584
00:45:33,111 --> 00:45:34,785
- Not now, Ken.
- Stoked to meet you.

585
00:45:35,555 --> 00:45:37,059
- You talk like a real kook.
- Thank you. You're very kind.

586
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,792
Robert, I think we'd better
go to the house.

587
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:40,664
How are you on the board, beard?

588
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:43,163
I can do a swan dive
and a fairly goof jackknife.

589
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,421
- No, no, no. The surfboard.
- Oh, that, no. I've never done that.

590
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:49,490
Must be fascinating. I'd like to learn.
It seems fairly simple.

591
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:51,885
Oh, it is, it is.
How about right now, huh?

592
00:45:52,872 --> 00:45:55,466
- Hooting! Hooting!
- Oh, no, Robert, no!

593
00:45:55,575 --> 00:45:57,907
We'll just try it right here first.

594
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:01,370
Right there. Just lay right down there.
That's the first step.

595
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:02,881
I see.

596
00:46:04,008 --> 00:46:08,432
That's it. Right on your face,
and paddle like this.

597
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,433
What, like this?

598
00:46:10,657 --> 00:46:12,488
- You see that wave out there?
- Oh, yes.

599
00:46:12,592 --> 00:46:14,429
Okay, now, you sneak into it.

600
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,477
The first thing you know,
you're up on your knees.

601
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:20,729
- Like this?
- That's it, that's it.

602
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,024
Now you're to shoot that wave...
You're building to it.

603
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:25,043
- Shoot it?
- Yeah, catch it.

604
00:46:25,044 --> 00:46:26,986
- Oh, catch.
- Right. And you stand up.

605
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:30,338
- Nothing to it.
- That's great!

606
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:32,988
- He's a real hotdogger.
- Say, do you...

607
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,138
Hotdogger?

608
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:38,209
- A good surfer.
- Oh, really? Thank you.

609
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,820
- You ride it right in.
- Yes, ride it right in.

610
00:46:41,121 --> 00:46:43,085
- What do you say we give it a try?
- You know he doesn't know how.

611
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:44,523
- Now, now, please.
- Robert.

612
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:47,925
It's very, very simple, Dolores.
All right, I'll go right...

613
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:50,622
Don't you think you'd better
take off some of your equipment?

614
00:46:50,697 --> 00:46:52,365
Oh, yes. Thank you very much.

615
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:55,631
My Perkins reminder watch.
Would you hold this please, Dolores?

616
00:46:56,169 --> 00:46:58,967
Oh, and my glasses.
There we are.

617
00:46:59,205 --> 00:47:01,173
I guess I better take this off, too.

618
00:47:01,174 --> 00:47:04,143
Oh, boy, they just don't make
those bathing suits like they used so.

619
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:08,046
No, no, I'm very attached to this one.
I wore it when I swam the Hellespont.

620
00:47:08,148 --> 00:47:10,444
I like it. I think it's
substantial looking.

621
00:47:10,445 --> 00:47:12,509
Thank you, my dear.
All right.

622
00:47:13,186 --> 00:47:16,781
Say, beard, you're gonna need this...

623
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:21,216
when you jazz the glass.

624
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:23,495
Jazz the glass?
Oh, that's very good.

625
00:47:23,696 --> 00:47:27,393
- You got that?
- Yes, I've got it. Thank you.

626
00:47:27,634 --> 00:47:28,726
Robert, don't!

627
00:47:28,761 --> 00:47:31,087
Now, now, now, please. I told you,
I think is very simple, Dolores.

628
00:47:32,238 --> 00:47:33,500
Wait a moment.
Wait a moment.

629
00:47:33,573 --> 00:47:37,634
I'd like to do a few calculations
if you don't mind.

630
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:42,950
Let see me. The standard
sea level pressure is 29.92.

631
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:48,153
Ought to be 30 inches to the...
Oh, what is the weight of the board?

632
00:47:48,154 --> 00:47:49,587
Twenty-six pounds.

633
00:47:49,689 --> 00:47:51,384
Twenty-six. Thank you very much.
Twenty-six...

634
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,882
That's 2.6, averaged over X,
times the natural buoyancy.

635
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:02,167
Now, all submerged, it's 43.
Let's see here. Saltwater.

636
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:07,071
Saltwater is 7.2 over 0.4.

637
00:48:07,607 --> 00:48:08,699
Yes.

638
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:11,986
There we are.
I'm ready.

639
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:07,252
Oh, no wonder.
I forgot to carry the two.

640
00:50:01,054 --> 00:50:02,146
Excuse me.

641
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,884
- Excuse me.
- Go away. We're closed.

642
00:50:08,895 --> 00:50:11,386
- Zen?
- No, I'm asleep.

643
00:50:11,387 --> 00:50:14,206
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

644
00:50:20,108 --> 00:50:23,675
Wait a minute. Hey, I know you.
You're the guy who put the finger...

645
00:50:23,676 --> 00:50:24,700
on Von Zipper.

646
00:50:24,701 --> 00:50:25,701
I've been trying to
figure you out for a long time.

647
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,012
Come on. Squat. Sit down.

648
00:50:31,184 --> 00:50:32,712
What's your racket?

649
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:36,401
- My name is Sutwell. R. O. Sutwell.
- R. O.

650
00:50:37,357 --> 00:50:39,325
And I'm here to ask questions.

651
00:50:39,392 --> 00:50:41,087
- You're a cop?
- No.

652
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:42,718
Don't worry about them.
They're asleep.

653
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:45,229
No, you see,
I'm a developmental biologist,

654
00:50:45,331 --> 00:50:47,697
social anthropologist
and an explorer.

655
00:50:48,101 --> 00:50:49,932
- You're joshing.
- No, I'm doing research...

656
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:51,871
on post-adolescent surf dwellers.
I'm writing a book.

657
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:55,515
- It's called "The Sutwell Report.
- How about that?

658
00:50:55,516 --> 00:50:58,557
I'm studying rather
primitive behavior patterns.

659
00:50:59,846 --> 00:51:01,404
You came to the right cat.

660
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:02,715
If there's anything you want to
know about these kids

661
00:51:02,816 --> 00:51:04,784
I can tell you the whole thing
in two words.

662
00:51:05,251 --> 00:51:07,078
- They're nuts.
- They're nuts?

663
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,633
You see?
You noticed it, too.

664
00:51:09,255 --> 00:51:11,280
What do you think they do all day?
Run all around the beach.

665
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:13,159
And they only got one
thing on their mind.

666
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:13,992
Each other.

667
00:51:14,761 --> 00:51:16,729
That's sort of usual, isn't it?
That starts in...

668
00:51:16,796 --> 00:51:19,560
I know, but they got so much energy.
They don't know what to do with it.

669
00:51:19,632 --> 00:51:22,066
- They need a reason, a cause.
- A cause?

670
00:51:22,135 --> 00:51:24,467
Yeah, that's why I hired him.

671
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:28,507
Big Daddy. He'll give them the reason.
He'll give them the cause.

672
00:51:28,908 --> 00:51:31,536
- What cause? He's asleep.
- So he'll give them a sleepy cause.

673
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:32,873
What's the difference?

674
00:51:32,874 --> 00:51:36,195
He's a real weirdo. I found him
on the beach one day walking around.

675
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:38,760
He had a couple of pigeons
or seagulls on his shoulders.

676
00:51:39,252 --> 00:51:42,115
All these kids were gathered around him,
waiting to hear the word.

677
00:51:42,116 --> 00:51:44,512
- What word?
- We don't know yet.

678
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:47,240
You know, you're a
very remarkable fellow.

679
00:51:47,326 --> 00:51:50,227
- I think so. I like you, too, Professor.
- Thank you.

680
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:52,560
- Hey, one thing. Will you level with me?
- All right.

681
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:55,760
What's with the duster?
You think it moves the chicks?

682
00:51:55,902 --> 00:51:59,099
No, as a matter of fact,
it usually works the other way.

683
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:02,900
I don't dig.
You don't want to level with me, right?

684
00:52:03,176 --> 00:52:05,105
Yeah, all right, I'll level with you.

685
00:52:05,106 --> 00:52:06,845
I was the youngest professor
at the university.

686
00:52:07,346 --> 00:52:09,906
In fact, I was so young it was sickening.

687
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:12,816
Every time I opened my mouth,
my students laughed.

688
00:52:12,919 --> 00:52:15,581
The other professors laughed.
Even the janitors laughed.

689
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:18,591
Well. I knew it couldn't go on
for long, so one date at lunch,

690
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,630
I presented my problem to
an old professor friend of mine.

691
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:25,363
And without even glancing
up from his soup, he said,

692
00:52:25,364 --> 00:52:27,696
"Buy yourself a pair of glasses
and grow a beard. "

693
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,134
So, you see, all of this is just 18 years
of professor window dressing.

694
00:52:32,438 --> 00:52:36,169
Amazing how our lives parallel.
I mean, you got the... And...

695
00:52:36,275 --> 00:52:39,335
- You know how I happened to raise this?
- No. Why?

696
00:52:39,336 --> 00:52:42,670
I got a dimple in my chin, and I didn't want
anybody mistaking me for Kirk Douglas.

697
00:52:44,283 --> 00:52:46,114
But you don't look
anything like Kirk Douglas.

698
00:52:46,185 --> 00:52:47,516
Yeah, you see?

699
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:52,122
Cappy, any help you can give me
with my research

700
00:52:52,191 --> 00:52:54,182
will be deeply appreciated.

701
00:52:54,293 --> 00:52:56,766
Well, you're going to need more help
than with your research.

702
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:58,801
Somehow I don't dig.

703
00:52:59,311 --> 00:53:01,867
It's that Eric Von Zipper.
He's looking for you.

704
00:53:02,368 --> 00:53:04,336
He's mad, real mad.

705
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:08,406
Whoops, there she goes.
I better go over and wake those girls up

706
00:53:08,508 --> 00:53:09,907
before they freeze like that.

707
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:12,910
It once took me three weeks
to unwind one of them.

708
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:15,203
There goes the other one.

709
00:53:15,314 --> 00:53:19,250
All right, come on, girls.
Up, up, everybody up.

710
00:53:19,352 --> 00:53:20,717
Well, I guess I'll just have to
turn them over.

711
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,914
They sleep better on their head.
Come on, come on, up.

712
00:53:24,857 --> 00:53:25,915
Thank you, Cappy.

713
00:53:26,025 --> 00:53:27,356
I want to talk to you about Dolores.

714
00:53:27,426 --> 00:53:29,189
- I'm Frankie.
- Oh, yes.

715
00:53:29,262 --> 00:53:30,759
- I know who you are.
- You do?

716
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,265
You're the guy who's been
cutting in on my time.

717
00:53:33,266 --> 00:53:34,426
Now, please. Just a moment...

718
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,991
You're brainwashing her with your beard.

719
00:53:36,992 --> 00:53:38,920
Brainwashing her with my beard?

720
00:53:39,405 --> 00:53:42,299
Why else would she be crazy
about someone like you?

721
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,330
- Now, that I resent...
- I mean, you're an old man.

722
00:53:45,778 --> 00:53:48,372
Now, just a moment.
If you're so wild about Dolores,

723
00:53:48,447 --> 00:53:51,307
why are you running around
with this Hungarian goulash?

724
00:53:51,308 --> 00:53:52,308
Because she's my girl!

725
00:53:52,885 --> 00:53:54,989
- Who, goulash?
- No, Dolores.

726
00:53:55,521 --> 00:53:59,753
Oh, I see. Yes.
Make her jealous. Put her down.

727
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:01,417
Typical aborigine attitude.

728
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:04,587
I suppose you'd like to drag her off
on your surfboard by the roots of her hair?

729
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:07,188
Yes, I would.
I love her.

730
00:54:07,266 --> 00:54:10,174
Look, I know how you can love her, too,
because she's lovable.

731
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,287
But I'm telling you this. I'm not going to
let any overage, fuzzy face

732
00:54:14,288 --> 00:54:17,642
take away my girl,
not if I have anything to do with it.

733
00:54:17,643 --> 00:54:20,271
And believe me, mister, I do!

734
00:54:22,662 --> 00:54:25,291
By the way,
how you fixed for blades?

735
00:54:29,244 --> 00:54:32,991
Boy, that kid's really got a chip on
his shoulders. I think it's his head.

736
00:54:33,492 --> 00:54:35,460
- Can I ask you something, Professor?
- Yes.

737
00:54:35,561 --> 00:54:39,463
You studying these kids' sex life,
or are you getting involved in it?

738
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:41,232
See you.

739
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:46,404
Involved.

740
00:55:13,065 --> 00:55:15,925
- Hi, Sue. Have you seen Dolores?
- Dolores who?

741
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:19,037
Dolores Del Rio. Now, come on!
Where is she?

742
00:55:19,038 --> 00:55:20,232
Help yourself.

743
00:55:34,282 --> 00:55:35,282
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah, me.

744
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,773
Well, there's nothing we have
to say to each other.

745
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:38,928
Yes, there is. Plenty.

746
00:55:38,929 --> 00:55:41,393
Now, look, this time
has gone on long enough.

747
00:55:41,394 --> 00:55:43,862
I don't know what
you're talking about.

748
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:45,922
Oh, come off it! You and old pig bristles...

749
00:55:45,998 --> 00:55:49,331
It just so happens I love him,
pig bristles and all.

750
00:55:49,435 --> 00:55:51,335
Have you gone right
out of your mind?

751
00:55:51,437 --> 00:55:53,435
Maybe, but I'm not crazy enough
to stick with you.

752
00:55:53,436 --> 00:55:55,262
- Not even if I loved you?
- Not even if...

753
00:55:57,009 --> 00:55:58,704
What did you say?

754
00:55:59,612 --> 00:56:01,307
Not even if I loved you?

755
00:56:01,954 --> 00:56:05,650
- Do you, Frankie?
- You know I do.

756
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:07,710
But you never said it like that.

757
00:56:10,356 --> 00:56:11,789
Oh, honey.

758
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:22,497
What is going on which
I am included out?

759
00:56:23,402 --> 00:56:24,460
Ava.

760
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:30,706
- There's something I have to tell you.
- Tell me outside in the dark.

761
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:34,389
- No, Ava, you've the wrong idea.
- Frankie, you promised.

762
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,182
- "Frankie, you promised."
- Dolores, I was just...

763
00:56:37,483 --> 00:56:39,383
- I'm waiting.
- She's "waiting."

764
00:56:39,485 --> 00:56:43,512
- But, look... What I'm trying to say is...
- I want to hear you say it again.

765
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:46,353
- Say what, Ava?
- How he loves me.

766
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:48,484
Did I say that?

767
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:51,689
Dee Dee, I was only trying to...

768
00:56:55,034 --> 00:56:56,592
Where'd I go wrong?

769
00:56:56,702 --> 00:57:00,866
Ava will kiss and make
it feel better.

770
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,068
You bet she will.
Come on. Let's go.

771
00:57:17,924 --> 00:57:19,789
Where did I go wrong?

772
00:57:20,326 --> 00:57:22,055
Treat him nicely.

773
00:57:23,696 --> 00:57:25,186
That's right!

774
00:57:25,397 --> 00:57:27,092
Well, maybe.

775
00:57:32,238 --> 00:57:36,607
<i>Treat him nicely</i>

776
00:57:36,608 --> 00:57:39,608
<i>That's what you should do</i>

777
00:57:41,848 --> 00:57:46,979
<i>I was such a fool
to treat him so cruel</i>

778
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:51,321
<i>He found someone new</i>

779
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:57,191
<i>Treat him gently</i>

780
00:57:57,296 --> 00:58:01,494
<i>And to him be true</i>

781
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:06,957
<i>I was so unwise
Told him little lies</i>

782
00:58:07,807 --> 00:58:11,299
<i>I lost him to you</i>

783
00:58:12,812 --> 00:58:16,179
<i>So I ask you to</i>

784
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,688
<i>always take care of him</i>

785
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:27,656
<i>Maybe it's because I know</i>

786
00:58:27,727 --> 00:58:32,687
<i>I still love him</i>

787
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,860
<i>Treat him nicely</i>

788
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:43,704
<i>With his love be kind</i>

789
00:58:43,705 --> 00:58:47,998
<i>Had a listened to
advice I'm giving you</i>

790
00:58:49,148 --> 00:58:53,346
<i>He might still be mine</i>

791
00:59:04,897 --> 00:59:10,199
<i>Had a listened to
advice I'm giving you</i>

792
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,864
<i>He might still be mine</i>

793
00:59:15,508 --> 00:59:21,037
<i>Had I listened to
advice I'm giving you</i>

794
00:59:21,113 --> 00:59:27,052
<i>He might still be mine</i>

795
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,758
Professor?

796
00:59:35,695 --> 00:59:36,787
Professor?

797
00:59:37,062 --> 00:59:40,088
Yes, Marianne, I'm dressing.
I'll be right there.

798
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:40,956
Don't bother.

799
00:59:40,957 --> 00:59:43,691
I'm just lugging in the
rest of your library.

800
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:47,432
Oh, I see.
Still upset with me?

801
00:59:47,539 --> 00:59:50,201
Upset?
Why should I be upset?

802
00:59:50,276 --> 00:59:52,574
Oh, I don't know.
I got that impression.

803
00:59:52,678 --> 00:59:55,442
By the way,
how did the game go last night?

804
00:59:55,547 --> 00:59:59,677
- Any home runs?
- No, but it wasn't exactly a shutout.

805
01:00:00,185 --> 01:00:02,619
I went shopping today.

806
01:00:12,131 --> 01:00:15,294
How do I look?

807
01:00:15,295 --> 01:00:17,856
- Like a South Sea island village.
- Oh, thanks.

808
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:23,065
- Waiting for the volcano to erupt.
- Yes, that's a dramatic image.

809
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:28,112
- It sort of blends with your beard.
- Tell me, what is this with my beard?

810
01:00:28,113 --> 01:00:30,138
I've heard more about my beard
in the last two days...

811
01:00:30,249 --> 01:00:31,807
than in all the years since I grew it.

812
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:36,415
Maybe this tribe is more hip
than the Hari I knew of Japan.

813
01:00:36,555 --> 01:00:39,149
I swear... Oh, hey, speaking of tribes,

814
01:00:39,258 --> 01:00:41,453
I'm gonna mingle tonight
and get the inner workings of this tribe.

815
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,551
Now, I want you to follow me
with the directional here

816
01:00:43,629 --> 01:00:45,153
and get it all down on tape.

817
01:00:45,264 --> 01:00:48,791
- I'll get all the good stuff.
- You know, I'm really enjoying this.

818
01:00:48,901 --> 01:00:50,801
Scratch you later, chick.

819
01:00:50,903 --> 01:00:53,235
"Dig" you later.

820
01:00:53,305 --> 01:00:55,330
Dig. Oh, yes, yes.

821
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:56,903
Yes, I must work on that.

822
01:00:58,811 --> 01:01:02,440
<i>Well, I looked at the heavies
They were rolling' in fast</i>

823
01:01:02,514 --> 01:01:05,312
<i>I knew I'd better make it
'cause they just don't last</i>

824
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:07,476
<i>I'm surfing'</i>

825
01:01:07,586 --> 01:01:10,612
<i>Yeah, swinging' and surfing'</i>

826
01:01:13,492 --> 01:01:14,857
Hello.

827
01:01:15,127 --> 01:01:17,527
Robert, I thought you'd
never get here.

828
01:01:17,629 --> 01:01:20,189
Well, if it isn't King Kamehameha.

829
01:01:21,492 --> 01:01:22,492
Hooting, hooting.

830
01:01:24,274 --> 01:01:26,715
Who gave you the hat?
Lily Dache?

831
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:29,437
No, no, no. I bought this
especially for tonight.

832
01:01:29,472 --> 01:01:32,072
Yeah. I want to be one of the gang.
It's part of my research.

833
01:01:33,082 --> 01:01:37,016
- Robert, I love being your guinea pig.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

834
01:01:39,085 --> 01:01:41,553
Old pig bristles.

835
01:01:41,954 --> 01:01:44,184
Don't you worry about him.

836
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,684
No.

837
01:01:52,898 --> 01:01:55,526
Put your arms around me.

838
01:01:55,527 --> 01:01:57,719
- What's the matter? You cold?
- Yes.

839
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,238
Well, say maybe I could
put some more wood on the fire.

840
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:01,706
- You would.
- What?

841
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:03,707
More wood on the fire.

842
01:02:07,046 --> 01:02:09,105
That's strange,
I'm not the least bit cold.

843
01:02:09,515 --> 01:02:12,575
As a matter of fact,
it seems very toasty here to me.

844
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,344
- Robert!
- What's the matter?

845
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:18,189
- Your hat?
- What's the matter with it?

846
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:20,090
- It's on fire!
- What?

847
01:02:26,085 --> 01:02:28,375
Here, pops!
You may catch cold.

848
01:02:39,778 --> 01:02:43,441
<i>- We're all here
- Yeah, we're here</i>

849
01:02:43,549 --> 01:02:47,246
<i>The time has come
The tide is out</i>

850
01:02:47,352 --> 01:02:49,013
<i>Yeah</i>

851
01:02:49,088 --> 01:02:53,081
<i>- So what do we do?
- We keep warm</i>

852
01:02:53,192 --> 01:02:56,591
<i>- How do we do that, brothers?
- We hold tight</i>

853
01:02:56,592 --> 01:02:59,562
<i>- What do we hold sinners?
- Girls!</i>

854
01:02:59,731 --> 01:03:01,790
<i>Yeah!</i>

855
01:03:14,379 --> 01:03:16,438
Where have they all gone?

856
01:03:16,982 --> 01:03:20,042
If you don't know that,
you must've flunked biology.

857
01:03:23,288 --> 01:03:25,051
Come on. Let's go.

858
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:28,310
This is nice,
isn't it?

859
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:32,397
Robert, you know I
like you very much.

860
01:03:32,965 --> 01:03:35,297
- I like you, too.
- Thank you.

861
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,300
But I just can't stand by...

862
01:03:37,402 --> 01:03:40,235
and listen to what they're saying
about you behind your back.

863
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:41,602
What are they saying?

864
01:03:41,603 --> 01:03:45,092
They're calling you awful things
like "Hair Mattress",

865
01:03:45,177 --> 01:03:48,510
"Old Billy Goat," "Pig Bristles"
and "The Finger."

866
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:51,639
"The Finger"?

867
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,596
Robert, the whole thing,
it's got to go.

868
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,413
It won't take long,
and you'll hardly feel it.

869
01:03:57,489 --> 01:04:00,458
- Look, I've brought Deadhead's razor.
- Dolores...

870
01:04:00,459 --> 01:04:02,383
You're not suggesting
I cut my throat?

871
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:05,591
No, silly! This.

872
01:04:06,665 --> 01:04:08,633
Oh, that.

873
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,031
Oh, yes, yes.

874
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:12,292
No, no, Dolores,
I really shouldn't.

875
01:04:12,293 --> 01:04:16,007
- No, I might not look too good under here.
- I'm willing to take the chance.

876
01:04:16,008 --> 01:04:18,875
- Well, I'm not.
- Robert, be courageous like me.

877
01:04:18,876 --> 01:04:20,182
No, you don't understand.
We're old friends.

878
01:04:20,183 --> 01:04:22,074
We've been together for years.

879
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:25,212
And you can't just mow down
an old friend like that.

880
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:27,476
- It isn't...
- It's a shame, Robert.

881
01:04:27,477 --> 01:04:29,550
- What?
- You have...

882
01:04:31,237 --> 01:04:34,955
such young eyes and
such an old chin.

883
01:04:35,828 --> 01:04:37,227
Young eyes?

884
01:04:39,065 --> 01:04:42,159
I'll come back after
you two have parted.

885
01:04:43,495 --> 01:04:44,495
Dolores...

886
01:04:45,337 --> 01:04:48,568
Dolores, wait a minute,
I really...

887
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:14,996
<i>The moon</i>

888
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,994
<i>Promise me the moon</i>

889
01:05:19,772 --> 01:05:26,234
<i>And every little star
that shines above</i>

890
01:05:26,345 --> 01:05:28,176
<i>The world</i>

891
01:05:29,048 --> 01:05:31,516
<i>Promise me the world</i>

892
01:05:33,285 --> 01:05:37,881
<i>And every dream
I'm dreaming' of</i>

893
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:40,916
<i>The moon</i>

894
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:42,657
<i>What would the moonbeam</i>

895
01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:44,286
<i>I don't want the moon</i>

896
01:05:44,287 --> 01:05:45,287
<i>A moonbeam,
a moonbeam</i>

897
01:05:46,547 --> 01:05:49,398
Deadhead, how can you be hungry
at a time like this?

898
01:05:50,035 --> 01:05:52,333
Man can't live by love alone.

899
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:56,073
<i>The world</i>

900
01:05:56,475 --> 01:05:58,067
<i>I don't want the world</i>

901
01:05:58,143 --> 01:06:00,236
<i>To own a real dream</i>

902
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:02,814
<i>- But please
- Promise me anything</i>

903
01:06:02,815 --> 01:06:04,783
<i>Give me love</i>

904
01:06:07,953 --> 01:06:10,649
- Cool it, Ava. Now, just... Wait!
- Oh, come on!

905
01:06:12,591 --> 01:06:13,990
You promised!

906
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:23,012
- Now, just one second.
- Come on, darling, don't tease me.

907
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:36,509
- Ava, down, girl. No, just... No, no, wait.
- Baby, come on.

908
01:06:52,864 --> 01:06:55,128
<i>Robert, Robert.</i>

909
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,324
Robert?

910
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,832
Robert.

911
01:07:02,877 --> 01:07:05,018
Robert, I am so
disappointed in you

912
01:07:06,578 --> 01:07:08,307
Don't you have...

913
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:14,134
Robert? Robert,
you look positively...

914
01:07:15,348 --> 01:07:18,353
<i>Robert...
May I call you Bob?</i>

915
01:07:20,892 --> 01:07:23,486
- Why not?
- You know something?

916
01:07:24,263 --> 01:07:26,377
You're whole new you.

917
01:07:27,266 --> 01:07:30,361
- Only on the outside.
- I just can't resist you now.

918
01:07:30,662 --> 01:07:33,651
Bob, it's no use.
I'm yours.

919
01:07:33,972 --> 01:07:37,908
<i>- No, Dolores.
- Bob, are you afraid to be alone with me?</i>

920
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:39,843
<i>No, no, it's not that.
It's just that...</i>

921
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:43,577
<i>I just don't trust myself,
now that I have my pig bristles gone.</i>

922
01:07:43,578 --> 01:07:47,619
Good! Them let's go someplace where
we can be alone. Let's fly to the moon.

923
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:50,653
Dolores, could you help me
with my research now?

924
01:07:50,756 --> 01:07:53,725
- I have lots of questions to ask.
- Just anything, Bob.

925
01:07:53,726 --> 01:07:56,045
Now, surf dwellers.

926
01:07:56,046 --> 01:07:58,129
Tell me, what´s is
this irresistible magnet...

927
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:01,495
that draws and holds
this tribe here to the beach?

928
01:08:02,526 --> 01:08:07,019
Well, it's fascinating. It's exciting.
The mystery of it all.

929
01:08:07,906 --> 01:08:10,043
And the little unexplained things.

930
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:15,093
Like, just the other night, a fisherman saw
a little ghost plane with blue lights

931
01:08:15,447 --> 01:08:17,472
land right here
on the beach.

932
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:22,119
And when they went to investigate,
the plane had just disappeared.

933
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,553
Like magic.

934
01:08:24,322 --> 01:08:26,415
Real spooky.

935
01:08:26,992 --> 01:08:29,051
You know, we might blast off
in that little ghost plane...

936
01:08:29,127 --> 01:08:30,219
with the blue lights

937
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,477
even though they're
red and green.

938
01:08:31,478 --> 01:08:34,232
You see, Bob?
Now with your pig bristles gone,...

939
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:36,699
even you are beginning to feel
the thrill of the beach.

940
01:08:36,769 --> 01:08:40,535
Come on. Let's go find
the little blue lights and fly to the moon.

941
01:08:46,868 --> 01:08:50,114
- Bob. it is an airplane!
- Yes, it is.

942
01:08:50,115 --> 01:08:52,784
Oh, Bob, I've never been in an airplane!
Could we go for a ride?

943
01:08:53,285 --> 01:08:55,515
Quiet, quiet, please.

944
01:08:55,721 --> 01:08:57,350
All right. I'll take you.

945
01:08:57,351 --> 01:08:59,728
But it'll have to be in the middle
of the night when the beach is deserted.

946
01:08:59,729 --> 01:09:03,628
Now, promise me something.
You won't breathe a word of this to a soul.

947
01:09:03,629 --> 01:09:06,530
- My lips are sealed.
- Good. Just keep them that way.

948
01:09:07,132 --> 01:09:09,600
I'll tell you what.
You go home and get some sleep...

949
01:09:09,668 --> 01:09:12,762
and meet me back here
at 3:00 in the morning.

950
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:14,833
- Bob.
- Yes?

951
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:17,607
You're just the coolest coolest.

952
01:09:24,716 --> 01:09:28,152
I never been so
insulted in my life!

953
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:34,224
Hey, what...

954
01:09:34,826 --> 01:09:38,125
Oh, it's you, Ava.
I thought you were with Frankie.

955
01:09:38,396 --> 01:09:40,455
I was.

956
01:09:40,532 --> 01:09:44,832
- Well, what'd he do?
- Nothing. That's the trouble.

957
01:09:45,037 --> 01:09:47,597
Maybe he was hungry, too.

958
01:09:49,241 --> 01:09:50,265
Marianne.

959
01:09:52,043 --> 01:09:54,671
Marianne, come take a look.
I've shaved...

960
01:09:54,746 --> 01:09:56,145
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH

961
01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:02,980
Marianne, jealous.

962
01:10:03,956 --> 01:10:04,956
Well, why not?

963
01:10:06,358 --> 01:10:08,326
I'm a whole new me.

964
01:10:29,915 --> 01:10:33,544
- Which one is it?
- It's one of them there.

965
01:10:34,045 --> 01:10:37,431
You're a big help.
Hey, what's that?

966
01:10:38,523 --> 01:10:40,286
Looks like a chick.

967
01:10:41,426 --> 01:10:43,690
I could see that, you stupid.

968
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,461
Let's go.

969
01:11:07,085 --> 01:11:08,746
Oh, it's you.

970
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:12,913
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, Von...

971
01:11:14,225 --> 01:11:16,250
And what you doing here?

972
01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:20,633
It's a secret. We got a
surprise for that Sutwell guy.

973
01:11:20,634 --> 01:11:23,093
- I love secrets.
- Oh, yeah?

974
01:11:23,902 --> 01:11:25,961
We'll tell you all about it
as soon as we give it to him.

975
01:11:26,571 --> 01:11:29,734
Which one of these is he in?

976
01:11:30,742 --> 01:11:33,677
I don't know.
I'm stranger in this country, too.

977
01:11:35,013 --> 01:11:38,949
- Are you alone?
- Yeah. I'm looking for someone.

978
01:11:42,621 --> 01:11:43,645
Yeah?

979
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:45,680
Yeah.

980
01:11:46,376 --> 01:11:48,577
Come on, Zipper.
Let's go get him.

981
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:50,885
Yeah.

982
01:11:51,596 --> 01:11:55,000
Stick around, chick.
You'll see Von Zipper in action.

983
01:11:55,433 --> 01:11:57,492
All right, I stick around.

984
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:10,566
Now, listen. The only thing
you gotta watch for are this fingers.

985
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:14,553
Now, he's only got two of them,
one there and one here.

986
01:12:14,753 --> 01:12:18,223
Now, there are seven of us
and only two of them.

987
01:12:19,024 --> 01:12:23,243
You and you each grab a finger,
and then I'll hit him.

988
01:12:23,244 --> 01:12:24,679
- Got it?
- Yeah!

989
01:12:27,266 --> 01:12:28,733
You stupids!

990
01:12:31,036 --> 01:12:33,561
But which house is it?

991
01:12:34,406 --> 01:12:35,839
You stupid.

992
01:12:50,222 --> 01:12:51,655
That one.

993
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,589
Let's go. Will you...
Will you...

994
01:13:28,493 --> 01:13:29,892
You stupids!

995
01:13:33,565 --> 01:13:35,533
I can't see nothing!

996
01:13:44,542 --> 01:13:46,271
- Don't holler!
- Help!

997
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:48,538
- You're hitting me!
- Help!

998
01:13:50,648 --> 01:13:51,706
Dolores.

999
01:13:53,109 --> 01:13:54,109
Help!

1000
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:02,253
Hey! Do you hear a scream?

1001
01:14:02,254 --> 01:14:03,709
It's just Dolores and that man.

1002
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:05,583
Help!

1003
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,794
- Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me, please.
- Help me!

1004
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:14,534
What's...

1005
01:14:14,806 --> 01:14:17,798
Zipper! It's the finger!
Let's get out of here!

1006
01:14:21,146 --> 01:14:22,238
You...

1007
01:14:22,313 --> 01:14:24,781
- Quit! Quit! I'm going!
- Get out of here!

1008
01:14:29,082 --> 01:14:31,239
Oh, I'm terribly sorry I...

1009
01:14:41,533 --> 01:14:43,057
You all right?

1010
01:14:43,602 --> 01:14:45,433
Here, I'll help you.

1011
01:14:50,676 --> 01:14:52,667
There we are. That's it.

1012
01:14:53,779 --> 01:14:55,679
No, no. No, this way.

1013
01:14:56,281 --> 01:14:57,373
Yes.

1014
01:15:01,266 --> 01:15:03,168
- Oh, Bob.
- Dolores.

1015
01:15:05,957 --> 01:15:08,448
- What happened?
- I've been so frightened.

1016
01:15:16,734 --> 01:15:19,202
- What?
- I don't believe it.

1017
01:15:22,407 --> 01:15:25,376
We... I mean, she...

1018
01:15:25,443 --> 01:15:27,240
- Frankie...
- They...

1019
01:15:47,432 --> 01:15:50,295
They seemed a little restless,
Frankie and the rest of them.

1020
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,404
They didn't seem to believe
that I was saving you from that...

1021
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:56,474
You mean that
carbon-monoxide commando?

1022
01:15:56,541 --> 01:15:58,065
Yeah, that's the fellow.

1023
01:15:58,576 --> 01:16:01,568
They seem to think
that it wasn't just an accident.

1024
01:16:05,009 --> 01:16:07,410
How'd you learn to fly?

1025
01:16:07,411 --> 01:16:11,054
Oh, I don't know. They lifted me
out of my wheelchair into a Cub,

1026
01:16:11,055 --> 01:16:13,114
and somehow I made it.

1027
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:16,617
- That was before the war, of course.
- Which one?

1028
01:16:19,231 --> 01:16:20,858
Spanish-American.

1029
01:16:22,467 --> 01:16:25,129
Oh, you're teasing.
I'll bet it was World War I.

1030
01:16:25,236 --> 01:16:26,635
You know...

1031
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:31,141
You know, Dolores,
incredible as it may seem to you,

1032
01:16:31,142 --> 01:16:32,939
it was a World war II,

1033
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:35,828
and I was an instructor
of combat aerobatics.

1034
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:36,910
What does that mean?

1035
01:16:37,982 --> 01:16:40,416
Well, that-s the art of getting
the opponent off your tail...

1036
01:16:40,485 --> 01:16:42,486
without being shot down.

1037
01:16:42,987 --> 01:16:45,285
Could you show me
how it works right now?

1038
01:16:45,356 --> 01:16:46,823
Yes. Yes, I could.

1039
01:17:00,872 --> 01:17:02,305
What was that?

1040
01:17:02,373 --> 01:17:05,809
Oh, that was just primary stuff.
A simple loop. Did you like it?

1041
01:17:05,877 --> 01:17:08,038
It was simple enough, I guess.

1042
01:17:14,753 --> 01:17:16,744
- Did you enjoy it?
- I loved it.

1043
01:17:17,155 --> 01:17:19,988
But before you do it again,
let's get an opinion from my stomach.

1044
01:17:20,058 --> 01:17:22,117
- You know, when... Your stomach?
- Yeah.

1045
01:17:22,193 --> 01:17:24,718
- I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
- That's all right.

1046
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:27,835
The analgesic for your stomach
is the Chinese Eight.

1047
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,334
- Bob?
- Yes?

1048
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:41,037
- You all right?
- Sure.

1049
01:17:41,145 --> 01:17:43,010
Isn't this a sensational
curriculum though?

1050
01:17:43,081 --> 01:17:46,539
It was designed for the Air Force by
a friend of mine, Colonel Wyatt Johnson.

1051
01:17:46,651 --> 01:17:48,881
Are you sure it wasn't Wyatt Earp?

1052
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,252
Isn't this a great little plane?
It'll do anything.

1053
01:17:59,364 --> 01:18:02,390
Will it land? That'd be fun.

1054
01:18:02,515 --> 01:18:04,515
You don't want land.
You don't...

1055
01:18:06,337 --> 01:18:08,396
Oh, yes, I guess you do.

1056
01:18:09,674 --> 01:18:11,733
Right away, Dolores.
Right away.

1057
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,340
There we are.

1058
01:18:16,381 --> 01:18:18,781
- You're all right?
- Oh, I'm fine.

1059
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,119
Oh, no. Look, I'd better
help you home.

1060
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:25,617
No, no, there are times
when one must be alone.

1061
01:18:26,758 --> 01:18:28,757
Will I see you tomorrow?

1062
01:18:28,758 --> 01:18:30,849
Only if they allow me visitors.

1063
01:18:40,738 --> 01:18:44,105
Oh, fine. Blasting off to the moon.

1064
01:18:44,442 --> 01:18:45,704
Sitting on a bed. A likely story.

1065
01:18:45,777 --> 01:18:49,110
Marianne, I tell you, it's not my fault.
I didn't plan it this way. It just happened.

1066
01:18:49,213 --> 01:18:52,239
Just because you no longer look
like Father Time, don't get ideas.

1067
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,079
- It's later than you think.
- Listen, you've gotta help me.

1068
01:18:54,152 --> 01:18:55,244
I've got a problem.

1069
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:57,913
- You're so right.
- Dolores thinks she's in love with me.

1070
01:18:57,989 --> 01:19:01,584
Your problem is you're too
young for her, mentally.

1071
01:19:01,993 --> 01:19:03,426
Look... Oh, Marianne.

1072
01:19:03,494 --> 01:19:06,292
You criticized Fitzhampton
for going native.

1073
01:19:06,397 --> 01:19:08,058
Look at that outfit.

1074
01:19:08,614 --> 01:19:11,702
What's wrong with it?
It's part of my research.

1075
01:19:12,003 --> 01:19:14,563
Marianne, look, please help me.

1076
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:16,402
Look, if I can make her believe
that there's something...

1077
01:19:16,474 --> 01:19:19,102
- between you and me then I could...
- Use me.

1078
01:19:19,477 --> 01:19:21,809
If you want a pinch hitter,
call Mickey Mantle.

1079
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:25,172
Oh, please, don't put it that way.
That sounds so uncouth.

1080
01:19:25,283 --> 01:19:27,308
Just like you've always done.

1081
01:19:27,418 --> 01:19:32,151
<i>"Save me from the aborigines. Help me
with this report, with that report. "</i>

1082
01:19:34,192 --> 01:19:35,284
I'm...

1083
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:37,657
I don't know why I've stuck with you
all these years.

1084
01:19:37,762 --> 01:19:38,940
You're never even noticed that...

1085
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:42,632
That I've...

1086
01:19:44,202 --> 01:19:45,669
been around.

1087
01:19:50,174 --> 01:19:53,302
Oh, hello. Hello, Dolores.

1088
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:56,175
Sit down. Relax.
I'll be right with you.

1089
01:19:57,014 --> 01:19:58,276
You beast!

1090
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:01,882
Beast? Oh, you mean this.

1091
01:20:01,986 --> 01:20:04,181
Please don't let this worry you.
Marianne's very understanding.

1092
01:20:04,288 --> 01:20:07,780
- I'm sure you are, too.
- Understanding? Bob, what do you mean?

1093
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:10,487
Well, I mean, after all
the years that we...

1094
01:20:10,488 --> 01:20:15,065
Well, naturally, you didn't think that...
We're very cosmopolitan.

1095
01:20:15,066 --> 01:20:16,328
You know.

1096
01:20:16,329 --> 01:20:18,529
You shave off a red beard
and become a bluebeard!

1097
01:20:23,508 --> 01:20:27,945
- I think she's gone.
- I think it worked fine.

1098
01:20:28,966 --> 01:20:33,169
- Professor? Professor?
- Please, call me Bob.

1099
01:20:34,051 --> 01:20:35,075
Bob.

1100
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,150
- You could stop now.
- I could.

1101
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:42,117
You know, I've suddenly
discovered something.

1102
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:46,130
- You have?
- Yes. I... I'll tell you later.

1103
01:20:48,499 --> 01:20:52,902
<i>Oh, the rocking' goony bird
is seldom ever heard</i>

1104
01:20:53,004 --> 01:20:58,067
<i>Even in the reaches
of his jungle home</i>

1105
01:20:58,176 --> 01:21:00,906
The beast! He's a beast.

1106
01:21:01,012 --> 01:21:02,081
Dee Dee, what's the matter?

1107
01:21:02,082 --> 01:21:05,616
Don't you dig Father Time
without his pig bristles?

1108
01:21:05,617 --> 01:21:08,450
Shut up! Can't you see
she's had a traumatic experience?

1109
01:21:08,553 --> 01:21:11,422
I think it's about time that
somebody gave that hairless Chihuahua...

1110
01:21:11,923 --> 01:21:14,084
- a little trauma of his own.
- Yeah!

1111
01:21:14,692 --> 01:21:16,592
- Come on!
- Let's go.

1112
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:19,926
- Hey, where you going?
- Over there.

1113
01:21:20,031 --> 01:21:21,624
- I'm going with you!
- Can I go?

1114
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:23,441
You stay here.
After I've finished with him,

1115
01:21:23,442 --> 01:21:25,245
I'm coming back to
Seattle with you!

1116
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:40,961
- I wanna talk to you.
- Yeah. Yeah!

1117
01:21:41,285 --> 01:21:45,085
- Make it quick. I'm busy.
- Okay. Are you gonna marry her?

1118
01:21:45,858 --> 01:21:49,225
- Well, I hadn't really...
- Dolores, I mean!

1119
01:21:49,226 --> 01:21:50,226
Dolores?

1120
01:21:50,922 --> 01:21:52,988
For heaven's sake,
me marry Dolores?

1121
01:21:52,989 --> 01:21:57,017
That's right. The ring, minister,
ceremony, the whole bit

1122
01:21:57,568 --> 01:21:58,796
Who's she?

1123
01:21:58,903 --> 01:22:00,598
- She happens to be...
- His girl.

1124
01:22:00,599 --> 01:22:02,901
Boy, for an oldie,
you really move around.

1125
01:22:03,441 --> 01:22:06,740
- He takes vitamins.
- If you...

1126
01:22:06,811 --> 01:22:08,108
Hey, Frankie, what's this?

1127
01:22:08,179 --> 01:22:11,239
Oh, for heaven's sake, would you
stay away from these instruments?

1128
01:22:11,315 --> 01:22:14,143
- It's expensive electronic equipment.
- I know what he is. He's a spy!

1129
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,181
- A spy?
- What's this?

1130
01:22:17,188 --> 01:22:19,748
- Give me that.
- Back off, cowboy.

1131
01:22:19,874 --> 01:22:22,924
"The Sutwell Report".
I told you he's a spy.

1132
01:22:23,247 --> 01:22:25,362
Well, that accounts
for the phony beard.

1133
01:22:25,363 --> 01:22:26,697
Oh, for heaven's sake,
this is the most ridiculous thing...

1134
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:29,360
- Fellows, listen to this.
- Please...

1135

"And post-adolescent surfing societies
are primitive in origin,

1137
01:22:40,878 --> 01:22:42,812
Hey, what's that mean?

1138
01:22:43,204 --> 01:22:45,488
It means he's using
us for case studies.

1139
01:22:46,114 --> 01:22:49,128
- Me and Dolores and all of us.
- Yeah?

1140
01:22:49,129 --> 01:22:51,884
- He's putting us down.
- Yeah!

Hey, they're gone. Give me that.
Come on. Let's go!

1144
01:23:11,008 --> 01:23:14,034
Pies and beer.
Pies and beer.

1145
01:23:14,145 --> 01:23:15,510
I like it.

1146
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:23,447
Go away.
Leave us alone, will you?

1147
01:23:27,224 --> 01:23:29,590
Cappy, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1148
01:23:29,994 --> 01:23:30,661
Cappy...

1149
01:23:30,662 --> 01:23:31,890
What's going on here?

1150
01:23:32,496 --> 01:23:34,089
Listen, is there anyplace
that you can hide us?

1151
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:38,035
- Who are you?
- Sutwell. R. O. Sutwell, remember?

1152
01:23:38,036 --> 01:23:39,818
- Old pig bristles?
- I came...

1153
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:42,339
Yeah. What'd you do
with the face mop?

1154
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,570
- He's in disguise.
- Marianne, please!

1155
01:23:45,071 --> 01:23:47,568
Cappy, I'm in trouble.
Big, big trouble.

1156
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,644
That figures. You probably got
involved with that Dolores Chick.

1157
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:54,044
- We want Sutwell.
- Marianne, I... What's that?

1158
01:23:54,552 --> 01:23:56,713
Look, hide us. Put us in...

1159
01:24:04,262 --> 01:24:06,492
Now I know how
General Custer felt.

1160
01:24:06,793 --> 01:24:08,884
Now, here he comes.
Singing Bull.

1161
01:24:10,201 --> 01:24:11,634
Blast off.

1162
01:24:13,276 --> 01:24:15,157
So this is what you
think of us, huh?

1163
01:24:16,807 --> 01:24:18,468
Yes, it is!

1164
01:24:18,576 --> 01:24:21,977
And if I ever get a chance to finish it,
it'll be an unusual scientific achievement.

1165
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:23,770
You used us.
You used all of us!

1166
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:25,957
You made Dolores fall in love
with you for an experiment.

1167
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:28,785
Oh, for heaven's sake,
this little girl doesn't love me!

1168
01:24:28,786 --> 01:24:30,613
She was pretending
to make you jealous, right?

1169
01:24:30,914 --> 01:24:32,619
That's right, Frankie.
I tried to tell you that.

1170
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,489
Gee, I don't know
what you're all so upset about.

1171
01:24:34,592 --> 01:24:38,323
You were doing the same thing
with that Hungarian goulash over there.

1172
01:24:38,429 --> 01:24:40,954
You know what you need?
You need a leader.

1173
01:24:41,065 --> 01:24:43,932
- Somebody to show you the way.
- Way to do what?

1174
01:24:44,001 --> 01:24:46,299
- If you...
- Shut up, goo-goo.

1175
01:24:46,404 --> 01:24:49,237
Yeah, shut up, goo...
And what's more...

1176
01:24:49,238 --> 01:24:53,966
There ain't no more.
Eric Von Zipper said he'd be back.

1177
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:56,678
He's back.

1178
01:24:58,783 --> 01:25:00,250
With an army.

1179
01:25:09,135 --> 01:25:11,754
- All right, where is he?
- He who?

1180
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:14,364
You know I'm talking about.
Where is he?

1181
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:16,066
- I don't know.
- What, what, what?

1182
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:19,833
- That's him.
- That's him? You stupid!

1183
01:25:19,904 --> 01:25:22,031
- The brush is gone.
- The...

1184
01:25:33,685 --> 01:25:36,141
You know, I liked him better
with the jaw warmer.

1185
01:25:36,854 --> 01:25:39,220
Don't you get this?
This is the Samson bit.

1186
01:25:39,224 --> 01:25:41,784
Without the hair,
he ain't nothing.

1187
01:25:44,195 --> 01:25:45,321

1188
01:25:49,567 --> 01:25:51,000

- You stupid.
- I'm sorry.

1214
01:28:03,734 --> 01:28:06,066
I got an army of stupids.

1215
01:28:08,672 --> 01:28:12,039
<i>This way, folks.
Just step right this way, please.</i>

1216
01:28:12,142 --> 01:28:13,575
Now we have Big Daddy's.

1217
01:28:14,579 --> 01:28:17,343
A favorite spot of the teenagers
to gather and have fun,

1218
01:28:17,515 --> 01:28:19,176
good, clean fun.

1219
01:28:23,487 --> 01:28:26,479
Of course, there's a teahouse
across the street...

1220
01:28:36,967 --> 01:28:38,366
Be gentle.

1221
01:28:42,573 --> 01:28:44,438
Who do you think
you're playing with? Kids?

1222
01:28:44,442 --> 01:28:45,652
My army.

1223
01:28:46,053 --> 01:28:48,445
Look, wreck the
joint if you wanna,

1224
01:28:48,446 --> 01:28:51,279
but whatever you do,
watch out for Big Daddy!

1225
01:29:02,793 --> 01:29:03,919
Look out!

1226
01:29:05,335 --> 01:29:06,335
Give me one of those pies!

1227
01:29:13,883 --> 01:29:17,140
Honey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
Honey, I didn't mean it.

1228
01:29:17,141 --> 01:29:21,135
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Listen to me, honey. I didn't mean it.

1229
01:29:35,426 --> 01:29:37,656
- Too late.
- I'm sorry.

1230
01:29:38,062 --> 01:29:39,859
Too late for what?

1231
01:29:44,668 --> 01:29:46,636
Sluggish nervous system.

1232
01:29:48,172 --> 01:29:50,299
Professor?

1233
01:29:51,108 --> 01:29:53,008
Yes, Mr. Von Zipper?

1234
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:55,977
I wondered if we could
talk for a minute.

1235
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,414
- Do you mean like a palaver?
- We could do that, too.

1236
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:04,253
All right, Mr. Von Zipper.

1237
01:30:08,325 --> 01:30:10,520
- Watch him. You can't trust him.
- Thanks.

1238
01:30:10,627 --> 01:30:11,992
Look, professor...

1239
01:30:11,993 --> 01:30:13,491
Could we be friends?

1240
01:30:17,234 --> 01:30:18,531
Why not?

1241
01:30:19,369 --> 01:30:21,769
Look, Professor,
now that we're buddies,

1242
01:30:21,939 --> 01:30:24,840
I wonder if you could
learn me something.

1243
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:26,394
Oh, yes. I know what
you want to know.

1244
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:29,512
The Himalayan time
suspension technique.

1245
01:30:29,513 --> 01:30:31,777
Yeah. Could you teach me that?

1246
01:30:32,783 --> 01:30:34,011
It's possible.

1247
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,776
Good. Because see, that way,
I wouldn't need a army.

1248
01:30:35,777 --> 01:30:37,287
'Cause, anyway,
they're, you know...

1249
01:30:37,288 --> 01:30:37,714
I thought so.

1250
01:30:38,415 --> 01:30:40,259
Yeah, so if you could teach me that,
then I couldn't need a army.

1251
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,218
I could go around to anybody
if I didn't like them

1252
01:30:42,219 --> 01:30:44,153
and I could take the
fingers and press...

1253
01:30:44,345 --> 01:30:47,019
Please, may I tell you that
I only teach this to people...

1254
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:55,370
How do you like that?

1255
01:30:58,845 --> 01:31:01,462
Big Daddy's waking up!
He's waking up!

1256
01:31:01,605 --> 01:31:04,847
He's gonna give us the word!

1257
01:31:04,848 --> 01:31:08,045
Well, come on, Big Daddy.
Give us the word.

1258
01:31:10,654 --> 01:31:12,087
The pit.

1259
01:31:13,891 --> 01:31:17,827
Bring me my pendulum, kiddies.
I feel like swinging.

1260
01:31:19,897 --> 01:31:24,493
<i>Well, I looked at the heavies
They were rolling' in fast</i>

1261
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:26,670
<i>I knew I'd better make it
'cause they just don't last</i>

1262
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:29,105
<i>I'm surfing'</i>

1263
01:31:29,106 --> 01:31:32,098
<i>Swinging' and a-surfing'</i>

1264
01:31:32,209 --> 01:31:35,076
<i>Well, the sand and the sea
is the only life for me</i>

1265
01:31:35,379 --> 01:31:36,437
<i>I'm surfing'</i>

1266
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:38,606
He still hasn't come out of it.

1267
01:31:40,268 --> 01:31:42,306
You know, I kind of
like him this way.

1268
01:31:53,397 --> 01:31:56,377
- Say it again.
- I love you.

1269
01:31:56,378 --> 01:31:58,302
Oh, that sounds so wonderful.

1270
01:32:17,221 --> 01:32:19,712
Well, I guess my research
is just about finished.

1271
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,788
It almost finished both of us.

1272
01:32:22,089 --> 01:32:23,793
You know, Marianne,
you won't believe this,

1273
01:32:23,894 --> 01:32:26,055
but my next trip is going to
be to the Mariana Islands.

1274
01:32:26,563 --> 01:32:27,421
- Oh?
- Yes.

1275
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:29,766
And I'm looking desperately
for an assistant.

1276
01:32:30,267 --> 01:32:31,127
You are?

1277
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:34,313
Someone who can keep me
from getting involved,

1278
01:32:34,314 --> 01:32:36,407
with the natives, that is.

1279
01:32:37,754 --> 01:32:40,796
I think I know someone
who could keep you uninvolved...

1280
01:32:41,345 --> 01:32:43,438
with the natives, that is.

1281
01:32:51,422 --> 01:32:53,287
I'll be back.
Just you wait.

1282
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:55,788
Eric Von Zipper will be back!

1283
01:33:02,966 --> 01:33:05,264
Hey! Wait for me!

1284
01:33:07,704 --> 01:33:09,137
You stupid.

1285
01:33:18,715 --> 01:33:21,149
THE END...
ALMOST

1286
01:33:41,372 --> 01:33:43,670
<i>Keep a-moving' and a-grooving'
Don't stop now</i>

1287
01:33:43,741 --> 01:33:45,299
<i>Don't stop now</i>

1289
01:33:49,013 --> 01:33:50,480
<i>Don't stop now</i>

1290
01:33:51,415 --> 01:33:53,975
<i>Whoa, baby, when you shake so fine</i>

1291
01:33:54,051 --> 01:33:56,713
<i>I get the fits and chills
up my spine</i>

1292
01:33:56,821 --> 01:33:59,756
<i>What you're doing' is getting' to me

<i>Wind it up let it go now
Don't hold back</i>

1295
01:34:04,673 --> 01:34:07,108
<i>Don't hold back</i>

1296
01:34:07,398 --> 01:34:10,016
<i>Wind it up and let it go now
Don't hold back</i>

1297
01:34:10,017 --> 01:34:11,017
<i>Don't hold back</i>

1298
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:15,338
<i>Whoa, baby, when you dance so wild</i>

1299
01:34:15,406 --> 01:34:18,102
<i>You make me feel
like a motherless child</i>

1300
01:34:18,103 --> 01:34:20,711
<i>What you're doing' is getting' to me
Don't stop now</i>

1301
01:34:20,712 --> 01:34:21,712
<i>Don't stop now</i>

1302
01:34:23,247 --> 01:34:28,082
<i>Treat him nicely</i>

1303
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:31,268
<i>With his love be kind</i>

1304
01:34:33,023 --> 01:34:38,256
<i>Had I listened to
advice I'm giving you</i>

1305
01:34:38,362 --> 01:34:42,458
<i>He might still be mine</i>

1306
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:51,699
I got an army of stupids.

1307
01:35:09,093 --> 01:35:12,256
<i>Well, I looked at the heavies
