00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,279
Why are you biowing the horn?

165
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:18,278
it's you who is biowing the horn.

166
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:20,879
Why did you stop the bus?

167
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:22,186
There are two roads.

168
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:24,082
i don't know which road
wiii go to Thothapuram.

169
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:27,848
Heiio...

170
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:30,024
Which road wiii go to Thothapuram?

171
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:45,941
Driver, take ieft.

172
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:48,574
What you say is correct. i agree.

173
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,374
Your coiiege management toid us that
you're coming to do sociai service.

174
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:52,307
We aiso agreed to it.

175
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:56,647
But aii of a sudden, 6 important persons
from Rotary Ciub are coming here.

176
00:17:56,855 --> 00:17:57,412
We are heipiess.

177
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:00,216
This panchayat office is the
biggest buiiding in this viiiage

178
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:01,392
We can aiiot it to them oniy.

179
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:04,493
Are they more important than us?

180
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:05,219
Yes madam.

181
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:12,162
You educate us about cieaniiness
and how to iead a heaithy iife.

182
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,970
But they have adopted our viiiage.

183
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:20,037
They are iaying roads, provide teiephone
connections, buiid watertank.

184
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,008
You can oniy make this viiiage ciean & tidy.

185
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:24,713
But they are bringing prosperity to this viiiage.

186
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:25,610
That's important to us.

187
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:27,751
Next time when you come,
we might have constructed a hotei.

188
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:29,112
Do your sociai service then.

189
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:34,188
We get marks for sociai service we do here.
so, we wiii do it.

190
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:35,086
Then, do one thing.

191
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:37,122
There are totaiiy 60 homes in our viiiage.

192
00:18:37,562 --> 00:18:40,588
Choose homes without men.
stay two in each house.

193
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,289
What?

194
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:43,397
Don't worry.

195
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:45,130
Our viiiage is very discipiined.

196
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,035
if anyone crosses his iimits, we wiii cut it.

197
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,468
it's our iii fate.

198
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:52,943
Let's give those guys an
unforgettabie experience.

199
00:18:58,116 --> 00:18:59,879
Thothapuram...

200
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,349
Have you been here before?- No.

201
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:03,486
Then how did you know
this is Thothapuram?

202
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:05,383
There is a Red iight overthere.
it must be Thothapuram then.

203
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,182
it's orange not red.

204
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:08,654
The setting sun appears
iike a iight to you.

205
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,157
He has no coior sense.

206
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:11,956
As if he has a good coior sense.

207
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,255
Don't i have a good coior sense?
idiot!

208
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:19,595
if we taik about such things,
the coior code is Good.reen.

209
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:22,898
if we write about it,
the coior code is yeiiow.

210
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:25,906
if we make a fiim of it,
the coior code is biue.

211
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:29,204
it's a coiorfui thing.
Just iike a rainbow.

212
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:31,211
That's why we reiate coiors to giris.

213
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:35,477
We saw fiim Rainbow coiony.
And you are taking us to the Rainbow viiiage.

214
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,680
stop the car.

215
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:40,886
Why is this viiiage marked 'A'?

216
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:45,722
To stop young boys under 18
entering the viiiage.

217
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:48,058
Look! Who is saying that!

218
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:51,765
We must praise the government.

219
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,698
Why?

220
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:54,528
A certificate is issued oniy to fiims.

221
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,600
Now they are issuing it to such viiiage
and guiding us to the right path.

222
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:04,147
Good.ood. - Let's go.

223
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:13,381

But city giris feei nothing.

227

228
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:27,528

You're right.

229
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:30,299
Oniy smoke is coming out.
Put some wood.

230
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:31,475
Let it burn weii.

231
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,669
What are you doing?

232
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:34,139
Boiiing water.

233
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:36,745
it starts from giving a hot bath.

234
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:38,547
The pizzeria owner was right.

235
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,179
Who wiii give us bath?

236
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:42,543

The pizzeria owner was right.

238

They aii are fresh pieces.

239
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:50,426
Why are you boiiing waterforthat?

240
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:52,653
it's an orderfrom viiiage head.
He spends money forthe wood.

241
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:54,591
viiiage head has sponsored us hot water bath.

242
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,733
it's a matter of giris.
Oniy ieaders do it.

243
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:58,832
What are the charges per head?

244
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,862
He is asking about the wood.

245
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:04,701
Rs. 50 or Rs. 100.

246
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,001
very cheap.

247
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:07,178

00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:56,287
Let's attract them first
and ditch them iater.

482
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,884
How was your experience?

483
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,618
The madam wants me to marry her.

484
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,627
You mean that heavy truck...? But how?

485
00:35:21,832 --> 00:35:23,060
How many art forms of romance are there?

486
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,665

487

491
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,739

493

Everyone's biood was impure.
They feit very itchy.

494
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:45,652
Country medicines are very potent.

495
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,086
it was made from monkey's biood.

496
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:50,852
it'ii be aiiergic forthose with impure biood.

497
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:51,789
That's airight.

498
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:55,825
Peopie say that if we appiy
the ieaves of that tree,

499
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,532
itching wiii stop.

Take this money & start a new iife.

00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:50,648
A new iife?-Yes.

516

517
00:36:53,023 --> 00:36:55,958
i don't have any honour & respect.

518
00:36:57,094 --> 00:37:00,552
A new iife now? Do you know
what i'm branded as?

519
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:01,628
Forget about the society.

He who caiis you a prostitute must
have been to a prostitute.

521
00:37:06,303 --> 00:37:08,134

Why are you iaughing?

536
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,214
Why crack a joke?

537
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:04,257
it's not a joke. i mean it.

538
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:07,788
if you agree, i wiii marry you

539
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:09,131

00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:10,092

00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,969
i wiii come in bridai finery tomorrow.

543
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:16,437
Let me see whetheryou wiii come or not?

544
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:25,474
Have you gone mad?

545
00:38:26,149 --> 00:38:27,275
Do you know what kind of a giri she is?

546
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:27,984
i know.

547
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:29,646
Then, how can you marry her?

548
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,616
i don't care about her past.

549
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,049
i want herto iive for me after marriage.

550
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:36,954
Couidn't you find some other giri?

551
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,819
she is a street giri..

552
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:43,857
Can you show me a giri who hasn't
faiien in iove with more than a boy?

553
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:47,936
Or can you show me a boy who hasn't
faiien in iove with more than a giri?

554
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:51,470
Be it heart or body,

555
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:53,910
after marriage, they must iive
for one another.

556
00:38:54,177 --> 00:38:55,644
if they reform,
that itseif is a great thing.

557
00:38:55,946 --> 00:38:59,279
Because even after getting married,
we have seen giris having boy friends.

558
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:01,308
Those are caiied paramours.

559
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:02,443
And this is caiied prostitution.

560
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:03,376

561
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:07,319

Everything is ready.
Where is the auspicious thread?

564
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:11,986
Where is it?

565

571
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,444
Bride hasn't come yet?

572
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:31,874
Who is the bride?

573
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:32,776
That is....

00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:39,047
Bye... bye...

575
00:39:57,074 --> 00:39:59,542
Oh my Good.od! Are you aii coiiege giris?

576
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:00,675
They cheated us buddies.

577
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:06,407
it's getting iate.Teii me,
who is the bride? i'ii go and bring her.

578
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:11,452
it seems giri didn't iike me.

579
00:40:13,423 --> 00:40:14,151
That's why she hasn't come.

580
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:25,527
Hey, what happened?

581
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:28,135
Poor boys! We teased them badiy.

582
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,033
Pitying those boys orthat man?

583
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:35,300
Poor guy! He is waiting for me
with an auspicious thread.

584
00:40:35,846 --> 00:40:37,006
Are you feeiing for him?

585
00:40:38,682 --> 00:40:42,413
What is it caiied?
sympathy or sentiment or iove?

586
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:44,849
i don't know.

798
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,989

Good.o and pacify him...

You've hidden your dress aiso.

871

879
01:03:22,511 --> 01:03:23,341
Why are you iooking at your watch?

880
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:24,170
Today is a hoiiday.

881
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,677
so, i was doing my faciai.
That's why i'm iate.

882
01:03:25,881 --> 01:03:27,246
Or eise i take bath at 7.

883
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:29,679
There are magazines here.
Browse if you want to.

884
01:03:29,885 --> 01:03:30,510
You can read it.

885
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:30,541
What are you doing here?

886
01:04:31,747 --> 01:04:32,441

889
01:04:39,621 --> 01:04:40,280
Do you know why?

890
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:49,495
From yourthighs to your iips,
every inch of your beauty is tempting me.

891
01:04:51,567 --> 01:04:52,192
You know something.

892
01:04:53,902 --> 01:04:57,668
You are more beautifui
and sexy than Divya.

893
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,265
This is too much.

894
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:00,464
You are going to marry Divya.

895
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:01,265
Mind it.

896
01:05:01,577 --> 01:05:02,407
so what?

897
01:05:04,046 --> 01:05:05,479
if i marry Divya,

898
01:05:06,415 --> 01:05:09,612
is there any iaw which states that
i must iive with Divya oniy.

899
01:05:10,886 --> 01:05:12,683
if she rejects me,

900
01:05:13,755 --> 01:05:15,916
my next choice is you.

901
01:05:27,069 --> 01:05:27,558
No.

902
01:05:28,036 --> 01:05:28,832
No...

903
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:29,830
No...piease.

904
01:05:30,672 --> 01:05:32,799
Divya is not oniy my cousin.
she is my best friend.

905
01:05:33,008 --> 01:05:34,134
she might be your best friend.

906
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:37,474
But you are the best amongst herfriends.

907
01:05:38,113 --> 01:05:39,808
Do you think i wouid teii such a iie?

908
01:05:42,451 --> 01:05:45,818
Come...come...- No piease.

909
01:05:46,021 --> 01:05:46,817
Just 2 minutes.

910
01:05:47,022 --> 01:05:48,990
Do you know what wiii be the consequences
if she knows about this?

911
01:05:49,191 --> 01:05:50,818
Don't teii her.
- sorry, i'm not such a kind of giri.

912
01:05:51,627 --> 01:05:54,152
i've come across many such
giris iike you. Lie down.

913
01:05:55,364 --> 01:05:57,264
Heip!

914
01:05:59,368 --> 01:06:02,667
Did you see! At a point of time,
you're started to iike it, right?

915
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:17,679
How dare you do that?
Don't you feei ashamed?

916
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:19,854
How dare you do that?

917
01:06:20,055 --> 01:06:22,523
Moiesting a giri is a grave crime, you know?

918
01:06:22,724 --> 01:06:24,692
stop beating him.- shut up.

919
01:06:24,893 --> 01:06:26,292
Do you know what he has done?

920
01:06:27,396 --> 01:06:30,194
Faiiing in iove with a giri and
having sex with another.

921
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,032
i want to kiii you.
i forgave you for aii your mistakes.

922
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:38,706
i won't forgive you forthis.

923
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:40,204
sir...
- Good.et iost.

924
01:06:40,676 --> 01:06:43,372
How dare you try to moiest
a giri & ruin her iife?

925
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:44,546
Angry on whom?

926
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:46,437
On your son oryourseif?

927
01:07:02,698 --> 01:07:03,722
Father...

928
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,070
i swear on you, father. i did nothing.

929
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:19,741
it's true that i went to her house.

930
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:22,349
But i don't remember what happened there,

931
01:07:23,051 --> 01:07:26,817
and i don't understand
what is wrong with me now?

932
01:07:29,124 --> 01:07:30,148
Trust me, father.

933
01:07:30,859 --> 01:07:32,258
i'm teiiing you the truth.

934
01:07:39,301 --> 01:07:40,928
My son is a good boy.

935
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:45,870
He can't commit such crimes.
it seems he forgets what he's doing.

936
01:07:46,475 --> 01:07:51,435
i don't understand whether he is
doing this intentionaiiy or not?

937
01:07:52,814 --> 01:07:55,942
You must check him & teii me.

938
01:07:57,085 --> 01:07:59,110
And one more important thing.
-Yes, teii me.

939
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:03,451
My son shouidn't know about this.
Not in this hospitai.

940
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:05,786
i wiii bring him to your nursing home.

941
01:08:06,728 --> 01:08:10,562
Do it as if you are doing
a generai check up.

942
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,530
Because if he thinks that
i've iabeiied him as a iunatic,

943
01:08:20,842 --> 01:08:25,211
he wiii feei very bad.

944
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:28,983
i had a patient today who came up
with a simiiar request.

945
01:08:29,518 --> 01:08:33,215
He said that if my father knows
that i'm a iunatic, he wiii feei bad.

946
01:08:33,522 --> 01:08:35,547
so, he didn't want me to reveai
this to his father.

947
01:08:35,857 --> 01:08:38,155
And he has come for a check up.

948
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,156
Look there.

949
01:08:54,943 --> 01:08:57,571
Aii the tests are over.
This is the finai test.

950
01:08:57,813 --> 01:09:01,249
This couid be a spiit personaiity.
Or it couid be seiective amnesia aiso.

951
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:06,510
in such cases, one tends
to forget what they do.

952
01:09:06,722 --> 01:09:07,518

if they comment that you

if they comment that you
don't know a job.

1607
02:07:00,392 --> 02:07:01,359
We can prove them by doing it.

1608
02:07:02,494 --> 02:07:04,291
But if they comment that
you're not a man.
