0
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000


1
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:45,165
In a bungalow all covered with roses

2
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:49,323
I will settle down I vow.

3
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:55,725
That's why I'm looking at the world
through rose-coloured glasses...

4
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,845
There are those, I suppose,

5
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,160
think we're mad, Heaven knows.

6
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,084
The world has gone to rack and ruin.

7
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:21,681
What we think is chic, unique

8
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:24,284
and quite adorable

9
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:28,364
they think is odd and
Sodom- and Gomorrah-able.

10
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,284
But everything today
is thoroughly modern.

11
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:37,686
Check your personality.
Everything today makes yesterday slow.

12
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:41,240
Better face reality!
It's not insanity,

13
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:43,879
says Vanity Fair.

14
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:48,407
In fact, it's stylish to raise
your skirts and bob your hair.

15
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,207
In a rumble seat the world is so cosy
if the boy is kissable.

16
00:08:55,729 --> 00:09:00,325
And that tango they wouldn't allow
now is quite permissible.

17
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:04,438
Goodbye, good-goody girl,
I'm changing and how!

18
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:07,079
So beat the drums,
'cause here comes

19
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:14,201
thoroughly modern Millie now.

20
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:16,323
Everything is thoroughly modern.
Bands are getting jazzier.

21
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:20,483
Everything today is starting to go.
Cars are getting snazzier.

22
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,280
Men say it's criminal
what women'll do.

23
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:27,281
What they're forgetting is

24
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:29,645
that this is 1922.

25
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:36,801
Have you seen the way they kiss
in the movies? Isn't it delectable?

26
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:41,805
Painting lips and pencil-lining your
brow now is quite respectable.

27
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,043
Goodbye good-goody girl,
I'm changing and how!

28
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,326
So beat the drums,
'cause here comes

29
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:55,123
thoroughly modern Millie now.

30
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:53,845
35 cents, please.
- A pen, please.

31
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:56,319
A pen?
- To write a check.

32
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:59,562
35 cents I said,
not 35 dollars.

33
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,846
Who writes a check for 35 cents?

34
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:03,967
Oh, I do.

35
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:07,318
You can get it from your desk clerk.

36
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,527
But I don't live here, as yet.

37
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,203
Look, a pen.

38
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:16,284
Lady, I got 7 kids and 1 in the oven.
I can't take a check.

39
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:19,522
The date?
- I can't take no check!

40
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,720
No check? But it's
from the Gotham National Bank.

41
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:26,199
I don't give a hoot...
- Can I help?

42
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:29,567
You got 35 cents cash?
American?

43
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:32,529
Yes, I think so.
- Thank you, Miss.

44
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:40,200
Yes, I do.
Here: 10, 20, 30... 5.

45
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,445
You did say 35?
- Yeah, yeah.

46
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:51,206
Ain't every day you meet a Vanderbilt
and a Rockefeller.

47
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:56,042
Thank you.

48
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:09,363
Oh, but my bags?

49
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:13,803
It's all right. We can manage.
I live here. - Oh, thank you.

50
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:37,208
Allow me.

51
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,920
It is a middle-class hotel, isn't it?
- Yes.

52
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,685
Perfect.
- My name is Millie Dillmount.

53
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:50,759
Perfect. I'm Miss Dorothy Brown
from California.

54
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,046
I do hope there's room for me.

55
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:56,639
Yes?

56
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,721
Dear me.

57
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,438
This is Mrs. Meers, our house mother.
- How do you do?

58
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:05,285
How do you do? I'm
Miss Dorothy Brown from California.

59
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:08,522
How do you do? And who are you?

60
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:13,445
Oh, you're Millie. - It's the new me.
Toss your cares and curls away.

61
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:15,880
What can we do for you, Dorothy?

62
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:18,843
Miss Dorothy. I'm looking for a room.

63
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:22,048
I have a nice one on the 12th floor.

64
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:25,646
On the 12th floor? - Yes.
Directly across the hall from you.

65
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:29,724
Ethel Peace just checked out.
- But she only just checked in.

66
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:32,689
She went back to Wyoming.

67
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,683
But why?
She has no one there.

68
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,807
Oh, just a restless girl.

69
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:42,805
Now if you'd register, Dorothy.
I mean, Miss Dorothy.

70
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:46,918
The mail just came in.
Always some for you, Millie.

71
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,367
Lonely lady?

72
00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:00,329
One from Brother in Chicago, two from
Mother, one from Sister in Detroit.

73
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:03,278
Millie has such a big, warm family.

74
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,284
You have such a big,
warm family, Miss Dorothy?

75
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:12,005
I'm an orphan.
- Are you?

76
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,802
Sad to be all alone in the world.

77
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,202
Thank you.

78
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:39,968
Gung ho, dear.

79
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,205
Heavy on the starch!

80
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:55,162
Thank you, Millie.

81
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:09,647
How long have you lived here, Millie?
You look lived in.

82
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:13,837
About 3 months.
Yes, I'm getting quite hard.

83
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:18,800
I'm looking for life raw and real.
I'm going to be an actress.

84
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:23,885
An actress? How exciting.
- Yes, But I've got to live first.

85
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:28,282
You should do very well on stage.
Pictures, too.

86
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:38,843
Would you mind closing the doors
and pressing number 12? - Not at all.

87
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:42,918
Thank you.

88
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:51,362
It's broken. - No, just temperamental.
Try again.

89
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:09,840
Some showgirls used to practice
their routines in here.

90
00:17:10,249 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh, I love it. In the Ritz elevator
all you do is go up and down.

91
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:27,597
Would you mind taking over?

92
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:34,601
Is today your day off?
You are working girls, aren't you?

93
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:39,207
Just a minute. Yes, I just put myself
through business school.

94
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:40,644
A stenog.

95
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,758
Tomorrow I start interviewing bosses.
- I thought the other way around.

96
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,683
I can type 40 words in a minute.
I'm in demand.

97
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:53,402
Besides, I'm going to marry my boss,
whoever he may be.

98
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,118
You're a modern.
- Thoroughly!

99
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:07,159
I must study you
if I'm going to be an actress.

100
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:10,003
The theatre is full
of ruthless women.

101
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:13,128
"Art reflects life."
That was in a speed test.

102
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:15,406
But it's true. Women today are free.

103
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:20,560
For the first time we're man's equal.
We can make a life for ourselves.

104
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,960
And I fully intend to.
- So do I.

105
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,801
Would you mind opening the door,
Miss Dorothy?

106
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:10,804
Something tells me
you're not poor.

107
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:14,167
Ask me no questions,
and I'll tell you no lies.

108
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:17,481
One thing I know for sure.
You've travelled a lot.

109
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:18,958
Miss Dorothy?

110
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:23,203
There's little else for an orphan
to do. - Here we are.

111
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:30,165
I'm just across the hall,
if you need anything.

112
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,566
There's a dance tonight.
Wanna go?

113
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:38,006
Perfect. Would you
introduce me to the gang?

114
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:42,402
They're pretty high-spirited.
- Poor people usually are.

115
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,403
Watch out for the boys.
They pinch.

116
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,200
Excuse me, please.

117
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:17,557
Don’t worry, the kids will soon
forget your dress is real lace.

118
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:21,279
Don’t be concerned.
I'm having the most interesting time.

119
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:24,408
10 cents, girls.
For decorations and refreshments.

120
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:28,404
I left my checkbook upstairs.
- I've got it. - Oh, Millie.

121
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,040
10, 20.
Dip in and get your money's worth.

122
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,123
Millie, Millie, this is him.

123
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:38,357
Terrif!

124
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:42,963
Oh, delish!

125
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:58,478
Good evening.

126
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,641
Can I help you?
- It couldn't hurt.

127
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,324
I mean, are you looking for someone?
- Not anymore.

128
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:07,439
He's fresh as paint.
- He's just full of apple sauce.

129
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,886
May I introduce myself? - It's just
a friendship dance. - Jimmy Smith.

130
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:18,077
Millie Dillmount, and this is Miss
Dorothy Brown. - Pleasure to meet you.

131
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,439
I was just passing the hotel
when I heard the snappy music.

132
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,409
You don't know anyone here?
- Sure, you. Dance?

133
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,802
I studied ballroom and tap,
but I'm not up on the latest dances.

134
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:33,838
I always make up my own anyway.
Dorothy. - Miss Dorothy.

135
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,439
Give me a name. - What for?
- Our new dance.

136
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:47,364
I never named a dance before. - What
did you have for dinner? - Franks.

137
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:49,248
Franks?

138
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:56,201
What else?
- Sauerkraut. - Sauerkraut?

139
00:21:58,489 --> 00:21:59,763
No, what else?

140
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,488
Tapioca pudding.

141
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,163
Tapioca?

142
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,485
Join me in the tapioca? And...

143
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:26,958
Well, then.

144
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:34,048
Now what do I do?
- Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap.

145
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,681
That's too hard.
- Where are you going?

146
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,125
Everybody, tap, tap, tap, tap.

147
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:50,649
Tap, tap, tapioca. Everybody,
slap, slap, slap, slap,

148
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:52,960
slap, slap, slapioca.

149
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:55,837
If you got the dap, dap, dap, dap,

150
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,365
dappier flappers, flap, flappier.

151
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,966
Everyone is happier

152
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:03,604
when they do the tap tapioca...

153
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:08,798
when they do the flap flapioca...

154
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:33,364
A cup of punch, Miss Dorothy?
- Oh, yes, please.

155
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:36,045
Welcome to the Priscilla.

156
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:37,684
Thank you.

157
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:41,560
Excuse me.
- Yes.

158
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:57,524
They are clever, aren't they?
- Yes, aren't they?

159
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:04,364
Millie's a wonderful girl.
- Sweet.

160
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:19,398
A good friend, too.
First real friend I've ever had.

161
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,918
Sad to be all alone in the world.

162
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:27,363
My own recipe. Fruit.

163
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:31,757
Mrs. Meers, meet a terrif dancer
and a nice person, Jimmy Smith.

164
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:34,524
This is Mrs. Meers, our house mother.
- Pleasure to meet you.

165
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:37,523
Allow me. - Darn nice manners.
What a personality.

166
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:41,285
Care to dance, Mrs. Meers?
- Thank you. No.

167
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:44,197
I believe this one is mine.

168
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:47,043
And this is yours, Miss Dorothy.

169
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:50,043
Care to dance, Miss Dorothy?
- Oh, no thanks.

170
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:53,566
Go on, do it.
- I shan't break up a splendid team.

171
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:58,963
A darn nice party, Mrs. Meers.
- Please, go, enjoy yourselves.

172
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:05,642
You know the tapioca? - I believe not.
- It's the latest.

173
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:08,358
Well, I'm here to learn.

174
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:16,920
Pretend we've got a bowl.
We're gonna have some sport. Ha!

175
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:26,437
Add trumpled licks and a ragtime beat.
About a quart. Yeah!

176
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:35,926
Ya stir and stir with your knee,
adding a bump or two.

177
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:42,088
Ya heat it, mash it,

178
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:44,525
beat it, smash it,
if there's a lump or two.

179
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:14,368
Don’t let the temperature drop
too many degrees,

180
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:18,205
or you'll wind up with what is called
the frozen tapioca freeze.

181
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:19,724
Everybody...

182
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:24,919
tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tapioca.
Everybody, freeze!

183
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:26,558
Slap, slap,

184
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:31,121
slap, slap, slap, slap, slapioca.
Everybody, freeze!

185
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:05,281
Cinderella time?
- I'm afraid so.

186
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:10,843
I've got my employer's red roadster
outside. Care for a spin?

187
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:12,728
Sure.

188
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:22,518
I have to be back by 10:30.
- You betcha.

189
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,167
Look out!

190
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:30,638
I love driving on the wrong side.
Don’t you? - Terrif.

191
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:34,999
Take the wheel.
- I've never driven a car.

192
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:39,925
You never named a dance before.
The starter, the gas and the break.

193
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:43,799
The starter, the gas and the break.
- Yeah.

194
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:54,839
What other firsts ahead? Love?

195
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:58,286
Love? I see you're old-fashioned.

196
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:11,158
Okay?

197
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:16,240
Not too old-fashioned.

198
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:21,447
That's nice to hear,
but I know I could do better.

199
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:24,677
Jimmy, I'm going to marry my boss.
- When?

200
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:28,877
I don't know. I haven't got one yet.
I start looking for work tomorrow.

201
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,487
But I have plans, and I think
it only fair that you know.

202
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:35,607
Terribly fair.

203
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:39,447
I'm your equal. I'm going to meet
you men on your own terms,

204
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:43,728
cater to your craving for efficiency,
learn to talk sports, tell jokes,

205
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:47,678
smoke, drink and, if I have to,
I'll even kiss you back.

206
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:52,802
Love has nothing to do with it.
- I see.

207
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,598
We fought the war to end all wars.

208
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,807
Now's the time for fun,
especially for the new woman.

209
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:03,202
'Cause the old rules are out, and
they haven't made up new ones.

210
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:11,524
I never met a modern before.
- My beauty spot!

211
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:15,518
How am I doing?
- You're doing well.

212
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,965
What do you do for your employer?

213
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:20,929
What?
- I mean, what's your line of work?

214
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,479
I'm in steel equipment for offices.

215
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:27,848
Oh, paper clips like?
- Yeah. - I must get back.

216
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:31,561
Can I see you again?
That is, until you get engaged?

217
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,565
Oh, sure.

218
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:41,081
It's the 20th century.
I hope I'm up to it.

219
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:11,561
Mrs. Meers.

220
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:14,039
So late and still working?

221
00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:17,247
Yes, very late.
Everybody should be in bed by now.

222
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,117
I have to do something here
with this spot on the carpeting.

223
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,838
A spot? - Yes.
- Where? - Here.

224
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:26,526
I can't see a thing.
What kind of cleaner is that?

225
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:29,807
Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce?

226
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,448
What do you know?
I must write Mama.

227
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:35,123
Do that.

228
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:41,637
Good night.

229
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,528
Soy sauce.

230
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:53,327
Have a good time? - Sure.
He had his employer's red roadster.

231
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:58,359
Oh, Millie. Machines like gloves
should be black or white.

232
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,561
Are you sweet on him?

233
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:07,168
Oh, no. I've no time for puppy love.
I start boss-hunting in the morning.

234
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:10,641
Right. Good night. - Good night.
- Good luck. - Thank you.

235
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,757
Oh, give them hell.

236
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,084
Soy sauce.

237
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:05,842
Flannery, Miss Flannery.
Director of female personnel.

238
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:08,480
I run a no-nonsense organization.

239
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:12,206
Is that rouge?
- Yes, ma'am.

240
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:17,399
Why did you call ahead to make sure
Mr. Graydon was single?

241
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:20,559
I have no more time to waste.

242
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:24,041
You look fast to me.
- 40 words a minute.

243
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:28,408
No nonsense, girl. Mr. Graydon's
door is at the end of the hall.

244
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:30,288
Thank you.

245
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:01,285
He means, "Come in."

246
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:11,122
Hi, there, Miss Dillmount.

247
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:18,681
Right on the old button!
That's swell, just swell!

248
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:21,762
"Punctuality,
the pride of princes."

249
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,283
Beautiful.

250
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:34,762
How's that? - Your beautiful
baseball trophy. I love baseball.

251
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:38,722
I won it for golf.

252
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:40,562
I love golf, too.

253
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:42,846
Swell game. Play much?

254
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:48,205
Golf's my hobby,
insurance my business.

255
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:52,238
You come highly recommended.
Bolt the door, take off your things.

256
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:55,803
Take a letter to...

257
00:33:56,209 --> 00:34:00,407
to Mr. Harold Hudson.
You'll find his letter in the file

258
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,323
and an invoice
in the outer desk.

259
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:07,358
"Dear Mr. Hudson,

260
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,964
The shipment of floor wax
was rancid..."

261
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:17,887
Babyface,

262
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,961
you've got the cutest little

263
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,401
Babyface.

264
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:30,800
There is no other one
could take your place,

265
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:32,688
Babyface.

266
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:37,042
You sure have started something.

267
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,405
Babyface,

268
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:44,200
I'm up in heaven
when I'm in your fond embrace.

269
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:48,921
I didn't need a shove,
'cause I just fell in love

270
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:54,084
with your pretty Baby...

271
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,847
You've got the cutest little...

272
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:39,843
Swell.

273
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:41,841
Swell.

274
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:45,878
Congratulations, Miss Dillmount.
You've made the team.

275
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:10,042
Miss Dorothy.

276
00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:13,040
No luck today either?

277
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:15,688
No, Mrs. Meers.

278
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:19,843
The only thing producers want to do
with me is take liberties.

279
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:25,244
Sinful, but cheer up.
I've got something for you.

280
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:27,765
A California apple for you.

281
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:30,440
Thank you, Mrs. Meers.

282
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,362
It smells so fresh.

283
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:36,488
I'll bet it's juicy.

284
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:38,841
We had apple orchards.

285
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:42,002
Don’t look back.
Face it.

286
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:45,881
Don’t, Miss Dorothy!

287
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:49,998
You'll spoil your appetite. They're
going to set a doozy of a table.

288
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:54,004
Hello, Mrs. Meers. Did you forget
about the wedding night? I'm singing.

289
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,888
Mazaltov!

290
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:47,837
Groom, bride, mazaltov.

291
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:00,884
Drink to life,
it's wedding time.

292
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:04,599
Drink to life,
drink a glass of wine.

293
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,126
Let us sing,
it is such a joy.

294
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:12,727
Let us dance,
we should be happy.

295
00:39:13,129 --> 00:39:15,324
Play on, musicians,
for the parents-in-law...

296
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,685
This is Jewish.

297
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:21,247
...for the groom.
Play louder,

298
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:26,279
so we can't hear
the two mothers

299
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:30,159
crying bitter tears.

300
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:34,085
Drink to life
is what mazeltov means.

301
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:37,845
Make a circle
that turns and turns.

302
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:41,924
A happy person
has money, too.

303
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:45,162
Drink to life
for the entire world.

304
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:52,601
Dance everybody. Dance
for the groom and the bride.

305
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:56,797
Be happy people.

306
00:39:57,209 --> 00:40:00,201
Dance...

307
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:27,479
Oh, I'm sorry.

308
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:48,839
Drink to life,
it's wedding time...

309
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,440
Mazeltov!

310
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:34,362
Mr. Graydon's office.
Who's calling, please?

311
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:37,078
Jimmy!
- Dillmount! - Hold on.

312
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:42,438
A telephone is business equipment.
Not a back fence to gossip over.

313
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:43,998
Yes, ma'am.

314
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:52,324
Hello.
- Are you sitting on his lap?

315
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:54,685
I've been here a week. Where were you?

316
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:56,807
On business.
- Oh, I wondered.

317
00:42:57,209 --> 00:43:00,087
I spoke to my boss about
your paper clips. - Thanks.

318
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:03,162
Did you kiss him back yet?
- No.

319
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:06,288
Has he held your hand? - No.
- Got a pet name? - Yes.

320
00:43:06,689 --> 00:43:09,522
What? - John.
- John? - John. - John?

321
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:11,408
That's not very romantic.

322
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:14,687
But it's modern.
Mr. Graydon is very business-like.

323
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:19,640
But he's not cold.
He's manly, but not gruff.

324
00:43:20,049 --> 00:43:23,883
He calls me John, because I'm
so efficient. "Johnny on the spot."

325
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:27,721
I'm wearing a new dress, and...
- What time do you get off?

326
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:30,768
Half day Saturday.
- Like to go for an outing?

327
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:32,924
That sounds grand!

328
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:36,002
Lunch and dinner.
Ask Miss Dorothy to join us.

329
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:38,718
Miss Dorothy?
- She's still around?

330
00:43:39,129 --> 00:43:41,518
Sure, I'll ask her.
- Pick you up at 12:45.

331
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:46,286
Fine. Jimmy, I'm still
going to marry my boss.

332
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:51,879
Over my dead body!

333
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:56,525
I guess his nickel was up.

334
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:02,481
John, write a memo to Splife.
The paper was not up to snuff.

335
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:08,168
Yes, sir. - Sorry luck. Not pleased.
Take it back.

336
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:12,162
Yes, sir. Got you!

337
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:24,239
You ought to try a pipe.
Separates the men from the boys.

338
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:28,437
Mr. Graydon, you're just a tease.
- Swell dress.

339
00:44:58,089 --> 00:44:59,602
Oh, Jimmy!

340
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:05,042
I said,
the sky's the limit.

341
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:06,564
What a thrill!

342
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:12,089
My employer's. But he's out of town,
so I can use it whenever I want to.

343
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:15,083
I'll teach you to fly.
- You're razzing me.

344
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:19,528
Just another first.
We're facing a lot of 'em, aren't we?

345
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:23,927
Jimmy, look there!

346
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:22,759
Raspberry!

347
00:46:36,689 --> 00:46:39,567
Holy mackerel.
Who was that?

348
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,846
Mrs. Van Hosmere, our hostess.

349
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:44,399
The outing's at her house.

350
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:48,048
We're flying over it now.
- Where?

351
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:59,119
That's a house?
I mean, somebody lives down there?

352
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:01,918
It's a mansion,
but she calls it a cottage.

353
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:06,686
My father used to be her gardener.
She's always been very good to me.

354
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:13,242
Miss Dorothy!

355
00:47:13,649 --> 00:47:16,721
That house down there...

356
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:20,644
I can't hear...
- The party is down...

357
00:47:24,689 --> 00:47:26,008
Oh, thank you.

358
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:30,721
That house down there...
Oh, look! Terrif!

359
00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:36,523
A golf course. Mr. Trevor Graydon's
favourite. That's where we're going.

360
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:11,084
Baron Richter, those loop-the-loops
are affecting my inner ear.

361
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:18,966
Why, Baron Richter.
You're perfectly marvellous.

362
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:22,805
To think we were against you
in the late war.

363
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:26,042
There you go.

364
00:48:27,009 --> 00:48:28,283
Down you go, little Miss Dorothy.

365
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:37,968
Welcome, welcome, everybody.

366
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:43,160
Welcome, everybody. Hello, Jimmy.
The grass needs cutting.

367
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:46,681
She thinks I'm the only one
who can trim the lawn like my father.

368
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:50,604
Do you promise to succumb
wholeheartedly to the merriment?

369
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:53,569
Why, Mrs. Van Hosmere is
glamorous and gay.

370
00:48:54,049 --> 00:48:58,167
Muzzy, call me Muzzy.
You, too, Miss Dorothy.

371
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:02,801
My flying instructor, everybody does.
We're all very friendly here.

372
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,320
Jimmy, I am proud of you.

373
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:13,484
Two delightful young ladies. I had
no idea you had such a good eye.

374
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:17,404
I do hope you all
have the most marvellous time.

375
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:20,642
Anything you want and don't see,
you just ring.

376
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:25,443
Well, now, what have we here?

377
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:28,079
Corky, the ace of hearts!

378
00:49:32,489 --> 00:49:34,639
Love is very, very near.

379
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:45,965
You mustn't believe what you see.
Muzzy's full of tricks.

380
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:53,481
Baron Richter, I'm going to need
popping soon again.

381
00:50:24,129 --> 00:50:25,881
Sensational, Muzzy.

382
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:28,242
My dance instructor.

383
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:31,125
Gregory Huntley.

384
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:09,327
Oh, where'd you get that dress?
- I rang for it.

385
00:51:09,729 --> 00:51:13,278
Gee whiz.
Great wealth is so classy.

386
00:51:13,689 --> 00:51:16,761
Everything's so perfect.
It's just like in the movies.

387
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:20,161
Except for me. The very gates
of real society in a plaid dress.

388
00:51:20,569 --> 00:51:24,482
What's wrong? - I feel unworthy.
- You look worthy. - But look at her.

389
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:26,686
She looks very worthy, too.

390
00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:30,604
You know, Jimmy, you're a pip.
Everybody likes you.

391
00:51:31,009 --> 00:51:33,807
If you take it in stride, so can I.
- Who's better than we are?

392
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:39,237
Only in America can a gardener's son
receive such spiffy treatment.

393
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:40,718
Jimmy.

394
00:51:41,129 --> 00:51:46,044
Miss Tremaine, may I present...
- I've had the pleasure.

395
00:51:46,449 --> 00:51:48,201
Millie Dillmount, Judith Tremaine.

396
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:50,288
How do you do?

397
00:51:54,689 --> 00:51:56,805
I couldn’t help
overhearing your remark

398
00:51:57,209 --> 00:52:02,920
about the gardener's son.
Jimmy's father had such a green thumb.

399
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,479
We hoped Jimmy
would take after him.

400
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:10,485
But there's been little evidence.
Good gardeners are hard to come by.

401
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:14,878
Perhaps he prefers paper clips.
- Perhaps.

402
00:52:15,689 --> 00:52:19,728
That gross diamond ring of Muzzy's
took my breath away.

403
00:52:20,129 --> 00:52:21,960
Not completely, Miss Tremaine.

404
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:25,840
No, not completely.

405
00:52:31,129 --> 00:52:32,118
Bitch!

406
00:52:32,529 --> 00:52:34,804
Miss Dorothy!
- I love you.

407
00:52:45,049 --> 00:52:46,767
Ladies and gentlemen,

408
00:52:47,169 --> 00:52:49,444
attention! Thank you.

409
00:52:49,849 --> 00:52:53,205
I have persuaded my star pupil
that she's ripe,

410
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:56,169
after only 5 nights of study,

411
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:59,529
to make her singing debut tonight.

412
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:06,288
Okay, Muzzy.

413
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:09,280
She's miraculous.

414
00:53:17,729 --> 00:53:20,880
My daddy was
a ragtime trombone player.

415
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:24,406
My mommy was
a ragtime cabareter.

416
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:29,485
They met one day at a tango tea.
There was a syncopated wedding,

417
00:53:29,889 --> 00:53:32,961
and then came me.

418
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:36,566
Folks think the way I walk
is a fad.

419
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:43,966
But it's a birthday present
from my mommy and daddy.

420
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:51,728
I'm a jazz baby.

421
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:54,960
Little jazz baby, that's me.

422
00:53:55,929 --> 00:53:59,638
There's something
in the tone of a saxophone

423
00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:03,041
that makes me do a little wiggle
all my own.

424
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:06,282
I'm a jazz baby.

425
00:54:08,009 --> 00:54:10,967
Full of jazz-bo harmony.

426
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:14,884
"Walk the Dog" and "Ball the Jack"
caused all the talk.

427
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:18,406
It's just a copy of the way
I naturally walk.

428
00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:22,643
'Cause I'm a jazz baby.

429
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:25,279
Little jazz baby, that's me.

430
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:32,359
Rock to sleep
while the cradle went to and fro.

431
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:36,205
To and fro to the tune
of the tickle-toe.

432
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:40,085
Ever since I started to grow

433
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:44,607
love to hear the music playing,
see my dear old mommy swaying.

434
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:48,160
Razz-ma-tazz,
that's all I ever knew.

435
00:54:48,569 --> 00:54:52,528
All day long
I would never get through.

436
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:56,365
Jazz-ma-tazz,
that's all I want to do.

437
00:54:56,769 --> 00:55:01,763
So play me a little jazz...

438
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:39,438
Jazz...

439
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:41,726
Baby...

440
00:56:42,129 --> 00:56:45,804
Full of jazz-bo harmony.

441
00:56:46,209 --> 00:56:50,521
The wailing of the saxes
when those fellas go mad

442
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:54,808
cannot compare with what
I got from Mommy and Dad.

443
00:56:55,209 --> 00:56:59,441
So hear this jazz baby...

444
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:22,878
Miraculous!

445
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:29,843
Little jazz baby, that's me.

446
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:45,318
Swell! Just swell!

447
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:48,118
Everything's swell!
And you're just

448
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:50,759
swell!
- Let's be kissy.

449
00:57:51,169 --> 00:57:53,285
You like our place, do you?
- It's swell.

450
00:57:53,689 --> 00:57:57,728
I can't wait to meet Mr. Van Hosmere.
- He went to his reward years ago.

451
00:57:58,129 --> 00:57:59,847
You said "our place."

452
00:58:00,249 --> 00:58:03,525
When I married Mr. Van Hosmere
he was a widower.

453
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:06,807
I came to all this
as the second Mrs. Van Hosmere,

454
00:58:07,209 --> 00:58:10,201
and I felt like a frozen quill
in Queen Mary's behind.

455
00:58:10,609 --> 00:58:13,806
But Mr. Van H. Just swiped me
on the butt and said,

456
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:19,602
"Lady van Hosmere, it's our cottage.
Not my cottage, not yours, but ours.

457
00:58:20,009 --> 00:58:21,920
Don’t you ever forget it!"

458
00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:27,926
Unfortunately, I enjoyed him but
for a brief but very ecstatic period.

459
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:31,685
Sad. - Yes, and Mr. Van H. Hated
sad stories.

460
00:58:32,089 --> 00:58:35,399
He wanted our place to be filled
with good fun and good friends.

461
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:40,246
Despite the noble experiment
we have a sufficiency of gin.

462
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:43,243
So drink up, everyone.
You're all invited to spend the night.

463
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:46,959
We have plenty of extra PJs.
Myself I sleep in the altogether.

464
00:58:49,249 --> 00:58:49,999
Muzzy,

465
00:58:50,409 --> 00:58:54,687
you ought to be congratulated for
the enchanting grab-bag of people.

466
00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:57,842
It's so amusing to rub shoulders
with all kinds.

467
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,479
And, darling, your ring!

468
00:59:00,889 --> 00:59:02,607
How big is it?

469
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:04,442
About 2 quarts.

470
00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:12,082
Raspberries! I've been waiting
all evening for someone to ask.

471
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:16,838
I thought it was real.
- It is real. I had it drilled.

472
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:21,288
The mascara has run
onto my brand-new dress from Paris!

473
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:26,160
Where? Don’t worry. I know
something that cleans it.

474
00:59:26,569 --> 00:59:28,127
You can't see a thing.

475
00:59:30,169 --> 00:59:32,922
Soy sauce!

476
00:59:37,089 --> 00:59:39,728
Soy sauce!

477
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:45,845
She's coloured my Paris gown
with soy sauce.

478
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,479
Please, Miss Tremaine, I...
- You! You!

479
00:59:49,209 --> 00:59:50,961
Inviting a stupid shop girl!

480
00:59:51,369 --> 00:59:54,167
Miss Tremaine, if I could...
- Idiot!

481
00:59:54,569 --> 00:59:57,686
Don’t you know anything?
Of course you don't!

482
00:59:58,089 --> 01:00:02,446
I'll tell you
what's going on around here, you boob!

483
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:04,408
Miss Tremaine.

484
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:10,645
I will take care of dress.

485
01:00:11,729 --> 01:00:15,199
No, I'm going home.

486
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:17,601
Tea will show you out.

487
01:00:22,249 --> 01:00:23,807
I'm sorry.

488
01:00:27,729 --> 01:00:31,847
I thought it would clean it.
Honest. Mrs. Meers swears by it.

489
01:00:32,249 --> 01:00:36,288
Holy mackerel.
A dress from Paris, France...

490
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:38,327
Let's go home.

491
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:42,722
We have to spend the night.
It's ceiling zero in New York.

492
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:44,039
Oh dear!

493
01:00:44,449 --> 01:00:49,967
Don’t worry. It's like a film complete
with a witch, Judith Tremaine.

494
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:52,200
You're laughing at me.
- No. - I don't blame you.

495
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:55,407
And like the films,
there's a smash-bang happy ending.

496
01:00:55,809 --> 01:00:59,358
I'll become the paper clip king, and
I'll hire you for my stenog.

497
01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:03,364
I'd be your boss, and you'd be
after me, and I'd say, "Sure,

498
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:06,158
okay, grand."

499
01:01:06,569 --> 01:01:09,481
How can you be a paper clip king,
when you don't care a whit about work?

500
01:01:09,889 --> 01:01:12,642
You haven't asked me about
Mr. Graydon's interest in paper clips.

501
01:01:13,049 --> 01:01:17,804
You can't be happy-go-lucky all
the time. Make something of yourself.

502
01:01:18,209 --> 01:01:20,200
You're not getting any younger.

503
01:01:26,169 --> 01:01:29,047
Maybe you should try gardening.
- They don't have stenogs.

504
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:32,009
Be serious.
What's to become of you?

505
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:35,481
Do you really care?
- Of course.

506
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:37,117
I like you.

507
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:40,123
And I like you, by jingo!

508
01:01:44,049 --> 01:01:45,687
You've gotta show
some get-up-and-go.

509
01:01:46,089 --> 01:01:50,446
I'll bring our latest paper clips
to show your boss next week.

510
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,718
Don’t. - What's the matter?
- I don't know. I feel...

511
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,246
So do I, Millie. You've unlocked
a room in my heart.

512
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,879
Please, no.
- Millie.

513
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:12,597
Interesting.

514
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:24,998
While I'm thinking of it...
Supper in half an hour?

515
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:28,723
Hello, Millie.

516
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:30,960
Thank you, Juarez.

517
01:02:46,049 --> 01:02:49,166
Sometimes I get the feeling
Juarez is going to bite me.

518
01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:54,597
He's a dear butler. He's teaching me
Spanish and rope tricks and...

519
01:03:01,649 --> 01:03:05,801
Moderns don't cry.
- No, of course not.

520
01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:09,446
I must apologize for my guest.

521
01:03:09,849 --> 01:03:13,558
Judith is a spoiled young lady.
Don’t let her upset you.

522
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:16,688
Muzzy, I'm so mixed up.

523
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:21,287
It's not only Miss Tremaine.
I am a working girl and a boob.

524
01:03:21,689 --> 01:03:24,203
There's certainly nothing wrong
with being a working girl.

525
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:28,045
I was a working girl in a chorus,
but I wasn't a boob.

526
01:03:28,449 --> 01:03:32,488
No, you married well,
and that's exactly my plan.

527
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:36,928
Jimmy told me your plans.
Love has nothing to do with it?

528
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:40,765
I'm a modern.
- You're a boob.

529
01:03:42,049 --> 01:03:44,199
But you...
- You're not going to believe me.

530
01:03:44,689 --> 01:03:49,285
When I met Mr. Van H., I had no idea
he was a multi-millionaire.

531
01:03:49,689 --> 01:03:54,319
He was one of those darling daddies
hanging around the stage door.

532
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:58,518
I mean, he didn't even look
like a multi-millionaire.

533
01:03:58,929 --> 01:04:03,764
And he drank beer.
Facts be known, I prefer beer.

534
01:04:04,169 --> 01:04:06,524
He was a wonderful man.

535
01:04:06,929 --> 01:04:09,489
Affection, that's what he had.

536
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:14,121
We became engaged, and he gave me
a great big old green-glass brooch.

537
01:04:14,529 --> 01:04:18,044
I leant it to my girlfriend
so she could impress a new beau.

538
01:04:18,449 --> 01:04:24,126
As fate would have it,
he turned out to be a jeweller.

539
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:27,123
And the green glass
turned out to be emeralds.

540
01:04:28,209 --> 01:04:30,245
I truly prefer emeralds.

541
01:04:30,649 --> 01:04:33,959
But I was upset.
I thought he had stolen it.

542
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:36,405
I begged him to take it back.

543
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:39,369
He just laughed and laughed.

544
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:44,126
Then he told me
he really was a multi-millionaire,

545
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:47,885
even if he didn't look like one,
and we became married.

546
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:53,886
While I truly do prefer emeralds,
we could've made it on green glass.

547
01:04:55,449 --> 01:04:59,442
While I've been in the bleachers,
you've been a player on the big field.

548
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:05,559
If it's marriage you've got in mind,
love has everything to do with it.

549
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:09,848
Follow your heart.
No raspberries!

550
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:33,399
Jimmy, oh Jimmy.

551
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:36,721
Silly boy.

552
01:05:37,129 --> 01:05:43,398
Gee, what a real swell guy.

553
01:05:43,889 --> 01:05:47,245
Jimmy, oh Jimmy.

554
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:50,083
Oh, what joy.

555
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:56,485
He makes your troubles fly.

556
01:05:57,489 --> 01:06:02,927
His glance has fireworks in it.

557
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:09,208
We kiss,
my heart does a whiz-bang,

558
01:06:09,609 --> 01:06:12,760
flip-flop, heaven-for-a-minute.

559
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:16,798
Jimmy, oh Jimmy.

560
01:06:17,209 --> 01:06:19,769
Don’t you know

561
01:06:20,169 --> 01:06:25,960
what I can't quite confess?

562
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:30,487
So coax me, implore me,

563
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:35,804
I promise you won't bore me.

564
01:06:38,009 --> 01:06:44,005
Jimmy, I might say yes...

565
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:53,049
So coax me, implore me,

566
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:58,842
I promise you won't bore me.

567
01:08:02,409 --> 01:08:05,958
Jimmy, I might...

568
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:07,923
Jimmy!

569
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:15,158
Get in here, little Miss Dorothy.

570
01:09:45,929 --> 01:09:46,884
Good morning.

571
01:09:47,889 --> 01:09:50,642
Hello, everybody.

572
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:52,642
Goodbye, darling.

573
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:55,847
We missed you at breakfast.
- I was in the gym.

574
01:09:56,289 --> 01:09:57,768
Loosening up.

575
01:09:58,769 --> 01:10:00,282
Always searching.

576
01:10:00,889 --> 01:10:04,882
Cruncher, please meet
Millie, Miss Dorothy, Jimmy.

577
01:10:06,689 --> 01:10:09,044
He saves his breath
for the last round.

578
01:10:09,449 --> 01:10:11,917
You're not to be strangers now.

579
01:10:12,329 --> 01:10:15,605
The country club is giving
a "Poor Man's Party."

580
01:10:16,009 --> 01:10:20,241
We all get to wear rags. It should be
worth it. Promise you'll come.

581
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:24,085
Thank you, but my weekends will be
taken up with Mr. Trevor Graydon,

582
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:25,842
my boss.

583
01:10:26,249 --> 01:10:29,366
Perhaps we can motor down for golf.
He's very athletic,

584
01:10:29,769 --> 01:10:34,081
most mature, in contrast to
the flighty boys one meets these days.

585
01:10:34,609 --> 01:10:36,122
And the best-looking thing ever.

586
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:37,968
Yes, of course.

587
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:41,519
Okay, bye-bye, little Millie.

588
01:10:41,929 --> 01:10:47,322
Promise you'll find your way back.
- Oh, Muzzy, you're so worthwhile.

589
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:58,926
She's been so stand-offish
this morning.

590
01:10:59,329 --> 01:11:05,518
Could be she has a hangover.
The bathtub-ring was still on that gin.

591
01:11:58,329 --> 01:12:00,889
Goodbye, Mr. Smith.
It was an experience.

592
01:12:01,729 --> 01:12:04,846
I'll call you.
Hey, Millie! Millie!

593
01:12:16,609 --> 01:12:17,724
Millie?

594
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:21,764
Are you feeling quite well?
- Quite.

595
01:12:22,169 --> 01:12:26,208
I thought your tummy was upset.
- The tummy isn't upset.

596
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:27,837
Good.

597
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:43,644
Something you'd like to tell me?

598
01:12:44,049 --> 01:12:46,040
No, nothing on my conscience.

599
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:10,198
Perhaps there's something
you'd like to tell me.

600
01:13:10,609 --> 01:13:13,885
Well, Millie, I... No, not now.
- Yes, go on.

601
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:18,282
Well, I am terribly upset
about my career.

602
01:13:18,689 --> 01:13:19,883
Your career?

603
01:13:20,289 --> 01:13:23,964
Yes, the world of the stage
just doesn't seem to want me.

604
01:13:24,369 --> 01:13:26,963
They don't know the real you.
Cut your hair.

605
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,566
Let them see
how truly abandon you are.

606
01:13:30,969 --> 01:13:33,437
Cut my hair?

607
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:37,765
I don't understand.
Oh, I couldn't...

608
01:13:38,169 --> 01:13:43,118
People can't find you under the curls.
Good night. - But I...

609
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,403
Good night.

610
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:06,084
What? What is it?
- In my room...

611
01:14:28,409 --> 01:14:29,728
Mrs. Meers!

612
01:14:30,169 --> 01:14:34,321
Asleep in my room,
on my bed!

613
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:39,323
She works a very long day,
poor dear.

614
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,321
Well, good night.

615
01:14:45,929 --> 01:14:46,918
Millie?

616
01:14:56,809 --> 01:14:58,800
What am I going to do?

617
01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:01,798
Oh dear.

618
01:15:08,769 --> 01:15:13,285
Could I spend the night with you?
It'll give us a chance to talk.

619
01:15:13,689 --> 01:15:17,602
If we're going to save our
relationship, we need to talk.

620
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:21,763
Have I done something terrible to you?
Please tell me.

621
01:15:22,169 --> 01:15:26,640
A girlfriend is very precious to me.
I don't want to lose you.

622
01:15:27,809 --> 01:15:30,926
Oh no, you haven't done
anything terrible to me.

623
01:15:31,329 --> 01:15:33,763
After all, I have my plans and...

624
01:15:34,169 --> 01:15:36,160
I'm sorry.

625
01:15:37,169 --> 01:15:40,161
Your friendship is precious to me,
too. You can spend the night.

626
01:15:40,609 --> 01:15:41,724
Thank you.

627
01:15:43,369 --> 01:15:47,442
But there'll be no more talk.
I'm not my brother's keeper, am I?

628
01:15:47,849 --> 01:15:49,441
You can have the bed.

629
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:53,080
No!
- I insist. To make up

630
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:55,525
for my lack of gypsy spirit.

631
01:15:55,929 --> 01:15:59,763
You can't take the small town
out of the girl.

632
01:16:02,249 --> 01:16:06,322
Most irregular. I don't care
how middle-class a place it is.

633
01:16:07,169 --> 01:16:10,206
I really must callous up.

634
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:14,727
Starting tomorrow, I am going
to be unspeakably fatal.

635
01:18:55,129 --> 01:19:00,362
Mr. Graydon's office. Jimmy, you are
always interrupting my life. Stop it!

636
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:04,603
What did I do? - I have work to do,
and I presume you do, too.

637
01:19:05,009 --> 01:19:06,761
Do it and leave me alone.

638
01:19:07,169 --> 01:19:08,761
A day's work for a day's wage.

639
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:13,162
I didn't ask him to call.
I don't want him to call.

640
01:19:13,569 --> 01:19:15,560
Good. Forget the boys.

641
01:19:15,969 --> 01:19:18,767
Get yourself a canary.

642
01:19:22,849 --> 01:19:25,727
Forget the boys.
Get yourself a man.

643
01:19:44,049 --> 01:19:46,483
Do you have a mo?
- A what?

644
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:49,203
A moment?

645
01:19:49,609 --> 01:19:53,841
I would love to get a man's opinion
about Rudolph Valentino.

646
01:19:56,249 --> 01:20:00,367
In "The Sheik" he takes Agnes Ayres
by brute force.

647
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:04,523
And she enjoys it.
She enjoys it a lot.

648
01:20:04,929 --> 01:20:08,001
What is your opinion
of brute force?

649
01:20:08,529 --> 01:20:11,680
I'm not for it.
Not at all.

650
01:20:12,409 --> 01:20:14,718
Many women are unsettled.

651
01:20:15,129 --> 01:20:19,441
Now they are disillusioned.
They are in for truth.

652
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:24,727
Give 'em a young man they can trust.
Tom Sawyer at 20.

653
01:20:25,249 --> 01:20:29,800
I never read Tom Sawyer.
Was he... sexy?

654
01:20:30,329 --> 01:20:34,242
He was only 12.
- When you've got, you've got it.

655
01:20:34,649 --> 01:20:36,958
John!
- Yes, sir.

656
01:20:42,809 --> 01:20:44,845
Take you to lunch?
- Mr. Smith!

657
01:20:45,249 --> 01:20:48,400
You are not going to take me
again ever, anywhere.

658
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:52,722
What did I do? What's wrong?
At least explain yourself.

659
01:20:55,129 --> 01:20:58,121
Not on company time.
- What...

660
01:21:00,049 --> 01:21:02,882
What lovely elbows you've got,
Miss Flannery.

661
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:11,561
From my mother's side of the family.
- Really?

662
01:21:11,969 --> 01:21:14,722
The Bath girls were known
for their elbows.

663
01:21:17,489 --> 01:21:18,717
Out!

664
01:21:20,569 --> 01:21:24,084
Seems I'm leaving.
Bye, Millie. Ouch.

665
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:35,198
John, be a swell scout. Ring up
my club. A handball court for 6:15.

666
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:40,809
Yes, 6:15. - It'll work up a good
sweat. Edgy in the gut, you know.

667
01:21:44,489 --> 01:21:48,687
Edgy in the gut.

668
01:21:56,769 --> 01:21:59,920
You want a pen?
- Yes, of course. To write a check.

669
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:02,797
Lady, it ain't that much.

670
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:09,001
How much?
- 25. - Thank you, Millie.

671
01:22:29,209 --> 01:22:34,920
Oh, sweet mystery of life,
at last I've found thee.

672
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:40,484
Oh, I know
it's just the secret of it all.

673
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:45,565
...22, 23, 24, 25.

674
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:52,809
All the longing, seeking,
striving, waiting, yearning,

675
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:56,838
the burning hopes, the joy

676
01:22:57,249 --> 01:23:00,798
and idle tears that fall...

677
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:02,927
Did I forget something?

678
01:23:05,249 --> 01:23:08,321
This is my friend, Miss Dorothy Brown,
from the hotel.

679
01:23:08,969 --> 01:23:11,119
We were on our way to the Beauty Spot.

680
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:13,884
Miss Dorothy’s going to have
her hair bobbed.

681
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:17,201
Bobbed? With your beauty?

682
01:23:17,609 --> 01:23:19,440
Mr. Graydon. Behave.

683
01:23:19,929 --> 01:23:23,205
I bet you could make
the moon and the stars behave.

684
01:23:23,969 --> 01:23:26,961
Miss Dorothy’s an actress.
The way the theatre’s so rotten...

685
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,839
You wouldn't rob some lucky stiff
of playing with those adorable curls.

686
01:23:31,249 --> 01:23:33,080
I just thought...
- Chuck it, John!

687
01:23:33,489 --> 01:23:37,277
He calls me John...
- John, we're taking Miss Dorothy out.

688
01:23:37,689 --> 01:23:40,522
And talk her out
of doing mankind such a disservice.

689
01:23:40,929 --> 01:23:44,399
Miss Dorothy, may I take the liberty
of asking you to dine?

690
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:48,087
You may.
- But what about your sweat?

691
01:23:48,489 --> 01:23:51,287
Cancel it.
Swell, just swell.

692
01:23:51,689 --> 01:23:54,283
We'll have dinner, and afterwards
a bit of vaudeville.

693
01:23:54,689 --> 01:23:59,001
That is, if the comics aren't on.
Their humour can get too ribald.

694
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:03,084
I hate for you to cancel your plans
with your gut so edgy.

695
01:24:03,489 --> 01:24:06,561
On the other hand,
it would certainly be fun.

696
01:24:07,369 --> 01:24:11,647
Perfect. Although I'd feel more
comfortable in a suitable frock.

697
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:16,486
We'll be gilding the lily.
But we'll stop by your hotel.

698
01:24:17,369 --> 01:24:18,484
Taxi!

699
01:24:19,329 --> 01:24:24,039
Terrif! My first date
with Trevor Graydon. Come on.

700
01:24:28,649 --> 01:24:30,241
Oh, hi there.

701
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:43,837
Goodness!

702
01:28:52,649 --> 01:28:57,518
Ah, sweet mystery of life,
at last I've found thee.

703
01:28:57,929 --> 01:29:03,686
Oh, I know
it's just the secret of it all.

704
01:29:04,169 --> 01:29:07,320
Oh gosh! Bravo!

705
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:23,367
Raspberry!

706
01:30:23,769 --> 01:30:25,521
My God, it's Muzzy!

707
01:30:31,369 --> 01:30:33,405
What a full life she leads!

708
01:30:36,289 --> 01:30:38,883
Oh, do it again!

709
01:30:39,289 --> 01:30:44,647
I may say, "No, no, no, no, no."
But do it again.

710
01:30:50,049 --> 01:30:54,918
My lips just ache to have you take

711
01:30:55,329 --> 01:30:57,479
the kiss that's waiting for you.

712
01:30:58,769 --> 01:31:00,521
You know if you do

713
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:06,641
you won't regret it.

714
01:31:07,049 --> 01:31:08,562
Come and

715
01:31:08,969 --> 01:31:10,687
get it.

716
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:15,569
Oh, no one is there.

717
01:31:16,289 --> 01:31:19,679
I may cry, "Oh, oh, oh..."

718
01:31:20,089 --> 01:31:23,047
But no one will hear.

719
01:31:23,449 --> 01:31:26,998
My mommy'd scold me,
'cause she told me

720
01:31:27,409 --> 01:31:29,969
it was naughty, but then,

721
01:31:30,369 --> 01:31:33,839
oh, do it again!

722
01:31:34,249 --> 01:31:36,968
Please, do it again!

723
01:32:33,369 --> 01:32:36,406
Searching, searching, searching!

724
01:32:40,369 --> 01:32:43,566
Oh, Muzzy, we just loved you
and the human yo-yo's.

725
01:32:43,969 --> 01:32:45,561
Aren't they the sweetest people?

726
01:32:45,969 --> 01:32:51,407
I was sure the Baron had done
permanent damage to my inner ear.

727
01:32:51,809 --> 01:32:54,687
The Bernini Brothers
have worked miracles.

728
01:32:55,249 --> 01:32:57,888
You were swell, just swell.
- Perfect.

729
01:32:58,289 --> 01:32:59,517
I'm learning.

730
01:33:00,209 --> 01:33:04,043
Hadn't we best be on our way?
Muzzy has to do her practicing.

731
01:33:04,449 --> 01:33:07,805
I'm through for tonight.
You can take just so much yo-yo.

732
01:33:08,289 --> 01:33:11,599
We really must be going.
Tomorrow's a working day.

733
01:33:12,209 --> 01:33:13,881
Good night, Muzzy.

734
01:33:14,729 --> 01:33:16,685
Swell, just swell.

735
01:33:17,089 --> 01:33:18,602
Yes.
- Oh, Millie.

736
01:33:19,009 --> 01:33:22,001
Would you mind assisting me
with these little hooks?

737
01:33:22,409 --> 01:33:25,003
Surely. I'll be right with you kids.

738
01:33:26,369 --> 01:33:28,883
He's divine.
- Thank you.

739
01:33:29,289 --> 01:33:31,962
I'm falling in love with him
like you said was so important.

740
01:33:32,369 --> 01:33:35,805
I had no idea
they were such good friends.

741
01:33:36,209 --> 01:33:39,201
Oh no, they only just met.

742
01:33:46,529 --> 01:33:50,841
Such a baby!
It was his turn to undo me.

743
01:33:53,849 --> 01:33:55,726
That Miss Dorothy!

744
01:33:56,129 --> 01:33:58,802
Great Scot! That Miss Dorothy!

745
01:33:59,209 --> 01:34:02,087
Pretty as a peach
and skin to beat the band.

746
01:34:02,489 --> 01:34:07,165
Perfect little pippin.
- Perfect.

747
01:34:07,569 --> 01:34:10,641
What a dandy little bundle
for a fella to cuddle.

748
01:34:11,489 --> 01:34:12,444
Dandy.

749
01:34:12,929 --> 01:34:17,798
Imagine all that sweetness
in your arms?

750
01:34:20,569 --> 01:34:24,278
I'll type up this survey report.
Original in five?

751
01:34:24,689 --> 01:34:27,044
Don’t forget the dinner reservation
at the Plaza.

752
01:34:27,449 --> 01:34:31,647
Candle-nook room,
quiet corner-table for two.

753
01:34:32,729 --> 01:34:34,959
I think Miss Dorothy’s for the Plaza.

754
01:34:37,449 --> 01:34:39,326
And John... flowers.

755
01:34:40,769 --> 01:34:42,919
There's a florist
just around the corner.

756
01:34:43,329 --> 01:34:45,001
That's using the old bean, John.

757
01:34:45,409 --> 01:34:48,879
Roses... pink... plump...

758
01:34:49,889 --> 01:34:52,278
long-stemmed...

759
01:34:52,689 --> 01:34:54,407
two dozen...

760
01:34:56,249 --> 01:34:58,126
in a vase.

761
01:35:21,529 --> 01:35:28,287
Poor butterfly...

762
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:32,762
'neath the blossoms waiting.

763
01:35:33,169 --> 01:35:37,321
Poor butterfly...

764
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:42,041
for she loved him so.

765
01:35:43,889 --> 01:35:46,926
Plaza Hotel, please.
Candlenook room.

766
01:35:47,329 --> 01:35:51,800
The moments pass into hours.

767
01:35:52,209 --> 01:35:56,600
The hours pass into years.

768
01:35:57,009 --> 01:36:02,527
Mr. Trevor Graydon would like
a quiet corner table for two.

769
01:36:03,529 --> 01:36:05,759
Tonight, 7:30.

770
01:36:06,769 --> 01:36:07,679
Thank you.

771
01:36:08,089 --> 01:36:12,082
And as she smiles through her tears,

772
01:36:12,489 --> 01:36:17,688
she murmurs low,

773
01:36:18,089 --> 01:36:23,322
"The moon and I

774
01:36:23,729 --> 01:36:29,042
know that he be faithful.

775
01:36:29,449 --> 01:36:33,840
I know he'll come to me

776
01:36:34,249 --> 01:36:39,198
by and by."

777
01:36:39,609 --> 01:36:41,167
Flowerbox, please.

778
01:36:41,569 --> 01:36:47,360
"But if he don't come back,

779
01:36:47,769 --> 01:36:51,239
Then I'll never sigh or cry."

780
01:36:51,649 --> 01:36:56,006
Flowerbox? Mr. Trevor Graydon
would like some roses.

781
01:36:56,409 --> 01:37:00,800
2 dozen, long-stemmed, pink.

782
01:37:01,809 --> 01:37:03,288
On the fat side.

783
01:37:03,689 --> 01:37:10,083
I just must die,

784
01:37:11,209 --> 01:37:18,718
poor butterfly.

785
01:37:40,969 --> 01:37:45,520
I run a no-nonsense organization!

786
01:37:47,289 --> 01:37:50,281
I'll step the law on you.
This is not a hayloft!

787
01:37:50,689 --> 01:37:56,685
Besides, she never wants to see you
again. Youth today! Going to hell!

788
01:38:03,729 --> 01:38:07,404
Never wants to see me again.
Banana oil!

789
01:38:58,449 --> 01:38:59,882
Oh, honestly!

790
01:39:01,609 --> 01:39:03,088
Sorry to bother you, but...

791
01:39:06,449 --> 01:39:09,839
What is it you want?
- I'm looking for Millie Dillmount.

792
01:39:10,249 --> 01:39:12,240
She's on the 20th floor.

793
01:39:12,649 --> 01:39:14,128
Oh, thank you!

794
01:39:26,409 --> 01:39:30,766
...14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

795
01:40:26,129 --> 01:40:29,246
Judith Tremaine,
fancy meeting you here!

796
01:41:17,209 --> 01:41:21,361
Jimmy, you crazy kid!
Get in here!

797
01:41:21,769 --> 01:41:23,680
Oh, wait! Wait!

798
01:41:29,569 --> 01:41:32,003
It's stuck!

799
01:41:32,409 --> 01:41:34,843
Push!

800
01:41:35,249 --> 01:41:37,399
1, 2, 3...

801
01:41:42,609 --> 01:41:43,758
Millie?

802
01:41:50,529 --> 01:41:53,043
Millie? You crazy kid!

803
01:41:53,449 --> 01:41:55,326
I fell out.
- Hang on!

804
01:42:06,369 --> 01:42:08,360
Stop!

805
01:42:27,969 --> 01:42:29,721
Oh, there you are, Millie. Good.

806
01:42:33,569 --> 01:42:37,118
Just another first.
Come on, Millie.

807
01:42:41,249 --> 01:42:44,400
Hand over hand.
You're a whiz at it.

808
01:42:44,809 --> 01:42:46,481
Gently now.

809
01:42:58,249 --> 01:42:59,921
I have you.

810
01:43:00,329 --> 01:43:02,081
You're home.

811
01:43:08,089 --> 01:43:09,966
Thank you! Thank you!

812
01:43:14,969 --> 01:43:16,402
Miss Flannery.

813
01:43:23,569 --> 01:43:25,560
Yes?
- Excuse me.

814
01:43:30,369 --> 01:43:34,282
Old elbow said you never wanted
to see me again.

815
01:43:34,689 --> 01:43:36,566
Well, I did say that.

816
01:43:37,569 --> 01:43:41,642
But I am glad to see you.
I was feeling awfully blue.

817
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:43,767
You're a strange bird.

818
01:43:44,529 --> 01:43:48,044
You look different.
- I lost my glasses.

819
01:43:50,929 --> 01:43:54,444
You have nice eyes.
- Catch 'em by candlelight.

820
01:43:54,849 --> 01:43:56,328
Have dinner with me.

821
01:43:57,209 --> 01:44:00,599
Alright, but Dutch treat
at the automat.

822
01:44:02,209 --> 01:44:05,565
I'm leaving my job.
Mr. Graydon isn't available anymore.

823
01:44:06,209 --> 01:44:07,927
Oh, corky!

824
01:44:08,329 --> 01:44:11,605
He's lost his heart
to a friend of ours.

825
01:44:12,009 --> 01:44:13,840
Miss Dorothy?
- How'd you guess?

826
01:44:14,249 --> 01:44:18,367
Who else do we both know? Muzzy?
- Don’t blame Miss Dorothy.

827
01:44:18,769 --> 01:44:21,647
I really don't.
Mr. Graydon neither.

828
01:44:22,049 --> 01:44:26,122
Love swamped them. We're too young
to live a life of hate.

829
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:29,961
You're the one who should be
on the stage. You're good.

830
01:44:31,249 --> 01:44:33,968
You don't seem to care.
- I know.

831
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:37,085
You fickle Freddy.

832
01:44:41,009 --> 01:44:44,001
Thank you!
- You're welcome.

833
01:44:51,449 --> 01:44:52,438
John!

834
01:44:54,289 --> 01:44:57,725
Your ex-lover.
- Coming, Mr. Graydon.

835
01:44:59,929 --> 01:45:04,320
I'll pick you up at seven, and we
aren't dining Dutch treat.

836
01:45:04,729 --> 01:45:10,247
I'm taking you to Park Avenue for
the best-fed picnic ever.

837
01:45:14,729 --> 01:45:17,687
Nothing but the best for my date!

838
01:45:18,849 --> 01:45:21,158
Seven then?
- Seven.

839
01:45:21,569 --> 01:45:23,958
Bye.
- Bye.

840
01:45:33,689 --> 01:45:35,759
Butterfly boy!

841
01:45:37,049 --> 01:45:39,324
I may never go back
to elevators again.

842
01:46:19,689 --> 01:46:23,284
The lights have gone out of you.
- You pulled a switch.

843
01:46:23,689 --> 01:46:28,160
Don’t you think washing dishes at
the most expensive restaurant a lark?

844
01:46:28,569 --> 01:46:30,764
We should have gone to the automat.

845
01:46:31,169 --> 01:46:35,208
It's stealing when a person
doesn't spend accordingly.

846
01:46:35,609 --> 01:46:38,282
With his girlfriends
a person should be honest.

847
01:46:38,689 --> 01:46:43,365
You're a dabbler, playing footloose
and fancy free to everyone,

848
01:46:43,769 --> 01:46:47,603
living moment to moment, never getting
involved, throwing yourself away,

849
01:46:48,009 --> 01:46:51,763
and you could be something...
- Alright, call Miss Dorothy

850
01:46:52,169 --> 01:46:54,478
and ask her to bail us out.
- I'll do no such thing!

851
01:46:54,889 --> 01:46:59,087
She's got the money. She's very rich.
- A fortune hunter to boot!

852
01:46:59,489 --> 01:47:01,480
I'll pay it back.
- In paper clips?

853
01:47:01,889 --> 01:47:05,882
I'm going to call her.
You're not having a lark.

854
01:47:10,729 --> 01:47:13,038
Got a nickel?
- No!

855
01:47:13,449 --> 01:47:16,009
The coffee klatsch
is running out of cups.

856
01:47:16,409 --> 01:47:19,560
I want you to take 'em that tray.

857
01:47:19,969 --> 01:47:22,961
Now, snappy! Hop, hop, hop!

858
01:47:35,729 --> 01:47:38,402
Good evening,
you needed cups?

859
01:47:44,569 --> 01:47:46,082
Over there, honey.

860
01:48:16,449 --> 01:48:19,964
Mr. Graydon, I thought
you were at the Candlenook Room.

861
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:22,246
She stood me up.

862
01:48:22,649 --> 01:48:27,803
I went to the hotel. The lady at
the desk said she'd checked out.

863
01:48:28,209 --> 01:48:29,608
That's it.

864
01:48:30,009 --> 01:48:32,523
No note, no forwarding address.

865
01:48:32,929 --> 01:48:33,918
Nothing.

866
01:48:35,649 --> 01:48:36,968
John, where is she?

867
01:48:37,689 --> 01:48:39,168
I don't know.

868
01:48:39,569 --> 01:48:41,366
How very strange!

869
01:48:43,169 --> 01:48:45,399
I'll get you some more coffee.

870
01:48:48,289 --> 01:48:52,282
Strong spirits!
- Not strong enough.

871
01:48:53,609 --> 01:48:57,488
Just stop this. You'll upset
that lovely system of yours.

872
01:48:58,089 --> 01:49:00,922
Come meet Jimmy.
Perhaps he can figure it out.

873
01:49:01,329 --> 01:49:04,924
Dear Miss Dorothy! Why should she
slip away like that?

874
01:49:06,369 --> 01:49:07,927
Come on.

875
01:49:08,329 --> 01:49:10,923
Dorothy wouldn't leave
without telling anyone her plans.

876
01:49:11,329 --> 01:49:14,127
I spoke to her this afternoon.
- So did I.

877
01:49:14,529 --> 01:49:17,407
Damn. I'm sorry, Millie.
But something's up.

878
01:49:24,689 --> 01:49:26,281
You suspect foul play?
- I don't know.

879
01:49:26,689 --> 01:49:29,328
Could you come up with a jack?
- Good as done.

880
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:34,723
I wanna search her room. Mrs. Meers
isn't telling the whole story. C'mon.

881
01:50:00,409 --> 01:50:04,402
You made it.
- I'm rarely a 2nd-story man.

882
01:50:07,929 --> 01:50:10,489
I'd best call the police in on this.

883
01:50:10,889 --> 01:50:14,768
Miss Brown certainly would have left
a thank-you note for the flowers.

884
01:50:15,169 --> 01:50:18,320
True. I wasn't at the desk
at the time she left.

885
01:50:18,729 --> 01:50:20,526
Let me check once again.

886
01:50:20,929 --> 01:50:22,920
Excuse me.

887
01:50:24,329 --> 01:50:27,082
I'm sure you've searched thoroughly,
and I...

888
01:50:27,489 --> 01:50:30,401
No, no,
the young clerk is so careless.

889
01:50:30,809 --> 01:50:36,441
The letter could be anywhere.
No one takes pride in their work.

890
01:50:48,609 --> 01:50:50,964
Her checkbook.
She can't be far.

891
01:50:51,369 --> 01:50:53,325
And all her clothes.

892
01:50:53,729 --> 01:50:56,960
She checked out without saying a word?
A girl doesn't do that.

893
01:50:57,369 --> 01:51:00,247
Ethel Peace did,
and Fanny did.

894
01:51:00,649 --> 01:51:03,368
Another girl
when I first moved in.

895
01:51:03,769 --> 01:51:07,364
Jimmy, all of them were here
one day and gone the next.

896
01:51:07,769 --> 01:51:09,680
Without a word to anyone...

897
01:51:10,089 --> 01:51:12,080
Except Mrs. Meers.

898
01:51:14,409 --> 01:51:18,118
Mrs. Meers! - Oh drat! Graydon was
supposed to keep her occupied.

899
01:51:18,529 --> 01:51:20,201
Quick, under the bed.

900
01:51:25,369 --> 01:51:26,848
Another first.

901
01:52:08,009 --> 01:52:10,364
Something fearful is happening.

902
01:52:10,769 --> 01:52:12,521
The roses are doped.

903
01:52:16,569 --> 01:52:19,561
The laundry men
have been following Miss Dorothy.

904
01:52:19,969 --> 01:52:24,963
Remember when you met us?
The laundry truck was up the street.

905
01:52:25,369 --> 01:52:27,837
I'm afraid I only saw Dorothy.

906
01:52:28,929 --> 01:52:33,923
The Chinese work for Mrs. Meers.
She's into something big.

907
01:52:34,649 --> 01:52:38,324
What do all the missing girls
have in common? Money?

908
01:52:38,729 --> 01:52:43,598
Ethel Peace didn't have anything, no
family, no friends. Neither did Fanny.

909
01:52:44,009 --> 01:52:48,400
I've forgotten about what's-her-name.
She was all alone, poor thing.

910
01:52:49,689 --> 01:52:54,126
Mrs. Meers said it to Miss Dorothy
when she found out she was an orphan.

911
01:52:54,529 --> 01:52:58,363
What? - "Sad
to be all alone in the world."

912
01:52:58,769 --> 01:53:04,765
Sad for the victim, but convenient
for a vampire like Mrs. Meers.

913
01:53:10,449 --> 01:53:12,201
You think that...
- I do.

914
01:53:12,609 --> 01:53:14,042
You don't mean...
- I'm afraid.

915
01:53:14,449 --> 01:53:16,565
By now she could...
- Yes.

916
01:53:18,969 --> 01:53:21,164
Yes, Millie, true but cruel.

917
01:53:21,569 --> 01:53:25,687
If a girl is all alone and checks out,
who's to question her fate?

918
01:53:26,089 --> 01:53:30,162
But Miss Dorothy’s not alone.
She has us.

919
01:53:54,289 --> 01:53:58,077
That'll be 20, Miss.
- 20? - Cents, money.

920
01:53:58,489 --> 01:53:59,604
Oh, 20.

921
01:54:00,009 --> 01:54:02,842
Another Rockefeller.
What is it with you dames?

922
01:54:03,249 --> 01:54:07,083
Well I seem to have forgotten
my purse.

923
01:54:07,489 --> 01:54:10,367
But well...
- Invest it for me. - Alright.

924
01:54:28,489 --> 01:54:30,480
John, snap to.

925
01:54:31,249 --> 01:54:33,717
Let's get organized.
- Yes, sir.

926
01:54:50,809 --> 01:54:52,322
Any mail for me?

927
01:54:52,729 --> 01:54:55,960
It's too early for mail.
You know that.

928
01:54:56,369 --> 01:54:58,360
Hello, I'm Millie Dillmount.

929
01:54:58,769 --> 01:55:01,158
I'm Mary James. I'm new here.

930
01:55:01,569 --> 01:55:03,560
I hope we'll be friends.

931
01:55:03,969 --> 01:55:06,483
So do I.
I don't know a soul in New York.

932
01:55:06,889 --> 01:55:09,847
I don't know a soul anywhere.
Except at the orphanage.

933
01:55:10,369 --> 01:55:14,044
Oh, sad
to be all alone in the world.

934
01:55:15,489 --> 01:55:18,128
12th floor, dear.
- I'll show you the way.

935
01:55:57,769 --> 01:55:59,043
Pity!

936
01:56:05,409 --> 01:56:09,402
Well, thank you. I'll see you.
- Yes, alright.

937
01:56:31,209 --> 01:56:32,198
Millie?

938
01:56:38,129 --> 01:56:40,438
Oh, isn't Miss Dorothy here?

939
01:56:40,929 --> 01:56:43,762
No, I'm sorry. She's moved.
- Gee, that's too bad.

940
01:56:44,169 --> 01:56:47,047
I wanted to show her
how it turned out.

941
01:56:47,449 --> 01:56:49,804
Apparently just splendid.
- Not bad.

942
01:56:50,209 --> 01:56:52,962
Not bad at all.
- I thought they were fine,

943
01:56:53,369 --> 01:56:56,441
but Dickie likes jazz babies
with fronts.

944
01:56:56,849 --> 01:56:59,522
As soon as that clot proposes,
out comes the cotton.

945
01:57:00,049 --> 01:57:02,040
See you in the shower.

946
01:57:19,929 --> 01:57:21,044
Millie?

947
01:57:23,769 --> 01:57:26,681
Is everything all right?
- Yes, thank you, Mrs. Meers.

948
01:57:27,089 --> 01:57:29,000
This is for you.

949
01:57:29,409 --> 01:57:31,764
I made them up for all you girls.

950
01:57:32,169 --> 01:57:35,878
I can't wait to get acquainted,
not having folks or friends.

951
01:57:36,289 --> 01:57:37,802
Of course.

952
01:57:38,209 --> 01:57:41,406
Now everything seems to be in order.

953
01:57:41,809 --> 01:57:44,562
Envelopes, stationery...

954
01:57:46,569 --> 01:57:48,799
There's a lovely pen
in the drawer, too.

955
01:57:49,209 --> 01:57:53,407
If there's anything else you need
just let me know.

956
01:57:54,089 --> 01:57:56,603
I'll leave now, dear.

957
01:57:57,609 --> 01:58:00,442
So you can relax.

958
01:58:29,289 --> 01:58:30,768
Hey, Graydon.

959
01:58:34,849 --> 01:58:36,760
He's a healthy young animal,

960
01:58:37,169 --> 01:58:39,888
but he has the instincts of
a gentleman. I thought he'd ask me,

961
01:58:40,289 --> 01:58:42,519
but he says, "I'll take a kiss."

962
01:58:42,929 --> 01:58:45,397
I say, "Take a kiss,
and lose a lip."

963
01:58:45,809 --> 01:58:48,039
So he got fresh and lost a lip.

964
01:59:05,409 --> 01:59:09,243
I said, "See you in church"
and turned on the lights.

965
01:59:09,649 --> 01:59:11,640
See you later.
- Yes, bye.

966
01:59:13,089 --> 01:59:16,764
Hey, Zelda.
I got some lips last night.

967
01:59:17,969 --> 01:59:21,757
Hey, take a look at Miss America.
You like it?

968
01:59:43,689 --> 01:59:45,919
I love you, too, you funny nut.

969
01:59:50,729 --> 01:59:51,878
Jimmy?

970
01:59:52,889 --> 01:59:55,881
Jimmy, you're not pretending.

971
02:00:01,249 --> 02:00:03,205
Mr. Graydon!

972
02:00:08,529 --> 02:00:11,248
Jimmy! Come on! Come on!

973
02:00:30,969 --> 02:00:35,963
She's not much, but a little dark
corner on the late, late shift.

974
02:01:24,569 --> 02:01:27,129
Mr. Graydon,
Jimmy's in the laundry basket.

975
02:01:28,449 --> 02:01:30,121
The laundry men.

976
02:01:31,489 --> 02:01:33,047
Mr. Graydon!

977
02:01:38,369 --> 02:01:41,361
I must speak to the Buddha.
Mrs. Meers.

978
02:02:17,249 --> 02:02:19,444
Act like nothing happened.
Don’t look now.

979
02:02:19,849 --> 02:02:24,969
You see that laundry truck?
Follow it.

980
02:02:27,449 --> 02:02:30,122
Mr. Graydon,
you're letting it get away.

981
02:02:31,849 --> 02:02:35,558
Mr. Graydon! ...Oh, Jimmy!

982
02:02:35,969 --> 02:02:37,800
Buddha? Meers here.

983
02:02:38,809 --> 02:02:44,805
In front of the hotel, a dark man
in a red roadster. Remove him.

984
02:02:51,369 --> 02:02:52,722
No!

985
02:02:58,849 --> 02:02:59,838
Now.

986
02:03:01,489 --> 02:03:02,968
That's the starter.

987
02:03:06,249 --> 02:03:08,126
That's the gas.

988
02:03:08,529 --> 02:03:10,520
There's the break.

989
02:03:12,289 --> 02:03:13,608
I hope.

990
02:03:14,689 --> 02:03:16,168
Stop!

991
02:03:16,569 --> 02:03:18,764
Stop! Millie!

992
02:03:19,889 --> 02:03:21,242
Taxi! Stop!

993
02:03:21,889 --> 02:03:22,958
Taxi!

994
02:03:25,209 --> 02:03:26,403
Just another first.

995
02:05:29,849 --> 02:05:34,877
I... beg your pardon. I'm looking
for a young man wearing a dress.

996
02:06:36,089 --> 02:06:37,204
Jimmy!

997
02:06:37,809 --> 02:06:38,798
Jimmy?

998
02:06:40,729 --> 02:06:42,879
Oh, Jimmy, darling.

999
02:06:45,529 --> 02:06:48,407
Jimmy, wake up, dear.

1000
02:08:09,729 --> 02:08:13,688
But I don't have a nickel.
Not even my checkbook.

1001
02:08:14,089 --> 02:08:18,765
Borrow? I believe you've
never been in a Chinese opium den.

1002
02:08:22,369 --> 02:08:23,927
Oh dear!

1003
02:08:54,489 --> 02:08:57,242
Dorothy!
- Miss Dorothy!

1004
02:09:00,889 --> 02:09:01,878
Help!

1005
02:09:02,889 --> 02:09:05,039
Somebody, please! Help!

1006
02:09:05,449 --> 02:09:07,679
Miss Dorothy!
- Help!

1007
02:09:08,089 --> 02:09:09,568
Miss Dorothy!

1008
02:09:22,729 --> 02:09:25,038
Miss Dorothy!

1009
02:09:26,049 --> 02:09:27,038
Jimmy!

1010
02:09:36,969 --> 02:09:40,120
Untie the others.
Hide until the police come.

1011
02:09:47,169 --> 02:09:50,445
I'm Millie Dillmount. Have you seen
2 Chinese and a girl?

1012
02:09:50,849 --> 02:09:56,082
A boy? A very tall girl? Miss Dorothy?
She's lovely with brown curls.

1013
02:09:56,489 --> 02:09:59,640
Yes, they're over there.
- Good. Help me untie the others!

1014
02:10:03,329 --> 02:10:07,402
Miss Dorothy!
Did they have their way with you?

1015
02:10:07,969 --> 02:10:09,880
Well, really! Millie!

1016
02:10:11,209 --> 02:10:14,838
My beauty spot!
Don’t tell me you weren't busy.

1017
02:10:15,569 --> 02:10:17,161
Where is he?

1018
02:10:17,569 --> 02:10:18,922
Come on!

1019
02:10:19,689 --> 02:10:22,044
Faster!

1020
02:10:23,009 --> 02:10:26,638
Hope he won't be an addict
with all that dope.

1021
02:10:27,049 --> 02:10:29,404
It didn't hurt Sleeping Beauty
or Snow White.

1022
02:10:37,689 --> 02:10:39,168
That way.

1023
02:10:43,809 --> 02:10:45,800
Put him in the rumble seat.

1024
02:10:51,489 --> 02:10:52,558
Trevor.

1025
02:10:52,969 --> 02:10:55,039
Front seat's taken.

1026
02:11:00,209 --> 02:11:01,608
Hey, money bags!

1027
02:11:14,649 --> 02:11:16,640
That's the gas...

1028
02:11:21,489 --> 02:11:24,526
No, forward, dear.
- I know.

1029
02:11:24,929 --> 02:11:29,525
Oh, it's Mrs. Meers.
Maybe she'd like a lift.

1030
02:11:40,889 --> 02:11:42,880
Get in!

1031
02:11:44,529 --> 02:11:46,645
After them!

1032
02:11:54,169 --> 02:11:56,558
Snap to! Let's get organized!

1033
02:12:06,049 --> 02:12:11,248
Aha, heading for Long Island
and their rich society friends.

1034
02:12:11,649 --> 02:12:15,358
The four-hundreds
could be missing a few.

1035
02:12:20,049 --> 02:12:22,847
My God, you two are dreary.

1036
02:12:27,169 --> 02:12:30,047
Your adventure sends a chill
over my heart.

1037
02:12:30,449 --> 02:12:33,998
To think of such ungentlemanly
behaviour in my darling New York.

1038
02:12:34,489 --> 02:12:38,607
Millie, I lift my glass
in humble tribute.

1039
02:12:39,009 --> 02:12:42,285
A miracle the way
you rebuffed those fatheads.

1040
02:12:42,809 --> 02:12:45,448
Everyone of them must die.

1041
02:12:46,249 --> 02:12:48,558
How do you thank a hero?

1042
02:12:48,969 --> 02:12:52,848
I saved you selfishly
for myself.

1043
02:12:57,729 --> 02:13:01,438
First that interfering
Dillmount girl!

1044
02:13:09,009 --> 02:13:11,569
Shall we join the others? Please.

1045
02:13:17,529 --> 02:13:19,724
Shall we join the others?

1046
02:13:25,649 --> 02:13:26,525
Good evening.

1047
02:13:31,449 --> 02:13:33,360
Raspberry.

1048
02:14:17,169 --> 02:14:18,568
Wonderful!

1049
02:14:43,889 --> 02:14:44,705
Perfect!

1050
02:14:53,569 --> 02:14:54,558
Me?

1051
02:14:56,009 --> 02:14:58,569
Please, don't think this frivolous.

1052
02:16:14,129 --> 02:16:15,005
Perfect!

1053
02:16:16,969 --> 02:16:18,960
Muzzy, honestly, you were...

1054
02:16:19,489 --> 02:16:22,242
My law instructors are arriving.

1055
02:16:23,849 --> 02:16:25,487
My rock.

1056
02:16:28,089 --> 02:16:31,081
Sad to be all alone in the world.

1057
02:16:50,009 --> 02:16:51,601
Oh, Jimmy, darling.

1058
02:17:25,609 --> 02:17:27,600
Get in here, Muzzy, you...

1059
02:17:39,929 --> 02:17:41,601
Muzzy, too?

1060
02:17:42,729 --> 02:17:46,438
Sure, you wanna join me?
And my sister and my stepmother.

1061
02:17:47,649 --> 02:17:50,641
Sister, stepmother?
- Though she's not old enough to be.

1062
02:17:54,169 --> 02:17:58,367
I've been blind.
- No, Jimmy is like his father.

1063
02:17:58,769 --> 02:18:02,159
He didn't look like a real
multi-millionaire either.

1064
02:18:02,929 --> 02:18:06,524
You're not in paper clips?
- That's not far from the truth.

1065
02:18:06,929 --> 02:18:09,079
The fortune was founded in steel.

1066
02:18:10,409 --> 02:18:12,969
Oh, I don't understand.

1067
02:18:13,849 --> 02:18:18,843
Judith Tremaine chased Jimmy, and
every fortune hunter chased Dorothy.

1068
02:18:19,249 --> 02:18:22,400
I sent the children out
into the real world

1069
02:18:22,809 --> 02:18:26,404
with high hopes they'd come back
with sweet partners. And they did.

1070
02:18:26,809 --> 02:18:31,405
Your father would be so proud of you.
Jimmy, off with the mask.

1071
02:18:31,969 --> 02:18:35,962
James van Hosmere, 1st Vice President
of Van Hosmere Worldwide Enterprises.

1072
02:18:41,689 --> 02:18:45,079
You do have nice eyes.
- Be my stenog?

1073
02:18:45,969 --> 02:18:49,518
I don't want to be your equal.
I want to be a woman,

1074
02:18:49,929 --> 02:18:54,047
a dandy little bundle to cuddle.
You think Miss Dorothy has curls?

1075
02:18:54,449 --> 02:18:56,041
You wait.

1076
02:19:00,649 --> 02:19:02,128
What's the final word, Tea?

1077
02:19:02,569 --> 02:19:06,642
I've been watching her most close.
I approve.

1078
02:19:07,369 --> 02:19:09,280
A good old-fashion girl.

1079
02:19:12,609 --> 02:19:16,727
Tea practically raised me.
So that does it. Almost.

1080
02:19:31,569 --> 02:19:34,208
What do you want
for a wedding present?

1081
02:19:34,609 --> 02:19:36,440
A checkbook.

1082
02:19:36,849 --> 02:19:40,205
Rich people can nickel
and dime me to death.

1083
02:19:43,689 --> 02:19:46,681
Swell.
- Just swell.

1084
02:19:49,969 --> 02:19:54,440
Oh, this is my...
what do you teach?

1085
02:19:54,849 --> 02:19:58,000
Like a squirrel,
storing the nuts of life.

1086
