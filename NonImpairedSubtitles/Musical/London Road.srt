1
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:46,407
Come here.
We can talk better there.

2
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,333
I don't mind giving interviews and things
like that. That doesn't bother me at all.

3
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,074
Erm... there's quite a few people
that I know that wouldn't, but I said,

4
00:00:57,114 --> 00:00:58,702
"if you don't get
your point of view across,

5
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:01,832
"they label us something that we're not."

6
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,496
Yes, erm, yes.

7
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:18,704
Well, I don't know
if I can help you at all, but...

8
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,619
Can I get you a drink?
Erm, I've got orange juice or...

9
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:24,243
A cup of tea I'd like.

10
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:28,410
Or... What have we got?
Orange juice or...

11
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:32,866
- Cranberry juice?
- Cranberry juice. Yes?

12
00:01:32,987 --> 00:01:34,706
It's light.

13
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,664
Please sit down.

14
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,830
Gotta go cos me pie's going.
- Yeah, OK. Yeah.

15
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:54,660
- Yeah, because I'm, I'm cooking.
- Come talk to me.

16
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:56,615
We're expecting people.

17
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:02,199
OK. Ask away.

and very unsure of everything

58
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:03,648
It was sort of six years ago

59
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:07,906
when Portman Road
started expanding its football team.

60
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:10,818
And a new stadium went up that...

61
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:14,314
That prostitutes seemed
to come up this way.

62
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:16,653
We had reported the prostitutes.

63
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:21,025
I confronted one. "Get out of my road!
I'll call the police!"

64
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,864
- Well, I...
- She said, "Call the police." And I did.

65
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:26,322
Their whole attitude with us...

66
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:31,856
...makes it really hard for me
to have much sympathy

67
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,613
for, you know, what happened.

68
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:38,067
We had a girl at the bottom of me drive.
She's in the car.

69
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:42,357
She said, "Do you mind
sort of moving off?" I said, "Just..."

70
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:44,694
I swore at her, I admit.

71
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,979
Anyway, saying, like,
"if you keep on at me,

72
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,602
"I'm gonna sort of get my pimp
to burn your house down."

73
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,109
I know what you're up to. If I see you
here again, I'm gonna call the police.

74
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,020
It was... it was absolutely awful.

75
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,319
They wrecked...
wrecked our, my evenings.

76
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,189
You know, they're on my streets.

77
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:12,194
You know, my children are out at night.

78
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,271
I've got, I've got a teenage girl.

79
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:16,194
I've got, I've got a 14-year old.

80
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:20,315
I don't want girls...
erm... doing what they did in the streets.

81
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:24,193
And they weren't just...
getting in people's cars.

82
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:27,022
They were doing it in the alleyways
and everything else.

83
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,233
They certainly weren't angels.

84
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:38,776
Lots of them talking about them
being lovely girls and everything,

85
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:42,980
but in all our experience
they were... foul-mouthed slags

86
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,480
who'd stab you as quick as...

87
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,279
- That's an exaggeration.
- It's a slight exaggeration.

88
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:48,779
They did pester you.

89
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,479
They'd rob you
as much as anything else.

90
00:06:50,517 --> 00:06:51,903
Yeah.

91
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,267
No, because people,
kerb crawlers,

92
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,435
sort of upset people's children, you know.

93
00:06:57,475 --> 00:07:00,153
Daughters and things.
And then there's the girls.

94
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:03,187
I mean, you coming back from football
and things like that.

95
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:06,851
He was always being sort
of propositioned, you know. Sort of.

96
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,396
Poor old sod!

97
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:14,188
It's been like this for years,
but I don't want my children to see that.

98
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:17,234
We all wanted to move.
We didn't want to be here.

99
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,525
Then these girls...
just going missing

100
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:24,148
and... and being found
the way they... they were found.

101
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:27,104
It was a complete nightmare.

102
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:30,228
It's the most wonderful time

103
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,518
Oh, the most wonderful time

104
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:37,776
Oh,
the most wonderful time

105
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:41,813
Of the year

106
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:45,308
Everyone is very, very nervous... erm

107
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,601
And very unsure of everything

108
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,358
Basically

109
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:52,399
The most wonderful time...

110
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,933
Everyone is very, very nervous... erm

111
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:58,983
And very unsure of everything

112
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:01,269
Basically

113
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,234
There was a LOT of fear
from a LOT of people.

114
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:09,723
I think it's the biggest thing
that's ever... ever happened in Ipswich.

115
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:16,270
It's... erm...
Definitely changed the mood

116
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,686
It's quite, erm...

117
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:24,476
It's quite an unpleasant feeling because
You find that I'm walking through thinking

118
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:26,065
"Well, is it him? Is it him?"

119
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:32,062
Yeah, I think it's put Ipswich
On the map

120
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,229
For the wrong reasons, unfortunately

121
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,602
It's the most wonderful time...

122
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:39,514
Everyone's very, very nervous... erm

123
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:42,481
Erm, we're not actually selling
It's actually free

In Ipswich recently

128
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,311
Everyone is very, very nervous... erm

00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:57,141
Either a policeman or a lawyer.

157
00:10:57,174 --> 00:10:59,675
We hoped it was an immigrant,
from nish-noff land.

158
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:03,591
- If it is, there'll be an uproar.
- And we'll send the fuckers all back.

159
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:08,767
No, l-l-I'm not like that. I'm sure
you're not really like that deep clown.

160
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:11,975
I fucking am.
I reckon it's one Polish bastard.

161
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,092
We'll fucking have him.

162
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:28,215
- You automatically think it could be him.
- Yeah.

163
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:30,674
That's the scary thing.
That he could be amongst us.

164
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:33,595
Walking around us every day
and we don't know.

165
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:35,965
Yeah!

166
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:38,140
- It could be anyone in here.
- Yeah.

167
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:41,018
Which has now really scared me
now I'm thinking about it!

168
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,469
I'm just gonna, like, cry!

169
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,801
But they do say it's somebody.
Either a policeman or a lawyer.

170
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:05,095
Or a priest!

171
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,804
This was on the radio.
Always utter rubbish on Suffolk Radio.

172
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:13,342
Well, we've never had
anything like that before. No.

173
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,843
We're all a bit... frightened
to go out at night. Yeah.

174
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,339
But then we are anyway.

175
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:25,683
Some people say that
they're terrified of going anywhere.

176
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:28,178
Well, goodness me, there's a...

177
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:30,465
There's a mass murderer on the loose.

178
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:32,755
A psychopath. On the loose.

179
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,047
H. II.

180
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:38,504
It's as though somebody's
chucked acid over you

181
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,300
and you can feel it all over you.

182
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:43,177
It's... Standing here, you can feel it.

183
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,013
We're all guilty.

184
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:48,139
No, we're not.
No, we're not. No, we're not!

185
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,093
Just one person is or whatever ends up
being the final tally, but...

186
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:53,799
No, we're not.

187
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:57,344
The rest of us are s... are sane.

188
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,053
You automatically think it could be him

189
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,129
Yeah

190
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:04,346
You automatically think it could be him

191
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:06,795
That's the scary thing
That he could be amongst us

192
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:10,047
And look walking around with us
Every day and we don't know

193
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:11,887
Yeah

194
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,005
We don't know

195
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:20,796
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here

196
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:22,554
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here

197
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:26,888
Like, anyone, it could be anyone in here
For all we know

198
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,135
Which has scared me
Now I'm thinking about it

199
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,467
- I'm just gonna, like, cry
- Ha-ha!

200
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:34,962
You automatically think it could be him

201
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:39,387
You automatically think it could be him
It could be him

202
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:51,422
Erm... well, some serial killer
Seems to be on the loose

203
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,463
<i>prostitutes in this area</i>

204
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,753
Prostitutes from in the Ipswich area

205
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,262
And they've been found dead, naked

206
00:13:57,293 --> 00:14:00,421
In various different areas
Surrounding Ipswich

207
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:03,173
One ten minutes away from my house
Which is scary

208
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,503
And it was found on the body on the land
Of a girl that goes to my school

209
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:07,798
- So that's a bit scary
- Yeah

210
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,963
I used to go out every Friday and
Saturday night and I don't go out any more

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,551
It's not safe for young girls and women
Out in Ipswich any more

212
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:16,875
- It's not safe
- Yeah

213
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:20,425
It's not safe for young girls and women
Out in Ipswich any more

214
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,928
- It's not safe
- Yeah

215
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,919
As it used to be

216
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,803
It's quite scary to think
How the world's come to this

217
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,511
You automatically think it could be him

218
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,714
Yeah

219
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:33,298
You automatically think it could be him

220
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,882
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here

221
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:41,842
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here for all we know

222
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:43,675
Which has now really scared me

223
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,426
I'm just gonna, like, cry...

224
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,294
Ha-ha!

225
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:50,509
You automatically think it could be him

226
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,591
You automatically think it could be him

227
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,549
It could be him

228
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:57,758
Something like this happens
And you realise that there's so much

229
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,215
So many things that are bad in the world
That's the fire alarm

230
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,421
We're all going to die...

231
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:05,088
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

232
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:16,293
- But it's exciting
- Cos nothing ever happens in Ipswich

233
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:19,211
This is the first bit
Of local scandal we've ever had

234
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:23,005
Being girls, gossip mongers
We're like, "it's quite exciting"

235
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,670
- It's quite exciting
- Yeah, yeah

236
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:28,088
You automatically think it could be him

237
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,047
You automatically think it could be him

238
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:32,123
Yeah

239
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:33,799
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here

240
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,591
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here for all we know

241
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:40,000
Which has now really scared me
I'm just gonna, like, cry

242
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:41,508
Hah, hah. yeah

243
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:42,878
It could be anyone here

244
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:44,833
Which has now really soared me
Now I'm thinking about it

245
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:47,503
I'm just gonna, like, cry
Ha-ha

246
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:50,671
You automatically think it could be him

247
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,622
You automatically think it could be him
It could be him

248
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:03,665
You automatically think it could be him

249
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:04,712
Yeah

250
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,507
You automatically think it could be him

251
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:10,584
That's the scary thing
That he could be amongst us

252
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,666
Walking around with us every day
And we're... we don't know

253
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:14,830
Yeah

254
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:17,296
We don't know

255
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,379
You've got this feeling of suspicious
by everybody.

256
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:27,001
Upon everybody else.

257
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:30,663
Is it him? Is it him?

258
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:34,164
Is it him? Is it him? I dunno.

259
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,124
Yeah.

260
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,661
London Road, please.

261
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:50,253
'And of course there are reports
the Met is closing on potential suspects.

262
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:53,047
'Although police
won't be drawn on the exact figure,

263
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,705
'it's thought there are around 5O people
they're very interested in talking to.'

264
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,584
It's, it's hard to find to fathom out.

265
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,918
Anybody doing it, really, isn't it?

266
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:06,501
Wha, wha, what was their motive behind
it?

267
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:09,746
Were there signs of this type
of behaviour? It just...

268
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:12,996
He's a white male aged between 23 and 47

269
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,873
He'll live in the local area

270
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:20,833
He would have been fascinated
Absolutely fascinated

271
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:23,796
With murders in his younger youth...

272
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:27,830
'Silent night

273
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,670
He would have tortured animals

274
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:31,751
Up till his mid-teens as well

275
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,545
Then he'd have had a number
Of numerous relationships

276
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,377
Up until he was about 25, 26

277
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,910
They'll have been failed
He's probably been married

278
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,669
Lives on his own but with a partner

279
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:47,536
And he'll definitely
Definitely, definitely

280
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:49,412
Know all the victims

281
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:53,790
Apart from one... realistically

282
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:56,326
And that'll have been his one
That he mucked up on

283
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,497
Cos the other ones
Would have been fine with going with him

284
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:03,794
And it's probably why he strangled her?

285
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:05,959
Because she panicked...

286
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:11,621
'Virgin mother and child...

287
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:19,873
It's, it's hard to fathom out
anybody doing it, really, isn't it?

288
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,167
Wha, wha, what was
their motive behind it? it just...

289
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:26,872
It just...

290
00:18:26,991 --> 00:18:33,247
l-I-I've studied serial killers
Since in my mid-teens

291
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:35,036
And it doesn't mean I'm... I am one

292
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,578
But, er...

293
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,085
Oh, right.

294
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:40,201
Just find it interesting

295
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:43,748
But, but, as I say, you know
Just to emphasise

296
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:47,657
It doesn't make me a serial killer so...

297
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:50,163
Gives me a bit of the shudders

298
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:51,584
Quite honestly

299
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:54,957
'... in heavenly peace...'

300
00:18:57,406 --> 00:19:01,282
His failed relationships will be
Because he became violent when drunk

301
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:03,331
Actually, he'll be an alcoholic

302
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:05,907
Or he'll have trouble
With substance abuse as well

303
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:10,289
And also in the last... last six weeks

304
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:14,624
Actually, about the last
Two... two months approximately

305
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:16,659
He'd have probably quit his job

306
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:19,283
Or he'd be off sick

307
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,286
Or to that effect... he, er...
He, he'll be a local in the local pubs

308
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:27,905
He'll be a bit of a loner

309
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,992
But, erm, that's it, spot on who he is

310
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,914
I guarantee it...

311
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:39,824
'Holy infant
so tender and mild...

312
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:42,908
- It's horrifying, isn't it?
- Yeah

313
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:48,279
l-I-I've studied serial killers
Since in my mid-teens

314
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,538
And it doesn't mean I'm... I am one

315
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:53,664
- But, er...
- Oh, right

316
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:56,244
Just, er, find it interesting

317
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,158
But, but as I say, you know
Just to emphasise

318
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:02,704
It doesn't make me a serial killer so...

319
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,909
It gives me a bit of the shudders
Quite honestly

320
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:41,370
Er, for each girl there was a team,

321
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:44,413
a different team,
and they all questioned us.

322
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:46,826
And it... it was getting awful.

323
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,819
We were so getting fed up
with just being asked, you know.

324
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:54,403
They were asking if you had nose hair.

325
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:56,120
Ear hair.

326
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:59,991
Wha... wha... Goodness knows
why they wanted to know that.

327
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:06,612
Police kept issuing these strange things
about what you should and shouldn't do,

328
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:10,527
but they never said, "Don't be a
prostitute and get into a stranger's car,"

329
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:13,329
which was the obvious thing, really,
wasn't it?

330
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:16,239
Cos everyone else was quite safe
walking the streets.

331
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,863
We assumed particularly when, I mean,
it was just prostitutes he seemed to be...

332
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:23,077
Murdering.

333
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:27,911
When they did the house
questions, you know, that was really...

334
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:29,661
I thought
he was gonna be arrested.

335
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:34,113
There was a knock on the door. Terry said,
"You're wanted. In the lounge. Police."

336
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:38,405
He was doing every house.
Every single house in London Road.

337
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:42,696
Er, your mind goes blank. "Where was
you on Monday night?" sort of thing.

338
00:21:42,816 --> 00:21:47,532
Can't remember exactly the date. And you
think, "Well, where was I'? What did I do?"

339
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:51,786
Then he said, "What colour...? Have you
got blue eyes?" I said yes I think.

340
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:52,906
Yeah, you said yes.

341
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:55,868
Then he said,
"Have you got a hairy chest?"

342
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:59,858
And I looked at him and thought,
you know, "Where is this leading to?"

343
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:29,740
I got up and all I could see
were police cars going up the road

344
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,285
And of course, you know

345
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:33,152
I, we knew

346
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:36,151
Obviously it was in charge of, you know

347
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,732
Something to do with these poor girls

348
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:41,366
That's it...

349
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:44,443
And that's when it all started
it all kicked off

350
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:53,114
Well, I got woken up by the telephone
Me son rung me on his mo...

351
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:55,612
On, on my home phone
I said, "Where are you?"

352
00:22:55,731 --> 00:22:58,941
He said, "I'm down the road but you need
To tell the police that I'm your son"

353
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:00,817
I said, "Why? What have you done?"

354
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,898
And that's when it all started
it all kicked off

355
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:09,944
He said, "No, no, no
We're not allowed down the road"

356
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:13,690
And lo and behold there was police
There was cameras, there was my son

357
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:15,780
It all started
It all kicked off

358
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,283
You looked up the road
And it's all you saw

359
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,861
Was like a tented, a tented area

360
00:23:20,604 --> 00:23:22,820
You looked up the road
And it's all you saw

361
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:25,900
Was like a tented, a tented area

362
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,652
And outside number 79

363
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,023
And outside number 79

364
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:34,862
You looked up the road
And it's all you saw

365
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:37,361
Was like a tented, a tented area

366
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,695
You looked up the road
And it's all you saw

367
00:23:39,812 --> 00:23:42,278
Was like a tented, a tented area

368
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:45,694
And outside number 79

369
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:49,523
And outside number 79

370
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:53,526
And I thought, "Oh, no
There's another prostitute been found"

371
00:23:56,436 --> 00:24:00,395
I got up
And all I could see were police cars

372
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:02,191
going up the road

373
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:06,779
And of course, you know
I, we knew

374
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:08,979
Obviously it was in charge of, you know

375
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:12,231
Something to do with these poor girls

376
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:13,656
But, erm...

377
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:19,362
But, erm, that's when it all started

378
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:20,983
It all kicked off

379
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:26,566
I got up
And all I could see were police cars

380
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:28,025
going up the road

381
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,822
And of course, you know
I, we knew

382
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:36,649
Obviously it was in charge of, you know
Something to do with these poor girls

383
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,688
But, erm...

384
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:42,227
And that's when it started
It all kicked off

385
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:45,030
And didn't we...?

386
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:47,027
Then we started hearing on the news

387
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:52,192
That someone had been arrested there
Or someone had been arrested

388
00:24:52,935 --> 00:24:56,312
And so we just put
Two and two together and said

389
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,487
"I think they've just arrested
Our next-door neighbour

390
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:04,903
I got up
And all I could see were police cars

391
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,688
going up the road

392
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,938
And of course, you know
I, we knew

393
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:15,267
Obviously it was in charge of, you know
Something to do with these poor girls

394
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:17,903
But, erm...

395
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:35,193
This is London Road. This is
where the second suspect was arrested.

396
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:36,564
So I think Steve Wright.

397
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,151
Oi...
Oi!

398
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:40,316
Oi!

399
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:43,150
Right, you want me
to talk into that at the beginning?

400
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:47,105
They're not very happy
about the... intrusion.

401
00:25:54,265 --> 00:25:56,517
<i>Sorry'?</i>

402
00:26:15,765 --> 00:26:17,518
Sam?

403
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:23,900
- No!
- Stand back!

404

The white tent...'

405
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:12,102
Oh, we're inside there.
All a little bit weird.

406
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:15,313
'Next door there's
the concerned residents looking on.'

407
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,977
- Please, further back.
- Keep rolling, Seb. Keep rolling.

I'm coming or going round this area!

You're not allowed
through that bit basically.

Have you got the man that done it then?

433
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:10,602
- They won't even tell us.
- Won't they? I know the girls.

Mind you, flippin' half the town,
if you were to pull 'em in,

probably went with them girls.

- No!

to a little scaggy little whore.

No. Anyway, looks like my relief's
turned up, so I'm gonna get a coffee.

- OK. And you.

441
00:29:40,132 --> 00:29:43,592
I think it was policing
as we'd like to see it every time.

the Prime Minister, wouldn't you?

444
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:54,468
Yeah. The road was ever so quiet and
nobody stole our festive wreath this year.

Yeah.

00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,182
'and Chris, talk us
what we're expecting to happen.

462
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:52,300
'The building over here is just
the main police station in Ipswich,

463
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:56,930
'but it is this very dull and drab,
ominous building,

464
00:30:56,962 --> 00:31:01,181
'which is the Magistrates Court
and which will be the focal point,

465
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:04,306
The center of attention
for at least the next hour

466
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:08,338
'T-T-This is now the moment
that Steven Wright faces the charges,

467
00:31:08,378 --> 00:31:12,930
'if formally charged with
these five murders of the five women.'

468
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:18,635
All of this happened quite suddenly.

469
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,720
A very dramatic announcement
last night, late last night,

470
00:31:22,836 --> 00:31:25,763
that Steven Wright was charged
with these five murders.

471
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,554
I've been here since about half-nine

472
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:41,006
I just saw him come along
Like, with the police sirens and that

473
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:43,130
And they were, you know

474
00:31:44,627 --> 00:31:46,844
None of the photographers caught him

475
00:31:48,627 --> 00:31:51,554
Caught any photos of him
Or anything but...

476
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:55,712
Just waiting to get a glimpse, really

477
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:57,803
Just waiting to get a glimpse, really

478
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:01,841
His name is Steven Wright.
He's 48. He's a fork-lift truck driver.

479
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,549
He's from London Road in Ipswich.

480
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:05,090
That's pretty well it.

481
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:08,386
I tell you, if I get hold of him...
huh,huh,huh!

482
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:12,294
I really...
I've never seen anything like it.

483
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:16,920
I said to my brother
I said, "What's going on?"

484
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,548
I said, "What's happened?"

485
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:23,005
He says, he says, "Cos the bloke"

486
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:27,261
He said
"He's in court this morning, isn't he?"

487
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:32,258
And then when I came up here I thought
"Oh, my word! Am I gonna get parked?"

488
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,053
Cos they've taken
All the spaces along here

489
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:36,886
Oh, dear?

490
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,762
- Yeah, look at this, look at this
- It's horrible, innit, eh?

491
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:44,133
It's a wicked bloody world

492
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:45,886
Yeah, look at this, look at this

493
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,050
It's horrible, innit, eh?

494
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,217
It's a wicked bloody world...

495
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,501
I'm just hearing some sirens, actually,

496
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,959
and as he's gonna come
from this direction,

497
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,465
we'll just turn our camera round that way.

498
00:32:58,582 --> 00:33:02,719
So that we do actually see this convoy
when it happens. Turn round this way.

499
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:05,547
They're obviously on the verge
Of bringing him out

500
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:07,550
Cos the position the cars are in

501
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:11,043
The position, the cars, the police
They're all in position, look

502
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:14,258
They're obviously on the verge
Of bringing him out

503
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,086
Cos the position the cars are in

504
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:18,292
The position, the cars, the police
They're all in position, look

505
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,041
You look around and you think
"Well, you know"

506
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:24,085
"Have they got the right...?"

507
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:27,252
He said
"He's in court this morning, isn't he?"

508
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,005
And then when I came up here
I thought, "Oh, my word!"

509
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:35,088
- The position of the cars, the police
- ...spaces along here

510
00:33:35,206 --> 00:33:36,462
Hello...

511
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:41,132
Police motorbikes coming up the road,
not from the direction we were expecting,

512
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:42,966
so I imagine it's not the convoy.

513
00:33:42,997 --> 00:33:44,633
<i>They're closing in...</i>

514
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:46,039
It might be, actually.

515
00:33:46,622 --> 00:33:48,293
They're closing in

516
00:33:48,456 --> 00:33:50,257
He's obviously coming out...

517
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:51,462
I think it is.

518
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:53,963
They're closing in
That's why the police

519
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:56,249
I could see them stopping traffic
Up there an' all

520
00:33:56,288 --> 00:33:57,461
Oh, dear

521
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:01,212
Yeah, look at this, look at this
It's horrible, innit, eh?

522
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,957
It's a wicked bloody world

523
00:34:06,164 --> 00:34:08,665
It looks like we've got Steven Wright now.

524
00:34:09,996 --> 00:34:14,168
And here we have full convoy near!
Steven Wright!

525
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:16,622
'48-year-old fork-lift truck driver.'

526
00:34:21,747 --> 00:34:23,298
Fucking bastard!

527
00:34:25,788 --> 00:34:27,707
You piece of shit!

528
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:29,381
You're fucking dead!

529
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:30,882
Yeah, look at this, look at this

530
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:33,045
It's horrible, innit, eh? It's horrible

531
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:36,090
It's a wicked bloody world

532
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,756
Yeah, look at this, look at this

533
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,419
It's horrible, innit, eh?
It's horrible, innit, eh?

534
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:44,044
It's a wicked bloody
It's a wicked bloody, it's a wicked bloody

535
00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:47,337
It's a wicked bloody world!

536
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,288
Bloody hell!

537
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:54,338
Couldn't see. Couldn't see.

538
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:57,624
- I don't think he was in that van.
- He was.

539
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,830
He's definitely in the back of the van.

540
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:04,038
- Waste of time, wasn't it?
- It's a disgrace.

541
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:28,782
Oi. Hey! Get away then!

542
00:37:49,863 --> 00:37:51,949
We're really upset

543
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:58,991
I just wanted him...
It to be all over

544
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:01,281
And to know

545
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:07,703
Were tho... were those prostitutes
Killed in that house?

546
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:12,781
He was only there for ten weeks

547
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,539
Ten weeks

548
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:17,621
He was only there for ten weeks

549
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:19,656
Ten weeks

550
00:38:19,696 --> 00:38:25,289
It's just a chance
The one place in the... in the whole world

551
00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:29,949
Where... he went to live for ten weeks

552
00:38:30,695 --> 00:38:32,117
Could have been anywhere

553
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:34,571
Could have been next door to you

554
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:36,947
Could have been next door to you

555
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:42,074
Everybody would rather it all went away

556
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:45,494
They must have sleepless nights

557
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:47,033
I know I do

558
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:51,324
It was awful. I was very upset.

559
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:56,487
In the evening, you know,
I'd just close the curtains and erm...

560
00:38:57,403 --> 00:39:01,279
It really made me very depressed and low.
I just feel it's...

561
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:03,909
- I think there's a...
- It's like a dream still.

562
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:07,038
I, I don't know.
I don't think I've really...

563
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:09,202
- I think...
- Really come to accept it.

564
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:14,699
I... try to... keep going.

565
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,869
Nobody walks...
nobody walks down that road with, with...

566
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:27,694
And I'm the same.
Without staring at that house.

567
00:39:27,818 --> 00:39:30,828
During the day I had
quite a bit of trouble with children.

568
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:35,286
hm, coming and really looking...

569
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:38,870
One of them threatened me talking about,

570
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:43,369
"He's a murderer and everything.
You should move" and...

571
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,902
He was only there for ten weeks

572
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:58,992
Ten weeks

573
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,860
He was only there for ten weeks

574
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,535
Ten weeks

575
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:05,118
It's just a chance

576
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:10,827
The one place
In the... in the whole world where he...

577
00:40:11,649 --> 00:40:14,233
Went to live for ten weeks

578
00:40:15,025 --> 00:40:18,284
Could have been anywhere
Could have been next door to you

579
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,114
Could have been next door to you

580
00:40:23,191 --> 00:40:26,450
Everybody would rather it all went away

581
00:40:26,982 --> 00:40:29,483
They must have sleepless nights

582
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:31,408
I know I do

583
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:36,484
When they boarded the house up,
that's when I really didn't like it.

584
00:40:36,523 --> 00:40:40,198
- We were thinking of moving.
- Well, you were, particularly.

585
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,862
It just sort of de-de-depressed me.

586
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,281
It depressed me living next door,
you know,

587
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:48,741
and I just sort of thought,
"Oh, I wanna be in a nice area."

588
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,199
I was thinking about moving once,
I was, yeah.

589
00:40:57,356 --> 00:41:00,780
I'm moving. 14th March.

590
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:06,567
We're really upset

591
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:15,030
I just wanted him...
It to be all over... and to know

592
00:41:17,105 --> 00:41:18,907
Were tho...

593
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:22,945
Were those prostitutes
Killed in that house?

594
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,818
They must have sleepless nights

595
00:42:07,186 --> 00:42:09,155
I know I do

596
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,604
- Hello.
- Hello.

597
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:35,114
Oh, right.

598
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:43,067
- I've seen you.
- I'm Ron. I live at number 86.

599
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,940
Oh. I'm Julie.

600
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:49,854
Do you wanna... do you wanna come in?

601
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:58,566
In October and December of last year

602
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:05,769
In October and December of last year

603
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:11,561
In October and December of last year

604
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:13,771
In October

605
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:20,566
- In October
- And December of last year

606
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:24,441
Well, this is the third time
That Steve Wright

607
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:28,434
Well, this is the third time
That Steve Wright

608
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:31,984
Well, this is the third time
That Steve Wright

609
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:35,395
He arrived here at Ipswich Crown Court

610
00:43:35,434 --> 00:43:39,226
But it's the first time
That he's formally entered a plea

611
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,313
- But it wasn't until two o'clock
- That he stood up

612
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,652
That he stood up
- Dressed in a black suit, white shirt

613
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:51,068
And blue tie
- White shirt and spoke

614
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:53,944
- And spoke clearly
- And confidently

615
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:56,985
And confidently when he was asked

616
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:02,065
How he would plead
To each of the five counts of murder?

617
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:06,105
They were read out in this order

618
00:44:06,224 --> 00:44:10,312
Well, this is
The third time that Steve Wright

619
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:12,186
Has appeared in court

620
00:44:12,307 --> 00:44:17,226
But it's the first time
That he's formally entered a plea

621
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:21,853
But it's the first time
That he's formally entered a plea

622
00:44:21,974 --> 00:44:24,688
He arrived here at Ipswich Crown Court

623
00:44:24,723 --> 00:44:27,224
But it wasn't
Until two o'clock this afternoon

624
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,724
That he stood up dressed in

625
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:35,525
A blue tie, black suit, white shirt

626
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,859
And spoke clearly and confidently

627
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,524
When he was asked

628
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:47,849
How he would plead
To each of the five counts of murder?

629
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:50,651
That were read out in this order

630
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:58,982
Clara Martin

631
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:02,522
Her body was the second to be found

632
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,771
Although she was the first woman
To go missing

633
00:45:11,596 --> 00:45:12,888
<i>Anna Reynolds</i>

634
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:16,639
Her body was, was the first to be found

635
00:45:16,763 --> 00:45:20,721
On 3rd December.

636
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:27,688
Annie Collingwood

637
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:31,099
Whose body was found in Acton

638
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,729
Was found in... in Acton

639
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:38,482
Sonia Farrell, Michelle Symonds

640
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:41,310
Their bodies were of course
Found in Levington

641
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,888
Found of course
A few hundred yards apart

642
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:47,307
Just a few hundred yards from each other

643
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:51,439
In Levington.

644
00:45:52,761 --> 00:45:57,016
We know that all women
Were working in the town as prostitutes

645
00:45:57,136 --> 00:46:00,313
And all their bodies were found naked

646
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:04,850
To each one of those counts of murder
Steve Wright, er, pleaded

647
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:08,648
Not guilty

648
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:24,685
We thought with everything happening
over the Christmas period,

649
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:27,764
with the prostitutes going missing
and being murdered,

650
00:46:27,802 --> 00:46:30,978
we needed to get together as a community.

651
00:46:31,093 --> 00:46:34,518
We got a lot of bad press
when it was all going on,

652
00:46:34,677 --> 00:46:38,386
saying sort... Lon, London Road was
a prostitute area and so forth like that,

653
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:42,303
and we just got absolutely cheesed off
with it as a... as a community.

654
00:46:42,343 --> 00:46:44,809
It is, it's, it's not nice being labelled.

655
00:46:45,884 --> 00:46:51,562
So we got together and... and managed
to get a real good committee going.

656
00:47:17,342 --> 00:47:19,391
Good evening, welcome

657
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:22,684
Good evening, welcome

658
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:26,141
Good evening, welcome

659
00:47:27,175 --> 00:47:28,894
Good evening, welcome

660
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:31,391
Welcome, welcome

661
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,052
Good evening, welcome

662
00:47:34,174 --> 00:47:35,514
Good evening

663
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:37,517
Welcome, welcome

664
00:47:37,633 --> 00:47:39,019
Good evening

665
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:43,351
This really is our first AGM

666
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:46,263
This really is our first AGM

667
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:49,593
Hoping hopefully the problem
With the girls has disappeared

668
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:51,268
We don't see them now

669
00:47:51,424 --> 00:47:54,185
I believe there are still
A few round in Hanford Road

670
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:58,435
But, erm, we really can't
Concern ourselves with it

671
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:00,848
The street has got much better

672
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:03,975
I think that the police
Have done exceptionally well

673
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,974
Under exceptional circumstances

674
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,101
To clear the streets as they have done

675
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,597
This really is our first AGM

676
00:48:12,173 --> 00:48:14,591
This really is our first AGM

677
00:48:15,631 --> 00:48:17,930
I wanna say thank you to the police

678
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:21,010
Thank 'em cos representatives here

679
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:24,058
And the ward councillors
The county councillors

680
00:48:24,173 --> 00:48:25,559
Who have done a lot to help us

681
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:29,348
And so thank you very much all of you

682
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:36,434
Yeah, forthcoming events

683
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:39,469
Julie...

684
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:44,889
Yeah, the quiz night

685
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,972
Fish-and-chip supper

686
00:48:49,339 --> 00:48:52,100
It's, erm, you know
More, the more the merrier?

687
00:48:52,214 --> 00:48:54,761
Friends, family so...

688
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:59,590
So hopefully see you all there
With your friends and family

689
00:48:59,755 --> 00:49:03,097
And also, er, London Road
In Bloom Contest

690
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:05,512
Big event on 11th July

691
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:09,932
To make the area look pretty and that
And getting people involved

692
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:13,389
And getting interested in their road
And their homes again

693
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:18,473
If you make your house look nice
And feel good about where you're living

694
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:21,467
You'll enjoy
You'll enjoy life a hell of a lot better

695
00:49:21,504 --> 00:49:24,964
So get thinking about
Your gardens, your designs

696
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,722
Hanging baskets and so forth

697
00:49:26,836 --> 00:49:29,054
So I'd like to see as many as possible

698
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,386
So it should be a good, good day

699
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,513
So get thinking about
Your gardens, your designs

700
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:36,180
Hanging baskets and so forth

701
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:38,547
So I'd like to see as many as possible

702
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:41,217
So it should be a good, good day

703
00:49:43,045 --> 00:49:44,301
That's about it.

704
00:49:44,336 --> 00:49:46,920
That's it. Thank you.

705
00:50:18,918 --> 00:50:20,838
(Sighs)

706
00:51:41,123 --> 00:51:42,924
Wm)

707
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,836
All right?

708
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:16,580
Impossible to report cos I can't...
I can't use the word "semen".

709
00:52:16,706 --> 00:52:17,961
Can you not?

710
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,918
Can't use the word "semen"
At lunchtime

711
00:52:20,038 --> 00:52:21,674
And I can't use it at six o'clock

712
00:52:21,788 --> 00:52:24,254
I can use it at ten o'clock
But I can't use it before teatime

713
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:25,876
So what do you use instead?

714
00:52:25,997 --> 00:52:28,000
I don't know, really. What can I say?

715
00:52:28,122 --> 00:52:29,592
Mum

716
00:52:29,622 --> 00:52:31,092
mum

717
00:52:32,746 --> 00:52:34,548
Well, that's just taste reasons

718
00:52:34,663 --> 00:52:37,377
Cos we... we can't basically have a...

719
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:41,213
Wha... what our editors call
a "Mummy, what's semen?" moment

720
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:44,877
Erm... in the trade

721
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,380
male bodily fluid...

722
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:50,089
Male body fluid

723
00:52:51,204 --> 00:52:54,166
Sounds as if he's going around
Spreading it all over Ipswich

724
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:56,669
Boy juice

725
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,705
<i>Ready'? Three. two. one.</i>

726
00:53:08,162 --> 00:53:10,129
Using his hands to demonstrate

727
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:12,923
Peter Wright explained
How forensic scientists

728
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:16,794
Had extracted Steve Wright's DNA
From other se...

729
00:53:23,578 --> 00:53:24,964
<i>Ready';?</i>

730
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:26,916
Using his hands to demonstrate

Cellular material found in the...

734
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:41,630
Told you, didn't I?

735
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,414
I think he probably did do it

736
00:53:43,536 --> 00:53:45,041
<i>He must have done it really;</i>

737
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,164
I think he did it
Definitely did it now

738
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:50,912
- I think they'll find him guilty
- I think he'll be found guilty but...

739
00:53:50,951 --> 00:53:52,670
- It's circumstantial
- But he's gonna get away with it

740
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:55,000
It's only circumstantial evidence
They've got?

741
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,371
I still reckon
He's gonna get away with it, you know...

742
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,546
Still running.

743

Steve Wright, Peter Wright.

748
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:14,582
Whenever you're ready

749
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:16,040
- OK.
- Just running up.

Peter Wright, Steve Wright

753
00:54:24,242 --> 00:54:25,961
This is the problem
With this bloody trial

754
00:54:25,992 --> 00:54:26,916
Too many Wrights

755
00:54:28,492 --> 00:54:31,123
- I think he probably did do it
- He must have done it really

How forensic scientists

Had extracted Steve Wright's DNA
From other DNA material

765
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:57,293
Found on both gloves...

766
00:54:57,449 --> 00:55:01,621
- Cellular material! This is complicated.
- We're running.

767
00:55:01,658 --> 00:55:03,578
How many takes are we gonna do?

768
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:05,169
- Dunno
- OK

769
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:07,996
- Well, that's running up
- Shall we just say "sperm"?

770
00:55:08,115 --> 00:55:09,667
- Ha!
- Sorry.

771
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:14,167
Question L, what was the first and
might possibly be the only, I'm not sure,

772
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:18,081
some people might know better than me,
the first Oscar-winning film...

That's gotta be him then.

Did it make sense to you?</i>

Yeah, that's all right.
That all works. We got it.

as far as I'm aware, about the only person

813
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:26,613
that has actually come down here
and asked the residents how they feel.

814
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:33,907
You know, we just wanna...
wanna see an end.

815
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:37,238
End to it, and London Road
getting back to being London Road,

816
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:42,823
instead of being known for somewhere...
where the murderer lived.

817
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:50,195
You see, the police
have ignored the problem, really.

818
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:52,078
Mm, they have. They would deny it.

819
00:57:52,193 --> 00:57:54,326
They will deny it, but they have ignored.

820
00:57:54,442 --> 00:57:56,695
They ignored the problem
of the prostitutes.

821
00:58:57,398 --> 00:58:59,899
- We've all stopped
- We've all stopped working now

822
00:58:59,941 --> 00:59:01,695
We've all stopped now

823
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:06,363
An' it, and it has been
Because of the murders

824
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:10,404
And it has, yeah
That's why, like, we all stopped

825
00:59:10,565 --> 00:59:13,279
I've got...
Well, saying that, I've got regulars

826
00:59:13,398 --> 00:59:14,987
you got regulars...

827
00:59:15,023 --> 00:59:16,990
That phone and we see

828
00:59:17,106 --> 00:59:19,358
You know, won't work the street

829
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,699
But we've got a few regulars
That keep us going

830
00:59:25,856 --> 00:59:27,574
You know, won't work the street

831
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,865
But we've got a few regulars
That keep us going

832
00:59:34,522 --> 00:59:36,774
Ever since the murders
Took place, like

833
00:59:36,898 --> 00:59:39,031
There's no point
Going down there for one

834
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:41,742
Because all the cars get stopped

835
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:44,072
And you just get arrested all the time

836
00:59:44,105 --> 00:59:45,943
They weren't, like, nicking us

837
00:59:46,063 --> 00:59:49,074
- They were, like, nicking the men
- They were just stopping all of the men

838
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,190
I wanna get myself clean
If I could do anything

839
00:59:55,313 --> 00:59:58,738
You know, like get myself clean
For them almost

840
00:59:58,771 --> 01:00:02,647
- Do you know what I mean?
- That's what, that's what I've done

841
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:04,401
Getting myself clean

842
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:08,147
- Since the murders...
- There's been help given us, yeah?

843
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,945
- There's girls that ain't took it
- We've took it

844
01:00:11,979 --> 01:00:13,982
And the girls who took it
A lot of them are doing really well

845
01:00:14,104 --> 01:00:17,695
And, you know
This has been a year later now

846
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:20,230
And yeah
We're coming about three times

847
01:00:20,479 --> 01:00:24,355
And what with other organisations
And stuff, you know

848
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:26,031
There has been the help there, you know

849
01:00:26,062 --> 01:00:28,693
With other organisations
And stuff, you know

850
01:00:28,729 --> 01:00:32,189
- There has been the help there
- We've all stopped

851
01:00:32,311 --> 01:00:34,397
We've all stopped now

852
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:39,315
An' it, an' it has been
Because of the murders

853
01:00:39,478 --> 01:00:42,405
That's why, like, we've all stopped

854
01:00:42,436 --> 01:00:44,937
I've got...
Well, saying that, I've got regulars

855
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:49,019
- We've got regulars
- That phone and we see

856
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:50,863
You know, won't work the street

857
01:00:50,977 --> 01:00:53,561
But we've got a few regulars
That keep us going

858
01:00:57,894 --> 01:00:59,612
You know, won't work the street

859
01:00:59,727 --> 01:01:02,488
But we've got a few regulars
That keep us going

860
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:09,854
And just do, like, instead of
Hundreds of pounds' worth of drugs a day

861
01:01:09,977 --> 01:01:14,195
Now all I do is, like
£15 worth of drugs a day now

862
01:01:14,227 --> 01:01:17,107
- If that
- I don't use it every day any more

863
01:01:17,227 --> 01:01:19,312
Maybe occasionally now I still use

864
01:01:19,435 --> 01:01:21,982
I'm still trying
To get over that hurdle but...

865
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:26,108
It's just that last little bit
You gotta get off, yeah

866
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:29,023
To what I was a year ago
Like, there is such a change

867
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,987
I never thought I'd get back
To what, where I am now

868
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:33,358
I really didn't

869
01:01:34,393 --> 01:01:38,778
Like, I've never been this big before
Either I was, like, a size fucking six

870
01:01:38,892 --> 01:01:41,607
I know, I've put on weight
I was like a size six

871
01:01:41,643 --> 01:01:43,397
We've all put on weight, yeah
We wasn't...

872
01:01:43,434 --> 01:01:46,230
It took all that for anyone
To start helping us

873
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:50,024
- Yeah, that's what's upsetting
- Yeah, that's what's upsetting

874
01:01:50,184 --> 01:01:52,483
Yeah, yeah, that's what's upsetting

875
01:01:53,434 --> 01:01:54,192
Yeah

876
01:01:54,683 --> 01:01:56,935
Took those five girls

877
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:59,737
That's what makes me feel
I wanna get clean for 'em

878
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,569
Because he's took their lives

879
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:04,445
Has took their lives
For them to help us

880
01:02:04,475 --> 01:02:07,853
Come on
Let's get these girls off the street

881
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:12,236
Come on
Let's get these girls off the street

882

'All parties in the case
of Ronnie Tretton, Court Four.'

883
01:02:34,224 --> 01:02:35,266
Hm...

884
01:02:51,223 --> 01:02:54,317
They're doing this now
just to tease us, aren't they?

885
01:02:54,432 --> 01:02:57,940
'All parties in the case
of David Hughes, Court Two.'

886
01:02:58,057 --> 01:03:01,979
There's that momentary pause
every time that goes off. It's awful.

887
01:03:02,515 --> 01:03:05,725
As soon as that verdict's in,
it's gonna be absolute mayhem.

888
01:03:08,681 --> 01:03:11,976
- What's happening?
- Don't know. Everyone's going

889

Six

920

Six-and-a-half weeks back in 2006

921

And over ten days

Now it seems...

924
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:07,475
He did say that he had sex
With four of those women

925

- One
- Can you come to me?

- Guilty
- Can you come to me?

01:05:11,468 --> 01:05:13,850
Now we hear it's guilty on count one

928
01:05:13,968 --> 01:05:16,599
- That's Clara Martin
- Can you come to me?

929
01:05:16,634 --> 01:05:21,019
Clara was the first to go missing
That was October 30th

930
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:23,102
Or maybe even the early hours
Of the 31st

931
01:05:23,134 --> 01:05:24,723
- Two
- Can you come to me?

932
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,426
- Guilty
-  We are getting the verdict

933
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:31,769
He was caught on an automatic
Number plate recognition camera

934
01:05:31,884 --> 01:05:34,680
- Two
- He's guilty of killing Anna Reynolds

935
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,470
- So that's two guilty verdicts so far
- He is accused of five counts of murder

936
01:05:39,592 --> 01:05:42,222
- We know he's guilty of the murder...
- Three, guilty

937
01:05:42,259 --> 01:05:45,518
Again, he's been found guilty
Of the murder of Emily Collingwood

938
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,553
The jury of nine men and three women

939
01:05:47,675 --> 01:05:50,721
Spent six-and-a-half hours
Deliberating this verdict

940
01:05:50,841 --> 01:05:54,018
- They went out just after midday
- Two more counts to go

941
01:05:54,133 --> 01:05:57,760
- Er, to consider the verdict
- Two more counts to go

942
01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:01,011
- Should all agree on a verdict
- Four, guilty

943
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:04,676
Four guilty, I'm told now
That Michelle Symonds has also been...

944
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,265
He's also guilty
Of killing Michelle Symonds

945
01:06:07,382 --> 01:06:09,053
We only have to hear the fifth count now

946
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:13,309
- We only have to hear the fifth count
- We only have to hear...

947
01:06:13,424 --> 01:06:15,308
Members of the jury
Will be telling the court now

948
01:06:15,424 --> 01:06:18,102
- She was found very, very close
- Perhaps only...

949
01:06:18,132 --> 01:06:22,387
Members of the jury will be telling...

950
01:06:22,423 --> 01:06:26,097
- A hundred or so yards apart
- The fifth count now we have to hear

951
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,348
The jury will be...

952
01:06:28,381 --> 01:06:31,558
Members of the jury
Will be telling the court now

953
01:07:01,047 --> 01:07:02,718
Guilty, now he's been found guilty

954
01:07:04,922 --> 01:07:08,133
Now he's been found guilty
On all five counts of murder?

955
01:07:08,255 --> 01:07:11,799
Guilty, Steve Wright guilty
Of all five counts of murder?

956
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:14,386
Of all five charges of murder?

957
01:07:14,505 --> 01:07:17,800
Steve Wright has been found guilty
On all charges

958
01:07:17,922 --> 01:07:19,391
He's been found guilty

959
01:07:19,505 --> 01:07:23,842
Guilty of killing Emily Collingwood
Guilty of killing Michelle Symonds

960
01:07:23,963 --> 01:07:27,257
For one of the most
Disgusting serial killings

961
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,089
Emma Rummy

962
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,807
- Of all five charges
- Guilty, Steve Wright guilty

963
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,971
Of all five counts of murder?

964
01:07:35,004 --> 01:07:37,552
Guilty on all five counts of murder

965
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:40,515
Steve Wright, a man
A very unremarkable man

966
01:07:40,545 --> 01:07:41,837
On the surface of things

967
01:07:41,879 --> 01:07:46,430
A man who has been responsible now
We know

968
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:50,420
For one of the most disgusting
Serial killings

969
01:07:51,837 --> 01:07:53,306
Hm Emma Rummy

970
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,838
We're still awaiting news
On Steve Wright's sentencing

971
01:07:55,879 --> 01:07:59,587
It's thought Mr Justice Gross will
Pass that first thing tomorrow morning

972
01:07:59,669 --> 01:08:01,057
This is Kelly McCormack

973
01:08:01,169 --> 01:08:03,588
Outside Ipswich Crown Court
For Classic FM

974
01:08:04,294 --> 01:08:08,466
OK. OK. OK. Bye.

975
01:08:08,586 --> 01:08:12,674
I'm staying connected. I'll keep
my headphones on too. Ooo-oo-oo!

976
01:08:14,753 --> 01:08:16,222
Oo-oo-ooh!

977
01:08:32,585 --> 01:08:34,304
Ooh.

978
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,712
I've got nearly 17 hanging baskets

979
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:28,717
In this back garden

980
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,719
Believe it or not

981
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,258
Begonias and petunias

982
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:39,796
And, erm, impatiens and things

983
01:09:40,707 --> 01:09:44,796
Marigolds, petunias and we got up there

984
01:09:45,707 --> 01:09:49,251
We got busy Lizzies
Hanging geraniums, all right, see

985
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:51,969
There's all sorts in that basket anyway

986
01:09:52,082 --> 01:09:53,469
<i>Hang it, nobilius</i>

987
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:56,255
Petunias in a basket
Hanging basket

988
01:09:56,374 --> 01:09:57,795
That's a fuchsia

989
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:04,591
Erm, there is a special name
I just call 'em lilies

990
01:10:04,624 --> 01:10:07,918
They're a lily type
There is a special name

991
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,802
And for the first time this year

992
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:15,585
I've got a couple of, erm... baskets

993
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:19,624
Begonias and petunias

994
01:10:19,665 --> 01:10:24,132
And, erm, impatiens and things

995
01:10:25,998 --> 01:10:28,332
Marigolds, petunias

996
01:10:28,455 --> 01:10:30,506
- Petunias
- We got busy Lizzies

997
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:34,758
- And, erm, impatiens and things
- Hanging lobelias

998
01:10:36,373 --> 01:10:41,800
Hanging baskets
Variegated ivy in there

999
01:10:41,913 --> 01:10:43,715
Which makes a nice show

1000
01:10:43,747 --> 01:10:49,341
And then you've got
These sky-blue... whatever they are

1001
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,043
Vm-veer-bel...la-la

1002
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:55,090
<i>that's little purple ones</i>

1003
01:10:55,872 --> 01:10:57,341
Rhubarb

1004
01:10:57,372 --> 01:11:00,714
The old-fashioned marguerites
The daisies

1005
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:05,380
The roses have done
Really well this year

1006
01:11:05,496 --> 01:11:06,918
Yeah

1007
01:11:06,954 --> 01:11:10,831
Gave us an extra point for having basil
On the windowsill, didn't she?

1008
01:11:10,954 --> 01:11:12,246
Yeah

1009
01:11:12,287 --> 01:11:14,456
- Hanging baskets
- Rhubarb

1010
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:17,541
- Variegated ivy in there
- The old-fashioned marguerites

1011
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:19,499
- Which makes a nice show
- The roses

1012
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:23,544
- And then you've got...
- Have done really well this year, yeah

1013
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:27,122
- Whatever they are
- I've got nearly 17 hanging baskets

1014
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:30,505
...basil on the windowsill, didn't she?

1015
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:34,495
I just call 'em lilies
They're a lily type

1016
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:38,590
- Impatiens and things
- Hanging baskets

1017
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:42,792
Begonias and petunias

1018
01:11:42,911 --> 01:11:48,458
And, erm, impatiens and things

1019
01:11:48,494 --> 01:11:52,085
Begonias and petunias

1020
01:11:52,202 --> 01:11:57,999
And, erm, impatiens and things

1021
01:12:00,495 --> 01:12:03,588
I've got nearly 17 hanging baskets

1022
01:12:03,702 --> 01:12:05,752
In this back garden

1023
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:08,336
Believe it or not

1024
01:12:08,494 --> 01:12:11,622
Begonias and petunias

1025
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:16,413
And, erm, impatiens and things

1026
01:12:29,742 --> 01:12:31,995
It's a terrible shame. It's...

1027
01:12:32,118 --> 01:12:37,415
I mean, we're reaping the benefits of
what's happened, really, which is, er...

1028
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:39,703
There's always a silver lining.

1029
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:48,003
Look, we turned this around, like,
and this is, this is what is possible.

1030
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:52,827
I would like in maybe two or three years,
it's gonna take time, I know,

1031
01:12:52,950 --> 01:13:00,500
cos of all red tape and what have you
and town hall, you know, Munchkins...

1032
01:13:03,991 --> 01:13:07,535
...is for the world's press
to come back in three years' time and say,

1033
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,869
"This was then. This is now."

1034
01:13:16,907 --> 01:13:22,288
I don't think anybody
really thought that they were bad girls.

1035
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:25,166
You know, I mean, they were in a way,

1036
01:13:25,282 --> 01:13:28,743
but they weren't hurting anybody else,
were they?

1037
01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:32,208
That was only their selves
they were to hurting, weren't it?

1038
01:13:34,157 --> 01:13:36,623
I think we've been scarred.

1039
01:13:37,782 --> 01:13:39,252
Forever.

1040
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:42,618
Women will never trust men again

1041
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:47,492
and men will always... wonder
what women are thinking.

1042
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:54,457
You know, people
have been... yeah, affected by this

1043
01:13:54,573 --> 01:13:58,164
and... I guess they always will.

1044
01:14:01,156 --> 01:14:05,245
I've almost got this mental picture
of when those girls got up to heaven.

1045
01:14:06,156 --> 01:14:10,493
That Saint Peter said, "Come in,"
and they, and they said something like...

1046
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:15,744
..."Do you mean it's over?
Do you mean it's finished?

1047
01:14:17,948 --> 01:14:21,325
"Do you mean, erm,
they can't hurt me anymore?"

1048
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:33,665
I can imagine for, erm,
people that lived outside the area

1049
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,458
where the prostitutes
hadn't affected anyone,

1050
01:14:36,488 --> 01:14:38,242
you would get a different opinion.

1051
01:14:38,363 --> 01:14:44,124
You'd get people feeling sorry for them
and so forth... you know.

1052
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:47,577
I feel sorry for the families,
but not them.

1053
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:49,826
<i>You know'?</i>

1054
01:14:50,321 --> 01:14:53,864
It was just a pain in the arse.
They were a complete pain in the neck.

1055
01:14:55,612 --> 01:14:57,698
You know, they're...

1056
01:14:57,821 --> 01:15:00,867
they're better off... sitting under.

1057
01:15:03,029 --> 01:15:07,663
That's a horrible thing to say, isn't it?
But what's happened has happened.

1058
01:15:07,778 --> 01:15:10,789
But I'm not... I'm not sad.

1059
01:15:13,445 --> 01:15:14,867
<i>You know'?</i>

1060
01:15:17,487 --> 01:15:19,371
I'd still shake his hand.

1061
01:15:21,654 --> 01:15:25,529
I'd love to just shake his hand and say,
"Thank you for getting rid of them."

1062
01:15:26,361 --> 01:15:29,407
I mean, I would, you know,
if you had the, at the end of the day,

1063
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:34,155
if you had the courage to do it,
then... erm...

1064
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:39,244
I'd shake their hand if I had the courage,
but I would... I wouldn't do it, but...

1065
01:15:40,236 --> 01:15:44,075
I can have that thought in my... my head

1066
01:15:44,194 --> 01:15:46,410
to say, "Yeah, thank you very much."?

1067
01:16:01,276 --> 01:16:04,121
Oh, God!

1068
01:16:09,235 --> 01:16:11,155
Wow

1069
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,865
Oh, wow! It's just...

1070
01:16:15,901 --> 01:16:19,030
Oh, wow! I think they peaked today.

1071
01:16:19,151 --> 01:16:22,410
Well, probably about, like, Wednesday.
Don't you think, Julie?

1072
01:16:22,442 --> 01:16:25,239
People have put
hanging baskets out this year

1073
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:28,949
that have never done hanging baskets
or pots before in their lives.

1074
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:31,948
But they made a real effort
for London Road In Bloom.

1075
01:16:31,984 --> 01:16:36,285
Oh, God! Wow!

1076
01:16:36,734 --> 01:16:39,863
I don't know a weed from a plant, I don't!

1077
01:16:40,025 --> 01:16:41,909
But I did do a... a pot.

1078
01:16:41,942 --> 01:16:44,738
Yes, we got June's pot.

1079
01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:47,406
These are double petunias.

1080
01:16:47,525 --> 01:16:49,942
- I love these. Look!
- Yeah.

1081
01:16:50,067 --> 01:16:55,032
Fantastic! Oh, the gardener's wife!

1082
01:16:57,233 --> 01:16:59,401
- Animals on the windowsill.
- Where?

1083
01:16:59,566 --> 01:17:02,991
Oh, this is great!

1084
01:17:03,108 --> 01:17:04,945
It's so...

1085
01:17:05,066 --> 01:17:08,491
It's nautical, religious, floral.

1086
01:17:08,607 --> 01:17:11,191
- All of human life is here!
-  Yeah.

1087
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:13,994
Oh, look! Fabulous! It's just...

1088
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:15,659
Look! Gnomes!

1089
01:17:15,773 --> 01:17:20,609
I gotta say,
it's Jesus that does it for me here.

1090
01:17:20,773 --> 01:17:22,658
It's a bit of Lourdes in London Road.

1091
01:17:24,315 --> 01:17:26,318
Yeah, there's gardens galore.

1092
01:17:27,024 --> 01:17:28,410
Very pleased with it.

1093
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:30,324
Come on and give me a one

1094
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,827
And a two

1095
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,571
I've been waiting all night
To dance with you...

1096
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:36,408
Come on! Woo!

1097
01:18:22,438 --> 01:18:24,157
Just help yourself to everything.

1098
01:18:37,937 --> 01:18:40,485
Hi again. I know you. You all right?

1099
01:18:40,604 --> 01:18:44,397
- Nice to see you, Julie. You all right?
- Yes, thank you. I recognise you.

1100
01:18:44,437 --> 01:18:45,942
You're the one!

1101
01:19:04,187 --> 01:19:05,987
Come on and give me a one

1102
01:19:06,103 --> 01:19:08,319
And a two

1103
01:19:08,437 --> 01:19:12,193
I've been waiting all night
To dance with you

1104
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,445
I would like to introduce you to Julie

1105
01:19:21,602 --> 01:19:25,561
who has worked non-stop
to organise this event.

1106
01:19:25,685 --> 01:19:29,029
- Here's Julie to give out some prizes.
- Carole's doing the announcing.

1107
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:31,028
And Carole's going to do some...
Carole!

1108
01:19:31,144 --> 01:19:34,106
I'd like to introduce you to Carole
as well then in that case.

1109
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:37,654
Carole is one
of our local neighbourhood councillors

1110
01:19:37,768 --> 01:19:41,147
and she was one of the judges today
in the competition and...

1111
01:19:41,268 --> 01:19:43,272
Well, I've lost the plot
of who's gonna speak now,

1112
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:46,272
so I'll get out the way
and leave you to these two.

1113
01:20:05,434 --> 01:20:08,065
Erm... hi, everybody.

1114
01:20:08,184 --> 01:20:13,352
This is the really wonderful
inaugural party in London Road.

1115
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:16,106
After, er, judging the best gardens

1116
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:19,152
and it really, really was difficult
choosing winners.

1117
01:20:19,267 --> 01:20:23,569
And Julie must just be
The hanging basket queen of London Road

1118
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,021
Anyway, it was a real pleasure today
Really good fun

1119
01:20:28,849 --> 01:20:31,481
And so many people
Have made such a great effort

1120
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,024
To make London Road look beauteous

1121
01:20:35,141 --> 01:20:37,310
We're going to do the best front garden

1122
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:42,565
And we pick as the runner-up
As the winner, this garden

1123
01:20:42,682 --> 01:20:45,065
Where it was very difficult

1124
01:20:45,182 --> 01:20:50,017
it was a real challenge
To make this front garden beautiful

1125
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:53,566
Because basically it's all parking

1126
01:20:55,099 --> 01:20:57,682
Er, it looks absolutely lovely

1127
01:20:57,807 --> 01:20:59,775
And once you look round the cars

1128
01:20:59,807 --> 01:21:02,024
Fantastic

1129
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:04,606
Terry and June

1130
01:21:05,765 --> 01:21:08,313
Come to the front, come to the front

1131
01:21:08,349 --> 01:21:11,145
- Well done, Tel
- Well done

1132
01:21:11,931 --> 01:21:15,439
Really, really wonderful effort

1133
01:21:15,556 --> 01:21:17,026
Well done

1134
01:21:17,057 --> 01:21:21,109
Look at me, please
Everyone, smile

1135
01:21:23,431 --> 01:21:27,437
Look at me, please
Everyone, smile

1136
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:32,442
Yeah, we have...
We have official photographers

1137
01:21:32,598 --> 01:21:34,067
We have Jessica

1138
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:35,733
We're gonna have an exhibition
An' everything

1139
01:21:35,764 --> 01:21:37,897
- No, we're not
- We are, we are

1140
01:21:39,181 --> 01:21:41,942
- Thank you
- OK

1141
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:48,724
Now there is the absolute winner

1142
01:21:49,097 --> 01:21:51,515
The absolute winner

1143
01:21:52,347 --> 01:21:55,025
And it is

1144
01:21:55,139 --> 01:21:58,433
With the very best garden I do believe

1145
01:21:59,972 --> 01:22:02,140
And it is

1146
01:22:02,263 --> 01:22:05,273
Dodge, yes, it's Dodge

1147
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,889
Oh, well done

1148
01:22:09,013 --> 01:22:10,933
Look at me, please

1149
01:22:12,888 --> 01:22:14,523
Look at me, please

1150
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:17,482
Look at me, please
Everyone, smile

1151
01:22:17,638 --> 01:22:22,141
Everyone, smile
Everyone, smile

1152
01:22:22,179 --> 01:22:25,639
I think this is absolutely fantastic

1153
01:22:25,678 --> 01:22:28,689
So many people here tonight

1154
01:22:28,804 --> 01:22:30,723
I haven't counted you all

1155
01:22:31,345 --> 01:22:33,514
Seeing everybody have a great time

1156
01:22:33,553 --> 01:22:35,722
Seeing everybody have a great time

1157
01:22:35,845 --> 01:22:38,974
That's what it's all about
That's what it's all about

1158
01:22:39,845 --> 01:22:42,061
I would like to congratulate

1159
01:22:43,095 --> 01:22:47,183
Everyone that's really worked hard
On the gardens

1160
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:51,513
Even the people that haven't won

1161
01:22:52,469 --> 01:22:56,262
It doesn't matter, it's...
It doesn't matter

1162
01:22:57,511 --> 01:23:01,469
It's sharing their gardens
With everyone else

1163
01:23:01,928 --> 01:23:06,064
It's sharing their gardens
With everyone else

1164
01:23:06,885 --> 01:23:08,687
And really working hard

1165
01:23:08,802 --> 01:23:11,599
And making London Road
What London Road is

1166
01:23:11,718 --> 01:23:13,687
A fantastic road

1167
01:23:13,802 --> 01:23:18,057
Look at me, please
Look at me, please

1168
01:23:18,177 --> 01:23:22,052
- A fantastic road
- Look at me, please

1169
01:23:22,093 --> 01:23:24,061
Everyone, smile...

1170
01:23:30,551 --> 01:23:31,937
- You all right?
- Yes.

1171
01:23:32,051 --> 01:23:33,805
I'd just like to point out as well

1172
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:38,181
It does seem that God
ls smiling on London Road

1173
01:23:38,218 --> 01:23:41,144
Cos if you'd you seen
The weather forecast for today

1174
01:23:41,259 --> 01:23:43,345
Well, look at it now

1175
01:23:44,676 --> 01:23:46,761
Well, look at it now

1176
01:23:47,717 --> 01:23:49,637
Well, look at it now

1177
01:23:49,759 --> 01:23:56,727
Well, look at it now

1178
01:23:56,758 --> 01:24:05,102
Well, look at it now

1179
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:06,509
And if I ask something
that you don't wanna ans...

1180
01:25:06,631 --> 01:25:08,515
then that's fine, just tell me to...

1181
01:25:08,631 --> 01:25:10,599
Christina said you'll tell me
to shut up anyway.

1182
01:25:12,673 --> 01:25:18,800
So, erm, I know, erm, what you're all,
you know, involved in work-wise.

1183
01:25:18,839 --> 01:25:21,221
Used to be.
We've all stopped.

1184
01:25:21,339 --> 01:25:24,184
- We've all stopped working now.
-  OK.

1185
01:25:24,297 --> 01:25:27,426
Because of the murders
we've all stopped.

1186
01:25:27,547 --> 01:25:32,133
That's why we all stopped.
I stopped like a month before the murders.

1187
01:25:32,255 --> 01:25:36,592
We've got regulars
that phone and we see, you know.

1188
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:39,841
Won't work the street,
but we've got a few regulars.

1189
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,597
Ever since the murders took place, like,
there's no point going down there for one

1190
01:25:44,713 --> 01:25:49,678
because all the cars get stopped
and you just get arrested all the time.

1191
01:25:49,796 --> 01:25:53,139
They weren't nicking us.
They were nicking the men.

1192
01:25:53,171 --> 01:25:56,964
I wanna get myself clean.

1193
01:25:57,088 --> 01:26:01,045
If I could do anything, you know, like,
I'd get myself clean for them almost.

1194
01:26:07,296 --> 01:26:12,095
I got up and all I could see
were police cars going up the road.

1195
01:26:12,129 --> 01:26:15,506
And, of course, you know, like,
we knew, obviously, it was in charge.

1196
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,550
- Something to do with these poor girls.
- Yeah.

1197
01:26:18,586 --> 01:26:22,344
But erm... And that's
when it all started. it all kicked off.

1198
01:26:22,504 --> 01:26:25,597
You think it could be him.
Yeah.

1199
01:26:25,711 --> 01:26:28,129
That he could be amongst us

1200
01:26:28,252 --> 01:26:31,215
and walking around with us every day
and we don't know.

1201
01:26:31,336 --> 01:26:35,175
Like, anyone. It could anyone in here,
which has now really soared me.

1202
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:37,972
Now I'm thinking about it,
I'm just gonna, like, cry!

1203
01:26:39,836 --> 01:26:43,593
This was the third time
Steve Wright has appeared in court,

1204
01:26:43,627 --> 01:26:46,673
but it's the first time
that he's formally entered a plea.

1205
01:26:46,794 --> 01:26:50,670
He arrived here at Ipswich Crown Court
shortly after nine o'clock this morning,

1206
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:54,052
but it wasn't until two o'clock
this afternoon that he stood up,

1207
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:57,055
dressed in a black suit,
white shirt and blue tie,

1208
01:26:57,169 --> 01:27:01,340
and spoke clearly and confidently
when he was asked how he would plea

1209
01:27:01,501 --> 01:27:03,719
to each of the five counts of murder.

1210
01:27:03,835 --> 01:27:05,754
They were read out in this order...

1211
01:27:06,793 --> 01:27:08,761
I've been here since about half-nine.

1212
01:27:08,793 --> 01:27:12,965
I just saw him come along, like,
with the police, sirens and that.

1213
01:27:13,084 --> 01:27:17,718
They were... you know...
None of the photographers caught him.

1214
01:27:17,834 --> 01:27:20,714
Caught any photos of him
or anything but...

1215
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,631
Just waiting to get a glimpse, really.

1216
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:25,800
Yeah, look at this. Look at this.

1217
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:27,755
It's horrible, innit, eh?

1218
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,926
It's a wicked bloody world.

1219
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:35,293
Yourself, I mean, you'd be,
as far as I'm, well, as far as I'm aware,

1220
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:38,130
about the only person
that has actually come down here

1221
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:40,544
and asked the residents how they feel.

1222
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:45,256
I think this is absolutely fantastic.

1223
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:47,875
So many people here tonight.

1224
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,588
I haven't counted you all.

1225
01:27:49,709 --> 01:27:52,968
Seeing everybody have a great time,
that's what it's all about.

1226
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,880
I would like to congratulate everyone

1227
01:27:55,999 --> 01:27:58,761
<i>that's really worked hard
on their gardens.</i>

1228
01:27:58,874 --> 01:28:01,719
Even the people that haven't won.
it doesn't matter.

1229
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:06,834
It's sharing their gardens
with everyone else and really working hard

1230
01:28:06,874 --> 01:28:09,375
and making London Road
what London Road is -

1231
01:28:09,499 --> 01:28:11,300
a fantastic road.

1232
01:28:18,791 --> 01:28:21,966
I've got nearly 17 hanging baskets

1233
01:28:22,082 --> 01:28:24,298
In this back garden

1234
01:28:24,915 --> 01:28:27,000
Believe it or not

1235
01:28:27,123 --> 01:28:30,383
Begonias and petunias

1236
01:28:30,498 --> 01:28:35,215
And, erm, impatiens and things

1237
01:28:35,831 --> 01:28:40,832
Marigolds, petunias
And we got up there

1238
01:28:40,956 --> 01:28:44,665
We got busy Lizzies
Hanging geraniums, all right, see

1239
01:28:44,831 --> 01:28:47,463
There's all sorts in that basket anyway

1240
01:28:47,581 --> 01:28:49,003
Hanging nobilius

1241
01:28:49,122 --> 01:28:51,505
Petunias in a basket, hanging basket

1242
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:53,755
That's a fuchsia

1243
01:28:53,872 --> 01:29:00,166
Erm, there is a special name
I just call 'em lilies

1244
01:29:00,289 --> 01:29:03,500
They're a lily type
There is a special name

1245
01:29:03,622 --> 01:29:06,419
And for the first time this year

1246
01:29:06,539 --> 01:29:10,960
I've got a couple of erm... baskets

1247
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:15,253
Begonias and petunias

1248
01:29:15,372 --> 01:29:20,088

1249
01:29:20,913 --> 01:29:24,207

-  Marigolds, petunias

1250
01:29:24,329 --> 01:29:30,291

-  And, erm, impatiens and things

1251
01:29:50,245 --> 01:29:54,997
Hanging baskets
Variegated ivy in there

1252
01:29:55,037 --> 01:29:57,004
Which makes a nice show

1253
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:02,880
And then you've got
These sky-blue... whatever they are

1254
01:30:04,287 --> 01:30:05,922
Vm-veer-veer-la-la

1255
01:30:06,037 --> 01:30:08,667
That's, er, little purple ones

1256
01:30:09,244 --> 01:30:11,082
Rhubarb.

1257
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:14,332
The old-fashioned marguerites
The daisies

1258
01:30:14,369 --> 01:30:18,956
The roses
Have done really well this year

1259
01:30:19,078 --> 01:30:20,464
Yeah

1260
01:30:21,369 --> 01:30:24,913
Gave us an extra point for having basil
On the windowsill, didn't she?

1261
01:30:26,578 --> 01:30:28,166
-   Hanging baskets
-   Rhubarb

1262

01:30:47,743 --> 01:30:53,087

And things
