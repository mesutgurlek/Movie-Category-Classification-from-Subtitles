1
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,919
The designs are all right.

2
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,517
Work at this leisurely pace?

3
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:52,523
Completed in 2 months.

4
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:56,933
Must be completed on time.

5
00:03:57,536 --> 00:04:00,528
- The boss Wants you, sir.

6
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:04,935
Before you leave this evening.

7
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,539
Mr Rajkumar Gupta?

8
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,950
The boss has sent for me.

9
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:17,945
Sending for you noWadays.

10
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,957
- Why mustn't I?

11
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,959
Of times, for all I care.

12
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:28,556
Be Wary of your bosses.

13
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,058
- Perfectly Well.

14
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,563
Thank you very much.

15
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,968
He says I don't like his success!

16
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:43,570
I'm not a sycophant, anyway!

17
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,920
- Yes, do come in.

18
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:55,590
Gulabchand's proposed colony.

19
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,594
Before I sent it to him.

20
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,990
You have approved of it, sir?

21
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:04,591
I value your opinion.

22
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:07,995
Has improved our business.

23
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:10,006
Do you think I can't notice that?

24
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,600
It's very kind of you, sir.

25
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:16,009
I'm hosting a small party.

26
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:21,018
To my place Which isn't right!

27
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,019
You must bring her over tomorroW.

28
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:25,612
- Good-bye.

29
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:30,023
- Greetings, sir.

30
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:32,028
I've been Waiting for you.

31
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,622
Greetings, madam... Do come in.

32
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:40,036

33
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,631
Do sit doWn, madam!

34
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:46,033

36
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,038

His Work, even at a party!

38
00:05:55,821 --> 00:06:00,656
Man as hard-Working as your son.

39
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:01,650
You are magnanimous to say that.

40
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:04,653
My responsibilities to him.

41
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:10,961
Feel like Working anymore.

42
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,061
What Will I do With more?

43
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,332
And she's been take care of.

Your mother along today.

50
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:39,086
Introduce you to her.

51
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,356
Have you spoken to your mother?

52
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,102
The subject With mom...

53
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,099
strange feeling!

54
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,697
Then Won't you ever talk to her?

55
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,701
Of course, I Will.

56
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,370
And make you sit in front of her.

57
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:59,109
What Will I announce?

58
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:04,114
And I Want to marry her.

59
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:04,718
And mother to sort out.

60
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:09,218
- Okay. Have some tea noW.

61
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:13,129
If you insist.

62
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:18,134
After a cup of tea.

63
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:23,140
There's no need to have the tea!

64
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:28,138
My ideas are even dirtier!

65
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:41,158
You've met her so often.

66
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:44,752
Actually, I...

67
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,421
The two of us...

68
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,157
Would you like some more tea?

69
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,762
We Want to get married, mom.

70
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:00,167
That's Wonderful.

71
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:04,779
If you Want to get married?

72
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,441
Have you no objections?

73
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,779
To fear that you might perhaps...

74
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:18,185
Object to the match? No...

75
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,790
Raj is an educated, Wise man.

76
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:26,202
Decisions for himself.

77
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:32,199
His decisions, too.

78
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,203
Seek her blessings!

79
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,810
And a happy one, too.

80
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,213
May I leave noW?

81
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,226
Yes. Raj Will drop you home.

82
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,221
- Good-bye, Mother.

83
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,239
HoW do you find Shanti, mom?

84
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:16,248
I like her a lot, too.

85
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:22,857
You think of my decision?

86
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:26,253
- Why must you?

87
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:27,854
What difference must it make...

88
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:32,860
...Whether I like it or not.

89
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:38,873
A difference to me.

90
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:39,875
Had for you...

91
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:43,870
been shattered...

92
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:52,880
your marriage today!

93
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,685
But What does Shanti lack...

94
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,293
Shanti lacks anything?

95
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,287
I knoW she's a good girl.

96
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,892
Will have a blissful life.

97
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:08,295
That joy for myself? - No!

98
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:09,903
Because such insignificant joys...

99
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,567
Who are inconsequential.

100
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:17,910
Inconsequential person!

101
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,181
The bigger joys of life.

102
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,751
It makes no sense!

103
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,913
Shanti as your daughter-in-laW?

104
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,752
Why Wouldn't I like her?

105
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,917
A good daughter-in-laW...

106
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,922
me for the rest of my life?

107
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,325
To think of myself.

108
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:41,436
I am noW thinking of your future.

109
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:47,935
Your boss's daughter, Kamini.

110
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:55,445
Even think of that, mom?!

111
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,354
Who thought about this.

112
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,348
He spoke to me at the party.

113
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,949
To marry his daughter.

114
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:09,356
Partner in his company.

115
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:20,377
You're saying, mom?

116
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,379
You'd better give it a thought.

117
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,974
A mere clerk in an office...

118
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:32,982
only a burden of responsibilities.

119
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:37,987
Of the millionaire, Mr Deendayal.

120
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:42,394
OWner of a thriving company.

121
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:47,001
You have ever dreamt of!

122
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,096
But I love Shanti!

123
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:52,408
You have loved me!

124
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,672
But I have given her a promise!

125
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:59,410
You Will achieve something in life!

126
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,423
Emotions and reject this opportunity!

127
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:10,017
It is Kamini you must marry!

128
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,429
It is Kamini you have to marry!

129
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:48,060
Partner in my company, Raj.

130
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:57,464
Put your signature here, son.

131
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:00,734
For you, sir.

132
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:12,488
Resolution to our bankers, too.

133
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:26,493
Congratulations.

134
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,497
To your Wedding.

135
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,104
- No, I must leave.

136
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:41,508
You must be a busy man.

137
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:46,514
And I have done that.

138
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:53,120
There's something I must tell you.

139
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,131
Interest you...

140
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:01,130
my duty to inform you.

141
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:07,944
I'm expecting your baby.

142
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:32,159
I'm pregnant With your baby.

143
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:37,164
What's the matter, Raj?

144
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,597
Won't you ask me in?

145
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,202
Come in.

146
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,209
All this happened...

147
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:26,214
bringing up all that?

148
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:30,217
What's there to talk of noW?

149
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:36,623
And you chose one. Period.

150
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:41,228
You please...

151
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:49,637
HoW Will you manage?

152
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,243
That brought me here...

153
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,652
So you are here to help me?

154
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:01,919
You brought? Speak up!

155
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,661
Have not come here to help me.

156
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,655
To seek my help instead!

157
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,658
On your conscience!

158
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,263
Provide a house, perhaps...

159
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,266
the rest of my life...

160
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:23,679
burden on your soul!

161
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:28,277
Any help from you!

162

164
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:40,687
Shall bear this child.

165
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,292
With all my love...

166
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:50,697
a reminder of the days...

167
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,034
...When I truly loved someone.

168
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,718
You have delivered a baby-boy.

169
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:40,529
Were taking a Walk in the garden.

170
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,530
Aren't you scared of death?

171
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:51,938
Every day in the last 25 years.

172
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,941
Be scared of death?

173
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:02,952
In a very critical condition!

174
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:17,564

You shouldn't be saying such things!

179
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:35,582
Anything from you.

180
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:41,588
Nothing to be ashamed of.

181
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:47,264
But there is something I regret.

182
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:54,009
Any happiness in life.

183
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:57,604
Like this, mom?

184
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:00,273
All your life, only for my sake.

185
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:03,610
You did it all for me!

186
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:06,019
Given you anything.

187
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:10,016
- No, my son...

188
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:17,631
your eyes, not tears.

189
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:21,027
Just courage!

190
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,030
Take this.

191
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:27,634
This is no garland, my son...

192
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:30,303

193

Have faith in me.

196
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:57,069

Yourself Weak in life.

198

Your son Will never Weaken...

202
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:53,842

241
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:29,455

00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:48,477
Not believe in such meetings.

You Will occupy that chair...

260
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,542

Right answer to every question.

268
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:25,576
Live-computer of the company!

Wing of any of our buildings!

271

What's the matter, dad?

276
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:51,864
Some seven years ago.

Took possession of your land?

280
00:32:01,618 --> 00:32:02,209
We filed a case...

281
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:04,883
last 6 years Without a decision.

282

Sit doWn.

298
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:13,739
What is it?

299
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:18,146
I have just 5 minutes for you.

300
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,352
You had purchased a piece of land...

301
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:28,355

302
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:32,758
at least 5 lakh Rupees today.

303
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,770
Bit productive for you because...

304
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:40,366
has illegally occupied it.

305
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:45,037
Your 5 lakhs is as good as sunk.

306
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:51,777
Recover my lost money?

307
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,781
That piece of land.

308
00:34:58,061 --> 00:34:59,392
Time as Madhav vacates it...

309
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:03,798
...that land is Worth nothing?

310
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:07,400
LaWyers have not been successful...

311
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,396
...in evicting him

312
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:15,403

dynamic and intelligent man.

316
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:34,421
Confidence in himself...

317
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:38,824
a sound scheme to me.

318
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:43,429
Inexperienced young man...

319
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:46,432

320

321
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,443
It's the blessings of my mother.

322
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,452

327

329
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:43,889

Buy our plot at Model ToWn.

331
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:51,504

Please go With him.

335
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:20,526
Is your name Madhav Singh?

336
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,201
What is it?

337
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:28,204
Have raised a toWnship of sin...

338

Maybe. Come to the point!

341

Land has indeed been sold to you.

349
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:27,001
A payment of 5 lakh Rupees.

350
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:31,599
To me for the money?

351
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:33,600
Leading financiers of the city...

352
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:38,003
lend money in millions.

353
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,109
But Who'd Want that land as security?

354
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:48,022
By a thug called Madhav Singh.

355
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:51,021
- Please don't Worry about that.

356

And I Will get possession of it.

359
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:08,300
I'll deal With the rest.

360
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:10,636
That turns out to be true.

361
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:13,639
The 5 lakh Rupees to me?

362
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:16,983
I'll build a colony on the plot...

363
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:20,646
intended but could not build.

364
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:30,055

- It's almost 11!

367
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:39,664
Are you out of your mind?

368
00:39:40,176 --> 00:39:41,165
That he'd come here?

369
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:44,669
Can't be trusted, boss.

370
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,694
Here I am.

371
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:12,700
But you Will not return.

372
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:20,105
I'm here to send you packing.

373
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:23,709
Brought an ambulance.

374
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:25,718
Reaching the hospital...

375
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:28,714

376
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:38,257

Toss him in the van!

To the emergency Ward!

381
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:17,613
And check it thoroughly.

382
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:20,612
Dad said it's very important...

383
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,954
This is Shekhar, Mr Gupta's son.

384
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:32,362
And I'm terribly impressed!

A cheque of Rs. 5 lakhs.

389
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:47,972
- You must give it to my father...

390
00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:51,977
Why drag me into this?

391
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:58,383
It's one and the same thing for me.

392
00:44:58,995 --> 00:44:59,984
- All right.

393
00:45:00,997 --> 00:45:04,398
You're not in a hurry, are you?

394
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:05,990
No, I am in no hurry.

517
00:57:47,224 --> 00:57:49,215
Gangu! HoW are you?

518
00:57:51,228 --> 00:57:52,718
Since this morning.

519
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,563
For some money today!

00:57:55,132 --> 00:57:57,726
Paid you 300 Rupees!

521
00:57:58,402 --> 00:58:00,393
To give you!

522
00:58:01,738 --> 00:58:03,729
No money to give me...

523
00:58:04,741 --> 00:58:07,403
to splurge on the young dame!

524
00:58:08,412 --> 00:58:10,744
You have a Wife and young children.

525
00:58:11,148 --> 00:58:13,139
Mistress in a separate house!

526
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:16,142
Just you Watch out, Bhandari!

527

529
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:26,752
- Gangu! You take every joke seriously!

530
00:58:28,765 --> 00:58:30,255
You're a strange man!

531
00:58:32,169 --> 00:58:35,161
Cough it up! Out With the money!

532
00:58:38,175 --> 00:58:39,767
- Shut up!

533
00:58:41,278 --> 00:58:42,768
I'm going to be broke!

534
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,181
The fun you have, Bhandari!

535
00:58:46,783 --> 00:58:48,774
NoW get lost... go aWay!

536
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:54,788
Squeezed out of you?

537
00:58:57,194 --> 00:58:59,185
Quiet! There are people at home!

538
00:58:59,463 --> 00:59:01,454
But hoW do you knoW all this?

539
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:03,630
Let's not Worry about that...

540
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:06,292
your Well-being instead.

541
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:10,196
I can rid you of Gangu.

542
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:13,802
- It's the tender Mr R.K. Gupta...

543
00:59:15,212 --> 00:59:17,806
Shipping Corporation...

544
00:59:19,216 --> 00:59:23,209
before they are dispatched.

545
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:31,325
But you Will fix Gangu first.

546
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:37,223
The streets you Walk on.

547
00:59:38,835 --> 00:59:43,329
Consider your Work done, too.

548
00:59:45,242 --> 00:59:47,506
But you must fix my problem first.

549
00:59:48,245 --> 00:59:51,840
- Right aWay, sir.

550
00:59:52,015 --> 00:59:57,351
And betel-leaf they ask for.

551
00:59:58,255 --> 01:00:00,849
I'll settle it With you.

552
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:03,849
For you just noW.

553
01:00:04,261 --> 01:00:06,252
Who the hell is that?

554
01:00:08,265 --> 01:00:10,256
There he is!

555
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:16,262
Who is that?

556
01:00:37,561 --> 01:00:39,893
- What's up?

557
01:00:41,298 --> 01:00:45,291
- I do... so?

558
01:00:46,903 --> 01:00:50,304
Acquaintance anymore. Got it?

I make others see it!

560
01:03:02,439 --> 01:03:04,430
Strong man?

561
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,699
And bash me up!

562
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:11,547
Bhandari again, Gangu...

563
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:15,549
not to the hospital, okay?

564
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:18,444
Of course, it's okay!

565
01:03:18,588 --> 01:03:22,547
The lanes Bhandari Walks on!

566
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,452
If you ask me to!

567
01:03:27,063 --> 01:03:29,054
Get going!

568
01:03:36,473 --> 01:03:38,464
Take 'em aWay!

569
01:03:44,748 --> 01:03:47,080
Started this company!

570
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:51,482
With a contract I've Wanted!

571
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:53,922
Walks into the business...

572
01:03:54,491 --> 01:03:56,482
...and snatches a contract

573
01:03:57,494 --> 01:03:59,485
It's okay, Daddy.

574
01:04:00,096 --> 01:04:02,087
We quoted a price in our tender.

575
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:06,094
Lesser sum for the same facilities.

576
01:04:06,503 --> 01:04:07,936
Have got the contract.

577
01:04:08,505 --> 01:04:11,497
I've found every detail about that.

578
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,766
Of amount in our tenders?

579
01:04:14,778 --> 01:04:17,110
- One Rupee?

580
01:04:17,514 --> 01:04:19,505
Yes! One Rupee!

581
01:04:19,783 --> 01:04:22,115
Was the same as ours.

582
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,953
One measly Rupee!

583
01:04:25,522 --> 01:04:30,118
It's an extremely interesting one.

584
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:33,121
As if Vijay Kumar knew...

585
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:36,121
...the details of our tender.

586
01:04:36,533 --> 01:04:37,966
But hoW is that possible?

587
01:04:38,535 --> 01:04:41,129
Who knew about it, it Was I...

588
01:04:42,138 --> 01:04:43,799
...and Miss Geeta.

589
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,801
I can't understand hoW...

590
01:04:46,142 --> 01:04:50,545
You may go noW.

591
01:05:01,825 --> 01:05:04,658
Of Rs. 3000, hadn't you?

592
01:05:05,562 --> 01:05:07,553
I Was in need of the money.

593
01:05:08,832 --> 01:05:12,563
Bhandari before you leave.

594
01:05:19,843 --> 01:05:24,576
Funeral pyre...

595
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:29,842
for the one Who has tormented you.

596
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:33,579
Of my battles today.

597
01:05:35,859 --> 01:05:37,850
But this is nothing...

598
01:05:39,596 --> 01:05:41,587
...the War is yet to begin.

599
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,191
Bless me!

600
01:05:53,943 --> 01:05:57,606
Games life plays With me.

601
01:05:59,883 --> 01:06:01,874
I have alWays Won the games...

602
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:06,048
No matter What I had resort to...

603
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:09,882
...or What price I had to pay.

604
01:06:12,629 --> 01:06:15,621
The habit of Winning.

605
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:22,901
Defeat after all these years...

606
01:06:25,642 --> 01:06:27,633
Do you think I'll quit the game?

607
01:06:28,645 --> 01:06:33,639
Never do that!

608
01:06:38,655 --> 01:06:41,249
- Just a minute more.

609
01:06:47,263 --> 01:06:49,254
HoW are you?

610
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:53,261
What happened the other day.

611
01:06:53,937 --> 01:06:55,928
But believe me...

612
01:06:56,673 --> 01:06:59,767

613
01:07:00,677 --> 01:07:02,110
- Yes.

614
01:07:02,278 --> 01:07:07,511
Striking a deal, I hope?

615
01:07:07,617 --> 01:07:08,276
Not at all!

616
01:07:09,686 --> 01:07:11,278
I remember What you told me.

617
01:07:11,688 --> 01:07:13,679
The World is up for sale.

618
01:07:13,957 --> 01:07:16,687
Put that incident behind us.

619
01:07:17,293 --> 01:07:19,693
Or it Would really hurt me.

620
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:24,132
Comes from the heart...

621
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:27,295

She's R.K. Gupta's daughter.

624
01:07:40,717 --> 01:07:42,981
While I settle the bill.

625
01:07:53,997 --> 01:07:55,328
I'm not late, I hope?

626
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:59,324

...the Maniklal Memorial contract.

646

Some changes in it.

647
01:09:46,843 --> 01:09:50,438
Bagged this contract, too?!

648
01:09:53,116 --> 01:09:55,107
Between our tenders?

649
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:13,458
Maniklal Memorial hospital...

650
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:15,961
...has gone to Vijay Kumar.

651
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:22,470
Difference between our contracts...

652
01:10:24,147 --> 01:10:26,274
...Was once again just one rupee.

653
01:10:26,883 --> 01:10:30,876
- Right... one rupee.

654
01:10:32,155 --> 01:10:36,057
The difference of a rupee?

655
01:10:36,225 --> 01:10:38,489
- For the difference of...

656
01:10:39,495 --> 01:10:41,895
rupees did he pay you?

657
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:44,022
Are you insinuating that...

658
01:10:46,169 --> 01:10:48,501
be a mere co-incidence!

659
01:10:48,905 --> 01:10:51,499

KnoWs Vijay the best!

663
01:11:01,517 --> 01:11:04,509
Go ahead and deny that!

664
01:11:04,921 --> 01:11:06,912
I don't ever meet Vijay!

665
01:11:07,924 --> 01:11:09,516
Bump into him twice!

666
01:11:09,926 --> 01:11:13,191
Has occurred twice, too!

667
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:19,524
Level such a false accusation at me!

668
01:11:19,936 --> 01:11:23,531
Ioyalty and sincerity!

01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:26,937
You used to!

670
01:11:40,556 --> 01:11:42,956
Before I leave, sir.

671
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,960
My voice against you.

672
01:11:48,231 --> 01:11:49,562
And sincerity for What it is Worth...

673
01:11:52,568 --> 01:11:56,561
offence at What he says.

674
01:11:57,974 --> 01:12:00,966
Such a man deserves only sympathy.

675
01:12:12,588 --> 01:12:14,579
By noW that one of his men...

676
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:20,585
...is hand-in-glove With me.

677
01:12:21,264 --> 01:12:25,394
- I'm a smart guy, sir.

678
01:12:26,269 --> 01:12:29,261
But it Wasn't me!

679
01:12:29,605 --> 01:12:31,596
He unleashed a storm on poor Geeta!

680
01:12:33,009 --> 01:12:34,601
With you somewhere.

681
01:12:36,012 --> 01:12:39,004
She is in league With you!

682
01:12:39,282 --> 01:12:40,613
Crucial information to you!

683
01:12:41,284 --> 01:12:43,275
That's it! He promptly sacked her!

684
01:12:45,021 --> 01:12:47,012
- Come along!

685
01:12:51,294 --> 01:12:53,626
What misbehaviour is this?!

686
01:12:53,963 --> 01:12:55,624
Bring your tenders to me...

687
01:12:57,033 --> 01:13:00,025
...for a handful of money.

688
01:13:01,037 --> 01:13:03,028
Sacked an honest girl!

689
01:13:04,307 --> 01:13:06,298
This is the culprit!

690
01:13:07,643 --> 01:13:10,043
What is this I hear, Bhandari?

691
01:13:23,659 --> 01:13:26,127
In this office again!

692
01:13:26,228 --> 01:13:31,666
We ought to thank you, Mr Vijay.

693
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:34,659
That's not necessary.

694
01:13:35,338 --> 01:13:36,669
Relationship With Miss Geeta...

695
01:13:37,673 --> 01:13:42,076
take the blame for my sake.

696
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:45,270
To do all this?

697
01:13:46,082 --> 01:13:48,073
Bhandari Was helping you.

698
01:13:48,351 --> 01:13:51,343
Iosses, by exposing him?

699
01:13:53,089 --> 01:13:56,081
Are above gains and losses.

700
01:13:57,093 --> 01:13:59,357
Alas! Not everybody realises it.

701
01:14:16,379 --> 01:14:18,370
Discuss With you, Geeta.

702
01:14:20,116 --> 01:14:22,107
Which is Why I Wanted to meet you.

703
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:27,382
What are you doing noWadays?

704
01:14:27,723 --> 01:14:30,715
Work at nothing, Work Wonders!

705
01:14:31,394 --> 01:14:33,385
Wonders noWadays!

706
01:14:40,136 --> 01:14:42,127
Will you Work With me?

707
01:14:45,408 --> 01:14:47,399
Why are you offering me a job?

708
01:14:48,144 --> 01:14:52,080
For me losing my job, right?

709
01:14:52,148 --> 01:14:54,742
No. That is not the reason.

710
01:14:57,153 --> 01:15:00,145
GroWing and expanding...

711
01:15:01,424 --> 01:15:05,155
I have a long Way to go.

712
01:15:06,762 --> 01:15:08,593

714
01:15:10,766 --> 01:15:12,757
other sign board of its kind.

715
01:15:17,173 --> 01:15:19,164
Etched in the skies.

716
01:15:22,778 --> 01:15:24,769
I can achieve all that, Geeta.

717
01:15:26,782 --> 01:15:31,185
Workers to help me achieve my goal.

718
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:38,183
Ioyal and hardWorking than you are?

719
01:15:39,462 --> 01:15:41,453

720
01:15:42,465 --> 01:15:47,801
More passionate about his Work.

721
01:15:47,937 --> 01:15:49,928
My question.

01:15:50,806 --> 01:15:52,797
Office open every morning?

723
01:15:53,476 --> 01:15:57,810
There is no closing time.

724
01:16:18,501 --> 01:16:20,492
The estimates are ready.

725
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:30,843
And type them for me.

726
01:16:32,848 --> 01:16:34,839
Elevation plan already?

727
01:16:36,252 --> 01:16:37,844
He's doing it.

728
01:16:38,254 --> 01:16:40,245
Take a short break...

729
01:16:41,257 --> 01:16:42,690
Rest for a While.

730
01:16:43,259 --> 01:16:46,854
It should be sent tomorroW.

731
01:16:48,264 --> 01:16:49,856
Before the deadline.

732
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:53,861
What's the hurry? We have time.

733
01:16:55,538 --> 01:16:59,872
No, Geeta. I have no time at all.

734
01:17:02,545 --> 01:17:04,536
I'm in a very great hurry.

735
01:17:05,548 --> 01:17:06,879
Achieved in 25 years...

736
01:17:07,883 --> 01:17:10,283

Everything Will be taken care of.

Our host, Mr Vijay!

750
01:19:59,722 --> 01:20:01,713
- That's right.

751
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:06,053
But I have never met you earlier.

752
01:20:07,463 --> 01:20:10,057
A lot about you.

753
01:20:10,733 --> 01:20:11,893
- Just that...

754
01:20:12,568 --> 01:20:15,560

I alWays get it.

756
01:20:22,478 --> 01:20:25,072
Of confidence in yourself?

757
01:20:26,482 --> 01:20:28,473
Much more than you can imagine.

758
01:20:31,487 --> 01:20:33,478
Mr Varma's daughter. Or...

759
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:36,921
My drink is over.

760
01:20:37,092 --> 01:20:39,083
If you permit me...

761
01:21:23,533 --> 01:21:25,524
I don't usually attend parties.

762
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:28,534

Attend the party or not.

767

01:21:51,561 --> 01:21:52,892
I Would certainly have come.

769
01:21:53,897 --> 01:21:54,886

He oWes you.

778
01:22:28,332 --> 01:22:32,928
That's the last Word!

779
01:22:33,603 --> 01:22:35,594
He Will certainly do it!

780
01:22:59,363 --> 01:23:01,354
- Yes, sir.

781
01:23:02,632 --> 01:23:05,362

01:23:21,485 --> 01:23:24,648
That you'd change so much.

785
01:23:25,722 --> 01:23:28,987
Had such bad habits earlier!

786
01:23:29,493 --> 01:23:31,984
When you talk like this?

787
01:23:32,295 --> 01:23:35,662
HoW do I look?

788
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,800
What does that mean?

789
01:23:41,071 --> 01:23:45,405
It means...

790
01:23:45,809 --> 01:23:49,006
That should make headlines!

791
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,410
Propagating a new language!

792
01:23:54,017 --> 01:23:56,417
Whose first Words are...

793
01:23:57,020 --> 01:24:00,012
The next Words are...

794
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,872
if not With me, Bhandari?

795
01:27:16,219 --> 01:27:22,886
Have something against R.K. Gupta.

796

To grind against R.K. Gupta?

797
01:27:27,631 --> 01:27:30,623
Right from the times...

798
01:27:31,901 --> 01:27:35,234
in Mr Deendayal's company.

799
01:27:35,505 --> 01:27:38,235
It's good enough.

800
01:27:39,909 --> 01:27:42,241
For about 4 lakh of Rupees.

801
01:27:47,917 --> 01:27:49,908
Being auctioned aWay?

802

Slip out of our hands.

814
01:28:53,983 --> 01:28:57,316
In business, Sinha...

815
01:28:58,321 --> 01:29:00,312
...not your emotions.

816
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,321
Worth 4 or 5 lakhs...

817
01:29:03,326 --> 01:29:07,990
just to spite someone?

818
01:29:09,999 --> 01:29:11,990
No... this is no business.

819
01:29:13,837 --> 01:29:18,331
Of Mr Vijay Kumar outbidding you.

820
01:29:20,744 --> 01:29:24,737
NoW... he's into something else...

821
01:29:26,349 --> 01:29:27,839
Why is he doing it?

822
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:05,384
Construction starts tomorroW.

823
01:30:15,398 --> 01:30:18,390
Appear to be pretty close.

824
01:30:20,804 --> 01:30:22,795
They indeed are.

825
01:30:23,807 --> 01:30:25,240
A split between them...

826
01:30:25,809 --> 01:30:28,073
Shekhar a lot of discomfort.

827
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:32,411
The cause of the split.

828
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:37,075
What are you getting at?

829
01:30:39,422 --> 01:30:44,416
Honour from R.K. Gupta's family...

830
01:30:46,095 --> 01:30:51,089
their smiles and happiness.

831
01:30:54,437 --> 01:30:58,840
He must not get her.

832
01:30:59,943 --> 01:31:03,106
Of Mr R.K. Gupta in business.

833
01:31:03,847 --> 01:31:05,439
The rivalry to such extremes!

834
01:31:08,451 --> 01:31:09,440
Son's personal life...

835
01:31:10,453 --> 01:31:14,446
Iove and War, Geeta!

836
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:16,289
No matter What you say...

837
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,450
between Shekhar and Sheetal...

838
01:31:20,463 --> 01:31:21,452
With Mr R.K. Gupta...

839
01:31:24,467 --> 01:31:26,458
legitimate exdcuse.

840
01:31:28,137 --> 01:31:33,871
Is illegitimate or legitimate.

841
01:31:38,147 --> 01:31:42,140
Tell her that I Wish to see her.

842
01:31:42,552 --> 01:31:44,884
The other day...

843
01:31:45,488 --> 01:31:47,479
are normally very boring.

844
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:49,480
A party again?

845
01:31:50,493 --> 01:31:51,482
You find your photographs?

846
01:31:53,162 --> 01:31:55,892
Reflect What I look like!

847
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,891
No Wonder, they look good.

848
01:32:00,169 --> 01:32:02,160
You. Won't you offer me some tea?

849
01:32:02,906 --> 01:32:04,897
The tea is here!

850
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,320
- Why?

851
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:25,183
Building tomorroW morning.

852
01:32:26,195 --> 01:32:30,529
- Stone With your lucky hands.

853
01:32:30,934 --> 01:32:32,925
I?! You must be joking!

854
01:32:33,536 --> 01:32:35,527
That's the preserve of celebrities.

855
01:32:36,205 --> 01:32:39,538
My friends are my celebrities.

856
01:32:39,943 --> 01:32:42,537
I can't do it!

857
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:48,542
I look for you inside...

859
01:32:51,554 --> 01:32:55,217
Vijay has landed me in a dilemma.

860
01:32:56,225 --> 01:32:57,556
I see! And What is the dilemma?

861
01:32:58,227 --> 01:32:59,558

866
01:33:14,577 --> 01:33:15,566

Slip out of my hands.

Has he gone crazy, then?

923
02:09:03,521 --> 02:09:05,921
Why he's doing this!

for their dues.

952
02:11:08,178 --> 02:11:09,509
Rats are the first...

953
02:11:11,181 --> 02:11:15,174
...to desert a sinking ship.

954
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:17,509
Don't realise...

...that I'm no sinking ship!

956

But tell me something, Mr Gupta.

967
02:12:40,604 --> 02:12:43,596
In a round-about manner?

968
02:12:45,275 --> 02:12:47,266

Find his corpse.

971
02:13:00,023 --> 02:13:03,288
No, BalWant. That is not necessary.

972
02:13:04,027 --> 02:13:09,624
It's enough for me to prevent Vijay

973
02:13:11,034 --> 02:13:15,630
Constructions shut doWn.

974
02:13:16,306 --> 02:13:18,638
Shortage of cement in the market?

975
02:13:20,644 --> 02:13:23,636
The agency for cement.

976

His stocks in his godoWns.

977
02:13:31,054 --> 02:13:32,646

to us even at increased prices.

979

We do have some stocks.

980
02:13:41,064 --> 02:13:42,326
But if the situation continues...

981
02:13:43,066 --> 02:13:46,058
on a couple of buildings.

982
02:13:47,671 --> 02:13:51,334
Never stop our Work!

983
02:13:52,676 --> 02:13:54,667
Whom are you calling?

984
02:14:07,090 --> 02:14:08,682

For all this, Bhandari!

991

Against you...

1030
02:18:58,648 --> 02:18:59,637
you have done to me...

1031
02:19:00,650 --> 02:19:02,515
...go and question your father!

1032
02:19:03,653 --> 02:19:07,487
To see today, Shekhar.

1033
02:19:08,658 --> 02:19:09,989
Not have minded...

1034
02:19:10,994 --> 02:19:14,987
Bubbly is Vijay's sister, too.

1035
02:19:16,666 --> 02:19:21,000
Vijay is your brother.

1036
02:20:02,045 --> 02:20:04,036
What's the matter?

1037
02:20:04,447 --> 02:20:07,041
Going at his hour?

1038
02:20:09,452 --> 02:20:11,716
We're leaving this house, Daddy.

1039
02:20:11,788 --> 02:20:14,450
What is all this about?

1040
02:20:21,731 --> 02:20:26,065
Nor Which you can bear to hear.

1041
02:20:27,737 --> 02:20:30,467
Without any discussion.

1042
02:20:33,476 --> 02:20:35,467
Bubbly is leaving With me.

1043
02:20:36,746 --> 02:20:40,079
As she Wants to.

1044
02:20:42,085 --> 02:20:45,077
Choose her companion for life.

1045
02:20:50,093 --> 02:20:52,493
Before you leave.

1046
02:20:53,496 --> 02:20:55,088
This house in this manner...

1047
02:20:56,766 --> 02:20:59,098
be alloWed to return.

1048
02:20:59,769 --> 02:21:02,499
To this house anymore!

1049
02:21:05,508 --> 02:21:08,500
In this house all these days.

1050
02:21:11,114 --> 02:21:12,103
When I think of it...

1051
02:21:13,783 --> 02:21:16,775
enjoy the luxuries in this family?

1052
02:21:19,122 --> 02:21:22,523
This house to return.

1053
02:21:22,926 --> 02:21:24,917
Let's go.

1054
02:21:34,137 --> 02:21:36,128
Can I leave noW, Vijay?

1055
02:21:38,808 --> 02:21:40,799
Please stay for some more time.

1056
02:21:42,145 --> 02:21:44,136
I'm feeling very uneasy.

1057
02:21:45,815 --> 02:21:49,808
Even more lonely.

1058
02:21:52,555 --> 02:21:54,546
To be a loner.

1059
02:21:55,825 --> 02:21:59,556
Only on hatred and malice.

1060
02:22:01,564 --> 02:22:07,560
For her love and affection...

1061
02:22:11,574 --> 02:22:16,568
and affection...

1062
02:22:18,581 --> 02:22:20,572
...from you today, Geeta.

1063
02:23:00,623 --> 02:23:02,614
Married tomorroW.

1064
02:23:04,227 --> 02:23:06,218
In the ceremony.

1065
02:23:08,631 --> 02:23:12,624
His house and against his Wishes.

1066
02:23:15,638 --> 02:23:16,900
Tell you is that...

1067
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:19,631
attend the Wedding tomorroW.

1068
02:23:22,645 --> 02:23:27,241
Because, in the father's absence...

1069
02:23:29,252 --> 02:23:32,915
Who gives aWay the bride.

1070
02:23:36,926 --> 02:23:40,760
I Will... I Will certainly come.

1071
02:23:42,932 --> 02:23:44,923
I Will...

1072
02:23:53,776 --> 02:23:58,270
Many congratulations to you!

1073
02:24:01,284 --> 02:24:03,275
In my Wounds, have you?

1074
02:24:03,953 --> 02:24:06,285
Has given you the Wounds...

1075
02:24:08,291 --> 02:24:10,691
in them, too.

1076
02:24:13,296 --> 02:24:14,285
Wife, your son and your daughter...

1077
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:19,691
at this moment.

1078
02:24:23,306 --> 02:24:25,297
With Vijay Kumar?

1079
02:24:27,977 --> 02:24:30,969
Me for that?

1080
02:24:31,814 --> 02:24:32,644
No, sir.

1081
02:24:33,816 --> 02:24:36,307
On your daughter's Wedding.

1082
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:39,311
By Vijay Kumar himself.

1083
02:24:40,723 --> 02:24:42,315
Bhandari has brought news that...

1084
02:24:43,126 --> 02:24:47,995

1085
02:24:49,999 --> 02:24:51,990
I heard of it, too.

1086
02:24:53,336 --> 02:24:57,329
Has cast on your family...

1087
02:24:58,341 --> 02:25:02,744
turned against you!

1088
02:25:04,013 --> 02:25:05,002
Of my daughter's Wedding...

1089
02:25:06,015 --> 02:25:08,006
...While I'm still alive?

1090
02:25:08,751 --> 02:25:10,742
While I'm still around?

1091
02:25:11,354 --> 02:25:12,343
I knoW What he's getting at!

1092
02:25:13,356 --> 02:25:15,347
To humiliate me!

1093
02:25:16,359 --> 02:25:19,021
Not at any cost!

1094
02:25:21,030 --> 02:25:23,021
The costs can be Worked out.

1095
02:25:24,033 --> 02:25:27,025
You just need to tell us, Mr Gupta.

1096
02:25:31,374 --> 02:25:35,777
Remove this thorn from my path.

1097
02:25:37,046 --> 02:25:39,037
So... name the price!

1098
02:25:42,051 --> 02:25:44,042
5 lakhs.

1099
02:25:44,387 --> 02:25:47,720
As for Vijay Kumar, he...

1100
02:25:47,790 --> 02:25:51,385
He must not live anymore!

1101
02:25:52,795 --> 02:25:54,786
He Won't.

1102
02:25:55,064 --> 02:25:57,396
Rest assured, Mr Gupta...

1103
02:26:00,803 --> 02:26:03,067
not live anymore.

1104
02:26:03,506 --> 02:26:05,497
Here you are.

1105
02:26:10,213 --> 02:26:11,407
And promissory notes...

1106
02:26:12,815 --> 02:26:14,806
...issued by Mr R.K. Gupta.

1107
02:26:15,418 --> 02:26:16,407
With these documents noW...

1108
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:20,082
auctioned in a day!

1109
02:26:37,106 --> 02:26:39,097
Who is that?

1110
02:26:46,449 --> 02:26:49,850
You?! HoW dare you come here?

1111
02:26:50,853 --> 02:26:54,118
What more do you Want?

1112
02:26:55,124 --> 02:26:57,115
Of many years!

1113
02:26:57,860 --> 02:26:59,851
For every penny!

1114
02:27:00,463 --> 02:27:02,454
My family life!

1115
02:27:02,865 --> 02:27:05,857
And children have deserted me!

1116
02:27:06,135 --> 02:27:08,126
It Was only because of you!

1117
02:27:08,871 --> 02:27:12,864
Don't blame me for your follies.

1118
02:27:14,143 --> 02:27:15,474
Treading the path you chose

1119
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:21,473
at the end of the journey.

1120
02:27:21,884 --> 02:27:25,980
Which one had I chosen?!

1121
02:27:26,889 --> 02:27:28,880
Any of your nonsense!

1122
02:27:29,158 --> 02:27:31,149
Yes. You can't understand this.

1123
02:27:31,494 --> 02:27:32,483
Because this is not business.

1124
02:27:33,496 --> 02:27:37,489
That is not business, Mr. Gupta.

1125
02:27:39,168 --> 02:27:40,499
Never understand the Woman...

1126
02:27:41,904 --> 02:27:43,496
and her affection...

1127
02:27:44,907 --> 02:27:47,171
Wasn't business.

1128
02:27:49,912 --> 02:27:51,903
Who are you talking about?

1129
02:27:52,515 --> 02:27:58,181
I'm talking about Shanti.

1130
02:28:00,089 --> 02:28:01,522
Of your life...

1131
02:28:03,192 --> 02:28:05,183
a counterfeit coin.

1132
02:28:06,329 --> 02:28:07,523
You used...

1133
02:28:08,531 --> 02:28:10,522
...as a ladder to your success!

1134
02:28:11,934 --> 02:28:13,526
I talk about...

1135
02:28:13,936 --> 02:28:15,528
to ask Why you did that to her...

1136
02:28:17,039 --> 02:28:19,030
have to Wrong her?!

1137
02:28:19,942 --> 02:28:22,934
About, Mr R.K. Gupta!

1138
02:28:25,214 --> 02:28:27,205
But hoW do you knoW of all this?

1139
02:28:29,218 --> 02:28:31,209
Mr R.K. Gupta.

1140
02:28:34,557 --> 02:28:38,550
The anguish in her heart...

1141
02:28:40,563 --> 02:28:43,225
the bad-name she got...

1142
02:28:44,233 --> 02:28:46,565
and the tatters she lived in...

1143
02:28:48,237 --> 02:28:51,968
And I remember it, too.

1144
02:28:54,243 --> 02:28:56,234
You had killed her soul.

1145
02:28:56,979 --> 02:28:59,243
Only 25 years later.

1146
02:29:00,249 --> 02:29:03,241
Still rages in my heart...

1147
02:29:03,586 --> 02:29:07,579
cursed Shanti's son...

1148
02:29:08,591 --> 02:29:10,991
illegitimate father!

1149
02:29:16,599 --> 02:29:18,590
Natural justice.

1150
02:29:20,002 --> 02:29:22,596
In consideration of Wealth...

1151
02:29:23,606 --> 02:29:25,597
has deserted you today!

1152
02:29:26,275 --> 02:29:29,608
Here's all your Wealth.

1153
02:29:30,279 --> 02:29:34,272
But poverty and shame.

1154
02:29:35,618 --> 02:29:37,609
Of my mother...

1155
02:29:39,288 --> 02:29:41,279
...return all your Wealth to you.

1156
02:29:48,297 --> 02:29:50,288
You have all your Wealth today.

1157
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:54,030
Poorer man in my life!

1158
02:30:28,337 --> 02:30:29,668
- He's not in.

1159
02:30:31,073 --> 02:30:33,064
But there's a message for you.

1160
02:30:33,342 --> 02:30:34,331
By 10 tonight...

1161
02:30:35,344 --> 02:30:37,335
...your job Will be completed.

1162
02:30:48,691 --> 02:30:49,680
Who are you?

1163
02:30:50,693 --> 02:30:54,094
Let's go!

1164
02:30:54,763 --> 02:30:56,754
Have you sent someone, Mom?

1165
02:30:57,099 --> 02:31:00,091
I told him several times.

1166
02:31:00,703 --> 02:31:03,365
There's no sign of the groom.

1167
02:31:03,706 --> 02:31:06,368
No sense of responsibility!

1168
02:31:15,518 --> 02:31:17,713
In our custody.

1169
02:31:18,387 --> 02:31:19,718
Safe and sound...

1170
02:31:21,724 --> 02:31:27,526
take him aWay from Pragati Maidan.

1171
02:31:27,796 --> 02:31:30,731
To talk like this?

1172
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:33,528
In killing Ravi!

1173
02:31:34,403 --> 02:31:35,734
So just go and tell Vijay Kumar...

1174
02:31:36,739 --> 02:31:37,728
to save your fiance...

1175
02:31:39,408 --> 02:31:41,399
...he must rush here immediately.

1176
02:31:41,744 --> 02:31:45,407
Of reporting this to the police!

1177
02:31:46,415 --> 02:31:47,746
Out of nervousness...

1178
02:31:48,417 --> 02:31:50,408
Without any reason.

1179
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:56,414
Only for Vijay Kumar's ears.

1180
02:32:01,163 --> 02:32:03,154
Brother!

1181
02:32:12,775 --> 02:32:15,175
Take him there, Gangu.

1182
02:32:15,578 --> 02:32:19,173
You married to Ravi.

1183
02:32:20,783 --> 02:32:21,772
By calling me brother today...

1184
02:32:22,785 --> 02:32:24,776
...you have sanctified my oath.

1185
02:32:26,188 --> 02:32:29,453
Do any harm to Ravi!

1186
02:32:59,488 --> 02:33:01,479
This is perhaps my punishment.

1187
02:33:02,825 --> 02:33:04,816
I Want to apologise to you today...

1188
02:33:06,495 --> 02:33:10,488
to grant me pardon.

1189
02:33:10,833 --> 02:33:15,827
Like a blind man?

1190
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:24,509
Sent your son... my son...

1191
02:33:26,515 --> 02:33:28,506
...into the jaWs of death!

1192
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:33,511
But I give you my Word, Shanti...

1193
02:33:35,524 --> 02:33:39,858
That is a promise.

1194
02:33:43,265 --> 02:33:46,860
Forgive me...

1195
02:33:49,538 --> 02:33:51,529
...please forgive me.

1196
02:34:27,274 --> 02:34:28,866
I have arrived!

1197
02:34:29,276 --> 02:34:32,541
One smart move from you...

1198
02:34:34,281 --> 02:34:36,545
his brains apart!

1199
02:34:38,552 --> 02:34:41,885
And quietly come doWn.

1200
02:34:55,703 --> 02:34:57,694
That's more like it.

1201
02:34:59,573 --> 02:35:03,907
HoW's your business coming along?

1202
02:35:05,913 --> 02:35:09,314
Fulfill your condition.

1203
02:35:10,918 --> 02:35:14,581
- Sure, I'll let him go.

1204
02:35:17,324 --> 02:35:19,918
My scores With you.

1205
02:35:22,430 --> 02:35:24,421
No! You can't do that!

1206
02:35:25,332 --> 02:35:26,924
Your hand...

1207
02:35:28,602 --> 02:35:32,595
through Ravi's head! Get it?

1208
02:35:34,141 --> 02:35:37,599
You landed me the other day.

1209
02:35:41,348 --> 02:35:44,340
On the slap you gave me.

1210
02:35:45,619 --> 02:35:48,952
Iosing your temper today?

1211
02:35:49,123 --> 02:35:51,455
Silently, aren't you?

1212
02:35:53,627 --> 02:35:58,621
Let Ravi go.

1213
02:36:01,969 --> 02:36:06,963
Of course, I'll let him go.

1214
02:38:21,508 --> 02:38:24,500
Tie them up! I'll fix them!

1215
02:38:32,119 --> 02:38:35,520
You are late.

1216
02:38:36,790 --> 02:38:40,521
There he is.

1217
02:38:49,803 --> 02:38:53,136
Shekhar here, too, isn't it?

1218
02:38:54,141 --> 02:38:56,132
So Was I.

1219
02:38:56,543 --> 02:38:58,135
Cast on your son...

1220
02:38:59,146 --> 02:39:01,137

1221
02:39:02,149 --> 02:39:05,812
Set your son free.

02:39:08,555 --> 02:39:11,149
Let me have the briefcase.

1223
02:39:12,826 --> 02:39:14,817
It's 5 lakhs, isn't it?

1224
02:39:39,853 --> 02:39:40,842
What are you doing, Daddy?!

1225
02:39:41,855 --> 02:39:43,846
You ought to untie Vijay first!

1226
02:39:44,191 --> 02:39:46,182
You don't knoW...

1227
02:39:46,593 --> 02:39:48,584
I knoW everything!

1228
02:39:52,933 --> 02:39:54,924
Grab him!

1229
02:40:25,232 --> 02:40:29,225
For 5 lakh Rupees.

1230
02:40:30,637 --> 02:40:34,903
The right to kill him.

1231
02:40:36,243 --> 02:40:39,906
I denied you the pleasure?

1232
02:40:40,914 --> 02:40:43,246
Here you are... the revolver.

1233
02:40:44,651 --> 02:40:46,642
And there is Vijay.

1234
02:40:47,254 --> 02:40:51,418
Squeezing the trigger at your target.

1235
02:40:54,661 --> 02:41:00,065
Have such sympathy for Vijay?

1236
02:41:00,634 --> 02:41:03,262
Don't knoW the fact...

1237
02:41:05,272 --> 02:41:08,264
...that Vijay is my son.

1238
02:41:09,676 --> 02:41:11,667
Vijay is my son!

1239
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:18,274
Back home With me.

1240
02:41:19,686 --> 02:41:22,280
By the police.

1241
02:41:24,291 --> 02:41:28,694
Are you in your senses?!

1242
02:41:29,696 --> 02:41:33,689
That I have come to my senses.

1243
02:41:34,101 --> 02:41:36,797
I'm proud of you, Daddy.

1244
02:41:37,971 --> 02:41:40,701
Set your brother free, Shekhar.

1245
02:41:46,313 --> 02:41:49,976
Urge to embrace Vijay as your son.

1246
02:41:51,318 --> 02:41:54,719
Without having my revenge.

1247
02:41:55,722 --> 02:42:00,318
Move from Where you stand.

1248
02:42:03,997 --> 02:42:06,727
My son...

1249
02:42:09,736 --> 02:42:11,328
- Daddy!

1250
02:42:23,016 --> 02:42:25,007
Beat them up!

1251
02:42:49,776 --> 02:42:51,767
What... have you done?!

1252
02:42:53,380 --> 02:42:54,369
To the hospital!

1253
02:42:55,382 --> 02:42:58,044
That much of time!

1254
02:42:58,385 --> 02:43:01,377
You've lost a lot of blood.

1255
02:43:02,055 --> 02:43:04,046
Let the blood floW, my son...

1256
02:43:04,391 --> 02:43:08,384
Wash aWay my sins.

1257
02:43:10,797 --> 02:43:15,393
I am responsible to you, my son.

1258
02:43:17,070 --> 02:43:18,401
But my sins must not cloud...

1259
02:43:20,073 --> 02:43:24,066
...your relationship With Shekhar.

1260
02:43:26,813 --> 02:43:31,216
Seek your forgiveness, my son.

1261
02:43:32,419 --> 02:43:34,410
But...

1262
02:43:36,823 --> 02:43:41,419
...do forgive me, if you can...
