I will open a bottle for you

4
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,513
Your death Is a flame

5
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,830
that will never go out

6
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,473
Luis, come here.

7
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,354
Have you seen Caco?

8
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,639
Here, for your mother.

9
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,195
Look after Pepa's tomb.

10
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,477
Tres, the bottle!

11
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,351
Alejandro,
the steeple needs repairing.

12
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,959
I'll see to it.

13
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,799
Alejandro!

14
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,474
YoU will BE AVENGED

15
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,910
Not again! where's Diego?

16
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,629
what's the matter?

17
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,910
where's Diego?

18
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,878
Asleep. what is it, boy?

19
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,589
Uncle!

20
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,513
Let me go out.

21
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,756
I want to have a good time.

22
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,520
No, stay in your room.

23
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,717
I want to go out.

24
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,473
when I say you can.

25
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,635
Alejandro!

26
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,355
Pepe there?

27
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,629
Tell him to come.

28
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,195
How are things?

29
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,197
The money

30
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,708
and the list.

31
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,677
I've got somebody

32
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,229
to buy your part of "El Rey."

33
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,589
Yeah, who?

34
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,549
He wants to remain anonymous.

35
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,879
lt's not the Caravacas?

36
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,674
If it's that scumbag family,

37
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,870
I'd rather torch the place.

38
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,357
Got that? I won't have anything
to do with them!

39
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,714
oK, Pepe...

40
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,595
See you later.

41
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,593
'Bye, kid.

42
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,752
Hey, Fernando.

43
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,359
How's it going, Caco?

44
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,191
You know my nephew?

45
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,798
My brother Mario's kid.

46
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,309
- He's tall!
- You still managing La Caita?

47
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,554
- Can you contact her for tonight?
- Sure.

48
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,593
I wanna arrange a party for the kid.

49
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,153
He just loves La Caita.

50
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,833
Tonight, at "La Venta."

51
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,232
And the musicians' pay?

52
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,155
See my cousin Alejandro about that.

53
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,238
You two work it out.
Good to see you, man.

54
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,238
So, Catalana?

55
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,948
How you doing?

56
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,515
You oK?

57
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,838
Listen, Catalana,

58
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,389
I got a special favor to ask you.

59
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,950
It means a lot to me.

60
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,836
I'm here with my nephew.

61
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,193
I want you do to something,
and do it really well.

62
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,640
If you do it, I'll never forget it.

63
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,519
Not professional.

64
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,792
If you do it professionally,
don't bother.

65
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,792
My nephew Diego... La Catalana.

66
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,319
what'll you have?

67
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,635
A pint.

68
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,796
Lolo, a pint and a gin.

69
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,393
How are you, Diego?

70
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,555
Fine.

71
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,829
Say...

72
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,756
wanna stay with me a while?

73
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,678
Gotta do an errand.

74
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,598
I'll just be 30 minutes.

75
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,233
oK, 45 minutes.

76
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,509
Don't you go away.
See you in a bit.

77
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,915
See you later, uncle.

78
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,031
Don't mind staying with me?

79
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,917
what do you like best about me?

80
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,719
Your eyes.

81
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,350
You have lovely eyes, you know?

82
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,432
You're...

83
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,478
real beautiful.

84
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,551
I really like to have a good time.

85
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,194
Do you?

86
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,154
- And women...
- Really?

87
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,554
...like you.

88
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,155
No one ever said that like you.

89
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,035
You look a lot like...

90
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,071
- Like who?
- Like Pepa.

91
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,274
who's Pepa?

92
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,275
My uncle's daughter.

93
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,995
- You like Pepa?
- A lot.

94
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,552
- And me, too?
- Yeah.

95
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,355
- How much?
- A lot.

96
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,954
Tell me more.

97
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,679
Pepa...

98
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,350
is dead.

99
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,589
See that?

100
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,636
one hell of a woman!

101
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,634
Hey, "Bunny"!

102
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,149
I weep for Tokyo

103
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,355
"Bunny"!

104
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,679
Caco wants you.

105
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,997
Caco wants you.

106
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,796
Caco wants you, Bunny.

107
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,832
A real mouthful!

108
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,271
I prefer a dildo.

109
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,352
And you, honey?

110
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,516
Look at her body.

111
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,153
Just skin and bones.

112
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,032
And you get fatter and fatter.

113
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,195
who asked you?

114
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,958
Come to your uncle.

115
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,508
So, got anything to tell me?

116
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,509
No?

117
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,279
And I bother bringing you
to Seville!

118
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,356
I can't believe this!

119
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,592
Nothing to tell me?

120
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,392
You ashamed?

121
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,118
How did it go with the girl?

122
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,357
Don't wanna tell me?
what happened?

123
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,039
It was good

124
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,396
but it wasn't love.

125
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,033
It wasn't love?

126
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,909
That ass, those breasts...
what d'you call that?

127
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,113
what more do you want?
Cut it out, fella.

128
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,918
You got your rocks off.

129
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,949
You want a woman just for yourself,
who stays at home?

130
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,033
It wasn't love.

131
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,152
Shit, you're too much!

132
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,717
In the street of wlnds
I devoured you

133
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,877
Down to your beauty mark

134
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,675
In the street of wlnds

135
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,799
In the street of hurly-burly

136
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,077
Your body and mlne

137
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,151
Came together

138
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,276
La Caita, pure gypsy!

139
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,198
You know I love you.

140
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,238
I love you a lot.

141
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,479
Hurray for art!

142
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,073
Hurray for flamenco!

143
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,117
True flamenco!

144
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,632
Alma, join us!

145
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,992
Dance with my nephew.

146
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,349
Pepa,

147
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,878
my little girl...

148
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,712
Your death burns me.

149
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,270
what's the matter?

150
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,754
Listen.

151
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,513
This tree's got duende.
Sounds like a lament.

152
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,237
This tree's got duende.

153
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,192
It sings like El Chocolate.

154
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,229
Uncle,

155
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,718
we found Pepa's favorite tape.

156
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,956
Play it for me.

157
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,999
Let me...

158
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,910
who's singing?

159
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,193
I dunno.

160
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,510
when she listened to it,

161
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,038
she always used to cry.

162
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,956
Enjoy the party the other night?

163
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,955
what group d'you want next time?

164
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,877
Las Cigalas from Jerez.

165
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,198
Ask Alejandro and Antonio
to bring them.

166
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,475
what're you doing here?

167
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,797
Anselmo, I told you
never to leave him alone!

168
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,554
My uncle

169
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,675
wants you to get this group
for the party.

170
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,271
oK, I'll handle it.

171
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,672
what is it, Alejandro?

172
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,353
Caco wants this group.

173
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,477
I just saw...

174
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,875
some terrific looking girls!

175
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,392
Long live Andalusia!

176
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,312
we had a few glasses.

177
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,913
what artistry!

178
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,715
She's so beautiful!

179
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,239
Porinas was one hell of a singer.

180
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,635
The best

181
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,400
was Camarón.

182
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,829
oK, but Porinas was the best
in the Extremadura region.

183
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,598
Yeah, but...

184
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,031
the best was Camarón.

185
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,552
These flowers!

186
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,274
They're all faded!

187
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,110
See these flowers, Mercedes?

188
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,278
lt's a soulless garden.

189
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,473
They're fading.

190
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,194
Be quiet, my uncle's sleeping.

191
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,196
All right.

192
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,273
SANDRo, YoU will BE AVENGED

193
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,388
Someone scrawled
over the walls of my village.

194
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,999
It wasn't us.

195
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,875
They wrote:
"Sandro, you will be avenged."

196
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,395
Lots of people liked Sandro.

197
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,432
My brother had lots of friends.

198
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,153
I was fond of him, too.

199
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,920
we want to christen
Sandro's daughter.

200
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,472
what am I supposed to do?

201
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,830
lt's a shame her father's dead.

202
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,274
A real shame.

203
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,479
Your brother Mario

204
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,914
killed Sandro.

205
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,839
where's Mario?

206
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,235
where's your brother?

207
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,391
You go see my brother Mario.

208
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,070
Give him this mobile.
He has to call Diego.

209
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,631
Tell him "m afraid for him.

210
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,397
Give him these 200,000 pesetas.

211
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,754
where is he?

212
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,274
I didn't tell anyone.

213
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,953
Count on me.

214
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,071
At the Atlas Hotel, in Chefchaouen,

215
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,355
in Morocco.

216
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,516
Tell him I care about him.

217
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,069
That we love him.

218
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,880
Aunt Pilar never stops crying.

219
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,154
Diego thinks about him a lot.

220
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,156
It feels like rain.

221
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,952
lt's good for the soil.

222
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,114
I am jealous

223
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,753
of the rlver

224
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,873
Whlch reflects your face

225
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,592
I don't feel up

226
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,598
to my songs

227
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,078
I don't feel up to my thoughts

228
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,551
I don't know what It Is

229
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,796
But "m really stuck on,,,

230
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,629
The one-armed crlpple's face

231
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,108
C'mon...

232
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,673
Tell your uncle.

233
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,718
I was really in love with Pepa.

234
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,389
You were?

235
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,993
Really in love.

236
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,157
- Did you tell her?
- I didn't say anything.

237
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,118
Let's change the subject.

238
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,153
Uncle...

239
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,389
I'm worried.

240
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,794
what about?

241
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,117
Because there's a rumor going 'round

242
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,876
that the Caravacas

243
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,116
want to kill me.

244
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,355
what?

245
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,235
who told you that?

246
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,393
lt's not true.

247
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,318
Listen, Diego...

248
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,435
If anyone tries to hurt you,
I'll cut his balls off.

249
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,036
And I'll burn everything down.

250
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,591
Here, Diego...

251
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,754
I'm taking you to a christening.

252
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,039
Put this ring on.
It was Pepa's.

253
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,915
Never take it off. You promise?

254
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,038
Give your uncle a kiss.

255
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,793
Hello? Don't hang up.

256
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,509
I'm trying to pick you up.

257
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,913
Don't hang up.

258
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,194
I'm not receiving you.
I can't hear anything.

259
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,708
Don't hang up.

260
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,559
Alejandro, who is it?

261
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,079
Dunno, Morocco...

262
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,550
Don't hang up. Just a second!

263
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,389
I'm trying to pick you up.

264
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,679
I hear you better now.

265
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,229
Now?

266
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,275
Mario! How you doing?

267
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,989
wait.

268
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,993
Go get the kid!

269
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,589
Tres, go on. Run, quick!

270
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,949
we're always with him,
Tres, Antonio and me.

271
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,912
whatever you say, Mario.

272
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,438
whatever you say.

273
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,471
with him every day.
Caco is never by himself.

274
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,708
Right now?

275
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,588
Know where I am?

276
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,678
In the middle of the road,
the only place I can receive.

277
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,435
Hold on.

278
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,590
Go play Pepa's CD.

279
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,996
Is it winter there yet?

280
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,838
Cloudy skies?

281
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,630
The weather's fine in Andalusia.

282
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,556
Diego is fine, really.

283
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,314
Listen!

284
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,950
I come from nowhere

285
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,038
I have no landscapes

286
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,395
I have no homeland

287
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,391
Wlth my flngers, I can start a flre

288
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,195
Wlth my heart, I slng to you

289
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,315
And my heartstrlngs throb

290
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,188
I was born of love

291
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,512
Beautiful, isn't it?

292
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,359
whenever you want.

293
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,512
No, you can't talk to Caco now.

294
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,116
He's totally smashed.

295
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,632
He can't even talk.

296
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,110
Yeah, he drinks all the time.

297
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,432
Here comes handsome.

298
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,835
I'll put your kid on.

299
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,109
Your father.

300
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,113
Stand here!
This is where you can hear him.

301
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,510
How are you?

302
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,355
I'm oK.

303
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,475
You coming home soon?

304
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,317
I want to see you real soon.

305
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,595
I think...

306
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,071
a lot about you.

307
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,877
I love you, Papa.

308
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,631
The kid's on the phone.

309
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,513
lt's important,
he's talking to his father.

310
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,393
lt's the only place he can hear.

311
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,477
Just a second, please.

312
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,994
'Evening.

313
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,956
Caco, you can't go on board.
The Caravacas are there.

314
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,358
we do as you say.

315
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,994
I don't give a shit about them.

316
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,759
Hey, how are you?

317
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,352
why do you let that family
on board?

318
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,995
Long live Moors!

319
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,713
And pretty women!

320
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,468
She's a whore!

321
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,237
why'd you take his money?

322
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,793
what's that?

323
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,355
It was a gift.

324
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,590
Take it back!

325
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,268
Lay off the Caravacas!

326
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,793
No scandals on my boat!

327
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,110
I don't want any bloodshed here.

328
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,197
You have to leave.

329
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,788
I'm not afraid.

330
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,875
Please don't stay here.

331
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,477
I'm not afraid, I said!

332
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,032
But you're afraid of God.

333
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,951
Not even God.

334
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,355
No one!

335
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,788
Look!

336
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,876
Look!

337
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,514
Get out!

338
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,954
Now get lost!

339
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,593
Alejandro...

340
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,554
You love me...

341
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,791
You understand me, don't you?

342
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,558
Lie down.

343
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,633
Kid!

344
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,879
The Caravacas' bodyguards
want to talk to you.

345
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,278
Good to see you.

346
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,110
I wanna discuss some business

347
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,958
we have to settle with Caco.

348
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,277
You know we've got nothing
against you,

349
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,789
just against Caco.

350
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,878
My brother and I respect you.

351
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,230
You're almost part of the family.

352
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,878
we knew you as a kid.

353
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,755
You know that Mario killed
my brother.

354
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,788
we looked for him everywhere,
in Andalusia and abroad.

355
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,678
Tell us where he is,

356
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,439
or his son will pay.

357
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,318
He has to pay.

358
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,399
Someone will pay
for my brother's death!

359
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,668
- I don't know anything.
- Fine.

360
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,796
Paco, serve him what he wants.

361
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,792
Have something to drink.

362
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,592
Ugly business, eh?

363
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,916
It doesn't concern us.
The Caravacas are our employers...

364
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,708
A beer.

365
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,673
For me, too.

366
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,155
I work for the
Raíz del Cante label

367
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,157
as musical director.

368
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,391
This is our latest CD.

369
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,908
La Paquera of Jerez.
You can have it.

370
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,873
- Tell me what you think.
- For me?

371
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:06,995
You did the sleeve design?

372
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,389
Yeah, "m a graphic artist.

373
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,556
I do the jackets, the posters...

374
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,638
You outdid yourself.

375
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,549
So, kid?

376
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,199
Chatting with the buddies?

377
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,039
we're having a drink
with our pal from Jerez.

378
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,918
Jerez, my ass!

379
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,114
- You're nuts!
- No, you are!

380
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,749
You fools!

381
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,279
You swine!

382
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,389
You got it wrong.

383
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,432
Don't touch me, for chrissake!

384
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,358
You're just dirt!

385
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,354
You and your family!

386
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,395
Sonofabitch!

387
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,194
Get your knife out.

388
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,195
C'mon, get it out!

389
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,953
Someone's gonna get hurt!

390
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,789
He doesn't know a thing.

391
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,350
over here, boys!
There are plenty here.

392
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,754
There are plenty over here.
Come on!

393
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,719
You gonna eat all that?

394
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,310
No, it's to play soccer with.

395
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,670
what's the matter?

396
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,478
Things are getting worse.

397
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,916
Starting to stink.

398
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,794
Children,

399
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,514
it's not nice to play with food.

400
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,192
Hello, cousins!

401
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,276
Alejandro, a cigarette, please.

402
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,469
You oK?

403
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,472
I need a smoke.

404
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,833
what's the matter?

405
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,999
we're going to Jerez tonight

406
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,237
to party...
Tres, Antonio, you and me.

407
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,431
There're gonna be gypsy musicians
and some gorgeous dancers.

408
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,119
we'll bring them here.

409
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,998
I'm gonna throw a party.

410
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,432
A party so grandiose
everybody will be talking about it!

411
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,312
Just to bug the Caravacas.

412
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,511
Know how we'll pay for it?

413
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,159
I sold "El Rey."

414
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,992
To some real hot Germans.

415
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,274
And they paid it all in cash.

416
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,275
I'll give you
15 or 20 thousand pesetas.

417
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,994
You know how, you can organize it.

418
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,231
what's the matter?

419
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,798
what the hel"s the matter?

420
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,998
I've always told you the truth.

421
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,794
Tres found out that the Caravacas

422
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,877
want to hurt Diego.

423
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,433
Hurt Diego?

424
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,078
They want to kill him.

425
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,995
He's Mario's closest kin.

426
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,796
Let them just touch the kid

427
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,633
and I'll torch their casino.

428
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,518
I'm gonna need you.

429
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,755
whatever you want, when you want.

430
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,156
Have pity on me. Just a little.

431
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,512
Just a little bit.

432
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,150
You see how "m suffering.

433
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,632
Help me a little.

434
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,998
May God keep you pure.

435
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,749
Hello, Enrique.

436
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,234
Long llve your motherl

437
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,955
Long llve she who begat youl

438
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,872
who let you in?

439
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,558
Shut up!
we want to talk.

440
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,029
This is a family affair.

441
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,232
we're here as family.
we're in good faith.

442
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,395
Good faith?

443
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,158
I brought my nephew.

444
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,789
- He wants to hear La Paquera.
- Your brother killed mine!

445
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,072
You'd better leave!
This is an insult to us!

446
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,998
- Come over here.
- No way!

447
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,873
Did the women send you?
You a coward?

448
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,513
No, leave!

449
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,474
we have to talk.

450
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,875
- I won't go anywhere with you!
- C'mon.

451
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,833
we don't want to talk to you!

452
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,913
we grew up together.
This has to end.

453
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,519
Not this way.

454
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,951
Your brother is the cause
of all this!

455
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,909
You're just here to piss us off!

456
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,678
No dignity, no tact!

457
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,678
You piece of shit! You swine!

458
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,673
You and your whole family.

459
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,835
Calm down, you lunatic.

460
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,237
I won't calm down.
You know what you've done.

461
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,075
will you calm him down or not?

462
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,398
They're talking.

463
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,117
That's enough! Let them talk.

464
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,916
we're not thugs or animals.

465
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,918
we're not animals!
we're here to talk!

466
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,758
we're not animals!

467
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,391
we just have to wait.

468
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,556
This is a family affair, goddammit!

469
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,273
You're not here to talk,

470
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,959
but to insult us.

471
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,233
You're the animals!

472
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,119
You're animals,

473
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,399
incapable of reason.
You don't understand anything.

474
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,154
our grandfathers were like
two brothers.

475
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,750
Your grandfather and mine worked
the fields together.

476
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,915
Let's stop making
a spectacle of ourselves here.

477
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,269
why?

478
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,836
Know what it cost me to come here?

479
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,113
An arm and a leg!

480
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,356
Think it doesn't cost me anything?

481
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,632
Know what you are?
You're backwards.

482
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,319
You live in another age.

483
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,875
I never should've come to see you.

484
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,752
You're a bird of ill-omen!

485
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,549
He said what?

486
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,634
lt's not gonna be easy.

487
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,999
It will need time.

488
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,639
obviously.

489
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,159
Still, I think we calmed
him down a bit.

490
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,149
- where we right to come?
- Sure.

491
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,718
I hope it was worth it.

492
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,508
Uncle...

493
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:14,510
I really enjoyed the party
the other day.

494
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,516
A lot.

495
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,077
- You always like parties, Diego.
- I sure do.

496
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,679
Pull over here.

497
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,552
I'm getting out here.

498
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,678
I need to be alone.

499
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,149
with Pepa.

500
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:45,591
You sure you'll be all right?

501
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,599
Sure, "m sure. Everything's fine.

502
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,995
- Really?
- with you "m always fine.

503
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,555
- Not lying to me?
- Not at all!

504
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:54,835
Give me a kiss.

505
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,869
Goodbye.

506
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,637
Is he really all right?

507
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,750
Yeah.

508
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,553
what is it?

509
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,992
Get back in the car.

510
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,313
You'll get Diego worried.

511
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,512
Can't I be alone?

512
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,995
All alone, with myself!

513
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,272
what's the matter with you?

514
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,359
what is it?

515
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,953
Get in the car.

516
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,076
we'll wait here.

517
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,748
No, Antonio. lt's oK.

518
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,157
Come back later.

519
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,198
My soul,,,

520
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,556
It hurts so bad

521
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,116
Because I wept and wept

522
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,554
My soul,,,

523
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,798

Too much

527
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,872
His presence is an insult
to my husband's memory!

528
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,435
Murderer! Criminal!

529
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,835
Let go of him!

530
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,437
I want everyone to know
that my husband will be avenged!

531
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:51,716
Go away!

532
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,991
This doesn't concern us!

533
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,919
Let's go, kid.

534
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,198
I come from nowhere

535
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,836
I have no landscapes

536
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:14,199
I have no homeland

537
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,957

541
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,037
I have no place

542
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,631
