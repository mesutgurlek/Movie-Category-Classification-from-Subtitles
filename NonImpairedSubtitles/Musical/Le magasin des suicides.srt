1
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,516
- There's joy
Hello, hello, swallows

2
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,591
There's joy
In the sky

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,394
Over the roofs
There's joy

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,912
And sun in the little streets
There's joy, everywhere there's joy

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,351
All day long my heart beats, 
capsizes and staggers

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,229
It's love
That comes with whatever

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,478
It's love, hello hello 
ladies, there's joy

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,990
Everywhere there is joy

9
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,237
The baker kneads 
the dough with both arms

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,517
He makes good bread
so fine that I am hungry

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,492
We see the mailman flying over there

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,914
Like a blue angel
Bringing his letters to God

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,195
Miracle without a name

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,437
At station Javel

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,314
We see the subway
Coming out of its tunnel

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,518
Drunk with sun, songs,

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,113
And flowers...

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,918
It runs toward the woods
It runs at full steam

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,198
There's joy, the Eiffel tower
goes for a walk

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,433
Like a mad woman she jumps over
the Seine, then she says

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,471
"Too bad for me 
if I get sick"

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,473
I was bored all alone
In my corner"

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,796
There's joy...

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,754
the taxman put on his vest

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,851
Closes shop and says
in a very very kind way

26
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,636
Hello, for today the collect
is over, keep it all gentlemen.

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,555
But suddenly I wake up

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,876
In my bed,
So, I was dreaming

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,435
for sure as the sky is gray

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,313
I must get up,
wash up

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,035
Get dressed
And not sing

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,312
If you have nothing to say
But I still believe

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,752
That this dream is good
As it let me make a song.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,998
Song of Spring
Song of love

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,511
Song for 20 years old
Song for always

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,314
There is joy...

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,520
The Suicide Shop

38
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,510
- What happened to you?

39
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,150
You wanted to commit suicide? Right?
Well yes, of course.

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,958
- Don't you know it's forbidden?

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,675
- What? It's forbidden to commit suicide?

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,395
Yes, on the public roads.
Everybody knows that.

43
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,755
- I did not know. Sorry.

44
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,078
- Luckily the cop didn't see it.
You would have been fined.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,311
And it's not a small fine.
I can tell you.

46
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,116
- What do I care
if I'm dead.

47
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,314
- What are you thinking?
They would have gone after your family.

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,035
- They couldn't.
I have no family left.

49
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,517
And if you miss? 
What do you get?

50
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,713
A fine and a wheelchair.
You get the picture?

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,433
- What do you propose then?

52
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,715
- Shh...

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,193
Follow me.

54
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,015
Stop!

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,313
With the crisis, which bugs you

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,755
- With the crisis which bugs you

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,874
- What is sweeter than
an exquisite death

58
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,798
- An exquisite death

59
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,390
Be lucid and daring

60
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,149
Be lucid and daring

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,999
Let's say it

62
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,510
- Long life to suicide!

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,914
- Enter, enter
Do not be afraid

64
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,748
We are open until 20 pm

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,194
Everything is fast

66
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,668
Nothing is misleading

67
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,673
To help you die is our happiness.

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,593
- Although it costs you
The first step

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,149
Remember that
We are here

70
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,549
- To help you

71
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,114
Without fuss

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,756
To go from life to death

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,877
From life to death

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,879
With the crisis, which bugs you

75
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,879
With the crisis, which bugs you

76
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,869
- What is sweeter than
An exquisite death

77
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,112
An exquisite death
Be lucid

78
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,436
Daring
Be lucid

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,153
and daring

80
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,839
Let's say it

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,476
Long life to suicide!

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,876
- Welcome to paradise

83
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,633
End of worries
As I am saying

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,955
- Everything is allowed

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,435
Nothing forbidden

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,633
- Except that
we don't give credit

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,116
To depart
There's a thousand ways

88
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,914
- A fatal choice
300 poisons

89
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,158
Not to mention the hanging-

90
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,875
It's her passion

91
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,755
- Just to think about it
gives me a thrill

92
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,633
The great thrill

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,752
With the crisis-

94
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,030
which bugs you

95
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,316
With the crisis which bugs you

96
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,796
- What is sweeter
Than an exquisite death

97
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,789
An exquisite death

98
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,152
Be lucid and daring

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,516
Be lucid and daring

100
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,472
Let's say it

101
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,752
Long life to suicide!

102
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,790
We offer quality products.

103
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,070
We guarantee death.

104
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,239
Our motto is to reassure

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,155
Either deceased or reimbursed

106
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,033
- We are useful to the whole city
- They're useful

107
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,190
To the whole city
- Whatever your profile

108
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,635
Our profile

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,673
Forget it all.
Die in peace.

110
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,837
Die in peace.

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,830
Goodbye, life
So be it

112
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,875
Oh, it looks good...

113
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,315
- Hello.

114
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,875
- Enter.
Welcome.

115
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,753
- We will help you.

116
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,189
Right here

117
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,630
In this store you will find 
what you need to kill yourself

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,638
It's for this gentleman.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,116
I know. Mishima!

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,468
- What can I do 
for your pleasure?

121
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,275
- Ben...

122
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,632
- We have the hemp rope.
Squeak, hanging.

123
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,512
Effective.
We can provide the stool.

124
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,676
Otherwise,

125
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,917
We also have it synthetic

126
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,555
The poison, a variety of vials.

127
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,070
Many different speeds.
This one, expensive, but crushes you

128
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,589
in 3 seconds. You are gone!

129
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,915
Gas

130
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,671
granules, 1 bullet revolvers.
The second is useless.

131
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,077
Sleeping pills,
toadstools,

132
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,668
Or razor blades.

133
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,999
Bath, open veins...
Unstoppably photogenic.

134
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,998
My son sharpens them

135
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,032
one by one.

136
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,719
Oh yeah.

137
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,069
- So?

138
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,429
What do you say?

139
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,596
In fact...

140
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,712
As blades we also have low prices

141
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,479
Rusty ones.

142
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,991
If you don't cut deep enough
tetanus is guaranteed

143
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,112
Ah yes, it is tempting.

144
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,557
In fact, I hesitate
between the gas and the poison.

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,750
- Yes...

146
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,429
- I'll take a poison.

147
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,429
Take this. It's on sale.
Lightning quick. Guaranteed result.

148
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,638
It sells really well.
It's trendy.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,956
- I'll take that, then.

150
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,469
- Lucrèce...

151
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,034
Do I gift wrap it?

152
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,150
- No. It's for me.

153
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,033
- It would be more joyful.

154
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,276
That's it.

155
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,631
58 euros.
Ah yes, still...

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,592
You can give death to yourself

157
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,394
but death itself is not free.

158
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,076
Anyway, where you are going
you won't spend a penny.

159
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,515
Cries of pain

160
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,479
Are you expecting
a happy event?

161
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,434
- Happy, not sure.

162
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,028
- It will be soon?
- Imminent.

163
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,992
And you, you have orphans?

164
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,229
Excuse me?
I mean you have children?

165
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,795
- No. Seeing what life has in store for them...

166
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,559
Goodbye, sir.

167
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,273
- Thank you very much Madam.

168
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,436
Well then, good evening.

169
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,597
- Thank you. Sorry.

170
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,154
What's good

171
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,794
Resisting

172
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,038
When life is not rosy

173
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,992
When the mood

174
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,670
Is gloomy

175
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,518
What's the use fighting

176
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,952
Against pessimism

177
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,596
But what is being proposed

178
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,792
- Sadness, horror, etc

179
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,510
Nothing to say
When one sees that

180
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,110
It's not worse

181
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,790
than being rats

182
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,959
- To stop climbing those stairs

183
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,916
To stop seeing this scene

184
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,034
To leave before dawn

185
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,393
Because in a few moments

186
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,751
No regrets

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,509
Or remorse

188
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,792
I will finally be dead.

189
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,510
- This isn't very joyful
Admit it

190
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,916
But it's like that.
Admit it,

191
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,350
It's no use

192
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,918
of crying for him.

193
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,870
No shit-
It isn't worth staying alive.

194
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,110
And yet I believed in it.

195
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,512
I did my best.
Whatever I could.

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,032
But I admit defeat.

197
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,716
He isn't wrong
He is right.

198
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,036
At this stage anyway

199
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,439
Might as well blow his brains out.

200
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,311
Aren't you tired of watching suicides?

201
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,113
- Yes, a little.

202
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,952
It isn't too much fun.

203
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,399
- You are right.
I will talk to mom.

204
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,155
It's OK.

205
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,435
- What's going on?

206
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,950
Phone
ambulance, maternity.

207
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,678
Go on, ma'am.

208
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,393
Push, go!

209
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,352
Yes! Yes! Yes!

210
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,316
Yes! It's a boy!

211
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,675
A very beautiful baby.

212
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,598
Oh, he smiled.

213
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,270
What's that?
My son smiles? No, he isn't.

214
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,750
It must be a fold of mouth.
Why would he smile?

215
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,838
- It looks like a smile.

216
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,996
That would be amazing.
Nobody ever smiled

217
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,236
in our family.

218
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,594
Mishima, come here.

219
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,395
Why?

220
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,879
The client says Alan smiled.
What's that story?

221
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,038
He must have a diarrhea.
It may be confused with a smile,

222
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,430
But it's not. It's just a grin.

223
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,669
Look.

224
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,749
If you push down the corners of the mouth
he's sulking

225
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,189
Like his brother and sister

226
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,595
Since they were born.

227
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,190
Let go, to see.

228
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,234
Tickle tickle...

229
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,555
You see, he's smiling.

230
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,553
Alright! What did you want?
A rope.

231
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,388
To hang myself.
- Good. Follow me.

232
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,835
Your ceiling is high?

233
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,350
- Uh... like that.

234
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,278
- You do not know?

235
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,517
6 feet should suffice.

236
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,438
The noose is all ready.

237
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,075
Just put your head through it.
Here, it's a gift. My pleasure.

238
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,397
How can that be? He smiles?
- It was a pleasure to see

239
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,159
a baby smile.

240
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,999
Yes, yes, it is.

241
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,510
Come on, go home.
You've better things to do there.

242
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,233
- Goodbye, sir.

243
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,914
- That's not true.

244
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,595
- Shit!

245
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,028
Oh, shit!

246
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,475
Good morning.

247
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,317
I keep telling you, not "good morning."
You must say "bad morning"

248
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,672
and "goodbye" rather than "see you"
since they will never come back.

249
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,671
When will you understand that?

250
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,035
What can I do for you?

251
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,355
As a matter of fact,

252
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,596
We are hesitating.

253
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,077
- It would be for Mister,
or Madam?

254
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,954
We would like to go together.

255
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,515
- Good. It is more advantageous.

256
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,230
For Valentine's Day
we have a deal for couples.

257
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,158
- What are you hiding behind your back?

258
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,430
What will we do with you?

259
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,078
You drew your sister busy and pretty.
Don't you see she's useless and ugly?

260
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,550
I think Marilyn is pretty.

261
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,312
Ugly, I'm ugly.

262
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,477
I'm really ugly.

263
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,718
And there he's,
making his sister cry.

264
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,879
Oh, it's snowing...

265
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,512
- Hum... Well, to us.

266
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,673
- What do you say?

267
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,235
- It's sad.

268
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,830
Exactly, that's sad.
And that's why it's pretty.

269
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,388
- That's it.
You will be happy.

270
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,236
- Alan, what do they say?

271
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,391
- See you, good night...

272
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,955
Pardon me.

273
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,470
My mistake.
Goodbye.

274
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,751
Damn. Too late.

275
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,477
- How are the news?
- Alarming.

276
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,711
- Good. It is good for us.

277
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,998
Emergency. I am going.

278
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,719
There, there I am coming...

279
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,234
- Please.

280
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,354
- What is it?
It's urgent. I can't stand it.

281
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,638
14?
I will see if I have it.

282
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,071
14, 

283
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,556
14... Ah!

284
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,796
Where is it?

285
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,635
Where did it go?

286
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,913
What are you doing here?
- I could not sleep.

287
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,595
- 35 Euros.

288
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,792
For 1 bullet only?
One maybe, but the right one.

289
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,030
But in the showcase it's 22 euros.

290
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,310
Night rate.

291
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,033
- Okay, I take it then.

292
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,231
You can come back tomorrow,
if you prefer.

293
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,272
- Absolutely not!
I couldn't wait.

294
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,998
- Who was that?
- A desperate man with an empty gun.

295
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,110
What are you reading?

296
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,072
- Statistics for this year.

297
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,278
One suicide attempt
every 40 min,

298
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,715
but only 20% success.

299
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,435
It's awful 
all those people who miss.

300
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,229
Fortunately we're here.
We are not about to close shop.

301
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,313
- Still, it's not fun.

302
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,630
Good night, darling.

303
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,399
Sweet dreams mom
sweet dreams dad.


304
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,159
Will he be quiet!

305
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,810
I told him, not on the public road!
We could lose our license.

306
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,075
- Alan

307
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,476
hurry up a bit!

308
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,116
Why can't we kill ourselves, mom?

309
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,950
I've told you 100 times, Marilyn.
It is impossible.

310
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,191
- Think, poor nitwit,

311
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,471
Who would keep the store?

312
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,551
Vincent is right. 
This is a family business

313
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,990
started by your great-grandfather,

314
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,475
Célestin Tuvache.

315
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,676
Later, when we are too old,

316
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,270
you will take over the shop.

317
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,710
- For the boys yes. 
But why can't I cut my veins.

318
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,915
Because it hurts.

319
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,111
And life is beautiful.
- No, Alan.

320
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,311
Life is appalling.

321
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,318
But we must fight.

322
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,635
- So, you wanted something...

323
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,639
- Hello, it's me again.
- Yes, hi there.

324
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,230
...something original,
manly...

325
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,110
And voila.

326
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,751
The seppuku, more commonly
known as hara-kiri.

327
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,314
Not for everybody.

328
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,790
For athletes only.

329
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,315
But strong
as you are...

330
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,638
What is...
was your job?

331
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,194
-Gym teacher

332
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,232
Oh, then it's for you.

333
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,750
I thought of gas or napalm...

334
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,556
A fine-immolation
in a  high school courtyard

335
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,518
it would be striking.

336
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,957
But honestly, seppuku
is more classy.

337
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,514
I sharpen them myself.

338
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,352
Touch the edge of this blade.

339
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,908
It enters in you like in butter.

340
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,272
Come on, children,
let's hurry...

341
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,198
- Bye, mom.
Vincent!

342
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,356
What?

343
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,995
- Here is a demonstration.

344
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,096
Bye dad.
Have a nice day.

345
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,677
- Come on.
You'll be late.

346
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,679
I am not sure I can do it.
You do home service?

347
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,435
And what else?
We are not murderers after all.

348
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,518
We provide.
People manage.

349
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,279
And... it is expensive?

350
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,792
Certainly, but the samuraï kimono
is provided: 800 Euros.

351
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,275
Ho, it's quite a sum!

352
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,479
- A shroud has no pockets.
Neither does a kimono ...

353
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,672
Excuse me. Then?

354
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,190
- Well, I'll take it.

355
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,074
- You will not regret it.

356
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,829
Our suicides are guaranteed.
Our motto: "Dead or reimbursed"

357
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,590
You only die once.
Might as well make it a unique...

358
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,030
...unforgettable moment.

359
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,758
- It can't go on
This carnage

360
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,715
It's too horrible
All those people who

361
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,511
All these people who think
Only of the grave

362
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,755
What's the point
In brief

363
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,272
To be on earth
If we think only

364
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,638
If we think only
of comitting suicide.

365
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,356
A peaceful life
Without despair

366
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,798
Quiet life
And then stop

367
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,913
Yes stop moping

368
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,556
Death to Death
Let's be smart

369
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,351
Or else
We're all end up

370
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,280
We will all end up orphans

371
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,355
It's true
It's not funny

372
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,473
But we can't do anything

373
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,233
You shouldn't start as losers

374
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,636
The world belongs to us

375
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,956
We are only children

376
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,198
Just good-for-nothing

377
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,556
- I think we can succeed

378
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,315
Put an end to suicides

379
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,033
Let me think

380
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,516
I may have an idea

381
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,032
- Let him think

382
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,391
- He may have an idea

383
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,995
- It is not easy.
I hesitate.

384
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,751
- Lucrèce,
can you come?

385
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,670
Madame would like
something feminin.

386
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,189
* Feminin-?

387
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,628
What's most feminin is poison.

388
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,831
It's a bit like a perfume.

389
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,355
I was just preparing some in the lab.

390
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,829
Yes, a poison!
Why not?

391
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,270
Here, our entire range

392
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,557
declined poison water
or concentrated.

393
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,673
More expensive naturally
but so much more effective.

394
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,873
You prefer a contact poison or...

395
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,350
to inhale or to ingest?

396
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,119
- What is the best?

397
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,471
It depends on the desired effect.

398
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,912
I especially research
the effect of death.

399
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,235
- Darling,

400
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,717
I'm going.
Mr. Calmel's delivery.

401
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,275
All this is very tempting.

402
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,516
It is.

403
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,110
All our products are good.

404
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,075
Take your time.
I'll let you think.

405
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,678
- Can I help you?

406
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,793
- This is what?

407
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,799
Freeze-dried amanita phalloides.

408
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,077
It smells nothing
and you feel nothing.

409
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,595
Our customers are happy.

410
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,949
- How do you know?

411
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,959
- None ever came back.

412
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,439
- Dying my natural death
I have no patience

413
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,231
- There's everything you need here
We can trust them

414
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,269
We don't know what to take.
That's why we hesitate.

415
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,869
- A rope to hang

416
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,152
- Or poison "sudden death"

417
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,398
- I thought I'd slash my wrists

418
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,154
Is it a good idea

419
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,516
That's what my brother in law did,

420
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,555
Now deceased.

421
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,030
Wait, wait, think

422
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,880
- Dying without blisters
Or nausea or burns

423
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,277
Guaranteed pure product

424
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,394
Cyanide pellets

425
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,595
This is not good

426
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,915
The poison

427
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,628
In contrast,
The gun shot

428
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,758
Frankly I do not recommend

429
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,239
It's noisy
It's dirty

430
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,234
It is not a wonder

431
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:17,931
You failed in your life?

432
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:20,810
Succeed in your death!

433
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,398
- What is it?

434
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,394
- This is Mr. Tuvache.
I bring you your order.

435
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,200
Come in, it's open.

436
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,199
Take the pads.

437
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,029
Enter, Tuvache.

438
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,391
Come in.

439
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,237
- I do not know what to choose.

440
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,160
Sorry to bother you all this time.

441
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,909
Not at all.
Take your time.

442
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,272
- It is not
an easy decision.

443
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,475
Of course.

444
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,110
- Everything is there, Mr. Calmel.

445
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,149
Mr. Calmel?
Ah!

446
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,996
Finally. If you knew how
I've had enough of this shit.

447
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,839
- What shit?

448
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,315
- Life.

449
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,238
Ah yes, life...

450
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,636
Believe me, Tuvache

451
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,077
Go on to the other side,
it's the only solution,

452
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,318
The end of worries,
the big sleep,

453
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,471
The extasy...

454
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,675
- Still,

455
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,359
it isn't very joyful.

456
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,351
- It is those who remain
who are sad.

457
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,559
When you're dead, you won't
be there to miss yourself.

458
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,518
Think about it, man.

459
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,991
Yes, of course.
I put it where?

460
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,509
Give me that!

461
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,350
Finish...

462
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,114
For the little bill...

463
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,118
- There, under the bed.

464
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,595
Finish...

465
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,557
- What would you take?

466
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,831
- I do not know.

467
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,793
To die? Unfortunately 
I can't allow myself.

468
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,435
Must say what is

469
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,519
I have regrets

470
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,074
And remorse

471
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,393
Going on selling death

472
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,108
When I see it all

473
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,194
All that is wrong
All that's not going well

474
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,111
I'd like to jump off a bridge

475
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,154
- I am not in good spirits.
This may be normal

476
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,273
With what happens

477
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,714
All these people

478
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,996
Who leave and pass away

479
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,875
- It would be tempting

480
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,759
A bloodbath

481
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,230
To finish

482
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,037
Once and for all
With the future

483
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,555
- It's not fun

484
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,439
Killing people

485
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,954
And to not be able

486
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,475
Feel more than that about it.

487
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,110
To kill oneself,
To behead oneself

488
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,872
Or be bloodless
Suffocated by your own tongue

489
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,360
- It makes me feel like
ending my life

490
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,717
Sometimes I wonder

491
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,349
As I really got the blues

492
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,914
But we cannot
Neither you nor me

493
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,515
Because we would

494
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,958
have to close shop for good.

495
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:54,760
Whatever happens
We must remain alive

496
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,719
To insure

497
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,875
Happiness to our suicides

498
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,556
- Well, I'll take that.

499
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,110
You won't regret it.
Silly me, I meant

500
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,949
Let me know how that went.
Hahaha, what a dummy I am!

501
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,514
- It's not too noisy,
at least?

502
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,796
- Are you sure this will work?

503
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:25,897
Sure.

504
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,593
- Still, it's risky.

505
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,590
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
It's time to move faster.

506
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,478
Otherwise, we will all end up orphans.

507
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,079
We will meet here.

508
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,839
Your father will kill you.

509
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,192
- Do not worry.
- In any case, it will be great.

510
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,310
- Attention...

511
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,959
- What are you doing?

512
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,309
Playing marbles Dad.

513
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,318
And that makes you laugh?

514
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,194
- Well yes,
it's funny.

515
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,118
I don't see what's funny.
- Go home.

516
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,799
Yes, Dad.

517
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,718
Bye Alan...

518
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,115
He laughed.

519
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,397
- You didn't forget Marilyn's birthday?

520
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,671
- I even bought gifts.

521
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,554
- Stop laughing all the time, 
you are irritating me.

522
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,909
- Okay.

523
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,429
- You look stupid.

524
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,472
Yes, Dad.

525
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,877
- You want a cigarette?

526
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,275
- A what?

527
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,868
A cigarette.

528
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,391
- Really?
Can I smoke? At my age?

529
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,796
Of course.
Why not?

530
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,554
You'll see.
This is good for health.

531
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,710
Must inhale, keep it
inside as long as possible.

532
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,109
You like it?

533
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,588
Yes, it's not bad.
Thank you, Dad.

534
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,599
- You see, why not?

535
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,118
- I want to kill myself

536
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,519
but I don't know
if I can afford it.

537
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,995
Wait, the cheapest?

538
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,873
I have what you need.

539
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,791
A bag of our store. Very strong.
Ideal for choking.

540
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,473
And then here, to close it
tight around your throat.

541
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,593
Thank you.
- How much?

542
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,434
- Nothing.
When we can help...

543
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,470
- lf I had met more people
disinterested as you

544
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,119
I would not be here.

545
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,040
- That's it, that's it
Sorry, we are closing.

546
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,352
- You want another cigarette?
Yes, I do.

547
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,757
- Here, keep the pack.
If you want, I will give you

548
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,236
a cartridge.
Thanks, Dad.

549
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,320
Stay here.
Finish your cigarette quietly.

550
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,551
Light up another if you wish.

551
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,997
And do not forget,
inhale all the smoke.

552
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,191
Yes, Dad.

553
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,198
Good evening, my dear.

554
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,994
Good evening my love.
Alan is not with you?

555
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,794
Yes, yes. He is there.

556
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,839
- But he smokes!

557
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,555
What...
- I'll explain.

558
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,798
- Mom, Alan is smoking...

559
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,878
- We will explain.

560
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,918
- Are you okay Alan?
- Good day?

561
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,115
And school?

562
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,517
Yes, yes. All is well.

563
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,912
There is joy...
Hello, hello...

564
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,755
And there it is...

565
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,350
Oh, it's me.
Mom, it's so beautiful.

566
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,477
Vincent drew it.

567
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,273
Yes, it's me.

568
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,392
- I wish I could die.

569
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,752
- Tell yourself that you have 1 year
less to live.

570
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,512
And now,
the gifts...

571
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,799
This is too cute.

572
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,919
Thank you.
And this is so cute.

573
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,271
- You Alan, what's your gift?

574
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,589
- A scarf
to strangle me...

575
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,034
- But no.

576
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,960
It is worn loose,
vaporous.

577
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,714
Like a caress around your neck.

578
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,474
And that?

579
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,230
- This is to dance with it.
I'll show you.

580
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,709
- Where did you get this?

581
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,878
- I bought it with my pocket money.

582
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,509
- But you're crazy.
You shouldn't have.

583
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,677
Yes, for you, nothing is too beautiful.

584
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,353
Therrre iiiis joyyyy...

585
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,029
- How is it going?
- Hi. You have the music?

586
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,711
- OK. That is good.
Your uncle?

587
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,638
- I am sure he will agree.
- Perfect.

588
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,918
And our reward?

589
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,228
- Patience.

590
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,952
- You want some?
- NO...

591
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,959
- You should. It is good for health.

592
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,850
- Who's is the idiot who told you that?
- My father.

593
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,239
What's wrong with him? Tobacco gives
cancer. You want to die young?

594
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,399
- Well... No.

595
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,275
Then throw it away. It's shit.

596
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,188
Don't move. It will start.

597
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,914
- Come on.

598
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,915
- She is beautiful, eh,
my sister?

599
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,669
- But... But...

600
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,835
But...

601
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,628
Mishima?
What are you doing?

602
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,558
What's going on?

603
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,752
- There is that...

604
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,869
- But... Oh...

605
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,592
There... I am here..
 All is well.

606
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,434
- Hello Sir.  
- Hello children. What brings you here?

607
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,951
- Uncle Dom, we need a favor from you.

608
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,072
- If I can. What kind of favor?

609
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,757
- Well, a big one.
- Very big.

610
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,194
- I am listening to you.

611
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,475
Oh, doctor,

612
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,195
Life is too sad.

613
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,073
Store... with...

614
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,477
We need to kill people...

615
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,190
Suicide rope hara-kiri

616
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,357
and tutti quanti.

617
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,879
- If you only knew
I've had enough of this shit.

618
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,599
- What shit?

619
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,193
The life.

620
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,398
Seppuku-bottle gas

621
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,790
pellets, poison pills.

622
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,990
Good morning, sir, ma'am...

623
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,079
- Stop laughing, you irritate me.

624
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,275
- That's it.

625
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,473
Ah, I understand your confusion,

626
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,996
but if life was funny
We would know it.

627
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,151
Eins, zwei,
three, four...

628
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,308
If life was funny

629
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,796
Well it would be known.

630
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,277
It's like a slice of shit

631
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,711
Buttered on both sides

632
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,393
Overwork
Breaking down

633
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,070
Swamp
I relieve the ravages

634
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,195
Sinking

635
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,552
Overwork
Slavery

636
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,708
I relieve the sinking

637
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,870
You frequent suicide

638
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,711
Therein lies the problem

639
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,590
Helping people

640
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,791
To end their lives

641
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,276
Gets on your nerves.

642
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,154
These short-time customers

643
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,990
Make your life bitter

644
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,157
And you are harassed

645
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,318
Overwork, break up,
swamp

646
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,878
I relieve the ravages
Sinking

647
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,470
Your husband is overworked

648
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,273
He is schizophrenic

649
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,031
He should be bedridden
For at least two weeks

650
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,870
- Two weeks in bed?
What do we do with the store?

651
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,233
- This I do not know,
dear ma'am. It's 250 euros.

652
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,398
- This is a cement cinderblock
provided with a chain

653
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,751
which gets locked
to your ankle.

654
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,715
Go to the edge of a river,
throw it in front of you

655
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,191
You are pulled to the bottom.
And hop! No more worries.

656
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,672
- It doesn't seem bad..

657
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,519
- My husband makes them himself.

658
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,391
well, he made them, poor man.

659
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,352
The name of the shop
is embossed on one side.

660
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,235
- Put your hand.
Yes, I feel it well.

661
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,359
Alright, I'll take that.

662
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,188
- Are you going far?
- Yes... No...

663
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,549
- My son will help you.

664
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,518
Alan? The hand truck.

665
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,950
- You really think...

666
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,753
Ta, ta, ta.

667
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,873
It's the least we can do.
It's as heavy as a dead donkey

668
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,593
that thing.

669
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,270
But... Oh!

670
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,559
My God...

671
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,629
But...

672
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,395
- Well...

673
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,156
- It's high, huh?

674
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,152
Good day, sir.

675
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,198
It is today,
As I tell you,

676
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,152
We win or lose.

677
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,270
It's super!

678
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,517
This afternoon, nothing forbidden.

679
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,952
They will be on their ass.
- Like hell!

680
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,595
- We're going to cut the sausage

681
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,235
We are going to spin the banana

682
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,117
We garden gnomes

683
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,869
We have ideas in the skull

684
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,873
All with me
The big day has come

685
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,355
They will fall

686
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,869
on their ass

687
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,796
Today

688
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,513
I tell you

689
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,394
We win or lose.
This is super!

690
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,636
This afternoon

691
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,797
nothing is forbidden.
They will be

692
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,956
On the ass.
Like hell!

693
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,470
No lack of enthusiasm.

694
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,832
People are dummies.
We condemn them.

695
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,829
Bump off the humdrum.
We are the smartest.

696
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,553
We are Supermen.

697
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,150
All with me
The day has come

698
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,988
Listen to this.
They will be on their ass.

699
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,190
It's too tempting.

700
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,074
Nothing to lose.

701
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,034
It's fun to make a mess.

702
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,276
It's tempting.

703
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,233
It's fun to make a mess.

704
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,749
Too bad,

705
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,714
If it will cost you. The good mood

706
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,116
is on its way.

707
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,755
- Hey...

708
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,235
- So?

709
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,354
- It's up to you.

710
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,030
- Wow...
- So you like it?

711
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,635
- Marilyn, tell me...

712
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,790
where did you get these bubbles?
- Alan gave them to me.

713
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,678
Oh, but...

714
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,595
Shit...

715
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,635
- But what is it?

716
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,154
- Uh, nothing.

717
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,192
- I felt like a slap.

718
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,829
You were dreaming.
Go back to sleep.

719
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,276
- This thing is heavy.

720
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,594
- Come on...
But shut up.

721
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,315
Hide yourself.

722
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,235
- What's this racket?

723
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,314
But what...

724
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,428
- But what's

725
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,836
this thing?
Mom!

726
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,599
What's going on?

727
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,714
- It is Alan.

728
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,713
Vincent, help me!

729
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,355
- In here...

730
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,270
- Attention, behind you...

731
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,834
Attention, Alan!

732
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,313
Give me that!

733
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,149
- Come on guys!

734
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,635
- I got it.

735
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,354
Oh no...

736
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,238
- Come here, you!

737
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,392
Oh no!

738
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:24,120
Go back home ladies and gentlemen,
We have nothing left to sell.

739
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,595
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Goodbye.

740
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,799
- It's okay Ms. Tuvache, 
we will suicide another time.

741
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,550
- By the way, what do you need?

742
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,997
- Nothing, miss.
Not anymore.

743
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,036
Madam, I ask you
the hand of your daughter.

744
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,152
I don't know her name...

745
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,879
- Marilyn.
- Marilyn.

746
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,714
And with whom I just fell in love,

747
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,315
and who restored my appetite for life.

748
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,515
- Yeah...

749
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,917
- Mom, please,
say yes...

750
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,191
- Well... yes...
But on one condition.

751
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,278
- Anything you want.

752
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,235
That you help us to clean up
all this mess.

753
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,396
- Mom,

754
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,718
I love you.
Me too, I love you.

755
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,589
- I intended to leave this earth

756
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,991
Horrible and evil

757
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,273
To fall asleep with ether

758
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,428
But against all odds

759
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,475
It fell on me

760
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,275
Of course without warning

761
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,029
I never received

762
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,836
Such a look from a girl

763
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,758
- The charms of destiny

764
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,719
have unpredictable twists and turns.

765
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,878
- I saw everything in black

766
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,510
It's nothing to say it.

767
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,510
I was in despair

768
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,634
And who would have predicted

769
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,920
That love would come

770
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,318
In this obscure shop

771
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,070
A cheerful young man

772
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,917
Wearing pretty face

773
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,309
- The charms of destiny

774
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,399
have unpredictable twists and turns.

775
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,230
- No more wasted nights

776
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,237
No more days of suffering

777
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,874
Let's live in the wonder

778
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,794
of a common attraction

779
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,396
All is allowed so long

780
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,594
As love blooms.

781
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,838
Dawn after dawn

782
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:38,590
Life will follow its course.

783
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,757
The charms of destiny

784
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,437
will perfume our days.

785
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,991
But how did you?

786
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,078
It is so clean

787
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,319
we could eat on the floor
- I was going to propose it.

788
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,478
I am Breton and
I make perfect crêpes.

789
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,355
How about a crêpe picnic
here, right now?

790
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,551
Oh yes, why not?

791
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,272
It's delicious.

792
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,392
- It's true, crêpes are good.

793
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,594
- You are a real gem.
- You embarrass me.

794
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,791
- He is the perfect man.

795
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,871
What about changing the suicide shop
to a shop for something else?

796
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,231
- A shop for what?

797
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,909
- I don't know
we can try.

798
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,633
Anyway the stock is ruined.

799
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,989
We could open a crêperie.

800
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,430
- This is an idea.

801
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,071
Crêpe evoke mourning.
The clients will not be disoriented.

802
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,037
- What is this shit?

803
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,719
- I forgot about him!

804
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,832
-Someone can explain?

805
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,957
- It's me Dad.
Everything is my fault.

806
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,918
Attention, move over!

807
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,195
Pardon me, madam.

808
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,874
Mishima, stop it now!

809
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,272
- Calm down, Dad.

810
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,234
- I'll explain.
- You will explain nothing!

811
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,797
Come here, bastard!

812
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,548
Mishima, if you kill this child,

813
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,114
I kill myself!

814
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,913
Please Mishima...

815
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,592
- Okay, I made a very
big mistake, I'm sorry...

816
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,030
I beg your pardon.

817
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,749
I propose a deal.
An honest deal.

818
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,676
You're a great dad,
the best dad.

819
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,835
But you're a serious dad,
too serious. Everybody is.

820
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,752
You never laugh, not even smile.

821
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,273
So if right here, right now
I can make you laugh,

822
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,868
you forgive me?

823
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,716
- Bastard, Mishima! You have the death
of this child on your conscience.

824
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,478
Oh no...

825
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,478
- Assassin!

826
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,478
- But I... I...

827
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,194
What...

828
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,355
- He's alive.

829
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,555
Mom...

830
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,629
- He's flying.

831
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,435
Ball.

832
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,909
You would like?

833
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,879
One skull-outbreak,
one!

834
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,033
The "Red Beard" crêpe is for?

835
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,276
- For me!

836
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,358
- Thank you.

837
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,432
- Hello, it's me again.

838
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,069
- What a good surprise.
What brings you?

839
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,908
- You would have a...?
- Pardon?

840
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,589
A cyanide crêpe?

841
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,513
- Do not move.

842
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,155
Hold.

843
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,715
Keep it closed, you fool. If my wife
learnt I still sell those,

844
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,354
She would kill me.

845
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,517
- How much?
Nothing.

846
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,710
- There is no reason

847
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:53,200
- It is in memory of the bad
old times. Good day.

848
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,834
- Thank you.

849
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,275
- Goodbye madam.

850
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,479
- Lucrèce, I thought about something.
Yes, what?

851
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,551
- A loyalty card.

852
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,031
because now happy
customers come back.

853
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,999
What do you say?
- Very good idea.

854
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,278
- Arghh...

855
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:44,068
We were stupid.
Today everything is clear.

856
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:48,199
Down with morbidity
Since life is splendid.

857
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:54,149
Living on homicides
Made us livid

858
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,279
Let's be lucid
and death to sucide.

859
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,194
- My face of Lent
I'm tired of it.

860
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,752
- There is no problem
He's less white

861
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,429
I love life and even

862
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,439
- Vincent, we love you

863
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:19,196
- I will write poems

864
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,429
We repainted the world
In a few seconds

865
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,153
To no longer see

866
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,432
All these filthy colors

867
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:35,155
You are right Alan, 
We must keep the banana.

868
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,359
Death we are condemning.
You see we are gliding.

869
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,518
- It's crazy when you think about it.

870
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,035
A matter of common sense.

871
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,789
Goodbye violence.

872
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,957
Deliverance at last.

873
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:55,235
And therefore
no more suffering

874
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:59,996
The beautiful life starts

875
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,914
- For us it's over.

876
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:10,717
We lost it all.
But we get used to it.

877
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,032
If we had known

878
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,278
We would have lived

879
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,359
As it's evident

880
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:25,475
Do not pity us.
You don't know your happiness.

881
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,990
Being passed away

882
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,511
Isn't a happy affair.

883
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,796
An abundance of laughs,
like a perfume

884
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,628
Which surrounds us.

885
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,555
The dead season
Isn't our kingdom anymore.

886
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:46,392
So we must listen
to all these ghosts.

887
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:51,470
All together now
Gloom, go home!

888
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:56,436
We listen to you, Miss
We trust you.

889
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,360
Be natural,

890
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,591
and without shades.

891
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,750
- Love spellbinds me,
Sweet romance.

892
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,715
- It's the universal

893
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,709
attraction!

894
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,150
- No dream

895
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,272
is impossible.

896
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,471
So long as you believe

897
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,434
in it strongly.

898
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,316
And if it's sometimes painful,

899
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,558
Life is always better
than death.

900
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,237
- It's all black,
I'm scared. A match?

901
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,598
- No, don't do that...

902
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
