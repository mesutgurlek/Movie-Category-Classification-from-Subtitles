15
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,080
(Murmuring)

16
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:01,641
She cannot be sacrificed
without the ring.

17
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:05,442
Where is the ring?
What has she done with the ring?

18
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,444
(All) The ring! The ring!

And now my life has changed

32
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:07,766
My independence seems to vanish
in the haze

33
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:13,755

Ooh

49
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,806
- Oh, shocking.
- Monstrous.

50
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:30,955
- Ahme.
- The necessary preparations...

51
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,363
- The preparations for my departure...
- Are made.

52
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,081
- At once, without delay.
- The ring.

53
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:40,677
Over the water we must go.

54
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,763
- Bhuta.
- You ask of me, Master?

55
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:45,959
- Obedience and Love.
- This is so.

56
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:47,725
- Ahme.
- This is so.

57
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:50,407
- The ring.
- Has nobody looked on the washbasin?

58
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:53,678
l am making the immediate
arrangements for my necessary...

59
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:55,445
- Are made.
- At once.

60
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,558
- ...visit to England.
- ln hand.

61
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,166
Something must be done.

62
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:01,755
Without the ring,
there will be no sacrifice,

63
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,117
without the sacrifice,
no congregation.

64
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,238
Without a congregation...

65
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,647
...no more me.

66
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,405
This is so.

67
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:25,882
- Wave.
- l don't like to.

68
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,362
- Go on, wave.
- Shall l?

69
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,717
They expect it, don't they.

70
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,805
Lovely lads and so natural.

71
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:36,236
Adoration hasn't gone to their heads.

72
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,517
You know what l mean, success.

73
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:42,526
So natural and still the same
as they was before they was.

74
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,158
(Rattling)

75
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,165
(Organ music plays)

76
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:37,038
- Someone's got hold of my finger.
- You trying to attract attention again?

77
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,601
She's pulling at it.

78
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,399
(Yells) Oh!

79
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,961
Ow!

80
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:52,325
She had my finger, you know...

81
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:55,564
Stop trying to drag things down
to your own level.

82
00:05:55,687 --> 00:06:00,363
l thought she was a sandwich
until she went spare on my hand.

83
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,202
lt's cold. lt's a cold place.

84
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:10,839
- So, the ring?
- No. l could not get it off, Swami.

85
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:13,325
Oh dear!

86
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,878
(Engine revs)

87
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:27,678

(Thuds)

89
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:55,957
Hey! Have you been messing with me
in my kip?

90
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,237
l mean, with a fishing rod.

91
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:02,155
l wouldn't touch you with a plastic one.
What are you doing on the floor?

92
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,118
l'm tired.

93
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:39,325
(Phones ring)

94
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,039
- Hello?
- Hello?

95
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,478
(Alarm clock rings)

96
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:05,156
Hey, Bea-atle!

97
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:08,120
How about this, <i>Shufti?</i>

98
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,482
Gold! All of it, pure gold.

99
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:14,758
ln easy to handle
denominational nuggets. Unmarked.

100
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,481
- Not a mark on them.
- No, l hate them.

101
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:21,998
- No.
- lt makes your fingers go green.

102
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:26,677
lt's not the Beatle with the ring.

103
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:30,923
- Aren't l?
- No, unfortunately.

104
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,560
(Giggles)

105
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,520
Ah!

106
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:43,877
Hey, Bea-atle.
You shall have fun, eh?

107
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,567
No thanks, l'm rhythm guitar
and mouth organ.

108
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,003
l didn't encourage that wink.

109
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,960
- lt is not the one.
- My gosh.

110
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:58,159
They all look the same in their similitude
and language.

111
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:01,279
Swami, it's raining on your...

112
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,284
After them.

113

114
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,839

116
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:17,996

117
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:19,958

Oh... After them.

120
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:50,884
- What first attracted you to me?
- Well, you're very polite.

121
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,356
(Electronic hum)

122
00:10:57,487 --> 00:10:59,239
(Laughs)

123
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,198
Ha, ha!

124

Ow!

127
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,763
- What are you doing?
- Posting a letter.

128
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:22,479
Ow!

129
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,559

135
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:41,766
Hey! My skin's soaked right through
to the skin.

136
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,117
There's more here than meets the eye.

137
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:46,203

''You're going to lose that girl''.

143

And l will take her out tonight

161
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:09,117
The way you treat her,
what else can l do?

162
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,276
You're going to lose that girl

163
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,282
You're going to lose that girl

164
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:26,002
You're going to lose that girl,
yes yes, you're going to lose that girl

165
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:29,597
You're going to lose that girl,
yes yes, you're going to lose that girl

166
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:34,164
You're going to lose,
yes yes, you're going to lose that girl

167
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:38,041
l'll make a point of taking her away
from you

168
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,317
Watch what you do,
yeah

169
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:47,041
The way you treat her,
what else can l do?

170
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:50,000
lf you don't take her out tonight

171
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:54,518
She's going to change her mind,
she's going to change her mind

172
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:57,445
And l will take her out tonight

173
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:01,162
And l will treat her kind,
l'm going to treat her kind

174
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:04,723
You're going to lose that girl,
yes yes, you're going to lose that girl

175
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:08,556
You're going to lose that girl,
yes yes, you're going to lose that girl

176
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:14,319
You're going to lose, yes yes,
you're going to lose that girl

177
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,676
(lndistinct chatter)

178
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:22,004
- Boys, are you buzzing?
- No thanks, l've got the car.

179
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:25,756
No, listen...
You'll have to do it again.

180
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:30,119
(Over speaker) ' l'll make a point
of taking her away from you

181
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,681
' Watch what you do,
yeah

182
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:37,925
' The way you treat her,
what else can l do...  '

183
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:41,039
(Whirring)

184
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,325
- ls that you?
- No.

185
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:46,483
- (Whirring stops)
- Don't look at me.

186
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:50,159
(Crash)

187
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,279
lt was you buzzing.
You naughty boy.

188
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,043
(Electric saw whirrs)

189
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,998
(Whispers) Now for the ring!

190
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,796
(Muffled cries)

191
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:07,400
Ow!

192
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:10,837
Oh! Oh, that stings.

193
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:13,322
(Yells) Kaili!

194
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:14,926
Kaili!

195
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:16,560
(Ahme ) Flee!

196
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:20,362
Will you explain everything
when the opportunity presents itself?

197
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:21,966
- Flee!
- OK.

198
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:38,685
(Gunshot)

199
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:54,120
Oh, goodness me!
Sex is creeping in.

200
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:58,559
Young people see it in the bazaars,
market places, temple...

201
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:02,726
No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...

202
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:08,365
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.

203
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:12,526
and will understand the deep
significance of blood well shed.

204
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:17,084
Of course l don't expect you to see
eye to eye with me...

205
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:22,605
What? Who? Where?

206
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:26,083
Now... lf you'll pardon me.

207
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,800
lt's played out, any road?
You know, rings...

208
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:54,565
- Very nice.
- lt's yours.

209
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,999
Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious, that is!

210
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:02,164
- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.

211
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:07,195
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?

212
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:11,036
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.

213
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:16,366
l tell a lie. We have got one in there
from the mystic east... Or we did have.

214
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,443
(Hollers) Hey, Abdul!

215
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:21,035
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?

216
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,079
That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?

217
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:26,596
Very nice he was, too.

218
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:30,515
l think he's still down there,
in the coal hole.

219
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,562
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?

220
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:45,406
Doesn't the eastern flavour
come expensive?

221
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:47,757
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?

222
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,843
ls this ring nasty, sir?

223
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:54,006
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, l must lie down.

224
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:57,803
Oh! That's better.

225
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,159
Excuse me...
This menu...

226
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:04,925
(Thump)

227
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,883
l've just seen the most amazing thing...

228
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,998
(Gasps) Oh...

229
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,439
Hey, did you...

230
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:45,085
There's a man down there on his head.

231
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,280
Arthur?

232
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,880
(Whooshes)

233
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,235
Could you pick this up for me, please?

234
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,680
(Sitar music plays)

235
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:04,480
(Music stops)

236
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:08,477
Are you eating, too, Paul?

237
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:15,279
Your friend is in mortal danger.
l can say no more.

238
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,398
(Gasping)

239
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,165
(Music resumes)

240
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,923
lt's rather a jolly place.

241
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:28,317
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.

242
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:29,960
He has three hours to live.

243
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:31,759
- Say no more.
- l can say no more.

244
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,158
l ordered soup too.

245
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:38,881
- Soup!
- Soup.

246
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:53,796
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.

247
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:56,077
- Unless l'm mistaken.
- ls it?

248
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:59,517
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.

249
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,399
- Say no more.
- l can say no more.

250
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,917
Excuse me. lf he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,

251
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,719
why is he not painted red?

252
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:12,479
l've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend l will.

253
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:18,037
- What's this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.

254
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:22,001
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.

255
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,958
All are happy to go.

256
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:27,363
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring

257
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,955
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.

258
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:33,762
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.

259
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:38,563
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so l'm told, with that ring.

260
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:40,086
Three hours to live.

261
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:43,756
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.

262
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,879
You are lucky to be chosen!

263
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:50,556
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.

264
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,957
- What's this?
- A season ticket.

265
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:58,159
l like a lot of seasoning in my soup.

266
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,843
There's somebody been in this soup.

267
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:06,721
l got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.

268
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,998
l get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.

269
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:13,843
No? Come off!

270
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:17,960
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,

271
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,157
who will then go happy to Kaili.

272
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:22,084
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.

273
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:24,723
There's a footprint in here.

274
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,963
Here, you have a go.

275
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,205
(Gasps) Flee!

276
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:38,716
(Woman screams)

277
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:58,316
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.

278
00:22:58,447 --> 00:22:59,766
(Laughs)

279
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:01,798
This ring is not stone.

280
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:05,681
- l've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.

281
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:17,603
- l don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?

282
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:21,356
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.

283
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:26,607
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.

284
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,797
Three ten.

285
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:30,519
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.

286
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:34,959
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.

287
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:37,681
(Whirring)

288
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:50,120
- l've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.

289
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:54,240
- l suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.

290
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,359
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.

291
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:01,560
- Did you want them to?
- No. l left it there when not at school.

292
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:03,962
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.

293
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:06,396
(Electronic beeping)

294
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,480
l like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.

295
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,245
This won't work.

296
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:18,359
lt could work if the government
would spend more money.

297
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:20,284
Made in America you see.

298
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,805
Another failure.

299
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,885
The idea is...
The idea as l see it

300
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:30,125
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.

301
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:33,956
- What's your electricity bill like?
- lt's sort of a long counterfoil.

302
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:36,282
lt's not dropping off.

303
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:42,202
Voltage!
Voltage...up, up...

304
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:43,646
Up, up!

305
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:47,316
- Are you sure l'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.

306
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:50,484
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.

307
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:52,643
This is English.

308
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:56,282
- ls it green, the earth in America?
- ln some places it's brown.

309
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:57,920
He's not earthed.

310
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:02,040
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. l ask you!

311
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:06,880
Done.

312
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:10,802
- 5... 4...
- Come on.

313
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:16,442
3-2-1 -go! l observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.

314
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,797
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.

315
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:22,761
lt's the plugs.
Good British plugs.

316
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:27,005
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.

317
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:29,243
- How do you feel?
- l used to use my hands.

318
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,358
He used to use his hands.

319
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:36,159
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?

320
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,404
- Voltage...up!
- l'm no mean hand at the old sticks.

321
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:43,439
The voltage, up, up, up!

322
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,877
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!

323
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,564
The bunker!

324
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,723
(Electronic humming)

325
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:03,486
- l can't watch.
- lt's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.

326
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:05,723
(Whirring)

327
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:12,525
Stop it!

328
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:14,603
lt's more than my job's worth!

329
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:17,799
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.

330
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:20,839
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!

331
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:33,525
Fantastic!

332
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:37,720
With a ring like that l could,
dare l say it, rule the world.

333
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,805
l must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.

334
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:44,840
Get your hands off him
or l'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!

335
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:46,605
The laser...

336
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:50,515
- Get him off.
- l must have this ring. The laser.

337
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:56,446
Halt! Release him or l'll shoot
and l am a dead eyeshot shooting.

338
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,001
- l've got it.
- Switch off that machine.

339
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,483
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...

340
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:07,758
l'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.

341
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:11,243
MlT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.

342
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:13,676
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.

343
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:16,799
That's where l get it from,
my love of animals.

344
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:20,636
They trust me.
l should have been in vivisection.

345
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:24,555
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.

346
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:27,997
Well, that was a mistake.
l can vouch for her. We're very close.

347
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:31,526
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!

348
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,918
(Laser Beeps)

349
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:37,365
(Bang)

350
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:41,480
lt's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.

351
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:46,921
lt's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

352
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,563
( THE BEATLES:
''You've Got to Hide Your Love Away'')

353
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:56,236
Here l stand with head in hand

354
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:59,359
Turn my face to the wall

355
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:04,366
lf she's gone l can't go on

356
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:09,117
Feeling two foot small

357
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:14,201
Ev'rywhere people stare

358
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:17,205
Each and ev'ryday

359
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:22,000
l can see them laugh at me

360
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:26,723
And l hear them say

361
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:35,758
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''

362
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:42,557
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''

363
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:49,600
How can l even try?

364
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:52,719
l can never win

365
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:57,561
Hearing them, seeing them

366
00:28:57,687 --> 00:29:03,159
ln the state l'm in

367
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:07,405
How could she say to me

368
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:10,166
''Love will find a way''?

369
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:15,121
Gather 'round all you clowns

370
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:20,367
Let me hear you say

371
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:28,280
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''

372
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:36,279
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''

373
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,765
l have here...

374
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:00,798
(Gasps)

375
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:03,839
Now see what you've done
with your filthy Eastern ways.

376
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:07,642
No! lt is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.

377
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:11,237
(Posh accent) How do we know
you're not sent by him to nick the ring,

378
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,756
when you've lulled us
with your filthy ways?

379
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:17,357
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.

380
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:21,605
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen

381
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:24,560
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.

382
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:28,316
Now my sister is safe and rises up.

383
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,159
(Soft clang)

384
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:39,680
(Ahme ) 'And a new day dawns,
a new victim is chosen...'

385
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:43,686
From this moment it is death to him
who wears the ring.

386
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:48,515
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.

387
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,126
Don't look.

388
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:53,398
Alas, if he were brave
this would not be necessary.

389
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,362
(Birds chirp)

390
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:09,123
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.

391
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:13,684
You're as bad as your sister, coming
home from work at all hours and colours.

392
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:23,757
There might be some insurance.

393
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:26,640
l wouldn't think of such a thing!
Find out.

394
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,962
What did you say that stuff is?

395
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:33,205
This will just make his finger shrink
a little. lt's a minor medical secret.

396
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,682
l'm sure there's no call for all this.

397
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:39,766
l'm allergic to Penicillin
and all them other wonder drugs.

398
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:43,243
- Gum?
- Are you sure it's not or habit forming?

399
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:46,086
No. As long as you don't swallow it.

400
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:06,526
(Whispers) All right.
Synchronise your watches.

401
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:09,639
You, you, you and you.
Paint him red and then kill him.

402
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:18,006
Kaili.

403
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:21,199
Kaili. Kaili.

404
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:25,559
l promise you
the effect is purely transitory.

405
00:32:25,687 --> 00:32:27,200
lt wears off very quickly.

406
00:32:27,327 --> 00:32:30,876
(Doorbell rings)
(Ahme ) Don't answer it! lt's Clang.

407
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:33,958
(Hollering and knocking)

408
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:37,716
- Perhaps it won't take...
- This is a dreadful miscarriage.

409
00:32:37,847 --> 00:32:39,326
(Hollering)

410
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:41,756
(Ringo ) Come on, my finger!

411
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,398
Where's Paul?

412
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:48,236
Where's Paul? Come on, Paul,
stop messing about.

413
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:51,163
Where's he gone?

414
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:53,642
- Where are you, Paul?
- lt's his best suit.

415
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:17,482
Don't look right or left. They might take
us for innocent bystanders.

416
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:21,684
(Baby crying)

417
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:27,121
- Standby.
- (Whispers) Standby.

418
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:29,715
Look out!
They're coming through the door!

419
00:33:29,847 --> 00:33:31,997
(Knocking)

420
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:38,278
- Go!
- Go!

421
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:44,077
(Yells) Kaili!

422
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:52,237
Kaili... Oh!

423
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:58,876
- Sorry, l hit him.
- Oh!

424
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:03,845
Get me the home office.
He's wrecking my home.

425
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:06,401
Kaili! Kaili!

426
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,559
(Gasps) Get off!

427
00:34:14,047 --> 00:34:16,959
- lt's me, you fool.
- Oh, sorry.

428
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:18,725
Well, stop it!

429
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,562
Feet! Feet, you fool!

430
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,759
(Growls)

431
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:17,438
(Sobs)

432
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:22,559
Kaili! He's red! Kill him!

433
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:28,078
(Gunshot)

434
00:35:35,287 --> 00:35:38,199
Oh, my goodness gosh!
Withdraw! Withdraw!

435
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:40,045
Up!

436
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:42,759
Up, up, up!

437
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,878
- You!
- Which one has the ring?

438
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:47,282
That one with the large ned.

439
00:35:47,407 --> 00:35:49,318
Neb!
And it's yours.

440
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:53,599
- Keep your hands up.
- How can l get it off with my hands up?

441
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:56,842
ln the name of science
l demand that ring.

442
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:58,446
lt's yours!

443
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:01,684
- lt's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.

444
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:06,119
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.

445
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:10,160
With a ring like that
could l interest the military?

446
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:11,766
No, l could not.

447
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:13,957
l can't get it off.

448
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,165
(Squelch)

449
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:20,917
- Paul?
- Look, what you've done.

450
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:24,517
- Hey, is that Paul?
- Algernon, my little black bag.

451
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:26,683
l shall have to operate.

452
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,287
lt'll be on the National Health,
won't it?

453
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:32,398
- (Whooshing)
- Look!

454
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:37,359
Ugh! l'm all sticky. You're all red!

455
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,285
- We thought that was you.
- No that's not me.

456
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,205
l'm glad it wore off quickly.

457
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:45,884
What are you doing here?

458
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:49,403
- (Hammer clicks)
- Get out!

459
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:55,960
British, you see! Useless.
lf l had a Luger...

460
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:59,477
Their scientists are properly equipped.
Think on it.

461
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:04,442
The remedy is in your hands...
you, the voters.

462
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,363
- Where's Ahme?
- l don't know.

463
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:20,085
(Speaks in Eastern language )

464
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:28,006
(Continues speaking
in Eastern language )

465
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:31,526
- Hai?
- What? Yes... Hai.

466
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:35,435
(Continues speaking
in Eastern language )

467
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,400
l don't understand a word.
l don't speak the language.

468
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:40,677
Latin, yes. But this Eastern babble, no.

But when you told me

630
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:56,566
You don't want my loving anymore

631
00:49:58,487 --> 00:50:01,285
That's when it hurt me

632
00:50:01,407 --> 00:50:05,878
And feeling like this
l just can't go on anymore

633

Please remember
how l feel about you

l could never really live
without you

635
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:26,162
So come on back and see

636
00:50:26,287 --> 00:50:29,518
Just what you mean to me

637
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:31,319

- Show us your hand, Ringo.

- lt won't affect it.

you know.

- Manchester has a good drummer.

Well, l don't just drum with it, do l?

- What else then?
- l use it, you know.

use of that finger, have we?

- And again.

a useless member.

into the snow for his mates.

- And again.
- You're joking!

745

Just hold this drumstick.

746
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:14,759
You've raised it a little bundle
on the quiet.

747
01:00:14,887 --> 01:00:17,720
- lt's like having a tooth out.
- l've got a good hand.

You only lay out money
is when you've got five aces.

- Do you want to see me?
- You're joking... take it.

750

751

- Cut.
- No!

752

l think tea, don't you? Tea.

753
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:35,365
They expect me to cut my finger off.

754
01:00:35,487 --> 01:00:36,966
The famous finger, eh?

755
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:40,363
So the police are extended
giving the famous protection,

756
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:43,877
for which we are justly proud
in this country, for a finger, eh?

757
01:00:45,887 --> 01:00:48,481
What's that... lt's haunted, you know.

758
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:52,759
- Are you going to cut?
- No, l'm not and let that be an end to it.

759
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:55,003
End to it!

760
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:57,436
This wing of the palace is haunted.

761
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,237
We won't leave this palace alive.

762
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:18,757
The Queen will have something
to say about that.

763
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,003
- What's that?
- l beg your pardon?

764
01:01:21,127 --> 01:01:24,961
- That thing coming through his stomach.
- l daren't look!

765
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:33,403
lt's only a hose.

766
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,602
(Whistle blows softly)

767
01:01:39,727 --> 01:01:43,402
- lt's for you.
- lt's the gardener.

768
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:51,397
l'll stick it out the window.

Must be their tea break.

Hands up!

775
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,763
Hands up! Quick!

776
01:02:19,887 --> 01:02:22,640
Come on, lets have you.

777
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:25,076
Steady!

778
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:30,759
There goes my knighthood.
You, left hand...

779
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:35,117
Lets have that ring.

780
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:40,125
(Gunshots)

781
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:54,878
lt's me, you fool.

782
01:02:57,367 --> 01:03:00,882
- Quick! Quick!
- Let's catch him!

783
01:03:01,007 --> 01:03:03,601
This should work,
it's from Harvard.

784
01:03:04,407 --> 01:03:08,559
- lt looks like a laser.
- lt's a relativity cadenza.

785
01:03:08,687 --> 01:03:10,757
That should slow them down a bit.

786
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,560
There, point it down the hall.
Quickly!

787
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:18,955
Hurry up with the plug,

to set a trap!

- What does he say?

930

Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.

931
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:41,285
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.

932
01:16:41,407 --> 01:16:45,366
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! l saw those footprints...

After them...slowly!

936
01:17:22,207 --> 01:17:26,439
- That's not it, is it?
- lt's on the map as being here.

937
01:17:26,567 --> 01:17:31,163
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...

938
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:34,916
- l'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?

939
01:17:35,047 --> 01:17:39,120
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. lt's gone.

940
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:42,000
l hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.

941

- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.

942
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:49,722
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples

943
01:17:49,847 --> 01:17:52,315
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.

944
01:17:52,447 --> 01:17:54,961
That's my theory.

945
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,759
Ugh!

946
01:17:56,887 --> 01:17:59,321
- Aren't we going in?
- No, let's not.

947
01:17:59,447 --> 01:18:02,166
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?

948
01:18:02,287 --> 01:18:04,926
- l haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.

949
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:06,685
- l have had.
- l will have.

950
01:18:08,607 --> 01:18:11,201
He's a bit soft that lnspector,
isn't he?

951
01:18:11,327 --> 01:18:13,363
He never takes his hat off.

952
01:18:13,487 --> 01:18:15,955
lt's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.

953
01:18:31,287 --> 01:18:33,198
- l'm off.
- Typical!

954
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,164
(Yells) Kaili!

955
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:40,118
Argh!

956
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:42,283
- Kaili!
- Kaili!

957
01:18:44,847 --> 01:18:46,644
(Electric buzz)

958
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:51,204
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.

959
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:52,965
The fiends!

960
01:19:06,887 --> 01:19:09,082
(Hollers) Help me!

961
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:10,526
Help!

962
01:19:10,647 --> 01:19:12,365
He's mine!

963
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:14,486
Help!

964
01:19:16,087 --> 01:19:17,566
Help me!

965
01:19:43,407 --> 01:19:46,240
There's one on the back,
but it's not the right one.

966
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:52,921
Come here, boy! Let me explain.

967
01:19:54,927 --> 01:19:57,999
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.

968
01:20:01,287 --> 01:20:03,562
Back up and smash him off.

969
01:20:03,687 --> 01:20:06,360
(Algernon) Now, this will get him!

970
01:20:08,127 --> 01:20:11,119
Oh! Never mind. Try again.

971
01:20:12,527 --> 01:20:14,404
This should give him a headache.

972
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:19,638
Where's he gone?

973
01:20:21,007 --> 01:20:24,204
- That's done it, he's gone.
- l can't start the car.

974
01:20:24,327 --> 01:20:26,761
- (Engine splutters)
- Hello.

975
01:20:26,887 --> 01:20:29,640
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...

976
01:20:31,887 --> 01:20:33,081
On, on!

977
01:20:37,007 --> 01:20:39,237
l seem to be having
a slight difficulty.

978
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:42,279
To the right! oh...

979
01:20:51,647 --> 01:20:53,842
- l think it might be the wrong key.
- On!

980
01:20:56,967 --> 01:20:58,719
On!

981
01:21:00,127 --> 01:21:02,641
(Engine starts)

982
01:21:05,047 --> 01:21:07,515
(Algernon) Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?

983
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:22,798
Thanks for the lift, sailor!

984
01:21:29,287 --> 01:21:31,847
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.

985
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:34,083
- He's got a plan.
- A very famous plan.

986
01:21:34,207 --> 01:21:36,163
Superintendent, you've got a plan.

987
01:21:36,287 --> 01:21:38,198
- Yes...
- Superintendent.

988
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:39,646
l've got a plan.

989
01:23:21,927 --> 01:23:23,997
(Hollers) Ringo!

990
01:23:24,127 --> 01:23:25,685
Ringo!

991
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:28,560
- Ringo!
- Ringo!

992
01:23:28,687 --> 01:23:31,406
- Ringo!
- Ringo!

993
01:23:31,527 --> 01:23:33,006
Ringo!

994
01:23:33,127 --> 01:23:35,163
(Dogs bark)

995
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:36,845
Ringo!

996
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:48,205
All right, talk!

997
01:23:48,327 --> 01:23:51,239
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?

998
01:23:55,887 --> 01:23:58,355
- l'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?

999
01:23:58,487 --> 01:24:01,126
- l'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.

1000
01:24:01,247 --> 01:24:04,045
Alas... Scalpel.

1001
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:05,680
Sca...

1002
01:24:13,207 --> 01:24:15,801
Sand in the generator.

1003
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:19,397
lt gets everywhere. No wonder
l never get anything done.

1004
01:24:19,527 --> 01:24:21,677
Fix it, Algernon.

1005
01:24:22,487 --> 01:24:25,240
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.

1006
01:24:25,367 --> 01:24:26,686
Fix it!

1007
01:24:26,807 --> 01:24:30,800
l'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.

1008
01:24:30,927 --> 01:24:34,078
- lt's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.

1009
01:24:38,487 --> 01:24:40,000
l've got some juice.

1010
01:24:41,087 --> 01:24:45,080
(Ringo ) l can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!

1011
01:24:45,207 --> 01:24:49,405
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.

1012
01:24:49,527 --> 01:24:50,880
Hands up!

1013
01:24:52,807 --> 01:24:55,446
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence...

1014
01:24:55,567 --> 01:25:00,163
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?

1015
01:25:00,287 --> 01:25:05,566
At last! l'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tiberius Foot Juice!

1016
01:25:05,687 --> 01:25:08,724
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that l have this.

1017
01:25:08,847 --> 01:25:11,486
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...

1018
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:15,919
lt's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!

1019
01:25:16,047 --> 01:25:18,766
The government in the palm of my hand.
What's it say?

1020
01:25:18,887 --> 01:25:21,162
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!

1021
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:24,563
- (Algernon) l don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?

1022
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:27,804
- (Algernon) l don't think so.
- Let's get it translated.

1023
01:25:27,927 --> 01:25:29,599
- Now!
- Right!

1024
01:25:34,007 --> 01:25:37,079
- l can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?

1025
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:46,241
(Clang) Treacherous Woman,
tremble...

1026
01:25:47,127 --> 01:25:50,164
ln the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains,

1027
01:25:50,287 --> 01:25:53,120
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.

1028
01:25:53,247 --> 01:25:55,841
- Wait till my mates get you.
- l don't think so...

1029
01:25:55,967 --> 01:26:00,757
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.

1030
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:03,447
They're quite merciless.

1031
01:26:03,567 --> 01:26:06,479
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.

1032
01:26:09,527 --> 01:26:12,087
Oh, mother Kaili,

1033
01:26:12,207 --> 01:26:14,163
whose name is the Terrible...

1034
01:26:14,287 --> 01:26:16,278
l'm going to miss the sacrifice.

1035
01:26:16,407 --> 01:26:19,205
(Clang) ...whose name
is the lnaccessible,

1036
01:26:19,327 --> 01:26:23,843
whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness!

1037
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:26,365
We turn our hearts to...

1038
01:26:26,487 --> 01:26:28,239
(Ringo ) No!

1039
01:26:28,367 --> 01:26:30,198
(Clang) ...drinker of blood...

1040
01:26:30,327 --> 01:26:33,125
- lt's off! l'm saved!
- ...killer of demons,

1041
01:26:33,247 --> 01:26:37,160
drink of this vessel,
gorge on this blood, our offering...

1042
01:26:37,287 --> 01:26:40,120
Get sacrificed!
l don't subscribe to your religion!

1043
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:45,326
- There he is!
- lt just came off!

1044
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:47,199
(Yells) Quickly! After them!

1045
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,283
l'm going to miss the sacrifice.

1046
01:26:49,407 --> 01:26:53,116
- lt came off! l just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?

1047
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:56,364
- You're all red again.
- l'm beginning to like it.

1048
01:26:56,487 --> 01:26:59,559
Ah... So! Ha!

1049
01:26:59,687 --> 01:27:01,723
He who wears the ring...

1050
01:27:02,407 --> 01:27:04,477
Help! l need somebody

1051
01:27:04,607 --> 01:27:07,041
Help! Not just anybody

1052
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:09,556
Help! You know l need someone

1053
01:27:09,687 --> 01:27:11,200
Help!

1054
01:27:12,167 --> 01:27:17,287
When l was younger,
so much younger than today

1055
01:27:17,407 --> 01:27:21,639
l never needed anybody's help
in any way

1056
01:27:22,527 --> 01:27:27,647
But now these days are gone
l'm not so self assured

Won't you please, please help me?

1062

And now my life has changed
