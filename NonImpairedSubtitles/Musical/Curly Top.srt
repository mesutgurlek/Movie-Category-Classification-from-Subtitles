I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,916
If I should die before I wake,

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,436
I pray the Lord my soul do take.

God bless Mrs Higgins.

00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,550
God bless Mrs Denham.

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,715
And God bless the trustees,
and please make us good children.

Please take very good care

You'll get me in trouble.

21
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,593
What you need, Spunky, is a hot lemonade.

22
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,672
Will you be quiet?

23
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,631
Spunky, do you like the superintendent?

24
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,836
What? What?

25
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,594
Do you like Mrs Denham?

26
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,240
Do you like the trustees?

27
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,675
Do you like me, Spunky?

28
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,751
Spunk?

29
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,351
<i>(cock crows)</i>

30
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,510
Good morning. Nothing must be allowed
to go wrong today. Absolutely nothing.

31
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,957
I hope to please all the trustees, but I'm
anxious that we make a good impression

32
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,951
- on Mr Morgan.
- I think I understand.

33
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,793
You think? Why, that isn't good enough.

34
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,872
Read that, Henrietta.
Read it carefully.

35
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,673
Mr Morgan is our richest trustee.
He's coming here today for the first time.

36
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,231
If he is really pleased with the orphanage,
I believe he'll double his donation to us.

37
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,880
- Oh, how wonderful.
- Exactly.

38
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,428
- Seven o'clock. Call the children.
- Very well.

39
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,355
Henrietta, I forgot. Mr James Wyckoff
will be among the trustees who will visit.

40
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,433
I want you to make sure a large bottle
of Mr Wyckoffs famous cough mixture

41
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,750
is displayed in our medicine cabinet.

42
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,831
I'll see to it.

43
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,076
Elizabeth Blair, what have you got
to say for yourself?

44
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,511
Oh, my goodness!

45
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,113
Elizabeth Blair, come into my office - at once.

46
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,270
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,395
This is the second time in a month you've
been called to the superintendents office.

48
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,630
- Yes, ma'am.
- The last time you were here,

49
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,756
your sister Mary was also brought before me.

50
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,914
You both admitted that you had been
singing and dancing without permission.

51
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,596
- Yes, ma'am.
- Do you know why you are here this time?

52
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,513
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then tell me why.

53
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,271
Don't you know?

54
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,592
Quiet. Now, Elizabeth,
tell me why you are here.

55
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,794
- Because I took a pony to bed with me.
- Child, you're absolutely uncontrollable.

56
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,836
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,550
I am well aware that your late father
and mother were in the theatrical profession

58
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,552
and that you came here
with no sense of discipline.

59
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,915
I have made every allowance for you.

60
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,595
But when you bring animals
into the dormitory, I must act.

61
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,069
That's what my daddy and mummy
used to do.

62
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,230
- What?
- Act.

63
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,990
Don't be impudent.

64
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,390
Now, your pony and your duck
will be sold immediately.

65
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,789
Please, Mrs Higgins, please.

66
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,510
I'll be good, but don't take Spunky
away from me, and my poor little duck.

67
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,828
And why not?

68
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,356
Because my pony and my duck
are notjust ordinary animals.

69
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,750
My daddy and my mommy
teached them to do tricks on the stage.

70
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,150
And just what is your duck trained to do?

71
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,791
My duck does a wonderful trick.
My duck can lay an egg.

72
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,989
- And just what is so wonderful about that?
- Well, can you lay an egg?

73
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,394
Oh, excuse me.

74
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,516
Elizabeth, I have decided to
get rid of your pony and your duck.

75
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,637
- They will be sent away this morning.
- Yes, ma'am.

76
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,711
No sniffling, now.

77
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,439
- Yes, ma'am.
- What?

78
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,033
No, ma'am.

79
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,274
There, baby, don't cry.

80
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,395
Mary, don't let them.

81
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,517
Please don't let them
send Spunky and my duck away.

82
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,910
Oh, darling... Now, listen to me, dear.

83
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,436
Listen very carefully
to what I'm going to tell you.

84
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,999
All right.

85
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,038
Spunky would be very unhappy
if he saw you crying.

86
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,430
- I suppose so.
- You don't want to make him unhappy?

87
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,750
- Oh, no.
- All right, then.

88
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,035
When it's time to say goodbye to Spunky,

89
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,237
you'll have to be just as brave
as brave can be,

90
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,153
so you can make him brave too. See?

91
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,995
- Spunky and I are such awfully good friends.
- I know, dear.

92
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,359
All right, Mary. I'll try and be brave
about Spunky and my duck.

93
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,955
Good for you. Look,
how'd you like to help me get lunch?

94
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,239
I'd love that. I like to make things to eat
and I especially like to eat them.

95
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,679
<i>(</i>? <i>piano plays "Animal Crackers In My Soup'</i>')

96
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,191
Oh, my goodness!

97
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,997
Singing in the dining room! Is this
the kind of manners you teach them?

98
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,153
Of course not, Mr Wyckoff. They've been told
they must be quiet at mealtimes.

99
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,950
Oh, they've been told, have they? Well, just
telling them doesn't seem to be good enough.

100
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,909
Perhaps a bit of real discipline
wouldn't do them any harm.

101
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,879
- Have you been told not to sing?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,475
Then why do you do it?
You're a bad and wicked child.

103
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,677
She isn't a bad and wicked child.
She's just a baby.

104
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,911
She was making the children laugh.
It wasn't her fault.

105
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,150
I told her to sing for the children.

106
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,310
And who are you, young woman?

107
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,472
- Are you an orphan too?
- Yes, sir.

108
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,712
Then what right have you to be here,
living on charity at your age?

109
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,791
I'll tell you what I'm doing here.

110
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,237
I scrub the floors, make the beds, wash,
iron and cook from morning until night.

111
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,470
- Quiet!
- I won't be quiet.

112
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,917
- You're mean and hateful to frighten children.
- Report to me after the meeting.

113
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,069
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,029
The rest of you, go to the yard and wait there
till it's time for inspection by our trustees.

115
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,759
<i>(girls)</i> Yes, Mrs Higgins.

116
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,151
- Aren't you going to join us, Mr Morgan?
- What?

117
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,949
- Yes, of course, the meeting of the trustees.
- Of course.

118
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,635
Would you mind beginning without me?
I'd like to look about the place.

119
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,315
- But we have important matters...
- I'll join you in a few minutes.

120
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,392
- Well, of course...
- Thank you.

121
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,519
She isn't wicked...

122
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,434
- Oh... I'm sorry.
- Please don't get up.

123
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,038
I just wanted to tell you how much I admired
your spunk in standing up for that youngster.

124
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,032
- She didn't mean any harm.
- Of course she didn't.

125
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,271
I don't think singing that song
was such a terrible crime.

126
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,716
I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed your playing, too.

127
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,518
Thank you very much.

128
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,390
Tell me, where in the world did that youngster
pick up such a charming song?

129
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,597
- Well, I write them and...
- You write music?

130
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,070
- If you can call it music.
- I call it delightful music.

131
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,756
Look here, would you promise not to
give me away if I made a terrible confession?

132
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,034
Of course.

133
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,636
The deep, dark secret in my life is that now
and then I compose a bit of music myself.

134
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,077
But isn't it fun, getting a melody
and then finding just the right words for it?

135
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,596
Great. You know, the happiest days of my life

136
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,468
were those I spent studying music
under Professor Auspitzer, in Brünn.

137
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,437
Those must have been happy days.

138
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,354
But that isn't all of it.
I love the people in the little Austrian towns.

139
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,592
They're so proud because their music
is the music of the world.

140
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,676
It seems that most everyone in those quaint
little villages has a "Hello, neighbour" smile.

141
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,513
They love the simple things in life.

142
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,798
The simple things in life.
That almost sounds like the words of a song.

143
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,919
I'll remember the suggestion.
Perhaps someday they might make a song.

144
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,753
- Will you do me a great favour?
- Certainly.

145
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,392
I have to run along to the meeting, but I'll
be back. Will you play me some more music?

146
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,828
- If you'd like to hear it and Mrs Higgins...
- I asked to.

147
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,595
- All right.
- Until later, then?

148
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,233
And what's this item?

149
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,311
"Sandboxes and swings"?

150
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,709
It's a problem to keep them occupied.

151
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,872
When I was young,
we didn't have a play problem,

152
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,430
because we didn't have time to play. No.

153
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,158
"Floor runner for the dormitory."

154
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,199
- What's the matter with the linoleum?
- It's been so cold this winter.

155
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,477
The children have coughed so badly
that I've been worried.

156
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,551
No need for that.

157
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,350
Madam, you have no doubt heard
of the famous Wyckoffs cough mixture.

158
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,839
Of course.

159
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,675
I have manufactured and sold
that cough mixture for many years.

160
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,957
Anyone taking it regularly will never cough.

161
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,952
I would suggest that
you lay in a fresh supply.

162
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,555
- Very well.
- When I was young, I lived in Maine,

163
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,632
where the weather was 20 below zero.

164
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,919
In those days, we didn't even have linoleum.
And look at me now.

165
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,718
When I was young, I lived in Maine, where
the weather was about a thousand below zero.

166
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,033
No, no, Mrs Denham.
No carpets, no linoleum, no nothin'.

167
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,350
And look at me now.

168
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,431
<i>(coughing)</i>

169
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,436
Madam, is this the kind of respect
you teach them?!

170
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,192
Oh, my goodness!

171
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,674
- How dare you take my hat and coat!
- I beg your pardon, but those are mine.

172
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,716
- Yours?
- Yes.

173
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,791
Oh, yes. I see.

174
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,351
- This eyesight of mine is bad, you know.
- I was only playing.

175
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,876
There, Mrs Higgins.
That's what comes of letting them play.

176
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,077
- Ridiculing their benefactors.
- I'm sorry.

177
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,391
It seems to me that this child
is absolutely incorrigible.

178
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,517
Every time I see her,
she's making a disturbance.

179
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,795
- She is rather a problem.
- Problem?

180
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,839
She's the sort of problem that might be
better solved at a public institution.

181
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,230
- We couldn't send her away.
- I say you <i>shall</i> send her away!

182
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,959
I say she'll have to go to a public institution.

183
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,235
She'll have to do nothing of the kind.

184
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,959
If she's sent away,
I shan't contribute another cent.

185
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,476
- Now, Mr Morgan, you can't...
- Oh, yes, I can.

186
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,394
Mrs Higgins, I'd like to talk to you
and to this little girl privately.

187
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,873
- Your office would be the best place.
- Why, of course, Mr Morgan.

188
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,117
Young lady, I've got a great idea.

189
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,998
Would you like me to tell it to you?

190
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,790
- Yes.
- Elizabeth.

191
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,916
Excuse me. Yes, sir.

192
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,638
That's better.

193
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,237
Now look here. Here's the secret.

194
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,953
How would you like it if you and I
got to be very, very good friends?

195
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,352
- I don't think I would like it, sir.
- Why, Elizabeth!

196
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,318
I would like to talk to Elizabeth alone.
Do you mind?

197
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,675
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

198
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,035
Tell me. Why wouldn't you like to be
friends with me?

199
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,430
- Oh, just because.
- Just because?

200
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,592
You've got to give me
a much better reason than that.

201
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,673
Well, it's just because
when grown-ups come to visit us

202
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,029
we have to say "Yes, ma'am"
and "No, sir" and smile all the time.

203
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,111
- Can you keep a secret?
- A secret?

204
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,519
Mm-hm.

205
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,229
- I won't tell anybody.
- Shake.

206
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,390
Now, here's the secret:

207
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,914
You don't have to say
any of those things to me.

208
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,912
You see, all this business
out here is new to me.

209
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,470
- My regular business is being a lawyer.
- What's a lawyer?

210
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,395
If you ever get into trouble, a lawyer
is a person who gets you out of trouble.

211
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,076
Oh, my, I could use one almost every day.

212
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,072
- Tell me, what's your name, sweet?
- Elizabeth Blair.

213
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,312
Elizabeth Blair. I've got
a much better name for you than that.

214
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,949
If I had my way, I'd call you Curly Top.

215
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,998
That's what my daddy used to call me,
and my mommy too.

216
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,198
They did? I'll bet you're
just as wise as wise can be.

217
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,431
- Well, I can recite.
- Recite? Recite what?

218
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,432
- Oh, poems.
- What kind of poems?

219
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,956
"Before I was a little girl,
I was a little bird.

220
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,477
"I could not laugh, I could not dance,
I could not speak a word.

221
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,189
"But all about the woods I went
and up into the sky.

222
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,398
"And isn't it a pity I've forgotten how to fly?"

223
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,119
I think that's the loveliest poem I ever heard.

224
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,589
- I know more.
- Go right ahead.

225
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,878
"I wake in the morning early,
and always the very first thing,

226
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,399
"I poke out my head, and I sit up in bed,
and I sing and I sing and I sing."

227
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,790
- I know more.
- I'll bet you do.

228
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,914
But listen, I've got a friend that...

229
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,878
- Oh, I bet that isn't true.
- What?

230
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,476
You said you had a friend.
I bet you have lots of friends.

231
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,120
Curly, you are an old flatterer.

232
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,193
- Is that something bad?
- Of course not, darling. Now, look here.

233
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,953
I'm pretty sure this friend of mine
would like you.

234
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,592
I think he'd like to give you a beautiful home,
lovely dresses to wear, dozens of dolls,

235
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,151
and send you to the grandest kind of school
and all sorts of nice things like that.

236
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,394
How could your friend do all that? I thought
only daddies could do such nice things.

237
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,948
Well, being a lawyer,
that's where that comes in.

238
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,478
You are too young to understand, but I could
arrange with my friend to legally adopt you.

239
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,237
All I want you to tell me is how you'd like it if
my friend could do those nice things for you.

240
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,154
- Would you want him to?
- I don't think I could do it.

241
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,879
You couldn't? Why not?

242
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,030
Do I have to say right off?

243
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,953
You mean you want time to think it over?

244
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,354
- Could I come back and tell you in a while?
- Why, of course. I'll wait for you right here.

245
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,670
- Promise?
- Promise.

246
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,796
Cross your heart?

247
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,393
Mary!

248
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,074
Mary! Oh, Mary!

249
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,311
Mary! Mary!

250
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,111
Mary!

251
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,113
Mrs Denham, suppose that youngster
had a real chance in life.

252
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,873
Suppose someone gave her
everything money can buy.

253
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,838
Of course, we always hope
our children may be adopted.

254
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,549
But Elizabeth's case
presents a special problem. You see...

255
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,272
There's no human problem
that can't be solved by kindness.

256
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,115
- By Jove, Mrs Denham, I'll do it.
- You mean that you'll adopt Elizabeth?

257
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,317
On one condition. She must
never know that I'm her guardian.

258
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,674
Why not?

259
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,639
Because she's always had to
give thanks for every mouthful.

260
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,234
She's never gonna have to be grateful to me.

261
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,835
From now on, she's going to have
all the lovely things in life,

262
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,956
just because she has a right to them.

263
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:02,036
- But the child will have to be told something.
- That's right. Let's see.

264
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,118
I've got it. Tell her that I'm acting for a client.

265
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,910
We'll say that she's being adopted
by a man by the name of...

266
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,595
- Let's call him Hiram Jones.
- Oh, Mr Morgan...

267
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,878
Before you go on, there's something
about Elizabeth that you must know.

268
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,393
<i>(knock at door)</i>

269
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,471
Come in.

270
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,959
Well, have you made up your mind?

271
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,589
- You haven't? Why not?
- Could I tell your friend?

272
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,477
My friend?

273
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,710
Oh!

274
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,158
You mean Mr Jones. Hiram Jones, hm?
What is it you want to tell him?

275
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,553
I would like to tell him that I'd love to go and
live in his house if my sister could come too.

276
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,108
- Your sister?
- Yes, my sister, Mary.

277
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,398
- She works in the kitchen. There she is.
- This is Mary Blair, Mr Morgan.

278
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,277
We've met.

279
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,872
Isn't my sister pretty?
And she's awfully nice, too.

280
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,269
Mr Morgan, I'm very grateful to you -

281
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,796
I mean, to your friend -
for wanting to adopt Curly.

282
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,997
But you see, when my father and mother...

283
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,833
- Darling, could you run outside?
- Must I?

284
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,391
- I think you'd better.
- All right.

285
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,234
You see, Mr Morgan, at the time
my father and mother were killed...

286
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,995
- Killed?
- Yes, in an automobile accident.

287
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,915
- I'm so sorry.
- At the hospital, just before they...

288
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,991
just before they died,

289
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,470
I promised them Curly and I
would never be separated.

290
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,078
I couldn't break that promise, Mr Morgan.
She needs me. And I need her.

291
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,594
I understand.

292
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:47,152
I hope you'll thank your friend for us.
Please tell him how grateful we are, but...

293
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,231
Goodbye, Mr Morgan.

294
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,311
<i>(</i>? <i>"It's All So New To Me'</i>')

295
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,234
- I like that.
- Thank you, Aunt Genevieve.

296
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,108
- One of your own compositions?
- The melody came to me only this evening.

297
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,955
Quite the nicest thing you've ever done,
Edward. It has real feeling.

298
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,875
Your little nephew has real feeling,
my darling, just like anyone else.

299
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,155
I'm going upstairs to write some letters.

300
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,118
I'll come down and kiss you good night
before I go to bed.

301
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,350
- Promise?
- I do.

302
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,351
All right, it's a bargain.

303
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,878
In the meantime I shall be thinking up
at least six new compliments for you.

304
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,030
<i>(</i>? <i>resumes "It's All So New To Me'</i>')

305
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,111
Edward?

306
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,030
Edward.

307
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,315
- Aunt Genevieve.
- Well, I'm waiting.

308
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,709
- For what?
- For my compliments, of course.

309
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,598
- You promised me an even half-dozen.
- So I did.

310
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,877
I shan't be able to keep my promise.
I've been very busy.

311
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,951
- Busy.
- Word of honour.

312
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,272
I've been playing an old and charming game.
I've been daydreaming.

313
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,557
Just suppose, for example...
See that painting there?

314
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,316
But of course I do. I'll have you know my
eyesight's every bit as good as it ever was.

315
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,154
Suppose the figure of that lovely child
should suddenly come to life.

316
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,357
Suppose it smiled at you and waved its hand.

317
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,749
- What would you do?
- I'd call a doctor.

318
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,798
Now, Edward, now, now, take it easy.

319
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,158
Well, the truth of the matter is,
I just love your game.

320
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,713
I'd adore it if the child in that picture could
come into this home and actually live with us.

321
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,075
Do you really mean that, Aunt Genevieve?

322
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,632
There's nothing that makes a home so happy
as the sound of a chilïs laughter.

323
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,951
- By Jove, I'll do it.
- Do what?

324
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,435
We'll open our place at Southampton. I can
arrange for all the necessary legal details.

325
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,355
You can do all the shopping required:
Dresses and all the gadgets that go with them.

326
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,035
We'll have a glorious summer.
I'll send the limousine out next week...

327
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,237
- For what?
- For that lovely child in the painting.

328
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,950
Now, Edward, game or no game,
you sound to me a little tetched in the head.

329
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,352
I've gone mad, Aunt Genevieve.
Delightfully mad.

330
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,910
- I think I will send for that doctor.
- I should if I were you.

331
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,834
And before the doctor arrives,
let me be the first to congratulate you.

332
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,789
- Congratulate me? For what?
- My dear, you're about to become a mother.

333
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,074
- Bye, Mrs Denham.
- Bye.

334
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,993
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Mrs Higgins.

335
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,071
Goodbye.

336
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,229
Goodbye, Mrs Higgins.

337
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,197
- All right, Mister.
- Very good, Miss.

338
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,399
Goodbye, Jeanie. Goodbye, Betsy.

339
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,710
- Bye.
- Bye.

340
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,471
<i>(horn beeps)</i>

341
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,399
Henrietta, what are you blubbering about?

342
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,916
I can't help it. I'm so happy.

343
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,754
There's no need to be sentimental.

344
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,831
What are you crying for?

345
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,276
Why shouldn't I? Why can't I be happy too?

346
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,636
Mrs Higgins said that
now we're going to live in high society

347
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,995
we must always remember to be grand ladies.

348
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,152
Oh, I won't forget.

349
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,831
My word!

350
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,038
Will you tell Mr Morgan
that Miss Blair and her sister are here?

351
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,031
Hello, Mister.

352
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,754
Elizabeth.

353
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,513
Am I to understand that the livestock
are also calling on Mr Morgan?

354
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,354
- They are.
- My word!

355
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:28,349
- A Miss Blair and her sister to see you, sir.
- Aunt Genevieve, they're here.

356
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,991
Hello.

357
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,391
Curly!

358
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,597
Well, where in the world
did the menagerie come from?

359
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,592
- They were right behind us all the time.
- Right behind you?

360
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,114
Yes, sir, in the back seat.

361
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,634
Aunt Genevieve, meet our new family.

362
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,919
- Mary, Elizabeth, this is Aunt Genevieve.
- My dears, I'm very glad to see you both.

363
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,592
- Won't you come in?
- Hello.

364
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,591
Hello!

365
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,629
Oh, Reynolds, will you see to it that our
other guests are comfortably taken care of?

366
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,871
You mean the, uh... livestock, sir?

367
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,951
Right.

368
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,632
Butling to a pony and a duck!

369
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,836
Now, no nonsense now.

370
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,151
I say, do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

371
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,276
My word!

372
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,476
- How do you like your new home?
- It's wonderful.

373
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,028
- Would you like to look round?
- Mm-hm.

374
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,113
But first I would like to see where
Spunky and Betsy are going to sleep.

375
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,033
Oh, no, Edward.
Elizabeth must rest before dinner.

376
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,078
- Come now, Aunt...
- Mr Jones has given strict orders.

377
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,039
Mr Jones insists that Elizabeth and Mary
have only the best of care.

378
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,910
- I see. Well, we can't argue with Mr Jones.
- That's what I thought.

379
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,118
All right, then, Mr Jones wins.
But I'll see you all at dinner, hm?

380
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,430
Come, dear.

381
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,514
Breakfast at eight. Luncheon at one.

382
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,791
Dinner at seven.

383
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,231
My word!

384
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,758
I think this will help you, Miss.

385
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,271
Allow me.

386
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,396
Now I'm just like a grown-up.

387
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,278
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Miss.

388
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,956
Why, I didn't do anything.

389
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,430
- Yes, Miss?
- Wouldn't you like to sit down too?

390
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,511
Well...

391
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,751
- <i>(Edward)</i> Coffee on the terrace, Reynolds.
- Very good, sir.

392
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,317
Could I say something
to Mr Reynolds, privately?

393
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,278
I think it could be arranged.
But don't stay too long.

394
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,351
I won't.

395
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,315
I want to thank you for a very nice dinner, sir.

396
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,391
Thank you, Miss.

397
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,198
You wish for something else, Miss?
What is it, Miss?

398
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,829
Couldn't you come down here
so I could talk to you?

399
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,833
<i>(laughing)</i> Oh, my word, you are a package!

400
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,911
Will you be my friend?

401
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,993
Whenever I do anything wrong at the table,
will you always stop me?

402
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,036
I will indeed, Miss.

403
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,395
- Promise?
- I do, Miss.

404
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,758
I'll always attempt to serve you
as if... as if you were a princess.

405
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,311
A princess? My, you are nice.

406
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,953
- Happy?
- I didn't know such happiness existed.

407
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,998
Promise to let me know
if Mr Jones can do more for you?

408
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,310
He couldn't do anything more.

409
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,472
- But you could do me a great favour.
- Done. What?

410
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,233
Tell me all about Mr Jones.

411
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,077
Not knowing him or even what he looks like
makes him seem such a strange person.

412
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,153
He is a strange sort of person, Mary.
Very strange.

413
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,075
Perhaps I can best explain him to you if I tell
you what he said just before you came here.

414
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,515
Do tell me.

415
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,752
He told me that all of his life
he's had a hunger in his heart.

416
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,150
A hunger to love and be loved
just for himself.

417
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,949
Said he'd travelled all over the world
- Europe, Egypt, the Orient -

418
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,750
he'd searched everywhere for a simple
sort of happiness and companionship.

419
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,879
- He never found it?
- Not real happiness.

420
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,589
He will find it someday. He must.

421
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,953
Maybe you're right, Mary.
Happiness may come to Jones, and soon.

422
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,751
Just before he sailed for Europe, he said that,
at last, there was... hope in his heart.

423
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,028
I wish I could thank him for all he's done.

424
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,999
Tell him how grateful I am for all
the happiness he's brought to Curly and me.

425
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,631
Just knowing that you and Curly have
found happiness here, that'll make him happy.

426
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,711
I can promise you that.

427
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,519
This is not a dream, is it?

428
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,989
No, darling. Come to bed now.

429
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,837
- Good night. Did you say your prayers?
- Mm-hm.

430
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,833
- Mary?
- Yes, dear?

431
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,675
My pyjamas feel awfully nice.
What are they made of, Mary?

432
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,433
- Silk.
- Silk?

433
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,590
Oh, my goodness!

434
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,590
Good night, dear.

435
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,671
Good night.

436
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,155
Mary.

437
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,630
Uncle Edward said that Mr Jones was
going to send you to a music school.

438
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,233
Uh-huh.

439
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:06,111
And he said that he was going to give me
a pony cart and lots of pretty dresses.

440
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,670
I know, dear. It's all so wonderful,
I can hardly believe it.

441
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,550
But we mustn't talk about it any more tonight.
It's time to go to sleep. Good night.

442
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,631
Good night.

443
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,070
Mary... is Mr Hiram Jones a very rich man?

444
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,354
He must be, darling.

445
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,319
Do you think maybe he could be
the richest man in the world?

446
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,630
Mm, he might be.

447
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,352
The richest man in all the world?
Oh, my goodness!

448
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,354
- Your Southampton bills, sir.
- Thank you.

449
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,752
Two aquaplane boards. Don't you think
it's dangerous for that youngster to...?

450
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,991
Dangerous? That child swims like a fish.

451
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,074
I really believe
she's Neptune's daughter in disguise.

I hope you enjoyed your lunch,
Miss Elizabeth.

454
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,870
- I always like to eat.
- A splendid habit, Miss, if I may say so.

455
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,680
- Did my pony and duck have a nice lunch?
- Oh, quite, Miss.

456
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:33,673
- Are you going to give me a nice dinner?
- Without fail, Miss.

457
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,031
- I wish you wouldn't bow so much.
- I'm sorry, Miss.

458
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,554
There you go again.

459
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,108
You'll make my back ache.

460
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,195
My word!

461
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,839
<i>- (Curly)</i> Isn't that the funniest picture ever?
<i>- (Aunt Genevieve)</i> Mm-hm.

462
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,718
Curly, careful of your eyes in this sunlight.

463
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,952
Oh, this won't hurt my eyes.
This is just the funny papers.

464
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,635
Isn't that the one I've read you
at least a dozen times since Sunday?

465
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,711
Mm-hm.

466
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,756
- Will you read it to me again?
- Yes, if you like.

467
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,356
But suppose we wait until later
in the afternoon, after you've had your nap?

468
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,352
All right. I won't forget.

469
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,479
Jimmie, the Atlantic Ocean seems rather quiet
without you splashing about.

470
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,678
- Why aren't you swimming today?
- I couldn't make it today. I had to work.

471
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,790
Work? I hope you don't call
flying that airplane of yours work.

472
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,316
Mary loves to fly.
She's been up lots of times with me.

473
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,837
Yes, she's told me all about it.
You've been very nice to Mary this summer.

474
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,630
- That isn't hard to do.
- No, I gathered you didn't find that hard work.

475
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,439
Mrs Graham, I'd like to
talk to you about Mary.

476
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,071
- Well, there's no law against it.
- Mary is a wonderful girl, Mrs Graham.

477
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,435
We've had grand times
together this summer.

478
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,671
Seems that, no matter what,
we always like the same things.

479
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,638
She likes to fly with me,
she's a beautiful dancer,

480
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,076
and we're both crazy about
all kinds of outdoor sport.

481
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,039
I'd like to talk about Mary
to her guardian, Mr Jones.

482
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,433
- But the catch is that he's in Europe now.
- What would you like to say to Mr Jones?

483
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,195
Well, you see, Mary doesn't want to
make up her mind about anything -

484
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,159
I mean, anything important -
without Mr Jones' permission.

485
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,392
- I thought maybe I could write him a letter.
- What about?

486
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,395
Well, I... I really can't tell you that,
Mrs Graham.

487
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,553
- I haven't even told Mary about that.
- Oh, I see.

488
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,358
- Do you think I ought to write to Mr Jones...
- Jimmie.

489
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,671
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Jimmie.

490
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,031
The water was wonderful.
Aunt Genevieve, did you sell him a ticket?

491
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,680
- Mary, I forgot.
- A ticket? For what?

492
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,957
Don't tell me you don't know about it.
We're giving a show.

493
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,999
- Who is? What's this all about?
- It's Curly's show, really.

494
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,992
I'm just going to help out.
It's a benefit performance.

495
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,470
- A benefit? For whom?
- Curly had the most charming idea, Jimmie.

496
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,438
She couldn't forget her friends
in the orphanage.

497
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,638
She wanted to raise some money
to buy playthings for them.

498
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,231
- It was so nice of you to come, Mrs Denham.
- Wild horses couldn't have kept me away.

499
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,393
Do you know,
this is the biggest thrill of my life.

502
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,517
- I'd try awfully hard to make you happy.
- Jimmie, you're pretty swell,

503
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,433
but I... I just couldn't marry you.

504
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,315
Is there someone else?

505
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,710
- I can't tell you that.
- Well, I know there is, all right.

506
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,473
I watched you at dinner tonight
and I watched you...

507
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,757
Well, you're always looking at Mr Morgan.

508
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,276
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because I don't like him.

509
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,512
He's got a swelled head, and just because
he's got all the money in the world, he...

510
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,276
Jimmie... I won't let you
talk about him that way.

511
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,113
I'm sorry.

512
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,192
- It's all right.
- I'll always love you, Mary.

513
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,910
Even... even if you say
you can't really care for me.

514
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,594
Oh, Jimmie...

515
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,473
Do stop that ridiculous prowling about.
You act as if you had the heebie-jeebies.

516
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,030
- I'm just restless.
- You've been restless for the last three days.

517
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,509
Ever since you arrived to see Curly's show.

518
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,878
Can't you think of something more
interesting to talk about? I'm just nervous.

519
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,396
I might be able to change the subject
if I really put my mind to it.

520
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,040
- It'd make a hit with me if you will.
- Very well.

521
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,032
Let me see, what shall we talk about?

522
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,749
- Have you seen Mary since dinner?
- Nope, I haven't.

523
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,833
She, uh... she went out somewhere
with Jimmie, didn't she?

524
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,909
- How should I know?
- Don't they make an adorable couple?

525
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,560
- Do they?
- He's very much in love with her.

526
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,269
He's a wonderful catch. He comes into money
on both sides of his family.

527
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,636
He does, does he? Maybe that's
the reason he's got a swelled head.

528
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,280
That, and the brass buttons
on his trick uniform.

529
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,477
Why, Edward, I didn't know
you'd ever noticed Jimmie.

530
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,633
I am surprised to learn that you've even
observed the kind of clothes he wears.

531
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,711
Conceited young idler.

532
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,950
<i>(Genevieve laughs)</i>

- I will not.

534
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,631
Edward Morgan, insanely jealous,
and acting like a sixteen-year-old Romeo.

535
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,234
Oh, dear, this is
the happiest moment of my life.

536
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,313
I'm not at all jealous. Do you think
I care anything about Mary Blair?

537
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,235
The only reason she's here is because it was
impossible to take Elizabeth without her.

538
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,838
- I'm not in the least interested in Mary.
- I'm so relieved to hear you say that.

539
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,151
- Relieved? Why?
- Edward, I've been noticing things.

540
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,676
And I had convinced myself
that you'd grown very fond of Mary.

541
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,275
- In which case, there might be complications.
- Complications?

542
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,510
I'll try to make myself clear.

543
00:59:54,600 --> 01:00:00,391
I believe that Jimmie Rogers means to
propose to Mary before the summer is over.

544
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,837
- How do you know that?
- I looked at him.

545
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,708
You think you can tell a thing like that
by just looking at a man?

546
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,839
Any woman of my age and experience
who can't tell just by looking at a man...

547
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,070
Oh, nonsense!

548
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,151
What are you thinking about?

549
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,595
- I'm not thinking. I've decided.
- Decided what?

550
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,798
- I'll get the fastest plane in the country.
- You aren't going to fly it yourself?

551
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,791
Certainly. Why not?

552
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:33,194
And that isn't all. I'm going to start learning
some of those trick dances, too.

553
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,559
- I'll make you happy, Mary. I know I will.
- I believe you, Jimmie.

554
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,518
- Oh, hello, Mr Morgan.
- Jimmie, will you pardon me?

555
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,036
- Mary, I want to talk to you alone.
- You'll have to ask me about that, sir.

556
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,792
- What?
- Jimmie.

557
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,236
I want to tell him. I'm the luckiest man
in the world, Mr Morgan.

558
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,311
Lucky? What do you mean?

559
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,472
- Mary and I have just become engaged, sir.
- Engaged?

560
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:02,477
That's right, sir. The way I feel about it, well,
I just want to go out and tell the whole world.

561
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,951
I understand, Jimmie.
You should be very proud.

562
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,191
Mary's a fine girl.

563
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,277
- I want to be the first to congratulate you.
- Thank you, sir.

564
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,432
Mary, my congratulations to you.

565
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,919
I'm sure that you and Jimmie
will find real happiness.

566
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,798
- I'll do everything to make that come true.
- I'm sure.

567
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,432
And if there's ever anything I can do to add
to your happiness - anything, understand? - 

568
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,433
- I want you to promise to let me know.
- Say, Mr Morgan, you're pretty swell.

569
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,830
- I mean it, Jimmie, every word of it.
- Thank you, sir.

Well, good night. Good night

I like Sunday school. Will you take me?

01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:18,277
- Any special reason you wanted to see me?
- Very special.

593
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:24,708
- I wanted to talk to you about something.
- All right, here I am. What is it?

594
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,236
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about getting married.

595
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,993
What?! <i>(chuckles)</i>

596
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,198
Curly, whatever put that notion
into your funny little head?

597
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,957
- Please don't laugh, Uncle Edward.
- I'm sorry. I forgot that this was very special.

598
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,874
Now, just what is it you want to know
about getting married?

599
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,954
- Well... what does getting married mean?
- You mean like Jimmie and Mary?

600
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:54,875
That means they'll have their own home
and always live together.

601
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,758
Mary said that I was going to
live in Jimmie's house.

602
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,513
Does that mean Jimmie's
getting married to me too?

603
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:05,469
- I'll tell you all about that some other time.
- I don't want to get married to Jimmie.

604
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,872
- Why not?
- I want Mary and me to get married to you.

605
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,989
Curly, you're a designing woman.

606
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,835
Now get up and get out of here.
I've got to get dressed. Do you hear me?

607
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,592
Come on.

608
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,470
Now, breakfast, funnies,
Sunday school and lunch.

609
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,269
- Then I've got a real surprise for you.
- Is it a present?

610
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,669
It wouldn't be a surprise
any more if I told you.

611
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,955
Mary! Mary!

612
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,791
<i>(</i>? <i>"When I Grow Up'</i>')

613
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,839
My word!

614
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,991
<i>(</i>? <i>"When I Grow Up'</i>')

615
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,071
<i>(laughter)</i>

616
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,911
- Look at Aunt Genevieve.
- Edward, how dare you spy on me!

617
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,072
- What's the matter, growing pains?
- Why shouldn't I grow up?

618
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,109
- Please, Uncle Edward, what's my surprise?
- I have two surprises for you, young lady.

619
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,191
- Two?!
- Mm-hm.

620
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,030
Come on, darling.

621
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,475
- Ready for the first one?
- I can hardly wait.

622
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,994
You won't have to wait - not another minute.

623
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,277
You sit right here
and listen very, very carefully.

624
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,999
All right.

625
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,791
<i>(</i>? <i>"Curly Top'</i>')

626
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,234
Whoopee!

627
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,199
- Oh, but you are a bundle ofjoy.
- That was beautiful, dear.

628
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,589
Thank you.
Have you got a present for me too?

629
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,955
Yes, one for you and one for Mary.

630
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,271
- Will you run and tell Mary to come in?
- Mm-hm.

631
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,828
Mary! Mary!

632
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,673
Uncle Edward has a surprise for us.

633
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,672
You might as well admit
that you're in love with Mary.

634
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,435
- Why don't you tell her so?
- Haven't you heard the news?

635
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,080
It so happens that
Mary's engaged to Jimmie.

636
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,197
Have you ever told her that <i>you</i> love her?

637
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,590
Here she is, Uncle Edward.

638
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,238
- Can I have my surprise first?
- Yes, indeed you may.

639
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,754
- Oh, goodie.
- Here you are, young lady.

640
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,035
A string of pearls.

641
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,031
Pearls?

642
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,032
They lookjust like those
little stones on the beach.

643
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,635
- Oh, Elizabeth!
- Do you like them?

644
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,439
I would really rather have
a pair of roller skates.

645
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,159
Well, we'll throw them in for good measure.

646
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,351
I'm sailing for Europe next week.

647
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:14,833
Before I go, I want to give you an engagement
present and wish you every happiness.

648
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,911
I can't take it.

649
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,514
Why not?

650
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:24,594
I wasn't really in love with Jimmie.
We're not engaged any more.

651
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,240
I told him last night.

652
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,993
- You aren't going to marry him?
- No.

653
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,230
- Mary, you'd better watch out.
- Watch out?

654
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,311
You might not get married at all.

655
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:42,430
I asked Uncle Edward to marry us
this morning and he said he wouldn't.

656
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,155
- Oh, Elizabeth, you didn't?
- Oh, yes, I did.

657
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,038
Didn't I ask you to marry us, Uncle Edward?

658
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,270
Oh, Elizabeth!

659
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,352
Mary, wait. I... I want to talk with you.

660
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,075
What's the matter?
They seem kind of excited.

661
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,637
- We'll go abroad and stay a whole year.
- It sounds like heaven.

662
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,838
- We'll make it heaven, darling.
- Look, can't we share our happiness?

663
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,799
- What do you mean?
- With the person who made it possible.

664
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,075
- You mean Mr Jones?
- Yes.

665
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:23,712
Oh, Mary, you blind little sweetheart.
There never was any Mr Jones.

666
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,837
- You mean that... you're Mr...?
- Mm-hm.

667
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,512
Oh!

668
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:34,470
Mary, do you mind if Uncle Edward
could come now and read me the funnies?

669
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,991
Oh, my word!

670
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:15,478
