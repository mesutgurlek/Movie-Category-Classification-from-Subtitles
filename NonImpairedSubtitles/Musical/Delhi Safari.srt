1
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,198
We won't leave this place.

2
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:46,235
It's not just a jungle.
It's our home.

3
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:52,241
I have lost my papa.
Now I don't want to lose my home.

4
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,599
Time please, dad. Time please.

5
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,662
That's it. Give up?
- No chance.

6
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,367
Exactly. You stand no chance.

7
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,605
I will hit once.
But it will be a severe blow.

8
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,171
Oh, God! But, son, you only
know how to say dialogues, right?

9
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,378
After all, he is like his father.

10
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:06,423
I was crazy about these charms.
When...when..

11
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,288
When I decided to make you my wife.

12
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,990
Wow! Well said, son.

13
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,260
Another dialogue.
And I will smack you both on your bum.

14
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,496
Wow! You are a poet, mom.

15
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:23,169
Very funny. You be quiet.
And you stop fighting.

16
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,071
Do you intend to make
my Yuvi Rambo in a day?

17
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,410
I was teaching him self-defense.

18
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,209
I am making him a man.

19
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,275
Exactly. He is not a man.
He is a cub.

20
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,618
Mom, please chill.
- No, I am not going to.

21
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,486
What if you get hurt?
And what do you know..

22
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,584
What a mother goes through!
- What a mother goes through!

23
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,388
Fine! Do whatever you want!

24
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,261
Don't come to me crying.

25
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,667
I think tonight you will
have to sleep outside the cave.

26
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,607
Don't worry, son.
I know how to placate your mother.

27
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,340
How?
- With a song.

28
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,674
You are my world.

29
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,348
I am speaking the truth.
Believe me.

30
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,323
Why are you upset?

31
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,257
With me.

32
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,694
Understand my plight wordlessly.

33
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:21,291
Your anger is fake, fake, fake.

34
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,302
It's not real.

35
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:32,541
It's not good to hurt
and torment me, beloved.

36
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:39,081
O beloved.

37
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:46,387
O beloved.

38
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:52,057
Don't skirt eyes. Smile.

39
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,133
Adorn my dreams.

40
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:02,101
I will keep both my worlds.

41
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,702
At your feet.

42
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,269
I don't want to live without you.

43
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,250
Don't want to live.

44
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:20,251
I am wherever you are, beloved.

45
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:25,123
I will go away from your world.

46
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,399
You can't influence me.

47
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,371
Don't flatter me.

48
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,501
You know how to entice.

49
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:45,576
I have come back to you, defeated.

50
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:52,814
Withered flowers of
love will blossom.

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,094
O beloved.

52
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:07,230
O beloved.

53
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,101
O beloved.

54
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,384
Sultan!

55
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,265
Yuvi!

56
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,118
Sultan!

57
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,757
Yuvi!

58
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,292
Papa!

59
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,750
Yuvi!

60
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,084
If papa had been alive,
and one of us had been shot..

61
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,494
..would he have left this place?

62
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,499
There is a huge difference
between your papa and us, Yuvi.

63
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,501
We are not strong like him, son.

64
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,301
But he always considered
all of you his strength.

65
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,963
If he is not there, we..
- If he is not there,..

66
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,133
.. then we can't do anything.

67
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,006
Today he was shot.
Tomorrow we might be shot.

68
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,013
As it is, what difference does it
make if we live here or elsewhere?

69
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,445
If we go somewhere else,
at least we will survive.

70
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,179
Yes! True! Absolutely right!
- Absolutely right!

71
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,448
All of you are cowards.

72
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,214
Real cowards.

73
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,759
So what if the King is not there?

74
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,722
His commander is
with all of you, right?

75
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,259
Those who have
encroached on our home..

76
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,127
..we will teach them a lesson.

77
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,632
We will beat them black and blue!

78
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,258
Like this.

79
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,163
There are two soldiers in my ape army.

80
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,040
On my signal they will attack.

81
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,978
Attack.
- Attack.

82
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:46,007
Attack. - Oh! Shut up!
What's your problem, chimp?

83
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,144
You are ever ready to fight.

84
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,781
Discussion. Every problem
can be solved with discussion.

85
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,116
You know that, dear?

86
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,558
You mean you will go to humans.

87
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,687
They will say good morning
and tell you to have a seat.

88
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:02,029
You will say, Uncle bulldozer,
don't snatch our home.

89
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,036
They will say sorry
and offer you coffee.

90
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,471
Their bulldozer will take a u-turn
and they will leave the jungle?

91
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,471
O ignorant fellow,
they are humans. Humans.

92
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,308
They don't even pity their people.

93
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,445
They will shoot you dead.

94
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,005
Completely.

95
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,517
Hey! Listen, chimp!

96
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,554
All of them must not be like you.
A few must be like me.

97
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:28,822
We can talk, chitchat, discuss.

98
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,360
Fine. I agree. I agree
that they will listen to you.

99
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,160
But who will talk?

100
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,463
Is there anyone among us
who knows human language?

101
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,196
Is there anyone?
- Yes, there is.

102
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,328
Who?
- Who?

103
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,600
Who is it?
- Who is it?

104
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,643
Secondly.. - Fool, first
say what's the first thing?

105
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,042
First? Yes. That's what I was saying.

106
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,213
I know someone who can help us.

107
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,512
Because he knows not just our
language, but also human language.

108
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,653
And his name...
his name...his name is..

109
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,657
His name is... his name..

110
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,987
What is it?
Just now it was on my mind.

111
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,721
Name! Name! Name! Name!

112
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,786
Rajni. Ghajini. Kalpana. No.

113
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,190
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.

114
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,358
Shut up!

115
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,328
This is not your film shooting.
It's life. Life.

116
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,273
They will heed only action.
Not words. No. - Enough.

117
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,807
It's enough, Bajrangi.

118
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,804
Now we need neither words nor action.

119
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,344
The decision has been made.

120
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,813
We will leave this jungle in two days.

121
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,105
'Parinda' (Hindi movie).

122
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,606
Uncle Hawa-hawai.

123
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,439
Who knows human language?

124
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,176
You? Who are you?

125
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,649
I am Yuvi, uncle.
- Yuvi?

126
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,209
Your friend.
- Friend?

127
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,251
Ditto. Same to same.

128
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,664
Secondly, you also pack your
bags and leave this place.

129
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,200
But where will you go?

130
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,235
I will go. I will go. I..

131
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,438
Where will I go? My home..
- Is here, right?

132
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,806
His name is Alex. He is film
director Vikram Khosla's parrot.

133
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,040
His wings are weak. He can't fly.

134
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:37,021
But what a parrot! Hindi.
English. Punjabi. Gujarati. Marwari.

135
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,784
He knows all languages.

136
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,787
But why are you asking me all this?

137
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,025
I have a plan.

138
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,596
Anger means sin, ego.
And this will be your end.

139
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,431
I am telling you. If you
want to be a big leader..

140
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,529
..you have to
swallow your small anger.

141
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,732
Like a milkshake.

142
00:12:55,241 --> 00:13:02,010
So my darling monkey,
whenever you lose temper..

143
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,412
..stop right there.

144
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,744
Take a deep breath.

145
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,612
Now exhale.
- Not so deep.

146
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,726
And remember my mantra.

147
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,127
One. Two. One. Two. Three.

148
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,687
Stick out your right arm.

149
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,699
And then your left next.

150
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,394
Twirl around tummy.

151
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,027
And move your butt like this.

152
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,562
We do the hugging and
hug the little monkey.

153
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,802
And start from the clock again.

154
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,240
We do.. - Magical hug.
I have seen this scene before.

155
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,573
Secondly..

156
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,708
First shall we talk about
the first thing, uncle? - Yes.

157
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,046
That's what I was saying.

158
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,481
I don't know about films.

159
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,524
But here, everything
depends on your acting.

160
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,183
Is that so?
- Yes.

161
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,353
Okay, uncle. Ready?
- Yes. Ready.

162
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,158
Action!

163
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,723
Not possible.
- It's possible.

164
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,100
It's out of the question.
- It's not.

165
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,969
These are just words. Merely words.

166
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,601
You don't know my uncle Bajrangi.

167
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,211
Uncle Bajrangi.

168
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,245
What's the matter? Any problem?

169
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,147
Look, uncle Bajrangi.

170
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,778
I am telling him
that there is nobody..

171
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,317
..as strong as you
in the entire jungle.

172
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,583
You are right.
- But he doesn't believe me.

173
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,717
Is that so?
So I will make him believe it.

174
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,989
Why?
- No. No. No.

175
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,499
I have waged a bet with
him that uncle Bajrangi..

176
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,557
..can defeat two in arm wrestling.

177
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,503
But he says...but he says..

178
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,365
Not possible.

179
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,569
Is that so? So this is the matter.

180
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:43,009
Does anyone in the jungle have
the courage to come forward?

181
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,116
I am not talking to you.

182
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,579
Barela! Marela! Come here!

183
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:51,816
What happened?

184
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,064
I know your mother's lover.

185
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,698
Something is fishy, boss.

186
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,067
I don't think his
intentions are good, boss.

187
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:10,666
I even told him that uncle
Bajrangi can shake any tree..

188
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,507
..and drop all the
fruits down in a jiffy.

189
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,476
But he says..

190
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,273
Impossible.

191
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,708
So see this.

192
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,345
They are flattering you.
- Coconut tree.

193
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,480
If you fall,
you will break your bones.

194
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,751
You should at least get coconuts.

195
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,789
I am dead!

196
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,453
So many of them.

197
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,063
What else did you say, pigeon?

198
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,534
Not pigeon, uncle. Alex.

199
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,332
Alex?
- Yes.

200
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,498
I even told him that
only you can release..

201
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,406
..Alex from Vikram
Khosla's captivity..

202
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,309
But he said..
- lmpossible.

203
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,780
Enough. Where? Where is Alex?

204
00:15:55,688 --> 00:16:00,591
I am your parrot.
You are my birdie.

205
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,561
I am your parrot.
You are my birdie.

206
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,428
Why don't you listen to me?

207
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,366
Your youth is tantalizing.

208
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,202
I don't know what
spell you have cast.

209
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,071
My heart is smitten.

210
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,770
It murmurs sweet nothings.

211
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,572
My heart is smitten.

212
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,617
It murmurs sweet nothings.

213
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,458
Hurry up.

214
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,306
Come. Come. Come.

215
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,745
Yuvi, hurry.

216
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,510
Your youth is tantalizing.

217
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,209
I don't know what
spell you have cast.

218
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,347
Welcome to Khosla's home, baby.

219
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,722
Wow! Nice house, Mr. Khosla.

220
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,218
She is hot.

221
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,073
Alex! What a cute little parrot!
- Come, baby.

222
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,337
Let's go to the poolside.

223
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,209
Why poolside? - That's where
your opening scene will be shot.

224
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:10,213
The opening scene will be in a bikini?
But I want to do acting also.

225
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,084
Cool down.
We need bikini to sell the movie.

226
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,061
My character will be exposed?

227
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,428
Full exposure. Full exposure.

228
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,059
A long role and short dresses.

229
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,433
I will make you a top heroine.

230
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,631
You are serious,
aren't you, Mr. Khosla?

231
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,606
Very serious.

232
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,233
Silence!

233
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,976
Mummy, please. Listen to me..
- Quiet.

234
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,645
Bagga, he is small. But you..

235
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,546
He is small.
That's why I went along with him.

236
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,450
Aunt, come on.
He needed someone responsible.

237
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,249
You think going to a human's house..

238
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,551
..and putting everyone's life
in danger is a responsible thing?

239
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,357
And you, Bajrangi.

240
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,758
You were against talking to humans.

241
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,122
So why did you do this?

242
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:30,566
You see...you see, Yuvraj..
- Flattered you.

243
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,228
And you got flattered.
- And you fell down.

244
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,566
Flat on your face.
- Bad. Bad.

245
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,697
Very bad.

246
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,031
Ma'am, you were saying something,
weren't you?

247
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,633
Ma'am, speak.
- Ultimately.

248
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,172
Not even once did you think
how dangerous that place is.

249
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,738
What if something
had happened to my son?

250
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,611
How is that possible?
I swear on Lord Bajrangbali.

251
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,087
As long as I am there,
no one can even touch your cub.

252
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,386
That's what Sultan also used
to think. But what happened?

253
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:58,529
In front of my eyes humans
snatched him from me.

254
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,563
Neither he nor I could do anything.

255
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,993
I am sorry, mummy.

256
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,063
I shouldn't have gone
there without your permission.

257
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:13,475
But I didn't want somebody else
to suffer the same fate as papa.

258
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,311
In fact, during the meeting
papa himself came and told me..

259
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,077
Your papa is dead, Yuvi.

260
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,286
And those who are dead,
they never come back, son.

261
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,594
It's the story of every family.
It's every family's story.

262
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,766
I mean, enough of this family drama.

263
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,461
Cut this family drama
and drop me back home.

264
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,594
For God's sake.

265
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,197
Drop me back right now.

266
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:47,211
Look at this.
If he doesn't harp on the same thing..

267
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,407
..who will call him a parrot?

268
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,178
Shut up, you ape.
I don't talk to LS ones like you.

269
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,777
You..
- Chimp.

270
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,846
Secondly, why do you want to leave
the fresh air of the jungle..

271
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,060
..and freedom and go
back to that prison?

272
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:06,359
Freedom my foot! You call this
thing freedom? Think again, dude.

273
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,728
It's so hot here.

274
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,563
Khosla has AC, TV, DVD, internet.

275
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,297
Whiskey and cashew nut.

276
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,134
And most importantly, this
irritating nut is not there.

277
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,176
What did you say?
- Chimp.

278
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,771
Listen, you are also one of us.
You are also a wild bird.

279
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,142
Won't you support us
in this fight, darling?

280
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,448
Chill, dude. This jungle
is your home. Not mine.

281
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,613
I checked out of this
place a long time ago, man.

282
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,180
Why are you giving this
parrot so much importance?

283
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,522
I suggest we still have an option.

284
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,495
My monkey army is fully prepared.

285
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:43,159
I suggest...I suggest attack..
- You say it.

286
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,462
You say it.
- You say it.

287
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,265
You say it.
- Who is fat?

288
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,499
Me.
- Fine. I will say it.

289
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,665
Attack.

290
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,266
Bajrangi, that's impressive,
man. What an army!

291
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,835
They will fight with humans?
They will fight with humans?

292
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,672
You have lost your mind!
- Get lost.

293
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,479
Don't hide behind her.

294
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,981
Don't you dare! You pauper!
You...you backward monkey!

295
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,546
Come out. Come in front.

296
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,558
Come in front.

297
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,459
Did you know kidnapping is
a crime under section 364A?

298
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,095
What nonsense are you talking!

299
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,498
We are very, very sorry,
Alex. But you are our only hope.

300
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,761
You will have to help us.

301
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,564
You will have to take
our voice to the humans.

302
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,006
Have you lost your mind?
Take it to the humans?

303
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,103
Today you will say
talk to the builder.

304
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,772
Tomorrow minister.
Then chief minister.

305
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,312
If things still don't
work out, you will say..

306
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,351
..Alex, come with us to Delhi.

307
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,510
Delhi?

308
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,255
What is Delhi?

309
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,382
Unbelievable! You don't know Delhi?

310
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,184
It's the capital of
our country, bonehead.

311
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,252
NDTV. CNN. IBN. BBC.

312
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,060
Fights. Shoes. Mike.
Trust vote. Bundles of notes.

313
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,430
Parliament.
- Parliament.

314
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,026
Oh, no. It's parliament.

315
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,698
People who sit there,
they run our country.

316
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,638
You know ministers and all.
- Ministers?

317
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,769
Damn! Ministers
control the government.

318
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,172
They listen to complaints.

319
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,147
You mean, they will
listen to our complaint?

320
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,342
Yes. They will surely listen.

321
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,413
No. No. No.

322
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,283
Now don't say that
I should come to Delhi with you.

323
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,049
I am not going anywhere. Got it?

324
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,751
I mean, even if the earth rips
apart or the sky falls down.

325
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,687
Alex!

326
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,222
Run!

327
00:23:56,735 --> 00:24:00,728
'lf papa had been alive, and
one of us had been shot..'

328
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,208
'..would he have left this place?'

329
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,174
It's here that papa taught
us to live together, right?

330
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,383
His memories dwell
in this jungle, mummy.

331
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,613
We will have to convince Alex.

332
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,551
We will go to Delhi.

333
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,185
Delhi? What Delhi?

334
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,628
D for going to Delhi.
P for meeting people.

335
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,029
B for begging.

336
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,157
B for bad, bad, bad.

337
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,462
S for shame, shame, shame.

338
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:35,402
That's why, that's why I am the boss..

339
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,271
..and both of you are my henchmen.

340
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:41,244
We will go to Delhi.
But we won't reach there.

341
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:47,342
On the way, as soon as I get a chance,
I will get rid of Alex.

342
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,117
If the parrot is not there,..

343
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:54,056
..there won't be any
discussion with humans.

344
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,819
And there will be only action.

345
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,725
Because this land
always belonged to monkeys.

346
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,332
And it will belong only to monkeys.

347
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:07,360
And we will rule over it.

348
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,374
Glory to Lord Hanuman.

349
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,042
Oh, God.

350
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,999
Come. Come along with us.

351
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,470
Get lost. Give me breathing space.

352
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,475
Give up. Give up your obstinacy.

353
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,204
Give me way.

354
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,145
Come. Come along with us.

355
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,613
Get lost. Give me breathing space.

356
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,515
Give up. Give up your obstinacy.

357
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,246
Give me way.

358
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,257
Neither earth nor sky.
We are going on a mission.

359
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:04,318
We have vowed today.

360
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,263
Our promises are true.

361
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,493
Our resolutions are strong.

362
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:16,337
Come on. Let's go there.

363
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,608
We take a step in front.

364
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,477
You take a step and follow us.

365
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:27,678
Let's go to Delhi. Delhi safari.

366
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,777
We take a step in front.

367
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,319
You take a step and follow us.

368
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:38,420
Let's go to Delhi. Delhi safari.

369
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:04,585
Our breaths are smoldering.

370
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,356
Our eyes are fiery.

371
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,493
Our feet have the zeal to walk.

372
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,207
And there is zest in our heart.

373
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:27,711
Whatever difficulties we might face.

374
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:32,380
We won't back off.

375
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,217
We have to live together.

376
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:40,257
We won't be divided.

377
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:44,091
Help. Help. Go away.

378
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,289
Don't bore me.

379
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:50,095
Don't eat my brains.

380
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:53,236
Use all your power.

381
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,499
Confront us.

382
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:59,669
We won't lose.

383
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,178
Ever.

384
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,613
Ever.

385
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,015
Ever.

386
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,985
Attack!

387
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,215
We take a step in front.

388
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,087
You take a step and follow us.

389
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:18,218
Let's go to Delhi. Delhi safari.

390
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,457
We take a step in front.

391
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,727
You take a step and follow us.

392
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:28,164
Let's go to Delhi. Delhi safari.

393
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,173
Delhi safari.

394
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,002
Delhi safari.

395
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,305
Delhi safari.

396
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,513
Delhi safari.

397
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,738
Delhi safari.

398
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,212
Delhi safari.

399
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,311
Delhi safari.

400
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,054
Delhi safari.

401
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,832
A cheetah!

402
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,167
Cheetah! Where is the cheetah?

403
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,835
There. In the compartment.
- Come on. Come on.

404
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,807
Run! Run! Run!

405
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,072
Oh, darn, we are going to die.

406
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,616
What's the problem, Alexander?

407
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,549
They have found out there
is an animal in the train.

408
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,179
How did they find out?
We are hiding inside.

409
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,189
It all happened
because of this monkey.

410
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,657
Bajrangi, did you go out?
- No.

411
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,785
Big job.
- No. - Small job. - No.

412
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,791
'Vada Pav' (lndian burger)? Banana?

413
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,122
Don't you..

414
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,633
Don't you have any sense?

415
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:15,366
I swear on Alex.
I was guarding this place.

416
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,599
They are coming here.
Somebody is at the door.

417
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,171
Check in which
compartment the cheetah is.

418
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,115
Check that compartment.
- Check.

419
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,153
Mummy.
- Yuvi.

420
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,121
Mummy.

421
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,283
Where have they gone?.
- Open and see.

422
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,762
Check. Check.
- Come here.

423
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,789
Look here.

424
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,193
What are you doing?

425
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,099
Open it.
- Open it and see.

426
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,195
Is the cheetah here?
Is the cheetah here?

427
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,633
It must have escaped from there.

428
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,543
It must have fled.
- Let's look ahead. Come on.

429
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,254
All this happened because of you.

430
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,722
How did you reach here?

431
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,281
I was not coming, mama.

432
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,385
But as soon as I closed my eyes,
papa came in front of me.

433
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,396
Yuvi, you again dreamt of your daddy?

434
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:17,594
I am speaking the truth, uncle Bagga.
Papa came to me. And..

435
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,533
Mummy, I am not lying. He came to me.

436
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,370
The trial of life.

437
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,104
We are together.

438
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,510
Everybody embrace each
other and say sorry.

439
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,638
End credits roll.

440
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,012
But I object, My Lord.

441
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,052
My Lord, I want to show
you a short flashback.

442
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,452
When this innocent and
sweet parrot was tortured.

443
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,423
My lord, exactly at 3:.37,
before the train stopped..

444
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,619
..and after the brakes were jammed.

445
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,163
This monkey was standing before me..

446
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,720
..with a big knife.

447
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,824
Can he tell me what he was up to?

448
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,192
I need an explanation.

449
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,499
Baj, is that true?

450
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,562
The rascal's falsely accusing me.

451
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,302
Why is he always after me?

452
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,436
Objection, my lord. He is lying.

453
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,174
King Kong,
why be scared if you've done it?

454
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,306
Why don't you say it clearly..

455
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,509
..that you were trying to kill me.

456
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:10,543
I don't need to try to kill you.

457
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:14,421
I can blow your brains out right now!

458
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,983
Enough! If you two keep fighting..

459
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,722
..then we will never
succeed in this mission.

460
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,230
Bajrangi, not a word from you.

461
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,631
And you also listen
to me carefully, Alex.

462
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,226
We cannot make it to
Delhi without you.

463
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,137
And you cannot get
to Mumbai without us.

464
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,037
So, it's better that
we help each other out.

465
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,371
Fine, fine. I will go along.

466
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,744
But ask this monkey to
leave behind his weapons.

467
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,579
As long as he doesn't do
that I won't budge. - No.

468
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,380
These weapons are my pride and glory.

469
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,820
Oh yes, but you're brave,
you're strong..

470
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,547
..you don't need these damn weapons.

471
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:54,360
Come on, throw it down.
- No! No! No! No! No!

472
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,825
There you go.

473
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,735
I'll just go relieve myself.

474
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,966
You're already relieved, Bajrangi.

475
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,302
Look at him.

476
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,439
He looks so weak.

477
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,032
Quiet! Speak.

478
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,635
Thankfully I secretly hid two weapons.

479
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,298
Boss.

480
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,274
Plan no.2 has completely failed.

481
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,506
You were asking about following him.

482
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,039
You should've signaled us
while getting down the train, fool.

483
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,345
Fool?

484
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,453
No, I am the fool.

485
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,018
Boss, we also heard that..

486
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,355
..they took away all your weapons.

487
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,757
It must have been painful.

488
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,690
And that's why.

489
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,490
That's why I am your boss..

490
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,000
..and you are my henchmen.

491
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,763
So what if they took my weapons.

492
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,766
You two have your weapons.

493
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,301
We left ours back home.
- No.

494
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,408
No. I've brought mine.

495
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,071
So wait for my signal.

496
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:21,116
And as I give the signal..
- Attack!

497
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,783
Slowly.

498
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,280
How will we go to Delhi now?

499
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,153
Only the train knew the way.

500
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,388
That's why you're there and I am here.

501
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,221
Where was the train heading?
- Delhi?

502
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,787
So where will the tracks go?
- Delhi.

503
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,796
Where are we headed?
- Delhi!

504
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,332
Common sense.

505
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,194
Follow me.

506
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,242
What's this?

507
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,217
Common sense.

508
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,481
Common sense.

509
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,647
Nonsense!

510
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,190
Monkey brain wanted
to follow the train.

511
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,123
Take my advice and take a u-turn.

512
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,423
At least we'll be back
to where we started.

513
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:05,721
What now, uncle?

514
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,557
When all paths lead to dead end..

515
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,624
..then the solution
comes from up there.

516
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,963
Batman uncle.

517
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,300
Not Batman, but take my advice.

518
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,432
Raju's my name and
showing the path's my game.

519
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,408
You want to know the way to Delhi,
don't you?

520
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,535
How do you know?

521
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,205
Not just Raju Guide,
but every animal in this country..

522
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,647
..knows about your mission.

523
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,479
It's the age of internet.

524
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,115
Here's Delhi.

525
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,679
Delhi! Delhi!

526
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,389
Do you have another map
to understand this map?

527
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:40,726
I can fill haters with love.

528
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:44,325
And sing a song that
will get to Delhi soon.

529
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:53,735
Come friends.

530
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,712
Come, let me show
you the way to Delhi.

531
00:36:56,781 --> 00:37:00,683
Come friends. Come, let me show you
the way to Delhi.

532
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,719
Head straight.

533
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,751
Don't be scared, have courage.

534
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,957
There'll be a patch
of lush greenery.

535
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,958
The forest will be dense.

536
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,962
No, no, no, no.

537
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,761
No, no, no, no.

538
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:20,767
Humans raided that dense jungle.

539
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,964
All they left
behind was a dead tree.

540
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,010
Go straight from there.

541
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,978
Don't repent on what happened there.

542
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,775
Where the current's strong.

543
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,006
You will come across a river there.

544
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,984
No, no, no, no.

545
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:40,649
No, no, no, no.

546
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,023
The river that used to flow.

547
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,994
Has now turned into a drain.

548
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:49,021
Don't ask what the
humans have done to it.

549
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,068
Just travel a little further ahead.

550
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,103
Be weary of humans.

551
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,001
A place that's lonely and quiet.

552
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,063
You will come across the desert.

553
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:01,043
No, no, no, no.

554
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,980
No, no, no, no.

555
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,074
The group of gypsies are lost.

556
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,085
The fun's gone.

557
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,087
Those beautiful sand dunes..

558
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,055
..have turned into highways.

559
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,092
Everyone's prayers
have been answered.

560
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,093
You can see
the Parliament from there.

561
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,095
Don't stay quiet in the Parliament.

562
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,097
Tell the humans.

563
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,999
Listen cruel humans.

564
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,162
Listen cruel humans.

565
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,172
Listen to what it's trying to say.

566
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,140
Nature's trying to say..

567
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,176
..we co-exist because of each other.

568
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:37,146
If you annihilate us.

569
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:41,014
You will be eradicated as well.

570
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,224
Guys. Guys, please.

571
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,730
I cannot travel any longer.

572
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,393
You want me to order
an aeroplane for you.

573
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,197
Keep walking otherwise.
- Otherwise what?

574
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,170
You will kill me,
right. Please kill me.

575
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,535
Kill me. Kill me.

576
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,074
Has this parrot lost his mind?

577
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,234
Yes, I've gone mad.

578
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,538
I've gone mad. I've lost my mind.

579
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,570
Look. Look. I am not strangling him.

580
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:15,585
He's making me strangle him.

581
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,178
Bajrangi. Alex. Calm down you two.

582
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,654
Kutch is not too far now.

583
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,566
My clarinet says

584
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,160
My drum says

585
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,332
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

586
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,104
To my home.

587
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,413
Here come the guests.

588
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,647
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

589
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,989
To my home.

590
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:13,067
Who's the mightiest of all...

591
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,669
...soon everyone will see.

592
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,173
I am above all.

593
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,151
The world will be mine.

594
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:28,351
Anyone locks horns with me,
will be reduced to ashes.

595
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:34,331
I will blow away my competition.

596
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,423
Come, O traveler.

597
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,630
Welcome to my home.

598
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,569
Come, O traveler.

599
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,165
Welcome to my home.

600
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,766
Welcome.

601
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,835
Come, O traveler.

602
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,845
Welcome to my home.

603
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,142
Come, O traveler.

604
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,848
Welcome to my home.

605
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:05,153
No problem's ever
been too big for me.

606
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:10,997
You've no idea of what I can do.

607
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:17,467
The world bows at my feet.

608
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:23,446
Even winds change
path at my command.

609
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,675
Come, O traveler.

610
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,377
Welcome to my home.

611
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,783
Welcome.

612
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,817
Come, O traveler.

613
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,320
Welcome to my home.

614
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,517
Welcome.

615
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,756
Come and face me bravely
if you can. - Come on.

616
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,265
Don't turn your back and run.
- Come on.

617
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:51,172
I will show your place.
- Come on.

618
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,075
Don't be scared of me.
- Don't go.

619
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,339
Careful.

620
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,740
Escape while you can.

621
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:06,646
Front, back, up, down, right,
left, escape from where you can.

622
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:11,718
Come, O traveler.

623
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,423
Welcome to my home.

624
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,795
Welcome.

625
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,001
Come, O traveler.

626
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,536
Welcome to my home.

627
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:21,798
Welcome.

628
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,200
Come, O traveler.

629
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,436
Welcome to my home.

630
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,171
Welcome.

631
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,270
Come, O traveler.

632
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,713
Welcome to my home.

633
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,546
Welcome.

634
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,578
These two are finished.

635
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,420
Yes, but that's okay.

636
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,426
The dance is finished as well.

637
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,725
Yes, yes, but our journey
to Delhi is not finished.

638
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,822
And what about these two?

639
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,197
Don't worry.

640
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:54,203
Give them a whiff of
onions and they'll be fine.

641
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:57,035
Kalpesh, this isn't a serious problem.

642
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:01,439
They just felt dizzy while dancing.

643
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,604
Yes, dear.

644
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,979
But I feel..
- I feel they just need rest..

645
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,142
..and they will be fine.

646
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,775
Just tell us the way ahead.

647
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,214
It's too late now.

648
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,983
Spend the night here.

649
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,150
In the morning we
will tell you the way..

650
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:19,025
..and spread this news to the
rest of the birds and animals.

651
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:23,524
But remember one thing.

652
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,264
The area beyond that
black banyan tree..

653
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,431
..belongs to Kaaliya.

654
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,076
Don't even wander that way.

655
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:43,176
'The area beyond that
black banyan tree..'

656
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,480
'..belongs to Kaaliya.'

657
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,325
Thank God, papa, you're here.

658
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,661
Speak slowly, son. Everyone's tired.

659
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,969
But I want to wake them up.

660
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,032
I want to tell them that you're there.

661
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,975
Nobody believes me, papa.

662
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,307
I will call them right now.

663
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,314
Yuvi. Son, there's no point.

664
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,509
They won't be able to see me.

665
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,043
But, papa..

666
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,149
But why is that, papa?

667
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:22,624
Why can't they see you?

668
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,457
Because they think I am far away.

669
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:28,521
Only you know how close I am to you.

670
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,724
But why can't mother see you?

671
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,268
Of course she will.

672
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,769
But when the time comes. Okay.

673
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,363
I am just here to tell you..

674
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,309
..that you've to stay alert
for the mission you are on.

675
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,106
Because problems don't
always come from outside.

676
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,008
Sometimes our own kin create problems.

677
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:55,389
Now Kaaliya will kill you
and no one will doubt me.

678
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,358
Papa.

679
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,662
Bajrangi, uncle.

680
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,102
What are you doing here?

681
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,732
What are you doing here?

682
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,402
Where am l?
- Bajrangi, uncle.

683
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,740
What's going on?

684
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,075
Why is Alex..

685
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,979
This is Kaaliya's area.

686
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,076
Oh my, God. We'll have to
get out of here quickly.

687
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,984
Come on, Bajrangi uncle. Quickly.

688
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:29,219
You're a little late.

689
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:33,587
It's useless now.

690
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,133
Who are you?

691
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,804
I am the uncrowned king of this area.

692
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,208
Kaaliya! Kaaliya!

693
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,517
Kaaliya! Kaaliya! Kaaliya!

694
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,392
Bhairav!
- Yes, boss.

695
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:08,260
What's on menu today?

696
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:11,499
Boss. Parrot kebabs.

697
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:14,628
Lion-curry.
- Is it?

698
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,333
And roasted Monkey.

699
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,568
My mouth's watering.

700
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,737
My mouth's watering.

701
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,449
Look, Kaaliya. Don't think I am alone.

702
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,511
On my signal..

703
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,022
On my signal..

704
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,549
Brother, don't speak.

705
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,720
I don't see the rascals..

706
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,659
Tandoor nights.

707
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,100
Tandoor nights.

708
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,638
Tandoor nights.
- Kaaliya uncle..

709
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,332
..we mistakenly
wandered in these parts.

710
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,204
Please let us go.

711
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,307
Fine. Fine.

712
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,305
You can leave if you want.

713
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:59,713
But first you've to fight us.

714
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,307
Defeat us.

715
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,545
And then you can leave.

716
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,318
Very simple.

717
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,747
But how will you fight us.

718
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,982
I've fangs.

719
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,255
I've claws.

720
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,626
I've courage.

721
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,959
I've an army.

722
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,330
What do you have?

723
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,159
What do you have?

724
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,067
What do you have?

725
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:22,605
I have my mother.

726
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,132
Mother!

727
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,108
Mother! Mother!

728
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,424
Save me.

729
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,432
I am going to die.
I am going to die.

730
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,385
Please, please.

731
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,678
It was a mistake..

732
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,520
It was a mistake..

733
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,985
I will teach you a lesson..

734
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:06,091
Kaaliya. Why are you running now?

735
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:09,468
Rascal. Wanted to turn
me into a roasted monkey.

736
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,511
Thank God you're safe.

737
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,080
If anything had happened to you..

738
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:25,815
..then I could've
never faced the Sultan.

739
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,451
Forgive me.

740
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,248
And your highness..
- Bagga.

741
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,159
Ask him to leave right now.

742
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:35,392
I don't need his apology or him.

743
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,499
The savior is greater than destroyer.

744
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,294
But you will never understand this.

745
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,164
Alex is much better than you.

746
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,603
He's going to Delhi as our voice.

747
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,108
As long as he's with us..

748
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,713
..our voice will
certainly reach Delhi.

749
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:54,107
Our voice will never
reach Delhi, mother.

750
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,118
Alex has lost his voice.

751
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:01,389
And I think he can never speak again.

752
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,195
What have you done, Bajrangi uncle?

753
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,706
What have you done?

754
00:51:57,613 --> 00:52:00,207
It's a serious matter.

755
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:01,977
It's serious.

756
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:04,884
Alex has become completely dumb.

757
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:08,754
No, no, he's just lost his voice.

758
00:52:08,824 --> 00:52:10,655
One and the same thing, Kalpesh.

759
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:15,391
By the way, this often
happens in our stage-shows.

760
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:20,159
Remember, Rasik in our
stage show in Chicago.

761
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:22,327
Dear, you're just..

762
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:25,131
That was Glasgow and not Chicago.

763
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:28,643
Whatever, but he did lose his voice,
didn't he, flamingo?

764
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:31,236
Yes, but it did come back as well.

765
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:33,873
Do you want to argue
or find a solution?

766
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:35,348
Solution. They want it.

767
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:37,074
Do you have a cure for it?

768
00:52:37,152 --> 00:52:39,814
Tell them. Tell them the cure.

769
00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:42,113
Yes. Here's what you do.

770
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:45,092
Give Alex guava, ginger and basil..

771
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,654
Don't give them the solution..

772
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:53,293
..give them the whereabouts to
the 'Jari-buti Baba' (physician).

773
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:54,893
'Jari-buti Baba'.

774
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,765
On the path leading to Marwar..

775
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:58,864
..there's a huge river.

776
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:01,933
And his cave is on
the shores of this river.

777
00:53:09,084 --> 00:53:10,881
It's so peaceful here.

778
00:53:11,286 --> 00:53:14,983
I feel the peace here will
be broken by Alex's voice.

779
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:18,151
Just watch. As soon as
we meet the physician..

780
00:53:18,227 --> 00:53:20,787
..Alex will start blabbering again.

781
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:21,955
Guru.

782
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:23,123
Sir.

783
00:53:23,198 --> 00:53:24,961
Baba darling.

784
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,667
Baba.

785
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:32,568
Is that the Baba?

786
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:34,006
Oops. No parking.

787
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:36,772
I will take a look.
- No, no, no.

788
00:53:36,845 --> 00:53:39,712
He'll die sooner if you do that.

789
00:53:39,882 --> 00:53:41,008
I will take a look.

790
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:43,608
Guru. Guru.

791
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:45,547
There's no bell here.

792
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:48,351
I think I'll have to enter directly.

793
00:53:48,824 --> 00:53:52,055
Hail Lord Hanuman.

794
00:53:52,127 --> 00:53:53,355
Who is it?

795
00:53:54,196 --> 00:53:57,097
Who is calling me
from his inner voice?

796
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,191
Baba darling is here
that mean that's..

797
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,566
Baj. Do you need a torch?

798
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:14,678
I swear. Even Mumbai
isn't that polluted.

799
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:16,846
Baba, this is Alex.

800
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:18,853
He lost his voice last night.

801
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:21,089
Alex, open your mouth.

802
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:27,988
He...he..
- Will die?

803
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:31,525
He...he..
- Cream candy?

804
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:33,793
He's got no ordinary disease.

805
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:36,100
It's a royal sickness.

806
00:54:36,171 --> 00:54:37,832
But what's wrong with him.

807
00:54:37,906 --> 00:54:39,203
T...T..
- Tumor.

808
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:40,707
TB.
- T...T..

809
00:54:40,776 --> 00:54:43,108
Tension. Hyper tension.

810
00:54:43,178 --> 00:54:46,545
Stress.

811
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:48,082
High BP.

812
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,244
His cure M... M..
- Machine gun.

813
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,685
Cream candy..

814
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:54,152
Is going to be hard work.

815
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:58,592
First we need to C...C..
- Cut throat.

816
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,786
Slap him.

817
00:54:59,928 --> 00:55:02,328
Apply sandal and
jasmine paste on his neck.

818
00:55:03,198 --> 00:55:07,931
Get fresh yellow rose
jam and mix it with mud.

819
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,937
And then feed him that jam everyday..

820
00:55:11,006 --> 00:55:13,804
..with fresh, red, guavas.

821
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:17,835
But who...who...will do this job.

822
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:26,910
Leave that to me.

823
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:32,023
Where is it?

824
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:36,155
Medicine.

825
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:37,628
Medicine.

826
00:55:39,868 --> 00:55:41,563
Let me rub these two together.

827
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:45,832
Medicine.

828
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:50,711
Medicine.

829
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:57,108
Looking hot, chimpo.

830
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:13,060
Quiet.

831
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,038
Stubborn parrot.

832
00:56:18,774 --> 00:56:20,105
So many thorns.

833
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:21,972
What did he say?

834
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,740
Yes.

835
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:32,084
This one.

836
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:34,915
Yellow.

837
00:56:42,598 --> 00:56:45,032
Red. Red. Red.

838
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,159
Yellow. Red.

839
00:56:47,903 --> 00:56:48,995
Red.

840
00:57:02,918 --> 00:57:04,112
Here you go.

841
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:07,618
Is that fine?

842
00:57:08,123 --> 00:57:09,215
No.

843
00:57:15,163 --> 00:57:16,357
Let's see.

844
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:19,925
Here you go.

845
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:21,599
Is that fine?

846
00:57:23,872 --> 00:57:25,203
No.

847
00:57:31,246 --> 00:57:34,010
No way. I won't go that far.

848
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:35,549
That's not possible.

849
00:57:40,822 --> 00:57:42,050
What are you doing?

850
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:04,542
Got it.

851
00:58:04,846 --> 00:58:05,938
Here you go.

852
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,351
No.

853
00:58:18,093 --> 00:58:19,560
No.

854
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:36,201
No. Hail Lord Hanuman.

855
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:38,303
Pump up the jam.

856
00:58:38,547 --> 00:58:40,208
Pump up the jam.

857
00:58:40,282 --> 00:58:42,273
Pump up the jam.

858
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:45,509
Who was laughing?
- Who was laughing?

859
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:47,852
Get something to eat.

860
00:58:47,923 --> 00:58:50,153
You'll get sick trying to cure him.

861
00:58:50,225 --> 00:58:53,217
I won't drink a drop of water.

862
00:58:53,996 --> 00:58:56,760
I swear in everyone's presence..

863
00:58:57,232 --> 00:59:00,690
..until Alex doesn't
regain his voice..

864
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:05,997
..I will look after him.

865
00:59:06,074 --> 00:59:08,235
He can't be our boss.

866
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:13,680
We can get beheaded
but never bow down!

867
00:59:13,749 --> 00:59:16,115
Yes, that was our boss.

868
00:59:16,184 --> 00:59:19,312
But today seeing
your head bowed down..

869
00:59:19,554 --> 00:59:20,782
..it seems like..

870
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:24,223
Seems like..

871
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:26,886
We should take a headache pill, right.

872
00:59:27,262 --> 00:59:32,632
He can't be...our boss!
- And you can't be my henchmen either.

873
00:59:32,701 --> 00:59:36,660
I see. - Where were you
two when I kept signaling..

874
00:59:36,738 --> 00:59:40,196
..and Kaaliya was
smiling at me with his fangs?

875
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:43,675
Where were you two when
I was wandering around..

876
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:46,612
..for Alex's cure?

877
00:59:47,649 --> 00:59:50,516
Shame on you.

878
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:55,022
Eklavya cut his thumb for his Guru.

879
00:59:55,157 --> 00:59:59,787
And you two...
are pointing fingers at me.

880
01:00:00,629 --> 01:00:02,824
Shame on you two.

881
01:00:02,898 --> 01:00:04,729
I don't need you.

882
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,893
Get out of my sight.

883
01:00:06,968 --> 01:00:08,526
Get lost.

884
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:13,204
Did they really leave?

885
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:18,809
Who the hell is it? Coming. Coming.

886
01:00:27,989 --> 01:00:30,685
Bagga uncle,
Alex will get back his voice before..

887
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:32,920
..we reach Delhi, right?

888
01:00:32,994 --> 01:00:35,622
Don't know about that.
But if this continues..

889
01:00:35,697 --> 01:00:38,222
..Bajrangi will lose
his voice for good.

890
01:00:38,767 --> 01:00:43,704
He has been Alex's
bell boy since three days.

891
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,905
Have you seen the movie Bal Hanuman?

892
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:57,208
So many demons attack the poor
little Hanuman's back at once.

893
01:00:57,285 --> 01:01:01,619
But Lord Hanuman,
without losing his courage and might..

894
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:06,252
..kept forging on
chanting Lord Rama's name.

895
01:01:06,328 --> 01:01:13,325
The number of times he was faced
with troubles he uttered...

896
01:01:13,735 --> 01:01:15,168
Wow, what a chick!

897
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:17,262
Wow, what a chick!

898
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:20,769
What nonsense!

899
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:25,237
No. Before that.
No. No. After that.

900
01:01:26,081 --> 01:01:28,914
I won't spare you today.

901
01:01:28,984 --> 01:01:30,975
I won't spare you today.

902
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:32,212
What's happening, mama?

903
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,187
Is this called BP is rising?

904
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:35,587
I have no idea.

905
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,625
Can you make out whose
is high and whose is low?

906
01:01:37,926 --> 01:01:38,984
Bajrangi!

907
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:44,157
Not just your voice.
Today I'll fail your entire system.

908
01:01:44,232 --> 01:01:47,224
Stop, Bajrangi.
Bajrangi, listen to me.

909
01:01:47,302 --> 01:01:49,736
I won't spare you. Alex!

910
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,567
I went hungry for you.

911
01:01:59,981 --> 01:02:06,181
I kept serving without
having a drop of water.

912
01:02:06,254 --> 01:02:08,916
I became the bad guy
in the eyes of everyone.

913
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:12,721
And you. You betrayed me.

914
01:02:12,794 --> 01:02:16,958
What the hell!
Betrayal in the army of apes.

915
01:02:17,032 --> 01:02:18,829
What the hell.

916
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:23,865
What? Have you done dumb?

917
01:02:24,773 --> 01:02:26,172
Blurt something.

918
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:29,210
What did little Hanuman
say when faced with trouble?

919
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:31,268
Hail Lord Rama.

920
01:02:31,346 --> 01:02:35,146
Yes. So hail Lord Rama.

921
01:02:41,223 --> 01:02:42,588
What have you done?

922
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:47,658
Soldiers, attention.
- Yes sir.

923
01:02:49,764 --> 01:02:51,231
The enemy has woken us up.

924
01:02:51,299 --> 01:02:53,961
I repeat. The enemy has woken us up.

925
01:02:54,035 --> 01:02:57,163
Put him to sleep for good.

926
01:02:57,606 --> 01:03:00,666
Why aren't we running? Run.

927
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:03,136
Hail Lord Rama.

928
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:04,906
Ghosts and spirits stay away from you.

929
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,311
When you chant Lord's name.

930
01:03:06,381 --> 01:03:08,679
I say. Evil spirits stay away.

931
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,876
When you chant Lord's name.

932
01:03:09,951 --> 01:03:11,782
I am confused, Bagga uncle.

933
01:03:11,853 --> 01:03:13,980
Who is running after whom?

934
01:03:14,055 --> 01:03:16,148
Oh no. There is no confusion.

935
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:18,692
Someone is running after them.

936
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,125
So what should we do?

937
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:21,321
Let me think.

938
01:03:28,837 --> 01:03:30,930
Actually we must also run. You know.

939
01:03:32,907 --> 01:03:34,272
The enemy has back up.

940
01:03:34,342 --> 01:03:36,708
The enemy's second
unit is joining them.

941
01:03:37,078 --> 01:03:38,102
What's their position?

942
01:03:38,179 --> 01:03:40,909
20 degrees east. And 400 feet away.

943
01:03:40,982 --> 01:03:43,576
Roger. All units alert.
All units alert.

944
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:44,914
Attack the second unit.

945
01:03:49,624 --> 01:03:51,922
Artillery ready?
- Ready, sir.

946
01:03:51,993 --> 01:03:54,621
Aim
- Yes, sir. - Fire.

947
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:09,802
All hail Lord Hanuman.

948
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:11,712
Quick.

949
01:04:13,348 --> 01:04:14,576
Run. Run.

950
01:04:14,749 --> 01:04:17,274
Come. Come.
- Everyone, come here.

951
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:18,683
Fast.

952
01:04:51,252 --> 01:04:53,812
Run. Run. Run.

953
01:04:53,888 --> 01:04:55,583
Go. Go.
- Quick.

954
01:04:56,358 --> 01:04:58,326
Mummy, look here.
Everyone get into this.

955
01:04:58,693 --> 01:04:59,955
Yes. Come. Come.

956
01:05:00,028 --> 01:05:02,826
Here. There is safety here.
There is safety here.

957
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,197
You should be ashamed, Bajrangi.

958
01:05:10,271 --> 01:05:13,206
Not just Alex. You
have cheated all us again.

959
01:05:13,274 --> 01:05:15,037
I swear.
- Oh shut up, Bajrangi.

960
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,135
I don't trust you or your swearing.

961
01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:18,679
You don't understand me.

962
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:19,771
I am saying that..

963
01:05:19,848 --> 01:05:23,181
Don't say anything. Shut up.
- You shut up.

964
01:05:23,785 --> 01:05:30,748
See. He can talk. He can talk.

965
01:05:31,626 --> 01:05:33,594
You can talk, Alex.

966
01:05:33,661 --> 01:05:36,653
Yes. You also want
me to talk, isn't it?

967
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,790
I will shut up you.

968
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:42,831
Don't let the enemy
get out of here alive.

969
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:46,305
Yes sir. We won't let the
enemy get out of here alive.

970
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:47,599
Target in sight.

971
01:05:47,675 --> 01:05:50,075
All this is happening
because of this parrot.

972
01:05:50,145 --> 01:05:53,205
Me. Of course.
It's all because of me.

973
01:05:53,548 --> 01:05:56,847
I told you to touch the beehive.
I did.

974
01:05:56,918 --> 01:05:59,580
I told Mr. Bagga to use his back side.

975
01:05:59,654 --> 01:06:01,087
I said that let's go to Delhi.

976
01:06:05,126 --> 01:06:06,218
Oh no!

977
01:06:39,761 --> 01:06:41,524
Get down, Yuvi. Quick.

978
01:06:41,596 --> 01:06:43,860
Aunt, he can get down and hide.

979
01:06:43,932 --> 01:06:45,866
But what all do I hide?

980
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:47,231
Waiting. Waiting?

981
01:06:47,302 --> 01:06:49,099
Be my guest.

982
01:06:50,972 --> 01:06:52,098
Bajrangi.

983
01:06:55,243 --> 01:06:58,178
Mummy.
- Madam. My leg.

984
01:06:58,713 --> 01:06:59,839
Brother Bagga.

985
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:12,184
Bajrangi. Alex. Jump.

986
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,625
I am coming. I am...

987
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:16,823
Follow the main culprit. I repeat.
Follow the main culprit.

988
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:18,695
Bajrangi, my leg.

989
01:07:20,735 --> 01:07:23,795
Is it stuck? Great that is stuck.

990
01:07:23,872 --> 01:07:27,638
You cheated me. You cheat of a parrot.

991
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:29,540
Bajrangi, don't
leave me alone. Please.

992
01:07:29,611 --> 01:07:30,771
Do something yourself or die.

993
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:31,903
Bajrangi, please.

994
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:54,023
There is no time, Bajrangi. Go. Jump.

995
01:07:54,102 --> 01:07:55,330
Leave me and jump.

996
01:07:57,171 --> 01:07:59,196
Stop staring at me. And jump.

997
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:11,275
Darn, crossed the border!

998
01:08:11,352 --> 01:08:12,751
Should we follow them?

999
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,880
No. Unfortunately
that's not our territory.

1000
01:08:15,957 --> 01:08:18,755
Let's go back to base.
Tell the troops.

1001
01:08:18,826 --> 01:08:20,487
Roger. Back to the base.

1002
01:08:24,699 --> 01:08:25,757
They have gone.

1003
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:27,733
Thank God they didn't spot us.

1004
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:29,736
All that's fine, Mr. Bagga.

1005
01:08:30,004 --> 01:08:32,734
But where must Alex and Bajrangi be?

1006
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:35,901
I don't understand
why on earth they didn't jump.

1007
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:43,777
Why didn't you jump?

1008
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:45,648
Why didn't you jump, brother Bajrangi?

1009
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:49,552
The savior is greater
than the killer, isn't it?

1010
01:08:49,857 --> 01:08:51,586
This is what madam always said.

1011
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,187
She was right. She
was absolutely right.

1012
01:08:57,999 --> 01:08:59,864
I was being so stupid.

1013
01:09:00,735 --> 01:09:04,034
I was upset with you for
snatching me from a human's house.

1014
01:09:04,105 --> 01:09:07,233
But I forgot that humans have
snatched the homes of all of you.

1015
01:09:07,308 --> 01:09:10,835
But still, at every stage
I kept avoiding helping you.

1016
01:09:11,312 --> 01:09:12,870
I am sorry, Baj.

1017
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:16,944
Why are you saying sorry?

1018
01:09:17,018 --> 01:09:18,576
It is my fault.

1019
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:21,116
You came here to help me..

1020
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:26,183
..and l...started
thinking of getting you killed.

1021
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,889
But to tell you the truth.
To tell you the truth.

1022
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:34,032
I enjoyed saving your more..

1023
01:09:34,702 --> 01:09:38,729
..than I enjoyed
thinking of getting you killed.

1024
01:09:41,042 --> 01:09:45,001
Alex and Bajrangi.

1025
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,682
Alex and Bajrangi.

1026
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:54,082
Alex and Bajrangi.

1027
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:56,214
Alex and Bajrangi.

1028
01:10:07,335 --> 01:10:11,032
I was this parched when
I stole the smoking pipe from..

1029
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:16,270
..the hideout of dacoit Laakhan.

1030
01:10:16,344 --> 01:10:20,872
Actually Bajju,
normally I only drink Bisleri.

1031
01:10:21,883 --> 01:10:24,784
But today I am so thirsty
today that I will compromise.

1032
01:10:24,852 --> 01:10:26,114
Come on.

1033
01:10:26,187 --> 01:10:27,745
I'll get water for you.

1034
01:10:27,822 --> 01:10:31,280
No, sir. Let me bring the water.

1035
01:10:31,526 --> 01:10:37,158
Come on, dude. Are you my best
friend or am I your best friend?

1036
01:10:37,231 --> 01:10:38,823
You are my best friend.

1037
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,835
So you must listen
to your best friend.

1038
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:44,130
Understood?

1039
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:50,874
Water. Your color is always the same.

1040
01:10:50,945 --> 01:10:56,178
You take on the color of
anything you are mixed into.

1041
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:09,621
I am not a tiger.

1042
01:11:09,697 --> 01:11:10,959
No. No. Don't kill me.
- I am not a tiger.

1043
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:12,727
Don't kill me.
- I am a cat.

1044
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,268
Don't kill me.
- Don't kill me.

1045
01:11:15,336 --> 01:11:17,031
Don't kill me.
- Don't kill me.

1046
01:11:17,105 --> 01:11:19,005
No. No. Don't kill me.

1047
01:11:19,073 --> 01:11:21,940
Bajrangi. Thank God
Begum madam you are here.

1048
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:23,601
Or he had almost eaten me.

1049
01:11:23,678 --> 01:11:25,339
I am thirsty. I...

1050
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,774
Brother Tiger.

1051
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:31,983
Let me go.

1052
01:11:32,053 --> 01:11:35,045
I am not a tiger. I am a cat.

1053
01:11:37,992 --> 01:11:39,084
Brother Tiger...

1054
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:46,255
If humans have their way,
they'll kill all the tigers one by one.

1055
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:48,335
I didn't want to die.

1056
01:11:48,803 --> 01:11:52,762
That's why I started leading
the life of a cat to evade them.

1057
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,800
And in calling myself a cat,
I forget how to live like a tiger.

1058
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:02,379
I know that you must be
thinking that I am a coward.

1059
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:05,382
Yes, I am a coward.

1060
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:08,316
And perhaps I haven't
become some hunter's trophy..

1061
01:12:08,389 --> 01:12:11,847
..until now because I am a coward.

1062
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:18,924
You aren't a coward.
You are only trying to save your life.

1063
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,260
As I was by looking for
excuses not go to Delhi.

1064
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:23,826
But now I have understood.

1065
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,130
This mission isn't
for one single jungle..

1066
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:30,337
..but for every animal that
is living in fear in his home.

1067
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:31,840
You are right, Alu.

1068
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:33,944
So convey our message to them.

1069
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:36,313
We are not going to Delhi.

1070
01:12:36,784 --> 01:12:38,274
No one's going to Delhi.

1071
01:12:40,888 --> 01:12:46,019
We had gone mad that we were
thinking of teaching humans humanity.

1072
01:12:46,327 --> 01:12:49,694
We were going to complain
about one human to another human.

1073
01:12:49,931 --> 01:12:51,626
All of them are the same.

1074
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:54,998
Cruel and heartless.
They won't spare anyone.

1075
01:12:55,069 --> 01:12:57,037
You. Me. This...

1076
01:13:00,308 --> 01:13:02,071
I won't let anything happen to Yuvi.

1077
01:13:03,644 --> 01:13:05,077
I am taking Yuvi and going away.

1078
01:13:05,146 --> 01:13:06,704
All of you also run away.

1079
01:13:06,781 --> 01:13:09,807
We'll not go to Delhi.
No one's going to Delhi.

1080
01:13:09,884 --> 01:13:11,977
No one's going to Delhi.

1081
01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:15,315
'I'll have to call someone.'

1082
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:18,022
'He is the only who
can make mummy yield.'

1083
01:13:33,574 --> 01:13:37,169
Look mummy. Papa.
He has come to meet you.

1084
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:39,110
As I used to say that he will come.

1085
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:42,707
See. - There is no one there,
Yuvi. Stop it.

1086
01:13:42,783 --> 01:13:46,344
Your father never did
come nor will he ever come.

1087
01:13:46,587 --> 01:13:47,713
No, mummy.

1088
01:13:47,788 --> 01:13:52,020
Papa is here. See. Can't you see him?

1089
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:54,118
No. I don't see anyone.

1090
01:13:54,195 --> 01:13:56,220
But I can see him clearly.

1091
01:13:56,998 --> 01:13:59,990
Aunt, see. I can see Sultan.

1092
01:14:00,835 --> 01:14:04,862
Yes. Yes.
Aunt, I am telling you. See.

1093
01:14:04,939 --> 01:14:07,567
But not there. Here.

1094
01:14:07,808 --> 01:14:11,266
In Yuvi. Don't you see?
In his courage.

1095
01:14:11,712 --> 01:14:13,680
The courage that
brought all of us this far.

1096
01:14:13,981 --> 01:14:17,109
I see Sultan in the friendship of
Alex and Bajrangi.

1097
01:14:17,184 --> 01:14:19,345
A friendship that has
left animosity behind.

1098
01:14:19,587 --> 01:14:24,650
I see Sultan in you, Ms. Begum.
In your love for your son.

1099
01:14:25,726 --> 01:14:27,159
This courage, friendship, this love.

1100
01:14:27,228 --> 01:14:30,163
These are the things that
made Sultan, the Sultan.

1101
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:33,223
Who says Sultan can't be seen?

1102
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:36,134
Sultan is with us even today.
Yes. He is right here.

1103
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:40,096
I myself didn't know
why I am on this journey.

1104
01:14:40,174 --> 01:14:41,300
Why am I needed here?

1105
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:42,736
Only to joke and fool around.

1106
01:14:43,277 --> 01:14:48,544
Now I know. Perhaps I was needed
here so that not just this kid..

1107
01:14:48,749 --> 01:14:50,683
..but all of us are
able to see Sultan.

1108
01:15:15,242 --> 01:15:20,578
Sultan.
- Begum, Delhi isn't far now.

1109
01:15:20,781 --> 01:15:30,179
Keep forging on.
Delhi isn't far now.

1110
01:15:34,662 --> 01:15:43,730
Keep forging on.
Delhi isn't far now.

1111
01:15:43,804 --> 01:15:52,234
Our courage says that
we'll stopover here.

1112
01:15:52,313 --> 01:15:57,649
I was mad and crazy.
I didn't realize my mistakes.

1113
01:15:57,718 --> 01:16:01,779
I have now accepted my mistakes.

1114
01:16:01,856 --> 01:16:06,884
We won't turn back now.
We'll just forge ahead.

1115
01:16:06,961 --> 01:16:13,696
This is what we have decided.

1116
01:16:13,768 --> 01:16:18,205
This is what. Just this.

1117
01:16:18,572 --> 01:16:20,130
Attack.

1118
01:16:20,207 --> 01:16:25,304
I will take a step.
And you follow me.

1119
01:16:25,546 --> 01:16:29,778
The caravan of love
is heading for Delhi.

1120
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:34,048
I will take a step.
And you follow me.

1121
01:16:34,121 --> 01:16:41,118
The caravan of love
is heading for Delhi.

1122
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:48,602
Here you are. Delhi has arrived.

1123
01:16:48,669 --> 01:16:50,068
And parliament.

1124
01:16:50,137 --> 01:16:51,968
Yes. Yes. But what do we do now?

1125
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:53,939
It's impossible to get in.

1126
01:16:54,008 --> 01:16:55,202
I have a...
- I have.a plan.

1127
01:16:55,609 --> 01:16:57,577
Okay. You say. You first.

1128
01:16:57,645 --> 01:16:58,942
No. No. Go ahead.

1129
01:16:59,013 --> 01:17:01,106
You first.
- No. You first. - No way.

1130
01:17:01,282 --> 01:17:03,614
You first.
- No. Just say it.

1131
01:17:03,684 --> 01:17:04,844
You first.
- You first.

1132
01:17:04,919 --> 01:17:06,045
I am saying you first.

1133
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,849
Oh shut up the two of you.

1134
01:17:07,922 --> 01:17:10,584
We'll miss the bus in
deciding who goes first.

1135
01:17:10,658 --> 01:17:13,821
Aunt, you must have a plan.

1136
01:17:14,228 --> 01:17:17,891
No.
- No! What?! You don't have a plan.

1137
01:17:17,965 --> 01:17:19,626
Oh God! What are we going to do?

1138
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,928
We'll have to come up with something?

1139
01:17:21,001 --> 01:17:22,525
We'll have to come up with something?

1140
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:25,094
It's not going to happen
that we open the truck's doors.

1141
01:17:25,172 --> 01:17:27,936
Step out on the street.
Create a racket.

1142
01:17:28,008 --> 01:17:30,499
And the media will come
rushing to us with their microphones.

1143
01:17:30,578 --> 01:17:33,843
And ask us. Hello, Mr. Bugsy,
why have you come here?

1144
01:17:35,649 --> 01:17:37,674
'Mr. Bagga, you are a genius.'

1145
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,199
Move that car..

1146
01:17:54,268 --> 01:17:57,533
..out of the way.'

1147
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:01,264
Animals. Animals.
Don't let them escape.

1148
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:03,833
Hit them.

1149
01:18:03,911 --> 01:18:07,608
Hit them.

1150
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:11,583
Hit them.

1151
01:18:13,254 --> 01:18:14,744
Yuvi!

1152
01:18:29,737 --> 01:18:30,795
Mummy!

1153
01:18:31,172 --> 01:18:34,801
Baj, today for the first time I feel
that you should also have a gun.

1154
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:36,274
You are right, Toto.

1155
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:39,570
I also feel only gun can do
the trick. And not talking.

1156
01:18:39,647 --> 01:18:40,705
Cover them.

1157
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:43,008
Get to the side.

1158
01:18:43,284 --> 01:18:46,219
NDTV. CNN. The entire media is here.

1159
01:18:46,287 --> 01:18:48,983
The entire nation is watching us.

1160
01:18:49,056 --> 01:18:51,183
Alex, talk.

1161
01:19:03,237 --> 01:19:04,761
Go. Go. You were the only one missing.

1162
01:19:04,838 --> 01:19:06,305
What happened, Alex?

1163
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,298
Why don't you say something?

1164
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:11,768
Stage fright, dude. Give me a minute.

1165
01:19:11,845 --> 01:19:13,210
Stage fright. You?

1166
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,976
Remember? You are an artist. Come on.

1167
01:19:17,284 --> 01:19:22,278
Look at them.
They have run away from the jungle.

1168
01:19:22,523 --> 01:19:27,586
They have woken up after
leaving the shade of trees behind.

1169
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:31,688
They have come here
evading all troubles.

1170
01:19:31,765 --> 01:19:36,498
Risking their lives.

1171
01:19:36,737 --> 01:19:41,174
I am afraid they might get lost.

1172
01:19:41,242 --> 01:19:43,733
These animals on earth.

1173
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:46,041
He has definitely
had some green chilies.

1174
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:50,049
That's why he is singing
out of intoxication, brother.

1175
01:19:50,784 --> 01:19:52,615
'This is great. They have reached.'

1176
01:19:52,686 --> 01:19:55,086
'They have reached Delhi. Attention.'

1177
01:19:55,155 --> 01:19:59,114
I was cent percent confident.
Who gave them directions?

1178
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:01,189
You.

1179
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:07,895
I have lost my peace.
Get your eyes off me.

1180
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:12,632
I have lost my peace.
Get your eyes off me.

1181
01:20:12,706 --> 01:20:16,972
These jungle creatures
are getting ruined now.

1182
01:20:17,044 --> 01:20:20,536
So that their hopes are
not dashed. Please come.

1183
01:20:20,614 --> 01:20:24,675
Please come. Please come.
My brother from the parliament.

1184
01:20:24,752 --> 01:20:28,620
Please come. Please come.
My brother from the parliament.

1185
01:20:30,024 --> 01:20:31,116
What the hell.

1186
01:20:31,191 --> 01:20:33,591
He sings great even when he is drunk.

1187
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:36,293
Great!

1188
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:37,997
He is still singing drunk, brother.

1189
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:40,261
These are trained animals from circus.

1190
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:41,593
Send him to lndian ldol.

1191
01:20:41,669 --> 01:20:43,899
A monkey who looks like Guru.
- Where?

1192
01:20:43,971 --> 01:20:46,303
On TV.
- That's no monkey.

1193
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:49,941
That's Guru himself.
I had said that Guru will get there.

1194
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:53,673
When did he say that?
- When you didn't hear.

1195
01:20:54,014 --> 01:20:57,245
Toto. Toto, what are you doing?

1196
01:20:57,318 --> 01:21:00,617
Remember Huggy Waggy.

1197
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:04,146
To hell with your Huggy.
And to hell with your Buggy.

1198
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:07,992
You are making fun of us.
People are making fun of us, Toto.

1199
01:21:08,062 --> 01:21:10,587
What are you doing?
- He is right, Alu.

1200
01:21:10,931 --> 01:21:13,559
Why are you weakening our
mission by putting on this act?

1201
01:21:13,634 --> 01:21:16,933
Guys. Guys.
You guys must first trust me.

1202
01:21:17,004 --> 01:21:19,029
If I had given a serious lecture..

1203
01:21:19,106 --> 01:21:21,131
..the people of lndia
would have disappeared.

1204
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:22,334
Understood?

1205
01:21:24,778 --> 01:21:25,904
Enjoyed?

1206
01:21:26,146 --> 01:21:29,343
Hearing a parrot singing.
You laughed to your heart's content?

1207
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:31,879
Everyone laughed at my singing.

1208
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:34,849
But did anyone hear what I sang?

1209
01:21:35,923 --> 01:21:39,051
Did anyone realize how a parrot,
a monkey, a leopard, her cub..

1210
01:21:39,126 --> 01:21:44,564
..a bear reached
Delhi's parliament? And why?

1211
01:21:45,566 --> 01:21:47,693
What problem dragged them this far?

1212
01:21:48,102 --> 01:21:52,129
Or no one could stop
laughing to understand our pain.

1213
01:21:55,609 --> 01:21:57,702
So you tell us why you have come here?

1214
01:21:57,778 --> 01:22:02,772
I will tell you. But only when
someone from this parliament..

1215
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:06,711
..who is capable enough and has
intentions of helping us shows up.

1216
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,285
Right now the entire country wants..

1217
01:22:08,355 --> 01:22:09,982
..to know the story of these animals.

1218
01:22:10,057 --> 01:22:11,388
And there has been
a lot of commotion inside..

1219
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:12,956
..the parliament house right now.

1220
01:22:13,026 --> 01:22:16,018
We are seeing that here is
chaos in the parliament.

1221
01:22:16,096 --> 01:22:18,155
Even the trust vote supposed to
happen today has been stopped.

1222
01:22:18,232 --> 01:22:20,029
I repeat. The trust
vote has been stopped.

1223
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,692
Instead of watching the daily soaps..

1224
01:22:21,769 --> 01:22:22,997
..every mother-in-law
and daughter-in-law..

1225
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,697
..are keeping a close eye on
these animals gathered outside..

1226
01:22:24,772 --> 01:22:25,966
..the parliament.

1227
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:27,666
We have been here for many hours.

1228
01:22:27,741 --> 01:22:29,299
And we have been waiting
outside the parliament house..

1229
01:22:29,543 --> 01:22:31,636
..only to know whether someone
from the parliament is actually..

1230
01:22:31,712 --> 01:22:33,680
..going to hear these animals out.
- I have got breaking news.

1231
01:22:33,747 --> 01:22:35,908
It is rumored that
the prime minister himself..

1232
01:22:35,983 --> 01:22:37,746
..is coming out to hear these animals.

1233
01:22:37,818 --> 01:22:40,616
TADA and MODA had been
the topics of discussions until now.

1234
01:22:40,687 --> 01:22:42,314
But now a bear, a monkey,
two leopards and a parrot..

1235
01:22:42,556 --> 01:22:43,818
..are the talk of the town now.

1236
01:22:59,673 --> 01:23:01,004
Back up. Back up.

1237
01:23:03,143 --> 01:23:05,611
Tell me. Tell me what you have to say.

1238
01:23:05,913 --> 01:23:07,847
Talk, Alex. Talk.

1239
01:23:08,048 --> 01:23:11,916
Convey our message to every human.

1240
01:23:17,257 --> 01:23:19,282
We've come here to tell you that...

1241
01:23:32,873 --> 01:23:35,205
That every human's life is in danger.

1242
01:23:35,275 --> 01:23:40,008
Crores of animals are going to
attack your homes and families.

1243
01:23:41,148 --> 01:23:42,615
What is he saying!

1244
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:47,587
Your house, your family and your
life. Everything will be finished.

1245
01:23:47,921 --> 01:23:49,752
We will kill everyone one by one.

1246
01:23:49,823 --> 01:23:53,589
Now a war will ensue that will
wipe out the human race. - Oh my God.

1247
01:23:53,894 --> 01:23:55,919
Kill. Kill them. Kill them.

1248
01:23:57,764 --> 01:24:01,359
Shocked? Got angry? Got
scared for your lives.

1249
01:24:01,602 --> 01:24:03,763
For your homes. For your own.

1250
01:24:04,972 --> 01:24:09,204
Perhaps you must've realized a
little what we have been through.

1251
01:24:09,977 --> 01:24:12,810
Because we aren't attacking
you but you are attacking us.

1252
01:24:14,047 --> 01:24:16,106
Not since today. But since ages.

1253
01:24:16,183 --> 01:24:18,913
With guns, bulldozers. With pollution.

1254
01:24:18,986 --> 01:24:21,750
By cutting down jungles.
By killing animals.

1255
01:24:21,822 --> 01:24:24,017
You have dogs, parrots
or cats as pets so..

1256
01:24:24,091 --> 01:24:26,787
..that you can play with them.

1257
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:30,023
But kill crores of
animals for their teeth..

1258
01:24:30,097 --> 01:24:32,327
..skin and various other parts.

1259
01:24:33,934 --> 01:24:37,097
Isn't our home a home?
Aren't our children dear to us?

1260
01:24:37,337 --> 01:24:39,168
Is our life worthless?

1261
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:43,039
What is this fault of this cub?
That his father was killed.

1262
01:24:43,343 --> 01:24:46,176
The age at which he should
be laughing and playing..

1263
01:24:46,647 --> 01:24:49,343
..he gathered all of us and
brought us to Delhi to save his home.

1264
01:24:49,883 --> 01:24:53,717
So that we can plead to
humans for our friends and jungle.

1265
01:24:53,987 --> 01:24:57,821
But when we reached here,
we were welcomed with guns.

1266
01:24:57,891 --> 01:24:59,552
With shouts of Kill them.
Kill them.

1267
01:25:01,662 --> 01:25:04,756
We have come from jungle.
But you humans are animals..

1268
01:25:04,831 --> 01:25:07,129
..whose first reaction
to anything is action.

1269
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:10,598
When we left home
Delhi was very far away.

1270
01:25:11,138 --> 01:25:14,130
But all of us didn't come to
Delhi this far just for reaching it.

1271
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:16,232
But we came to reach to your hearts.

1272
01:25:16,643 --> 01:25:18,975
And if we've managed to
reach there even slightly..

1273
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:22,981
..then stop deforestation.
Stop fighting.

1274
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:27,214
Today together let's wage
a war against war. Against hatred.

1275
01:25:27,588 --> 01:25:31,080
Not just for one single jungle.
But for the entire world.

1276
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:38,064
Attack. Attack.

1277
01:25:42,069 --> 01:25:44,128
Attack.

1278
01:25:47,074 --> 01:25:49,167
Attack.

1279
01:25:58,285 --> 01:25:59,946
Attack.

1280
01:26:00,253 --> 01:26:02,118
Attack.

1281
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,118
Attack.

1282
01:26:14,334 --> 01:26:19,897
Attack. Attack. Attack. Attack.

1283
01:26:20,173 --> 01:26:24,735
Attack. Attack. Attack. Attack.

1284
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:26,841
Come on!

1285
01:26:26,913 --> 01:26:31,714
Attack. Attack.

1286
01:26:36,256 --> 01:26:38,053
Attack.

1287
01:26:57,678 --> 01:26:58,872
Rock on.

1288
01:27:51,998 --> 01:27:55,798
The happy day has arrived.
There is no worry now.

1289
01:27:55,869 --> 01:27:59,862
Come, let's have a party.
Let's have a grand celebration.

1290
01:28:03,744 --> 01:28:07,202
The happy day has arrived.
There is no worry now.

1291
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:11,216
Come, let's have a party.
Let's have a grand celebration.

1292
01:28:11,284 --> 01:28:15,015
Let's eat and meet.
Let's have some drinking.

1293
01:28:15,088 --> 01:28:19,024
Let's have some disco and singing.

1294
01:28:19,092 --> 01:28:23,188
I want to lose control.
There is rumble in my heart.

1295
01:28:23,263 --> 01:28:26,699
No war. Jungle rules.

1296
01:28:26,767 --> 01:28:30,669
No fight. No war. Jungles rules.

1297
01:28:38,011 --> 01:28:41,845
Come on. Shake it and have fun.

1298
01:28:41,915 --> 01:28:45,715
Come on.
Let the entire neighborhood rock.

1299
01:28:45,786 --> 01:28:49,654
Come on. Shake it and have fun.

1300
01:28:49,723 --> 01:28:53,591
Come on.
Let the entire neighborhood rock.

1301
01:29:01,635 --> 01:29:04,570
I saw. You saw. He saw.
The peacock danced in the jungle.

1302
01:29:04,638 --> 01:29:05,730
Who saw?

1303
01:29:05,806 --> 01:29:09,936
I saw. You saw. He saw.
Look. Look. Jungle rules.

1304
01:29:13,246 --> 01:29:17,114
No fight. No war. Jungles rules.

1305
01:29:17,184 --> 01:29:20,779
No fight. No war. Jungles rules.

1306
01:29:20,854 --> 01:29:22,719
Why put on make-up?

1307
01:29:22,789 --> 01:29:24,780
You look beauty cutie.

1308
01:29:24,858 --> 01:29:28,692
I am crazy about your look.
I am at your service.

1309
01:29:28,762 --> 01:29:32,596
Celebrate. You have holiday today.

1310
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:36,568
Do whatever you want.
I won't be upset.

1311
01:29:36,636 --> 01:29:40,572
I love you madly.
You have driven me crazy.

1312
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,076
No fight. No war. Jungles rules.

1313
01:29:44,144 --> 01:29:47,773
No fight. No war. Jungles rules.

1314
01:29:47,848 --> 01:29:51,648
Come on. Shake it and have fun.

1315
01:29:51,718 --> 01:29:55,313
Come on.

01:29:55,555 --> 01:29:59,252
Come on. Shake it and have fun.

1317
01:29:59,326 --> 01:30:03,160
Come on.
Let the entire neighborhood rock.

1318
01:30:11,238 --> 01:30:15,004
No fight. No war. Jungles rules.

1319
01:30:15,075 --> 01:30:18,977
No fight. No war. Jungles rules.

1320
01:30:19,045 --> 01:30:22,879
No fight. No war. Jungles rules.

1321
01:30:22,949 --> 01:30:24,883
No fight. No war.

1322
01:30:24,951 --> 01:30:28,648
Look. Look. Jungle rules.
