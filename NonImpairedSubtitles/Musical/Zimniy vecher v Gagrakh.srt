AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE
KNOWN EACH OTHER.

THAT YOU WILL EITHER
HOLD THE MARRIAGE

ALAIS MARRIES RICHARD,
OR WE'LL HAVE THE COUNTY BACK
AT ONCE.

THAT'S CLEAR, CONCISE

IT'S A TANGLE.

GAVE THE AQUITAINE TO RICHARD.

THAT MAKES RICHARD
VERY POWERFUL.

- PHILIP.

I HAVE THE MAKINGS OF A KING ?

AND WOULD YOU EXPECT ME,

WITHOUT A FIGHT ?

AS BEING KING.

00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,522
DEAR LORD.

435
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:51,525
YOU'VE LOVED ME
ALL THESE YEARS.

436
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:57,031
OH, GOD FORGIVE ME.
I'VE UPSET THE QUEEN.
WE NEED YOU.  HELP US.

437
00:38:57,031 --> 00:38:59,033
WHAT-- AND MISS THE FUN
OF SELLING YOU ?

438
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:01,535
BE RICHARD'S CHANCELLOR.

440
00:39:12,546 --> 00:39:15,549
WELL, THAT'S HOW
DEALS ARE MADE.

441
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,553
WE'VE GOT HIM
IF WE WANT HIM.

HE'LL SELL US ALL,
YOU KNOW,

443
00:39:22,556 --> 00:39:25,059
BUT ONLY IF HE THINKS
WE THINK HE WON'T.

444
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,564
WHY DID I HAVE TO HAVE
SUCH CLEVER CHILDREN ?

445

[ Bell Tolling ]

446
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:40,074
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
RICHARD ?
NOTHING.

447
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:42,576
IT'S A HEAVY THING,
YOUR NOTHING.

448
00:39:42,576 --> 00:39:45,579
WHEN I WRITE OR SEND FOR YOU
OR SPEAK OR REACH,

449
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:49,583
YOUR NOTHINGS COME,
LIKE STONES.

450
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,086
DON'T PLAY A SCENE WITH ME.

451
00:39:52,086 --> 00:39:55,589
I WOULDN'T IF I COULD.
I'M SIMPLER THAN I USED TO BE.

452
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,591
I HAD, AT ONE TIME,
MANY APPETITES.

453
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:01,595
I WANTED POETRY AND POWER
AND THE YOUNG MEN
WHO CREATE THEM BOTH.

454
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:05,099
I EVEN WANTED HENRY, TOO,
IN THOSE DAYS.

455
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,603
NOW I'VE ONLY ONE DESIRE LEFT--
TO SEE YOU KING.

456
00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:12,106
THE ONLY THING YOU WANT
TO SEE IS FATHER'S VITALS
ON A BED OF LETTUCE.

457
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:15,609
YOU DON'T CARE WHO WINS,
AS LONG AS HENRY LOSES.
YOU'D DO ANYTHING.

458
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:17,611
YOU ARE MEDEA TO THE TEETH,

459
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:21,615
ONLY THIS IS ONE SON
YOU WON'T USE FOR VENGEANCE
AGAINST YOUR HUSBAND.

460
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:25,619
HOW MY CAPTIVITY HAS
CHANGED YOU.

461
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:31,625
HENRY MEANT TO HURT ME.
HE'S HACKED YOU UP INSTEAD.

462
00:40:34,128 --> 00:40:37,131
MEN COVETED THIS TALON ONCE.

463
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:41,135
HENRY WAS 18 WHEN WE MET,
AND I WAS QUEEN OF FRANCE.

464
00:40:41,135 --> 00:40:44,638
HE CAME DOWN
FROM THE NORTH TO PARIS
WITH A MIND LIKE ARISTOTLE'S...

465
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:48,642
AND A FORM LIKE MORTAL SIN.

466
00:40:48,642 --> 00:40:52,146
WE SHATTERED THE COMMANDMENTS
ON THE SPOT.

467
00:40:52,146 --> 00:40:56,150
I SPENT THREE MONTHS
ANNULLING LOUIS,
THEN IN MAY, IN SPRING,

468
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,652
NOT FAR FROM HERE,
WE MARRIED--

469
00:40:58,652 --> 00:41:01,655
YOUNG COUNT HENRY
AND HIS COUNTESS.

470
00:41:02,156 --> 00:41:07,661
BUT IN THREE YEARS' TIME
I WAS HIS QUEEN,
AND HE WAS KING OF ENGLAND.

471
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:13,667
DONE AT 21--
FIVE YEARS YOUR JUNIOR,
GENERAL.

472
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:18,672
I CAN COUNT.
THERE WAS NO THOMAS BECKET THEN,
OR ROSAMUND--

473
00:41:18,805 --> 00:41:22,176
NO RIVALS, ONLY ME.

474
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:26,680
AND THEN YOUNG HENRY CAME,
 AND YOU...

475
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,684
AND ALL THE OTHER BLOSSOMS
IN MY GARDEN.

476
00:41:30,684 --> 00:41:35,656
YES.  HAD I BEEN STERILE,
DARLING, I'D BE HAPPIER TODAY.

477
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:38,192
IS THAT DESIGNED TO HURT ME ?
WHAT A WASTE.

478
00:41:38,692 --> 00:41:41,195
I'VE FOUGHT WITH HENRY
OVER WHO COMES NEXT,
WHOSE DAWN IT IS...

479
00:41:41,528 --> 00:41:44,698
AND WHICH SON GETS THE SUNSET,
 AND WE'LL NEVER LIVE TO SEE IT.

480
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,202
LOOK AT YOU.

481
00:41:48,702 --> 00:41:51,705
I LOVED YOU MORE THAN HENRY,

482
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:54,208
AND IT'S COST ME EVERYTHING.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

483
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:59,713
I WANT US BACK
THE WAY WE WERE.
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

484
00:41:59,713 --> 00:42:02,716
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I WANT THE AQUITAINE.

485
00:42:03,217 --> 00:42:07,721
THAT'S THE MOTHER I REMEMBER.
WE CAN WIN.
I CAN GET YOU ALAIS.

486
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:11,225
I CAN MAKE THE MARRIAGE HAPPEN,
BUT I'VE GOT TO HAVE
THE AQUITAINE TO DO IT.

487
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:14,194
I MUST HAVE IT BACK.
IT'S MINE,
AND I'LL NEVER GIVE IT UP.

488
00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:18,232
SHALL I WRITE MY WILL,
"TO RICHARD-- EVERYTHING" ?

489
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:22,236
WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME THEN ?
WHERE'S PAPER ?
PAPER BURNS.

490
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:26,707
I LOVE YOU.

491
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:29,209
YOU LOVE NOTHING.

ARE MISSING.

DON'T YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOU LOVED ME ?

498
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:54,735
WE WERE ALWAYS HAND IN HAND.

499
00:42:54,735 --> 00:42:58,739
HERE'S HOW IT FELT.
AS HOT AND COARSE AS THAT ?

500
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:03,243
THIS WON'T BURN.
I'LL SCRATCH A WILL ON THIS.

REMEMBER HOW I
TAUGHT YOU NUMBERS...

504
00:43:13,253 --> 00:43:15,756
AND THE LUTE AND POETRY ?

505
00:43:15,756 --> 00:43:19,259
SEE ?  YOU DO REMEMBER.

506
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:22,763
I TAUGHT YOU DANCING, TOO,
AND LANGUAGES...

507
00:43:22,763 --> 00:43:26,767
AND ALL THE MUSIC I KNEW
AND HOW TO LOVE
WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

THERE'S NOT A WORD OF TRUTH

WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A DEAL

AND WHAT KIND OF DEAL ?

IF WE THREE JOIN AND FIGHT NOW,
WE CAN FINISH RICHARD OFF.

I CAN'T SEE WHY HE SHOULDN'T.
AFTER ALL, I'VE PROMISED HIM
THE THRONE.

581
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:33,073
THE BOY KEEPS WONDERING
IF YOUR PROMISES ARE ANY GOOD.

582
00:48:33,073 --> 00:48:37,077
THERE'S NO SENSE ASKING IF
THE AIR'S GOOD WHEN THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE TO BREATHE.

583
00:48:37,077 --> 00:48:39,579
EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD HIM.

584
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,584
HAVE YOU GOT IT ?
WILL HE GIVE IT BACK ?

585
00:48:44,584 --> 00:48:47,587
NO AQUITAINE FOR JOHN.

586
00:48:54,094 --> 00:48:58,598
I HAVE TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING.
ISN'T SOME AGREEMENT POSSIBLE ?

587
00:48:58,598 --> 00:49:03,103
LOVE, IN A WORLD WHERE
CARPENTERS GET RESURRECTED,
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

588
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:05,105
YOU BORE HIM, DAMN IT.
HE'S YOUR SON !

589
00:49:05,105 --> 00:49:09,609
OH, HEAVENS, YES.
280 DAYS I BORE HIM.

590
00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:12,112
I RECALL THEM ALL.

591
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:14,614
YOU'D ONLY JUST FOUND ROSAMUND.

592
00:49:14,614 --> 00:49:18,618
WHY HER SO DAMN PARTICULARLY ?
I'VE FOUND OTHER WOMEN.

593
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,122
COUNTLESS OTHERS.

594
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:24,124
WHAT'S YOUR COUNT ?

595
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:28,128
LET'S HAVE A TALLY
OF THE BEDSPREADS
YOU'VE SPREAD OUT ON.

596
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,633
THOMAS BECKET'S.
THAT'S A LIE.

597
00:49:34,634 --> 00:49:40,140
[ Chuckling ]
I KNOW.
YOU STILL CARE WHAT I DO.

598
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,143
I WANT THE AQUITAINE FOR JOHN !
 I WANT IT, AND I'LL HAVE IT.

599
00:49:43,143 --> 00:49:46,146
IS THAT MENACE
YOU'RE CONVEYING ?
IS IT TO BE TORTURE ?

600
00:49:46,646 --> 00:49:50,650
WILL YOU BOIL ME
OR STRETCH ME-- WHICH ?
OR AM I TO BE PERFORATED ?

601
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:53,153
I HAVE THE DOCUMENTS,
AND YOU WILL SIGN.

602
00:49:53,153 --> 00:49:57,157
HOW WILL YOU FORCE ME TO--
THREATS ?
"SIGN OR I REFUSE TO FEED YOU."

603
00:49:57,157 --> 00:50:02,662
TEARS ?
"OH, SIGN BEFORE MY HEART
 GOES CRACK."

604
00:50:02,662 --> 00:50:06,666
I'M LIKE THE EARTH, OLD MAN--
THERE ISN'T ANY WAY AROUND ME.

605
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:08,668
I ADORE YOU.

606
00:50:09,169 --> 00:50:12,172
SAVE YOUR ACHING ARCHES.
THAT ROAD'S CLOSED.

607
00:50:13,673 --> 00:50:15,675
I HAVE AN OFFER FOR YOU,
MY DEAR.

608
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:18,178
A DEAL ?  A DEAL ?

609
00:50:18,178 --> 00:50:23,183
I GIVE THE RICHEST PROVINCE
ON THE CONTINENT TO JOHN
FOR WHAT ?

610
00:50:23,683 --> 00:50:27,187
YOU TELL ME,
MASTERMIND, FOR WHAT.

611
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,692
YOUR FREEDOM.

612
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,701
OH.

613
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:44,704
ONCE JOHNNY GETS THE AQUITAINE,
YOU'RE FREE.  I'LL LET YOU OUT.

614
00:50:45,038 --> 00:50:48,708
THINK: ON THE LOOSE IN LONDON,
WINTERS IN PROVENCE,

615
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,711
IMPROMPTU TRIPS TO VISIT RICHARD
ANYWHERE HE'S KILLING PEOPLE--

616
00:50:52,712 --> 00:50:56,716
ALL THAT FOR A SIGNATURE.

617
00:50:56,716 --> 00:51:01,721
- YOU'RE GOOD.
- I THOUGHT IT MIGHT APPEAL.
  YOU ALWAYS FANCIED TRAVELING.

618
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:03,723
YES.

619
00:51:03,723 --> 00:51:07,727
I EVEN MADE POOR LOUIS
TAKE ME ON CRUSADE.

620
00:51:07,727 --> 00:51:10,230
HOW'S THAT FOR BLASPHEMY ?

621
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:15,735
I DRESSED MY MAIDS AS AMAZONS
AND RODE BARE-BREASTED
HALFWAY TO DAMASCUS.

622
00:51:15,735 --> 00:51:18,738
LOUIS HAD A SEIZURE,
AND I DAMN NEAR DIED
OF WINDBURN,

623
00:51:23,743 --> 00:51:26,246
BUT THE TROOPS WERE DAZZLED.

624
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:33,753
HENRY, I'M AGAINST THE WALL.

625
00:51:36,256 --> 00:51:38,258
TO BE A PRISONER--

626
00:51:39,259 --> 00:51:41,761
TO BE BRICKED IN...

627
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:44,764
WHEN YOU'VE KNOWN THE WORLD--

628
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:50,770
I'LL NEVER KNOW HOW I SURVIVED.

629
00:51:52,272 --> 00:51:57,277
THESE TEN YEARS, HENRY,
HAVE BEEN UNIMAGINABLE.

630
00:51:59,779 --> 00:52:01,781
AND NOW,

631
00:52:04,284 --> 00:52:07,787
YOU OFFER ME
THE ONLY THING I WANT...

632
00:52:07,787 --> 00:52:10,290
IF I GIVE UP...

633
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,792
THE ONLY THING I TREASURE.

634
00:52:14,294 --> 00:52:17,297
SIGN THE PAPER,
AND WE'LL BREAK
THE HAPPY NEWS.

635
00:52:17,297 --> 00:52:21,801
THE QUEEN IS FREE,
JOHN GETS THE AQUITAINE,
AND RICHARD MARRIES ALAIS.

636
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:25,305
YES, LET'S HAVE IT DONE.

637
00:52:25,305 --> 00:52:27,307
I'LL SIGN.

638
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:32,312
ON ONE CONDITION.
NAME IT.

639
00:52:32,312 --> 00:52:36,316
HAVE THE WEDDING NOW.
WHAT'S THAT ?

640
00:52:36,316 --> 00:52:40,320
WHY, I'VE SURPRISED YOU.
SURELY IT'S NOT SUDDEN.

641
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,824
THEY'VE BEEN MARCHING
DOWN THE AISLE FOR 16 YEARS,
AND THAT'S A LONG WALK.

642
00:52:44,824 --> 00:52:48,328
JOHN CAN BE BEST MAN.
THAT'S A LAUGH.

643
00:52:48,328 --> 00:52:52,832
AND YOU CAN GIVE
THE BRIDE AWAY.  I WANT
TO WATCH YOU DO IT.

644
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:57,337
ALAIS--
I CAN LIVE WITHOUT HER.

645
00:52:57,337 --> 00:52:59,839
AND I THOUGHT
YOU LOVED HER.
SO I DO.

646
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:03,343
THANK GOD.
YOU FRIGHTENED ME.  I WAS
AFRAID THIS WOULDN'T HURT.

647
00:53:03,843 --> 00:53:06,346
WHAT A TRAGEDY YOU ARE.

648
00:53:08,848 --> 00:53:13,853
I WONDER--
DO YOU EVER WONDER...

649
00:53:14,854 --> 00:53:17,857
IF I SLEPT
WITH YOUR FATHER ?

650
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:26,366
MY FATHER ?
IT'S A LIE.

651
00:53:26,366 --> 00:53:28,368
BUT THERE ARE RUMORS.

652
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:31,371
DON'T YOU EVER WONDER ?

653
00:53:31,871 --> 00:53:34,874
IS IT RICH, DESPISING ME ?
 IS IT REWARDING ?
NO.

654
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:37,377
THEN STOP !
HOW ?

655
00:53:37,577 --> 00:53:39,879
IT'S WHAT I LIVE FOR.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

656
00:53:40,246 --> 00:53:42,382
BY CHRIST, I WILL.
I'LL DO IT.

657
00:53:42,382 --> 00:53:46,219
WHERE'S A PRIEST ?
SOMEBODY DIG ME UP A PRIEST !

658
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:50,890
YOU !
FETCH ME A BISHOP !

659
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,893
GET OLD DURHAM.
HE'S JUST DOWN THE HALL.

660
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:57,397
ASK HIM TO MEET US
IN THE CHAPEL.
JOHN, RICHARD, GEOFFREY !

661
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:01,401
[ Dogs Barking ]

662
00:54:23,423 --> 00:54:25,925
[ Barking, Growling ]

663
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:33,433
WHAT'S WRONG ?
 WHAT'S HAPPENED ?
RICHARD'S GETTING MARRIED.

664
00:54:33,933 --> 00:54:38,438
GETTING MARRIED ?  NOW ?
HE'S GETTING MARRIED NOW ?

665
00:54:38,438 --> 00:54:40,940
I NEVER CEASE TO MARVEL
AT THE QUICKNESS
OF YOUR MIND.

666
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,443
YOU CAN'T HURT ME,
 YOU BAG OF BILE.

667
00:54:43,443 --> 00:54:45,945
BUT YOU CAN, FATHER.
WHY ?
BECAUSE I SAY SO.

668
00:54:45,945 --> 00:54:49,449
MY LORD, THE BISHOP'S
WAITING IN THE CHAPEL.
GOOD.  LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

669
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:52,452
YOU'LL MAKE A LOVELY BRIDE.
I WONDER IF I'LL CRY.

670
00:54:52,452 --> 00:54:55,955
YOU SOUND AS IF YOU THINK
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
I DO.

671
00:54:55,955 --> 00:54:57,957
HE'S ONLY PLOTTING.
CAN'T YOU TELL
WHEN HENRY'S PLOTTING ?

672
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:00,460
NOT THIS TIME.
HE'LL NEVER GIVE ME UP.

673
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,462
YOU THINK I WON'T ?
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME SO.

674
00:55:02,462 --> 00:55:05,465
YOU'RE NOT MY HELEN.
I WON'T FIGHT A WAR TO SAVE
A FACE.  WE'RE DONE.

675
00:55:05,465 --> 00:55:08,968
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU !
WAIT TEN MINUTES !

676
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:15,975
PLEASE !  RICHARD, RICHARD,
WE'RE NOT--

677
00:55:15,975 --> 00:55:17,977
HONESTLY, WE'RE NOT !

679
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,483
PLEASE !
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

680
00:55:26,986 --> 00:55:31,991
COME ON !
IT'S LUNACY !
I WON'T DO IT !  I WON'T !

681
00:55:32,408 --> 00:55:36,996
- LUNACY !  LET ME GO, HENRY.
  RICHARD, NO !
- COME ON !

682
00:55:37,246 --> 00:55:39,499
I WON'T SAY THE WORDS !
NOT ONE OF THEM !

683
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:42,001
IT MAKES NO SENSE !
WHY GIVE ME UP ?

684
00:55:42,001 --> 00:55:45,505
WHAT DO YOU GET ?
 WHAT ARE YOU GAINING ?

685
00:55:45,505 --> 00:55:49,008
WHY, THE AQUITAINE,
OF COURSE.

686
00:55:49,008 --> 00:55:51,010
WHAT'S THAT AGAIN ?

687
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,513
YOUR MOTHER
GETS HER FREEDOM,
AND I GET THE AQUITAINE.

688
00:55:53,513 --> 00:55:56,015
THAT IS THE PROPOSITION,
ISN'T IT ?  YOU DID AGREE.

689
00:55:56,015 --> 00:55:59,018
OF COURSE SHE DID.
I KNEW IT.  IT WAS ALL PRETENSE.
I BELIEVED IT ALL.

690
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:02,522
I MEANT IT ALL.
NO WEDDING.
THERE'LL BE NO WEDDING.

691
00:56:02,522 --> 00:56:05,525
BUT, MY BOY, LOOK.
DURHAM'S WAITING.

692
00:56:05,525 --> 00:56:09,478
MARRY HER, FOR MY SAKE.
IT ISN'T MUCH TO ASK.
NEVER !

693
00:56:09,562 --> 00:56:12,031
BUT I PROMISED IT TO PHILIP.
THINK OF MY POSITION.

694
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:15,034
DAMN THE WEDDING
AND TO HELL WITH YOUR POSITION.
YOU DON'T DARE DEFY ME.

695
00:56:15,535 --> 00:56:17,537
DON'T I ?

696
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:21,541
YOU'RE THE KING OF FRANCE,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.  SPEAK UP.
DO SOMETHING.

697
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:24,043
MAKE A THREAT.
COME ON, FRIGHTEN ME.  AM I ?
DUNCE !

698
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,547
HE NEVER MEANT
TO HAVE THE WEDDING.

699
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:31,551
COME AGAIN.
YOU'RE GOOD AT RAGE.
I LIKE THE WAY YOU PLAY IT.

700
00:56:31,551 --> 00:56:34,554
BOY, DON'T EVER CALL A KING
A LIAR TO HIS FACE.

701
00:56:35,054 --> 00:56:39,058
I'M NOT A BOY...
TO YOU OR ANYONE !

702
00:56:39,058 --> 00:56:41,561
BOY, YOU CAME HERE ASKING
FOR A WEDDING OR THE VEXIN BACK.

703
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:46,065
BY GOD, YOU DON'T GET EITHER.
IT'S NO TO BOTH.
YOU HAVE A PACT WITH FRANCE !

704
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:49,569
THEN DAMN THE PACT
AND DAMN FRANCE.  SHE NEVER
MARRIES, NOT WHILE I'M ALIVE.

705
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:52,572
YOUR LIFE AND NEVER
ARE TWO DIFFERENT TIMES.

706
00:56:52,905 --> 00:56:57,577
NOT ON MY CLOCK, BOY !
[ Laughing ]
LISTEN TO THE LION !

707
00:56:57,577 --> 00:57:01,581
COME ON, FRIGHTEN ME.
DON'T SPOIL IT, RICHARD.
TAKE IT LIKE A GOOD SPORT.

708
00:57:01,664 --> 00:57:03,583
HOW'S YOUR BAD LEG ?
BETTER, THANK YOU.

709
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:07,086
YOUR BAD BACK ?
YOU'RE GETTING OLD.
YOU'LL HAVE ME ONCE TOO OFTEN.

710
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:10,590
WHEN ?  I'M 50 NOW.
MY GOD, BOY, I'M
THE OLDEST MAN I KNOW.

711
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,592
I'VE GOT A DECADE
ON THE POPE.

712
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:19,098
WHAT'S IT TO BE ?
THE BROADSWORD
WHEN I'M 85 ?

713
00:57:19,098 --> 00:57:22,551
I'M NOT A SECOND SON NOW.
YOUR HENRY'S LIES IN THE VAULT,
YOU KNOW.

714
00:57:22,635 --> 00:57:26,606
I KNOW.
I'VE SEEN HIM THERE.

715
00:57:26,889 --> 00:57:29,108
I'LL HAVE THE CROWN.
YOU'LL HAVE
WHAT DADDY GIVES YOU.

716
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:32,612
I AM NEXT IN LINE !
TO NOTHING !

717
00:57:32,612 --> 00:57:34,614
THEN WE'LL ONLY HAVE
THE BROADSWORDS NOW.
THIS MINUTE ?

718
00:57:34,614 --> 00:57:36,616
NO, ON THE BATTLEFIELD !
SO WE'RE AT WAR ?

719
00:57:36,616 --> 00:57:39,619
YES, WE'RE AT WAR.
I HAVE 2,000 MEN AT POITIERS.
CAN THEY HEAR YOU ?

720
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:42,121
CALL AND SEE WHO ANSWERS.
YOU'RE AS CLOSE TO POITIERS
AS YOU'LL GET.

YOU'RE A KING'S SON, SO I
TREAT YOU WITH RESPECT.  YOU
HAVE THE FREEDOM OF THE CASTLE.

I FOOLED YOU, DIDN'T I ?

OH, GOD, BUT I DO LOVE
BEING KING.

PLAY WITH FEELINGS, HENRY.
NOT WITH MINE.

IT WASN'T POSSIBLE
TO LOSE YOU.

AND HOW IT FELT.

THAT FAR BACK, BUT NEVER ONCE
CAN I REMEMBER...

WARMER THAN INDIFFERENCE.

869
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:44,082
IF YOU'RE A PRINCE,
THERE'S HOPE FOR EVERY APE
IN AFRICA.

870
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:47,118
I HAD YOU SAVED.
I WASN'T ON MY WAY TO FATHER,
BUT HE WAS.

871
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:50,622
HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO HENRY
AND BETRAYED YOU.
LOOK, IT'S IN HIS FACE.

872
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,626
IT'S TRUE.  I DON'T KNOW
WHO MY FRIENDS ARE.

873
01:08:54,626 --> 01:08:58,630
[ Knocking ]
[ Richard ]
PHILIP ?

874
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,632
PHILIP ?

875
01:09:01,633 --> 01:09:04,636
MAY WE ?
THAT'S WHAT
TAPESTRIES ARE FOR.

876
01:09:06,137 --> 01:09:08,640
I'LL NEVER LEARN.
 I'LL RUIN EVERYTHING.

877
01:09:14,646 --> 01:09:18,149
RICHARD ?
HELLO, RICHARD.

878
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:22,153
YOU'RE HALFWAY TO BED.
I'LL WAIT FOR MORNING.
COME IN.

879
01:09:22,153 --> 01:09:25,156
MOTHER SENT ME.
COME IN ANYWAY.

880
01:09:32,163 --> 01:09:34,666
OUR ALCHEMISTS HAVE STUMBLED
ON THE ART OF BOILING BURGUNDY.

881
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:39,671
IT TURNS TO STEAM,
AND WHEN IT COOLS,
WE CALL IT BRANDYWINE.

882
01:09:39,671 --> 01:09:43,174
I'M HENRY'S PRISONER.
YOU FIND THAT CHARMING ?

883
01:09:43,675 --> 01:09:45,677
NO.
THEN WHY
THE CHARMING SMILE ?

884
01:09:45,677 --> 01:09:47,679
I THOUGHT,
 I CAN'T THINK WHY,

885
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,681
OF WHEN YOU WERE
IN PARIS LAST.

886
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:53,184
CAN IT BE
TWO WHOLE YEARS AGO ?
IT CAN.  I NEED AN ARMY.

887
01:09:53,184 --> 01:09:55,186
IT'LL TAKE THE COLD AWAY.
I MUST HAVE SOLDIERS.

888
01:09:55,186 --> 01:09:58,690
HAVE I AGED ?
DO I SEEM OLDER TO YOU ?

889
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:02,694
THEY'VE BEEN TWO FIERCE YEARS.
I'VE STUDIED, AND I'VE TRAINED
TO BE A KING.

890
01:10:03,194 --> 01:10:07,198
I'LL HAVE YOUR ANSWER--
YES OR NO ?
YOU'LL HAVE IT WHEN I GIVE IT.

891
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:09,200
YOU SEE ?
I'VE CHANGED.

892
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,704
I'M NOT THE BOY YOU TAUGHT
TO HUNT TWO YEARS AGO.
REMEMBER ?

893
01:10:12,704 --> 01:10:15,206
RACING AFTER BOAR,
YOU FLYING FIRST,

894
01:10:15,707 --> 01:10:19,711
ME SCRAMBLING AFTER,
ALL DAY INTO DUSK.

895
01:10:19,711 --> 01:10:23,715
DON'T GO.
I MUST KNOW.
WILL YOU HELP ME ?

896
01:10:23,715 --> 01:10:26,684
SIT AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT.

897
01:10:36,728 --> 01:10:39,230
YOU NEVER WRITE.
TO ANYONE.

898
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,733
WHY SHOULD I MAKE YOU
KING OF ENGLAND ?

899
01:10:42,233 --> 01:10:44,702
AREN'T I BETTER OFF
WITH JOHN OR GEOFFREY ?

900
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:47,739
WHY HAVE YOU TO FIGHT
WHEN I COULD HAVE
THE CRETIN OR THE FIEND ?

901
01:10:47,739 --> 01:10:51,242
WOULD WE FIGHT ?
WE'RE FIGHTING NOW.
GOOD NIGHT.

902
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:55,747
YOU'RE STILL A BOY.

903
01:10:55,963 --> 01:10:59,250
IN SOME WAYS.
WHICH WAY DID YOU HAVE IN MIND ?

904
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,755
YOU HAVEN'T ASKED
HOW MUCH YOUR HELP IS WORTH.
YOU'LL TELL ME.

905
01:11:03,755 --> 01:11:05,757
YOU CAN HAVE THE VEXIN BACK.
AND WHAT ELSE ?

906
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:08,226
ALL OF BRITTANY.
DOES THAT MATTER ?
THAT'S GEOFFREY'S.

907
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:11,262
POSSIBLY TO GEOFFREY.
AND WHAT ELSE ?
THAT'S ALL YOUR HELP IS WORTH.

908
01:11:11,262 --> 01:11:13,264
AND IN RETURN,
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME ?

909
01:11:13,347 --> 01:11:15,266
TWO THOUSAND SOLDIERS.

910
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:17,268
- AND WHAT ELSE ?
- FIVE HUNDRED KNIGHTS ON HORSE.

911
01:11:17,735 --> 01:11:19,771
- AND WHAT ELSE ?
- ARMS AND SIEGE EQUIPMENT.

912
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:24,275
- AND WHAT ELSE ?
- I NEVER WROTE BECAUSE
  I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ANSWER.

913
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:30,782
YOU GOT MARRIED.

914
01:11:30,782 --> 01:11:34,786
DOES THAT MAKE
A DIFFERENCE ?
DOESN'T IT ?

915
01:11:37,288 --> 01:11:41,292
I'VE SPENT TWO YEARS
ON EVERY STREET IN HELL.

916
01:11:45,296 --> 01:11:47,799
THAT'S ODD.
I NEVER SAW YOU THERE.

917
01:12:14,325 --> 01:12:16,327
YOU HAVEN'T SAID
 YOU LOVED ME.

918
01:12:23,835 --> 01:12:25,837
WHEN THE TIME COMES.

919
01:12:34,345 --> 01:12:37,849

IT'S NOT TOO LATE
AT NIGHT ?

923
01:13:01,372 --> 01:13:04,375
I'D HOPED YOU'D COME.
GOOD !

924
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:07,879
WE COULDN'T LEAVE NEGOTIATIONS
WHERE THEY WERE.

925
01:13:10,882 --> 01:13:13,885
AH !

926
01:13:13,885 --> 01:13:17,388
I KEEP LOOKING
FOR YOUR FATHER IN YOU.
HE'S NOT THERE.

927
01:13:17,388 --> 01:13:19,891
I'LL MISS HIM.

928
01:13:20,391 --> 01:13:22,393
HAS RICHARD OR THE QUEEN
BEEN HERE TO SEE YOU ?

929
01:13:22,894 --> 01:13:26,397
DOES IT MATTER ?
IF THEY HAVEN'T YET,
THEY WILL.

930
01:13:26,864 --> 01:13:30,902
I WANT TO REACH A SETTLEMENT.
I LEFT YOU WITH
TOO LITTLE EARLIER.

931
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:33,404
YES.
NOTHING IS TOO LITTLE.

932
01:13:33,404 --> 01:13:35,907
I'M SORRY
YOU'RE NOT FONDER OF ME, LAD.

933
01:13:35,907 --> 01:13:39,410
YOUR FATHER ALWAYS SAID,
"BE FOND OF STRONGER MEN."

934
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,412
NO WONDER
HE LOVED EVERYONE.

935
01:13:42,914 --> 01:13:46,417
I'VE COME TO YOU
TO OFFER PEACE.

936
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:49,921
PISS ON YOUR PEACE.

937
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:53,424
YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE WEPT.

938
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:55,927
MY FATHER WAS A WEEPER.

939
01:13:57,929 --> 01:13:59,931
FIGHT ME, AND YOU'LL LOSE.

940
01:14:00,348 --> 01:14:02,934
I CAN'T LOSE, HENRY.

941
01:14:03,434 --> 01:14:06,437
I HAVE TIME.
WHY, JUST LOOK AT YOU.

942
01:14:06,854 --> 01:14:10,441
GREAT HEAVY ARMS.
BUT EACH YEAR THEY GET
A LITTLE HEAVIER.

943
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:14,445
THE SAND GOES PIT-PAT
IN THE GLASS.

944
01:14:14,445 --> 01:14:18,950
I'M IN NO HURRY, HENRY.
I'VE GOT TIME.

945
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:22,954
SUPPOSE I HURRY THINGS ALONG.
SUPPOSE I SAY THAT ENGLAND
IS AT WAR WITH FRANCE.

946
01:14:22,954 --> 01:14:27,458

TO WIN.

THIS COUNTY, THAT ONE.
YOU WON'T KEEP IT LONG.

WHAT KIND OF COURAGE
HAVE YOU GOT ?

949
01:14:36,968 --> 01:14:38,970
THE TIDAL KIND--

950
01:14:41,472 --> 01:14:43,975
IT COMES AND GOES.

951
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:47,979
BY GOD, I'D LOVE TO
TURN YOU LOOSE ON ELEANOR.
MORE BRANDYWINE ?

952
01:14:47,979 --> 01:14:52,984
YOU RECOGNIZE IT ?
THEY WERE BOILING IT IN IRELAND
BEFORE THE SNAKES LEFT.

953
01:14:52,984 --> 01:14:57,989
WELL, THINGS LOOK A LITTLE BLEAK
FOR HENRY, DON'T THEY ?

954
01:14:57,989 --> 01:15:02,994
YOU'LL SAY YES TO RICHARD
WHEN HE COMES-- ARMS, SOLDIERS,
ANYTHING HE ASKS.

955
01:15:02,994 --> 01:15:04,996
I'D BE FOOLISH NOT TO.
YEAH.

956
01:15:05,496 --> 01:15:10,001
AND WITHDRAW IT ALL
BEFORE THE BATTLE EVER STARTED.
WOULDN'T YOU, IN MY PLACE ?

957
01:15:10,335 --> 01:15:12,837
WHY FIGHT HENRY WHEN HIS SONS
WILL DO IT FOR YOU ?

958
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,340
YES, EXACTLY.

959
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:19,844
- YOU'VE GOT PROMISE, LAD.
  THAT'S FIRST-CLASS THINKING.
-THANK YOU, SIR.

960
01:15:33,358 --> 01:15:37,362
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT ?  YOU'RE GOING ?
WE HAVEN'T SETTLED ANYTHING.

961
01:15:37,612 --> 01:15:40,865
WE OPEN CHRISTMAS PRESENTS
AT NOON.  TILL THEN.
YOU CAN'T BE FINISHED WITH ME.

962
01:15:41,366 --> 01:15:44,369
OH, BUT I AM.
IT'S BEEN MOST SATISFACTORY.
WHAT'S SO SATISFACTORY ?

963
01:15:44,369 --> 01:15:49,374
WINNING IS.
I DID JUST WIN.
SURELY YOU NOTICED.

964
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:54,379
NOT A THING.
YOU HAVEN'T WON
A DAMN THING.

HMM.
[ Sighs ]

966
01:15:58,383 --> 01:16:02,887
I FOUND OUT
THE WAY YOUR MIND WORKS
AND THE KIND OF MAN YOU ARE.

967
01:16:02,887 --> 01:16:04,889
I KNOW YOUR PLANS
AND EXPECTATIONS.

968
01:16:04,889 --> 01:16:06,891
YOU'VE BURBLED EVERY BIT
OF STRATEGY YOU'VE GOT.

969
01:16:06,891 --> 01:16:09,394
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL DO
AND EXACTLY WHAT YOU WON'T.

970
01:16:09,394 --> 01:16:11,396
AND I'VE TOLD YOU
EXACTLY NOTHING !

971
01:16:11,396 --> 01:16:15,900
TO THESE AGED EYES, BOY,
THAT'S WHAT WINNING LOOKS LIKE !
DORMEZ BIEN.

972
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,902
YOU--

973
01:16:20,154 --> 01:16:23,408
YOU MADE MY FATHER NOTHING.

974
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:27,412
YOU WERE ALWAYS BETTER.

975
01:16:28,913 --> 01:16:30,915
YOU BULLIED HIM,

976
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:33,918
YOU BELLIED WITH HIS WIFE,

977
01:16:33,918 --> 01:16:36,421
YOU BEAT HIM DOWN
IN EVERY WAR,

978
01:16:36,421 --> 01:16:38,923
YOU TWISTED EVERY TREATY,

979
01:16:38,923 --> 01:16:41,926
YOU PLAYED MOCK THE MONK,

980
01:16:42,427 --> 01:16:45,930
AND THEN YOU MADE HIM
LOVE YOU FOR IT.

981
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:48,433
I WAS THERE.

982
01:16:48,433 --> 01:16:51,936
HIS LAST WORDS
WENT TO YOU.

983
01:16:51,936 --> 01:16:54,439
HE WAS A LOVING MAN, AND YOU'VE
LEARNED NOTHING OF IT.

984
01:16:54,939 --> 01:16:59,944
I LEARNED HOW MUCH FATHERS
LIVE IN SONS.

985
01:16:59,944 --> 01:17:03,448
A KING LIKE YOU HAS POLICY
PREPARED ON EVERYTHING.

986
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:07,952
WHAT'S THE OFFICIAL LINE
ON SODOMY ?

987
01:17:08,085 --> 01:17:12,957
HOW STANDS THE CROWN
ON BOYS WHO DO WITH BOYS ?

988
01:17:17,962 --> 01:17:20,965
RICHARD FINDS HIS WAY
INTO SO MANY LEGENDS.

989
01:17:20,965 --> 01:17:23,468
LET'S HEAR YOURS
AND SEE HOW IT COMPARES.

990
01:17:23,468 --> 01:17:25,970
HE FOUND ME FIRST
WHEN I WAS 15.

991
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,972
WE WERE HUNTING.
IT WAS NEARLY DARK.

992
01:17:27,972 --> 01:17:31,476
MY HORSE FELL,
I WAS THROWN.

993
01:17:31,476 --> 01:17:33,978
I WOKE TO RICHARD
TOUCHING ME.

994
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,482
HE ASKED ME
IF I LOVED HIM.

995
01:17:37,698 --> 01:17:41,986
"PHILIP, DO YOU LOVE ME ?"

996
01:17:43,488 --> 01:17:45,990
AND I TOLD HIM, "YES."

997
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:49,460
DO YOU KNOW WHY
I TOLD HIM YES ?

998
01:17:50,495 --> 01:17:54,999
SO THAT ONE DAY I COULD
TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

999
01:17:54,999 --> 01:17:58,503
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE
WHAT THAT "YES" COST.

1000
01:17:58,503 --> 01:18:03,508
IMAGINE SNUGGLING
TO A CHANCRED WHORE...

1001
01:18:03,508 --> 01:18:07,512
AND BENDING BACK YOUR LIPS
INTO SOMETHING LIKE A SMILE,
SAYING,

1002
01:18:07,512 --> 01:18:09,514
"YES,

1003
01:18:11,015 --> 01:18:14,519
"I LOVE YOU,

1004
01:18:15,019 --> 01:18:18,022
"AND I FIND YOU...

1005
01:18:18,022 --> 01:18:20,024
BEAUTIFUL."

1006
01:18:23,027 --> 01:18:25,029
I DON'T KNOW HOW I DID IT.

1007
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,034
- NO !  IT WASN'T LIKE THAT !
- BUT IT WAS.

1008
01:18:32,537 --> 01:18:35,039
YOU LOVED ME.

1009
01:18:41,546 --> 01:18:43,548
NEVER.

1010
01:18:53,057 --> 01:18:56,060
GET OUT.  PLEASE.

1011
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,062
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

1012
01:18:58,563 --> 01:19:01,065
IT'S NO GREAT PLEASURE
TO BE HERE.

1013
01:19:01,065 --> 01:19:04,068
SO THE ROYAL CORKSCREW
FINDS ME TWISTED, DOES HE ?

1014
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:07,572

NOT HENRY.
 NOT MY BURIED BROTHER.

WHY ALWAYS HIM
AND NEVER ME ?

1160
01:32:55,065 --> 01:32:59,569
- WELL, WIFE,
  WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND ?
- I'VE JUST SEEN RICHARD.

1161
01:32:59,986 --> 01:33:03,073
SPLENDID BOY.
HE SAYS YOU FOUGHT.

1162
01:33:03,573 --> 01:33:05,575
WE ALWAYS DO.

1163
01:33:05,575 --> 01:33:09,079
IT'S HIS IMPRESSION
THAT YOU MEAN
TO DISINHERIT THEM.

1164
01:33:09,079 --> 01:33:11,081
I FANCY I'LL RELENT.

1165
01:33:11,247 --> 01:33:14,084
DON'T YOU ?
I DON'T MUCH CARE.

1166
01:33:14,084 --> 01:33:16,586
IN FACT, I WONDER, HENRY,
IF I CARE FOR ANYTHING.

1167
01:33:16,586 --> 01:33:18,588
I WONDER IF I'M HUNGRY
OUT OF HABIT.

1168
01:33:19,089 --> 01:33:21,591
I COULD LISTEN TO YOU LIE
FOR HOURS.

1169
01:33:21,591 --> 01:33:26,096
SO YOUR LUST IS RUSTY.
GORGEOUS.

1170
01:33:28,098 --> 01:33:30,100
HENRY, I'M SO TIRED.

1171
01:33:30,233 --> 01:33:33,603
SLEEP THEN.
SLEEP AND DREAM OF ME
WITHCROUTONS.

1172
01:33:33,603 --> 01:33:35,605
HENRI A LA MODE.

1173
01:33:35,855 --> 01:33:39,109
- HENRY, STOP IT.
- ELEANOR, I HAVEN'T STARTED.

1174
01:33:39,109 --> 01:33:42,112
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
YOU WANT MY NAME ON PAPER ?
I'LL SIGN ANYTHING.

1175
01:33:42,112 --> 01:33:44,114
YOU WANT THE AQUITAINE
FOR JOHN ?  IT'S JOHN'S.

1176
01:33:44,114 --> 01:33:48,118
IT'S HIS, IT'S YOURS,
 IT'S ANYBODY'S.
IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT ?

1177
01:33:48,118 --> 01:33:50,120
FOR NOTHING.
 FOR A LITTLE QUIET.

1178
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,122
FOR AN END TO THIS,
 FOR GOD'S SAKE.

1179
01:33:52,122 --> 01:33:54,124
SAIL ME BACK TO ENGLAND,
LOCK ME UP...

1180
01:33:54,624 --> 01:33:57,127
AND LOSE THE KEY
 AND LET ME BE ALONE.

1181
01:34:02,632 --> 01:34:04,634
YOU HAVE MY OATH.

1182
01:34:07,137 --> 01:34:10,640
I GIVE MY WORD.
OH, WELL.

1183
01:34:12,225 --> 01:34:14,644
WELL, WELL.

1184
01:34:17,147 --> 01:34:21,651
WOULD YOU LIKE A PILLOW ?
FOOTSTOOL ?  HOW ABOUT A SHAWL ?

1185
01:34:22,068 --> 01:34:26,656
YOUR OATHS ARE ALL PROFANITIES,
YOUR WORDS A CURSE, YOUR NAME
ON PAPER IS A WASTE OF PULP !

1186
01:34:26,739 --> 01:34:30,160
I'M VILIFYING YOU,
FOR GOD'S SAKE !
PAY ATTENTION !

1187
01:34:32,162 --> 01:34:34,164
HOW,

1188
01:34:34,664 --> 01:34:36,666
FROM WHERE WE STARTED,

1189
01:34:38,168 --> 01:34:41,671
DID WE EVER REACH
THIS CHRISTMAS ?

1190
01:34:44,674 --> 01:34:46,676
STEP BY STEP.

1191
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,681
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME NOW ?

1192
01:34:51,681 --> 01:34:56,186
THAT'S LIVELY CURIOSITY
FROM SUCH A DEAD CAT.

1193
01:34:56,186 --> 01:34:59,689
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
MY PLANS, JUST ASK ME.

1194
01:34:59,689 --> 01:35:02,192
CONQUER CHINA,
SACK THE VATICAN,
OR TAKE THE VEIL.

1195
01:35:02,692 --> 01:35:05,695
I'M NOT AMONG THE ONES
WHO GIVE A DAMN.

1196
01:35:05,695 --> 01:35:10,200
JUST LET ME SIGN MY LANDS
TO JOHN AND GO TO BED.

1197
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,702
NO, YOU'RE TOO KIND.
I CAN'T ACCEPT.

1198
01:35:12,702 --> 01:35:16,706
COME ON, MAN, I'LL SIGN
THE THING IN BLOOD OR SPIT
OR BRIGHT BLUE INK.

1199
01:35:16,706 --> 01:35:19,209
LET'S HAVE IT DONE.
LET'S NOT.

1200
01:35:19,209 --> 01:35:23,213
NO, I DON'T THINK I WANT
YOUR SIGNATURE ON ANYTHING.

1201
01:35:25,715 --> 01:35:28,218
YOU DON'T ?
DEAR GOD,

1202
01:35:28,718 --> 01:35:32,222
THE PLEASURE I STILL GET
FROM GOADING YOU.

1203
01:35:32,222 --> 01:35:37,227
YOU DON'T WANT JOHN
TO HAVE MY PROVINCES ?
BULL'S-EYE.

1204
01:35:37,227 --> 01:35:40,730
I CAN'T BEAR YOU
WHEN YOU'RE SMUG.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1205
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:45,235
YOU DON'T WANT RICHARD,
AND YOU DON'T WANT JOHN.
YOU'VE GRASPED IT.

1206
01:35:45,235 --> 01:35:48,738
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
SHATTER ME !

1207
01:35:48,738 --> 01:35:53,243
LET ME HAVE IT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

1208
01:35:55,745 --> 01:35:57,747
A NEW WIFE.

1209
01:36:05,755 --> 01:36:07,757
OH.

1210
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:13,763
SO,

1211
01:36:13,763 --> 01:36:16,766
I'M TO BE ANNULLED.

1212
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:24,274
WELL,
WILL THE POPE ANNUL ME,

1213
01:36:24,574 --> 01:36:26,276
DO YOU THINK ?

1214
01:36:26,276 --> 01:36:30,246
THE PONTIFF OWES ME
ONE PONTIFICATE.
I THINK HE WILL.

1215
01:36:31,781 --> 01:36:34,284
OUT ELEANOR,

1216
01:36:34,284 --> 01:36:36,286
IN ALAIS.

1217
01:36:39,289 --> 01:36:44,794
- WHY ?
- A NEW WIFE, WIFE,
  WILL BEAR ME SONS.

1218
01:36:46,296 --> 01:36:49,799
THAT IS THE SINGLE THING...

1219
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:54,304
OF WHICH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU HAD ENOUGH.

1220
01:36:54,721 --> 01:36:57,307
I WANT A SON.
WE COULD POPULATE...

1221
01:36:57,607 --> 01:37:02,312
A COUNTRY TOWN
WITH COUNTRY GIRLS
WHO'VE BORNE YOU SONS.

1222
01:37:02,812 --> 01:37:05,315
HOW MANY IS IT ?
HELP ME COUNT THE BASTARDS.

1223
01:37:05,648 --> 01:37:07,817
ALL MY SONS ARE BASTARDS.

1224
01:37:15,825 --> 01:37:19,829
YOU REALLY MEAN TO DO IT.
LADY LOVE,
WITH ALL MY HEART.

1225
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:22,832
YOUR SONS ARE PART OF YOU.

1226
01:37:22,832 --> 01:37:25,335
LIKE WARTS AND GOITERS,
AND I'M HAVING THEM REMOVED.

1227
01:37:25,335 --> 01:37:28,838
WE'VE MADE THEM.
THEY'RE OUR BOYS.

1228
01:37:28,838 --> 01:37:31,841
I KNOW, AND GOOD GOD,
LOOK AT THEM.

1229
01:37:32,008 --> 01:37:33,843
GEOFFREY--
THERE'S A MASTERPIECE.

1230
01:37:33,843 --> 01:37:37,847
HE ISN'T FLESH, HE'S A DEVICE.
HE'S WHEELS AND GEARS.

1231
01:37:38,181 --> 01:37:41,351
AND JOHNNY--

1232
01:37:41,351 --> 01:37:44,354
WAS HIS LATEST TREASON
YOUR IDEA ?

1233
01:37:46,856 --> 01:37:50,360
I CAUGHT HIM LYING,
AND I'VE SAID, "HE'S YOUNG."

1234
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:53,363
I FOUND HIM CHEATING,
AND I'VE SAID,
"HE'S JUST A BOY."

1235
01:37:53,363 --> 01:37:58,868
I'VE WATCHED HIM STEAL
AND WHORE AND WHIP HIS SERVANTS,
AND HE'S NOT A CHILD.

1236
01:37:58,868 --> 01:38:00,870
HE'S THE MAN WE MADE HIM.

1237
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:04,374
DON'T SHARE JOHN WITH ME.

1238
01:38:04,874 --> 01:38:08,378
HE'S YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENT.
AND RICHARD'S YOURS.

1239
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:13,883
HOW COULD YOU SEND HIM OFF
TO DEAL WITH PHILIP ?

1240
01:38:15,385 --> 01:38:17,387
I WAS TIRED.

1241
01:38:17,387 --> 01:38:19,389
I WAS BUSY.

1242
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:22,392
THEY WERE FRIENDS.

1243
01:38:22,392 --> 01:38:25,895
ELEANOR, HE WAS THE BEST.

1244
01:38:27,897 --> 01:38:31,901
FROM THE CRADLE ON,
YOU CRADLED HIM.
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE.

1245
01:38:31,901 --> 01:38:34,904
YOU NEVER WANTED ONE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW ?
YOU TOOK HIM.

1246
01:38:35,405 --> 01:38:38,408
SEPARATION FROM
YOUR HUSBAND YOU COULD BEAR,
BUT NOT YOUR SON.

1247
01:38:38,408 --> 01:38:42,912
WHATEVER I HAVE DONE,
YOU MADE ME DO.

1248
01:38:42,912 --> 01:38:44,914
YOU THREW ME OUT OF BED
FOR RICHARD.

1249
01:38:44,914 --> 01:38:46,916
NOT UNTIL YOU THREW ME OUT
FOR ROSAMUND.

1250
01:38:46,916 --> 01:38:52,922
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
I WON'T HAVE IT TO BE
THAT SIMPLE.

1251
01:38:52,922 --> 01:38:56,926
I ADORED YOU.
NEVER.

1252
01:38:56,926 --> 01:38:59,429
I STILL DO.

1253
01:38:59,929 --> 01:39:02,932
OF ALL THE LIES,
THAT ONE IS THE MOST TERRIBLE.

1254
01:39:02,932 --> 01:39:07,937
I KNOW.  THAT'S WHY
 I SAVED IT UP FOR NOW.

1255
01:39:19,449 --> 01:39:24,454
OH, HENRY, WE'VE MANGLED
EVERYTHING WE'VE TOUCHED.

1256
01:39:25,955 --> 01:39:29,959
DENY US WHAT YOU WILL,
WE HAVE DONE THAT.

1257
01:39:32,962 --> 01:39:36,466
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE MET ?

1258
01:39:36,466 --> 01:39:40,970
DOWN TO THE HOUR
AND COLOR OF YOUR STOCKINGS.

1259
01:39:45,975 --> 01:39:49,479
I COULD HARDLY SEE YOU
FOR THE SUNLIGHT.

1260
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:52,482
IT WAS RAINING,
BUT NO MATTER.

1261
01:39:56,486 --> 01:40:00,490
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALK,
AS I RECALL.

1262
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:02,992
VERY LITTLE.

1263
01:40:02,992 --> 01:40:06,996
I HAD NEVER SEEN
SUCH BEAUTY.

1264
01:40:06,996 --> 01:40:09,999
I WALKED RIGHT UP
AND TOUCHED IT.

1265
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:15,004
GOD, WHERE DID I FIND
THE GALL TO DO THAT ?

1266
01:40:15,004 --> 01:40:18,007
IN MY EYES.

1267
01:40:18,508 --> 01:40:20,510
I LOVED YOU.

1268
01:40:33,523 --> 01:40:36,526
NO ANNULMENT.

1269
01:40:36,526 --> 01:40:40,530
WHAT ?
THERE WILL BE
NO ANNULMENT.

1270
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:44,534
WILL THERE NOT ?
NO, I'M AFRAID
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO WITHOUT.

1271
01:40:44,534 --> 01:40:48,037
WELL, IT WAS
JUST A WHIM.

1272
01:40:48,037 --> 01:40:52,041
I'M SO RELIEVED.
I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

1273
01:40:54,043 --> 01:40:59,048
OUT OF CURIOSITY,
AS INTELLECTUAL
TO INTELLECTUAL,

1274
01:40:59,549 --> 01:41:02,552
HOW IN THE NAME
OF BLEEDING JESUS
CAN YOU LOSE ME ?

1275
01:41:04,554 --> 01:41:06,055
DO WE EVER SEE EACH OTHER ?
AM I EVER NEAR YOU ?

1276
01:41:06,556 --> 01:41:09,058
EVER WITH YOU ?
AM I EVER ANYWHERE
BUT SOMEWHERE ELSE ?

1277
01:41:09,559 --> 01:41:11,561
DO I WRITE ?
 DO WE SEND MESSAGES ?

1278
01:41:11,561 --> 01:41:15,565
DO DINGHIES BEARING GIFTS
FLOAT UP THE THAMES TO YOU ?
ARE YOU REMEMBERED ?

1279
01:41:15,565 --> 01:41:17,567
YOU ARE.

1280
01:41:17,567 --> 01:41:21,070
YOU'RE NO PART OF ME.
WE DO NOT TOUCH
AT ANY POINT.

1281
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:25,575
HOW CAN YOU LOSE ME ?
CAN'T YOU FEEL THE CHAINS ?

1282
01:41:25,575 --> 01:41:28,578
YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH
TO KNOW I CAN'T BE STOPPED.

1283
01:41:29,078 --> 01:41:32,582
I DON'T HAVE TO STOP YOU.
 I HAVE ONLY TO DELAY YOU.

1284
01:41:32,582 --> 01:41:38,087
EVERY ENEMY YOU HAVE
HAS FRIENDS IN ROME.
WE'LL COST YOU TIME.

1285
01:41:38,087 --> 01:41:41,591
WHAT IS THIS ?
I'M NOT MOLDERING.

1286
01:41:41,591 --> 01:41:46,095
MY PAINT'S NOT PEELING.
I'M GOOD FOR YEARS.
HOW MANY YEARS ?

1287
01:41:46,178 --> 01:41:50,600
SUPPOSE I HOLD YOU BACK FOR ONE.
I CAN.  IT'S POSSIBLE.

1288
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:55,605
SUPPOSE YOUR FIRST SON DIES.
OURS DID.  IT'S POSSIBLE.

1289
01:41:55,605 --> 01:41:59,108
SUPPOSE YOU'RE DAUGHTERED NEXT.
WE WERE.

1290
01:41:59,108 --> 01:42:02,111
THAT, TOO,
IS POSSIBLE.

1291
01:42:02,111 --> 01:42:05,615
HOW OLD IS DADDY THEN ?

1292
01:42:05,948 --> 01:42:08,450
WHAT KIND OF SPINDLY,

1293
01:42:08,533 --> 01:42:12,454
RICKETT-RIDDEN, MILKY,
WIZENED, DIM-EYED,

1294
01:42:12,454 --> 01:42:18,460
GAMMY-HANDED, LIMPY LINE
OF THINGS WILL YOU BEGET ?

1295
01:42:18,543 --> 01:42:20,963
IT'S SWEET OF YOU TO CARE.

1296
01:42:20,963 --> 01:42:24,967
AND WHEN YOU DIE,
WHICH IS REGRETTABLE
BUT NECESSARY,

1297
01:42:24,967 --> 01:42:30,472
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO FRAIL ALAIS
AND HER PRUNEY PRINCE ?

1298
01:42:30,472 --> 01:42:35,978
YOU CAN'T THINK
RICHARD'S GOING TO WAIT
FOR YOUR GROTESQUE TO GROW.

1299
01:42:36,478 --> 01:42:39,481
YOU WOULDN'T LET HIM
DO A THING LIKE THAT ?

1300
01:42:39,481 --> 01:42:43,986
LET HIM ?  I'D PUSH HIM
THROUGH THE NURSERY DOOR.

1301
01:42:44,403 --> 01:42:47,489
YOU'RE NOT THAT CRUEL.

1302
01:42:47,489 --> 01:42:51,994
DON'T FRET.  WE'LL WAIT
UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD TO DO IT.

I WOULD HAVE LET
