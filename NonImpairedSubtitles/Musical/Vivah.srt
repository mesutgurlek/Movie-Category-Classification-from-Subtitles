1
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:20,710
Sometimes I pause to ponder upon
the peculiar world of daughters,

2
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,448
from homes they're born into,
reared and raised,

3
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,646
their ties they'll uproot, to
transplant themselves elsewhere

4
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,984
To a home she belongs, she will
estrange herself and..

5
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:35,516
make a stranger's home, her own

6
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,999
The little buds, before our eyes,
will blossom into mothers of mankind

7
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,665
Any daughter's father, be it some
rich man in faraway lands,

8
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,342
or some trader of fruit.. Iike
myself here in Madhupur,

9
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,078
all face similar fate

10
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,275
Raising so lovingly, our daughter,
so beloved..

11
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,149
blessing her every growing
moment and then one day..

12
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,415
..sending her away, forever

13
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,482
All said and done..

14
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,025
daughters will always be daughters,
like my Poonam

15
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,019
I nicknamed her..

16
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,087
Bitto

17
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:19,028
She's the only child of my late
brother. My brother and his wife died,

18
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,101
this unique gift, they left to me

19
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,314
Poonam grew up with
my daughter Chhoti

20
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:35,986
The girls loved each other,
more like siblings

21
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,258
But my wife Rama, she never
took kindly to Poonam,

22
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,929
because in appearance, Poonam
is prettier than Chhoti

23
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,952
In Rama, Poonam always
sought a mother..

24
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,290
but the motherless child would
never find a mother's love

25
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,626
I took Poonam under my wing

26
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,436
Mr Accountant, let her finish
counting, put it right back!

27
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,910
All it took..

28
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,315
was only one loving glance
to make her laugh

29
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,315
And my poems,

30
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,082
she would sing along

31
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,121
We recorded our songs on tape

32
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,457
For the little bridegroom,
and his lovely bride..

33
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,336
a pretty palanquin
is waiting outside

34
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,001
A pretty palanquin,
waiting outside

35
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,409
But my little girl's
always little to me..

36
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,280
..never old enough to marry, you see

37
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,117
She isn't old enough
to marry, you see

38
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,488
She's my bride, I'm
taking her! He says

39
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,026
She's my bride,
I'm taking her now,

40
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,566
Dauntless bridegroom
has sworn a vow

41
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,901
Now it's the daughter's turn to say,

42
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:37,068
Daddy, why are you in a
hurry to send me away?

43
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,237
So what did the daughter
have to say?

44
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:44,443
Daddy, why are you sending me away?

45
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,932
With so much love.. a daughter
cares for her parents..

46
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,060
..her siblings, everyone

47
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:09,541
How dismal are some thoughts of men
who think daughters are burdensome

48
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,479
Both my daughters have come of age..

49
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:27,423
..and it's time to think
of Poonam's wedding

50
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:44,510
Relax! You're in the
world's narrowest lane,

51
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:53,446
and in the middle of the world's
slowest wedding procession. See you..

52
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,194
The world's dullest
rocket, dull-est!

53
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,937
Radhey - Radhey (blessed be
the name of Holy Radha)

54
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,330
Mr Accountant, Radhey Radhey

55
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,205
Radhey Radhey.. Oh.. is
that you, Mr Bhagat?

56
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,673
It's been.. years!

57
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,541
Is Mr Krishnakant at home?
- Yes, welcome

58
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,951
Madhupur remains untouched,
it's just the way I left it,

59
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,353
the same narrow lanes and slow
wedding processions and..

60
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,222
pervasive fear, of shooting rockets.
- So true

61
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,952
Sir..

62
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,963
Yes?

63
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,361
Mr Bhagat is here

64
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,093
Mr Bhagat..!

65
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,903
Bhagat, why did you
take the trouble..

66
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,101
..one call and I would've
been in Delhi

67
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:55,409
When you and your wife can travel to
Delhi to place orders for jewelry,

68
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,314
then why can't I come to Madhupur
to deliver them?

69
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,908
Of course.. thank you

70
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:06,118
When I lived here, amongst you folks,
the time of our lives we had..

71
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,454
you should remind him more often

72
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,052
Sister-in-law, how's the knee?

73
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,595
Improving

74
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,600
A look at the design of these
bangles will heal it

75
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,939
And I know, you've a
keen eye for jewelry

76
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,337
Over years, bit by bit,
jewelry must be bought..

77
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,141
..for the day when daughters marry

78
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:33,208
Giving daughters away in marriage,
is said to be the most sacred act

79
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,877
When a father sees his daughter
standing before him..

80
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,889
..resplendent in bridal finery,

81
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,891
there is a sense of fulfillment

82
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,061
Water

83
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,497
Bless you

84
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,298
Krishnakant, isn't she
Poonam, your Bitto?

85
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,969
Well, you've made her out, you
saw her when she was so little

86
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,171
It was intuition..

87
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:05,441
She's about to graduate in commerce,
she takes care of my accounts

88
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,249
But I've toiled in vain to craft
such exquisite jewelry

89
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,483
She is so beautiful.. who
will look at my jewels!

90
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,262
Chhoti.. Chhoti

91
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,424
Aunty, I'll fetch
her (Aunty.. Aunt)

92
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,345
Sister, what a cool song.. please
join me (Sister.. Sister)

93
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,950
If Aunty comes to know, it's
dancing and not studying,

94
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,388
you know what's to happen?

95
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,086
Nothing, you always save my skin

96
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,629
Get dressed, we've a guest downstairs

97
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:56,901
God! Guests come for Babuji and Maa
makes me do the make-up drill..

98
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,904
and before I'm down,
the guest is gone

99
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,240
You're far better off Sister,
Maa tells you nothing

100
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,179
Sorry Sister.. Maa tells
you nothing at all

101
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,110
You chatter much too much to give
anyone else even a say.. move

102
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,981
Why weren't you ready?

103
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,325
And no face pack even today?

104
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,601
I disapprove of all this..
and stop showing your teeth

105
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,267
In front of the guest, walk properly

106
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,018
Madhupur's rabri, the
world's best rabri!

107
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,620
Krishnakant, I beg
to be excused now

108
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:53,286
Sister-in-law, may both your
girls marry..

109
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,293
..the world's best sons-in-law, soon

110
00:09:55,361 --> 00:10:00,424
You have my best wishes. - Thank
you Uncle, for making Maa smile

111
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:06,163
Rama, time for me
to go to the temple

112
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,030
The sermon is to begin

113
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,504
Uncle (Uncle)

114
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,579
He always forgets

115
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,988
Uncle.. do visit us again

116
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,457
She cares for the smallest
of my needs,

117
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,932
more like a mother

118
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:43,003
Krishnakant, you wondered how
I recognized Poonam. Fact is..

119
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,475
there's much talk in our
social circles about..

120
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,409
..her beauty and her
beautiful nature

121
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,538
You must have received several
proposals for matrimony?

122
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:57,613
Yes, but times are changing,
even values are changing,

123
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,154
good proposals are far too few

124
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:08,028
For Poonam, I seek a home where
her values will be respected

125
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:22,975
Radha and Krishna's light divine
bathes all there is in Universe

126
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,913
Yet devotion inspires, this
worshiper of Love..

127
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:34,255
to light this lamp in
heartfelt prayer

128
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:41,523
O'Krishna and Radha..

129
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:52,003
Krishna and Radha, O'divine come
unto us, bless this home of mine

130
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,444
Please accept our invitation,

131
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:59,416
all we seek is Your love

132
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,454
Krishnakant, I have in mind,
a boy for Poonam..

133
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,684
a nice, handsome boy..
from an excellent family

134
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,961
You've heard of Mr Harishchandra..

135
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,362
..of Harishchandra group
of industries, Delhi?

136
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,298
Who does not know him? He's one
of the luminaries in our society

137
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,965
He has scaled peaks of prosperity,
yet he is firmly rooted in simplicity

138
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,634
He's a very open-minded person

139
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,506
For Poonam..

140
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,914
I'm suggesting Prem, Mr
Harishchandra's younger son

141
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:37,252
I cannot even dream of an alliance
with so high and mighty a family

142
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,449
Are the sons of the high and
mighty to go unmarried?

143
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,194
Which family doesn't need
a good daughter-in-law?

144
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,993
But..
- No excuses

145
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,330
Mr Harishchandra is searching
for a good daughter-in-law

146
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,395
A very good daughter-in-law,
is what I'll suggest to him.

147
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,531
Now, Poonam's photo

148
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,668
Will you give me, or not?
- I'll get it

149
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,541
Look Maa, loads of face
pack. Happy now?

150
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,485
Sister, snap me a photo. I want
to send it to the zoo

151
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,078
Oh come on, Maa

152
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,559
Babuji sends Sister's photo to Delhi,
can't I send mine even to a zoo?

153
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,555
Maa, can I tell Sister about
the Delhi-wallah boy?

154
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,490
I don't like these cheap antics

155
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,572
Who's this guy from Delhi?

156
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,975
Why should I tell?

157
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,982
Babuji.. Babuji (Father)
- Listen!

158
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,911
Stop!

159
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,313
Look..!

160
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,414
Chhoti.. no sparing you!

161
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:51,192
Babuji look! Sister is nagging me..
it's one question again and again

162
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,458
When will the boy say
yes, for marriage!

163
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,061
What! Chhoti!

164
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,130
Come here

165
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,938
Bitto

166
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:13,275
With much hope, Mr Bhagat has
taken your photo to Delhi

167
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:20,125
I was hearing the sermon today and..
I don't know why, but I got a feeling,

168
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,286
this is the family you are
destined to belong to

169
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,978
Hurry up Grandpa, no time!
- Yes, yes sir

170
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,312
Harishchandra

171
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,186
Good day.
- Bhagat, welcome

172
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,325
Marine life, is it?

173
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,922
My grandson's homework project,
what do you think of it?

174
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:04,459
Very likely, the world's best
project.. but why in the morning..?

175
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,437
Getting his homework done, is my job

176
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,000
We spent yesterday watching the
cricket match, so now we suffer

177
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,600
You paste that submarine.

178
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,942
I'll fill in the color, your
teacher will never know

179
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,383
Grand-uncle.. what
color's the sky?

180
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,476
Blue

181
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,612
Grandpa, what're you doing?

182
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,549
Green.. sorry

183
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,153
Grandpa, grow up

184
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,961
My respects, Uncle

185
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,423
God bless.. do you
see the boss of 10,000 men..

186
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,434
..being bossed over by a boy..

187
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,094
and how he obeys!

188
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,233
Grandfather, after all

189
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,364
Rahul, it is time for the bus.
- Here uncle.

190
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,501
Good morning Dad, good
morning everybody

191
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,239
My respects, Uncle.
- Sunil, I wish you happiness

192
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,974
Sorry, I'm late. Got talking
to the lawyers

193
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,415
No problem, join us

194
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,322
Papa, reading newspapers at
the table isn't allowed

195
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,525
Papa, only business news, please.
- For business, you've got all day

196
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,432
Breakfast time is..
- Family time

197
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,129
Thank you

198
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,408
Here you are, son

199
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,141
Bhavna, where's Prem?

200
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,342
He left early, for a squash
game. You forgot, Papa?

201
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,945
Sorry

202
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,886
Uncle, if Papa had it his way..

203
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,289
..he'd have the whole
family around him all day

204
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,495
One minute!

205
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,497
Are you taking off with Rahul to
your mother's for a vacation?

206
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,964
Papa, I'll be back soon

207
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,094
Let ten gents leave home..
you won't know!

208
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,968
But when women and kids are gone,
the whole house sounds empty

209
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,977
Bhavna, I'm sorry, no going
to your mother's this time

210
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,507
Papa.

211
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,981
For this permanent problem of
the world, I got a solution

212
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,050
You get to go to your mother's
and the house won't sound empty

213
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,246
How..?

214
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,913
Bring home a junior daughter-in-law

215
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,453
I have..

216
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,518
found a bride for Prem

217
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,011
Ya Prem, that's the shot

218
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,955
Be right back

219
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,084
Bali, looks like you'll lose again

220
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,559
Now's your chance to escape.
Run along. - Shut up

221
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,097
Today I'll win

222
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,574
Sorry guys. Papa wants me in office
and it's urgent, so I'll have to go

223
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,235
At least finish the game

224
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,243
You win

225
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,178
Good morning, sir

226
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,519
I'll tell the marketing department
to get in touch with you later..

227
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:17,324
Hey Aunt Maria, grab a bite?
- No! I'm so very happy,

228
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,365
I'm going to fast all
day! Go.. go.. go..

229
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,457
Your daddy is waiting for you

230
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,478
Come in, son

231
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,088
That's okay.

232
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,163
The rest is not so important.
You talk to him. Talk to him.

233
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:06,305
Papa, why is everyone beaming at me
? I didn't even win my game today

234
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:11,447
It's all because there's a
wedding proposal for you

235
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,513
You mean, marriage?

236
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,414
Your education is completed,
now it's time..

237
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,323
..for us to think about
your marriage

238
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,398
Mr Bhagat came home today

239
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,994
He suggests there's a girl
for you, her name is Poonam

240
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:37,431
Poonam's parents are deceased, she
was raised very lovingly by her uncle

241
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:44,413
They live in Madhupur. Mr Bhagat says
they are very decent, honest folks

242
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,278
If I've your yes, then next Sunday..

243
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,287
..we may go to Madhupur
to meet the girl

244
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:03,365
If there is someone else you like,
you may speak openly, son

245
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,972
No Papa, there's nothing of the sort

246
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,966
Only thing is.. marrying, so early?

247
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:17,506
Now is the right age, son. Even
your brother married at your age

248
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,485
Our scriptures say so, also
from my experience..

249
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:28,583
it's easier to accept someone, easier
to adapt to someone at an early age

250
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,391
It makes for a relationship that
grows more firm, takes deeper root

251
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:37,060
Papa.. I haven't even
started upon my career

252
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,927
I'm just a trainee in the factory

253
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:46,409
Prem, every man who aspires to
achieve needs an inspiration

254
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,947
She will come into your life
like an inspiration..

255
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:59,416
to share every moment of your life, to
bear half the burden of your sorrows

256
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,452
And to double your joys

257
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,693
You might think, why a girl from
a small town.. Madhupur?

258
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:15,099
Your mother was also from
a small town near Bhopal

259
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,166
Now who could have been
a better mother to you?

260
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:29,577
We lived life to the fullest, traveled
the world, watched you boys grow up

261
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,913
To this day, she is besides me

262
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,123
Nowadays when I see youngsters losing
faith in the institution of marriage,

263
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,995
I feel so sorry

264
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,429
Your mother always maintained..

265
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:48,201
the most vital components of a
marriage are trust and honesty

266
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:53,070
Children nowadays miss
the significance

267
00:21:55,013 --> 00:22:01,441
Prem, I've always tried to be in
step with you, your generation,

268
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:09,617
to speak the language you speak, your
kind of fashion, music, movies

269
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,423
Now I want, you too should imbibe
certain values from earlier generations

270
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:25,042
Meet the girl, speak with her, find
out if you can understand each other

271
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,976
Then, take the decision

272
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,440
And now,

273
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,908
Poonam's photo

274
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,179
Take a look

275
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,448
I'll wait outside

276
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,426
Guess what Prem, Bhagat
Uncle told me..

277
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:23,366
when Papa spoke about marriage
to him, he had blushed crimson

278
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,967
Well?

279
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:30,900
The wife's presence is always taken
for granted, but for once at least,

280
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,241
put that paper away and give
your brother some advice

281
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,179
The first time he came to see
me, he came all prepared..

282
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,245
after memorizing a whole questionnaire

283
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,988
Brother..

284
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,924
what was the first question you
asked? - The first question?

285
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:54,395
May I have a glass of water, please
? That was the first-and-last

286
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,660
Uncle, she's the one
you're marrying?

287
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,338
Will she give you good-night kisses,
like Mummy gives Papa?

288
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,946
Naughty!
- He's always talking his head off

289
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,107
You got to be careful what you
say in front of this guy

290
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,616
Rahul, bedtime.
- Good night

291
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,210
You're becoming mischievous

292
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,012
Papa.. paper..

293
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,959
It's yesterday's paper. Put it down!

294
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,427
No, I was only..

295
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,965
Come

296
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:33,898
More about Poonam? I'm
told she likes to read

297
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,639
In their house, girls never
wear jeans, dresses, etc

298
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:44,443
They never go to restaurants. Oh yes,
you may have to speak in chaste Hindi

299
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,319
I like Poonam

300
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,324
When I meet her, what will I talk?

301
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:01,055
Not to worry, the poor girl
must be in the same quandary

302
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:38,235
Unacquainted, as strangers,

303
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,899
we try to find rapport,

304
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:48,309
but there's a question in the heart

305
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,440
Oh, what are we going to talk

306
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:59,320
Oh, what are we going to talk

307
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:06,262
New hopes, new joy,

308
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,433
a strange fragrance fills the air..

309
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:16,065
with the coming of someone for whom
I have waited with all my heart

310
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,269
Oh, what are we going to talk!

311
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:27,477
Oh, what are we going to talk

312
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,554
Krishnakant basically
belongs to Som Sarovar

313
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:44,227
Som Sarovar, where grapes grow?
- Exactly

314
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:49,897
Sister-in-law hails from Bhopal.
- My in-laws are also from near Bhopal

315
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,238
Please.. have some.
- You should sit here

316
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,437
And talk to Prem

317
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,372
Please sit.

318
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,251
What's this restlessness..

319
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:07,451
I feel today?

320
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,925
The way I feel today..

321
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:16,525
never was I in this
state of mind before

322
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:21,531
Eyes looking out.. for her alone

323
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:26,270
This beauty is for him alone

324
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:30,940
The one I pictured,

325
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,877
I'm about to see

326
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:44,426
The storm is turning into a tempest.
Oh, what are we going to talk

327
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:52,232
Oh, what are we going to talk

328
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:34,876
Like an icon of beauty
descended from skies,

329
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,081
has she come only for me,

330
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,880
in such splendor?

331
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:49,155
I know he's hiding his looks..

332
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:53,492
stealing furtive glances only at me

333
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:58,901
Unspoken words upon my frozen lips

334
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,169
Did my heart miss a beat?

335
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:12,042
Tomorrow's lovers, what are
they going to talk today?

336
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:19,520
Oh, what are we going to talk

337
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,054
Meet Poonam, say hello

338
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,993
Say hello to Aunt.. say hello!

339
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,999
Hello

340
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,330
Hello..

341
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:50,147
Krishnakant, we have met Poonam.
Now with your permission..

342
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,952
Iet Prem and Poonam talk to each other
to get to know each other's minds

343
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,483
Bhavna, please

344
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,222
Have we come to sit on the swing?
- No!

345
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,234
We've come to talk.
- We couldn't talk downstairs?

346
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,166
Your Uncle and aunt want to talk
here. - Then what are we doing here?

347
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,139
Rahul! No more questions

348
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,510
Hi, I'm Prem. - My name's Rajni,
you can call me Chhoti

349
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:21,245
If the two of you get going,
then I'm your sister-in-law

350
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,311
Please..

351
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,588
Sit, Poonam.
- Please sit

352
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,524
Sister-in-law, sit.
- You sit

353
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,062
Why is no one sitting?

354
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,264
Chhoti, we're being formal
and crowding..

355
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,325
..over the ones who want privacy

356
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,997
So put down the tea tray and let's go

357
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:45,668
Okay Prem, Poonam. All the best.
- They got exams?

358
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,687
I'm not too sure that I know what
we should be talking right now

359
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:11,033
We're meant to take a decision about
the next step in our lives

360
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:20,635
But before we have discussed our past,
how can we think about our future?

361
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:28,176
Schooling and college in Delhi ; then
for about a year, I went abroad

362
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,252
Studied journalism, literature..

363
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,519
basically, trying to discover myself

364
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:42,055
My brother says, I'm too emotional
.. in business matters

365
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,262
He calls me Bholu, a Simple Simon

366
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,004
In college, I took a
liking for a girl..

367
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:56,275
my classmate.. used to sit
on the desk in front of me

368
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:02,214
Several times, I felt like making
conversation, but I never had the guts

369
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,954
And it was just as well,
later I found out..

370
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,424
she had two boyfriends already

371
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,954
I even tried smoking, with friends

372
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,967
But when Sister-in-law
caught me smoking..

373
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,302
..I promised her never
to smoke or drink

374
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,175
I have never spoken of these
things even with my Papa.

375
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,238
But, I don't know why,

376
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,444
I felt I had to tell you

377
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:45,394
I'm told you like reading.. which
books are your favorites?

378
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,330
Saratchandra's Parineeta, Swami

379
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,267
Rabindranath's Atithi, Samapti

380
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,475
All in Hindi, right?

381
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,444
Their English translations
are excellent too

382
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:10,348
Do you also read spiritual
books? I mean..

383
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,283
The divine..?

384
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,951
Yes.. you read them?

385
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:24,093
Do you believe in prayer? I mean,
you trust, He'll give what you seek?

386
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,960
Do you believe in it?

387
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,440
Some things one has total faith in

388
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,040
You can ask me whatever you wish

389
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:46,045
The tea has gone cold. Another
cup..? - No, thanks

390
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,534
You have no question at all?

391
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,132
About that girl, maybe?

392
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,407
I've all the answers

393
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,478
If you wish, we can meet again,
once or twice..?

394
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,424
Well then, shall we..?

395
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,374
So?

396
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,042
Oh.. so..

397
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,311
Is that a yes?

398
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,982
I think.. - It's on your face,
Bholu, it's a yes

399
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,346
Sister-in-law..

400
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,323
Listen.. one second! Listen..

401
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:59,460
I think we should meet again,
once or twice, for her sake

402
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,921
How chivalrous!

403
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,200
Papa.. yes

404
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,465
Really?

405
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,467
Where's Prem?

406
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,341
Congratulations!
- Thanks

407
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,151
Harishchandra, my compliments

408
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,888
Please be seated

409
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,157
Krishnakant, from
our side, it's a yes

410
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:38,501
Please ask Poonam as well
and if she says yes,

411
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,970
then at the earliest, I want
her as my daughter-in-law

412
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,967
Bitto, Chhoti.. from
their side it's a yes

413
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:52,981
Bitto, what's your decision?
- Babuji, it's a yes

414
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,519
You asked whatever you
wanted to find out?

415
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,256
You want to meet him again,
once or twice?

416
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,390
Sister was saying, he's
just like you, Babuji

417
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,332
Silly girl

418
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,547
Harishchandra.. please..
- Thank you

419
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,014
You will sit too

420
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,221
Where is your sherbet?
- I'll help myself

421
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,354
Sir, Sister-in-law wants to see you

422
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,490
Excuse me..

423
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,426
Yes?

424
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:49,166
They have come prepared, they want
the engagement done today!

425
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,910
Before committing an alliance with
so rich a family, talk about dowry

426
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:58,447
I won't let you squander all we have,
our daughter is yet to marry

427
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,451
Really Rama, sometimes
you exceed the limits

428
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,320
Krishnakant, may I come in?

429
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,514
Harishchandra..?

430
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,052
Come in, do come..

431
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,519
I beg your pardon for the intrusion,

432
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,930
but now that two families
are uniting..

433
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,196
..I'd prefer we kept nothing
from each other

434
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,131
Please, have no doubts

435
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,006
Give Prem a token of one rupee and a
coconut..

436
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,009
..and accept him into your family

437
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,002
We want Poonam and nothing else

438
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,105
The world's best couple

439
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:03,442
Aunt, smile.
- Not Aunt. Call her Aunty

440
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,109
How did this Aunt become my Aunty?

441
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,382
Your Uncle likes her
so much, what to do?

442
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,118
Kindly let it come.. that's it

443
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,920
Papa, the cars are waiting..
- Sure.. Iet's go

444
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,394
For you

445
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,595
Chocolates?
- Yes

446
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,097
Aunty, coming to Delhi?

447
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,103
Aunty will come later

448
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,866
My respects, Uncle.
- Bless you

449
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,880
Bless you, Bhavna

450
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,209
Just call me Bhavna

451
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,010
Ah, the littlest one in the family!

452
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,553
You and I haven't even gotten talking

453
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,625
Harishchandra, a little request

454
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:58,230
If all of you may spare a few days
to visit us in Som Sarovar,

455
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:02,962
we have a little house there ; a few
days together, would be very nice

456
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,033
Whenever you wish, Krishnakant. We're
looking for excuses to meet Poonam,

457
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,577
what with the astrologer fixing
a marriage date after six months

458
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,181
Sister-in-law, give the
astrologer a nice meal..

459
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,187
..ask him to fix a nearer date

460
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,326
Then.. Som Sarovar next month?
- Hundred percent

461
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,192
Good night.
- Good night

462
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:29,460
You aren't one of the brides people,
you're coming with us

463
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,936
Oh, I forgot!
- You'll accompany the bridegroom

464
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,939
Correct!
- Bhagat will be here with us,

465
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,272
to welcome the bridegroom.
- That's also correct

466
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,107
How can both be correct?

467
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,946
The way it is, I've an invitation
from either side..

468
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,007
..so there's no stopping me

469
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,549
Bridegroom arrives,
I'm here to welcome him.

470
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,555
Bride leaves, I'll escort her

471
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:56,957
Correct proposition? - Likely..
but, are you ditching us?

472
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:58,961
Sister, one minute!

473
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,462
What is it?
- Just come

474
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,623
Chhoti.. the guests are leaving

475
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,100
Hush

476
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,631
Jija, now you owe me one
( Jija : Brother-in-law)

477
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,017
Krishnakant Villa Som Sarovar

478
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,957
Yes Harishchandra, we
have reached Som Sarovar

479
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,962
When can we expect you?

480
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:16,964
Oh.. take left
from the bus depot.

481
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,441
Metaled roads,
it's a comfortable drive

482
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,635
Okay.

483
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,576
We're waiting for you

484
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,107
You're welcome

485
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,393
Bless you

486
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:49,096
How would the weather be in Som
Sarovar? (He speaks in chaste Hindi)

487
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,534
Bravo!

488
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,102
Already talking Poonam-style?

489
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,471
Oh Sister!

490
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,140
Sister come quickly, they're here

491
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,963
Oh Sister,

492
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,567
how will you address him,

493
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:23,164
the one who'll come to marry you?

494
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,365
Oh Sister,

495
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:29,902
how will you address him,

496
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,416
the one who'll come to marry you?

497
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,511
Coy words are out of question..

498
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:42,923
I will use sign language..

499
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:46,588
Coy words are out of question..

500
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:51,129
I will use sign language..

501
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,260
Unlike others,

502
00:42:53,337 --> 00:43:01,608
our communication will be special

503
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,543
80 kilometers to journey's end?
(He speaks in chaste Hindi)

504
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,300
Marriage is like the
'laddoo' from Delhi

505
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,067
All want to taste it

506
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:38,044
Every facet of it is lovely

507
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:41,910
If you marry, you suffer

508
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,983
If you don't, you suffer

509
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:50,521
Might as well marry and suffer

510
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,927
This 'laddoo' you will get too,

511
00:43:53,998 --> 00:44:02,269
the day someone will come for you

512
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,936
Everyone's invited to Som Sarovar
! Holidaying together..

513
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:13,211
and I get to do the chores

514
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,420
Why are you getting agitated
? I'll make the sweets

515
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,956
You relax

516
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:08,331
Is it a song or an act?

517
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:12,533
To take your mind off things?

518
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,605
Your eyes are upon the street

519
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,411
Oh Chhoti, you're too naughty,

520
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:25,119
stop being such a tease

521
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:29,415
I'm only busy watering

522
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:39,562
Let Jija arrive, I'll tell him
all about your state of mind

523
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,224
Bitto, come

524
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,898
Water

525
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,297
Krishnakant, remain seated

526
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,363
Put the tray down

527
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:52,570
We'll help ourselves. We haven't
come here as guests

528
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,377
Son, drink

529
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,910
Water

530
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,930
When you have a cold,

531
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,533
you ought not to drink iced water

532
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,877
Come..
- How nice

533
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,216
Dinner

534
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,359
Come son

535
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,028
Our little family member, you too!

536
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:53,034
Wow Grandpa, little-little
dining tables?

537
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:55,037
For you, a special little one

538
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,164
Come. Come.

539
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,299
Sit

540
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,570
Please serve him his special dish

541
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,242
I'll serve them

542
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,981
Papa, Aunty is a fantastic cook

543
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,988
The garnishing proportions are on
her fingertips, I was stunned

544
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,918
Sister-in-law, he is a lucky man

545
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,059
Sunil Babu, no more helpings?

546
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,129
I'm doing fine

547
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:30,532
He's missing his evening newspaper!

548
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:37,279
Poonam has cooked the curry today.
- Really?

549
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,144
Please, may I have some more?

550
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,275
Uncle, for your sake, Sister
used very little chili

551
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:46,345
She cooks a spicy spread.
- Good good

552
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,222
No, thanks

553
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,501
Poonam, I've told Krishnakant, you
may continue your studies in Delhi

554
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,247
Afterwards, if you wish, you
can attend our offices

555
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,376
Until Rahul was born, Bhavna
went to the office everyday

556
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,047
I think girls prove
better administrators

557
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,054
What!

558
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:30,932
Krishnakant, I heard.. you aren't
staying with us tonight?

559
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:35,402
We'll use the quarters, nearby. You
won't find it inconvenient here

560
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:40,671
Papa, it's just so that we can have
all the three big rooms to ourselves

561
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,140
No, not really

562
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,280
Beddings in place, make it quick

563
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,951
Grandpa, I'll sleep here.
- Right on

564
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,284
Prem, get more mattresses.
- Yes, Papa

565
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,950
You see, I can manage..
- Rahul, make him to sit down

566
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,287
No, please hear me out.
- Be seated

567
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,017
Everyone listen

568
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,456
Gents sleep in this room,
the ladies in there

569
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,126
Prem put mine right next to his,
I'll lecture him all night

570
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,362
Sit

571
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:11,100
Oh no, lights out?
- Up again? Sit down, Krishnakant

572
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,515
Can l.. carry some?

573
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,201
Every morning, my uncle drinks
water from the copper tumbler..

574
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,472
..it's good for health

575
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:55,414
That must be your aunt's book?
- Yes

576
00:50:58,121 --> 00:50:59,281
Thank you

577
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,285
What for?

578
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,554
Aren't your uncle and
aunt.. mine too?

579
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,637
For you.. a gift

580
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,252
Can we meet tomorrow?

581
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,927
If you say so..
Sister-in-law can arrange it

582
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:14,154
Nothing like a morning walk, much
to gain out of little effort

583
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:18,964
Like big profits out of small
capital, your knee pain will vanish

584
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,501
Boys, faster please

585
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,973
What's the matter?
- You carry on

586
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,976
He'll be here in a minute.. see!

587
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:36,982
What about our meeting?

588
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,311
What's the hurry?

589
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,322
Until then, take some exercise

590
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:57,472
It's the vegetable market area,
so shops open early

591
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:03,603
A smell of freshly-cooked jalebis!
- Milk and jalebis for breakfast?

592
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:11,076
Steaming hot jalebis.
- Sit here

593
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:14,954
Two minutes.. Jalebis in milk.
- Are you serving us again!

594
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,085
Sit!
- Great taste, try it

595
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,971
Sister-in-law, get him to talk to Papa
(Sister-in-law : sister-in-law)

596
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,071
Go

597
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,308
Bhavna?
- Go!

598
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,108
Have some more, Rama.
- Don't plead with her, feed her

599
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,415
Dad?
- Yes?

600
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:49,583
What's our day's plan?
- We're seeing the vineyards

601
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:53,418
Children, if you haven't seen the
vineyards here, you've seen nothing

602
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,125
So, like I was saying..
- Dad..

603
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,999
Yes?
- Rahul wanted to see the lake

604
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:03,399
What lake?

605
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,074
Can we go?

606
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,410
Rahul wants to go? Then go

607
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,276
Aunty, can we take Poonam
and Chhoti along?

608
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:16,410
Sure

609
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:19,011
Wonderful! He worked a miracle!

610
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,283
Too good.

611
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,619
Sister-in-law, can you believe it,
my brother did it!

612
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:29,892
Snatch the newspaper out of his hands
and in Uncle Bhagat's words..

613
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,030
he's the world's best husband

614
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,174
No.. the other one

615
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,241
This one

616
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,386
It's lovely watching them
together, like this

617
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:58,255
He's so busy at work, he
hardly has time for her

618
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:04,090
Out here, they're having a lovely
holiday.. thanks to you

619
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,201
Did you like the gift?
- Very much

620
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,942
Sister-in-law and I scoured
the malls for a whole day..

621
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,480
..till we found the necklace

622
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,678
You haven't worn it?

623
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,948
May I wear it after the wedding?

624
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:38,023
In Madhupur, we live simply

625
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:43,369
Wearing such an expensive gift there,
I'd feel a little uncomfortable

626
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:47,306
No, it's okay. I understand

627
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:21,001
Poonam, you just spoke your heart
and you said it so frankly,

628
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,407
it felt wonderful

629
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:29,009
Maybe it's this honesty, that's to be
the cornerstone of our relationship

630
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:38,293
With the same honesty, if I were
to give you another gift,

631
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,430
and if you think it's right..

632
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:44,900
..will you wear it?

633
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:54,239
Turning defeat into victory..

634
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:59,178
With great honesty..

635
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:05,984
Love has cast it's effect..

636
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:10,116
On the heart..

637
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,053
Today there is no question of..

638
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:21,129
Any denial..

639
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:27,008
if not diamonds,

640
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:33,213
a simplicity of flowers
has adorned her beauty

641
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:56,964
So little said, so much remains ;

642
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:03,103
a little shower, I wait for rains,

643
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:08,309
to dance like a peacock in rain,
my heart yearns..

644
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:13,912
to dance like a peacock in rain,
my heart yearns..

645
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:19,656
a little wait.. that's it..

646
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:26,196
a little wait.. that's it

647
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:32,003
So little said, so much remains ;

648
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:37,877
a little shower, I wait for rains,

649
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,275
Prem, spot

650
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,478
Prem, hit her! Or, they'll win

651
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,876
Hit

652
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,881
Get her.. why don't
you take her out?

653
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:54,558
a little wait.. that's it

654
00:58:54,898 --> 00:59:01,428
a little wait.. that's it

655
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,923
This is sheer bliss. It'd
do good for Poonam..

656
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,459
..and Prem to visit all the temples

657
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:42,537
Radha-Krishna must've met
in these valleys, somewhere

658
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:48,278
The fragrance of their romance
still lurks in the air

659
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,945
In divine presence,
we find ourselves..

660
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,217
drawn nearer..

661
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,952
In divine presence,
we find ourselves..

662
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,961
drawn nearer..

663
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:05,365
A heart's exchange done, I've
still to shower so many gifts

664
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:11,374
A little shower, I wait for rains

665
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:16,435
Everyone seems to be helping our union

666
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:22,250
Everyone seems to be helping our union

667
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:28,119
A little wait.. that's it

668
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:34,926
A little wait.. that's it

669
01:00:58,421 --> 01:00:59,547
Bhavna..

670
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,551
Bhavna, what are you up to?
- What's up?

671
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,092
Look what's there!
- What?

672
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,638
Don't worry, I came for the towel

673
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:39,190
Enchanting waterfalls' lovelores..

674
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:44,994
entice me into sweet
dreams of tomorrows..

675
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:50,529
awakening for the first time,
new stirrings within me

676
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:56,272
I feel new emotions stirring within

677
01:01:56,345 --> 01:02:02,011
A lifetime of our days
and nights remain,

678
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:08,079
a little shower, I wait for rains

679
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:13,228
I can feel the tug of monsoon winds

680
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:18,966
I can feel the tug of monsoon
winds upon my heartstrings

681
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:36,316
A little wait.. that's it

682
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:44,918
A little wait.. that's it

683
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:50,328
Yes, Zurich called? What
did they have to say?

684
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:53,660
Really? Meeting confirmed?

685
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,463
No, no.. that's good news

686
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:02,444
Get the legal department
to draw up the contracts.

687
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,412
We'll be in Delhi tomorrow

688
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,940
But the Swiss clients
are due next week?

689
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,412
Now they're expected
day after tomorrow

690
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:15,422
And our entire board must be present
during the signing of the contract

691
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,423
So, we leave tomorrow

692
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:40,447
Time has passed by so quickly..

693
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,316
Should I say something Poonam,

694
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:54,258
this spell between engagement
and marriage is amazing

695
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,259
These moments between you and..

696
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,131
..Prem will be the most
memorable of your lives,

697
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:01,935
mark my words

698
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,694
Hey Rahul, come here

699
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,091
Aunty..

700
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,890
Uncle wants water

701
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,432
You wanted to say something?

702
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:19,080
Poonam, tonight.. after dinner..

703
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,951
for a while.. will you
come to the terrace?

704
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:36,493
If you think, it's right.. only then

705
01:05:55,918 --> 01:06:00,514
Wow! Well done Sister-in-law.
- You are winning all the games.

706
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,515
Can I sleep on the terrace
with Uncle?

707
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,395
We leave early tomorrow, don't forget

708
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:11,264
Chhoti, where's the saffroned milk?
- Sister is bringing it

709
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,881
Wish I could read..

710
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,425
the language of her eyes

711
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:43,226
My heart falters..

712
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:46,233
in doubts of hope and despair

713
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,960
Worse, this menacing..

714
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:54,499
solitude, my love

715
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:02,915
Patience..

716
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:07,249
comes, she comes

717
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:12,927
She could not stop herself..

718
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:15,930
from coming

719
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:20,435
Your coming..

720
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:25,099
is like the waking of Moons, my love

721
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:34,144
We laced the milk with saffron for
dessert.. I thought you might like it

722
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,954
It gets chilly here, in the nights

723
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:47,351
For once I thought, you wouldn't come

724
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:52,967
Everyone was sitting together,
talking, I just couldn't leave

725
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,371
No one knows that you've come here?

726
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:04,904
Chhoti knows, she told everyone
that I've gone off to sleep

727
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:14,387
If someone finds out you
aren't there.. then?

728
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:22,931
Chhoti has propped up pillows
and thrown a blanket over them

729
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:29,936
All this.. just because
I asked you to come?

730
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:37,878
I wanted to come

731
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,625
Why did I take so long to
realize this, Poonam?

732
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:59,493
I even missed seeing.. you've worn
that necklace for me tonight

733
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,457
Do you know Poonam,

734
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:34,398
since I came to Som Sarovar, I've been
wanting to call you to the terrace

735
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,536
But every time, I held back

736
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,447
I wish I'd known that I had
the right to call you anytime

737
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,418
But what a time to come to know,

738
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:54,945
when it's time..

739
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,354
to go

740
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,035
Poonam, people spend lifetimes
looking for love

741
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:19,170
Today, I look in wonderment
at this custom of marriage..

742
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,975
in which, that love has
come to me, as a gift

743
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:29,056
Suddenly I become so
special to someone,

744
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:33,928
what I eat, what I wear, suddenly
is more important..

745
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,432
to somebody else than me, myself.
Suddenly you and l..

746
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,940
I have the right..

747
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:56,349
to this liberty of beholding your
beauty to my heart's content,

748
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:03,683
of gazing upon you, in endless love

749
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:07,359
My love..

750
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:11,431
My love..

751
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:17,166
my heart calls out in answer..

752
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,703
You have the right

753
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:24,475
You have the right

754
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:29,245
You have the right

755
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:59,171
Darkening, melting, the night
is slowly deepening..

756
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:06,416
giving in to love's music ;
a romance, slowly blossoming

757
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:13,291
In the music of my bangles,
what is the lyric, my love?

758
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:20,028
What message does the language
of my bangles speak?

759
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:23,560
To keep you awake all night,

760
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,574
I have the right

761
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:31,037
to steal upon your beauty,

762
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:34,241
I have the right

763
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:37,410
My love..

764
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:41,318
My love..

765
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:47,329
my heart calls out in answer

766
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:50,921
You have the right

767
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,536
You have the right

768
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:59,269
You have the right

769
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:03,068
Poonam, how do you come to know
these smallest things about me?

770
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:05,538
How did you find out about my cold?

771
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:09,346
Whenever you get a cold,
you do this..

772
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:11,612
How?

773
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,121
Do it again

774
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:36,304
Tomorrow time will distance us,

775
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:43,511
but not for a moment, shall
I be able to forget you

776
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:53,918
Your face, your smile,

777
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:58,933
in memories of your beautiful face,
your endearing smile..

778
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:04,268
to suffer in your absence,
I have the right

779
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:11,607
To yearn to meet you, I have the right

780
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,138
My love..

781
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,944
My love..

782
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:24,960
my heart calls out in answer..

783
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:28,153
you have the right

784
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:31,965
You have the right

785
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:36,500
You have the right

786
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:42,510
I have the right

787
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:50,450
You have the right

788
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:17,276
Rahul, quickly get inside the car

789
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,444
Got to leave..

790
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,233
Five months on, there'll be no need
to make excuses about water

791
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:50,240
4 months, 2 weeks and 2 days,
our wedding's that far away

792
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:53,372
Until then, I cannot ask you to
keep this mobile phone to talk up,

793
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,406
because you'll consider it improper

794
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,083
All-day-chat on the net is out,

795
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:05,320
so like nice boys do, I'll write
you a bunch of letters

796
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:08,386
And yes, I'll dial you up on
your ancestral black phone

797
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:18,939
Listen,

798
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:26,205
stay away from anything icy. You
just got over a nasty cold

799
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:32,383
Not even cold water

800
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,219
Anything else?

801
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:08,055
Prem, hurry. We'll get late

802
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:15,257
My love..

803
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:19,429
My love..

804
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:29,207
my heart calls out to you..

805
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:33,336
I have the right

806
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:37,879
I have the right

807
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:43,356
I have the right

808
01:18:12,346 --> 01:18:13,506
Good morning, Aunt Maria

809
01:18:14,281 --> 01:18:17,182
Congratulations Prem, you've
been given a promotion,

810
01:18:17,251 --> 01:18:21,017
from factory to office.
- Thank you and look what I've got..

811
01:18:21,088 --> 01:18:25,752
only for you.. from Som Sarovar,
delicious and wholesome grapes

812
01:18:26,093 --> 01:18:30,689
A simple gift, I hope you will accept
accept and.. (ln chaste Hindi)

813
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:36,659
Not to get stuck, Hindi
is a very kind language,

814
01:18:36,737 --> 01:18:39,433
you're free to use words
from any other language

815
01:18:40,574 --> 01:18:43,372
Accept and please oblige.
- Thank you

816
01:18:43,443 --> 01:18:46,674
That's the way Prem, first in
the office, sharp at 9 am

817
01:18:47,114 --> 01:18:50,572
Engaged to marry, now work, only work

818
01:18:51,552 --> 01:18:53,349
Concentrate, focus

819
01:19:06,466 --> 01:19:09,594
Munim, let's start making preparations
for the wedding right away

820
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:14,334
Go to Mr Joshi, talk to
the tent-makers. - Sure

821
01:19:14,408 --> 01:19:18,105
We'll put up the bridegroom's party in
Bansilal's hotel, not at Temple-lnn

822
01:19:18,178 --> 01:19:20,078
Birju, this task is yours.
- Done

823
01:19:20,147 --> 01:19:22,172
Look, we should leave nothing undone

824
01:19:22,249 --> 01:19:26,083
And Bitto, compile the list of
invitees on the computer, quickly

825
01:19:26,153 --> 01:19:30,089
The job of painting the house
should be done in time

826
01:19:31,258 --> 01:19:33,624
Not in a marriage-hall.. we're
having the wedding at home

827
01:19:33,694 --> 01:19:37,095
They're coming from Delhi.
- We'll do a good job

828
01:19:37,164 --> 01:19:38,392
Take a look around

829
01:19:46,673 --> 01:19:50,507
Back from college?
I was waiting for you

830
01:19:51,378 --> 01:19:54,541
Of these silver coins,
which looks nice?..

831
01:19:54,615 --> 01:19:57,743
.. I want to give every
guest a memento

832
01:19:59,653 --> 01:20:01,712
I know Sister's choice. This one

833
01:20:04,424 --> 01:20:06,289
Great! It's my choice too

834
01:20:08,128 --> 01:20:09,527
You too make a choice, Rama

835
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:13,396
Why do you even have to ask
me, give everything away

836
01:20:17,571 --> 01:20:21,530
Maa, why do you always talk like that
? Babuji only wants your opinion

837
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,735
Don't you dare talk back at me

838
01:20:33,654 --> 01:20:36,714
Bitto.. get along with
what you got to do

839
01:20:42,162 --> 01:20:46,030
The kind of wedding you're dreaming
of, do you know what it'll cost?

840
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,362
Yes, I know

841
01:20:48,435 --> 01:20:52,428
Relatives we haven't seen
in years, are being invited

842
01:20:52,506 --> 01:20:55,771
Confectioners, musicians, florists,
being called in from all over,

843
01:20:56,109 --> 01:20:59,340
Iike you've nothing to look
at beyond this wedding

844
01:20:59,413 --> 01:21:01,779
My brother and his wife's
every dream will come true

845
01:21:03,116 --> 01:21:05,744
You remember only their dreams

846
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:08,314
Do you remember, even your daughter
is waiting to get married?

847
01:21:11,391 --> 01:21:13,086
I've spoken about Chhoti
to so many people

848
01:21:14,628 --> 01:21:16,687
But because she is dark,
I find no suitors

849
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:21,165
Worse now, if we can't provide for
her dowry, then she's had it

850
01:21:22,235 --> 01:21:23,702
But why would you worry for that?

851
01:21:24,071 --> 01:21:26,665
To pay for Poonam's wedding you
pawned off our Som Sarovar house

852
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:28,640
Now, sell even this
house if you will!

853
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,190
Who is it?

854
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,360
Bitto?

855
01:21:58,271 --> 01:21:59,397
What happened, my child?

856
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:01,766
I don't want to marry

857
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:05,405
Bitto.. what are you saying?

858
01:22:06,513 --> 01:22:08,344
Come and sit here

859
01:22:08,415 --> 01:22:10,542
Sit.. what's the matter?

860
01:22:12,252 --> 01:22:13,378
Uncle..

861
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,481
Uncle..

862
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:22,392
..you built brick by brick..
the house in Som Sarovar

863
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:28,432
And you have mortgaged
it for this wedding?

864
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:35,064
Chhoti is yet to marry! I'll
never be able to forgive myself

865
01:22:38,311 --> 01:22:44,147
Chhoti will have just as fine a
wedding.. I give you my word

866
01:22:47,287 --> 01:22:50,017
For every father, a daughter's
wedding is..

867
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,115
.. a celebration of a
great wish come true

868
01:22:53,593 --> 01:22:55,458
Will you not let my wish come true?

869
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:03,536
Listen.. a letter from
Harishchandra has arrived

870
01:23:04,371 --> 01:23:05,633
You want to hear it?

871
01:23:07,207 --> 01:23:08,367
One second

872
01:23:12,979 --> 01:23:14,105
He writes,

873
01:23:16,049 --> 01:23:19,109
With great pleasure, I remember
staying with you at Som Sarovar

874
01:23:20,387 --> 01:23:24,050
In Madhupur, we became related. In
Som Sarovar, we struck a friendship

875
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,251
In terms of relationships,
such a quick promotion

876
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:31,192
All credit goes to your
endearing nature

877
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:34,990
Having known you, I can
tell with conviction,

878
01:23:35,068 --> 01:23:37,696
that you have already embarked upon
the preparations for the wedding

879
01:23:39,406 --> 01:23:41,704
A thousand responsibilities entail
in a daughter's wedding

880
01:23:43,076 --> 01:23:46,739
Have no worries of any sort,
we are one family

881
01:23:49,249 --> 01:23:54,209
Bitto, when you have such a fine
father-in-law, what's my worry?

882
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:59,522
Now, one little smile

883
01:24:01,695 --> 01:24:03,287
I have good news for you

884
01:24:04,598 --> 01:24:08,557
In today's mail, perhaps..
there's a letter for you

885
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:17,132
Bitto, someone far away.. is
waiting for you, weaving dreams

886
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:20,571
Go on.. fill in the colors

887
01:24:40,267 --> 01:24:43,134
It's four in the morning
and I've no sleep

888
01:24:45,305 --> 01:24:46,704
I reach the office
before anyone else

889
01:24:48,408 --> 01:24:50,672
But it's another matter that
I am not able to do any work

890
01:24:53,647 --> 01:24:55,012
But today, I put in
lots of hard work,..

891
01:24:55,081 --> 01:24:58,573
.. matching color schemes
for each costume..

892
01:24:58,652 --> 01:25:04,682
we'll wear for our wedding ceremonies
the soiree, reception, dinners

893
01:25:06,593 --> 01:25:08,652
I had coffees after
coffee to stay fresh

894
01:25:09,629 --> 01:25:12,530
But the only things that remain
fresh, are memories of you

895
01:25:13,033 --> 01:25:16,628
Poonam, I can't tell the
source of this enthusiasm,

896
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:19,971
but I'm propelled to
achieve in life,..

897
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,702
.. to prove myself worthy,
for your sake

898
01:25:32,152 --> 01:25:33,380
Coming, coming

899
01:25:40,293 --> 01:25:42,090
Bitto, your phone

900
01:25:42,162 --> 01:25:43,652
Who is it?

901
01:25:45,231 --> 01:25:46,493
Perhaps.. a friend

902
01:25:47,467 --> 01:25:49,435
Birjoo. Hey, Birjoo

903
01:25:52,172 --> 01:25:54,163
Guess what happened, just guess

904
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,539
Half an hour ago, we were in a
meeting, me, my brother, the managers

905
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:03,277
A Japanese multinational corporation
has offered us a deal,

906
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:07,684
a new line of business. It'll be a
great thing for our organization

907
01:26:09,089 --> 01:26:12,149
They want us in Tokyo next week,
with the project reports

908
01:26:12,225 --> 01:26:15,194
My brother is busy with the
clients from Switzerland

909
01:26:15,261 --> 01:26:17,286
And Papa is out of station,
so who is to be sent

910
01:26:25,038 --> 01:26:26,232
I'm going

911
01:26:27,107 --> 01:26:28,301
I'll go

912
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,982
I'm off to Japan next week
and there's lots of work,

913
01:26:39,052 --> 01:26:40,246
no time to talk. Bye

914
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,568
Birjoo.. Birjoo

915
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,140
What happened?

916
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,177
At today's meeting..

917
01:27:19,426 --> 01:27:23,522
Project report will be ready in 3 days.
Let's book flight tickets for Monday

918
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:25,554
I'm thinking, Ms Poonam..

919
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:31,394
I mean.. Ms Pooja, it would be
nice if you and Mr Manohar..

920
01:27:31,471 --> 01:27:33,234
can join me on this trip

921
01:27:36,309 --> 01:27:39,972
Brother, is it necessary to send
the papers to our auditors..

922
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,310
in Madhupur.. I mean, Mumbai

923
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:46,541
No.. it won't be necessary

924
01:27:48,154 --> 01:27:49,348
Yes, of course

925
01:27:50,256 --> 01:27:51,416
Excuse me

926
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:59,123
You're laughing! I'll
never talk to you again

927
01:28:10,143 --> 01:28:11,576
Sister, you've upset him

928
01:28:12,345 --> 01:28:14,643
Stop the rickshaw.
- Go and call him now

929
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:41,740
You drank chilled water again?

930
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:43,234
Yes

931
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,202
Why?

932
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:48,239
I'm coming to see you

933
01:28:48,314 --> 01:28:49,747
What?

934
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,242
Yes, right away

935
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:55,546
Stop

936
01:29:02,328 --> 01:29:06,230
It's a big project, is that
why you're afraid?

937
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:10,660
Poonam, if I do not succeed..

938
01:29:12,539 --> 01:29:14,234
will it affect your love for me?

939
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:18,741
How can you not succeed?

940
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:27,610
In legal matters, business,
I never had an aptitude

941
01:29:29,556 --> 01:29:32,423
Everyone seems to be more experienced
than I am.. more capable

942
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:36,355
You'll surely succeed

943
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,658
And you know, when you
return a victor,

944
01:29:42,101 --> 01:29:46,629
everyone will be waiting with garlands
at the airport, to welcome you

945
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:50,767
How can you speak with
such confidence?

946
01:29:52,445 --> 01:29:53,537
I know you

947
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,578
It seems, you know me better
than I know myself

948
01:30:04,324 --> 01:30:05,484
I'll pray for you

949
01:30:09,128 --> 01:30:10,186
Say it again

950
01:30:11,164 --> 01:30:12,358
I'll pray for you

951
01:30:16,236 --> 01:30:17,396
I'm leaving in 3 days

952
01:30:19,072 --> 01:30:21,540
For a month, no phone
calls, no letters

953
01:30:22,075 --> 01:30:23,303
Be prepared

954
01:30:25,612 --> 01:30:27,580
I accept. Anything else?

955
01:30:33,152 --> 01:30:36,315
You are here? Everyone's waiting
for you, for the meeting

956
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:40,626
Go.. I love you dearly

957
01:31:31,644 --> 01:31:34,272
Awake.. at this hour?

958
01:31:36,182 --> 01:31:37,342
I have the right

959
01:31:40,486 --> 01:31:43,319
Waiting for someone
gives such pleasure?

960
01:31:43,389 --> 01:31:45,721
That only a woman's heart would know

961
01:31:47,093 --> 01:31:48,219
Ready to leave?

962
01:31:49,195 --> 01:31:50,662
Yes

963
01:31:52,498 --> 01:31:54,022
Once I'm there, I think
I'll grow a beard for..

964
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:56,159
.. folks to take me more seriously

965
01:31:59,105 --> 01:32:00,231
That won't be necessary

966
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:04,503
Can I shout?

967
01:32:07,113 --> 01:32:08,375
Most welcome

968
01:32:08,448 --> 01:32:10,075
I love you

969
01:32:21,594 --> 01:32:23,687
Rama, Agra was the right place to go.

970
01:32:24,163 --> 01:32:27,428
We got the musicians,
also confectioners

971
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,061
The same confectioner,
whom you favor too

972
01:32:32,138 --> 01:32:34,197
Everyone will land up two or
three days before the wedding

973
01:32:35,241 --> 01:32:37,573
Imagine in less than two months,
Bitto will be a bride

974
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:45,209
Aunty, you asked for me?

975
01:32:46,486 --> 01:32:48,386
Yes.. sit

976
01:32:56,529 --> 01:33:01,728
Look, very soon you'll be married
.. you'll enter another family

977
01:33:03,436 --> 01:33:05,404
That will be your home

978
01:33:07,507 --> 01:33:10,169
As we know, your Uncle
is very attached to you

979
01:33:11,577 --> 01:33:16,708
Obviously, when you leave,
he will miss you dearly

980
01:33:19,485 --> 01:33:24,149
So it's time you began to
distance yourself from him

981
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:31,394
When your Uncle goes out, Chhoti
can also give him his shawl, no?

982
01:33:33,332 --> 01:33:34,526
Yes Aunty

983
01:33:39,138 --> 01:33:41,436
Why ask me to give the
shawl to Babuji?

984
01:33:41,507 --> 01:33:43,270
Because I wish you would

985
01:33:43,342 --> 01:33:45,435
No, because Maa wishes it

986
01:33:45,511 --> 01:33:50,073
Sister, your getting married doesn't
mean you must break all bonds

987
01:33:50,149 --> 01:33:54,085
It's your home no more, that's
what Maa is implying?

988
01:33:56,289 --> 01:33:59,224
You'll be the one taking care of
all these things, after I'm gone

989
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:04,760
Yes, but after you're gone, Sister.
Why from now itself?

990
01:34:06,165 --> 01:34:11,034
Because, while I'm still here, my
Chhoti must pick up everything from me

991
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:14,669
Take.. it's time for Uncle
to visit the temple

992
01:34:23,583 --> 01:34:24,641
Babuji..

993
01:34:25,551 --> 01:34:28,042
Chhoti.. how come you've
brought my shawl?

994
01:34:29,222 --> 01:34:30,985
Sister is ironing clothes.
- Okay..

995
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,355
Bitto usually wraps it
around like this..

996
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:50,999
Poonam, books from your
schooldays are..

997
01:34:51,077 --> 01:34:53,477
.. still in the room
you share with Chhoti

998
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:58,343
Select the stuff you
want to take along..

999
01:34:58,417 --> 01:35:00,317
..the rest we'll have to dispose off

1000
01:35:01,621 --> 01:35:03,486
Chhoti needs more space
in the room to herself

1001
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:40,615
Girls' College, Madhupur

1002
01:35:42,328 --> 01:35:43,386
Here you are Poonam,

1003
01:35:43,462 --> 01:35:44,520
transfer papers for
your Delhi college

1004
01:35:44,597 --> 01:35:45,723
Thank you Ma'am

1005
01:35:54,073 --> 01:35:55,199
Sister, quick!

1006
01:35:55,274 --> 01:35:56,673
It's a call from Delhi

1007
01:36:03,482 --> 01:36:05,416
Sunil Babu, my heartiest compliments!

1008
01:36:05,484 --> 01:36:06,542
One second, one second..

1009
01:36:06,619 --> 01:36:08,018
Prem Babu's Japan tour

1010
01:36:08,087 --> 01:36:09,349
is a great success

1011
01:36:09,422 --> 01:36:11,515
Yes Sunil Babu, tell us more

1012
01:36:11,591 --> 01:36:13,058
Uncle, you can't imagine!

1013
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:16,026
Prem has outdone his peers

1014
01:36:16,095 --> 01:36:17,960
He has closed the deal early.

1015
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:19,190
He will be back by the morning flight

1016
01:36:19,265 --> 01:36:21,062
He's returning tomorrow morning?

1017
01:36:21,133 --> 01:36:22,464
Uncle I have a request

1018
01:36:22,535 --> 01:36:23,968
We'd like to have Poonam with us, when

1019
01:36:24,036 --> 01:36:27,369
we receive Prem at the
airport tomorrow

1020
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,169
Prem would be happily surprised

1021
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,107
Certainly, Sunil Babu.

1022
01:36:32,044 --> 01:36:33,978
Poonam will be there
to share your joys

1023
01:36:34,046 --> 01:36:35,172
Fine

1024
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:36,306
I'll send the car tomorrow morning

1025
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:45,548
Come on Bitto,

1026
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:47,252
your palanquin's here from Delhi

1027
01:36:58,004 --> 01:36:59,130
Good morning

1028
01:37:08,347 --> 01:37:10,110
Our wedding day..

1029
01:37:13,085 --> 01:37:14,950
Our wedding day..

1030
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:17,353
is four weeks away,

1031
01:37:17,423 --> 01:37:19,391
each week seems like hundred years

1032
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:22,188
How can I endure this torture,

1033
01:37:22,261 --> 01:37:27,028
I can't wait for even a day longer

1034
01:37:27,099 --> 01:37:28,964
Right now..

1035
01:37:29,035 --> 01:37:34,029
give me today itself,

1036
01:37:34,106 --> 01:37:35,971
your lovely caress, my dear

1037
01:37:36,042 --> 01:37:37,566
Poonam..

1038
01:37:39,045 --> 01:37:41,172
my love

1039
01:37:41,247 --> 01:37:45,479
Oh Poonam.. oh my love

1040
01:37:50,456 --> 01:37:51,548
You want something, sir?

1041
01:38:15,614 --> 01:38:19,414
When I look down, I find oceans of you

1042
01:38:19,485 --> 01:38:24,218
Then I look up to see,
skies full of you

1043
01:38:29,095 --> 01:38:30,722
I'm so eager

1044
01:38:33,599 --> 01:38:35,464
For a re-union, I'm eager

1045
01:38:35,534 --> 01:38:38,264
but the plane's too slow, by far

1046
01:38:38,337 --> 01:38:40,202
If I could, I would

1047
01:38:40,272 --> 01:38:43,105
Iand this plane on her roof..

1048
01:38:43,175 --> 01:38:45,040
and enjoy the pampering of her folks

1049
01:38:45,111 --> 01:38:47,545
for a full month

1050
01:38:47,613 --> 01:38:49,581
I'll return with her,

1051
01:38:49,648 --> 01:38:52,139
return with her,

1052
01:38:52,218 --> 01:38:57,212
the one whose sole-rightful lover I am

1053
01:38:57,289 --> 01:38:58,688
Oh Poonam..

1054
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:01,383
my love

1055
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:05,587
Oh Poonam.. oh my love

1056
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:14,232
You want to go in?

1057
01:39:40,366 --> 01:39:41,526
Excuse me

1058
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:52,236
Excuse me.. tea, coffee?

1059
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:57,040
To every fellow traveler,

1060
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:59,346
all I got to say..

1061
01:39:59,418 --> 01:40:02,046
wherever you go, with you always,

1062
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:04,180
Iet your sweetheart stay

1063
01:40:09,228 --> 01:40:10,695
Alas! Moments of loneliness

1064
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:15,333
Even a moment's separation..

1065
01:40:15,401 --> 01:40:18,165
I can bear no longer

1066
01:40:18,237 --> 01:40:20,228
I wish Destiny..

1067
01:40:20,306 --> 01:40:22,706
makes one little favor..

1068
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:24,666
sends her to..

1069
01:40:25,077 --> 01:40:27,477
to.. Delhi airport for me

1070
01:40:27,546 --> 01:40:29,411
And when I see her,

1071
01:40:29,482 --> 01:40:31,643
oh what wondrous surprise it'd be

1072
01:40:32,084 --> 01:40:34,416
to find her there in front of me..

1073
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:37,285
it'd make me scream so heartily..

1074
01:40:37,356 --> 01:40:38,584
Ho Poonam, ho!

1075
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:41,319
You are my love, ho!

1076
01:40:41,393 --> 01:40:46,353
Oh Poonam.. oh my love

1077
01:40:51,437 --> 01:40:53,302
Our wedding day..

1078
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:58,275
our wedding is,

1079
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:00,710
just four weeks away

1080
01:41:00,779 --> 01:41:02,747
Where months have passed,

1081
01:41:03,115 --> 01:41:05,549
these days will fly too

1082
01:41:05,618 --> 01:41:07,711
Then I won't make you pine,

1083
01:41:07,786 --> 01:41:10,152
I won't make you suffer

1084
01:41:10,222 --> 01:41:12,383
Just a little wait..

1085
01:41:12,458 --> 01:41:14,653
all your wishes..

1086
01:41:14,727 --> 01:41:16,627
will come true..

1087
01:41:16,695 --> 01:41:19,562
in my embrace,

1088
01:41:19,632 --> 01:41:22,123
my darling,

1089
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:24,328
my love

1090
01:41:24,403 --> 01:41:29,204
my darling,..my love

1091
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:34,673
Fasten your seat-belt, sir

1092
01:41:36,081 --> 01:41:37,742
My wedding day..

1093
01:41:39,585 --> 01:41:43,351
is still four long weeks away

1094
01:41:57,436 --> 01:41:58,596
There's Uncle

1095
01:42:15,154 --> 01:42:16,416
Come.. come

1096
01:42:28,133 --> 01:42:29,327
The whole office is out in force,

1097
01:42:29,401 --> 01:42:30,561
to congratulate you

1098
01:42:32,071 --> 01:42:33,163
Uncle..

1099
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:34,296
- Bless you, son

1100
01:42:34,373 --> 01:42:35,533
Congratulations, many congratulations

1101
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:37,701
Brother.. has Uncle come alone?

1102
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:41,178
Yes.. was someone else expected?

1103
01:42:41,246 --> 01:42:42,338
- No..

1104
01:42:42,414 --> 01:42:45,178
Let's all proceed towards home

1105
01:42:46,352 --> 01:42:47,751
Get in

1106
01:42:58,564 --> 01:43:00,225
Sister-in-law is that really Poonam..?

1107
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:01,596
- Touch her to find out

1108
01:43:17,049 --> 01:43:18,311
I can't believe this!

1109
01:43:18,384 --> 01:43:19,476
When did Poonam come in,

1110
01:43:19,551 --> 01:43:21,041
when did you plan all this?

1111
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:23,384
It was his idea, to ask Poonam over.

1112
01:43:23,455 --> 01:43:25,480
- What an idea, brother!

1113
01:43:25,557 --> 01:43:27,525
Where are thy lotus feet?

1114
01:43:27,593 --> 01:43:29,322
At thy lotus feet I shall bow and..

1115
01:43:29,395 --> 01:43:30,589
Exult? (ln chaste Hindi)

1116
01:43:30,663 --> 01:43:32,528
- Exactly!

1117
01:43:32,598 --> 01:43:35,066
Desist, first return to your place

1118
01:43:35,134 --> 01:43:36,999
And with your fiance, engage in

1119
01:43:37,069 --> 01:43:38,696
polite conversation (..
in chaste Hindi)

1120
01:43:40,072 --> 01:43:41,198
Indeed

1121
01:43:41,273 --> 01:43:44,174
Indeed.. Oh, I just
love this language.

1122
01:43:44,243 --> 01:43:45,301
- Joker

1123
01:43:45,377 --> 01:43:46,435
Papa is throwing a party at home,

1124
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:47,570
to felicitate you..

1125
01:43:47,646 --> 01:43:49,011
and also because Poonam

1126
01:43:49,081 --> 01:43:50,639
is here for the first time

1127
01:43:57,489 --> 01:43:59,423
Welcome.. how are you?

1128
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:01,557
Prem's father-in-law

1129
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:17,134
Friends, I'm on cloud nine

1130
01:44:17,209 --> 01:44:18,972
My son has achieved this

1131
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:21,103
on his own merit

1132
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:23,978
The glow you see on
his face is nothing

1133
01:44:24,049 --> 01:44:26,483
but the reflection of my heartfelt joy

1134
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:29,985
For his success, my joys,

1135
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:32,523
the credit goes to someone..

1136
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:35,083
who is visiting us for the first time

1137
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,151
.. my new daughter-in-law

1138
01:44:42,668 --> 01:44:43,999
In eating, our Krishnakant

1139
01:44:44,069 --> 01:44:45,696
is the world's most bashful

1140
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:48,005
More pakodas for him.

1141
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:49,199
- Enough

1142
01:44:49,274 --> 01:44:50,332
Krishnakant, we know,

1143
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:52,604
it's your favorite. Poonam,
serve there

1144
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:56,544
You cannot refuse now..

1145
01:44:56,615 --> 01:44:58,207
my daughter-in-law is serving you

1146
01:45:09,628 --> 01:45:11,619
Papa, how about giving Poonam

1147
01:45:11,697 --> 01:45:13,562
a tour of the house
before she leaves?

1148
01:45:13,632 --> 01:45:14,963
Sure, take her

1149
01:45:15,033 --> 01:45:16,159
Come, Poonam

1150
01:45:22,641 --> 01:45:25,474
Poonam, after our wedding,
this will be our room

1151
01:45:53,605 --> 01:45:56,199
In Som Sarovar, I snapped the
portraits of your uncle and aunt..

1152
01:45:56,275 --> 01:46:01,508
especially for this side-table. You
know Poonam, sometimes I think..

1153
01:46:04,283 --> 01:46:05,341
What happened?

1154
01:46:07,352 --> 01:46:08,614
Nothing

1155
01:46:12,024 --> 01:46:13,457
So, what were you thinking?

1156
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:26,366
Must we speak always and only about
what I think, what I feel?

1157
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:32,101
What you think, you feel,
is also vital

1158
01:46:34,146 --> 01:46:35,340
We're companions, Poonam

1159
01:46:39,117 --> 01:46:44,180
Today, while serving Uncle,
I got so emotional,

1160
01:46:45,657 --> 01:46:47,352
I had to hold back my tears

1161
01:46:55,634 --> 01:46:58,000
Poonam, I brought you here..

1162
01:46:58,070 --> 01:47:04,236
to show you my new cupboard, my
writing table, my new computer..

1163
01:47:07,145 --> 01:47:12,947
without a thought, that your cupboard,
writing table, even your surname..

1164
01:47:13,018 --> 01:47:20,254
you'll be leaving behind..
for my sake

1165
01:47:22,427 --> 01:47:23,553
For our sakes

1166
01:47:26,498 --> 01:47:31,128
Poonam, I've just decided! Every year
we'll spend one month in Madhupur

1167
01:47:31,203 --> 01:47:34,434
If anyone ridicules me for living
with my in-laws, I don't care

1168
01:47:38,443 --> 01:47:39,603
I hear..

1169
01:47:39,678 --> 01:47:43,273
in the countdown to the wedding date,
girls go crazy about shedding weight?

1170
01:47:46,551 --> 01:47:50,078
No crash diets for you. 10-15 kilos
here or there, is no issue

1171
01:47:54,059 --> 01:47:58,257
Can you imagine what will happen when
you arrive riding a mare to wed me?

1172
01:47:58,330 --> 01:47:59,490
What?

1173
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:05,066
The bread is likely to get burnt in
the ovens of our neighbors' homes

1174
01:48:07,406 --> 01:48:08,498
Why?

1175
01:48:09,574 --> 01:48:13,476
Every girl will be on her terrace,
vying to take a peek at the bridegroom

1176
01:48:25,557 --> 01:48:27,457
Poonam, time to go

1177
01:48:27,526 --> 01:48:28,652
Yes, Sister-in-law

1178
01:48:30,195 --> 01:48:32,163
Sister-in-law, just
two minutes.. please

1179
01:48:33,365 --> 01:48:34,730
All right, make it quick

1180
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,591
How much will they talk?
- Shh.. come on

1181
01:48:44,176 --> 01:48:47,509
Poonam, my heart knows, l
don't want to let you go

1182
01:48:49,114 --> 01:48:52,208
I want to show you around Delhi,
to take you places with me

1183
01:48:55,387 --> 01:48:59,585
But we'll wait, as even
you consider it proper

1184
01:49:04,529 --> 01:49:06,394
And in a way, what's
proper is so right

1185
01:49:08,734 --> 01:49:13,671
The night, when you enter this room
as my bride, will be so right..

1186
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:18,734
that the Moon, the stars out there
will come down, to witness our union

1187
01:49:19,177 --> 01:49:22,669
And they will carry our legend to
every couple who marry after us

1188
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:28,517
On our perfect night, let
only the Moonlight shine..

1189
01:49:30,489 --> 01:49:35,188
upon the world's prettiest girl,
who by then, would be mine..

1190
01:49:36,361 --> 01:49:37,555
for ever

1191
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:46,093
Is it true Poonam that you will
always be so close to my heart?

1192
01:49:50,675 --> 01:49:57,774
Am I really going to be the lucky one,
you'll gift your days and nights to?

1193
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:15,590
A few things for you, a few
things for the household

1194
01:50:15,667 --> 01:50:18,568
Give it to Aunty, she'll
understand. - Sure, Sister-in-law

1195
01:50:22,074 --> 01:50:23,200
Bless you

1196
01:50:25,177 --> 01:50:26,405
Return soon

1197
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,708
This household, all of us here..
are waiting for you

1198
01:50:32,017 --> 01:50:33,211
Uncle Bhagat..

1199
01:50:33,285 --> 01:50:36,686
isn't there a custom to escort
the lady? - Should be..

1200
01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:40,255
shall I ask your father-in-law? Let
me.. - No, what are you doing!

1201
01:50:44,629 --> 01:50:48,622
Uncle.. for Aunty,
a video disc of today's party

1202
01:50:50,202 --> 01:50:51,726
My respects Uncle.
- Bless you, son

1203
01:50:53,205 --> 01:50:56,106
Prem, isn't Uncle getting
late? (ln chaste Hindi)

1204
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:00,274
Turn the air-conditioning vent
sideways, not a direct blast

1205
01:51:06,318 --> 01:51:09,446
Someone was once my little darling..

1206
01:51:11,356 --> 01:51:14,450
she was like a soft jasmine bud

1207
01:51:16,394 --> 01:51:19,522
Someone was once my little darling..

1208
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:24,598
she was like a soft jasmine bud

1209
01:51:26,271 --> 01:51:29,604
Mama, look.. Sister is
looking so radiant

1210
01:51:31,176 --> 01:51:35,306
Whose borders were from
home to the street..

1211
01:51:37,082 --> 01:51:40,279
Is she the same girl..

1212
01:51:42,354 --> 01:51:48,122
Rama, I was listing the items
we'll give to Poonam,

1213
01:51:48,193 --> 01:51:53,722
the things she will need, clothes,
jewelry. And listen..

1214
01:51:54,232 --> 01:51:58,032
half the jewelry I retrieved
after I paid my..

1215
01:51:58,103 --> 01:52:00,537
.. brother's debts, goes with Poonam

1216
01:52:01,173 --> 01:52:02,663
Give it to me, I got
to get it polished

1217
01:52:16,254 --> 01:52:18,222
There's no need to give
away old jewelry

1218
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:22,590
Here's the jewelry that Mr Bhagat
made for this wedding. This is enough

1219
01:52:24,129 --> 01:52:25,323
What do you mean?

1220
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:30,000
Maybe you didn't notice that
diamond set worth millions?

1221
01:52:30,068 --> 01:52:34,061
Your darling niece was made to wear it
by her in-laws for the party in Delhi

1222
01:52:35,574 --> 01:52:38,008
If she doesn't wear your
jewelry worth some..

1223
01:52:38,076 --> 01:52:40,271
.. thousands, her beauty
won't be marred

1224
01:52:42,147 --> 01:52:43,580
Leave the old jewelry for Chhoti

1225
01:52:44,683 --> 01:52:47,117
Rama, do not forget.. that jewelry
belonged to my brother

1226
01:52:48,153 --> 01:52:50,553
Not mere ornaments, they're symbolic
of his blessings for her

1227
01:52:50,622 --> 01:52:54,285
What he pawned, was his. What
we retrieved, belongs to us

1228
01:52:55,427 --> 01:52:58,191
Is Poonam not one of us?

1229
01:52:59,431 --> 01:53:00,523
I've said what I had to say

1230
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,100
You're going overboard
with this wedding

1231
01:53:04,169 --> 01:53:06,034
About the jewelry, if
you force your whim,..

1232
01:53:06,104 --> 01:53:08,504
.. I'll have nothing to
do with this wedding

1233
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:10,973
Rama, in this family we've
two daughters..

1234
01:53:11,042 --> 01:53:14,170
.. and they have equal
right to all we have

1235
01:53:14,246 --> 01:53:17,682
And Poonam is my elder daughter,
whether you like it or not

1236
01:53:21,386 --> 01:53:22,648
Then so be it

1237
01:53:24,422 --> 01:53:25,582
Here's the jewelry

1238
01:53:25,657 --> 01:53:29,149
Here are the keys. Do what you want

1239
01:53:30,061 --> 01:53:31,187
Rama!

1240
01:53:37,402 --> 01:53:40,200
Sorry Aunty.. some gifts from
Delhi, if you'll take a look..

1241
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:46,108
I know! Your in-laws are filthy rich
and you needn't show it off in my face

1242
01:53:46,177 --> 01:53:50,409
Show it to the one who ought to know!
I've nothing to do with this wedding

1243
01:54:03,361 --> 01:54:05,727
The florist is arriving from Delhi
by the ten o'clock train

1244
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:09,096
Get to the station to bring him here

1245
01:54:13,038 --> 01:54:14,300
Welcome Bhagat

1246
01:54:17,175 --> 01:54:21,271
I'm here now, what can I do to help?
- Your presence is enough

1247
01:54:23,048 --> 01:54:25,608
I've brought you Poonam's wedding
dress from her in-laws

1248
01:54:28,153 --> 01:54:29,245
Here you are..

1249
01:54:39,064 --> 01:54:40,326
Two days from now,

1250
01:54:40,398 --> 01:54:43,299
as the clock strikes this hour,
you'll be giving your daughter away

1251
01:54:56,081 --> 01:54:59,312
Aunty, the keys to my cupboard

1252
01:55:01,353 --> 01:55:04,720
There are so many things inside..
Chhoti, could use them

1253
01:55:22,107 --> 01:55:26,976
Aunty, if I have ever done
anything to hurt you..

1254
01:55:27,045 --> 01:55:30,412
please forgive me

1255
01:55:41,993 --> 01:55:43,187
Poonam..

1256
01:55:46,164 --> 01:55:47,324
before you leave..

1257
01:55:47,399 --> 01:55:48,661
shut the door

1258
01:56:01,346 --> 01:56:03,007
Take it easy, one at a time

1259
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:07,347
Tell them Sister-in-law, please.
- Sure. Please, don't harass him

1260
01:56:07,419 --> 01:56:11,150
Wait.. what's the purpose
of this make up?

1261
01:56:11,222 --> 01:56:14,680
To make you look worthy enough
for your pretty wife-to-be

1262
01:56:15,226 --> 01:56:18,957
Really? Then let's have some more
here.. and here.. and here

1263
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:20,258
Naughty

1264
01:56:21,032 --> 01:56:24,490
May the henna turn a lovely crimson
on your hands, o'bride

1265
01:56:24,569 --> 01:56:28,699
And fetch to you, your lover forever

1266
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:33,170
Of many fortunes the henna begets,
the most precious is.. eternal love

1267
01:56:35,313 --> 01:56:37,645
Is this all right..?

1268
01:56:39,384 --> 01:56:42,547
It's the fourth time you've tried it.
Hurry, I got to finish packing

1269
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:45,248
Else, the bridegroom's party will
leave without the bridegroom

1270
01:56:50,228 --> 01:56:52,162
Come Sister-in-law, I'll paint
your hands with henna

1271
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,231
Sister-in-law.. come, join us

1272
01:56:58,570 --> 01:57:00,265
This ritual is too painfully
long for me

1273
01:57:07,145 --> 01:57:11,241
We sing glories of the
Daughter of the hills,

1274
01:57:14,118 --> 01:57:18,179
whose beauty holds Shiva enthralled

1275
01:57:18,256 --> 01:57:22,488
Today we seek Gauri Maa's blessings,

1276
01:57:23,094 --> 01:57:26,962
who revels in Shiva's love forever

1277
01:57:33,137 --> 01:57:37,403
Oh Goddess, You are resplendent
in vermilion,

1278
01:57:37,475 --> 01:57:41,673
Oh Goddess, You are resplendent
in vermilion,

1279
01:57:42,146 --> 01:57:47,140
You wear the bride's reds, Your
palms adorned in crimson henna

1280
01:57:47,218 --> 01:57:51,587
red is Your veil ; redden vermilion
streaks Your hair,

1281
01:57:51,656 --> 01:57:56,423
the red dot on Your forehead,
fragrant with musk

1282
01:57:56,494 --> 01:58:01,295
We pray to You, pour
our emotions to You

1283
01:58:04,135 --> 01:58:07,696
Krishnakant, the rituals have begun,
but I don't see Sister-in-law..?

1284
01:58:09,574 --> 01:58:10,734
I'll fetch her

1285
01:58:12,176 --> 01:58:16,272
O Giver of every wish,

1286
01:58:18,616 --> 01:58:22,677
Keep the bride happy always

1287
01:58:23,521 --> 01:58:27,321
Hail Gauri Mother.
Hail Gauri Mother..

1288
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:31,390
What is it? Is it the pain
in the knee again?

1289
01:58:41,439 --> 01:58:42,770
Massage it with the balm

1290
01:58:53,117 --> 01:58:57,383
Rama, you did not even look at Poonam's
wedding dress ; I said nothing

1291
01:58:59,223 --> 01:59:03,489
You didn't participate in any of the
wedding rituals ; I said nothing

1292
01:59:04,729 --> 01:59:05,787
But Rama tomorrow..

1293
01:59:07,231 --> 01:59:08,755
tomorrow, Bitto will be leaving
this house forever

1294
01:59:18,343 --> 01:59:20,573
Tomorrow, the bridegroom's party will
come to our door, just like this,

1295
01:59:20,645 --> 01:59:23,136
with a band playing songs of joy

1296
01:59:23,214 --> 01:59:25,739
Give the bride a happy send-off, Rama

1297
01:59:26,184 --> 01:59:28,311
Rama you know this, as I know

1298
01:59:28,386 --> 01:59:31,617
If she is denied your blessings, it
won't be a happy send-off for her

1299
01:59:31,689 --> 01:59:33,020
For once, forget all else Rama,

1300
01:59:33,091 --> 01:59:35,184
for the sake of Poonam's happiness,

1301
01:59:35,259 --> 01:59:42,097
Iet her depart with the belief that
her mother has blessed her way

1302
01:59:44,502 --> 01:59:47,130
All her life, she has yearned
for that one smile of yours

1303
01:59:48,272 --> 01:59:52,038
It's for the child's joy ;
even if we do something..

1304
01:59:52,110 --> 01:59:54,203
.. we dislike, we won't lose face

1305
01:59:56,381 --> 01:59:59,612
But why such resentment, because
she isn't your daughter?

1306
02:00:01,519 --> 02:00:02,645
Better, you do not hear the reply

1307
02:00:08,126 --> 02:00:09,388
Remember Rama..?

1308
02:00:10,495 --> 02:00:14,989
Whenever your knee was in pain, it
was Poonam giving you a massage

1309
02:00:15,066 --> 02:00:16,590
Enough

1310
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:26,008
Today, you refuse to acknowledge her.
But mind you, when she leaves us..

1311
02:00:26,077 --> 02:00:28,170
you will cry the most

1312
02:00:40,425 --> 02:00:43,553
I am your Mother,

1313
02:00:43,628 --> 02:00:47,189
you are my daughter

1314
02:00:47,265 --> 02:00:50,098
Our bond..

1315
02:00:50,168 --> 02:00:53,535
forever,

1316
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:57,608
holds us together

1317
02:00:57,675 --> 02:01:01,577
In this home, you shall
never be a stranger..

1318
02:01:01,646 --> 02:01:05,047
though you go to make another
home for yourself

1319
02:01:05,116 --> 02:01:07,050
In both homes, truly..

1320
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:08,244
you'll belong forever

1321
02:01:57,201 --> 02:02:00,034
Make sure you're done with making
the sweets tonight..

1322
02:02:00,104 --> 02:02:01,731
we're cooking for 400 guests,

1323
02:02:02,206 --> 02:02:05,198
there should be no shortages..
the guests are coming from Delhi

1324
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:10,472
Chhote Babu..

1325
02:02:13,551 --> 02:02:16,486
Chhote Babu.. fire!
The house is on fire

1326
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:33,330
Chhote Babu..

1327
02:02:33,404 --> 02:02:34,462
Fire!

1328
02:02:34,539 --> 02:02:36,564
It's a fire!
- Everyone.. out!

1329
02:02:36,641 --> 02:02:39,132
Out.. everyone outside

1330
02:02:45,082 --> 02:02:46,515
Hurry!

1331
02:02:46,584 --> 02:02:48,017
But how did all this..
- All questions later..

1332
02:02:48,085 --> 02:02:49,211
Get out, first

1333
02:02:49,287 --> 02:02:51,448
Water! Douse the fire!

1334
02:03:02,166 --> 02:03:04,498
Quick.. more water! Hurry!

1335
02:03:04,569 --> 02:03:06,730
Bhagat! Where are Chhoti and
Bitto? - Chhoti and Bitto..?

1336
02:03:10,041 --> 02:03:11,474
Somebody save the bride!

1337
02:03:12,043 --> 02:03:13,408
Bitto!

1338
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:30,322
Uncle

1339
02:03:30,394 --> 02:03:32,055
Don't panic..

1340
02:03:32,129 --> 02:03:34,120
walk to the door

1341
02:03:36,167 --> 02:03:37,327
Stay back

1342
02:03:42,473 --> 02:03:43,667
Quick!

1343
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:47,570
Your wedding dress?

1344
02:03:57,188 --> 02:03:58,348
Make way for the bride

1345
02:04:01,626 --> 02:04:03,457
Where is Chhoti.. where is Chhoti?

1346
02:04:03,527 --> 02:04:05,757
She must be inside..?
- No, she isn't.. go find her

1347
02:04:06,197 --> 02:04:07,289
Chhoti..?

1348
02:04:08,432 --> 02:04:09,592
Chhoti..!

1349
02:04:20,444 --> 02:04:23,140
Munim.. Chhoti..?
- I've no idea

1350
02:04:23,214 --> 02:04:27,446
Listen.. I think I saw
her going up the stairs

1351
02:04:30,154 --> 02:04:31,712
Listen.. Bitto.. wait!

1352
02:04:37,161 --> 02:04:38,560
Where are you going, Bitto?

1353
02:04:38,629 --> 02:04:39,721
Stop

1354
02:04:46,537 --> 02:04:48,437
Krishnakant.. Krishnakant..

1355
02:04:48,506 --> 02:04:49,700
Chhoti

1356
02:05:07,191 --> 02:05:08,351
Chhoti

1357
02:05:21,305 --> 02:05:22,431
Sister

1358
02:05:50,401 --> 02:05:51,561
Leave me!

1359
02:06:03,414 --> 02:06:06,178
Chhoti.. Chhoti..

1360
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:08,115
Aunty,

1361
02:06:30,141 --> 02:06:31,301
Aunty,

1362
02:06:31,375 --> 02:06:32,433
Chhoti is fine,

1363
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:33,568
she's all right

1364
02:06:35,112 --> 02:06:36,306
Poonam

1365
02:06:38,983 --> 02:06:40,177
Chhoti!

1366
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:10,445
Call Dr Rashid, a burns case is here

1367
02:07:18,422 --> 02:07:22,654
The patient has severe burns, Doctor.
- Okay, let's go

1368
02:08:00,431 --> 02:08:03,400
Excuse me.. who's the
patient's father?

1369
02:08:06,003 --> 02:08:07,129
Yes..?

1370
02:08:07,204 --> 02:08:08,296
Please come

1371
02:08:14,145 --> 02:08:15,271
Sit

1372
02:08:21,352 --> 02:08:24,446
The patient has approximately 40
percent superficial to deep burns,

1373
02:08:26,257 --> 02:08:27,622
third degree burns included

1374
02:08:31,195 --> 02:08:32,685
Luckily, her face was untouched

1375
02:08:37,535 --> 02:08:41,232
Doctor, tomorrow morning,
her bridegroom is arriving

1376
02:08:43,174 --> 02:08:44,641
It is Poonam's wedding tomorrow

1377
02:08:49,413 --> 02:08:53,144
About half of her body is burnt,

1378
02:08:55,619 --> 02:08:56,711
the wounds are deep

1379
02:08:59,657 --> 02:09:01,488
A wedding tomorrow is out of question

1380
02:09:05,629 --> 02:09:09,725
Forgive me for saying.. in such
cases even families abandon their own,

1381
02:09:11,535 --> 02:09:13,127
Iesser said the better.. for someone
who promised to marry her

1382
02:09:19,176 --> 02:09:21,474
Just now, your daughter
is fighting for her life

1383
02:09:24,081 --> 02:09:27,312
Tomorrow morning, as soon as possible,
we must go in for a major surgery

1384
02:09:29,687 --> 02:09:32,588
Now, if you will excuse me, I must
discuss the case with my team

1385
02:09:49,206 --> 02:09:50,468
Krishnakant,

1386
02:09:52,509 --> 02:09:55,171
by now, Prem must be starting out

1387
02:09:57,448 --> 02:09:58,779
We ought to inform..

1388
02:10:42,359 --> 02:10:43,621
Harishchandra quickly! Please

1389
02:10:45,162 --> 02:10:46,288
Sir.. Bhagat

1390
02:10:46,363 --> 02:10:47,728
Yes Bhagat?

1391
02:10:48,299 --> 02:10:51,132
Harishchandra, don't
come here now..

1392
02:11:08,185 --> 02:11:09,277
What happened, Papa?

1393
02:11:13,057 --> 02:11:14,251
Excuse me

1394
02:11:16,093 --> 02:11:18,721
Bhavna, one minute.
- What is it?

1395
02:11:44,621 --> 02:11:45,747
What's the matter Sister-in-law?

1396
02:11:55,699 --> 02:12:00,659
While we are getting ready for surgery
one of you may meet the patient

1397
02:12:05,376 --> 02:12:06,536
Doctor,

1398
02:12:08,345 --> 02:12:11,542
can I see Sister.. even
from far? Please

1399
02:12:14,118 --> 02:12:15,585
Okay, please wait

1400
02:13:11,308 --> 02:13:12,468
Uncle

1401
02:13:15,379 --> 02:13:16,505
Is Chhoti well, Uncle?

1402
02:13:19,116 --> 02:13:20,481
Nothing can harm Chhoti

1403
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,681
No fire can hurt Chhoti

1404
02:13:35,165 --> 02:13:39,431
Tell Aunty, nothing
can harm Chhoti

1405
02:13:43,407 --> 02:13:44,499
Chhoti.. Uncle..

1406
02:14:37,261 --> 02:14:40,662
Look Rama, the bridegroom
has arrived for Poonam

1407
02:14:43,567 --> 02:14:47,128
Look at her palanquin,
so gaily decorated

1408
02:14:50,407 --> 02:14:51,601
Just a while now, then
she will be gone

1409
02:14:55,546 --> 02:14:59,277
Didn't I tell you, you'll cry the most

1410
02:15:02,619 --> 02:15:05,213
It was her beauty that always
pained your eyes,

1411
02:15:07,691 --> 02:15:11,354
so much so, you wouldn't
even look at her

1412
02:15:14,698 --> 02:15:21,399
Look Rama, for our Chhoti's sake,
she has sacrificed her beauty

1413
02:15:25,375 --> 02:15:27,036
Sacrificed her beauty

1414
02:15:38,155 --> 02:15:42,114
Doctor, after the operation, Poonam
will recover fully, won't she?

1415
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:46,423
Right now, nothing can be said,
it's a very delicate case

1416
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,459
There's more to recovery than
the healing of wounds

1417
02:15:54,671 --> 02:15:57,071
In such cases, one loses
self-confidence

1418
02:15:58,575 --> 02:15:59,667
And the pain in burning..

1419
02:16:01,244 --> 02:16:04,577
you and I cannot imagine,
what that pain is like

1420
02:16:08,151 --> 02:16:11,348
Krishnakant, we're all ready
for Poonam's operation

1421
02:16:12,289 --> 02:16:13,449
It's a major surgery

1422
02:16:16,026 --> 02:16:18,221
I have informed you of the
complications in this case

1423
02:16:19,229 --> 02:16:20,526
Your permission is necessary

1424
02:16:25,135 --> 02:16:26,363
We will try our best

1425
02:16:51,228 --> 02:16:52,991
Two days from now..

1426
02:16:53,063 --> 02:16:55,463
as the clock strikes this hour,
you'll be giving your daughter away

1427
02:17:31,435 --> 02:17:32,527
Uncle

1428
02:17:46,249 --> 02:17:47,375
I will sign

1429
02:18:02,132 --> 02:18:03,997
The wedding will happen today

1430
02:18:04,067 --> 02:18:05,193
Now,

1431
02:18:06,403 --> 02:18:07,734
at the appointed time,

1432
02:18:10,574 --> 02:18:11,666
I seek your permission

1433
02:18:15,145 --> 02:18:16,237
No son,

1434
02:18:18,081 --> 02:18:21,346
your emotions are far-removed
from the reality of things

1435
02:18:21,418 --> 02:18:23,716
You will not be able
to see her in pain

1436
02:18:27,157 --> 02:18:29,091
The girl in pain is not
only your daughter,

1437
02:18:31,094 --> 02:18:32,220
she's also our daughter-in-law

1438
02:18:36,266 --> 02:18:38,496
The best surgeons from
Delhi will be here soon

1439
02:18:39,703 --> 02:18:42,570
Poonam's well-being is
now our responsibility

1440
02:18:43,373 --> 02:18:44,533
Be seated

1441
02:18:49,646 --> 02:18:51,511
Sunil..
- Papa..?

1442
02:18:51,581 --> 02:18:53,208
Come with me. Let's meet Dr Rashid

1443
02:18:57,387 --> 02:18:59,116
May I meet Poonam, Uncle?

1444
02:19:15,071 --> 02:19:16,333
Poonam

1445
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:25,180
Everything will be fine, Poonam

1446
02:19:34,357 --> 02:19:36,086
Look, what Sister-in-law has sent..

1447
02:19:36,159 --> 02:19:37,649
vermilion for my bride

1448
02:19:45,502 --> 02:19:46,730
It's our wedding today, Poonam

1449
02:20:01,484 --> 02:20:05,352
Sister, leave us alone
for two minutes, please

1450
02:20:14,064 --> 02:20:19,058
Once.. there was a pretty girl
who had a right to that vermilion

1451
02:20:21,104 --> 02:20:25,268
Today's ugly truth..
Iies under this canopy

1452
02:20:28,578 --> 02:20:31,012
Neither am I unawares
of truths Poonam,..

1453
02:20:31,081 --> 02:20:33,276
.. nor are you a stranger
to my intentions

1454
02:20:35,352 --> 02:20:38,185
If you want my love for you to
diminish at this sight of you..

1455
02:20:40,523 --> 02:20:41,615
that is inconceivable, Poonam

1456
02:20:49,432 --> 02:20:55,098
You always prayed for me Poonam and
your prayers were always answered

1457
02:20:58,174 --> 02:20:59,368
Today again.. please pray for me,

1458
02:21:01,444 --> 02:21:06,245
pray, that I find the strength within
me, to never let your faith weaken

1459
02:21:15,325 --> 02:21:20,228
You are my companion, Poonam..
my most beautiful one,

1460
02:21:23,266 --> 02:21:25,063
the one who's always worried,
lest I catch a cold

1461
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:33,670
One who cares about what I eat,
what I wear, more than I myself

1462
02:21:35,679 --> 02:21:38,011
The one who knows me more
than I know myself

1463
02:21:41,084 --> 02:21:46,078
On our wedding day, l
want from you.. a gift

1464
02:21:51,161 --> 02:21:52,458
Give me all your pain

1465
02:22:11,514 --> 02:22:15,974
Before the auspicious moment goes by,

1466
02:22:16,052 --> 02:22:18,282
Iet the rituals be done

1467
02:22:18,355 --> 02:22:20,983
Let there be no distance..

1468
02:22:21,057 --> 02:22:25,653
between the vermilion
and your forehead

1469
02:22:25,729 --> 02:22:29,995
This is the wedding altar,
the sacred fire,

1470
02:22:30,066 --> 02:22:32,660
the festive home

1471
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:36,004
At this wedding altar,

1472
02:22:36,072 --> 02:22:38,006
in God's presence,

1473
02:22:38,074 --> 02:22:40,133
in this festive home..

1474
02:22:40,210 --> 02:22:43,008
to anoint you with vermilion..

1475
02:22:43,079 --> 02:22:45,741
I have the right

1476
02:22:48,084 --> 02:22:53,181
I take you as my bride,
I have the right

1477
02:22:53,256 --> 02:22:54,518
Stop

1478
02:22:59,429 --> 02:23:04,128
For once, take off the covers,
look at what I've become

1479
02:23:06,202 --> 02:23:08,363
My love doesn't deserve
this test, Poonam

1480
02:23:10,473 --> 02:23:11,599
And you know it

1481
02:23:42,072 --> 02:23:43,664
Sweets, for everyone.
- Thank you, sir

1482
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:01,250
Where am I to sign, Doctor?

1483
02:24:06,196 --> 02:24:07,356
Mr Prem,

1484
02:24:09,632 --> 02:24:12,624
in this hospital, so far..

1485
02:24:13,536 --> 02:24:16,027
we've only seen.. brides tortured,
burnt for dowry

1486
02:24:18,608 --> 02:24:22,442
Today, for the first time ever, here..
we've seen someone becoming a bride

1487
02:24:27,150 --> 02:24:31,519
This is Dr Jain, a dear friend. Also,
a famous burns specialist

1488
02:24:32,255 --> 02:24:33,517
And his team.. this is Dr Rashid

1489
02:24:34,157 --> 02:24:36,318
We're here to help you
in any manner we can

1490
02:24:36,392 --> 02:24:39,327
You're most welcome, sir. It's
an honor to have you here

1491
02:24:40,497 --> 02:24:42,226
We've a battle waiting to be won

1492
02:24:44,067 --> 02:24:45,159
Take the new bride to the
operation theater, please

1493
02:24:45,235 --> 02:24:46,327
Please come, Doctor

1494
02:25:23,039 --> 02:25:24,165
Uncle, tea

1495
02:25:25,375 --> 02:25:27,036
No..
- We'll share

1496
02:25:28,545 --> 02:25:30,410
Why are you worrying, Krishnakant?

1497
02:25:32,048 --> 02:25:34,346
He is doing the worrying for
us. You drink your tea

1498
02:25:49,265 --> 02:25:51,392
Thank you so much, Doctor.
Congratulations

1499
02:25:53,503 --> 02:25:55,300
Doctor, how is she?

1500
02:25:55,371 --> 02:25:56,702
Operation successful

1501
02:25:57,073 --> 02:26:01,066
After 48 hours, when bandages come
off, we'll know the exact position

1502
02:26:02,278 --> 02:26:04,109
This first battle we have won, Prem

1503
02:26:06,683 --> 02:26:09,311
For at least a month and a half,
Poonam must stay here

1504
02:26:09,385 --> 02:26:10,443
Doctor..

1505
02:26:12,021 --> 02:26:13,318
Afterwards, she can go home?

1506
02:26:13,389 --> 02:26:14,447
Sure

1507
02:26:14,524 --> 02:26:19,018
Okay, until then, our daughter-in-law
remains in your charge, Krishnakant

1508
02:26:19,095 --> 02:26:21,689
Afterwards, the bridegroom's party
is right upon your doors

1509
02:26:22,031 --> 02:26:23,965
Got to make him throw us
a party, right Doctor?

1510
02:26:24,033 --> 02:26:25,364
Right

1511
02:26:26,135 --> 02:26:27,329
Bride's father

1512
02:26:33,643 --> 02:26:36,407
Time heals wounds..

1513
02:26:36,479 --> 02:26:41,610
it's true for sure ;

1514
02:26:43,119 --> 02:26:46,350
but quicker than Time..

1515
02:26:48,057 --> 02:26:52,153
Love heals

1516
02:26:55,198 --> 02:26:59,999
When your beloved is beside you..

1517
02:27:00,069 --> 02:27:03,300
with his healing touch..

1518
02:27:06,476 --> 02:27:10,242
a miracle then works..

1519
02:27:12,048 --> 02:27:15,609
upon wounds

1520
02:27:21,557 --> 02:27:24,685
Come home quickly Poonam, I'm waiting
to eat the curry you cook

1521
02:27:27,463 --> 02:27:29,954
Poonam, come quickly. We'll
go to Som Sarovar again

1522
02:27:30,033 --> 02:27:32,126
I've yet to read up all
the newspapers out there

1523
02:27:34,237 --> 02:27:36,262
Come soon. We miss you!
- Get well soon

1524
02:27:39,142 --> 02:27:40,234
Aunty, smile

1525
02:27:47,984 --> 02:27:49,178
Dressing

1526
02:28:06,135 --> 02:28:08,160
Give it a final coat
of paint, thoroughly

1527
02:28:09,405 --> 02:28:12,533
Uncle, now the painting
is almost over

1528
02:28:13,476 --> 02:28:16,502
Sunil Babu, this has taken
so much of your time

1529
02:28:17,180 --> 02:28:18,704
Don't embarrass me, Munim

1530
02:28:20,149 --> 02:28:22,117
Let me know if I can be
of any more service

1531
02:28:23,686 --> 02:28:28,680
By God's grace and your help,
everything's like it was before

1532
02:28:31,127 --> 02:28:34,028
Munim, begin to make preparations
for the wedding

1533
02:28:35,164 --> 02:28:38,463
The doctor says, tomorrow
we can bring Poonam home

1534
02:28:39,502 --> 02:28:42,767
Poonam can travel with you to Delhi
now and you have Dr Jain over there

1535
02:28:43,373 --> 02:28:47,207
About your married life, there
won't be any problems either

1536
02:28:49,445 --> 02:28:52,209
But I must discuss this with you

1537
02:28:53,316 --> 02:28:54,510
It's a bit personal

1538
02:28:56,119 --> 02:28:57,245
Prem,

1539
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:02,121
this grafting treatment, in
lay terms, plastic surgery,

1540
02:29:03,126 --> 02:29:04,252
is not magic

1541
02:29:05,728 --> 02:29:12,531
With time, every wound will heal, but
their marks will take time to go

1542
02:29:16,105 --> 02:29:19,472
Now Poonam will look at herself
through your eyes, Prem

1543
02:29:21,177 --> 02:29:22,371
I know it, Doctor

1544
02:29:41,097 --> 02:29:42,530
Aunty has come to
take you home, Poonam

1545
02:29:45,601 --> 02:29:46,659
Come home, my child

1546
02:29:47,203 --> 02:29:50,536
To your home..

1547
02:29:52,442 --> 02:29:53,704
where your mother lives

1548
02:30:22,136 --> 02:30:25,936
Look at the bridegroom..
so smart and debonair

1549
02:30:26,006 --> 02:30:29,999
He rides his mare, leaving
behind his motor car

1550
02:30:30,077 --> 02:30:32,045
Handsome as ever..

1551
02:30:32,113 --> 02:30:34,308
handsome as ever, he sparkles
in his attire

1552
02:30:34,382 --> 02:30:38,318
The bride waits at her doorstep,
ready to go with him

1553
02:30:38,386 --> 02:30:40,286
So come rejoice,

1554
02:30:43,057 --> 02:30:46,515
for the joys of new lovers

1555
02:30:55,436 --> 02:30:56,869
At your door..

1556
02:30:56,937 --> 02:30:58,370
he has come, asking for his bride

1557
02:30:59,039 --> 02:31:05,171
Welcome him with love.. Iove
so precious, like pearls

1558
02:31:05,246 --> 02:31:11,276
Welcome him, let your pleasure and
laughter show in your eyes..

1559
02:31:11,352 --> 02:31:16,881
welcome him with pride..

1560
02:31:16,957 --> 02:31:20,950
for he comes, seeking his bride

1561
02:31:29,503 --> 02:31:33,837
The wedding..

1562
02:31:33,908 --> 02:31:38,936
this is their sacred wedding

1563
02:31:39,013 --> 02:31:42,847
A glorious Rajah of Delhi comes..

1564
02:31:42,917 --> 02:31:46,080
to wed the queen of Madhupur

1565
02:31:47,388 --> 02:31:54,226
About to culminate is the
story of their pure love

1566
02:31:55,930 --> 02:32:02,335
About to culminate is the
story of their pure love

1567
02:32:02,403 --> 02:32:06,806
The flowers of joy have blossomed

1568
02:32:06,874 --> 02:32:12,005
'Twas journey upon a difficult path..

1569
02:32:12,079 --> 02:32:13,876
for these two loving hearts

1570
02:32:13,948 --> 02:32:16,508
he has come, asking for his bride

1571
02:32:16,984 --> 02:32:20,545
he has come, asking for his bride

1572
02:32:47,381 --> 02:32:50,214
For once last, she walks towards you,

1573
02:32:51,418 --> 02:32:54,546
yesterday's little faltering steps,
faltering again today..

1574
02:32:55,923 --> 02:32:59,051
at crossroads of a father's happiness,
there's still parting's pain..

1575
02:32:59,126 --> 02:33:03,062
when joy and sorrow mingle,
why do they show in tears?

1576
02:33:04,398 --> 02:33:11,236
when joy and sorrow mingle,
why do they show in tears?

1577
02:33:11,305 --> 02:33:15,799
Now Father, bid your goodbyes,
send away your daughter

1578
02:33:15,876 --> 02:33:18,811
Bid me fond farewells Father, send
your dear daughter away forever,

1579
02:33:18,879 --> 02:33:20,039
and bless my way

1580
02:33:20,114 --> 02:33:21,809
Now she leaves with her husband,

1581
02:33:21,882 --> 02:33:25,511
in her bride's palanquin,
he carries her away

1582
02:33:25,986 --> 02:33:29,478
in her bride's palanquin,
he carries her away

1583
02:33:34,461 --> 02:33:38,898
Krishnakant, I'm taking home
a daughter, not a daughter-in-law

1584
02:33:40,968 --> 02:33:44,995
Harishchandra, when fathers of
all sons begin to think like you,

1585
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:49,437
daughters will be called their
fathers' burdens no more

1586
02:34:07,394 --> 02:34:09,794
The moment of submission..

1587
02:34:09,863 --> 02:34:13,094
now arrives, o'bride

1588
02:34:16,270 --> 02:34:21,503
It's the mirror, it's also
the reflection of your mind

1589
02:34:21,875 --> 02:34:24,810
He is in the mirror..

1590
02:34:24,878 --> 02:34:27,472
mirrored everywhere

1591
02:34:28,882 --> 02:34:31,442
The one.. you gave your heart to..

1592
02:34:31,518 --> 02:34:34,453
..with him, now become
one in body and soul

1593
02:34:35,322 --> 02:34:40,157
Tonight, give him every
right he deserves

1594
02:34:40,227 --> 02:34:42,821
For neither of you..

1595
02:34:42,896 --> 02:34:46,161
are strangers any longer

1596
02:34:50,471 --> 02:34:56,410
Here comes the moment
of submission, o'bride

1597
02:35:01,081 --> 02:35:02,241
It's dressing-time, Poonam

1598
02:35:14,928 --> 02:35:16,122
I have the right, Poonam

1599
02:35:20,434 --> 02:35:27,237
We finally got the happiness
we were destined to find

1600
02:35:27,307 --> 02:35:34,338
Our night of love has come
to us after a test by fire

1601
02:35:34,982 --> 02:35:41,251
The Moon and stars will carry
our legend to all after us

1602
02:35:42,923 --> 02:35:48,987
Tonight, from this benign starlight,
let us seek our boon

1603
02:35:49,063 --> 02:35:54,228
A lifetime of love and roses,
you have the right

1604
02:35:56,437 --> 02:36:01,841
An eternity together..
you have the right

1605
02:36:03,343 --> 02:36:05,834
My love..

1606
02:36:05,913 --> 02:36:14,480
my heart sings your Song of Love

1607
02:36:32,973 --> 02:36:38,172
I have the right to look at you..

1608
02:36:40,114 --> 02:36:45,347
I have the right to
go on looking at you..

1609
02:36:46,987 --> 02:36:53,517
Beloved, beloved..

1610
02:36:54,094 --> 02:37:02,331
Beloved, beloved, my heart says,
you have the right..

1611
02:37:04,004 --> 02:37:10,204
You have the right..

1612
02:37:34,902 --> 02:37:41,307
This night is slowly fading
and melting away slowly..

1613
02:37:41,375 --> 02:37:49,043
Love is rising slowly..

1614
02:37:49,116 --> 02:37:55,316
What do these distances, say,
humming along, beloved..

1615
02:37:55,389 --> 02:38:02,557
What do these distances, say,
humming along, beloved..

1616
02:38:02,996 --> 02:38:08,366
I will keep you awake you
this night, I have the right..

1617
02:38:10,337 --> 02:38:16,139
I will steal the full moon,
I have the right..

1618
02:38:17,010 --> 02:38:23,142
Beloved, beloved..

1619
02:38:24,151 --> 02:38:32,251
Beloved, beloved, my heart says,
you have the right..

1620
02:38:33,994 --> 02:38:40,092
You have the right..
