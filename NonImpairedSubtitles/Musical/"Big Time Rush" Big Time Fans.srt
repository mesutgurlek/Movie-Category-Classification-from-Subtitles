1
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:04,593
Guys.

2
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:07,017
Here's a little thing
we like to call...

3
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:08,971
Fan mail!

4
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:10,346
No way!

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,456
"Dear Kendell, can you please,

6
00:00:16,457 --> 00:00:18,876
please, please, please,
please send a photo?"

7
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:21,764
"I love BTR, but mostly James."

8
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:23,531
Ha, she's wrong.

9
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,986
"Logan, you're my favorite.

10
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:30,462
P.S., please enjoy this
meatloaf I made for you."

11
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,770
Meatloaf!

12
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,284
"P.P.S., please give it to Carlos."

13
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:37,204
That is my meatloaf!
- No, you hate meatloaf!

14
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:41,502
Well I don't know about you guys,
but I'm sending my fan a photo.

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,231
Fan mail do's and don'ts.

16
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,989
Do keep it short and simple.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,929
Write things like,

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,408
"you rock too" and "hey, thanks."

19
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,096
Do sign your name.

20
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,722
All fans love autographs.

21
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:02,554
Don't give out any personal
information or advice.

22
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:06,609
Otherwise some crazed fan will
show up on your front doorstep

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,890
and ask you to help make them famous.

24
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:15,036
Jenny Tinkler?

25
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,535
Guys, I did it!

26
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:19,361
I packed up everything,
and I moved to L.A.

27
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:22,161
So you can help me be
famous like you promised.

So, fan girl,

47
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:18,364
which one of these lads
gave you advice,

48
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:21,896
and the address to my studio?

49
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:34,137
131, 132.

50
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:35,818
Yup, they're all here.

51
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:37,973
Get out. Ow, ow.

52
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:39,885
You told Jenny to come out to L.A.,

53
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:41,755
and we'll help her make
her dreams come true?

54
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:43,389
Not in those exact words.

55
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,109
"Jenny, come out to L.A., and we'll
help make your dreams come true."

56
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,936
I didn't think she would do it.

57
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:50,453
You wrote down the airline schedule

58
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:53,248
and turn-by-turn directions
to Rocque records.

59
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,734
Is the bad stuff over?

60
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:58,425
"P.S., we promise we'll help you."

61
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:02,048
What did we tell you about
making promises you can't keep?

62
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,609
But it's Jenny.

63
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,906
We love Jenny.

64
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:07,508
Plus, she said that
she was our biggest fan.

65
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:10,624
She did come all the way
to Chicago to come see us.

66
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,548
Yes, but it's Jenny.

67
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:15,514
You know what happens around Jenny.

68
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:19,772
<i>Bad things, bad things.</i>

69
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:20,968
Fine.

70
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:23,238
I'm gonna tell the girl who
we've been friends with,

71
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,111
since pre-k that you guys
don't want to help her,

72
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:30,208
and that she has to
go back to Minnesota.

73
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,615
Stop!

74
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,641
We are a team.

75
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,896
So if Carlos totally messes up

76
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:42,798
and promised we'd help her,
then we got to help her.

77
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,675
Yes.

78
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:45,896
Jenny!

79
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:54,919
Easy, Jenny, easy.
- Put it down. Put it down.

80
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,657
Wow, you do not hear trombone
playing like that every day.

81
00:03:58,658 --> 00:03:59,966
Not if you can help it.

82
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,564
But it's time for the big finale!

83
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:03,733
Oh, no!

84
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:12,188
It's starting.

85
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:16,599
Sorry.

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,378
People say I'm a little accident prone.

87
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,693
Get this out of here before it
destroys the rest of my studio!

88
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,489
Jenny, come on. Let's go
make your dreams come true.

89
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,780
You guys are the best.

90
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:30,091
Stop it.

91
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:35,227
I can't believe I'm
at the famous Palmwoods!

92
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:36,875
Oh!

93
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,249
Sorry.

94
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:45,379
She's lot less clumsy
than I remember.

95
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,017
Yeah. But remember, we love Jenny.

96
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:52,935
Yeah, and remember the second grade
when she broke my arm playing marbles?

97
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:54,393
Or the fifth grade when she gave me

98
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,429
the first paper cut in history
that required surgery,

99
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,891
and then, eighth grade...

100
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:01,594
Lab partners.

101
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,851
It took almost a year
for your hair to grow back.

102
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:04,926
I'm out!

103
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,279
Here are your keys.

104
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:13,460
Have a Palmwoods day.

105
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:16,331
Ooh, what a nice stapler.

106
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:19,403
Put it down, Jenny!
Put that thing down.

107
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,954
Sorry about that, bitters.

108
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:23,281
This whistling is driving me crazy!

109
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:29,252
Oh, come on!
- Great news!

110
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:33,016
The super is on strike, but he said
that trombone girl's thermostat finale

111
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:35,667
probably shorted the fans.

112
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,450
What is this?
- It's a wrench,

113
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:39,530
and the manual.

114
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:42,640
We have to fix it ourselves.
- Yeah, I don't do wrench.

115
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:46,391
Hey, this whistling
is driving me crazy!

116
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:51,871
Who are you?
- Death smash.

117
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:55,246
The world's most destructive band.

118
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,859
When we rented out the rehearsal space,

119
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,200
we didn't request an
idiot in a track suit

120
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:03,131
and whistle noises.

121
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:04,232
Huh?

122
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,654
You told me to make more
money for the studio, so...

123
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,904
If you don't fix the fan right quick,

124
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:12,415
we're going to show you
how destructive we can get.

125
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,518
And fix it we can!

126
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,486
Whistle be gone soon there, mates.

127
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:24,112
We know exactly how to fix the problem.

128
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,852
What is this thing called again?

129
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:35,904
Whoa, you're James
diamond from Big Time Rush.

130
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:37,534
I'm your biggest fan.

131
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:39,894
I don't think so.

132
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:42,010
Many of my fans are well over five feet.

133
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,451
Can I have your autograph?

134
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:48,750
Would you like futuristic postman,

135
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:51,557
or overeager haberdasher?

136
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:55,105
Actually, I was just wondering
if you could sign this?

137
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,027
Anything for my biggest fan.

138
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:04,781
James, can you please tell me
how you got to be so awesome?

139
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:07,735
Well, I was told not
to give fans advice.

140
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,938
But I like your style.

141
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:11,927
Awesomeness is 15% tan,

142
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:14,523
40% good attitude, 20% bad attitude,

143
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:17,888
and 50% imported hair care products.

144
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,811
That's 125%.

145
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:21,045
You bet it is.

146
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:23,552
I would love to be just like you.

147
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,982
What do you say you go get
us some low fat soy shakes,

148
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:29,222
and I give you more
tips on being awesome?

149
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:31,223
You got it, Mr. diamond.

150
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:35,409
Be careful of fans.

151
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,500
It comes from the word "fanatic,"

152
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:38,836
as in, "nut job."

153
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:40,211
I get what you're saying.

154
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:41,254
You have a huge crush on me,

155
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:43,798
and you're jealous
of my new biggest fan.

156
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,656
I don't have a crush on you.

157
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:47,585
I'm just saying that
you're 30% ignorant,

158
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,064
30% arrogant,

159
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,505
and 40% idiot.

160
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:52,489
So be careful of fans.

161
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:56,413
She so has a giant crush on me.

162
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,047
Okay, so Jenny's dream is to
become a lead singer of a band.

163
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:04,366
And L.A. is full of bands
looking for lead singers.

164
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,931
Yeah, there's just one problem.

165
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:07,560
She can't sing!

166
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:09,522
Do you remember freshmen choir?

167
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:14,722
♪ and birds will fly! ♪

168
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:20,579
right, so just need to find a band
who's looking for a horrible singer,

169
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,995
who may have been sent from
Voltraz to destroy the earth.

170
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:25,174
Whoa!

171
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:29,614
That always happens
when I make toast.

172
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,159
Can I make you some?

173
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,278
We're good.
- We're fine.

174
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,369
It's so exciting being in L.A.

175
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,589
And being neighbors.

176
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,572
Aw.

177
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,133
Oh, and now we have connecting rooms!

178
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:44,464
She's gonna kill us!

179
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,098
Not if we kill her first.

180
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:47,789
Nobody is killing anyone.

181
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,192
We can do this.

182
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:51,662
We never break a promise.

183
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,150
So stop promising stuff!

184
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:54,280
Get rid of it.

185
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:59,186
Your friend has been here for two hours,
and so far has trashed an elevator,

186
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:01,650
broken a water main,
ruined my favorite pen,

187
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,647
and started two fires.

188
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:04,516
What?

189
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:10,638
Make that three fires.

190
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,901
What?

191
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,538
Awesomeness takes
perspiration and inspiration,

192
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,943
which is why I always work out...

193
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:22,056
In front of my heroes.

194
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:24,630
I couldn't agree more.

195
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:27,817
Whew!

196
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:31,307
All right, now it's off to the salon

197
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:34,452
to get my number one fan his
own personal hair care system.

198
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:36,880
Wow! My own system!

199
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:43,086
I'm telling you,

200
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,152
there's something not
right in that kid's head.

201
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,798
Trust me. I have an
eye for these things.

202
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,964
Oh, yeah?

203
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,150
What do you see about me?

204
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:52,836
Besides great muscle tone.

205
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:55,370
You're too trusting,

206
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:57,423
and if you're not careful,
the next thing you know,

207
00:09:57,424 --> 00:10:00,549
super fan is smacking you upside
the head with a frying pan

208
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,509
and stealing your identity.

209
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:05,352
Or, your crush has
gotten bigger on me,

210
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:06,610
and now you're following me.

211
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:08,994
I don't have a crush on you!

212
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:11,354
Katie, your words do say "no,"

213
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:12,485
but your eyes say...

214
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,041
Flaven!

215
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,480
Why do I have to go in the ducts?

216
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:19,199
Because you fit!

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,872
Now disconnect the
bobbin from the stator...

218
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,121
In English!

219
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:26,745
I can't read manuals!

220
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:29,088
Just hit it with the wrench a few times.

221
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:33,634
Whoa!

222
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,323
Oh.

223
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:39,027
Well, the whistle's gone!

224
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:42,673
But now my studio is a wind tunnel!

225
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:46,766
No, no, no.

226
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:47,873
Don't worry.

227
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:50,893
We know someone that can
read manuals and fix stuff

228
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:52,749
and is really, really smart.

229
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:03,733
Call Logan.
- Got it.

230
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,467
So you guys wanted to
talk to me about my dreams?

231
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,109
Yes!

232
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,376
Gustavo needs me. I got to go.

233
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:16,857
Bye, Jenny!

234
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,129
Good luck.

235
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:30,490
Jenny, sometimes dreams change.

236
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,803
We wanted to be
professional hockey players,

237
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:34,157
and now we're singers.

238
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,520
You want to be a singer,

239
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,657
but maybe you should
be one of those people

240
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:40,220
who blows up buildings when
they need to make new ones.

241
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,970
But, guys, I'm a
much better singer now.

242
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:44,499
I've been taking lessons.

243
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,413
Want to hear?

244
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,342
Uh, sure.

245
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:50,361
Just give us one second.

246
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,036
Go ahead.

247
00:11:56,585 --> 00:12:01,116
♪ whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪

248
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:05,785
♪ I'm gonna shine for you ♪

249
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:10,443
♪ ah, ooh, ooh ♪

250
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:11,617
you're amazing!

251
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:13,314
Told you we'd make you a star!

252
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,818
Yes!
- Yeah!

253
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,299
Easy, Jenny!

254
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,518
Sorry.

255
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:35,966
We can fix that.

256
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:38,852
Come on.

257
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:48,033
Okay, let's look at the Palmwoods'
message board to find you a band.

258
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:53,594
Guitarist looking for female vocalist
to accompany him on Canadian tour.

259
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:55,656
I've always wanted to go to Canada!

260
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:58,312
And we've always wanted
you to go to Canada.

261
00:12:58,347 --> 00:12:59,282
Call.

262
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:04,069
Hello, I'm calling about
your ad for a female vocalist.

263
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,827
You don't sound female, dude.

264
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,065
Guitar dude?

265
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:10,920
I've been saving up for
this van for, like, three years

266
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:13,782
and I can finally go on tour!

267
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:16,864
Will you come see us in concert?

268
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:18,014
We promise.

269
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,481
We'll try.

270
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:24,607
I'm a singer!

271
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:27,156
Canada, here we come!

272
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:29,562
No, no, don't touch that!

273
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:35,216
So close.

274
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:36,953
Oh, Logan! Great, you're here.

275
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:38,969
Yeah, am I singing a new song?

276
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,172
Close.

277
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,283
Whoa.

278
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:47,361
Oy!

279
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:49,703
Are you the fan fix-it bloke?

280
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,188
Yep.

281
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:02,593
Comb!

282
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:05,487
Spray!

283
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,127
Mirror!

284
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:10,072
Not frying pan, dude.

285
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:11,361
Mirror.

286
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:23,409
I cannot believe that
we forgot about the hole.

287
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,221
That is it!

288
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:26,783
Either she's out today, on you're out.

289
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,038
Well, you can't kick us out,

290
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,444
because we have the
lease thing... stuff.

291
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:35,079
Yeah. Well, I've hired a
lawyer to break your lease

292
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,892
and thug to throw you out!

293
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:42,595
Ironically, the huge guy is the lawyer.

294
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,327
We promised we would
help make her a singer.

295
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:49,081
Break your promise.

296
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:50,628
Or...

297
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:57,810
So, guys, what's next?

298
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:00,453
Uh, Jenny.

299
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:02,545
We, um.

300
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:04,311
Kendell?

301
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:06,451
Uh, Jenny...

302
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,998
There's really not much
else we can do to help you.

303
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,747
We're really sorry.

304
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,918
Oh.

305
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:14,561
I understand.

306
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,982
But you were so great
trying to help out a friend

307
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:21,108
who should probably
to back to Minnesota.

308
00:15:31,672 --> 00:15:34,532
Why do I feel like I've been slammed
into the boards 19 times?

309
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,455
'Cause when you break a promise,

310
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:38,764
you can also break a heart.

311
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,453
Oooh, bumming, sadness.

312
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:44,375
Talk to me.

313
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,502
I promised a friend that
we'd help her become a singer,

314
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:48,016
which I will never do again.

315
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:50,939
And she's really accident prone,
she almost killed us,

316
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,094
and we really just want
to find her a singing job.

317
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,063
Preferably on another continent.

318
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:58,051
Oh, well have you tried calling
any international agents?

319
00:15:58,052 --> 00:15:59,275
International... wha?

320
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:03,171
Yeah, there's a huge demand for
American talent all over the world.

321
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:08,680
We're an entertaining people.

322
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:10,660
You get the agent cards.
I'll get Jenny.

323
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:11,829
Move!

324
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:20,319
You are not gonna get away with this!

325
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,254
And what is it that you're
trying to get away with?

326
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:25,034
I'm gonna take your
place in Big Time Rush.

327
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,443
We tour the world, and I go solo,

328
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,762
start a movie career,

330
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:35,565
That's my plan!

331
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:38,084
Wait, they're gonna
ask what happened to me.

332
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:39,080
Ha!

333
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:41,381
Not after they read
this letter you signed

334
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:44,346
which says you're off to Antarctica
to save the caribou.

335
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,103
I'm three feet taller than you!

336
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,023
I'm gonna wear a lot of socks.

337
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,336
Darn, I taught you well.

Ooh, biscuits.

343
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:03,461
Hello, Jenny Tinkler.

344
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:04,346
Have a good night.

345
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:06,286
Hi, thank you so much
for coming this evening.

346
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:08,501
Jenny Tinkler. Enjoy the show.

347
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:12,946
Okay, so since you're
a bit accident prone,

348
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:15,335
and we'd putting L.A.
in danger by taking you

349
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:16,745
to see the international agents...

350
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:19,986
We're bringing the
international agents to you.

351
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:24,629
And you're sure this bubble wrap look
is the hottest thing in Europe?

352
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,692
Yes.

353
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:28,676
Remember, do it
just like we rehearsed.

354
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:32,036
Right! Just sing, and
don't touch a thing.

355
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:32,881
Break a leg.

356
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:34,449
No, don't break a leg.

357
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,756
Don't break anything.

358
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:51,037
And finally, an explosion
at the famous Palmwoods

359
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:54,365
has hospitalized Hollywood's
top international agents.

360
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,293
This news has sent global
stock markets plummeting

361
00:17:57,294 --> 00:18:01,185
on fears of a shortage of American
night club talent overseas,

362
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:04,230
since we are such an
entertaining people.

363
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:07,394
Where's James?

364
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,209
You're looking at him.

365
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,150
And I know you like what you see.

366
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:13,649
I meant the real James.

367
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,699
This is prime sun tanning time,

368
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,086
and James should be in his favorite
chair destroying skin cells.

369
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,571
It's all in this letter James signed

370
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:25,287
which says he's going to
Antarctica to save the caribou.

371
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,649
First off, there are
no caribou in Antarctica.

372
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,787
And, second, tell me where
James is, you little freak.

373
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:35,087
I'm James now.

374
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:38,826
Get used to it, 'cause there's
nothin' you can do about it.

375
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,639
Ow, ow, ow!

376
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,295
He's in the basement. He's in the
basement, he's in the basement!

377
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:44,956
Thank you, Katie.

378
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,266
Oh, thank you so much.

379
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:50,091
He was so tiny and evil!

380
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:52,506
And if there anything I can do for you,

381
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,373
let me know.

382
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:54,730
Actually...

383
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:57,723
Can I have your autograph?

384
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,966
Anything for my biggest fan.

385
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:02,827
Great!

386
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:05,593
You just agreed to let me be
your manager when you go solo,

387
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:08,279
endorse a line of hair care
products to be developed later,

388
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,747
and swear that I don't, nor
have I ever, had a crush on you.

389
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,075
I've got to stop signing autographs.

390
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:23,623
Ah, no!

391
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,249
Whoa, whoa!

392
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,036
You are now officially
thrown out of the Palmwoods.

393
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:31,877
I never want to see her here again.

394
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:33,451
Have a Palmwoods day!

395
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:35,832
No, no, no.

396
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:40,065
My dreams are crushed, so
now I'll sleep on the streets.

397
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,538
Welcome to Hollywood.

398
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:44,670
Nobody is sleeping
on the streets tonight.

399
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:46,237
You can crash at Rocque records.

400
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:48,171
By "crash," he means "sleep."

401
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:49,799
Is that a dog biscuit?

402
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,546
You know, it's really quite tasty.

403
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,282
Is that bacon and cheese?

404
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,815
All right, I've boosted
the power off the main grid,

405
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:06,455
which should create a reverse thrust
from the building's primary fan,

406
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,581
which will then...

407
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,376
Just push the button!

408
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:10,609
Okay.

409
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:17,926
It's a little bit sensitive.

410
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:19,533
That's it!

411
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:23,893
Now it's time to fix that
fan death smash style!

412
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:38,166
Whoa, what's going on?

413
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,708
What's going on?

414
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,368
Shut it off!

415
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:46,488
Shut it off!

416
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,194
Shut it off!

417
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:55,550
I'm going to destroy you!

418
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:10,403
It worked!

419
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:13,460
Yeah, all right!

420
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,258
We did it, we did it, we did it!

421
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:16,481
Oy!

422
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:22,898
Please kill us gently.

423
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,898
Eh, we hated Johnny.

424
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:27,616
He made me smash guitars.

425
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:30,460
He made me
speak with a British accent.

426
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:33,546
But without him I guess we'll
have to cancel the European tour.

427
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:35,760
Unless an amazing lead singer

428
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,775
who's super destructive
just falls from the sky.

429
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:45,096
Sorry.

430
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,908
Jenny, are you okay?

431
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:49,362
Is she okay?

432
00:21:49,363 --> 00:21:51,256
She's amazing!

433
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,550
Quick, Jenny, sing!

434
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:54,453

435

436

younger audience we're looking for.

438
00:22:04,471 --> 00:22:07,016
Welcome to death smash!

439
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:13,139
No, Jenny!
- Hey, hey, hey!

440
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:16,484
Come on, Jenny, let's go get
permission from your mum.

441
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:24,812
Well, it looks like this story
is wrapping up quite nicely.

442
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:28,176
And I will never, ever
over promise again.

443
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:29,451
I promise.

444
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:34,611
Buddy Simmons?

445
00:22:34,612 --> 00:22:35,549
Hey, guys!

446
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,767
Carlos promised me he'd help

447
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:39,952
with my dream of becoming
a famous jazz tuba player.

448
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:43,608
He said he was our biggest fan.

449
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:51,707
Synch by Benfo.
