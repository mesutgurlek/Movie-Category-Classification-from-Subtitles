1
00:00:04,836 --> 00:00:06,052
House seats to sectionals.

2
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:07,255
Those things are hard to come by.

3
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:09,639
Scalpers are getting, like,
five bucks for them.

4
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:14,086
I however, as coach of one of
the competing teams, get two,

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,505
and I would be honored if
you would be my plus one.

6
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,423
I mean, you being at sectionals

7
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:20,728
is-is kind of a good
luck charm for us.

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,711
I would love to.

9
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:24,406
I mean, not that we're
gonna need any talismans.

10
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,420
I have a killer set list planned.

11
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:27,698
First... no, let me guess.

12
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:29,861
Finn and Rachel are gonna
do a ballad, right?

13
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:30,971
Followed by the kids joining in

14
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:33,413
with a classic rock number
where Mercedes will belt out

15
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:34,976
the last jaw-dropping note.

16
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:36,154
Have you been going
through my desk?

17
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:37,250
It's what you always do.

18
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:39,560
Every team tries to showcase
their strongest players.

19
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,421
Look, just seeing your kids
do the rocky horror thing

20
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:44,288
really reminded me of how much
talent you've got in Glee club.

21
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:46,593
Quinn has a beautiful voice,

22
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:48,526
and Mike Chang has
dance moves that are

23
00:00:48,527 --> 00:00:49,891
to die for.

24
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:50,803
Look, I'm sure that you know

25
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:53,052
what you're doing;
I'm not saying that.

26
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,144
Everyone has picked you as
favorites for sectionals,

27
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:56,794
you won your sectional last year.

28
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:59,461
It's just, I don't know, you
guys used to be the underdogs.

29
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:01,729
Now you're a real team,
which is wonderful.

30
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:03,963
You're a constellation of stars.

31
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:05,811
I would just hate to think

32
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:07,800
that you might be
ignoring some of them

33
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:11,179
because they don't burn
quite as obviously bright.

34
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:15,195
I've said too much.

35
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:16,266
No.

36
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:19,658
You said just enough.

37
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:22,904
Mr. Schuester,
I have an announcement.

38
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,648
I've selected the
perfect moving ballad

39
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:27,334
for Finn and I to sing to launch
our performance at sectionals.

40
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,269
Me first. Two things:

41
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,685
First, our competition
at sectionals

42
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:32,277
are your classic stool choirs.

43
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:34,435
Great voices, but they don't move.

44
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:35,328
Now, if we're gonna beat them,

45
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,008
we need to do what
they can't: Dance.

46
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,111
Which is why I've
decided to feature

47
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:43,385
Brittany and Mike Chang's sweet
moves in our performance.

48
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:45,812
Wait, they're gonna dance in
front of me while I sing my solo?

49
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:47,776
You're not getting a solo for
this competition, Rachel.

50
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:50,523
Finally. So what song
do I get to sing?

51
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:52,982
I was thinking that the winners
of our duets competitions

52
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:54,227
would take the leads.

53
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,743
Ken and Barbie?

54
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,748
A-are you trying to throw this?

55
00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:00,160
You used to be just sort
of unlikable, but now

56
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,728
I pretty much feel
like punching you

57
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,690
every time you open your mouth.

58
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:06,094
Okay, listen,
I have talked the talk

59
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,751
about everyone in here feeling
special for over a year now,

60
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:11,117
but, frankly,
I haven't walked the walk.

61
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:13,224
I mean, we have got a
lot of talent here,

62
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:14,442
and I'm gonna highlight it.

63
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:15,392
Do something!

64
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:17,963
Look, I'm all for
pumping up the team,

65
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:20,529
making everyone feel special,
but that's for practice.

66
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,094
You don't take the
star quarterback out

67
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:23,117
- before the big game.
- Yep.

68
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:25,561
Easy to say when you're
the star quarterback.

69
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,772
This isn't just about me,
this is about the team.

70
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,323
You are such a hypocrite.

71
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:31,009
Like you even know
what that means.

72
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,620
It means that your boyfriend
is full of crap, hobbit.

73
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,301
You know what,
ever since the wedding,

74
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,149
you've been up my butt,
and I'm sick of it!

75
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,355
Come on, Rachel,
she's not worth it.

76
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,315
Oh, really?

77
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:40,734
'Cause that's not what you thought

78
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:42,328
last year in that motel room.

79
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,538
That's right, Yentl,

80
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:46,883
your sweetheart...
he's been lying to you.

81
00:02:46,884 --> 00:02:49,096
'Cause he and I totally
got it on last year.

82
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:50,961
Okay, enough already.

83
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:56,059
No more conversations about this,
or-or anything.

84
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,913
This is our plan for sectionals,

85
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,162
and that is that.

86
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,552
Mike, Brittany,

87
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,183
come on up, let's
start choreographing.

88
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:21,747
And now let's welcome the
newest addition to the warblers,

89
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,215
Kurt Hummel.

90
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:35,902
And our oldest tradition
for our newest warbler,

91
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:37,299
an actual warbler.

92
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,885
Kurt, meet Pavarotti.

93
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:42,137
This bird is a member of an
unbroken line of canaries

94
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,752
who have been at
Dalton since 1891.

95
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,979
It's your job to take care of him

96
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,479
so he can live to carry
on the warbler legacy.

97
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:50,999
Protect him.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,507
That bird is your voice.

99
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:53,931
Hey, I'll bring him
to work with me.

100
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,510
Weekends I volunteer
at a stray cat rescue.

101
00:03:58,247 --> 00:03:59,536
It's at the bottom of a coal mine.

102
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:01,261
That was a joke.

103
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:03,297
I-I don't, I don't
work at a coal mine.

104
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:05,443
Let the council come to order.

105
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,810
Today we discuss the set
list for sectionals.

106
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:08,448
Council?

107
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,876
We don't have a director.

108
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:12,312
Every year, we elect three
upperclassmen to lead the group.

109
00:04:12,313 --> 00:04:13,871
But don't worry, we all get a say.

110
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:15,254
Oh, fantastic.

111
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,774
I have a lot of ideas.

112
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:18,587
Warblers, if I may?

113
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:20,980
Now, I can't deny that
the warblers' vocals

114
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,774
are absolutely dreamy.

115
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:24,439
But I believe our
set for sectionals

116
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,422
this year should have a
little more showbiz panache.

117
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:29,739
I think we should open with
"Rio" by Duran Duran.

118
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,205
Uh, the council is responsible
for song selection.

119
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,449
But we appreciate
your enthusiasm, Kurt.

120
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,734
It'll come in handy one day

121
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,507
when you're sitting
behind this desk.

122
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:41,787
Now, I propose we do our
entire set at sectionals

123
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:43,266
in eight-part harmony.

124
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:45,933
Just tell me if it's true.

125
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,199
I'm sorry.

126
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:51,671
Okay? I shouldn't
have lied to you.

127
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:53,008
I just thought that if
I told you the truth,

128
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,143
you'd get so mad at me,
and you're kind of scary.

129
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:58,340
Don't you see how it's
ten times worse now?

130
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:00,033
Why her?

131
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,468
I mean, Quinn I'd understand,

132
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,460
but her?

133
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,627
Do you think she's
prettier than me?

134
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:05,721
Don't answer that.

135
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:09,228
My dads went to couples
counseling because one of them

136
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:11,229
put up wallpaper in the den
without asking the other,

137
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,716
and they said it was the
only thing that kept them

138
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:13,449
from killing each other.

139
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,799
- Okay.
- We need your help.

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,375
Uh, that's why I set up
this counseling session.

141
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:19,180
You're both in Glee.

142
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:22,146
Why don't you sing about it?

143
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,344
Right? Aren't there
some great songs

144
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:25,961
about betrayal or something?

145
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,720
I'm pretty sure there's
some eagles songs.

146
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,457
Right, let's do plan b.

147
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,689
We'll start with you, Finn.

148
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,306
Why did you lie to Rachel?

149
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,483
I didn't want to hurt her.

150
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:37,341
Then why did you do it with her?

151
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:39,250
Why are you so caught up with
who it was? It doesn't...

152
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,310
Was it because she's hot?

153
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,945
Yeah, sure, she's super hot,

154
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:43,058
but, um, that's...

155
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,687
As a therapist,

156
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,223
is it productive for me
to slap him right now?

157
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,213
Well, I'm not a therapist, but no.

158
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:54,831
Um, maybe you should storm out.

159
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:55,606
Yeah.

160
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,800
Is there anything else
you want to talk about?

161
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:12,881
What are you doing? We've
been looking for you all day.

162
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:14,688
I'm paralyzed with fear.

163
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,125
I've been here since
second period.

164
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,065
I really, really have to pee.

165
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,114
What are you afraid of?

166
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:21,568
You're gonna be
featured at sectionals.

167
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:22,666
You should be happy.

168
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,006
I can't handle the pressure.

169
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:26,573
I know I'm more talented
than all of you...

170
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:27,903
Britney Spears taught me that.

171
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:31,851
It's just, I can't have whether
we win or lose on my shoulders.

172
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,557
B-but we all know you can do it.

173
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:34,880
And I know that I can't.

174
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,801
Just like I know the
cricket that reads to me

175
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,871
at night is totally
stealing my jewelry.

176
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,465
It's really too bad I...

177
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:44,770
I can't give you my magic comb.

178
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,228
What's a magic comb?

179
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:48,918
You've never heard
of a magic comb?

180
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,592
Mm-mm. You comb your hair with it,

181
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:51,777
and you can't lose.

182
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:53,710
I'd give you mine,

183
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,507
but I need it.

184
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:56,539
Wait.

185
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,544
Since you're going to dance
the lead at sectionals,

186
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,814
you win, I win.

187
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:03,500
Please, can I have the magic comb?

188
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:10,745
Here.

189
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:12,897
Artie, thank you so much.

190
00:07:13,187 --> 00:07:15,167
You really are the
best boyfriend ever.

191
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,966
We're gonna win this thing

192
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:21,358
'cause of you.

193
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:24,478
All I can say is I didn't
steal that soda machine,

194
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,766
and if I did, I wasn't alone.

195
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,090
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that I
didn't hear that because if I did,

196
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:30,113
I'd be down to ten
Glee club members,

197
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:31,627
which as you probably
remember from the rule book

198
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:33,719
is two less than what we need
to compete at sectionals.

199
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,154
I'm not big on reading rule books.

200
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,832
Well, I'm not big on reading.

201
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,135
Kurt's gone,
and he's not coming back.

202
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,038
We need a 12th member.

203
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,926
Now, I always go to Rachel
and Finn in these situations,

204
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:46,504
but you might be the most well-
known kid in this entire school.

205
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:48,468
There's a method to my madness.

206
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,312
I want you to use that madness
to recruit a new member.

207
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:54,005
Glee needs you to
be its ambassador.

208
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,965
More like its am-bad-ass-ador.

209
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:59,405
- But what's in it for me?
- You love the Glee club.

210
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,083
We get a new member and we win,

211
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:02,784
you get to keep
doing what you love.

212
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,433
You can count on me, Mr. Shue.

213
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:09,325
Hey, Kurt, wait up!

214
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,601
I saw that Glee club
was hard for you today,

215
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:15,578
seeing your ideas
shot down like that.

216
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,208
It's just a different
energy in there.

217
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:18,339
Not better or worse,

218
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,159
just something I'll
have to get used to.

219
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,621
We recognize that.

220
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:22,980
And we have a tradition
at this school

221
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:24,808
of rewarding a student
with a good attitude.

222
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,195
So, we would like to invite
you to audition for a solo.

223
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:29,228
For sectionals?

224
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,014
For sectionals.
Sing something good.

225
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:35,173
All right, listen up.

226
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,941
Are you gonna light your
farts on fire again?

227
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,335
Because I'm a major fan.

228
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:39,532
I want to talk to you guys.

229
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,102
About Bruce Springsteen.

230
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:41,885
Is this going somewhere?

231
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,156
Don't push me, Karofsky.

232
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,558
You forced my boy
Kurt out of here,

233
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,871
and juvie or no,
you're already number one

234
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:47,287
on my list to go
all death star on.

235
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:52,214
Anyways, so Bruce is destined to
go blue collar his whole life,

236
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,768
but instead, he goes and buys
an old strat from a pawn shop

237
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,296
and just starts wailing on it,

238
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:58,905
starts putting all the pain and
the promises and the dreams

239
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,724
into that music,
and the next thing he knows,

240
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:03,436
he's on the cover of time and
newsweek in the same week.

241
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:05,158
Those are magazines.

242
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,809
Not to seem redundant,
but is this going somewhere?

243
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,179
Glee club, dudes.

244
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,216
It's time to join up.

245
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,711
Sign up for Glee club?

246
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:13,864
Why don't you come to
my church on Sunday

247
00:09:13,865 --> 00:09:16,183
and get some of my cousins
to sign up for the klan?

248
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:18,514
Glee club is cool.

249
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:20,836
Glee club is most
definitely not cool.

250
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:23,806
Clearly we need to reinstate
the 10:00 A.M. slushie.

251
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:26,304
I say we make an example of him.

252
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,000
I say you're right.

253
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,317
Get him! Get him!

254
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:31,698
Not the face! Not the face!

255
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:33,765
Where's puck? I haven't
seen him since yesterday,

256
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,039
and I need him to get me a churro.

257
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,086
My guess is he'd rather quit
Glee club than lose sectionals,

258
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,343
and I can't blame him.

259
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:41,457
Our set's gonna be real
light on the Mercedes.

260
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,017
I'm telling you,
if the warblers win sectionals,

261
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:44,423
it's only because
we gave them Kurt.

262
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:45,406
We should not clap.

263
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:47,010
If we lose,
we should throw possums.

264
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:53,020
Rachel, what are you doing?

265
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,546
I'm not doing anything.

266
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,487
You've silenced my talents,
I'm merely protesting.

267
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,494
My talents are
wasted in this club.

268
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:05,207
My star shines too bright, and I
think you're threatened by it.

269
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,591
Take that off!

270
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,068
I'm tired of this, Rachel.

271
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,864
You have a terrible attitude,

272
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:12,056
you're a lousy sport,
and it is not okay anymore.

273
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:13,230
Well, I'm upset!

274
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:14,829
I'm furious about this!

275
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,859
About a couple of things,
actually.

276
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,247
Well, I'm sorry
you're disappointed.

277
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:21,167
But you know, you could also
make the choice to be happy

278
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:22,808
that we're a part of
a Glee club that is

279
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:24,677
bursting at the seams with talent.

280
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:26,580
There's an awful lot of
"me" talk going around.

281
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:27,352
"What's in it for me?

282
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:29,018
What solo am I gonna sing?"

283
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:32,574
Now, when we go to sectionals,
we're gonna be good sports.

284
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,664
We'll cheer on the hipsters,

285
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,843
we'll cheer on Kurt
and the warblers.

286
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,815
And if they win,

287
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:38,466
we will congratulate them.

288
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:40,834
Because that's who we are.

289
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,414
Dude, where have you been?

290
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:43,894
I found him in a porta potty.

291
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,596
I was trying to find Kurt's
replacement for sectionals.

292
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:54,484
I was trapped in that
porta potty for 24 hours.

293
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:59,098
Buddha, Allah, Satan, help me!

294
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,461
Are you an angel?

295
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:10,055
Screw you.

296
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:15,092
So I asked her if
she wanted to join.

297
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,533
Here are my conditions:

298
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:17,942
A carton of Cadbury eggs.

299
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,294
Good luck finding them.
They're not in season.

300
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:23,324
And I want seven
minutes in heaven...

301
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,274
With you.

302
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:30,390
I have to say,
she kinda rocked my world.

303
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:36,033
Okay, guys, um, well, looks
like we're back in business!

304
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:38,067
Let's all welcome
our newest member,

305
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:39,427
Ms. Lauren Zizes.

306
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,083
Puck, nice work.

307
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:45,464
We owe you one.

308
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,594
Did I tell you he
bought me dinner after?

309
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:05,833
You okay?

310
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:07,146
Why are you talking to me?

311
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:08,549
Are you gonna steal
something from me?

312
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,406
Look, after six hours
in that port-o-john,

313
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:11,902
Ozzy himself would
have turned to God.

314
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,407
I prayed. I promised him

315
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:16,605
that if he got me out of there,
I'd start being nicer to people.

316
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,358
Then I realized there was
no way I could do that,

317
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,402
so I changed it to just Jews.

318
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:21,639
It's Finn.

319
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,027
Boyfriend troubles?
I got that covered.

320
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,696
Considering I'm usually
the cause of them,

321
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:26,987
I'd say I'm an expert.

322
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:28,517
Walk with me.

323
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:33,920
Have you been working out?

324
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,049
Your arms seem bigger.

325
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:37,980
It's the steroids.

326
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:43,349
We have a big problem.

327
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,104
Is the problem your outfit?

328
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:46,878
Because you look like a
cheerleader zombie corpse.

329
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,242
I have no choice.
Mike Chang likes cheerleaders.

330
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,733
You of all people should know.

331
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:52,069
He's having an
affair with Brittany.

332
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,500
What? You crazy.

333
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,460
You haven't noticed her
ignoring you lately?

334
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:56,723
Not really. It's shark week.

335
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:57,535
They're inseparable.

336
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:58,805
They're doing a number
together at sectionals.

337
00:12:58,806 --> 00:12:59,957
- They've been rehearsing.
- Really?

338
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:01,641
Just rehearsing?

339
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:04,436
Exhibit a. I kissed him,
and it tasted like lip smackers.

340
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:05,973
You know who wears lip
smackers? Brittany.

341
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:06,793
And she doesn't mind sharing.

342
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:07,933
I love borrowing her lip smackers.

343
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:08,887
It's like candy for your lips.

344
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,081
Don't be naive, Artie.

345
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,323
She's a cheerleader,
he's a football player.

346
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,705
You and I never had a
chance at either of them.

347
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,998
Hey, Rachel.
I've been looking for you.

348
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,866
Don't bother spying
on me to get a leg up,

349
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:31,940
because the only solos that I'm
getting for sectionals are in my mind.

350
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,710
Actually, I was hoping
you could help me.

351
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:35,251
I've been sitting in
my car for over an hour

352
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:37,120
waiting for Karofsky to
make a Mickey D's run.

353
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:39,278
I've been invited to
audition for a solo.

354
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,810
Why should I help you? I mean,
you're our competition now.

355
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:43,590
Because even though
we hate each other,

356
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:45,027
we've had our moments,

357
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:46,777
and I could use your expertise.

358
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:49,014
And no one knows how to kill
a ballad quite like you.

359
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:52,367
You are as brilliant and
talented as you are irritating.

360
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:54,524
Considering that this
might be my only chance

361
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:58,328
to sing for a little while,
I'll give you a couple of tips.

362
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,162
So, what did you,
uh, have in mind?

363
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:02,484
I've settled on Celine Dion's classic
"my heart will go on."

364
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,975
Oh, no. No, no, no.

365
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:04,838
- No?
- Listen, you need something

366
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,457
much more personal than that.

367
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,760
I mean, this is about you.

368
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,883
Do you ever fantasize
about your own funeral?

369
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:11,063
- No.
- I do.

370
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:13,841
Finn throwing himself into
the grave out of grief,

371
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:16,246
and all of the heartfelt
speeches and the regrets.

372
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:17,030
That's insane.

373
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:18,744
Clearly no one in the
Glee club appreciates me.

374
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:21,549
Is it so wrong for me to fantasize
about them finally realizing

375
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,742
how amazing I am,
but it being too late?

376
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,140
And there's only one song
that expresses those feelings.

377
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:30,377
I'm sure that it's
in here somewhere.

378
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:31,333
Oh...

379
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:37,186
* It won't be easy *

380
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:40,889
* You'll think it strange *

381
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:46,568
* When I try to explain how I feel *

382
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,375
* That I still need your love *

383
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:53,766
* After all that I've done *

384
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:58,873
* You won't believe me *

385
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:04,428
* All you will see is
the girl you once knew *

386
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:10,052
* Although she's dressed
up to the nines *

387
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:17,156
* At sixes and sevens with you *

388
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:26,448
* I had to let it happen,
I had to change... *

389
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:32,209
* Couldn't stay all
my life down at heel *

390
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,162
* Looking out of the window *

391
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:40,395
* Staying out of the sun *

392
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:45,697
* So I chose freedom *

393
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:51,492
* Running around,
trying everything new *

394
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,612
* But nothing impressed me *

395
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:57,451
* At all *

396
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:04,619
* I never expected it to... *

397
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:10,912
* Don't cry for me, Argentina *

398
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:13,030
* The truth is *

399
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:16,428
* I never left you *

400
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:19,478
* All through my wild days *

401
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,266
* My mad existence *

402
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:25,114
* I kept my promise *

403
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:29,771
* Don't keep your distance *

404
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:37,662
* Don't cry for me, Argentina *

405
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:43,128
* The truth is, I never left you *

406
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:46,000
* All through my wild days *

407
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,711
* My mad existence *

408
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:51,620
* I kept my promise *

409
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:56,785
* Don't keep your distance *

410
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,151
* Have I said too much? *

411
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:05,063
* There's nothing
more I can think of *

412
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:07,962
* To say to you *

413
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:14,664
* But all you have to do *

414
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:17,150
* Is look at me to know *

415
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:20,580
* That every word *

416
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,581
* Is true... *

417
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,550
So how many times have
you guys auditioned?

418
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,599
Three.

419
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:45,811
Six.

420
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:48,265
Hey, guys.

421
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:49,819
Nick, Jeff,

422
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:51,287
congrats, you're moving on.

423
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:52,848
Oh, dude.

424
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:55,368
Thank you.

425
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:57,281
Congratulations. Thank you.

426
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,125
Any sage advice?

427
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:04,353
Don't try so hard next time.

428
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:07,106
I didn't realize that
caring was frowned upon.

429
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:09,041
I don't know how it
worked at your old school,

430
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:12,295
but did you notice that we all
wear uniforms around here?

431
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:14,858
It's about being part of the team.

432
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,314
I guess I'm just used to having
to scream to get noticed.

433
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:19,567
You're not going to
make it as a warbler

434
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,363
if all you care about
is getting noticed.

435
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,999
You're right, I'm sorry.

436
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:26,865
I know it's going to take
some getting used to,

437
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:28,803
but you'll fit in soon enough,

438
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:30,493
I promise.

439
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:36,435
How's the number for
sectionals coming?

440
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:37,045
Hi.

441
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:38,449
Um, yeah, it's good.

442
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,346
Wait, do you maybe want
to see a movie tonight?

443
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,901
Uh, I can't,
I have rehearsal with Mike.

444
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:44,934
Well, how about a latte
tomorrow morning?

445
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:47,649
Artie, I can't, and I can't
talk right now either.

446
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,587
I have to go rehearse.
I'm really, really sorry.

447
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:06,403
Hey. Something wrong?

448
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,134
I'm beginning to think
my new directions

449
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,517
for the new directions
was a terrible idea.

450
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:12,685
Oh, no. We're off to sectionals,
and I have...

451
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:14,925
I've never seen the
kids so out of sync.

452
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,235
You look great, though.

453
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:18,085
Ready to go?

454
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:19,627
I can't.

455
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:21,773
Why?

456
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,616
I didn't tell Carl I
was going with you.

457
00:19:25,952 --> 00:19:28,726
Ever since rocky horror he's
had some issues with you,

458
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,951
you know, with us
spending time together,

459
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:33,108
and, um, actually,
it was counseling Finn and Rachel

460
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,367
that made me realize that

461
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:36,895
sometimes the
withholding of the truth

462
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:38,907
can make someone
fellas bad as lying,

463
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:41,592
so I told him the truth last night

464
00:19:41,593 --> 00:19:42,859
and we had a big fight.

465
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:47,377
Then we made up and... then
he told me that he loved me...

466
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:50,888
And then I told him
that I love him back.

467
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:58,374
Well, we're going to
miss our good luck charm.

468
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,389
Mr. Schuester,

469
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,091
not that I really care,
but if we don't leave now,

470
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:05,609
we're going to miss
the competition.

471
00:20:08,994 --> 00:20:10,095
Good luck. Okay.

472
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:10,875
Yeah, thanks.

473
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:24,912
Then go down to
7-Eleven and get some.

474
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,504
I need raisinets.

475
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:27,688
Carb loading?

476
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,462
Puck got Lauren Zizes
to take your place

477
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,080
and she won't go on unless
she gets her damn candy.

478
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:35,416
She's a warm body.

479
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,841
Hey, did you, uh, get your solo?

480
00:20:37,842 --> 00:20:38,814
Sadly, no.

481
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:39,999
Oh, wow, if you didn't get a solo,

482
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,504
then they must be really good.

483
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:42,713
We are doomed.

484
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:44,482
Sorry, that was selfish.

485
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,949
What I meant to say was, "wow,
that, that really sucks.

486
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,332
I'm, I'm sure you
were really good."

487
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,656
I was... I mean, I think I was.

488
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:53,441
Being in the warblers has
really made me question

489
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:54,903
everything I thought about myself.

490
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:56,263
Yeah.

491
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,642
What has become of us, Kurt?

492
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,592
So do you miss us?

493
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:04,727
I do.

494
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:05,531
Being a warbler is great,

495
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,284
but I don't think they
appreciate my individuality

496
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:09,558
as much as you guys did,

497
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,119
and I can't help but think

498
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,367
that I let you guys down.

499
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,719
It's your life, Kurt,

500
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,228
and you weren't safe
at McKinley anymore

501
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:16,441
and we all get it.

502
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,229
How come you were
never this nice to me

503
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,468
when I was your teammate?

504
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,315
Because you were my
only real competition.

505
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:23,405
Hmm, yeah, true.

506
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:24,798
Aw...

507
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:31,634
So how's Finn?

508
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:32,569
I feel bad.

509
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,216
I haven't spoken to
him since the wedding.

510
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:36,991
I haven't really talked
to him much either.

511
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:39,099
I found out that he and Santana

512
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,952
were romantically involved
and he lied to me about it.

513
00:21:41,953 --> 00:21:43,312
Wait, you didn't know about that?

514
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,111
Kurt, they're calling places.

515
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:46,077
Hey.

516
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:47,426
Thanks again, Rachel.

517
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,407
* Every generation *

518
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,280
* Blames the one before *

519
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:07,896
* And all of their frustrations *

520
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:11,944
* Come beating on your door *

521
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,504
* I know that I'm a prisoner *

522
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:18,988
* To all my father held so dear *

523
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:21,308
* I know that I'm a hostage *

524
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:23,823
* To all his hopes and fears *

525
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:26,890
* I just wish I could
have told him *

526
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:31,294
* In the living years *

527
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:34,969
* Say it, say it, say it loud *

528
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,184
* Say it loud *

529
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:40,632
* Say it clear... *

530
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:44,283
* Say it, say it, say it *

531
00:22:44,284 --> 00:22:47,079
* You can listen
You can listen *

532
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,832
* As well as you hear
As well as you can hear *

533
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,078
* Hey, you got to
realize that it's true *

534
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,159
* Come on, come on
Say it loud *

535
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,839
* Say it, say it, say it
Say it loud *

536
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:00,887
* Say it clear
Say... *

537
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:02,141
* Say it. *

538
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:12,195
And now, for our second
performance of the program,

539
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:14,483
from Dalton academy
in Westerville,

540
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,194
the warblers.

541
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:19,647
* Hey *

542
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,288
* Hey *

543
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:24,942
* Hey *

544
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,039
* Tonight *

545
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,510
* Hey
Hey *

546
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:31,257
* Hey
Hey *

547
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:32,735
* Hey *

548
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:33,964
* Hey *

549
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:36,170
* Hey... hey... hey... *

550
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,753
* Your lipstick stains *

551
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:43,956
* On the front lobe of
my left-side brain *

552
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:47,202
* I knew I wouldn't forget you *

553
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:48,567
* And so I went *

554
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:52,373
* And let you blow my mind *

555
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:55,282
* Let you blow my mind *

556
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:58,984
* Your sweet moonbeam *

557
00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:00,278
* The smell of you *

558
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:04,516
* In every single dream I dream *

559
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,694
* I knew when we collided *

560
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,376
* You're the one I have decided *

561
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:11,653
* Who's one of my kind *

562
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,928
* One of my kind *

563
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:18,024
* Hey, soul sister *

564
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:22,010
* Ain't that Mr. mister on the radio? *

565
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:22,870
* Stereo *

566
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:24,264
* The way you move *

567
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:25,743
* Ain't fair, you know *

568
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,946
* Hey, soul sister *

569
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:29,696
* I don't want to miss *

570
00:24:29,697 --> 00:24:33,384
* A single thing you do *

571
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:36,076
* Oh, tonight *

572
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:38,099
* The way you can cut a rug *

573
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,017
* Watching you's the
only drug I need *

574
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:42,887
* So gangsta, I'm so thug *

575
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:45,507
* You're the only one
I'm dreaming of *

576
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:48,414
* You see, I can be
myself now finally *

577
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:50,776
* In fact, there's
nothing I can't be *

578
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:53,985
* Nothing I can't be
I want the world to see *

579
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:55,602
* You'll be with me *

580
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:57,861
* Hey, soul sister
Ooh *

581
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:01,492
* Ain't that Mr. mister on the radio? *

582
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:05,428
* Stereo, the way you move
ain't fair, you know *

583
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:07,504
* Hey, soul sister *

584
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:12,447
* I don't want to miss
a single thing you do *

585
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:14,984
* Miss a thing *

586
00:25:14,985 --> 00:25:15,981
* Tonight *

587
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,435
* Hey
Hey *

588
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:21,026
* Hey
Hey *

589
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:24,317
* Hey
Hey *

590
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,988
* Tonight
Hey *

591
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:28,373
* Hey *

592
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:31,537
* Hey
Hey *

593
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:33,050
* Hey *

594
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:35,997
* Hey
Hey *

595
00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:54,305
These costumes are causing
some unmentionable chafing.

596
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:55,327
Are you okay?

597
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:56,865
No. I'm totally freaking out.

598
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:58,305
Last time we performed
in front of an audience,

599
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,820
I went into labor.
I think I'm having

600
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:00,903
post traumatic stress disorder.

601
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:03,557
Fyi, I'm totally
available to fill in.

602
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:04,822
Nowhere to run.

603
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:07,052
From me or your lies.

604
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:08,928
I hope they judge us on
dancing and adultery,

605
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:10,570
because you're aces
at both of them.

606
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,561
I don't understand
how you found out.

607
00:26:12,562 --> 00:26:15,073
I am so stupid.
I can't believe I did it.

608
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,844
I've never felt more awful
about anything in my life.

609
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,275
What's Artie all worked up about?

610
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,138
You are such a jerk.

611
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:26,331
You told Kurt?
I don't remember. Maybe.

612
00:26:26,332 --> 00:26:27,541
About Finn and Santana?

613
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:28,618
No. I think I told him.

614
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,787
Who told you?

615
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,117
Me. I think Brittany told me.

616
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:33,905
Or maybe it was puck.
Yeah, it was me.

617
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:35,515
Everybody knew about this but me?

618
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:37,247
Pretty much.
Nobody tells you anything

619
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:39,250
because a, you're a blabber mouth

620
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:41,026
and b, we all just
pretend to like you.

621
00:26:41,027 --> 00:26:42,580
That's not true.
I kind of like her.

622
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:45,291
Look, Rachel, when this all happened,
you were dating

623
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:47,465
another guy, so you don't
really have a right to be pissed

624
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:48,760
at me about it, okay?

625
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:50,634
And fine. I shouldn't
have lied about it,

626
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:52,889
but to be honest,
that isn't what you care about.

627
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,724
You care about the
Santana of it all.

628
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:56,520
Oh, who are you right now?

629
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:58,556
Best... green room...
ever. You know what?

630
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,031
You guys are going to
have to find somebody else

631
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:01,240
to mindlessly harmonize

632
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:02,555
in the background, because I'm not

633
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:04,060
going onstage with him.

634
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:06,525
Make that two subs. I'm not
going out there with Brittany.

635
00:27:06,526 --> 00:27:07,981
Me, either. Enough!

636
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:09,963
Listen to yourselves!

637
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:11,844
I'm ashamed of you.

638
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,162
Think back to where you
were this time last year.

639
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:16,773
In this room. No set list,
no choreography.

640
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:19,720
No chance in hell of winning,
but you did win.

641
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,777
Because you did it together.

642
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:23,702
Look, I don't care if you
guys hate each other.

643
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:25,653
All I want is for you
guys to go out there

644
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,325
and sing together. Get up there,

645
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:29,302
and for six minutes,

646
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:32,848
remind yourselves
that you're not alone.

647
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,324
All right. Show time!

648
00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:50,260
Just tell me why you
would cheat on me.

649
00:27:50,261 --> 00:27:52,249
I don't know.
Why would I cheat on you?

650
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,627
Is this, like, a mad lib,
or something?

651
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:54,680
You cheated on me with Mike.

652
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:57,192
You admitted it to me
in the green room. When?

653
00:27:57,193 --> 00:27:58,729
When I was accusing
you of adultery.

654
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:00,197
What does that have to
do with me cheating?

655
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:01,999
"Adultery" means cheating.

656
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:03,734
I thought it meant being stupid.

657
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:06,003
Like being a dolt.

658
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,333
I didn't cheat on you.

659
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:10,168
I did something much worse.

660
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:15,006
I lost your magic comb.

661
00:28:15,147 --> 00:28:16,611
I don't know what happened.

662
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,783
I had it in my pocket.

663
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:20,494
And then I went to
motocross practice,

664
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:22,485
and then, when I left,
it was gone.

665
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:25,470
That's why I've been avoiding you.
I was so ashamed.

666
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:26,392
That magic comb

667
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:28,706
was our only chance of winning,
the only thing keeping me

668
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,046
from totally screwing it up.

669
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:32,993
I didn't want to let
you down, Artie.

670
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:34,618
That wasn't a magic comb.

671
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,603
I just found it on the floor

672
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:38,684
and ran into you on the way
to tossing it in the trash.

673
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:40,510
And you let me comb
my hair with it?

674
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,251
You don't need a magic comb.

675
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:45,568
You're magic, Brittany...
the way you move...

676
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:47,011
And I just should
have told you that

677
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:48,958
in the first place, and I'm sorry.

678
00:28:57,878 --> 00:28:59,635
When I'm out there dancing today,

679
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:02,334
it won't be for the
team or for the crowd.

680
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:03,974
It will be for you.

681
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:08,744
What are you doing?

682
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:09,880
I'm a wrestler.

683
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,726
This is how I get psyched
up for competition.

684
00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:14,068
Listen, you don't
have to be nervous.

685
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:16,130
You saved my life.
I've got your back.

686
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:19,274
Oh, I'm not nervous. You know why?

687
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:20,116
Why?

688
00:29:20,117 --> 00:29:22,014
Because show choir is stupid.

689
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:24,967
And now for our final
performance of the program...

690
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:27,874
From McKinley high,
the new directions!

691
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:28,381
What?

692
00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:32,425
You look beautiful.

693
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:53,233
* Now I've had the time of my life
* Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da... *

694
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:57,090
* No, I've never felt
like this before *

695
00:29:57,577 --> 00:30:02,111
* Yes, I swear it's the truth *

696
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:04,365
* And I owe it all to you *

697
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:10,998
* 'Cause I've had the
time of my life *

698
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:14,226
* And I owe it all to you *

699
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:19,948
* I've been waiting for so long *

700
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:22,038
* And now I finally found someone *

701
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,642
* To stand by me *

702
00:30:23,643 --> 00:30:26,214
* Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da... *

703
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:28,683
* We saw the writing on the wall *

704
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:32,882
* As we felt this magical fantasy *

705
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:37,208
* Now with passion in our eyes *

706
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:40,971
* There's no way we could
disguise it secretly *

707
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,678
* Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da... *

708
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,839
* So we take each other's hand *

709
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,265
* 'Cause we seem to
understand the urgency *

710
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,764
* Oh *

711
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:53,062
* Just remember *

712
00:30:53,947 --> 00:30:56,855
* You're the one thing *

713
00:30:57,362 --> 00:31:00,710
* I can't get enough of *

714
00:31:00,711 --> 00:31:02,061
* I can't get enough of *

715
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:05,836
* So I'll tell you something *

716
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:09,149
* This could be love *

717
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,131
* Because *

718
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:15,478
* I've had the time of my life *

719
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:19,845
* No, I never felt this way before *

720
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:22,192
* Never felt this way
Yes, I swear *

721
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,210
* It's the truth *

722
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:27,502
* And I owe it all to you *

723
00:31:27,503 --> 00:31:29,239
* Ba ba ba ba ba ba *

724
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,711
* Ba ba ba ba ba ba *

725
00:31:30,712 --> 00:31:32,908
* Ba ba ba ba
Now, I *

726
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,228
* Ooh...I *

727
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:37,572
* Had the time of my life *

728
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,889
* No, I never felt this way before *

729
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,891
* Never felt this way
Yes, I swear *

730
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,612
* It's the truth *

731
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:48,555
* And I owe it all to you *

732
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:53,938
* Oh, I had the time of my life *

733
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:57,057
* Of my life
And I never felt *

734
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:59,409
* This way before
Never felt this way *

735
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,506
* Yes, I swear
Yes, I swear *

736
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:03,645
* It's the truth
It's the truth *

737
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:06,307
* And I owe it all to you *

738
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:09,263
* Ooh... oh... oh... *

739
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:12,303
* Oh... oh! *

740
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:32,509
* Well, sometimes I
go out by myself *

741
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,334
* And I look across the water
Ooh ooh ooh *

742
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,042
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

743
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:41,083
* And I think of all the things,
what you're doing *

744
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,273
* And in my head,
I paint a picture *

745
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:46,313
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

746
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,030
* 'Cause since I've come on home *

747
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:51,327
* Well, my body's been a mess *

748
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:53,592
* And I miss your ginger hair *

749
00:32:53,593 --> 00:32:56,039
* And the way you like to dress *

750
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:58,567
* Oh, won't you come on over? *

751
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,741
* Stop making a fool out of me *

752
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:06,800
* Why don't you come on over,
Valerie? *

753
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:09,279
* Ba, ba, bada, ba,
ba, ba, bada ba *

754
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,951
* Valerie...
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

755
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:13,754
* Why don't you come on over? *

756
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:16,921
* Valerie
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

757
00:33:16,922 --> 00:33:18,230
* Valerie, Valerie *

758
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:21,115
* Valerie
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

759
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:22,810
* Why don't you come on over? *

760
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:24,034
* Well, sometimes *

761
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:28,399
* I go out by myself and
I look across the water *

762
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:30,378
* Ooh, ooh *

763
00:33:31,713 --> 00:33:34,958
* And I think of all the things,
what you're doing *

764
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:38,211
* And in my head I paint a picture
Ooh, ooh *

765
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:42,810
* 'Cause since I've come on home
Ah, ah... *

766
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:45,189
* Well, my body's been a mess *

767
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,313
* And I've missed your ginger hair *

768
00:33:47,314 --> 00:33:50,052
* And the way you like to dress *

769
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:52,472
* Ah, ah... 
Won't you come on over? *

770
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:55,444
* Stop makin' a fool out of me *

771
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:01,018
* Oh, why don't you
come on over, Valerie? *

772
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:03,163
* Ba, ba, bada, ba,
ba, ba, bada, ba *

773
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:05,846
* Valerie
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

774
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,625
* Why don't you come on over? *

775
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:10,322
* Valerie, Valerie *

776
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:11,727
* Why don't you come on over? *

777
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:14,568
* Valerie
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

778
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:19,320
* Why don't you come
on over Valerie? *

779
00:34:32,313 --> 00:34:34,812
And now, this year's head judge,
associate director

780
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:36,571
of the Ohio department
of motor vehicles,

781
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:39,361
Mr. Pete Sosnowski.

782
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:41,217
Thank you.

783
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:44,682
And thank you to all the groups
who performed here today.

784
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,704
We all had a serious good time.

785
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:50,727
You know what else is
a serious good time?

786
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:53,149
Taking two minutes to save a life

787
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,003
by filling out an
organ donor card.

788
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:59,124
Because it's never
too late to donate.

789
00:35:00,896 --> 00:35:02,849
Drum roll, please.

790
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:05,796
In third place...

791
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:08,641
The hipsters!

792
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,801
Thank you.

793
00:35:13,843 --> 00:35:15,370
Drive carefully.

794
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:18,889
And now, the winner of this year's

795
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:23,457
west-central sectional is...

796
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:29,469
It's a tie.

797
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:33,583
Congratulations! You're all
going to the regionals!

798
00:35:38,744 --> 00:35:40,955
Congratulations. Oh, nice work.
See you at regionals.

799
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:47,542
We get to go on.

800
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:49,664
Yeah.

801
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:54,655
Hey.

802
00:35:54,895 --> 00:35:55,685
Hi.

803
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:58,982
You okay?

804
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,032
Is that it? Is that your trophy?

805
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,509
Yeah, this is it. Wow.

806
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:03,212
We won. I know. I heard.

807
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:04,805
It's exciting.
Congratulations. Thanks.

808
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:06,766
I wanted to call you, but I, uh...

809
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:08,290
Emma, it's cool.

810
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,323
Guess you didn't need your
good luck charm, after all.

811
00:36:10,324 --> 00:36:11,273
You were missed.

812
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:14,439
I need to tell you
about my weekend.

813
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,218
I think I'd rather not
hear all the details.

814
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:18,605
Carl took me to Vegas...
why are you telling me this?

815
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:23,184
Is-is that an engagement ring?

816
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,169
It's a wedding ring, actually.

817
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:31,901
I...

818
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:36,878
I... I'm happy for you.

819
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:38,631
Will, I... let's just...

820
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:40,121
Leave it at that, hmm?

821
00:36:45,546 --> 00:36:48,047
When we first started Glee club,
I told Mr. Schuester

822
00:36:48,048 --> 00:36:50,754
that being a part of something
special makes you special,

823
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:51,848
and I don't know, I just...

824
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:53,949
I think I lost that
somewhere along the way.

825
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,368
But winning that way
at sectionals...

826
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:57,856
It really reminded me of it.

827
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:00,776
Are we a part of
something special...

828
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:02,727
You and me?

829
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:07,814
Yes.

830
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:11,372
I love you.

831
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,248
No more lying...

832
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:22,944
Ever.

833
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,589
There's, um, something
that I-I need to tell you.

834
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:38,397
Last week, when...
when we were fighting,

835
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:39,981
I was...

836
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:42,943
I was so mad at you and I was...
I was so hurt

837
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:45,189
that I wanted to make you feel

838
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,634
as bad as I felt.

839
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:53,828
Is something wrong?
Did I bite you again?

840
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,461
I did this to Finn once before.

841
00:37:55,462 --> 00:37:56,903
I-I can't do it again.

842
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,832
I'm sorry. I have to go.

843
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:00,485
I'm so sorry,

844
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,217
and-and it will never,

845
00:38:02,218 --> 00:38:03,490
ever happen again.

846
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,521
I knew you were a lot
of things, Rachel,

847
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:08,206
and I loved you because and in
spite of all of them, but...

848
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:10,237
I never thought you were mean.

849
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:11,490
I'm saying that I'm sorry.

850
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,301
And doesn't what you
did with Santana

851
00:38:13,302 --> 00:38:14,554
kind of cancel this out?

852
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:15,719
We weren't together.

853
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:18,339
I didn't cheat on you.
How could you do this to me?

854
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,396
It was a mistake.

855
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,161
Well, maybe we should go to
another counseling session

856
00:38:22,162 --> 00:38:22,645
with miss Pillsbury.

857
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:25,209
Can't have couple's counseling
if you're not a couple.

858
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,092
You're breaking up with me?

859
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:29,416
What you did was
really bad, Rachel.

860
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,824
And you knew how sensitive
I'd be about this

861
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:33,284
after what happened with Quinn.

862
00:38:34,548 --> 00:38:36,610
You said you'd never
break up with me.

863
00:38:41,837 --> 00:38:43,920
I never thought you'd
make me feel like this.

864
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,172
I got your text. What's wrong?

865
00:38:52,173 --> 00:38:53,992
It's Pavarotti. I think he's sick.

866
00:38:54,274 --> 00:38:56,532
I've been taking good care of him,
but he-he won't sing,

867
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,453
and-and he's losing his feathers.

868
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:01,161
Oh, he's just molting.

869
00:39:01,162 --> 00:39:02,438
He's growing a new
coat of feathers,

870
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:04,367
so his body has to
shut down a little.

871
00:39:05,065 --> 00:39:06,490
But don't worry about it.

872
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:11,465
He's got food, water,
he seems to like his cage.

873
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:12,972
Just give it a little while.

874
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,376
He'll be singing again in no time.

875
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,750
Don't forget.

876
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:21,778
Warbler practice tonight at 5:00.

877
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:23,114
Regionals, here we come.

878
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,712
You changed your look.

879
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,124
Yeah, this is more me.

880
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,002
I'm sorry I doubted you, Mike.

881
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:38,268
Asian kiss?

882
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:40,096
Asian kiss.

883
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:44,693
Congratulations, guys.

884
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:47,559
It wasn't pretty, but we're
moving on. You got that?

885
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:50,524
And I, for one,
am going to be happy to have

886
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:52,416
regionals and
nationals to focus on.

887
00:39:53,046 --> 00:39:55,349
Mr. Shue, we heard the news
about miss Pillsbury marrying

888
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,199
the finest dentist alive.
It's all right.

889
00:39:59,094 --> 00:40:00,127
We don't need to talk about it.

890
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:01,025
Now...

891
00:40:01,938 --> 00:40:03,859
I know we've had our, um...

892
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:05,751
Our dramas this week,

893
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:08,293
but our family's back
in a happy place,

894
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:11,968
and I think we should celebrate
the best way we know how.

895
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:15,434
Rachel... so how would
you like to solo?

896
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,888
Thanks, but, um, I don't really
feel like a solo right now.

897
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:21,937
I-I'd like to defer

898
00:40:21,938 --> 00:40:24,369
to this week's two unsung heroes,

899
00:40:25,437 --> 00:40:26,814
Mercedes and Tina.

900
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,032
Well, don't have to ask me twice.

901
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:37,073
* Happiness hit her like a train *

902
00:40:37,074 --> 00:40:38,832
* On a track *

903
00:40:44,702 --> 00:40:47,094
* Coming towards her *

904
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:51,509
* Stuck, still no turning back *

905
00:40:56,521 --> 00:41:02,271
* She hid around corners,
and she hid under beds *

906
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:04,034
* She killed it *

907
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:08,714
* With kisses,
and from it she fled *

908
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:12,279
* The dog days are over *

909
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,532
* The dog days are done *

910
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:21,450
* The horses are coming,
so you better run *

911
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:25,473
* Run fast for your mother,
run fast for your father *

912
00:41:25,474 --> 00:41:26,701
* Run for your children *

913
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:28,666
* For your sisters
and your brothers *

914
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:31,479
* Leave all your love
and your loving behind *

915
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,842
* You can't carry it with
you if you want to survive *

916
00:41:34,843 --> 00:41:37,843
* The dog days are over *

917
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:41,151
* The dog days are done *

918
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:43,718
* Can't you hear the horses ?*

919
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:54,118
