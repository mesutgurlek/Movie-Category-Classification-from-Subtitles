1
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:33,232
Yes, yes, yes.
Rise and pray for all is writ.

2
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,394
All is writ.

3
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,632
If everything is written down,
what's the use of getting up?

4
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:41,902
Oh, Father. You gave me
the whole blanket again.

5
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,239
- That's untrue.
- You mean, I took it?

6
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,473
I mean, it is not a whole blanket.
Only half.

7
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:49,743
Only enough to cover one small girl.

8
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:53,478
It's empty.
We ate the last loaf for supper.

9
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:56,318
- Don't you remember?
- Stomachs have no memories.

10
00:02:56,492 --> 00:03:00,019
And I at the moment am all stomach.
Not even a crumb.

11
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:02,858
Perhaps today will be kind to us.

POET:
Allah, I make a prayer for my daughter.

And I, for my father.

POET: Let this day spare her
the monkey bites of hunger and want.

15
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:17,804
Let my verses sell in profusion...

16
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:21,348
...that my daughter may eat
and prosper and wear shoes.

17
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:24,884
I pray the unselfishness
of my father's prayer be noted.

18
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,453
Hmm.

19
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:29,087
Remove us from Earth
If we've nothing to stay for.

20
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,056
They pray the best...

21
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,785
...who have something to pray for.

22
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:37,158
Oh, look.
Look, the camel likes your rhymes.

23
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,426
- See, it's an omen.
- I thank you.

24

POET:

Rhymes to help you sell your wares.

29
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:57,319
Charm your wives. Educate your children.

30
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,284
Ah. There's a won'thy citizen.

31
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:01,184
A rhyme for any purpose you name.

32
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:03,587
What use has a butcher for rhymes?

33
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,752
Sir, to increase your sales.
What meat do you sell today?

34
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,898
Nothing. Nothing but leftovers of mutton.

35
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,293
Good, good.

36
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,593
The haunch of the paunch
Or the rib of a sheep

37
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,896
Is tasty and tender,
Though priced a bit steep.

38
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,335
The part that you can buy
With no financial frown

39
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,634
Is on the ground
When the sheep's sitting down.

40
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,276
You're mad. Mad.

41
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,314
A man can sell anything in the world
except poems.

42
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:29,212
He can sell poisons, emetics,
false noses, but no poems.

43
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:31,615
BEGGAR 1: Alms for love of Allah.
- Has your hunger grown?

44
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:36,050
- Like a magic tree.
BEGGAR 1: Alms for the love of Allah.

45
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:39,285
There are fresh oranges this morning
at the Bazaar of the Vendors.

46
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:41,123
- I'll be there.
- Do not take so many.

47
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:45,165
- They interfere with your speed of foot.
- Oh, my father's wisdom always guides me.

48
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,394
BEGGAR 2:
Alms for the love of Allah.

Alms for love of Allah.

BEGGAR 4:
Alms for love of Allah.

51
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:53,803
BEGGAR 5:
Oh, great master...

52
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:56,468
...thou shalt live if thou shalt give.
- Ah!

53
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:59,547
May though soul burn by fire,
O thou dog.

54
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,480
A father sending his daughter to steal.

55
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:04,552
Could anything be baser than that?

56
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:09,715
Take note, Allah,
how low a human can sink to the bottom.

57
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,917
BEGGARS:
Alms for the love of Allah.

58
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,620
Sir, do you wish to purchase a poem?

59
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:16,822
Poem? Are you not a beggar?

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,367
I beg your pardon.
Do I look like a beggar?

61
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,834
BEGGARS:
Alms for love of Allah.

62
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:24,769
Alms for love of Allah.

63
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:31,403
BEGGAR: Open thy purse and let the
inflicted bend over the house of Mecca.

64
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,414
Hard father, may Allah ruin thee forever.

65
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,949
BEGGARS:
Alms for the love of Allah.

66
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,485
You can't beg here.

67
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:41,589
This is one of the best begging locations
in Baghdad.

68
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,022
- Oh?
- Why do you think this space is empty?

69
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:45,592
It's not empty. I'm here.

70
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,220
It must remain empty
until old Hajj returns from Mecca.

71
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,333
That begging place belongs to him.

72
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:55,369
My dear verminous friends,
I am a cousin to old Hajj.

73
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,768
- That's impossible.
- Please, come, consider.

74
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,670
Only a Hajj may sit here. That is the law.

75
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:03,175
Would I dare risk it if I were not a Hajj?

76
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:04,438
- Omar.
- Would I?

77
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,573
BEGGARS: Alms for the love of Allah.
- Oh, may Allah give thee ease.

78
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,584
- Alms for a starving brother.
- May Allah give thee ease.

79
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:13,381
BEGGARS:
Alms for the love of Allah.

80
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,888
Oh, stop it.

81
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,686
BEGGARS:
Alms for the love of Allah.

82
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,885
Alms for the love of Allah.

83
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:22,122
Alms for the love of Allah.

84
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,266
What's this? Where's old Hajj?

85
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,425
Hajj has gone to Mecca, great sir.

86
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:29,332
Yeah, this fellow claims to be
a member of the family.

87
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:32,702
A customer of Hajj's, I presume?
I am taking over his practice.

88
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:38,939
All my life, I have given one dinar
each morning to Hajj the Beggar.

89
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:42,050
I am too old to change beggars.

90
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:44,379
You say you're too old
to change beggars.

91
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,317
Your attitude strikes me as strange.

92
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,721
It's easy enough to change beggars.
What's difficult is to beg change.

93
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,622
Not bad. Ha-ha.

94
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,886
Not bad.

95
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:57,464
Here, you deserve encouragement. Here.

96
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,601
One dinar is not enough
to encourage me.

97
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:03,432
- Take it. Take it.
- No, it's too little. You're too stingy, no.

98
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:06,439
Now, the beggars tell us what to give.

99
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:08,702
Well, here.

100
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:11,711
- But not for the beggar, for the poet.
- I thank you.

101
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:14,475
- You disgrace us.
- We mustrt seem to be greedy.

102
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,519
- We're not supposed to notice the amount.
- It's the spirit behind the gift that counts.

103
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,649
Never have I seen a profession
more keenly in need of new blood.

104
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:29,161
As of now, this business
is under new management.

105
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,761
BEGGAR 1:
Alms for the love of Allah.

106
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,902
Give me a few dozen dinar, my friend.

107
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,403
And an already pleasant morning
will be made pleasanter for both of us.

108
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:40,633
If you do not wish my blessing,
I'll be happy to give you my curse.

109
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,574
I do not give money away.
I'm a businessman.

110
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:47,079
May the graves of your ancestors
vanish in the spring floods.

111
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,083
May your wives grow warts
on their noses.

112
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:53,245
May your taxes increase.

113
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,796
- May your taxes increase.
- May your taxes increase.

114
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,864
BEGGARS:
May your taxes increase.

115
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:05,125
May your taxes increase.

116
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,893
May your taxes increase.

117
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,505
- May your taxes increase.
- I sat down, feeling desolated

118
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:12,834
Bowed my head and crossed my knees

119
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:17,673
Is fortune really predicated
Upon such tiny turns as these?

120
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:22,875
Then fate's a thing without a head
A puzzle never understood

121
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:25,646
And man proceeds where he is led

122
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:30,019
Unguaranteed of bad or good

123
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,788
Fate

124
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:37,922
Fate can be the trap in your path

125
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,729
The bitter cup of your tears

126
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:48,776
Your wine of wrath

127
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:54,281
Fate can be shade in the desert blaze

128
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,477
Sudden food in a famine found

129
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:03,284
The sound of praise

130
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:09,159
Incomprehensible and strange

131
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:14,099
Fate can play a trick with the twine

132
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,001
To weave the evil and good

133
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:24,374
In one design

134
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,914
And so my destiny

135
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:31,952
I look at you and cannot see

136
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:36,319
Is it good? Is it ill?
Am I blessed? Am I cursed?

137
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,826
Is it honey on my tongue or brine?

138
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,328
What fate

139
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:47,993
What fate is mine

140
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:54,139
Fate can play a trick with the twine

141
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,710
To weave the evil and good

142
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,339
In one design

143
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,145
And so my destiny

144
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,380
I look at you and cannot see

145
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,548
Is it good? Is it ill?
Am I blessed? Am I cursed?

146
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:15,163
Is it honey on my tongue or brine?

147
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:19,028
What fate, what fate is...

148
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,737
Good morning, O giant men of the desert.
Welcome to civilization.

149
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,465
You are the beggar called Hajj?

150
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,008
Even so am I. Far and wide the name of...

151
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:31,510
Permit me to correct myself.
My name is not Hajj.

152
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:35,117
- Silence.
- But my name... But my name is not...

153
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:37,684
You, what is this beggar's name?

154
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:39,912
- He said that Hajj, that he...
- Thank you.

155
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,080
But I tell you, you're making a mistake.

156
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:45,489
It must be a case of mistaken identity.
And l...

157
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:49,159
POET:
You're making a terrible mistake.

158
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,694
I don't think...

159
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:58,466
Now I know what you are.
You're slavers.

160
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:05,103
Slave traders of the desert. Allah! Allah!

161
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:24,328
- We have him, master. Hajj the Beggar.
- Good.

162
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,932
Such a profitless error. I have nothing.

163
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,870
Oh, glorious chieftain, let me be,
I pray you.

164
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,567
I'm not won'th selling at the slave market.

165
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:40,045
Look, my bad legs, injured in a fall,
unable to bear my weight.

166
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:42,980
I'm old, foolish, forgetful
and broken-brained.

167
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,779
I'm won'thless. Less than won'thless.

168
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,979
Talks a lot, doesn't he?
Are the irons hot?

169
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:48,521
Quite hot, master.

170
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,784
Take a look at my face.
Do you know me?

171
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,951
I know no one and nothing.
I have no memory.

172
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,791
- I am Jawan.
- Jawan. Oh, no.

173
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,330
Your memory freshens.

174
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,593
Well, it's a famous name, Jawan.

175
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:03,068
Let me see, it strikes a chord.
You're Jawan the great astronomer.

176
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,263
You dissemble poorly.

177
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,102
I'm Jawan, the robber, the brigand,
as you very well know.

178
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:09,608
But I don't know.
I've no interest in such matters.

179
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,215
By tomorrow, I will have forgotten
your face, I could never identify you.

180
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:15,350
- Bare his belly.
- Why? What for?

181
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:19,477
We're gonna decorate it with a white-hot
coal, gleaming in its navel like a jewel.

182
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,022
- In Allah's name, what have I done?
- Can it be he's forgotten?

183
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,956
Fifteen years ago you put a curse upon me,
Hajj the Beggar.

184
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,562
I have only been Hajj the Beggar
since this morning.

185
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,723
- His mind has rotted like a fig.
- I have never seen you before.

186
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:35,894
I know that. But 15 years ago, you put
a curse upon my name, Hajj the Beggar.

187
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,039
Soon after,
my only son was stolen from me.

188
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:40,607
All these years,
I've sought for my son everywhere.

189
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:43,506
I've offered ransom
that would purchase all Persia.

190
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,842
- Now, I am to die soon.
- Oh, let's hope not.

191
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,280
I must find my son in the weeks
remaining to me.

192
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:51,044
The wise men tell me it is your curse...

193
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,745
...that keeps me from him.
- Ah. Do they really?

194
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:56,892
- How much ransom did you offer?
- Never mind. Remove the curse.

195
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,825
Certainly, of course. Delighted to do
the best I can under these conditions.

196
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:03,988
- Don't haggle. Remove the curse.
- Jawan, you don't understand.

197
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,067
A curse must be removed voluntarily.
That's the law of curses.

198
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:09,898
A curse is nothing more than a prayer,
a prayer for harm.

199
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:12,199
A prayer is born in the heart,
not the mouth.

200
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,934
- You'd pray for me and not mean it.
- For money, I would.

201
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,102
- Would Allah accept prayer that's paid for?
- Aye, indeed so.

202
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,578
Do you not give money to mosques
and to holy men?

203
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:23,047
Do they not bless you and pray for you?

204
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,353
- That is true. Give him a gold piece.
- Is that all your son is won'th?

205
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:31,550
- Lf my patience snaps...
- You'll have eternity to regret it.

206
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,128
Think, Jawan.
Listen to death chuckling in your chest.

207
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:38,198
What good will your wealth be
when the chuckle becomes a roar?

208
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,733
Your tongue is cunning.
Give him 10 gold pieces.

209
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,394
- A hundred. Do I not offer you your son?
- A hundred?

210
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,666
Happiness on Earth
as well as a cushion in paradise?

211
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:48,969
How much is too much for eternal bliss?

212
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,174
Will I find my son this day?

213
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:54,475
This day? Possibly within the hour.

214
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,148
Saddle a horse.
A plain mount, it'll go unnoticed.

215
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:01,449
Don't risk entering the city. You'll be taken
by the Wazir's police. Tortured. Beheaded.

216
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:03,854
If I must die in Baghdad,
how can I avoid it?

217
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:05,220
By staying out of Baghdad.

218
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:08,989
No man can avoid his fate.
That is kismet.

219
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,471
- Break camp.
- Break camp.

220
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:23,737
Return to the mountains.
Wait for me there.

221
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:34,478
Pray well, Hajj the Beggar.

222
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:37,922
Excuse me, which way is Mecca?

223
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:44,162
Hey, ho. Hey, ho, ho.
Hey, ho.

224
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,401
I'm rich.

225
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,403
I am rich.

226
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:54,339
On the rim of torture and death
and now, treasure.

227
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,541
Why, I'm the richest man I ever knew.

228
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,918
Today's my day

229
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,110
My day of days

230
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:10,190
My blessings unfold
In a hundred golden ways

231
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:17,027
Fate has played the trick with the twine

232
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:24,037
And woven evil and good in one design

233
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:26,697
And I can face the sun

234
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,901
No more to dodge, no more to run

235
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,877
I can eat, I can buy
I can sleep in a bed

236
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:37,542
In the certainty I'm fed and free

237
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,986
For fate has claimed its child

238
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:49,154
And smiled on me

239
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:36,706
Make way for the Wazir.
Make way for the Wazir.

240
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,178
MAN 1: Make way for the Wazir.
MAN 2: Clear the bazaar.

241
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,613
POLICEMEN:
Make way for the Wazir.

242
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:44,446
- Clear the bazaar.
- Clear the bazaar.

243
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,884
- Make way for the Wazir.
- Make way for the Wazir.

244
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:50,719
- Clear the bazaar.
- Clear the bazaar.

245
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,327
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
Follow.

246
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:05,666
Make way for the Wazir.

247
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:09,436
Make way for the mighty Wazir
who has eyes in every house.

248
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,374
MAN:
And hands in every pocket.

249
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,612
WAZIR:
Investigate that laughter.

250
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,776
SUBALTERN:
Wife of wives to the Wazir.

251
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,478
Wife of wives to the Wazir.

252
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:23,682
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
To the Wazir's wife of wives.

253
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,833
Salaam, Lalume,
possessor of my entire heart.

254
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,404
Happiness attend your return.

255
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,810
Salaam, my exalted husband.

256
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:51,510
Lalume, I sent you to Ababu
to negotiate a loan. Did you get it or not?

257
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:54,315
And I had thought your impatience
was for me.

258
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,982
I found a new and wondrous ointment,
feel my skin.

259
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,186
Lalume, without that loan, I perish.
Answer me, do I get it?

260
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:04,560
All the gold 10 camels can carry.

261
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,725
- Heh-heh. Lalume.
- But there is a condition.

262
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,929
A high marriage
for the three princesses of Ababu.

263
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:13,074
Oh, what a nuisance.

264
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:15,671
I don't need any more wives.

265
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,778
In fact,
I've got more than I've any use for.

266
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,506
My lord, no one knows that
better than I.

267
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:24,277
However, it is not you the sheik of Ababu
wants for a son-in-law.

268
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:27,980
He wishes his eldest daughter
to become wife of wives to the Caliph.

269
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,482
To the Caliph?

270
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:33,025
And her two sisters,
second and third wives to the Caliph.

271
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,356
How can I influence the Caliph?

272
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,091
He's too young to understand
an honest bribe.

273
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:42,169
Nor can I frighten him, not while he keeps
that certainty of divine destiny.

274
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,601
He's shown not the slightest inclination
to marry.

275
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:48,334
With your wit and enterprise,
you will change his mind.

276
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,709
Remember,
all the gold 10 camels can carry.

277
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,181
Are they attractive,
these three young women?

278
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:59,912
Judge for yourself, my lord.

279
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:01,578
WAZIR:
Guards.

280
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:05,090
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
Guards, bring the Ababus.

281
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:35,953
Exalted Wazir, may I present Their
Royal Highnesses the Princesses of Ababu.

282
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:41,356
In the name of our illustrious Caliph,
I welcome you to Baghdad.

283
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,754
What they say?

284
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,798
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
They could not be happy here...

285
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:50,063
...no matter what their father wants.
- What? Heh-heh. What?

286
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,707
Not happy in Baghdad?

287
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:57,109
Why, that's impossible.

288
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,010
Well, Baghdad...
Well, it's a symbol of happiness on Earth.

289
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:04,448
- Fetch me 50 happy people, quickly.
- My lord, it will take a month.

290
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,579
Sacred cats of Nefertiti.
Am I to be balked at every turn?

291
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,756
Will no one cooperate?

292
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:15,394
Unless I'm served as a Wazir should be...

293
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:18,499
...I warn you, heads will roll in the dust.

294
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,966
And the streets of Baghdad
will flow with the tears...

295
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,405
LALUME: Baghdad

296
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:35,414
Don't underestimate Baghdad

297
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:39,714
GUARDS:
A city rich in romantic oriental lore

298
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:43,585
CHORUS:
Aye

299
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,356
LALUME:
Baghdad

300
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:51,625
You must investigate Baghdad

301
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,964
GUARDS: And learn a few of the facts
You never knew before

302
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:59,869
CHORUS:
Aye

303
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,001
LALUME:
Due south of the Garden of Eden

304
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,376
Due north of the Gulf of Aden

305
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:11,246
Where every male and maiden

306
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,254
Is laden down

307
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:22,421
With the blisses of Baghdad

308
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:27,666
This irresistible

309
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:34,002
Town

310
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:42,007
When or where
Could you compare high life

311
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:46,644
To the life you find here

312
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:51,350
Not since Nineveh, not since Tyre
Not since Babylon turned to mire

313
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:56,987
For a sin of a kind we never mind here

314
00:21:57,165 --> 00:22:01,465
Where or when ever again low life

315
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:05,970
Like the life well-known here

316
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:10,669
Not since Nineveh, not since Sidon
Not since Jericho started slidir

317
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:15,476
From the din of a horn
That's never blown here

318
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,087
Our palaces are gaudier

319
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:24,589
Our alleyways are bawdier

320
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,924
Our princes more autocratic here

321
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:33,864
Our beggars more distinctly aromatic here

322
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,630
Where could you ever pursue your life

323
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:44,268
With the zeal we feel here?

324
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:48,815
Not since Babylon read that writing
Not since Jericho heard that trumpet

325
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:52,385
Not since Nebuchadnezzar's
Hanging garden went to pot

326
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:56,354
CHORUS: Aye
- Not since that village near Gomorrah got

327
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,993
Too hot for Lot

328
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:04,622
- No, not since Nineveh
CHORUS: Aye, shabash

329
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:11,729
Not since Nineveh

330
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:16,606
Ah ah

331
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:24,010
- Nineveh
CHORUS: Come to Baghdad, live in Baghdad

332
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:29,886
Life in Baghdad
Takes you back to Nineveh

333
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,491
CHORUS:
Nineveh!

334
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,067
CHORUS:
Stay in Baghdad, stay in Baghdad

335
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,673
Stay in Baghdad, stay in Baghdad

336
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:51,779
Stay in Baghdad, stay in Baghdad
Stay in Baghdad, stay in Baghdad

337
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:53,972
Aye

338
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:52,134
CHORUS:
When or where

339
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:54,935
Could you compare high life

340
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,103
To the life you find here

341
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:03,274
Not since Nineveh, not since Tyre
Not since Babylon turned to mire

342
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:08,286
For a sin of a kind we never mind here

343
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,625
Where could you ever pursue your life

344
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,989
With the zeal we feel here?

345
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:22,797
Not since Babylon read that writing
Not since Jericho heard that trumpet, not

346
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,301
Not since

347
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:31,907
No, no, no, no

348
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,312
Not since Nineveh

349
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:38,509
Not since

350
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:42,680
Not since Nineveh, not since Tyre
Not since Babylon turned to mire

351
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:46,953
Not since Nineveh, not since Sidon
Not since Jericho started slidir

352
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,655
Baghdad is the gayest town

353
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:56,600
Since Nineveh
Nineveh!

354
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:01,608
GUARD:
Clear the bazaar.

355
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:04,074
GUARDS:
Make way for the Wazir.

356
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:05,907
Clear the bazaar.

357
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:09,380
Make way for the Wazir.

358
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:12,042
Clear the bazaar.

359
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:16,983
All Highest, pardon thy servant.

360
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,456
I should've prevented this indignity.

361
00:26:20,795 --> 00:26:22,786
- I was stepped upon.
- Oh.

362
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:26,161
Inconceivable, All Highest, but true.

363
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,894
You were incontrovertibly stepped upon.

364
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,198
But it is written that they who defile
the royal presence will die.

365
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:36,071
Great ruler, we will all die.

366
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:38,371
In your words,
there's food for much thought.

367
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:42,573
Yes, and in my thoughts,
there is much room for food.

368
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:45,879
Can't we return to the palace now
and have breakfast?

369
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:47,112
Certainly not.

370
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:50,224
Now the official year of mourning
for my father is at an end...

371
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,724
...I will assume the official duties.

372
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:55,294
The Caliph's schedule
has no intermission.

373
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:59,627
Then, my boy, heh, alter the schedule
with a wave of your hand.

374
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:02,429
Omar, the duties of royalty are sacred.

375
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:04,265
My late cousin, Ultimate of Aden...

376
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:07,602
...strangled to death on a peach pit
rather than interrupt an official function.

377
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:13,812
In my humble opinion,
your late cousin was a... Was a fool.

378
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:17,008
There are many things
that only royalty can understand.

379
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:20,154
Heh-heh-heh. Yes, it must be.

380
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:24,584
These roaming
roamings in the streets incognito...

381
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,158
...do they serve a purpose?

382
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:30,059
The Caliph is expected to make incognito
visits among his subjects regularly.

383
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,528
And he shall do so.

384
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,000
May we ask ourselves
what purpose these visits serve?

385
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:37,263
We may ask ourselves.

386
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:40,169
- And may we answer ourselves?
- We may.

387
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,742
Abba, to learn the ways of the people.

388
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,175
Babba, to stimulate our local storytellers.

389
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:49,010
Cabba, to introduce a romantic note
into the dry business of government.

390
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:50,617
Dabba...

391
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:00,755
Dabba?

392
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,658
Omar, she is lovely.

393
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:06,267
My boy, I've never seen that expression
on your face before.

394
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,958
It's sickening.

395
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:12,072
SLAVE TRADER: Slaves for sale.
Gathered from the four corners of the Earth.

396
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,337
Here we have Al Marre of Ankara.
Sold into slavery by her husband.

397
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:20,504
Come gaze at her. What am I offered?

398
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:23,879
Gaze at this physique,
this marvelous physique.

399
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:26,953
Powerful. Does lots of work.

400
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:31,058
Makes cheese. Milks goats.
Manages estates.

401
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:34,093
Fifty dinar. Fifty dinar.

402
00:28:34,262 --> 00:28:38,528
Gaze at this magnificent physique.
Fifty dinar.

403
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,191
Gaze at this marvelous musculature.

404
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:44,429
Here she is. Fifty dinar.

405
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:46,369
- Omar, she is gone.
- Oh, my boy...

406
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:50,204
...Caliphs don't chase girls
through the streets.

407
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:53,211
- Hurry, Omar, hurry.
- Oh, my boy.

408
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:08,790
ORANGE VENDOR: Stop that woman.
Stop her. Stop that woman.

409
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:12,890
Stop the thief. Grab that woman. Grab...

410
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:15,297
Where are they,
you sticky-fingered street girl?

411
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,937
Where are the oranges you stole?

412
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,801
Rest awhile, father of none
and son of hundreds.

413
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:23,466
- Rest till I learn if my daughter be harmed.
- It's all right. Let him go.

414
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:25,772
- Up then, toad.
- I'll have you jailed for this.

415
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:28,814
I'll have every last dinar and... It's the... l...

416
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:31,144
Come on, Father,
before he summons the police.

417
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:34,015
Marsinah, we don't run away
from the police. Not anymore.

418
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,178
Why not?

419
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,846
Because of what I hold behind my back.

420
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,219
- What?
- What does it sound like?

421
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,119
- Not copper pieces.
- Not copper pieces.

422
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:44,697
Suppose you could have anything
you ever wanted. What would you wish for?

423
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,356
- Breakfast.
- Oh, my dear child.

424
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,970
Let us have some breadth of vision.
Think big. Very big.

425
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:52,402
- The other half of the blanket.
- The other half... Oh!

426
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:55,202
We could buy
the other half of the blanket.

427
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,038
Good merchants,
set forth your silks and jewels...

428
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,306
...your finest garments
and sweetest perfumes.

429
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:03,918
- My daughter will purchase only the best.
MERCHANT: Who is this happy mad man?

430
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:05,780
Those who are slow to serve us...

431
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:08,752
...will naturally be the last
to receive our custom.

432
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:11,585
- It's gold. Gold.
- Gold.

433
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:15,860
Put it back where you got it.

434
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,760
Never fear, child.
It is honestly got, honestly got.

435
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:20,127
Oh, Father, I'm afraid.

436
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:22,963
Sweet Marsinah,
our frightened days are behind us.

437
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:25,799
Try to understand. We are rich.

438
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,407
You know the house
out near the pomegranate grove?

439
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:33,169
You mean the one I've always dreamed
we might someday...?

440
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:35,373
- We're that rich?
- Yes. Yes, my darling.

441
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,950
If it is still for sale, we can buy it.

442
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:41,486
But keep some of the money for yourself.
You talk only of things for me.

443
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:43,146
What does a poet need?

444
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:46,259
What can rival the beautiful things
that he invents in his head?

445
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,157
SLAVE TRADER: I have girls.
Able bodied slaves for sale or for rent.

446
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,730
Gathered from the four corners
of the Earth.

447
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,960
Able-bodied slaves for sale or for rent.

448
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:58,765
Gathered from the four corners of the earth.
One hundred dinar.

449
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,068
- Well, come to think of it.
- Think of what?

450
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:04,677
Well, you should have
maids and attendants now.

451
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:07,440
Fitting for a lady in your position.
Don't you think so?

452
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,516
- I wouldn't know what to do with them.
- Don't worry about that.

453
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:14,553
I'll get three or four.
No sense in being short-handed.

454
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:24,730
So many beautiful things.

455
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,662
What shall I buy?

456
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:33,205
BANGLEMAN:
Baubles, bangles and beads

457
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:34,636
MERCHANT 1:
Marsinah, buy from me

458
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,505
MERCHANT 2: Marsinah, buy from me
MERCHANT 3: Marsinah, lovely

459
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,445
MERCHANTS:
Marsinah, Marsinah, buy

460
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:44,278
SILK MERCHANTS:
Worms work on a Chinese terrace

461
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:47,114
Worms dream of a happy heiress

462
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:50,189
Wearing their wares

463
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:54,089
Answer their prayers

464
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:59,825
BANGLEMAN:
Baubles, bangles and beads

465
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:03,732
MARSINAH:
Baubles, bangles

466
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:07,397
Hear how they jing, jing-a-ling-a

467
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:12,911
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads

468
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:14,446
MERCHANTS:
Marsinah, buy from me

469
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:15,981
Marsinah, lovely

470
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,553
Marsinah, Marsinah, buy

471
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:24,385
Think upon the Macedonian oyster

472
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,689
Having indigestion in his watery cloister

473
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,355
So that Marsinah could have a pearl

474
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:37,493
- A pearl
- Baubles, bangles and beads

475
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:41,540
Baubles, bangles

476
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:45,736
Hear how they jing, jing-a-ling-a

477
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:52,910
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads

478
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,782
Sparkles, spangles

479
00:32:56,958 --> 00:33:00,758
My heart will sing, sing-a-ling-a

480
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:06,195
Wearing baubles, bangles

481
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:09,336
And beads

482
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:15,374
I'll glitter and gleam so

483
00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:22,039
Make somebody dream

484
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:27,313
So that someday he may

485
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:33,757
Buy me a ring, ring-a-ling-a

486
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:39,889
I've heard that's where it leads

487
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:45,529
Wearing baubles

488
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:49,302
Bangles

489
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:53,607
And beads

490
00:33:57,418 --> 00:33:59,978
CHORUS:
Ahhh

491
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:02,088
Ahhh

492
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:07,660
Baubles, bangles
Hear how they jing, jing-a-ling-a

493
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:13,324
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads

494
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:18,871
Sparkles, spangles
My heart will sing, sing-a-ling-a

495
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,240
Wearing baubles, bangles and beads

496
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:31,249
MARSINAH:
I'll glitter and gleam so

497
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:37,949
Make somebody dream

498
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:43,530
So that someday he may

499
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:49,728
- Buy me a ring, ring-a-ling-a
CHORUS: Oooh

500
00:34:49,904 --> 00:34:52,930
ALL:
I've heard that's where it leads

501
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:55,667
That's where it leads

502
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,870
CHORUS:
Wearing amulets, necklaces

503
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:03,244
Stars in one's hair

504
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:08,946
MARSINAH:
Wearing baubles

505
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:16,120
Bangles

506
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:23,828
And beads

507
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:31,636
BANGLEMAN:
Baubles, bangles and beads

508
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:52,789
Oh. Ladies.

509
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:57,864
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I feel that I'm wearying you.

510
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,063
Please rest a while.

511
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,676
WOMEN:
Oh, thank you, master.

512
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:04,978
Frankly, I've never owned slaves before.

513
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:07,114
I'm a bit vague
as to what your rights are.

514
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:08,646
We have none, master.

515
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:11,307
Your word is our law.

516
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:14,852
Well, then we certainly won't have
any trouble getting along, huh?

517
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:17,616
- You are sweet, master.
WOMEN: Oh, yes, you are.

518
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,818
Master, if I werert a slave,
I'd kiss you.

519
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:25,364
Oh, my dear child, feel free
to express your gratitude at all times.

520
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:28,661
One thing I will not have around the house
is class distinction.

521
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,379
- The Wazir's police.
- Oh!

522
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:40,946
Oh. Be not alarmed.

523
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:45,711
These fine constables can want nothing
from honest, well-to-do citizens.

524
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:48,879
- Nothing but your name, good sir.
- My name? Why, my name is...

525
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:50,182
Why do you ask?

526
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:53,953
Jawan the Brigand was recognized
in the bazaar this morning.

527
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,620
- I don't suppose you've seen him?
- Oh, no.

528
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,789
Very well. Name and place of residence?

529
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:04,768
Uh... Officer, I wonder if we couldn't
save ourselves much inconvenience.

530
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:09,171
I wonder if one piece of gold
would serve to identify me suffic...

531
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:11,573
- Not the whole thing.
- Do you admit possession?

532
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:15,580
Officer, let there be no misunderstanding.
That is my purse.

533
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,617
And it bears on it the sign
of the House of Achmed. Seize him.

534
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:20,549
- Sign of what?
- The House of Achmed...

535
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:23,121
...Iooted by thieves this last moon.

536
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,486
You, return these creatures
to the slave mongers.

537
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,853
Add the money to the evidence
against this thief. Take him to the Wazir.

538
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,760
The Wazir.

539
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:33,791
SUBALTERN:
Away.

540
00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:58,047
- Ah!
- Please don't scream.

541
00:37:58,225 --> 00:37:59,783
Heh. Why should I scream?

542
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:01,826
I followed you from the bazaar.

543
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:03,623
Yes.

544
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:06,733
Are you accustomed
to having men follow you?

545
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:10,194
Yes. Sometimes at great speed.

546
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,135
It is not fitting for you
to answer that way.

547
00:38:13,307 --> 00:38:15,241
You should have said, "No."

548
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:17,843
I think you have no humor.

549
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:19,673
Goodbye.

550
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,449
I had an uncle who laughed sometimes.

551
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:31,083
- Who are you?
- You may call me Haroun.

552
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:32,350
Oh, of course, I may.

553
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:37,623
I may call you Mameluke ben Goathead,
but who are you?

554
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:41,632
Please, I don't wish to say just yet.

555
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:43,368
Oh.

556
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:46,265
You're a criminal.

557
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,103
No, not a criminal.

558
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:52,643
At least, not in his eyes.

559
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,280
Not in whose eyes?

560
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:55,881
Why...

561
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,244
...AIlah's.

562
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,249
Mmm. Splendid reference.

563
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,980
Do you have any others? More local.

564
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:05,182
I'm afraid not. I am a stranger here.

565
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,122
Oh, not anymore, I hope.

566
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:08,921
Yes, I know.

567
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,690
That is not a fitting thing to say.

568
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,561
You are...

569
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:15,735
...very beautiful.

570
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:21,331
Probably it's just my pretty clothes
that attract you.

571
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:24,009
Having my hair combed...

572
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:25,270
...and my face washed.

573
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,471
Yes, that would make a difference.

574
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,148
Oh, I like you, stranger.

575
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:35,152
What is your business?
Your family's business?

576
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:36,482
We, uh...

577
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:39,683
- We try to make things grow.
- Oh.

578
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,691
Gardeners.

579
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:45,461
Gardeners.

580
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,192
Gardener...

581
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:52,635
Gardener, I do not think this is fitting.

582
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:58,039
No man has ever touched me before.

583
00:39:58,212 --> 00:40:00,544
And no other man ever shall.

584
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:02,611
It is his will.

585
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,547
I do not belong to you.

586
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,348
This time I'm speaking of Allah's will.

587
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:13,582
You are too confusing for me.

588
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,062
Please, take your hand away.

589
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,131
I cannot.

590
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,261
Please.

591
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:33,202
Oh, why do the leaves

592
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,871
Of the mulberry tree

593
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:41,317
Whisper differently now

594
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:46,859
And why is the nightingale
Singing at noon

595
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:51,760
On the mulberry bough

596
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:56,494
For some most mysterious reason

597
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:02,666
This isn't the garden I know

598
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:08,509
No, it's paradise now

599
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:14,450
That was only a garden

600
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:21,619
A moment ago

601
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:28,495
Take my hand

602
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:33,834
I'm a stranger in paradise

603
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:39,503
All lost in a wonderland

604
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,743
A stranger in paradise

605
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:49,185
If I stand starry-eyed

606
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:53,884
That's a danger in paradise

607
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:59,465
For mortals who stand beside

608
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:05,529
An angel like you

609
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,742
I saw your face

610
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:14,347
And I ascended

611
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:20,385
Out of the commonplace into the rare

612
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:23,648
Somewhere in space

613
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:28,727
I hang suspended

614
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:34,698
Until I know

615
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:38,599
There's a chance

616
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:44,404
That you care

617
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:52,480
Wort you answer the fervent prayer

618
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,885
Of a stranger in paradise

619
00:42:57,057 --> 00:43:01,391
Don't send me in dark despair

620
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:05,328
From all that I hunger for

621
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:10,061
But open your angel's arms

622
00:43:10,237 --> 00:43:15,869
To the stranger in paradise

623
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:19,103
And tell him

624
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,150
That he need be

625
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:30,421
A stranger

626
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:37,588
No more

627
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,962
You say you're a gardener.

628
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:45,230
What flowers should I plant
along the fence?

629
00:43:45,406 --> 00:43:48,136
I must go in a moment.
Will you meet me here this evening?

630
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:52,541
I thought hyacinths,
but perhaps oleanders.

631
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,807
At moonrise? Here in the garden? Please.

632
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:57,678
Yes.

633
00:43:57,851 --> 00:43:59,375
Yes, of course.

634
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,420
- Until tonight.
- Tonight.

635
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:05,353
You won't forget? You won't fail me?

636
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:12,756
I saw your face

637
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:17,203
And I ascended

638
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:20,602
Out of the commonplace

639
00:44:20,774 --> 00:44:24,266
Into the rare

640
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:28,006
BOTH:
Somewhere in space

641
00:44:28,182 --> 00:44:32,312
I hang suspended

642
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:34,613
MARSINAH:
Until I know

643
00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:36,847
CALIPH:
Till the moment I know

644
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:39,288
There's a chance that you care

645
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,088
There's a chance that you care

646
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:47,393
Wort you answer the fervent prayer

647
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:51,095
Of a stranger in paradise

648
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:55,173
Don't send me in dark despair

649
00:44:55,342 --> 00:44:59,369
From all that I hunger for

650
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:04,006
BOTH:
But open your angel's arms

651
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:09,816
To the stranger in paradise

652
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:16,987
And tell me that I need be

653
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,366
A stranger

654
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:28,532
No more

655
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:51,290
Bow low for the mighty Wazir.

656
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:55,993
SUBALTERN:
Bow low for the mighty Wazir.

657
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:21,685
Silence then obedience.
The court of justice convenes.

658
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,888
The court begins its meditations.

659
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:28,099
"The case of the seller of candlesticks,
Ibn Nuwas...

660
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:31,362
...charged with breaking the pottery pots
of Ali Dah doud."

661
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,871
Illustrious Wazir, Ibn Nuwas pleads
for a postponement of judgment...

662
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,942
...until his broken legs are mended.

663
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,103
He fell from a cushion
while being questioned.

664
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:42,373
Next case.

665
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,813
Great Wazir,
we have apprehended a thief...

666
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:47,977
...with a hundred pieces of gold
taken from the house of Achmed.

667
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:50,089
Let him appear.

668
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,067
Oh. At last, good fortune returns to me.

669
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,332
Good fortune?

670
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:10,409
The noble Wazir himself,
sitting in judgment.

671
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,478
Who could ask for a more righteous,
a fairer, a finer judge?

672
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:15,444
I loathe fawning criminals.

673
00:47:15,616 --> 00:47:18,517
- He doesn't talk like a thief.
POET: Oh.

674
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:22,412
Let your loveliness be the loot,
O princess...

675
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,489
...and every man is a thief.

676
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:25,852
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
Silence.

677
00:47:27,728 --> 00:47:29,252
Oh, let him chatter a bit.

678
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,830
- The evidence against this criminal is as fo...
- I need no evidence.

679
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,297
Under the laws of Baghdad...

680
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:38,905
...I order that the right hand
of this liar, rogue and thief be cut off.

681
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:41,404
Have you aught to say
before sentence is executed?

682
00:47:41,575 --> 00:47:44,806
Well, that I am a liar,
I am not a big enough liar to deny.

683
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:47,606
That I am a rogue can be verified
by anyone who knows me.

684
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:51,342
And that I am a thief is as true
as if it were written in the Koran.

685
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:53,008
But, in this particular case...

686
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:55,780
...I say, for the first time in my life,
I am innocent.

687
00:47:55,956 --> 00:48:00,120
I dislike being mocked in public.
Add 20 lashes to my sentence.

688
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,159
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
Are you done with your protest?

689
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:04,661
It is rather expensive,
but I should like to continue.

690
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:07,459
I can understand your indifference
that I am innocent...

691
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,295
...O dispenser of justice.

692
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,461
I, the pick purse, the brawler,
the collector of women, innocent?

693
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,163
I can hardly believe my own ears.

694
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:18,607
Tell me, what sort of women
did you prey upon?

695
00:48:19,913 --> 00:48:22,575
Till I beheld you, O princess...

696
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:25,616
...my memory of them
was that they were all beautiful.

697
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:27,720
Oh! It's his tongue
that should be cut off.

698
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:30,120
But let the sentence stand.
Right hand off.

699
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,647
Oh, noble Wazir.

700
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,454
I assure you that I despise innocence
as much as you.

701
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:37,119
It is at best a temporary state.

702
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:40,789
- What are you bothering me about?
- The small matter of losing my right hand.

703
00:48:40,968 --> 00:48:43,869
As a poet and storyteller,
the loss would cripple my career.

704
00:48:44,037 --> 00:48:47,495
- Scoundrel. I'm leaving you your mouth.
- Hold.

705
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,165
For that simple sentence,
you needed your hand.

706
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,177
It is the gesture which tells the story.
Let me convince you.

707
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,644
LALUME:
Oh, let him.

708
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:57,812
I love being convinced.

709
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:10,385
Dear hand, deft hand

710
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:14,898
Clever and facile extremity

711
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:18,629
Fond companion to me

712
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:21,968
From my birth

713
00:49:22,142 --> 00:49:25,771
Sweet hand, swift hand

714
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:30,383
Spinner of fable and fantasy

715
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,384
Faithful friend of my art

716
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,990
Would they rend us apart

717
00:49:38,158 --> 00:49:42,595
Leaving no finger or fist there

718
00:49:42,763 --> 00:49:47,223
But just the hint of a wrist there

719
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,837
Where then my spirited wit
My mercurial charm

720
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:54,531
Am I fated to sit
With an elbow and arm

721
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:59,407
And no digits to top them off

722
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,913
If they lop them off

723
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:06,346
How could I plead to you?
How could I pray to you?

724
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,954
How intercede with you?
What could I say to you?

725
00:50:09,122 --> 00:50:12,614
Like a dog with no tail
Like a spoutless whale

726
00:50:12,793 --> 00:50:14,920
Like an elephant sunk
If you cut off his trunk

727
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,063
Hold

728
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:24,227
I'd like to hear a little more

729
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:36,582
When you tell a story
Amorous or gory

730
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,446
You can tell it best
If you gesticulate

731
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,588
Suppose the mighty Sinbad
Meets a jinn who's been bad

732
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:45,088
They will guess the rest
If you gesticulate

733
00:50:45,425 --> 00:50:47,086
A tongue is a tongue
A lung is a lung

734
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,696
And a tale you can shout or sing
Without the gesture, nothing

735
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:51,888
Nothing.

736
00:50:52,065 --> 00:50:54,625
Should Scheherazade
Undulate her body

737
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,393
That can be expressed if you ges...

738
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,901
Can be assessed if you ges...

739
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:03,600
She'll be undressed
If you gesticulate

740
00:51:04,444 --> 00:51:09,711
If I tell you I was walking by the sea
And found a genie in a bottle

741
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:11,407
- That's trite
CHORUS: Quite

742
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:13,485
For practically everyone has seen a genie

743
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,883
Someone had to throttle
In a bottle

744
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:19,048
Right, but if I say the bottle

745
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:21,387
Was so teeny

746
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:23,153
So teeny

747
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,321
And so was the genie

748
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,558
So was the genie

749
00:51:27,734 --> 00:51:30,669
Until with trembling hand

750
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,737
I pulled the cork

751
00:51:34,074 --> 00:51:37,339
And threw the jug
And covered up my eyes

752
00:51:38,044 --> 00:51:43,710
And the smoke began to curl
And the smoke began to swirl

753
00:51:43,884 --> 00:51:46,978
And it swirled and it curled
And it curled and it swirled

754
00:51:47,154 --> 00:51:50,419
As higher it did rise

755
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:53,616
Till it was so high

756
00:51:53,794 --> 00:51:55,318
CHORUS:
So high

757
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:57,725
And so was the genie

758
00:51:57,898 --> 00:51:59,490
So was the genie

759
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:04,763
- Then two great arms reached down
CHORUS: Two great arms

760
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:06,530
- And lifted me up
CHORUS: Up

761
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,071
- Up, up
CHORUS: Up, up

762
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:11,768
- Into the sky
CHORUS: So high, so high

763
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:15,278
And we did fly

764
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:16,574
CHORUS:
And he did fly

765
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,274
The genie and I

766
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:19,611
CHORUS:
How he did fly

767
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:22,687
- We did sail
- Did sail

768
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:26,019
- Did sail
- Did sail

769
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:27,387
Is this a tale?

770
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,823
CHORUS:
This is a tale

771
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:31,156
- Are you convinced?
- We are convinced

772
00:52:31,331 --> 00:52:32,457
You see

773
00:52:32,632 --> 00:52:38,537
You see

774
00:52:38,705 --> 00:52:41,401
For the facile finger
Listeners will linger

775
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,167
They will be impressed if you ges-

776
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:44,742
Applaud with zest if you ges...

777
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,175
If it's a question of a story, gory

778
00:52:47,347 --> 00:52:48,644
Sinbad, in bed

779
00:52:48,815 --> 00:52:52,410
Bottle, smoke, genie, arms
Fly, sky, high, I state

780
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,814
Reiterate

781
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:56,478
POET AND CHORUS:
Gesticulate

782
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:57,953
With your hands

783
00:52:58,124 --> 00:53:05,030
With your hands

784
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,767
Rather clever, you must admit.

785
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:14,096
Too clever. Much too clever
for an ordinary sort of thief.

786
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,834
I'm sure he's stolen
more than a hundred pieces of gold.

787
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,477
Where have you hidden the money?

788
00:53:18,645 --> 00:53:22,411
Believe me, great sir,
I have stolen nothing.

789
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:24,049
Both hands off for that lie.

790
00:53:24,217 --> 00:53:27,584
What money I have was given me
for removing a curse from a mars head.

791
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:29,915
Oh, you presume to have power
over curses?

792
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:33,548
The power of prayer is infinite, Great Wazir.
And I pray exceedingly well.

793
00:53:33,727 --> 00:53:35,786
Send men to his home.
Bring me who you find.

794
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,190
- All his confederates.
- No.

795
00:53:37,364 --> 00:53:39,457
No, there is no one in my home,
no one at all.

796
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,363
Only a wretched, half-mad daughter,
ugly, cackle-voiced.

797
00:53:42,535 --> 00:53:43,934
Please, she had done no wrong.

798
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:47,596
Oh, we've touched a sore spot.
We're on the trail now. Go, hurry

799
00:53:47,774 --> 00:53:50,607
Yes, Great Wazir. Where do you live?

800
00:53:52,913 --> 00:53:54,471
You refuse to answer?

801
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,809
You dare to refuse to answer?

802
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,679
May Allah curse you.
May calamity strike you.

803
00:53:59,853 --> 00:54:01,218
May disaster overwhelm you.

804
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:04,050
May you be driven from this palace,
kicked into the road.

805
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:05,316
A curse on your head.

806
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,393
A curse on the head
of the Wazir of Police. Ah. Aah!

807
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,857
POLICEMAN:
Exalted Wazir.

808
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:14,832
- Exalted Wazir, we have captured Jawan.
JAWAN: Let me go.

809
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,469
Let me go. Let me go.

810
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,966
There he is. The cheat.

811
00:54:22,142 --> 00:54:23,575
The pretender of powers.

812
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:28,976
Let me tear out his liver.
Let me rip his belly to ribbons.

813
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:31,811
He removed a curse from me
for 100 pieces of gold.

814
00:54:31,985 --> 00:54:34,510
And he swore I'd find my son
before this day was over.

815
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,953
Where, you dog of a thief,
where is my son?

816
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:40,490
Oh, mighty Wazir,
have your men release me.

817
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,184
Gaah!

818
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:47,231
Allah be praised. Allah is merciful.
And Mohammed is his prophet.

819
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,992
That amulet around your neck.

820
00:54:49,169 --> 00:54:51,933
Oh, mighty Wazir,
answer an old man one question.

821
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:53,834
Where did you get it?

822
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:57,101
This amulet's been with me
since childhood.

823
00:54:57,277 --> 00:55:02,840
At last I have found you.
Ali, my little Ali.

824
00:55:03,016 --> 00:55:05,041
What does this mean?

825
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:07,642
I am your father.

826
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,849
JAWAN:
Oh, Ali, the light of my soul.

827
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:15,454
I put that amulet around your neck
one week before you were kidnapped.

828
00:55:15,628 --> 00:55:16,856
Look.

829
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,793
Here's the other piece.

830
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:20,899
See how they match.

831
00:55:25,772 --> 00:55:28,707
Why, they fit perfectly.

832
00:55:29,642 --> 00:55:31,576
Yes, of course.

833
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:35,639
Oh, forgive my taunts, Hajj the Beggar,
forgive me.

834
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,075
Allah be praised.

835
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:44,019
A man with the power to curse
and uncurse. A magician-beggar.

836
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,687
JAWAN:
Oh, speak to me, speak to me.

837
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,658
My father's heart aches
for one word from its son.

838
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:51,888
I'll attend to you in a moment.

839
00:55:52,065 --> 00:55:57,196
Oh! What a glorious end
to all of my search. Oh.

840
00:55:58,304 --> 00:56:01,705
Speak to me, speak to me.

841
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:04,810
You are Jawan, the robber and murderer.
Is that true?

842
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:08,243
Yes, I'm too overcome
to say much more.

843
00:56:08,415 --> 00:56:11,748
You said enough. You've confessed
to being a criminal of the worst sort.

844
00:56:11,918 --> 00:56:13,909
Take him to the dungeons
and dispose of him.

845
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:15,452
But I am your father.

846
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:19,183
All the more reason to be rid of you.
For the leading judge of Mesopotamia...

847
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,090
...to have as a father the leading criminal
of Mesopotamia, a disturbing thought.

848
00:56:23,263 --> 00:56:27,666
Oh, let me something other from
my sors lips than a sentence to death.

849
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:31,600
- To the dungeons with him.
- Oh, but my Ali. Just to be near my Ali.

850
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:34,399
My baby, my little baby.

851
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:38,442
Ali, Ali, the light of my life, my soul.

852
00:56:38,611 --> 00:56:39,873
My sun, my stars, the moon.

853
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:43,948
Never have I seen
a more touching reconciliation.

854
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:47,678
- We can use this man.
- Yes.

855
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:49,515
Yes, I rather think so.

856
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:52,055
Have the kindness
to have your menials release me.

857
00:56:52,225 --> 00:56:55,160
Oh. Yeah, you heard him,
release him. Heh.

858
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:01,566
Wait.

859
00:57:02,268 --> 00:57:05,863
Wait, oh, what an idiot I am.

860
00:57:06,706 --> 00:57:09,072
Did you not place a curse upon my head?

861
00:57:09,242 --> 00:57:11,369
With all the venom you could summon?

862
00:57:11,544 --> 00:57:15,139
What became of that curse?
What became of that curse?

863
00:57:19,285 --> 00:57:22,743
Let all mouths close but mine.

864
00:57:24,424 --> 00:57:29,487
HERALD:
Let all mouths close but mine.

865
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:39,371
The holy, the good, the wise,
the just, the omnipotent...

866
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,939
...the commander of the faithful.

867
00:57:42,108 --> 00:57:46,408
Nenone al Raschid Ben Mohammet
ibn Khasimoun...

868
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:48,740
...the Caliph.

869
00:57:53,953 --> 00:57:57,753
Arise, my subjects. Arise and rejoice.

870
00:57:57,924 --> 00:58:01,360
Even the walls of my chambers
rejoice at Your Highness' presence.

871
00:58:01,528 --> 00:58:04,019
Your Caliph rejoices
at the tidings he brings.

872
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:08,827
He is pleased to notify his Wazir
that he has chosen a bride.

873
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,093
See that the proper proclamations
are made.

874
00:58:11,271 --> 00:58:14,331
Tell the foreign embassies
all candidates for the Caliph's hand...

875
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:16,168
...should return to their homes.

876
00:58:16,342 --> 00:58:20,142
May every citizen
share his Caliph's happiness.

877
00:58:37,463 --> 00:58:38,555
Ruined.

878
00:58:53,513 --> 00:58:57,813
WAZIR: Ruined, hopelessly,
utterly, gracelessly ruined.

879
00:58:57,984 --> 00:59:02,011
Who could have put this wicked spell
upon me? Who?

880
00:59:02,255 --> 00:59:04,223
- The beggar.
- You sent for me?

881
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,553
You. It was you who did this.

882
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,223
Reverse my decision in the case
of Hajj the Beggar. Magician.

883
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,563
- Restore all his gold to him.
- Yes, Great Wazir.

884
00:59:18,738 --> 00:59:21,798
Heh-heh.
Now, let's come to terms quickly.

885
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,103
How much to lift that curse of yours?

886
00:59:25,278 --> 00:59:27,872
Forgive me, but I can do no more today.

887
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,538
Consider what I've already done.

888
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:33,481
Suppose we should raise you
to the rank of emir?

889
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:36,622
Emir? Me? An emir?

890
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:38,654
Lalume,
an emir is second only to me.

891
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,055
Don't haggle with the wizard.

892
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:44,321
He may take offense and turn you
into something worse than you are.

893
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,522
My daughter and I...

894
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:47,996
...members of the nobility.

895
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,830
But only if you undo the harm you've
caused and prevent the Caliph's marriage.

896
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,270
Prevent the Caliph's marriage?
Oh-ho-ho, but you are too kind.

897
00:59:55,441 --> 00:59:58,274
It is overwhelming. What a day.

898
00:59:58,444 --> 01:00:01,880
But how could one possibly refuse
such an offer?

899
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:03,948
And how can one possibly accept it?

900
01:00:04,117 --> 01:00:06,278
Don't tell me you doubt your power.

901
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:07,578
Indeed I do.

902
01:00:07,754 --> 01:00:11,246
As a matter of fact, each time it functions,
I am more and more astonished.

903
01:00:11,424 --> 01:00:14,393
Still it does function. We've seen it.

904
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:16,455
Yes.

905
01:00:17,063 --> 01:00:20,396
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

906
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,528
- Noble Wazir, I accept your offer.
- Done.

907
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,830
SUBALTERN: Great Wazir.
- Yes?

908
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:29,072
- Shall we dismiss the court?
- No, I feel good.

909
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:31,335
I'll sentence the rest of the criminals
before my nap.

910
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:38,441
Come here.

911
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,290
You know when really angered at someone,
my husband usually drops him alive...

912
01:00:50,463 --> 01:00:53,660
...from a high battlement
onto a long hook.

913
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:56,927
Thus will you be impaled
when he discovers you're a fraud.

914
01:00:57,103 --> 01:01:00,163
Then, may I make a suggestion?
Let's not tell him.

915
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,069
He doesn't need to be told.

916
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,709
He'll know the moment
the Caliph marries.

917
01:01:04,877 --> 01:01:07,209
That is why I hesitated
before accepting his offer.

918
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,076
But, well, love is an uncertain business.

919
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:14,015
And if lover's quarrel,
as young lovers often do, then I'm an emir.

920
01:01:14,187 --> 01:01:16,485
If not, well, that is kismet.

921
01:01:16,656 --> 01:01:19,022
You'd gamble your life
on such a slim chance?

922
01:01:19,192 --> 01:01:22,184
Princess, I have risked floggings
for a handful of dates.

923
01:01:22,362 --> 01:01:24,227
I envy you.

924
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:26,422
Every moment an adventure.

925
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,932
A life totally without monotony.

926
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,231
Yes. That you can say for it.

927
01:01:34,574 --> 01:01:37,805
Since my so-called marriage to the Wazir,
I have waked each morning...

928
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:40,912
...with the chart of my day
staring down at me from the ceiling.

929
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,014
The path of every hour already mapped.

930
01:01:43,182 --> 01:01:45,377
And the map of each hour the same.

931
01:01:45,551 --> 01:01:47,143
Have you ever known that torment?

932
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,720
It is one of the few I have been spared.

933
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:51,789
You are fortunate.

934
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,422
Afternoons dull

935
01:01:57,597 --> 01:01:59,622
Mornings duller

936
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:04,862
Duller the nights before

937
01:02:05,037 --> 01:02:10,065
Suddenly you
Suddenly color

938
01:02:10,243 --> 01:02:12,768
I suddenly see

939
01:02:12,945 --> 01:02:17,405
Monotony for me

940
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:24,580
Will be no more

941
01:02:25,558 --> 01:02:32,555
Bored by the night and the day was I

942
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:37,264
Seldom gay was I

943
01:02:37,437 --> 01:02:41,168
Before now

944
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:46,437
In a world without you was I

945
01:02:46,612 --> 01:02:50,912
And I was bored

946
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:55,213
So bored

947
01:02:55,388 --> 01:03:01,293
Then came your eyes compelling me

948
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:05,124
Telling me something wild

949
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:10,167
On your lips lay adventure

950
01:03:10,336 --> 01:03:16,070
And lightning flashed
When you smiled

951
01:03:16,242 --> 01:03:19,473
So smile now

952
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:24,844
Wake the fires that sleep in me

953
01:03:25,017 --> 01:03:29,078
Make them leap in me

954
01:03:29,255 --> 01:03:32,349
With your kiss

955
01:03:32,525 --> 01:03:38,054
And whatever it is I'll be

956
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:42,327
I won't be bored

957
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:46,097
Not bored

958
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:50,174
Bedeviled, yes

959
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:55,036
Bedazzled, yes

960
01:03:55,214 --> 01:03:59,446
Bewildered and breathless, yes

961
01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:05,455
But not bored

962
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:10,289
How could I ever be bored

963
01:04:10,463 --> 01:04:17,460
Not with your lips on mine

964
01:04:17,637 --> 01:04:21,971
Your magical lips

965
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:27,169
Pressed on mine

966
01:04:27,346 --> 01:04:30,679
Not bored

967
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:35,981
I will never again

968
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:43,152
Be bored

969
01:04:54,996 --> 01:04:57,487
What kind of a sentence did he get?

970
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:01,630
Your gold.

971
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,677
The Caliph's trumpeters.

972
01:05:21,923 --> 01:05:23,788
WOMAN:
Look, they're beautiful.

973
01:05:30,231 --> 01:05:34,827
Silence, you fools.
Silence, you caterwauling trulls.

974
01:05:45,446 --> 01:05:49,382
Well, beggar,
why do you not begin your magic?

975
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:50,744
Now?

976
01:05:50,918 --> 01:05:54,410
Could it be that our great wizard
does not know what the music means?

977
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:56,921
The Caliph is on his way
to fetch his bride.

978
01:05:57,091 --> 01:05:59,651
What? Are you certain?

979
01:05:59,827 --> 01:06:01,055
Why are you disturbed?

980
01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:03,789
Did you not promise
to stop this wedding?

981
01:06:03,965 --> 01:06:08,527
Great sir, as I've already told you,
I've exhausted today's rations of powers.

982
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:10,364
- I couldn't possibly...
- I see. Guard.

983
01:06:10,538 --> 01:06:13,701
WAZIR:
Guards, draw swords.

984
01:06:18,413 --> 01:06:20,005
Guards, this reluctant magician...

985
01:06:20,181 --> 01:06:22,741
...is not to leave the palace
under any circumstances.

986
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:27,854
He has a tremendous spell to weave,
in which I'm sure he will not fail.

987
01:06:28,022 --> 01:06:30,718
However, should he fail...

988
01:06:30,892 --> 01:06:33,884
- Executioner.
- Executioner forward.

989
01:06:34,529 --> 01:06:40,468
Executioner, prepare the room
of the 29 fires.

990
01:06:41,602 --> 01:06:44,036
Watch him carefully, he's slippery.

991
01:06:44,205 --> 01:06:47,368
But I suspect that he is not fireproof.

992
01:07:04,492 --> 01:07:06,084
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

993
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,887
I'm calling on my powers.

994
01:07:09,831 --> 01:07:11,992
Assist me, all of you.

995
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:19,999
Oh, powers above and powers below.

996
01:07:20,641 --> 01:07:23,633
Ye who weaves
at your tanglesome skeins...

997
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:26,575
...and daily spins the tapestry
of agony and joy...

998
01:07:26,747 --> 01:07:30,046
...that mortals call the history of man...

999
01:07:30,218 --> 01:07:33,016
...cup thy ear to Hajj the Beggar.

1000
01:07:33,187 --> 01:07:35,348
Aye, shabash.

1001
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:49,603
Goat of Mendes.

1002
01:07:49,837 --> 01:07:51,429
Baphomet.

1003
01:07:52,073 --> 01:07:54,974
Blight and blast our Caliph's love.

1004
01:07:55,142 --> 01:07:58,441
Twice this day hast thou seen
fit to grant what I ween.

1005
01:07:58,613 --> 01:08:00,012
Twice this day has thou let...

1006
01:08:00,181 --> 01:08:02,376
...Hajj's humble prayer
climb up heavers stair.

1007
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:05,451
And kismet so ordained.
My goal should be attained.

1008
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,316
Another prayer, another cry.

1009
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:11,981
Grant again, grant it,
I ask thee now, ask thee now.

1010
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,856
Kismet, mystery of fate.

1011
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:36,348
Fate

1012
01:08:36,517 --> 01:08:41,750
Heed me as I lower my knee

1013
01:08:41,923 --> 01:08:45,791
A beggar begging your ear

1014
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:52,957
To hear his plea

1015
01:08:53,434 --> 01:08:58,997
Fate, let the sound of my voice beguile

1016
01:08:59,173 --> 01:09:02,700
Look with love on your slave below

1017
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:07,405
And show your smile

1018
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:11,575
'Tis but a trifle I ask

1019
01:09:11,752 --> 01:09:14,721
That in the master design

1020
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:21,795
Which you have written and sealed
You change one line

1021
01:09:21,963 --> 01:09:24,329
This love that mustrt be

1022
01:09:25,066 --> 01:09:26,931
This he, this she

1023
01:09:28,269 --> 01:09:30,464
Turn her smile into scorn

1024
01:09:30,638 --> 01:09:32,128
Turn his heart into stone

1025
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:36,538
- Turn the honey on their lips to brine
CHORUS: Ohhh

1026
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:38,042
POET:
Then fate

1027
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:45,209
The day is mine

1028
01:10:58,826 --> 01:11:00,794
CALIPH AND CHORUS:
Play on the cymbal

1029
01:11:00,961 --> 01:11:02,656
The timbal, the lyre

1030
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:05,731
Play with appropriate passion

1031
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:11,270
Fashion songs
of delight and delicious desire

1032
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:16,342
For the night of my nights

1033
01:11:17,178 --> 01:11:21,410
Come where the so well-beloved
Is waiting

1034
01:11:21,582 --> 01:11:25,416
Where the rose and the jasmine mingle

1035
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:29,522
While I tell her the moon is for mating

1036
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:35,094
And 'tis sin to be single

1037
01:11:35,262 --> 01:11:37,230
CALIPH:
Let peacocks and monkeys

1038
01:11:37,398 --> 01:11:39,491
In purple adornings

1039
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:43,694
Show her the way
To my bridal chamber

1040
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:47,830
Then get you gone
Till the morn of my mornings

1041
01:11:48,008 --> 01:11:51,967
After the night of my nights

1042

Of my mornings

CALIPH:
'Tis the night of my nights

1060
01:13:14,562 --> 01:13:16,052
MAN:
Marsinah.

1061
01:13:22,636 --> 01:13:24,934
MARSINAH: Father?
- Oh, Marsinah.

1062
01:13:25,105 --> 01:13:27,938
Thank heavens I found you.
I've looked everywhere for you.

1063
01:13:28,108 --> 01:13:29,132
I can't explain now.

1064
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,676
- But we have to make a trip to Damascus.
- Damascus?

1065
01:13:31,846 --> 01:13:34,679
Oh, my poor father.
Some angry husband again?

1066
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:38,376
Oh, no, it's much worse than that.
I'm in great danger of the Wazir.

1067
01:13:38,552 --> 01:13:41,180
His police may be here at any moment.
Come.

1068
01:13:41,355 --> 01:13:44,119
- The Wazir?
- Yes, Marsinah, I can't explain now.

1069
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:46,521
- Look I'll tell you all about it as we go.
- Oh.

1070
01:13:47,928 --> 01:13:50,123
Father, Father, I can't leave now.

1071
01:13:50,297 --> 01:13:52,231
But this is a matter of life or death.

1072
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:54,993
But I was to meet someone here.
Someone...

1073
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:58,498
Police.

1074
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:17,454
MAN 1:
To the bride of the Caliph. Ha-ha.

1075
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:21,026
MAN 2: To the second and third
and future wives...

1076
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:24,995
...the All Highest will take
now that he has a first wife.

1077
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:28,532
And to the silks he shall buy her.
And the satins and the jewels.

1078
01:14:28,702 --> 01:14:32,194
- Gentlemen, to polygamy.
MEN: To polygamy.

1079
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:36,366
So you see, instead of becoming an emir,
I have incurred the wrath of the Wazir.

1080
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:40,479
- Do you understand now why we must flee?
- Yes, I understand.

1081
01:14:48,355 --> 01:14:52,348
Help me saddle this beast and we'll get
out of here. I'll leave a fair price for him.

1082
01:14:52,526 --> 01:14:54,494
MAN 1: Out of the way.
MAN 2: Get out of the way.

1083
01:14:54,662 --> 01:14:56,789
- Look.
- Where is Hassan?

1084
01:14:56,964 --> 01:14:58,864
Procession is returning
without the bride.

1085
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:01,558
Can't be true.
Why would any woman run from the Caliph?

1086
01:15:01,735 --> 01:15:05,136
- She just wasrt there.
- News will be all over Baghdad by morning.

1087
01:15:05,306 --> 01:15:06,967
Did you hear?

1088
01:15:07,141 --> 01:15:09,701
It isn't true. It can't be.

1089
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:12,812
On the contrary, it must be.

1090
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:16,947
Father, you frighten me.
What are you going to do?

1091
01:15:17,117 --> 01:15:19,585
Return to the palace
and become an emir.

1092
01:15:19,753 --> 01:15:20,777
- No.
- But Marsinah.

1093
01:15:20,955 --> 01:15:22,946
- No, I won't let you.
- But, Marsinah.

1094
01:15:23,123 --> 01:15:26,183
You're not going to put yourself
into the clutches of that butcher.

1095
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,987
- Marsinah.
- You're no more of a magician...

1096
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:31,288
...than he is. Than that camel is.

1097
01:15:31,465 --> 01:15:34,059
Marsinah. Now, listen,
you must wait here.

1098
01:15:34,234 --> 01:15:38,170
If I have not returned before dawn,
you go swiftly and secretly to Damascus.

1099
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:41,502
Here's what's left of our gold.
Ample to buy your living for years.

1100
01:15:41,675 --> 01:15:45,270
Keep 10 gold pieces so that you can have
a dowry and marry a man of substance.

1101
01:15:45,446 --> 01:15:49,348
And keep still another 10 in case
that your husband should be mean or cruel.

1102
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,183
You give me this...

1103
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,318
...instead of my father.

1104
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:57,987
Marsinah, when a mars fortune
is on the rise...

1105
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:00,592
...he knows it beyond logic,
beyond reason.

1106
01:16:01,428 --> 01:16:02,827
Trust me as you always have.

1107
01:16:02,997 --> 01:16:05,090
- But I'm content the way we are.
- And?

1108
01:16:05,265 --> 01:16:08,666
We have more than enough money
to satisfy us.

1109
01:16:08,836 --> 01:16:11,168
Only a fool would risk his neck for more.

1110
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:14,466
No, Marsinah, come here.

1111
01:16:17,978 --> 01:16:23,439
A fool sat beneath an olive tree

1112
01:16:23,617 --> 01:16:27,383
And a wondrous thought had he

1113
01:16:27,554 --> 01:16:33,151
So he rose and he told it to the sky
And where was I?

1114
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:37,320
Behind the tree I overheard

1115
01:16:37,498 --> 01:16:43,130
His reverie

1116
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:49,534
Why be content with an olive
When you could have the tree?

1117
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:56,309
Why be content to be nothing
When there's nothing you couldn't be?

1118
01:16:56,483 --> 01:16:58,951
Why be contented with one olive tree

1119
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:02,577
When you could have
The whole olive grove?

1120
01:17:02,756 --> 01:17:08,888
Why be content with a grove
When you could have the world?

1121
01:17:09,897 --> 01:17:15,267
The fool stood beneath the olive tree

1122
01:17:15,436 --> 01:17:19,634
"What a wondrous thought," said he

1123
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:23,573
But alas, it is very, very deep

1124
01:17:23,744 --> 01:17:27,544
And so he yawned and went to sleep

1125
01:17:27,714 --> 01:17:30,444
Because, you see

1126
01:17:30,617 --> 01:17:37,420
He was a fool

1127
01:17:37,724 --> 01:17:43,720
Why be content with an olive
When you could have the tree?

1128
01:17:43,897 --> 01:17:50,097
That which has lulled you to sleep, fool
Has awakened me

1129
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:56,300
Why should I sigh that my lot is my lot
That I can't make it anything more

1130
01:17:56,477 --> 01:17:58,104
When that is a lie

1131
01:17:58,278 --> 01:18:03,716
An excuse for a fool to snore

1132
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:07,718
I walked

1133
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:11,790
From behind the olive tree

1134
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:16,521
With a wondrous change in me

1135
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:20,827
For I walked with my eye upon a star

1136
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:25,233
If you have heard and do not heed

1137
01:18:25,405 --> 01:18:28,533
There is a word

1138
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:34,375
For what you are

1139
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:40,043
And, oh, my friend

1140
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:45,715
The word is

1141
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:53,724
Fool

1142
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,600
Lalume.

1143
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:13,049
Bow low for the Mighty Wazir.

1144
01:19:13,453 --> 01:19:15,318
- Lalume.
LALUME: My lord?

1145
01:19:17,824 --> 01:19:20,258
Lalume, he's succeeded.
Our wizard has succeeded.

1146
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:22,054
I'm not surprised, are you?

1147
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:23,662
I am flooded with relief.

1148
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:25,889
Had the Caliph
married that backyard bride...

1149
01:19:26,066 --> 01:19:28,466
...why, I truly believe
I'd have had to kill myself.

1150
01:19:28,635 --> 01:19:33,004
My dear husband,
you will never have to kill yourself.

1151
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:36,002
Now, where is he now, do you suppose?

1152
01:19:36,176 --> 01:19:38,508
I shall have to destroy him
as soon as possible.

1153
01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:39,703
Destroy him? Why?

1154
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,940
A man who's abetted me in
a treasonable act, knowing what he knows,

1155
01:19:43,116 --> 01:19:44,811
how could I let him live?

1156
01:19:44,985 --> 01:19:46,577
Of course.

1157
01:19:47,221 --> 01:19:49,212
But what a pity though.

1158
01:19:49,389 --> 01:19:51,983
Think of the power
you are throwing away.

1159
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:55,651
Imagine the Wazir of police
with a wizard in his employ.

1160
01:19:55,829 --> 01:19:57,729
Power within power.

1161
01:19:57,898 --> 01:19:59,331
Power.

1162
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,692
- Yes.
- You could change the face of Baghdad.

1163
01:20:02,869 --> 01:20:05,963
All Persia.
All Arabia might be yours.

1164
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:08,573
Oh, wise, Lalume.

1165
01:20:08,742 --> 01:20:12,838
We must befriend him.
Make him a permanent guest in our home.

1166
01:20:13,013 --> 01:20:15,880
Then persuade him
to put his talents to our use.

1167
01:20:16,049 --> 01:20:17,380
But perhaps he won't return.

1168
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:18,916
- Perhaps he...
- He will return.

1169
01:20:19,086 --> 01:20:21,748
- How can you be sure?
- You'd just be angry if I told you.

1170
01:20:21,922 --> 01:20:24,482
- Oh, nevertheless, I wish he would... Oh!
- Your wish is my command.

1171
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:27,889
Oh. Greetings, great wizard. Heh.

1172
01:20:28,061 --> 01:20:31,087
Well done. Excellently done.

1173
01:20:31,265 --> 01:20:32,459
I thank you.

1174
01:20:32,633 --> 01:20:36,501
Oh, your patent of nobility
awaits only your signature.

1175
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,230
Your coronet,
I shall bring with my own hands.

1176
01:20:39,406 --> 01:20:41,738
Oh, inform the harem to entertain
my magical guest.

1177
01:20:41,908 --> 01:20:45,366
To delight him continuously.
Feed him sweetmeats and watermelons.

1178
01:20:45,545 --> 01:20:50,539
Feed him rahadlakum.

1179
01:20:50,817 --> 01:20:52,250
It shall be done, my lord.

1180
01:20:54,288 --> 01:20:57,189
- Rahadlakum?
- An ecstasy of taste.

1181
01:20:57,357 --> 01:20:59,382
A delight that will steal your brain away.

1182
01:20:59,559 --> 01:21:04,292
Well, some other time, perhaps.
Without my brains, I am defenseless.

1183
01:21:10,837 --> 01:21:12,498
LALUME: What's wrong?
- Ahem.

1184
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:14,297
You are hostile.

1185
01:21:14,474 --> 01:21:16,465
Great Lady, I have but one goal.

1186
01:21:16,643 --> 01:21:18,338
To take my coronet of office...

1187
01:21:18,512 --> 01:21:22,539
...collect my grant from the Caliph's
treasury and live in well-fed obscurity.

1188
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:24,115
I want you to remain here.

1189
01:21:24,284 --> 01:21:26,309
In what capacity?

1190
01:21:26,486 --> 01:21:28,386
Your fullest.

1191
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:37,560
- Lalume.
- Hmm?

1192
01:21:37,731 --> 01:21:41,223
You have saved my life and befriended me.
And I'm grateful.

1193
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:44,165
But you know me as I know you.

1194
01:21:44,338 --> 01:21:47,273
We are practical people
who live by real values in Allah's name.

1195
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:50,706
- Let's not try to fool each other.
- I'm not trying to fool you.

1196
01:21:50,877 --> 01:21:53,471
- Not at all.
- But I have a daughter. I can't desert her.

1197
01:21:53,647 --> 01:21:56,707
Your daughter would be as safe here
as you.

1198
01:21:56,883 --> 01:21:59,249
- Safer.
- Yet, I'm no magician.

1199
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:03,014
How long do you think I could live
under the Wazir's roof before he found out?

1200
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,590
About 30 years.

1201
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:09,395
Guard.

1202
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:13,299
- The Emir Hajj commands you.
- Uh...

1203
01:22:13,633 --> 01:22:16,397
Go to the camel stables
hard by the street of the vendors.

1204
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:19,767
You'll find a young lady there
who'll answer to the name of Marsinah.

1205
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:22,909
- You fetch her to me.
- Immediately, Emir Hajj.

1206
01:22:23,076 --> 01:22:25,271
Emir Hajj.

1207
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,442
Can it really be?

1208
01:22:28,882 --> 01:22:31,646
- Come with me.
- Where?

1209
01:22:31,818 --> 01:22:34,514
- To the harem.
- Must I?

1210
01:22:34,688 --> 01:22:38,681
Pretty poet. I would like the Wazir
to believe it was his harem...

1211
01:22:38,859 --> 01:22:41,453
...that enticed you to remain here.

1212
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:43,926
It would simplify our lives.

1213
01:22:44,097 --> 01:22:45,928
I understand.

1214
01:23:01,581 --> 01:23:07,019
On days when my lord groweth restless

1215
01:23:07,187 --> 01:23:12,989
And bored with his sword and his plume

1216
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:17,824
His handmaiden hath what he needeth

1217
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:20,091
And what doth he need

1218
01:23:20,267 --> 01:23:26,263
Rahadlakum

1219
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:31,969
On nights when my lord looketh listless

1220
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:37,811
And black is the hue of his gloom

1221
01:23:37,984 --> 01:23:42,819
His handmaiden hath what he lacketh

1222
01:23:42,989 --> 01:23:45,253
And what doth he lack

1223
01:23:45,425 --> 01:23:50,385
Rahadlakum

1224
01:23:50,664 --> 01:23:53,394
'Tis sweet with the meat of the litchi nut

1225
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:56,297
Combined with the kumquat rind

1226
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:57,801
The kind of confection

1227
01:23:57,971 --> 01:24:03,773
To drive a man
Out of his Mesopotamian mind

1228
01:24:03,944 --> 01:24:09,746
And lo, if my lord feeleth faithless

1229
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:15,616
And roameth by night from his room

1230
01:24:15,789 --> 01:24:20,624
His handmaiden fanneth her fires

1231
01:24:20,794 --> 01:24:26,426
And out of her pan
Riseth a tantalizing perfume

1232
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:32,596
He scenteth the scent
He turneth his face

1233
01:24:32,772 --> 01:24:38,404
His previous place in her embrace
He doth resume

1234
01:24:38,578 --> 01:24:45,074
And love is in bloom
The while they consume

1235
01:24:45,352 --> 01:24:51,916
- Rahad
- Rahad

1236
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:58,827
BOTH:
Rahadlakum

1237
01:25:17,617 --> 01:25:19,642
Oh, gracious emir...

1238
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:21,818
...everyone marvels at your wizardry.

1239
01:25:21,988 --> 01:25:24,456
May an humble servant
plead the benefit of your magic?

1240
01:25:24,624 --> 01:25:25,716
He may.

1241
01:25:25,892 --> 01:25:29,487
My third wife is soon to spawn a child.
I now have seven daughters.

1242
01:25:29,663 --> 01:25:32,860
Will the gracious emir this time
grant me a boy?

1243
01:25:33,033 --> 01:25:36,469
My good man,
this assurance I can give you.

1244
01:25:36,636 --> 01:25:39,537
If it is not a boy,
it will not be my fault.

1245
01:25:39,706 --> 01:25:41,537
Thank you.

1246
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:43,005
Thank you.

1247
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:47,068
You know,
I wouldn't be surprised if he did have a boy.

1248
01:25:47,247 --> 01:25:51,274
After all, didn't the Caliph's commoner
disappear as I guaranteed?

1249
01:25:51,451 --> 01:25:53,851
Did not Jawan find his son?

1250
01:25:55,455 --> 01:25:59,687
Could it possibly be
that I actually do possess the power?

1251
01:26:01,361 --> 01:26:04,819
Ahem. Allah, this is me again.

1252
01:26:04,998 --> 01:26:06,363
Restore my missing tooth.

1253
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,807
No magician.

1254
01:26:15,408 --> 01:26:17,933
Just an ordinary man.

1255
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:19,510
Far from ordinary.

1256
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:25,640
WAZIR:
Lalume.

1257
01:26:29,756 --> 01:26:32,384
WAZIR:
Lalume, why don't you answer?

1258
01:26:32,559 --> 01:26:33,890
Where's Hajj?

1259
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:37,086
Oh, bother, he's disappeared again.

1260
01:26:37,263 --> 01:26:38,696
- Ah.
- Gah!

1261
01:26:38,865 --> 01:26:40,355
My coronet.

1262
01:26:40,533 --> 01:26:42,000
Where were you this time?

1263
01:26:42,168 --> 01:26:43,760
That would be hard to explain
to a layman.

1264
01:26:46,673 --> 01:26:49,141
Your Emirship.

1265
01:26:49,309 --> 01:26:51,743
Your Emirship.

1266
01:26:51,911 --> 01:26:53,776
I thank you.

1267
01:26:55,181 --> 01:26:59,015
- How do I look?
- Ooh, heh-heh. Magnificent.

1268
01:27:03,423 --> 01:27:06,688
Does he give you
a kind of creepy feeling?

1269
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:10,091
Do you mean a sort of
tingly sensation under the skin?

1270
01:27:10,263 --> 01:27:12,288
- Yeah.
- He certainly does.

1271
01:27:15,635 --> 01:27:17,830
Perhaps now you'll remain here
as our guest.

1272
01:27:18,004 --> 01:27:20,939
Magician though I may be,
I am unable to tear myself away.

1273
01:27:21,107 --> 01:27:24,235
All Persia, all Arabia, all Mesopotamia...

1274
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:25,400
SUBALTERN:
Great Wazir?

1275
01:27:25,578 --> 01:27:26,636
Yes.

1276
01:27:26,813 --> 01:27:29,213
- Great Wazir, a summons from the Caliph.
- Hmm.

1277
01:27:29,382 --> 01:27:31,077
Call my litter.

1278
01:27:31,451 --> 01:27:33,919
Enjoy yourself, friend. I shart be long.

1279
01:27:40,126 --> 01:27:44,187
Now, let's see, where were we?

1280
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:46,628
About here, I think.

1281
01:27:48,935 --> 01:27:51,495
Oh, I'm being foolish. Not now, not here.

1282
01:27:51,671 --> 01:27:53,536
But when, Lalume? And where, Lalume?

1283
01:27:53,707 --> 01:27:57,143
And in heavers name,
how soon can we be there, Lalume?

1284
01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:01,406
I have heard of an oasis in the desert,
about a week's journey by dromedary.

1285
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:04,573
- Not that I've ever been there.
- Of course not.

1286
01:28:04,751 --> 01:28:07,447
It is called
the Oasis of Delightful Imaginings.

1287
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:10,748
No one around for miles and miles.

1288
01:28:10,924 --> 01:28:14,519
The sound of palm trees
rustling in the distance.

1289
01:28:14,694 --> 01:28:18,289
Warm desert winds caressing your skin.

1290
01:28:24,738 --> 01:28:26,763
Glorious emir.

1291
01:28:30,243 --> 01:28:33,735
- Yes.
- The lady has been brought as commanded.

1292
01:28:34,047 --> 01:28:35,571
Marsinah.

1293
01:28:42,622 --> 01:28:44,283
Marsinah.

1294
01:28:44,991 --> 01:28:47,858
- Oh, Father, you're safe.
- Yes, of course.

1295
01:28:48,027 --> 01:28:51,258
I was so worried about you,
with you here in that butcher's clutches.

1296
01:28:51,431 --> 01:28:54,229
Eh-eh-eh... Marsinah,
may I present the butcher's wife?

1297
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,129
My daughter, Marsinah.

1298
01:28:56,469 --> 01:28:58,664
- Forgive me, great lady.
- Uh...

1299
01:28:58,972 --> 01:29:01,634
Notice anything, Marsinah? Ahem.

1300
01:29:01,808 --> 01:29:04,936
- An emir. You really are.
- Yes.

1301
01:29:05,111 --> 01:29:07,875
She must have gowns and silks
befitting her station.

1302
01:29:08,047 --> 01:29:11,278
My dressmaker will prepare a selection
for your choice.

1303
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:12,918
Thank you.

1304
01:29:13,086 --> 01:29:16,249
- Father, can we leave this place now?
- Hmm?

1305
01:29:16,422 --> 01:29:19,357
I didn't want to ask
while she was still here, but please.

1306
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:22,222
You have your emirship.
Isn't that enough?

1307
01:29:22,395 --> 01:29:24,955
Please, let us leave
and buy our pretty house.

1308
01:29:25,131 --> 01:29:28,225
But you prefer a house to a palace?

1309
01:29:28,468 --> 01:29:30,129
Father.

1310
01:29:31,971 --> 01:29:33,529
Father.

1311
01:29:33,773 --> 01:29:37,300
I tried to tell you before.

1312
01:29:38,044 --> 01:29:40,069
- I have fallen in love.
- Oh.

1313
01:29:40,246 --> 01:29:42,612
It was there that I met him.
Maybe he'll come back.

1314
01:29:42,782 --> 01:29:45,410
At a time like this,
you talk of infantile infatuation.

1315
01:29:45,585 --> 01:29:47,746
It's love, Father.

1316
01:29:54,194 --> 01:30:00,326
It is real and deep
as the one I feel for you.

1317
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,427
Marsinah.

1318
01:30:07,073 --> 01:30:08,665
Please forgive me. L...

1319
01:30:08,842 --> 01:30:10,867
I didn't realize.

1320
01:30:12,645 --> 01:30:15,409
I'll never find him again.

1321
01:30:16,216 --> 01:30:18,912
There's no way. L...

1322
01:30:19,085 --> 01:30:21,019
- I don't even know his name.
- Darling.

1323
01:30:21,187 --> 01:30:24,884
- Where he lives, nothing.
- Darling, please. Please don't cry.

1324
01:30:25,058 --> 01:30:26,855
We'll find him.

1325
01:30:27,794 --> 01:30:29,489
Now, what's he like, huh?

1326
01:30:29,662 --> 01:30:30,890
Can you describe him?

1327
01:30:33,499 --> 01:30:35,899
Wazir, all your men, your entire force...

1328
01:30:36,069 --> 01:30:40,472
...is to be set upon the task
of finding a certain young woman.

1329
01:30:43,176 --> 01:30:46,839
Your Caliph has already described her
to his councilors who will assist you.

1330
01:30:47,013 --> 01:30:49,777
Start the search immediately.

1331
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:54,983
Immediately, highness.

1332
01:31:01,828 --> 01:31:03,921
A gardener? Hmm.

1333
01:31:04,931 --> 01:31:09,527
Well, tell me a little more about him.
Is he a tall gardener?

1334
01:31:10,069 --> 01:31:11,400
Short gardener?

1335
01:31:11,571 --> 01:31:13,232
I don't know anything else.

1336
01:31:13,406 --> 01:31:15,772
Well, now, come, let's have some facts.

1337
01:31:15,942 --> 01:31:18,342
Were his eyes gray?

1338
01:31:18,511 --> 01:31:19,808
Brown?

1339
01:31:19,979 --> 01:31:21,970
His eyes were...

1340
01:31:22,315 --> 01:31:25,443
Oh, Father,
we talked only for a few moments.

1341
01:31:25,618 --> 01:31:27,813
He touched my hand.

1342
01:31:28,288 --> 01:31:30,654
You'd say his eyes were

1343
01:31:30,823 --> 01:31:32,848
Sometime bright

1344
01:31:33,026 --> 01:31:35,290
But only sometime

1345
01:31:35,461 --> 01:31:37,554
Often dark

1346
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:39,595
Well, that is plain

1347
01:31:39,766 --> 01:31:44,669
Plain words can't tell the thrill

1348
01:31:46,072 --> 01:31:50,975
Then tell it how you will

1349
01:31:51,144 --> 01:31:58,141
Dawrs promising skies

1350
01:31:58,484 --> 01:32:05,481
Petals on a pool drifting

1351
01:32:05,992 --> 01:32:09,519
Imagine these

1352
01:32:09,696 --> 01:32:14,531
In one pair of eyes

1353
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:21,698
And this is my beloved

1354
01:32:23,142 --> 01:32:30,048
Strange spice from the south

1355
01:32:30,216 --> 01:32:37,213
Honey through the comb sifting

1356
01:32:37,857 --> 01:32:41,122
Imagine these

1357
01:32:41,294 --> 01:32:46,027
On one eager mouth

1358
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:53,196
And this is my beloved

1359
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:57,034
CALIPH:
And when she speaks

1360
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:59,974
And when she talks to me

1361
01:33:00,146 --> 01:33:02,944
Music

1362
01:33:03,116 --> 01:33:07,815
Mystery

1363
01:33:07,987 --> 01:33:13,687
And when she moves
And when she walks with me

1364
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:16,385
Paradise

1365
01:33:16,562 --> 01:33:22,091
Comes suddenly near

1366
01:33:22,268 --> 01:33:26,329
MARSINAH:
All that can stir

1367
01:33:26,506 --> 01:33:30,840
All that can stun

1368
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:38,007
All that's for the heart's lifting

1369
01:33:39,052 --> 01:33:42,579
Imagine these

1370
01:33:42,755 --> 01:33:47,522
In one perfect one

1371
01:33:47,693 --> 01:33:54,690
And this is my beloved

1372
01:33:57,503 --> 01:34:04,500
CALIPH AND MARSINAH:
And this is my beloved

1373
01:34:22,562 --> 01:34:25,690
Wazir, why have I had no tidings?

1374
01:34:25,865 --> 01:34:28,595
All Highest,
the search is barely under way.

1375
01:34:28,768 --> 01:34:30,759
We have so little information
to start with.

1376
01:34:30,937 --> 01:34:33,804
You mean you have nothing to report?
Nothing at all?

1377
01:34:33,973 --> 01:34:36,134
Great ruler, I need time.

1378
01:34:37,477 --> 01:34:39,035
True, Wazir, true.

1379
01:34:39,212 --> 01:34:41,703
But a royal marriage has been promised
the people.

1380
01:34:41,881 --> 01:34:43,906
And a royal marriage
must be given them.

1381
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:46,244
Exactly the point I was about to make.

1382
01:34:46,419 --> 01:34:48,148
You were?

1383
01:34:48,621 --> 01:34:50,316
Proceed.

1384
01:34:50,923 --> 01:34:55,758
Permit me to observe the illusion
that you can be happy with one woman...

1385
01:34:56,562 --> 01:34:58,928
...it's a phase man goes through.

1386
01:34:59,098 --> 01:35:01,225
If Your Highness would glance
into my harem...

1387
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,665
...my wives are entertaining
three ravishing young guests.

1388
01:35:04,837 --> 01:35:08,238
I am not in the mood, Wazir,
for visiting other mers harems.

1389
01:35:08,407 --> 01:35:12,070
Not a visit, highness, a glance.

1390
01:35:15,181 --> 01:35:17,445
I have secret means of watching.

1391
01:35:17,617 --> 01:35:22,384
It's a small device from which I've derived
a great deal of innocent amusement.

1392
01:35:33,266 --> 01:35:36,429
The simple creatures do not know
they're being observed.

1393
01:35:36,602 --> 01:35:39,628
They are the princesses of Ababu.

1394
01:35:39,805 --> 01:35:41,067
Note their charms.

1395
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,573
Consider that an alliance with them
would mean a safe northern frontier.

1396
01:35:44,744 --> 01:35:47,679
I do not require your advice
on military security.

1397
01:35:47,847 --> 01:35:52,648
But if you would look again, highness,
it is not military security I'm offering.

1398
01:36:02,895 --> 01:36:04,522
It is she.

1399
01:36:04,897 --> 01:36:06,489
It is.

1400
01:36:07,099 --> 01:36:08,327
Here in your harem.

1401
01:36:12,138 --> 01:36:15,972
My boy. My poor boy.

1402
01:36:20,246 --> 01:36:23,943
But this is impossible. Impossible.

1403
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,544
Your Highness...

1404
01:36:29,722 --> 01:36:32,384
...one marries so many people.

1405
01:36:32,558 --> 01:36:34,856
Of course, she cannot now
become your wife.

1406
01:36:35,027 --> 01:36:38,155
But if you'd care to have her as
a concubine, with my compliments.

1407
01:36:38,331 --> 01:36:40,094
Concubine?

1408
01:36:40,533 --> 01:36:41,966
No, Wazir.

1409
01:36:42,134 --> 01:36:44,898
It was not a concubine I sought.

1410
01:36:45,404 --> 01:36:46,735
But I don't understand.

1411
01:36:46,906 --> 01:36:51,309
A harem wife to the Wazir of police
walking alone in the bazaar?

1412
01:36:51,477 --> 01:36:52,739
How is it possible?

1413
01:36:52,912 --> 01:36:55,278
She must have bribed the guard.

1414
01:36:56,215 --> 01:36:58,945
You. Get me the facts.

1415
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:01,086
Yes, Excellency.

1416
01:37:02,688 --> 01:37:06,522
I pray Your Highness does not
blame me for his disappointment.

1417
01:37:06,692 --> 01:37:09,183
The incident is closed.

1418
01:37:11,731 --> 01:37:14,825
I shall hold a diwan this very night.

1419
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:18,300
You may present your three princesses
of wherever it is.

1420
01:37:18,471 --> 01:37:20,598
Inform marriage missions
from other nations...

1421
01:37:20,773 --> 01:37:23,640
...to present their candidates
for the Caliph's hand.

1422
01:37:23,809 --> 01:37:28,269
This night will he choose
a wife of wives.

1423
01:37:40,293 --> 01:37:42,022
Well, where'd she come from?

1424
01:37:42,194 --> 01:37:44,424
The new emir brought her.

1425
01:37:44,597 --> 01:37:47,191
Oh, my brilliant magician.

1426
01:37:47,366 --> 01:37:49,926
He transferred the woman
to my own harem.

1427
01:37:50,102 --> 01:37:53,469
His power is unbounded
and therefore so is mine.

1428
01:37:55,241 --> 01:37:57,038
Bring me the girl.

1429
01:38:06,252 --> 01:38:07,947
Put her over there.

1430
01:38:08,254 --> 01:38:11,087
The Caliph believes this woman
to be one of my wives.

1431
01:38:11,257 --> 01:38:14,021
I would not have him discover me
in a lie.

1432
01:38:15,227 --> 01:38:21,029
Ah. Witness this ceremony and enter it
into the records as of a month ago.

1433
01:38:21,634 --> 01:38:24,432
Empowered as judge of Baghdad
to create and cause marriage...

1434
01:38:24,603 --> 01:38:26,093
...between two true believers...

1435
01:38:26,272 --> 01:38:30,504
...I officially accept this creature as wife
of the 7th rank. Therefore, be she mine.

1436
01:38:31,977 --> 01:38:32,966
Huh?

1437
01:38:33,145 --> 01:38:34,612
Congratulations.

1438
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:37,806
- What is your name, woman?
- Marsinah.

1439
01:38:38,417 --> 01:38:39,441
What has happened?

1440
01:38:39,618 --> 01:38:43,748
- Marsinah, the Wazir has taken you
as a wife of the 7th rank.

1441
01:38:43,923 --> 01:38:45,891
Have her scrubbed and anointed.

1442
01:38:46,058 --> 01:38:48,856
I shall visit her
after the Caliph's diwan tonight.

1443
01:38:49,028 --> 01:38:51,428
If you do, I'll kill myself. I swear it.

1444
01:38:51,597 --> 01:38:54,794
Really? Oh, this may be
the first interesting wedding night...

1445
01:38:54,967 --> 01:38:56,901
...I've had in years. Hmm.

1446
01:39:01,607 --> 01:39:04,906
Inform the embassies to present
their candidates for royal marriage...

1447
01:39:05,077 --> 01:39:06,601
...at the diwan tonight.

1448
01:39:06,779 --> 01:39:08,713
Excellency, you dare not take that risk.

1449
01:39:08,881 --> 01:39:11,145
Suppose the All Highest
chooses the wrong bride?

1450
01:39:11,317 --> 01:39:13,285
I'm taking no risk at all.

1451
01:39:13,452 --> 01:39:16,819
My magician shall officiate
at the ceremony.

1452
01:39:42,581 --> 01:39:46,642
All Highest, the emir of whom I told you.

1453
01:39:47,753 --> 01:39:50,051
Let the diwan begin.

1454
01:39:51,056 --> 01:39:54,753
Oh, Prince of True Believers,
first of the enchanting maidens...

1455
01:39:54,927 --> 01:39:58,192
...who aspire to the incredible honor
of becoming your wife.

1456
01:39:58,364 --> 01:40:02,061
The beauteous Zubbediya of Damascus.

1457
01:40:04,503 --> 01:40:07,267
Sire, perhaps your guards
should advance a pace.

1458
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,534
CALIPH: Why so?
- Princess Zubbediya is charm incarnate.

1459
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:14,236
One cannot forget that Damascus
is a province famous only for the fact...

1460
01:40:14,413 --> 01:40:17,473
...that your great grandfather
was assassinated there.

1461
01:40:19,485 --> 01:40:23,751
O commander of the faithful,
a second contestant for your noble heart.

1462
01:40:23,923 --> 01:40:26,619
Samaris of Bangalore.

1463
01:40:30,463 --> 01:40:34,399
Alluring as the mirage,
pulsing as the sirocco.

1464
01:40:34,567 --> 01:40:37,001
And agile as the mongoose.

1465
01:40:37,169 --> 01:40:38,659
And now...

1466
01:40:38,838 --> 01:40:45,573
...now, Great Caliph,
the three princesses of Ababu.

1467
01:40:51,183 --> 01:40:53,947
O imperishable ruler,
it is said in the Koran...

1468
01:40:54,119 --> 01:40:57,714
...that he who looks out of three windows
sees more than one olive tree.

1469
01:40:57,890 --> 01:41:01,121
So devoutly do these princesses
desire your happiness...

1470
01:41:01,293 --> 01:41:04,421
...that they have put aside
the natural rivalry of womankind.

1471
01:41:04,597 --> 01:41:10,797
And each is prepared to marry
that third of you, which she can serve best.

1472
01:43:07,219 --> 01:43:09,687
Ah. The delight in your eyes
shows your decision.

1473
01:43:09,855 --> 01:43:13,018
O fount of wisdom,
all Baghdad will rejoice...

1474
01:43:13,192 --> 01:43:15,752
...and all Ababu as well.

1475
01:43:19,565 --> 01:43:22,295
Your Caliph has made no decision.

1476
01:43:33,512 --> 01:43:37,175
You have your curses ready
in case he chooses Samaris or Zubbediya?

1477
01:43:37,349 --> 01:43:38,577
As ready as ever, Great Wazir.

1478
01:43:40,686 --> 01:43:46,454
You know, I'm consumed with curiosity
as to what trick you would use.

1479
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:49,185
- Couldrt possibly give me just a hint?
- No, l...

1480
01:43:49,361 --> 01:43:52,023
All right, I understand. Forgive me.

1481
01:43:52,197 --> 01:43:54,188
- Secrets of the trade.
- Hmm.

1482
01:43:54,366 --> 01:43:56,391
Oh. Oh-ho, by the way...

1483
01:43:56,568 --> 01:43:59,230
...that was an ingenious feat
of magic you performed today.

1484
01:43:59,405 --> 01:44:00,702
Which?

1485
01:44:00,873 --> 01:44:04,104
Oh. Transferring the Caliph's beloved
to my harem.

1486
01:44:04,276 --> 01:44:05,334
What?

1487
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:09,538
- Oh, oh. Just routine wizardry.
- Wonderful. Heh-heh.

1488
01:44:09,715 --> 01:44:11,182
But you should have told me.

1489
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:14,376
I thought all was lost
when the Caliph saw her this evening. Heh.

1490
01:44:14,553 --> 01:44:17,420
I told him that she was one of my wives.

1491
01:44:17,656 --> 01:44:19,624
- A jeweled brain.
- Heh-heh.

1492
01:44:19,792 --> 01:44:22,920
And then, just to protect myself,
I married her.

1493
01:44:23,095 --> 01:44:25,063
She swore she'd kill herself.

1494
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:29,223
Angry little thing.
Can't understand what attracted the Caliph.

1495
01:44:29,401 --> 01:44:31,062
What's her name?

1496
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:33,461
Marsinah. That's it, Marsinah.

1497
01:44:33,639 --> 01:44:35,197
Marsinah.

1498
01:44:36,475 --> 01:44:39,069
- No.
- Yes, yes, Marsinah.

1499
01:44:39,244 --> 01:44:41,041
In Allah's name, what have I done?

1500
01:44:41,213 --> 01:44:44,046
Oh, that's all right.
She won't be a danger to us for long.

1501
01:44:44,216 --> 01:44:47,879
In fact, she'll cease to exist very soon
after I get down to my palace tonight.

1502
01:44:48,053 --> 01:44:49,042
Heh-heh.

1503
01:44:49,221 --> 01:44:54,557
Oh, look at him, descendant of Mohammed,
outwitted by an ordinary mortal.

1504
01:44:59,331 --> 01:45:03,825
A knife.
The trick has something to do with a knife.

1505
01:45:17,116 --> 01:45:21,917
I have written the name of Ababu upon it.
Hide it in your boot.

1506
01:45:22,087 --> 01:45:26,285
- My boot?
- Quickly or you'll spoil the trick.

1507
01:45:29,094 --> 01:45:30,322
My boot. Ha-ha.

1508
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:34,963
Mighty Caliph, behold.

1509
01:45:36,502 --> 01:45:37,526
What have you there?

1510
01:45:37,703 --> 01:45:40,331
A blade of virgin iron, All Highest.

1511
01:45:42,608 --> 01:45:44,439
As you can see...

1512
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:46,874
...nothing is written upon it.

1513
01:45:49,548 --> 01:45:52,711
My lords, ladies.

1514
01:45:53,218 --> 01:45:56,381
I throw it thus into the pool.

1515
01:45:56,655 --> 01:45:58,179
When retrieved from the water...

1516
01:45:58,357 --> 01:46:02,623
...the magic blade will be inscribed
with the name of our Caliph's bride-to-be.

1517
01:46:03,262 --> 01:46:06,595
Noble Caliph, lest you suspect fraud...

1518
01:46:06,765 --> 01:46:10,394
...your loyal Wazir himself
will retrieve it from the bottom of the pool.

1519
01:46:11,036 --> 01:46:13,402
- Who? Me?
OMAR: The Wazir?

1520
01:46:13,572 --> 01:46:15,870
Only he can serve the end I have in mind.

1521
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:18,339
Wazir, explain this fellow's arrogance.

1522
01:46:18,510 --> 01:46:21,274
He is a man of wondrous magic,
Your Highness.

1523
01:46:21,446 --> 01:46:23,004
The most potent of wizards.

1524
01:46:23,615 --> 01:46:26,379
- Proceed.
- Your indulgence, All Highest.

1525
01:46:26,552 --> 01:46:28,782
Too much light quarrels with my art.

1526
01:46:28,954 --> 01:46:32,321
May they smother all the torches
but this one?

1527
01:46:39,865 --> 01:46:44,700
This trick may take a little while.
O most tender of lords.

1528
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:46,269
Now?

1529
01:46:46,972 --> 01:46:48,371
Now.

1530
01:46:52,878 --> 01:46:56,370
All the way to the bottom,
my brilliant assistant.

1531
01:46:59,151 --> 01:47:02,518
Have no fear. I am here to help you.

1532
01:47:07,292 --> 01:47:10,318
Your foot. Give me your foot.

1533
01:47:10,495 --> 01:47:12,019
My foot?

1534
01:47:12,364 --> 01:47:14,332
Uh... Heh.

1535
01:47:19,171 --> 01:47:22,106
This feat, if you trouble to try,
will help you to understand...

1536
01:47:22,274 --> 01:47:25,141
...the infinite slowness of eye
compared to the speed of hand.

1537
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:27,005
He seems to be struggling.

1538
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:31,616
If I didn't know that he was a magician,
I'd swear the man was drowning.

1539
01:47:31,783 --> 01:47:35,480
Yes, he struggles well, doesn't he?
All part of the illusion, of course.

1540
01:47:35,654 --> 01:47:39,750
Let me assure you,
he is doing exactly what I wish him to do.

1541
01:47:40,292 --> 01:47:42,226
Gentle ruler, be not angry when I say...

1542
01:47:42,394 --> 01:47:44,828
...your subjects have been told
your heart is broken.

1543
01:47:44,997 --> 01:47:46,294
Perhaps your heart has died.

1544
01:47:46,465 --> 01:47:49,798
What judgment would you pass if your love
were lost because a lie spoken?

1545
01:47:49,968 --> 01:47:53,460
- What judgment upon the man who lied?
- Why do you ask? Whom do you accuse?

1546
01:47:53,639 --> 01:47:58,167
A lover of torture, a drinker of tears,
who laughs aloud when the innocent weep.

1547
01:47:58,343 --> 01:48:01,141
And to all beseechments
turns stone-deaf ears.

1548
01:48:01,313 --> 01:48:03,110
Who is this man? Name me his name?

1549
01:48:03,282 --> 01:48:05,944
A bargain, great Caliph.
Name me his sentence first.

1550
01:48:06,118 --> 01:48:08,313
His death,
without delay and without mercy.

1551
01:48:08,487 --> 01:48:11,456
I thank you for your verdict.
It has been carried out.

1552
01:48:14,326 --> 01:48:16,794
CALIPH:
The Wazir. Rescue the Wazir.

1553
01:48:16,962 --> 01:48:20,227
Guards. After the assassin.
Don't let him escape.

1554
01:48:20,499 --> 01:48:22,023
CALIPH:
Has my physician been summoned?

1555
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,326
PHYSICIAN:
Here, All Highest.

1556
01:48:23,502 --> 01:48:24,628
GUARD 1:
Come back.

1557
01:48:28,473 --> 01:48:29,940
- Where's the assassin?
- This way.

1558
01:48:30,108 --> 01:48:31,302
Find the traitor.

1559
01:48:31,476 --> 01:48:34,843
PHYSICIAN:
Here we are. Let's go.

1560
01:48:35,647 --> 01:48:37,842
MAN 1: Does he live?
MAN 2: His heart is quite still.

1561
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:39,506
PHYSICIAN:
Hold.

1562
01:48:39,818 --> 01:48:42,480
I hear a beat. He lives.

1563
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,671
- Father.
- Marsinah.

1564
01:49:06,845 --> 01:49:08,540
POET:
It's all right.

1565
01:49:09,481 --> 01:49:10,971
You are safe now.

1566
01:49:11,149 --> 01:49:13,447
Everything's gonna be all right.

1567
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:18,912
You attempted murder before the very eyes
of the protector of the faithful.

1568
01:49:19,091 --> 01:49:20,524
You have defiled his presence.

1569
01:49:20,692 --> 01:49:22,455
- Noble Caliph, l...
- Silence.

1570
01:49:22,627 --> 01:49:25,653
For a crime such as yours,
there is no defense to be spoken.

1571
01:49:25,831 --> 01:49:27,765
No defense to be spoken, All Highest.

1572
01:49:27,933 --> 01:49:31,528
But a living defense.
A breathing one, my daughter.

1573
01:49:38,276 --> 01:49:40,642
Then the magiciars story was true.

1574
01:49:40,812 --> 01:49:43,042
Entirely true, sire.

1575
01:49:45,017 --> 01:49:49,147
She was not the Wazir's wife, All Highest.
Not until after you left there.

1576
01:49:49,321 --> 01:49:51,289
Then she was seized
and married by force.

1577
01:49:51,456 --> 01:49:54,789
Such a marriage shall have life
no longer than my Wazir.

1578
01:50:00,565 --> 01:50:02,795
- The gardener.
- Not the gardener, my dearest.

1579
01:50:02,968 --> 01:50:05,630
- The Caliph.
- Marsinah?

1580
01:50:05,804 --> 01:50:07,704
Your name is Marsinah?

1581
01:50:07,873 --> 01:50:10,034
Only Marsinah.

1582
01:50:10,675 --> 01:50:12,836
I am no more than what I seemed.

1583
01:50:13,011 --> 01:50:18,472
And I am no less than I seemed,
no less in love, no less humorless.

1584
01:50:18,650 --> 01:50:20,277
Is this man be pardoned, O Caliph?

1585
01:50:20,452 --> 01:50:24,889
Pardon him, All Highest.
His crime was a service. Let him go free.

1586
01:50:25,057 --> 01:50:27,821
No. Don't ask that.
Under the circumstances...

1587
01:50:27,993 --> 01:50:31,053
...it would embarrass the All Highest
to pardon his father-in-law.

1588
01:50:31,229 --> 01:50:35,222
Oh, prince of justice, let me help you
to compose this most difficult of verdicts...

1589
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,868
...against a man who in his life
never once did right.

1590
01:50:38,036 --> 01:50:39,833
And never once wronged anyone.

1591
01:50:40,005 --> 01:50:42,906
Condemn the scoundrel
to some dreadful oasis.

1592
01:50:43,075 --> 01:50:45,168
At least a week's camel journey away.

1593
01:50:45,343 --> 01:50:49,006
Force him to take with him
the widow of the soon-to-be-late Wazir.

1594
01:50:49,181 --> 01:50:50,910
And all the property she can get...

1595
01:50:51,083 --> 01:50:52,448
...before the accounts are audited.

1596
01:50:52,617 --> 01:50:55,085
Condemn him to lighten her sorrow...

1597
01:50:55,253 --> 01:50:56,845
...and to toil ceaselessly...

1598
01:50:57,022 --> 01:50:59,718
...to remove all grief from her heart.

1599
01:50:59,891 --> 01:51:03,588
You have just condemned yourself for life,
my lord.

1600
01:51:04,563 --> 01:51:06,724
And finally,
O prince of true believers...

1601
01:51:06,898 --> 01:51:10,891
...take from me my greatest treasure,
my daughter, Marsinah.

1602
01:51:11,069 --> 01:51:15,438
Take her away forever,
by marrying her to the end of her days.

1603
01:51:16,942 --> 01:51:19,206
Such is the Caliph's pleasure.

1604
01:51:20,912 --> 01:51:23,107
And so he orders.

1605
01:51:24,483 --> 01:51:30,547
Princes come, princes go

1606
01:51:30,722 --> 01:51:37,059
An hour of pomp and show they know

1607
01:51:37,229 --> 01:51:43,259
Princes come and over the sands

1608
01:51:43,435 --> 01:51:48,304
And over the sands of time

1609
01:51:48,473 --> 01:51:52,034
They go

1610
01:51:55,013 --> 01:52:01,043
Wise men come ever promising

1611
01:52:01,219 --> 01:52:05,212
The riddle of life to know

1612
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:08,257
Wise men come

1613
01:52:08,426 --> 01:52:12,385
Ah, but over the sands

1614
01:52:12,564 --> 01:52:18,161
The silent sands of time

1615
01:52:18,336 --> 01:52:25,333
They go

1616
01:52:26,144 --> 01:52:32,947
Lovers come, lovers go

1617
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:37,919
And all that there is to know

1618
01:52:38,089 --> 01:52:41,422
Lovers know

1619
01:52:41,593 --> 01:52:48,590
Only lovers know
