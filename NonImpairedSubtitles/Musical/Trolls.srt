1
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:51,396
Once upon a time,

2
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:54,707
in a happy forest, in the happiest tree,

3
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:58,024
They lived the happiest creatures the world has ever seen.

4
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,224
Trolls.

5
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:05,177
Nothing they liked to sing and dance and embrace.

6
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:08,890
Dance and hug and sing and dance and sing and hug ...

7
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:11,657
and embrace and dance and sing and hug and sing and ...

8
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:16,800
But one day the Trolls discovered ...

9
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:18,401
¡Un berteno!

10
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,595
The bertenos not know sing ...

11
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:23,233
or dance ...

12
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,633
or embrace.

13
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,157
They were the most embittered creatures all over the place.

14
00:01:29,016 --> 00:01:31,504
And when they saw how happy they were trolls ...

15
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:34,182
They wanted to have some of that happiness.

16
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:38,812
Ow mom!

17
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:43,965
Eating trolls made them so happy they began a tradition.

18
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,422
Once a year, every year ...

19
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:51,088
the berbenos gathered around the tree to test Troll happiness ...

20
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,970
in a holiday they called ...

21
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,712
the Trolsticio.

22
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:15,169
Good morning, Daddy!

23
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,370
Daddy, wake up!

24
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:19,332
Daddy, wake up! Awake! Wake up, Dad!

25
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,258
Wake up, Daddy.

26
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:25,069
¡Papi! ¡Papi! ¡Papi! ¡Papi!

27
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,270
Awake!

28
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:29,217
Grisel! What time is it?

29
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,891
It's the Trolsticio!

30
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:37,149
The Trolsticio! Our only day to be happy!

31
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:38,449
Yes!

32
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,908
¡Trolls! ¡Trolls! ¡Trolls!

33
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:44,461
¡Trolls! ¡Trolls! ¡Trolls!

34
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:52,524
Loud applause for Cuidadora Trolls ...

35
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:54,712
his Minister of Happiness ...

36
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:56,299
his Chef Real ...

37
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:58,112
I.

38
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:09,353
It is a very special Trolsticio ...

39
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:12,992
as there one of us who has ever tasted a troll.

40
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,592
It's me! He's talking about me!

41
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:16,892
Príncipe Grisel...

42
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,552
the time has wounded.

43
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:20,873
Quiet, son.

44
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,180
I was also nervous the first time.

45
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
Very good.

46
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,478
It's my boy.

47
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:33,246
It is my sacred duty to get started ...

48
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,098
in the art of true happiness.

49
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:43,464
I selected a troll extra special just for you.

50
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:47,855
Happiest troll, more optimistic ...

51
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:49,704
and sweetest of all.

52
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,678
And since every prince deserves a princess ...

53
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:56,945
I give they call "Princess Poppy".

54
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:59,590
Please make me happy, Princess Poppy.

55
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:01,939
What do you feel?

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,808
He's rotten!

57
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:08,951
It's false?

58
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:09,851
False?

59
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:10,952
False?

60
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,487
They left?

61
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,287
Where are they?

62
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:18,681
Neglect, Highness. We find them.

63
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,306
I think I heard something!

64
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:25,079
Run! Run!

65
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:27,482
- We have to Poppy! - Pásamela!

66
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:29,309
- Here comes Poppy! - Here it is!

67
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:31,677
There's my princess!

68
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:32,878
¡Papi!

69
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,698
Pepe Rey, some can not keep pace.

70
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,191
The book no slouch troll!

71
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you, king, Pepe!

72
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,600
- Thank you, King Pepe! - Thank you!

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,902
Thank you, King Pepe.

74
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:50,642
No troll Left Behind!

75
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:54,867
Daddy, where are they?

76
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:58,262
They do not just stand there! Hagan happy my son!

77
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:00,324
We'll do very happy!

78
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:23,162
Where is?

79
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:30,219
I think the King Pepe could not leave.

80
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:37,635
When I say "no slouch troll" ...

81
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:43,720
It means: No slouch troll!

82
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:49,159
King Pepe, where the princess is Poppy?

83
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:51,366
Neglected. You are safe.

84
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:53,931
The book no slouch troll!

85
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:57,899
But we will be better to stay away from Pueblo Berteno.

86
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,827
Go, go. Quick!

87
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,112
But, Daddy ...

88
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:06,967
I could never eat a troll.

89
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:10,678
What will make me happy now?

90
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:15,342
Come here, son.

91
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:18,836
Nothing.

92
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,032
Absolutely nothing.

93
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:26,480
You Never, never never never are happy.

94
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:28,377
Never?

95
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:30,308
Never.

96
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:45,138
Here! just here!

97
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:49,480
Here we will build our civilization.

98
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:53,393
It has everything we need.

99
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:56,088
Fresh air, clear water ...

100
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,970
and acoustics better.

101
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:06,371
Subtitled by Antillan0

102
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:08,773
Recalling always

103
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,401
Dancing in September

104
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,712
Always happy in the sun

105
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:23,159
Today, twenty years ago, King Pepe put us safe ...

106
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,596
and now all the troll can live happily and in perfect ...

107
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,461
Harmony

108
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:28,362
Harmony

109
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:29,963
Harmony

110
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,340
And so we hugged each hour.

111
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:35,128
- Yeah. - I wish it was every half hour.

112
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,911
Me too, but there would be time to sing and dance, do you?

113
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:42,441
Princess Poppy, the bertenos still want to eat us?

114
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:43,543
And much!

115
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:47,078
But because they can only be happy.

116
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,113
Oh no! Yes I have good taste!

117
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,775
Is there anything else to make them happy?

118
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:55,283
Going to birthday parties?

119
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:56,684
Or you sleepovers!

120
00:07:56,886 --> 00:08:00,016
Or look at your parents while they sleep.

121
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,917
But I do not want to be eaten.

122
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,715
Calm down! No troll be eaten.

123
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:09,582
So we celebrate with the biggest party ever.

124
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,389
Everyone will be there.

125
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:13,600
All the world?

126
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,126
All the world.

127
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:24,991
Everybody Move that hair

128
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:32,632
Waving together scalps

129
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,756
If everyone comes to celebrate

130
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:43,803
I want to see you there, I'm inviting Move manes, party will

131
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:45,700

You're a WBC and you will see

136
00:08:57,843 --> 00:09:01,623
Easy as ABC That's what needs to be done

137
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,733
Everything is simple here one condition

138
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,952
Laugh and you will have life troll

139
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:09,910
My job is to help Chiquilina, you can do it

140
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,774
Your confidence gives me strength!

141
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:22,084
All right, Mr. Bear.

142
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:23,766
Say "leaves"!

143
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:28,340
Something is missing.

144
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
It was that!

145
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:36,185
Genial and more

146
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:38,327

I go!

149
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:47,773
Waving together scalps

150
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:53,629
All day sun are singing

151
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,317
Sunny day

152
00:09:55,418 --> 00:10:00,055
Everybody Move that hair

153
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:09,941
Yes!

154
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:19,601
Amazing, guys.

155
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,965
Seriously, excellent. Well done.

156
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,658
I heard a kilometer away!

157
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:26,156
All right. I feared that we projected no voice.

158
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:29,971
Poppy, if I can hear them, also bertenos.

159
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,230
I could not be.

160
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:32,765
- Here we go again. - Oh, Ramon ...

161
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,225
Always ruin everything.

162
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:36,281
By warning on bertenos.

163
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:37,381
Of course not.

164
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,420
Already come bertenos!

165
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:42,711
Already come bertenos!

166
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:45,686
Already come bertenos!

167
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:49,936
Please! We have not seen a single berteno in 20 years.

168
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:51,037
We were not going to find.

169
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:53,679
No, I will not find me, because I'll be ...

170
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,351
in my survival bunker camouflaged and fortified antibertenos.

171
00:10:57,553 --> 00:10:59,482
So you will not go to the party today?

172
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:01,361
But it will be the biggest ...!

173
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:02,262
Noisy ...

174
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:04,053
and crazy party ever!

175
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:07,330
Big? ¿Loud?

176
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:08,431
¿Alocada?

177
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:10,710
They will make bertenos find us!

178
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,766
You sure you want to invite to this party pooper to spoil your party?

179
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,540
Yes. I think we all deserve to be happy.

180
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:19,134
Being happy is not my thing.

181
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,972
Ramón, I know there happiness within you.

182
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:24,040
We will help you find it.

183
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,884
YOU ARE INVITED RAMÓN

184
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,659
Celebrating Freedom from bertenos.

185
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,255
What say you, Ramon?

186
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,199
Ow mom!

187
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,425
Nor dead would your party, because you will end well:

188
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:50,526
Dead.

189
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,789
Calm. Ramón. Calm.

190
00:11:56,154 --> 00:11:58,850
Thanks for bringing me safe brother.

191
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,052
Hello.

192
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:05,269
First of all, friend, thank you for sharing your particular point of view ...

193
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,370
again.

194
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:10,365
But for now, why do not you try to be more positive?

195
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:13,084
Be more positive combine with that vest.

196
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:14,485
It's okay.

197
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:17,241
Positively, they are going to eat them all.

198
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,128
- Time to embrace! - It's time to embrace.

199
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:23,267
Time to embrace!

200
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:25,501
- It feels good! - Synchronized Hearts.

201
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:27,605
Hold you forever

202
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:32,330
Someday, when bertenos find us ...

203
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:35,252
and the survival of all is in your hands ...

204
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:39,261
I hope the solution is singing, dancing and hugging. Only that you can do.

205
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:42,480
It is not true! Poppy also makes cuts.

206
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:45,192
I can not believe you're going to become queen one day.

207
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,042
Cast off the negative vibes. Poppy. They are toxic.

208
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:55,406
Some people do not want to be happy.

209
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,647
- I suppose. - You guess right.

210
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:04,563
Yes!

211
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,783
I love you all!

212
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:19,576
Yes!

213
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:22,172
Brilliantine!

214
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:29,050
Hurray!

215
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:46,311
Over glitter!

216
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,757
Come up the volume!

217
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:13,009
I do not hear them!

218
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,048
Trolls.

219
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,576
Attention friends.

220
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,923
I want to take this time ...

221
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:23,514
to tell you something.

222
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:24,715
¡Poppy!

223
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,112
She's my friend! The I know!

224
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:33,847
I want to take a second to applaud our king ...

225
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:35,606
my father...

226
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:38,208
who exactly twenty years ...

227
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:41,164
He saved us all from those dreaded ...

228
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:49,089
Bertenos.

229
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,239
I got them.

230
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,067
A muffin?

231
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:06,891
¡Corran!

232
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:09,043
Run! Run!

233
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:11,350
¡Poppy, auxilio!

234
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,525
¿Sr. Plush?

235
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:14,228
Has anyone seen Mr. Bear?

236
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,561
¡Grandulón!

237
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:19,545
Camouflage! Camouflage! Camouflage!

238
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,484
¡Poppy!

239
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:22,938
¡Corran!

240
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:27,121
Run, Chiquilina!

241
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,767
Ow mom!

242
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:33,191
- Poppy, help me! - Quick!

243
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:35,322
Quick! Quick! Quick!

244
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:40,154
- Cooper! - Minimize your auras!

245
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,947
- ¡Arroyín!
- ¡No! ¡Poppy!

246
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,947
- Sujétate.
- ¡Poppy!

247
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,663
- ¡No!
- ¡Arroyín!

248
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:55,262
¡Bert little! ¡Bert little bit!

249
00:15:56,016 --> 00:15:57,402
¡Bert little bit!

250
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:58,604
Dad!

251
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:20,086
Thank you for making the biggest party ...

252
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,035
noisy ...

253
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:24,159
and crazy history.

254
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:08,665
Are they going to return?

255
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,177
What are we going to do?

256
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,656
We must find a new home.

257
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,908
Quick! We must go back before the bertenos!

258
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,109
We must rescue them!

259
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:21,583
No, Poppy, we must flee. Right now, quick, let's go.

260
00:17:21,784 --> 00:17:24,060
What happened to "no slouch troll"?

261
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:27,233
I'm sorry, Poppy.

262
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:30,789
That was a long time ago. I'm not the king of before.

263
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,469
Then I'll go.

264
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:35,958
I'll save them.

265
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,477
No. Poppy. It's very dangerous.

266
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:40,504
At least I try.

267
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:42,779
No. You can not go by yourself to Pueblo Berteno.

268
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,911
It is impossible.

269
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:53,803
Celebrating Freedom from bertenos

270
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:59,224
Celebrating Freedom from bertenos

271
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:11,553
Ramón, you're invited!

272
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:13,343
Do not! Do not! Do not!

273
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,847
Ramón! Ramón! ! Ramón!

274
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:19,360
Ramon, are you there?

275
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,325
I will not go to your party!

276
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:24,221
The party is over. We just attack a berteno.

277
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:25,322
I knew it.

278
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:38,504
Ramon ...

279
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,482
I have to tell you something.

280
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:42,402
I just wanted to...

281
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:49,845
What? What could be so important that not attract bertenos?

282
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,011
- The berteno already gone! - You do not know. I could go outside.

283
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:54,012
Watching.

284
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:55,112
Waiting.

285
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:56,875
Listening.

286
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:58,626
No. Already went!

287
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:01,306
It was carried Cooper, to Chiquilina to Fosberto ...!

288
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:05,167
¡a Satín, a Seda, A Grandulón,
a Diamantino y a Arroyín!

289
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:07,700
So I have to ask ...

290
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,837
Are you coming with me to Pueblo Berteno to save them?

291
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:12,044
What? Do not.

292
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:14,421
Ramón, you can not refuse! They are your friends!

293
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,182
They are your friends.

294
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,446
I was here in my bunker where I'm safe.

295
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:21,349
How good. Andie knows more than you about bertenos ...

296
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,444
but when we need you, you hide forever?

297
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:26,876
Forever? Do not.

298
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:32,771
Actually I have only enough supplies for about ten years ...

299
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,894
eleven if I decide to store and drink my own sweat.

300
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:37,417
And I will.

301
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:39,310
They said I was crazy, right?

302
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,693
Who is crazy?

303
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,363
I. Madly prepared.

304
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,196
I am sorry. I should listen to you.

305
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:49,933
You told me not to do the party, and I did.

306
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:53,295
And it's my fault that might be taken away. And now I do not know what to do.

307
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,972
And if you try to cut to free?

308
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,312
What sarcastic, Ramon.

309
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,566
Well, thanks anyway.

310
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,858
When you want, Poppy. See you in ten years.

311
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:24,113
Hey, Ramon.

312
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,410
I want to ask something borrowed.

313
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,130
- What? - Your bunker.

314
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:31,446
- What? - Come, friends! All in!

315
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:33,075
Hello Ramon!

316
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:38,319
Do not! Do not! Do not wait, Poppy! What are you doing?

317
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,304
You say you have provisions for ten, right?

318
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:43,626
Yes, for me last ten years. To me!

319
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,670
- So, will last two weeks! - Well, I'd better hurry.

320
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,415
High! High! High! You will not last even a day out there.

321
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,414
And you will not last even a day in here.

322
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,120
Bottom, background, background!

323
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:59,345
Sarcasm returned.

324
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:01,337
I'm sorry, Ramon!

325
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:03,463
Poppy, wait.

326
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:06,148
Please be careful.

327
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:09,466
Do not worry, Dad. I will achieve it.

328
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,516
I love you, Poppy.

329
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,127
And I you, Dad.

330
00:21:20,302 --> 00:21:22,439
How quickly they grow.

331
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:24,909
Goodbye everybody! See you soon!

332
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:27,547
Good luck, Princess Poppy!

333
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:31,816
And three, two, one.

334
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:35,988
- Time to embrace! - Do not.

335
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:38,417
Hug! Hug! Hug!

336
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:39,518
No.

337
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:40,619
¡No!

338
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,872
With his friends hidden and safe ...

339
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,728
the princess Poppy set out to rescue their other friends ...

340
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:52,096
hoped would come to Pueblo Berteno unassisted.

341
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:57,358
Convinced that come to Pueblo Berteno.

342
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,200
Very sure Berteno come to Pueblo.

343
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:20,885
I think I can do

344
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:23,939
Today all depend on me

345
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:29,258
I will leave my home because I face today

346
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:34,712
The forest and all its dangers and avoid being eaten

347
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:40,148
Anyway, what could happen?

348
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:54,428
blue sky, see the sun shine There are butterflies around me

349
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:56,926
Sign of something Superfantástico

350
00:23:05,124 --> 00:23:08,070
It will be a fantastic day.

351
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:10,559
And swimmingly going to be

352
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,066
I have a bag with songs that sing

353
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,085
And whatever comes encararé

354
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,529
I will do it!

355
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,645
Surprise and fun in every corner

356
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:24,575
In arcoíris I travel.

357
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:27,284
Everything will be fine.

358
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:31,126
Hey, today I will not surrender

359
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,466
Obstacles not find

360
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,230
And although you me takedowns

361
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:37,962
I always lavantaré

362
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:40,719
Oh, I know that if something goes wrong

363
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:43,205
I'll go ahead to face

364
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:44,733
And although you me takedowns

365
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:47,621
Whenever I arise

366
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,650
I will get up

367
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:59,213
I'm just Confidently I

368
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:01,295
As long as snow and without fear

369
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:03,888
And he had not felt this emotion

370
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:06,330
It is long and

371
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:10,944
It is an amazing adventure

372
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:13,660
I travel in arcoíris

373
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,239
What if it's a huge mistake?

374
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:18,745
What if is stronger than me?

375
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:21,883
No, I do not because I know.

376
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:24,856
I seriously, seriously sen, seriously I'll be fine

377
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:28,031
Hey, today I will not surrender

378
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:30,533
Obstacles not find

379
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,230
And although you me takedowns

380
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:34,992
Whenever I arise

381
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:37,569
Oh, I know that if something goes wrong

382
00:24:37,771 --> 00:24:40,162
I keep going, I'm going to face

383
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:41,829
Although you me takedowns

384
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:44,707
Whenever I arise

385
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,684
I will get up

386
00:24:53,465 --> 00:24:54,774
I'm fine!

387
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,280
And even if you takedowns me if you knock me down

388
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,295
Whenever I arise

389
00:25:58,197 --> 00:25:59,197
Behind!

390
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:16,885
¡Ay, no! ¿Poppy?

391
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:19,346
Resist!

392
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,310
I levanteré

393
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:28,816
Ramón, big boy!

394
00:26:29,116 --> 00:26:30,158
You're just in time.

395
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,853
Vedría did not know.

396
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:35,678
Yes, I figured that the third embrace, be berteno food would not be so bad.

397
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:38,643
And I figured I could never do this alone.

398
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:40,042
Both are right.

399
00:26:40,837 --> 00:26:42,343
Ahead! Let's move on!

400
00:26:42,444 --> 00:26:45,865
Soon we rescue everyone in Berteno Pueblo and go home.

401
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:48,056
High, high, high. What is your plan?

402
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:50,094
I already told you. Rescue all and go home.

403
00:26:50,494 --> 00:26:53,042
That's not a plan is a desire.

404
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:55,039
I guess if you have a plan.

405
00:26:56,308 --> 00:27:00,775
First, we reach the limit of Berteno Village without being seen.

406
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:06,151
We will infiltrate through the tunnels leading to exhaust its Tree Troll ...

407
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:08,920
we will discover and suffer a terrible death ...

408
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:11,511
in the hands of a horrific and callous berteno.

409
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,764
A second, do you make cuts my plan?

410
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,926
Yes, almost...

411
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:17,353
Ready!

412
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,772
We did it!

413
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,070
So much for the ...

414
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:32,055
bobos cuts.

415
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:36,610
Do you have to sing?

416
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:38,382
I sing when I'm in a good mood.

417
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,101
Do you have to be in a good mood?

418
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:43,302
Why not? Tomorrow at this time I am with all my friends!

419
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:45,876
I wonder what they're doing now.

420
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:47,860
Insurance digesting.

421
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:49,687
Ramon are alive. I'm sure!

422
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,156
You're not sure of anything.

423
00:27:51,257 --> 00:27:52,772
And I'm dying to see your face ...

424
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:56,086
when you realize that not all cupcakes and rainbows.

425
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:57,287
It is not like this.

426
00:27:57,388 --> 00:28:00,630
Bad things happen, and you can not do anything about it.

427
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,926
I know that not all cupcakes and rainbows.

428
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:07,849
But I prefer to keep thinking so much ...

429
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,114
instead of being like you.

430
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:10,855
You do not dance or sing.

431
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,361
You're gray all the time! What happened?

432
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:16,904
¿Un berteno?

433
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,241
Maybe.

434
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:23,955
No berteno, right?

435
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:26,039
You said to stop talking.

436
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:27,915
Maybe.

437
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:53,025
So special ...

438
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:55,903
Good night, Cooper.

439
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:59,114
Good night, Chiquilina. Good night, Fosberto.

440
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,492
Good night, Satine. Goodnight, Silk.

441
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,245
Good night, big guy. Good night, DG.

442
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,496
Diamantino good night.

443
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,041
Good night Arroyín.

444
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,125
And good night, Poppy.

445
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:21,971
Do not even think about it.

446
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:37,153
I see stars shining

447
00:29:37,237 --> 00:29:39,072
Really? Another time singing?

448
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,032
Yes really! Singing helps me relax.

449
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,326
You should try it.

450
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:45,870
I do not sing and did not relax me.

451
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:48,122
So I am, and I do not like.

452
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:50,124
I also like the silence.

453
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:03,513
Hello, friend darkness

454
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:06,725
I come to speak with you

455
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,017
Hi.

456
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,690
Well, there was a vision that I felt

457
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:17,361
It was planted in me when I fell asleep

458
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:19,939
And that vision

459
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,436
Which in my mind was planted

460
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:27,288
He stayed

461
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:32,584
surrounded by the

462
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:35,171
Silence

463
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,177
May l?

464
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:56,858
One of these tunnels leads to the Tree Troll?

465
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,319
- So is. - Too.

466
00:30:59,611 --> 00:31:00,946
I wonder what.

467
00:31:01,156 --> 00:31:02,490
I do not know.

468
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:05,827
Choose wisely!

469
00:31:06,034 --> 00:31:08,830
Because one leads to Pueblo Berteno ...

470
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:12,540
and others, to certain death.

471
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:13,667
Who said that?

472
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:16,003
Went...

473
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:18,045
I.

474
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:20,965
Hey, guys, how are you? Welcome to the root tunnels.

475
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:22,467
I just wanted to warn you.

476
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:24,762
One of these tunnels leads to the Tree Troll ...

477
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:30,267
and the other to a new, safe, safe, safe, safe ...

478
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:32,602
Could you tell us what is right?

479
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:33,520
Of course.

480
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:35,772
- Great! - It is not necessary. Thank you.

481
00:31:35,855 --> 00:31:36,649
Ramón.

482
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:38,024
Try help.

483
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:39,818
I do not like the facha you have.

484
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:42,362
Who wear socks without shoes?

485
00:31:43,863 --> 00:31:45,867
It seems to know what he is talking about.

486
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:47,785
It's okay!

487
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:50,205
What should we take?

488
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:53,207
First, you chócalas me and then tell you.

489
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,376
- What? - I love that! I do it.

490
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,627
I know you would.

491
00:31:57,502 --> 00:31:58,795
But what about him?

492
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,798
Come on curmudgeon, chócalas!

493
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,216
No, I do not choco anything.

494
00:32:02,425 --> 00:32:03,926
- Give me five, man. - Do not even dream about it.

495
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:05,595
- Feast of "Penthouse" - No.

496
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:07,722
- A pat? ¿Chiquita? - You're weird.

497
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:09,891
Please! Just give me five.

498
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:11,809
No thanks. So I'm fine.

499
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:13,477
Just do this.

500
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:14,688
But with your hand.

501
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:16,313
Thank you for the demonstration.

502
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:18,441
It was very clear that I will not do.

503
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,401
Ramón, only chócalas!

504
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,570
The other leads to certain death. Sopésalo!

505
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:30,245
A chócalas not tell which tunnel and take, right?

506
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:31,662
That easy.

507
00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:33,456
Well, all right!

508
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:36,460
- How slow. - "What I slow"?

509
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,420
It is a classic.

510
00:32:39,754 --> 00:32:41,256
No no. It's okay.

511
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:43,548
I will let you exchange it for a fist bump.

512
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,092
Shark!

513
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:46,219
Squid!

514
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:49,387
Sandwitch! Turkey! Snow monkey! Dolphin! Ape at the zoo!

515
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:51,098
- What? - Speed ​​change!

516
00:32:59,857 --> 00:33:02,277
Ya, ya, ya, ya. Better give me a hug.

517
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:09,158
- Yes! You make well run, Cloud! - Wait!

518
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:12,453
I'll rip those little arms cloud cloud your body ...!

519
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:14,331
I'll do chócalas with your face!

520
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:15,832
It's just a cloud!

521
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,293
- Come back here! - Ramon! It can help!

522
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:20,128
- Came back! - Run. Cloud Type!

523
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:21,337
I am going to kill you!

524
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:23,005
Ready! It's here!

525
00:33:24,424 --> 00:33:26,468
They are very funny. I have to go.

526
00:33:26,675 --> 00:33:30,013
I have matters to attend to cloud. Do I see her return?

527
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,307
Unless...

528
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:34,517
Perish!

529
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:36,895
The Tree Troll.

530
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,563
Berteno people.

531
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:55,955
I am unhappy Contento

532
00:33:56,164 --> 00:34:00,460
In the bag I bring the sun useless

533
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:04,424
But there is an end I see the future coming

534
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:07,509
Content'm unhappy

535
00:34:07,718 --> 00:34:12,054
In the bag I bring the sun Inútil

536
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:16,058
But there is an end I see the future coming

537
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:19,355
I see it coming I see it coming

538
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:22,106
I see it coming I see it coming

539
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:24,527
I see it coming I see it coming

540
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:27,237
Wow! They are as bitter as you.

541
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:31,659
Which means that not eat any troll!

542
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,203
Quick! Let's save our friends!

543
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:36,364
- Your friends. - Our friends. Do not deny it.

544
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:47,008
Ay, Abanabus.

545
00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:50,343
You're my only friend in this whole miserable world.

546
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,389
Dad was right.

547
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:58,645
Never, never, never ever I'll be happy.

548
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,396
Never.

549
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:05,525
Never say Never.

550
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:19,081
Chad. Todd.

551
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:23,211
Chef! Where did you come from?

552
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:26,130
My father drove you 20 years ago.

553
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,423
You have been behind the plant all the time?

554
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,176
Hopefully. High King.

555
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:32,386
No. I was hiding in the woods ...

556
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:35,556
I am thinking about how I cheated.

557
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:39,853
If only I had way to make him feel better.

558
00:35:40,061 --> 00:35:41,228
That's difficult.

559
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:43,939
The only thing that could make me happy is to eat a troll.

560
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:45,775
And that will not happen, thanks to you.

561
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:49,152
But maybe yes. Thanks to me.

562
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,665
You find trolls.

563
00:36:04,293 --> 00:36:08,673
That means that maybe I can be happy!

564
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:09,882
So is.

565
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:15,263
Of course everyone else in Berteno People will still embittered ...

566
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:17,349
but that does not care.

567
00:36:17,556 --> 00:36:20,811
I am your king, so maybe interested me.

568
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,104
What do you propose, exactly?

569
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:26,650
Do what again the Trolsticio? For everyone?

570
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:30,194
Yes! That's exactly what I propose.

571
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,990
Great idea, Your Highness. Completely brilliant. He is very clever!

572
00:36:34,198 --> 00:36:35,198
I suppose.

573
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:38,619
And I, your loyal chef, I'll be right behind.

574
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,454
- With a knife. - What?

575
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:44,167
With a knife, a spoon, a ladle. After all, I'm the chef!

576
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,085
Of course you are!

577
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:51,173
I'm back!

578
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:53,385
You, dishwasher. What is your name?

579
00:36:53,468 --> 00:36:54,468
Bridget.

580
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:56,261
Congratulations, Idget. You work for me.

581
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:58,973
It takes those dishes down and begins to wash.

582
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:00,976
Yes, Chef. Thank you, Chef.

583
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:10,110
Do not cry, Mr. Bear.

584
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:13,571
Friends, Mr. Teddy is very scared!

585
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:19,619
Hear! Please, we must remain calm.

586
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:25,542
So, fine. A troll is a delicious calm troll.

587
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:29,922
And they are the key ingredient in my recipe for success.

588
00:37:30,672 --> 00:37:34,300
You see, he who controls the trolls controls the kingdom.

589
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:37,180
And I am "that"!

590
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:38,347
You are a man?

591
00:37:44,476 --> 00:37:46,940
For this time tomorrow I'll be the queen ...

592
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:50,275
and all the Berteno People have just what you deserve.

593
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:53,403
True Happiness!

594
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,207
- Chad.
- Todd.

595
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:19,764
Where do you think they are our friends?

596
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,225
If I had to guess, I'd say in the stomach of some berteno.

597
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,310
Try to be positive.

598
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,293
Just once. Maybe you like it.

599
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:29,689
All right. I'm sure they are alive ...

600
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,526
and we will be handed over on a silver platter.

601
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:35,299
Thank you. It was not so hard, right?

602
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:40,318
- Ramon! - Time to embrace? Really?

603
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Listen out!

604
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,509
It will be the best Trolsticio history!

605
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,587
What an excellent idea I had!

606
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,310
Yes. Tomorrow is the Trolsticio, friends.

607
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,275
- And must be perfect! - Yes, Chef!

608
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,548
How good it feels to give orders to all again!

609
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,040
- Ramon, look! - They are alive?

610
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:04,706
And on a silver platter. You both were right!

611
00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:07,242
To celebrate the occasion, Highness, look.

612
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:09,282
I found his old bib troll.

613
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,830
I bet I still have.

614
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:16,307
As glove!

615
00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:21,625
Is it funny?

616
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:24,568
Let's see who laughs when you bite the head.

617
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:26,702
When you bite your head at all!

618
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,566
Just a moment.

619
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:33,486
Chef, not enough to feed all heads Berteno Pueblo.

620
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,144
How will Trolsticio without sufficient trolls?

621
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:39,762
There are many more where these came out, Highness.

622
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,591
Safe? I promised everyone a troll.

623
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:44,885
No, no, Your Highness. Everything will be fine.

624
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:46,645
If you were worried ...

625
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:49,072
Would you be willing to do this?

626
00:39:49,272 --> 00:39:50,272
Arroyín!

627
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,100
My first troll!

628
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,520
Go ahead, eat, Grisel king.

629
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,930
Enjoy the taste of true happiness.

630
00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:08,925
Should not we wait to Trolsticio?

631
00:40:09,968 --> 00:40:13,123
Highness, every day is Trolsticio when you have trolls.

632
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,661
I suppose.

633
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:24,043
Dad said the first should be special.

634
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:28,340
Now you are my king.

635
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,242
Yes, I am the king.

636
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:36,288
But should share this moment with all the kingdom.

637
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,490
Do it!

638
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,604
- Ow mom! - Do not!

639
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:41,791
Yes!

640
00:40:48,235 --> 00:40:51,901
Idget! Enclose these trolls in your room and resguárdalos with your life!

641
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:55,086
Yes, Chef.

642
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:57,311
Yes, yes, I know.

643
00:40:57,511 --> 00:41:00,298
- Ramon, we must save him! - From your stomach?

644
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:02,031
Do not chew or swallow we saw!

645
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:05,922
Face it, Poppy, sometimes a person enters the mouth of another and never comes out.

646
00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:08,642
If we go after Arroyín, we eat both.

647
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,445
Sorry, it's too late for him.

648
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
¡Poppy!

649
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:50,575
Dishwasher!

650
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:56,203
Lava these pots and pans for Trolsticio!

651
00:41:56,505 --> 00:41:58,194
The king invited them all.

652
00:41:58,294 --> 00:41:59,696
Save yourself!

653
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:27,786
In complete solitude I carry you in me

654
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:33,286
Dreaming kiss you so

655
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:36,190
And be on you

656
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:43,280
Watch when you spend with fervor

657
00:42:44,904 --> 00:42:45,904
It's me

658
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:52,796
which awaits you?

659
00:42:52,996 --> 00:42:56,191
the truth is in your eyes

660
00:42:56,587 --> 00:43:00,636
Your smile is the truth

661
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:03,648
There is no one who most wanted

662
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:08,321
And I want to hug

663
00:43:08,522 --> 00:43:10,508
You always know what to say

664
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:11,859
All are inept!

665
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:15,324
Perfect your attitude

666
00:43:15,524 --> 00:43:17,130
I have to dress myself ...

667
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,818
You are why I love

668
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,696
Always you.

669
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:38,441
He's in love with the king!

670
00:43:38,642 --> 00:43:41,008
What are you talking about? The bertenos not have feelings.

671
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,402
Maybe you do not know everything about the bertenos!

672
00:43:43,603 --> 00:43:44,603
Come on!

673
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:53,822
- Boys! - Poppy!

674
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,710
Celebrating always

675
00:43:56,912 --> 00:43:59,188
together celebrating

676
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:03,165
Today there partying and going on here

677
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:05,956
Do not! Here there is no party!

678
00:44:08,718 --> 00:44:10,608
The sooner out of here ...

679
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:12,194
Before we save Arroyín!

680
00:44:12,395 --> 00:44:13,395
What?

681
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,051
It's me

682
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,091
who are looking for love?

683
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,027
I know you are looking pastries and rainbow ...

684
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,005
but face it, ate Arroyo.

685
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:27,914
- They put on a taco! - It was horrible!

686
00:44:28,016 --> 00:44:30,294
I'm sorry, Poppy. Arroyín is gone.

687
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:34,609
Poppy, how can you believe that Arroyín is alive?

688
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:36,403
I do not think he's alive.

689
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:39,138
I hope he is alive, and that is enough.

690
00:44:39,338 --> 00:44:41,674
Why do you always see the bright side?

691
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,532
Here there is no good side! Zero!

692
00:44:43,732 --> 00:44:45,007
There is always a good side!

693
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:47,262
Hear! Where do believe that they?

694
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:51,580
Brilliantine!

695
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:53,981
Do not! Get back to the box!

696
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,722
The Chef will be furious!

697
00:44:58,929 --> 00:44:59,929
¡No!

698
00:45:02,691 --> 00:45:04,275
¡Bridget, detente!

699
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:06,683
You are in love with the king Grisel.

700
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:09,865
I do not know what are you talking about.

701
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:14,911
Sorry!

702
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,799
That's not mine.

703
00:45:22,211 --> 00:45:23,527
Anyway it does not matter.

704
00:45:23,716 --> 00:45:26,052
He does not even know I'm alive.

705
00:45:26,295 --> 00:45:28,069
Bridget, I can help!

706
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:31,076
There is a way to have what we want both.

707
00:45:31,736 --> 00:45:33,381
Do you also love Grisel?

708
00:45:33,547 --> 00:45:36,461
You'd better swerve, friend!

709
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,876
No. Bridget, no.

710
00:45:41,077 --> 00:45:44,555
The troll king Grisel got to the mouth is Arroyín.

711
00:45:44,757 --> 00:45:47,288
And he would do anything to save him.

712
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,241
The only problem is ...

713
00:45:49,341 --> 00:45:52,198
we can not approach the king without eat us.

714
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:58,831
But you if you can.

715
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:02,715
You can approach him and tell him how you feel.

716
00:46:03,014 --> 00:46:04,260
Of course not.

717
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,722
I can not get anything like the king.

718
00:46:06,924 --> 00:46:10,421
His Genialeza Real never speak with a dishwasher like me.

719
00:46:11,222 --> 00:46:13,182
And if you do not know you're a dishwasher?

720
00:46:13,383 --> 00:46:15,984
And if you think you are a complete dreamboat?

721
00:46:16,286 --> 00:46:19,910
What kind of chocolate would dress as a dishwasher?

722
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,324
I smell sausage.

723
00:46:21,525 --> 00:46:24,160
- What if we make a new outfit? - It occurs to me...

724
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:25,161
¡A overol!

725
00:46:25,363 --> 00:46:28,612
What would coveralls with this hair?

726
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:29,558
That is arranged.

727
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,106
What good is a new outfit and a new hairstyle ...?

728
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:34,989
if I do not know what to say a complete dreamboat?

729
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:36,523
You'd also help you with that!

730
00:46:36,724 --> 00:46:38,511
- Seriously? - What say you, Bridget?

731
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:42,542
Help with Arroyín and get you an appointment with the king.

732
00:46:46,963 --> 00:46:49,185
- It must be done. - Five six seven,. eight!

733
00:46:49,387 --> 00:46:50,890
When you see the mirror

734
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,486
If your whole vanished insecurity

735
00:46:54,587 --> 00:46:55,587
¡Alto!

736
00:46:55,752 --> 00:46:57,106
Why is this not sing?

737
00:46:57,707 --> 00:46:59,573
Come on, Ramon! Sing with us!

738
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:01,954
Yes Ramón! Sing with us!

739
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:03,302
No, I'm fine like this.

740
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:05,039
Do not you think this will work?

741
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:07,167
No no no. Is not that. It's because I do not sing.

742
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:11,069
- Ramon! - No reason. It is a silly idea.

743
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,245
King Grisel ever love me.

744
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:16,177
Quiet. Hey hey. What is this?

745
00:47:17,413 --> 00:47:19,644
So, Bridget, pluck it out.

746
00:47:19,944 --> 00:47:22,314
Pour over Bridget. mourn It will do you good.

747
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:23,415
So, my friend!

748
00:47:25,255 --> 00:47:26,945
Well, now reverse.

749
00:47:27,046 --> 00:47:28,247
Regrésalo.

750
00:47:29,883 --> 00:47:32,055
Ramon, what are you doing? You need to sing!

751
00:47:32,255 --> 00:47:34,405
- I told you, do not sing. - You need to sing!

752
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,838
- I am sorry. I can not. - Yes you can, but do not want.

753
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:38,896
- Well, I do not. - You have to do it!

754
00:47:38,997 --> 00:47:39,897
- Do not! - Yes!

755
00:47:39,998 --> 00:47:41,573
- Do not! - Why do not you sing?

756
00:47:41,774 --> 00:47:43,710
Because sing killed my grandmother!

757
00:47:45,675 --> 00:47:46,858
Leave me alone.

758
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:53,144
Once my uncle broke his neck tap dancing.

759
00:47:57,942 --> 00:48:01,250
How to sing killed your grandmother?

760
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,111
What song to sing?

761
00:48:05,372 --> 00:48:06,709
The singing was me.

762
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:12,086
Today I need to see

763
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:15,607
I will always want to see

764
00:48:15,808 --> 00:48:19,323
That day was so absorbed singing ...

765
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:21,851
I did not hear my grandmother's warning.

766
00:48:22,053 --> 00:48:23,358
Ramón! Watch out!

767
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,847
Everything will be fine, I know

768
00:48:27,048 --> 00:48:28,449
Beware, Ramon!

769
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:39,579
Grandmother!

770
00:48:49,185 --> 00:48:52,438
Once her life was full of light

771
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:55,768
And today only see shadows

772
00:48:55,968 --> 00:48:58,276
Nothing to say

773
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:04,114
Eclipse of love for him

774
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:08,590
I have not sung since.

775
00:49:09,624 --> 00:49:13,216
I am so sorry. Ramón. I had no idea.

776
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:16,547
I assumed you had a horrible voice.

777
00:49:16,948 --> 00:49:19,444
No, no, she sang like angels.

778
00:49:21,078 --> 00:49:22,986
So said my grandmother.

779
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:32,296
Hey hey! What do you do? It is time to embrace.

780
00:49:32,498 --> 00:49:34,563
I thought you could use one.

781
00:49:42,767 --> 00:49:45,310
Agree! I'll help!

782
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:46,977
But I will not sing.

783
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:51,219
Ready, guys? Let go hair!

784
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,220
Your

785
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:57,630
you you

786
00:49:57,832 --> 00:50:02,745
You have to leave

787
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:05,732
I show

788
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:08,870
I am like

789
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:09,671
aja

790
00:50:09,771 --> 00:50:10,771
Soy

791
00:50:12,808 --> 00:50:14,361
I show

792
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:17,329
I am like

793
00:50:18,253 --> 00:50:19,316
Soy

794
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:22,581
I show

795
00:50:22,882 --> 00:50:24,824
I'll shine like the sun after rain

796
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:26,961
Going out, my fears are finished

797
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:29,149
I'm great, everything, everything I want and I want and

798
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,334
I'm I'm more

799
00:50:31,535 --> 00:50:33,621
Look at me now, high confidence

800
00:50:33,721 --> 00:50:35,689
I'm going to impact them with my plays, yes

801
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:36,691
We love

802
00:50:36,692 --> 00:50:37,592
I will not give

803
00:50:37,593 --> 00:50:39,810
You bowled the move will see the king, insurance

804
00:50:40,111 --> 00:50:41,252
It's like it

805
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:42,353
It shows

806
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:44,401
He will say at last

807
00:50:44,602 --> 00:50:50,059
- And to prove that I am as I am - It's like it

808
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:56,049
No no no! Everything is wrong!

809
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:59,959
I'll get back to Trolsticio! I need a bib combine!

810
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,861
- Yes, Your Highness! - I look like a child with this!

811
00:51:02,063 --> 00:51:05,710
- Oh, Your Highness! - I need something elegant, sophisticated ...

812
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:07,029
A man bib!

813
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,239
Oh, it's so beautiful ...!

814
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,608
You are too.

815
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,946
- You'll know I'm a dishwasher! - No no no!

816
00:51:14,146 --> 00:51:17,048
- I need to get out of here! - I'm here for you, Bridget.

817
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:18,349
We all are.

818
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:20,925
- You tell me what to say? - Of course.

819
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:22,459
Of course.

820
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:23,681
Wait till we come.

821
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:27,195
High King! I think I have the perfect bib!

822
00:51:27,395 --> 00:51:29,876
You better! The Trolsticio is tomorrow night!

823
00:51:30,077 --> 00:51:32,709
I look good, but I have to see me incredible.

824
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,810
Clear.

825
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:37,074
You got a little picture!

826
00:51:37,377 --> 00:51:40,440
Your Majesty! Look no more! It's a child very, very big!

827
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,758
I love!

828
00:51:42,472 --> 00:51:44,683
I think it is obese.

829
00:51:44,898 --> 00:51:45,898
What?

830
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,208
"That kiss! And then pose.

831
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:51,308
That I kiss.

832
00:51:52,952 --> 00:51:54,847
Smoky!

833
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:57,953
Complete honesty of a full chocolate.

834
00:52:00,165 --> 00:52:01,906
And who are you?

835
00:52:03,062 --> 00:52:04,676
Your name is...

836
00:52:05,276 --> 00:52:06,878
- Lady! - Pomade!

837
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,980
Is seriously?

838
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:10,995
My name is Lady Brillantina, it's serious.

839
00:52:11,674 --> 00:52:13,888
Well, mi Lady Brillantina.

840
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:19,296
You want to go with me to the rink and video games Captain Starfunkie?

841
00:52:19,497 --> 00:52:20,697
Yes, I want?

842
00:52:20,985 --> 00:52:21,875
I want?

843
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:23,653
Yes! You would love it.

844
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:25,375
Yes! You would love it.

845
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:27,883
Yes, I `d love to.

846
00:52:28,084 --> 00:52:30,037
When are you going to ask Arroyín?

847
00:52:30,136 --> 00:52:33,089
Before must prepare. You do not know anything about romance?

848
00:52:33,126 --> 00:52:35,183
Clear! The romance excites me!

849
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:37,820
- Seriously? - Do not you know anything about sarcasm?

850
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:40,294
I think once gave me a "sarcasm".

851
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,538
I'll take one of each, baberín.

852
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,982
We will make a mess.

853
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,317
Enjoy your pizza. Here are their chips.

854
00:52:53,034 --> 00:52:54,551
How elegant!

855
00:52:55,776 --> 00:52:57,653
Good thing I brought my appetite.

856
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:13,803
You are fantastic!

857
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:16,322
Bridge! Give back the compliment!

858
00:53:16,423 --> 00:53:17,975
You are met.

859
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:20,242
Do not! I mean you to say something nice.

860
00:53:20,443 --> 00:53:22,104
But I think it is fulfilled.

861
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,900
¡Poppy, ayúdala!

862
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:28,943
Your eyes are...

863
00:53:29,043 --> 00:53:30,043
Son...

864
00:53:30,846 --> 00:53:32,911
Your ears ...

865
00:53:33,111 --> 00:53:35,941
- Your eyes ... ... ears - nose!

866
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:36,942
- Skin! - Neck!

867
00:53:37,044 --> 00:53:38,079
Skin, neck, ears ...

868
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:39,789
- Nose, face. - You're good?

869
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,223
Your teeth

870
00:53:41,423 --> 00:53:42,524
Teeth.

871
00:53:42,724 --> 00:53:44,672
What's up? Do you're making fun of me?

872
00:53:44,874 --> 00:53:46,074
Your eyes!

873
00:53:47,074 --> 00:53:49,342
They are like two pools ...

874
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:53,798
so deep that fear that if I dive ...

875
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,626
I can never come up for air.

876
00:53:57,328 --> 00:53:59,462
I can never come up for air.

877
00:54:01,436 --> 00:54:02,948
And your smile...

878
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,076
The same sun is jealous ...

879
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:07,892
and if he refuses to leave behind the clouds ...

880
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:11,612
knowing that it can not shine even half.

881
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:14,677
Yes I have a nice smile, right?

882
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:17,446
If you have.

883
00:54:21,373 --> 00:54:23,499
I can not believe I'm saying this ...

884
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,170
Guys acting on your own!

885
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,960
But to be with you today ...

886
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:32,171
It makes me realize that true happiness is possible.

887
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:36,007
It is!

888
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:39,901
True happiness is much closer than you imagine.

889
00:54:40,995 --> 00:54:42,275
It's right here.

890
00:54:44,444 --> 00:54:45,847
I guess it's cute.

891
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:47,341
What do you think now?

892
00:54:49,045 --> 00:54:51,203
- Arroyín? - I knew I was alive!

893
00:54:51,405 --> 00:54:53,218
Mr. Teddy is alive!

894
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:54,913
What a surprise!

895
00:54:56,851 --> 00:54:58,553
Did you say something!

896
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:02,640
- I've been keeping this little guy ... - Help!

897
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,473
Piety!

898
00:55:04,573 --> 00:55:07,687
Tell me, my Lady, I'll see you at the banquet of Trolsticio?

899
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,352
Well of course. I'll be washing.

900
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:11,699
¡ "A"!

901
00:55:11,901 --> 00:55:14,388
Praising. I will praise you. You know...

902
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:16,632
alabándote.

903
00:55:16,832 --> 00:55:19,121
Yes! Of course.

904
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:21,344
Because you'll be there as my companion.

905
00:55:21,544 --> 00:55:23,665
- Seriously? - Assuming say yes.

906
00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:24,866
- Yes! - Yes!

907
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:25,966
Yes!

908
00:55:26,066 --> 00:55:28,744
Meanwhile, we should find another way ...

909
00:55:28,945 --> 00:55:30,545
whet our appetite.

910
00:55:30,746 --> 00:55:33,474
Yes? What do you have in mind?

911
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,301
Your Majesty.

912
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:30,856
Apparently, it is ...

913
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,580
having fun.

914
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:34,097
It is true!

915
00:56:34,298 --> 00:56:37,359
I introduce you to the beautiful Lady Brillantina.

916
00:56:41,336 --> 00:56:44,531
You remind me of someone.

917
00:56:47,007 --> 00:56:49,773
She will be my companion.

918
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:51,421
Oh I see.

919
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:55,654
For a moment I was afraid to think change plans.

920
00:56:58,928 --> 00:57:01,160
Not be a problem, Your Highness.

921
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,945
I will make no use of my dishwasher set another place at the table ...

922
00:57:04,946 --> 00:57:08,941
for the beautiful Lady Brillantina.

923
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:10,614
Put place next to mine.

924
00:57:10,815 --> 00:57:13,356
I want you to be by my side ...

925
00:57:13,457 --> 00:57:15,709
Hears! Lady Brillantina!

926
00:57:16,764 --> 00:57:18,225
Lady Brillantina!

927
00:57:20,046 --> 00:57:22,530
See you at the Trolsticio, right?

928
00:57:30,143 --> 00:57:32,160
I miss you already.

929
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:41,065
I think he likes us very much the king!

930
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,280
Is that right?

931
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,724
It was the best day of my life!

932
00:57:45,325 --> 00:57:46,444
Thank you, Poppy.

933
00:57:46,945 --> 00:57:48,717
Thank you all!

934
00:57:49,234 --> 00:57:50,904
Even you, I think.

935
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:54,006
I never thought it would happen something like that!

936
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:55,856
And it happened to me!

937
00:57:55,957 --> 00:57:58,255
I'm so excited I could scream.

938
00:58:01,137 --> 00:58:04,040
I could also scream! Arroyín is alive!

939
00:58:13,038 --> 00:58:14,263
Ramon, what happens?

940
00:58:14,464 --> 00:58:16,403
Nothing. I thought we were celebrating.

941
00:58:16,604 --> 00:58:17,965
Is that a cry of joy?

942
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:19,530
It is the lack of practice.

943
00:58:19,731 --> 00:58:22,892
Soon you will practice a lot. Arroyín will save ...

944
00:58:22,992 --> 00:58:25,484
and life will be cupcakes and rainbows.

945
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,485
Give me five!

946
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:27,449
What slow.

947
00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:29,341
- Yes! - I knew it!

948
00:58:29,442 --> 00:58:32,413
Well, let's save Arroyín.

949
00:58:32,514 --> 00:58:33,214
Yes!

950
00:58:33,315 --> 00:58:35,158
Do not! Do not! They can not leave.

951
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,894
Lady Brillantina accompany the king to dinner.

952
00:58:38,095 --> 00:58:41,550
Did you eat dinner in trolls? I think we will not attend.

953
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:44,498
Do not! They have to help me be Lady Brillantina.

954
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:45,699
I need them.

955
00:58:45,827 --> 00:58:48,532
You can not pretend you're someone else forever.

956
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:50,216
Can it be only tomorrow?

957
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:52,108
Bridget, we no longer need.

958
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:54,329
The king and you can be happy.

959
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:58,094
That's impossible! Just eat a troll can make you happy!

960
00:58:58,195 --> 00:58:59,530
Everyone knows it!

961
00:58:59,731 --> 00:59:02,170
I would never have gone to that silly quote!

962
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,686
Bridget...

963
00:59:05,787 --> 00:59:09,114
Then go away! Get out of my room. Leave me alone.

964
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:11,528
- Please listen. - Bridget!

965
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:13,100
- We have to go. - Bridget ...

966
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:14,852
What's going on down there?

967
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,460
Bridget, lava that dish!

968
00:59:17,661 --> 00:59:20,287
The king will bring a companion.

969
00:59:20,488 --> 00:59:21,488
Yes. Chef.

970
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,824
We did it, Barnabus.

971
00:59:32,025 --> 00:59:35,279
I have only to lose 15 kilos in the next eight hours.

972
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:54,029
There it is!

973
00:59:57,442 --> 00:59:59,282
I feel good I feel good

974
00:59:59,482 --> 01:00:01,244
I feel good I feel good

975
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:03,647
I feel good

976
01:00:05,115 --> 01:00:07,077
Arroyín, we will draw you in a second.

977
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,707
- Quick! - It's stuck!

978
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:11,785
¡Corran!

979
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:19,666
I feel love

980
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:24,994
Hear! Here!

981
01:00:26,145 --> 01:00:27,360
- All in! - Let's move on!

982
01:00:27,561 --> 01:00:28,593
- Ramon, give it to me! - Already!

983
01:00:28,794 --> 01:00:29,794
Quick!

984
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:31,695
¡Sujétense well!

985
01:00:35,337 --> 01:00:36,952
Contrólenlo, friends!

986
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:41,533
Satin! Silk! On the right!

987
01:00:41,734 --> 01:00:42,931
¡Hagámoslo!

988
01:00:47,474 --> 01:00:49,217
¡Diamantino, brillantínalo!

989
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:50,558
¡As pomade!

990
01:00:55,056 --> 01:00:56,056
Look!

991
01:00:57,272 --> 01:00:58,272
¡Sujétense!

992
01:01:02,345 --> 01:01:03,345
Arroyín!

993
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:12,735
Ramón!

994
01:01:16,861 --> 01:01:17,861
We got you!

995
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:31,775
¡Te atrapé!

996
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:38,632
¡No!

997
01:01:38,918 --> 01:01:40,332
Can not be.

998
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:43,243
I'm sorry, Poppy. We arrived late.

999
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:44,644
In fact...

1000
01:01:44,745 --> 01:01:46,705
They arrived just in time.

1001
01:01:52,405 --> 01:01:56,181
Sorry, I will not let them go before dinner tomorrow.

1002
01:01:56,382 --> 01:01:58,407
Dinner to which everyone is invited.

1003
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:03,347
And I mean all trolls Villa Troll.

1004
01:02:03,548 --> 01:02:06,396
You never will find them where they hide!

1005
01:02:07,392 --> 01:02:10,061
You're right. I would not find them.

1006
01:02:10,263 --> 01:02:13,002
But I could find with someone they know.

1007
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,909
Someone they trust.

1008
01:02:16,979 --> 01:02:17,979
Someone...

1009
01:02:19,094 --> 01:02:20,641
as this little one.

1010
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:22,509
Arroyín! Are you alive!

1011
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,858
- How good! - Yes!

1012
01:02:26,646 --> 01:02:27,702
We will betray!

1013
01:02:27,814 --> 01:02:29,170
Ramón! Wait!

1014
01:02:29,471 --> 01:02:32,970
There must be an explanation. At least give it a chance.

1015
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,698
Thank you, Poppy.

1016
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:36,741
I will not betray.

1017
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:40,967
No wait! Stop!

1018
01:02:43,322 --> 01:02:45,389
You'd better give us an explanation!

1019
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:49,128
When I was about to accept my fate ...

1020
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:52,040
I had what I can only call ...

1021
01:02:52,241 --> 01:02:54,407
a spiritual awakening.

1022
01:02:55,059 --> 01:02:56,261
I do not want to die!

1023
01:02:57,252 --> 01:02:57,990
Do not eat me!

1024
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,745
Gobble someone else! Whoever! To all, but not me!

1025
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:04,217
But the king wants to be happy now.

1026
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:07,369
High! High! There must be another way.

1027
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:10,073
I will do anything.

1028
01:03:14,295 --> 01:03:17,606
Do not! Arroyín, please do not.

1029
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:19,232
Trust me.

1030
01:03:19,433 --> 01:03:23,787
I wish there was another way not to eat me.

1031
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:25,295
But there is not.

1032
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:29,185
And now I have to live with this for the rest of my life.

1033
01:03:29,986 --> 01:03:33,123
At least you will die with a clear conscience.

1034
01:03:33,624 --> 01:03:35,272
Then, somehow ...

1035
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:37,615
arguably...

1036
01:03:37,816 --> 01:03:39,619
I do this for you.

1037
01:03:52,973 --> 01:03:56,623
Listen. It's the cowbell Poppy!

1038
01:03:56,892 --> 01:03:58,955
My baby did it!

1039
01:03:59,056 --> 01:04:00,356
Poppy did it!

1040
01:04:03,723 --> 01:04:05,032
¿Arroyín?

1041
01:04:17,661 --> 01:04:20,837
Trolsticio! Trolsticio! Trolsticio!

1042
01:04:35,181 --> 01:04:37,534
Prepare the main dish.

1043
01:04:38,184 --> 01:04:41,638
Trolls!

1044
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:52,402
¿Poppy?

1045
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:56,676
Poppy! Thank goodness you're okay.

1046
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:58,950
I'm great.

1047
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:02,632
I put all my loved ones to a pot. Thanks for asking.

1048
01:05:05,436 --> 01:05:07,779
¿Poppy? That was...

1049
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,295
sarcasm?

1050
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:11,814
Yes!

1051
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:13,964
Ow mom!

1052
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,873
I am sorry.

1053
01:05:16,221 --> 01:05:18,347
I do not know why I thought I could save them.

1054
01:05:21,405 --> 01:05:25,370
I just wanted to make everyone safe, like you, Dad.

1055
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:26,802
But I could not.

1056
01:05:27,664 --> 01:05:28,730
Poppy.

1057
01:05:31,558 --> 01:05:33,320
I let everybody down.

1058
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:39,695
But Poppy ...

1059
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:41,921
You were right, Ramon.

1060
01:05:42,533 --> 01:05:45,518
Not everything in the world are cupcakes and rainbows.

1061
01:05:58,077 --> 01:05:59,077
Poppy.

1062
01:07:35,212 --> 01:07:39,049
You who are sad

1063
01:07:48,187 --> 01:07:51,436
in lose heart

1064
01:08:09,008 --> 01:08:11,846
I understand you

1065
01:08:12,844 --> 01:08:16,013
It is not easy to be strong

1066
01:08:16,268 --> 01:08:19,361
All people

1067
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:23,290
You think not succeed

1068
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:25,575
And doubt tells you

1069
01:08:25,776 --> 01:08:30,174
You will fail

1070
01:08:55,263 --> 01:08:58,173
What do you do? The king wait! Bring those trolls there!

1071
01:08:58,374 --> 01:09:00,729
- Sorry, Chef. - Of course you feel.

1072
01:09:08,324 --> 01:09:12,666
laugh with me

1073
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:15,913
No more sadness

1074
01:09:16,014 --> 01:09:18,112
I've forgotten already

1075
01:09:19,848 --> 01:09:22,573
Your sweet smile

1076
01:09:22,974 --> 01:09:25,771
If the world overwhelms you

1077
01:09:26,273 --> 01:09:29,717
And not take it more

1078
01:09:29,818 --> 01:09:32,446
And, Buscema

1079
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:35,586
I'll be always there

1080
01:09:35,787 --> 01:09:39,812
Your true colors

1081
01:09:39,913 --> 01:09:42,502
I see shine

1082
01:09:42,703 --> 01:09:46,808
Seeing your colors

1083
01:09:46,909 --> 01:09:51,088
I know you love

1084
01:09:55,252 --> 01:09:58,260
No issues at last

1085
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:01,657
The see show

1086
01:10:01,758 --> 01:10:04,745
your colors

1087
01:10:05,045 --> 01:10:11,440
Actual colors are beautiful

1088
01:10:13,772 --> 01:10:17,735
true colors

1089
01:10:17,836 --> 01:10:20,190
- I see shine - Colors

1090
01:10:20,391 --> 01:10:24,333
Seeing your colors

1091
01:10:24,534 --> 01:10:27,443
I know I love you

1092
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:30,336
No issues at last

1093
01:10:30,437 --> 01:10:33,804
The see show

1094
01:10:34,005 --> 01:10:37,774
your colors

1095
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:40,441
real

1096
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:45,348
How beautiful

1097
01:10:46,482 --> 01:10:50,559
Arcoiris

1098
01:10:53,222 --> 01:10:57,517
Arcoiris

1099
01:11:18,798 --> 01:11:19,798
Thank you!

1100
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,226
Not thanks to you.

1101
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:23,743
Why?

1102
01:11:24,242 --> 01:11:26,552
For teaching me to be happy.

1103
01:11:26,753 --> 01:11:29,616
Really? You finally are you happy?

1104
01:11:29,816 --> 01:11:30,911
Now?

1105
01:11:31,113 --> 01:11:32,542
I think so.

1106
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,529
Happiness is within us, right?

1107
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:38,903
Sometimes we need someone to help us find her.

1108
01:11:41,512 --> 01:11:44,435
What will happen now, Princess Poppy?

1109
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:45,635
I do not know.

1110
01:11:46,063 --> 01:11:48,228
But I know we will not surrender.

1111
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:55,876
No.

1112
01:11:55,976 --> 01:11:57,632
The time has come. Mr. Bear.

1113
01:12:05,253 --> 01:12:06,010
¡Poppy!

1114
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:07,211
¿Bridget?

1115
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:08,762
¡Trolls! ¡Trolls! ¡Trolls!

1116
01:12:08,963 --> 01:12:09,963
What do you do?

1117
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:11,751
I can not let them eat them.

1118
01:12:12,052 --> 01:12:13,132
- But quickly!

1119
01:12:13,233 --> 01:12:14,233
They must go!

1120
01:12:14,733 --> 01:12:16,690
Quick! Get out! Get out of here!

1121
01:12:16,869 --> 01:12:20,150
Do not! If you go in there without us, you know what they will do.

1122
01:12:20,352 --> 01:12:21,152
I know.

1123
01:12:21,353 --> 01:12:23,299
- But. Bridget ... - Never mind.

1124
01:12:25,161 --> 01:12:27,551
Does not matter. Poppy.

1125
01:12:28,367 --> 01:12:30,901
You showed me what it feels like to be happy.

1126
01:12:32,467 --> 01:12:35,658
I never would have felt if not for you.

1127
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:39,706
And I love you for that.

1128
01:12:40,707 --> 01:12:42,715
I love you, Bridget.

1129
01:12:43,699 --> 01:12:45,485
¡Bridget!

1130
01:12:47,605 --> 01:12:49,238
Váyanse of, ¡Apúrense!

1131
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,443
Come with us!

1132
01:12:50,544 --> 01:12:52,377
For they find easily?

1133
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:54,827
Forget this! They must go. Now!

1134
01:12:55,028 --> 01:12:56,129
¡Bridget!

1135
01:13:11,377 --> 01:13:13,100
Goodbye, Poppy.

1136
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:22,147
¡Trolls! ¡Trolls! ¡Trolls!

1137
01:13:27,646 --> 01:13:28,646
Wait!

1138
01:13:28,697 --> 01:13:31,884
Chef, should not wait for the Lady Brillantina?

1139
01:13:33,465 --> 01:13:34,967
You are absolutely right.

1140
01:13:35,168 --> 01:13:36,413
Listen everyone.

1141
01:13:36,514 --> 01:13:40,735
No one will eat trolls until you get the companion of the king.

1142
01:13:42,632 --> 01:13:44,678
Already we expect much!

1143
01:13:44,779 --> 01:13:45,779
Unless...

1144
01:13:45,844 --> 01:13:47,125
Unless what?

1145
01:13:47,226 --> 01:13:49,168
Unless she does not arrive.

1146
01:13:49,369 --> 01:13:53,598
But that's crazy. Who would not want to be with you?

1147
01:14:00,551 --> 01:14:01,760
Yes.

1148
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,602
We should begin.

1149
01:14:03,803 --> 01:14:05,652
¡Trolls! ¡Trolls! ¡Trolls!

1150
01:14:05,853 --> 01:14:08,987
¡Trolls! ¡Trolls! ¡Trolls!

1151
01:14:09,088 --> 01:14:11,981
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls! Yes!

1152
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,745
Come on! Quick! All the world! Come on!

1153
01:14:15,946 --> 01:14:17,506
The book no slouch troll!

1154
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,205
Carefully.

1155
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:28,386
¿Poppy?

1156
01:14:30,723 --> 01:14:33,674
Bridget ruined their lives to save ours. Not well.

1157
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:36,315
He deserves to be happy as we are.

1158
01:14:38,251 --> 01:14:39,942
We all deserve it!

1159
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:45,800
Okay, who's ready to eat trolls?

1160
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:51,490
King Grisel, there is only one thing that can make him happy ...

1161
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:54,754
and there is only one that can give berteno.

1162
01:14:55,255 --> 01:14:56,907
Enjoy your meal!

1163
01:14:58,402 --> 01:14:59,572
They are not!

1164
01:14:59,973 --> 01:15:01,145
They are not?

1165
01:15:01,345 --> 01:15:02,244
They are not?

1166
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:04,124
Idget, what did you do?

1167
01:15:04,325 --> 01:15:05,813
You'd ate them!

1168
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:08,584
Tragona egoísta and greedy.

1169
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:09,808
Do not! I...

1170
01:15:10,009 --> 01:15:12,140
He spoiled the Trolsticio!

1171
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:13,950
Guards, Lock her up!

1172
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,607
To her!

1173
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,252
¿Lady Brillantina?

1174
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:58,762
What?

1175
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,801
But how? Why?

1176
01:16:04,002 --> 01:16:05,268
Why did you do this?

1177
01:16:05,973 --> 01:16:08,980
He thought you would not be with someone like her.

1178
01:16:09,181 --> 01:16:10,754
Please. It's me...?

1179
01:16:10,955 --> 01:16:12,926
Who are you looking for love?

1180
01:16:13,227 --> 01:16:14,919
I do not think so.

1181
01:16:16,408 --> 01:16:18,393
Guards, acábenla!

1182
01:16:19,549 --> 01:16:20,549
No.

1183
01:16:21,387 --> 01:16:22,387
Wait!

1184
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:25,982
Grisel king, when he was with Bridget, he felt something, right?

1185
01:16:26,183 --> 01:16:29,283
Yes, but I thought it was from eating too much pizza.

1186
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:30,484
I also.

1187
01:16:30,585 --> 01:16:33,823
That feeling ... That was happiness.

1188
01:16:33,924 --> 01:16:34,924
What?

1189
01:16:35,184 --> 01:16:37,486
But you have to eat a troll to be happy.

1190
01:16:37,687 --> 01:16:39,170
Everyone knows it.

1191
01:16:39,592 --> 01:16:40,340
You do not?

1192
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:43,580
But the king Grisel has ever eaten a troll, is not it?

1193
01:16:43,681 --> 01:16:45,444
Never.

1194
01:16:45,844 --> 01:16:48,163
And yet, look at me.

1195
01:16:48,831 --> 01:16:50,195
My empty stomach ...

1196
01:16:51,076 --> 01:16:52,780
and my heart full.

1197
01:16:55,967 --> 01:16:57,344
Ignore him!

1198
01:16:57,545 --> 01:17:00,294
There's only one way to be happy! Mine!

1199
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:01,294
¡No!

1200
01:17:01,495 --> 01:17:02,786
With me in charge ...!

1201
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:06,806
I will serve Trolls every day of the year!

1202
01:17:08,084 --> 01:17:09,748
With me as queen ...!

1203
01:17:09,949 --> 01:17:13,137
Life will be a feast intermediable happiness!

1204
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:15,288
Coma! Already!

1205
01:17:15,488 --> 01:17:16,488
¡Coma!

1206
01:17:18,914 --> 01:17:19,914
¡No!

1207
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:25,828
Happiness is not something that can be introduced, because it is already there.

1208
01:17:26,128 --> 01:17:29,311
Sometimes we need someone to help us find her.

1209
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:30,655
Really I can be happy?

1210
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:32,822
- I want to be happy! - I also!

1211
01:17:33,104 --> 01:17:34,104
And me?

1212
01:17:35,561 --> 01:17:37,583
Do you really think I can be happy?

1213
01:17:37,784 --> 01:17:38,884
Clear!

1214
01:17:38,985 --> 01:17:41,749
It is within you! Of all!

1215
01:17:42,112 --> 01:17:43,781
And do not think ...

1216
01:17:44,384 --> 01:17:45,770
it feels!

1217
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,829
A feeling that vibrates in me

1218
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:54,975
It is electricity Fluyendo to leave

1219
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:59,362
And if you want in your inside

1220
01:17:59,462 --> 01:18:03,244
Feel the music Opening the Heart

1221
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,945
I bring the sun here in my bag

1222
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:08,290
The cadence on my feet

1223
01:18:08,491 --> 01:18:11,646
I feel the blood in my veins When running

1224
01:18:12,626 --> 01:18:14,635
I can not help looking at it

1225
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:16,939
phenomenal movement

1226
01:18:16,999 --> 01:18:18,843
It is the extraordinary attraction

1227
01:18:19,044 --> 01:18:20,399
Give me more

1228
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:24,930
Under the light The action is there.

1229
01:18:25,031 --> 01:18:29,263
No where to run When I come to you

1230
01:18:29,465 --> 01:18:33,175
As we move You can feel

1231
01:18:33,576 --> 01:18:36,016
And you imagine I imagine

1232

01:18:51,346 --> 01:18:55,138
No one should go still dancing

1237
01:18:55,339 --> 01:18:56,987
