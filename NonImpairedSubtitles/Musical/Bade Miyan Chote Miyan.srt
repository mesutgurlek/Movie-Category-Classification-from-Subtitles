1
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:34,203
How many times have l told you not
to touch me from behind?

2
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:36,871
l consider anybody touching me
from behind to be my enemy.

3
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,912
Fortunately l'd brush in my hand.

4
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:43,871
Had l a knife or pistol
you would have been lying dead.

5
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:47,586
Tell me, what's the matter?

6
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:50,589
Party has come to buy weapons and
RDX. May l bring him here tomorrow

7
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:53,888
No ! Not here.
l never do business from here.

8
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:57,562
Here l'm a sculptor.

9
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:03,936
l make beautiful sculptures.
What l hide in them, only l know.

10
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:08,941
Where will you meet him?
- ln the hotel. ln any room.

11
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:12,945
What if l'm caught doing
business here.

12
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:16,949
l'm very fearful of being
beaten by the police.

13
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,917
They hang upside down
and turn stick on you.

14
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:25,958
l hear two new inspectors
have come.

15
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,960
Arjun Singh and Pyarelal.

16
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,929
Don't know how are they !

17
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:02,961
What's going on?

18
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:10,669
Can't you see me
sharpening the saw?

19
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:14,006
You take me for an idiot !

20
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:17,676
What is there to take you for?
You are an idiot.

21
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:21,680
Hey ... ! l know everything.

22
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,019
You are panning to escape -
You must take me too.

23
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:31,023
Hey, are you out of your mind?

24
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:34,982
My mind is perfectly sound but if
it goes bad, l start shouting.

25
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:43,991
Hey, why are you doing that?
- You too can tag along with us.

26
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:49,041
Why are you being jealous if your
two brothers are trying to escape.

27
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:53,045
lf three brothers escape together
that will make me very happy.

28
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:58,050
Do you want to swallow the rice
that we have cooked?

29
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,054
We have worked for four nights
to cut these bars.

30
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:05,057
And you want ...
- to get out so easily.

31
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:09,016
Hey Head Constable ... !
- Okay you too come along quietly.

32
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:45,097
We've come out of the jail.

33
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:47,099
But the city must have
been cordoned off.

34
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,101
We can't even buy
a change of clothes.

35
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:55,107
You helped me escape, so it's now
my duty to help you somehow.

36
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:58,076
Ha ! How can you help us -
Your own brain needs fixing.

37
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:04,116
l'll take you to my boss who can
send you out of country overnight.

38
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:07,119
Tell me something about your boss.
- Shall l tell you his name?

39
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,087
Yes !
- Sunder Kala.

40
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:15,127
Welcome, Karim.
Sundar Kala is proud of his men.

41
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:20,132
Like a lion my men can
finish the enemies.

42
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:22,134
And like a bird they can
fly out of the jail.

43
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:27,139
Look at him. We did all the work
and praise goes to him.

44
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,098
Speak up !
- lt'll take time to explain.

45
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:37,149
They are very useful.
The helped me escape from jail.

46
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:39,151
You can keep them.
They are very useful.

47
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:43,110
Fine ! lf you say, l'll keep them.
You both are appointed.

48
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,162
Boss ! We've been surrounded
by the police.

49
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:53,131
Don't move !
Nobody should move from his place.

50
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,169
Don't try anything clever
Sundar Kala !

51
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,796
All my men are armed with gun in
hand and a pistol in pocket.

52
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:03,175
Your men have rifle -
you don't have any !

53
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:08,135
lt's cheating. You've too !
l've none. Give me one.

54
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,851
Why do you want to blacken your
clean hands by killing him?

55
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,853
l can take care of him for you.

56
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,822
First you jailed us
now you want to jail Sunder !

57
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:26,198
Give us a chance to show loyalty.
You give these revolvers to us.

58
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,867
You give us order and then see.
- Fine, take this

59
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:32,826
Now order us.
- Kill him.

60
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,878
Hey Karim ! Have they gone mad ?

61
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:41,213
Hey what you kids are doing ?

62
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:46,218
lf you pull the trigger, the brain
of boss will come out of his cap.

63
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:49,221
We escaped from jail to
catch your boss !

64
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:51,223
That's why we brought
you here, idiot !

65
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:54,226
That's cheating !
- lt isn't cheating, it's setting.

66
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:56,228
But who are these two?

67
00:08:56,228 --> 00:09:03,235
Meet me ! l'm lnspector
Arjun Singh.

68
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:06,204
And l'm lnspector Pyare Mohan.

69
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:14,246
You deliberately punched
me all over.

70
00:09:14,246 --> 00:09:18,250
Sundar Kala had his revolvers
aimed at your temples.

71
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,253
Had we not punched you in time,
he'd have shot into your temples

72
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:24,256
lnstead of warming, your family
would've been weeping by now.

73
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:28,260
Even if you're getting any warmth
that would be from funeral pyre.

74
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,262
And forgive sir, we'd have been
standing there to salute you.

75
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:32,264
Why do you keep talking about
the death that hasn't come?

76
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:35,267
We aren't talking about death -
we are talking about saving you.

77
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:38,937
We risked our life to save you and
we also caught the criminals.

78
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:41,273
lnstead of appreciating it you're
weeping over a couple of punches !

79
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:44,276
Go ! Get out of here and don't
show me your faces.

80
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:47,279
How can we do that. We get paid
for showing our faces to you.

81
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,238
l beg of you, l give you 2-day
vacation, please go from here.

82
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,969
Don't talk with me.
You're late again.

83
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:14,306
What can l do. Man l come with
drives jeep like a bullock-cart.

84
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:17,976
You never come alone. You always
bring some excuses with you.

85
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:20,274
l think l'd stop seeing you.
- What do you mean.

86
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:23,277
l mean, l should marry you.

87
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:30,322
l too want this. But how to
explain this to my brother?

88
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:32,324
He's growing older, but he
doesn't care what happens to me.

89
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:38,330
You mean, l can't marry you too.
- Perhaps ... !

90
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,332
What do you mean by perhaps.
Tell your mom to marry him !

91
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:44,336
What ?
- Your mom should get him married.

92
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:47,339
lf he gets married -
then l get married.

93
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,345
l'm afraid what your brother will
think if he finds out about us.

94
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:56,314
He always wrong opinion about me.
Perhaps l'm little big naught ... !

95
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,351
l want to file a complaint
against Arjun Singh.

96
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,353
What is my crime?

97
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:03,355
He has not yet married.

98
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:07,359
See ... we're a small happy
family of three members.

99
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,361
My mother, my sister and l.

100
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:13,365
When the fourth member comes -
who knows what her nature will be.

101
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:16,368
Will she be able to run this home?
Will she serve my mother or not?

102
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:18,370
l want to avoid these problems.

103
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,372
You can't escape by
such arguments.

104
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,374
lf every man thinks like him there
would be no marriage in this world

105
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:25,377
From youth till old age
girls will remain unmarried.

106
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:27,045
World will end.

107
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:32,384
After hearing arguments from both
sides, Home Minister concludes ...

108
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:34,386
that either you select a girl of
your own choice and marry her ...

109
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:36,388
or l will do that by force.

110
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:40,347
Look at your age. After sometime
we'll hesitate to ask any girl.

111
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:46,398
As you like. lf the proceeding is
over, can l get something to eat.

112
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:49,367
lf you're ready for marriage -
then food is also ready, brother.

113
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:57,409
lt's so nice food ... !
My respects mom.

114
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:01,413
Live long. Sit and eat.
- See a mother's heart.

115
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:04,416
When kids eat - a mother's
heart is delighted.

116
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:08,086
And there are some people
who become jealous.

117
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,088
How dare you come to this house !

118
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:13,091
What're you doing -
let him eat.

119
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:16,428
You live alone Mumbai - you
should always come here to eat.

120
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,430
l think l'd have breakfast too.

121
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,434
lf a man takes good breakfast his
entire day passes pleasantly.

122
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:24,436
Okay then you should come here
for breakfast every day.

123
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:28,440
Put a bed for me. l'll leave
for work after breakfast.

124
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,442
Get out ...

125
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:32,444
l'm being insulted ...
- What're you doing ... ?

126
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:35,447
lf you love him so much,
have some food sent to his house.

127
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:38,450
Why do you treat him like this?
What evil do you see in him?

128
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,454
The evil that l see in him,
you can't see ... !

129
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:44,422
Just a minute ...
You bring my meals.

130
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:56,468
Very good. Excellent.
You've many good weapons.

131
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:59,471
But this time it is going to
be a very big order.

132
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,439
How big will be the order?

133
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:05,477
Ten times bigger than
the last order.

134
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:08,480
Even if it is twenty times bigger,
Zorawar can easily handle it.

135
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,448
Really ! Superb !

136
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:19,447
Mr. Zorawar, you've a big bungalow
why do you have meeting in hotel?

137
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:24,162
Why are hotels meant for?
For meetings among people like us.

138
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:27,165
Book a room in anybody's name -
and just close the door.

139
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:30,502
What goes on behind the
closed door - nobody will know.

140
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:33,471
This room has been booked in the
name of Jamshed.

141
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:36,508
You'll ask who's Jamshed.

142
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:40,512
When l don't know -
how will the police know?

143
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:42,514
l am afraid of the Mumbai police.

144
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:45,517
They beat with canes.

145
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:48,520
l am not afraid of death.
l am afraid of the police.

146
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:59,531
What happened?
- l want to go to bathroom.

147
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:22,554
Open this door.
- lt has ''Don't disturb'' tab.

148
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:26,558
Come on, open.
- l can't open.

149
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:29,527
Don't open the mouth.
Open the door.

150
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:38,570
What are you doing brother?

151
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,572
Are you watching
a super-hit competition.

152
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:43,575
What do you want to do?
Want to get me arrested !

153
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:45,577
Don't you know l'm very
afraid of the police.

154
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:47,579
Just give me the videocassette.

155
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:52,584
Zorawar ! This is proof of your
black deeds. You won't be saved.

156
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:57,544
l've pain in neck so l can't bend.
Give me videocassette - quick.

157
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:01,593
As long as l am alive
you won't get this cassette.

158
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:03,561
Maybe l'll take it after
you are dead.

159
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:11,603
You're lucky.
He was watching it on TV.

160
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:14,606
You've seen the live telecast.

161
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:19,611
What should l do to you.
lt is not your age to die.

162
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:22,580
And your body is too delicate
for putting a bullet in it.

163
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,366
Look ... your confusion and
shaking won't serve any purpose.

164
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,635
A police inspector was
murdered in that hotel.

165
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:46,638
And l can't forgive the murderer
of my inspector.

166
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:48,606
Give your complete statement.
- Yes ...

167
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:51,643
ls this the way to talk
with a girl?

168
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,611
l know our inspector has died,
but this girl is so perplexed ...

169
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:56,648
l'm taking her statement ...

170
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:58,616
You first have some water.

171
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:09,627
Speak up ...
- Yes.

172
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:34,649
Had l not run, he would
have killed me too.

173
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:39,646
Don't be afraid.
Police is with you.

174
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:42,694
We're with you. Don't worry.

175
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:49,701
lf you see that man again -
can you recognize him?

176
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:51,703
We're not going to bother
you any more.

177
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:53,705
Just write your phone
number on this pad.

178
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:56,708
After we find the murderer,
we'll contact you.

179
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,710
Come on, l'll take you home.

180
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,713
At this time she needs a friend
rather than a police officer.

181
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:04,682
Don't think you can do it better
than me. You come with me.

182
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:16,728
Do you live alone in this city?

183
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:20,687
No sir. My friend Neha lives
with me. Just there ...

184
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:29,741
So, you live here.
- Yes. My flat is over there.

185
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:34,746
Okay. l'll now go. When you catch
murderer, call me to recognize him

186
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:37,749
l helped you, entertained you from
police station to here -

187
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:40,752
Just to hear this !
- Sorry. Did l say anything wrong?

188
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,720
You broke my heart.

189
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:46,424
Will we meet only after
we find the criminal?

190
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:48,426
l don't get you !

191
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:51,763
Would you mind if l invite you
for tea or dinner? Would you?

192
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:54,732
Of course not.
You have my phone number.

193
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:00,738
lf you're afraid or suspect
anyone, give us a call.

194
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:11,783
Madhu ! Why did you take so long.
l was so worried.

195
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:13,785
l called you at hotel and found
somebody had been murdered.

196
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:17,789
A police inspector was in a hotel
room. He was murdered.

197
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:19,791
Who did it?

198
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,128
l saw the murderer. l went to
police station to report.

199
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:25,130
How did you come from there?

200
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,133
Pyare dropped me ...
- Pyare ?

201
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:31,136
Yes ... lnspector Pyare Mohan.

202
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:35,140
Gem of inspector ! l was
frightened to see the murder ...

203
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,808
but he calmed me and set my mood ...

204
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:40,812
He was very nice and we
developed good friendship.

205
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:44,482
He'll phone someday and invite
me for tea or dinner.

206
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:48,820
You'll eat when you're invited but
l'm starving because of you.

207
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,789
Serve the food - l'll join you.
- Come fast.

208
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:14,802
Oh my child, my baby, my favorite
kid ... at last l found you dear !

209
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:21,853
lt has taken burden off my chest.
l searched you everywhere.

210
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:24,822
And you were reporting to police.
You were giving your statement.

211
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,860
l'm so afraid of police.

212
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,819
He can't sleep. He can't eat.
And you're having nice dinner.

213
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:38,825
Food is served ...
lt is so tasty.

214
00:19:40,872 --> 00:19:43,875
What are your plans for this girl?

215
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,877
She must be killed.
l've no other choice.

216
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:47,879
She too understands.

217
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:49,847
Shall we eat something ?
- Yes, let's eat.

218
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:11,858
One witness is not yet dead -
another has come to die !

219
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:17,875
Where did she fall ?
- She ran away.

220
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,879
Go and get her, else she too
will go to police.

221
00:20:49,941 --> 00:20:53,900
Where did she vanish ?

222
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:26,940
She had a friend, Neha.
Find out where is Neha.

223
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:37,989
l want to talk with
Pyare Mohan.

224
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:40,958
He is not here, but you seem to be
worried. Tell me. l can help.

225
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:44,958
l'll tell Pyare Mohan only ...
- You tell me. Don't hesitate.

226
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:50,001
l'm Madhu's friend
l've seen her murderer.

227
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:54,631
Tell me more about ...
- l'll tell Pyare Mohan only.

228
00:21:55,673 --> 00:21:58,301
Pyare Mohan is here.
He just came.

229
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:00,678
Some girl is calling.
She has witnessed Madhu's murder.

230
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:02,013
She wants to talk with
Pyare Mohan only.

231
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:04,682
So, have her talk with Pyare Mohan
Why are you asking me to talk?

232
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:06,650
You'll talk with her like
Pyare Mohan. That's my order.

233
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:15,026
Talk like Pyare Mohan.
- Sir, he talks like this.

234
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:17,995
l could have talked like that !
- Then go ahead and talk.

235
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:24,035
l'm Pyare Mohan talking ...
- l am Neha, Madhu's friend.

236
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:26,037
They have killed Madhu.

237
00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:28,039
l want to meet with you.

238
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,041
l want to tell you everything.

239
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,043
Where are you calling from?

240
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:34,011
Where is she calling from?
Sorry ... Ask her again.

241
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:37,014
Where are you calling from?

242
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:42,053
l'm calling from a public booth -
across from Sitara hotel.

243
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:44,055
Don't worry -
l'm coming right now.

244
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:46,023
Where is she calling from?

245
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:49,060
Sir, there is a public booth
across from Sitara hotel ...

246
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,396
You go immediately.
- Sir, send Pyare when he comes.

247
00:22:51,396 --> 00:22:54,065
What if he comes after 2 hours.
- Then what can l o, sir.

248
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:57,068
Look Arjun Singh ... she is a very
important witness in Madhu's case

249
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:01,027
Go there as Pyare Mohan - talk to
her in his style. That's my order.

250
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:36,107
Leave me ... !

251
00:23:36,107 --> 00:23:38,075
You too are that murderer's man -
you have come to kill me.

252
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,114
What are you doing ?
Have you gone crazy ?

253
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:45,116
l'm lnspector Pyare Mohan.
- How can l believe?

254
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:47,084
You don't even have a badge !

255
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,122
Okay then. l'm going back
to the police station.

256
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:54,091
You phone me. l'll pick the phone.
l'll come back again.

257
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:59,130
No. Please wait ...
l'm very much perplexed.

258
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,133
l don't know who should l
trust and who l should not ?

259
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,135
You trust me. Let's go.
- Where.

260
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:09,095
To Pyare Mohan's home - sorry,
to my home. You've no danger.

261
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:20,151
Don't worry. This is a policeman's
home. You're under no danger here.

262
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:23,120
Wait here. l'll pick up the key.
- Okay.

263
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,161
Sir, Pyare is not home.
- Yes, l know.

264
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:32,163
l want key to his flat.

265
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:34,131
Key ! But why?
- Don't ask question.

266
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,135
Key, but why, sir?
- You're questioning again !

267
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:46,177
Listen. lf Pyare Mohan comes -
don't let him come upstairs.

268
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:48,179
Okay, l understand.
- What did you understand?

269
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:53,139
l'd stop him here - shouldn't let
him come up, as you're going up.

270
00:24:57,188 --> 00:25:03,194
Come. You're safe in this house.
Nobody will bother you here.

271
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:07,153
Because it's a policeman's home.

272
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,168
Nobody will search for you here.
lt's a policeman's home.

273
00:25:12,203 --> 00:25:15,172
lt's very hot here.
- lt's hot. l'll put on the fan.

274
00:25:21,212 --> 00:25:26,172
You turned on the light.
- Oh yes. l turned on the light.

275
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:50,207
Which one is your bedroom?
- Bedroom ...

276
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:59,205
ln fact all rooms are my bedrooms.
l live alone. l sleep everywhere.

277
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:06,223
You can rest in this one.

278
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,228
May l ?
- Yes, by all mean.

279
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:18,224
Doors at the police station
all open inside.

280
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:24,230
You've photos of so many girls.
Are they your girlfriends?

281
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:27,240
No. They aren't my girlfriends.
The are all 'wanted' !

282
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,238
You must be hungry -
l'll get something from kitchen.

283
00:26:51,302 --> 00:26:54,305
Give me the key.
- l can't give you key now.

284
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:56,307
Why ?
- You can't go upstairs now.

285
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:58,309
Why can't l go in my home?

286
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:03,314
Mr. Arjun's order.
He told me to say this to you ...

287
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:05,316
You're my servant -
Why do you follow his orders.

288
00:27:05,316 --> 00:27:07,318
He has brought a girl.

289
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:11,322
He said if Pyare comes -
stop him here.

290
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:13,290
Don't let him come upstairs ...

291
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:16,327
How many girls has he
brought here before this ?

292
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:18,329
How can an ugly mind
think of anything nice ?

293
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:21,332
You can do ugly things but
l can't even think about them !

294
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:24,335
What face will you
show to ma and Seema?

295
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:27,304
Now l know why you haven't
married all these years.

296
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:33,344
She is Neha ...
- So what?

297
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:37,348
She is eyewitness to
Madhu's murder.

298
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:41,352
What ?
- Yes. She wanted to meet you.

299
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:44,355
ln your absence Commissioner made
me Pyare Mohan and sent me to her.

300
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:46,357
Why did you bring her here?
- Where else could l take her?

301
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:50,361
They are now after her. l didn't
find any other safe place.

302
00:27:50,361 --> 00:27:53,364
lf she is here, where shall l go?
- l don't know?

303
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:56,367
l'm doing my duty here. l'll stay
here as Pyare Mohan for few days.

304
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:59,370
ln that case l'll stay
in your home as Arjun.

305
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,338
No ... !
- Shy not ... ?

306
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:05,376
l can't keep him in my home.
- Why not ?

307
00:28:05,376 --> 00:28:08,345
Sir, you try to understand !
l've a grown up sister.

308
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,384
What a shame ! lf one unformed
officer can't trust another ...

309
00:28:13,384 --> 00:28:15,386
how will outsiders trust them?

310
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:19,345
Sir, l trust the uniform -
but not the man wearing it !

311
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:24,395
Today an inspector doesn't
listen to Commissioner.

312
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:28,399
When you asked me to stay in his
house, l didn't say a word.

313
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,028
ln that case, l suggest you tell
the truth to Neha.

314
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:35,072
Don't talk like idiots.

315
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:38,409
lf she finds you're not Pyare
Mohan she'll lose faith in police.

316
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:41,412
She'll think police is
playing some game with her.

317
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:46,042
Until she recognizes murderer this
drama will continue. lt's order.

318
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,379
At last we have arrived here !

319
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:59,396
Both have come together ! Looks
you've made peace with each other.

320
00:29:00,097 --> 00:29:04,435
l'm going out for a few days.
- All of a sudden !

321
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:06,437
Policeman's work is always sudden.

322
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:10,441
l'm going to Delhi
by flight tonight.

323
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:13,444
How can we live alone.
Somebody should be with us.

324
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:17,448
Until l come back -
Pyare Mohan will live here.

325
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:20,451
l can't understand you.

326
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:22,453
Sometimes you say -
don't let him enter the house.

327
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:24,455
Now you are asking him
to live here !

328
00:29:24,455 --> 00:29:26,457
Whatever ma. He's our own man.

329
00:29:26,457 --> 00:29:29,460
A policeman can protect another
policeman's family.

330
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,463
How much has improved
in one day.

331
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:34,465
Seema, pack up some food for me.
- Okay.

332
00:29:34,465 --> 00:29:37,468
You're going by plane.
They will serve you food.

333
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:41,427
Ma. When l miss you l'll eat
your hand cooked food.

334
00:29:44,475 --> 00:29:47,444
Here is food.
Where would you like to eat?

335
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:54,485
You have so many photographs.
Who is this man.

336
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:56,487
He is Arjun Singh.

337
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:58,489
Who is Arjun Singh?

338
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:00,491
My friend, my brother,
my everything.

339
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:03,494
But why his photos are more
than your own photos.

340
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:07,498
l live here. Where is the need for
putting my photographs.

341
00:30:07,498 --> 00:30:12,503
He doesn't live here. When l miss
him l see his photos.

342
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:14,505
Come on, have some food.

343
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:17,508
This looks like home made food
- Yes. lt's from home.

344
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:19,510
Whose home?
- My home.

345
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,512
l mean, from Arjun Singh's home.

346
00:30:21,512 --> 00:30:23,514
Looks like you love him very much.
- Yes, more than very much.

347
00:30:23,514 --> 00:30:28,519
l love him so much that l think
about him round the clock.

348
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,487
Who knows what he would be doing !

349
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:35,526
Eat the food.
- Are you feeding a beggar?

350
00:30:35,526 --> 00:30:38,195
Take my name with respect
and say, ''Please eat the food''.

351
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:39,530
Mohan, eat the food.

352
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:44,535
Sounds like you're demanding tax.
Say with love, ''Please eat food''

353
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:46,503
Pyare, eat the food.

354
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:49,540
Sounds like someone
has thrown a stone.

355
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,500
l've so lovely name. Say hi Pyare,
please eat the food.

356
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:57,548
Pyare, please eat the food.

357
00:30:57,548 --> 00:31:00,551
l've never seen such contrived
form of love in life.

358
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:05,556
Anyway, l will eat now.
- No, l'll feed with my own hands.

359
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:09,515
You both brother and sister
show contrived form of love.

360
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:16,567
Tell me. lf a boy and girl like
you and me want to spend life ...

361
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:20,526
together in one home in one room
what should they do?

362
00:31:21,572 --> 00:31:23,574
l will ask my brother.
- You took wrong person's name.

363
00:31:23,574 --> 00:31:26,577
Why does he always come
between our love.

364
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:28,579
What are you doing ?
- Nothing !

365
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:30,547
Leave me.
- Seema.

366
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:47,598
What happened? Have you cold?
- l think you've used my perfume.

367
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:51,602
l live in you home, naturally
l'll use some of your things.

368
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:56,562
l too live in your home, l never
use any of your things.

369
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:05,616
Calling home.
Hello darling.

370
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:09,620
How are you? l know you didn't
sleep last night.

371
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,623
Feeling sleepy.
l too.

372
00:32:12,623 --> 00:32:14,591
l got to perform my duty.

373
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:19,630
What? Your brother?
Why should l be afraid of him?

374
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,598
Haven't you heard =
if you love - don't be afraid.

375
00:32:23,634 --> 00:32:26,603
Hello, Seema.
- Nobody was there ... !

376
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:34,611
Where were you lost?

377
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:40,651
l got phone from police station -
l'm having nightmare since then.

378
00:32:40,651 --> 00:32:42,653
l'll make a phone call.

379
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:51,662
Leave me ... ...
- lf l hold a hand, l never leave.

380
00:32:51,662 --> 00:32:54,665
What are you doing?
- Something l always wanted to do.

381
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:56,667
Somebody might come ... ...
- Who'll come ... ...

382
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,635
your mother is always sleeping.
And your brother isn't here.

383
00:33:02,673 --> 00:33:05,642
Where are you going?
- A girl's modesty is in danger.

384
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,723
Hey you ! Why were you coming
like thieves from the roof?

385
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:54,691
This is my house ...

386
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:58,729
l may enter my house from roof or
window or door - it's my choice?

387
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:00,731
Do you doubt me?
- No, l don't.

388
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:03,734
On the oath of your uniform -
you aren't messing with my sister.

389
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:08,739
Not until now, but the way you're
blaming, l think l should do ...

390
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:12,368
What're you thinking ...
- To make you my brother-in-law ...

391
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:49,746
Let's go to some disco
Let's go out for dinner''

392
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:46,076
Sir, send me back to my home
and Pyare Mohan to his home.

393
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:49,079
Now l won't allow Pyare Mohan
to live in my home.

394
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,083
Look Arjun, not only Pyare Mohan
your sister too loves him.

395
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:56,086
Sir, she is innocent.
- But she is an adult.

396
00:39:56,086 --> 00:40:00,090
And l know although you're hard on
him, but you too like Pyare Mohan.

397
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:04,094
You haven't found about murderer -
perhaps you too have affair with ...

398
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:05,061
What do you mean?

399
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:27,117
Are you swimming, baby?

400
00:40:27,117 --> 00:40:31,121
We too had to swim in cold water
because of you.

401
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:35,080
He has cold.
What if he gets pneumonia?

402
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:39,129
She's so stupid. Lives in a
policeman's home instead our home.

403
00:40:39,129 --> 00:40:44,134
By living with us you'd have saved
your life and you'd have fun too.

404
00:40:44,134 --> 00:40:47,103
There she has only tall man. Here
you can have fun with me, with him.

405
00:40:47,804 --> 00:40:49,139
Now tell quickly what should we
do with her. l'm very cold.

406
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:51,107
We've to kill her.
She too knows about that.

407
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,118
Hey ! Where are you going?
What are you doing?

408
00:41:07,157 --> 00:41:11,116
What happened ... ?

409
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:30,142
Who is he?
- He ... ?

410
00:41:34,184 --> 00:41:37,153
No, not that one ...
- Why did you point to him?

411
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,176
What're you doing. He isn't that !

412
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:06,216
l brought you to recognize a man.
You're so confused !

413
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:08,218
Can't you recognize a face?
- l can recognize.

414
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:12,222
Then why don't you recognize?
- Should l recognize a wrong one?

415
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:15,191
l'm already disturbed and you
shout over me. l'm leaving.

416
00:42:17,227 --> 00:42:21,186
Where are you going? Neha ...
lt's not good to be so angry ...

417
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:26,202
l don't want to talk - why are you
after me? l don't know you.

418
00:42:34,244 --> 00:42:37,213
lf you don't know him -
then try to know us ...

419
00:42:47,257 --> 00:42:49,259
Let's go home.
- Why?

420
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:52,228
lt's not time for pranks -
these goons are after me.

421
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:57,222
These are goons ! No.
The look fine people

422
00:42:58,268 --> 00:43:01,271
Hey tall man.
Leave the girl and run from here.

423
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:06,231
See. How decently they talk.
- You move your tongue too much.

424
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:12,237
Brother, not only tongue -
Sometimes l move my hands too.

425
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:20,290
See how decent are these people.
The don't even talk.

426
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,292
Unnecessarily made me beat them.

427
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:24,294
Let's go.
- Where?

428
00:43:24,294 --> 00:43:27,263
We will go home.
- Unnecessarily you're after me.

429
00:43:52,322 --> 00:44:04,291
This had to happen one day.
What had to happen has happened''

430
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,576
Pyare ! Dear Arjun Singh -
How are you?

431
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:11,581
My dear. How are you.
We have met after so many days.

432
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:14,584
Won't you hug me?
- Let's go out to talk.

433
00:48:14,584 --> 00:48:19,589
He has just come. Let him have tea
- He doesn't drink tea.

434
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:25,595
l drink coffee.
l'm craving to talk with you.

435
00:48:25,595 --> 00:48:27,597
l'll take care of all your
craving outside.

436
00:48:27,597 --> 00:48:29,565
Why outside?
You can talk with him here

437
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,604
You love him so much -
you have put his photos all over.

438
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:36,606
He looks good in photos
not in home. Come.

439
00:48:36,606 --> 00:48:38,608
Come on Neha, let's go out.
- Neha won't come.

440
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:42,612
Why not?
- See. That's why l complain about

441
00:48:42,612 --> 00:48:45,615
He has put me in this jail.
Never takes me out.

442
00:48:45,615 --> 00:48:48,584
Now l've come.
l'll take you out, promise.

443
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,623
This is my case.
- Since when we became different.

444
00:48:53,623 --> 00:48:55,625
Helping one another is duty of
every police officer.

445
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:59,584
l don't need your help.
l'll handle this case myself.

446
00:49:01,631 --> 00:49:03,633
Are you ready to handle this case?
- l don't understand.

447
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:09,973
Unless two parties agree
love doesn't flourish.

448
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:12,976
Do you love him?
- Eyes down - means yes.

449
00:49:12,976 --> 00:49:14,310
Do you love her?

450
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,645
What nonsense !
- Come on Neha.

451
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:17,313
Neha won't come.
- Do you love her.

452
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:18,648
What nonsense.

453
00:49:18,648 --> 00:49:23,608
Say it else you lose age
so shall you lose this girl.

454
00:49:24,654 --> 00:49:26,622
Yes ... !

455
00:49:33,663 --> 00:49:37,622
Sir, looks you're taking her.
l mean taking her out.

456
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:51,981
Seema, how will this
card be for Pyare.

457
00:54:51,981 --> 00:54:55,985
Not Pyare -
Say lnspector Pyare Mohan.

458
00:54:55,985 --> 00:54:58,988
Call your would be brother-in-law
with respect.

459
00:54:58,988 --> 00:55:08,954
You mentioned Pyare Mohan -
Does he really love you?

460
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:15,004
Yes.
- And l too love him very much?

461
00:55:15,004 --> 00:55:16,972
What happened?
- He has affair with me too.

462
00:55:17,673 --> 00:55:20,676
What? Brother was right ...
Pyare isn't trustworthy.

463
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:25,636
He has been cheating us both.
How many more girls will he cheat?

464
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:32,021
What did he do ?

465
00:55:32,021 --> 00:55:34,023
He has played with our hearts.

466
00:55:34,023 --> 00:55:37,026
On one hand he showed
false love to me.

467
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:39,695
On the other hand he showed
false love to me.

468
00:55:39,695 --> 00:55:41,697
He has cheated both of us.

469
00:55:41,697 --> 00:55:43,665
Let me call Pyare Mohan.

470
00:55:46,035 --> 00:55:48,037
Did you call me, sir ?

471
00:55:48,037 --> 00:55:50,005
Do you know them ?

472
00:55:51,707 --> 00:55:54,043
He isn't Pyare Mohan.
He is Arjun.

473
00:55:54,043 --> 00:55:57,012
He is Pyare Mohan.
Arjun Singh is my brother.

474
00:56:02,051 --> 00:56:07,056
Seema doubts me because of you.
Do something.

475
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:10,059
Why did you lie that you aren't
Arjun, you're Pyare Mohan?

476
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:13,062
Cool down madam.
We lied because of you.

477
00:56:13,062 --> 00:56:17,021
Because of me?
l told him to meet you as Pyare.

478
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:21,070
You're adamant to talk with
Pyare and no one else.

479
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,072
Couldn't you tell the truth
afterwards ?

480
00:56:23,072 --> 00:56:25,074
l told him to lie to you.

481
00:56:25,074 --> 00:56:28,077
You're a liar.
l don't want to talk with you.

482
00:56:28,077 --> 00:56:31,046
l too don't want to
support a liar.

483
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,085
Pyare, do something !

484
00:56:36,085 --> 00:56:38,053
Sir, you help us in this situation
- Yes, l'll.

485
00:56:39,088 --> 00:56:42,057
l think there should be
a song in this situation.

486
00:57:28,137 --> 00:57:51,120
Give me your heart ...
And take my heart in return ...''

487
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:54,403
Better late than never.

488
01:01:54,403 --> 01:01:56,405
You've fulfilled my desire
to see my daughter-in-law.

489
01:01:56,405 --> 01:01:58,407
From today, you'll live here.

490
01:01:58,407 --> 01:02:02,036
Yes, a daughter-in-law was needed
in home after Seema is gone.

491
01:02:02,411 --> 01:02:04,079
Ma needs come companion.

492
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,415
Where is Seema going ?
- Won't she be married ?

493
01:02:06,415 --> 01:02:08,417
Only if we find a suitable boy ?

494
01:02:08,417 --> 01:02:10,419
No mischief, brother-in-law.
- Don't be abusive.

495
01:02:10,419 --> 01:02:13,388
lf you want to call me bro-in-law
then you first get married.

496
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:17,426
What are you conspiring about?
- Nothing ma.

497
01:02:17,426 --> 01:02:20,429
Nothing ?
Ma knows everything.

498
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:23,432
Even when she is asleep -
she keeps her eyes open.

499
01:02:23,432 --> 01:02:26,435
Nothing can go on in this home
without my knowledge.

500
01:02:26,435 --> 01:02:30,439
l've always liked Pyare.

501
01:02:30,439 --> 01:02:34,443
Good that l got a daughter-in-law
as well as a son-in-law.

502
01:02:34,443 --> 01:02:39,403
May God always keep you happy and
never let you face any difficulty.

503
01:02:46,455 --> 01:02:49,424
A car is coming ...
May l go and crash with it.

504
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:52,461
Go and crash.
But be careful.

505
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:54,463
Won't you exhort something ?
- Sure. But be careful.

506
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,432
Won't you exhort something ?
- Sure. But be careful.

507
01:03:07,476 --> 01:03:10,445
Oh my God. He's same policeman !

508
01:03:11,146 --> 01:03:13,444
You hit the policeman, idiot.

509
01:03:15,484 --> 01:03:18,453
Oh my younger brother.

510
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:24,493
Come out you bastard -
look what have you done ... !

511
01:03:24,493 --> 01:03:27,496
l'm sorry. lt was a mistake.

512
01:03:27,496 --> 01:03:29,498
Please listen ...
- What can you say?

513
01:03:29,498 --> 01:03:31,466
You've killed this man.
Don't you know how to drive?

514
01:03:33,502 --> 01:03:36,505
Please don't drag us to police -
let's settle here.

515
01:03:36,505 --> 01:03:39,474
How do you want to settle?
- Tell us what do you want?

516
01:03:44,513 --> 01:03:47,482
Elder brother ! Light is going
away from my life.

517
01:03:49,518 --> 01:03:52,487
l can't see.
- He can't see.

518
01:03:53,188 --> 01:03:56,487
l am dying brother ... !
- Don't die brother.

519
01:03:57,526 --> 01:04:00,529
Take this money.
Take him to some hospital.

520
01:04:00,529 --> 01:04:03,498
Money is okay for hospital -
Who'll give doctor's fee

521
01:04:05,534 --> 01:04:08,537
This is for the doctor -
who'll pay for the medicine?

522
01:04:08,537 --> 01:04:10,539
We've only this much.

523
01:04:10,539 --> 01:04:12,541
ls this ring real?
- Yes, it's real.

524
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,543
This one is real too. Take this.

525
01:04:14,543 --> 01:04:16,545
Take his watch.
- Yes take off the watch.

526
01:04:16,545 --> 01:04:18,547
You give your necklace.

527
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:23,552
l'm very cold, get his jacket.
- He's cold - take off the coat.

528
01:04:23,552 --> 01:04:26,521
l've headache - get his cap.
- He has headache, give your cap.

529
01:04:28,223 --> 01:04:29,558
What is this?
- My car key.

530
01:04:29,558 --> 01:04:31,560
Give it to me.

531
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,562
Otherwise, how will l
take him to the hospital ?

532
01:04:33,562 --> 01:04:37,521
l'll go in car. Can't walk.
- Move, else car will hit you.

533
01:04:38,233 --> 01:04:40,531
Elder, we don't have pants -
can you pull off their pants ...

534
01:05:07,596 --> 01:05:12,556
ln my whole life l haven't seen
a thief dressed as a saint.

535
01:05:13,268 --> 01:05:16,605
Don't accuse a saint, child -
you'll become a sinner.

536
01:05:16,605 --> 01:05:18,573
l think he is the biggest sinner.

537
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:24,613
Come to my child, l'll remove
all your doubts. Come.

538
01:05:24,613 --> 01:05:27,616
l'm not afraid.
- Come to me.

539
01:05:27,616 --> 01:05:28,617
Here. l've come.

540
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:33,622
l can tell that you've purse
in your right pocket ...

541
01:05:33,622 --> 01:05:37,626
Yes of course a purse ...
will l carry a nurse in my pocket?

542
01:05:37,626 --> 01:05:43,632
ln that purse you've 685 rupees
and 12 coins.

543
01:05:43,632 --> 01:05:48,637
l know l've 685 rupees but let me
se if there are 12 coins ...

544
01:05:48,637 --> 01:05:50,639
Yes. l have 12 coins.

545
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:55,644
Not a big deal. He must have
removed my purse and put it back.

546
01:05:55,644 --> 01:05:58,647
lf you still don't believe
l can tell you one more thing.

547
01:05:58,647 --> 01:06:00,615
You're in love with
a girl named Vaishali.

548
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:05,609
Vaishali's father is unhappy
with such alliance ...

549
01:06:06,321 --> 01:06:10,659
He has tried to kill you twice.

550
01:06:10,659 --> 01:06:14,663
He failed both times - but he will
be success the third time.

551
01:06:14,663 --> 01:06:17,666
Save me please.
l don't want to die.

552
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:20,669
l'll do repentance
for my mistakes.

553
01:06:20,669 --> 01:06:22,671
What do you want to do?
- Repentance ...

554
01:06:22,671 --> 01:06:27,631
Okay. Hold this in your hand.
l'll chant 'mantras'.

555
01:06:28,677 --> 01:06:32,636
Put it in the fire with
my recitation of 'swaha'

556
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:04,679
Whose baggage is this?

557
01:07:09,718 --> 01:07:12,687
Hey, why do you look to the
baggage like this?

558
01:07:13,722 --> 01:07:15,690
Whose baggage is this?

559
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:19,728
Some queen had come here and
she left her baggage ... !

560
01:07:19,728 --> 01:07:24,733
You stupid, we are standing near
the baggage and it lies before us...

561
01:07:24,733 --> 01:07:26,735
Would it be belonging
to your dad ... !

562
01:07:26,735 --> 01:07:29,738
Does all this belong to you two ?
- Why not ... !

563
01:07:29,738 --> 01:07:35,744
This bag contains my right socks.
- This one socks of my right foot.

564
01:07:35,744 --> 01:07:40,749
ln this, shoes of my right foot.
- ln this shoes of my left foot.

565
01:07:40,749 --> 01:07:43,752
This contains my dhoti-pants.
- This contains my kurta-shirts.

566
01:07:43,752 --> 01:07:47,756
That one contains my combs.
- This contains looking glasses.

567
01:07:47,756 --> 01:07:53,717
Enough ...
All this will go in a tempo

568
01:08:03,772 --> 01:08:05,740
Hey, come here.

569
01:08:09,444 --> 01:08:11,780
Who's in charge of Tempo Stand?
- l sir.

570
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:13,748
Who's the owner of
tempo No.MYH22104?

571
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:17,748
lt doesn't seem to be the tempo
of this stand, sir.

572
01:08:19,788 --> 01:08:21,756
Who is the owner of
this flying carpet tempo?

573
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:25,760
l'll be back soon after
attending to that customer.

574
01:08:35,804 --> 01:08:38,773
Baggage goes in the tempo -
not in your mouth. Shut you mouth.

575
01:08:39,808 --> 01:08:42,777
Are you okay?
Put baggage in tempo.

576
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,777
l'll be back ... !

577
01:08:54,823 --> 01:08:57,792
You make policemen wait in sun.

578
01:09:03,832 --> 01:09:06,801
How dare you put your finger in
policeman's nose?

579
01:09:07,836 --> 01:09:11,795
We'll come again tomorrow. Find
his address else l'll arrest you.

580
01:09:13,842 --> 01:09:15,844
Where did this tempo man go?

581
01:09:15,844 --> 01:09:17,846
Perhaps he is not in a mood
to rent his tempo.

582
01:09:17,846 --> 01:09:20,815
Then, what should we do?
- Let's drive it away.

583
01:10:19,908 --> 01:10:22,911
They are very shameless ... !

584
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:24,913
They've followed our one tempo
with 20 tempos.

585
01:10:24,913 --> 01:10:26,915
Now, what shall we do?

586
01:10:26,915 --> 01:10:29,884
As usual.
Come on.

587
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:39,928
Those of you who like to be
punched should go to him.

588
01:10:39,928 --> 01:10:41,896
Those who prefer to be kicked
should go to him.

589
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:05,954
What is going on?
Trouble in thieves' bazaar !

590
01:11:05,954 --> 01:11:10,914
Looks like they're shooting for
a Hindi movie, Sholay.

591
01:11:12,961 --> 01:11:16,920
These two are proving stronger
than those twenty ... !

592
01:11:53,001 --> 01:11:55,970
Why did you unnecessarily
started messing with these two?

593
01:11:58,006 --> 01:12:02,677
For first time l'm seeing Jackie
and Bruce Lee in Dhoti pants.

594
01:12:02,677 --> 01:12:04,346
What's your respected name?

595
01:12:04,346 --> 01:12:07,015
Respect to the one who
has created this world.

596
01:12:07,015 --> 01:12:09,017
People call me Sharafat Ali.

597
01:12:09,017 --> 01:12:11,986
Tell me brother Sharafat Ali -
where does one sell stolen goods.

598
01:12:15,023 --> 01:12:19,027
You're asking address of barmaid
at the door of a bar !

599
01:12:19,027 --> 01:12:24,032
This entire market is called
Thieves Bazaar ...

600
01:12:24,032 --> 01:12:29,037
and this shop belongs to its
uncrowned king Sharafat Ali.

601
01:12:29,037 --> 01:12:32,040
Tell me what do you want to sell?

602
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,043
We want to get rid of everything
in that tempo.

603
01:12:35,043 --> 01:12:38,046
Where from did you steal
all that baggage?

604
01:12:38,046 --> 01:12:40,048
We robbed a train.
- What?

605
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:44,052
Rail train. We don't rob planes as
anything we throw will be broken.

606
01:12:44,052 --> 01:12:48,056
You are a good comedian.
- l do light comedy sometimes.

607
01:12:48,056 --> 01:12:49,724
Who are you guys?
- He is Big Brother.

608
01:12:49,724 --> 01:12:54,024
And he is my Little Brother.

609
01:14:12,504 --> 01:14:14,506
This man's name is Sharafat Ali.

610
01:14:14,506 --> 01:14:22,514
ln last 9 years Sharafat has not
earned any money -

611
01:14:22,514 --> 01:14:24,850
But he has earned good name.

612
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:29,855
That's good.
Both you name and deeds are good.

613
01:14:29,855 --> 01:14:31,823
But how did you enter
this business.

614
01:14:32,858 --> 01:14:35,827
Out of anger.

615
01:14:36,862 --> 01:14:41,867
l came from Bhopal to Mumbai for
sight seen in my Jonga Jeep.

616
01:14:41,867 --> 01:14:45,871
l parked my jeep for tea and
when l came back ...

617
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:51,877
my Jonga jeep was being sold
in that shop across from here.

618
01:14:51,877 --> 01:14:54,880
That shop ?
- Yes.

619
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,549
lts tires, engine and steering
were taken apart.

620
01:14:57,549 --> 01:15:01,887
l said to the shopkeeper -
brother, this is my Jonga.

621
01:15:01,887 --> 01:15:05,891
He asked, which Jonga ... ?
Now you'll have to buy it.

622
01:15:05,891 --> 01:15:10,896
l asked why should l buy my
own Jonga. l was angry.

623
01:15:10,896 --> 01:15:16,902
l told him not to mess with
Sharafat Ali.

624
01:15:16,902 --> 01:15:19,905
After that day l established
in this thieves market.

625
01:15:19,905 --> 01:15:24,865
l will steel his goods in night -
and sell those to him.

626
01:15:28,246 --> 01:15:30,874
Gradually l took over the
thieves market.

627
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:35,921
Today his shop doesn't have
even one stolen hanky.

628
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:39,880
But some day in Sharafat Ali's
shop Taj Mahal will be sold.

629
01:15:46,932 --> 01:15:49,901
This is the list of their goods.

630
01:15:50,936 --> 01:15:55,941
10 bridal dresses ... bridegroom's
sword ... 75 pair shoes ...

631
01:15:55,941 --> 01:15:59,945
100 mangalsutra ...
Where did you get all this?

632
01:15:59,945 --> 01:16:02,948
We robbed a full train
compartment.

633
01:16:02,948 --> 01:16:06,952
Forget all that. We hear Bombay
is good place for fun ... !

634
01:16:06,952 --> 01:16:09,955
Show some good time to us.

635
01:16:09,955 --> 01:16:13,959
You've befriended Sharafat Ali.
l'll do something for you.

636
01:16:13,959 --> 01:16:19,920
Elder and Little Brothers have
come to Sharafat Ali ...

637
01:16:20,966 --> 01:16:22,934
Show them some colorful dances.

638
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:18,254
Some love us ...
Some offer their lives.''

639
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:19,600
What do we hear this !
- You went to brothel last night !

640
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,604
You danced with courtesans !
- lt is unbelievable, sir !

641
01:22:23,604 --> 01:22:32,613
Who says l'm sir. l'm blind in
one eye. l'm an idiot ... ...

642
01:22:32,613 --> 01:22:35,616
Why are you saying
bad things about you?

643
01:22:35,616 --> 01:22:38,619
How did you get these
injuries, sir?

644
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:42,623
You're asking about injuries?
You're adding insult to injury?

645
01:22:42,623 --> 01:22:44,625
You say as if we're responsible
for your injuries !

646
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:47,628
Yes you are ! Do you know what you
did to me last night?

647
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:49,630
What did we do?

648
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,632
You used foul language.
- Did we ?

649
01:22:51,632 --> 01:22:55,591
You showered currency notes.
- Did we?

650
01:22:56,637 --> 01:22:59,640
And you pushed me.
- Did we ?

651
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,642
Yes, you !

652
01:23:01,642 --> 01:23:04,645
Sir, what nonsense
are you talking?

653
01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:06,647
Don't try to explain.

654
01:23:06,647 --> 01:23:09,616
This is my last warning to you.

655
01:23:10,651 --> 01:23:15,656
lf you do it again, l'll have
your uniform removed ...

656
01:23:15,656 --> 01:23:17,624
and have you thrown behind bars.

657
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,663
Don't go back to police station.
- Fine, we'll go to hill station.

658
01:23:22,663 --> 01:23:25,666
You will go to a film shooting.

659
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:27,668
We aren't interested in
seeing a film shooting.

660
01:23:27,668 --> 01:23:30,671
l'm not sending you to
see a film shooting.

661
01:23:30,671 --> 01:23:33,674
ln fact film industry people
are getting threats.

662
01:23:33,674 --> 01:23:35,676
Madhuri Dixit too has
been threatened.

663
01:23:35,676 --> 01:23:37,644
You both to get her report.

664
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:05,672
Oh, she is Madhuri.

665
01:24:06,707 --> 01:24:09,676
Yes really ! She is Madhuri !

666
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:16,680
Our Madhuri is being attacked.
- We'll teach them a lesson.

667
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,697
Who has dare to cut us?
- What happened?

668
01:24:35,736 --> 01:24:39,695
They aren't really attacking me.
- How dare they attack you?

669
01:24:43,744 --> 01:24:45,712
You've misunderstanding.
We are shooting here for a movie.

670
01:24:51,752 --> 01:24:53,754
Who are these people?

671
01:24:53,754 --> 01:24:57,758
They're inspectors. They came to
my home for taking my report.

672
01:24:57,758 --> 01:25:00,761
l called them here. l'm sorry.
We'll do this shot again.

673
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:08,725
Madhuri, please forgive us.
- We didn't know you're shooting.

674
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:14,775
Bahadur, serve them cold drink or
tea and bring chairs for them.

675
01:25:14,775 --> 01:25:16,743
You sit here.

676
01:25:17,778 --> 01:25:21,737
You look very nice in dhoti-pants
and kurta-shirt.

677
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:29,756
Do you understand?
- Yes !

678
01:25:30,791 --> 01:25:34,795
Chair, tea, cold drinks.

679
01:25:34,795 --> 01:25:36,797
You look very nice in Dhoti-Kurta.

680
01:25:36,797 --> 01:25:46,763
A girl praises only when she has
some kind feelings in heart.

681
01:26:37,858 --> 01:26:46,823
Have a taste of my love
Don't by shy, my darling.''

682
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:50,110
You got a daughter-in-law.

683
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:52,078
No. You got a sister-in-law.

684
01:30:53,113 --> 01:30:57,117
Have you gone crazy - Madhuri will
become your daughter-n-law.

685
01:30:57,117 --> 01:30:59,085
No, Madhuri shall become your
sister-in-law.

686
01:31:03,123 --> 01:31:06,092
Why are we fighting. Let's ask
Madhuri who shall she marry?

687
01:31:07,127 --> 01:31:10,096
Sir, madam has called you.

688
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:23,109
l'm sorry - l made you wait.

689
01:31:24,144 --> 01:31:29,149
What do you say? When you can wait
for me for so many years ...

690
01:31:29,149 --> 01:31:31,151
can't l wait for a few hours?

691
01:31:31,151 --> 01:31:34,154
l don't understand?
- What's so hard to understand !

692
01:31:34,154 --> 01:31:38,158
We started loving at first sight
and have decided to marry ...

693
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:40,160
who had thought this will happen?
Not me.

694
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,128
What nonsense are you talking?

695
01:31:43,163 --> 01:31:47,167
Don't worry. You work in movies
as long as you like ...

696
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:50,170
After you get bored -
we will get married.

697
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:55,130
Get up ... ...

698
01:31:57,177 --> 01:31:59,145
Oh madam ...

699
01:32:05,185 --> 01:32:07,153
What happened?

700
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:13,148
When l went there -
Madhuri was on my chest.

701
01:32:14,194 --> 01:32:16,196
She started crying.

702
01:32:16,196 --> 01:32:21,201
But l thought - l am a thief.
l've no life, l've no home ...

703
01:32:21,201 --> 01:32:23,203
How can l make Madhuri wander
with me after marriage.

704
01:32:23,203 --> 01:32:27,207
So, with heavy heart, l told her
l can't marry her.

705
01:32:27,207 --> 01:32:29,209
She can marry any hero.

706
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:31,211
You made a sacrifice.
But l won't.

707
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:33,179
l'll live in Madhuri's bungalow.

708
01:32:34,214 --> 01:32:37,217
Watch. How l make her agree.
- Go ! You too will be beaten.

709
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:55,235
This must be very tiring.

710
01:32:55,235 --> 01:32:59,239
From morning till evening -
so many people, so much work.

711
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:03,243
Listen. Your partner's no manners.

712
01:33:03,243 --> 01:33:05,245
He doesn't know hot to talk.

713
01:33:05,245 --> 01:33:09,204
But you look sensible tome.

714
01:33:12,252 --> 01:33:16,256
l know he isn't suitable for you.
He just came after you.

715
01:33:16,256 --> 01:33:18,258
l am suitable for you.

716
01:33:18,258 --> 01:33:26,266
Try me. Ask me to dance, fight,
sing or even to hug you.

717
01:33:26,266 --> 01:33:29,235
You try me anyway, Madhuri.

718
01:33:32,272 --> 01:33:35,241
Get up ... Get away from here ...
- But what happened.

719
01:33:41,281 --> 01:33:43,249
What kind of inspectors they are !

720
01:33:46,286 --> 01:33:49,255
But Madhuri, what happened?

721
01:33:55,295 --> 01:33:57,297
You have come again.

722
01:33:57,297 --> 01:34:00,300
You said you'll give
your statement here !

723
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,302
l'll complain to police
commissioner,

724
01:34:02,302 --> 01:34:04,304
l'll have your uniform
removed.

725
01:34:04,304 --> 01:34:07,307
Madam, please speak decently.

726
01:34:07,307 --> 01:34:10,276
Now you'll teach me decency !

727
01:34:26,326 --> 01:34:29,329
Bot of you want to
marry Madhuri Dixit.

728
01:34:29,329 --> 01:34:32,332
Sir, please listen to us.
- l don't want to hear anything.

729
01:34:32,332 --> 01:34:34,334
Have you seen your
face in the mirror?

730
01:34:34,334 --> 01:34:36,336
One is so tall that
he has no end.

731
01:34:36,336 --> 01:34:39,339
Other ends even before starting.

732
01:34:39,339 --> 01:34:41,307
Sir, l'm about your height.

733
01:34:42,342 --> 01:34:44,344
Why are you being personal.

734
01:34:44,344 --> 01:34:48,348
Sir, you don't know these heroines.
They've hidden agenda in everything

735
01:34:48,348 --> 01:34:52,352
She wants publicity by
associating her name with us.

736
01:34:52,352 --> 01:34:58,358
Publicity? Then why doesn't she
associate it with a Commissioner.

737
01:34:58,358 --> 01:35:01,361
lt was my mistake to send you.

738
01:35:01,361 --> 01:35:04,330
Now l am going to her.

739
01:35:11,371 --> 01:35:15,330
He will be beaten.
- He'll be beaten very badly.

740
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:18,344
Are you leaving?
- Yes.

741
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:23,383
On duty.
- l am going on duty.

742
01:35:23,383 --> 01:35:26,386
Do you remember anything
other than your duty?

743
01:35:26,386 --> 01:35:28,055
Yes l remember.

744
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:29,723
What?
- You.

745
01:35:29,723 --> 01:35:31,391
What is the day today?

746
01:35:31,391 --> 01:35:34,394
Tuesday !
- What else?

747
01:35:34,394 --> 01:35:38,353
23rd March.
- What's importance of 23 March?

748
01:35:39,399 --> 01:35:41,367
Why are you puzzling me?
Tell me what's the matter?

749
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:44,404
Today is Seema's birthday.

750
01:35:44,404 --> 01:35:46,372
Oh my God! l forgot
such important day.

751
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:50,410
Seema ! Many happy
returns of the day.

752
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:53,413
You were borne today and
you have grown so much.

753
01:35:53,413 --> 01:35:56,416
Neha must have told you this.

754
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:59,419
Don't say that. Can a brother
forget his sister's birthday?

755
01:35:59,419 --> 01:36:01,421
Rather l told Neha that
today is your birthday ...

756
01:36:01,421 --> 01:36:03,423
and she should not forget
to wish you.

757
01:36:03,423 --> 01:36:06,426
Neha wished me early morning.
- What should l do ... !

758
01:36:06,426 --> 01:36:09,429
Wait. Let me put something
sweet in your mouth.

759
01:36:09,429 --> 01:36:13,433
Make all preparation for evening.
We shall eat cake and go for dinner

760
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:15,435
Why did you tell her?

761
01:36:15,435 --> 01:36:17,437
You embarrassed me.

762
01:36:17,437 --> 01:36:20,440
You forget and show anger.

763
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,442
Do you remember anything else?

764
01:36:22,442 --> 01:36:24,444
ls there anything else?
Maybe your birthday !

765
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:27,447
You had promised to give
a necklace to Seema.

766
01:36:27,447 --> 01:36:29,415
Oh my God. What is wrong
with my memory.

767
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:35,455
Let me do like this. l'll order it
with Popley Jewellers on my way.

768
01:36:35,455 --> 01:36:38,458
You can pick up from there.

769
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:41,427
Okay. l'll bring it
on my way home.

770
01:36:48,468 --> 01:36:50,436
What are you looking around, sir.

771
01:36:51,471 --> 01:36:55,475
Any restriction on looking around?
- No sir.

772
01:36:55,475 --> 01:36:58,478
l can select only after looking.
- Yes, do select other things.

773
01:36:58,478 --> 01:37:02,437
But before that look at this one
you asked us to make for your.

774
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:09,489
This my necklace.
- Yes you selected this one.

775
01:37:09,489 --> 01:37:12,492
Why did you take the trouble of
coming. l was about to send it.

776
01:37:12,492 --> 01:37:18,498
Yes l did take the trouble, but ...
- Don't worry. You can pay later.

777
01:37:18,498 --> 01:37:21,467
Money isn't going anywhere.
Please take it.

778
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:29,142
This is a strange city.
l get everything effortlessly.

779
01:37:36,183 --> 01:37:39,519
l didn't expect you will
pick up the necklace.

780
01:37:39,519 --> 01:37:41,521
Necklace?
- Come on.

781
01:37:41,521 --> 01:37:43,523
Where?
- Home.

782
01:37:43,523 --> 01:37:47,527
Why are you dressed like this?
Were you following somebody?

783
01:37:47,527 --> 01:37:49,529
What's that girl doing
to the Elder brother?

784
01:37:49,529 --> 01:37:52,498
Come on.
- Where are you taking me?

785
01:37:56,536 --> 01:37:59,505
Why are you pushing me?

786
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,508
She is taking him in the car !

787
01:38:12,552 --> 01:38:14,554
Come ...
- Where?

788
01:38:14,554 --> 01:38:16,556
lnside.
- Why?

789
01:38:16,556 --> 01:38:19,559
Come in the house.

790
01:38:19,559 --> 01:38:21,561
No l won't.

791
01:38:21,561 --> 01:38:24,530
Why are you behaving like this?
- What are you doing?

792
01:38:25,565 --> 01:38:28,534
You're forcing me.
- Yes, l am forcing.

793
01:38:29,569 --> 01:38:35,575
You've come before time today.
And what clothes are you wearing?

794
01:38:35,575 --> 01:38:38,544
This is Dhoti, this is Kurta and
this is scarf. Don't ask again.

795
01:38:39,579 --> 01:38:44,584
Good you've come. Where is other?
- Who?

796
01:38:44,584 --> 01:38:47,553
She know the younger brother too !

797
01:38:57,597 --> 01:39:00,600
Who's that?
- What are you looking for?

798
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,604
What am l looking for? Why?
- Come inside.

799
01:39:04,604 --> 01:39:06,606
lnside?
- Now even brother has agreed.

800
01:39:06,606 --> 01:39:09,575
Without asking me?
- Come on.

801
01:39:12,612 --> 01:39:16,616
Strange ! Today both have
come well before time.

802
01:39:16,616 --> 01:39:18,618
But why are you wearing
these clothes?

803
01:39:18,618 --> 01:39:20,620
Everybody is asking about clothes !

804
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:23,623
We aren't naked.
lsn't enough we're wearing clothes?

805
01:39:23,623 --> 01:39:27,627
Why are you being cross. Perhaps
some criminal has upset your mood.

806
01:39:27,627 --> 01:39:29,595
Where is my necklace.
- Hear.

807
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:32,598
l'll wear it.

808
01:39:37,637 --> 01:39:39,639
You came back so soon.

809
01:39:39,639 --> 01:39:42,642
What do you mean?
l've come on time.

810
01:39:42,642 --> 01:39:46,646
Money wasn't going anywhere !
Okay, give it.

811
01:39:46,646 --> 01:39:48,648
What?
Money.

812
01:39:48,648 --> 01:39:51,651
Why? Don't you trust policemen?

813
01:39:51,651 --> 01:39:54,654
Do you think l'll go away
without paying you.

814
01:39:54,654 --> 01:39:57,657
Sir, l didn't say that.
- Bring the necklace.

815
01:39:57,657 --> 01:40:02,662
Are you joking? You took the
necklace half an hour ago.

816
01:40:02,662 --> 01:40:06,666
What nonsense?
- lt's not nonsense, sir.

817
01:40:06,666 --> 01:40:09,669
By God, l had given you the
necklace in presence of everyone.

818
01:40:09,669 --> 01:40:11,671
Why don't you say something?
Why all of you are quiet?

819
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:14,674
So, you've already prepared
your witnesses.

820
01:40:14,674 --> 01:40:18,678
Do you know punishment for
cheating and lying to a policeman?

821
01:40:18,678 --> 01:40:22,682
You're lying. Taking advantage of
uniform you don't want to pay me.

822
01:40:22,682 --> 01:40:27,642
But l'll take it from you.
lt was a necklace of Rs.100,000.

823
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,692
How does it look brother?
- She called me brother.

824
01:40:32,692 --> 01:40:35,695
And she is showing it too?
- A good thing will look good.

825
01:40:35,695 --> 01:40:38,698
Why are you talking like this?
- l'm talking with my mouth.

826
01:40:38,698 --> 01:40:41,701
First you're wearing rustic dress
and now you're talking rustic.

827
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:43,703
You don't like my language and
clothes. l'm going from here.

828
01:40:43,703 --> 01:40:46,706
Yes, we're going from here.

829
01:40:46,706 --> 01:40:48,674
At least eat the cake.
- Cake !

830
01:40:51,711 --> 01:40:53,713
No knife ... !
- l'll bring right now.

831
01:40:53,713 --> 01:40:55,681
Wait. Do you need a knife?
Here it is.

832
01:40:58,718 --> 01:41:00,720
Since when are you
carrying a knife?

833
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,722
We got to carry.
We're in dangerous work.

834
01:41:02,722 --> 01:41:05,725
But such a big knife !
- We do big jobs. Can't carry nail.

835
01:41:05,725 --> 01:41:07,693
Take this.
- Cut the cake.

836
01:41:08,728 --> 01:41:13,688
Oh you want to cut this one.
- We cut so many thins with it.

837
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:23,743
Seema. Call mommy.
We'll eat with mom.

838
01:41:23,743 --> 01:41:25,745
Yes, right now.

839
01:41:25,745 --> 01:41:29,704
There is no water in the glass.
- l'll bring it.

840
01:41:42,762 --> 01:41:46,766
Come mother. l want to feed you
with my own hands.

841
01:41:46,766 --> 01:41:50,770
Your mood keeps changing.
Now you're angry, now you show love

842
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:53,773
Mother is always lovable.
You eat mom.

843
01:41:53,773 --> 01:41:56,742
l'll feed some rice to her.
- You must eat from my hand.

844
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:13,793
l've eaten so much that
l feel very sleepy.

845
01:42:13,793 --> 01:42:15,795
Yes, it's showing effect.
- What's showing effect?

846
01:42:15,795 --> 01:42:19,799
lt's effect of the food.
Nice food always causes effect.

847
01:42:19,799 --> 01:42:22,802
lndeed, food was nice.
l'm feeling sleepy.

848
01:42:22,802 --> 01:42:24,770
We will carry her.

849
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:23,955
Give my darling, please give me ...
Take my love in return, take it...

850
01:45:58,651 --> 01:46:02,109
Who can that be?
- You look.

851
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:13,132
There is nobody.
lt is only a looking glass.

852
01:46:18,171 --> 01:46:20,139
Yes, indeed.

853
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:27,847
But we're in Kurtas.
On the other end they're in uniform

854
01:46:27,847 --> 01:46:30,145
What?
- Police uniform.

855
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:35,143
That's the problem with girls.
Little delay. They lock you out.

856
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:39,192
That's why l never want to marry

857
01:46:39,192 --> 01:46:41,160
Do you understand?

858
01:46:42,195 --> 01:46:44,197
Oh ! Double roll.
- Yes.

859
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:48,201
The are policemen. lf they catch us
they will beat us.

860
01:46:48,201 --> 01:46:50,169
l've a master key.

861
01:46:56,209 --> 01:46:59,212
Look, they are sleeping.
They aren't concerned about us.

862
01:46:59,212 --> 01:47:01,214
And they had invited
us for dinner.

863
01:47:01,214 --> 01:47:04,183
Come on. Let's serve ourselves.

864
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:15,228
Where is Sharafat Bhai?
- He was arrested in a police raid.

865
01:47:15,228 --> 01:47:18,231
What is the use of our friendship.
We are out, and he is n lockup !

866
01:47:18,231 --> 01:47:20,233
Which police station did he go?

867
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:24,237
Why don't you go ahead of me?
Are you taking me, or am l?

868
01:47:24,237 --> 01:47:26,205
l am taking you.

869
01:47:30,243 --> 01:47:33,872
Sir, he is Sharafat Ali.
He was caught buying stolen goods.

870
01:47:35,915 --> 01:47:41,921
Hey constable. By God you've
brought me to right place.

871
01:47:41,921 --> 01:47:45,258
Get up ...
- What are you doing brother?

872
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:48,227
This uniform has made you
forget you friend !

873
01:47:49,262 --> 01:47:51,264
You look ver impressive
in this uniform.

874
01:47:51,264 --> 01:47:55,268
You slapped on the face
of friendship.

875
01:47:55,268 --> 01:47:59,272
Now l get it. You're slapping
just for showing these constables.

876
01:47:59,272 --> 01:48:02,275
But you slap me lightly -
l will cry very loudly.

877
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:06,279
Why are thrashing me for real?

878
01:48:06,279 --> 01:48:09,282
Tell me who you buy from
and where do you sell?

879
01:48:09,282 --> 01:48:12,911
lf l tell truthfully,
you too will be in a problem.

880
01:48:13,286 --> 01:48:15,254
Will l be in a problem?

881
01:48:15,955 --> 01:48:18,291
He is punching unabated.

882
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:24,297
l think l'll have to
speak the truth.

883
01:48:24,297 --> 01:48:28,301
Hey listen everybody -
l buy stolen goods from him.

884
01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:34,307
Do you buy from me ?
- Yes. You sell stolen goods to me.

885
01:48:34,307 --> 01:48:36,309
Lock him up.

886
01:48:36,309 --> 01:48:39,312
Don't give him food for two days.
That will teach him a lesson.

887
01:48:39,312 --> 01:48:42,315
You seem upset.
- He says l sell stolen goods.

888
01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:44,283
When did you start?

889
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:48,321
Who is speaking?

890
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:51,324
Get read for promotion.
- Why?

891
01:48:51,324 --> 01:48:55,328
A big smuggling deal is being
planned near Mulund crossing.

892
01:48:55,328 --> 01:48:58,331
Where are you speaking from?
- From my mouth !

893
01:48:58,331 --> 01:49:00,333
No nonsense ! Who are you?
- l am an informer.

894
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:03,302
Don't you understand this?

895
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:11,310
What happened?
- Mulund.

896
01:49:12,345 --> 01:49:14,313
Mulund?
- Crossing.

897
01:49:16,349 --> 01:49:19,318
No.2
Smuggling.

898
01:49:20,019 --> 01:49:22,317
Who was he.
- An informer.

899
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:40,339
Sir, you came back so soon.

900
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,376
Do l need your permission?
- No, l mean ...

901
01:49:43,376 --> 01:49:46,379
What happened to you?
- Do l look sick ?

902
01:49:46,379 --> 01:49:49,382
Do l look stupid.
Remain in limit, else ...

903
01:49:49,382 --> 01:49:51,384
l'll take off your uniform and make
you run naked in the desert.

904
01:49:51,384 --> 01:49:58,391
Where is Sharafat?
- ln the lockup.

905
01:49:58,391 --> 01:50:00,393
You said put him in the lockup.
- When did l say that?

906
01:50:00,393 --> 01:50:02,395
Cool down.
He might have said that.

907
01:50:02,395 --> 01:50:04,397
Didn't he say?
- Yes.

908
01:50:04,397 --> 01:50:06,399
Now l say, let him go.

909
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:09,402
But sir, you said to put
him in the lockup.

910
01:50:09,402 --> 01:50:16,409
You stay back. He has already
beaten. Maybe now it's your turn.

911
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:19,412
Why do you talk like this.
Maybe it makes you happy.

912
01:50:19,412 --> 01:50:24,417
He slapped my cheeks
like punching bag.

913
01:50:24,417 --> 01:50:27,420
What are you saying Sharafat?
How can l dare punch you?

914
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:30,423
Not once, but many times.
Ask them. They were laughing.

915
01:50:30,423 --> 01:50:32,425
Were you laughing?

916
01:50:32,425 --> 01:50:35,428
Don't say no.
l don't like to hear no.

917
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:40,388
l'm a very rigid police officer.
You haven't seen my temper yet.

918
01:50:42,435 --> 01:50:44,437
Who caught dacoit Mohar Singh?

919
01:50:44,437 --> 01:50:46,439
l was on vacation that day.

920
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:48,407
You tell me.
- l had gone out for collection.

921
01:50:49,442 --> 01:50:51,444
You tell me.
- By God, l didn't catch him.

922
01:50:51,444 --> 01:50:54,447
What about you.
- l can't speak, l am dumb.

923
01:50:54,447 --> 01:50:56,449
Really. lf you are dumb
then l don't have hands.

924
01:50:56,449 --> 01:51:01,409
They are refusing to admit as if
l am going to blame them.

925
01:51:03,456 --> 01:51:09,462
ln fact l caught the
dacoit Mohar Singh.

926
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:13,466
When l went out to catch Mohar
Singh, a fierce chase took place.

927
01:51:13,466 --> 01:51:15,434
He was running ahead,
l followed him in my jeep.

928
01:51:18,471 --> 01:51:21,474
His feet got hurt
and came in my hand.

929
01:51:21,474 --> 01:51:23,476
l invited him to sit in my jeep.
l told him ...

930
01:51:23,476 --> 01:51:25,478
You run when road is good
so that l can catch you.

931
01:51:25,478 --> 01:51:28,481
On good road l asked him to
run again.

932
01:51:28,481 --> 01:51:30,483
That road ended in a jungle.

933
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:32,485
l followed him on foot
in to a swamp.

934
01:51:32,485 --> 01:51:34,487
Mohar Singh jumped out to
other end of swamp.

935
01:51:34,487 --> 01:51:36,489
When l tried to jump
l go caught into the swamp

936
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:40,493
l was being drawn into the swamp.
l was all-alone.

937
01:51:40,493 --> 01:51:42,495
No animal, no man, not even a bird.

938
01:51:42,495 --> 01:51:45,498
Gradually l was going deep
into the swamp.

939
01:51:45,498 --> 01:51:48,501
What are you looking.
lt's a matter of being afraid.

940
01:51:48,501 --> 01:51:50,503
l didn't know how to save myself.

941
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:52,505
Suddenly l'd an idea.
l went to a nearby village.

942
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:54,507
l bought a rope, pulled myself
out and came back here.

943
01:51:54,507 --> 01:51:59,467
You talked too much. Sharafat is
out. Before they come. Let's run.

944
01:52:06,519 --> 01:52:08,521
Take me with you.

945
01:52:08,521 --> 01:52:12,480
lf anybody asks for me -
tell him l'll be in my home.

946
01:52:15,861 --> 01:52:21,534
lf there were few more policemen
like you lndia's prisons will be ...

947
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:23,536
and all criminals will be free.

948
01:52:23,536 --> 01:52:25,538
Trust me, sir. l had locked up
Sharafat Ali.

949
01:52:25,538 --> 01:52:27,506
You mean they are lying.
- Yes sir.

950
01:52:28,541 --> 01:52:30,543
No sir, we're telling the truth.

951
01:52:30,543 --> 01:52:32,545
Sir, he made us say whatever
he wanted us to say.

952
01:52:32,545 --> 01:52:36,549
He slapped if we said no.
- Pyare always seconded him.

953
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:38,551
They are obviously lying -
but l don't know why !

954
01:52:38,551 --> 01:52:40,553
Arjun was telling us stories.

955
01:52:40,553 --> 01:52:42,555
l will ...
- You shut up. You speak.

956
01:52:42,555 --> 01:52:45,558
He used cane to make us agree
to whatever he said.

957
01:52:45,558 --> 01:52:47,560
He said he caught
dacoit Mohar Singh.

958
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:51,519
And said, never say no.

959
01:52:53,566 --> 01:53:00,239
You arrested Mohar Singh. You can't
arrest an ordinary criminal.

960
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:02,207
How can you arrest Mohar Singh.

961
01:53:03,576 --> 01:53:07,580
l've decided to give you
one last chance.

962
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:10,583
You know 1/2 Kohinoor diamond is
in England ...

963
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:12,585
and the other 1/2 has come
back to lndia.

964
01:53:12,585 --> 01:53:15,588
That 1/2 is kept in museum
so people may see it.

965
01:53:15,588 --> 01:53:19,547
l've decided to put you on
duty in that museum.

966
01:53:21,594 --> 01:53:25,553
lf anything goes wrong don't say
that sir, we were not there.

967
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:34,563
Don't worry, we'll protect the
diamond more than our own life.

968
01:53:41,614 --> 01:53:47,620
This is 1/2 of Kohinoor. Steal it
for me. l'll give your asking price

969
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:50,623
l read it'll be on public display
after a few days.

970
01:53:50,623 --> 01:53:54,582
lt'll be delivered to you as
soon as it is displayed.

971
01:53:59,632 --> 01:54:03,591
Every time you forget my tea.
- l'll bring it. Why do you pinch.

972
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:10,598
What do you want?
- What do you have?

973
01:54:17,983 --> 01:54:19,951
All these things.
What should l bring for you?

974
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:22,321
Bring two plates of everything.

975
01:54:22,321 --> 01:54:25,290
Two plates?
Are more people coming?

976
01:54:25,658 --> 01:54:28,627
We are enough.
- Will two of you eat all that?

977
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:31,630
Are you eating for
the first time in life?

978
01:54:36,669 --> 01:54:38,671
What is happening?

979
01:54:38,671 --> 01:54:41,640
Perhaps Commissioner is losing
brain along with his hair.

980
01:54:42,675 --> 01:54:44,643
Bring the food l ordered.
- How can l. They ate everything.

981
01:54:50,683 --> 01:54:53,686
There is nothing left in the
kitchen except myself.

982
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:55,688
Put salt and pepper over me
and eat.

983
01:54:55,688 --> 01:54:58,357
Bring some tea.
- How many dozens?

984
01:54:58,357 --> 01:55:01,360
What's happening? We're two -
we'll take two cups of tea.

985
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:04,329
l'll see if there is any.
Chances are very remote.

986
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:08,701
What's happening?
- lt is a challenge.

987
01:55:08,701 --> 01:55:14,333
By assigning security of diamond,
commissioner has given a challenge.

988
01:55:19,712 --> 01:55:22,715
Who ordered the tea.
- You asked me to bring tea.

989
01:55:22,715 --> 01:55:25,718
We don't drink tea.
We drink milk.

990
01:55:25,718 --> 01:55:27,720
Or we take milk pudding.
Go, brink milk pudding.

991
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:29,688
Why are you bothering.
Better take the tea.

992
01:55:33,726 --> 01:55:36,729
Kohinoor diamond will be brought to
the museum today.

993
01:55:36,729 --> 01:55:39,698
lt will be displaced
to the public tomorrow.

994
01:55:41,734 --> 01:55:43,702
l think we should inspect the
security today.

995
01:56:01,754 --> 01:56:03,756
Here is the milk pudding.

996
01:56:03,756 --> 01:56:07,760
What is this brother.
- l knew you'll say this.

997
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:11,764
Didn't you say bring milk-pudding.
- We said tea not milk-pudding.

998
01:56:11,764 --> 01:56:15,723
l'll go crazy.
Hey, come here.

999
01:56:16,769 --> 01:56:18,737
Here is your tea.

1000
01:56:19,772 --> 01:56:21,774
Give me Rs.1080.

1001
01:56:21,774 --> 01:56:23,776
What? Rs.1080?

1002
01:56:23,776 --> 01:56:26,745
One cup of tea for Rs.540 !
- Kadir Bhai.

1003
01:56:31,784 --> 01:56:35,743
Why have you been calling me?

1004
01:56:36,455 --> 01:56:38,753
They aren't paying for the
food they ate.

1005
01:56:43,796 --> 01:56:47,800
Are you harassing the kid
with your police uniform?

1006
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:49,802
Should a call Shyamu.

1007
01:56:49,802 --> 01:56:51,804
Who is Shyamu?
- Your Commissioner, Shyamlal.

1008
01:56:51,804 --> 01:56:54,807
He is my childhood buddy.

1009
01:56:54,807 --> 01:56:58,811
No. Don't phone the Commissioner.
We'll give you the money.

1010
01:56:58,811 --> 01:57:00,813
What is happening?

1011
01:57:00,813 --> 01:57:03,782
Take out the full amount -
and his tip too.

1012
01:57:36,849 --> 01:57:38,851
Who is the security in-charge?

1013
01:57:38,851 --> 01:57:40,853
So What?
l'm the in-charge of this museum.

1014
01:57:40,853 --> 01:57:43,856
Security of diamond is
my responsibility.

1015
01:57:43,856 --> 01:57:45,858
l'll let you in after
investigating your right and left.

1016
01:57:45,858 --> 01:57:50,863
Will you investigate us?
- So What?

1017
01:57:50,863 --> 01:57:54,867
Even thieves wear police uniforms
these days.

1018
01:57:54,867 --> 01:57:56,835
Come in.
- Seems crazy.

1019
01:58:08,881 --> 01:58:10,883
Did you see the arrangement?

1020
01:58:10,883 --> 01:58:14,887
Yes we saw the inside arrangement.
We'll do the outside security.

1021
01:58:14,887 --> 01:58:23,896
You came back again !
What do you want now?

1022
01:58:23,896 --> 01:58:26,899
We've come to inspect security
of the diamond.

1023
01:58:26,899 --> 01:58:28,901
But you just now inspected.
- So what?

1024
01:58:28,901 --> 01:58:31,904
Don't you eat twice a day?
Don't you watch TV or wife twice?

1025
01:58:31,904 --> 01:58:35,908
We may see twice or 1000 times.
Your duty is to show. Show it.

1026
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:38,877
Okay, come in.
Open the door.

1027
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:50,923
We've put cameras all around.

1028
01:58:50,923 --> 01:58:55,883
Anyone approach the diamond
will be photographed.

1029
01:58:56,595 --> 01:58:59,894
What's so special about it.
Anybody can dodge the cameras.

1030
01:59:02,601 --> 01:59:08,904
lf anybody touches the showcase -
all alarms will start ringing.

1031
01:59:21,954 --> 01:59:23,922
Did you see the function of alarms.

1032
01:59:24,957 --> 01:59:29,962
Guards, don't worry. This was a
demonstration.

1033
01:59:29,962 --> 01:59:33,921
lnspection of security.
No need to worry.

1034
01:59:42,975 --> 01:59:47,980
Similarly, if anybody picks up the
diamond, the alarms will go on.

1035
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:51,984
A strong light will be beamed
from here to that cage above.

1036
01:59:51,984 --> 01:59:54,987
And the cage will fall on
the head of the thief.

1037
01:59:54,987 --> 01:59:59,947
Oh, if the cage falls the thief
will become an omelet.

1038
02:00:00,993 --> 02:00:04,997
There is a spot in the diamond.
- So what?

1039
02:00:04,997 --> 02:00:06,999
There is a cut in the diamond.

1040
02:00:06,999 --> 02:00:11,003
Cut in the diamond ! What do you
say? Want to give me heart attack.

1041
02:00:11,003 --> 02:00:13,972
Can't you see cut in the diamond?
- What? What are you talking?

1042
02:00:15,674 --> 02:00:16,971
Can't you see cut in the diamond?

1043
02:00:22,014 --> 02:00:24,983
Put your head above diamond.
- Face and diamond on same level.

1044
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:31,990
Now l'll slowly move the diamond.

1045
02:00:33,692 --> 02:00:36,028
Relax. A demonstration is in
progress inside.

1046
02:00:36,028 --> 02:00:38,030
Don't move your head.
- Why?

1047
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:43,035
lf you move, a light beam will
strike the cage above.

1048
02:00:43,035 --> 02:00:45,037
And the cage will come down.

1049
02:00:45,037 --> 02:00:48,040
Then your head will become
a half-fried omelet.

1050
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:51,999
That's what l told you.
Oh why did you get me caught here.

1051
02:01:03,722 --> 02:01:07,059
What a shameful act. You've
brought shame to police department.

1052
02:01:07,059 --> 02:01:11,063
l sent you for security of diamond.
And you have stolen it.

1053
02:01:11,063 --> 02:01:14,066
Sir, it's false allegation.
We were on duty outside.

1054
02:01:14,066 --> 02:01:16,068
How can we go in to steal it.

1055
02:01:16,068 --> 02:01:19,037
Perhaps you don't know that there
were cameras inside.

1056
02:01:20,072 --> 02:01:24,076
And your idiotic faces have come
in cameras when you were stealing.

1057
02:01:24,076 --> 02:01:26,078
How can this happen, sir.
Why don't you believe us.

1058
02:01:26,078 --> 02:01:28,080
Sir, we have not stolen.

1059
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:32,084
No, you didn't steal.
Your ghosts came to steal it.

1060
02:01:32,084 --> 02:01:37,089
Until today l've forgiven your
small and big mistakes.

1061
02:01:37,089 --> 02:01:41,093
l covered them. But today's
mistake can't be forgiven.

1062
02:01:41,093 --> 02:01:45,097
You must be punished.
l suspend you.

1063
02:01:45,097 --> 02:01:48,066
Until the diamond is found
you will remain in jail.

1064
02:02:04,116 --> 02:02:07,119
Why did you call so early.
We rushed without taking bath.

1065
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:11,123
We know the museum is open.
We'll steal and give you diamond.

1066
02:02:11,123 --> 02:02:14,126
lt has already been stolen.
- What?

1067
02:02:14,126 --> 02:02:17,095
Yes. That's why l tell
you to read the newspaper.

1068
02:02:18,130 --> 02:02:20,132
This is Mulayam's picture.

1069
02:02:20,132 --> 02:02:23,101
Pyare Mohan and Arjun Singh.

1070
02:02:25,137 --> 02:02:27,139
Good. They have done our job.

1071
02:02:27,139 --> 02:02:33,100
We fear police but not so much that
we can't get diamond from them.

1072
02:02:39,151 --> 02:02:44,156
Who are you?
- l don't know my own identity.

1073
02:02:44,156 --> 02:02:47,826
Your brother has caused
to much trouble for me.

1074
02:02:47,826 --> 02:02:51,163
Out of fear l can neither sit
at home nor walk on streets.

1075
02:02:51,163 --> 02:02:54,132
So l've taken shelter
in your car.

1076
02:02:55,167 --> 02:02:57,795
l'm sure you'll save me from
your brother. Won't you?

1077
02:03:00,172 --> 02:03:05,804
Good kids are never obstinate.
- Move inside.

1078
02:03:07,179 --> 02:03:10,182
lf my brother comes to know,
he will take you to task.

1079
02:03:10,182 --> 02:03:13,151
We want your brother to know.

1080
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:24,158
Do you want to get me killed.
Come over here.

1081
02:03:25,197 --> 02:03:28,166
This is not a diamond !
This is a bomb !

1082
02:03:30,202 --> 02:03:33,205
lf you help us sell -
we will get some money.

1083
02:03:33,205 --> 02:03:37,209
Entire Thieves Bazaar will be
sold out but not this diamond.

1084
02:03:37,209 --> 02:03:39,177
Why? What is its value.
- Crores.

1085
02:03:41,213 --> 02:03:47,219
l like this diamond.
Have it cut. l want a ring.

1086
02:03:47,219 --> 02:03:52,224
Have you gone crazy. Where to
sell. Give some idea.

1087
02:03:52,224 --> 02:03:59,231
l know a man. Outwardly he is
an sculptor.

1088
02:03:59,231 --> 02:04:03,235
He buys stolen goods at
international level.

1089
02:04:03,235 --> 02:04:06,204
His name is Zorawar.
Only he can give its price.

1090
02:04:19,251 --> 02:04:23,255
You got your diamond -
give us our money.

1091
02:04:23,255 --> 02:04:25,257
That too in cash and quickly.
We got to move from here.

1092
02:04:25,257 --> 02:04:28,260
l got the diamond.
Where is the heroine?

1093
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:30,929
Which heroine.
- Heroine. Neha !

1094
02:04:30,929 --> 02:04:34,266
What nonsense. We don't know Neha.
- You mean, Neha isn't with you?

1095
02:04:34,266 --> 02:04:36,234
When we said we don't know -
means we don't know.

1096
02:04:37,936 --> 02:04:40,234
Bring out the baby.

1097
02:04:41,273 --> 02:04:46,278
Brother !
- Brother !

1098
02:04:46,278 --> 02:04:50,282
Did you recognize?
- Face looks familiar.

1099
02:04:50,282 --> 02:04:52,951
She is inspector's sister.

1100
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:54,919
Brother, save me.

1101
02:04:55,287 --> 02:04:59,246
Look mister. She is neither my
sister, nor l'm her brother.

1102
02:04:59,958 --> 02:05:03,295
You mean this girl isn't
your sister.

1103
02:05:03,295 --> 02:05:05,263
How many times do l have
to say this.

1104
02:05:06,298 --> 02:05:08,633
ls this man your boss?
- Yes

1105
02:05:08,633 --> 02:05:13,305
ls he idiot, blind or deaf?
- Can't hear, understand or see !

1106
02:05:13,305 --> 02:05:17,309
See. Even your brothers don't
care about your modesty.

1107
02:05:17,309 --> 02:05:21,268
Don't blame me.
Do it.

1108
02:05:36,328 --> 02:05:38,296
She is our sister.

1109
02:05:38,997 --> 02:05:45,300
We are bringing Neha.
But don't do anything to Neha.

1110
02:05:57,349 --> 02:06:00,318
Welcome. So you got the
real culprit.

1111
02:06:01,353 --> 02:06:04,356
We knew sir that someday
you'll repent for your action.

1112
02:06:04,356 --> 02:06:06,358
You look very disturbed.

1113
02:06:06,358 --> 02:06:11,318
Neither l got the real culprit -
nor do l repent.

1114
02:06:12,364 --> 02:06:14,366
l've come to tell you
that your sister Seema ...

1115
02:06:14,366 --> 02:06:17,335
What happened to Seema ?
- What has happened to Seema, sir?

1116
02:06:18,370 --> 02:06:20,338
Somebody has kidnapped Seema.
- What ... ?

1117
02:06:22,374 --> 02:06:25,043
Please, sir free me from
here for one day.

1118
02:06:25,043 --> 02:06:27,045
After finding Seema we shall
put ourselves in your hands.

1119
02:06:27,045 --> 02:06:31,383
l'm worried about Seema too.
She is like my own daughter.

1120
02:06:31,383 --> 02:06:34,386
l've notified all police stations
and blocked all roads.

1121
02:06:34,386 --> 02:06:36,388
No harm will be done to Seema.

1122
02:06:36,388 --> 02:06:40,058
But sir, who're the kidnappers -
what do they want?

1123
02:06:40,058 --> 02:06:44,017
What if something happens to Seema.
- Nothing will happen to Seema.

1124
02:06:57,075 --> 02:07:03,378
Hey baldly. Why these dry hiccups?
lf you can't see - open second eye.

1125
02:07:09,421 --> 02:07:12,424
Haven't you seen Ram aur Shyam with
Dilip Kumar in double roll.

1126
02:07:12,424 --> 02:07:15,393
We too saw for first time
in your home.

1127
02:07:38,450 --> 02:07:43,455
Whatever bad has happened in your
life - we were behind that.

1128
02:07:43,455 --> 02:07:47,459
We stole the diamond too.
- Where is the diamond?

1129
02:07:47,459 --> 02:07:49,461
We came out by giving them
the diamond.

1130
02:07:49,461 --> 02:07:52,430
Now they want Neha to
release Seema.

1131
02:07:53,465 --> 02:07:57,469
Did you have any twin brothers?
- No sir.

1132
02:07:57,469 --> 02:07:59,471
Lost in childhood.
- No sir.

1133
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:02,474
Lost in a fair.
- Absolutely not.

1134
02:08:02,474 --> 02:08:06,478
Where have they come from.
- By grace of God, on public demand

1135
02:08:06,478 --> 02:08:09,447
Your good luck has sent
us to release your sister.

1136
02:08:10,482 --> 02:08:18,490
This is Zorawar's hideout.
We'll come dancing from stairs here

1137
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:23,450
We'll keep them entertained.
You feed them some intoxicants.

1138
02:08:25,497 --> 02:08:32,460
When shall we enter?
-When we finish singing we'll say ...

1139
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:40,512
You enter by breaking
this glass window.

1140
02:08:40,512 --> 02:08:45,472
Look. l too will come with you.
What if you run away.

1141
02:08:46,518 --> 02:08:49,521
We are helping and this baldly
uncle is doubting us.

1142
02:08:49,521 --> 02:08:52,524
We won't help you.
Better catch them alone.

1143
02:08:52,524 --> 02:08:54,492
Wait a minute. Don't mind. Sit.

1144
02:08:55,527 --> 02:09:01,159
lf you sing and dance -
l too would like to sing and dance.

1145
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:05,169
Please take me ...

1146
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:11,509
Hey brother. Do you remember
when you have to enter.

1147
02:14:35,867 --> 02:14:37,835
They were to enter at this point.
- Haven't come.

1148
02:14:39,871 --> 02:14:41,839
l told you don't trust them.

1149
02:14:42,874 --> 02:14:47,834
Start singing. He's coming.
- Clear up your throat.

1150
02:15:09,233 --> 02:15:11,903
You dance quite well.
Do you think we are stupid.

1151
02:15:11,903 --> 02:15:16,908
You thought we will be down
with tiny bit of drugs.

1152
02:15:16,908 --> 02:15:19,877
This much we normally
eat with our breakfast.

1153
02:15:23,915 --> 02:15:28,875
No one else will dance.
Now only these two will dance.

1154
02:17:36,047 --> 02:17:40,051
You think you're Mughal-e-Azam
and we are Anarkali.

1155
02:17:40,051 --> 02:17:42,053
How much can we dance.

1156
02:17:42,053 --> 02:17:46,012
lf you like we'll come to dance
everyday - morning and evening.

1157
02:17:47,058 --> 02:17:48,059
But let us go now.

1158
02:17:48,059 --> 02:17:50,061
Start dancing else
l'll put the bullet in you.

1159
02:17:50,061 --> 02:17:54,065
lt is wrong. ln olden times dancers
were rewarded with gold and silver...

1160
02:17:54,065 --> 02:17:57,034
You're showing us gun -
so we won't dance.

1161
02:17:59,070 --> 02:18:05,076
You've done enough. Let's go
respectfully soon, else ...

1162
02:18:05,076 --> 02:18:07,078
Otherwise what will you do?

1163
02:18:07,078 --> 02:18:09,046
What will we do ... !
We will dance.

1164
02:18:36,107 --> 02:18:40,111
You did typically like policemen.
Why don't you ever come in time?

1165
02:18:40,111 --> 02:18:45,116
We almost died dance. Had you
delayed more you'd see dead bodies.

1166
02:18:45,116 --> 02:18:48,119
You didn't die.
We came before that.

1167
02:18:48,119 --> 02:18:50,121
Why do you come in end? Why not
early. You always come in end.

1168
02:18:50,121 --> 02:18:55,126
And you're talking as if you
have obliged us by coming.

1169
02:18:55,126 --> 02:18:57,128
Let them go. We aren't going
to spend all life with them.

1170
02:18:57,128 --> 02:19:02,088
We're going. Forgive our
misbehavior. Goodbye.

1171
02:19:10,141 --> 02:19:14,100
Hey! Why are you ogling your eyes.
They are thieves, we're policemen.

1172
02:19:19,817 --> 02:19:23,154
Don't be surprised. He is not your
man. That's over there.

1173
02:19:23,154 --> 02:19:26,157
That day you picked me from the
jeweler's shop.

1174
02:19:26,157 --> 02:19:32,163
And then after the cake in your
home, the food, the dance ...

1175
02:19:32,163 --> 02:19:35,166
Now how can l thank you.

1176
02:19:35,166 --> 02:19:37,168
You were not my brother -
yet you saved my life.

1177
02:19:37,168 --> 02:19:39,170
Why are you embarrassing me.

1178
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:41,172
ln fact we've nobody in this world.

1179
02:19:41,172 --> 02:19:44,175
That day when you affectionately
called me as your brother ...

1180
02:19:44,175 --> 02:19:47,178
My heart felt music of many strings

1181
02:19:47,178 --> 02:19:50,147
So l felt l must help you.

1182
02:19:50,848 --> 02:19:54,147
ln fact we did good deeds in
confusion. We aren't really good.

1183
02:20:06,197 --> 02:20:08,199
Why is our van going separate
way from others?

1184
02:20:08,199 --> 02:20:11,168
Are we being taken to
some special jail.

1185
02:20:30,221 --> 02:20:32,556
What happened.
Why did you stop the van.

1186
02:20:32,556 --> 02:20:34,892
There are two dead bodies ahead.

1187
02:20:34,892 --> 02:20:40,231
We aren't dead bodies.
We got tired waiting.

1188
02:20:40,231 --> 02:20:46,192
Just give us a ride
to the railway station.

1189
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:53,199
Doesn't the man standing inside
look like Zorawar.

1190
02:20:54,245 --> 02:20:58,204
He is actually Zorawar. Shameless
man has again cheated the police.

1191
02:20:59,250 --> 02:21:01,218
He is always coming in our way.

1192
02:21:32,283 --> 02:21:35,286
Those who like to be punched -
come to me.

1193
02:21:35,286 --> 02:21:38,255
Those who prefer to be kicked
go to him.

1194
02:22:41,352 --> 02:22:46,312
Did you play with him.
Now come, play with me.

1195
02:24:22,453 --> 02:24:24,455
Do you remember faintly?
- Yes l remember.

1196
02:24:24,455 --> 02:24:27,424
These bastards had made
us dance too much.

1197
02:24:28,459 --> 02:24:31,428
Now we'll be Mughal-e-Azam
- and they'll be Anarkali.

1198
02:25:10,501 --> 02:25:12,503
So everybody has been caught.

1199
02:25:12,503 --> 02:25:15,506
But the real criminal you took army
to catch is missing.

1200
02:25:15,506 --> 02:25:18,175
Sir, we had locked him in the van.

1201
02:25:18,175 --> 02:25:20,177
lf you had locked him in the van
then how did he get out.

1202
02:25:20,177 --> 02:25:23,514
Sir, you got the diamond.
- So should l leave real criminal.

1203
02:25:23,514 --> 02:25:25,516
l don't how did Zorawar vanish.

1204
02:25:25,516 --> 02:25:27,484
Here is Zorawar.

1205
02:25:31,522 --> 02:25:33,490
But where are you people going?

1206
02:25:34,525 --> 02:25:39,530
lndia is a big country.
We'll do our business elsewhere.

1207
02:25:39,530 --> 02:25:41,532
What if l make arrangement
for your livelihood.

1208
02:25:41,532 --> 02:25:44,535
ls he proposing to
take us into the jail?

1209
02:25:44,535 --> 02:25:48,539
God has blessed you with good mind
which you use for stealing.

1210
02:25:48,539 --> 02:25:51,542
Use that brain for serving the
country and the law.

1211
02:25:51,542 --> 02:25:53,510
Will you work for the police?

1212
02:26:00,551 --> 02:26:02,519
Where are you going?

1213
02:26:05,556 --> 02:26:08,559
As a policeman you're
showing hand to policemen.

1214
02:26:08,559 --> 02:26:10,527
Sorry sir, we made mistake.

1215
02:26:13,564 --> 02:26:18,569
These two look familiar.
- Yes. Who are you.

1216
02:26:18,569 --> 02:26:23,574
The van you're moving in
used to be our van.

1217
02:26:23,574 --> 02:26:26,543
And the uniform you are wearing
used to be on our bodies.

1218
02:26:27,578 --> 02:26:30,581
Why are they talking so
insultingly with us.

1219
02:26:30,581 --> 02:26:34,585
Haven't you learnt manners
to talk with your officers?

1220
02:26:34,585 --> 02:26:37,554
lf you talk like this again l'll
make you run naked in the desert.

1221
02:26:38,589 --> 02:26:44,550
And remember. We're very hard.
Never say no to us.
