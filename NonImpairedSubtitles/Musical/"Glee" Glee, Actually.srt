4
00:00:04,077 --> 00:00:06,045
<i>that time of year</i>
<i>when parents aren't arrested</i>

5
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:07,513
<i>for forcing their children to sit</i>

7
00:00:10,283 --> 00:00:14,653
<i>That magical season when five</i>
<i>seemingly separate storylines</i>

8

<i>between commercial breaks,</i>

10

Whoa, wh-wh-what
happened to your face?

I fell, okay?

18
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,349
The stupid janitor didn't
put salt on the ramp,

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,590
like he's supposed to, and
my wheels don't have chains,

20
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:04,470
so I slipped backwards and
tipped over on the ice.

21
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:05,738
It's fine. It's nothing.

No, no, no, no...

That's not nothing.

00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:26,892

up on the cot? No.

I don't want anybody
to help me with anything.

I'm tired of everybody pitying me,

Anyone could have fallen
on the ice, all right?

36
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:38,196
Yeah, but they could've gotten back up,

37
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:39,917
instead of laying there
screaming for help

This is Coach Sue's craft room.

141

Well, in an alternate universe,
it was the choir room.

142
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,514
I had a dream about that once.
I know.

143
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:17,582
And it was a place that
always made me feel safe.

144
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:19,785
And I know it did
for a lot of you, too.

145
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:22,254
That's 'cause we danced
together, we sang together,

146
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:23,455
we took turns up here.

147

Like Finn said,

148
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:25,857
it's about the love of the music.

180
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,887
That was so gay.

181
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:03,054
(school bell ringing)

182
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:05,724
(sewing machines whirring)

183
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:20,071
Is that mine?

184
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,306
No.

185
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,974
It's Quinn's.

186
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,489
Without the encouragement and support

187
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,844
from you and her friends in Glee,

188
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:27,212
Quinn was never able to walk again

189
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:28,980
after her accident.

190
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,882
Wait a minute,
if there was no Glee Club,

191
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,385
there was no Finchel wedding
for her to drive to, so...

192
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,687
Quinn texts and drives
in every timeline, Artie.

193
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:39,724
Okay.
Why isn't she in it?

194
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,426
She died.

195
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:45,096
How?

196
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,032
Of a broken heart.

197
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:52,137
Much like her body,
her spirit never recovered.

198
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,275
FINN (echoing):
<i>Come on, dude, you mom's here.</i>

199
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,505
(sighs)

200
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:30,642
You know, I could use some help here.

201
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:36,114
Come on, grab onto me.

202
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:38,416
(Finn grunts)

203
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,752
Sorry, Artie.

204
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:44,623
I know it really sucks being
in this chair sometimes.

205
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:47,325
For better or for worse,
this chair is a part of me.

206
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,361
It's made me who I am.

207
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,646
Well, if you're not
going to come to Lima,

208
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,681
then my dads and I
insist you come with us

209
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:02,883
to the Rosie O'Donnell
Gay Holiday Cruise.

210
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,085
It's going to be so much fun.

211
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,093
There's even going to be

212
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:06,854
a Jessie Tyler Ferguson
look-alike contest.

213
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:08,222
(gasps) Well, in that case,

214
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:09,757
I'm definitely gonna have to pass.

215
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,972
Honey, uh...
And besides,

216
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,893
there's really no reason
to go to Lima, anyway.

217
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:14,436
My dad and Finn and Carole

218
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:16,197
are visiting Carole's
sister in Zanesville,

219
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,238
and she always has too much
eggnog and blacks out.

220
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,839
Happy holidays!

221
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,167
Well, what about Blaine?

222
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,203
I talk to him.

223
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:23,671
But, you know, he knows

224
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,406
that I'm saving my money for NYADA now.

225
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,560
And it'll be good to just
have some time for myself,

226
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,510
you know, and think about things and...

227
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:30,878
(knocking on door)

228
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,279
Can you get that?

229
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:34,281
RACHEL: Okay, what do we
need for this tree?

230
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:36,283
It's just hopeless...

231
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:39,086
Um...

232
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,354
Dad!

233
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:41,522
(Burt laughing)

234
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:42,590
Burt?

235
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:44,225
Season's greetings!

236
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,459
Oh, my God!

237
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:46,934
Well, I got a tree...
you need one?

238
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:48,028
Come in!

239
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:49,763
Okay, all right.
I got it, I got it.

240
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:50,798
(gasping, laughing)

241
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,802
Okay, you can let go now.

242
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:56,103
RACHEL:
Okay.

243
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:57,605
Come on, let's go look at it.

244
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:01,775
RACHEL (gasps):
Oh, it's perfect.

245
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,370
Yeah, well, I couldn't imagine you guys

246
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,091
celebrating Christmas
without a real tree.

247
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,548
You know, his mom used
to always buy the tree.

248
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:08,942
I'd always tell her to wait till I

249
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:10,583
got home from work,
but she never could.

250
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,887
And then, the first Christmas
after his mom died,

251
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,322
I totally forgot about it.

252
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:17,091
That is, until

253
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,492
I saw little Kurt

254
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:19,994
hanging his own special version

255
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,295
of a Christmas ornament

256
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:23,330
on his window shade Christmas Eve.

257
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:24,999
Oh.

258
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:27,268
My mom's perfume bottle.

259
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:28,936
Oh, I always loved the way she smelled.

260
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,638
BURT: So I pull
him out of bed,

261
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:31,859
I throw a coat on him,

262
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,340
I drive straight through a snowstorm,

263
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,109
right down to the Christmas tree sale.

264
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:39,513
It was the first time he
smiled since his mom died.

265
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:44,418
Okay, no tears on Christmas Eve.

266
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:46,787
This box is full
of happy memories, as well.

267
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,522
Like our Christmas trip to Dollywood.

268
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:50,024
Oh, yeah.
That one I like.

269
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:51,158
That trip was for me.

270
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:52,927
Oh, and this redneck NASCAR trip,

271
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:55,429
that was for you. Hey,
this is a nice ornament.

272
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,164
Let's hang them.

273
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,466
All right, well, I wish I could stay,

274
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,835
but can't really be late
for a cruise, so...

275
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,830
Oh, hold on. You got to
open this before you go.

276
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,240
Uh, happy Hanukkah, merry Christmas.

277
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,310
Oh...

278
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:12,379
It's for your first
New York holiday season.

279
00:12:12,414 --> 00:12:13,981
Hang it together.
Thank you.

280
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,816
And then you can go.
Okay.

281
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,218
Aw.

282
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:20,154
Kurt, okay, this, to our very first.

283
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,156
New York Christmas.

284
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,060
KURT: Ha. I never thought
I'd see this day.

285
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:27,995
Us walking down the
streets of New York,

286
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,130
right after seeing a
live Broadway musical.

287
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:32,399
Well, the Rockettes
might have better legs than me,

288
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:34,668
but they can't touch
my "Single Ladies" performance.

289
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,637
That was the best
musical I've ever seen.

290
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:37,905
Ah, it's freezing!

291
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,907
I think it's time to check off another.

292
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:43,544
Hummel family tradition:
Hot chocolate.

293
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,017
Kurt, I have something to tell you,

294
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,999
and I came here
because it's the kind of thing

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,320
I want to tell you
face-to-face.

296
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,515
Don't like the sound of that.

297
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:56,023
Look, I'm just going to

298
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:58,025
come out and say it
because there's no...

299
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,727
good way to say it.

300
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:02,896
Uh, I have prostate cancer.

301
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,201
(sighs)

302
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:09,436
Feel like I'm going to be sick.

303
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:10,704
No, no, hey, hey, look at me.

304
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,072
Do I look like a guy who's dying?

305
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:13,540
We caught it early.

306
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,010
You know, local stage, no spreading.

307
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:18,212
Cure rate's nearly 100%.

308
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:20,247
For healthy people, Dad.

309
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:21,642
You've already had a heart attack.

310
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,083
The heart attack is what, you know,

311
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:26,120
made me get checkups twice a year.

312
00:13:26,154 --> 00:13:29,256
It's just really scary to think

313
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:33,560
that when I finally reach my destiny,

314
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,896
that you won't be around to see it.

315
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,964
Hey.

316
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,933
I will be there.

317
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:42,069
I promise.

318
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:48,909
Look, can I just give you
one piece of advice

319
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:52,046
while we're still talking
father to son?

320
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,949
This is three times I've had
to stare death in the eye.

321
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:58,552
And you know the one thing
I took away from all that?

322
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:00,421
You have got to hold
the people you love

323
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:01,955
close to you no matter what.

324
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:12,800
Dad, you okay?

325
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:15,569
Do you need a pillow or tea, water?

326
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:16,837
No, Kurt, stop.

327
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:19,340
Come on, let's focus on happy things.

328
00:14:19,374 --> 00:14:21,842
Like our Christmas traditions.

329
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:25,446
I am looking forward to watching
basketball on Christmas Day

330
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,948
while you pretend you watch with me.

331
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,917
You mean while I secretly read <i>Vogue?</i>

332
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,352
That was never a secret.

333
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:33,520
No, like our other
Christmas traditions.

334
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:36,256
Like on Christmas Eve,
where we each exchange one gift.

335
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,025
My favorite part.

336
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,360
All right, you first.

337
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:41,295
Ah, I saw that.

338
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,798
(laughs) Nice.

339
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,713
I know it's cheesy, but
thought you'd like it.

340
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:48,602
Screw cheesy. I love it.

341
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:51,338
In <i>México,</i> they would
call me Señor Queso.

342
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,474
Look at this. Ah, man.

343
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:55,309
I love it, man.

344
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:57,711
You are going to kick ass
at that school.

345
00:14:57,746 --> 00:15:00,547
That's the plan.

346
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:02,383
All right, my turn.

347
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,152
Okay, so my gift to you is really big.

348
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:06,854
It's too big to put under the tree.

349
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:08,288
Curiosity piqued.

350
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:11,024
Okay, so you can pick it up
at this address,

351
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:13,227
and, you know, if you don't like it,

352
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:14,695
you can return it.

353
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,474
Package for Kurt Hummel.

354
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,243
Blaine?

355
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:30,544
Surprise.

356
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:31,938
Your dad called me out of the blue

357
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:33,147
and wanted to fly me out here

358
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,681
just so I can see that look

359
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,650
on your face, and it's
pretty priceless.

360
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:38,485
Actually, he told me everything,

361
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,921
and I promise, I'll keep
an eye on him for you.

362
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:43,323
But the reason why I'm here

363
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,692
is because he didn't
want us to miss out

364
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,561
on another important holiday tradition.

365
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:50,397
Our Christmas duet?

366
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,600
You are happy to see me, right?

367
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:57,004
Yeah, yeah. Always.

368
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,939
Come on.
Get your skates on.

369
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,607
It's almost midnight.
Hurry up!

(bell tolling)

393

Listen. Hey.

394
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:39,640
It's midnight.

395
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:41,441
It's Christmas.

396
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:42,843
Officially.

397

Oh, hey, Puckerman, yo.

402
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:06,616
You going African,

403
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:08,285
or are you more Hebrew
for the holidays?

404
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,919
Yeah, Hanukkah or Kwanzaa?
Which is it?

405
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,088
Kwanukkah!

406
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:13,123
(grunting)

(grunting)

409
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,596
Hey! One Puckerman
just ate your lunch.

410
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,798
What do you think's going
to happen when we unload

411
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,600
two barrels of Puckshot
into your ugly mugs?

412
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,535
Huh?

413
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,040
What are you looking at?

414
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,976
What are you doing here?

415
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,171
Just scoping out some chicks,

416
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:35,892
doing a little research
for my screenplay.

417
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:38,015
You're a screenwriter now?

418
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,177
In L.A., you're nobody

419
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:41,018
unless you're somebody
in the movie business.

420
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:42,753
I'm almost done with my first script.

421
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,422
It's sci-fi, but it has
a high school element.

422
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:48,125
Wow. That sounds
really cool, actually.

423
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,060
Well, if me being totally honest,

424
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:52,195
I also came back to talk to you.

425
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,164
I'm worried about you, dude.

426
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,566
Well, I'm fine.

427
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,969
Fine doesn't get into
fights in the hallway.

428
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:01,443
Think what you need is a little
mentoring from your big bro.

429
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,244
Come spend a few days
in La La Land with me.

430
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:04,325
Let's do Hanukkah together.

431
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:06,246
All you need is some cash
for gas and burritos.

432
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:08,211
My hog has a sweet sidecar.

433
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:09,913
Wait.

434
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:12,182
You... you want me to ride

435
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,651
all the way to California in a sidecar?

436
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:15,965
Where's your sense of adventure?

437
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:19,256
(school bell ringing)

438
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:30,734
Noah Puckerman.

439
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,436
There should be a
drive-on for us.

440
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,671
That's what they call
a pass that you get

441
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,740
when you're allowed
to drive on to the lot.

442
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,942
It's a technical term.

443
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,115
So, who's your meeting with?

444
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:46,917
Is it about your screenplay?

445
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,785
I'm just here networking today.

446
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,120
Played with the sweater puppies

447
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:52,289
of one of the assistants
of one of the guys

448
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:54,791
who produces one of the <i>NCISes,</i>
and she got me the pass.

449
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,794
Wow. You really are
making things happen.

450
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,429
It was inevitable.

451
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,731
If you're in Hollywood
and you're a Jew or a gay,

452
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:04,468
you basically got it made.

453
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,303
What are you doing?

454
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:08,038
I told you... networking.

455
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:10,974
We need to let all the
bigwigs here know who we are.

456
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:13,276
Or, more specifically, what we are.

Happy Hanukkah!

489
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,424
JAKE:
I can't believe

490
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,059
that this is where you live.

491
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:10,594
PUCK:
No, I'm just renting.

492
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:13,096
I think if I buy,
I'd want to be up in the hills.

493
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,365
One of those houses they shoot porn in.

494
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:17,234
Excuse me.

495
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:20,170
Aren't you the guy who cleans our pool?

496
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:21,705
Yeah, Mrs. Cross, hey.

497
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,499
I thought you were
in Hawaii for Christmas.

498
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,674
Yeah, we came back early.

499
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,344
You have five minutes
till I call the police.

500
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:28,968
Dude, why did you lie to me?

501
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:30,969
I didn't think you'd be
impressed by my apartment

502
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,610
in the Valley
filled with Ikea furniture

503
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:34,251
I never figured out
how to put together.

504
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,692
So all that screenwriter stuff...
is that just garbage, too?

505
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,533
Figured it was my only chance
to convince you

506
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:39,734
to come move out here with me.

507
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:40,575
I'm a sophomore, man.

508
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:41,776
I mean, I had to lie to my mom

509
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,017
and tell her I was going on
vacation in Fort Lauderdale

510
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:46,298
with Ryder and his family
just to get out here for this.

511
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,864
I'm a mess out here, dude.

512
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:49,633
It's lonely.
I've got no friends.

513
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,067
It's impossible to meet people

514
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:53,069
'cause you spend
the whole day in your car.

515
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:54,738
Why didn't you just tell me that?

516
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:56,039
We are family.

517
00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:57,374
I mean, I would've understood.

518
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:59,376
That your big brother is a loser?

519
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,244
Let's go back to Lima.

520
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,539
If we leave this afternoon,

521
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,980
we'll make it back by Christmas Eve.

522
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,448
If I go back, my mom's gonna make me

523
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:07,209
go to Breadstix
for dinner on Christmas Day

524
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,370
while my sister hangs out
with her Christian friends.

525
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:10,620
Cool. I'll go, too.

526
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,756
And I'll invite my mom.

527
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,724
My mom hates your mom.

528
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,893
Your mom hasn't ever even met my mom.

529
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:19,562
You feel lonely, you want
this feeling of family.

530
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:23,500
Fine, then let's you and
I... we'll make it happen.

531
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:38,581
Thanks.

532
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,116
How great is this lasagna?

533
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,584
I saw you once, you know.

534
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:43,520
I came into that diner
you were working at

535
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:45,088
after he told me about you.

536
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:46,856
You waited on me.

537
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:48,825
Acted like you had no idea who I was.

538
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:51,494
I didn't.

539
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,163
He never told me he was married.

540
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,365
He did not wear his ring
when we were together.

541
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,119
Is that how you make
yourself feel better?

542
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,435
Stop it.

543
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:00,103
He split on both of you.

544
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:01,937
You spent all these years
hating each other,

545
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:03,218
keeping me and my brother apart,

546
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:04,174
and for what?

547
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,342
To spite some jerk

548
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,177
who never loved any of us?

549
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:08,345
Puck's right.

550
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:09,813
We all have one thing in common:

551
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,314
He ran out on all of us.

552
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,550
This week with Puck was...

553
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:14,951
ridiculous,

554
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:16,186
but it felt different

555
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,854
than being with a friend.

556
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,858
We're a family. Okay?

557
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:25,829
A pretty messed up one,
but still a family.

558
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,501
Your father really was an ass.

559
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:33,069
An epic ass.
(Jake chuckles)

560
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,371
So let's drink a toast.

561
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:35,705
Yes, let's.

562
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,741
To the power of the holidays,

563
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:42,178
to new traditions and to an epic ass

564
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:45,315
that did one thing right:

565
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:46,750
He brought us together.

566
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:48,618
Cheers.
Cheers.

567
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:51,154
Merry Hanukkah, dude.

568
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,623
Right back at you, bro.

569
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:00,244
(school bell ringing)

570
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,748
Hi, Marley.

571
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:05,783
Here's a Rolex.
Merry Christmas.

572
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:11,322
Hi, Ryder.

573
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:14,258
Here's a three-week vacation
to Saint-Tropez.

574
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:16,294
What?
Enjoy.

575
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:19,864
Boop.

576
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:21,565
What's this?

577
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,002
Those are the keys to your
brand-new 2013 Toyota Camry.

578
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:27,705
Brittany, what are you doing?

579
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:29,907
Um, well, last week, I decided to watch

580
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:31,842
a documentary about
the Mayan Apocalypse,

581
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:34,512
which arrives on December 21, 2012.

582
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:37,448
So I decided to cash in all
my savings so my friends and I

583
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:40,084
could enjoy what's left
of our lives to the fullest.

584
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:41,719
Enjoy.

585
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:43,087
Merry Christmas, everybody.

586
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,122
(school bell ringing)

587
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,060
Hey, Brittany.

588
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:50,261
Um, can I ask you a question?

589
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:51,696
Yeah, not if you're gonna tell me

590
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,531
that the Mayan Apocalypse isn't real.

591
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,999
'Cause the documentary I watched
was on the History Channel,

592
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,840
involving real actors
portraying real events.

593
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:58,281
No, listen.

594
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,972
I believe it, too.

595
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:02,740
(school bell ringing) Fact.

596
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:04,174
2012 is the year
that Kim Il-Sung,

597
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:05,975
founder of North Korea,
would've turned 100.

598
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,856
Divide 100 by ten, the
percentage of Americans

599
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,137
that believe the world will
end on the 21st of December,

600
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:11,978
and you get ten...
Mexico's rank in the world

601
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:13,250
as a tourist destination...

602
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:15,085
whose president expects
the Mayan Apocalypse

603
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:16,887
to attract 52 million
people to his country.

604
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:18,422
It's all right there.

605
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:20,825
All anyone has to do
is look at the numbers.

606
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:23,227
I'm terrified.

607
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:25,741
And we need to purify ourselves
for the last day of b'ak'tun,

608
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:28,566
the 144,000-day cycle
of the Mayan Calendar.

609
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,468
Totally. We need to tell
everyone we know

610
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:32,003
how we really feel about them.

611
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:33,304
(school bell ringing)

612
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:35,606
You guys, welcome to the first meeting

613
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,842
of the 2012 Mayan Apocalypse Club.

614
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:39,443
Wait, that's what this is?

615
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:41,118
Don't worry,
it's also the last meeting.

616
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,639
BRITTANY:
Because we're all so close,

617
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:44,007
Sam and I wanted to bring you here

618
00:26:44,008 --> 00:26:46,328
so we could finally tell you
our true feelings about you.

619
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:46,984
Tina,

620
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:48,452
acting is a pipe dream for you,

621
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,354
and your decision
to pursue it as a career

622
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:52,089
is both irresponsible and shocking.

623
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:54,692
Joe, you haven't really made
much of an impression on me,

624
00:26:54,726 --> 00:26:56,861
and I don't really know
what your deal is.

625
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:59,130
Wait a second.
This is the worst club ever.

626
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:01,632
We're not gonna just sit here
and let you insult us.

627
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,746
I wasn't gonna insult you;
All I wanted to tell you

628
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,147
was that I think you're delightful.

629
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:07,548
Guys, you can't leave yet;
You're gonna miss the best part!

630
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:08,869
Okay, merry Christmas to you two.

631
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,910
Guys, we're not even gonna

632
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:12,276
make it to Christmas!

633
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,944
I can't believe how naive they are.

634
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,446
I know.

635
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,648
Some people just can't face
the cold, hard fact

636
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:20,451
that this earth is really just
the back of a giant crocodile

637
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:22,820
that's destroyed and
recreated every 500 years.

638
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:24,655
Well, at least we have each other.

639
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:26,791
Yeah.

640
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,865
And since the world
is gonna end before Christmas,

641
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:31,362
in the meantime, this will have to do.

Whoo!

673
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:12,496
Yes!

674
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:14,532
And here's another rock.

675
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:17,735
Brittany,

676
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,004
before the world ends,

677
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:22,506
will you marry me?

678
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,422
(school bell ringing)

679
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:26,143
Are you sure you're
qualified to marry us?

680
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:27,645
You betcha, kiddo.

681
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,647
I went on a Mayan Church Web site

682
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:33,083
and I got ordained... if you're
really serious about doing this.

683
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:35,352
Yeah. I want Brittany and I
to meet Q'uq'umatz,

684
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,354
the feathered snake god, together.

685
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,124
Put your hands here.

686
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:47,164
Brittany, I've always thought
you were super hot

687
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:50,267
and really smart,

688
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:53,204
but what I didn't know was
that you were going to end up

689
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,206
being my soul mate.

690
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,308
Who knows what the future holds for us?

691
00:29:57,342 --> 00:30:01,011
Probably tsunamis
and horrible sea monsters.

692
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:05,249
But now I'm not worried
about that, because I have you.

693
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,154
Sam, when you first
joined the glee club,

694
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:13,357
I didn't notice for a while.

695
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:16,126
It wasn't until you did
a Rich Little impression

696
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:19,029
and then told me it was
a Rich Little impression

697
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:21,332
and explained who Rich Little was

698
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:24,435
that I just... I knew
you were special.

699
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,805
And I can't tell you how excited I am

700
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,506
to become your Mayan star-wife.

701
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,041
BEISTE:
You may kiss your bride.

702
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,153
It's December 18.

703
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:44,788
Three days till the end.

704
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:47,858
Let's make this time count.

705
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,831
(birds chirping)

706
00:30:57,569 --> 00:30:59,970
Brittany.

707
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,805
It's December 22.

708
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,876
We survived the Mayan Apocalypse.

709
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,778
You know what this means?

710
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:09,013
The world didn't end.

711
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:11,048
We're also married.

712
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:17,924
(school bell ringing)

713
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,893
You know, I hate to ask you something

714
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:21,461
during your midday ritual of devouring

715
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:23,663
an entire animal carcass,
so here goes nothing.

716
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:25,131
What's going on here?

717
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,801
It's the faculty and staff
Secret Santa!

718
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:30,504
And you really couldn't
swallow first, could you?

719
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:31,805
(chuckles)

720
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,474
Mmm.

721
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:35,742
Millie Rose.

722
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:37,244
Who the hell's Millie Rose?

723
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,347
She's a sweetheart.
She works in the cafeteria.

724
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:45,085
She's a big lady, and I think
her daughter's in the glee club.

725
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,720
(school bell ringing)

726
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:50,857
How about this one?

727
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:02,936
Becky, it's a beautiful
sweater from Benetton.

728
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,204
Epic fail!

729
00:32:04,238 --> 00:32:06,706
I already got one of these, Coach!

730
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,109
Get me something I don't already have!

731
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:11,344
Like what?
Like a hot date!

732
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:14,014
Or a snowmobile!

733
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,483
Oh, Becky, you're not the only
person I have to shop for.

734
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,286
I got to get something for that
hideous wad of a lunch lady,

735
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,388
who somehow was able to squeeze out

736
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:23,723
a ravishing,
golden-throated,

737
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:27,027
raven-haired beauty from
those monstrous, gaping loins.

738
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:28,728
(sighs)

739
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:31,831
What do you get the woman
who's eaten everything?

740
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,233
(school bell ringing)

741
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:36,570
Just to be clear,
no presents this year.

742
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:38,004
That money is going to a therapist

743
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,839
who specializes in eating disorders.

744
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,474
We're not playing around here.

745
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:42,576
I know, Mom.

746
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,077
I know this is serious.

747
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:47,380
I have a problem,
and I want to get better.

748
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:50,984
Besides, we don't really need anything.

749
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:52,319
Not even a tree?

750
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:54,487
Marley...

751
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,723
a tree is $50,

752
00:32:56,757 --> 00:33:00,093
and a session with
Dr. Goodsitt is $200.

753
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:03,096
I don't need to tell you that
I don't make a lot of money.

754
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,265
I will be damned if
I waste a penny of it

755
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,200
before my daughter is healthy enough

756
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:10,036
to realize what
a beautiful miracle she is.

757
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:16,042
Sorry.

758
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,445
MRS. ROSE:
If you want to give me a gift,

759
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,880
sing me something.

760
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,150

is the best Christmas gift
I have ever gotten.

771
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,206
(school bell ringing)

772
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:25,745
Well, Becky,

773
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,914
I feel absolutely horrible.

774
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:30,583
I've become selfish and spoiled,

775
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:32,752
and incredibly out of touch.

776
00:34:32,787 --> 00:34:34,120
Look at this tree.

777
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,489
Yes, it has a stark beauty all its own.

778
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:38,591
But did I really need to cut down

779
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:41,161
a 7,000-year-old
bristlecone pine

780
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:43,096
just to hang ornaments on it?

781
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,098
It just seems frivolous.

782
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:47,033
Becky, I just made a call

783
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:48,768
to a guy in the antiquities business.

784
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:52,305
He's got contacts in the
luxury toothpick market.

785
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,007
You and I are gonna sell him this tree,

786
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,809
and we're going to give the proceeds

787
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,479
to a very important cause.

788
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:01,881
(school bell ringing)

789
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,983
MRS. ROSE:
Marley? Marley!

790
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,419
Marley, get down here, sweetie.

791
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:12,158
Oh, my God.

792
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,860
I know.

793
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:15,470
Yeah, the back door was jimmied open,

794
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:17,831
I was gonna call the police,
and then I saw all this. Mom.

795
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,466
Look at this sweater.

796
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,234
It's... I think
it's from Benetton.

797
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:22,836
Oh, sweet Lord...

798
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:27,540
I am gonna pass out. Marley...
Oh, my God.

799
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,042
Marley, there's $800 here.

800
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:31,311
(laughs) Oh, my God.

801
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:33,980
Merry Christmas, Mom!

802
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:36,416
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

803
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,758
We should probably
still call the police.

804
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:49,323
ANNIE: I actually think I
knew it was really over

805
00:35:49,324 --> 00:35:51,426
when he tried to pick
up on my sister...

806
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,662
at her baby shower.

807
00:35:53,696 --> 00:35:55,931
(laughing)

808
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:58,542
Aw, look at 'em.

809
00:35:58,578 --> 00:36:01,914
Laughing, trading war
stories about us kids.

810
00:36:01,948 --> 00:36:04,083
It's a true Hanukkah miracle.

811
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:07,286
You know, I'm really gonna miss
you when you go back to L.A.

812
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:10,656
I was thinking about that.

813
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,925
I mean, I'm a screenwriter.
I can write anywhere.

814
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,561
And I'm sure most of my
pool-cleaning clients in Lima

815
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:16,862
would take me back, so...

816
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:18,197
So you're moving back home?

817
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:20,733
L.A. is great, but...

818
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:23,035
someone needs to look
after you and our moms.

819
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:27,206
So we're not actually married.

820
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,342
There aren't actually
any Mayan church Web sites.

821
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:32,244
The Mayans were wiped out 500 years ago

822
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:34,513
by the conquistadors and smallpox.

823
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:36,749
That's like chickenpox, but smaller.

824
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:39,051
Look, when I heard the two
of you were getting engaged,

825
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,786
I thought to myself,
these kids are two...

826
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,789
special kids.

827
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:46,925
The last thing we need
is another teen tragedy

828
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,560
of marrying too young,

829
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:50,683
popping out a couple kids
before you're 20

830
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:52,364
and ending up with
your faces blurred out

831
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:53,799
on an episode of <i>Cops.</i>

832
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,534
I'm happy to have more time with Sam.

833
00:36:55,568 --> 00:36:57,608
I just... I feel empty
since the world didn't end.

834
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:00,406
Yeah, like everything
was just so energized

835
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,108
for those few days, and I felt
so close to everyone, and...

836
00:37:03,143 --> 00:37:06,078
It... it was really awesome.
I just miss that feeling.

837
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,405
(imitates phone buzzing)

838
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,915
Hey, look at my phone.

839
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:13,043
Huh. I got a Google alert
about the Mayan calendar.

840
00:37:13,078 --> 00:37:14,578
It says, uh...

841
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:17,314
some archaeologist named Indiana Jones

842
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:19,283
found a new Mayan calendar today.

843
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:21,151
That's remarkable.

844
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:24,054
Dr. Jones said that the new
end of the world date

845
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:27,624
is September 27, 2014.

846
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,019
That gives us like two whole years

847
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,220
of giving love and brutal
honesty to everyone we know.

848
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:37,468
So, who's winning?

849
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:39,703
Celtics.
Celtics.

850
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,585
Okay, I tried.

851
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:56,954
Ah... 20 seconds.
Oh!

852
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:58,789
Pay up, Anderson.

853
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,924
You may have dated him,
but I raised him.

854
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,627
I know my son.

855
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,308
Aw, you couldn't have
just toughed it out

856
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:05,669
for just a few more seconds, Kurt?

857
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,830
No.
Just a few more seconds.

858
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:08,665
So... graduating...

859
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,100
Plans for the future?

860
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:11,468
Uh... well...

861
00:38:11,503 --> 00:38:13,023
I haven't talked about this with Kurt,

862
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,104
and I wouldn't do anything

863
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:15,339
to make him uncomfortable,

864
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:17,007
but I was thinking about

865
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,842
applying to NYADA.

866
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:20,744
Would that be okay?

867
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:23,714
I think that'd be great.

868
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:27,451
Me, too.

869
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:29,447
(school bell ringing, knock on door)

870
00:38:29,448 --> 00:38:31,088
Could I talk to you
for a second, Coach?

871
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:35,826
I wanted to say thank you

872
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,228
for what you did for Marley and me.

873
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:39,943
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

874
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:41,978
I had nothing to do
with the making of that film.

875
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:43,339
I bribed Becky Jackson with candy,

876
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,735
and she told me everything.

877
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:46,370
You're very generous,

878
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:49,873
but, um...
(clears throat)

879
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:54,478
I'm afraid I can't accept this money.

880
00:38:54,512 --> 00:38:56,213
Well, you and I both know

881
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:58,115
how hard it is to be a single mother.

882
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:02,153
So take the money,

883
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:04,154
and make sure that daughter
of yours gets better.

884
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:06,356
Is that understood?

885
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,158
Now, if you'll excuse me,

886
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:12,563
please sideways-step yourself
the hell out of my office.

887
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:15,966
Uh... would you come with me?

888
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:19,002
Marley wanted to say thank you, too.

889
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:20,838
Does this involve the glee club

890
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:22,906
singing a Christmas song
in the auditorium

891
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:26,376
with snow falling
on an elaborate winter scene?

892
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,847
(school bell ringing)

893
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:33,283
Yep, okay. This is exactly
what I just described.

894
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:36,687
Coach Sylvester, I wanted
to thank you for what you did.

895
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:40,057
So I called Artie, and he
helped pull all this together.

896
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:42,359
Well, it's a testament
to how little you know me

897
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:45,062
if you think this
is something I would enjoy.

898
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:47,464
