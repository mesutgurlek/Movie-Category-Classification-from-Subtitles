1
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,683
Did you close all the rear
doors?

2
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,252
How many times do I tell you
not to read when you're lying down

3
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,632
Are you listening to old songs?
- You only told me to listen.

4
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:40,639
Did I ask you to listen when you
are studying?-Why are you after me.

5
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:45,235
You will attend every marriage
but do not care for my exams.

6
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:50,681
Did I ask you? Sit and then read
- All boring wedding.

7
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,552
Can you stay back for me
at least once for today ..

8
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,384
...for the sake of my
exams?

9
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,721
That is ok.
How are the bangles?

10
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,763
You are merciless and look
just like a monkey.

11
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,765
Get this a little bit down.

12
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:12,064
- No-yeah, that is cool!,
This is for old women

13
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,673
You also got style!
- Tell me how I look?

14
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,744
Can you stay back?
I will give you Rs.20

15
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,581
Rs. 20? That's too cheap. No.
- Rs. 30?

16
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:31,181
No chance. All my girl friends
are coming today.

17
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,891
Girl friends for you?
First fasten your zip.

18
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:36,524
Girls may get scared.

19
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:46,631
Are you mad?
I'll complain to mom. Mummy...

20
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,373
Come back, I will show you.
- You jerk! Mind your business.

21
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:01,716
Don't open the door without
asking visitor's name.

22
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:09,752
There is tea in the flask.
- Won't you stay at home, dad?

23
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,894
They might fight for your absence only,
And if I too don't go, that will be worse

24
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,293
If we attend marriages, then
your marriage becomes easy

25
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,668
We will come fast
- Come..

26
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,433
Close the doors. OK?

27
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,379
Wait - What is it?
Mummy, daddy!...

28
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,345
Rupa, Give that cap
- First switch on the records

29
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,789
Will you give it or not?-No...
Switch it on and then take it

30
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,693
Rupa, give his cap.
We are getting late.

31
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,836
Please come early, dad

32
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,322
Please go slowly, sir.
- It's ok.. No problem

33
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:20,456
My wife has gone out of station.
Had a little bit extra.

34
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,602
Get into the car.

35
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:47,519
Rupa... my daughter -Is there
anybody to help? Who's Rupa?

36
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,554
Oh God!

37
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:54,016
From boy-friend...-No, her
fiancee... Good looking and rich!

38
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,755
He came yesterday only-
What's happening?- Having coffee.

39
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:09,934
Actually there're 7 days, 12 hrs,
15 min. 20 sec more for wedding

40
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,870
What have you done last night?
I've been dreaming of you all night

41
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,936
It is little bit extra. There is no
reply for my 2 calls last night

42
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,943
I was really with you only,
in my dreams.

43
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,579
It is OK, cut the phone.
Have to go to office?

44
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,500
Rupa! 'Reliance' share rates have
increased. Dispose them off.

45
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,408
'EAMCET' results are published.
Do you know the number of Ram?

46
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:59,306
You are absolutely useless. See
and learn from that girl

47
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:03,817
It is shameful that our daughter
is more educated than him as...

48
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:08,689
...our daughter is a doctor, but
son-in-law is mechanic

49
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,059
Already two times by now!
I have no belief now.

50
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:14,631
Who will comply with me
in this house?

51
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:22,365
Food, sleep and your friends.
This is all your life.

52
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:29,877
No earning at all and he is lying
down like a beast. Get up!

53
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:38,322
What? -Results have come,
and you failed again, fool. Get up

54
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,656
Mother, if I could not pass Inter
how can I get a medical seat

55
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:46,720
You too scold now and then.
This is injustice

56
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:55,634
Useless fellow! Playing all day
and watching cableTV at night.

57
00:07:55,707 --> 00:08:03,136
How can you get ranks and
seats, useless fellow. Get up

58
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:05,776
You live in whatever way you can.
I won't give you single pie.

59
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,447
Grand mother! Beat him.
- Anita! Catch him

60
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:47,650
Come darling, let us go to
the bathroom

61
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:06,602
I want a puppy. You promised me
last time. -Ok-I've no friends

62
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:09,241
I'll purchase one for you.
Brush up your teeth first

63
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:14,047
I do not want old songs.
I want puppy.

64
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:18,715
Rupa! Take this naughty girl
and control her.

65
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:50,150
Actually we should keep
that snoopy fellow in zoo.

66
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:55,651
But still I have to
attend the singing class.

67
00:09:57,662 --> 00:10:07,765
How I wish Roopa is dead! Srikanth should
be bashed up and thrown in the drainage.

68
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:23,521
Rupa! Raju has again fallen in
love, do you know?

69
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,317
What has he done?

70
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,484
See Rupa! Ms Radha is not
talking to me.

71
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,428
Rupa! Father is angry with me.
You know how crazy my mother is

72
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:37,025
My parents are looking for
matches for me...

73
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:41,595
If my career is bright, I may tell
my parents about his love

74
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:49,512
I am in soup, due to his love
now -This is too much, Radha

75
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:51,139
Rupa! Please advise him not to
talk to me

76
00:10:51,216 --> 00:11:01,490
Are you enjoying sound sleep,
or unsound as in movies

77
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,051
Yes, I have no sleep because
of my wedding arrangements

78
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:08,587
Then why do you attend office
when wedding is next week.?

79
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,762
Today is the last day. There is
one account to finalise today

80
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,616
Hi, what happened?

81
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:31,911
He is yelling at me again.

82
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:34,717
Did you give your wedding card
to our Manager?

83
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:39,388
Yes, and also my resignation letter too..
- What did he say?

84
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:43,730
There was no expression on
him, but he said OK.

85
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:51,903
These have to be stitched.

86
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:56,512
A lot of dresses.
More than enough for a marriage

87
00:11:56,581 --> 00:12:05,216
What to do? Have to change
everything... No pants... or T-shirts

88
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:13,220
This cut should not go deep.
Should be at some higher level

89
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:15,732
That is most important.
Don't forget it.

90
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:24,140
Hi... Rupa -Please tell her.
I want within 2 days

91
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:34,149
Mummy wants you to meet her
this evening.

92
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:40,521
Why, is it urgent?
I have lots of work.

93
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:45,220
I am disposing off my Reliance shares
- Why?

94
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:48,231
To meet our wedding expenses
at your level.

95
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,666
That's why, I have not
demanded dowry

96
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:56,605
Had you asked that, I'd have suggested
you to look for some other bride

97
00:12:57,175 --> 00:13:05,776
I know, can't you adjust for my
mother-Granny is coming

98
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:15,986
Please come home this evening,
need to introduce you to our relatives

99
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:21,859
Is it essential? -Yes
- When can we start?

100
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:25,494
You can go alone.
I have to go to shoe store

101
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,970
You can go there tomorrow.
I will accompany you

102
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:33,007
I feel tensed to go alone
- You have to get used to it.

103
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:35,474
Should I take you to select
shoes?

104
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:41,382
You will select some '60s model.
How is this shirt? -So So..

105
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:46,913
Useless shirt. You can't like this.
Please remember to come at six

106
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,824
Come with a saree.
You know the rules.

107
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:53,386
I know, sir. No salwar, no scooty
I should salute and be obedient.

108
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:57,992
I should touch the feet of elders
as soon as I enter. Is this OK?

109
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:10,871
Stop here. It is 6 o'clock
already. What if it's late?

110
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:13,348
Why this tension as though
a world war has started?

111
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:17,047
Do you come inside? -No
please, not into this house

112
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:23,921
They may degrade you
if I accompany you as a friend

113
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,530
Pull your jacket down. Stomach
should not be seen, for them

114
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:36,470
They are very traditional

115
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,441
You have asked me to come
for shopping.

116
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:41,000
I do not like all these
formalities

117
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,047
For my sake...- How do I look?
- Like my face

118
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:50,815
I am angry. I will tell you after
we go back.

119
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,617
Have you come, daughter?
Come...

120
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:05,825
This is the aunt of Rahul

121
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,907
She is our family friend from
Kanpur

122
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:19,374
These are Rahul's paternal
uncle and aunt from Benares

123
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:44,005
This sari is nice. But why did
you bring that girl with pants?

124
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:50,071
She could wear some decent
dress at least. Shameless girl!

125
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:29,545
Another problem. I've to go to
bathroom urgently. Where's it?

126
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,919
I do not know.
Please try to wait

127
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:44,668
You have to learn to cook
our Marwari food for our Rahul

128
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:47,499
Could you manage all the
arrangements for wedding?

129
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:50,040
You're alone. Can you arrange
everything perfectly?

130
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,940
The arrangements should be
made at grand level

131
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,037
I am under pressure.
- Please wait

132
00:16:57,114 --> 00:17:02,984
Do you want something?
- We have to leave urgently.

133
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:09,017
Sit. These people've come
from a long distance to see you

134
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:21,295
--What have you prayed for?

135
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:26,909
Hello, what did you pray?
You woke me in the morning for...

136
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:30,242
...coming here.- Not one, but
I prayed for many things.

137
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:36,284
First, my marriage goes off smoothly
and I should be happy

138
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:38,480
Do you believe in it?
- Yes, a lot

139
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:43,185
I'm tense, whether I can merge
in their family or not...

140
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,390
...and if everything goes properly

141
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:53,267
Terrible. It is a bore.
Don't go to wedding

142
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:55,896
If you feel so,
what could I feel?

143
00:17:55,972 --> 00:18:00,272
New people, new house, all the
restrictions levied only on me

144
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:03,335
Tell me one thing.
Do you really love Mr. Rahul?

145
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:07,315
I do not know anything.
Even I did not think of this much.

146
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:13,653
I didn't find any deficiency in him
when he proposed.

147
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:19,892
He is rich and eligible.
If he wants he can find...

148
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:22,454
...number of brides
- Don't say that you are after his money

149
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:25,126
No, I am just mentioning

150
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:30,967
No doubt, they are complementing
you by all means. But I think...

151
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:37,207
...you may have to sacrifice
many qualities after marriage

152
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,446
That should not happen. His
mother won't let you be yourself

153
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,215
I do not know to what extent
Mr. Rahul can support you

154
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:48,416
I do not know about Rahul, but
her mother is trying...

155
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:54,088
...to dominate me already.
I feel a little scared now.

156
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:59,568
But then, God will look after
me well. I have no doubt.

157
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:02,097
Good luck will befall me with this marriage.

158
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:20,681
Looks like a mad man

159
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:25,092
despite being rich and brought up in city,
what is her name ...?

160
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:28,153
...Venkatalakshmi?
- Why should we bother?

161
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,536
Ask for a boon.
- What?

162
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:37,539
Venkatalakshmi should choose
and prefer me for marriage?

163
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:46,481
What? -No, I should choose
and prefer Venkatalakshmi

164
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:57,557
How can one marry without
seeing even the bride's feet?

165
00:19:57,627 --> 00:20:02,690
Do you like to see her feet
before you make a choice?

166
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,631
You are spoilt after you had
been to America.

167
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:07,295
You are the real culprit.
You are misleading my mother...

168
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,704
...with your meaningless
suggestions

169
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,930
Come, let us go.

170
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:36,396
How is he calling you
as Rupa?

171
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,237
Raju, where is my father?
- Here only. -See there

172
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,608
Dad... Dad...

173
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:09,263
Rupa... Rupa

174
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:15,695
Dad, let us go.

175
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,344
She is not Rupa. If you do like
this I'll not take you to marriage

176
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,852
I will go back to America. Raju!
Take Dad to our place-Ok

177
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:31,812
I will come

178
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,724
Sit...
Please sit, Dad

179
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:51,136
your work is not over-If we further delay,
mom may kill us.

180
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:54,665
Everything is a joke to you. She
is in tension now.

181
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:57,611
You have not come to see
Venkatalakshmi, but...

182
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,481
...brought dad to show
the marriage of Rupa

183
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:05,487
Please don't reveal this to
mother. She may kill me

184
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:08,752
How could mother like her? She
is driving her to temples.

185
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:17,726
Hi, Venkatalakshmi-Just Lakhsmi
- Hi Lakshmi, I am Anand

186
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:28,203
Are these Pullareddy Sweets?
- Yes -They are nice

187
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:38,615
You tell me - You start
- This is very embarrassing

188
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:43,858
I do not know anything about
you. Even you do not know me

189
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:57,405
MBA is almost over. That too
with the consent of my mother

190
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,770
She is forcing me to see
the girls.

191
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:13,722
Sorry, I didn't mean that way.
I am actually tired.

192
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:19,926
Did you see many girls?

193
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:33,440
Not many. A few only, that too
when mother forced me.

194
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,378
And what about you?
- I am doing fashion-designing

195
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:52,717
Hobbies... I like cricket..
and movies! You know Chiranjeevi?

196
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:55,025
...His daughter, Ms. Pratima
is my classmate.

197
00:23:58,768 --> 00:24:04,729
Nagarjuna, now and then, visits
our house. -Is it? -Just kidding

198
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:07,833
How many girls, have
you seen before?

199
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:19,652
Anand, will you put batteries in
this car?- So Cute-What's your name?

200
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:26,659
Sameer-Take this!-Whose kid
is this? -Our driver's son

201
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:28,629
He has been brought up
with us since childhood

202
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:38,499
First tell me, whether you like
Venkatalakshmi or not.

203
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:41,840
You put me under suspense. I like
her. If you say OK...

204
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:46,848
...I'll finish the marriage. What
do you say? All seems ok.

205
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:50,985
Raju, you tell me.
Am I hurrying?

206
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:54,512
Chiranjeevi will come to your
marriage. -What is that?

207
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:57,617
He says that Chiranjeevi's
daughter is her classmate

208
00:24:57,694 --> 00:25:03,633
What is that, Anand? There
should be some reason

209
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:10,663
What is lacking in her? Tell me,
I have to answer them

210
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:19,005
My good mother, go for sleep.
I will tell you tomorrow.

211
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:24,987
Go away. I thought of fixing the
marriage, if you like her

212
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:27,682
I will go to Vizag, at least
I can attend to work there.

213
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:35,129
Is it due to Anand?-Anyway
she'll come in 3 months

214
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:39,028
You take everything as a joke.
I have an important meeting.

215
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:42,594
Raju. Show the marriage to these
people, send him to States...

216
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:45,835
...and later come to our native
town accompanying your father

217
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:50,906
You're like a girl. I've to search
for a new bride for you now

218
00:25:54,350 --> 00:26:02,689
Be careful, Anand-Are you
listening-Yes, you go. We'll see

219
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:07,421
I'll leave - Bye...
- Raju, take care of dad

220
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:45,027
<i>Music in heart</i>

232

233
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:29,696

240
00:30:02,131 --> 00:30:04,622
I am getting bored
What shall we do?

241
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,533
When will you prosper?
You never followed me.

242
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:11,596
You will not wear a suit. Some
status is required at least

243
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:15,871
I will come just now.
- Father, where're you off to?

244
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:20,943
On whose behalf have you come?
- Bride's behalf

245
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:23,780
If so, please take this and
serve this in that room

246
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:28,950
Rupa, where are you?

247
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,329
You sit. I will check up

248
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:51,278
Whom do you want?
- Rupa... there... -Wait, dad

249
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:57,841
Sorry, he is my father.
He intends to meet the bride.

250
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:03,019
But who are you?
- I am...

251
00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:08,863
Who is that?

252
00:31:37,593 --> 00:31:43,122
Where is he?-Busy in the hall
looking at girls.

253
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:55,738
Rupa! Please take this.
Please take these too.

254
00:31:57,946 --> 00:31:58,810
Who are you?

255
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:01,245
Who is this?

256
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:20,267
You need this twice today
lest evil eye is cast on you

257
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:33,242
Please wear this sari, not in your
South Indian style. Please help her.

258
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:38,278
Rupa wants to wear her
mother's saree

259
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:44,817
No, no. This is our family
tradition. She's to wear this

260
00:32:50,832 --> 00:32:54,290
Aunt! If I wear this, I feel that
my mother is with me

261
00:32:57,139 --> 00:33:01,337
I already said "no". Wear this
sari and come quickly.

262
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:07,112
You wait! I will talk to Rahul and come.
This is too much

263
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:12,117
If you go again, you will be
beaten

264
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:20,692
Finished off your serving. Face
must have value, not attire-Come

265
00:33:22,197 --> 00:33:24,324
Why do you create fuss for
a small thing?

266
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,095
This is not a small thing.
It is her mother's saree.

267
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,330
Since her childhood it is her
desire to wear it on her wedding

268
00:33:31,406 --> 00:33:39,404
It is a precious thing for her
and for her sentiment

269
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:42,211
I know it, Anita. Do not get
excited unnecessarily.

270
00:33:42,284 --> 00:33:47,347
It is better to follow elders in
these affairs. Tell her to listen...

271
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:51,950
...to mother. It's not a big deal.
I'll see everything after wedding

272
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:57,489
Not a big deal?
Then I will keep like this only, big deal!

273
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:00,224
You are just like Goddess
Mahalakshmi

274
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:04,803
Grand mother! You tell her at
least.

275
00:34:04,873 --> 00:34:05,862
She advises us to change this
saree.- What happened to this?

276
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:11,174
Rupa, didn't you change your
saree yet? Go and change

277
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:17,151
Madam! This is her mother's
saree. Let it be. It is good.

278
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,346
Being an elder woman, why are
you saying this?

279
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:22,185
Rupa, it is delayed already,
go and change your saree

280
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:31,365
I can't do it, mother. This saree
only is good for me.

281
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:42,310
I like my mother's saree.
Please listen to me

282
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:47,476
Rupa, will you change your
saree or not?

283
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:05,066
Rupa, go and change your saree.
Do not make this a big issue

284
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:08,967
Anita, take her inside. I will
go and talk with them and come.

285
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:16,066
When she is so stubborn. She is
elder, let us listen to her

286
00:35:20,582 --> 00:35:22,914
A bride should remain
as a bride only

287
00:35:22,984 --> 00:35:27,387
It is a sin, if a bride talks back
to her mother-in-law.

288
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:31,517
We do not know your traditions,
madam. Please bear with us

289
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:35,586
I am her mother-in-law. Isn't it
her duty to respect my word?

290
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:39,432
She might talk back after
wedding-She's young. Leave her.

291
00:35:41,303 --> 00:35:45,205
Why should I leave this matter?
She should change sari and come...

292
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:50,472
...touch my feet and apologize.
Then only I will come

293
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:53,941
Grandmother, please bring her.

294
00:36:02,357 --> 00:36:04,655
I took pity on her as she has no parents.

295
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:08,954
There is no dowry, no money
and no caste.

296
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:17,233
But she is very arrogant and
not at all obedient

297
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:17,862
She has defied me in the
presence of all. I'll see her

298
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:18,928
Mother! What is this injustice?

299
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:22,443
Since she has nobody, you have
taken pity on her.

300
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:27,539
You can change her after
marriage as you wish.

301
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:34,954
I can't shut my mouth. I will
not repeat the mistake I did first

302
00:36:35,023 --> 00:36:40,620
What have you told me?
You said, she is obedient...

303
00:36:40,695 --> 00:36:47,123
...and she will listen to us
as she is an orphan.

304
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:51,900
Can't we get a girl like this
in our community?

305
00:36:55,177 --> 00:36:59,546
I consented to you due to my bad
fate. How dare she insults me?

306
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:31,375
Aunt! I did not expect that you
will be upset. I am really sorry

307
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,417
Realise and understand first.
My command is always an order.

308
00:37:46,495 --> 00:37:51,228
There is no amendment. You have
to follow without questioning.

309
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:53,733
Don't feel proud that you
are the only one for my son

310
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:57,405
My single call can bring hundreds
of brides with millions of rupees

311
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:58,404
...to stand in queue. After all,
you are without parents, dowry,

312
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:04,442
and caste. I have only favoured
you due to pity. Understand this.

313
00:38:04,513 --> 00:38:10,383
Since you have no parents...
it is not a license to do anything

314
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:17,688
I'll show you after wedding what
a mother-in-law is? Go now.

315
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:35,175
Calm down, Rupa-I am afraid of
this marriage now

316
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:49,147
Rupa, count ten before doing anything
- I have already counted hundred.

317
00:38:49,224 --> 00:38:54,685
Yes, I have controlled myself
while she was talking to me.

318
00:38:54,763 --> 00:38:59,791
I require a clarification.
- Don't Rupa, please...

319
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:10,669
Rahul, tell me one thing. -Rupa
please go and get ready

320
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:17,207
Rahul, I need to know ..
- Let her ask.You can ask anything

321
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:21,483
You told me that you have
convinced your mother. Isn't it?

322
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:26,084
Did you tell her that I have no
parents and will always oblige you?

323
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:28,254
Rupa, it is not like that.
- You be quiet

324
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:35,327
Yes, It is for that only. Yes,
I agreed for that reason only

325
00:39:35,403 --> 00:39:39,066
That means you do not truly like me.
You have no belief in me

326
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,199
You made her to show
mercy on me

327
00:39:41,276 --> 00:39:44,302
Rahul, are you marrying me
due to pity or compassion?

328
00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:49,476
There are beautiful and very
rich brides in our community

329
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:52,782
You are nothing as compared to
them. This is the truth-Mother!

330
00:39:52,854 --> 00:40:04,322
Rahul! I am scared to live with
you. I fear to enter your house

331
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:11,134
We are not demons. Stop this
drama right here.

332
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:14,369
The marriage is not yet over,
she is already trying to create...

333
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:16,273
...rifts between mother
and son

334
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:20,474
Mother!
- Keep up our family respect

335
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:29,849
Tell me, Rahul.
- I am there for you.I love you Rupa

336
00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:33,826
Who requires your love? You
loved me and at the same time ..

337
00:40:33,895 --> 00:40:37,854
...you preferred me to survive
like a obedient dog in your house

338
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:40,765
I'm sorry - Why do you talk like
that, Rupa?

339
00:40:40,835 --> 00:40:44,601
Sorry, extremely sorry. If I do
not wake up now, I may be...

340
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:50,839
...doing injustice to my own
life. I don't need this wedding.

341
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,180
I have compromised on many
issues in my life.

342
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:58,276
But I can't pledge my
self-respect and independence

343
00:40:58,353 --> 00:41:00,253
I can't survive as a dumb and
deaf creature

344
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:05,953
Let her go. There are hundreds
of brides craving out there.

345
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:12,728
Don't you feel ashamed to beg
her like an orphan?

346
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,730
Rupa, please consider. If the
marriage is stopped...

347
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:22,266
...your life will be ruined.
Don't be silly.

348
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:24,311
Do you spoil your marriage
for a saree.

349
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:27,473
This is neither a silly thing,
nor the question of a saree.

350
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:30,848
Even now you are saying that I
can't live without you...

351
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:35,322
...but you could not say that,
you will miss me

352
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,483
You are posing as though
a saviour of my life...

353
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,222
Instead of surrendering my life
and ruining it...

354
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:47,792
...I prefer to ruin my life
with my own hands

355
00:41:47,902 --> 00:41:52,771
I'll feel much better. It's ok.
You need not regret for me

356
00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:02,941
What happened, Anita?
Rupa, whereto?

357
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:37,677
Anita, I lost my control

358
00:42:37,752 --> 00:42:43,918
If I could control, my wedding
would have been over

359
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:54,027
I am arrogant. I have made a
mistake. My mom woudn't have allowed this

360
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:03,937
Neither you have done any
mistake and did everything rightly

361
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:11,752
Let me tell you that God has
helped you a lot

362
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:18,525
Rahul is not fit for you.
It is God's decision.

363
00:43:18,593 --> 00:43:23,587
If you forget all this, I tell you,
you'll be happy in some days

364
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:33,403
Now stop crying. Please take
rest. Shall I sleep here?

365
00:43:48,957 --> 00:43:52,449
Mother! Why didn't you take me
with you?

366
00:43:52,527 --> 00:44:02,334
How many days should I be
in pain like this?

367
00:44:24,825 --> 00:44:27,817
Hundreds of girls are seen on
road. You can like them also

368
00:44:27,895 --> 00:44:30,955
Can you stay here for that
reason? Think logically.

369
00:44:31,031 --> 00:44:33,829
What is your level and prestige?
Come, let us go.

370
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:37,496
What do you know about her?

371
00:44:37,571 --> 00:44:39,732
Just now, she had spoiled her
wedding,

372
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,468
She might be in love with
somebody, or...

373
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:45,808
...with many people. What is the
guarantee? Think logically

374
00:44:45,879 --> 00:44:48,848
Who is she? What is her
family?...

375
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:52,943
She has no family. You might
have forgotten, but I didn't.

376
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,818
Who is responsible for that?
My father...

377
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:58,050
He caused an accident in a fully
drunken state to her family

378
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:04,792
Why do you talk irrelevantly?

379
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:12,134
You scare me sometimes. We should
think with our heart at times.

380
00:45:12,373 --> 00:45:16,366
Why do you talk of the
character of an innocent girl?

381
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:27,116
Where can you stay? How can
you answer our mother?

382
00:45:27,187 --> 00:45:31,920
How can you adjust here?
- I will try. There is no loss

383
00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:37,760
Of course, I will stay there.
Let us check

384
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:40,095
What about mother?
What about your MBA studies?

385
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:42,965
Manage our mother somehow.

386
00:45:43,037 --> 00:45:45,130
I can appear for MBA exams.
after 6 months

387
00:45:45,205 --> 00:45:48,003
MBA is not more important
than a life partner

388
00:45:48,075 --> 00:45:52,808
Mother may get anxious.
- Don't tell mother

389
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,905
Now and then I will call as
though I am in America

390
00:45:54,982 --> 00:45:56,813
Please help me at this point.

391
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:59,114
If not, I may have to marry
a junk girl

392
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:01,984
If she comes to know of you
it may lead to many complexities

393
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:06,959
You see, she is very
sensitive.

394
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:09,461
First I should like her. After
that, she should like me

395
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:10,792
And only then the question of
marriage.

396
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:22,164
My name is Anand. I have seen
that "To Let" board.

397
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:26,941
One room is enough for me. I
won't do any mischief

398
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:35,452
I know. I know your mother also.
I only posted the wedding card

399
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,690
You can go

400
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:03,114
If you are up to any mischief, I'll catch
your neck and kick you out.

401
00:48:09,783 --> 00:48:17,053
Hello! - What? -I stay there.
Toilet... -You can go

402
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:45,145
What is your name?
- I am Anand

403
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:51,387
Why did you come to my room?
- I am in the outhouse

404
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:57,325
My name is Samata
- Thanks Samata

405
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:08,339
Anand! Can you help me?-What
help? -Come inside, I'll tell you

406
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,870
Give that paste to me.
- You've brushed already

407
00:49:12,946 --> 00:49:15,972
Not for brushing.
I like paste very much.

408
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:27,893
Are you afraid of dogs?
- No, why?

409
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:39,436
Srikanth has got one dirty dog.
It always growls at me

410
00:49:39,673 --> 00:49:42,369
So, I should fight with it.

411
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:48,074
Yes, didn't I give you
bath room or not?

412
00:49:49,149 --> 00:49:51,674
From now onwards, we are
friends.

413
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:04,991
This is my friend, Anand.
He will beat this dog a lot

414
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:19,440
Hi, I am Anand, staying there on
rent. -Grandma told me

415
00:50:21,348 --> 00:50:23,282
Thanks for allowing me
to use the bathroom.

416
00:50:24,284 --> 00:50:26,081
For Jogging? -Yes
- Can I come with you.

417
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:27,780
No. Mind your own business.

418
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:36,854
Is Rupa inside, Sir?
- Ask inside

419
00:50:52,412 --> 00:50:55,176
Payment for tents?
- What?

420
00:50:55,248 --> 00:50:59,480
For yesterday's tents
and also for rickshaw...

421
00:51:05,826 --> 00:51:10,422
Is this sufficient?-Bill is for
Rs. 2,000 only madam.

422
00:51:10,497 --> 00:51:11,794
You have paid excess...
- No problem, keep it with you

423
00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:21,373
Did you meet Rupa?
Not until now, please

424
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:23,932
We are friends, Let me share
your work with you

425
00:51:25,912 --> 00:51:26,844
Mind your own business, man

426
00:51:28,448 --> 00:51:32,145
Rupa, open the door.
- Come, Anita

427
00:51:39,793 --> 00:51:41,488
What is this, Rupa like a
patient?

428
00:51:44,865 --> 00:51:51,134
Everybody is celebrating your
decision. He was not fit for you

429
00:51:56,777 --> 00:52:02,807
I had got used to him a lot.

430
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:10,851
Everything has changed in a
single day-Don't weep now

431
00:52:10,924 --> 00:52:14,382
How can I go to office now?

432
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:17,897
I have distributed my wedding
cards, threw parties to everybody

433
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:19,591
I have also submitted by
resignation

434
00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:34,302
Everybody is staring at me as a
mad woman and arrogant

435
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:36,042
Let them think what they want.
It is their fate

436
00:52:36,116 --> 00:52:40,052
There are hundreds of jobs to
choose. Come, let us go out.

437
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,213
Our friends are waiting for us.

438
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:47,022
Everybody is thinking that I have
spoiled my wedding for a sari.

439
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:51,258
Rupa! Please forget.
Please quit the subject.

440
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:54,027
Whoever can understand us
only can remain our friends.

441
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:56,228
We should worry only
about them.

442
00:52:56,303 --> 00:52:58,635
We need not bother for the
people who don't value us.

443
00:52:58,872 --> 00:53:01,864
Please Come...
- You can go. I have no mood

444
00:53:01,942 --> 00:53:06,140
Just for a change, please come.
- I've no mood, you can go

445
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:30,264
Please call Rupa.
- Go away, man -Anita

446
00:53:30,337 --> 00:53:34,000
Rupa, I am sorry please.
I was left with no choice.

447
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:40,440
Rupa, please understand me.
I could not do anything.

448
00:53:40,514 --> 00:53:41,674
My mother...

449
00:53:41,915 --> 00:53:44,281
Leave your mother aside.
Your love itself is faulty.

450
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:48,253
She is happy without you
- Anita, allow me to talk to Rupa

451
00:53:52,659 --> 00:53:56,595
Who is he? - What is it to you?
Anyway, I'll tell you.

452
00:53:56,897 --> 00:54:01,994
He is Rupa's new boy friend
Come, let us go to movie

453
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:08,701
Rupa just got independence on September 15.
We are celebrating!

454
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:17,316
Rupa, I could not support you,
but do you know my position?

455
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:26,088
I had mother and you on either side.
What can I decide then?

456
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:34,294
Rahul, I know your limitations.
If I've to change myself...

457
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:37,393
...according to your mother's
whims throughout my life...

458
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:43,375
...I may hate myself and
you too may also lose your love for me

459
00:54:43,443 --> 00:54:47,038
This will not be good for both of us.
Hence I put up a break...

460
00:54:47,113 --> 00:54:50,549
...without dragging you into the
mess, so that you may...

461
00:54:50,617 --> 00:54:55,611
...not be affected further.
Please do not force me, Rahul.

462
00:54:59,059 --> 00:55:01,721
You are upset now.
I will meet you again

463
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:39,629
Anita, I got severe headache,
I am going home

464
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:52,672
Anita. You can stay here. I'll go
with her. Samata is calling.

465
00:56:33,787 --> 00:56:35,049
Aren't you interested
to see movies?

466
00:56:37,757 --> 00:56:47,325
Rupa! -Rupa, I heard about the
incident. Sorry.

467
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:54,670
I heard that everything
happened due to a sari.

468
00:56:54,741 --> 00:56:56,834
Will you please sit there?
- No, please

469
00:56:57,077 --> 00:57:01,480
There is a seat in the rear.
- If so, you can sit there

470
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:04,779
You sat by the side of a girl,
how can you leave it?

471
00:57:09,322 --> 00:57:10,653
Rupa! You could have told them
to shut their mouth

472
00:57:10,724 --> 00:57:15,787
You can say "shut up" to whoever
if you don't like their talk.

473
00:57:17,397 --> 00:57:18,421
Shut up!

474
00:58:20,694 --> 00:58:22,286
What is it?
- Urgent

475
00:58:36,776 --> 00:58:41,509
Anita...-Don't create as an
international problem. Come in

476
00:58:41,581 --> 00:58:47,577
It is difficult to control it.-This
is the last time, I allow you

477
00:58:47,654 --> 00:58:49,679
Make your own arrangements
from tomorrow onwards

478
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:58,559
Whereto boss?
- To Super market -Come...

479
00:59:00,966 --> 00:59:01,955
Are you new to this town?

480
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:06,698
I met you day before.
Did you forget me?

481
00:59:06,772 --> 00:59:08,865
Was that you who stepped into
my auto with Anita?

482
00:59:08,941 --> 00:59:12,206
What is this? Is this a new
style of open type auto?

483
00:59:12,278 --> 00:59:14,712
No, this is my style
Ali Style

484
00:59:16,815 --> 00:59:20,808
I saw you with those college
boys. Did you quit your studies?

485
00:59:20,886 --> 00:59:22,979
It may be better you have a
basic degree

486
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:25,922
Get down first from auto
- What happened, boss?

487
00:59:25,991 --> 00:59:30,928
Everybody gives advice. You are
great, we're all waste

488
00:59:30,996 --> 00:59:34,022
I just said... - What is
this casual remark, boss?

489
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:37,091
Mother shouts in house, and on
road, people like you? Get down

490
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:54,781
Is there anybody to help?
- I am here

491
01:00:05,664 --> 01:00:07,661
Did you at least catch a
glimpse of Rupa's feet

492
01:00:07,662 --> 01:00:09,657
- What?-I am just asking.

493
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:12,033
You are taking a lot of trouble.

494
01:00:12,104 --> 01:00:14,299
I just wanted to check up one
criteria at least.-I'll kill you

495
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:20,106
You must have made some friends here.
- I have one friend

496
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:26,017
Hi! uncle.
She's my friend

497
01:00:26,385 --> 01:00:27,511
Is that small girl
your friend?

498
01:00:40,466 --> 01:00:43,748
Anand, is Anita there?
Call her to the ground.

499
01:00:43,749 --> 01:00:47,030
Boys are fighting...

500
01:00:47,106 --> 01:00:48,471
...in the ground, they are
beating up Ali and Ram.

501
01:00:48,472 --> 01:00:49,836
- I will just come.

502
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,342
Is it a serious fight, - I don't know
Anand! Shall I call Gautam?-Yes

503
01:01:15,501 --> 01:01:18,527
Are you Ms Anita?-Yes, why?
Everybody is looking for you

504
01:01:18,604 --> 01:01:20,367
They said that some fighting is
going on in the ground.

505
01:01:23,442 --> 01:01:27,606
Keep all those inside
Keep them, man

506
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:36,517
Did you beat me? Come to our
side, I will show you

507
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:40,621
They made a bet
and are fighting over it.

508
01:01:40,693 --> 01:01:43,389
The rules have been changed
again, Anita

509
01:01:43,462 --> 01:01:48,229
They are always like that..unfair
..and these people will never learn.

510
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:56,436
Did you beat our man?

511
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:09,487
Brother! He only beat me.
- How dare you hit our man?

512
01:02:09,555 --> 01:02:11,489
What guy! Aren't you keen
to survive on earth?

513
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:13,115
No brother!
I didn't say anything.

514
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:17,526
After all you are a kid before me.
I will break your bones

515
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:20,724
No brother, they are changing
the stakes.

516
01:02:23,836 --> 01:02:26,566
First, give the money fast
- Why should we bother?

517
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:32,839
Let us bet again and play.
- Who will play? Take out the money

518
01:02:36,815 --> 01:02:38,749
Leave them.

519
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:48,927
Why this fight? They are young
boys, please leave them

520
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:50,719
Who are you, man?

521
01:02:59,872 --> 01:03:02,340
Haven't you got sisters
in your home?

522
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,975
Anita, go home with children.
You also go.

523
01:03:13,218 --> 01:03:18,520
Hi, he is arrogant. Take him in
the van. I'll break his pride.

524
01:03:44,683 --> 01:03:49,347
Are you OK? - OK.
It was a small fight. You came with an army

525
01:03:49,555 --> 01:03:55,585
Raju called me up when I was around,
Is he the leader for this?

526
01:03:55,661 --> 01:04:03,329
Leave them Goutam. This is just petty stuff
- You go. I will see -Ok...

527
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:11,403
Don't put your hand on me.
Hey, Call the MLA

528
01:04:11,477 --> 01:04:17,347
These people won't listen in a
smooth way. You please go.

529
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:21,318
I will deal with them.
- Ok guys, let us go

530
01:04:24,089 --> 01:04:28,253
You won't understand by mere
talking. Phone now.

531
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:42,739
Gautam is my cousin.
He just stopped by.

532
01:04:42,808 --> 01:04:46,437
And who is that in the house?
- He is Raju. He's also my cousin

533
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:48,571
How many cousins do you have?

534
01:04:48,647 --> 01:04:51,047
After all, I came here trying
for a job.

535
01:04:51,283 --> 01:04:55,947
Hey, Where is my stuff?
- There...

536
01:05:00,926 --> 01:05:03,019
He is dead now.
He picked up fight with Gautam.

537
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:12,837
Who is this girl, seems crazy.
- Anita...

538
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:15,669
I put her bags inside.
She didn't even thank me and..

539
01:05:15,741 --> 01:05:17,038
...Is trying to order me around.

540
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:38,924
Actually, you are wrong.
Why did you have to play with those rogues?

541
01:05:38,997 --> 01:05:42,262
What do we know of them?
They bet with us and we played

542
01:05:42,334 --> 01:05:44,859
They seem like murderers.
Did you see their language?

543
01:05:44,937 --> 01:05:50,569
You got only them...
- Ali, tell him not to touch me.

544
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:54,442
Leave it -Why, all the family
members pray for his welfare...

545
01:05:54,513 --> 01:05:57,038
...but this hero fights with rogues

546
01:05:57,115 --> 01:06:01,017
If they had done anything to me,
then you could've wept for me.

547
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:02,348
Radha, this is too much.

548
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:05,288
Ali, actually he should have
been at the coaching centre...

549
01:06:05,357 --> 01:06:08,224
...at that time.
Then, why did he come here?

550
01:06:08,293 --> 01:06:09,920
Radha! Why do you raise the
issue of medical seat...

551
01:06:09,995 --> 01:06:12,862
...when he has no interest in it.

552
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:14,421
Anand! you don't understand.

553
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:18,666
Moreover, you can't understand
my concerns at all.

554
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:24,367
I told you not to touch me

555
01:06:24,443 --> 01:06:28,470
If you do not talk to me, won't
I also feel bad? I love him

556
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:35,485
Even if he begs on roads, I will still
love him But my dad won't be quiet.

557
01:06:35,554 --> 01:06:38,921
If you do not get a seat this
time, he'll never agree

558
01:06:38,991 --> 01:06:40,959
Then we may have to elope
without anybody's knowledge

559
01:06:44,263 --> 01:06:48,393
Anita! Is Ali there?-He is not home yet!
- I'll inform you if he comes

560
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:51,527
He went out in the morning
and god knows where he is.

561
01:06:51,603 --> 01:06:53,696
This is another secretive life

562
01:06:53,939 --> 01:06:59,900
What is your problem? If you
pass XII, you can go to Dubai

563
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:04,972
Oh God! Lessons after lessons.
- Shut up. Auto is enough for you

564
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:08,451
If you sight a girl, you can't
take your looks off.

565
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,318
Can't you do something and pass
your XII class?

566
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,379
I will surely pass this time.

567
01:07:12,457 --> 01:07:16,917
I had to hear all those bad words from
the rogues because of you. Nonsense!

568
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:19,692
Why all the people started
weeping today?

569
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:31,037
Anand! - What happened?
- Beat Srikanth... See this

570
01:07:35,314 --> 01:07:40,377
I have drawn a boy's picture and
he had drawn a line on it

571
01:07:40,452 --> 01:07:42,511
Teacher awarded me
with zero marks

572
01:07:44,389 --> 01:07:49,656
Anand! Isn't that everybody will
have that. Her teacher is mad

573
01:07:49,728 --> 01:07:55,257
No, you are only mad
- Anand, you tell us

574
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,194
Samata, he is correct,
Boys do have that.

575
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,761
Don't you feel shame? Are those
things taught to children?

576
01:08:01,006 --> 01:08:05,773
Samata, come to me. Don't talk
to him. He is a devil.

577
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:10,572
Rupa! What's wrong in
telling facts to the children?

578
01:08:10,649 --> 01:08:13,311
Will you shut your mouth?
Samata, come to me

579
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:16,684
OK Samata! Boys will not have
it. Is it OK?

580
01:08:18,323 --> 01:08:20,655
That is worse.
Get up and come with me

581
01:08:31,102 --> 01:08:35,971
Rupa! Hi, how are you?

582
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:57,087
Is that you, Rupa?
- Sir

583
01:08:57,161 --> 01:09:01,461
I heard the news.
I thought of calling you.

584
01:09:01,532 --> 01:09:06,993
I do not say sorry etc.,
I know, you are a mature woman...

585
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:11,030
...and you might have
taken an appropriate decision.

586
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:15,978
My resignation...

587
01:09:16,047 --> 01:09:20,006
I am coming to that. I have not
yet approved that yet ..

588
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:25,852
You can continue as usual.
Same seat, same group. No problem

589
01:10:15,806 --> 01:10:24,009
<i>The black clouds have come</i>

590
01:10:34,058 --> 01:10:41,624

592

613
01:14:01,231 --> 01:14:06,328
Hi. Since morning you are not seen
- I've to go for shopping

614
01:14:11,442 --> 01:14:15,037
Rupa will not come until evening?
- Where has she gone?

615
01:14:19,116 --> 01:14:22,415
Do you want details?
Is there anything special?

616
01:14:22,653 --> 01:14:24,348
No, just casual enquiry

617
01:14:24,421 --> 01:14:27,686
She has gone to nursery.
She goes there sometimes

618
01:14:27,758 --> 01:14:28,952
We have to attend a wedding

619
01:14:29,026 --> 01:14:33,395
I came for you this morning.
Where had you been?

620
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:35,188
I thought, you may prefer to
go there

621
01:14:35,265 --> 01:14:39,998
Can I go now?
- Do you want to go? - Yes

622
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,799
Ask Ali.
He may take you there.

623
01:14:57,187 --> 01:14:58,347
Anita told me perhaps you may
require some help.

624
01:14:58,422 --> 01:15:01,414
Do you need to run
to come to me?

625
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:06,424
Wait, it is not like that

626
01:15:28,852 --> 01:15:30,911
Rupa, please listen to me.
Give me a chance

627
01:15:33,757 --> 01:15:36,851
My mother is of old generation.
Our traditions are troublesome

628
01:15:36,927 --> 01:15:45,232
If you ask me to choose
between either mother or wife...

629
01:15:45,302 --> 01:15:51,434
...how can I answer suddenly?
Think reasonably.

630
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:55,808
I required some time to
think over the problem

631
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,781
I should have reacted at
that time only

632
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:05,049
Rupa, time has not lapsed.
I will talk to my mother

633
01:16:05,122 --> 01:16:10,389
Let us work out a solution.
Please give me some time.

634
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:15,397
Rupa, don't get angry.
Tell me something

635
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,696
I will see you tomorrow

636
01:16:23,473 --> 01:16:29,537
My work is finished...
- Can you complete this too?

637
01:16:40,524 --> 01:16:41,786
Keys...
I will come tomorrow, madam.

638
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:47,319
Whom will you give those
flowers?

639
01:16:48,866 --> 01:16:51,068
I will give to Anita.
Are you going to home?

640
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:53,269
- Yes.

641
01:17:05,382 --> 01:17:08,010
How much is this?
- Rs. 200

642
01:17:08,418 --> 01:17:13,913
Can you give it for Rs.20?...
- I can give this for that price

643
01:17:26,003 --> 01:17:30,565
Darkness has surrounded already.
How can he come?

644
01:17:30,807 --> 01:17:36,837
If he comes, he will chatter and
give me headache. Let me see

645
01:17:39,917 --> 01:17:43,478
Come

646
01:17:47,024 --> 01:17:49,322
Sit by the side.
- How can I, like ladies...

647
01:17:49,393 --> 01:17:53,352
I am irritated. It is your need.
If you want, you can sit...

648
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:56,160
...If not, you need not.

649
01:17:56,233 --> 01:17:58,599
Idea.. I will drive.
Can you sit at the back?

650
01:17:59,002 --> 01:18:00,993
Thanks for the idea.
This is your need.

651
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,334
Tell me your preference at once.
- Ok

652
01:18:51,955 --> 01:18:56,153
What is this?...
Tell me, what is this?

653
01:18:59,596 --> 01:19:03,930
This costs Rs.200
I was foolish to offer you lift

654
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:10,702
It happened just like that, unknowingly.
- Go to hell

655
01:19:52,682 --> 01:19:54,064
It will be hell for us,
through out the night.

656
01:19:54,065 --> 01:19:55,446
We can't do the work

657
01:19:57,187 --> 01:20:00,588
There is also some other job
for that hero.

658
01:20:18,675 --> 01:20:25,308
Please come in Rupa.
- You've headache - Yes

659
01:20:25,382 --> 01:20:28,579
Fever -Yes
Body pain - Too much

660
01:20:28,652 --> 01:20:34,591
Three times a day
- Thanks

661
01:20:38,628 --> 01:20:41,062
At this hour of night, with such rain,
you came for me

662
01:20:41,131 --> 01:20:45,261
Do you watch a lot of movies?
- Yes, I love them

663
01:20:45,335 --> 01:20:50,295
I thought so. There is no such thing Don't
use your imagination. We've lots of work

664
01:20:50,373 --> 01:20:55,640
If you cough through out the
night, it is a disturbance to us

665
01:20:55,712 --> 01:21:02,174
This is done by you. Those black
marks should not appear to me

666
01:21:02,252 --> 01:21:06,120
Either you get it washed,
or purchase a new one...

667
01:21:06,189 --> 01:21:08,749
...it is up to you. Understand?

668
01:21:09,759 --> 01:21:15,061
Rupa, will you please sit for a
while? You came to my room...

669
01:21:15,132 --> 01:21:17,123
...for the first time.
Tea, coffee ...?

670
01:21:51,735 --> 01:21:53,168
Are you OK now?
- Yes. But I feel weak

671
01:21:53,236 --> 01:21:56,865
Come with me.
- Tell me whereto..

672
01:21:57,107 --> 01:21:59,234
Will tell you on the way.
Come

673
01:21:59,309 --> 01:22:02,176
Please wait, I will come now.
- Come

674
01:22:05,749 --> 01:22:07,808
Did Malaika come in your dreams?
- Did she tell you?

675
01:22:08,818 --> 01:22:13,187
Just I was working on lighting,
camera etc.

676
01:22:13,256 --> 01:22:16,851
Do you see any big
flower in my ear?

677
01:22:17,093 --> 01:22:19,653
I was not looking at the legs of
Malaika.

678
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:21,629
It is OK, every boy looks at
girls' legs

679
01:22:21,698 --> 01:22:25,691
Anyway leave Malaika!
Try Rupa

680
01:22:26,436 --> 01:22:29,735
What is this eatable?
It is so hot

681
01:22:29,806 --> 01:22:31,774
This day is an important day
for Rupa.

682
01:22:31,841 --> 01:22:33,741
Today is the death anniversary of
her parents

683
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:35,710
She is giving lunch to all the
people in old age home

684
01:22:38,949 --> 01:22:44,546
It is a pity. She lost her parents
and brother in an accident -I know

685
01:22:45,222 --> 01:22:49,682
I've to go to nursery. I will
give you a drop at old age home

686
01:22:49,759 --> 01:22:53,490
Please help her in serving lunch.
Don't eat up her head

687
01:22:53,964 --> 01:22:57,161
She is on silent penance today.
- Yes madam, I will do

688
01:23:39,909 --> 01:23:40,739
Rupa, take this

689
01:24:41,604 --> 01:24:47,270
Can I ask you some thing.
Little bit personal

690
01:24:47,344 --> 01:24:52,782
I can tell you, if you do not
scold and beat me

691
01:24:52,849 --> 01:24:56,876
You should not get angry.
Nothing serious

692
01:24:56,953 --> 01:25:00,514
Did you ever think of the man, who
had caused the accident?

693
01:25:03,927 --> 01:25:06,623
If he meets you again,
what you will do then?

694
01:25:06,696 --> 01:25:09,824
Will you kill him?

695
01:25:24,414 --> 01:25:27,383
I do not know anything about
him. I never thought about it

696
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:33,650
Aren't you angry with him?
- No. -Is it true?

697
01:25:45,101 --> 01:25:47,899
I feel that the accident
happened because of me only

698
01:25:47,971 --> 01:25:52,806
I delayed them for a long
time with my stubbornness

699
01:25:53,877 --> 01:25:56,869
If they had left at their
scheduled hour...

700
01:25:56,946 --> 01:25:59,608
...I feel that the accident might
not have happened

701
01:26:08,324 --> 01:26:15,059
You give me such pain
but walk away with a smile

702
01:26:15,131 --> 01:26:22,867
You hurt me but
sprinkle flowers on wound

703
01:26:22,939 --> 01:26:33,907
She hides in her words.
and make me wonder

704
01:26:39,989 --> 01:26:47,361
Rupa, do you require any help?
I'm here for you. You go...

705
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:51,059
...and sit leisurely. Tell me what
you want. No formalities

706
01:27:05,048 --> 01:27:10,714
So lovely as a baby
Pretty as a belle

707
01:27:10,787 --> 01:27:16,453
Teasing me as moonlight..
Killing me with her teasing

708
01:27:21,864 --> 01:27:25,925
All of them have gone Anand.
We are late

709
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:37,834
<i>Sparkling beauty, I love you</i>
<i>Moonlike beauty, I love you</i>

710
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:42,902
<i>You woke me up and faced me</i>
<i>as my first love</i>

711
01:29:42,972 --> 01:29:47,534
<i>I could not sleep</i>
<i>without your sweet dreams</i>

712
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:59,750
<i>Will you give me a boon</i>
<i>or leave me alone?</i>

713
01:30:07,029 --> 01:30:17,735
<i>Sparkling beauty, I love you</i>
<i>Moonlike beauty, I love you</i>
