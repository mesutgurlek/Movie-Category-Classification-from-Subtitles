18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,880
- Hello, Mr. Winfield.
- Good afternoon.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,520
That's Mr. Winfield,
Vice-President of our First National Bank,

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,520
Chairman of the Civic Betterment League,

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,000
and twice winner of the Elks' picnic
potato-sack race.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,400
- Hello, George.
- Hello, darling.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,880
See that woman he just kissed?
That's Mrs. Winfield.

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,640
They've been married for 20 years,
and she knows how to handle him,

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,600
in spite of all of his faults.
Know what his biggest fault is?

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,040
He doesn't think he has any.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,600
The Winfields have two children,
a boy and girl.

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,320
That's the girl!

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
Her name is Marjorie.

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,840
She's fixin' to marry the boy
across the street, Bill Sherman.

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,640
Now that the war has ended,
he'll be home soon.

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,240
This is the Winfield boy, Wesley,
and, Max, the dog.

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,880
Okay, Max, now you're all fingerprinted.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,040
Okay, Gregory, you're next.

35
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,600
This is Gregory, the turkey.

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,160
Wesley is their second child.

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,160
If he'd been the first,
there never would have been a second.

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,240
Oh, you're probably wondering who I am.

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, don't be so nosy.

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,880
Alice! Alice! Look.

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,760
And on the front page, too.

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,080
"Private William Sherman,
of the 161st Infantry,

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,240
"has received his honorable discharge
and will soon be in our midst again."

44
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,760
Oh, isn't that wonderful, George?

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,520
Stella, go call Marjorie.

46
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Well, we'll be having a man
around the house again.

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,400
A young man.

48
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,160
Well, Mother,

49
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
the next time William Sherman's picture
is in the paper,

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,080
Marjorie's will be right along beside it.

51
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,560
I guess I've looked forward
to this wedding as much as they have.

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,800
More.

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,080
Well, don't make it sound
like I'm trying to get rid of Margie.

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,880
Being a responsible father,
I happen to be old-fashioned enough

55
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,560
to want to see our grown daughter
take her rightful position

56
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,320
- in the institution of marriage.
- I know, George,

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,080
but Marjorie's awfully young.
She's only 18.

58
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,600
Darling, you were only 18
when you were married.

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,280
But that's different. I'm her mother.

60
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes, dear.

61
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,320
I just heard the news
that Bill's coming home!

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,160
Isn't it wonderful?

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,960
It might be more wonderful
if he were coming home

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,240
to a charming, feminine young lady
instead of a grease monkey.

65
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,920
Father, somebody in this family
has to know about mechanics.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,440
This is the Machine Age!

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,120
I would appreciate it if you would
confine your genius to a sewing machine.

68
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,800
- Does it need fixing?
- That's not what your father meant.

69
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,920
When I patriotically consented
for you to work around Ike Hickey's Garage

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,600
during the emergency, I didn't intend
for you to make a career out of it.

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,080
Father...

72
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,920
- Oh, that must be Mr. Finley.
- I'll answer it, Stella. You get Wesley.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,920
Tell him it's time for his piano lesson.

74
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,960
That's not the way to get him.

75
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,480
- Good afternoon, Chester.
- Good afternoon, Marjorie.

76
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,880
- Sweets for the sweet.
- Oh, Chester.

77
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,440
Cream centers.

78
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,880
Really, you mustn't
bring me gifts all the time.

79
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
But, Marjorie,
we have been seeing a lot of each other.

80
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,600
Yes, I know, Chester,
and you've been such a good friend,

81
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,040
acting as my escort and taking me
to the church socials and everything.

82
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,080
Oh, and there's so much more I could do
for you, if you'd only let me.

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
Now, Chester, you promised.

84
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,240
I promised not to take advantage
of the situation

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,360
while my rival was overseas.

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,120
But now that he is coming home, well,
it's every man for himself.

87
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,480
- Isn't it time for Wesley's lesson?
- Oh...

88
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Oh, Wesley!

89
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,520
- Wesley!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,680
Wesley Winfield,
how many times have you been told...

91
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,640
Well, I got to keep my eye on him.
He's a suspect.

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,160
I know. I'll keep him in solitary for you
till you finish your piano lesson.

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,440
Come on, Gregory. You stay out
of the kitchen until Thanksgiving.

94
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,840
Come on.

95
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,080
- Wesley, Mr. Finley is here.
- I hate him.

96
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,320
Now, Wesley, you must learn
to be friendly with Mr. Finley.

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,480
Please, I prefer to keep it on this basis.

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,160
If you behave yourself,
you can have some chocolate.

99
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,920
Oh! After your lesson.

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
Remember this, George?

101
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,600
Mother!

102
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,160
Oh, Mother, it's beautiful.

103
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Stella!

104
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,320
Alice, I dare say,

105
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,440
I'll be as thrilled seeing Marjorie
in that dress as I was you.

106
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, Mother.
I only hope I look as pretty as you did.

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,920
Miss Marjorie, if you'll come upstairs
and wash that grime off of you,

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,320
- we'll have a fitting.
- In a minute, Stella.

109
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,040
Oh, Mother, I want Bill and his family
to be so proud of me.

110
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,200
They will be, dear.

111
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,560
You know, I was talking
to Mrs. Sherman only this morning

112
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,280
about our children getting married,

113
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,840
and she said, "You know,
we don't feel like we're losing a son,

114
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,400
"we feel like we're gaining a daughter."

115
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
- Isn't that sweet?
- Marjorie!

116
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm coming, Stella!

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,280
Well, I feel like I'm losing a son.

118
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,360
<i>My hometown is a one-horse town</i>

119
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,840
<i>But it's big enough for me</i>

120
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,440
<i>The population is scattered and small</i>

121
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,120
<i>You can't find the town on any map at all</i>

122
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,680
<i>But just the same</i>
<i>it means the world to me</i>

123
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,440
<i>To be with Mother and my family</i>

124

<i>But it's big enough for me</i>

126
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Everybody!

127
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
<i>My hometown is a one-horse town</i>

128
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,960

<i>Big enough for</i>

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,800
<i>Big enough for me</i>

137
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,520
That's a boy, Bill!

138
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,800
Hey, there's Miller's Pond.
We're almost home.

139
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,760
- Your girl meeting you at the station?
- No.

140
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,920
- No, I'm gonna surprise her.
- Mine's gonna be there.

141
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,160
- We're all set to get married.
- Married?

142
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,120
- You know, I'm supposed to get married.
- Supposed to?

143
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,880
Well, I mean, she thinks
that we're gonna get married right away.

144
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Oh.

145
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,600
But this hitch in the Army has given me
a more mature outlook on life.

146
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,640
I realize now
that there's more to marriage

147
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,480
than just two people being in love.
Why, there's responsibility.

148
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,560
A man should be established in a career,
secure,

149
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,840
prepared to meet his financial obligations.

150
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Do you know how many marriages
have gone on the rocks

151
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,560
just because two impulsive people
have set out on the sea of matrimony

152
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,160
in nothing more than a leaky rowboat?

153
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,600
I know that Marjorie and her folks
will understand.

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,240
- Hey, what's going on?
- It's 5:00.

155
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,480
- Wesley, what are you doing?
- It's 5:00.

156
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,680
Well, you might have at least
finished the piece.

157
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,600
- Wesley, give me that candy...
- Marjorie said.

158
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,720
- Cream centers.
- I know.

159
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,080
- Bill!
- Wesley! How are you?

160
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,680
- Bill, are we glad to see you.
- Hello, Mr. Winfield, Mrs. Winfield.

161
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,880
- How ya been?
- Gee, it's good to be home.

162
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,000
Your picture was in the paper,
right on the front page.

163
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,720
- I want to surprise Marjorie.
- Oh, yeah, come on in.

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,200
You go on in the living room.
I'll call Marjorie.

165
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,520
- Marjorie!
- Yes, Mother?

166
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,160
Come on down!

167
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,320
We want you to hear Wesley
play his new piece.

168
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,400
In a minute, Mother.

169
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,760
William, this is Fester Chinley.
Chester Finley.

170
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,280
- I'm glad to meet you, Chester.
- How do you do?

171
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
Chester's been dating Marjorie
ever since you left.

172
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
Yes, I know.
Marjorie told me in her letters.

173
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,040
And you don't know what a comfort
it is to a man overseas, Chester,

174
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,640
not to have to worry about his girl.

175
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,920
- Aren't you gonna bump him one?
- Wesley...

176
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,640
- Candy?
- Thank you, Mrs. Winfield.

177
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,880
Boy, this is one thing we missed overseas.

178
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,840
- Have one? Cream centers.
- I know.

179
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
I guess he doesn't like cream centers.

180
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,000
Chester's been giving Wesley
piano lessons.

181
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,440
He's coming along, slow but sure.

182
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,680
We'd hoped by now he progressed
far enough to play at your wedding.

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,640
Well, he'll still have time to learn.

184
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,560
Oh, we wouldn't want to postpone
your happiness

185
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,720
just because Wesley happens to have
two left hands. Not by a long shot, son.

186
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,640
Oh, Mother, it's beautiful.

187
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,960
Bill!

188
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,800
- Marjorie.
- This is a surprise.

189
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,520
Yeah.

190
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,040
- Marjorie, you look beautiful.
- Do I?

191
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,960
You know, the groom's not supposed
to see the bride like this

192
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,240
- until the day of the wedding.
- Yeah.

193
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,400
Well, I guess I better be getting home.
I haven't even seen the folks yet.

194
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,800
Will I see you tonight, Bill?
Well, there's a dance at the club.

195
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,480
Oh, fine. Fine.

196
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,480
And we've got a lot to talk about,
haven't we?

197
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,160
Yeah, lots.

198
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,480
Well...

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,640
Bill, you're all right, aren't you?

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,160
All right?

201
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,040
Well, you're acting so strange.

202
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,920
You weren't hurt or wounded or anything?

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,640
Oh, no. As a matter of fact,

204
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,720
the Germans surrendered
the day I landed in Paris.

205
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,000
I guess they knew you were coming.

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
- See you tonight.
- Yeah.

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,920
<i>I saw your eyes</i>

208
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,360
<i>Your wonderful eyes</i>

209
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,280
<i>With love light and tenderness beaming</i>

210
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,600
<i>They thrilled me through</i>

211
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,280
<i>They filled me, too</i>

212
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,120
<i>With wonderful dreams I am dreaming</i>

213
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,600
<i>No need to speak</i>

214
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,840
<i>No more shall I seek</i>

215
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,960
<i>For my heart has taught me their meaning</i>

216
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,400
<i>And love has come at last, I know</i>

217
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,760
<i>- Your eyes have told me so</i>
<i>- Your eyes have told me so</i>

218
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,760
Bill, would you like to go someplace
where we can talk?

219
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,320
- We haven't talked yet.
- Later.

220
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,040
It sure feels good dancing
with my girl like this.

221
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,040
Do you think you'll feel
the same way after?

222
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,240
- After?
- After we're married.

223
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,400
- You'll always be my girl.
- And you'll always be my husband.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,160
<i>No need to speak</i>

225
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,560
<i>No more shall I seek</i>

226
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,800
<i>For my heart has taught me their meaning</i>

227
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,000
<i>And love has come at last, I know</i>

228
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,040
<i>- Your eyes have told me so</i>
<i>- Your eyes have told me so</i>

229
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,160
Bill and Marjorie are sure making up
for lost time.

230
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
Hey, Bill,
when are you two gonna get hitched?

231
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,280
- Yeah, when is it gonna be?
- You set the date yet?

232
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,840
Come on, Bill, tell us about it.

233
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,080
Well, now, folks, friends,
as you can tell by just looking at us,

234
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,520
we can hardly wait.

235
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,720
I'm a mighty lucky fellow
to be getting a girl like Marjorie.

236
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,960
Not only because she is beautiful
and wonderful,

237
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,880
but because she is, well,
so understanding,

238
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,560
so practical and so intelligent.

239
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,320
How would you know, Bill?

240
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,280
Well, the thing of it is,
that we've decided to wait a while.

241
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,040
What are you gonna wait for, Bill?
What's the matter?

242
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,320
Well, after all,
I'm just a soldier back from the war.

243
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,840
And we've decided to be a little patient,
so I can get a job

244
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,320
and maybe save a little nest egg and...

245
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, as soon as we set the date,
why, you'll be the first to know.

246
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,280
- Marjorie, you're not angry, are you?
- I'm too intelligent to be angry.

247
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,240
- Marjorie, wait!
- We've decided to leave!

248
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,280
I understand. No leaky rowboat for us.

249
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,560
You know, once I get a job, why,
in no time at all we'll have that nest egg.

250
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,000
- Bill, how big an egg are you planning on?
- Just enough to give us a start.

251
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,120
A down payment on a house.

252
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,480
- Our own little home.
- Isn't that better than rushing things?

253
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,680
A little cottage, a picket fence,
a yard for the children.

254
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,440
Now who's rushing things?

255
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,520
- Must be out of gas.
- There is plenty of gas.

256
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,640
- We had a full tank when we left.
- Yeah. Probably a flat.

257
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,920
- Lf we had a flat, you'd feel it.
- Yeah.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,960
Say, I've got a hunch
the valve under the gas tank is jammed.

259
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,080
Yeah, I'd better have a look at it.

260
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,800
William, it's not in there.
Underneath the car.

261
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah.

262
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,360
Here you are.

263
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,840
- That about does it.
- Yeah.

264
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,040
Push her off the jack.

265
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,840
- Wait till I get out from under!
- Yeah. Here, I'll help you.

266
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,480
- There we go.
- Oh, dear.

267
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,240
Oh, my. Okay.

268
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,480
Push her off.

269
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,120
Start the motor, huh?

270
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,760
- We're okay now. I got her going.
- Yeah.

271
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,480
- Oh, here, let me help you.
- It's getting cold.

272
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
Gee, Marjorie,
you ruined your favorite dress.

273
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,760
My favorite dress is the one
you saw me in this afternoon.

274
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,920
Now, Marjorie,
I thought we settled all that.

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,120
You even said you'd be happy to wait
until I got a job.

276
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,680
I'm only teasing.

277
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,720
But you know something,
I was just thinking.

278
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,960
We'd only have to wait
half as long if I had a job

279
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,560
and was saving along with you.

280
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,800
The business world's
a man's world, Marjorie.

281
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,200
And women have no right forsaking
their sacred heritage to meddle in it.

282
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,440
Now they're even meddling in politics.

283
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,640
- I was just offering to help, that's all.
- Thank you, Marjorie.

284
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,240
But I intend becoming a capable provider,
a good husband

285
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,880
and a father, without any help from you!

286
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,520
I mean... Well, you know what I mean.

287
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,520
With your egotism, I'm not so sure.

288
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,800
You just don't believe in progress.

289
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
Why, you're getting to be
an old fuddy-duddy.

290
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,000
Fuddy-duddy?

291
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,240
Come on, Marjorie.
get in and we'll go home.

292
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,160
- I wouldn't ride in the same car with you.
- Now stop acting childish.

293
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,560
We're a mile from home,
and it's getting cold.

294
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,040
Well, isn't that just too bad?

295
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
Marjorie!

296
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,320
guess the children
will be home late tonight.

297
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,440
Well, Alice, after all,
the boy's been overseas,

298
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,480
and this is the first time he's been out
with his girl in a long time.

299
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,680
Didn't they look cute tonight
when they left?

300
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,480
William is a fine boy, a fine boy.

301
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,040
Marjorie.

302
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,480
- Marjorie?
- Bill and I had a fight.

303
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,840
- You won?
- George.

304
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,440
Darling, what did you quarrel about?

305
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,040
Mother, William Sherman
doesn't believe in women.

306
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,320
What?

307
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,000
Well, the next time his gas valve
gets jammed, he can fix it himself.

308
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,520
All I did was offer to go to work and help
so that we could get married real soon.

309
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,960
Oh, you discussed your wedding plans?

310
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,920
I've already talked to
the Palmer Printing Company

311
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,640
about turning out the invitations.

312
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,000
Are you and Bill planning
on a large wedding or a small one?

313
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,960
A small one. I won't be there.

314
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,470
Miss Marjorie is having one of her moods.

315
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,390
I'm going to have a talk with
that Sherman boy and find out

316
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,550
just how serious his intentions are.

317
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,910
Marjorie told me all about Bill's plans,
and I think it's admirable of him

318
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,790
to be so conscientious
about their future, I mean.

319
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,030
Well, I'll speak to Harris today.

320
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,030
See if we can find a spot for the boy
at the bank.

321
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,110
I don't like this waiting business.

322
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,470
Oh, George, this little spat is nothing.

323
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,710
Then why is Marjorie having a mood?

324
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,310
Because she's at the age
when girls are very emotional,

325
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,710
easily depressed,
given to fits of tears and despair.

326
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,390
It's the happiest time in a woman's life.

327
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,710
- get him!
- Wesley!

328
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,630
- It's only Gregory.
- Gregory?

329
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,150
You've been told to stop running the flesh
off of that turkey!

330
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,190
It's a good thing tomorrow
is Thanksgiving.

331
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,550
There'd be nothing left but feathers.

332
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,230
For the last time,
that turkey does not belong in the house.

333
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,390
If he's good enough to be on the table,
he's good enough to walk around it.

334
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,510
George, I'm afraid this is another crisis.

335
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,070
Wesley has become very attached
to our Thanksgiving dinner.

336
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,230
So it seems.

337
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,910
I think I'll send him to the movies
this afternoon,

338
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,830
and while he's gone I'll take
the turkey to the butcher to be prepared.

339
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,790
No, Alice. I don't believe
in sparing the boy with deceit.

340
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,390
When he does find out,
he'll only resent being tricked.

341
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,950
Wesley can take the turkey to the butcher.

342
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,990
- It's part of his growing up.
- Oh, but, George...

343
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,710
After all, it's my duty as a father
to make Wesley understand

344
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,790
that sentiment has its proper place.

345
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,430
Fish and fowl and most animals
are mainly created

346
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,390
for the sustenance of mankind.

347
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,390
A turkey is a turkey
and meant to be eaten.

348
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,070
- And you tell him that, Alice.
- George Winfield.

349
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,950
All right, I'll tell him.

350
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,910
I'll get it, Mother!

351
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,950
- Good morning, Marjorie.
- Good morning, Chester.

352
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,910
I realize it's rather early to be calling,
but ever since I heard the good news,

353
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,870
I could hardly wait to see you.

354
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,950
What news?

355
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,430
Well, some people who were at the dance
last night told me about you and Bill.

356
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,230
The postponement.

357
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,990
Really, Chester,
aren't you jumping to conclusions?

358
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,910
Well. Nevertheless,
it's all the encouragement I needed.

359
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,710
Look, I've written a song.

360
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,310
I've taken everything I ever felt
in my heart for you

361
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,030
and set it to music.

362
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,190
Wait till you hear it!

363
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:58,070
- Chester, isn't it kind of early?
- Not for me. I've been up all night.

364
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,790
<i>Be my little baby bumblebee</i>

365
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,630
<i>Bring home all the honey, love, to me</i>

366
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,630
<i>Let me spend the</i>...

367
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,310
Excuse me, Chester.

368
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,070
- Morning, Marjorie.
- Good morning, William.

369
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,030
I've been thinking about
our silly little quarrel last night,

370
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,030
and, well, I feel an apology is in order.

371
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,590
- Well, I should say it is.
- Well, go ahead and apologize.

372
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,390
Me?

373
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,390
Well, you called me an old fuddy-duddy.
I'm certainly not old,

374
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,870
and I'm neither a fuddy nor a duddy.
Now am I?

375
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,310
William, honestly.

376
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,590
- Who's that?
- It's Chester.

377
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,230
- He's been up all night.
- Here?

378
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,790
Of course not, silly. He's been working.
He's written a song.

379
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,430
Chester, would you play your song again?
Chester!

380
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,070
- I'd like to sing it now.
- Oh, of course.

381
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,110
- Marjorie...
- Chester, play your song.

382
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,550
<i>Be my little baby bumblebee</i>

383
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,030
<i>Buzz around, buzz around</i>
<i>keep a-buzzin'round</i>

384
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,230
<i>Bring home all the honey, love, to me</i>

385
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,670
<i>Little bee, little bee, little bumblebee</i>

386
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,710
<i>Let me spend the happy hours</i>

387
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,510

388
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,110

390
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,670

391
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,110
<i>Buzz around, buzz around</i>
<i>keep a-buzzin'round</i>

392
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,470
<i>- We'll be just as happy as can be</i>
<i>- Happy as can be</i>

393
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,750
<i>You and me, you and me, you and me</i>

394
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,910
<i>Honey, keep a-buzzin'please</i>

395
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,510
<i>I've got a dozen buzzin'bees</i>

396
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,870
<i>But I want you</i>

397
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,470
<i>To be my baby bumblebee</i>

398
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,030
Buzz, buzz.

399
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,910
- Chester, you know Bill?
- Good morning, Chester.

400
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,230
Yes, we've met.

401
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,830
Say, that's a wonderful song.

402
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,910
I wondered if you'd do me a favor
and play it again?

403
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,590
- Oh, won't you, Chester?
- Oh, yes.

404
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,510
<i>Be my little baby bumblebee</i>

405
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,990
<i>Buzz around, buzz around</i>
<i>keep a-buzzin'round</i>

406
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,150
<i>Bring home all the honey love to me</i>

407
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,030
<i>- Little bee, little bee, little bumblebee</i>
<i>- Little bee, little bee, little bumblebee</i>

408
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,630
<i>Let me spend the happy hours</i>

409
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,790
<i>Roving with you 'mongst the flowers</i>

410
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:53,190
<i>And when we get where no one else</i>
<i>can see</i>...

411
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,590
<i>Cuddle up, cuddle up</i>

412
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,830
<i>Come and cuddle up</i>

413
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,830
- We're forgetting Chester.
- That's a good idea.

414
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,510
- Chester, are you leaving?
- I'm not made of wood.

415
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,270
He's not?

416
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,990
- Oh, Wesley.
- Yes, sir?

417
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,230
- How would you like to earn $1?
- A dollar!

418
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:13,470
- Yes, I'd like you to run an errand for me.
- Can I take Gregory with me?

419
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,390
Yes, you can take Gregory with you.
I want you to go into town.

420
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,470
Sounds like a pretty long walk
for a turkey.

421
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,430
But if he gets tired,
I guess I can carry him back.

422
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,670
- Yes, you can carry Gregory back.
- Where do you want me to go, Pop?

423
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,630
- Wesley, you remember Grandpa?
- Yes, sir.

424
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,310
He was with us a long time,
and then he went away.

425
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,350
Son, we all have to go sometime.

426
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,750
Wesley, I've always tried
to be a good father.

427
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,670
You're not going anywhere, are you, Pop?

428
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,990
No.

429
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,750
But tomorrow is Thanksgiving and... And...

430
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,550
You want Gregory’s head chopped off
and his insides taken out

431
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,790
so you can eat him, don't you?

432
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,470
Now, please, Wesley,
you're making this very difficult.

433
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,390
Now you know perfectly well that
all your little chums and their families

434
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,870
all get turkeys
and fatten them for Thanksgiving.

435
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,710
Why, we even picked Gregory
because you said

436
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,390
he had the biggest drumsticks.

437
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,310
I bet he'd be good and fat
by next Thanksgiving.

438
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,030
- Please, Wesley.
- I'll bet we'd have the biggest,

439
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,390
fattest turkey in the whole country!

440
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,950
Now, we'll have no more talk.
I intend to be firm.

441
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,070
Yes, sir.

442
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,870
Now, you take that turkey to Mr. Schultz,
and you tell Mr. Schultz to...

443
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,070
- To...
- Yes, sir?

444
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,990
Now, you know perfectly well
what to tell him.

445
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,070
You couldn't have phrased it
more descriptively.

446
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,550
Wesley, some day, when you're a father,
you'll understand these things.

447
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,910
I'm never gonna be a father. I hate fathers.

448
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,390
At the moment,
I have no great love for them myself.

449
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,230
Come on, Max.

450
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,230
- Hey, Wesley, want to play with me?
- No, Pee Wee. I'm busy.

451
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,910
- And besides, you're too little.
- Can I play with Max?

452
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,310
- No.
- I'm bigger than him.

453
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,030
- Max has to go with me.
- Why?

454
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,110
'Cause tomorrow is Thanksgiving.

455
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,510
I'm taking him with me to Mr. Schultz,
the butcher.

456
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,310
- We're having turkey.
- So are we, stupid.

457
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,430
- Our turkey is all ready to cook.
- Go home, Pee Wee.

458
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,990
He's outside in our storeroom.
Want to see him?

459
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,630
No, Pee Wee, I...

460
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,750
Your turkey is outside in your storeroom?

461
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,070
- Yeah, want to see him?
- No, but...

462
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,350
- You want me to let you play with Max?
- Yeah.

463
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,390
Come here, Max. Here.

464
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,630
But you got to keep him in here
and stay here with him till I get back.

465
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,350
- Lf he tries to get out, I'll bite him.
- Good boy, Pee Wee.

466
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,270
Here are the signatures
on that Foley Lumber Mill loan.

467
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,070
The final escrow papers
on the Jackson deal.

468
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,470
And here's a letter from Indianapolis.

469
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,390
Some theatrical company would like
to rent the Grand Street opera house.

470
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,910
Good. We haven't realized a cent
from that theater

471
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,470
since we were appointed trustees.

472
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,830
That's true,
but since the church owns that property,

473
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,430
it's our obligation to investigate the show
and see if it's morally fit for Milburn.

474
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,990
This was enclosed in the letter.

475
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,230
Well, who says banking is a dull business?

476
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,590
Yes, well,
perhaps we'd better investigate this.

477
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,230
When Miss La Rue arrives in town,
I'll discuss the play with her

478
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,150
- before granting a lease on the theater.
- Fine.

479
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,510
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, John</i>.

480
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,950
- Oh, Emily.
<i>- Somebody stole our turkey</i>.

481
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,510
- Somebody what?
<i>- Stole our turkey</i>.

482
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,150
- Stole our turkey?
<i>- I can't stand any more of this</i>.

483
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,350
<i>- I'm at the end of my rope!</i>
- Emily, you must try to control yourself.

484
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,830
<i>You don't seem to be very upset</i>
<i>about this</i>.

485
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,990
- Yes, of course I'm upset, but...
<i>- But what?</i>

486
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,710
Well, the thing to do is call the butcher
and order another...

487
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,270
<i>- He hasn't got any left</i>.
- Oh, he hasn't?

488
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,830
- Well...
<i>- Well, what?</i>

489
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,030
- Well, let me call you back later.
<i>- I don't see any need to calling me back</i>.

490
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,790
<i>- Lf you can't talk about it now</i>...
- Yes, dear.

491
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,550
Have you ever heard
of anything so outrageous?

492
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,310
Never in my life.

493
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:48,750
- Say, how about having dinner with us?
- That'll settle everything.

494
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,310
- Sure we're not imposing?
- Not at all.

495
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,150
- We'll have enough for everyone.
- Fine.

496
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,790
I can't get over anyone low enough
to steal a Thanksgiving turkey.

497
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,510
Positively shocking.

498
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,910
Why, the way things are getting,
I sometimes wonder if this town

499
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,670
is a fit place for Wesley to grow up in.

500
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,350
<i>Every morning, every evening</i>

501
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,510
<i>Ain't we got fun?</i>

502
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,830
<i>Every summer</i>

503
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,230
<i>I'm sorry</i>

504
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,510
<i>Ain't we got fun?</i>

505
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,950
<i>When I first saw you</i>

506
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,270
<i>I had but one thought</i>

507
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,190
<i>And then you chased me</i>

508
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,510
<i>Until you were caught</i>

509
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,230
<i>From the day I whispered</i>

510
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,230
<i>'"May I please hold your hand? '"</i>

511
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,430
<i>You progressed and I'm impressed</i>

512
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,510
<i>And I think you're grand</i>

513
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,670
<i>We're really living</i>

514
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,350
<i>We've got a fat turkey</i>
<i>for a fine Thanksgiving</i>

515
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,550
<i>Shut the door, please</i>

516
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,030
<i>Don't get sore, please</i>

517
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,750
<i>Ain't we got fun?</i>

518
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,390
<i>- Let's all have fun</i>
<i>- Let's all have fun</i>

519
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,270
<i>I got a yearning to tango with you</i>

520
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:30,870
<i>Casanova, please come over</i>
<i>if you have time</i>

521
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,590
<i>You know you're my one and only</i>

522
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,150
<i>That doesn't rhyme!</i>

523
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,110
<i>I'm not too clever</i>
<i>But I'd like to say those words forever</i>

524
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,670
<i>Thank you, kind sir, I don't mind, sir</i>

525
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,190
<i>- Ain't we got fun?</i>
<i>- Ain't we got fun?</i>

526
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,110
Fun.

527
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,630
That's enough. I'm dizzy!

528
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,990
I shall get you some water, madam.

529
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,590
I think I should shell some more peas.

530
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,830
With the Harrises coming,
that's three more people.

531
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,270
More people, more dishes.

532
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,750
Oh, Stella.

533
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,390
Well, this is quite a picture.

534
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,070
You know, sometimes I think
the preparation is actually more fun

535
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,750
than the dinner itself.

536
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,150
Say, I'm baking the pies.

537
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,390
- Wanna taste the filling?
- Sure.

538
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,190
- Fine cook, Marjorie.
- Yeah.

539
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,670
It looks good. When will it be ready?

540
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,990
I don't know. I've never cooked one
with the door open before.

541
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,510
I only hope Wesley doesn't make a scene.

542
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,310
Oh, he's been wonderful
about the turkey so far.

543
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,150
He hasn't said a word
since he came home from the butcher.

544
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,550
I'm glad he's taking it so well.

545
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,110
Of course, the real test will come
when he sees Gregory in this condition.

546
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,110
- Well, everything looks good.
- Smells good, too.

547
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,350
Where's the turkey?

548
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,790
- Ronald!
- Pee Wee!

549
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,270
Oh, yes, the turkey. I...

550
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,750
- Turkey ready, Stella?
- There it is.

551
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,430
Well, I think they're waiting.

552
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,470
I'm not gonna be the pallbearer.

553
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,470
Oh, put it down here, Bill.

554
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,190
My, what a delicious-looking bird!

555
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,710
I want a drumstick!

556
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,150
Now, Ronald, it isn't polite to ask.

557
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,470
After all, this isn't our turkey.

558
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,230
That's right, Son.

559
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,630
You might, at least,
wait for the bird to be carved.

560
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,470
I want a drumstick, too.

561
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,950
Certainly, dear!

562
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,470
I'll take care of this myself.

563
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,870
- It's a pleasure, sir.
- Stella, everything’s fine.

564
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,590
You boys are both gonna get a drumstick.

565
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,550
I want mine first!

566
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,550
Ronald!

567
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,750
- The pie is delicious, Stella.
- It certainly is.

568
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,550
There's plenty more.

569
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,950
I think it's just wonderful of you,
Mr. Harris, to give Bill a job at the bank.

570
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,510
I haven't had any banking experience, sir,
but I hope I can make good.

571
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,550
Of course, you can.

572
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,350
All you have to do is be able to add
and look real honest.

573
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,230
I mean, the banking business
offers a fine opportunity for a young man.

574
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,470
Yes, it certainly does.

575
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,030
Remember, Winfield,
we were about young Sherman's age

576
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,270
when we started out
at the old Olive Street branch.

577
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,910
Yes, that's right. I was chief teller and
remember, J.H., you were my assistant.

578
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,110
Your assistant?

579
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:49,790
Yes, and Mrs. Harris was the daughter
of V.A. Stonan, the founder of our First...

580
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,910
- More dessert, anyone?
- Yes.

581
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,310
- No, thank you.
- I'm full.

582
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,430
This dinner's so good, I'm almost glad
that someone stole our turkey.

583
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,150
Anyone who'd commit a crime like that
should be tarred and feathered.

584
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,630
You're right.

585
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,150
If you ask me, he should be
strung-up like a common horse thief.

586
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,950
You know, I'll bet Wesley could tell us
who stole that turkey.

587
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,790
Quite a detective, our Wesley.

588
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,550
This is one Thanksgiving
I'll always remember.

589
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,430
Not only for the joy and comfort

590
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,390
I found in the company
of my friends and family but...

591
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,710
Come here, Son.

592
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,230
But because of the strength in character
I found in my son.

593
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,630
Somebody help me.

594
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,550
What's the matter? Come here, now!

595
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,710
Go on! get!

596
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,350
Wesley!

597
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,590
Wesley!

598
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,070
May I be excused?

599
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,150
What can you do?

600
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,510
George, don't be upset about it, please.

601
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,990
Alice, this is one time
I wish you wouldn't interfere.

602
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,390
George, don't get yourself all worked up.

603
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,830
You've said 100 times,
"Boys will be boys."

604
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,590
I know, but does he have to be
one of the James boys?

605
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,070
He was only trying
to protect the life of his pet.

606
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,950
Try to have a little understanding.

607
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,630
Why, when you were Wesley's age,
you ran away from home.

608
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,590
And I'm thinking of doing it again.

609
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,950
Perhaps you can take this lightly, Alice,
but I can't.

610
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,670
George, he's been
punished enough already.

611
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,550
The humiliation and the fright...

612
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,790
Let's be happy
everything turned out so well.

613
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,630
Let's be happy I have a boss
with a sense of humor.

614
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,550
I once married a man
with a sense of humor.

615
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,830
I'll bet you by next Thanksgiving

616
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,070
we'll have the fattest turkey
in the whole country.

617
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,150
I'll bet you.

618
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,990
My father used to sing this song
to my mother when he was courting her.

619
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,110
I'm glad they got together.

Oh, Father, you look positively handsome!

What's Pop getting all spruced up for?

665
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,550
Your father has a date
with a beautiful actress.

666
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,710
Your father happens
to have a business appointment

with a prospective client
who wishes to lease some property

held by the First National Bank.

669
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:14,510
I wish you'd all stop staring at me
as though I were a gay old dog.

670
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,630
Be on guard, Banker Winfield.

671
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,510
Perhaps this beautiful temptress
will use her charms

672
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,710
to learn the secret combination
of the First National vault.

673
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,790
Fear not, fair damsel,
I've toyed with these jezebels before!

674
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,670
Shall I wait up for you, George?

675
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,430
If you wish. I won't be late.

And you will approve the lease?

723
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,000
Well, I only found one speech in the play
that might be objectionable.

724
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,200
However, I've copied it here
and I'll discuss it with Mr. Harris.

725
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
Objectionable speech?

726
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Yes, at the end of the first act, when
the American soldier says to Marlene,

727
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,840
<i>'"Ma cherie,</i> I shall forever
cherish the memory of last night.

728
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,960
"The thrill of your response
to my admiration

729
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,920
"made me realize
that we belong together always.

730
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,240
"The thought of one of us being married
to another is most agonizing,

731
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,200
"but perhaps soon love will find a way."

732
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,040
And this is objectionable?

733
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,720
Well, in the first act,
we learn the American soldier is married.

734
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Therefore, when he speaks of
spending the rest of his life with Marlene,

735
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,680
it hints of the most controversial subject
of this postwar period, divorce.

736
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,680
But, <i>Monsieur Winfield,</i> we have
toured most of the big cities and...

737
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,200
Well, unfortunately,
Milburn is not a big city.

738
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,280
Not that I personally have
a small-town attitude about things.

739
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:00,200
Then perhaps you can persuade Mr. Harris
to leave this little speech in the play.

740
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,200
Well, I will see what I can do.

741
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,480
<i>Merci</i>.

742
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,760
Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you,
Miss La Rue.

743
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,040
Well, for me,
it has been a pleasant surprise.

744
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,600
I have never met so charming a banker.

745
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,320
Oh, I just drifted into banking.

746
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,560
<i>Merci</i>.

747
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,040
<i>Au revoir, Monsieur</i>.

748
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,520
Aren't you gonna tell us
about Miss La Rue, Father?

749
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,160
A very fascinating woman.

750
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,840
And she never met so charming a banker.

751
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,480
Of course,
that's because she hasn't seen Bill yet.

752
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,320
Oh, I don't know.

753
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,440
By the way,
how is William doing at the bank?

754
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,720
Quite competent, and lots of ideas.

755
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,840
In fact, since he's been there,
our suggestion box has been jammed.

756
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,160
See that?

757
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,800
<i>- Merci</i>.
<i>- Merci?</i>

758
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,120
French toast.

759
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,000
Say, listen to this.

760
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,920
"This year's annual charity dance,

761
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,200
"sponsored by the local chapter
of the Y.M.C.A.,

762
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,240
"promises to be one of
the gayest social events of the year.

763
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,360
"Highlighting the evening’s entertainment
will be the musical offerings of

- I thank you.

765
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,360
"...accompanied by Chester Finley,
musical director."

766
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,600
Wesley!

767
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,480
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, dear.

768
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,960
Listen, there's some clothes to go
to the cleaners upstairs in our room.

769
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,480
Would you drop them off
on your way to school?

770
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,000
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,880
I have a dress to go, too. Excuse me!

772
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,160
Isn't it exciting,
Marjorie entertaining at the Y?

773
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,520
Talented girl, Marjorie.

774
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,760
Going to make a wonderful bride,
a wonderful bride.

775
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,120
They're on the chair.

776
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,720
Here, Wesley.

777
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,560
Hey, Sis, what's this mean? <i>'"Ma cherie'"?</i>

778
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,240
- Wesley, where did you get this?
- Father's suit.

779
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,200
Father's suit?

780
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,600
Wesley! Oh, Wesley!

781
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,920
Yes, sir.

782
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,880
I forgot something.

783
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,560
Bank business.

784
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,080
Stella, I can't believe it.

785
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,360
I'll bet she's a bank crook,
just like you said!

786
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,760
Wesley, you mustn't mention this
to a soul, do you hear?

787
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,160
Especially not to Mother.

788
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,840
In fact, you mustn't even think about it.
Do you promise me?

789
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,440
- I promise.
- All right, now get going.

790
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,960
And remember, Stella, this is a secret!

791
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,840
Stella, this is terrible.

792
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,160
Poor Father, and that awful woman!

793
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,120
Well, I've been cleaning up around here
for years.

794
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,600
I guess I can handle this mess.

795
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,440
But this is positively scandalous!

796
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,240
Why, if this ever gets out...

797
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,800
Oh, dear.

798
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,720
I just hope and pray
we can keep it in the family.

799
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,000
Our biggest job
is to keep the family in the family.

800
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,440
Marjorie, Stella.

801
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,440
I could hardly wait for your father
to leave this morning.

802
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,840
Can you two keep a secret?

803
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,360
- Secret?
- Secret?

804
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,400
Tomorrow is our anniversary,

805
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,160
and I bought this for your father.

806
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,720
Isn't that a lovely watch!

807
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,320
Look at the back.

808
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,440
"To George, with love, Alice."

809
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,840
Oh, my.

810
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,040
Twenty years, and it seems like yesterday.

811
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,760
Mother, are you sure you did
the right thing marrying Father?

812
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,640
What? Why, Marjorie!

813
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,640
Well, what I mean is,

814
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,560
well, I'll bet you had a lot of beaus.

815
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,120
Oh, yeah, there were
a few young men interested in me.

816
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,600
What about Father?

817
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,320
- Was he popular with the girls?
- Oh, quite.

818
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,080
Oh, you'd be surprised at the number
of times I'd be out with your father

819
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,480
and I'd catch some girl giving him a wink.

820
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,200
You sure she wasn't just winking back?

821
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,720
Why, Stella, how can you say that?

822
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,680
I assure you
Mr. Winfield was not flirtatious.

823
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,280
- Was he romantic?
- Oh, when he set his mind to it.

824
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,440
I'll never forget the night he proposed.

825
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,240
I knew it was gonna be a special occasion
because when he came to call,

826
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,160
he'd rented a horse-drawn sleigh
from Hickey's stable.

827
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,040
And Ike Hickey himself was our driver.
Our own driver, mind you.

828
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,640
We drove to Miller's Pond.

829
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,000
It was beautiful,
a full moon shining on the ice,

830
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,000
people skating, bonfires.

831
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,240
- Was that when he proposed?
- Oh, he tried to, several times.

832
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,120
But finally, when we were leaving
and he was helping me off with my skates,

833
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,360
he looked up kind of sheepishly
and he said,

834
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,880
"Alice, as long as I'm down here
on my knees,

835
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,640
"would you accept this as a proposal?"

836
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,920
Your father was never one
for flowery speeches or pretty words.

837
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,320
Mr. Hickey!

838
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,440
There you are, folks, she's all ready to see!

839
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,520
Oh, isn't it picturesque?

840
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,960
Yep, with a little polish and elbow grease
and she'll look as good as new.

841
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,400
Oh, thanks, Mr. Hickey.

842
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,760
Come on, Bill, get in.

843
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,840
Would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

844
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,320
- Well, can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

845
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,640
Mother and Father are celebrating
their 20th anniversary tomorrow.

846
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,920
And we've planned a big surprise,

847
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,360
- haven't we, Mr. Hickey?
- Yes.

848
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Bill, this sleigh is the same one

849
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,760
that Father took Mother out in
the night he proposed.

850
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,200
So we're taking them out in it
tomorrow night.

851
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,480
And we're gonna have the very
same driver, too, aren't we, Mr. Hickey?

852
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,240
Yep. Never will forget that night
on the way home from Miller's Pond.

853
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,200
I could hear every word they were saying.

854
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,640
They was making plans for the wedding.

855
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:23,040
Your ma was sitting right where you are,
and your pa was sitting right there.

856
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,720
Don't be self-conscious.
He's discussing Mother and Father, not us.

857
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,640
Well, pretty soon,
we'll be able to discuss us.

858
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,480
And maybe a lot sooner than you think.

859
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,120
Look, you don't have to humor me,
William Sherman.

860
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,280
Goodness gracious, you'd think
you were the only boy in the whole world.

861
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,760
Say, that's not a bad idea,
especially if you were the only girl.

862
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,480
We wouldn't even have to get married.

863
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,320
I mean, there'd be nobody here
to marry us.

864
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:56,680
<i>If you were the only girl</i>

865
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,880
<i>In the world</i>

866
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:05,040
<i>And you were the only boy</i>

867
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,040
<i>Nothing else would matter</i>

868
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,560
<i>In the world today</i>

869
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,440
<i>We could go on loving</i>

870
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,800
<i>In the same old way</i>

871
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,480
<i>A Garden of Eden</i>

872
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,000
<i>Just made for two</i>

873
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:34,000
<i>With nothing to mar our joy</i>

874
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,600
<i>I would say</i>

875
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,160
<i>Such wonderful things to you</i>

876
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,440
<i>And there would be</i>

877
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,400
<i>Such wonderful things to do</i>

878
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,680
<i>If you were the only girl</i>

879
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,560
<i>In the world</i>

880
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,960
<i>And you were</i>

881
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:06,640
<i>The only boy</i>

882
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,920
Say, I better get back to the bank.
It's way past my lunch hour.

883
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,520
Oh, Bill. Remember,
not one word about this to Father.

884
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,800
I hope he doesn't forget about
that anniversary.

885
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,600
You know how men are!

886
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,440
I'm sure he hasn't.

887
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,960
You should have seen him this morning.

888
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,640
Here he is
celebrating his 20th wedding anniversary,

889
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,520
and to look at him you'd think
he was a man just fallen in love!

890
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,760
Well, what's the matter? Come on.

891
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,080
- What did we do that for?
- I can't tell you.

892
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,280
- Why?
- You're too little.

893
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,960
Bet you I'm bigger than you was
when you was little!

894
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,640
- Hello, Marjorie.
- Hello.

895
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,840
- Where's your mother?
- Your wife is upstairs.

896
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,400
- Hello, Wesley.
- Hello.

897
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,920
- Good evening, Stella.
- Good evening.

898
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,400
Marjorie, William has some rather
exciting news, but he can tell you himself.

899
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,800
It wouldn't be fair of me
to take the edge off of his surprise.

900
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,040
- Evening, George.
- Alice!

901
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,800
My!

902
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,960
- Don't we look lovely!
- Mother looks lovely!

903
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,000
Mother, I'll set the table.

904
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,960
George, the children
have been spoiling me.

905
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Marjorie's been fussing
with my hair all afternoon,

906
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,320
keeping me out of the kitchen,

907
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,920
and Wesley insisted on doing
the marketing and polishing the silver.

908
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,880
I'm being treated
as though I were a queen.

909
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,200
You are a queen,
and that's straight from the king.

910
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,600
Henry VIII!

911
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,360
Mother, sometimes I overlook
our children's peculiar behavior.

912
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,000
But considering Stella's in our employ,

913
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,200
don't you think, at times,
she's a little outspoken?

914
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,680
Oh, she's been with us so long,
she feels like one of the family.

915
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,360
I wish I felt like that.

916
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,520
Oh, George.

917
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,280
Mom, have you seen
the key to my handcuffs?

918
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,360
- Oh, my word.
- Did you look in your pockets?

919
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,800
I can't.

920
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,480
It's only rubber.

921
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,360
- The top of a fountain pen?
- I can trade it for something.

922
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,560
Oh.

923
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,480
- Is this...
- That's it. Put it in my teeth.

924
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,680
Well, I think this will do it.

925
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,640
Oh, George, why don't you leave
your work at the bank?

926
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,200
Miss La Rue wants to take over
the theater for rehearsal tomorrow.

927
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,560
I have to get these papers to her tonight
for her signature.

928
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,440
- You're going to that actress lady?
- I have to deliver these papers.

929
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,520
I won't be long, dear.

930
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,880
I think I'll run next door to Mrs. Gaston.
She wants to copy these patterns.

931
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,400
I'll probably be gone when you get back.

932
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,640
All right, dear, but I think
it's a shame you have to go out

933
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,880
after working so hard all day.

934
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,480
Father, if you have some papers
you want delivered,

935
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,360
I can drop them off
on my way to the dance.

936
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,400
I wouldn't think of it.
The Y is way on the other side of town.

937
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,160
I could run them over for you
in a few minutes in the machine.

938
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,320
- Stella, you can't even drive a machine.
- You know how quick I pick up things.

939
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,920
I'm overwhelmed at all this attention,
but I think...

940
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,800
Can I go, Pop?
I like to run errands, really do.

941
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,440
Well, that's very considerate of you,
Wesley...

942
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,880
Please, Pop?

943
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,160
Well, all right.

944
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,280
Now, let's see.

945
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,440
These papers are for the lease,
and there was something else.

946
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,360
But I have a note that'll take care of that.

947
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,920
get your hat and coat.

948
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,680
Well, go on, Wesley, get your hat and coat.

949
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,960
Yes, sir.

950
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,480
Hey, Ma.

951
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,600
- What does "delete" mean?
- "Delete" means "to take out."

952
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,000
- "Take out," huh?
- Yes, why?

953
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,760
Oh, nothing.

954
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,720
Hey, Marjorie! You remember that note
we found this morning?

955
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,760
What about it?

956
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,240
Well, Pop wants me
to bring that to her, too!

957
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,000
Stella, I've been worried
about that note all day.

958
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,840
It's bad enough Father wrote it,
but I still had hopes he'd never send it.

959
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,640
He even put some more on it,
something about taking her out.

960
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,360
- What?
- What did you say?

961
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,120
Wesley, that woman
must never get that note!

962
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,640
You take it and you burn it,
you understand?

963
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,720
Okay, Sis.

964
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,040
Now, remember this,
you can take the papers,

965
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,640
but not one word about that note.

966
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,960
He told me to get her signature,
but I'll get her fingerprints, too.

967
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,360
I still think she's a bank crook!

968
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,840
Now, Miss Marjorie,
don't get yourself all shook up.

969
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,640
- Bill's coming over.
- I'd better get dressed.

970
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,640
He's got a big surprise for you.
Remember, your father said so.

971
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,760
Probably about your wedding.

972
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,800
The only wedding I'm interested in
is the one that took place 20 years ago.

973
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,200
Now, have Miss La Rue sign these
and bring them back.

974
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,160
And give her this.
Tell her it's very important.

975
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,200
Yes, sir.

976
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,680
Now, remember,
you're to come straight home.

977
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,880
We don't wanna give Mother
anything to worry about.

978
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:36,120
<i>Just one girl, only just one girl</i>

979
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:43,000
<i>There are others, I know</i>
<i>But they're not my pearl</i>

980
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:49,760
<i>Sun or rain, she is just the same</i>

981
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:56,280
<i>I'll be happy forever</i>
<i>With just one little girl</i>

982
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,800
<i>To be married, we're old enough plenty</i>

983
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,680
<i>She and I, she and I</i>

984
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,640
<i>She is 18 and I will be 20</i>

985
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,440
<i>By and by, by and by</i>

986
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,480
<i>Although we are short as to money</i>

987
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,200
<i>What care we? What care we?</i>

988
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,440
<i>There are only two flies in the honey</i>

989
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,160
<i>Just one little girl and me</i>

990
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:36,920
<i>Just one girl, only just one girl</i>

991
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,440
<i>There are others, I know</i>
<i>But they're not my pearl</i>

992
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:50,480
<i>Sun or rain, she is just the same</i>

993
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:57,440
<i>I'll be happy forever with just one girl</i>

994
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,640
<i>One girl</i>

995
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,960
<i>One girl</i>

996
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,320
Well, my girl.

997
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,320
- You're early, Bill.
- Yes.

998
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,440
- I'll get dressed right away.
- I could hardly wait to get here.

999
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,440
Marjorie Winfield, come here!

1000
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,680
- William!
- Just rehearsing.

1001
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,840
There's big news tonight, Mother.

1002
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,680
- There you are!
- William, what in the world?

1003
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,560
Allow me, madam,
to explain this enthusiasm.

1004
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,280
My first day in our loan department,

1005
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,400
and already I've endorsed
three important loans!

1006
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,920
One for $2,500
to the Central Furniture Company.

1007
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,040
A $1,000 personal loan
to a Jack Sprawling.

1008
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,200
He wanted to get married.

1009
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,880
And do you know to whom
I endorsed the third loan?

1010
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,960
No.

1011
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,640
William Francis Sherman.

1012
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,480
- You mean, you made a loan at the bank?
- Sure.

1013
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,880
I sort of got the idea
from this Sprawling fellow.

1014
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,000
You see, instead of putting away a little
each week and saving toward a nest egg,

1015
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,480
I borrow the nest egg.

1016
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,920
Now, I pay a little back each week.

1017
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,720
Marjorie, do you realize what this means?

1018
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,840
Instead of waiting,
why, we can be married right away!

1019
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,600
- Right away?
- Sure.

1020
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,240
- Oh, Marjorie, aren't you excited?
- Oh, yes, I am, Bill.

1021
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,760
But... Well, this is so sudden.

1022
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,440
Sudden? You told me you couldn't wait.

1023
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,240
Oh, yes, I know I did, Bill,
but, well, things are different now.

1024
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,280
What I mean is, I must have time to think.

1025
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,960
Think? You mean, you don't want to...

1026
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,720
- Marjorie, is there somebody else?
- No.

1027
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,160
Another man?

1028
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,840
Say, you don't know a Jack Sprawling,
do you?

1029
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,840
Oh, no. Of course not.

1030
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,400
Bill, it's so difficult for me
to ask you to understand,

1031
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,480
but I can't possibly think
of marrying you right now.

1032
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,360
And I can't tell you why.

1033
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,800
What do you mean, you can't tell me?
Why, I'm almost your husband!

1034
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,400
- At least I thought I was.
- You will be someday.

1035
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,160
But for now, Bill, couldn't you please
be sweet and understanding?

1036
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,320
But I don't wanna be sweet
and understanding!

1037
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,920
I want to be a husband!

1038
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,920
Bill.

1039
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,520
It never entered my mind, Marjorie,
that you ever had any doubt

1040
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,760
about your feelings toward me.

1041
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,000
But now everything’s quite obvious.

1042
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,680
You're not even sure
I'm the man you want to marry.

1043
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,000
Oh, William, I've been working
on Marjorie's wedding invitations,

1044
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,080
- and I thought...
- Be sure and send me one, sir.

1045
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,840
I'd like to find out who she ends up with.

1046
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,720
The Palmer Printing Company
must think I'm an idiot!

1047
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,960
You want to tell Mother about it?

1048
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,720
Mother, Bill wants
to get married right away.

1049
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,360
- Well, isn't that what you wanted?
- Well, yes, I did, but...

1050
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,840
- Mother, I don't want to leave you.
- Oh, darling.

1051
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,480
What I mean is, it's so strange
leaving the family and everything.

1052
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,760
I feel so at home here.

1053
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,240
We've gotten used to you, too.

1054
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,440
And this is where you belong
until you're good and ready to leave.

1055
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,800
- Got it pressed.
- Oh, good.

1056
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,160
- Well, what was the big surprise?
- Bill wants to get married right away.

1057
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,200
Oh!

1058
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,200
Stella, you know
I can't leave my mother now,

1059
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,720
not with this situation with Father.

1060
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,880
Does Bill know?

1061
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,360
No. It's so awful I couldn't tell him.

1062
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,600
I just acted vague
about not wanting to get married.

1063
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,160
Poor Bill, he didn't know what to think.

1064
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,120
Maybe I should have a talk with my father
right now.

1065
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,280
Oh, no, that would never do.

1066
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,800
Why, when this blows over,
he'd be embarrassed for life

1067
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,840
to know you children knew
about his foolishness.

1068
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,800
I hope it's just foolishness.

1069
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,360
Now you listen to me, Miss Marjorie.
There's no fool like an old fool.

1070
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,680
Especially an old fool who isn't too old
to act like a young fool again.

1071
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,280
Now, come on, you're supposed to be
the belle of the ball tonight.

1072
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,360
Some belle. I don't even have an escort.

1073
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,600
Now, Miss Marjorie, you have to go.
You're on the plate tonight.

1074
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,880
Now come on, get into your dress.

1075
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,240
All right.

1076
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,600
But my heart isn't in it.

1077
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,960
Well, as long as you get the rest of you in
it, you won't have to worry about escorts.

1078
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,880
Yes?

1079
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,240
I'm Wesley Winfield.

1080
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,360
My father sent these papers
to be signed by you from the bank.

1081
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,000
- Oh, you're Mr. Winfield's little boy?
- Yes, ma'am.

1082
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,760
Well, you are a fine-looking boy.
Handsome like your father.

1083
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,080
My father isn't handsome.
He looks real funny in the morning.

1084
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,400
Oh, I guess
we all look funny in the morning.

1085
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,520
My mother doesn't. She's real beautiful!

1086
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,400
Well, I'm sure she is.

1087
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,200
Won't you come in?

1088
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,600
- May I take your hat?
- Don't bother.

1089
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,000
- I'm sorry...
- Don't worry about it.

1090
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,720
Sit down while I look at these papers.

1091
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,080
Would you like an apple?

1092
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,600
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right, help yourself.

1093
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,440
You hand it to me.

1094
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,640
- I'm gonna eat it later.
- Oh.

1095
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,960
Wesley,

1096
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,440
I thought perhaps you might like
some cream soda.

1097
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,920
Here are all the papers signed
and everything is <i>magnifique</i>.

1098
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,080
<i>Magnifique</i> means wonderful.

1099
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,680
That is French.

1100
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,200
Were you ever a spy?

1101
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,840
Oh, in my profession,
I have been many things,

1102
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,280
a spy, a wicked gypsy.

1103
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,320
- Once I was even a lady bandit.
- A lady bandit?

1104
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:34,200
But that venture only lasted two weeks,
so I prefer to keep it a secret.

1105
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,600
- Who's that?
- My associates.

1106
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,960
Your gang?

1107
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,520
You may come in.

1108
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,080
- I hope we're not intruding.
- It's quite all right.

1109
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,640
Well, we've got everything set.

1110
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,440
Gentlemen, this is Wesley Winfield,
the banker's little boy.

1111
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,600
How are you, Wesley?

1112
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,360
- Hello.
- Hello, there.

1113
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,760
Oh, I see you're wearing your badge.

1114
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,800
Hey, fellows,
did you know this man's a detective?

1115
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,880
- A detective?
- Well...

1116
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,240
What's the matter, Wesley?

1117
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,840
Stand back!

1118
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,520
- Hello, Wesley.
- Oh, Bill.

1119
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,240
I'm sorry I frightened you.

1120
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,840
I had a little quarrel with your sister,

1121
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,400
and I was just waiting for her to get home
from the dance.

1122
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,200
What are you doing?

1123
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,000
- Marjorie told me to burn this letter.
- Oh.

1124
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,240
Hey, what are you doing? Give me it.

1125
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,080
"The thrill of your
response to my admiration..."

1126
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,400
Don't, please.

1127
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,440
Well, this explains a lot of things.

1128
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,160
- Wesley, who sent this letter?
- I can't tell you. It's a secret.

1129
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,600
Well, it's not fair of me to pump you.

1130
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,160
I'll get my information
direct from <i>'"ma cherie. '"</i>

1131
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,480
Oh, Bill.

1132
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:08,290
It's a full house.
Come on, get in your places.

1133
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:32,530
<i>When the sun begins to rise</i>

1134
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,210
<i>And there's a light in the eastern skies</i>

1135
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:37,170
<i>You'll hear a rooster crow</i>

1136
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:39,530
<i>All the animals appear</i>

1137
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:41,290
<i>When they hear that cry of Chanticleer</i>

1138
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,930
<i>They're up and on the go</i>

1139
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:47,010
Howdy there, folks.

1140
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:48,810
Say, how you been?

1141
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:52,050
Good morning, lady. My, aren't we thin?

1142
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:55,290
Hey, there, fella, let me see that grin.

1143
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:58,330
<i>It's time for the jubilee</i>

1144
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:11,450
<i>Round the barnyard</i>
<i>Goes the mighty cavalcade</i>

1145
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:13,130
<i>Gorgeously arrayed</i>

1146
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:15,090
<i>See them on parade</i>

1147
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:17,810
<i>All the animals assemble there</i>

1148
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:21,170
<i>As the break of day draws near</i>

1149
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,930
<i>Then the crickets</i>
<i>Birds and bees upon the wing</i>

1150
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,650
<i>Soon begin to sing</i>

1151
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,290
<i>Hear the chorus ring</i>

1152
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:29,810
<i>Though they often try</i>

1153
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:34,170
<i>They never beat the cry of Chanticleer</i>

1154
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,170
<i>See the turkey chicken reel without a care</i>

1155
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,010
<i>And the chicken there</i>

1156
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,490
<i>Do the grizzly bear</i>

1157
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:51,290
<i>While the goat begins to castle rock</i>

1158
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:54,370
<i>Till you want to stand and cheer</i>

1159
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:58,490
<i>When the ducks</i>
<i>begin to do the turkey trot</i>

1160
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:01,810
<i>And they get plenty hot</i>
<i>Give it all they've got</i>

1161
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,450
<i>But they can't compete</i>

1162
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:07,650
<i>With the strutting feet of Chanticleer</i>

1163
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:58,250
<i>Life is fine when you rise and shine</i>

1164
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:00,810
<i>With the king of the barnyard</i>

1165
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:08,970
<i>King Chanticleer</i>

1166
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:26,290
Hello, Marjorie. You were wonderful.

1167
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:27,850
You were wonderful.

1168
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:29,330
You were wonderful.

1169
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:32,090
Marjorie! You're not leaving?

1170
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:35,010
Oh, Chester, please forgive me,
but I'm not in the best of spirits tonight.

1171
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:36,410
Bill!

1172
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:39,450
Marjorie, there's no need to be mysterious
any longer, Marjorie.

1173
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:41,450
I happen to know now
why you can't marry me.

1174
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:42,490
Huh?

1175
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:43,610
A fine thing.

1176
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:47,410
A soldier overseas and his sweetheart
carrying on with another man.

1177
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:49,010
What are you saying?

1178
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:51,490
Why, you know perfectly well
the only man I saw while you were away

1179
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:55,450
- was Chester Finley.
- I thought it was you.

1180
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:56,930
There I was fighting for democracy,

1181
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,570
and you were supposed
to keep the home fires burning.

1182
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:01,890
Well, apparently,
you two didn't even need a fire.

1183
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:03,450
- Why, I ought to...
- Bill.

1184
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:06,410
Now, Marjorie,
you don't have to defend me.

1185
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:09,090
If you're worth having,
you're worth fighting for.

1186
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:12,730
Well, I'm glad you feel that way because
you and I are going in the locker room.

1187
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:15,610
Please. I'm not worth it.

1188
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:24,210
Would you hold these, please? Thank you.

1189
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:32,130
Go ahead, Finley, you'd better start it,
because I'm gonna finish it.

1190
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:33,450
Very well.

1191
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:37,050
I don't know.

1192
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:43,650
Chester, you hit Bill?

1193
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:47,970
Well, I hope it was him.
I didn't have my glasses on.

1194
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:51,010
Bill, are you hurt?

1195
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:54,690
Really, Bill, aren't you being childish
about Chester?

1196
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:57,850
Well, you know very well
I've always considered him a bore.

1197
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:01,690
He must have been very boring that night
you responded to his admiration.

1198
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,770
What are you saying?

1199
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:07,890
The reason you didn't want to get married.

1200
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:14,370
"The thought of one of us being married
to another is most agonizing."

1201
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:16,010
Where did you get this?

1202
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:19,130
You ought to know.
You gave it to Wesley to burn.

1203
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:22,130
Bill. Bill.

1204
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:25,210
- Chester didn't write that note.
- What?

1205
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:28,290
I was hoping
I'd never have to tell you this, but...

1206
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,290
Well, it was written by somebody else.

1207
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:34,050
- Somebody else? Who?
- My father.

1208
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:35,410
Your father?

1209
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:38,090
Yes. My father sent that note
to that French actress, Miss La Rue.

1210
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:40,730
Marjorie Winfield,
you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1211
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:44,450
What a fantastic story,
besmirching the good name of your father.

1212
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,490
Of all the cheap contemptible tricks!

1213
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:48,930
Well, if that's all the trust you have in me,
William Sherman,

1214
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:50,690
I'm glad I found you out!

1215
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:53,610
You old fuddy-duddy!

1216
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:13,890
For heaven's sake, Miss Marjorie,
where have you been all morning?

1217
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:17,010
I've been down at Ike Hickey's
cleaning up the sleigh for tonight.

1218
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:20,730
It's better than sitting around,
moping about Bill.

1219
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:24,290
The idea of Wesley
letting Bill get ahold of that note.

1220
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:26,570
I gave him the piano for this morning.

1221
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:28,570
It wasn't Wesley's fault.

1222
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:33,250
And as for William Sherman,
I wouldn't marry him if he were the last...

1223
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,650
If he were the only boy in the world,
I wouldn't.

1224
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:39,130
Hello, George.

1225
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:43,370
Hello, Alice.

1226
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:45,690
What's the matter? Is anything wrong?

1227
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:49,130
No. Everything’s wonderful,
just wonderful.

1228
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:52,970
This morning, our daughter’s fiancé
canceled his loan at the bank,

1229
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:54,970
quit his job,
and announced he was leaving town.

1230
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:57,850
- Leaving town?
- What did you say? Bill's gone?

1231
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,330
Taking the 11:30.

1232
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:01,330
- 11:30?
- That's what I said.

1233
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:03,570
Well, then he's already gone.

1234
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,690
Oh, Marjorie, you poor dear child.

1235
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:09,290
Poor dear child? Look at her.
No wonder men leave town.

1236
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:11,090
A fine picture of Grace,
beauty and femininity.

1237
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,090
George.

1238
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,450
Well, I may be getting on in years,

1239
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,450
but I still know
what a man looks for in a woman.

1240
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:17,330
I imagine you do!

1241
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:21,050
And as for William Sherman leaving,
all I can say is, "Good riddance!"

1242
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:22,850
It seems to me, a young lady of your age,

1243
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:25,450
from a good home,
blessed with such fine parents...

1244
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:28,730
Marjorie, I've been passive about a lot
of queer things going on around here,

1245
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:32,610
but now I would like to know
what happened between you and Bill.

1246
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:34,970
Bill's jealous of Chester.

1247
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:38,650
He made a big scene and then
he accused me of being untrue to him.

1248
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,290
Well, you've been very open
and above-board

1249
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:41,730
about your relationships with...

1250
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:45,570
How dare he accuse my daughter,
a Winfield, of being untrue.

1251
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:50,330
Why, the impulsive fool,
suspecting Chester. He must be an idiot.

1252
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:51,650
Pardon me, Chester.

1253
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,010
If I ever see that William Sherman again...

1254
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:56,450
Please, Father, I'm trying to forget him.

1255
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:58,530
I'd like to help, Marjorie.

1256
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:00,810
Would you care
to go to the nickelodeon tonight?

1257
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:03,450
I can't tonight, Chester.
I'm taking the family out.

1258
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:06,370
You can come along if you want to.

1259
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:09,370
My mother and father
are celebrating their anniversary.

1260
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:14,810
- Alice, we nearly forgot.
- So we did.

1261
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,530
Let's see, he left at 11:30.

1262
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:26,650
The telegram would be delivered to him
when the train reach Muncie at 3:00.

1263
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:29,610
Now, if he gets the westbound train,

1264
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:32,410
it'll get him back here in Milburn at 7:15.

1265
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:34,570
- That's fine.
- Good.

1266
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,090
- Here is your lunch, Homer.
- Thanks, Toby.

1267
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:40,290
You better keep your message
down to 10 words, son.

1268
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,690
Ten words?

1269
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:44,250
Maybe I can help you.
You just tell me what you wanna say.

1270
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,890
Well, it's kind of a secret.

1271
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:48,330
Oh, all telegrams are confidential.

1272
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:50,770
Well...

1273
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:53,970
Bill left town because he thought
a love letter

1274
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:56,570
that Marjorie gave me to burn
was from Chester Finley.

1275
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:57,970
But it wasn't.

1276
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:02,850
It was a letter that Father was sending
to that actress lady, Miss La Rue.

1277
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:06,610
I never would have believed it
of George Winfield.

1278
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:10,450
I'd believe it about any man.
Your poor mother.

1279
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:12,530
Oh, she doesn't know.

1280
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:15,610
But Marjorie and Bill
were supposed to get married.

1281
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,170
I'll write the telegram for you, son.

1282
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:21,450
And remember, Toby,
company business is confidential.

1283
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,090
Strictly confidential!

1284
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:26,090
And if this gets out,
I'll know where it came from.

1285
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:31,050
Did you hear the news?

1286
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:34,530
That George Winfield is running around
with that actress.

1287
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:57,730
- Hello.
<i>- Did you hear the news?</i>

1288
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,210
<i>That George Winfield is running around</i>
<i>with that actress</i>.

1289
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:02,050
You don't say.

1290
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:05,250
My word, who'd have ever thought it?

1291
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:07,770
Homer, you'll never believe.

1292
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:11,930
Did you know that that George Winfield
has been carrying on with that actress?

1293
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:18,690
Remember this?

1294
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:21,770
Mother,

1295
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:24,170
am I a little eccentric in thinking

1296
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:28,090
ice skating is a peculiar way
to celebrate one's 20th anniversary?

1297
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:31,650
Well, I told Marjorie
about a certain evening at Miller's Pond,

1298
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:34,610
and I guess she is like her mother,
sentimental.

1299
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:51,090
<i>I'll forget you</i>

1300
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:58,330
<i>When I can live without the sunshine</i>

1301
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:03,530
<i>I'll forget you</i>

1302
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:10,090
<i>When I can live without the rain</i>

1303
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:14,210
<i>When summer roses</i>

1304
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:19,290
<i>Forget their fragrance</i>

1305
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:23,290
<i>And the songbird</i>

1306
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:29,570
<i>His sweet refrain</i>

1307
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:35,050
<i>I'll forget you</i>

1308
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:41,530
<i>When I can live without the moonlight</i>

1309
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:46,890
<i>I'll forget you</i>

1310
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:52,610
<i>When I can live without the sun</i>

1311
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:56,650
<i>Though Heaven's gladness</i>

1312
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:02,970
<i>May turn to sadness</i>

1313
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:11,610
<i>I'll never forget you</i>

1314
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:20,250
<i>Sweetheart</i>

1315
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:37,530
Gee, Sis, I'm sorry about letting
Bill get ahold of that note.

1316
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:40,570
It's all right, Wesley. You couldn't help it.

1317
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:43,530
It's all my fault. I ought to kill myself.

1318
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:45,970
- Wesley.
- It's only rubber.

1319
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:49,450
See you, Sis. I'm working on a case.

1320
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:52,290
- I hope you get your man.
- So do I.

1321
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:58,850
Honestly, Marjorie, I feel ridiculous.

1322
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:01,730
I just hope this whole idea of yours works.

1323
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:04,890
Stella, we know
that Father's still in love with Mother.

1324
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:07,810
This is just the thing to rekindle the flame.

1325
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:26,090
- Hello, Chester.
- Hello, Marjorie.

1326
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:29,890
- You see, I've accepted your invitation.
- I'm awfully glad.

1327
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:31,610
Marjorie!

1328
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,890
Excuse me, Stella.

1329
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:39,210
- What are you waiting for?
- We'll be out in just a minute.

1330
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:41,730
- Stella, Wesley and Mr. Hickey are here.
- Oh.

1331
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:44,170
Come on, Mother, let's go.

1332
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:46,010
George, the skates.

1333
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:47,250
- We forgot Chester.
- Oh.

1334
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,450
- Chester!
- Oh, here I am.

1335
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:49,490
Come on.

1336
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,170
Come on. Hurry up.

1337
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:53,850
Hey, your mustache is off.

1338
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:58,650
- How do I look?
- They'll never know you, Bill.

1339
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:00,970
My pipe.

1340
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,010
Quiet.

1341
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:08,130
Be careful.

1342
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:09,850
Marjorie, a horse and sleigh.

1343
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:11,770
And Ike Hickey driving.
Alice, do you remember?

1344
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:12,770
Oh, yes.

1345
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:14,010
Hello, Ike.

1346
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:15,010
Mr. Hickey!

1347
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:17,210
Marjorie, this is wonderful!

1348
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,610
Hello, Marjorie, the back seat, just for us.

1349
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:24,650
Thank you, Chester.

1350
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:26,410
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Finley.

1351
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,450
Stella...

1352
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:31,530
Mercy, I haven't been skating
since I was knee-high to a duck.

1353
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:39,130
Isn't it beautiful?

1354
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:43,490
It was very nice of you
to ask me along tonight, Marjorie.

1355
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:45,890
I realize this is sort of a family occasion,

1356
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:50,090
but, who knows,
pretty soon I may be one of the family.

1357
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:51,850
Giddyap, there.

1358
01:28:52,730 --> 01:28:54,170
Giddyap, there.

1359
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:55,770
Giddyap, there.

1360
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:59,450
Mr. Hickey, be careful.
You nearly broke Chester's glasses.

1361
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,370
- Isn't it pretty?
- It's just beautiful.

1362
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:19,850
My goodness, Alice,
it's almost just like we left it.

1363
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:22,730
Yeah. The pavilion's new,
but they cut down the old sycamore.

1364
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:24,290
Oh, yeah, the one we used to race to.

1365
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:26,530
Well, anyway,
the most important thing hasn't changed.

1366
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:27,610
What's that?

1367
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:30,690
Twenty years ago, you were
the prettiest girl here and you still are.

1368
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,690
- George.
- I'll help you, Marjorie.

1369
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:34,170
Everybody out.

1370
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,170
Come on, Stella, old girl.

1371
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:40,570
Out with his wife tonight,
just to throw us off the track.

1372
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:42,850
- He doesn't fool me.
- Me, neither.

1373
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:50,610
Keep still.

1374
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:54,010
Now, that's not too tight, is it, Marjorie?

1375
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:57,050
Oh, no, that's fine, Chester. Thanks.

1376
01:29:59,690 --> 01:30:00,930
Thanks, honey.

1377
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,930
You know, it's kind of tough bending over,
all bundled up like this.

1378
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:05,650
I understand, dear.

1379
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,970
- Good evening, Mrs. Winfield.
- Good evening.

1380
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:12,810
Hello, Alice.

1381
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:14,330
Hello, George.

1382
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:19,810
My goodness, Alice, the way
I'm being treated you'd think I was poison.

1383
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,330
They do act a little queer.

1384
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:23,810
Wonder who Harris foreclosed on today.

1385
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:44,770
Careful, Mr. Winfield.

1386
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:46,890
Mercy.

1387
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:55,170
Very good.

1388
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:57,970
Come on, honey.

1389
01:30:58,450 --> 01:30:59,810
Be careful.

1390
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,330
Isn't it exhilarating?

1391
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:18,570
Yeah, let's not wait 20 years
to try this again.

1392
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:20,730
Let's not overdo it.
You know, we're 20 years older.

1393
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:23,010
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.

1394
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:31,290
Alice.

1395
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,450
Look at your father.

1396
01:31:57,170 --> 01:32:00,490
- I'm all right, Alice.
- George, come off the ice!

1397
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:12,130
The second time.

1398
01:32:12,210 --> 01:32:14,770
Mercy, Mr. Winfield, you all right?

1399
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:16,530
Stella!

1400
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:19,130
Attention, everyone.

1401
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:21,410
Hey, attention, everyone, please.

1402
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:23,130
All right, all you figure skaters,

1403
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:26,530
Grab your favorite girl and let's everybody
skate to our favorite song.

1404
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:27,850
Here we go.

1405
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:29,530
Come on, Alice, this is my speed.

1406
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,050
Oh, I think you need a rest.

1407
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:33,690
Well, our favorite resting place
is behind Spooners' Rock.

1408
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:35,490
Or had you forgotten?

1409
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:36,530
It's working.

1410
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:38,370
The man said, "your favorite girl."

1411
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:41,370
Hey, Marjorie, Mr. Hickey's all alone,
and he said he'd like to skate with you.

1412
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:43,250
- Come on.
- Mr. Hickey?

1413
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,890
Here she is.

1414
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,890
- Mr. Hickey, you want to skate with me?
- That's right.

1415
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:51,930
Now, that's very sweet.

1416
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:55,530
- But, Marjorie, I'm your escort.
- Now, Chester, be a good sport.

1417
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:57,090
Come on, Mr. Hickey.

1418
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,730
Mr. Hickey. Really.

1419
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:14,890
Real...

1420
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:26,330
Bill!

1421
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:30,370
Bill...

1422
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:32,330
Marjorie...

1423
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:45,330
Oh, pardon me,
I am looking for Mr. George Winfield.

1424
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:49,090
- He's over on the other side of the pond.
- With his wife.

1425
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:50,530
Thank you.

1426
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:55,410
Mother and Father
are behind Spooners' Rock.

1427
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:56,410
Good.

Mr. Winfield! Oh, Mr. Winfield!

1444
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:05,370
Good evening, Miss La Rue.

1445
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:07,650
I have been searching for you frantically.

1446
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:09,010
My show opens tomorrow,

1447
01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:11,450
and we must reach
some kind of an understanding.

1448
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:13,850
Well, I thought that was all settled.

1449
01:35:13,890 --> 01:35:17,770
I still did not get an answer from you
on the divorce matter.

1450
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:21,330
Divorce? Oh, Mother! Oh, Mother.

1451
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:24,170
But, Miss La Rue, my note settled all that.

1452
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:25,330
Note?

1453
01:35:25,410 --> 01:35:28,610
Yes, the speech I copied from the play,
the one dealing with divorce.

1454
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:30,250
I sent it back to you with a notation

1455
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:32,610
requesting that it be deleted
from the show.

1456
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:36,090
Father, you mean that note
was just something out of the play?

1457
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:38,930
Yes. I gave it to Wesley to deliver.

1458
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:42,850
Here. This must be it.

1459
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:46,290
- What are you doing with that?
- Well, sir, I...

1460
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,610
He thought Chester sent the letter to me.

1461
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:51,930
You couldn't blame me. When Wesley said
Marjorie told him to burn it.

1462
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:54,090
- Burn it?
- It wasn't her fault.

1463
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:56,290
We thought it was a love letter
you were sending to Miss La Rue.

1464
01:35:56,610 --> 01:35:58,290
- Yes.
- A love letter?

1465
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:02,290
You thought that I...
That this woman and I...

1466
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:06,090
You all thought...

1467
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:09,370
- Alice, what did you think?
- I didn't know.

1468
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:10,970
They didn't let me in on the fun.

1469
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:13,810
Fun? Well, I don't think this is so funny.

1470
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:14,890
And I beg you to remember

1471
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:17,410
that Miss La Rue and I
weren't having any fun, either.

1472
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:19,330
And as for you, young man,
when we get home,

1473
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:21,090
you're gonna get a taste of my razor strap.

1474
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:22,130
Father.

1475
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:23,770
Don't worry, Sis, I threw it away.

1476
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:25,930
- You what?
- You won't need it anymore.

1477
01:36:26,010 --> 01:36:28,770
I got you one of these new safety razors
for your anniversary.

1478
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:29,890
Oh...

1479
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:33,570
Well, really, I don't think
this is a laughing matter.

1480
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:37,370
My own family, my friends and neighbors
distrusted me.

1481
01:36:37,810 --> 01:36:40,090
And what about this lady's feelings?

1482
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:43,570
- Miss La Rue, you must think that this is...
- Very funny.

1483
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:48,770
Oh, that's wonderful, Miss La Rue.
