1
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,243
<i>Well, thats exactly
what we were looking for...</i>

2
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,718
<i>the right atmosphere at the right price.</i>

3
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,879
<i>There we are now, the Sherwood sisters...</i>

4
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,688
<i>one would-be writer
and one would-be actress...</i>

5
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:09,159
<i>in search of fame, fortune,
and a for rent sign on Barrow Street.</i>

6
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,841
<i>The one in red, thats me.</i>

7
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,921
<i>And the beautiful blond,
thats my sister Eileen.</i>

8
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,282
Here we are.

9
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:36,722
Youre standing on the brink of disaster.

10
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,404
Take my advice. Forget about it.

11
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,127
- Forget what?
- The vacancy.

12
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,006
You wouldnt care for the apartment.

13
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:46,284
- Why not?
- Termites.

14
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:49,044
- Termites?
- This big.

15
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:50,887
- Believe me.
- Ruth.

16
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:55,360
An exterminator went in there last week
and he got the beating of his life.

17
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,047
However, if you young ladies are seeking
a sanctuary in this troubled world...

18
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:01,648
seek no more.

19
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,881
I will show you the best value
in Greenwich Village.

20
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,642
- Come along with me.
- Wait a minute. Who are you?

21
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,687
Allow me to introduce myself.
Im Appopolous.

22
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:13,966
Papa Appopolous
to my children on Barrow Street.

23
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:15,323
How do you do?

24
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,877
I am Eileen Sherwood
and this is my sister, Ruth.

25
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,403
- Of the Ohio Sherwoods.
- Of course.

26
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,639
Now, where is this sanctuary?

27
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,528
Due south.

28
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:32,480
Here we are, darlings.

29
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,357
The pride of Barrow Street,
the Appopolous Arms.

30
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,607
<i>You mean you...</i>

31
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:43,363
- Is the apartment very high up?
- Up?

32
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:45,157
Down.

33
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,360
Youll be crazy about it.

34
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,529
Here we are, darlings, all righty.

35
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:01,919
Your luggage, please. Your luggage. Please.

36
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,767
Isnt this exactly
what youve been dreaming about?

37
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,478
My dear young ladies, this is the best value
you can get for your money in New York.

38
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,639
Architecture, neighbourhood.

39
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,281
Thank you, llI have it fixed.

40
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,724
- It isnt too bad, Ruth.
- Too bad?

41
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,200
Let me point out
a few salient features of this studio.

42
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,325
A: It is summer.

43
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:30,000
B: It is exactly 30 degrees cooler down here.

44
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:32,887
Cooler? Lts musty enough to hang venison.

45
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,201
Note the exquisite imitation fireplace...

46
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,885
the magnificent day beds.

47
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:42,722
And look here, there is even a piano.

48
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,643
Id never have known without an autopsy.

49
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,084
And here is a model kitchenette...

50
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:52,725
complete in every detail.

51
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,882
And here is a luxurious bathroom.

52
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:01,000
What fiend designed this?

53
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:03,758
In those two rooms, you wont entertain.

54
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,079
- It does look clean, Ruth.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:07,958
Whats that?

56
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:11,883
One of your neighbours.
Perhaps a future Lily Pons or Helen Traubel.

57
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,439
Come, let me show you the garden.
Its beautiful in the summer.

58
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:18,089
- A garden.
- Real outdoor living.

59
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:36,365
- How are you, Papa?
- Very busy, Mr. OConnor.

60
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:40,284
You see, youre surrounded
by fellow artists like yourself.

61
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:43,839
- It is colourful, isnt it, Ruth?
- Lf you like loud colours.

62
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,921
- How much is this apartment?
- Only $65.

63
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,481
- $65? For this concrete catacomb?
- Ill even wallpaper the kitchen.

64
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,924
It is cheaper than anything else
weve looked at.

65
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,364
As an added inducement,
llI tell you what llI do.

66
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:59,407
Take the place for a month,
then, if youre still not satisfied...

67
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:01,366
Ill give you back your first months rent.

68
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,759
- I dont see what we can lose. Do you?
- Legally, youve got me where you want me.

69
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:06,999
I gave you my word
in front of two witnesses.

70
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,602
Three, including me.

71
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:11,328
Please, I just cant look at any more places.

72
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,922
- Well...
- Then its all settled.

73
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,125
- The rest of your luggage is at the station?
- Yes.

74
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,404
You girls make yourself at home.
Ill send for it.

75
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:20,287
Thank you.
You have the luggage checks, dont you?

76
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:22,360
<i>- Yeah.
- And the...</i>

77
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,562
Just a minute.

78
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,563
$20, 40, 50, 60.

79
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,686
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

80
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,762
Thank you.

81
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:39,007
Thank you, my children.
Thank you very much.

82
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:43,769
From now on, you can call me Papa.

83
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:47,323
Ill have it fixed in the morning. Good luck.

84
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,042
Be it ever so humble,
theres no place like home.

85
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,207
Mr. Appopolous!

86
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,768
- Wheres that doorknob?
- Here it is.

87
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,689
Mr. Appopolous, wait just a minute.

88
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:05,997
- It was terrible.
- Yes?

89
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,966
- What was that?
- What was what?

90
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:10,438
- That noise.
- The whole room shook.

91
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,645
It goes to show you how you get used to it.

92
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,959
- I didnt even notice it.
- Get used to it?

93
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:17,802
- It happens all the time?
- You wont even be conscious of it.

94
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:19,607
A little blasting. The new subway.

95
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,601
- Theyre blasting right under our feet?
- What are you so worried about?

96
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,645
Those engineers know
how much dynamite to use.

97
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:26,208
Does it happen all the time?

98
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,998
No. They stop at midnight,
and they dont start again until...

99
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,522
6:00 in the morning.

100
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:34,169
- 6:00.
- How would you like to step outside?

101
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:37,207
- What are you getting so hysterical about?
- Im not getting hysterical yet.

102
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,644
- All we want is our money back.
- Yes.

103
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,323
I told you Id give back your money
and I will...

104
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:45,003
if, at the end of the month,
youre still dissatisfied.

105
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,807
Goodnight, darlings.

106
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,485
What are we going to do?

107
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:56,520
Were gonna do 30 days.

108
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,118
You know, we ought to have
that phone connected in the morning...

109
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,677
so we can start calling up for jobs.

110
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:08,725
You dont call up for jobs,
you go out and look for them.

111
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,569
I hope we dont have to look too long.

112
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:15,085
Incidentally, that money from Dad
is the last were gonna take from him.

113
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,082
- After that, its beg, borrow, steal, or starve.
- Of course.

114
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:24,207
Maybe we shouldnt have come
to New York just yet, huh, Ruth?

115
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,008
Dont tell me
youre getting homesick already?

116
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,568
Maybe a little.

117
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:32,044
I wonder what Billy Hunniger
is doing tonight.

118
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:35,041
Hes probably at the country club dance
with Annie Wilkerson.

119
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:38,280
- He can have her.
- Dont you think he knows that?

120
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,763
Of course, those things never bothered you.
Men never meant very much in your life.

121
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,079
Not after they got a load of you, they didnt.

122
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:48,366
Thats the trouble with you.
Youve got a complex or something.

123
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:51,202
Youre a lot more attractive
than you think you are.

124
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:54,884
Youre close.
Im a lot more attractive than men think I am.

125
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,488
Remember what Dad said.

126
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:00,686
There are eight million people in New York,
and half of them are men.

127
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:03,078
One of them is bound to be
the right boy for you.

128
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:06,320
Yeah, and I wonder
where the poor devil is tonight.

129
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:07,762
<i>One, two...</i>

130
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:09,805
- Im gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

131
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:12,039
Five, six, seven.

132
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:16,921
<i>One, two...</i>

133
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,564
The heck with it. Let it spread.

134
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,117
<i>When I started shedding my avoirdupois</i>

135
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,643
<i>I thought
it would get me somewhere with the boys</i>

136
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:30,118
<i>I went to a gym and got myself slim</i>

137
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:32,962
<i>I went on long hikes, I wore out three bikes</i>

138
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,847
<i>And from those masseurs
What beatings I took</i>

139
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:39,399
<i>Yet nobody said</i>

140
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,844
<i>How lovely you look</i>

141
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,800
- Whatd you say, Ruth?
- I said, Let it spread.

142
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,361
<i>What good</i>

143
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:00,122
<i>does it do me to slenderise?</i>

144
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,884
<i>Who needs this reducing routine?</i>

145
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,766
<i>Slender or stout</i>

146
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:09,158
<i>I am a washout</i>

147
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,079
<i>As soon as they see Eileen</i>

148
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:18,800
<i>I long for a young man with tender eyes</i>

149
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,438
<i>But my competitions too keen</i>

150
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:25,520
<i>My name is mud</i>

151
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:28,043
<i>Im a real dud</i>

152
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:32,163
<i>As soon as they see Eileen</i>

153
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:34,281
<i>But shes an angel</i>

154
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,519
<i>As well as a cutie</i>

155
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,444
<i>Her kind of beauty is rare</i>

156
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:44,284
<i>Still I always have found</i>

157
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,758
<i>That when she is around</i>

158
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:49,921
<i>Nobody knows that Im there</i>

159
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,601
<i>I wish I could dream</i>

160
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:56,281
<i>And philosophise</i>

161
00:10:56,369 --> 00:11:00,157
<i>With someone who knows what I mean</i>

162
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,719
<i>But what is the use?</i>

163
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,118
<i>Im a gone goose</i>

164
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:09,568
<i>As soon as they see Eileen</i>

165
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:13,599
<i>Im over 20 with plenty of knowledge</i>

166
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:17,879
<i>I earned my college degree</i>

167
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:20,923
<i>But Im frankly annoyed</i>

168
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:23,279
<i>Tell me, Doctor Freud</i>

169
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:26,361
<i>What is the matter with me?</i>

170
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,358
Hi.

171
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,041
Mommy!

172
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:39,959
<i>Some night</i>

173
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:42,722
<i>Maybe Ill see the starry skies</i>

174
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:46,404
<i>With someone who isnt too green</i>

175
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,119
<i>But with all my desire, Im a flat tyre</i>

176
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,200
<i>I have the appeal</i>

177
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:55,166
<i>Of a fifth wheel</i>

178
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,565
<i>Im just out of luck</i>

179
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:00,038
<i>Im a dead duck</i>

180
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:04,566
<i>As soon as they see</i>

181
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:09,244
<i>Eileen</i>

182
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:12,481
- Ruth?
- Yeah?

183
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,367
Ruth, where are you?

184
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,961
What are you doing out there?

185
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:21,883
Just getting a breath of fresh air,
frightening little children.

186
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:23,960
- What?
- Nothing.

187
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,649
I was hoping wed get
whats-his-name to fix that shower.

188
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,640
- It just dribbles.
- Yeah, I noticed.

189
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:33,563
- Its as hot outside as it is in here.
- Yeah. Dont forget to lock the door.

190
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:34,877
Yeah.

191
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,242
Im sorry.

192
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:42,328
I didnt think
you girls would go to bed this early.

193
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:46,163
- Thats beside the point. Who are you?
- I live upstairs. My names Ted Loomis.

194
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:49,082
- You can just call me Wreck.
- Wreck?

195
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,478
Thats what they used to call me
at Georgia Tech.

196
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:53,685
Id have made all-American,
only I was expelled.

197
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:55,122
Thats very interesting.

198
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,246
But dont you think
its about time you were rambling along?

199
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:01,844
Yeah. If theres anything I can do
for you girls, you just whistle.

200
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,044
Well do that.

201
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:07,407
By the way, I was just wondering,
are you girls going to be home tomorrow?

202
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:11,164
- No. Well be out looking for work.
- Thats great.

203
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,717
I always do the laundry down here
on Thursday.

204
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,037
Laundry?

205
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,438
Helens a switchboard operator.
She works nights.

206
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,884
I dont like to disturb her during the day.

207
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,687
- Helen?
- Yeah.

208
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,761
Were engaged.

209
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:30,527
I dont want you to get the wrong idea.
Its just that we cant afford to get married...

210
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,681
and we cant afford two apartments.
Im out of work right now.

211
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,600
So when Helens at work, I sleep...

212
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,283
and then when she sleeps,
I do the housework.

213
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,998
We dont see much of each other,
so we get along just great.

214
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:45,042
I can see you girls still think
thats a little strange?

215
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:49,520
- Only because were from Ohio.
- Yeah. I guess that would make a difference.

216
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,761
- Violet was from Brooklyn.
- Whos Violet?

217
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:56,080
She had this studio
before they started blasting for the subway.

218
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,637
- It was bad for business.
- Business?

219
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,166
Yeah. She read palms or something.

220
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:09,163
Thanks a million about the laundry.
Ill see you tomorrow. Goodnight.

221
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,040
What was that all about?

222
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:14,962
I dont know.

223
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,046
- But he seemed very nice.
- He would. Hes a man.

224
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:30,487
Everythings so convenient in this dungeon.

225
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:38,489
- Oh, boy.
- I know what you mean.

226
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,928
I could swear I just put out the lights.

227
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,364
Theres a street lamp
shining right in the window.

228
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:49,804
Well have to pull the curtains.

229
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,358
Were practically sleeping in the street.

230
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:58,725
Yeah, we sure cant close the windows.
Wed suffocate.

231
00:14:58,809 --> 00:14:59,958
Yeah.

232
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,004
- Whats the matter?
- This bed.

233
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:05,364
They are kind of hard, arent they?

234
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:08,441
Hard? We could do better at the morgue.

235
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,840
Lets go to sleep.

236
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:13,762
Maybe we can have
a nice, pleasant nightmare.

237
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:17,285
- We got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
- Thats right.

238
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:20,039
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

239
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,608
What was that?

240
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:31,768
Now what?

241
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:47,682
- Thats one way to keep cool.
- Ruth, youre drenched.

242
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,885
Here, let me get you a towel.

243
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,443
Get away from there.

244
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:06,244
- Pete, look. Girls.
- Go away! You heard me.

245
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:10,365
- Beat it, you drunken goons!
- Now, please, madam.

246
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:13,885
All we were doing was singing.
Since when is it a crime to sing?

247
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:16,881
Youre certainly not
getting into the spirit of things, madam.

248
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:19,278
Im not in the mood
and stop calling me madam!

249
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:22,042
- Isnt she lovely, Pete?
- She certainly is.

250
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:24,689
You get away from there.
Now, go on, go away.

251
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:28,487
Break it up!

252
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,881
- I was saying good night...
- Good night, ladies.

253
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:36,641
You heard them. Out.

254
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:39,884
Good night, ladies.

255
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:43,760
- Thank you very much, Officer.
- Yes. Were so glad you came by.

256
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:47,444
<i>- Ill bet you are.
- There arent any shades on the window...</i>

257
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:49,679
And theres a light
shining through the window.

258
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,603
- Could you do something about that?
- Sure, llI put a shade on it.

259
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:57,045
- You kids new in the neighbourhood?
- We just moved in this afternoon.

260
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:59,563
If youre smart, youll move out tomorrow.

261
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:02,561
I dont go for this kind of stuff on my beat.

262
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:10,327
- What did he mean by that?
- Evidently, this studio has a bad reputation.

263
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,965
Violet must have been reading palms
without a licence.

264
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,240
- I dont think I can take 30 days of this.
- Everythings gonna be all right.

265
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,526
- Its all my fault. If I hadnt of insisted on...
- It isnt your fault.

266
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,248
...staying here, we couldve gone to a hotel...

267
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,239
- Good morning, Wreck. Im home.
- Hi, baby. You have a hard night?

268
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:48,638
Yeah, it was pretty busy.
Think llI go to bed now.

269
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:51,038
I made you something to eat.
Its in the kitchen.

270
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:53,962
- Thanks, honey.
- You have a good days sleep.

271
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:56,847
- All righty. See you later.
- Okay.

272
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,399
Here, let me give you a hand.

273
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:10,199
Thanks, Wreck.
By the way, heres the grocery list.

274
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:12,243
Are you sure you dont mind?

275
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,445
No, of course not.
I got to go to the store anyway.

276
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,759
Heres the money.
I think that ought to be enough.

277
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:19,283
In case it isnt, take off the cookies
and the soft drinks.

278
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,927
Were on an awfully tight budget.

279
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:22,761
I know what you mean.
Since Im out of work...

280
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,601
Helen makes me
watch the pennies pretty close.

281
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:28,079
- What kind of work you out of?
- I play pro football during the season.

282
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:31,366
- What do you do the rest of the year?
- I usually wrestle, but I got suspended.

283
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:33,246
- Why?
- Overacting.

284
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:35,923
Really.

285
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,279
How about you girls?
You got any connections here in town?

286
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:42,681
<i>Yeah. I have a letter of introduction
to the editor of Manhatter magazine.</i>

287
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:46,444
- Thats good. How about Eileen?
- Eileen doesnt need a letter.

288
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:49,557
Im all ready. Do I look all right?

289
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:53,359
- I cant remember when you didnt.
- You look beautiful.

290
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:55,679
Any producer
that wouldnt hire you is a girl.

291
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:59,478
Thanks, Wreck. I dont know
where to go or how to get started.

292
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:02,766
<i>Most of the actors around here
read Variety to see whats going on.</i>

293
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,646
If were gonna do it, lets do it.

294
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,287
- Yeah.
- Which way to the subway?

295
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:09,327
<i>Lts right up the... Come on, llI show you.</i>

296
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:21,480
Its right up at this corner.
Remember, you take the uptown train.

297
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,287
- This corner?
- Thats right.

298
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,007
- Good luck, you guys.
- Bye.

299
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:27,808
Good morning, darlings.
Did you have a good nights sleep?

300
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:31,199
Sure. For a place with a bad location
and no neon sign...

301
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,440
- we did a whale of a business.
- Theres no hot water in the shower.

302
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:37,487
Thats why you look so cool and refreshed.

303
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:42,006
- I assume youre off to seek employment?
- Yes. I guess we better get started.

304
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:44,808
Youth. You have this great metropolis...

305
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:47,801
grovelling at your feet
like a passionate lover.

306
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:51,724
Thats what I thought when I left Ohio,
but now Im scared.

307
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,609
- Youre not alone, honey.
- Pish-tosh!

308
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:58,159
There are only two things you need
in this troubled world to succeed.

309
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:01,321
A: Confidence. B: Patience.

310
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:05,441
Take me, for example.

311
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,879
<i>Im sure that Im a genius</i>

312
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,766
<i>So I havent any fears</i>

313
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,921
<i>I never get discouraged and downhearted</i>

314
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:17,604
<i>I havent sold a painting
And Ive tried for 20 years</i>

315
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:20,886
<i>Hes just a little slow getting started</i>

316
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:24,843
<i>Im great, but no one knows it</i>

317
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:26,760
<i>No one knows it but me</i>

318
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:30,285
<i>Im great
And yet I just cant get the critics to agree</i>

319
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,958
<i>My works are masterpieces
Like Picassos and Matisses</i>

320
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:35,767
<i>Youre certainly an artist</i>

321
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,840
<i>When it comes to drawing leases</i>

322
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:39,567
<i>Im just as great as he is</i>

323
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:41,560
<i>But they call me the worst</i>

324
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:45,119
<i>But when I lose a match
Its cause I havent been rehearsed</i>

325
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:48,565
<i>You mean that youre a genius
In your own peculiar way</i>

326
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,480
<i>Youre great, but no one knows it</i>

327
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:52,605
<i>But they will someday</i>

328
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:56,045
You see, thats our secret.
Youve got to have confidence in yourself.

329
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,247
Miss Sherwood, you could be
a female Shakespeare.

330
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,003
- Me?
- Sure you could.

331
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:04,205
Eileen, you could show
these other actresses...

332
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:05,768
theyre not even on the second team.

333
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,204
You can throw a hammerlock
around this whole doggone town.

334
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:10,757
- I could?
- You could. If you only believe in yourself.

335
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:13,727
Miss Sherwood,
what do you think of yourself?

336
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:17,006
- I guess Im all right.
- No, Eileen. Ruth.

337
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,400
What do you think of yourself?

338
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:26,127
No. No matter what anybody says,
youve got to keep your head up high...

339
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:28,643
and say, Im great. Say it!

340
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:30,118
<i>Im great</i>

341
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:31,244
No.

342
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:34,321
Youve got to shout it out!
So the whole city can hear you.

343
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,240
From the Bronx to the Battery.

344
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,682
Shout!

345
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:40,923
<i>Im great, but no one knows it
No one knows it</i>

346
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:41,998
Thats much better.

347
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:43,078
<i>So far</i>

348
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,158
Thats fine.

349
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:45,762
<i>But theyll get wise</i>

350
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:48,522
<i>And realise how wonderful you are</i>

351
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:51,045
<i>The public may acclaim us</i>

352
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:53,040
<i>Well be popular and famous</i>

353
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:56,917
<i>And anyone that pans us
Will be called an ignoramus</i>

354
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:58,681
<i>Were great, but no one knows it</i>

355
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,441
<i>But who cares about them</i>

356
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:01,723
<i>Can we be sure?</i>

357
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:04,084
<i>Theyll say that youre the crème de la crème</i>

358
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:05,966
<i>Well, I dont know what that means</i>

359
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:08,005
<i>But I agree with what you say</i>

360
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:09,761
<i>Were great, but no one knows it</i>

361
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:11,521
<i>But they will someday</i>

362
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:13,281
<i>Were great, but no one knows it</i>

363
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,041
<i>No one knows it so far</i>

364
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:16,323
<i>But theyll get wise</i>

365
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,684
<i>And realise how talented we are</i>

366
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,282
<i>The public will acclaim us</i>

367
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,280
<i>Well be popular and famous</i>

368
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:25,600
<i>And anyone who pans us
Will be called an ignoramus</i>

369
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:27,361
<i>Were great, but no one knows it</i>

370
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,485
<i>No one knows it, not yet</i>

371
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:32,606
<i>But they will even pay us
To endorse a cigarette</i>

372
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:34,566
<i>As we go by, theyll point us out</i>

373
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:35,968
<i>And even shout hurray!</i>

374
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:38,005
<i>Hurray! Were great, but no one knows it</i>

375
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:41,923
<i>But they will someday</i>

376
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,320
- Wont you sit down?
- Thank you.

377
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,683
<i>Thank...</i>

378
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:49,209
Thank you. Thank you very much.

379
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:05,602
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

380
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:07,202
My name is Eileen Sherwood.

381
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,678
<i>I read in Variety
that Mr. Wallace is casting a new show.</i>

382
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:11,646
- Would it be possible for me to see...
- Im sorry...

383
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:14,004
but Mr. Wallace is only seeing people
by appointment.

384
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:18,082
- Do you think I could make an appointment?
- Im sorry. Thats impossible.

385
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:20,080
- You can send in the next.
- Thank you anyway.

386
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,285
- Carolyn Christy.
- Im sorry.

387
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:27,319
- Wont you step in now, please?
- Mr. Wallace, she isnt on the list.

388
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:31,527
Dont be so technical, Miss Stevenson.
Was America on Columbus map?

389
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:43,685
I would like to see Mr. Robert Baker, please.

390
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:45,282
Mr. Baker cant see anyone.

391
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:47,803
Hes just getting ready
to leave on his vacation.

392
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:51,199
On his vacation?
Cant I see him for just a minute?

393
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,519
Some of my stories were submitted to him...

394
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:56,169
<i>by Mr. Stover of the Columbus Courier.</i>

395
00:24:56,249 --> 00:24:58,604
- I have a letter of introduction.
- Im sorry.

396
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:00,919
If you leave the letter
and your telephone number...

397
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:03,079
hell get in touch with you when he returns.

398
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,684
The phones not connected yet,
but llI leave the address.

399
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:09,923
There.

400
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,927
Thank you very much.

401
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:16,002
Keep smiling.

402
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:18,245
Now here are your tickets, Mr. Baker.

403
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:21,401
Your bags are in the taxi,
and your train leaves in 20 minutes.

404
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:22,842
- Good.
- Bye, Mr. Baker.

405
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:26,080
No tears, Judy.
George, I left the bar open. Be my guest.

406
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:28,046
- Thank you.
- Youre getting taller.

407
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:30,597
Dont you worry about a thing.
Have a wonderful time.

408
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:31,917
- Catch a lot of fish.
- I will.

409
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:34,239
- Have fun, Mr. Baker.
- I was hoping youd say that.

410
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:35,887
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

411
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,005
- Mr. Baker...
- Goodbye, dear.

412
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:41,559
- Im terribly sorry. I dont know you, do I?
- Dont mention it, Mr. Baker.

413
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:45,278
- Im Ruth Sherwood.
- It was nice kissing you.

414
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,760
- Mr. Baker, I know youre in a hurry.
- Yes, Im afraid I have to catch a train.

415
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,805
Excuse me, Jerry,
would you make it non-stop for me?

416
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:52,925
I guess you dont remember.
Im Ruth Sherwood.

417
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,126
<i>- Yes.
- Bill Stover, of the Columbus Courier...</i>

418
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:59,440
- he sent you some of my stories.
- Good. Yeah, Bill. How is old Bill?

419
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,406
- We were roommates in college.
- He told me.

420
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:02,888
- Hes fine.
- Good.

421
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:06,723
- Did you have a chance to read my stories?
- Your stories. Yes. Oh, yeah.

422
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:10,286
Yes, I thought youd be more of...

423
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,846
- the spinster type, sort of.
- Spinster?

424
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:16,727
Those love stories of yours
are pretty depressing.

425
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:21,241
What I mean is, all romance doesnt end
in epic tragedy necessarily.

426
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,797
The boy running off
and joining the Foreign Legion...

427
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:26,528
the girl setting fire to her hope chest.

428
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:27,998
Its the funniest thing...

429
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:30,808
I usually can figure out what a person is like
from the way they write.

430
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,926
But like you, you just dont seem to me
like a confirmed cynic.

431
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:37,725
We cynical spinsters
can be pretty deceptive sometimes.

432
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:40,685
Thank you, Jerry.
I didnt mean to offend you.

433
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:43,442
Offend me? Just because you say
I write like a frustrated old maid?

434
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:48,240
<i>Id love to... Excuse me, go ahead.</i>

435
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:51,048
Id love to discuss this thing
further with you, but I cant, you see.

436
00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:54,280
And just to keep the record straight,
I didnt call you frustrated.

437
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:55,688
Thank you.

438
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:58,727
Look, dont get discouraged.
I think you write very well.

439
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:02,927
- Try writing something youre familiar with.
- With which Im familiar.

440
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,557
<i>It was nice meeting you, Miss...</i>

441
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:08,083
- Sherwood.
- Sherwood. Yes, of course.

442
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,284
Of course.

443
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:11,842
Grand Central.

444
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:30,887
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

445
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:34,279
- Can I take your order?
- Yes. Id like a Coke, please.

446
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:39,523
- Its warm, isnt it?
- Awful.

447
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:44,440
Want some lime in this?
Lts good in the hot weather.

448
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:45,848
All right.

449
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:49,408
- Saw you in here this morning.
- You did?

450
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,163
- You havent been in before, have you?
- Thank you.

451
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:56,685
- No, I just got in town yesterday.
- You an actress?

452
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:01,719
No. Id like to be.
But I dont think its going to be very easy.

453
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:04,767
Ive already seen
three producers this morning.

454
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:07,639
Dont tell me they werent interested?

455
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:11,244
They were interested all right,
but not in my acting.

456
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,720
Yes, I see what you mean.

457
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:18,998
Maybe I could help you get started.
I dont know if you know it or not...

458
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:22,559
but this place is a real kind of hangout
for people in show business.

459
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:24,128
- Really?
- Sure.

460
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:27,326
If I keep my ears open,
I could pick up a lot of inside information...

461
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:30,003
about auditions and that kind of stuff.

462
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:32,967
- That would be just wonderful.
- I got it.

463
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:37,088
Why dont you come in here every day?
Say, for lunch. And llI keep you posted.

464
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,327
Foods excellent.
Every day we have a special.

465
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:45,045
<i>- Thats certainly very nice of you, Mr...
- Lippencott. Frank Lippencott.</i>

466
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:49,245
- Fountain manager.
- How do you do? Lm Eileen Sherwood.

467
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:53,119
I guess llI be seeing you
for lunch tomorrow, Mr. Lippencott.

468
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,962
- Do I pay here?
- Dont worry about it.

469
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:59,684
- Courtesy of the management.
- Thank you very much.

470
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,723
Remember now. Dont get discouraged.

471
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:05,805
Ill try not to. Thank you.

472
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:19,049
<i>Im great, but no one knows it</i>

473
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:21,723
<i>No one knows it so far</i>

474
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:26,568
<i>Theyll get wise
And realise how talented we are</i>

475
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:30,127
<i>As we go by, theyll point us out</i>

476
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:32,120
<i>And even shout hurray</i>

477
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,403
Well?

478
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:37,598
<i>Were great
And no one knows it, but they will</i>

479
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,408
<i>Someday</i>

480
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:56,485
- Good morning, Mr. Newbetter.
- Sorry.

481
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,805
The last few weeks,
I feel like Im living in my own little world.

482
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:04,928
Sending all these stories to myself.
I think llI call the next one Boomerang.

483
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:07,728
Cheer up, maybe the next one
wont come back.

484
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,482
Yeah, llI leave off the return address.

485
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:18,882
- Bad news?
- Not if you like to suffer.

486
00:30:19,969 --> 00:30:23,279
Dont you worry.
Ive got a feeling that this is my lucky day.

487
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:24,688
If I knock on enough doors...

488
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:27,124
some producer has to let me
show him what I can do.

489
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,882
- Anything you want while Im uptown?
- Yeah.

490
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:33,279
- You can cash the last of the Mohicans.
- The last?

491
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:35,963
When this is gone, weve had it, honey.

492
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:39,200
$20 and two return tickets
to Columbus, Ohio.

493
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,326
Were not gonna use those tickets.

494
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,481
You just wait. The first thing you know,
youll sell a story...

495
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:49,367
Ill get a job and we can move out
of this terrible place.

496
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:51,565
You know, its starting again.

497
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,605
- What?
- The kitchen wall.

498
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:57,648
It keeps perspiring or something.
It could break through and flood the place.

499
00:30:57,729 --> 00:30:59,765
I think we should talk to Mr. Appopolous.

500
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:02,807
Talk to him?
Lve been screaming at him for two weeks.

501
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:06,359
Could you write a letter of protest to the
Better Business Bureau, or something?

502
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:09,998
Sure I could, but anything Id write,
theyd just send back.

503
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:13,118
Goodbye. Keep your fingers crossed.

504
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:17,885
Maybe thats what is wrong with my stories.
Ive been typing with my fingers crossed.

505
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:21,879
- Whats for dinner?
- The usual, meatballs and spaghetti.

506
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:27,488
Do you think we could get something
kind of interesting for dessert?

507
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:30,125
I invited Frank Lippencott.

508
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,165
You know, its wonderful the way
you manage with only one maid.

509
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:36,041
Its the least we can do.

510
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:39,758
He hasnt let me pay for one single
lunch cheque since Ive been going in there.

511
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:41,362
I have a feeling that before long...

512
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:44,486
Walgreens fountain will be
under new management.

513
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:46,321
- Scat.
- Bye.

514
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:48,123
Good luck.

515
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,167
Where you been, Chick?
Havent seen you around in a while.

516
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:08,366
Ive been up to Atlantic City,
covering the Miss America contest.

517
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:11,566
Frank, old boy, our countrys never been
in such good shape.

518
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:14,440
- Whats new with you?
- Nothing.

519
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:16,759
Invented any new sundaes lately?

520
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,079
- Eileen. Hiya.
- Hi.

521
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:27,324
I tried to call you at the house,
but your sister said youd already left.

522
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:29,365
- I have good news for you.
- Really? What?

523
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,087
I heard about an audition.

524
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:33,922
A rehearsal pianist who comes in here,
he told me about it.

525
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:37,081
- When is it? Where do I have to go?
- Its in a theatre on 42nd Street.

526
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:39,239
The piano players name is Charlie
and he said...

527
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:41,365
that if you come over, hell fix it up.

528
00:32:41,449 --> 00:32:43,565
Thats wonderful.
I dont know how to thank...

529
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:46,607
<i>Pardon me,
I couldnt help but overhear, Miss...</i>

530
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:50,920
This is Eileen Sherwood. Eileen, Mr. Clark.

531
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:52,488
Thats right. Chick Clark.

532
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:55,242
<i>- Reporter at large, New York Daily News.
- How do you do?</i>

533
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:57,001
You see,
Im well-known around show business...

534
00:32:57,089 --> 00:32:59,557
and the producer
holding that audition is a buddy of mine.

535
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:03,437
- Thanks, Chick, but Ive already set it up.
- But with a rehearsal pianist.

536
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:07,238
Youre gonna let this lovely little girl walk in
with that kind of introduction, are you?

537
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:09,638
Thats certainly very considerate of you,
Mr. Clark.

538
00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:13,165
Dont be silly. Life wouldnt be worthwhile
if we couldnt help others.

539
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:15,444
Ill just put in a call to my friend
and fix it up.

540
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,485
- Thank you.
- Be right back.

541
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:20,006
Now, isnt that nice?

542
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:23,446
Eileen, I wish you wouldnt get
too friendly with him.

543
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:24,678
Why?

544
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:28,844
Hes a pretty smooth operator.

545
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:33,761
- Frank, hes just trying to help.
- But hes not an agent. Hes a reporter.

546
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,248
Id like him to meet Ruth.

547
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,797
<i>She used to be a reporter, too,
on the Columbus Courier.</i>

548
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:40,528
Maybe he could introduce her
to his editor or something, huh?

549
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:41,678
Yeah.

550
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:46,001
Well, its all set.

551
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:48,967
- Youll have to hurry. Ill walk you over.
- Okay. Bye, Frank.

552
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:50,641
Wait a minute. Ill come along, too.

553
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,367
- Good.
- Thats not at all necessary.

554
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,405
Im on my lunch hour
in five minutes, anyway.

555
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:56,047
- Take over, will you, Fred?
- Sure, Frank.

556
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:58,085
Dont you need
some kind of clothes to dance in?

557
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,320
Lve got some rehearsal shorts
right underneath here.

558
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:04,048
- I always come prepared.
- Yeah...

559
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:06,685
- you sure do.
- Well?

560
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,168
Lets go.

561
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,443
I dont know how to thank you,
going to so much trouble.

562
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:17,089
- After all, you hardly know me.
- Thats easily taken care of.

563
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:20,684
- How about tonight?
- I couldnt. Franks coming to dinner.

564
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,322
This is it.

565
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:28,366
Why dont you come to dinner, too?
Lts only spaghetti and meatballs...

566
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,201
but Id really like to have you
meet my sister.

567
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:32,200
I just love spaghetti and meatballs.

568
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:33,881
- Good. About 7:00?
- Right.

569
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:36,529
- Well, here we are.
- Gosh, Im nervous.

570
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:38,918
You dont have to be.
Youre gonna be great.

571
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:43,400
Sure you are. You wait here, Lippencott,
while I introduce her to the boss.

572
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:47,405
Dont forget to say hello
to the piano player. Charlie?

573
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,199
Look, why dont you both wait for me here?

574
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,645
If the other girls know Ive got any pull,
it might be embarrassing. Okay?

575
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:57,687
- Okay, if thats the way you want it.
- Well wait for you. Good luck.

576
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:59,487
- Thank you.
- Eileen.

577
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:03,321
Dont forget to smile.

578
00:39:03,129 --> 00:39:04,323
Eileen.

579
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,606
- What happened?
- Did you get the job?

580
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:09,567
<i>Did I get...
They wanted to know if I stripped!</i>

581
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:11,401
- What?
- Thats a burlesque theatre.

582
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:14,049
- No.
- I didnt even get a chance to audition.

583
00:39:14,129 --> 00:39:17,565
<i>He looked at me with those beady eyes...
Ive never been so embarrassed.</i>

584
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:20,482
You two ought to be ashamed,
sending me to a place like that!

585
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,244
- But I didnt know about it.
- I didnt know anything about it.

586
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:29,325
Miss Blyth, these will be fine.
Have five copies sent up to Mr. Parker.

587
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,445
Excuse me, Mr. Baker wants to see me.

588
00:39:31,529 --> 00:39:33,759
- Your name?
- Ruth Sherwood.

589
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:37,000
His secretary called
and said he wanted me to come right over.

590
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:40,684
- Have you any idea of what he wants?
- Not the vaguest.

591
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:43,044
Mr. Baker seldom confides in me.

592
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:46,478
Miss Wilt, Miss Sherwood.

593
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,725
<i>- Yes?
- Miss Sherwood is here.</i>

594
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,084
<i>- Send her in, please.
- Yes, sir.</i>

595
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:03,923
Hi. That thing look straight to you?

596
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:08,077
- A little higher on the left, I think.
- Little higher on the left.

597
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:09,727
- Hows that?
- Thats better.

598
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:11,561
All righty. Wont you sit down?

599
00:40:11,649 --> 00:40:13,560
- Thank you.
- Wait a minute.

600
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:17,165
There you are. You know, in a years time,
I read an awful lot of stories.

601
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,922
Id say about one in 1,000 has any merit.

602
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:22,967
About one in every 5,000 writers
makes the grade.

603
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:25,244
Lately, I would bet it was one in a million.

604
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:28,401
I told you that day in the elevator
that I thought you had talent.

605
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:30,639
I still do. There we are.

606
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:34,199
You have it when you write about something
youve had some experience with.

607
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:36,849
With which youve had some experience.

608
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:39,119
- Another qualification...
- No, thank you.

609
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:43,282
Another qualification is perseverance,
and that youve certainly got.

610
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:46,918
Even in the face of those
atrocious love stories, you wouldnt give up.

611
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:51,002
Did you really kill all these animals,
or just insult them to death?

612
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:54,685
Will you please let me finish
before you start swinging at me?

613
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:58,239
<i>This story of yours,
My Sister Eileen, I think thats wonderful.</i>

614
00:40:58,569 --> 00:40:59,638
- You do?
- I do.

615
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:03,165
I havent enjoyed reading anything so much
in a long time. Thats charming.

616
00:41:03,249 --> 00:41:06,321
Its funny. Its also very real.
Now do you get my point?

617
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:09,879
<i>Obviously, you were writing about people
and incidents that you were familiar...</i>

618
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:12,847
<i>With which...
That you had observed firsthand.</i>

619
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:15,566
What makes you so sure?

620
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,283
Lts my business, Miss Sherwood.
Let me prove my point.

621
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:21,041
First, you write three phoney love stories.

622
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:25,044
All of a sudden, you turn around, start
writing about your beautiful sister, Eileen...

623
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:26,767
that has a dozen men running after her...

624
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,841
and shes got them dangling like puppets
on the end of a string...

625
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:32,489
wrapped around her little finger.
Thats delightful.

626
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:37,085
But by comparison, those three love stories,
theyre completely unbelievable.

627
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:38,962
- They are?
- They are.

628
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:40,960
Now, wheres the answer?

629
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:44,761
Suppose I told you
I dont even have a sister?

630
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:46,960
All right, then you dont have a sister...

631
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:49,722
then shes a good friend of yours.
Whoever she is, shes real.

632
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:52,642
I bet you my bottom buck
shes somebody you know pretty well.

633
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:56,722
Matter of fact, Id like to know her myself.
She sounds like quite a girl.

634
00:41:56,809 --> 00:41:58,128
Who is she?

635
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:02,843
I hate to admit it, Mr. Baker...

636
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:05,918
but youre a very discerning man.

637
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:10,168
It just happens that Eileen
and the inexperienced...

638
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:14,679
frustrated, spinsterish Ruth Sherwood...

639
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:16,805
are one and the same.

640
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:22,242
<i>You mean... You tell me that this...</i>

641
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:27,919
All those experiences? You?

642
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:31,528
All those men?

643
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,848
I guess the single girls in Columbus
were happy to see you leave.

644
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:41,885
It wasnt as bad as all that.

645
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:45,166
- I coloured the stories a little.
- Naturally.

646
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:47,763
<i>- You know, literary licence.
- Yeah...</i>

647
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:52,568
What about that army pilot...

648
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:56,085
that flew all the way from Nome, Alaska
to bring you a birthday present?

649
00:42:56,169 --> 00:42:57,966
Danny Marshall.

650
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:00,719
He always was impulsive.

651
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:07,320
Well, no wonder they voted you
the girl most likely to marry a millionaire.

652
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:11,762
Every girl gets voted the most likely
to do something or other, doesnt she?

653
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:14,568
Yeah. How come you never did get married?

654
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:18,399
I have to think of my career.

655
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:24,083
Miss Sherwood, would you consider
having dinner with me tonight?

656
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:30,327
Lm sorry. Id love to...

657
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:32,999
but I have a previous engagement.

658
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:36,877
Thats too bad. Couldnt you break it?
I could sure break mine.

659
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:41,038
- No, I couldnt. Hed be terribly upset.
- Im sure he would.

660
00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:45,841
- The least I could do is drive you home.
- No, Id rather you wouldnt.

661
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:50,162
Frank. He said he might be early
and it might be embarrassing.

662
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:53,207
- Hes terribly jealous.
- I just said I was gonna drive you home.

663
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:56,599
- You dont have to ask me up.
- Its not up, its down.

664
00:43:58,209 --> 00:44:02,088
Thank you very much anyway, Mr. Baker.
Perhaps some other time.

665
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:05,366
It was nice seeing you. Ill get a hold of you
about that story of yours.

666
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:06,677
Yes.

667
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:10,520
- Thank you very much, Mr. Baker.
- Just call me Bob.

668
00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:48,327
Im sorry, honey.

669
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:51,125
Thats all right, Helen, baby.

670
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:53,677
- Did you ask the girls yet?
- Not yet.

671
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:57,081
I sure wish you would ask them.
After all, shes your mother.

672
00:44:57,169 --> 00:45:00,047
All right, already, well ask them together.
Come on.

673
00:45:27,689 --> 00:45:30,408
Ruth, where have you been?
I was so worried about you.

674
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:33,765
- I wish youd left me a note or something.
- Im sorry. I was in such a rush.

675
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:36,921
- I got a call from Mr. Baker.
- You did? What happened?

676
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:39,807
- He liked one of my stories.
- Really? How wonderful!

677
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:42,084
He didnt say hed publish it.
He just said liked it.

678
00:45:42,169 --> 00:45:44,637
But thats a start. Did he like you?

679
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,839
- He invited me to dinner.
- And what did you say?

680
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:51,204
- I didnt accept.
- Why not?

681
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:55,597
Hes a big bore, hes fat,
and hes getting bald.

682
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:58,479
You wouldnt like him, either.

683
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:02,406
What about you? Your drugstore friend
called about an audition or something.

684
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:06,482
I know. I went. Ruth, it was just terrible.
I was furious at Frank and Chick.

685
00:46:06,569 --> 00:46:08,446
- I didnt know...
- Wait. Frank and who?

686
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:12,488
Chick. Hes a boy I met at the drugstore.
In fact, I invited him for dinner.

687
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,084
- Im still a little mad at him, but...
- Now wait a minute...

688
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:18,485
- Who is it?
- Me and Helen.

689
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:20,162
Come in.

690
00:46:21,249 --> 00:46:22,682
- Hi, Helen.
- Hi.

691
00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:24,088
Hi, Wreck.

692
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:27,444
Yeah?

693
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:32,089
<i>This is a little embarrassing, but...</i>

694
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:34,558
You see, the Wreck and I have a problem.

695
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:37,083
Wed be glad to help if we can.

696
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:39,687
Whats the matter?

697
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:46,680
Helen got a letter from her old lady.
Shes coming here for a visit.

698
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:49,078
- How nice.
- Its not nice at all.

699
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:52,481
She doesnt know
Im sharing my apartment with a man.

700
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:54,799
But its a perfectly innocent arrangement.

701
00:46:54,889 --> 00:46:58,165
Yeah, but Ma doesnt know
from innocent arrangements.

702
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,243
So we were thinking...

703
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:04,239
maybe you girls wouldnt mind
putting me up in the kitchen?

704
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:06,285
- Yeah.
- In the kitchen?

705
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:09,362
Theres not enough room out there
to put up preserves.

706
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:13,408
He wouldnt be any trouble, really.
And it would only be for a couple of days.

707
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:15,207
And hes real handy.

708
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:19,840
- He could clean up and do the dishes and...
- But no sewing. Thats womans work.

709
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:24,438
I guess we could put him up
for a couple of days.

710
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:25,723
Now, wait a minute.

711
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,765
- Thanks, Eileen.
- Thanks a lot.

712
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:30,647
I just happen to have
a few of my things out here.

713
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:35,684
Boy, you dont know what a help this is.

714
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,327
Gee, thanks, Ruth.

715
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,759
Ill bring my toothbrush tomorrow.

716
00:47:43,129 --> 00:47:46,565
Something tells me you werent quite ready
to leave Ohio.

717
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:48,725
But, Ruth, theyre in love.

718
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:52,122
And besides, well feel a lot safer
having a man in the house.

719
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:55,679
If you had your way, wed live at the YMCA.
Somethings burning.

720
00:47:56,529 --> 00:47:58,884
What about this man you invited to dinner?

721
00:47:58,969 --> 00:48:02,848
<i>Yes. His name is Chick Clark,
and hes a reporter on The Daily News...</i>

722
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:04,840
and hes very attractive.

723
00:48:05,689 --> 00:48:09,364
Honey, if its all the same to you,
theres a movie Id like to see.

724
00:48:09,729 --> 00:48:13,688
But, Ruth, I invited him for you.
Why, hes very interested in your work.

725
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:17,838
Sure. I bet you hes so interested,
he cant wait to get you alone.

726
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:20,400
You got to get over that attitude.

727
00:48:20,489 --> 00:48:24,118
How can you ever expect to fall in love
if you dont meet any boys?

728
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:26,325
Who wants to fall in love?

729
00:48:26,729 --> 00:48:29,448
<i>That might interfere with my career</i>

730
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:33,046
<i>And from what I hear, men are not sincere</i>

731
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:36,118
I dont think thats true at all, Ruth.

732
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:39,997
<i>Why, theyre only big bad boys</i>

733
00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:43,042
<i>Fellows can be fun</i>

734
00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:45,679
<i>And its wonderful</i>

735
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,401
<i>When you meet that certain one</i>

736
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:54,678
How do you know
when youve met that certain one?

737
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:57,363
Whats gonna happen? How will you feel?

738
00:48:57,729 --> 00:48:59,242
How will I feel?

739
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:05,325
Ltll be like, I just know.

740
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,359
<i>Theres nothing like love</i>

741
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:10,405
<i>Its a grand, grand feeling</i>

742
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,720
<i>It really is a gift from up above</i>

743
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:16,565
<i>What else in the universe</i>

744
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:18,560
<i>Thrills you so</i>

745
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:19,684
<i>Nothing</i>

746
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:22,649
<i>No, theres nothing like love</i>

747
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:26,517
<i>Theres nothing on earth
That is more appealing</i>

748
00:49:26,649 --> 00:49:30,005
<i>Than walking with your fellow hand in glove</i>

749
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:34,648
<i>What else gives a person
That sweet, warm glow</i>

750
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:35,878
<i>Nothing</i>

751
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:38,559
<i>No, theres nothing like love</i>

752
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:42,278
<i>If I ever meet the boy</i>

753
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:45,960
<i>What a lucky girl Ill be</i>

754
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:50,445
<i>There might be greater joy</i>

755
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:53,688
<i>But if there is, you tell me</i>

756
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:59,042
<i>Theres nothing like love
When the dawn comes stealing</i>

757
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:02,724
<i>And suddenly the stars have lost their light</i>

758
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:07,242
<i>Hell look in your eyes
And hell sigh and say</i>

759
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:10,958
<i>Thanks for a wonderful night</i>

760
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:14,640
<i>And then youre all alone</i>

761
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:19,084
<i>The sky is bright above</i>

762
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:22,442
<i>And, oh, youre so aware</i>

763
00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:24,565
<i>That there is nothing</i>

764
00:50:25,209 --> 00:50:27,484
<i>No, theres nothing like love</i>

765
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:31,199
Gee, I thought I was in love
at least a dozen times.

766
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:34,725
- And while it lasted, it was beautiful.
- Yeah, while it lasted.

767
00:50:34,809 --> 00:50:39,280
At least when the right one comes along,
llI know it. What have you got against it?

768
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:42,809
I dont know. I guess Im just chicken.

769
00:50:43,129 --> 00:50:46,804
I know whats the matter with you.
You just havent met the right one.

770
00:50:46,889 --> 00:50:48,117
I havent?

771
00:50:49,649 --> 00:50:51,082
You just wait.

772
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:52,718
One of these days...

773
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:56,438
a big, handsome hero will come
charging up in a white convertible...

774
00:50:56,529 --> 00:50:58,599
and sweep you off your feet.

775
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:17,203
May I have the pleasure, Miss Sherwood?

776
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:20,681
Id be delighted.

777
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:31,043
- Excuse me.
- Thats perfectly all right.

778
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:40,244
- Youre lovely tonight.
- Thank you.

779
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:50,926
Lets see what we can do
about splitting three meatballs four ways.

780
00:51:51,009 --> 00:51:52,044
Good girl.

781
00:51:56,569 --> 00:51:59,925
<i>And skies are bright above</i>

782
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:03,126
<i>A girl is so aware</i>

783
00:52:03,209 --> 00:52:06,565
<i>That there is nothing</i>

784
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:09,325
<i>Theres nothing like love</i>

785
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:11,321
<i>- Nothing
- Nothing</i>

786
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:13,844
<i>Nothing</i>

787
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:17,845
<i>Theres nothing</i>

788
00:52:18,449 --> 00:52:23,398
<i>Like love</i>

789
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,841
Did you make some salad dressing?

790
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,965
Yes, in the blue bowl behind the milk bottle.

791
00:52:43,049 --> 00:52:45,199
- You better get ready.
- Youre right.

792
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,077
I borrowed a pair of your stockings.
I hope you dont mind.

793
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:50,239
Of course not. Theres one of the boys.

794
00:52:50,569 --> 00:52:51,684
Hurry.

795
00:52:53,049 --> 00:52:54,198
Come in.

796
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:56,680
- Hello.
- How do you do?

797
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,926
- Thats all right. Everybody does it.
- Sorry.

798
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,681
We tried to fix it.

799
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:03,441
You must be Frank Lippencott.

800
00:53:03,529 --> 00:53:06,327
Thats right.
And you must be Eileens sister.

801
00:53:06,409 --> 00:53:08,127
Thats what they call me.

802
00:53:08,209 --> 00:53:10,598
Of course, youre a different type.

803
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:12,566
Yeah. Wont you sit down?

804
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:19,043
Lts hot.

805
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,208
- Eileen, Frank is here.
- Ill be right out.

806
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:26,725
Would you excuse me a minute?

807
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:29,443
Shes not still mad
about this afternoon, is she?

808
00:53:29,529 --> 00:53:31,520
I think shell get over it.

809
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:32,598
Good.

810
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:35,317
Eileens been telling me
about your drugstore.

811
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:38,606
- She says you have awfully good food.
- The best.

812
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:40,683
Reasonable, too.

813
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:44,159
From what I understand,
reasonable is not the word for it.

814
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:47,203
- Good evening, Mr. Lippencott.
- Good evening, Eileen.

815
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:48,563
<i>We dont have to use these...</i>

816
00:53:48,649 --> 00:53:51,721
I hope youre still not mad about
this afternoon. It really wasnt my fault.

817
00:53:51,809 --> 00:53:54,118
Charlie, the piano player,
he never said a thing to me.

818
00:53:54,209 --> 00:53:55,961
- I bet. Lets move the table.
- Let me help.

819
00:53:56,049 --> 00:53:59,166
- No, thats all right, we can manage.
- So help me, its the truth.

820
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,968
If it isnt, may I be struck dead on this spot.

821
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:07,881
- What the devil was that?
- Come in, Mr. Clark.

822
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:09,964
Is it safe?

823
00:54:10,049 --> 00:54:12,438
Of course.
Theyre just blasting for the new subway.

824
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:14,599
It doesnt happen very often.

825
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:16,727
This is my sister Ruth.

826
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:18,720
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

827
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,362
You still mad?

828
00:54:21,249 --> 00:54:23,809
I didnt know anything about that deal.
Ill take an oath.

829
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:26,278
Dont do it.
Youll get the surprise of your life.

830
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:28,200
No. Im not mad anymore.

831
00:54:28,289 --> 00:54:31,087
I know you two boys
were just trying to help.

832
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:38,161
Now that were all one big happy family,
why dont we sit down?

833
00:54:38,249 --> 00:54:39,762
Sure. Of course.

834
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:43,081
- Please.
- Thank you.

835
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:55,845
- Dinner will be ready soon.
- It wont be long at all.

836
00:54:58,649 --> 00:55:02,847
- I wish we could offer you a drink.
- So do I. Its hotter than blazes in here.

837
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:07,681
This is for you, Eileen.
Its a California Burgundy-type wine.

838
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:10,600
I thought it would go good
with the spaghetti.

839
00:55:10,689 --> 00:55:13,203
- Thank you.
- Its a special were running this week.

840
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:14,961
So is our spaghetti.

841
00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:17,882
- Ill get the glasses and some ice.
- No ice.

842
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:21,200
This is the kind of wine that should be
served at the temperature of the room.

843
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:24,008
Then you better cook it a couple of hours.

844
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:29,006
Eileen tells me
youre a newspaperman, Mr. Clark.

845
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:30,158
Thats right.

846
00:55:30,249 --> 00:55:32,558
- She tells me you write, too.
- Yes.

847
00:55:32,649 --> 00:55:34,924
Thats quite a girl, your sister.

848
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:38,600
Ive been turning her over
in my mind all afternoon.

849
00:55:38,929 --> 00:55:40,362
You dont say.

850
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:44,519
This is quite a studio you have here.

851
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:49,205
Ive heard a lot about Greenwich Village,
but this is the first time Ive ever been...

852
00:55:49,729 --> 00:55:50,764
here.

853
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:56,439
- Frank! Lm so sorry.
- Whats the matter? What happened?

854
00:55:56,529 --> 00:55:58,759
- The water wagon.
- Oh, no, llI get a towel.

855
00:55:58,849 --> 00:56:01,682
- Hello, darlings.
- Well, dont bother to knock.

856
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:04,886
I brought the plumber to look at the wall.
Hell only be a minute.

857
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:08,484
This is a fine time to be conscientious.
Dont you see we have guests?

858
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:09,968
My apologies.

859
00:56:10,249 --> 00:56:13,605
By the way, I would appreciate knowing
if you intend staying on here.

860
00:56:13,689 --> 00:56:17,364
A lady friend of the previous tenant
has expressed interest in this studio.

861
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:19,599
We can talk about this some other time.

862
00:56:19,689 --> 00:56:23,204
- Hey, Appopolous.
- Will you excuse me for a moment, please?

863
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:28,605
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Officer.

864
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:32,119
- I see youre entertaining.
- I guess you could call it that.

865
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:35,007
Enjoy yourselves,
but keep your noses clean.

866
00:56:36,689 --> 00:56:41,001
- What did he mean by that?
- Weve been playing the piano too loud.

867
00:56:41,169 --> 00:56:43,808
I can fix it, but you got to tear out the wall.

868
00:56:43,889 --> 00:56:45,959
Its all rotted, anyway. Look.

869
00:56:54,049 --> 00:56:55,767
Ruth, what happened?

870
00:56:56,609 --> 00:56:59,248
Anybody here like meatballs in plaster?

871
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,167
Isnt that a shame.

872
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:02,684
Im sorry.

873
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:06,444
Look, dont worry about it.
We can go down to the drugstore and eat.

874
00:57:06,529 --> 00:57:07,644
- Drugstore?
- Sure.

875
00:57:07,729 --> 00:57:10,163
I know a great little spot near here.
Beautiful steaks.

876
00:57:10,249 --> 00:57:13,002
- And the dinners on me. How about it?
- You talked us into it.

877
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:16,604
- Chick, how sweet. Well get our things.
- Dont mention it.

878
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:20,364
As long as were going to go out,
could we go someplace like the El Morocco?

879
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:21,768
El Morocco?

880
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:25,600
- Thats very expensive, dear.
- It is? I didnt know.

881
00:57:25,689 --> 00:57:28,840
The special at the drugstore
is baked Virginia ham.

882
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:31,728
- Sounds good.
- Look, baby, you want to go to El Morocco...

883
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:33,367
El Morocco it is.

884
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:36,767
Isnt it wonderful, Ruth?
We wont be a minute.

885
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:00,206
Chick, this is so exciting.

886
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:02,883
Ive dreamed about coming
to a place like this all my life.

887
00:58:02,969 --> 00:58:05,961
Now that youve seen it, how about
you and me sneaking out of here?

888
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,643
I know a spot uptown
thats just loaded with cosy corners.

889
00:58:08,729 --> 00:58:12,085
But you seem to forget. Im Franks date.
Youre supposed to be with Ruth.

890
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:14,729
She and that soda jerk
are getting along swell.

891
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:17,039
Hes not a soda jerk,
hes the fountain manager.

892
00:58:17,129 --> 00:58:19,438
Besides, you said you were so interested
in Ruths work...

893
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,485
and you havent said a word to her
all evening.

894
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:23,525
I am interested in her work, honey.

895
00:58:23,609 --> 00:58:26,407
Im going to speak to my editor about her
first thing in the morning.

896
00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:28,764
- Promise?
- Why, sure, baby.

897
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:36,647
- Good parfait.
- Is it? Lm glad.

898
00:58:38,329 --> 00:58:40,285
Thats quality ice cream.

899
00:58:42,329 --> 00:58:45,685
- Boy, Eileen sure is a good dancer.
- Yes, she is.

900
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:55,677
Shes really a remarkable girl.
So pretty and talented.

901
00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:58,684
Shes got a healthy appetite, too.

902
00:59:00,129 --> 00:59:02,723
Youre really stuck on her, arent you?

903
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:06,246
I guess a lot of fellows are, huh?

904
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:09,127
- Look, if you dont mind my suggesting...
- No.

905
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:12,159
Faint heart never won fair lady.

906
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:18,641
- You mean I should take the bit in my teeth.
- Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

907
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:21,919
Thats easier said than done.

908
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:23,922
I know what you mean.

909
00:59:28,009 --> 00:59:32,207
Ive seen a lot of girls come in and out
of the store since Ive been working there.

910
00:59:34,209 --> 00:59:35,642
Nice ones, too.

911
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:38,766
Never one like Eileen.

912
00:59:43,889 --> 00:59:47,199
Ill never forget
the first time she came in the store.

913
00:59:48,529 --> 00:59:50,565
<i>I was filling the sugar...</i>

914
00:59:51,529 --> 00:59:53,599
Whats the matter, you drop something?

915
00:59:53,689 --> 00:59:55,247
Yes, my compact.

916
01:00:00,169 --> 01:00:01,921
Good evening, Miss Sherwood.

917
01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:03,601
- Mr. Baker.
- Yeah.

918
01:00:03,689 --> 01:00:05,520
Fancy meeting you here.

919
01:00:05,649 --> 01:00:07,207
Mr. Baker, Mr. Lippencott.

920
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:08,881
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

921
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:10,163
Shall we?

922
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:16,487
Now, may I present Miss Stewart.
Miss Sherwood, Mr. Lippencott.

923
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:19,367
This is a very pleasant surprise.
Maybe youd care to join us?

924
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,327
- Thanks very much, but were with Ruths...
- Friends.

925
01:00:22,409 --> 01:00:25,207
As a matter of fact,
we were just getting ready to leave.

926
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,563
Thats too bad.

927
01:00:26,649 --> 01:00:29,004
- It was nice meeting you, Lippencott.
- Lippencott.

928
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:31,239
- Ruth was telling me all about you.
- She was?

929
01:00:31,329 --> 01:00:34,605
Yeah. Shes a very remarkable girl.
I dont blame you for being jealous.

930
01:00:34,689 --> 01:00:36,407
Good night. Nice to have seen you.

931
01:00:36,489 --> 01:00:38,081
- Good night.
- Good night.

932
01:00:39,729 --> 01:00:42,527
He seems like a very nice fellow. Very nice.

933
01:00:42,689 --> 01:00:45,283
I think hes got me mixed up
with somebody else, though.

934
01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:46,438
Who is he?

935
01:00:46,529 --> 01:00:49,839
Hes just a fellow
whos got me mixed up with somebody else.

936
01:00:50,249 --> 01:00:53,685
- Would you like some more coffee, madam?
- No, thank you. The cheque please.

937
01:00:53,769 --> 01:00:56,567
- Whats the matter? Dont you feel well?
- No.

938
01:00:57,289 --> 01:01:01,328
- How are you two lovebirds getting along?
- Ruths not feeling too well.

939
01:01:01,569 --> 01:01:02,638
Whats the matter?

940
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:04,799
llI have a daiquiri, please.

941
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:08,162
- And a Gibson.
- A daiquiri and a Gibson. Yes, Mr. Baker.

942
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:10,524
As I was telling you,
Mr. Powers was terribly upset...

943
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:12,565
<i>that I couldnt do
the bathing suit for Vogue.</i>

944
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:14,605
<i>But I already had a hat layout for Harpers.</i>

945
01:01:14,689 --> 01:01:16,042
With all the models in New York...

946
01:01:16,129 --> 01:01:19,758
youd think they could find one
to do a simple bathing suit layout.

947
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:26,841
Everybody told me how hard it would be
to get started modelling...

948
01:01:26,929 --> 01:01:28,487
but I didnt have any trouble at all.

949
01:01:28,569 --> 01:01:31,879
My folks wanted me to be a stenographer,
but that takes so much studying.

950
01:01:31,969 --> 01:01:33,322
Its really amazing when you consider...

951
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:35,286
that Ive only been in New York
for eight months...

952
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:38,725
and already Ive had my picture on the cover
of three of the biggest magazines.

953
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:39,924
Amazing.

954
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:49,686
- Im sorry you dont feel well, Ruth.
- Yes, thats a shame.

955
01:01:49,769 --> 01:01:52,761
- Why dont you take her home, Lippencott?
- I feel much better now.

956
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:55,921
As a matter of fact,
I feel so much better, Id like to feel better.

957
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:58,477
- Lets go someplace and have a drink.
- Why, Ruth.

958
01:01:58,569 --> 01:01:59,604
Why not?

959
01:01:59,689 --> 01:02:02,886
There are a lot of people having a good time
tonight, why shouldnt we?

960
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,119
- Call a cab, Chick.
- Get a cab.

961
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:17,083
Ruth, put your shoes on. Youll catch cold.

962
01:02:17,169 --> 01:02:19,729
Step on a crack,
you break your uncles back.

963
01:02:20,729 --> 01:02:22,242
Its after 3:00.

964
01:02:22,529 --> 01:02:26,238
Thats why Ive got my shoes off.
Im tippy-toeing.

965
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:28,684
I dont care. You put your shoes on.

966
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,082
That makes a grand total of...

967
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:36,326
$27.52...

968
01:02:36,809 --> 01:02:38,527
<i>half of which is...</i>

969
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:43,120
- What is it?
- Look at the bandstand.

970
01:02:46,569 --> 01:02:49,800
They have concerts here
every Tuesday night during the summer.

971
01:02:49,889 --> 01:02:51,880
Its just like Kiplinger Park in Columbus.

972
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:54,278
Ruth used to play the cymbals
in the high school band.

973
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:55,438
- No.
- Yeah.

974
01:02:55,529 --> 01:03:00,080
Best little cymbal player in Kiplinger High.
Eileen was a drum majorette.

975
01:03:00,169 --> 01:03:03,445
Really? I played second trombone
at East Denver.

976
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:06,928
I was the ill wind that never blew good.

977
01:03:08,609 --> 01:03:11,248
- How about you?
- I never played anything but the races.

978
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,923
Its about time you learnt. Come here.

979
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:16,801
You can play this.

980
01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:20,561
- What is it?
- What does it look like? Lts a bass fiddle.

981
01:03:20,649 --> 01:03:24,164
- Of course, how stupid of me.
- Eileen, did you bring your drum?

982
01:03:24,249 --> 01:03:28,322
- I never leave the house without it.
- How about you? Lets hear a few notes.

983
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,328
Its beautiful.

984
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:33,488
Sound your A.

985
01:03:34,249 --> 01:03:35,284
Drum.

986
01:03:35,369 --> 01:03:36,404
Trombone.

987
01:03:38,529 --> 01:03:39,564
Ready?

988
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:41,523
One, two, three.

989
01:03:56,609 --> 01:03:59,919
<i>Give me a band</i>

990
01:04:00,009 --> 01:04:02,045
<i>And my baby</i>

991
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:06,564
<i>And an orchestration full of syncopation</i>

992
01:04:06,649 --> 01:04:08,560
<i>With a sensational beat</i>

993
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:13,488
<i>Give me that band and my baby</i>

994
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:17,758
<i>Lordy, thats perfection,
Tell it, rhythm section</i>

995
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:19,885
<i>I have no objection to heat</i>

996
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:25,319
<i>Give me that sound
That makes a gal and her fellow yell</i>

997
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:28,481
<i>Hot diggity dog!</i>

998
01:04:28,609 --> 01:04:31,885
<i>I adore those croony, swoony baritones</i>

999
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:35,439
<i>But tonight I want to jump
To trumpets and saxophones</i>

1000
01:04:35,529 --> 01:04:39,158
<i>Professor, I dont mean maybe</i>

1001
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,758
<i>When I shake a footsie
With my tootsie-wootsie</i>

1002
01:04:43,889 --> 01:04:47,165
<i>I could dance from here
To dear old Dixieland</i>

1003
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:50,127
<i>Baby, give me my baby</i>

1004
01:04:50,209 --> 01:04:52,928
<i>And a band</i>

1005
01:06:30,249 --> 01:06:31,967
Once more, everybody.

1006
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:36,603
Once again.

1007
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:49,447
<i>Give me that sound</i>

1008
01:06:49,649 --> 01:06:52,402
<i>That makes a gal and her fellow yell</i>

1009
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:54,639
<i>Hot diggity dog!</i>

1010
01:06:55,809 --> 01:06:59,006
<i>I adore those croony, swoony baritones</i>

1011
01:06:59,089 --> 01:07:02,525
<i>But tonight I want to jump
To trumpets and saxophones</i>

1012
01:07:02,609 --> 01:07:06,443
<i>Professor, I dont mean maybe</i>

1013
01:07:07,169 --> 01:07:10,764
<i>When I shake a footsie
With my tootsie-wootsie</i>

1014
01:07:10,849 --> 01:07:14,319
<i>I could dance from here

1015
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:16,923
<i>Baby, give me my baby</i>

1016
01:07:17,169 --> 01:07:19,808
<i>And a good old ragtime</i>

1017
01:07:20,089 --> 01:07:21,681
<i>Give me some ragtime</i>

1018
01:07:21,769 --> 01:07:26,399
<i>Red-hot ragtime band</i>

1019
01:07:33,769 --> 01:07:35,043
Thank you.

1020
01:07:48,809 --> 01:07:51,562
- Did you finish it?
- I think its delightful.

1021
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:53,719
Yeah, so do I.
But do you think its possible?

1022
01:07:53,809 --> 01:07:56,846
You mean, the girl in the story
and the author are one and the same?

1023
01:07:56,929 --> 01:07:59,966
- Yeah.
- Offhand, Id say no.

1024
01:08:00,689 --> 01:08:03,965
But then you never can tell
about us women. Why?

1025
01:08:05,089 --> 01:08:07,159
I think she kind of likes me.

1026
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:09,405
I mean, why else would she try
and convince me...

1027
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:11,161
shes the belle of the ball, you see.

1028
01:08:11,249 --> 01:08:13,717
It could be she just wants
to get her story published.

1029
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:14,878
No.

1030
01:08:17,809 --> 01:08:21,040
- Do you think so?
- You never can tell about us women.

1031
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:25,847
See if you can get her on the phone for me.

1032
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:37,407
<i>- Hello.
- Well, hello.</i>

1033
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:39,764
<i>You and your friends
have a nice time last night?</i>

1034
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:42,044
<i>- Yes. Wonderful.
- Good.</i>

1035
01:08:43,009 --> 01:08:44,647
By the way, who was the beautiful blond?

1036
01:08:45,249 --> 01:08:49,083
Her. Shes a friend of my friends friend.

1037
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:51,878
<i>I was wondering.
Are you busy for dinner tonight?</i>

1038
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:53,004
Tonight?

1039
01:08:53,489 --> 01:08:55,605
I do want to talk to you about your stories...

1040
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:58,249
and I know you must be awfully sick
of nightclubs by now.

1041
01:08:58,329 --> 01:09:02,447
So I thought it would be nice
if we just had a quiet dinner. At my place.

1042
01:09:04,529 --> 01:09:06,759
I think that would be charming.

1043
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:09,245
<i>Wonderful. Ill pick you up around 7:00.</i>

1044
01:09:09,329 --> 01:09:12,526
No, dont do that. Ill be uptown anyway.

1045
01:09:13,009 --> 01:09:14,522
Whats the address?

1046
01:09:14,809 --> 01:09:16,720
Excuse me. Just a minute.

1047
01:09:22,729 --> 01:09:25,766
Yes? What is it? Yes.

1048
01:09:27,369 --> 01:09:31,248
Ive got it. Yes, thank you.
Ive got it. Goodbye.

1049
01:09:32,609 --> 01:09:35,601
- Another guy for Eileen?
- Not if I can help it.

1050
01:09:37,249 --> 01:09:40,685
- Which way you want these pleats turned?
- Toward Mecca.

1051
01:09:56,089 --> 01:09:57,602
Twice.

1052
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:01,360
- Have some more coffee.
- No, thanks.

1053
01:10:01,449 --> 01:10:04,885
- No? A little bit of brandy.
- Yeah, I think Id like that.

1054
01:10:05,129 --> 01:10:06,528
- Excuse me.
- Ill clear the dishes.

1055
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:08,839
Thats all right. Leave them.
Here. Put them right down there.

1056
01:10:08,929 --> 01:10:11,204
- I dont mind.
- Dont bother yourself. Its not necessary.

1057
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:12,438
I do it at home all the time.

1058
01:10:12,529 --> 01:10:15,441
Thats all right, the maid comes in
in the morning.

1059
01:10:15,729 --> 01:10:17,048
Have a seat.

1060
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:22,081
- You know, youre a wonderful cook.
- Thank you. Just one of my hobbies.

1061
01:10:22,369 --> 01:10:23,882
Im glad you like spaghetti.

1062
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:27,484
Thats my favourite dish. As a matter of fact,
I dont think I could live without it.

1063
01:10:27,569 --> 01:10:28,684
I have to make a confession.

1064
01:10:28,769 --> 01:10:31,727
I buy my sauce
down at Papa Grenuccis on the corner.

1065
01:10:38,329 --> 01:10:39,842
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1066
01:10:42,209 --> 01:10:45,838
By the way, I did some work
on that story that you liked.

1067
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:48,518
I think I improved it a little bit.

1068
01:10:48,609 --> 01:10:51,681
- Would you like to read it?
- Id love to. Later.

1069
01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:54,888
I dont want to force the issue...

1070
01:10:54,969 --> 01:10:59,281
but somethings come up that may make it
necessary for me go to back to Columbus.

1071
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:02,682
Come on. Lets not talk about business now.

1072
01:11:03,569 --> 01:11:05,958
When do you think you could let me know?

1073
01:11:06,089 --> 01:11:07,568
Maybe tomorrow.

1074
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:10,088
Maybe tonight.

1075
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,241
You know, I can certainly see...

1076
01:11:16,329 --> 01:11:19,719
how you wrapped all those men
around your little finger.

1077
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:21,846
Bob, Id like to explain about that.

1078
01:11:21,929 --> 01:11:23,806
Theres nothing youve to explain
about that.

1079
01:11:23,889 --> 01:11:26,562
Thats just something
with which you were born.

1080
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,561
Ruth, you know, you and I
could have a wonderful time together.

1081
01:11:29,649 --> 01:11:33,437
I mean, youre so intelligent,
you have such a great sense of humour...

1082
01:11:35,649 --> 01:11:38,561
and youre well-read, appealing.

1083
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,843
Best of all, you dont want to get married.

1084
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:47,289
Yes, of course. My career.

1085
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:54,845
I may be taking an awful lot for granted...

1086
01:11:54,929 --> 01:11:58,478
but by now, you must know
that youre very attractive to me...

1087
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:02,198
and I only hope
that Im a little bit attractive to you.

1088
01:12:04,369 --> 01:12:06,405
Yes, certainly. You are.

1089
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:08,561
Lets drink to it.

1090
01:12:15,689 --> 01:12:16,758
To us.

1091
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:25,126
<i>Its bigger than you and me</i>

1092
01:12:25,369 --> 01:12:28,884
<i>Its mad and yet its right</i>

1093
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:33,402
<i>One mad unforgettable night</i>

1094
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,488
<i>Is worth a lifetime of dreams</i>

1095
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:38,480
<i>Wed be fools to fight it</i>

1096
01:12:39,929 --> 01:12:42,523
<i>Its bigger than both of us</i>

1097
01:12:43,009 --> 01:12:46,285
<i>Its fate, it had to be</i>

1098
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:49,960
<i>Keep the moment tender</i>

1099
01:12:50,169 --> 01:12:52,444
<i>Why wait, lets surrender</i>

1100
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:57,326
<i>Its bigger than you and me</i>

1101
01:12:59,129 --> 01:13:00,278
<i>Bigger</i>

1102
01:13:00,889 --> 01:13:01,924
<i>Mad</i>

1103
01:13:02,969 --> 01:13:04,288
<i>The wildest</i>

1104
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:11,047
<i>What do you say, baby</i>

1105
01:13:11,129 --> 01:13:13,438
<i>Its worth a lifetime of dreams</i>

1106
01:13:13,529 --> 01:13:16,327
<i>And wed be fools to fight it</i>

1107
01:13:17,129 --> 01:13:20,246
<i>Its bigger than both of us</i>

1108
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,523
<i>Its fate</i>

1109
01:13:22,209 --> 01:13:24,086
<i>It had to be</i>

1110
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:27,240
<i>Keep the moment tender</i>

1111
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:29,804
<i>Why wait, lets surrender</i>

1112
01:13:30,249 --> 01:13:34,925
<i>Its bigger than you and me</i>

1113
01:13:36,129 --> 01:13:38,484
You sure you wouldnt like
to read the story now?

1114
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:42,084
I know youll like the construction
better than the way that it was constructed.

1115
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:45,923
<i>Now the construction is motivated by
the characters reaction to the motivation...</i>

1116
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:49,479
<i>You know, you couldnt make things happen
if they wouldnt, and vice versa...</i>

1117
01:13:49,569 --> 01:13:51,446
<i>Why wait, lets surrender</i>

1118
01:13:52,049 --> 01:13:54,609
<i>Its bigger than you</i>

1119
01:13:55,129 --> 01:13:59,247
<i>And me</i>

1120
01:14:00,209 --> 01:14:03,918
Are you sure you want to publish my story,
or is this a package deal?

1121
01:14:04,009 --> 01:14:07,843
Dont be so naive. Im no different
than any of the other men in Eileens life.

1122
01:14:07,929 --> 01:14:10,204
Come on, twist me around your little finger.
Come on, twist.

1123
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:11,358
Slow down.

1124
01:14:12,009 --> 01:14:14,648
- Youve got the wrong idea about Eileen.
- I have?

1125
01:14:14,729 --> 01:14:16,481
There may have been
a lot of men in her life...

1126
01:14:16,569 --> 01:14:18,764
but she never handled them
the way you seem to think she did.

1127
01:14:18,849 --> 01:14:20,328
- Didnt she?
- No, she didnt she.

1128
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:21,842
If you think youre going to stuff me...

1129
01:14:21,929 --> 01:14:24,159
and hang me in your office
with the rest of your trophies...

1130
01:14:24,249 --> 01:14:28,322
- youre fishing in the wrong stream.
- Wait a minute. I just want to explain.

1131
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:34,565
Thanks for the dinner and the floorshow,
but the prices are ridiculous.

1132
01:14:34,649 --> 01:14:36,002
Wait. Please.

1133
01:14:36,089 --> 01:14:38,080
The least you can do
is let me drive you home.

1134
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:39,204
No.

1135
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:41,803
Look, I dont blame you
for thinking that I more or less...

1136
01:14:41,889 --> 01:14:45,484
- Give me a dime.
- What? Give you a dime? What for?

1137
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:49,005
- For the subway.
- Come on. Ruth, this is so silly.

1138
01:14:49,089 --> 01:14:51,000
<i>I just wanted to... Ruth.</i>

1139
01:15:03,409 --> 01:15:06,367
Do you really think
youll have to go back home?

1140
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:08,042
Lm afraid so.

1141
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:10,558
Unless something happens tomorrow.

1142
01:15:12,689 --> 01:15:14,600
I guess Id better go in.

1143
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:17,886
I have to get up early
and make the rounds again.

1144
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:21,847
- Thanks for the fan.
- Its a special this week.

1145
01:15:22,409 --> 01:15:25,321
Youd be surprised
what a breeze that little thing gives off.

1146
01:15:25,409 --> 01:15:27,843
Everybody in the stores got a cold.

1147
01:15:30,529 --> 01:15:32,281
- Good night.
- Eileen...

1148
01:15:33,089 --> 01:15:35,398
I dont have many responsibilities.

1149
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:38,083
I live alone, and Im pretty frugal.

1150
01:15:38,769 --> 01:15:41,158
<i>- And...
- Yes, Frank?</i>

1151
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:46,040
- Ive saved a little money, and if I can help...
- Thank you, but we couldnt.

1152
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:49,485
If you could just stay
just a little while longer...

1153
01:15:49,809 --> 01:15:52,323
Im sure something good would happen.

1154
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:55,925
Something good just did happen.
Youre very sweet.

1155
01:15:57,769 --> 01:15:59,043
Good night.

1156
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,563
Good night.

1157
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:27,724
Gee, Eileen,
I wish you didnt have to go back to Ohio.

1158
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:32,477
Its going to be just terrible
not seeing you in the drugstore anymore.

1159
01:16:34,009 --> 01:16:35,283
Besides...

1160
01:16:35,849 --> 01:16:39,159
next week weve got a special
on wedding rings.

1161
01:16:40,689 --> 01:16:45,319
<i>I know how much you want a career, and
I wish you all the luck in the world, but...</i>

1162
01:16:46,289 --> 01:16:48,359
<i>If you said that Im the boy</i>

1163
01:16:49,089 --> 01:16:51,444
<i>What a lucky boy Id be</i>

1164
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:54,759
<i>There might be greater joy</i>

1165
01:16:55,929 --> 01:16:58,523
<i>But if there is, you tell me</i>

1166
01:16:59,769 --> 01:17:03,557
<i>Theres nothing like love
When the dawn comes stealing</i>

1167
01:17:03,769 --> 01:17:07,079
<i>And suddenly the stars
Have lost their light</i>

1168
01:17:07,649 --> 01:17:11,244
<i>You look in her eyes and you sigh and say</i>

1169
01:17:11,649 --> 01:17:14,288
<i>Thanks for a wonderful night</i>

1170
01:17:15,449 --> 01:17:18,122
<i>But here I am with you</i>

1171
01:17:19,249 --> 01:17:21,968
<i>The moon is still above</i>

1172
01:17:23,249 --> 01:17:27,959
<i>And Im so aware that there is nothing</i>

1173
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,885
<i>No, theres nothing like love</i>

1174
01:17:39,729 --> 01:17:41,799
Were you there all the time?

1175
01:19:35,529 --> 01:19:39,317
<i>Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing</i>

1176
01:19:40,169 --> 01:19:43,206
<i>No, theres nothing</i>

1177
01:19:43,849 --> 01:19:47,205
<i>Like love</i>

1178
01:19:56,649 --> 01:19:58,560
Whats going on out here?

1179
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:02,007
- Hello, Wreck.
- This guy giving you any trouble?

1180
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:05,320
No. Everythings just fine.
Im sorry we woke you up.

1181
01:20:05,489 --> 01:20:08,640
Thats all right.
If you need me, you just whistle.

1182
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:10,078
I will.

1183
01:20:11,609 --> 01:20:12,883
Who is that?

1184
01:20:12,969 --> 01:20:16,006
Thats the Wreck. Mr. Loomis.
He lives upstairs.

1185
01:20:16,569 --> 01:20:17,797
Upstairs?

1186
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:21,680
Why is he sleeping down there?

1187
01:20:21,769 --> 01:20:24,966
You see, his girls mother just got in town...

1188
01:20:25,049 --> 01:20:27,438
- and so he cant stay with her.
- Who?

1189
01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:31,921
With either one.
You see, his girl works nights...

1190
01:20:32,009 --> 01:20:35,046
and her mother doesnt know
theyre sharing the same apartment...

1191
01:20:35,129 --> 01:20:37,882
so hes staying down here with us. You see?

1192
01:20:37,969 --> 01:20:40,437
No. Not exactly.

1193
01:20:42,449 --> 01:20:46,328
- Are you inferring theres something wrong?
- Im not inferring anything.

1194
01:20:46,569 --> 01:20:49,288
I just didnt think that you and your sister...

1195
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:53,922
- were quite that bohemian.
- Bohemian?

1196
01:20:57,129 --> 01:20:59,199
Why, Mr. Lippencott, llI have you know...

1197
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:01,928
that we come from
a very fine old Ohio family...

1198
01:21:02,009 --> 01:21:04,682
and youve got a lot of nerve
thinking what youre thinking.

1199
01:21:04,769 --> 01:21:06,919
And I think youd better leave.

1200
01:21:07,969 --> 01:21:11,041
- Look, I didnt mean...
- You heard what the lady said. Get moving.

1201
01:21:11,129 --> 01:21:13,279
- Now, just a minute, sir.
- Here.

1202
01:21:33,049 --> 01:21:35,165
- Ruth?
- Yes, dear.

1203
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:38,402
- I thought you were asleep.
- No.

1204
01:21:39,649 --> 01:21:41,367
Where have you been?

1205
01:21:42,609 --> 01:21:44,520
Whats the matter, honey?

1206
01:21:44,929 --> 01:21:47,363
- Whats wrong?
- Nothing.

1207
01:21:48,129 --> 01:21:49,801
Its just so silly.

1208
01:21:50,529 --> 01:21:52,759
You and Frank have an argument?

1209
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,645
I thought he was so sweet...

1210
01:21:57,289 --> 01:21:59,359
and kind and considerate.

1211
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,167
But hes not at all.

1212
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:06,079
He practically accused me
of being a loose woman.

1213
01:22:09,249 --> 01:22:11,524
My date just took it for granted.

1214
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:15,048
Your date?

1215
01:22:17,369 --> 01:22:19,166
Do you remember Mr. Baker?

1216
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:23,923
Sure. He was the fat, bald-headed man
you said you didnt like.

1217
01:22:25,089 --> 01:22:28,525
Thats not exactly
an accurate description of Mr. Baker.

1218
01:22:30,209 --> 01:22:31,961
As a matter of fact...

1219
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:33,962
hes beautiful.

1220
01:22:36,089 --> 01:22:40,082
<i>For the first time in my life I met a man I...
And I thought he...</i>

1221
01:22:41,609 --> 01:22:43,167
And I was wrong.

1222
01:22:43,649 --> 01:22:47,358
Honey, you didnt tell me. What happened?

1223
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:50,844
He wants to buy one of my stories.

1224
01:22:51,089 --> 01:22:52,568
On conditions.

1225
01:22:55,569 --> 01:22:57,446
That mustve been awful.

1226
01:22:58,129 --> 01:23:00,245
It wasnt entirely his fault.

1227
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:04,438
Your smart big sister
has been acting like the village idiot.

1228
01:23:06,089 --> 01:23:08,125
Oh, well.
It doesnt make any difference now.

1229
01:23:08,209 --> 01:23:11,121
Tomorrow well be on our way
back to Columbus.

1230
01:23:11,849 --> 01:23:15,364
- After tonight, I just dont care.
- Neither do I.

1231
01:23:16,289 --> 01:23:18,519
Any way you look at it, honey...

1232
01:23:19,089 --> 01:23:20,920
we just didnt make it.

1233
01:23:39,529 --> 01:23:41,087
Im sorry, honey.

1234
01:23:42,249 --> 01:23:44,399
Thats all right, Helen, baby.

1235
01:23:45,409 --> 01:23:47,604
- She up there?
- Yeah.

1236
01:23:48,769 --> 01:23:50,964
Im taking her to Grants Tomb.

1237
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:53,719
Why dont you leave her there?

1238
01:24:02,609 --> 01:24:04,167
- Hi.
- Hi.

1239
01:24:04,249 --> 01:24:06,524
- Need any help?
- Not now, thanks.

1240
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:09,726
When we finish packing, maybe you could
give us a hand with the bags.

1241
01:24:09,809 --> 01:24:12,039
- Sure, you just whistle.
- Thanks.

1242
01:24:13,289 --> 01:24:17,077
Its not going to be the same around here
without you two girls.

1243
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:24,001
I wonder what people back in Columbus
are going to say?

1244
01:24:24,089 --> 01:24:25,920
If were lucky, theyll say hello.

1245
01:24:26,009 --> 01:24:28,603
I wish I hadnt made that crack
at the country club.

1246
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,327
Which particular crack?

1247
01:24:30,409 --> 01:24:31,478
You know.

1248
01:24:31,569 --> 01:24:35,847
Ill never set foot in this town again
unless its on a personal appearance tour.

1249
01:24:37,129 --> 01:24:38,528
I keep thinking of Dad.

1250
01:24:38,609 --> 01:24:42,238
All those letters Ive written
saying how great we were doing.

1251
01:24:42,329 --> 01:24:46,242
Good morning, my dear young ladies.
Im here to take inventory.

1252
01:24:46,329 --> 01:24:47,523
Inventory?

1253
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:49,679
Naturally, theres always
a slight possibility...

1254
01:24:49,769 --> 01:24:51,725
some item of value
might have been damaged.

1255
01:24:51,809 --> 01:24:52,958
Item of value?

1256
01:24:53,049 --> 01:24:55,768
Listen, Papa, I could work this dungeon
over with a sledgehammer...

1257
01:24:55,849 --> 01:24:58,079
and it wouldnt look different
from the day we moved in.

1258
01:24:58,169 --> 01:25:02,128
You said you were going to give us back
our money if we werent satisfied. Were not.

1259
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:04,439
What are you talking about?
Who said such a thing?

1260
01:25:04,529 --> 01:25:07,521
I was one of the witnesses,
and I dont even remember.

1261
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:14,525
And remember, you have until 5:00.

1262
01:25:17,129 --> 01:25:21,680
I wish I could stay till Fathers Day.
Id like to bust Papa right in the nose.

1263
01:25:25,929 --> 01:25:28,568
Sherwood residence. Miss Ruth Sherwood?

1264
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:31,481
Whos calling, please?

1265
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:35,402
Yes, shes here.
Just a minute. Wait a second.

1266
01:25:35,489 --> 01:25:38,128
Its Chick Clarks newspaper.
Mr. Baines, the city editor.

1267
01:25:38,209 --> 01:25:39,528
He wants to talk to you.

1268
01:25:39,609 --> 01:25:41,327
- What does he want?
- I dont know.

1269
01:25:41,409 --> 01:25:44,446
But if its a job, take it.
Its what we came here for.

1270
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:46,524
Hello.

1271
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:49,644
Yes, this is she. Her. She.

1272
01:25:51,169 --> 01:25:52,238
What?

1273
01:25:52,809 --> 01:25:54,322
Yes, Mr. Baines.

1274
01:25:55,289 --> 01:25:56,802
Yes, Mr. Baines.

1275
01:25:57,289 --> 01:26:01,680
Thank you, Mr. Baines. Thats wonderful.
Yes, of course. A pencil, paper, quick.

1276
01:26:01,769 --> 01:26:02,758
What is he saying?

1277
01:26:02,849 --> 01:26:05,363
Get it, over there. Just a minute,
llI be right with you.

1278
01:26:06,969 --> 01:26:09,927
Im all ready. I got it. What is that now?

1279
01:26:10,329 --> 01:26:13,844
Pier 63, Sands Street, Brooklyn.

1280
01:26:14,489 --> 01:26:17,367
Sure. I understand. Ill be there. All right.

1281
01:26:18,169 --> 01:26:19,807
I cant believe it.

1282
01:26:20,249 --> 01:26:22,444
- I cant believe it!
- What did he say?

1283
01:26:22,529 --> 01:26:24,645
Hes gonna give me a chance
to show what I can do.

1284
01:26:24,729 --> 01:26:27,960
- An assignment over in Brooklyn.
- Brooklyn? What happened there?

1285
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:30,847
Theres a Brazilian training ship,
you know, like Annapolis.

1286
01:26:30,929 --> 01:26:33,682
And Im supposed to go
and get a human interest story.

1287
01:26:33,769 --> 01:26:36,761
How wonderful.
You see, Chick was some good after all.

1288
01:26:36,849 --> 01:26:39,568
Yes, I guess I owe Mr. Clark an apology.

1289
01:26:39,649 --> 01:26:41,719
I thought he was just trying
to get around you.

1290
01:26:41,809 --> 01:26:43,401
And I still think so.

1291
01:26:43,569 --> 01:26:45,639
Do you know how to get there
on the subway and everything?

1292
01:26:45,729 --> 01:26:47,765
<i>- Yeah, I can handle...
- Whats the matter?</i>

1293
01:26:47,849 --> 01:26:51,444
The address.
Pier 63, Sands Street, Brooklyn.

1294
01:26:51,889 --> 01:26:55,245
- Here. Goodbye, honey.
- Goodbye. Good luck.

1295
01:26:57,889 --> 01:26:58,958
Wreck!

1296
01:27:02,089 --> 01:27:04,922
Hold everything, Papa.
We may not be leaving.

1297
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:27,362
Isnt it wonderful, Wreck?
Maybe we wont have to go away at all.

1298
01:27:27,449 --> 01:27:29,326
Thats great. Ill keep my fingers crossed.

1299
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:31,286
Excuse me. Ill see you later.

1300
01:27:31,809 --> 01:27:33,208
Just a minute.

1301
01:27:36,969 --> 01:27:38,641
- Chick!
- Hi, baby.

1302
01:27:38,729 --> 01:27:41,323
Im so glad you came by.
I dont know how to thank you.

1303
01:27:41,409 --> 01:27:43,559
- I mean, about Mr. Baines and everything.
- Skip it.

1304
01:27:43,649 --> 01:27:46,004
Really. Its the most wonderful thing
that ever happened to us.

1305
01:27:46,089 --> 01:27:49,001
All right. How about getting some ice?
Well celebrate.

1306
01:27:49,089 --> 01:27:50,681
Ill get you some.

1307
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:53,283
If Ruth does get the job,
how much will they pay her?

1308
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:54,927
Theres no telling.

1309
01:27:55,009 --> 01:27:58,684
But lets forget about Ruth,
and get your career straightened out.

1310
01:27:58,769 --> 01:28:02,159
- Dont do that, Chick.
- Dont be nervous, baby. Relax.

1311
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:05,282
Mr. Appopolous might be
showing the apartment.

1312
01:28:05,369 --> 01:28:08,964
So, we wont open the door. I went
through a lot of trouble to get you alone...

1313
01:28:09,049 --> 01:28:11,483
without that eagle-eyed sister
of yours around.

1314
01:28:11,569 --> 01:28:13,002
Now, wait a minute.

1315
01:28:13,089 --> 01:28:15,922
That phone call Ruth got
was from the editor, wasnt it?

1316
01:28:16,009 --> 01:28:18,523
What are you worrying about?
Lm handling it.

1317
01:28:18,609 --> 01:28:21,442
It wasnt the editor. It was you.

1318
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:24,199
Look, its gonna work out the same way.

1319
01:28:24,289 --> 01:28:28,202
Im gonna hand the story in to the city desk
as a sample of what she can do.

1320
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:32,202
You mean you sent Ruth
over to Brooklyn on a wild-goose chase?

1321
01:28:32,289 --> 01:28:35,042
Wild-goose nothing.
Im letting her cover my assignment.

1322
01:28:35,129 --> 01:28:36,960
Now, what kind of a heel do you think I am?

1323
01:28:37,049 --> 01:28:40,519
What am I going to say to Ruth?
She was so excited.

1324
01:28:40,689 --> 01:28:43,601
Now, dont get tragic.
Its gonna be good experience for her.

1325
01:28:43,689 --> 01:28:47,443
- Please, Chick, leave.
- Now, look, Eileen. Put yourself in my place.

1326
01:28:47,529 --> 01:28:49,645
Dont do that, Chick.
Whats the matter with you?

1327
01:28:49,729 --> 01:28:50,764
Have you lost your mind?

1328
01:28:50,849 --> 01:28:54,762
Wreck! Help! Where are you?

1329
01:28:56,009 --> 01:28:57,886
- Whats the problem?
- Him.

1330
01:28:59,529 --> 01:29:01,520
Now, wait a minute, friend.

1331
01:29:02,009 --> 01:29:03,965
I dont want any trouble.

1332
01:29:05,249 --> 01:29:06,238
You win.

1333
01:29:12,449 --> 01:29:13,677
I look forward to the day...

1334
01:29:13,769 --> 01:29:16,681
when the Bronx Express
runs right through this room.

1335
01:29:21,049 --> 01:29:23,517
Its okay. That guy wont give you
any more trouble.

1336
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:26,919
I dont care about him.
Its Ruth that Im upset about.

1337
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:30,401
There, there, baby.
You just tell old Wreck all about it.

1338
01:29:30,489 --> 01:29:32,081
You see, he called Ruth...

1339
01:29:32,169 --> 01:29:35,081
and Ruth thinks shes got a job.
I dont know how Im gonna tell...

1340
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:37,285
What are you looking at, you old bat?

1341
01:29:37,369 --> 01:29:39,837
- Wreck!
- Oh, no!

1342
01:29:39,929 --> 01:29:42,204
<i>Wreck, I hope she didnt think...</i>

1343
01:29:42,289 --> 01:29:44,166
Hold on, Helen, baby, let me explain.

1344
01:29:44,249 --> 01:29:46,558
Helen, whats the meaning of this?
Do you know that man?

1345
01:29:46,649 --> 01:29:50,119
Listen. Helen, baby, wait a minute, will you?

1346
01:29:50,289 --> 01:29:52,245
Look, honey, Im bleeding.

1347
01:30:27,649 --> 01:30:30,209
Look, Im supposed to interview you...

1348
01:30:30,689 --> 01:30:32,042
for my newspaper.

1349
01:30:34,809 --> 01:30:36,128
Steady now.

1350
01:30:37,289 --> 01:30:39,564
Wait a minute. Will you let me out of here?

1351
01:30:39,649 --> 01:30:40,798
At ease.

1352
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:43,002
Come on now.

1353
01:30:52,369 --> 01:30:53,848
Now he fixes it.

1354
01:30:58,449 --> 01:31:00,087
- Hello.
- Good morning, Ruth.

1355
01:31:00,169 --> 01:31:02,399
Take it easy
and let me do the talking for a minute.

1356
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:03,842
Ive got good news for you.

1357
01:31:03,929 --> 01:31:06,124
<i>- Who is this?
- Who is... Its Bob.</i>

1358
01:31:07,249 --> 01:31:10,605
Ive got some news for you,
Mr. Robert Baker.

1359
01:31:10,689 --> 01:31:12,645
Its men like you that give men a bad name...

1360
01:31:12,729 --> 01:31:15,084
and youre darn lucky
Ruth doesnt have a big brother...

1361
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:16,204
instead of a sister.

1362
01:31:42,889 --> 01:31:44,527
Whats going on?

1363
01:31:49,769 --> 01:31:52,363
Dont encourage them.
Whats the Portuguese word for scram?

1364
01:31:52,449 --> 01:31:54,440
- You mean they dont speak English?
- Not a word.

1365
01:31:54,529 --> 01:31:57,487
- Oh, no. What do they want?
- What do you think they want?

1366
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:03,442
- What cooks here?
- They chased me all the way from Brooklyn.

1367
01:32:03,529 --> 01:32:06,407
- Most of them got lost in the subway.
- Ill fix it.

1368
01:32:07,049 --> 01:32:09,005
Gentlemen, Im Appopolous.

1369
01:32:09,289 --> 01:32:10,608
Appopolous.

1370
01:32:11,249 --> 01:32:14,844
Im the owner of this building.
I must command you to leave.

1371
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:24,204
- What are they tossing for?
- I got a hunch its not me.

1372
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,041
Come on, fellows, break it up.

1373
01:32:26,129 --> 01:32:28,120
- Go away.
- Go away. Out.

1374
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:30,120
The door, you know, out.

1375
01:32:32,009 --> 01:32:35,479
- I dont understand. I dont want to dance.
- My sister doesnt rumba.

1376
01:32:35,569 --> 01:32:38,288
She doesnt samba, either.
Come on, leave her alone.

1377
01:32:38,369 --> 01:32:41,122
Look, we dont rumba,
we dont even do the conga.

1378
01:33:07,689 --> 01:33:09,361
Ruth, do something.

1379
01:33:09,449 --> 01:33:11,121
Stop! Open the door.

1380
01:33:14,409 --> 01:33:15,398
Miss Sherwood.

1381
01:33:48,449 --> 01:33:50,405
All right, more conga.

1382
01:34:56,769 --> 01:34:57,804
Ruth?

1383
01:35:08,009 --> 01:35:09,727
Is that you, Eileen?

1384
01:35:11,049 --> 01:35:12,243
Eileen?

1385
01:35:21,089 --> 01:35:22,158
Ruth?

1386
01:35:25,129 --> 01:35:26,198
<i>Allo!</i>

1387
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:29,358
Papa.

1388
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:53,240
Come on, lets join the party.

1389
01:35:53,889 --> 01:35:55,004
Conga!

1390
01:36:15,529 --> 01:36:18,441
If youll just listen to me.
Im sure Eileen can explain the whole thing.

1391
01:36:18,529 --> 01:36:20,326
All right, but it better be good.

1392
01:36:23,169 --> 01:36:24,727
Let me in there.

1393
01:36:32,889 --> 01:36:35,244
Ive never been so mortified in all my life.

1394
01:36:35,329 --> 01:36:38,639
Imagine me,
chairman of the Womens League, a jailbird.

1395
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:42,445
My only daughter mixed up
with a muscle-bound sex-fiend.

1396
01:36:42,529 --> 01:36:44,440
Yeah, Ma, but I love him.

1397
01:36:44,729 --> 01:36:48,802
I can see the headlines now:
Sherwood sisters incite riot.

1398
01:36:49,329 --> 01:36:52,048
Create international incident with Brazil.

1399
01:36:53,049 --> 01:36:55,847
Franks really gonna think
Im bohemian now.

1400
01:36:56,329 --> 01:36:57,887
Not that I care.

1401
01:36:59,129 --> 01:37:01,165
You dont care like I dont care.

1402
01:37:03,769 --> 01:37:05,839
- Charlie, have a heart.
- Im sorry, Wreck...

1403
01:37:05,929 --> 01:37:08,489
but Ive got orders
from the State Department in Washington...

1404
01:37:08,569 --> 01:37:11,367
to hold everyone
until the matter is investigated.

1405
01:37:11,449 --> 01:37:12,677
Charlie, wow.

1406
01:37:13,529 --> 01:37:16,487
- Cant I just see Helen?
- Look, Wreck, dont push your luck.

1407
01:37:16,569 --> 01:37:19,163
I might forget I like you
and toss you in with the rest of them.

1408
01:37:19,249 --> 01:37:23,242
<i>Sergeant, Im Senhor Araújo.
Consul General of Brazil.</i>

1409
01:37:23,329 --> 01:37:24,398
Yes, sir.

1410
01:37:24,489 --> 01:37:26,559
I have an order here
from the State Department...

1411
01:37:26,649 --> 01:37:28,287
for the release of the naval cadets...

1412
01:37:28,369 --> 01:37:31,566
and all of the unfortunate people
involved in the incident.

1413
01:37:31,649 --> 01:37:32,684
Yes, sir.

1414
01:37:32,769 --> 01:37:34,964
Does that mean theyre gonna let Helen go?

1415
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:36,846
- Thats right.
- Wait a minute.

1416
01:37:36,929 --> 01:37:39,284
Look, Helens old ladys locked up, too.

1417
01:37:39,369 --> 01:37:41,929
I was wondering if youd do me
one little favour.

1418
01:37:42,009 --> 01:37:44,477
So now he knows that theres a you...

1419
01:37:45,329 --> 01:37:46,887
and Im just me.

1420
01:37:49,209 --> 01:37:51,564
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1421
01:37:52,489 --> 01:37:55,447
If I were any more ashamed,
Id commit hara-kiri.

1422
01:37:55,529 --> 01:37:59,204
No, I mean,
for having so little confidence in yourself.

1423
01:38:00,729 --> 01:38:02,606
I dont know why you want to be me.

1424
01:38:02,689 --> 01:38:05,601
Gosh, all my life
Ive wished I could be just like you.

1425
01:38:07,529 --> 01:38:09,565
Besides, how many girls
are attractive enough...

1426
01:38:09,649 --> 01:38:12,402
to have the whole Brazilian Navy
chase them?

1427
01:38:15,849 --> 01:38:17,043
Come on.

1428
01:38:17,889 --> 01:38:20,687
- You mean, were free?
- Thats it. Lets go.

1429
01:38:21,809 --> 01:38:24,403
I was beginning to feel like I belonged here.

1430
01:38:25,169 --> 01:38:27,478
- Which one of you is Helen?
- I am.

1431
01:38:27,609 --> 01:38:29,247
Come on. Youve been bailed out.

1432
01:38:29,329 --> 01:38:31,524
- What about me?
- What about you?

1433
01:38:34,369 --> 01:38:36,041
Gee, Ma, Im sorry.

1434
01:38:38,089 --> 01:38:40,649
- Can we go now?
- Sure. Anytime.

1435
01:38:40,889 --> 01:38:43,198
Youll hear from us very soon.

1436
01:38:43,289 --> 01:38:46,042
Yeah, itll have to be. Thank you. Goodbye.

1437
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:49,599
Now, where are our naughty boys?

1438
01:38:52,369 --> 01:38:56,328
Weve got to figure out some way
of getting these bags to the station.

1439
01:38:56,409 --> 01:38:59,128
We sure havent got enough money
for a cab.

1440
01:39:00,009 --> 01:39:02,762
Do you think
we shouldve let Dad know we were coming?

1441
01:39:02,849 --> 01:39:06,239
No. Well just burst in the door and yell,
Surprise!

1442
01:39:07,929 --> 01:39:09,078
Come in.

1443
01:39:09,169 --> 01:39:12,127
Good afternoon there, lovely ladies.
My name is Robert Baker...

1444
01:39:12,209 --> 01:39:15,724
and I represent the Society for the
Rehabilitation of Habitual Criminals.

1445
01:39:15,809 --> 01:39:18,926
First off, Id like to know
which one of you is Miss Ruth Sherwood.

1446
01:39:19,009 --> 01:39:20,965
Dont tell me. Thats you.

1447
01:39:22,689 --> 01:39:24,964
You must be her sister Eileen.
Id know you anywhere...

1448
01:39:25,049 --> 01:39:26,243
and Ive been dying to meet you...

1449
01:39:26,329 --> 01:39:30,242
because I must ask you about a flyer
who came all the way from Nome, Alaska...

1450
01:39:30,329 --> 01:39:32,160
just to bring you a birthday present?

1451
01:39:32,249 --> 01:39:34,285
<i>Tell me, did that really...</i>

1452
01:39:35,529 --> 01:39:37,167
Now look what youve done.

1453
01:39:37,249 --> 01:39:40,639
- You go right out there and apologise.
- Ill do a lot more than that.

1454
01:39:40,729 --> 01:39:43,368
In the meantime,
why dont you start unpacking?

1455
01:39:49,249 --> 01:39:52,719
- Ruth.
- Okay, say it. Ive got it coming.

1456
01:39:54,809 --> 01:39:58,563
- Your sisters very attractive.
- Shes beautiful, isnt she?

1457
01:39:58,649 --> 01:40:02,119
- Yes, shes lovely.
- Shes got a wonderful personality.

1458
01:40:02,209 --> 01:40:04,677
- Yeah. Shes got a great figure.
- Yes.

1459
01:40:05,369 --> 01:40:09,203
I was thinking maybe we ought
to run her picture along with the story.

1460
01:40:10,009 --> 01:40:12,000
Thats one of the things I wanted to tell you.

1461
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:16,446
Your storys going to be in next months
issue, that is, if you agree to my terms.

1462
01:40:16,529 --> 01:40:18,520
Thats very nice, thank you.

1463
01:40:18,729 --> 01:40:21,163
<i>Theres something else
I want to tell you and I cant...</i>

1464
01:40:21,249 --> 01:40:23,080
I remember what it was.

1465
01:40:29,809 --> 01:40:32,448
- What was that for?
- I think youre funny.

1466
01:40:33,809 --> 01:40:36,801
I think youre wonderful. Really.

1467
01:40:37,969 --> 01:40:39,880
I think youre beautiful.

1468
01:40:53,649 --> 01:40:54,798
Eileen?

1469
01:40:56,409 --> 01:41:00,243
I brought you a box
of chocolate-covered cherries.

1470
01:41:02,369 --> 01:41:03,882
Theyre a special.

1471
01:41:04,889 --> 01:41:06,117
Miss Sherwoods.

1472
01:41:06,209 --> 01:41:08,404
Miss Sherwood, come quickly.
Very important.

1473
01:41:08,489 --> 01:41:10,400
Come out quickly. Its very important.

1474
01:41:10,489 --> 01:41:13,481
Come on, come out quickly.
Very important. Come, Ruth!

1475
01:41:18,129 --> 01:41:21,201
- Make room, please.
- Whats the matter? Whats going on?

1476
01:41:26,169 --> 01:41:27,238
<i>Senhoritas.</i>

1477
01:41:27,329 --> 01:41:28,364
- Hello.
- How are you?

1478
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:30,679
My government wishes
to take this opportunity...

1479
01:41:30,769 --> 01:41:32,999
to right a most disastrous wrong.

1480
01:41:33,089 --> 01:41:34,283
Isnt that sweet?

1481
01:41:34,369 --> 01:41:36,564
Because of your generosity
and understanding...

1482
01:41:36,649 --> 01:41:38,480
I have the honour to present to you...

1483
01:41:38,569 --> 01:41:42,198
the ribbon of the Order
of Brazilian Mariners, second class.

1484
01:41:42,289 --> 01:41:45,838
- Why, thank you. Thank you very much.
- Youre welcome.

1485
01:41:46,009 --> 01:41:49,081
I wonder what you have to go through
to get first class?

1486
01:41:50,009 --> 01:41:51,328
Thank you.

1487
01:41:54,409 --> 01:41:56,400
They wish for you to make a speech.

1488
01:41:56,489 --> 01:41:59,162
Not me. Ruths the speechmaker.

1489
01:41:59,529 --> 01:42:01,008
Go ahead, Ruth.

1490
01:42:01,369 --> 01:42:03,678
- Well, I...
- Miss Sherwood, up here.

1491
01:42:06,969 --> 01:42:10,325
<i>On behalf of my sister Eileen and me...
I... Me...</i>

1492
01:42:11,289 --> 01:42:14,520
Id like to thank you
and your wonderful country...

1493
01:42:14,609 --> 01:42:16,327
for this great honour.

1494
01:42:16,409 --> 01:42:18,843
Actually, we didnt do anything
to deserve this.

1495
01:42:18,929 --> 01:42:21,682
All I did was
say something about the conga.
