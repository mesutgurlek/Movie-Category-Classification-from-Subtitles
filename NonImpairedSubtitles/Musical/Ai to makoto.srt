00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:39,681
<i>I was a senior in high school.</i>

56
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:55,493
- Violence solves nothing.
- Out of my way.

If you must fight, hit me then do it.
Over my dead body...

58
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:05,026
A pretentious bourgeois like
you disgusts me.

59
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,019
Now, scram.

60
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,349
You're dead wrong if you
think I'll give in...

61
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:16,635
'cause you're kinda cute.
You're fooling yourself, girl!

62
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:20,469
It's you...

63
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:25,131
Yes, you.

64
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:33,760
I won't...

65
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,790
I won't give in.

66
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:42,461
Fighting is...

67
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:49,473
- The cops!
- Riot police!

68
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:54,326
- Run! - Hurry!
- Run for it!

69
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:58,028
Dammit!

70
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:04,221
- Don't! Running solves nothing.
- What gives!

71
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:08,844
- Let go, you stupid bitch!
- Mend your ways! Do it for me!

72
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,025
Bullshit! What is with you?

73
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:24,410
Miss, are you okay?

74
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,979
You'll regret this!

75
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:32,739
I'm fine.
Everyone, don't hurt him.

76
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:38,127
Are you the daughter of
the Saotome family?

77
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:42,874
Guilty; I cannot lie.

78
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:46,827
Pay me no mind.

79
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:52,424
I may be bourgeois,
but I don't expect special treatment.

80
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:55,509
Take him away.

81
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:01,830
What will become of him?

82
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:07,896
That hardened bad boy will be
sent to reform school.

83
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,333
He can't!

84
00:09:57,603 --> 00:10:01,088
Taiga Makoto...
You've been released.

85
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,232
Huh? Why?

86
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:11,345
You're going to the prestigious
Aobadai Prep School.

87
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,655
But why?

88
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,473
A request from Mr Saotome,
their PTA chairman.

89
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,439
Saotome?

90
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:23,625
- The well-to-do Saotome family?
- Exactly.

91
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,111
I, myself, am wondering why.

92
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,785
This is how it's meant to be.

93
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:40,398
<i>Residing in Den-en-chofu,
Ota-ku, Tokyo.</i>

<i>Saotome Ai.</i>

00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:03,161
<i>I don't mean to brag,
but I'm great at sports.</i>

97
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,817
<i>As for my grades...</i>

98
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:08,628
<i>Sorry, I'm top of my class.</i>

99
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:17,287
So from today,
welcome a new peer to our class.

100
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:27,371
Taiga-kun. Take off your hat and remove
your hands from your pockets.

101
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:31,465
What's with the rebellious look?

102
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:36,624
You picking a fight?
I was an Olympic wrestler, you know.

103
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,741
Take off your hat!

104
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:46,737
What a scar!

105
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,049
Just like Moonlight Mask.

106
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:51,037
<i>Moonlight Mask = Gekko Kamen, a Japanese superhero character
who wears a turban with a moon-shaped ornament pinned to it</i>

107
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,152
You look like Moonlight Mask.

108
00:11:57,187 --> 00:12:00,802
Why aren't you riding your motorcycle?

109
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:03,677
Don't call me Moonlight Mask!

110
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:32,810
<i>Stick out your hands.</i>

111
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:34,586
Do it!

112
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:46,615
You told me to; it's your fault.

113
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:54,680
Right! You're my witnesses, right?

114
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,655
We're "peers", right?

115
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:00,675
Evil bastard!

116
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,856
What's a barbarian like him
doing at our elite school?

117
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:08,058
You, four-eyes!

118
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:11,397
What's with the rebellious look?

119
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:16,660
Got a problem, book worm?

120
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,511
What's all the racket?

121
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:23,420
- How horrible!
- Saotome, don't come near.

122
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:26,876
Here's that deluded
bourgeois girl again.

123
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:31,093
Don't take that tone with Saotome.

124
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,537
I don't care what you call me...

125
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:38,643
but I won't let you insult her!

126
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:43,048
What gives, coke-bottle eyes?

127
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,290
You got the hots for this chick?

128
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:48,775
Iwashimizu.

129
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,715
I...

130
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:54,098
I...

131
00:13:54,133 --> 00:14:00,234
<i>It's been exactly six months since...</i>

132
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:04,145
<i>Iwashimizu sent a shivering love letter.</i>

133
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:11,708
<i>I know you met your first love,
your knight in shining armour, at an early age.</i>

134
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:14,814
<i>So please don't get me wrong.</i>

135
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:18,581
I'm not asking anything from you.

136
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:23,423
So... we don't have to go steady?

137
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:28,893
No, I'm not saying that
we don't have to date.

138
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:30,950
You do wanna go steady?

139
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:35,833
No, I'm not aggressively asking that.

140
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:37,989
You're not, are you?

141
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:44,147
- So you're not...
- Yes, I am!

142
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,699
Honestly, I'm asking for you.

143
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,527
Asking for me?!

144
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,028
What are you asking for?

145
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:58,656
- Nothing indecent.
- You'd better not be.

146
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:01,787
We're still in high school,
you know.

147
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:05,083
Of course; I've never had
unclean thoughts.

148
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:09,283
Indecent thoughts are unthinkable.
I've never had them!

149
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:11,971
So what should I do?

150
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:16,175
Be your lovely self.

151
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,904
And as your lovely self...

152
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:23,547
I will live for that.

153
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:29,219
I, Iwashimizu Hiroshi...

154
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,927
will die for you.

155
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:37,571
<i>I love you</i>

156
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,030

157
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,507
<i>I love you</i>

158
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:52,505

161
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:13,042
<i>As long as the sun shines in the sky</i>

162
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:16,759
<i>You and I, you and I</i>

163
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:20,233
<i>We are one</i>

164
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:28,338
<i>I love you</i>

165
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:34,695
<i>As long as the sun shines in the sky</i>

166
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:54,461
<i>I love you</i>

167
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,812
<i>Your heart</i>

168
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,820
<i>I love you</i>

169
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:09,048
<i>Your eyes</i>

170
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:14,802
<i>I love you</i>

171
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:20,787
<i>to the end of time</i>

172
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:29,733
<i>As long as the sun shines in the sky</i>

173
00:17:29,768 --> 00:17:33,392
<i>You and I, you and I</i>

174
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,238
<i>As long as I live</i>

175
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:44,685
<i>I love you</i>

176
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,990
<i>As long as the sun shines in the sky</i>

177
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,879
Hey, four-eyes!

178
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:17,936
I'm talking to you.

179
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,289
Don't think you're cool,
you four-eyed book worm.

180
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:27,652
- Stop calling me that.
- What?

181
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:29,691
Stop calling me four-eyes.

182
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:33,543
My glasses...

183
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:36,626
are a part of my face.

184
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:38,334
That makes no sense.

185
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:43,706
I'm President of the Student Council...

186
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:46,462
I'm Iwashimizu Hiroshi.

187
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:51,121
I won't resort to violence.

188
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:56,054
But, if you demand a duel...

189
00:18:56,736 --> 00:19:01,169
- to protect peace at this school,
I accept. - Make up your mind.

190
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:05,738
Makoto, trying to solve everything
with violence isn't right.

191
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:08,633
Do you know him?

192
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,641
I more than know him...

193
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:18,126
I'm the one who asked my father to
let Makoto attend our school.

194
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,126
What's going on, Saotome-kun?

195
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:26,764
I want you to lead a proper life.

196
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,279
Enough bullshit, Missy.

197
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:32,128
It's the truth.

198
00:19:33,658 --> 00:19:38,108
The arrogance of the rich
makes me vomit.

199
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,380
This is...

200
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:43,457
my sincerity towards you.

201
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:46,454
Sincerity? Don't make me laugh.

202
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,506
Saotome-kun!

203
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't care if your father asked me...

204
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:56,055
- I can't overlook his horrible violence!
- Headmaster...

205
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,905
I have an obligation to rehabilitate him.

206
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,592
Obligation? What kind of obligation?

207
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:09,732
In the past, he instigated violence
many times in Nagano and got expelled.

208
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:12,479
There's a reason why he's like this.

209
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:15,773
Like you really know me!

210
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,861
Actually, Makoto...

211
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:22,548
has a good heart. A warm heart.

212
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:30,460
He's hopeless scum, who can't be helped.

213
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,689
Why go to the trouble?

214
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,460
Why?

215
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:39,159
Only one reason why she'd
help scum like me...

216
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:43,904
- What?
- This Missy...

217
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:47,204
is downright crazy about me.

218
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,764
Basically...

219
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:53,885
she loves me.

220
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:06,830
- Fools have such wild imaginations.
- Takes one to know one. - Enough nonsense...

221
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,056
Turn him over to the police.

222
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:11,816
Headmaster, please stop.

223
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,302
He speaks the truth.

224
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:22,761
What are you saying?

225
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,366
I...

226
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:37,096
I love Makoto.

227
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:59,110
<i>Since the day we pledged
to swear on our lives</i>

228
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:07,872
<i>such beautiful memories
have remained for me</i>

229
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:12,214
<i>Back then, when we saw
the same flower</i>

230
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:16,969
<i>our hearts both said
it was beautiful</i>

231
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:26,097
<i>But now our hearts no longer

232
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:31,607
<i>Bring back that loving feeling</i>

233
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:37,190
<i>one more time.</i>

234
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:42,696
<i>Bring back that loving feeling</i>

235
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:48,660
<i>one more time.</i>

236
00:22:55,107 --> 00:23:04,257
<i>The sky filled with the singing of</i>

237
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:12,839
<i>red dragon flies has not
changed at all</i>

238
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:17,445
<i>Back then, we always used to</i>

239
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,900
<i>chase the setting sun forever</i>

240
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:31,081
<i>But now our hearts no longer
reach out to each other</i>

241
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:36,214
<i>Bring back that loving feeling</i>

242
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:42,341
<i>one more time</i>

243
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:47,529
<i>Bring back that loving feeling</i>

00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:53,638
<i>one more time</i>

245
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:09,254
<i>Like standing alone in the
vast wilderness</i>

246
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:17,920
<i>without knowing why,
tears well up in my eyes</i>

247
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:22,514
<i>Back then, even when
the wind shifted</i>

248
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:27,192
<i>our hearts both said
we won't change</i>

249
00:24:27,227 --> 00:24:36,156
<i>But now our hearts no longer
reach out to each other</i>

250
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:41,063
<i>Bring back that loving feeling</i>

251
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,196
<i>one more time</i>

252
00:24:47,231 --> 00:24:52,214
<i>Bring back that loving feeling</i>

00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:59,229
<i>one more time</i>

254
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,171
<i>You moved me.
You and your resolution.</i>

255
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:21,496
<i>Makoto-san...</i>

256
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:26,173
you really are a kind person.

257
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:34,124
You know it. And if I'm going to lead
a proper life, I need something.

258
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,607
For you to rehabilitate yourself...

259
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:41,331
- I'll do anything.
- Really?

260
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,156
Give me money.

261
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:56,477
<i>Your apartment and school tuition...</i>

262
00:25:56,512 --> 00:26:01,363
<i>and necessary living expenses were
paid for by my family.</i>

263
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:02,821
Bon app?tit.

264
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:05,803
I put two eggs in.

265
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:08,763
Too extravagant?

266
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,316
This plain shirt will look good on you.

267
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:22,966
<i>Will you demand more money?</i>

268
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:28,941
If I work part time to pay for expenses,
I won't have time to study.

269
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:35,672
You want me to be proper,
right? Ai...

270
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:39,805
What do you do?

271
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,548
<i>How cold...</i>

272
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,603
Father, Mother, I'm home.

273
00:26:55,638 --> 00:27:00,527
Did that "problem child"
make a fresh start?

274
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:07,153
He won't change right away,
but in time...

275
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:10,883
Your father and his influence
moved political mountains.

276
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:17,357
Never forget his razzle-dazzle freed that
scum into your elite school.

277
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:19,909
That's a bit explanatory, Mother.

278
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:22,845
Let's celebrate like real bourgeois.

279
00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:25,086
Cheers!

280
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:27,847
But...

281
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:42,198
<i>The hydrangea flower,
like the palm of my tiny hand</i>

282
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:50,760
<i>Wiping off the tears,</i>

283
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:59,181
<i>we were both hurt</i>

284
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:08,525
<i>You showed me how to live for love</i>

285
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,947
<i>You were born</i>

286
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:19,121
<i>at the break of dawn</i>

287
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:35,071
<i>A train crossing blocking our way,
I know my way</i>

288
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:43,545
<i>But as it went go or stop,
I stood still that summer</i>

289
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:52,631
<i>It's not your first time</i>

290
00:28:52,666 --> 00:29:01,234
<i>Live for love, love to live</i>

291
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:05,815
<i>Live as you are,</i>

292
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:12,295
<i>how strong we are</i>

293
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:23,459
<i>Live for love, love to live</i>

294
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:27,585
<i>Be as you are,</i>

295
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:34,572
<i>how strong we are</i>

296
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:48,879
<i>You got that right, so right</i>

297
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:53,203
<i>So, so right</i>

298
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:58,062
<i>The days we spent</i>

299
00:29:58,392 --> 00:30:02,084
<i>For love, yes, for love</i>

300
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:05,936
<i>This world is mine</i>

301
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,117
<i>It's for love, yes, for love</i>

302
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:16,395
<i>Nothing can stop us,
I'm taking you along</i>

303
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,282
<i>To our future,
a beautiful rainbow</i>

304
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:25,604
<i>With you it's able,
the wonderful world of love</i>

305
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:29,605
<i>Still, I am fulfilled</i>

306
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:37,273
<i>And my expensive whiskey is</i>

307
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:41,001
<i>For love, yes, for love</i>

308
00:30:41,036 --> 00:30:44,571
<i>And our glamorous chandelier</i>

309
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:47,980
<i>For love, yes, for love</i>

310
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:55,248
<i>Heaven is where we're meant to be.
C'mon and ride with me</i>

311
00:30:55,283 --> 00:30:59,067
<i>Blessings from God,</i>

00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:20,303
<i>You got that right, so right</i>

315
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:24,275
<i>So, so right</i>

316
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:32,998
<i>Live for love!</i>

317
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:48,984
<i>I can't ask my parents

You're cute.

327
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,979
You smell nice.

328
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:24,274
This is a normal cafe, right?

329
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,011
What would you do...

330
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:29,467
if it wasn't?

331
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,384
So, it's...

332
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:38,646
It's?

333
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:41,052
It's...

334
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:42,728
It's?

335
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:46,726
- It's...
- Don't!

336
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:49,228
Saotome-kun.

337
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:53,594
Don't do it.

338
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:55,577
<i>Don't.</i>

339
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:57,736
<i>Don't do it.</i>

340
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:59,864
Welcome!

341
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:11,700
She's up for it.

342
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:16,146
She's down for it.

343
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:24,365
Here she comes.

344
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,164
How cute. You new?

345
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:29,203
Yes.

346
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:33,344
- Tell me your number.
- When do you get off?

347
00:34:39,222 --> 00:34:41,695
Bite the bullet.

348
00:34:43,218 --> 00:34:45,410
I can take it.

349
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:47,186
<i>Saotome-kun...</i>

350
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:51,038
Why... why go this far?

351
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:11,562
If I'm doing this for Makoto,
this shouldn't faze me.

352
00:35:13,231 --> 00:35:16,014
To make him change...

353
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:21,043
you have to taste the
same pain as his.

354
00:35:26,286 --> 00:35:28,608
Who you talking to?

355
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,892
Sorry.

356
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:36,464
I couldn't bear the customers'
indecent behaviour.

357
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,525
What! It's only talk.

358
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:32,229
- You in high school?
- Huh?

359
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:35,361
Beat it, kid.

360
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:39,467
- I'm a paying customer.
- Watch your mouth.

361
00:36:39,502 --> 00:36:42,064
Teach this kid some manners.

362
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,778
Get fucked, you yakuza wannabe!

363
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:49,563
- What the fuck, you asshole!
- You're the asshole.

364
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:06,019
Your goose is cooked!

365
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:11,341
I can't cover for your brush
with the police.

366
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:14,984
I never asked you to.

367
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:22,097
You disgust me!

368
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:26,811
Whilst you were partying...

369
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:29,595
Saotome was...
for you, she was...

370
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:36,450
- Come on, let's go.
- Now dance.

371
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:15,340
<i>See for yourself.</i>

372
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:19,044
She's lowered herself...

373
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:22,080
<i>for you.</i>

374
00:38:26,149 --> 00:38:28,432
Go, girl!

375
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:37,007
Please stop.

376
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:38,955
I can't.

377
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,627
<i>Aren't you going to help her?</i>

378
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:48,293
Taiga-kun!

379
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:12,581
You wised up yet?

380
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:18,472
I'm home.

381
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:22,017
Ai.

382
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:25,107
Sit down, child.

383
00:39:27,137 --> 00:39:30,587
What's with the scary face?

384
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:35,780
I don't remember raising you
to be such a delinquent.

385
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,939
What do you mean?

386
00:39:38,974 --> 00:39:42,276
You know damn well!

387
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:47,708
Today, Taiga Makoto paid
us a visit.

388
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:50,200
What? He did?

389
00:39:50,235 --> 00:39:52,038
<i>Why?</i>

390
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:56,645
Your daughter is working
part-time at a cafe.

391
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:59,616
That's nonsense.

392
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:02,212
How rude can you be?

393
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:10,754
What's this?

394
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:20,640
How'd these get here?

395
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:25,248
As he handed me those,
what do you think he said?

396
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:29,328
Pay me 1 million yen
to keep my mouth shut.

397
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:32,154
Pay you?

398
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:35,042
People will talk when they hear...

399
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:40,515
your daughter broke the school rules
and is working at a cafe.

400
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,837
- You're lying.
- It's no lie.

401
00:40:43,872 --> 00:40:46,503
That boy is... evil.

402
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:54,637
Call it hush money or severance pay.

403
00:40:55,813 --> 00:41:00,911
It was the straw that broke
the camel's back!

404
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,622
I had Taiga Makoto...

405
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:07,013
expelled from school!

406
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,019
Expelled? Where is he now?

407
00:41:10,054 --> 00:41:14,648
We sent him to be with his kind.

408
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:19,426
"His kind"?

409
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:25,021
But why?

410
00:41:46,314 --> 00:41:49,281
<i>HANAZONO TRADE SCHOOL</i>

411

use sunlight to convert CO2
into organic matter.

413

<i>This new kid's got some nerve.</i>

414
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:17,336
Tell him that...

415
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:22,146
paying his respects to me, Gumko,
is how Hanazono operates.

416
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:38,043
No baseball during class.

417
00:43:39,648 --> 00:43:41,578
"Gumko"?

418
00:43:47,402 --> 00:43:51,655
Did you just... laugh?

419
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:57,380
With a face like yours,
every day is Halloween!

420
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:03,276
Do you know who you're tangling with?

421
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,453
I got a thought...

422
00:44:10,488 --> 00:44:13,762
Maybe he doesn't know
because he's new?

423
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:20,434
For your info, she's called Gumko
'cause she chews gum.

424
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:24,853
You listening?!

425
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:30,122
You better wise up!

426
00:44:30,157 --> 00:44:35,429
- You loud-mouthed bitches!
- The new kid's done for!

427
00:44:36,196 --> 00:44:38,031
If you...

428
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:44,297
defy me, it means you're
defying our whole gang!

429

Your bark is worse than your bite.

430
00:44:57,465 --> 00:45:01,107
What do you think you're doing?!

431
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,827
Stop it!

432
00:45:05,862 --> 00:45:07,908
Stop messing around.

433
00:45:07,943 --> 00:45:09,980
I'll stab you!

434
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,985
Do it and she'll be road-kill.

Another troublemaker has transferred in.

439
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:39,520
Their gang leader will have
a field day with this.

440
00:45:41,644 --> 00:45:43,516
You okay?

441
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:48,177
Your leader?
You stupid or what?

442
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:53,210
I got no time for brain-dead
chicks like you.

443
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:03,245
If you resist...

444
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,522
you'll die.

445
00:46:06,506 --> 00:46:08,866
Bring it on, anytime.

446
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:11,883
What the fuck!

447
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:17,280
Shit!

448
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:20,649
We'll bash his brains in!

449
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:27,166
What a man...

450
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:03,571
You don't know when to quit.

451
00:47:04,715 --> 00:47:10,127
- There's a taboo word with
our leader. - What gives?

452
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:13,216
If you don't say it,
you might be allowed to pass.

00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:14,090
This is the boys' bathroom.

I don't follow.

493
00:52:39,671 --> 00:52:45,597
This old man's disease is frightening...

494
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:51,701
and the disease has spread fast.

495
00:52:54,187 --> 00:52:56,948
I think you might be wrong.

496
00:52:56,983 --> 00:52:59,724
Gonta, you haven't changed
since the 8th grade.

497
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,865
I'd say you're getting younger.

498
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,726
Your wig is the problem.

499
00:53:06,254 --> 00:53:08,929
You can tell it's a wig?

500
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:11,809
It's not your style.

501
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:19,306
I envy your youth.

502
00:53:20,925 --> 00:53:23,226
What's your business?

503
00:53:24,422 --> 00:53:26,261
It's Yuki.

504
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:30,333
What's happened to my Yuki?

505
00:54:02,482 --> 00:54:04,577
Iwashimizu-kun!

506
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:09,137
What are you doing on my property?

507
00:54:09,523 --> 00:54:15,949
Saotome Ai.
Wherefore art thou Ai?

508
00:54:15,984 --> 00:54:17,977
Never thought about it.

509
00:54:18,012 --> 00:54:21,031
Want to study for midterm exams?

510
00:54:26,447 --> 00:54:32,869
Since you go to Hanazono, you know
your way around Kabukicho, right?

511
00:54:32,904 --> 00:54:35,977
- The red-light district?
- Gimme the grand tour.

512
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:40,824
I don't know my way around. Sorry.

513
00:54:42,264 --> 00:54:48,048
What's a smart girl like you
doing at a school like that?

514
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:50,223
I'm not that smart.

515
00:54:50,258 --> 00:54:54,087
Why are you going to that
brain-dead school?

516
00:54:57,713 --> 00:55:01,526
You calling us brain-dead?

517
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:04,978
Yo, pretty boy.
A few words, will ya.

518
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:11,341
- Makoto-kun.
- Don't worry about me.

519
00:55:19,604 --> 00:55:22,461
<i>Glad you're back to...</i>

520
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:25,460
your normal self.

521
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:47,480
- Hello.
- Welcome.

522
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:52,410
I heard you were first in the class
for the pre-midterm exams.

523
00:55:52,445 --> 00:55:56,491
To defend my position at all costs,
I must study very hard.

524
00:55:56,526 --> 00:56:00,357
Ai, you'll have to try harder.

525
00:56:00,392 --> 00:56:04,463
But what's the point of trying harder?

526
00:56:05,847 --> 00:56:09,697
What's the point of trying harder?

527
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:13,245
So you can attend a good college.

528
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,978
But why attend a good college?

529
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:20,445
- Well...
- To open up possibilities.

530
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,322
Possibilities? What possibilities?

531
00:56:26,915 --> 00:56:29,716
Ones to make you even happier.

532
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,851
All this for little old me?

533
00:56:50,803 --> 00:56:55,194
We want to enjoy seeing
a punk like you scream.

534
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:03,628
Now we'll make him pay!

535
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:15,415
How do you define happiness?
What is it?

536
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:19,433
Well, it's...

537
00:58:22,268 --> 00:58:27,793
making someone you love happy.
That's the best happiness.

538
00:58:33,005 --> 00:58:35,295
I have to go out.

539
00:58:38,943 --> 00:58:43,309
I've got a bad feeling that
won't go away.

540
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,205
<i>Stop, Makoto-san!</i>

541
00:59:34,829 --> 00:59:36,951
Why're you here?

542
00:59:38,727 --> 00:59:42,419
- No more violence.
- Shut up.

543
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:49,618
I beg you!
Don't hurt anyone else!

544
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:51,889
Get off my back!

545
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,117
Look at yourself.
You're hurt, too.

546
00:59:56,152 --> 00:59:59,744
Don't you think you've done enough?

547
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:04,601
It's time I spelled it out...

548
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:09,561
your very existence is annoying.

549
01:00:11,502 --> 01:00:14,557
Never show your face again.

550
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:19,128
- I'll take your word for it.
- Four-eyes...

551
01:00:19,163 --> 01:00:22,283
never show your face, either.

552
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,237
My pleasure.

553
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:29,420
Let's go.
He'll only cause you trouble.

554
01:00:29,455 --> 01:00:32,332
I don't blame him for hating me.

555
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:36,944
I know why you can't be real.

556
01:00:36,979 --> 01:00:40,226
I know why you don't
want me around.

557
01:00:40,819 --> 01:00:45,146
But I'll keep living for you.

558
01:00:47,886 --> 01:00:51,926
That's my atonement to you.

559
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:56,104
Have it your way.

560
01:01:21,685 --> 01:01:24,611
<i>I never ever cry</i>

561
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:27,509
<i>There's no limit to my burning life</i>

562
01:01:27,544 --> 01:01:30,608
<i>Grasping on tightly to the sun</i>

563
01:01:30,643 --> 01:01:32,598
<i>I'm the storm that come again</i>

564
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:35,553
<i>Sing, Ken! Shout, Ken!</i>

565
01:01:35,588 --> 01:01:38,202
<i>Reach as far as the sun</i>

566
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:41,274
<i>Swim, Ken! Jump, Ken!</i>

567
01:01:41,309 --> 01:01:44,741
<i>Run, Wolf Boy Ken!</i>

568
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:01,333
<i>I'm always vigorously brave</i>

569
01:02:01,368 --> 01:02:04,181
<i>I'm strong; you can't break me.</i>

570
01:02:04,216 --> 01:02:07,012
<i>Never letting go of the planet</i>

571
01:02:07,047 --> 01:02:09,426
<i>I'm the storm that come again</i>

572
01:02:09,461 --> 01:02:12,149
<i>Sing, Ken! Shout, Ken!</i>

573
01:02:12,184 --> 01:02:15,102
<i>Reach as far as the sun</i>

574
01:02:15,137 --> 01:02:17,804
<i>Swim, Ken! Jump, Ken!</i>

575
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,714
<i>Run, Wolf Boy Ken!</i>

576
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,767
What gives, old man!

577
01:02:40,731 --> 01:02:44,723
How'd you know about my disease?

578
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:49,434
Makoto-san!

579
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:54,392
That's one scary dude.

580
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:00,904
Yuki babe!

581
01:03:09,729 --> 01:03:11,474
Yuki babe...

582
01:03:12,684 --> 01:03:14,712
Dammit!

583
01:03:17,858 --> 01:03:24,110
My Yuki's in a tiff 'cause of you.

584
01:03:28,612 --> 01:03:31,784
- No fighting!
- Let me go.

585
01:03:35,267 --> 01:03:36,957
Makoto-san!

586
01:03:39,372 --> 01:03:41,375
Don't!

587
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:44,994
Makoto-san!

588
01:03:47,428 --> 01:03:49,072
Don't...!

589
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:54,836
- Stop!
- Enough, you bitch!

590
01:04:25,453 --> 01:04:29,867
Thought you'd be more fun...

591
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:33,092
How lame.

592
01:05:07,811 --> 01:05:09,276
Where are you going?

593
01:05:09,311 --> 01:05:12,523
- Maybe to see Makoto?
- Wrong!

594
01:05:12,558 --> 01:05:17,230
I wasn't going to visit him
in the hospital.

595
01:05:17,265 --> 01:05:23,512
I don't even like him! I don't want to
miss my chance to beat him up!

596
01:05:28,766 --> 01:05:30,888
She's outta her mind.

597
01:05:49,256 --> 01:05:52,084
That should do it.

598
01:05:58,316 --> 01:06:01,653
Oops, I'd better get to class.

599
01:06:01,688 --> 01:06:04,769
Makoto-san, I'll see you tonight.

600
01:06:58,004 --> 01:07:02,250
Makoto-kun, you're awake?

601
01:07:09,246 --> 01:07:12,223
Do you remember yesterday?

602
01:07:14,105 --> 01:07:17,062
That dude was unreal.

603
01:07:18,814 --> 01:07:22,484
So he's the Hanazono High
gang leader?

604
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:27,062
I don't know about such things.

605
01:07:32,255 --> 01:07:33,707
What's wrong?

606
01:07:44,453 --> 01:07:47,542
<i>Don't! You need rest.</i>

607
01:07:47,577 --> 01:07:50,451
<i>I can't just sit here and do nothing.</i>

608
01:07:50,486 --> 01:07:54,091
<i>At least wait until this IV is done.</i>

609
01:08:34,016 --> 01:08:35,714
Hey, Masa!

610
01:08:36,506 --> 01:08:40,024
Where's Taiga's room?

611
01:08:40,059 --> 01:08:42,032
Get out here!

612
01:08:57,546 --> 01:09:00,263
You been messing with Yuki again?

613
01:09:00,298 --> 01:09:04,129
- So what if I was?
- You're dead meat!

614
01:09:54,461 --> 01:09:56,190
Makoto-kun...

615
01:09:57,282 --> 01:10:00,324
Where are you going like that?

616
01:10:05,207 --> 01:10:08,775
<i>It's that famous Monkey-Crab battle.</i>

617
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:13,574
<i>A monkey kills a crab...</i>

618
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:16,982
<i>but the crab spits out some
babies before dying.</i>

619
01:10:17,114 --> 01:10:19,573
The monkey is a bad guy...

620
01:10:19,608 --> 01:10:25,958
so the babies ask a chestnut, a bee,
a cow pie and a large mortar for help.

621
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:30,046
They call out the monkey
and beat him up.

622
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:33,232
Finally, the mortar crushes him.

623
01:10:33,714 --> 01:10:39,460
All's well that ends well.
The monkey is dead.

624
01:10:41,869 --> 01:10:49,434
But this folk story has a catch...

625
01:10:50,502 --> 01:10:55,390
One of them was behind it all.

626
01:10:57,124 --> 01:11:03,557
The true bad boy was...
the cow pie.

627
01:11:04,711 --> 01:11:06,745
The real villain.

628
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:11,431
Of all the characters,
what would you be?

629
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:20,065
What do you want to be?

630
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:23,063
The mortar.

631
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:29,736
You for real?

632
01:11:29,771 --> 01:11:31,822
The mortar?

633
01:11:32,424 --> 01:11:34,639
- Gonta-san!
- What?

634
01:11:34,674 --> 01:11:38,754
- I didn't say anything.
- I'm gonna kill Taiga Makoto!

635
01:11:50,126 --> 01:11:52,663
Tell me why!

636
01:11:52,698 --> 01:11:56,485
<i>Cow pie!</i>

637
01:12:01,849 --> 01:12:04,159
Something wrong, Saotome?

638
01:12:05,117 --> 01:12:10,351
I got a bad feeling.
Makoto's in danger.

639
01:12:10,386 --> 01:12:13,284
Why don't you wake up and
smell the green tea?

640
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:19,218
Something's wrong.
I can't live happily here.

641
01:12:20,098 --> 01:12:22,426
My happiness...

642
01:12:23,455 --> 01:12:26,293
rests with the person I love.

643
01:12:27,246 --> 01:12:30,678
What are you going to do?
Saotome!

644
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:39,844
I'm joining your class from today.

645
01:12:40,678 --> 01:12:42,710
I'm Saotome Ai.

646
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,552
Sit down there, please.

647
01:13:10,841 --> 01:13:12,704
Ai-chan.

648
01:13:15,622 --> 01:13:17,550
Saotome-kun.

649
01:13:18,865 --> 01:13:21,349
Why are you going this far?

650
01:13:21,384 --> 01:13:27,784
If you stay in that cesspool,
you'll be in danger.

651
01:13:41,235 --> 01:13:45,787
I'm joining your class from now.

652
01:13:46,858 --> 01:13:49,258
I'm Iwashimizu Hiroshi.

653
01:13:50,031 --> 01:13:52,716
Sit down there, please.

654
01:13:59,111 --> 01:14:01,455
Iwashimizu-kun!

655
01:14:04,094 --> 01:14:07,359
I can't let you be in danger.

656
01:14:08,285 --> 01:14:09,812
I...

657
01:14:11,305 --> 01:14:14,813
Iwashimizu Hiroshi,
will die for you...

658
01:14:15,739 --> 01:14:18,009
Shut up, dork!

659
01:14:18,044 --> 01:14:19,564
Pardon me.

660
01:14:19,599 --> 01:14:25,692
If you're from Aobadai High, you must
know Taiga Makoto, right?

661
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,066
No, not really...

662
01:14:28,701 --> 01:14:30,865
Actually, I do.

663
01:14:31,599 --> 01:14:33,720
Leave the kid alone.

664
01:14:33,755 --> 01:14:36,660
- What's wrong, Gumko?
- I said, leave him be.

665
01:14:37,356 --> 01:14:42,297
So you have feelings for Makoto?

666
01:14:42,332 --> 01:14:43,893
Stop joking!

667
01:14:45,153 --> 01:14:48,902
Do you like Makoto?

668
01:14:48,937 --> 01:14:52,512
- What?
- I'm friends with him...

669
01:14:52,547 --> 01:14:57,684
- Saotome-kun!
- More than friends. To me...

670
01:14:57,719 --> 01:14:59,929
he's special.

671
01:15:02,016 --> 01:15:05,357
What does Makoto think of you?

672
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:08,070
He...

673
01:15:09,396 --> 01:15:11,254
Makoto-san...

674
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:16,198
surely thinks Ifm his...

675
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:22,890
Makoto doesn't think anything of her.

676
01:15:22,925 --> 01:15:24,539
She's my...

677
01:15:25,765 --> 01:15:27,814
Hush up, four-eyes.

678
01:15:27,849 --> 01:15:31,255
- Yeah, can it, four-eyes.
- Stick to studying.

679
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:41,265
Make fun of my glasses and...

680
01:15:43,508 --> 01:15:45,797
they'll make you cry!

681
01:15:53,266 --> 01:15:55,091
In what context?

682
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,334
If you think about it,

683
01:16:03,369 --> 01:16:07,335
why did Makoto switch to this school?

684
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:09,830
There's a reason.

685
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,910
And why did he come to Tokyo?

686
01:16:15,507 --> 01:16:16,993
I...

687
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:23,568
don't understand that, either.

688
01:16:25,557 --> 01:16:30,160
What happened with you two before?

689
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,206
Could you tell me?

690
01:16:35,855 --> 01:16:40,335
It's my fault he's had an unhappy life.

691
01:16:53,904 --> 01:16:57,629
<i>It's true that I came to Tokyo
to get revenge...</i>

692
01:17:00,507 --> 01:17:06,668
To make the person
who messed up my life pay.

693
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,494
Pay how?

694
01:17:09,529 --> 01:17:11,726
The only way possible...

695
01:17:12,339 --> 01:17:14,503
With violence!

696
01:17:16,781 --> 01:17:21,087
And who messed up your life?

697
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:26,040
Stick with me and you'll find out.

698
01:17:27,108 --> 01:17:31,880
Why are you so open with me?

699
01:17:31,915 --> 01:17:39,001
Because... you seem like a sad chick.

700
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:50,147
I haven't heard that for a long while.

701
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:52,706
<i>SAD CHICK</i>

702
01:17:58,505 --> 01:18:01,357
I thought we were compatible.

703
01:18:03,116 --> 01:18:04,885
What's wrong?

704
01:18:10,277 --> 01:18:12,629
I'm feeling horny.

705
01:18:15,031 --> 01:18:16,633
Follow me.

706
01:18:31,459 --> 01:18:35,444
Hurry up and bang me silly.

707
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:50,761
You really are a sad chick.

708
01:18:51,938 --> 01:18:54,137
I need another drink.

709
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:08,809
Kill.

710
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:33,068
Gimme that.

711
01:19:40,852 --> 01:19:45,518
It's cheap liquor,
but I'll take it.

712
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:52,729
What's the matter?

713
01:20:06,309 --> 01:20:12,363
<i>When men have something
they want to forget</i>

714
01:20:14,092 --> 01:20:20,386
<i>When men feel helpless loneliness</i>

715
01:20:22,732 --> 01:20:28,770
<i>When men are surrounded by pain</i>

716
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:35,229
<i>They drink to forget</i>

717
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:44,031
<i>Drink to forget
Wash your troubles away</i>

718
01:20:44,066 --> 01:20:52,454
<i>Drink until you can't stand
Drink until you fall asleep</i>

719
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:58,638
<i>With time, you'll...</i>

720
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:06,096
<i>rest in peace</i>

721
01:21:08,774 --> 01:21:14,184
<i>When women have something
they want to forget</i>

722
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:21,779
<i>When women feel helpless loneliness</i>

723
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:30,664
<i>When women are surrounded
by sorrow</i>

724
01:21:31,986 --> 01:21:36,882
<i>They cry to forget</i>

725
01:21:38,287 --> 01:21:46,066
<i>Cry to forget
Wash your troubles away</i>

726
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:54,193
<i>Cry until you can't stand

01:21:54,687 --> 01:22:00,698
<i>With time, you'll...</i>

728
01:22:02,448 --> 01:22:08,259
<i>rest in peace</i>

729
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:19,371
A friend of yours?

730
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:25,369
She's a train wreck waiting to happen...

731
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:28,474
always in trouble with the law.

732
01:22:29,299 --> 01:22:33,749
When she's on a binge,
the neighbourhood's at risk.

733
01:22:44,499 --> 01:22:49,291
What? Don't you want
to drink with me?

734
01:22:49,326 --> 01:22:52,930
- Beats me.
- What beats you?

735
01:22:52,965 --> 01:22:56,949
- I'm the customer here!
- Who asked you?!

736
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,785
There she goes again.

737
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,049
Stay out of it.

738
01:23:05,537 --> 01:23:08,907
Nothing good will come out
of helping her.

739
01:23:18,615 --> 01:23:20,548
And don't come back!

740
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:22,553
I'll call the police!

741
01:23:22,588 --> 01:23:25,340
See if I care!
Call the damn police!

742
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:44,268
She's the one who messed
up your life?

743
01:23:45,803 --> 01:23:47,523
Who is she?

744
01:23:50,222 --> 01:23:52,779
The woman who ditched me.

745
01:24:11,565 --> 01:24:13,893
Everyone is accounted for.

746
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:46,285
Thanks for your trouble.

747
01:24:49,053 --> 01:24:51,685
We brought her for you.

748
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:01,798
Show your face!

749
01:25:13,587 --> 01:25:16,773
Says she's Makoto's girl.

750
01:25:20,409 --> 01:25:23,568
The one from before.

751
01:25:24,292 --> 01:25:26,244
No.

752
01:25:26,425 --> 01:25:29,515
I love him,
but you're wrong.

753
01:25:34,117 --> 01:25:39,731
You have a face that hasn't
seen an ounce of sadness.

754
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:58,294
Did Makoto do something forbidden
to our boss?

755
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:02,924
Use her as bait to get Taiga Makoto.

756
01:26:06,519 --> 01:26:07,866
Yes!

757
01:26:07,901 --> 01:26:11,129
And check into a bar maid...

758
01:26:11,164 --> 01:26:14,248
she might be our trump card.

759
01:26:14,283 --> 01:26:16,036
Yes!

760
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:19,787
Kinako, Satsuki, come with me.

761
01:26:27,986 --> 01:26:32,110
He's more spineless and mushy
than I thought.

762
01:26:39,087 --> 01:26:41,034
<i>Taiga-kun!</i>

763
01:26:46,907 --> 01:26:51,094
- The shit's hit the fan!
- Cool, out, brainiac.

764
01:26:51,129 --> 01:26:53,279
Saotome-kun has...

765
01:26:54,533 --> 01:26:57,578
She's got nothing to do with me.

766
01:26:57,613 --> 01:27:01,581
Yeah, she does.
She was abducted because of you.

767
01:27:02,557 --> 01:27:08,196
The group you proclaimed war against
took her hostage, to lure you out.

768
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:11,596
- Hold on.
- What?

769
01:27:12,072 --> 01:27:15,530
How'd the Hanazono girls catch Ai?

770
01:27:15,565 --> 01:27:20,978
Maybe because she transferred
to Hanazono to be with you.

771
01:27:22,241 --> 01:27:24,301
And me, too.

772
01:27:25,968 --> 01:27:31,306
- You two... are whackjobs.
- Pardon your French!

773
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:38,032
If you and Miss Deluded hadn't come,
this wouldn't have happened.

774
01:27:38,067 --> 01:27:42,691
- She wanted to help you.
- You're in a jam, not me.

775
01:27:42,726 --> 01:27:45,042
True, but...

776
01:27:45,077 --> 01:27:50,637
You said you'd die for her, right?

777
01:27:50,672 --> 01:27:54,523
- Of course!
- Then go save her.

778
01:27:56,334 --> 01:27:59,232
You'll win points with her.

779
01:28:01,072 --> 01:28:06,168
More importantly, it's unwanted.
Don't leech onto me.

780
01:28:06,956 --> 01:28:09,421
Watch your mouth!

781
01:28:10,363 --> 01:28:15,803
She risked her future by quitting school
to chase after you.

782
01:28:15,838 --> 01:28:19,094
That's what's unwanted!

783
01:28:19,129 --> 01:28:22,445
She wants to make amends.

784
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:26,831
Says she's the one
who ruined your life.

785
01:28:27,544 --> 01:28:34,022
So she gambled everything and
decided to live her life for you.

786
01:28:34,057 --> 01:28:39,960
Get real. I don't have the
slightest grudge against her.

787
01:28:39,995 --> 01:28:42,292
It's unwarranted.

788
01:28:42,327 --> 01:28:47,914
I hate to admit it...
but it sounds like...

789
01:28:48,786 --> 01:28:52,650
Love! Her sincere love for you.

790
01:28:52,685 --> 01:28:58,736
The same love I have for her.
But she selflessly loves you.

791
01:28:58,771 --> 01:29:00,757
You're out of your mind.

792
01:29:02,491 --> 01:29:07,760
That love is greater than what
a mother feels for her child.

793
01:29:08,657 --> 01:29:11,074
Please, don't leave.

794
01:29:12,465 --> 01:29:14,173
I beg you.

795
01:29:14,705 --> 01:29:18,620
Go save Saotome. Please!

796
01:29:24,394 --> 01:29:27,382
You go save her.

797
01:29:27,417 --> 01:29:29,870
I will die for her...

798
01:29:29,905 --> 01:29:35,264
- If I die, it's worth it.
- Then go. - But...

799
01:29:35,299 --> 01:29:39,543
even if I die trying,
it doesn't mean I will save her.

800
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:45,152
If I go and die,
it's mere self-indulgence.

801
01:29:46,675 --> 01:29:51,791
My wish is that she be saved.

802
01:29:53,653 --> 01:29:55,797
But I'm not the one...

803
01:29:57,418 --> 01:29:59,521
who can save her.

804
01:30:00,767 --> 01:30:02,619
But you can!

805
01:30:14,795 --> 01:30:17,245
If I go save her...

806
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,571
she'll love me even more.

807
01:30:21,546 --> 01:30:23,632
You cool with that?

808
01:30:26,262 --> 01:30:31,680
My wish is not for my happiness...

809
01:30:33,048 --> 01:30:35,871
it's for her happiness.

810
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:40,485
Go and save her.

811
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:43,657
Please!

812
01:30:53,834 --> 01:30:56,841
- Got good news.
- What?

813
01:30:56,876 --> 01:30:59,049
That bar maid...

814
01:30:59,084 --> 01:31:02,354
she's Makoto's mum.

815
01:31:03,266 --> 01:31:05,732
His mother?

816
01:31:08,594 --> 01:31:13,996
- We could use her.
- Shall I snatch her?

817
01:31:14,031 --> 01:31:17,048
- Go ahead.
- OK!

818
01:31:26,102 --> 01:31:27,942
I'd like a word.

819
01:31:31,809 --> 01:31:33,578
What?

820
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,560
I won't let anyone make fun of me.

821
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:43,468
I'll kill you.

822
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,420
You're not...

823
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:50,407
Are you surprised?

824
01:31:50,931 --> 01:31:54,830
I'm the one who runs the show
at Hanazono High.

825
01:31:56,536 --> 01:31:58,730
<i>Makoto-san!</i>

826
01:32:00,347 --> 01:32:03,787
Why did you come to save me?

827
01:32:06,861 --> 01:32:08,926
I didn't.

828
01:32:08,946 --> 01:32:13,660
- Don't worry about me.
- Shut your mouth! - Oh, no! Help me!

829
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:19,132
She's a royal pain in the ass!
What do you hope to gain?

830
01:32:21,801 --> 01:32:28,664
Anyone who makes fun of me...
has to pay the price.

831
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:34,840
You're sadder than before.

832
01:32:40,531 --> 01:32:47,441
My personal story...
Takahara Yuki, Hanazono High senior.

833
01:33:13,956 --> 01:33:19,071
<i>When I was born...
I had no father...</i>

834
01:33:21,779 --> 01:33:26,743
<i>Because my mother worked
at a soapland in Shinjuku.</i>

835
01:33:30,511 --> 01:33:32,409
<i>But I...</i>

836
01:33:34,268 --> 01:33:37,108
<i>was hardly a sad girl.</i>

837
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:45,060
<i>Mom only came home in the morning.</i>

838
01:33:45,095 --> 01:33:48,920
<i>I always ate meals alone.</i>

839
01:33:51,952 --> 01:33:53,348
Stop!

840
01:33:53,383 --> 01:33:58,225
<i>Mom often came home drunk.</i>

841
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:01,246
<i>She often beat me.</i>

842
01:34:02,922 --> 01:34:06,799
<i>But I learned to fight back...</i>

843
01:34:08,099 --> 01:34:11,226
<i>and we beat each other to a pulp.</i>

844
01:34:15,298 --> 01:34:21,244
<i>Mom started living with
a yakuza type.</i>

845
01:34:23,186 --> 01:34:27,993
<i>He often made sexual advances...</i>

846
01:34:28,028 --> 01:34:30,709
<i>so I stabbed him.</i>

847
01:34:46,775 --> 01:34:49,504
<i>The police took me away...</i>

848
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:54,714
<i>and I lived apart from my mother.</i>

849
01:34:57,959 --> 01:35:00,876
<i>The yakuza's boss...</i>

850
01:35:01,126 --> 01:35:06,974
<i>felt sorry for me and cared for me.</i>

851
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:10,368
<i>Then, he adopted me.</i>

852
01:35:12,317 --> 01:35:15,523
<i>I didn't want for money, but...</i>

853
01:35:16,073 --> 01:35:19,161
<i>all my friends got scared...</i>

854
01:35:19,196 --> 01:35:22,403
<i>and left me.</i>

855
01:35:23,609 --> 01:35:25,635
<i>I told myself...</i>

856
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:29,043
I'm not a sad girl!

857
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:40,084
- You think you're the saddest chick
in the world, eh? - Huh?

858
01:35:43,598 --> 01:35:47,892
I'll show no mercy just
'cause you're girls.

859
01:35:47,927 --> 01:35:53,108
- Makoto-san!
- Didn't you come to save her?

860
01:35:53,143 --> 01:35:55,133
Thanks, Makoto!

861
01:35:56,552 --> 01:36:01,953
You've done enough already.

862
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:05,900
About you being where I'm going...

863
01:36:05,935 --> 01:36:10,193
- You don't have to be bashful.
- I'm not.

864
01:36:10,429 --> 01:36:15,189
She's got the hots for you.

865
01:36:16,868 --> 01:36:20,402
You're a pain in the ass.

866
01:36:21,836 --> 01:36:25,099
Things would be easier without you.

867
01:36:36,452 --> 01:36:39,185
Don't cry on me.

868
01:36:42,352 --> 01:36:46,006
Oh, Makoto!
They're after your mother.

869
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:47,742
Hush up!

870
01:36:55,113 --> 01:36:59,425
Forget about me;
save your mother.

871
01:37:00,287 --> 01:37:05,028
She abandoned me.
Bust her up; see if I care.

872
01:37:06,174 --> 01:37:11,489
- I'm sure she had her reasons.
- Stop with the sob story.

873
01:37:11,524 --> 01:37:18,185
You don't know what they'll do to her.
Please go save her.

874
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:22,711
- We won't let him go.
- I won't go.

875
01:37:22,746 --> 01:37:27,227
- But if you must go...
- He'll go! - I'm not going.

876
01:37:33,814 --> 01:37:36,354
<i>SULFURIC ACID</i>

877
01:37:38,401 --> 01:37:41,950
"Concentrated sulfuric..."

878

If you must leave, go ahead.

879
01:37:46,797 --> 01:37:53,004
I'll burn her pretty face with acid.

880
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:56,350
I wasn't going from the start.

881
01:38:03,117 --> 01:38:05,519
All this for me?

882
01:38:05,554 --> 01:38:08,822
- I wasn't going to begin with.
- OK, then...

883
01:38:08,857 --> 01:38:12,462
If you don't want me to burn her...

884
01:38:13,288 --> 01:38:17,661
- then don't resist.
- You just wanna burn her, right?

885
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:22,219
Get him.

886
01:38:31,012 --> 01:38:32,634
Makoto-san!

887
01:38:32,938 --> 01:38:37,846
What's with you?
You'll let me burn her with acid?

888
01:38:37,881 --> 01:38:40,055
I don't give a shit.
Have it your way.

889
01:38:41,805 --> 01:38:43,880
How could you...

890
01:38:44,596 --> 01:38:47,478
Oh, maybe if she...

891
01:38:47,513 --> 01:38:52,948
if will undermine me as
a hostage and...

892
01:38:53,593 --> 01:38:56,867
I'll get released sooner.

893
01:38:56,902 --> 01:38:59,669
You are so self-centered.

894
01:38:59,704 --> 01:39:02,371
- So that's your plan?
- No, that ain't it.

895
01:39:02,406 --> 01:39:06,093
Shower me with acid anytime.

896
01:39:07,363 --> 01:39:11,309
Then go save your mother,
Makoto-san.

897
01:39:11,344 --> 01:39:15,405
Shut your trap!
You're messing things up!

898
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,681
I believe in you.

899
01:39:21,747 --> 01:39:28,177
You're not the kind of man
who'd let his mother die.

900
01:39:29,289 --> 01:39:31,676
Actually, you're...

901
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:36,477
a kind person.

902
01:39:37,747 --> 01:39:39,425

Give her what she wants.

Shit!

907
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:35,064
Get her.

Who are you?

My bodyguard, who worships
the ground I walk on.

01:43:18,736 --> 01:43:20,953
Not her bodyguard...

her love slave,
Zao Gonta, aged 17.

914

01:44:35,652 --> 01:44:37,740
Stop...

- You're my eternal hero.

<i>Whatever you're doing</i>

981
01:54:03,161 --> 01:54:07,394
<i>I don't want to know it</i>

982
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,459
<i>I don't want to hear it</i>

983
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:17,988
<i>We both have apprehensions</i>

984
01:54:18,023 --> 01:54:23,468
<i>And we'll go back to
the way we were</i>

985
01:54:23,503 --> 01:54:28,296
<i>Close the door together</i>

986
01:54:28,331 --> 01:54:33,362
<i>Erase our names together</i>

987
01:54:33,397 --> 01:54:43,096
<i>And then our hearts
will probably say something</i>

988
01:54:43,131 --> 01:54:48,112
<i>Close the door together</i>

989
01:54:48,147 --> 01:54:53,126
<i>Erase our names together</i>

990
01:54:53,161 --> 01:55:05,942
<i>And then our hearts
will probably say something</i>

991
01:55:49,011 --> 01:55:53,272
I'm better off dead.

992
01:56:06,505 --> 01:56:08,432
You wanna die?

993
01:56:08,467 --> 01:56:12,253
Don't stop me.
I got no reason to live.

994
01:56:12,571 --> 01:56:16,716
Leave me be!
Let me die!

995
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:21,526
I got no right to live.
Let me die!

996
01:56:24,163 --> 01:56:26,180
I won't stop you.

997
01:56:27,206 --> 01:56:29,860
I won't, so keep quiet.

998
01:56:29,895 --> 01:56:34,033
Let's go down together.
I want to check out, too.

999
01:56:34,068 --> 01:56:36,034
I'll die with you.

1000
01:56:36,069 --> 01:56:40,654
- You... crazy or something?
- Crazy?

1001
01:56:40,689 --> 01:56:46,329
My unhappy life made me this way.

1002
01:57:00,688 --> 01:57:04,837
Dad's going to be home soon.
Go to the bath house with him.

1003
01:58:22,666 --> 01:58:25,532
Are... you serious?

1004
01:58:25,567 --> 01:58:28,743
You might struggle,
but don't worry...

1005
01:58:28,778 --> 01:58:31,255
I'll hold you down.

1006
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:33,888
Stop! Stop it!

1007
01:58:33,923 --> 01:58:37,601
I don't wanna die!
Let me go!

1008
01:58:38,733 --> 01:58:43,047
Hold still!
I don't wanna die alone.

1009
01:58:43,082 --> 01:58:48,191
- Help! Somebody, help!
- Go quietly.

1010
01:58:50,253 --> 01:58:54,483
I don't wanna die.
Don't wanna die.

1011
01:58:54,518 --> 01:58:57,595
Don't you want to die?

1012
01:59:00,247 --> 01:59:03,427
Help me, Makoto.

1013
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:10,526
Help, Makoto!
Help me!

1014
01:59:11,276 --> 01:59:14,439
Your mother doesn't want to die!

1015
01:59:38,732 --> 01:59:42,612
You oaf!
What's with you?!

1016
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:54,328
People who taste the fear of death
can never try suicide again, so they say.

1017
01:59:56,102 --> 01:59:58,152
Take care of yourself.

1018
02:00:00,628 --> 02:00:02,812
Leave me be.

1019
02:00:08,013 --> 02:00:11,162
My plan was to die with you...

1020
02:00:15,351 --> 02:00:21,842
But at the bitter end,
you called out my name.

1021
02:00:29,544 --> 02:00:34,069
I changed my mind... Mother.

1022
02:00:51,004 --> 02:00:52,935
See you around.

1023
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:59,313
<i>I can't figure out why,
but what we want</i>

1024
02:00:59,704 --> 02:01:06,192
<i>is always surrounded by worries</i>

1025
02:01:06,528 --> 02:01:13,281
<i>Your halting habits</i>

1026
02:01:13,316 --> 02:01:20,263
<i>I thought were just mine</i>

1027
02:01:20,268 --> 02:01:25,608
<i>How foolish I was</i>

1028
02:01:26,449 --> 02:01:33,379
<i>After how long?
After how long?</i>

1029

<i>A woman knows how to love</i>

1030

How do you feel?

1035
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:14,636
How's Makoto?

1036
02:02:22,182 --> 02:02:26,580
<i>Not just trying to impress him,</i>

1037
02:02:26,615 --> 02:02:32,260
<i>So many endearing things</i>

1038
02:02:27,754 --> 02:02:31,500
I'm sorry, Iwashimizu-kun.

1039
02:02:32,269 --> 02:02:38,633
<i>I want to fall in love</i>

<i>Don't know why you left me behind</i>

1041
02:02:39,649 --> 02:02:41,600
He's coming.

1042
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:49,710
Taiga Makoto will come.
Scout's honour.

1043
02:02:45,564 --> 02:02:54,243
<i>I was arrogant and selfish</i>

1044
02:02:55,336 --> 02:03:02,491
<i>Without any light
With no end in sight</i>

1045
02:03:02,526 --> 02:03:09,367
<i>Me, knows how to love</i>

<i>Never focusing on the answers,</i>

1049

<i>Speeding our love,
gentle at times</i>

1055
02:04:05,469 --> 02:04:11,612
<i>If that's your desire,
that I am with smiles</i>

1056
02:04:12,379 --> 02:04:16,685

I'm not fooling myself, right?

1076
02:07:55,151 --> 02:07:57,655
Hey, you.

1077
02:07:58,587 --> 02:08:01,246
You live in that big villa.

1078
02:08:08,649 --> 02:08:12,035
- I'm sorry.
- Don't cry.

1079

This is what the rich do.

1084

Keep this a secret from now on.

1085
02:09:02,648 --> 02:09:06,820
It's uncool to get hurt saving a girl.
