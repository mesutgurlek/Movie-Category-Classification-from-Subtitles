(Narrator)
Long ago, and far away,

2
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:14,899
in a village high on a mountaintop,

3
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,651
something amazing was occurring.

4
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:21,906
At the very same moment, two
identical baby girls were born.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,455
One, a baby Princess.
The King and Queen were overjoyed.

6
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:34,376
Princess Anneliese would
have only the finest.

7
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:39,506
The second baby girl was named Erika.

8
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:43,886
Her parents loved her every bit as much
as the King and Queen loved the Princess.

9
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,640
But they worried.
They were so poor.

10
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:50,851
How would they be
able to care for their little daughter?

11
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,356
Many years passed.

12
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,858
The Princess learned her royal duties,

13
00:00:58,484 --> 00:01:03,280
while Erika worked long and hard as a
seamstress for the spiteful Madame Carp.

14
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:08,869
With lives so different, it
wasn't surprising that the Princess

15
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,996
and the Pauper never met.

16
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,375
But fate decreed they would.

17
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,481
It all started at the Royal Mine.

18
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:44,070
When the miners informed the
Queen the gold had run out.

19
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,156
The widowed Queen was shocked.

20
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:52,036
The Kingdom was no bankrupt. How was
she going to take care of her people?

21
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:56,291
If only she could call on
her trusted advisor Preminger,

22
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:59,002
But he was away on a long journey.

23
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:02,672
She needed to do something quickly
to save the Kingdom.

24
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,132
But what?

25
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,260
And then it struck her.

26
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:11,306
Nearby lived a rich young
King who was seeking a wife.
(End Narration)

27
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:25,737
Oh. We're late, late, late. We have 20
maximum 22 minutes for your royal fitting.

28
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:30,867
Then it's move, move, move. Your
speech at the Historical Society.

29
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,704
After that we have the
rush. And I mean rush

30
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:37,624
to the Horicortural Society Tea.

31
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:42,962
And then there's your math lessons, your
geography lessons, your science...

32
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:47,550
(Singing)
All my life I've always wanted
to have one day just for me.

33
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,679
Nothing to do and for
once nowhere I need to be.

34
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:55,767
With no lessons, Lords, or lunches,
Or 'to do' list in the way,

35
00:02:56,226 --> 00:03:02,899
No one to say when to eat
or read or leave or stay

36
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:07,946
That would be the day

37
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:15,286
All my life I've always wanted
To have one day for myself

38
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:19,707
Not waking up with a pile
of work on every shelf.

39
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:24,128
With no hems in need of pressing,
and no sleeves in disarray,

40
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:31,219
No wedding gown with a
thousand stitches to crochet

41
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:36,057
And no debt to pay.

42
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,809
Madame Carp!

43
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,979
What do you think I'm running here?
A cabaret?

44
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:43,690
I would've said a debtor's prison.

45
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,695
Keep laughing. You'll be working
for me for another 37 years.

46
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,865
But I've already paid
off more than half.

47
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:53,741
But there's interest isn't there?

48
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,995
Your parents should've thought of
that before they borrowed so much.

49
00:03:56,995 --> 00:04:00,999
- They did it to feed me!
- Their mistake.

50
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:06,129
- What would it be like to be...
- What would it be like to be...

51
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:10,508
- Free.
- Free.

52
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:14,596
Free to try crazy things

53
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:18,850
Free from endless IOU's

54
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:23,187
- Free to find
- Free to see

55
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:28,442
And marry whom I choose.

56
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:32,446
(Speaking)
I'm so sorry, my darling,

57
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:35,908
but as you know, it is vital
you marry King Dominick.

58
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,744
It is the only way to
take care of our people.

59
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:41,455
I know. It's my duty.

60
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:43,248
Oh, and look!

61
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:46,919
Another engagement gift.

62
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:51,048
(Singing)
You would think that I'm so lucky
that I have so many things

63
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,344
I'm realizing that every
present comes with strings.

64
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:59,806
Though I know I have so little,
my determination's strong.

65
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:06,813
People will gather around
the world to hear my song.

66
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:11,235
Can I come along?

67
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,279
- Now I fear I'll never be

68
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:16,573
- Soon I will forever be

69
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:20,661
- Free!
- Free!

70
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:29,127
If I close my eyes I'd feel
myself fly up a thousand miles away

71
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:33,507
I could take flight
but would it be right?

72
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:39,513
My conscious tells me stay.

73
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,516
- I'll remain forever royal

74
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:44,977
- I'll repay my parent's debt

75
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:48,856
Duty means doing the things
your heart they well regret

76
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:51,149
But I'll never stop believing

77
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:53,527
She can never stop my schemes

78
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,948
There's more to living than gloves
and gowns and threads and seams

79
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,450
In my dreams

80
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:05,706
I'll be free!
(Song Ends)

81
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:52,836
Ok, what idiot put this in here?

82
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:55,505
Oh, that would be me.

83
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:59,509
Let us review, shall we?
We are stealing gold!

84
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,762
- Is this shiny?
- No.

85
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:04,348
- Valuable?
- No.

86
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,517
- Gonna make the boss happy?
- No.

87
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:11,521
Focus, Nick.
That's what you need. That and

88
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:13,606
a break.

89
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,317
Shh!

90
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:33,042
Why, hello.

91
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:39,090
Master Preminger, you're
back... here... early.

92
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,926
Hope you had a nice journey.

93
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,393
Here you are, sir. The last of
the gold from the Royal Mine.

94
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:54,647
- There's nothing left.
- Yeah, 'cos it's all yours!

95
00:07:55,606 --> 00:08:00,027
Yes, it is, very much mine.

96
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:03,531
Finally!

97
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:07,451
(Singing)
I've been bowing, I've been scraping,
I've been lying like a rug

98
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:11,289
And for 10 long years I've
had to pay my dues.

99
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:14,709
But today I am escaping,
for the last hole has been dug

100
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,170
It was waiting there,
so how could I refuse?

101
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:21,757
I'm returning home a hero
who's discovered mighty wealth

102
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:25,303
and what better husband
could a Princess choose?

103
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:29,182
I'm the suitor who will suit her, bring
the Kingdom back to health,

104
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:32,768
and I'll wear the crown,
for how could I refuse?

105
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:36,355
Raise every glass
and rouse every cheer!

106
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:40,026
Praise that the reign
of Preminger is here!

107
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:43,487
Master in charge of all that I see

108
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,657
All hail me!

109
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:49,952
And by marrying the Princess
I get all that I desire,

110
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:53,748
Like a moat, an ermine
coat and palace views

111
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:57,376
Even though she treats me coldly,
it's a sign of inner fire

112
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,464
For inside she's thinking,
"How can I refuse?"

113
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:05,218
(Speaking)
Right, except for
this one little problem, Boss.

114
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,887
- That's Prince Boss to you!
- Right, and

115
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,973
The Queen decided to marry her off
to the King of Dulcenia next week.

116
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:12,308
What?!

117
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:16,521
Making a decision without me?
Who does she think she is?

118
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:17,772
Uh, the Queen?

119
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:21,192
- You simpering simpleton!
- Well, she is the Queen!

120
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:24,487
She's got a crown, a scepter, and
sits in her great big fancy chair...

121
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:26,656
- and those...
- Silencio!

122
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,741
(Singing)
No! I won't let go!

123
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:33,829
This peasant's son won't turn and run
because the reckless royal chose another beau!

124
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,585
Ahh!

125
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:42,672
It's... a...

126
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:44,799
Temporary setback!

127
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,385
It's a momentary loss

128
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:51,388
But conveniently my ego doesn't bruise

129
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:55,851
And the moment that I get back
I will show them who's the boss

130
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:59,980
You can bet your bullion
there'll be no "I do"'s

131
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:03,692
Yes, suppose the girl goes missing
So the king says "au revoir"

132
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:06,862
Then I find her, bring her back,
and make the news

133
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:10,282
Then the Queen will be so grateful
That she'll pledge the heir to moi

134
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:13,410
And I'll  humbly tell her
"How can I refuse?"

135
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,121
When our ceremony's over
I'll arise and take the throne

136
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:18,707
And that nitwit
Anneliese can kiss my shoe

137
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:21,167
For the Kingdom and the castle
will be mine and mine alone

138
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,296
If the crown should fit
then how can I refuse?

139
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:26,423
So... get..

140
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:30,051
ready with the roses and
stand by with the champagne

141
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:33,013
When you've got a brilliant
plan you never lose

142
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:36,057
Yes before the chapter closes
I'll be as big as Charlemagne

143
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:37,184
It's a thankless job... but

144
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:39,352
How can I refuse?

145
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:47,402
How can I refuse?
(Song Ends)

146
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:19,392
Enjoy it now, sister, 'cos it
ain't gonna be yours much longer.

147
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:23,480
Oh, please, having
delusions again, Midas?

148
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:26,691
Let's just say the throne's gonna
belong to my master, Preminger.

149
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:30,737
and anything belonging to him
ergo and ipso facto, belongs to me.

150
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,675
- You lose a tooth, Midas?
- My tooth?

151
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:54,886
No, no, not my tooth!

152
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:03,603
Ah you better hope you
got 9 lives, Serafina!

153
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,898
'Cos you're gonna need 'em all!

154
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:19,202
I am Ambassador Bismark, here
by invitation of the Queen.

155
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,584
King Dominick, you are
quite sure about this?

156
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,711
I am.

157
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:39,138
Come in!

158
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:42,558
Julian, perfect timing.

159
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:47,730
I classified this as iron pyrite.
Pretty, but not considered valuable.

160
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:51,901
- Commonly known as "fools gold".
- Well done, your Highness.

161
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:55,738
Your Highness? Why the sudden formality?

162
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:59,658
- It's just me.
- The Queen sent me.

163
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:03,746
Apparently the Ambassador has
arrived with a gift for you.

164
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:07,917
The Ambassador?
He's here already?

165
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,504
On behalf of King Dominick...

166
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:16,008
I present this engagement gift to you.

167
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:22,598
Oh! Thank you, Ambassador! Princess
Anneliese will be quite pleased.

168
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:28,687
May I enquire, Your Excellency, if
you've set a date for the wedding?

169
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:31,273
Will a week from today do?

170
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:33,108
Ah! Next week?

171
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:39,532
A most wise and thoughtful
decision, Your Majesty.

172
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:40,407
Excellent.

173
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:47,831
I will... er, send for King Dominick,
so that he may meet his new bride.

174
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:05,516
So happy.
Free to do whatever they want.

175
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:09,603
What do you think King
Dominick will be like?

176
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,981
Oh I'm sure he'll be... suitable.

177
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:17,403
Oh, I know it's the right thing to marry
him, but sometimes I wish... well...

178
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,157
Apparently he's a lover of music.
He plays 3 different instruments.

179
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,411
The dulcimer, the
trumpet, and the piano.

180
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:33,210
Anneliese...
you're going to need your cape.

181
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:36,797
I am?
Why?

182
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:45,723
There's nothing like some fresh
air and a change of scenery.

183
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,226
I wish it were that simple.

184
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:53,939
Come on, Serafina.

185
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:06,493
Ah, it feels so good to be
outside the castle walls.

186
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,787
Nobody knows who I am.

187
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:11,624
So, which one was your house?

188
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:14,501
More of a room, really.
We couldn't afford a house.

189
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:17,087
- Oh, I didn't mean...
- I know.

190
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:21,133
Third floor on the left.
Did all my studies there.

191
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:32,060
A perfect example of 'rosa centifolia'.

192
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:36,105
My favorite!
But, you knew that.

193
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:43,821
Mmm, that smells delicous.

194
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:49,619
I'll be right back.

195
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:06,010
(Singing)
Like a bird that
flies in the morning light

196
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:11,891
Or a butterfly in the spring

197
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,523
When your spirit rides
on the wings of hope

198
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:24,237
You'll find your wings

199
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,324
(Spoken)
Let's go listen, Serafina.

200
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:42,422
(Singing)
For you're
always free to begin again

201
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:48,344
And you're always free to believe

202
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:54,601
May you find your place
and your heart become...

203
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:55,935
G'day.

204
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:57,937
Madame Carp!

205
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,650
Wait, I earned that!

206
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:08,907
And you owe me. Did you really think
you could make a living as a singer?

207
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:13,036
Get back to work, girl,
or there'll be trouble.

208
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:23,129
- What a beautiful song.
- Thanks.

209
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:26,799
My Mom taught it... to... me.

210
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:31,429
Whoa.

211
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:38,144
We could be sisters.

212
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:40,146
- What's your name?
- What's your name?

213
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:44,192
- You first.
- Please, call me Anneliese.

214
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:48,029
Anneliese? You have the
same name as the Princess.

215
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:52,200
- Well...
- Oh.

216
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,662
I'm Erika, Your Highness.

217
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:58,873
Aren't you supposed to
be inside the castle?

218
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:03,795
I'm savoring a first and last taste of
freedom before getting married next week...

219
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,464
to a total stranger.

220
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,966
At least you're not an indentured servant.

221
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:12,386
Indentured servant?

222
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:17,099
(Singing)
If I'd like to have my breakfast hot
Madame Carp will make me pay

223
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,311
And I have to fetch the eggs myself
And the barn's a mile away

224
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:25,399
It's cold and wet and still I get
An omlette on my plate

225
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:30,445
But in my head I'm back in bed
Snuggled up and sleeping late.

226
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,948
(Spoken)
- Really?
- Really, but it's alright.

227
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:35,450
I mean, I'm used to it.
And you?

228
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:38,287
- Well...
- Well?

229
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:42,416
(Singing)
If I want some eggs I ring the bell
And the maid comes running in.

230
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:46,712
And she serves them on a silver tray
And she brings a cookie tin.

231
00:18:47,004 --> 00:18:51,008
And while I eat, she rubs my feet
And strolling minstrels play

232
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:55,929
But I'd rather be in my library
reading science books all day.

233
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:01,018
- I'm just like you
- You are?

234
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:02,895
You're just like me

235
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:06,899
There's somewhere else we'd rather be.

236
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:12,070
Somewhere that's ours
Somewhere that dreams come true

237
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:15,657
Yes, I am a girl like you.

238
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:19,745
You'd never think that it was so

239
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:23,916
But now I've met you and I know

240
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:29,338
It's plain as day, sure as the sky is blue

241
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:33,050
That I am a girl like you.

242
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:37,721
(Spoken)
So! You're a singer?

243
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:40,557
No, I work at Madame
Carp's penitentiary.

244
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:44,686
- Uh, I mean Dress Emporium.
- I love Madame Carp's Dresses!

245
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:47,814
I made the one you're wearing.

246
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,193
You made this? It's my favorite.

247
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:55,239
- The design looks so complicated!
- Oh, but it isn't, really...

248
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:02,663
(Singing)
First I choose a fabric from the rack
And I pin the pattern down

249
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:06,708
And I stitch it in the front and back
And it turns into a gown.

250
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:11,088
I wear the gown, without my crown
And dance around my room.

251
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:15,717
(Both)
And imagine life without the
strife of an unfamiliar groom.

252
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:20,055
(Spoken)
But I'd never let my Mother know.
I wouldn't want to disappoint her.

253
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:22,516
I completely understand.

254
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,477
(Singing)
- I'm just like you
- I think that's true

255
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:27,563
- You're just like me
- Yes, I can see

256
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:31,608
(Both)
We take responsibility.

257
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,321
We carry through/ We carry through
Do what we need to do

258
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:40,409
(Both)
Yes, I am a girl like you

259
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:44,413
I'm just like you/I'm just like you
You're just like me/You're just like me

260
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:48,625
(Both)
It's something anyone can see

261
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:50,752
- A heart that beats
- A heart that beats

262
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:53,462
(Both)
A voice that speaks the truth

263
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:57,508
(Both)
Yes, I am a girl like you.

264
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:04,056
It's amazing!
Except for our hair.

265
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:06,809
We could be twins!

266
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:12,106
What about this birthmark?

267
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,863
Hm, no, I guess not.

268
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,199
Here, Your Highness.

269
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,082
It's... uncanny.

270
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:38,216
Serafina!

271
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,510
Wolfie!

272
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:25,304
- Look who's a long way from the Palace!
- Don't get any ideas, Midas.

273
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:29,392
- I don't get these nails filed for nothing.
- I'll take my chances.

274
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,815
I'm warning you, leave her alone!

275
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,318
Heh! Or you'll do what?
Spit a hairball at me?

276
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,879
Quite a big bark you have there, Rover!

277
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:01,799
Uh, it's uh, Wolfie.
Not Rover.

278
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:05,761
Well, thank you Wolfie,
not Rover.

279
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,724
My name's Serafina.

280
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:12,894
Uh, I haven't seen
you around here before.

281
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:16,189
I don't think we run in
the same circles, but...

282
00:23:16,314 --> 00:23:19,066
perhaps we can change that.

283
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:22,403
- There you are.
- There you are.

284
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:24,864
Did I just hear your cat bark?

285
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:28,117
He has a style all his own.

286
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:34,957
I'm sorry, Your Highness,
we should be getting back.

287
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:38,085
One day you must sing
for us at the Palace.

288
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:39,836
Really?

289
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,088
I'll send someone for you.

290
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:44,299
I'll be at Madame Carp's.

291
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:48,136
Goodbye, Erika!
I won't forget.

292
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,597
Goodbye!

293
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,267
Come on, Wolfie.

294
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,728
Wolfie?

295
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,774
Cat got your tongue?

296
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,193
Come on, boy.

297
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:35,517
I may be dainty, but I'm still a feline!

298
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,666
We did it!
Let's go.

299
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,585
Come here, Nick.

300
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:09,676
Our job is to capture the Princess...
not her cat!

301
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,094
Right.

302
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,639
What'd we get the cat for?

303
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,851
Allow me to demonstrate, dimwit.

304
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,864
Serafina?

305
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,951
Serafina, where are you?

306
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,542
Serafina, come here
girl, come here kitty!

307
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,006
Serafina?

308
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:15,116
Well! That certainly wasn't called for.

309
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,413
- Ooo, are you okay?
- No, I am not okay!

310
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:27,169
My Mistress is inside with two hooligans,
and I've got dirt... dirt on my bum!

311
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:29,922
Who are you?

312
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,550
Herve.

313
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:37,012
Nice to meet you, Herve.
I'm Serafina.

314
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,140
I command you to unlock this door!

315
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:44,562
- Yes, Your Highness!
- (mimicking) Yes, Your Highness!

316
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,273
We're in charge here!

317
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,526
Right.
I knew that!

318
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:58,742
I can't believe they won't let me in there.
My Princess needs me.

319
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,121
I'm sure the boss will let her out.

320
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,956
What boss?

321
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,876
That boss!

322
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:24,602
Signed, sealed, and
delivered Master Preminger!

323
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,063
Does she know I'm behind this?

324
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,733
- No idea.
- Good!

325
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,737
Keep her here until the wedding
to King Dominick is cancelled.

326
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,782
Then we'll see who the Princess marries!

327
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,540
Oh, he is nasty!
Just like his dog.

328
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,629
Think you could get me up to the roof?

329
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,342
I do not know. It is pretty high up.

330
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,845
You can do this!
Trust me, Herve.

331
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,097
Just count to 3.

332
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,394
1, 2, 3...

333
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,233
Thank you, Herve.

334
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,574
A girl's got to do
what a girl's got to do!

335
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,165
Serafina?

336
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,961
I am simply not going to look at myself.

337
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,425
Anneliese.

338
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,761
Anneliese, Darling?

339
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,848
Are you here?

340
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:52,147
Where could she be?
She wasn't at breakfast.

341
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,651
Is that something on
her desk, Your Majesty?

342
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,868
Oh, a letter to me.

343
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:10,332
It says she's run away, so she
won't have to marry King Dominick!

344
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,879
Well this is dreadful!

345
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,048
We have to find her.
She could be hurt!

346
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:24,721
Well I'll send out search parties at once, Your
Majesty. I'm sure she couldn't have gotten far.

347
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,643
Preminger, what would I do without you?

348
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,774
This is an outrage!
The most grievous insult!

349
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,819
I am sure we'll find her.

350
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:46,618
I insist we cancel the wedding if the
Princess does not return by the end of the day!

351
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,662
It doesn't add up.
Why would she run away?

352
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,957
Why don't you see for yourself.

353
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,463
Lilac?

354
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,300
- Where did you find this?
- On the Princess's desk.

355
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,762
Perhaps I can help you look for her.

356
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:10,558
Why don't you stick to
your books, schoolboy.

357
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,269
Wouldn't that be fun?

358
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:20,693
Lilac? She never scented
her stationary with lilac.

359
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,446
It was always rose.

360
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:37,335
Welcome, sir. Are you looking
for a gown for a special lady?

361
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:43,508
I can assure you, you will find only
the finest at Madame Carp's.

362
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,762
If I may, I would like to speak to
one of your seamstresses, Miss Erika.

363
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,766
I don't believe it!
The Princess sent for me!

364
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,894
- Oh, actually...
- I'm going to sing at the Castle... me!

365
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,313
- I came because...
- But, I'm not ready.

366
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,524
- I-I have to rehearse.
- If I could just...

367
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:03,611
I better change my dress. Ho-ho, what
am I talking about? I only have one dress!

368
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,115
Wait, isn't that why you're here?

369
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,075
I'm sorry, but no.

370
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:14,164
The Princess is missing and I
need you to help me find her.

371
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,749
Me?
Well what can I do?

372
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,127
Pretend to be
Princess Anneliese.

373
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,298
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just listen.

374
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:29,345
I suspect Preminger, the Queen's Advisor, has
taken the Princess off somewhere so the
Royal Wedding will be cancelled.

375
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,930
That's awful.

376
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,808
If you pretend to be the
Princess, just for a short while,

377
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,020
I can trick Preminger into
revealing where he's hiding her.

378
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,189
Pretend to be royalty?

379
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,025
I could get thrown in prison, or worse!

380
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,194
As can I but...

381
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,531
She's in real trouble, isn't she?

382
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,495
A girl like me...

383
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,872
Count me in.

384
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,782
Would you look at the size of this place!

385
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:41,667
- The likeness is remarkable.
- Except for my hair.

386
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,961
I've thought of that.

387
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:51,051
Wolfie!

388
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,058
Nice!

389
00:32:59,476 --> 00:33:01,770
Blond in a box.

390
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:19,788
Um, Julian, we're missing
one teeny tiny detail.

391
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:24,751
I don't know a thing
about being a Princess.

392
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,587
Leave that to me.

393
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,467
It's all here in the Princess's
Book of Etiquette. Let's begin.

394
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:39,391
No nagging, bragging, sweating, fretting,
slipping, tripping, slurping, burping,
twittering or frittering allowed.

395
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:43,896
Stay present, stay pleasant, stay proud.

396
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,483
(Singing)
To be a Princess
is to know which spoon to use

397
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:51,945
To be a Princess
is to own a thousand pairs of shoes.

398
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:56,033
To maintain a regal gait
leave the parsley on your plate

399
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,204
And be charming but detached
and yet amused.

400
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:05,209
To be a Princess
is to never be confused.

401
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:13,509
Do a plié and never fall
don't ever stray from protocol

402
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,638
All through the day
there's just one way you must behave

403
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:21,683
Do keep a grip and never crack
stiff upper lip and arch the back

404
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:26,730
Bend from above
and always wear your gloves, and wave.

405
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,608
Shoulders back and
tummy in and

406
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,485
Pinky out and
lift the chin and

407
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:35,906
Slowly turn the head from side to side.
- I see now.

408
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:39,868
Breathing gently, stepping lightly
Smile brightly, nod politely

409
00:34:39,993 --> 00:34:43,955
Never show a thing you feel inside.

410
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:46,415
Glide.

411
00:34:46,582 --> 00:34:50,586
To be a Princess
is to always look your best.

412
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:54,549
To be a Princess
is to never get to rest.

413
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,509
Sit for a portrait, never squirm.

414
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:58,678
Sleep on a mattress extra firm.

415
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,682
Speak and be clever
never at a loss for words.

416
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:04,976
Curtsy to every Count and Lord.

417
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:07,144
Learn how to play the harpsichord.

418
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:11,107
Sing lullabies and always
harmonize in thirds.

419
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:14,694
(Both)
Thirds, thirds.

420
00:35:14,694 --> 00:35:17,864
And... she has beautiful eyes

421
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:21,576
Your spirits rise when
she walks in the room.

422
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:22,702
(Spoken)
I see.

423
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:26,289
Doors close and the chemistry grows.

424
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:31,502
She's like a rose
that's forever in bloom.

425
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:35,882
- Do a plié and don't
- Ever ever ever fall

426
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:38,009
- Never show dismay
- And be there when people call

427
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:42,013
Be prepared whatever royal life will bring

428
00:35:42,013 --> 00:35:44,182
- Do keep a grip and don't...
- Ever ever ever crack

429
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:46,350
- Take a dainty sip
- Never ever turn your back

430
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:50,438
There's a time and place
and way for everything

431
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:55,902
To be a princess
Is to never make your bed

432
00:35:55,902 --> 00:36:06,537
To be a princess
Is to always use your head
(Song Ends)

433
00:36:16,297 --> 00:36:18,591
It is official, then.

434
00:36:18,674 --> 00:36:24,931
Due to the disappearance of the Princess,
the wedding to King Dominick is cancelled.

435
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:30,853
Your Highness, wait!

436
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:34,857
May I present, Princess Anneliese.

437
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:39,612
Darling?

438
00:37:02,093 --> 00:37:06,097
Anneliese?
Oh-hoh, you're back!

439
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:09,183
Where have you been?

440
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:14,188
I am sorry. I should not have run away.

441
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:19,318
Promise me you'll never do it again.

442
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:23,906
I still think we should cancel the wedding.

443
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:31,705
Yes, yes, but an agreement is an
agreement. The wedding is back on!

444
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:36,168
King Dominick is...
is, is due tomorrow!

445
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:38,044
Wonderful.

446
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:40,005
Uh, tomorrow?

447
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:44,009
And then, only a few short
days before the wedding.

448
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,972
Has anyone seen my spectacles?

449
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:53,143
If you'll excuse me,
I must be off to see to the...

450
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,812
ack!... arrangements.

451
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:05,488
Who let this mangey beast in here?

452
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:09,784
Everything alright, Preminger?

453
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:12,287
It soon will be.

454
00:38:20,212 --> 00:38:22,297
What have you got there, boy?

455
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:29,137
From a silver fir tree.

456
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:32,432
What's Preminger doing
in the Western Forest?

457
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:37,729
Julian, wait! I want to hear all
about how you found Anneliese!

458
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,734
Ah... ah... of course, Your Majesty.

459
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:52,035
- Hey! I happen to know you've got
a 5 of hearts.
- What do you mean you know?

460
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,956
- I saw it!
- You mean you cheated!

461
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,707
Yeah.

462
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,209
I mean, no!

463
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:01,628
Help, help!

464
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:04,089
Please, help me!

465
00:39:04,172 --> 00:39:06,258
- Yes, Your Highness?
- What is it?

466
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:07,926
Hurry!

467
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:14,432
Ghost!

468
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:16,184
Get it!
Quick!

469
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:17,727
You're older, you get it!

470
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:20,272
You're closer, you get it!

471
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,859
It's got me!

472
00:39:25,402 --> 00:39:27,070
Help!

473
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:30,115
- No, please!
- Well done, Serafina.

474
00:39:34,703 --> 00:39:36,163
Go, go!

475
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:01,855
Let me in... you idiots!

476
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:06,151
Your Bossness,
everything is fine.

477
00:40:06,193 --> 00:40:10,197
Fine, fine, fine, fine.
Just fine! See you soon.

478
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:17,203
How did she escape?

479
00:40:17,244 --> 00:40:20,581
- Who?
- Who? The Princess!

480
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:23,125
You moron!
Idiot!

481
00:40:24,543 --> 00:40:26,212
The Princess is here.

482
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:28,464
Sleeping!

483
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:31,592
Aren't you sleeping, Princess?!

484
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:36,472
(High Pitched Voice)
Yes. I'm sleeping.

485
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:40,059
Now, boss, you don't want
to wake her up, do you?

486
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:42,186
She's a Royal...

487
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:45,856
She's a Royal, all right,
a royal pain in the behind!

488
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,861
Who interrupts my slipper?

489
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:53,739
Slumber, you bonehead!

490
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:56,575
Slumber, right!
(In normal voice): I knew that.

491
00:40:56,617 --> 00:40:58,494
Get out of that bed!

492
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:03,958
I can figure out how the
Princess escaped you two.

493
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:07,837
But why didn't she tell the
Queen she'd been captured?

494
00:41:10,297 --> 00:41:16,554
Hmm, something's odd. I must
solve this Princess puzzle if I'm to be King.

495
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:20,391
King?
Preminger?

496
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:30,734
- Looking for something, Julian?
- How can you be King?

497
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:36,740
You're the tutor. You're
supposed to have all the answers.

498
00:41:48,878 --> 00:41:50,880
Come here, Serafina.

499
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:57,928
- Who goes there?
- Princess Anneliese!

500
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:00,764
If you're the Princess, I'm the King.

501
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:04,185
- But, I am the Princess.
- Really?

502
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:07,938
Then how come I just saw the
Princess eating dinner with the Queen?

503
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,108
What Princess?

504
00:42:11,192 --> 00:42:16,197
- Now move along before I lost my temper.
- You are speaking to Princess Anneliese!

505
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,824
- Let me through!
- I said move along!

506
00:42:18,908 --> 00:42:20,159
Now!

507
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:48,646
We'll find help in here.

508
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:58,989
- What are you doing here?
- I beg your pardon!

509
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:03,243
Not another word!
You're coming with me!

510
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:18,508
Not done yet? If you weren't such a... lazy
cow... those dresses would be finished by now.

511
00:43:18,675 --> 00:43:21,177
How dare you speak to her that way!

512
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:25,306
How dare I?
H-h-how dare I?!

513
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:28,601
Just who do you think you are?

514
00:43:29,686 --> 00:43:31,980
Princess Anneliese!

515
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,650
That's a hoot!

516
00:43:35,775 --> 00:43:39,779
You've got to change a lot more
than your hair to look like the Princess.

517
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:43,741
Why me and the Princess are
close, personal friends.

518
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:45,160
Oh really?

519
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,705
Now, shut up and get back to work!

520
00:43:48,913 --> 00:43:54,752
I'm warning you, if you're going to treat
your seamstresses this way, we'll take
our Royal business elsewhere.

521
00:43:54,878 --> 00:43:57,130
You're warning me?

522
00:43:57,255 --> 00:44:04,762
We'll see your attitude change by morning. You're
not coming out until every dress is finished... Erika!

523
00:44:05,513 --> 00:44:07,182
Erika?

524
00:44:11,686 --> 00:44:14,606
- Locked in again!
- Erika?

525
00:44:15,273 --> 00:44:17,358
That is you, isn't it?

526
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:30,371
"Made exclusively by Madame Carp".

527
00:44:30,246 --> 00:44:32,749
If Wolfie can slip and in and out,

528
00:44:32,832 --> 00:44:35,835
I'm sure your pretty little
Serafina can do it too.

529
00:44:36,669 --> 00:44:38,838
It's up to you now, Serafina.

530
00:44:38,922 --> 00:44:43,092
Take this to the Castle. When somebody
reads the label, it'll lead them here.

531
00:45:16,668 --> 00:45:19,504
This is going to be a long night.

532
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:36,813
I thought I was dreaming, but I'm not.

533
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:47,322
Shh! Wolfie, we've gotta, you
know, act like we live here!

534
00:45:47,364 --> 00:45:48,824
We can't give ourselves away.

535
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:53,036
Be a Princess!
Be a Princess!

536
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,498
Come in.

537
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:03,839
Did I hear a dog, Your Majesty?
Should I call the Royal Dogcatcher?

538
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:06,383
Ah, no, no.
Dog?

539
00:46:06,884 --> 00:46:08,969
Everything is fine.

540
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:15,767
- Your breakfast, Your Highness.
- Really? In bed?

541
00:46:16,226 --> 00:46:17,686
As always.

542
00:46:17,728 --> 00:46:21,273
Oh yes. Of course.
Thank you.

543
00:46:22,566 --> 00:46:25,903
Look at all this food!
Want some?

544
00:46:26,028 --> 00:46:30,616
- Oh I-I couldn't, Your Highness!
- But there's enough to feed an army!

545
00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:35,746
- Come on, take some.
- I, uh, thank you, um, m'lady.

546
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,083
I'll draw your bath. Would you like
bubbles, mineral salts, or lavender oil?

547
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:42,252
Everything!

548
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:51,053
You're going to just tell her that
you disguised yourself as a page?

549
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:55,557
Are you sure that's wise, King Dominick?

550
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:58,936
No, I'm not sure. But
I have to be honest.

551
00:46:59,269 --> 00:47:03,857
I think she'll understand. I didn't want
to marry a stranger any more than she did.

552
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:15,953
(Sighing)
I may never come out.

553
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:19,248
What's wrong, Wolfie?
Are you sick?

554
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:22,125
Something in your throat?

555
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:24,086
Wait a minute.

556
00:47:24,086 --> 00:47:27,297
Are you trying to meow?

557
00:47:29,091 --> 00:47:31,426
Oh oh, huh.

558
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:36,515
(Singing)
I can see it when you're feeling low
You can't hide that from me

559
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,520
You're no status quo calico
So why keep trying to be?

560
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:45,941
'Cause you're more than that
You're a doggish cat

561
00:47:45,983 --> 00:47:50,612
I wish you could see the you I see

562
00:47:51,613 --> 00:47:52,698
(Spoken)
No.

563
00:47:52,698 --> 00:47:57,119
(Singing)
I say, if you bark celebrate it

564
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:00,038
Make your mark
Serenade it

565
00:48:00,122 --> 00:48:04,501
Noah's ark
Shoulda had a cat like you

566
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,880
And if what you are
Is a strange you

567
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,716
Doesn't mean
You should change you

568
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:14,720
Only means
You should change your point of view

569
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,888
(Spoken)
Princess Anneliese?

570
00:48:16,013 --> 00:48:20,434
Hey, feline
You fetch just fine

571
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:25,814
To thine ownself be true

572
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:30,902
Your bow wow's
The cat's meow

573
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:36,824
It's how I know you're you

574
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:40,077
You don't need the bows or tiara

575
00:48:40,036 --> 00:48:42,830
Bid your woes sayonara

576
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:47,210
Trust your nose
'Cause it knows the way to go

577
00:48:47,376 --> 00:48:50,546
When you
Chase your tail You're enchanting

578
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,132
Spirits sail
When you're panting

579
00:48:53,216 --> 00:48:58,596
When you wail
You're a rover, Romeo

580
00:48:58,596 --> 00:49:03,226
There is not
One hair of you

581
00:49:03,351 --> 00:49:08,731
That I would rearrange

582
00:49:09,357 --> 00:49:13,945
I love you the way you are

583
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:19,784
And that will never change

584
00:49:19,992 --> 00:49:25,832
That will never

585
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:30,628
change.
(Song Ends)

586
00:49:30,878 --> 00:49:32,755
That's my boy!

587
00:49:41,389 --> 00:49:43,683
There, this one's finished!

588
00:49:44,976 --> 00:49:46,435
Uh, sort of...

589
00:49:46,602 --> 00:49:49,856
Please, Your Highness,
you don't have to do this!

590
00:49:50,189 --> 00:49:53,109
I can't let you do it all by yourself.

591
00:50:04,579 --> 00:50:08,583
How am I going to do this?
Everyone will know I'm a fake.

592
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,253
They'll throw me in the
dungeon in two seconds flat!

593
00:50:12,461 --> 00:50:16,465
Oh Julian, where are you?
Why aren't you here?

594
00:50:18,426 --> 00:50:21,345
Your most beautiful, Highness.

595
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:27,685
What's this stupid cat doing here?

596
00:50:27,685 --> 00:50:31,689
- He belongs to me.
- Oh! He's yours, is he?

597
00:50:31,772 --> 00:50:34,484
Well, a thousand apologies, My Lady.

598
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:38,613
Such a canine... feline.

599
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:40,865
What happened to the other one?

600
00:50:40,948 --> 00:50:45,119
- Uh... she's around here somewhere.
- I see.

601
00:50:46,496 --> 00:50:49,832
So rare... that you're apart.

602
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:54,337
The Queen has sent me to
escort you to meet the King.

603
00:50:54,754 --> 00:50:55,796
Uhh...

604
00:50:57,715 --> 00:50:58,841
Thank you.

605
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:07,225
I appreciate your
understanding, Your Majesty.

606
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,231
Likewise, King Dominick. I apologize for my
daughter's little delay in the wedding plans.

607
00:51:13,272 --> 00:51:15,775
But it's all sorted out now.

608
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,570
May I announce, Princess Anneliese.

609
00:51:21,071 --> 00:51:27,118
Oh hello, Darling. Come, come.
I want to introduce you to King Dominick.

610
00:51:29,496 --> 00:51:31,790
He has something he wants to tell you.

611
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:35,418
Where are my spectacles?

612
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:38,547
I'm honored.

613
00:51:38,547 --> 00:51:40,215
Uhh...

614
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:45,345
The honor's mine, King Dominick.

615
00:51:45,387 --> 00:51:48,098
Please, just call me Dominick.

616
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:51,434
Oh, call me Eri...
I mean Anneliese.

617
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,687
Princess Anneliese.

618
00:51:54,896 --> 00:51:56,356
That's my name.

619
00:52:02,696 --> 00:52:05,407
I hope his bark is bigger than his bite.

620
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:10,162
He likes you.

621
00:52:10,996 --> 00:52:14,332
I'm sure you're wondering why
I disguised myself as a page.

622
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:18,336
I wanted to meet you
without all this-this ceremony.

623
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,589
To get to know the real you.

624
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:23,466
Uh, the real me...

625
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:27,596
King Dominick, would you do us
the honor of playing the piano?

626
00:52:27,762 --> 00:52:31,766
- I know you love music.
- You do?

627
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:36,188
I will, if the Princess
agrees to sing with me.

628
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:38,773
Sing with you.

629
00:52:38,899 --> 00:52:44,529
- Uh, no, no, I couldn't.
- Something tells me you have
a wonderful voice.

630
00:52:57,042 --> 00:52:59,002
Sing, darling.

631
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:07,594
(Singing)
Once a lass met a lad

632
00:53:07,677 --> 00:53:11,681
You're a gentle one, said she

633
00:53:12,098 --> 00:53:16,102
In my heart I'd be glad

634
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:20,315
If you loved me for me

635
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:24,694
You say your love is true

636
00:53:24,986 --> 00:53:28,990
And I hope that it will be

637
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:33,245
(Dominick)
I'd be sure, if I knew

638
00:53:33,286 --> 00:53:38,708
That you loved me for me

639
00:53:39,876 --> 00:53:43,880
(Erika)
Could I be the one you're seeking?

640
00:53:44,256 --> 00:53:48,176
Will I be the one you choose?

641
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:52,264
Can you tell my heart is speaking?

642
00:53:52,305 --> 00:53:56,309
My eyes will give you clues

643
00:53:56,685 --> 00:54:00,564
(Dominick)
What you see may be deceiving

644
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:04,608
Truth lies underneath the skin

645
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,737
(Erika)
Hope will blossum by believing

646
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:14,785
(Both)
The heart that lies within

647
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:18,747
(Dominick)
I'll be yours

648
00:54:18,831 --> 00:54:26,797
Together we shall always be as one

649
00:54:27,006 --> 00:54:32,636
If you love me for me

650
00:54:33,596 --> 00:54:37,183
(Singing at the same time)
- Who can say where we'll go?
- I'll be yours

651
00:54:37,183 --> 00:54:41,395
- Together we shall always
- Who can promise what will be?

652
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:44,690
- Be as one
- But I'll stay by your side

653
00:54:44,732 --> 00:54:48,736
If you love me for me.

654
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:57,119
If you love me for me.
(Song Ends)

655
00:54:59,955 --> 00:55:01,832
Breath-taking.

656
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:06,712
The prettiest sunset I've ever seen.

657
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:12,468
There's something about you...

658
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:16,055
Your eyes... no pretenses.

659
00:55:16,305 --> 00:55:20,893
I like that. Until
tomorrow, Your Highness.

660
00:55:33,447 --> 00:55:35,825
"Honest"?
"No pretenses"?

661
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,537
Oh, Wolfie, Julian and the
Princess are still missing.

662
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:42,665
And I think I'm falling
in love with the King.

663
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:55,094
Why, it's our missing little feline.

664
00:55:56,637 --> 00:55:58,931
But with an attitude, oh yes!

665
00:55:59,682 --> 00:56:02,601
I never liked cats.

666
00:56:03,811 --> 00:56:07,565
Hm. The Princess's ring.
How odd.

667
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:13,737
Madame Carp's Dress Shop?

668
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:17,283
Maybe the answer to our mystery.

669
00:56:48,646 --> 00:56:50,523
Thank you, Herve.

670
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:52,692
My Princess!

671
00:57:04,704 --> 00:57:06,873
Preminger, you found my ring!

672
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,251
You good girl!

673
00:57:10,919 --> 00:57:13,004
Princess...

674
00:57:14,422 --> 00:57:16,299
Serafina, what's gotten into you?

675
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:20,053
Come quickly, Princess. You can tell
me everything on the way to the castle.

676
00:57:20,178 --> 00:57:23,723
- But first let me...
- No, no. No time, Your Highness.

677
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,272
Princess?

678
00:57:42,575 --> 00:57:44,369
What are we doing here?

679
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:46,871
Taking a little side trip, Princess.

680
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,123
You were behind this!

681
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:52,418
Very clever planting
a double to fool even me.

682
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,879
But not quite clever enough.

683
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:56,631
Checkmate!

684
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,258
I win.

685
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,760
Serafina!

686
00:58:10,478 --> 00:58:13,731
Nice to see you again, Your Highness.
Watch your step.

687
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:17,694
I don't understand, Preminger.
Why would you do this?

688
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:19,696
To be King.

689
00:58:20,613 --> 00:58:25,535
- And how would you get to be King?
- Still underestimating me?

690
00:58:25,577 --> 00:58:27,662
Isn't that just like a Royal.

691
00:58:28,454 --> 00:58:31,457
- He was going to marry you.
- What?!

692
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:34,377
Now, he's got a new bride in mind.

693
00:58:34,919 --> 00:58:38,423
Your Mother is a very handsome woman.

694
00:58:48,433 --> 00:58:49,893
Julian!

695
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,519
Anneliese!

696
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:56,900
How sad they'll be when they discover
you died in a tragic accident.

697
00:58:56,941 --> 00:58:59,319
They'll never give up
looking for the Princess!

698
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,613
Oh I think they will.

699
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:04,616
When I show them this!

700
00:59:07,494 --> 00:59:09,787
Oh that's funny.

701
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:23,468
- No good.
- We have to stop him.

702
00:59:30,642 --> 00:59:32,727
Put a little muscle behind it!

703
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,408
What's that?

704
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,627
Move it!

705
01:00:08,512 --> 01:00:12,516
Everything seems to be in
order. Thank you, Ambassador.

706
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,436
The Kingdoms will be officially
joined after the wedding tomorrow.

707
01:00:16,478 --> 01:00:20,482
- Are you ready, Darling?
- Ready...

708
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:22,025
Well...

709
01:00:23,277 --> 01:00:25,362
For my bride to be.

710
01:00:30,576 --> 01:00:31,577
Whoa!

711
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:40,919
Grab her! She's an imposter!

712
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:46,800
Preminger, what are you doing?

713
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:51,013
- Get your hands off me!
- Release the Princess!

714
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:53,807
She's a fake!
A common pauper!

715
01:00:54,475 --> 01:00:57,603
Are you telling me I
don't know my own daughter?

716
01:00:57,686 --> 01:01:01,607
I only just discovered the
truth myself, Your Majesty.

717
01:01:01,648 --> 01:01:04,860
Have you not wondered why we
haven't seen Julian lately?

718
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:08,697
He's conspiring with this-this imposter!

719
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:12,034
Together they took the Princess
and hid her in the Royal Mine so-

720
01:01:12,075 --> 01:01:14,786
so she could take her place,

721
01:01:15,037 --> 01:01:18,123
marry King Dominick
and take over the Kingdom!

722
01:01:18,165 --> 01:01:22,044
And what proof do you have
of this ridiculous story?

723
01:01:22,127 --> 01:01:26,798
Once I discovered this treachery,
I tried to rescue the Princess

724
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,717
but it was too late.

725
01:01:28,884 --> 01:01:32,221
They sabatoged the Mine, collapsing it.

726
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,684
I'm afraid this is all my
workers found in the rubble.

727
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:39,186
No!

728
01:01:41,939 --> 01:01:43,607
It cannot be!

729
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:47,027
Check her shoulder!
There's no royal birthmark.

730
01:01:47,152 --> 01:01:48,821
I assure you.

731
01:01:55,786 --> 01:01:57,204
It's true.

732
01:02:11,426 --> 01:02:14,763
- I don't believe it.
- I can explain.

733
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:16,974
Throw her in the dungeon!

734
01:02:16,974 --> 01:02:18,267
No, wait!

735
01:02:18,892 --> 01:02:24,522
I-I'm not the Princess, but I
never hurt her or anybody else!

736
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:27,483
Unbelieveable!

737
01:02:27,483 --> 01:02:29,944
It's an outrage!

738
01:02:30,111 --> 01:02:34,490
I-I just wanted to save
the Princess! From him!

739
01:02:34,824 --> 01:02:37,118
The dungeon!

740
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:50,131
My daughter...
My poor daughter...

741
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:56,053
What do they take us for?
Fools?

742
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:59,974
Trying to marry you
off to a mere pauper!?

743
01:03:00,516 --> 01:03:03,978
- It doesn't make sense.
- I should say not.

744
01:03:04,103 --> 01:03:08,107
The sooner we leave,
the happier I'll be.

745
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:19,494
(Erika singing)
Do a plié and never fall

746
01:03:19,494 --> 01:03:22,955
Don't ever stray from protocol

747
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:29,003
All through the day
There's just one way
You must behave

748
01:03:30,004 --> 01:03:33,174
Do keep a grip and never crack

749
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:36,636
Stiff upper lip...

750
01:03:36,677 --> 01:03:44,310
Stiff upper lip...

751
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:56,989
- Ah! Just who I wanted to see.
- Preminger, what is it?

752
01:03:57,532 --> 01:04:01,536
So many problems.
I'm here to help.

753
01:04:01,577 --> 01:04:03,830
- You can't bring my daughter back.
- Too true.

754
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:09,168
But I can provide the answer
to saving your Kingdom.

755
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:15,967
A little business venture of mine was very
successful. You could say I "struck gold".

756
01:04:16,843 --> 01:04:20,012
I'm as wealthy as King Dominick.

757
01:04:20,388 --> 01:04:24,392
(Singing)
Well your good luck has departed
and your people soon will starve

758
01:04:24,392 --> 01:04:27,603
Au revoir to your foie
gras and cheese fondues.

759
01:04:27,895 --> 01:04:32,108
But because I'm so good-hearted
half my fortune I will carve

760
01:04:32,191 --> 01:04:35,820
I feel your pain, so how could I refuse?

761
01:04:35,903 --> 01:04:40,116
But to give me some incentive,
there's just one thing I require

762
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:44,036
And it's something
that you never even use

763
01:04:44,203 --> 01:04:48,166
And it's nothing that inventive
just the one thing I desire

764
01:04:48,207 --> 01:04:51,627
This simple crown,
yes, how could I refuse?

765
01:04:51,878 --> 01:04:55,506
Oh, don't let your spirits
falter I've a ring box in my hand

766
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:59,218
And I booked a band so
grab your dancing shoes

767
01:04:59,302 --> 01:05:03,514
And come with me to the altar
see the Kingdom as you plan

768
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:07,184
Yes, marry me for how can you refuse?

769
01:05:07,601 --> 01:05:15,817
How can you refuse?
(Song Ends)

770
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:42,928
Are you Wolfie?
Serafina's friend?

771
01:05:43,261 --> 01:05:45,806
- I like to think so.
- She needs help.

772
01:05:46,264 --> 01:05:49,100
- and so does the Princess.
- What?

773
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:54,689
Show me, quick!

774
01:06:02,155 --> 01:06:03,615
Sorry, Serafina!

775
01:06:14,084 --> 01:06:17,420
It's hopeless. I'm sorry, Anneliese.

776
01:06:18,046 --> 01:06:20,340
Do you know why I didn't
want to marry the King?

777
01:06:20,966 --> 01:06:25,637
- You weren't ready to get married.
- No, I was in love with somebody else.

778
01:06:26,263 --> 01:06:30,267
My best friend. The man
who's taught me so much.

779
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:35,397
But I'm not a King. I
can't give you what he can.

780
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,357
I think you're like this.

781
01:06:39,484 --> 01:06:40,944
A rock?

782
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:46,032
Unassuming on the outside,
and a treasure within.

783
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:54,916
We'll get out of here
somehow. I promise.

784
01:06:58,086 --> 01:07:02,883
- Don't tell me she's in there.
- Alright, I will not tell you.

785
01:07:08,346 --> 01:07:11,850
Ooo, I'm getting...
Ooo yeah, I'm getting...

786
01:07:11,892 --> 01:07:15,228
- Uh, dizzy?
- No. A scent.

787
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,274
There's another way in.

788
01:07:28,783 --> 01:07:31,953
Look at you...

789
01:07:32,037 --> 01:07:33,705
looking at me.

790
01:07:34,915 --> 01:07:36,166
Lovely.

791
01:07:57,186 --> 01:08:00,022
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Down here!

792
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:14,745
- Whaddya make of that?
- Oh, uh, you are an excellent digger.

793
01:08:15,454 --> 01:08:17,998
Thank you, but I meant look!

794
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:21,293
I'll bet I can get to Serafina
and the Princess this way.

795
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:57,496
You are going down there?

796
01:08:58,914 --> 01:09:02,418
A cat always lands on his
feet, even one that barks!

797
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:12,928
Erika's cat?

798
01:09:14,388 --> 01:09:16,140
An old mine shaft.

799
01:09:16,515 --> 01:09:19,226
Hello? Anybody up there?

800
01:09:24,148 --> 01:09:25,399
Water...

801
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:27,735
Here, help me!

802
01:09:39,955 --> 01:09:41,624
Beautiful.

803
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:04,622
No, let me go!

804
01:11:05,373 --> 01:11:09,002
Thought you could escape, did you?
I'll lock her up.

805
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:11,713
- I'm to take her to the castle.
- But...

806
01:11:11,713 --> 01:11:13,590
The Queen's orders.

807
01:11:14,299 --> 01:11:15,884
Oh, well, right then.

808
01:11:29,147 --> 01:11:33,151
- Looking good, Sir Nick.
- Feeling good, Sir Nack.

809
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,913
Smile, my Dear.
You're about to become my Queen.

810
01:11:44,954 --> 01:11:49,125
Only to save my people. Your
fortune will help them all.

811
01:11:56,633 --> 01:11:59,969
This way.
Hey!

812
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:04,432
- I guess I deserved that.
- Dominick?

813
01:12:04,557 --> 01:12:06,059
I need to explain...

814
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:10,063
I don't believe you're the
person Preminger says you are.

815
01:12:11,064 --> 01:12:14,651
You do love disguises, don't you?

816
01:12:14,692 --> 01:12:16,277
Come, we need to hurry!

817
01:12:18,822 --> 01:12:22,826
Do you, Preminger, take
this woman to be your bride?

818
01:12:22,992 --> 01:12:26,955
Yes. How could I refuse?

819
01:12:27,288 --> 01:12:31,292
And do you, My Queen, take
this man to be your husband?

820
01:12:33,253 --> 01:12:34,295
I...

821
01:12:37,257 --> 01:12:39,134
I... uh I..

822
01:12:44,556 --> 01:12:46,432
- I d...
- Wait! Wait!

823
01:12:48,143 --> 01:12:50,145
Stop the wedding, Mother!

824
01:12:50,562 --> 01:12:54,440
- Anneliese?
- But, she's dead, Your Highness!

825
01:12:54,482 --> 01:12:56,484
The imposter must have escaped.

826
01:12:56,484 --> 01:12:57,944
No, Preminger.

827
01:13:01,698 --> 01:13:03,575
It is you!

828
01:13:06,536 --> 01:13:08,329
My Darling.

829
01:13:08,454 --> 01:13:10,331
It's the Princess! She's back!

830
01:13:14,419 --> 01:13:17,547
It's the Princess!
She's alive!

831
01:13:18,882 --> 01:13:20,758
But where were you?

832
01:13:21,718 --> 01:13:24,428
- I thought...
- What he wanted you to think!

833
01:13:26,388 --> 01:13:28,807
Guards! Take him!

834
01:13:30,893 --> 01:13:31,935
Hai!

835
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:36,106
- He can't get away!
- He won't get away!

836
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:49,077
Nice to see you again.

837
01:13:52,206 --> 01:13:53,999
Going somewhere?

838
01:13:56,126 --> 01:13:58,212
Not so fast, puffy!

839
01:13:58,837 --> 01:14:00,506
Now who has nowhere to go?

840
01:14:01,215 --> 01:14:04,134
Yeah, nowhere to go...
but through you!

841
01:14:11,225 --> 01:14:12,810
My tooth!

842
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:16,396
Oh my beautiful tooth!

843
01:14:20,484 --> 01:14:22,069
Fater, you old nag!

844
01:14:26,949 --> 01:14:30,494
I've seen snails faster!

845
01:14:34,081 --> 01:14:35,332
What are you doing?

846
01:14:38,377 --> 01:14:39,419
Turn around!

847
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:42,840
Stop, you stupid beast!

848
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:45,634
I said stop!

849
01:14:54,393 --> 01:14:59,189
- I like your style, Herve.
- So do I.

850
01:15:10,117 --> 01:15:14,496
Preminger played me for a fool.
I'm sorry, my Darling Anneliese.

851
01:15:15,164 --> 01:15:17,749
When I think what might have happened...

852
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:22,296
But it didn't. Thanks to
Erika and the man I love...

853
01:15:22,713 --> 01:15:25,424
- Julian.
- Julian?

854
01:15:25,632 --> 01:15:29,428
He's kind, intelligent,
and my best friend.

855
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,056
Mother, it's Julian I want to marry.

856
01:15:34,057 --> 01:15:39,480
I want you to be happy. But it is our
duty to take care of our people first.

857
01:15:40,105 --> 01:15:44,902
I can do that. I found something
very interesting in the mine.

858
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:52,743
- I can't convince you to stay?
- Dominick, I...

859
01:15:54,036 --> 01:15:59,333
All my life I've dreamed of being free.
Now my debt's been paid.

860
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:03,337
- Thanks to Anneliese.
- Where will you go?

861
01:16:03,587 --> 01:16:04,713
Everywhere.

862
01:16:04,755 --> 01:16:07,799
I want to sing, see the world!

863
01:16:08,216 --> 01:16:11,969
Then, I hope you'll take this with you.

864
01:16:14,597 --> 01:16:16,265
I couldn't.

865
01:16:19,685 --> 01:16:21,354
It was meant for you.

866
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,069
- No promises?
- I'll take my chances.

867
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:45,545
(Narrator) Princess Anneliese
was right about the Mine.

868
01:16:45,586 --> 01:16:49,590
She discovered it was
filled with geodes.

869
01:16:49,882 --> 01:16:53,886
Under her direction, the beautiful
crystals created a new industry.

870
01:16:55,263 --> 01:16:59,267
The Kingdom was saved.

871
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:04,105
As for Madame Carp, without the word
from the Castle, she went out of business.

872
01:17:10,111 --> 01:17:14,115
After months of traveling, Erika
realized there was one place

873
01:17:14,282 --> 01:17:18,286
she wanted to stay
more than anywhere else.

874
01:17:19,162 --> 01:17:22,331
Sometimes being free
means choosing not to go,

875
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:25,209
but to stay.

876
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:34,427
(Erika Singing)
And you're always free to begin again

877
01:17:31,424 --> 01:17:35,428
And you're always free to believe

878
01:17:37,472 --> 01:17:43,478
When you find the place
That your heart belongs

879
01:17:43,769 --> 01:17:49,775
You'll never leave

880
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:53,237
(Anneliese Singing)
You and I will always be

881
01:17:53,321 --> 01:17:56,199
Celebrating life together

882
01:17:56,199 --> 01:18:01,621
I know I have found a friend forever more

883
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:05,041
Love is like a melody

884
01:18:05,082 --> 01:18:08,127
One that I will always treasure

885
01:18:08,211 --> 01:18:13,591
Courage is the key that opens every door

886
01:18:13,633 --> 01:18:19,222
(Erika and Anneliese together)
Though you may not know
Where your gifts may lead

887
01:18:19,388 --> 01:18:25,228
And it may not show at the start

888
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:31,692
When you live your dreams
You'll find destiny

889
01:18:31,943 --> 01:18:43,120
Is written in your heart

890
01:18:44,372 --> 01:18:48,584
(Narrator)
And, of course, Wolfie and Serafina
lived happily ever after.

891
01:18:49,168 --> 01:18:53,381
Along with their many,
many, many kittens.

892
01:18:56,842 --> 01:19:02,222
(Choir)
Though you may not know
Where your gifts may lead

893
01:19:02,681 --> 01:19:07,936
And it may not show at the start

894
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:14,609
When you live your dream
You'll find destiny

895
01:19:14,985 --> 01:19:26,872
Is written in your heart.
(Song Ends)

896
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:38,925
Standing cat is ready.
Serafina stunt test: take one.

897
01:19:39,009 --> 01:19:40,677
And... action!

898
01:19:43,722 --> 01:19:44,973
Oh, Dear.

899
01:19:44,973 --> 01:19:46,641
Quiet on the set please.

900
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:48,059
And... action!

901
01:19:51,271 --> 01:19:54,816
Uh, I'm quite sure
this is a good idea.

902
01:19:55,358 --> 01:19:57,110
Take 37.

903
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:58,987
And... action!

904
01:20:01,406 --> 01:20:03,700
<i>Ok, let's bring in Serafina.</i>

905
01:20:04,826 --> 01:20:06,828
Uh, can you get my agent
on the phone?

906
01:20:09,498 --> 01:20:11,583
My, you're attractive.

907
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:16,171
(Singing)
You're no status quo calico
so why keep trying to be

908
01:20:16,254 --> 01:20:20,425
'cos you're more than that
you're a dogish --

909
01:20:20,425 --> 01:20:21,426
(Splash!)
Ruff!

910
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:23,178
- Wolfie!
- Cut!

911
01:20:23,178 --> 01:20:25,055
Ok, can I get a hair dryer
over here?

912
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,974
Aren't you pleasant to the eye

913
01:20:28,016 --> 01:20:30,101
you, reflection you!

914
01:20:30,685 --> 01:20:32,270
Mine cart, take one.

915
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:34,439
And... action!

916
01:20:36,149 --> 01:20:37,150
Cut!

917
01:20:37,567 --> 01:20:40,153
<i>Uh Nick, um, you're supposed
to jump into the cart.</i>

918
01:20:40,695 --> 01:20:43,240
Right. I knew that!

919
01:20:43,281 --> 01:20:47,661
Is that really me?
In there? Looking at me?

920
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:50,038
Lucky me!

921
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:56,044
Breath taking!

922
01:20:56,711 --> 01:20:58,171
(Sighing)
(Cell phone ringing)

923
01:20:58,255 --> 01:21:01,383
(Gasping)
Sorry!

924
01:21:01,383 --> 01:21:02,384
(Laughing)

925
01:21:03,385 --> 01:21:05,137
How romantic, right?

926
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:07,889
Very handsome, very fit!

927
01:21:08,557 --> 01:21:11,059
Very irresistible!

928
01:21:13,103 --> 01:21:15,647
- Do a plié and don't
- Ever ever ever fool

929
01:21:15,689 --> 01:21:32,330
- Never show dismay
- (Laughing)
