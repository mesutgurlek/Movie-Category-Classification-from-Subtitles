1
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,295
Do you swear to tell the truth,
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:00,027
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

3
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:05,239
You're a professional songwriter,
I believe, Mrs. Crane.

4
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,137
- I am.
- Your husband also?

5
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,872
- Yes.
- You composed love songs together, eh?

6
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,516
- Mostly.
- Who wrote the words?

7
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:15,981
- I did.
- I see.

8
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:18,017
And your husband furnished the music?

9
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:21,351
Oh, no, his music came first,
I furnished the words.

10
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,621
How long did you know the defendant
before you married him?

11
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,592
About four and a half years.

12
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:29,027
And you met him professionally
at that time?

13
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,092
Well, um, not exactly, Your Honor.

14
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,237
You see...

15
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:39,965
Well, he used to come into a little
restaurant on 47th Street where I worked.

16
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:42,771
I used to serve him breakfast
every day at 12.

17
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:46,143
He'd eat 50 cents' worth
and I'd only punch 20 on the check.

18
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:48,544
That's how we became acquainted.

19
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,856
Why did you do that?

20
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,049
I liked him.

21
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,889
Well, don't you think that was
dishonest to your employer?

22
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:03,260
No. I always put the difference
on somebody else's check.

23
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:11,703
I take it Mr. Crane wasn't so successful.

24
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,436
- Well, nobody appreciated him then.
- Except you.

25
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,706
- Well, I didn't count.
- But you encouraged him.

26
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,146
- Yes.
- So you feel you discovered him?

27
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:23,148
No. Eddie discovered me.

28
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,810
- How?
- I went out with him one night...

29
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,422
Proceed, Mrs. Crane.

30
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,329
Well, we became a habit.

31
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,798
I know, but how did you happen
to become a writer of lyrics?

32
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,633
Oh.

33
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,903
Well, I started rewriting
Mother Goose when I was only 6.

34
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,871
Then I wound up writing verses
on greeting cards...

35
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:48,635
...and the firm went bankrupt.

36
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:51,476
That's when I went into dealing them
off the arm.

37
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,811
- Off the arm?
- Yes. You know, like:

38
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,713
Oh, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,820
I mean, that's when I became a waitress.

40
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,081
- Your Honor, may I interrupt?
Yes.

41
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:05,125
I would like Mrs. Crane to tell us how she
formed this partnership with her husband.

42
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:06,819
It's relevant at this point.

43
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:12,461
Just tell us in your own words,
Mrs. Crane.

44
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,871
Well, it all happened
very suddenly one night.

45
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,203
We were sitting in a little gloomy piano
room at Max Milton's publishing house.

46
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:23,834
<i>Max thought Eddie had talent,
so he let him use the room as a favor.</i>

47
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:28,279
<i>Well, Eddie was working with a lyric writer
on one of the best tunes he ever wrote.</i>

48
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,476
<i>But it was no dice.</i>

49
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:33,417
<i>I was just sitting there
listening to that piano.</i>

50
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:36,683
<i>They'd been going on for hours.</i>

51
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:44,657
Something's wrong.
Maybe it's me or the tune.

52
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,665
I don't know, but I'm not clicking.

53
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,767
Well, you will. You will.
Take your time, Billy.

54
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,336
Look, Eddie, I'll be frank with you.

55
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,673
It's silly for us to waste our time.
I just don't like the tune.

56
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,213
Oh.

57
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:07,049
That doesn't mean we can't get together.
That's not the only tune you'll write.

58
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,952
I don't know whether it is or not.

59
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,617
You're taking it too serious, kid.
Pull yourself together. Let's get coffee.

60
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,763
- What do you say?
- Whatever Eddie says.

61
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:17,126
No, you go ahead.
I'll stick around for a while.

62
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,927
Okay. No hard feelings?

63
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:20,296
No, certainly not.

64
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,529
And thanks for getting together with me.

65
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,503
Forget it. If you think you got something,
give me a jingle.

66
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:28,439
- I want a hit as much as you. Good night.
Good night.

67
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,307
- Night, Dixie.
- Night.

68
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,758
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to take it out on you.

69
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:50,226
Eddie...

70
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,494
...I know you're disappointed,
and I don't blame you.

71
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,796
Just because Billy
says the tune's no good...

72
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,599
...that doesn't make it so.

73
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,265
Why, it's beautiful.

74
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,535
You don't understand.

75
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:05,670
It isn't only the song.
It isn't necessarily Billy. It's just that...

76
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:08,510
Well, in this business
you've gotta have a hookup, a team.

77
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,812
There's no sense in writing a tune
then peddling it like a hot fur coat...

78
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:14,650
...from one guy to another
hoping to get a fluke hit.

79
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:17,622
You've gotta work with somebody
until you've built a style...

80
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,354
...and a quality that's recognizable.

81
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,130
Look at George Gershwin. He had Ira.

82
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,427
There's Rodgers and Hart,
Kern and Hammerstein.

83
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:28,729
Oh, what's the use?
There are a dozen more.

84
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,897
They work together.
One helps the other and they go places.

85
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:35,533
Yeah. I know what you mean.

86
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:39,946
- Eddie?
- Mm?

87
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:42,949
Would you mind
if a girl wrote the words to your tune?

88
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,680
Of course not. There's Dorothy Fields.
She's one of the best in the business.

89
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:48,687
Well, could you get her?

90
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:51,383
No. She's tied up.

91
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,453
Would you listen to some I wrote?

92
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,633
- You?
- Oh...

93
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,667
I know it's ridiculous for me to think
that you could think...

94
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,862
...that I could write some words...

95
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,702
...but the melody kept saying the words
over and over while you were playing...

96
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:09,242
...and before I knew it, I had a song.
- You have?

97
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,107
- Uh-huh. You wanna hear it?
- Let me see the words. I can tell by looking.

98
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:16,251
You couldn't read them.
I jotted them down on my handkerchief.

99
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:20,947
I always do.
It's, well, kind of unobtrusive.

100
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,752
Well, go ahead and play, Eddie.

101
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,621
But don't laugh, will you?

102
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:29,595
- The way I feel?
- Well, not in my face, anyhow.

103
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,504
<i>You'll never know
If an apple is ripe</i>

104
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:45,476
<i>Till you bite it</i>

105
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:52,486
<i>You'll never know
If a fire is gonna burn</i>

106
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,223
<i>Till you light it</i>

107
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:01,456
<i>You'll never know
What it means to be blue</i>

108
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:05,863
<i>Till you've lost an old friend</i>

109
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:11,439
<i>You'll never know
Just how long is your road</i>

110
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:15,737
<i>Till you've reached the end</i>

111
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:21,046
<i>You'll never know

112
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:23,912

113
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:31,760
<i>You'll never know
What one kind word can do</i>

114
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,830
<i>Till you've said it</i>

115
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,161
<i>You and I could find romance</i>

116
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:50,703
<i>But, darling, till you take that chance</i>

117
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:56,448
<i>You'll never, never</i>

118
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:02,649
<i>Never ever</i>

119
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:06,761
<i>Know</i>

120
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:12,857
Dixie, you've done it.

121
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:15,265
- I don't know how, but you've done it.
- Have I?

122
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:18,771
Why, it makes me sick, it's so wonderful.

123
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:23,002
You let me die on the vine for lyrics,
and you've got them up your sleeve.

124
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,612
I think it'll swing too.

125
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,340
- I'll bet it will. Let's try it.
- Yeah.

126
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,424
<i>You'll never know if an apple is ripe</i>

127
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,493

136
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,557

137
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:23,933
<i>Till you take</i>

138
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:28,475
<i>That chance</i>

139
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,369
Gosh, Dixie.

140
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,844
Gosh, Eddie.

141
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,779
By golly, that deserves a kiss.

142
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:43,756
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if Crane and
Donegan had a hit on their handkerchief.

143
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:45,920
And it was a hit too.

144
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:49,462
We went to work on another one,
which didn't come so easy, incidentally.

145
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:52,999
But we fought and wrestled it through,
and it was successful.

146
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:56,502
So then I thought it was safe for me
to quit my job in the restaurant.

147
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:58,105
Besides...

148
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:01,038
...Eddie felt that he could afford
to eat in a better place.

149
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:02,901
I see.

150
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,242
And this successful collaboration
led to your marriage.

151
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,882
Yes, Your Honor.

152
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,484
That, plus a little item called love.

153
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:13,121
On whose part?

154
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:15,649
Well, mine, I guess.

155
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,452
Ah. It didn't last?

156
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:19,918
I didn't say that.

157
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,859
Oh, one of those.

158
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:23,589
You love him, but...

159
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,597
Your Honor, may I interrupt once more?

160
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,894
Yes.

161
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,128
I would like to call a witness
if the court pleases.

162
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:32,934
Someone altogether impartial
who could clarify this portion of the case.

163
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,670
Yes. I think it's going to need
a little clarity. Go ahead.

164
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,838
That will be all for the time being,
Mrs. Crane.

165
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,879
Miss Marilyn Marsh, please.

166
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,957
Name, please?
- Marilyn Marsh.

167
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,220
Raise your right hand.

168
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:56,593
Do you swear to tell the truth,
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

169
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,291
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

170
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:03,171
Will you tell the court your occupation
or profession?

171
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:04,363
I'm a dancer.

172
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,440
You've appeared
in Broadway productions?

173
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:07,871
I have.

174
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,477
How long have you known
Mr. And Mrs. Crane?

175
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,740
Over three years. Ever since they started
writing songs together.

176
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,747
- Before they were married?
- Yes, sir.

177
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:19,615
They wrote the score for a show I was in,
and we became very close friends.

178
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:23,555
In fact, I think Dixie
is my very best friend.

179
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:27,685
What was the relationship between
Miss Donegan and Mr. Crane at that time?

180
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,458
Well, I'm not sure.

181
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,303
But in your opinion they seemed suited
to one another?

182
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:37,302
I thought the match
was made in heaven.

183
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:40,169
- But it didn't work out that way?
- No, sir.

184
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:44,403
I'm afraid they still make most
of the matches in Sweden.

185
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,414
Miss Marsh, please confine yourself
to less philosophical statements.

186
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:53,816
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,116
What I mean is, it was a flop.

188
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,385
In what way?

189
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:02,896
- Well...
- To sum it up definitely, Miss Marsh...

190
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:07,331
...what would say was the basic trouble
between Mr. And Mrs. Crane?

191
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,299
Why...

192
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:11,440
Why, I'd say Eddie went Park Avenue.

193
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,900
Park Avenue?

194
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:17,568
Can you explain in a little more detail
just what you mean by that?

195
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:20,607
Well, for example,
there was the night the show closed.

196
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:21,875
It had run for a year...

197
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,953
...and Dixie and Eddie were giving a big
party for the cast and all their friends.

198
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:31,149
Only it turned out to be mostly
for his friends, his new ones.

199
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,956
<i>Park Avenue was clustered around Eddie
like flies around honey.</i>

200
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,691
<i>Every phony in the phony 400.</i>

201
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:41,530
<i>On the other side of the room,
Dixie and I were sitting...</i>

202
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:44,832
<i>...and I couldn't help noticing
she was depressed.</i>

203
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,033
<i>I think everybody felt the room
was split up into two camps.</i>

204
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,271
<i>The friends who knew him when,
and those that knew him if.</i>

205
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:56,043
<i>Among his real friends
were Max Milton, his publisher.</i>

206
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:58,448
<i>He'd handled every song
the kids had written...</i>

207
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,919
<i>...and was kind of a godfather
to both of them.</i>

208
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,285
<i>And Red Willet, the song plugger.</i>

209
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,361
<i>He'd gone up with Eddie and so he put in
a special plug for all his tunes.</i>

210
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,057
<i>And with us was one of the most popular
radio singers in the country...</i>

211
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,393
<i>...Buddy Crawford.</i>

212
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:15,298
<i>We'd all known Buddy
when he was just starting out...</i>

213
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,905
<i>...and we'd watched his struggles
along with our own.</i>

214
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:21,668
<i>But he was on top now, and was always
singing every Crane and Donegan tune...</i>

215
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:23,106
<i>...he could get hold of.</i>

216
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,695
Maybe we're wrong, Red.

217
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,355
Maybe he belongs
with these hammerheads, after all.

218
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,763
It isn't that bad, Marilyn.
He's just a big kid.

219
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,836
He's found a new sand pile to play in.

220
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:52,201
Yeah, and a golden bucket.

221
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,205
Can they spare it?

222
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:59,305
I guess it's perfectly natural.
Eddie come up the hard way.

223
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,247
When I plugged his first number 10 years
ago, he didn't have a cot to sleep in.

224
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,649
You can't blame him
if he wants to eat caviar...

225
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,255
...and go to Lady Triple Chin's
house parties.

226
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:09,982
I'm thinking of Dixie.

227
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,592
It's tough on her.

228
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,161
It's like the gag: You don't run
after a streetcar once you've caught it.

229
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,789
- Marilyn, you look wonderful.
- Oh, thanks, Buddy.

230
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,694
Red, stand up a minute, will you?

231
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:24,631
Turn around.

232
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,808
Thank you.

233
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,808
Oh, I get it,
you two want me to be alone.

234
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,948
That's the general idea.
Where's your girl?

235
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:36,414
There she is, over there.
Cute kid, isn't she?

236
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:37,984
Yeah. What's her name?

237
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:40,519
- Lull.
- Lull?

238
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,987
Lull doesn't seem to be
having a very good time.

239
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:46,184
Aw, she's happy. She's eating.

240
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:50,322
Oh, a pickle for Lull. Thank you.

241
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:52,860
Hi, Lull.

242
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,128
Having a lot of fun?

243
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:05,305
You know, you're gonna ruin your appetite
if you don't stop eating between bites.

244
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,656
- Simply fabulous.
- Out of the world.

245
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,628
- Wonderful.
- I'm glad you like it because I love to play.

246
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,167
Oh, Eddie, it's been simply divine.
The whole evening.

247
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:30,931
- I'm absolutely shattered I have to go.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

248
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,939
But you will join us this weekend?
At the Lattisons'.

249
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,236
You want me to come
and bring my piano?

250
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,573
- Don't be silly.
- Eddie, how fantastic.

251
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,011
- We want you for yourself.
- That's kind of you.

252
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:44,448
I still have never been able to get
one of these things in a taxi.

253
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,781
- Maybe I can stay for just one more.
- Oh, good.

254
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,822
- Oh, please.
- Yes, come on. Just one more, huh?

255
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:54,354
Say, Dixie, wasn't it a swell party?

256
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,998
Everybody said they couldn't have had
a better time.

257
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,895
Did you meet that real live countess?

258
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:01,559
You mean the lady
with the slight mustache?

259
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:02,761
Yeah.

260
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,496
And that society columnist?

261
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,197
Oh, yes.

262
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,275
You should have heard him rave
about your tune.

263
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,741
Yeah?

264
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:11,846
He asked me
what we're gonna do next...

265
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,642
...and I told him an idea of
that number we talked about last.

266
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,842
Oh, I don't think that's so hot.

267
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,886
Oh, everybody loves a love song
in spring.

268
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:21,784
I'm sure we can get it.

269
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,118
Look, Eddie, I dare you.

270
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,659
- Lets go in and run it over right now?
- Now?

271
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,093
We've always worked any hour
of the day or night.

272
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:33,325
Oh, no, honey. I don't feel like it.
I'm not in the mood.

273
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,069
Tomorrow then?

274
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,139
Well, maybe. We'll see.

275
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:41,266
No, I just remembered.

276
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:44,435
I'm going down to the Sound
to see the Marions' new boat.

277
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,137
They certainly liked our party.

278
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,011
I got a thrill out of looking around
that room tonight.

279
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:54,121
You know something? I'll bet we had
150 million bucks right in that living room.

280
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:55,483
Uh-huh.

281
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,318
Did you see all the invitations we got?

282
00:17:57,793 --> 00:17:59,283
Twenty, I'll bet you.

283
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,162
- Did my blue suit go to the cleaners?
- Yes.

284
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,631
- When do I get my laundry?
- Tomorrow at 10:00.

285
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,895
Do you know if those brown shoes
were picked up?

286
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:10,732
The bootmaker
will have them here Friday.

287
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:14,637
We've ordered your favorite lobster and
the butler's reordered the wine you like.

288
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,801
Anything else, Eddie?

289
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,446
What's the matter?

290
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:20,343
I didn't know
you were that tired tonight.

291
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:24,509
There are a lot of things I'm tired of.

292
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:29,489
What did you mean by that?

293
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,321
Eddie...

294
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:36,020
...let's shake hands and call it quits.

295
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,396
Quits?

296
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:42,795
You see, this whole business
is your idea of fun, it isn't mine.

297
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:45,667
I think you could have
a better time alone.

298
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,103
I wanna work. I'm a worker.

299
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:51,235
I can't stand this routine
of bouncing red balloons in the air.

300
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,847
But it's your idea
of a merry-go-round, darling.

301
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,381
So you ride on it.

302
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,848
Oh, I get it.

303
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,613
My balloons, my merry-go-round.

304
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:02,689
As if you weren't having
a good time yourself.

305
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,888
If that isn't a typical feminine attitude,
always making the man the heavy.

306
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,996
Oh, let's not fight about it, Eddie.

307
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:12,099
It really only dawned on me tonight.

308
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:17,505
Maybe I ought to have my freedom.

309
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:18,697
Legally.

310
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:25,079
Well...

311
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:29,911
...you know I'd never stand in the way
of what you wanna do.

312
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,217
That's white of you, Eddie.

313
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:41,754
As long as we don't see things
the same way, what's the use of going on?

314
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:45,261
No use.

315
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,934
No use at all.

316
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,799
And we won't.

317
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,409
That's the whole story, as I pieced it
together from my own impressions...

318
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:56,100
...and the things Dixie told me.

319
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,338
As Red said, I'm afraid Eddie figured
he'd caught the streetcar...

320
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,379
...and didn't have to run anymore.

321
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,040
Hm.

322
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,220
Well, thank you, Miss Marsh.
That will be all.

323
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:09,189
Are there any other witnesses?

324
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:10,689
No, sir. My case rests.

325
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,724
Is the defendant represented in court?

326
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:15,955
No. Since there's no question
of support or property settlement...

327
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,156
...the case is not contested.

328
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,595
All right.

329
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:23,996
Well, from the evidence
we've heard today...

330
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:27,437
...we seem to have a regrettable instance
of a young man...

331
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,635
...who wasn't able to handle
his own success.

332
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,975
Even made it intolerable
for this young woman to live with him.

333
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:37,182
Funny what a little success
will do to people.

334
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:41,211
Well, much as I dislike
this divorce business...

335
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,881
...there doesn't seem to be
anything to do here.

336
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,356
There are no children.

337
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:50,226
No question of money
and certainly sufficient legal grounds.

338
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,360
Therefore, I grant this divorce.

339
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,670
Court's adjourned.

340
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,142
It's all over now, honey,
you're as free as a bird.

341
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:05,746
Thanks to you, Marilyn.

342
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:08,075
If anybody got my divorce for me,
you did.

343
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,241
We're going to my place
and celebrating.

344
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:12,148
You're swell to take me in, honey.

345
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,948
Oh, gosh, it's staring to rain.

346
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:15,987
Wouldn't it, though?
Today of all days.

347
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,887
I don't mind. It's Eddie's blue suit.

348
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,654
- He always wants it when it rains.
- Eddie's blue suit?

349
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:23,889
We'll stop at the cleaners
and make sure they send it to him.

350
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:29,003
Eddie may not have me, but he's gonna
have his darned old blue serge suit.

351
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:32,663
Gosh, I loved Eddie in that suit.

352
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:42,917
Divine.

353
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:50,049
Too divine.

354
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,726
Too, too divine.

355
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,420
Shove, dove, wove, glove...

356
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:37,697
- Hi, Dixie.
- Hello, honey.

357
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:41,063
- Working?
- Trying to, and getting nowhere but fast.

358
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:42,760
Any calls for me, darling?

359
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,998
The phone rang, but when I answered
there wasn't anyone on the wire.

360
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,870
- How are the lyrics going?
- Oh, I guess I'm upset.

361
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:52,104
This is the third fellow
I've tried to write with, and it's no use.

362
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,339
<i>But I'll find one
if I have to put an ad in Variety.</i>

363
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,311
I'll get it.

364
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:59,914
Hello? Oh, uh...

365
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:01,612
Just a minute. I'll see.

366
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,451
- It's Eddie.
- Eddie?

367
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:07,425
Now, don't be overanxious.
Play hard to get.

368
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,656
I'm afraid she's gone out.
I'll see if I can catch her.

369
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:12,959
Do something
so you'll sound out of breath.

370
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:15,262
Run around the room.

371
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:17,428
Run to the door. Go on.

372
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:25,273
Hold the wire, Eddie,
I managed to catch her.

373
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:26,914
Hello, Eddie.

374
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:29,312
I'm sorry I'm a little out of breath.

375
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:30,781
I just came in.

376
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:32,749
Marilyn caught me way down the hall.

377
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,947
I'm sorry to bother you
if you're going out.

378
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:38,686
Well, it is fairly important.

379
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,091
I was wondering if you could
run over here for few minutes.

380
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:45,728
You will? Oh, that's swell.
You're a darling.

381
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,562
I'll be right over.

382
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,933
Oh, it's something important, he said.
Marilyn, do you suppose?

383
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:52,403
Oh, gee.

384
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,532
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Dixie.

385
00:25:30,478 --> 00:25:31,638
Come on in.

386
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:33,678
Thanks.

387
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:41,579
- May I take your cape?
- Oh, yes.

388
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:44,748
I can't stay long,
people are waiting, you know?

389
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:49,625
Oh, sure, sure. As a matter of fact,
I expect some people by here pretty soon.

390
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:53,865
- Won't you sit down?
- Oh, thanks.

391
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:58,301
Oh, uh, cigarette?

392
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,644
- It's empty.
- Oh.

393
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:17,623
Well, never mind,
I just finished one in the cab.

394
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:20,424
Well...

395
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:22,187
...how are things, Eddie?

396
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:24,559
Oh, fine, fine.
I've been pretty busy lately.

397
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,257
Oh, you've been writing?

398
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:28,459
No. Been moving around a lot, though.

399
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:31,629
- You know, parties and stuff.
- Oh.

400
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:36,168
I was down at the Lessmores' yesterday
on Long Island. I had a swell time.

401
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,504
I bet you did.

402
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,579
Well, what about you?

403
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:43,843
- Have you been working?
- Me? Oh, sure.

404
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,113
You know me. The sewing machine kid.

405
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:51,755
- Well, is it good?
- Oh, swell, I think.

406
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:55,521
I found a new writer just the other day.
He seems to work out fine.

407
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,995
Oh, I'm glad.

408
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,765
You wanted to see me, Eddie?

409
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:04,097
Yeah.

410
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:05,705
You see...

411
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,308
...it's like this, Dixie.

412
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:12,739
I guess I'm not as smart
as I thought I was.

413
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:14,176
Oh?

414
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:19,616
No. I found out that living alone
isn't quite what it's cracked up to be.

415
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:23,952
I used to be able to find everything.
Socks and shirts and neckties.

416
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:28,323
At least they were put where I could
kind of dive into them like a fireman.

417
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:29,895
Yes, Eddie?

418
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,466
Well, the truth is, Dixie, that...

419
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,536
Well, it takes a woman to run things.

420
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:38,400
Yes, Eddie?

421
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,633
And now those crumbs
have walked out on me.

422
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,970
What crumbs?

423
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:45,135
The servants. They took a powder.

424
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,242
I don't know where anything is.
Even how to hire new ones.

425
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,976
That's why I phoned you.
I thought you'd give me a hand.

426
00:27:51,152 --> 00:27:52,449
You thought that...?

427
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,747
If it wasn't too much trouble,
you could...

428
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,754
Well, you know, tell me what to do.

429
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,725
You mean you brought me over here to tell
you how to call up an employment agency?

430
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:03,090
- I didn't. You volunteered.
- Are you implying...?

431
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,631
I'm not implying anything except
I don't know how to run an apartment.

432
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:09,429
I gave them a vacation.
They walked in, walked out on me.

433
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,539
- They didn't even give me notice.
- Probably couldn't find you.

434
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:14,299
Look at this apartment.

435
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,171
And that dust and those ashes.

436
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:18,642
And look at that piano.

437
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:21,341
I'm admitting it.
All I need's a little advice.

438
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:24,280
- All you need is advice.
- Oh, I'm getting along swell.

439
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,818
You sound as though
you're feeling sorry for yourself.

440
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:28,853
You always were a sentimentalist,
my boy.

441
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:32,049
- That's why you were a great songwriter.
- What do you mean "were"?

442
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:35,754
Just that. You haven't written a thing
since you had an empty stomach.

443
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,557
"Were," indeed.

444
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:40,098
- What's this? One of your shirts?
- I don't know.

445
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:42,634
Go on, open it up.

446
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,563
A dust cloth.
Come on, open it again.

447
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,265
Oh.

448
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:51,038
Hey, don't throw that away.
It's a new tune.

449
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:53,544
New? It's been hanging around here
for over a year.

450
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,444
I know, but I was
gonna work on it tomorrow.

451
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:57,414
Oh, yeah, manana.

452
00:28:57,585 --> 00:28:59,780
Don't throw away anything
with notes on it.

453
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:02,320
- It might go down in history.
- Mm-hm.

454
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,958
You and Beethoven.

455
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,768
Say, that's not bad.

456
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:45,030
What's that?
I never heard that part before.

457
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,828
- What?
- The middle.

458
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:49,026
When did you write it?

459
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,798
Quiet. I'm trying to get it now.

460
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,060
- Start it again.
- Huh?

461
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,929
From the beginning. I got an idea.

462
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:23,002
Okay.

463
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,375
Play the first four bars again.

464
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:38,576
Play it again, Eddie.
Just the last two bars.

465
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,085
That did it, brother.

466
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,887
- You finished?
- Yeah. Wanna hear it?

467
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:57,862
Of course. I hope the last part's
as good as the first.

468
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:11,569
<i>My music couldn't compare
With Liszt's or Schumann's</i>

469
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:13,873
<i>Or gifted humans</i>

470
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:18,781
<i>Like Irving Berlin and Jerry Kern</i>

471
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:23,817
<i>My lyrics aren't in a class
With Ira Gershwin</i>

472
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:26,256
<i>From Ira Gershwin</i>

473
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:30,090
<i>I've lots to learn</i>

474
00:32:30,264 --> 00:32:32,289
<i>If our talents we combined</i>

475
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,765
<i>I think they might agree</i>

476
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:38,030
<i>You mean, I'd bring out the Kern in you</i>

477
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:43,041
<i>And you'd bring out the Gershwin in me</i>

478
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,475
<i>Could be</i>

479
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:50,016
<i>Could be</i>

480
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,351
<i>Your words</i>

481
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:57,980
<i>And my music</i>

482
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:05,156
<i>Could make such a beautiful song</i>

483
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:11,394
<i>A simple chorus as warm as the spring</i>

484
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:15,167
<i>We'll get our big thrill</i>

485
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:16,935
<i>When we hear</i>

486
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:21,775
<i>Everyone singing</i>

487
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,884
<i>Your words</i>

488
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:28,545
<i>And my music</i>

489
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:35,720
<i>And although its theme may be worn</i>

490
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,391
<i>With your words</i>

491
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:47,269
<i>And my music</i>

492
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:54,439
<i>A wonderful love song</i>

493
00:33:55,116 --> 00:34:02,113
<i>Is born</i>

494
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:05,825
It's perfect, darling.

495
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:08,894
- You sure it doesn't sound forced?
- No. It's right on the nose.

496
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:12,123
Plenty of sentiment.
It's exactly what the tune means to me.

497
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,360
- Oh, I think it's swell, honey.
- I'm glad.

498
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:18,664
There's just this one little part
in the bass here.

499
00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:26,410
- Eddie.
- Huh?

500
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:28,913
I'm dead. I'm gonna call it a night.

501
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:32,211
All right, honey.
When we get up we'll listen to it again.

502
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:35,412
Okay, that's a good idea.

503
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,080
Night, darling.

504
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:39,021
Night.

505
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:44,796
You know, honey, I think this is...

506
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,014
You know, Dixie, I think that's the most
commercial tune we've ever written.

507
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,880
Mm-hm.

508
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:08,613
Say, you don't look very comfortable.

509
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:12,149
Hey, wake up and go to sleep.

510
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:15,056
Oh, yeah.

511
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,826
Tired.

512
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:29,265
- Eddie.
- Hm?

513
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:32,901
- Zip, will you?
- Oh.

514
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:41,947
Thanks.

515
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,889
What's the matter?

516
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,797
Oh, dear.

517
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:01,536
- Hey, where are you going?
- I don't live here anymore.

518
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,700
Gee, my beads.

519
00:36:03,878 --> 00:36:05,846
Well, if...

520
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:07,708
Sorry, my mistake.

521
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:20,153
It gets worse every year.

522
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:21,352
What happened to you?

523
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:25,021
Oh, I got out of one those new cabs.
I forgot there was no running board.

524
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,291
- No what?
- Running board.

525
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,163
I got out in a hurry and it wasn't there...

526
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:33,462
- If I find a lawyer, I'm gonna sue the guy.
- Take it easy, Red.

527
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,440
Hi, Buddy... Oh, I'm sorry.

528
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,174
You look just like Buddy Crawford.
Better watch that.

529
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:47,312
- Hi, Buddy.
- Hello, Red.

530
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,115
- Have you heard it yet?
- Heard what?

531
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,918
Eddie and Dixie wrote a new tune.
And is it terrific.

532
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:53,754
What do you know?
When can I hear it?

533
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:56,761
Well, I'll sing it for you right now.

534
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:58,899
Calling Mr. Crawford.

535
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:00,055
Did that come out of me?

536
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:04,269
Calling Mr. Crawford.
- Here you are, fellow.

537
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:06,668
You got me off-key there.

538
00:37:08,509 --> 00:37:10,340
- Is she on the phone?
- Yes. Booth 3.

539
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:13,571
- I'll handle it. I'll tell her you're out of town.
- I'll handle it.

540
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:15,978
Well, how about the new song?

541
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:24,156
- Hello, Dixie.
- Hello, Buddy, how are you?

542
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,419
Yes, the former Mrs. Crane speaking.

543
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,995
I got your flowers this morning,
they're beautiful.

544
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,893
You wouldn't be kidding me,
would you?

545
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:35,558
Kidding on the square. Now that you're back
in circulation, how about giving me a break?

546
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:40,298
- What are you doing the next two months?
- Oh, take it easy. Take it easy.

547
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:44,240
Buddy, I'm in Max Milton's office
and we want you to come over...

548
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:46,573
...to hear a new song
Eddie and I have written.

549
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:49,307
Yes, congratulations.
Joe was just telling me.

550
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:52,213
I'd love you to sing it for me.
In fact, I'd love you. Period.

551
00:37:57,825 --> 00:37:59,520
Hi, Red.

552
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,356
Oh, hello, Eddie.
Say, I've been plugging your new song.

553
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,590
- How's it going? Do people like it?
- Nuts about it. I sang it for Buddy.

554
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:08,394
He raved. He wants to
use it on the air right away.

555
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:10,696
That's nice of him.
He'll do a great job on it.

556
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,896
- Sell a lot of copies.
- Yeah.

557
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:15,508
I was just thinking,
too bad you and Dixie split out.

558
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:18,702
We'll have to send the royalties
in two checks, huh?

559
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,780
- Yeah.
- I guess you don't feel too hot about it.

560
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:26,010
- Oh, forget it. I don't like to talk about it.
- Yeah, that's the way it goes.

561
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:29,850
When love flies out the window,
it always leaves a scar.

562
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:33,251
I guess you don't feel too good,
do you, kid?

563
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:36,221
I mean, Dixie's so marvelous.

564
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,958
Well, of course, it's none of my business,
but you look terrible.

565
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:43,262
- I guess she gave you the air, huh?
- Why, we're still the best of friends.

566
00:38:43,437 --> 00:38:47,203
- Uh-oh. That's a sure sign it's off for keeps.
- Oh, shut up, will you?

567
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,639
Well, you don't have to get sore.

568
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,747
- What's the matter, Eddie?
- Where's Buddy?

569
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:59,045
He's over there making a phone call.
Guy brought a note in for...

570
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:03,317
Hey, Crawford.

571
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,550
- Hello, Eddie.
- I wanna see you, you...

572
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:06,920
- Why, you sound mad.
- I am.

573
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,322
- At me?
- Yes, you, you...

574
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:10,487
- You heel.
- Why, Eddie, what's eating you?

575
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:12,655
- I figured you might be the guy.
- What guy?

576
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,164
The snake in the grass.

577
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,667
- Aren't you being just a little silly?
- I am, am I?

578
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:18,600
- How would you like a punch?
- For what?

579
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,435
- For trying to chisel in on my wife.
- Oh, use your head.

580
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,167
Yeah. You haven't got a wife.

581
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:25,869
- You were talking to her on the phone.
- About business.

582
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:28,447
Don't kid me. What business
would she have with you?

583
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,914
Well, now, you'd be surprised.

584
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:34,752
Oh, I would? Why, I'll...

585
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:37,186
- You dope. Think of his public.
- Get out of here.

586
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:38,950
- I know what I'm doing.
- Look.

587
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,026
- Dixie wrote a new song.
- We wrote a new song.

588
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:42,253
Did you hear that? We.

589
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,694
I don't care how many
of you wrote the song.

590
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:45,957
Dixie wants me to sing it.

591
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,294
"Your Words And My Music"
is one song you'll never sing.

592
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,561
- Yes, I will.
- You won't.

593
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:51,762
Say, this is a new angle
in song plugging.

594
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:53,930
If Dixie wants me to sing it,
I'm gonna sing it.

595
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:56,201
You do, and I'll knock it
back in your teeth.

596
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,337
Hey, Buddy.

597
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:02,312
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

598
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:06,419
...I would like to sing for the first time,
a song written by Miss Dixie Donegan...

599
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:07,918
...and Mr. Eddie Crane.

600
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:13,553
It's always a pleasure
to introduce any song of theirs...

601
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:16,992
...especially since my very lovely
little friend Miss Dixie Donegan...

602
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,563
...is our guest here tonight.

603
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,699
Well, how do you like that?

604
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:33,108
You ought to take a poke
at that guy.

605
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:40,119
You can't tell me she's not stuck on him.

606
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:41,686
I'm not trying to.

607
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:46,387
<i>Your words</i>

608
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,792
<i>And my music</i>

609
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:57,370
<i>Could make such a beautiful song</i>

610
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:01,673
<i>A simple chorus</i>

611
00:41:01,842 --> 00:41:04,640
<i>As warm as the spring</i>

612
00:41:04,812 --> 00:41:09,146
<i>We'll get our big thrill</i>

613
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:14,015
<i>When we hear everyone singing</i>

614
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:17,688
<i>Your words</i>

615
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:21,988
<i>And my music</i>

616
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:29,160
<i>And although its theme may be worn</i>

617
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,837
<i>With your words</i>

618
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:38,843
<i>And my music</i>

619
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:44,713
<i>A wonderful love song</i>

620
00:41:44,885 --> 00:41:49,185
<i>Is born</i>

621
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:52,319
Boy, when he sings like that
I gotta forgive him.

622
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:53,551
Yeah.

623
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:56,924
You can't blame Dixie for falling for him.

624
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:09,364
<i>With your words</i>

625
00:42:09,543 --> 00:42:15,004
<i>And my music</i>

626
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:20,711
<i>A wonderful love song</i>

627
00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:27,885
<i>Is born</i>

628
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,670
That's fine, Mr. Crawford.

629
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:47,841
You can now go over and sit
with the very lovely Miss Donegan.

630
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,744
Eddie, why don't you go to bed
and get a good night's sleep?

631
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,547
Sleep? Are you kidding?

632
00:42:54,722 --> 00:42:57,589
Well, then let's go out someplace
where we can get a drink.

633
00:42:57,758 --> 00:42:59,658
No.

634
00:43:02,896 --> 00:43:05,797
Oh, don't take it so tough, kid.

635
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:08,568
Suppose they do get married.

636
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:11,029
There's always a chance
they won't get along.

637
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:13,571
Look at your own case.

638
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:30,019
<i>Your words</i>

639
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,155
<i>My music</i>

640
00:43:33,427 --> 00:43:39,855
<i>Could make a beautiful song</i>

641
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,696
<i>A simple chorus</i>

642
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,838
<i>Warm as the spring</i>

643
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:49,567
<i>We'll get our big thrill</i>

644
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:53,304
<i>We'll get our big thrill
When we hear everybody singing</i>

645
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:54,978
<i>Your words</i>

646
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:59,713
<i>My music</i>

647
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:06,153
<i>And though its theme may be worn</i>

648
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,086
<i>Your words</i>

649
00:44:09,963 --> 00:44:13,160
<i>Your words and my music</i>

650
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,492
I wonder where I parked my car.

651
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,305
<i>Your words</i>

652
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:24,236
<i>My tune</i>

653
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:30,480
<i>Such a lovely love song is born</i>

654
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:34,451
<i>Is born</i>

655
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:51,201
Hello, Lull.

656
00:44:51,372 --> 00:44:54,205
Gee, I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Hello, chums.

657
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:56,502
- Hello.
- I just caught you on the air, Buddy.

658
00:44:56,677 --> 00:44:58,770
- No kidding, you were terrific.
- Gee, thanks.

659
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,914
- Even Eddie had to admit it.
- Well.

660
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:03,208
- Eddie?
- We were listening up at his place.

661
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:06,512
- Why didn't you bring him along?
- I tried to, but he was too tired.

662
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,554
He'd rather stay home all night
over a hot torch.

663
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:10,849
I never saw such a guy.

664
00:45:11,024 --> 00:45:13,788
The minute he heard you were
with Buddy, he starts to burn.

665
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,987
Oh, but this is strictly business,
Buddy's our salesman.

666
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:20,496
Don't give me that old
"business" business.

667
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:22,032
Say, Red.
- Yes?

668
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:25,530
Why don't you open that little door
and fly back into the clock?

669
00:45:25,873 --> 00:45:27,306
Open what door?

670
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,499
What clock?

671
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:32,873
Oh. Yeah.

672
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:37,813
Well, what are you in hysterics about?

673
00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:40,478
Good evening, Mr. Crane.

674
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,384
- Where's Miss Donegan's table?
- Oh, she's right over there.

675
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:45,582
Thanks.

676
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:55,265
Hello.

677
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:57,870
Well, as I live and breathe, it's Torchy.

678
00:45:58,038 --> 00:45:59,062
Hello, Eddie.

679
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:01,639
Why, Eddie, Red said you'd gone to bed.

680
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:04,972
Oh, yeah. Well, I just went
down to the corner to get a paper...

681
00:46:05,145 --> 00:46:07,670
...and on the way back,
I saw the lights burning...

682
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,749
...so I thought I'd drop in.

683
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:14,778
- Well, sit down.
- Thanks.

684
00:46:22,095 --> 00:46:25,292
Eddie, I'm sorry
about the misunderstanding at the club.

685
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:27,263
It wasn't any misunderstanding.

686
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:31,029
I just have to be careful about my hands
on account of playing the piano.

687
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,503
- Well, what happened?
- Oh, it wasn't anything.

688
00:46:33,674 --> 00:46:34,834
Just a little argument.

689
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:37,203
Eddie went out
and left Buddy standing there.

690
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,106
Dixie, I wanna talk to you.

691
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:43,909
Well, all right.

692
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:46,848
No, I mean, alone.

693
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,545
Well, I'll just send everybody home,
huh?

694
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,088
No, Dixie, I'm in earnest.

695
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:55,160
Well, I'm in a party,
so you'll just have to wait.

696
00:46:57,097 --> 00:46:59,065
This steak big enough, sir?

697
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,394
Well, just a moment.

698
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,128
Would you try that for size?

699
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:05,733
- Bring two of those.
- Two?

700
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,739
Yeah, one for me
and another one for her.

701
00:47:11,678 --> 00:47:14,806
Now I'd like to present,
for the first time at the Club Sirocco...

702
00:47:14,982 --> 00:47:18,247
...three solid citizens
who are definitely out of this world.

703
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,649
And at all times,
they are really cooking with gas.

704
00:47:21,822 --> 00:47:25,690
Ladies and gentlemen, the Berry Brothers.

705
00:47:45,712 --> 00:47:48,613
<i>Ah</i>

706
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:54,448
<i>You'll never know
If an apple is ripe</i>

707
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,350
<i>Till you bite it</i>

708
00:47:56,523 --> 00:47:57,615
<i>You bite it</i>

709
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,822
<i>Whoa</i>

710
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:06,694
<i>You'll never know
If fire's going to burn</i>

711
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:08,266
<i>Till you light it</i>

712
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:09,732
<i>You light it</i>

713
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:12,133
<i>You strike a match and light it</i>

714
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:18,006
<i>Say, you'll never know
What it means to be blue</i>

715
00:48:18,178 --> 00:48:21,909
<i>Till you've lost an old friend</i>

716
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:29,082
<i>You'll never know
Just how long is the road</i>

717
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:31,190
<i>Till you've reached</i>

718
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:34,117
<i>The</i>

719
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,229
<i>Until</i>

720
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,759
<i>You've</i>

721
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:41,298
<i>Reached the end</i>

722
00:48:41,602 --> 00:48:47,939
<i>You'll never, never know
That you've got a friend</i>

723
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:52,568
<i>You'll never know
How good a book is</i>

724
00:48:52,746 --> 00:48:54,407
<i>Till you read it</i>

725
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:59,177
<i>You really, really do, yeah</i>

726
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,521
<i>You'll never know
What a kind word can do</i>

727
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,057
<i>Till you said it
You need to say it</i>

728
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:08,524
<i>But if you say it</i>

729
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:15,763
<i>You and I could find romance</i>

730
00:49:16,003 --> 00:49:21,464
<i>But, honey
Till you take that chance</i>

731
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,734
<i>You'll never, never, never ever</i>

732
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:27,846
<i>No, you'll never ever, never</i>

733
00:49:28,415 --> 00:49:33,876
<i>Never ever, ever
Never know</i>

734
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,934
If you can spare me for a moment,
I'll dance with Marilyn.

735
00:49:53,106 --> 00:49:55,233
Why, certainly, Buddy.

736
00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:03,079
Dixie, let's get out of here.

737
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,615
Well, I can't leave now.

738
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:06,753
- Why not?
- Because I came with Buddy.

739
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,581
I can't be rude to him.

740
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,586
Well, I can and it would be a pleasure.

741
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,555
Oh, Eddie, you're a big boy now.

742
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:16,218
I'm big enough to know
that Buddy's not to blame.

743
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:17,954
You're not being very pleasant.

744
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:20,599
I'm beginning to realize
what's really cooking.

745
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:24,203
- What do you mean?
- You're chasing after him.

746
00:50:24,805 --> 00:50:26,534
Never a dull moment, I often say.

747
00:50:26,707 --> 00:50:29,335
And what's more, if that's
what you want, you got it.

748
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:31,443
But count me out.

749
00:50:48,195 --> 00:50:49,628
Hello, darling.

750
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:51,421
Oh, hello, Marilyn.

751
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:54,066
Hello, Eddie. Come in.

752
00:50:54,568 --> 00:50:56,399
What, more flowers?

753
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,936
- Well, I...
- Say, I could choke you.

754
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:02,439
I've done nothing all day
but unwrap these flowers, and all for Dixie.

755
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:04,076
You know, I live here too.

756
00:51:04,244 --> 00:51:07,179
You could have at least sent me
a piece of lettuce or something.

757
00:51:07,347 --> 00:51:08,837
Oh, I'm sorry, Marilyn.

758
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:11,745
Gee, they look kind of lost in here,
at that.

759
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:13,249
If you'd been on your toes...

760
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,516
...you would have ordered a nice big
weeping willow for the middle of the room.

761
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:21,323
- I thought Dixie was gonna be here.
- She should be here any moment now.

762
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,690
A breakfast date at 11,
luncheon date at 12.

763
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:25,923
Oh, breakfast and luncheon, huh?

764
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:29,967
You think she could sandwich me in
around tea time? Just between crumpets?

765
00:51:30,137 --> 00:51:33,800
Oh, I think so, Eddie.
She hasn't planned anything till dinner.

766
00:51:33,974 --> 00:51:35,874
I hope she wasn't sore about last night.

767
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:40,069
I didn't mean to crash your party at the club
but I wanted to tell her something and...

768
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:42,477
Well, I guess I kind of lost my temper.

769
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:43,741
Is she very mad at me?

770
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:46,886
I don't think she gave it another thought.

771
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,618
I'm terribly relieved.

772
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,617
Hello, baby.

773
00:51:53,493 --> 00:51:55,256
Gee, are the flowers still coming?

774
00:51:55,428 --> 00:51:56,918
- Hello.
- Hello, Dixie.

775
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:58,564
I'm sorry to be late, Eddie.

776
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:00,097
Darling, any calls for me?

777
00:52:00,267 --> 00:52:02,428
Yeah, phone's been jangling
like an ambulance.

778
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:05,730
- The messages are on your table.
- Oh, I'll have to phone back later.

779
00:52:05,906 --> 00:52:07,373
You wanted to work, didn't you?

780
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,203
- I certainly do.
- Well, I'll hold everybody off.

781
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,244
We have to be ready early tonight.
We're going to Westchester.

782
00:52:13,413 --> 00:52:16,678
I'll jump right in the tub with the lilacs.

783
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,577
Eddie, the flowers are beautiful.

784
00:52:21,755 --> 00:52:23,882
I feel kind of silly getting so many.

785
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,457
Didn't you feel kind of silly
sending them?

786
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:29,117
No, I felt all right.

787
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:30,991
Here's a little garnish on the side.

788
00:52:31,164 --> 00:52:32,756
More?

789
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:35,367
Oh, and another one.

790
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:38,897
Oh. It's from Buddy.

791
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,836
Now, isn't that sweet?

792
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:45,705
- Say, Dixie, about last night...
- Let's not talk about last night, Eddie.

793
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:47,506
No personalities between us.

794
00:52:47,681 --> 00:52:50,445
I didn't mean that.
I meant that melody I was talking about.

795
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:54,713
I got a hunch if we get steamed up now
we can knock this town dead.

796
00:52:54,888 --> 00:52:56,913
- Really?
- Sure. Only we gotta work more.

797
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,114
We gotta work harder.

798
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,657
We gotta work mornings,
afternoons, evenings.

799
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:02,658
Work, work, work till we get it.

800
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:05,320
Oh, you can do it, Dixie.
You write wonderful lyrics.

801
00:53:05,498 --> 00:53:07,363
Why, as a team, we could be tops.

802
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:11,300
If we get to winging we could write
the words and music to that Hopkins show.

803
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:13,371
Now, how would you like that?

804
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:16,600
- Oh, it's a pretty tough assignment.
- Oh, that's no way to talk.

805
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,711
A couple of more hits and we'll be a cinch.
Nothing's too tough.

806
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,747
- I'm busy. I've got a dinner date tonight.
- Cancel it.

807
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:27,910
Doesn't a career mean anything to a gal
with talent like you got? Come on, Dixie.

808
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:29,578
Get out that old hanky.

809
00:53:29,756 --> 00:53:32,884
Here. Here's the way it starts.

810
00:53:38,098 --> 00:53:39,827
Oh, Eddie, I don't feel like it.

811
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,058
I'm not in the mood.

812
00:53:41,234 --> 00:53:43,600
Oh, you can do it, kid.
Get in there and slug.

813
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,500
Come on, Dixie. Make with
those good old Donegan words.

814
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:49,073
Well, I'll try. Play it over again.

815
00:53:49,242 --> 00:53:52,268
Attagirl, baby, turn on the heat.

816
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,783
<i>My one and only
I am so lonely</i>

817
00:54:02,022 --> 00:54:04,923
<i>I can't believe that it's really you</i>

818
00:54:05,091 --> 00:54:07,150
<i>Somehow it's just too good to be true</i>

819
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:12,298
<i>You are the sweetest
You are so lovely</i>

820
00:54:12,465 --> 00:54:14,399
<i>So sweet and lovely</i>

821
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,233
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely</i>

822
00:54:16,403 --> 00:54:19,031
Hey. "Oh, sweet and lovely. "

823
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,467
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely
Can it be true</i>

824
00:54:22,642 --> 00:54:23,973
<i>You are the one</i>

825
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:26,042
<i>Baby, be mine</i>

826
00:54:26,212 --> 00:54:27,839
Baby, be mine.

827
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,915
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely
Baby, be mine</i>

828
00:54:31,584 --> 00:54:33,142
<i>Baby, be good</i>

829
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,719
<i>Lady, be good</i>

830
00:54:34,888 --> 00:54:36,412
That's it. "Lady, be good. "

831
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:39,080
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good</i>

832
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:41,159
Yeah.

833
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:46,026
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good</i>

834
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,794
<i>Oh, lady, be good to me</i>

835
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,767
How's that?

836
00:54:51,938 --> 00:54:56,898
<i>I am so awfully misunderstood</i>

837
00:54:57,077 --> 00:55:02,174
<i>So, lady, be good to me</i>

838
00:55:02,749 --> 00:55:07,618
<i>Oh, I don't know what to say now</i>

839
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:14,351
<i>Oh, please have some pity</i>

840
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:17,121
Pity, pity, pity. What rhymes with pity?

841
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,827
Kitty, ditty, witty, city.

842
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,160
City.

843
00:55:21,334 --> 00:55:26,601
<i>Oh, please have some pity</i>

844
00:55:26,773 --> 00:55:31,176
<i>I'm all alone in this big city</i>

845
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:34,575
Wait a minute.
I got myself all alone now.

846
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:40,744
<i>I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood</i>

847
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,688
<i>So lady, be good to me</i>

848
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,953
- Oh, honey, that's swell.
- You think so?

849
00:55:49,129 --> 00:55:51,154
Lt'll be a smash.
Wait till Max hears this.

850
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:55,563
Yeah. When he hears it, he'll take out
his cigar, flip off the ashes and say:

851
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:59,933
"Well, kids, if I'm any judge,
I think we got a hit in our hands. "

852
00:56:01,341 --> 00:56:02,399
I hope so.

853
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:11,650
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good</i>

854
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:16,187
<i>Oh, lady, be good to me</i>

855
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:19,481
<i>- I am so awfully...
- Misunderstood.</i>

856
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:20,683
<i>Misunderstood</i>

857
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,489
<i>So, lady, be good to me</i>

858
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:29,425
<i>Oh, please have some pity</i>

859
00:56:30,003 --> 00:56:33,097
<i>I'm all alone in this big city</i>

860
00:56:33,273 --> 00:56:37,767
<i>I tell you, I'm just a lonesome
Babe in the wood</i>

861
00:56:37,944 --> 00:56:42,938
<i>So, lady, be good to me</i>

862
00:56:43,283 --> 00:56:44,443
- Well?
- Well?

863
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:49,054
Well, kids, if I'm any judge,
I think we've got a hit on our hands.

864
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,655
Get me an arranger.

865
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,402
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely</i>

866
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,441
<i>Lady, be very good</i>

867
00:58:23,183 --> 00:58:25,447
<i>To me</i>

868
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:33,282
<i>Oh, please have some pity</i>

869
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:37,061
<i>I'm all alone in this big city</i>

870
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:53,369
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good</i>

871
00:58:53,546 --> 00:58:58,313
<i>Oh, lady, be good to me</i>

872
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:02,079
<i>I am so awfully misunderstood</i>

873
00:59:02,255 --> 00:59:06,954
<i>So, lady, be good to me</i>

874
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:11,529
<i>Oh, please have some pity</i>

875
00:59:11,764 --> 00:59:15,530
<i>I'm all alone in this big city</i>

876
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:19,601
<i>I'm just a lonesome
Babe in the wood</i>

877
00:59:19,772 --> 00:59:24,072
<i>So, lady, be good to me</i>

878
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:49,425
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good</i>

879
00:59:49,602 --> 00:59:54,039
<i>Oh, lady, be good to me</i>

880
00:59:58,378 --> 01:00:01,677
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good, be good</i>

881
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,408
<i>Oh, be good to me</i>

882
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:23,669
<i>Oh, me bambina, please-a be good</i>

883
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:31,002
<i>Oh, hot potato, you gotta be good</i>

884
01:00:34,747 --> 01:00:38,046
<i>Oh, dark and handsome
Won't you be good?</i>

885
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,099
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

886
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:01,706
<i>...number one on your hit parade...</i>

887
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:05,173
<i>...for the 10th consecutive week,
"Lady Be Good. "</i>

888
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:37,805
Fellow members and guests.

889
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:41,743
Obviously, this is not an official meeting
of our organization.

890
01:01:41,914 --> 01:01:43,609
The food was too good.

891
01:01:45,184 --> 01:01:47,379
Every once in a while
we can meet unofficially...

892
01:01:47,553 --> 01:01:51,785
...without discussing songwriting
or the problems of song publishing.

893
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,189
I might say we are forced
to meet socially at times.

894
01:01:55,361 --> 01:01:57,261
Now, don't get me wrong.

895
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:01,867
I mean that one of our members,
or perhaps two, as is the case tonight...

896
01:02:02,034 --> 01:02:05,765
...have distinguished themselves so it
is impossible for us to ignore the fact...

897
01:02:05,938 --> 01:02:09,738
...that a proper tribute is due to them
and should be paid.

898
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,807
On these occasions in the past,
we've honored such beloved members...

899
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:19,213
...as Victor Herbert, George Gershwin,
Oscar Hammerstein, and Jerome Kern.

900
01:02:23,122 --> 01:02:26,751
This is our opportunity to show
our appreciation to these members...

901
01:02:26,926 --> 01:02:30,089
...who've helped make the
Songwriters and Publishers Association...

902
01:02:30,263 --> 01:02:34,063
...the truly great organization it is.

903
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,701
A few months ago, an established
songwriting team decided to split up.

904
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:40,600
In the vernacular of Tin Pan Alley...

905
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:43,503
...the perfect wedding of words
and music were divorced.

906
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:46,708
But I'm sure that all of you
share my happiness...

907
01:02:46,879 --> 01:02:51,976
...in knowing that Dixie Donegan and
Eddie Crane are working together again.

908
01:02:52,151 --> 01:02:56,087
And once more they've written themselves
to the very pinnacle of our profession.

909
01:02:56,722 --> 01:03:02,058
Whatever else has happened
is none of my business or yours.

910
01:03:02,328 --> 01:03:06,264
What matters to us is that they've given
the world another great song.

911
01:03:06,432 --> 01:03:09,424
And when you hear Dixie sing it,
I think you'll feel as I do:

912
01:03:09,602 --> 01:03:12,867
That this isn't just another work
by two songwriters.

913
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,975
It's as if they had
a hundred million collaborators.

914
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:19,441
The Americans who feel in their hearts...

915
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:23,048
...what Eddie and Dixie have written
so beautifully in their song.

916
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:27,414
I refer to the tender and affectionate
salute to a lost city...

917
01:03:27,587 --> 01:03:30,351
..."The Last Time I Saw Paris. "

918
01:03:58,618 --> 01:04:05,456
<i>A lady known as Paris
Romantic and charming</i>

919
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,560
<i>Has left her old companions</i>

920
01:04:08,728 --> 01:04:13,062
<i>And faded from view</i>

921
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:20,596
<i>Lonely men with lonely eyes
Are seeking her in vain</i>

922
01:04:22,508 --> 01:04:26,103
<i>Her streets are where they were</i>

923
01:04:26,345 --> 01:04:31,874
<i>But there's no sign of her</i>

924
01:04:32,218 --> 01:04:36,518
<i>She has left</i>

925
01:04:36,756 --> 01:04:41,819
<i>The Seine</i>

926
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,662
<i>The last time I saw Paris</i>

927
01:04:45,831 --> 01:04:49,267
<i>Her heart was warm and gay</i>

928
01:04:49,435 --> 01:04:52,802
<i>I heard the laughter of her heart</i>

929
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,339
<i>In every street caf</i>

930
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:59,535
<i>The last time saw Paris</i>

931
01:04:59,712 --> 01:05:03,113
<i>Her trees were dressed for spring</i>

932
01:05:03,282 --> 01:05:06,740
<i>And lovers walked beneath those trees</i>

933
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:10,946
<i>And birds found songs to sing</i>

934
01:05:11,123 --> 01:05:14,354
<i>I dodged the same old taxicabs</i>

935
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:17,462
<i>That I had dodged for years</i>

936
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:20,929
<i>The chorus of their squeaky horns</i>

937
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:26,970
<i>Was music to my ears</i>

938
01:05:27,306 --> 01:05:30,901
<i>The last time I saw Paris</i>

939
01:05:31,077 --> 01:05:34,513
<i>Her heart was warm and gay</i>

940
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:41,677
<i>No matter how they change her</i>

941
01:05:42,421 --> 01:05:47,484
<i>I'll remember her</i>

942
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:53,394
<i>That way</i>

943
01:06:00,606 --> 01:06:04,098
<i>I'll think of happy hours</i>

944
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:08,474
<i>And people who shared them</i>

945
01:06:08,848 --> 01:06:12,944
<i>Old women selling flowers</i>

946
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,886
<i>In markets at dawn</i>

947
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:25,221
<i>Children who applauded Punch and Judy
In the park</i>

948
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:31,095
<i>And those who danced at night</i>

949
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:37,998
<i>And kept our Paris bright</i>

950
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:43,039
<i>Till the town</i>

951
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:48,350
<i>Went dark</i>

952
01:06:49,622 --> 01:06:53,718
<i>The last time I saw Paris</i>

953
01:06:53,893 --> 01:06:57,192
<i>Her heart was warm and gay</i>

954
01:06:57,363 --> 01:07:00,560
<i>I heard the laughter of her heart</i>

955
01:07:00,733 --> 01:07:03,998
<i>In every street caf</i>

956
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:07,105
<i>The last time I saw Paris</i>

957
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:10,538
<i>Her trees were dressed for spring</i>

958
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:14,077
<i>And lovers walked beneath those trees</i>

959
01:07:14,246 --> 01:07:19,616
<i>And birds found songs to sing</i>

960
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:22,980
<i>I dodged the same old taxicabs</i>

961
01:07:23,155 --> 01:07:26,124
<i>That I had dodged for years</i>

962
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:31,127
<i>The chorus of their squeaky horns</i>

963
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:38,461
<i>Was music to my ears</i>

964
01:07:40,706 --> 01:07:45,234
<i>The last time I saw Paris</i>

965
01:07:45,411 --> 01:07:50,041
<i>Her heart was warm and gay</i>

966
01:07:50,216 --> 01:07:53,549
<i>No matter how</i>

967
01:07:53,719 --> 01:08:00,716
<i>They change her</i>

968
01:08:03,129 --> 01:08:08,761
<i>I'll remember her</i>

969
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:17,507
<i>That way</i>

970
01:08:27,419 --> 01:08:32,083
- Oh, gee. That was terrific, wasn't it?
- Mm-hm.

971
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,384
We've come a long way
from Tin Pan Alley, honey.

972
01:08:36,562 --> 01:08:37,893
Funny.

973
01:08:38,063 --> 01:08:40,896
I was remembering too.

974
01:08:42,635 --> 01:08:45,604
That was a swell speech
that Max made about us, wasn't it?

975
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:47,432
Wonderful.

976
01:08:47,606 --> 01:08:49,972
"The perfect wedding of words
and music," he said.

977
01:08:50,142 --> 01:08:52,872
- Remember?
- Mm-hm.

978
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:57,210
Oh, Dixie, why can't we make it
a real wedding again?

979
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,248
Can't we?

980
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:01,650
Can't we?

981
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:07,650
I think our present arrangement
is very good for us.

982
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:11,192
- What's good about it?
- Well, you're...

983
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:12,660
I mean, we're writing again.

984
01:09:12,832 --> 01:09:14,697
Oh, I can write
under any circumstances.

985
01:09:14,867 --> 01:09:16,994
- Except when we're married.
- That's ridiculous.

986
01:09:17,169 --> 01:09:19,069
No, it isn't.
You're ambitious now, Eddie.

987
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,466
You want things.

988
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:22,800
That's an awful good sign,
wanting things.

989
01:09:22,975 --> 01:09:24,465
Oh, it is, is it?

990
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:28,306
If all you want is the writing I can do,
we'd better call the whole thing off.

991
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,813
Oh, but, darling,
I've enjoyed your company too.

992
01:09:31,984 --> 01:09:36,148
- Thanks. Thanks too much.
- Oh, Eddie, don't you understand?

993
01:09:36,322 --> 01:09:38,449
All I understand is everything was swell...

994
01:09:38,624 --> 01:09:42,082
...until you twisted me around your finger
and talked me into a divorce.

995
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,025
- I talked you...?
- Yes, you did, don't argue, it's true.

996
01:09:45,197 --> 01:09:47,461
And then a very funny thing.

997
01:09:47,633 --> 01:09:50,693
All of a sudden that palooka
of a sob singer appears on the scene.

998
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:53,737
Don't be so darn silly.
You have no reason to be jealous.

999
01:09:53,906 --> 01:09:55,601
I'm not jealous.

1000
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,436
But will you kindly explain
Buddy Crawford?

1001
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,476
But he's jealous of you.

1002
01:10:00,646 --> 01:10:02,910
He's jealous of...?
Why, the conceit of the guy.

1003
01:10:03,082 --> 01:10:04,674
I never heard of such a thing.

1004
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:08,217
- That's what I tell him.
- Oh, you do, do you?

1005
01:10:08,387 --> 01:10:10,753
Well, I'm tired of the whole setup.

1006
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,093
This is the end.
You can't make a chump out of me.

1007
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:17,286
I know what's going on.
I'm not gonna stand for it.

1008
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,862
Come back here and behave yourself.

1009
01:10:19,031 --> 01:10:21,329
Now, you think I'm blind?
I wasn't born yesterday.

1010
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,196
- Say, who writes your corny material?
- Never mind.

1011
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:26,361
You won't have to put up with it
any longer.

1012
01:10:26,538 --> 01:10:30,565
From now on, I'll go my way
and you can go yours.

1013
01:10:42,243 --> 01:10:43,267
Hello, Marilyn.

1014
01:10:43,444 --> 01:10:44,877
- Hello, Buddy.
- Hi.

1015
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:48,914
- Forgive me for phoning you.
- I like to hear from the girl I'm gonna marry.

1016
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:53,110
Mr. Crawford, isn't this rather sudden?
Have you asked your mother's consent?

1017
01:10:53,288 --> 01:10:55,620
She told me
when I found a girl crazy about me...

1018
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,418
...just go right ahead and marry her,
so we're all set.

1019
01:10:58,593 --> 01:11:00,561
Well, wasn't that sweet of her?

1020
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:03,322
No, seriously, I wanna talk to you
about the divorce.

1021
01:11:03,698 --> 01:11:05,461
Well, what about our children?

1022
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:09,364
No, all joking aside, Buddy.
I'm really worried about Dixie's divorce.

1023
01:11:09,537 --> 01:11:11,266
We've got to do something about it.

1024
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:13,407
I thought the judge
did a fair job on it.

1025
01:11:13,574 --> 01:11:17,169
- What's there left for us to do?
- We've got to get them back together.

1026
01:11:17,345 --> 01:11:20,576
She's really madly in love with Eddie,
and I think he is with her.

1027
01:11:20,748 --> 01:11:23,979
What do you want me to do? Put him
on my knee and be a mother to him?

1028
01:11:24,152 --> 01:11:26,086
- I have a good idea.
- I have a better one.

1029
01:11:26,254 --> 01:11:31,521
- You and I get married. Set an example.
- Now, now, now. I've got it all planned.

1030
01:11:31,693 --> 01:11:33,820
We've gotta do something
to make Eddie jealous.

1031
01:11:33,995 --> 01:11:36,862
That guy's so jealous,
you can hear him sizzle on a clear day.

1032
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:39,795
That's the point. It only needs
one gesture on your part.

1033
01:11:39,968 --> 01:11:44,371
My part? Listen, I almost got punched
in the nose for no good reason at all.

1034
01:11:44,539 --> 01:11:47,804
You know that guy's temper.
What are you trying to cook up, a homicide?

1035
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:49,603
Now, don't be frightened, junior.

1036
01:11:49,777 --> 01:11:53,269
Mother won't let you get hurt. I only
want you to send Dixie a diamond ring.

1037
01:11:53,448 --> 01:11:55,678
A diamond what? Hey, what is this?

1038
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,876
When Eddie hears that,
he'll have Dixie in front of a preacher...

1039
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:01,078
...before you can get the ring back.

1040
01:12:01,255 --> 01:12:03,519
This has gone far enough.
I refuse to be made a...

1041
01:12:03,691 --> 01:12:07,183
You're a dear, Buddy. When you
pick out the ring, be sure it's big.

1042
01:12:07,362 --> 01:12:10,092
- But suppose she accepts it?
- Accept a ring from you?

1043
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:14,758
Oh, don't be ridiculous, darling.

1044
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:20,870
Well, how do I like that?

1045
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:29,341
Hello, Buttons.
Oh, have I got a surprise for you.

1046
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:30,984
Come on, look what I have.

1047
01:12:31,152 --> 01:12:33,052
Come here. Buttons.

1048
01:12:33,221 --> 01:12:35,655
Come here. Stand up.
Stand up. Speak.

1049
01:12:37,025 --> 01:12:40,358
Oh! Marilyn, you scared me to death.
Come here, darling.

1050
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:42,018
There. Don't you say thank you?

1051
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:44,391
Oh, he never says a word.

1052
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:46,032
What are you doing on the floor?

1053
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,031
Working on some steps
for my new number.

1054
01:12:48,202 --> 01:12:49,328
Oh, it looks great.

1055
01:12:49,504 --> 01:12:52,496
Yeah, now if I can just do what I draw.

1056
01:12:52,673 --> 01:12:55,733
Marilyn, you just worry
about drawing what you do.

1057
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:58,075
How come you and Eddie
didn't work today?

1058
01:12:58,913 --> 01:13:02,872
Oh, we were going to, but we had kind
of an argument last night after the banquet.

1059
01:13:03,051 --> 01:13:05,918
After Max's swell speech about you?

1060
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:08,851
I thought you two would be back
together again for keeps.

1061
01:13:09,524 --> 01:13:11,389
What a spot to be in.

1062
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:14,824
A woman who doesn't dare marry
her own husband.

1063
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:20,030
Now, let's see.

1064
01:13:36,017 --> 01:13:37,245
What's the matter, Buttons?

1065
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:42,220
Oh.

1066
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,685
Well, come on.

1067
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:50,960
Oh, so you wanna get in
on this thing too, huh?

1068
01:13:51,132 --> 01:13:52,429
Thought you did.

1069
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,828
Come on, faster.

1070
01:13:54,001 --> 01:13:55,764
Come on, once more. Come on.

1071
01:13:55,937 --> 01:13:57,700
Come on.

1072
01:13:57,872 --> 01:14:00,739
Now, sit down. I got work to do.

1073
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:04,038
Then:

1074
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:07,139
Now for a little music.

1075
01:15:34,936 --> 01:15:37,734
Oh, so you don't like the hula, huh?
Bet you can't do it.

1076
01:17:18,806 --> 01:17:20,671
Sounded good. How did it go?

1077
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:22,365
Oh, pretty good, Dixie.

1078
01:17:22,543 --> 01:17:26,070
They just phoned from downstairs to tell us
to get the horse out of the apartment.

1079
01:17:27,448 --> 01:17:28,779
Oh, look at this room.

1080
01:17:28,949 --> 01:17:31,247
Well, wait a minute. I'll help.

1081
01:17:34,288 --> 01:17:36,313
Oh, wait a minute. I'll get it.

1082
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:39,050
It might be somebody...

1083
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:44,122
- Mrs. Edward Crane?
- Yes.

1084
01:17:46,033 --> 01:17:48,297
Sign here, lady.

1085
01:18:03,651 --> 01:18:05,949
- Surprise?
- I think so.

1086
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:11,822
Oh, it's simply beautiful, Dixie.

1087
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:16,224
- Why, I might have chosen it myself.
- Marilyn.

1088
01:18:16,397 --> 01:18:18,627
Who's it from?

1089
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:21,729
Oh, no card, but I know.

1090
01:18:21,902 --> 01:18:23,529
- Buddy?
- Uh-huh.

1091
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:27,299
- Buddy? Oh, heavens, no. Eddie.
- Oh.

1092
01:18:27,475 --> 01:18:30,000
After last night's scene,
this is his way of apologizing.

1093
01:18:30,177 --> 01:18:33,146
He always does something like this
to take my mind off the real issue.

1094
01:18:34,515 --> 01:18:36,039
- Oh. That's Eddie.
- Oh, I'll get it.

1095
01:18:36,217 --> 01:18:39,152
It's probably for me.
I'm expecting a call.

1096
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:50,026
Hello? Hello, Eddie. This is Marilyn.

1097
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,573
Oh.

1098
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:04,239
- Hello, Dixie.
- Hello, Buddy.

1099
01:19:04,612 --> 01:19:08,639
- Can I come in?
- Oh, of course.

1100
01:19:09,984 --> 01:19:11,042
Oh, well, come in.

1101
01:19:11,218 --> 01:19:13,118
Thank you.

1102
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:19,586
Oh, can I take your hat?

1103
01:19:23,364 --> 01:19:25,764
- That's a lovely new ring you're wearing.
- Yes.

1104
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:27,525
How did you guess it was new?

1105
01:19:27,701 --> 01:19:29,635
I didn't have to guess it was new.

1106
01:19:29,804 --> 01:19:31,965
I knew it was new.

1107
01:19:32,139 --> 01:19:35,631
- How do you like it?
- Oh, Buddy, I think it's beautiful.

1108
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:36,970
Thank you.

1109
01:19:37,144 --> 01:19:38,907
Darling, it looks exactly like you.

1110
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:40,239
Buddy.

1111
01:19:40,414 --> 01:19:42,678
Well, we are engaged, aren't we?

1112
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,647
Oh, Buddy, you didn't send...

1113
01:19:44,819 --> 01:19:47,083
Well, I thought Eddie...

1114
01:19:47,588 --> 01:19:50,785
- Oh, you did send it, didn't you?
- Well, what's so awful about that?

1115
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,518
- Nothing. I couldn't possibly...
- You keep that thing on.

1116
01:19:53,694 --> 01:19:57,152
I want Marilyn to know about this.
I want the whole world to know about it.

1117
01:19:57,331 --> 01:19:59,925
- No... You mustn't...
- Let me do the talking from now on.

1118
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:03,035
- From now on I'll do the talking.
- I couldn't take this.

1119
01:20:03,204 --> 01:20:06,037
Well, anyway, I thought you'd
like to know she got the ring.

1120
01:20:06,207 --> 01:20:08,698
And is she thrilled. It's beautiful.

1121
01:20:09,443 --> 01:20:11,343
What ring? I never sent her a ring.

1122
01:20:11,512 --> 01:20:12,774
Well, somebody did.

1123
01:20:12,947 --> 01:20:14,380
And it's a diamond too.

1124
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:16,209
And it's as big as an ink well.

1125
01:20:16,383 --> 01:20:17,714
What?

1126
01:20:17,885 --> 01:20:20,854
I don't know what's going on,
but I'm coming over to find out.

1127
01:20:21,021 --> 01:20:23,649
Tell her I think I'll bring a gun
and cause some trouble.

1128
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:25,587
I'm not gonna stand for this.

1129
01:20:25,759 --> 01:20:29,195
Gun? Oh, Eddie, I was only kidding.
Honestly.

1130
01:20:29,363 --> 01:20:33,561
I didn't mean for you to go that far.
Hello, Eddie? Eddie? Gun?

1131
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:36,328
- You've made me the happiest man.
- Dixie, come quick.

1132
01:20:36,504 --> 01:20:40,634
I've gotta see you alone for a moment.
Please, hurry. Hurry.

1133
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:43,407
Hello, Buddy.

1134
01:20:44,612 --> 01:20:47,308
Something awful has happened.
That was Eddie on the phone.

1135
01:20:47,481 --> 01:20:50,041
- He's got a gun. He's on his way here.
- A gun? What for?

1136
01:20:50,217 --> 01:20:52,515
- He's gonna shoot somebody. Probably you.
- Me?

1137
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:55,154
- Yes. Come on.
- You didn't tell him about the ring?

1138
01:20:55,322 --> 01:20:56,789
Well, I might have mentioned it.

1139
01:20:56,957 --> 01:20:59,892
But I didn't know he was a killer.
Help me get into my things.

1140
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,528
- All right.
- I don't wanna get shot looking like this.

1141
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:06,723
Hey, driver, quit dragging your feet.
I'm in a hurry.

1142
01:21:07,768 --> 01:21:09,565
Never mind your hat.

1143
01:21:11,305 --> 01:21:13,239
What's the matter?
- Is that my picture?

1144
01:21:13,407 --> 01:21:16,001
Not yet. Come on, we better hurry.

1145
01:21:16,911 --> 01:21:18,845
We've gotta hit the road.
Come on, Buddy.

1146
01:21:19,013 --> 01:21:20,640
- Come on, Buddy.
- Hey, what's happened?

1147
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:23,205
Too late.

1148
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:25,511
- What'll we do?
- Who is it?

1149
01:21:25,686 --> 01:21:27,153
- It's Eddie.
- So what?

1150
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:28,982
- He's got a gun.
- He's gonna shoot us.

1151
01:21:29,156 --> 01:21:31,386
- Hide.
- Let's hide. Get behind the curtain.

1152
01:21:31,559 --> 01:21:33,493
- You get behind the curtain.
- No, you.

1153
01:21:33,661 --> 01:21:36,824
Why should I hide? You hide.
He's after you, not me. I hope.

1154
01:21:36,997 --> 01:21:39,192
Come on, Buddy.
Sit down and act natural.

1155
01:21:39,934 --> 01:21:41,834
Well, it's my apartment.

1156
01:21:42,002 --> 01:21:44,596
I guess I'll have to face him.

1157
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:48,102
- Hey, Dixie.
- What?

1158
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:50,969
Will you hide? He can see you.

1159
01:21:53,847 --> 01:21:57,408
Eddie, don't shoot. Don't shoot.
I can explain everything. It's all my fault.

1160
01:21:57,585 --> 01:21:59,553
- Where is Dixie?
- She's not exactly here.

1161
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:03,349
- She sort of went out.
- Well, I'll find out if she did or not.

1162
01:22:07,261 --> 01:22:08,751
- Hello.
- Now I know she's here.

1163
01:22:08,929 --> 01:22:11,227
- Where's my wife?
- Married again? Congratulations.

1164
01:22:11,398 --> 01:22:15,767
- Trot her out.
- How? She's not here. Look for yourself.

1165
01:22:17,438 --> 01:22:20,032
- I suppose you two were alone, huh?
- Why not?

1166
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:21,469
- Yeah, why not?
- We like it.

1167
01:22:21,642 --> 01:22:23,633
I know which way the wind's blowing.

1168
01:22:23,811 --> 01:22:25,301
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

1169
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:27,538
Buddy and I've been good friends
for a long time.

1170
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:30,377
We've been more than just good friends.

1171
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:32,576
We've been...

1172
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,054
Haven't we?

1173
01:22:35,222 --> 01:22:37,554
- Absolutely.
- There you are, the man admits it.

1174
01:22:37,725 --> 01:22:40,717
Pretty smart, Marilyn,
but I don't believe it.

1175
01:22:41,929 --> 01:22:43,521
Aha.

1176
01:22:55,943 --> 01:22:57,672
Come out, Dixie.
I know where you are.

1177
01:23:05,519 --> 01:23:06,713
Well, satisfied?

1178
01:23:06,887 --> 01:23:08,821
- Well, I don't understand it.
- Neither do I.

1179
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,457
Maybe she isn't here.
Doesn't explain what you're doing here.

1180
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:13,286
Oh, Eddie, don't be embarrassing.

1181
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,052
What difference does that make?

1182
01:23:15,229 --> 01:23:17,163
All right, all right, I'm going.

1183
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:19,526
But I'm not convinced.

1184
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,565
Sorry.

1185
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:25,295
Well...

1186
01:23:26,774 --> 01:23:30,403
I guess you both must think
I'm kind of daffy.

1187
01:23:30,577 --> 01:23:31,771
- You want the truth?
- What?

1188
01:23:31,945 --> 01:23:33,310
- You are.
- Who's daffy?

1189
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,541
- You are. About Dixie.
- Eh.

1190
01:24:07,948 --> 01:24:10,644
Oh, darling.

1191
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:15,882
Well, what happened to you?

1192
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:19,025
Well, you won't think
I'm silly, will you?

1193
01:24:19,193 --> 01:24:22,390
- Why should I think you're silly?
- Well, it's about Dixie.

1194
01:24:22,563 --> 01:24:25,623
Eddie's so jealous that
I'm beginning to wonder too.

1195
01:24:25,799 --> 01:24:28,597
There's nothing between you, is there?

1196
01:24:31,038 --> 01:24:32,903
Oh, it'd break my heart if there was.

1197
01:24:33,073 --> 01:24:34,335
Tell me there isn't.

1198
01:24:37,711 --> 01:24:42,080
Well, opportunity, knock once more.

1199
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:44,649
Quit it. You have no right.
You're taking advantage.

1200
01:24:44,818 --> 01:24:46,581
- This time we don't get away.
- Quit it.

1201
01:24:46,754 --> 01:24:48,654
- You have no right.
- I've waited for this.

1202
01:24:48,822 --> 01:24:52,155
- You're taking advantage.
- But, darling, I love you.

1203
01:24:52,326 --> 01:24:55,022
- Help! Dixie!
- I love you, I love you, I...

1204
01:24:55,662 --> 01:24:57,721
...love you.
Help, Dixie, help. Help!

1205
01:24:57,898 --> 01:24:58,990
Dixie, help.

1206
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:02,363
- Let me up.
- Buddy. Stop it, you wolf, you.

1207
01:25:02,536 --> 01:25:06,233
I thought so.
I knew there was some...

1208
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:12,207
What an act. What an act.

1209
01:25:12,379 --> 01:25:13,971
Oh, you opportunist, you.

1210
01:25:14,148 --> 01:25:16,673
A frame-up, huh?
Why didn't you come out in the open?

1211
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,841
I didn't wanna get shot
by a mad musician.

1212
01:25:19,019 --> 01:25:21,852
- How about that diamond ring?
- I haven't accepted it yet.

1213
01:25:22,022 --> 01:25:23,922
- Who gave it to you?
- I gave it to her.

1214
01:25:24,091 --> 01:25:27,720
How do you like that? Give one gal a ring
then take advantage of her friend.

1215
01:25:27,895 --> 01:25:30,363
- How could you fall for such a jerk?
- Remember your temper.

1216
01:25:30,531 --> 01:25:33,591
- You've got a gun in that pocket.
- No, I haven't. I couldn't find one.

1217
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:37,498
They're pearls, see? They were for you.
I'm gonna give them back to the oysters.

1218
01:25:37,671 --> 01:25:39,866
You pulled the wool over my eyes
once too often.

1219
01:25:40,073 --> 01:25:42,132
Do something,
or I'll never speak to you again.

1220
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:44,937
Ow! Look here, it may interest you
to know...

1221
01:25:45,112 --> 01:25:47,103
Nothing you could say could interest me.

1222
01:25:47,281 --> 01:25:49,044
- That's what I thought.
- Eddie.

1223
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:52,911
Wait a minute.

1224
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,255
Marilyn, will you and Buddy go out
and have dinner someplace?

1225
01:25:56,423 --> 01:25:58,357
I wanna settle a few things with Eddie.

1226
01:25:59,626 --> 01:26:01,992
We're on our way, Dixie.

1227
01:26:02,162 --> 01:26:04,357
We'll be over at Twenty-One.

1228
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:07,892
Eddie, come here.

1229
01:26:08,068 --> 01:26:10,002
Now, sit down.

1230
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,468
- Eddie, I...
- I suppose...

1231
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,040
...you wanna talk
about our working together again.

1232
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:19,444
Dixie, darling,
I don't think I could take it.

1233
01:26:19,613 --> 01:26:21,410
You see, I...

1234
01:26:21,582 --> 01:26:23,914
I'd keep watching you.

1235
01:26:24,084 --> 01:26:26,780
The funny little way you turn your head...

1236
01:26:26,954 --> 01:26:31,015
...and the way you pull on your ear
when you haven't got an idea.

1237
01:26:31,992 --> 01:26:33,823
Oh, I couldn't take it, kid. I'm sorry.

1238
01:26:33,994 --> 01:26:36,554
Oh, Eddie,
what's the matter with you, anyway?

1239
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:39,198
Do you have to be hit in the head
with a hammer?

1240
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:40,594
Huh?

1241
01:26:40,767 --> 01:26:44,760
Oh, darling, how could you ever think
I could love anybody else?

1242
01:26:44,938 --> 01:26:48,635
The ring was a mistake, that's all.
A misunderstanding.

1243
01:26:48,809 --> 01:26:49,833
- Yeah?
- Oh, Eddie...

1244
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:52,274
...I couldn't think of marrying him.

1245
01:26:52,446 --> 01:26:55,074
Well, then you're not sore at me?

1246
01:26:55,249 --> 01:26:57,376
I'm furious with you.

1247
01:26:57,551 --> 01:26:59,109
Oh, Dixie.

1248
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,885
I guess you still love me, huh?

1249
01:27:02,055 --> 01:27:04,751
Oh, who else?

1250
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:06,656
Marry me tonight.

1251
01:27:06,827 --> 01:27:08,158
- Oh, I shouldn't.
- I dare you.

1252
01:27:08,328 --> 01:27:10,819
- I shouldn't.
- I dare you.

1253
01:27:13,367 --> 01:27:18,270
Do you, Dixie Donegan, take this man
for your lawful wedded husband?

1254
01:27:18,438 --> 01:27:20,099
Answer, "I do. "

1255
01:27:20,274 --> 01:27:21,935
I do.

1256
01:27:22,109 --> 01:27:27,342
And do you, Edward Crane, take this
woman for your lawful wedded wife?

1257
01:27:27,514 --> 01:27:29,846
Yeah, I do.

1258
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:41,725
Well, I certainly am Joe the Jerk.

1259
01:27:41,895 --> 01:27:45,991
I risk my life to carry out your plans,
the two characters get married...

1260
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:47,258
...and what do I get?

1261
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:48,924
You're too impulsive, Buddy.

1262
01:27:49,102 --> 01:27:52,128
And anyway, I'm a little worried
about your intentions.

1263
01:27:52,306 --> 01:27:55,002
- What do you mean? I did all right.
- That's just it.

1264
01:27:55,175 --> 01:27:58,611
You were either loving that scene with Dixie
or you're the greatest faker.

1265
01:27:58,779 --> 01:28:02,215
Oh, darling, that's what I love about you.
You're so doggone consistent.

1266
01:28:02,382 --> 01:28:03,644
Why consistent?

1267
01:28:03,817 --> 01:28:07,150
You get me to make a play for your
best friend against my best friend...

1268
01:28:07,321 --> 01:28:11,223
...and then you rule me out for holding.
But I love you, you're wonderful.

1269
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:14,849
Well, you know,
I have some emotions of my own.

1270
01:28:15,028 --> 01:28:17,826
Even I could have been a bit jealous.

1271
01:28:17,998 --> 01:28:20,023
You are?

1272
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:24,296
I guess I kind of fell for my own formula.

1273
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:27,406
Why didn't you tell me when we were
with the guy with the Book?

1274
01:28:27,574 --> 01:28:29,474
- You didn't ask me.
- I didn't ask you.

1275
01:28:29,643 --> 01:28:32,111
And besides, you didn't have sense
to bring a license.

1276
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:34,338
I didn't have sense enough...

1277
01:28:34,514 --> 01:28:36,311
Did you say license?

1278
01:28:36,483 --> 01:28:39,213
You big chump.

1279
01:28:40,687 --> 01:28:42,678
What are you thinking, Dixie?

1280
01:28:42,856 --> 01:28:45,620
I was just thinking
about the Hopkins show.

1281
01:28:45,792 --> 01:28:48,955
- Think what a chance that is for us.
- Yeah. Swell, isn't it?

1282
01:28:49,129 --> 01:28:52,462
Oh, it's more than swell, darling.
It's our wish fulfillment.

1283
01:28:52,632 --> 01:28:54,896
The one big chance we've waited for.

1284
01:28:55,068 --> 01:28:58,231
It's as if everything else of ours
was just building toward that.

1285
01:28:58,405 --> 01:29:00,134
Yeah, I know.

1286
01:29:00,307 --> 01:29:02,400
When do we start work on it, darling?

1287
01:29:02,576 --> 01:29:05,739
Oh, I don't know.
Soon as we get back, I guess.

1288
01:29:05,912 --> 01:29:07,937
I'm afraid I'll be too tired.

1289
01:29:08,115 --> 01:29:10,140
Couldn't you wait till tomorrow?

1290
01:29:10,317 --> 01:29:12,182
Tomorrow?

1291
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,587
No, I mean, when we get back
from our honeymoon.

1292
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:18,990
Honeymoon?

1293
01:29:19,159 --> 01:29:21,627
- Are you clowning?
- Certainly not.

1294
01:29:21,795 --> 01:29:24,662
I worked hard to win you back,
now can't we just play a while?

1295
01:29:24,831 --> 01:29:28,062
Oh, but Eddie, the show is so important.
I thought you felt that too.

1296
01:29:28,235 --> 01:29:31,932
Oh, it'll wait. We can knock that off
in a couple of weeks when we get back.

1297
01:29:32,105 --> 01:29:35,666
I was gonna surprise you. The Martins
are loaning us their place in Bermuda.

1298
01:29:35,842 --> 01:29:40,472
It's across the bay from Kiki Wendover.
She's asking the mob down for a month.

1299
01:29:40,647 --> 01:29:42,945
Think of the fun when I tell them
we're married.

1300
01:29:43,116 --> 01:29:44,845
They'll love you, Dixie.

1301
01:29:45,018 --> 01:29:46,815
What's the matter?

1302
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:48,420
- Eddie.
- Yeah?

1303
01:29:48,588 --> 01:29:50,852
- I've just decided something.
- What?

1304
01:29:51,024 --> 01:29:54,482
We've got to go on working
just the way we were.

1305
01:29:54,661 --> 01:29:57,425
- What do you mean?
- This show has got to be our best effort.

1306
01:29:57,597 --> 01:30:00,828
- When it's a hit, we can go away and play.
- I don't see it that way.

1307
01:30:01,001 --> 01:30:03,799
- It's got to be that way. What's...
- What are you driving at?

1308
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:06,564
- We're married, aren't we?
- Yes, finally.

1309
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:11,803
But until we finish the Hopkins show,
I'm gonna keep right on living with Marilyn.

1310
01:30:15,449 --> 01:30:16,973
- What happened?
- Do you mean that?

1311
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:19,550
- I do.
- You mean I gotta go on living alone?

1312
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:21,653
- Until we...
- Well, I'm not.

1313
01:30:21,822 --> 01:30:25,314
And if you think I am,
you can get out of this car right here.

1314
01:30:25,492 --> 01:30:27,050
All right, Mr. Crane.

1315
01:30:27,227 --> 01:30:29,889
All out, kids. This is as far as we go.

1316
01:30:30,063 --> 01:30:33,226
- What's this all about?
- Don't ask me.

1317
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:41,332
Go ahead, drive away if you dare.

1318
01:30:41,508 --> 01:30:42,907
And did he?

1319
01:30:43,076 --> 01:30:44,475
Yes.

1320
01:30:44,644 --> 01:30:48,978
- Well, how'd you get back to New York?
- Well, we:

1321
01:30:52,285 --> 01:30:55,516
I've always wanted to do that.

1322
01:30:56,323 --> 01:30:57,915
Well, proceed, Mrs. Crane.

1323
01:30:58,091 --> 01:31:01,424
The next day, when I got back,
Mr. Hopkins, the producer of the show...

1324
01:31:01,595 --> 01:31:04,894
...Eddie and I were supposed to write,
told me Eddie had quit.

1325
01:31:05,065 --> 01:31:08,728
Well, during this time, did the defendant
make any effort to see you?

1326
01:31:09,669 --> 01:31:11,637
None whatsoever.

1327
01:31:11,805 --> 01:31:15,138
- But...
- But what, Mrs. Crane?

1328
01:31:15,308 --> 01:31:17,970
I did see him once,
two weeks after we were married.

1329
01:31:18,145 --> 01:31:19,169
What was he doing?

1330
01:31:20,113 --> 01:31:22,047
Composing a symphony.

1331
01:31:22,516 --> 01:31:24,575
How did you find out all about this?

1332
01:31:26,153 --> 01:31:28,587
While the show was in rehearsal,
we needed a verse...

1333
01:31:28,755 --> 01:31:31,724
...for the big finale number in a hurry,
and I was stuck.

1334
01:31:31,892 --> 01:31:34,690
I didn't seem to get ideas the way
I used to.

1335
01:31:34,861 --> 01:31:37,830
I remembered a half-finished lyric
I'd left in our apartment...

1336
01:31:37,998 --> 01:31:41,729
...when Eddie and I were working together,
so I went up to get it.

1337
01:31:58,718 --> 01:32:00,982
- Dixie.
- Hello, Eddie.

1338
01:32:01,154 --> 01:32:03,213
- Hello.
- I hate to disturb you...

1339
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:05,984
...but I'll have to look
for something I left here.

1340
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:07,990
May I?

1341
01:32:08,228 --> 01:32:11,026
Why, sure. Sure, come on in.

1342
01:32:18,171 --> 01:32:19,433
Oh, uh...

1343
01:32:19,606 --> 01:32:22,575
Dixie, you remember Mrs. Wardley.
This is my... Uh...

1344
01:32:23,176 --> 01:32:25,167
- Miss Donegan.
- Yes, we've met.

1345
01:32:25,345 --> 01:32:27,142
Of course. How do you do?

1346
01:32:27,314 --> 01:32:28,975
Hello.

1347
01:32:29,649 --> 01:32:31,640
I didn't mean to make
a dramatic entrance.

1348
01:32:31,818 --> 01:32:35,982
I've just come to get a piece of paper
I left here a couple of hundred years ago...

1349
01:32:36,156 --> 01:32:37,418
...when I was working here.

1350
01:32:37,591 --> 01:32:39,218
That's quite all right.

1351
01:32:39,392 --> 01:32:40,984
Eddie's told me all about you.

1352
01:32:41,161 --> 01:32:42,355
Oh?

1353
01:32:42,529 --> 01:32:43,621
He has?

1354
01:32:43,797 --> 01:32:46,163
Well, Mrs. Wardley
is terribly interested in music.

1355
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:47,698
Good music, that is.

1356
01:32:47,867 --> 01:32:50,927
So when I told her about the symphony
I'd always wanted to write...

1357
01:32:51,104 --> 01:32:53,129
...why, naturally...
- The what?

1358
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:55,604
Well, I guess I never mentioned it to you.

1359
01:32:55,775 --> 01:32:58,471
- But I always felt that...
You see, Mrs. Crane...

1360
01:32:58,645 --> 01:33:01,478
...Eddie's never had a fair chance
to express himself.

1361
01:33:01,648 --> 01:33:04,811
Of course, he wrote some simply
divine little tunes, but...

1362
01:33:04,985 --> 01:33:06,919
With lyrics.

1363
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:09,385
Yeah, with lyrics.
My wife wrote the lyrics.

1364
01:33:09,556 --> 01:33:12,150
Forgive me.
Of course, he did mention that.

1365
01:33:12,325 --> 01:33:14,589
The point is,
he wants to write something better.

1366
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:16,786
That was just a step in his career.

1367
01:33:16,963 --> 01:33:19,898
- How was it you explained it to me?
- What?

1368
01:33:20,066 --> 01:33:22,534
About what you wanted to do,
you remember?

1369
01:33:22,702 --> 01:33:24,192
Oh.

1370
01:33:25,138 --> 01:33:29,939
Well, I just told Mrs. Wardley
that I was fed up writing popular songs.

1371
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:32,408
Little jingles set to tunes.

1372
01:33:32,579 --> 01:33:35,878
Real music speaks a language
more eloquent than words.

1373
01:33:36,049 --> 01:33:38,677
Give me flutes, oboes, a string section.

1374
01:33:38,852 --> 01:33:41,446
- Carnegie Hall.
- And Carnegie Hall. I'll show them.

1375
01:33:41,621 --> 01:33:43,521
- Why, you're serious.
- Miss Donegan, you...

1376
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:45,123
You keep out of this.

1377
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:48,193
So you're gonna walk out on the show.
You're gonna let me down.

1378
01:33:48,361 --> 01:33:51,626
I thought we kissed that nonsense goodbye
two weeks ago in Connecticut.

1379
01:33:51,798 --> 01:33:53,891
You might have had
the common decency to let me know.

1380
01:33:54,067 --> 01:33:56,729
- Did I hear you say "common decency"?
- Symphony, eh?

1381
01:33:56,903 --> 01:33:58,370
I thought I'd heard everything.

1382
01:33:58,538 --> 01:34:01,132
- But, Miss Donegan...
- You keep quiet and sit down.

1383
01:34:01,308 --> 01:34:03,833
I came to get a lyric
and I'm not leaving without it.

1384
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:05,170
- Get up.
- Leave her alone.

1385
01:34:05,345 --> 01:34:08,576
I wouldn't think of touching
a hair of that divine coiffure.

1386
01:34:08,748 --> 01:34:11,876
But my lyric is in this piano seat.

1387
01:34:14,387 --> 01:34:17,845
Words, get it? Words.

1388
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:21,722
Yeah, well, the words I've got
I can't use in front of a lady.

1389
01:34:23,263 --> 01:34:25,925
Oh, and you will let me hear
your symphony, won't you?

1390
01:34:26,099 --> 01:34:29,626
When you hear it, it'll be at Carnegie Hall,
and it'll cost you $3.30.

1391
01:34:29,803 --> 01:34:32,363
When you hear this it'll be
at the Melody Box Theatre...

1392
01:34:32,539 --> 01:34:34,234
...and it'll cost you $5.50.

1393
01:35:02,268 --> 01:35:06,364
<i>You can get it
From the blare of a trumpet</i>

1394
01:35:09,909 --> 01:35:15,313
<i>You can get it from the wail
Of a slide trombone</i>

1395
01:35:19,619 --> 01:35:26,616
<i>You can get it from the slap
Of a big string bass</i>

1396
01:35:30,463 --> 01:35:37,460
<i>Or the moan of a saxophone</i>

1397
01:35:39,506 --> 01:35:43,772
<i>And every time I hear a band
Start playing</i>

1398
01:35:43,943 --> 01:35:49,108
<i>Whether it be fast or sweet and low</i>

1399
01:35:49,282 --> 01:35:52,479
<i>From the very moment it starts beating</i>

1400
01:35:52,652 --> 01:35:56,520
<i>Everything about me starts repeating</i>

1401
01:35:58,258 --> 01:36:00,624
<i>Drums roll</i>

1402
01:36:00,794 --> 01:36:02,989
<i>Saxes moan</i>

1403
01:36:03,163 --> 01:36:07,964
<i>Trumpets blare</i>

1404
01:36:08,368 --> 01:36:10,359
<i>Fascinatin' rhythm
You got me on the go</i>

1405
01:36:10,537 --> 01:36:12,937
<i>Fascinatin' rhythm
I'm all a quiver</i>

1406
01:36:13,373 --> 01:36:14,533
<i>What a mess you're makin'</i>

1407
01:36:14,707 --> 01:36:18,040
<i>The neighbors wanna know
Why I'm always shakin'just like a flivver</i>

1408
01:36:18,845 --> 01:36:22,144
<i>Each morning I get up with the sun</i>

1409
01:36:22,315 --> 01:36:27,548
<i>Start a-hoppin', never stoppin'
To find at night no work has been done</i>

1410
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:30,917
<i>I know that once it didn't matter
But now you're doin' wrong</i>

1411
01:36:31,090 --> 01:36:33,581
<i>When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy</i>

1412
01:36:33,993 --> 01:36:36,120
<i>Won't you take a day off?
Decide to go away</i>

1413
01:36:36,296 --> 01:36:38,890
<i>Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy</i>

1414
01:36:39,732 --> 01:36:43,896
<i>Oh, how I long to be the girl
I used to be</i>

1415
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:49,372
<i>Fascinatin' rhythm
Oh, won't you stop pickin' on me?</i>

1416
01:36:50,443 --> 01:36:52,343
<i>Da-da-di-ah
Da-da-di-ah</i>

1417
01:36:52,512 --> 01:36:55,072
<i>Da-da-di-ah
Dah</i>

1418
01:36:55,815 --> 01:36:57,578
<i>Da-da-di-ah
Da-da-di-ah</i>

1419
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:00,014
<i>Da-da-di-ah
Dah</i>

1420
01:37:00,186 --> 01:37:03,155
<i>Oh, how I wish they'd take it away</i>

1421
01:37:03,323 --> 01:37:07,191
<i>Take it away from me
That rhythm hangs around me all</i>

1422
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,954
<i>Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da</i>

1423
01:37:10,129 --> 01:37:12,689
<i>Da-da-di-ah-dah</i>

1424
01:37:12,866 --> 01:37:15,027
<i>Da-da-di-ah-dah</i>

1425
01:37:15,201 --> 01:37:17,761
<i>Da-da-da-di-ah-dah</i>

1426
01:37:17,937 --> 01:37:20,770
<i>Da-da-da-di-ah-dah</i>

1427
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:24,273
<i>I know that rhythm is cruel to me
Rhythm is ruinin' me</i>

1428
01:37:24,444 --> 01:37:26,935
<i>Makin' a fool of me
Stop it</i>

1429
01:37:28,214 --> 01:37:29,738
<i>Stop it</i>

1430
01:37:31,084 --> 01:37:32,278
<i>Fascinatin' rhythm</i>

1431
01:37:32,452 --> 01:37:39,290
<i>Won't you stop pickin' on me</i>

1432
01:41:21,447 --> 01:41:23,677
<i>Fascinatin' rhythm
You got me on the go</i>

1433
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:26,250
<i>Fascinatin' rhythm
I'm all a quiver</i>

1434
01:41:26,919 --> 01:41:29,285
<i>What a mess you're makin'
The neighbors should go</i>

1435
01:41:29,455 --> 01:41:31,719
<i>I'm always shakin' like a flivver</i>

1436
01:41:32,658 --> 01:41:35,650
<i>Each morn as I'm wakin' up</i>

1437
01:41:36,162 --> 01:41:38,062
<i>Very happy</i>

1438
01:41:38,231 --> 01:41:40,461
<i>Just to find that no work has been done</i>

1439
01:41:46,172 --> 01:41:48,436
<i>Once it didn't matter
But now you do wrong</i>

1440
01:41:48,608 --> 01:41:51,099
<i>- When you start to patter
- I'm so unhappy</i>

1441
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:53,974
<i>Won't you take a day off?
A couple of weeks</i>

1442
01:41:54,147 --> 01:41:57,116
<i>Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy</i>

1443
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:01,784
<i>Oh, how I long to be the man
That I used to be</i>

1444
01:42:02,755 --> 01:42:08,785
<i>Fascinatin' rhythm
Won't you stop pickin' on me?</i>

1445
01:43:31,978 --> 01:43:34,344
Yes, I liked that number very much.

1446
01:43:34,513 --> 01:43:35,912
Oh, thank you.

1447
01:43:36,082 --> 01:43:41,179
- I didn't know you'd seen the show.
- Oh, yes. I was there the opening night.

1448
01:43:41,354 --> 01:43:44,289
And that was an amazing dance,
young lady.

1449
01:43:44,457 --> 01:43:46,084
Take a bow.

1450
01:43:46,259 --> 01:43:47,317
Thank you, sir.

1451
01:43:49,262 --> 01:43:51,526
Proceed with the case, Mr. Blanton.

1452
01:43:51,697 --> 01:43:53,130
Your Honor...

1453
01:43:53,299 --> 01:43:56,666
...it seems fairly obvious in the absence
of counsel for the defendant...

1454
01:43:56,836 --> 01:44:00,795
...and no evidence in any form to refute
the charge of intolerable cruelty...

1455
01:44:00,973 --> 01:44:03,737
...that my client's case is defined.
We rest, Your Honor.

1456
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:08,643
- Is Mr. Edward Crane in court?
- No, Your Honor.

1457
01:44:08,814 --> 01:44:10,611
Do you know Mr. Crane's whereabouts?

1458
01:44:10,783 --> 01:44:14,241
Well, the last thing I heard,
he was taking a boat to South America.

1459
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:17,321
A vacation, judge.

1460
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:22,587
Mrs. Crane, it is within my jurisdiction
to grant this divorce.

1461
01:44:22,762 --> 01:44:25,754
The last divorce awarded you by me...

1462
01:44:25,932 --> 01:44:29,800
...was granted on the grounds
of incompatibility, is that right?

1463
01:44:29,969 --> 01:44:31,903
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes.

1464
01:44:32,071 --> 01:44:36,030
Well, now, this time,
you say it's intolerable cruelty.

1465
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:37,470
Let's see.

1466
01:44:37,643 --> 01:44:40,612
"Defendant failed to fulfill
his marital obligations.

1467
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:45,080
Lived apart from the plaintiff
for a period of more than six months. "

1468
01:44:45,251 --> 01:44:47,879
I take it, then, that you've
ceased to love one another.

1469
01:44:49,288 --> 01:44:52,485
- I didn't say that.
- But you still want a divorce.

1470
01:44:52,658 --> 01:44:54,523
- Yes.
- Yes.

1471
01:44:55,161 --> 01:44:57,493
Well, you're not going to get it.

1472
01:44:59,065 --> 01:45:03,001
- But, Your Honor, I object.
- Objection overruled.

1473
01:45:03,169 --> 01:45:04,693
Young lady...

1474
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:07,862
...when I was a boy there was a strange
custom in this country...

1475
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:12,500
...that when a fellow and a girl fell in love,
they got married and stayed that way.

1476
01:45:12,678 --> 01:45:14,873
And fought to make a go of it.

1477
01:45:15,047 --> 01:45:17,038
Now, I gave you that first divorce...

1478
01:45:17,216 --> 01:45:20,481
...because I knew one of two things
was going to happen:

1479
01:45:20,653 --> 01:45:23,144
If you didn't love each other sincerely...

1480
01:45:23,322 --> 01:45:27,224
...why, the divorce would stand,
and if you did, you'd get married again.

1481
01:45:27,393 --> 01:45:31,921
Now, once married you're not going
to get another divorce out of this court.

1482
01:45:32,098 --> 01:45:35,295
Not while I've the strength to lift a gavel.

1483
01:45:35,468 --> 01:45:38,596
So go home and behave yourself.

1484
01:45:38,771 --> 01:45:39,863
Case dismissed.

1485
01:46:06,465 --> 01:46:09,161
I beg your pardon, sir. Judge.

1486
01:46:09,335 --> 01:46:10,563
I thought you'd turn up.

1487
01:46:12,571 --> 01:46:13,765
You can't do this to me.

1488
01:46:13,939 --> 01:46:16,305
I have a right to be represented.
I love my wife.

1489
01:46:16,475 --> 01:46:19,933
- Oh, this must be Mr. Crane.
- Yes, sir.

1490
01:46:20,112 --> 01:46:22,239
What are all these things
I can't do to you?

1491
01:46:22,415 --> 01:46:25,111
You can't divorce us.
I have something to say.

1492
01:46:25,284 --> 01:46:27,980
I demand as a citizen
the right to trial and free speech.

1493
01:46:28,154 --> 01:46:30,349
I love Mrs. Crane
and no man can put us asunder.

1494
01:46:30,523 --> 01:46:32,616
"Until death do us part. "

1495
01:46:32,992 --> 01:46:34,584
Well, now, suppose you're too late?

1496
01:46:37,496 --> 01:46:39,589
You mean she's been here?

1497
01:46:39,865 --> 01:46:41,992
But you can't do that, judge.

1498
01:46:42,168 --> 01:46:43,430
I'm sure that isn't legal.

1499
01:46:43,602 --> 01:46:45,900
Look, young fellow,
contrary to your conception...

1500
01:46:46,072 --> 01:46:49,974
...this is a court of law,
and not a matrimonial pinball game.

1501
01:46:50,142 --> 01:46:54,909
I'm not here to establish a record
for marital hits and home runs.

1502
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:58,244
But I'm here to mete out justice
to the best of my ability...

1503
01:46:58,417 --> 01:47:00,112
...from the evidence presented.

1504
01:47:00,286 --> 01:47:02,117
Your wife and her attorney were here...

1505
01:47:02,288 --> 01:47:05,052
...and they gave their testimony
as to your negligence.

1506
01:47:05,224 --> 01:47:07,692
- But, Your Honor...
- Your negligence and indifference...

1507
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:09,191
...as a husband.

1508
01:47:09,361 --> 01:47:12,728
Why, they even indicated
that you were writing a symphony.

1509
01:47:14,366 --> 01:47:16,698
Oh, that. That was months ago.
I didn't even finish it.

1510
01:47:16,869 --> 01:47:18,962
- Good.
- I beg your pardon?

1511
01:47:19,138 --> 01:47:20,628
Oh, nothing, nothing.

1512
01:47:20,806 --> 01:47:25,573
At the conclusion of their testimony,
I was obliged to render a decision.

1513
01:47:25,744 --> 01:47:29,976
The only decision I could that would
be right under the circumstances.

1514
01:47:30,149 --> 01:47:32,379
But there's only one circumstance,
I love her.

1515
01:47:32,551 --> 01:47:36,385
Well, I'm very sorry,
but the case is entirely out of my hands.

1516
01:47:46,232 --> 01:47:48,928
Step on it. Drive like a maniac.
I've gotta catch her.

1517
01:47:49,101 --> 01:47:50,466
Catch her? You just left her.

1518
01:47:50,636 --> 01:47:53,002
- No, I was too late.
- Oh.

1519
01:47:54,673 --> 01:47:56,402
Say, won't this thing go any faster?

1520
01:47:56,575 --> 01:47:59,738
What do you mean? We're going 92 now.

1521
01:47:59,912 --> 01:48:02,176
Oh, that's 29.

1522
01:48:03,883 --> 01:48:05,612
Hey, there's Buddy's car. Stop.

1523
01:48:08,254 --> 01:48:10,484
Back up. Hurry up.

1524
01:48:17,196 --> 01:48:19,096
What do you want me to do,
go in sideways?

1525
01:48:19,265 --> 01:48:21,256
I don't care.

1526
01:48:31,343 --> 01:48:33,072
- Marilyn?
- Why, Eddie Cranes.

1527
01:48:33,245 --> 01:48:35,509
- Where have you been?
- Where did you come from?

1528
01:48:35,681 --> 01:48:37,615
- South America.
- Leave your boat outside?

1529
01:48:37,783 --> 01:48:39,250
- Where's Dixie?
- On the terrace.

1530
01:48:39,418 --> 01:48:43,411
- She wanted to be alone for a minute.
- Well, she isn't gonna be.

1531
01:48:52,731 --> 01:48:54,426
Dixie.

1532
01:48:55,067 --> 01:48:58,594
- Eddie.
- Oh, darling.

1533
01:49:00,439 --> 01:49:02,134
Edward Crane.

1534
01:49:02,308 --> 01:49:04,970
What do you mean rushing in
and scaring me half to death?

1535
01:49:05,144 --> 01:49:07,408
Do you realize I haven't seen you
for six months?

1536
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:09,844
Oh, I've been wrong, darling,
I know it.

1537
01:49:10,015 --> 01:49:12,609
But I'm cured now.
You gotta take me back.

1538
01:49:13,419 --> 01:49:14,886
Well, isn't this kind of sudden?

1539
01:49:15,054 --> 01:49:17,318
Don't you think you might do
a little explaining?

1540
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:21,189
Well, I went away alone.
This time I had to be sure.

1541
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,759
I am now, honest.

1542
01:49:22,928 --> 01:49:26,091
People, songs, even pianos don't mean
a thing anymore, honey.

1543
01:49:26,265 --> 01:49:28,062
From now on, it's only you.

1544
01:49:28,234 --> 01:49:30,759
- Oh, Eddie, are you sure? It's been so...
- I'm positive.

1545
01:49:32,504 --> 01:49:33,869
I want you to marry me again.

1546
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:36,933
Well, haven't you heard?

1547
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:38,633
Hasn't anyone told you?

1548
01:49:38,811 --> 01:49:42,611
Yes, but that's a lot of nonsense, darling.
You still love me, don't you?

1549
01:49:44,116 --> 01:49:46,983
Oh, Eddie, I love you very much.

1550
01:49:47,152 --> 01:49:49,177
But I won't ever marry you again.

1551
01:49:49,355 --> 01:49:52,791
Darling, I can't stand it any longer.
I'm going crazy living alone.

1552
01:49:52,958 --> 01:49:55,688
You won't have to anymore.

1553
01:49:57,429 --> 01:49:59,488
Hey, wait a minute. We're not married.

1554
01:50:01,133 --> 01:50:02,566
- Eddie?
- Hm?

1555
01:50:02,735 --> 01:50:05,226
- Will you do me a favor?
- Mm-hm.

1556
01:50:05,738 --> 01:50:08,070
Will you keep right on thinking
we're not?

1557
01:50:13,245 --> 01:50:17,579
Oh, boy, that's a cue for a song
if I ever saw one.

1558
01:50:20,619 --> 01:50:23,918
<i>Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good</i>

1559
01:50:24,089 --> 01:50:28,753
<i>Oh, baby, be good to me</i>

1560
01:50:30,162 --> 01:50:33,620
<i>I am so awfully misunderstood</i>

1561
01:50:33,799 --> 01:50:38,862
<i>Oh, baby, be good to me</i>

1562
01:50:39,038 --> 01:50:43,475
<i>Oh, please have some pity</i>

1563
01:50:43,876 --> 01:50:48,074
<i>I'm all alone in this big city</i>

1564
01:50:48,247 --> 01:50:52,206
<i>I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood</i>

1565
01:50:52,384 --> 01:51:01,088
<i>So, lady, be good to me</i>
