1
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,219
India. This nation has such
a firm bond with its' people...

2
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:15,326
That Indians carry their
soil with them everywhere.

3
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:17,400
But their heart lives in India.

4
00:01:18,935 --> 00:01:21,028
Take for example, London...

5
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:25,674
A wealthy business family.

6
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:29,406
After 5 generations in London...

7
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,039
But their eldest son's
heart and body...

8
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:38,516
...resides in a corner of
London called a mini India.

9
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,302
He is the eldest son
called Hari Mayur.

10
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:07,909
According to him, his father's
philosophy of earning more money...

11
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:16,256
...is sinful but spending money
on Indians in difficulty is good.

12
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:26,166
When the father started going
crazy getting son cured abroad...

13
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:30,072
He decided on the Indian cure.

14
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:34,210
The crazy son to be bound
by the chords of marriage!

15
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:42,013
To escape punishment, Hari banged
his head at his grandma's feet.

16
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:45,210
But how could she hear?

17
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:50,755
Bismillah Khan's music
echoed in her ears.

18
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:56,526
And she tied the groom's turban
on her darling grandson's head.

19
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:24,455
He has escaped to India.

20
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:02,764
The man who gave his heart to India...

21
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:06,368
Even sacrificed his life for it.

22
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:15,938
But who can harm the one
the Lord Himself protects.

23
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:21,275
Near the coast of Bombay,
Hari was found unconscious by a kid.

24
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:27,654
Sister, this man is not dead!

25
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:44,039
She looked after him so well...

26
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:46,702
That he regained consciousness soon.

27
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:50,842
On opening his eyes,
his ears heard this news.

28
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:54,245
The fish in the sea
ate up his corpse.

29
00:04:54,317 --> 00:04:56,649
As a result the search
was being called off.

30
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:00,348
And his death is being
announced in the papers.

31
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:04,720
On hearing of his death,
Hari decided...

32
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:09,991
...Not to inform his
family of his being alive.

33
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:14,828
Or he'd be hanged by the
marriage garland again.

34
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,878
So he made his death his life.

35
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,574
And decided to live
in his dear India

36
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:32,147
Stranger...

37
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:39,228
And Atariya, who had worked day
and night to give him a new life...

38
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:44,533
He decided to spend the
rest of his life with her.

39
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,856
Can't your launch go any faster?

40
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:22,227
Drive fast. Nandlal is coming home.

41
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,424
- Who is he?
- Drive fast!

42
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:38,173
What's the problem today?

43
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:43,648
Don't call him a problem!
Nandlal is coming home today!

44
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:47,413
- Where are you running off?
- Nandlal is coming home!

45
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:54,256
- Sister!
- My Birju has come!

46
00:07:55,898 --> 00:07:58,128
- Where is he?
- Who?

47
00:07:58,234 --> 00:08:00,134
My Nandlal.

48
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:07,474
Silly girl! He is here.
He'll come after a month.

49
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:11,004
A whole month!

50
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,479
Then why did you call me
back early from school?

51
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:15,116
Have you forgotten?
Today is the Diwali fair.

52
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:24,984
In your joy for Nandlal,
you forgot to kiss me today.

53
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,653
Sister!

54
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:36,529
He's saying something to me.

55
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:40,107
Really? You talk to him.

56
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,243
My exams will start in a month.

57
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:48,712
It will be very difficult.
Why don't you arrive early?

58
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,249
That's enough. Go and wash up.
I'll serve dinner.

59
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:02,355
- Have you discussed with
your husband? - What?

60
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:06,501
- Nandlal is mine.
- Why don't you tell him?

61
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:09,867
- Where is he?
- He doesn't live in our world.

62
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:14,034
He's always in his own world.
Must be somewhere there.

63
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:27,417
Save my baby!

64
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:29,924
I'm coming!

65
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,433
She was pregnant!

66
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:20,039
Gently.

67
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,282
I've already told you.

68
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,587
If you don't get her treated now
her life will be in danger.

69
00:15:42,798 --> 00:15:44,288
I said, no!

70
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:48,096
No! Don't touch! Go away!

71
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:49,795
He's mad!

72
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,498
I'm coming to you.

73
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:01,078
I'm going.

74
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:06,883
I don't want to leave you.
I'm very frightened.

75
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,789
- I don't want to go.
- I won't let you even if you want to.

76
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:16,292
I didn't swear to always
be with you for nothing.

77
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,557
Don't cry.

78
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:26,736
Did I ever tell you I don't
like your nose, eyes, ears?

79
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:30,237
Your smile captivated me.

80
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:34,983
And if you always want
me to be with you...

81
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:37,948
Then always keep smiling.

82
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,511
Smile.

83
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:47,026
That's it. Now I won't
let you ever go away.

84
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:31,503
He's my Nandlal. Give him to me.

85
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:36,877
I swear I had asked sister
for him even before he was born.

86
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:40,448
And she had agreed.
He is mine. Give him to me.

87
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:45,179
I told you not to bother us.
Troubling the hospital for 3 days!

88
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:47,413
But he's mine!

89
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:05,405
She's not letting me see him!

90
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:14,207
Who is the child's
closest relative?

91
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,988
Forget about relations,
he knew nobody at all!

92
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:24,048
The child's mother has one
innocent little sister.

93
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:28,459
- And this man...
- I was living off her.

94
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:32,622
I can't eke out a living for myself.
How will I bring up a child?

95
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:37,996
What will happen to the child?
We must admit him to an orphanage.

96
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:46,371
Come with me. I'll have him
admitted to a good orphanage.

97
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,220
No!

98
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:05,629
Give the line to Sevakram.

99
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,999
Catch her! She's running
away with the child!

100
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:17,642
- Stop! What are you doing?
- I won't let you take him away!

101
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,447
Catch the girl!

102
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:26,177
- Where are you taking him?
- I'll bring him up.

103
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:38,198
Be careful! The baby!

104
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,063
I'll die but not give him up!

105
00:19:58,187 --> 00:20:01,020
Do you want to die?
What if you'd come under the car?

106
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,555
People give birth to kids
but can't look after them!

107
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,361
Let's go there and see.

108
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,871
We've looked everywhere
but there's no sign of her.

109
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,905
Lord! Only you can help.

110
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:30,051
Take the baby in your refuge.

111
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:32,569
She's the youngest
mother in the world.

112
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:35,148
The Lord is truly strange.

113
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:37,549
All of us are indebted
to that person.

114
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:41,315
Weren't you given lots of money?

115
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,382
We must hold that man's
child close to our hearts.

116
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,290
Can't we look after him?

117
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,958
She is not here.

118
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,326
- Where is she?
- Where is Kalva?

119
00:21:58,507 --> 00:22:01,772
Get up and sit. Where are
Bijuriya and the baby?

120
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,173
- Must be in.
- They are not in!

121
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:10,951
Not in? Then why are you asking me
where she is? Go and look for her!

122
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,714
Maybe she's in trouble.

123
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:36,439
Milk has come. Drink it.

124
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:09,435
First you wet yourself. Then you cry.

125
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:11,873
I'm almost done.

126
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,624
See, I made you a new diaper!

127
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,475
You're almost clean.

128
00:23:44,713 --> 00:23:46,340
There, almost done.

129
00:28:22,224 --> 00:28:24,089
Give me a kiss.

130
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,860
You're 16? Wrong!

131
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:32,564
Never forget your position!

132
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:38,904
I have 1707 ships across the seas
obeying my orders

133
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:41,969
But do I ever forget my position?

134
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,676
I was always the porter
who worked for 7 annas a day.

135
00:28:44,713 --> 00:28:49,275
And so I'll always remain.
So never forget your position.

136
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:52,681
Quote a price for your position.

137
00:28:53,488 --> 00:28:56,184
First look after your own price!

138
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,360
The porter, finished!

139
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:09,327
Count your money later
First pay me my dues.

140
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:13,602
Go back. Your latest fan, Bheem
Khalasi must be waiting for you.

141
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:16,873
- That dog?
- He's a jewel.

142
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:19,305
He can turn you to gold with a touch.

143
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:23,006
Send your mother and sister to him.
Double earnings! Give my money!

144
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:24,018
No!

145
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:28,314
Nandu has to go for a
picnic tomorrow. Give it.

146
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:31,717
Took the rascal's name.
I know everything.

147
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,460
He's the reason you're
not marrying me.

148
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:38,862
If you talk like this about
my Nandu, I'll spit and walk out.

149
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:41,595
Out of your beer bar
and your life!

150
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,136
Where are you going?
I'll pay you off.

151
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:47,300
First give me a kiss.

152
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:51,076
The Lord gave you a kick!
That's what happens.

153
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:54,044
Not the Lord, somebody below.

154
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:56,774
- I'll sort him out!
- Give this here.

155
00:30:30,885 --> 00:30:32,716
Escaped!

156
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:37,084
Dog!

157
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:45,697
I forgot to light your lamp.

158
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:53,038
My Bijuriya is in danger.

159
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:57,869
She has to dance because of me.

160
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:05,249
Yes, listen to this.
I had a beautiful dream last night.

161
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,548
Know what? I saw Bijuriya dressed
as a bride in a shimmering saree.

162
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:13,790
I won't lie to you.

163
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:20,366
People say you make all the matches.

164
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:28,337
If the one you've chosen
for her would be found...

165
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:33,809
The devotee hadn't even finished
saying what was in his mind.

166
00:31:33,982 --> 00:31:36,542
That the Lord started
showing his glory.

167
00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:42,451
Hari's younger brother, Vikram
did such wonders in business...

168
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:48,720
That he was honoured by the
Europe Business Association.

169
00:31:49,297 --> 00:31:53,165
His name was being
discussed everywhere.

170
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:11,074
We'll interview him but
first we congratulate him.

171
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:14,979
He's the first Indian...

172
00:32:16,357 --> 00:32:18,655
I'm British.

173
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,060
I'm not Indian.

174
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:34,440
When your parents
came here from India...

175
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:45,151
- He didn't come.
- Then?

176
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,957
He ran away to save his life.

177
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,992
What danger did he face?

178
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:57,961
Of unemployment and hunger which
is the trademark of India.

179
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,598
But England looked
after us so well...

180
00:33:04,772 --> 00:33:05,238
...that even today
we are appreciated.

181
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:08,902
And counted among one of
the biggest business houses.

182
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:15,906
Then why did your elder brother
Hari discard it all and go to India?

183
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:20,617
He wanted to go to India.

184
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:25,119
He had to pay for it with his life.

185
00:33:26,094 --> 00:33:30,326
The plane crashed
before it reached India.

186
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:36,896
In any case, a Mayur and
India can never be united.

187
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:45,435
India and Mayur will now unite.

188
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,171
Found the picture of Hari's family!

189
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:51,080
Let's go and quickly tell Bijuriya.

190
00:33:51,252 --> 00:33:55,211
That her Nandu is heir
to a millionaire family!

191
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,085
They think his plane
crashed into the sea.

192
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:00,957
And fish ate his corpse.

193
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:05,898
Hari used to eat fish day and night.

194
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:11,098
- So? - So why didn't he inform
his family of his being alive?

195
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:14,030
Sit down and think.

196
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,971
That is right.

197
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:21,175
Maybe there's some family enmity...

198
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:23,908
Or worse secrets.

199
00:34:24,352 --> 00:34:27,719
That is why we can't
tell her anything.

200
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:29,853
I'll meet him and find out...

201
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:32,223
What is Vikram Mayur?

202
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:36,420
He is wealthy and what are we?
How will we meet him?

203
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:39,861
Watch the drama.

204
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:43,102
How I get the sky down to earth!

205
00:34:43,171 --> 00:34:45,366
In the High Commission of London...

206
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:50,335
I'll frame such a case of
cheating and deception...

207
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:52,809
That he'll come dancing!

208
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:14,632
No greetings from India?

209
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:23,907
It's old age.

210
00:35:33,788 --> 00:35:38,282
Don't do that son. He's come
to our house. Meet him.

211
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:42,755
He must have come t bother me
about the request to honour me.

212
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:49,325
Not to honour you but to
give you the court summons.

213
00:35:52,273 --> 00:35:57,040
A case has been filed on
Mayur and Mayur from India.

214
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:26,435
- Excuse us for...
- I don't excuse.

215
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:30,200
Why don't you tell me what this is?

216
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:35,407
What this is? This is your India.

217
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:41,051
The company that is being
garlanded by the world...

218
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:47,494
Your India has congratulated
that same Mayur and Mayur.

219
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:57,300
And the name quoted is
of my departed elder brother.

220
00:36:57,638 --> 00:37:00,038
Our Hari?

221
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:04,077
Yes, and the case is that Hari...

222
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:10,884
...trapped a man and
started a business.

223
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:15,612
And on purpose he pushed
the firm to bankruptcy.

224
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:22,859
But Hari's plane crashed
before reaching India.

225
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,133
I'll go to India.

226
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:44,481
This is a matter of our prestige
and my departed brother's soul.

227
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,251
I'll go to India myself.

228
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:09,700
Look there!

229
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:18,780
Remove your hands!

230
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:44,201
Who is come? Come on.

231
00:38:59,627 --> 00:39:02,790
Hurry up or this man will
turn the case upside down.

232
00:39:02,997 --> 00:39:06,433
He's probably done so already!

233
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:09,798
Have a betel leaf.

234
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:14,303
This is Mahowa betel leaf!

235
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:20,173
If you come to India and not
have this, you don't know India.

236
00:39:20,348 --> 00:39:23,078
I don't even want to know India!

237
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:26,549
The only one I want to meet
is the rascal Madadgar!

238
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:30,850
Your slave is called Madadgar.

239
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:48,735
That brother Hari didn't
die in the accident...

240
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:54,244
He lived here for years and
didn't tell anyone who he is.

241
00:39:54,582 --> 00:39:57,779
Nor did he inform us
that he's alive.

242
00:39:58,419 --> 00:40:02,981
He ran away from wedding there
and got married on coming here.

243
00:40:03,558 --> 00:40:06,049
That too with an Indian woman!

244
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:11,360
He fell in love with an Indian
girl so the marriage was lucky.

245
00:40:11,832 --> 00:40:17,793
He sired such a beautiful son
that the moon would feel shy.

246
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:26,912
Brother Hari has a son?

247
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:29,541
Yes and he's 8 years old.

248
00:40:31,686 --> 00:40:34,712
And his aunt looks after him
with all her heart and soul.

249
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:40,060
If you wish to see him, I'll try
to take permission from the aunt.

250
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:42,322
What do you mean, wish to see?

251
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:48,561
My grandmother's life is just
automation after his death.

252
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,205
That child will bring back
her smile.

253
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,766
If brother Hari had a son,
he is Master Mayur.

254
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:01,204
- He is ours.
- Of course the boy is yours.

255
00:41:01,616 --> 00:41:03,140
But he is looked after by the aunt.

256
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:07,550
So we have to ask her.

257
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:16,953
- What does she do?
- His aunt...

258
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:26,202
I asked what she does.

259
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:28,239
- What she does?
- Yes.

260
00:41:28,776 --> 00:41:32,872
Every day and night of her life...

261
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:37,814
...is sacrificed in bringing up
the torch of your family name.

262
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,954
From where did you give
birth to a stupid uncle?

263
00:41:41,055 --> 00:41:44,320
- He's a cheat!
- He can't be a cheat.

264
00:41:44,492 --> 00:41:48,087
Look carefully. The two brothers
are years apart from each other.

265
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:51,865
But they are similar. Have a look.

266
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:04,970
Which monkey are you matching
with my princely brother-in-law?

267
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:10,147
He looks like a cheat,
a thorough gangster!

268
00:42:10,351 --> 00:42:14,117
I must complain against him
and have him locked up.

269
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:18,484
- I'm off to the police...
- Take a breath child. Sit.

270
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:24,091
He is your poor Nandu's
millionaire uncle.

271
00:42:24,932 --> 00:42:29,392
Your innocent Nandu belongs
to such a wealthy family.

272
00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:34,170
Listen to me and let
him see him just once.

273
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:40,007
What will one meeting do?
He's like the angel of death!

274
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:44,545
Till I send him back,
I'll keep meeting him.

275
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:46,745
When do I arrange the meeting?

276
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:48,080
I'm in a hurry.

277
00:42:48,222 --> 00:42:53,182
My heart is beating so fast.

278
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:58,598
Driving me mad!
I hope you haven't told him...

279
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:02,227
I scream my guts out
and dance in a beer bar!

280
00:43:02,503 --> 00:43:09,739
No, dear. I've built up your image
so well that he's coming to see you.

281
00:43:09,944 --> 00:43:13,812
Will you show that pain
the way to my house too?

282
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:17,848
You called this pain from abroad.
So you take him to your house!

283
00:43:18,152 --> 00:43:21,610
At 5 o'clock sharp.

284
00:43:24,592 --> 00:43:26,253
Are you ready?

285
00:43:30,164 --> 00:43:34,726
Do you look like a
full, complete, queen?

286
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:38,999
What can I say?
You look like a prostitute!

287
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:43,174
Wear your driver's dress.

288
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:47,206
He's scared me even more.

289
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:55,955
This poor aunt of yours is
raising the heir to our family.

290
00:43:56,223 --> 00:44:02,093
Has she given you any idea of her
services? How much will she charge?

291
00:44:02,263 --> 00:44:04,527
No way sir.

292
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:10,428
I hope this is her.

293
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:20,472
Her royal majesty arrives.

294
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:35,557
Who is this queen?

295
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,027
- She's the aunt.
- I see.

296
00:44:46,173 --> 00:44:47,140
Bless me uncle.

297
00:44:47,408 --> 00:44:50,809
Have you come to meet him
or enact a drama at my house?

298
00:44:51,212 --> 00:44:53,976
I've come to blacken the face
of the trouble facing my baby!

299
00:44:54,348 --> 00:44:57,181
Move out of my way.
Where is that scoundrel?

300
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:03,789
Good God!

301
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:09,893
Greetings.

302
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:15,660
I apologize because you
had to wait long for me.

303
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,637
If you say, I'll fall at your feet.

304
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:27,375
I should be apologising.

305
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:29,345
But why?

306
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:35,417
I thought you'd be a poor, old...

307
00:45:35,823 --> 00:45:37,654
I am poor.

308
00:45:38,192 --> 00:45:43,994
But not so poor that I would
raise my eyes at my baby's rights.

309
00:45:48,636 --> 00:45:50,331
I understand you.

310
00:45:50,971 --> 00:45:54,566
You've come as his uncle
to claim his inheritance.

311
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:58,003
I'll pay a good sum by my price.

312
00:45:59,246 --> 00:46:02,807
- I don't understand.
- Then try to follow.

313
00:46:03,217 --> 00:46:06,186
I want the decision to be taken now.

314
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:08,785
Don't look towards my child!

315
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:14,393
If you wish, along with cash you
may take all these and make me nude...

316
00:46:14,795 --> 00:46:17,059
No, no nudity! Please.

317
00:46:18,766 --> 00:46:20,859
Yes, I am here.

318
00:46:21,168 --> 00:46:23,796
What's going on?

319
00:46:23,837 --> 00:46:28,274
- I don't understand.
- Neither will you.

320
00:46:35,616 --> 00:46:40,883
It's our good fortune that
the heir to the Mayur family...

321
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:45,151
...is being raised by a
great woman like you.

322
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,027
Thanks. So our decision is made.

323
00:46:50,631 --> 00:46:52,599
- I'll take leave.
- But why...?

324
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:58,137
We've just started talking.
What's the hurry?

325
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:01,337
Everybody will be waiting
for me at the palace.

326
00:47:01,475 --> 00:47:05,536
The sun is about to set.
I pray at this time.

327
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,111
- Isn't it uncle?
- Yes, 7 o'clock daily.

328
00:47:13,887 --> 00:47:17,254
When should I come to meet the kid?

329
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:21,520
- In your palace?
- Why will you meet the kid?

330
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:26,026
We've decided. The boy
will come to meet you.

331
00:47:28,702 --> 00:47:31,296
- When?
- Let him study and grow up.

332
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:36,608
What was the enmity between his
father and the Mayur family...

333
00:47:36,777 --> 00:47:40,235
That he threw away a rich inheritance?

334
00:47:40,848 --> 00:47:42,110
I'll explain everything.

335
00:47:42,316 --> 00:47:44,910
Don't bother. I won't
understand anything.

336
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:48,450
The nephew will come and
understand from the uncle.

337
00:47:48,622 --> 00:47:52,183
I've done my duty by coming here.

338
00:47:52,593 --> 00:47:56,393
Your highness, it's time for
your prayers in the palace.

339
00:47:56,663 --> 00:47:59,154
I think you should leave soon.

340
00:48:01,268 --> 00:48:05,068
If you've felt offended at
anything I said, I beg you...

341
00:48:08,075 --> 00:48:11,238
This garment is my foe.

342
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:28,991
Forgive me, sir.
You've been insulted in my house...

343
00:48:29,363 --> 00:48:33,322
Neither you nor I have
been insulted.

344
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:37,692
Her highness had no garment in this.

345
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:40,971
I mean no mistake.

346
00:48:41,308 --> 00:48:45,244
Hari had us do his death rituals.

347
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:49,039
And got married here.

348
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:05,698
Have mercy on that little one.

349
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:35,586
Master Mayur is with her.

350
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:38,253
We're grateful for that.

351
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:43,366
But she has a lot of wrong
notions about us in her mind.

352
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:46,362
I should meet and clear these.

353
00:49:47,374 --> 00:49:50,537
Please take me to meet her.

354
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:53,841
Now.

355
00:49:54,248 --> 00:49:56,216
What did you say?

356
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,713
What are you saying?

357
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:25,643
- Give me one.
- Here you are.

358
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:31,781
Where's it?

359
00:50:32,953 --> 00:50:35,547
- I just gave it to you.
- This is just a paper.

360
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:38,122
- But I passed it...
- Then where is it?

361
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,051
It's on my shoe!

362
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:28,066
I'm watching you for long!
Falling all over me!

363
00:51:28,342 --> 00:51:31,402
Do you have any mother or sister?

364
00:51:37,217 --> 00:51:38,809
Mind your basket.

365
00:51:42,155 --> 00:51:45,420
Can you tell me the way to
Her Highness Devirani's palace?

366
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:46,824
The queen of Jhansi?

367
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:53,666
We have only one queen.

368
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:57,065
Are you talking about her?

369
00:51:57,571 --> 00:52:00,335
When she walks...

370
00:52:02,776 --> 00:52:05,540
It feels as if Lord
Rama shot an arrow.

371
00:52:07,014 --> 00:52:12,418
Yes, her walk is special.

372
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:16,083
And her eyes...

373
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:22,218
One glance and
you're finished for life!

374
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:28,959
You are talking of her.
Where can I find her?

375
00:52:29,002 --> 00:52:33,632
She doesn't meet us
just gives appearances.

376
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:40,037
She exhibits her dance
at Banjo's den.

377
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,320
What are you doing?

378
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,124
Doesn't look where he's
walking and then acts smart!

379
00:52:56,163 --> 00:52:59,064
- Are you blind or me?
- Arguing! I'll show him!

380
00:53:22,689 --> 00:53:25,681
Calling me queen!

381
00:53:26,526 --> 00:53:29,984
Hey! See what he's doing!

382
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:47,246
Come here again and I'll slit you!

383
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:50,678
Cover yourself with this scarf.
I've told you so many times!

384
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:52,350
Everybody will stand to watch.

385
00:53:59,393 --> 00:54:02,920
Such a small place.
Such a big queen.

386
00:54:02,963 --> 00:54:06,091
Yet nobody knows of her.

387
00:54:09,569 --> 00:54:13,562
It's almost evening.
You're still wandering?

388
00:54:13,907 --> 00:54:17,843
Looks like some fruit cake
made a fruitcake out of you!

389
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:35,356
The 6 o'clock boat has gone.

390
00:54:35,395 --> 00:54:39,058
- I let it off.
- It's 5 o'clock.

391
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:41,430
How did you let a 6 o'clock
launch leave at 5 o'clock?

392
00:54:41,468 --> 00:54:45,336
It was full. Should I have
held on to it? Am I a fool?

393
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:50,140
I mean what time is the next launch?

394
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:51,870
At 4:30

395
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:57,810
It's 5 now. When will it be 4.30?

396
00:54:57,851 --> 00:54:59,819
- Tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning?

397
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:03,714
- What will I do till then?
- I don't know. I'll go to sleep.

398
00:55:08,728 --> 00:55:11,595
What Willis do now?
Grandma will call up.

399
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:15,258
Not finding me there, she'll worry.

400
00:55:17,604 --> 00:55:19,037
No cigarettes too.

401
00:55:23,877 --> 00:55:25,708
Who is it?

402
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:54,764
Sir, do you want to call abroad?

403
00:55:56,176 --> 00:55:59,168
Yes. Is there a place?

404
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:05,251
You need a place to sleep in.
I'll take you there.

405
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:17,723
Are you a big government officer?

406
00:56:17,931 --> 00:56:20,695
- I'm just...
- This way.

407
00:56:21,268 --> 00:56:23,236
Then what's your business?

408
00:56:23,503 --> 00:56:26,836
- A small business.
- Must be doing well.

409
00:56:27,007 --> 00:56:28,406
Yes, I manage.

410
00:56:34,915 --> 00:56:37,645
Do you live in London?

411
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:40,976
Just a minute, sir.

412
00:56:46,092 --> 00:56:48,856
- What are you doing here?
- He's my God.

413
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:53,388
He was on our way. How could
I leave without a prayer?

414
00:56:54,968 --> 00:56:56,435
Why don't you pay obeisance?

415
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:16,445
May I ask you something
if you won't feel offended?

416
00:57:17,057 --> 00:57:19,321
Are you married?

417
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:27,021
You're making so many
inquiries about me.

418
00:57:27,133 --> 00:57:29,431
Any girl in mind?

419
00:57:29,536 --> 00:57:34,872
Talking makes time pass easily.
We're already at the hotel.

420
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:42,409
You're a good kid.

421
00:57:45,018 --> 00:57:48,385
Do you want your brand of cigarette?

422
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:55,218
- How do you know?
- I polish shoes.

423
00:57:56,162 --> 00:58:00,758
Was that you? Under my feet?

424
00:58:02,235 --> 00:58:06,865
Don't you study, go to school?

425
00:58:07,507 --> 00:58:10,237
I get dressed to go to school
but I don't attend it.

426
00:58:11,077 --> 00:58:14,274
- Why?
- I have to collect lots of money.

427
00:58:14,514 --> 00:58:17,210
I'm in great trouble.

428
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:24,719
How much money do you need
to get over this trouble?

429
00:58:26,393 --> 00:58:28,327
I don't want money from you.

430
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:32,024
You asked me out of love
and I answered with love.

431
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:43,376
Don't you want the cigarette?

432
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:47,102
I do want it.

433
00:58:51,317 --> 00:58:52,716
I'll just be back!

434
00:58:57,691 --> 00:58:59,056
He's very generous.

435
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:01,989
I've given him two packets.

436
00:59:02,328 --> 00:59:05,297
He hasn't got married as yet.

437
00:59:05,765 --> 00:59:09,223
You know what's in my mind.

438
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:16,736
But I don't know what's in your mind.

439
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,387
What is it?

440
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:35,727
Do you get any beer here?

441
00:59:36,362 --> 00:59:38,660
You don't get beer here!
Decent people live here!

442
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:41,665
Go to Bombay if you want beer.

443
00:59:43,136 --> 00:59:48,164
I feel I've seen this
cartoon somewhere.

444
00:59:48,475 --> 00:59:51,376
But where have I seen him...?

445
00:59:54,647 --> 00:59:57,980
I just asked for a beer bar
and he... Mister Horse...

446
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,820
- Where's Bijuriya?
- Doing her show.

447
01:00:02,889 --> 01:00:04,516
How can she perform!

448
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:09,653
She's dead!

449
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:29,053
What's the meaning of this torn note?

450
01:04:29,188 --> 01:04:34,626
He said if madam wants the
other half, she must go to room

451
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:41,926
Got it! He didn't understand
when I explained as a rich woman.

452
01:04:42,835 --> 01:04:48,171
When I explain as a half note
woman, then he'll understand!

453
01:04:49,242 --> 01:04:51,369
You called me a prostitute?

454
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:56,881
But if you abuse me Nandu calling
him Master Mayur, it will be bad!

455
01:04:57,283 --> 01:05:02,414
The brother whose picture is on
the wall and you burn incense...

456
01:05:02,622 --> 01:05:05,989
Has that brother's 8 year
old son landed from the sky?

457
01:05:06,192 --> 01:05:08,626
Now he wants his Master Mayur!

458
01:05:09,462 --> 01:05:13,159
Will I shut up because you say so?

459
01:05:13,466 --> 01:05:18,870
Even if my Nandu is related to
you have you brought any proof?

460
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:22,202
Or just these rags of paper?
Where is your purse?

461
01:05:22,442 --> 01:05:23,875
Show me.

462
01:05:24,577 --> 01:05:27,205
Don't touch me!

463
01:05:27,914 --> 01:05:30,906
Don't be under any wrong ideas.

464
01:05:31,017 --> 01:05:36,512
As it is this half note has shrunk
your image to half in my eyes.

465
01:05:36,689 --> 01:05:39,920
And I'm full, completely honourable.

466
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:52,828
Honourable.

467
01:05:59,345 --> 01:06:02,143
In the world's dirtiest
room in the dirtiest hotel...

468
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:06,875
- You come for half a note...
- This is just a hotel.

469
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:11,520
I'll get into the flames of hell.

470
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:15,427
That too barefoot!
And if worse times come...

471
01:06:15,628 --> 01:06:21,260
I'll sacrifice my honour
for half a note!

472
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:23,825
On this very bed!

473
01:06:28,374 --> 01:06:31,070
What wrong notions are
you in? If I was that...

474
01:06:31,177 --> 01:06:35,409
What you think I am...
Wherever you'd be in the world...

475
01:06:35,548 --> 01:06:38,540
Any moment I wanted...

476
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:42,451
I'd have you on this bed!

477
01:06:43,422 --> 01:06:47,051
But I want my Master Mayur not you

478
01:06:49,028 --> 01:06:50,928
Do you understand?

479
01:06:56,702 --> 01:06:58,863
Your call to London.

480
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,505
It's me grandma. How are you?

481
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:14,413
I've never stayed without you.
I'm quite worried.

482
01:07:14,587 --> 01:07:16,987
What are you stuck for?

483
01:07:18,824 --> 01:07:22,282
I'm getting a priceless gift for you.

484
01:07:23,596 --> 01:07:26,258
I won't tell you. I'll show it.

485
01:07:26,332 --> 01:07:30,393
When you see it, you'll leave
your wheel chair and start dancing.

486
01:07:30,469 --> 01:07:34,132
- Give me a hint.
- Bless me grandma.

487
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,814
He's getting a bride!

488
01:07:53,459 --> 01:07:55,791
No, you can't go to school with me!

489
01:07:55,928 --> 01:07:58,920
All the boys will tease me.
I've grown up.

490
01:07:59,131 --> 01:08:03,397
You don't know.
There's trouble brewing!

491
01:08:03,803 --> 01:08:07,330
Once we clear this problem
you may travel on your own.

492
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,440
But now till I come, don't
step out of school. Got it?

493
01:08:11,611 --> 01:08:12,873
It hurts.

494
01:08:16,616 --> 01:08:20,052
He had to come now. You go
and see. Must be the egg seller.

495
01:08:20,253 --> 01:08:21,948
4 big loaves and 12 eggs

496
01:08:22,488 --> 01:08:26,015
Tell him one egg turned rotten
last time. First take that.

497
01:08:29,262 --> 01:08:31,127
4 big loaves and 12 eggs

498
01:08:32,331 --> 01:08:35,664
Yesterday's egg was rotten.
Give me a replacement.

499
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:40,698
Who gave you my address?

500
01:08:41,374 --> 01:08:44,275
You're funny. If the stuff
was bad, I'll replace it.

501
01:08:44,477 --> 01:08:48,004
I'll return your money.
But don't come home!

502
01:08:48,047 --> 01:08:50,811
Why are you standing here? Go.

503
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,943
Go away.

504
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:08,498
I'm talking to you!

505
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:27,182
How can I open my mouth before you?

506
01:09:27,353 --> 01:09:31,221
She embarrassed me so much
by masquerading as a queen that...

507
01:09:31,324 --> 01:09:36,626
I feel like digging a grave for
myself and lying down in it!

508
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:41,495
No need for you to bother.

509
01:09:41,934 --> 01:09:45,836
Your... she...

510
01:09:46,572 --> 01:09:53,273
Your actress asked me for proof
of master Mayur being my nephew.

511
01:09:56,849 --> 01:10:05,052
Now you'll get me brother Hari's
certified marriage certificates.

512
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:08,549
And Mayur's birth certificate
is not given to me...

513
01:10:08,594 --> 01:10:13,930
Then I'll dig your grave myself.

514
01:10:14,133 --> 01:10:16,567
And I'll bury you too.

515
01:10:16,736 --> 01:10:19,500
You've just asked for these.

516
01:10:19,772 --> 01:10:25,608
I'll get a mountain if you wish.

517
01:10:26,045 --> 01:10:32,382
I always greeted you as if you
were the lamp of her dark hut.

518
01:10:32,752 --> 01:10:34,879
And you burnt my house!

519
01:10:35,187 --> 01:10:38,850
- Think with a cool mind...
- What? There's no heart left!

520
01:10:39,225 --> 01:10:41,386
The cheating of law!

521
01:10:41,794 --> 01:10:46,424
You sold every decency
to that foreigner!

522
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:49,395
I had heard now I've seen it!

523
01:10:49,635 --> 01:10:55,130
There's an antidote for snake
bite but not a lawyer's sting!

524
01:10:55,508 --> 01:11:00,343
You are wrong child.
I did my duty as an uncle.

525
01:11:00,546 --> 01:11:02,980
I only asked the Mayur family...

526
01:11:03,349 --> 01:11:06,648
I've only asked for his legal right.

527
01:11:06,819 --> 01:11:09,151
To hell with your family rights!

528
01:11:09,422 --> 01:11:13,552
Here we're in difficulties
and you're worried about rights!

529
01:11:13,926 --> 01:11:20,331
This is a court order. You can't
stop Nandu from meeting his uncle.

530
01:11:20,733 --> 01:11:25,602
And if you stop us,
we'll have to arrest you.

531
01:11:25,805 --> 01:11:28,899
Yes, take me!
Where are the hand cuffs?

532
01:11:30,042 --> 01:11:32,670
What are you doing?
Don't you trust me?

533
01:11:32,945 --> 01:11:36,278
Listen. My hands and feet maybe cut.

534
01:11:36,515 --> 01:11:41,384
They may chop off my head.
But can they separate me from you?

535
01:11:43,022 --> 01:11:44,853
That's the police.
Don't say anything.

536
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:50,995
You know nothing. There's
a great conspiracy behind this.

537
01:11:51,664 --> 01:11:54,758
I'll handle it, you keep
quiet. Swear by me.

538
01:11:55,234 --> 01:11:58,499
If you speak now,
you'll see me dead!

539
01:12:01,373 --> 01:12:03,466
I won't speak.

540
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:11,616
I'm not scared. Let me too see from
where my uncle has landed suddenly.

541
01:12:15,888 --> 01:12:18,322
You spoke again?
I made you promise.

542
01:12:18,524 --> 01:12:23,518
I'm just advising you. If that
foreigner shakes your hand...

543
01:12:23,662 --> 01:12:28,065
Fold your hands and say
this is our culture. Got it?

544
01:12:29,835 --> 01:12:34,033
Don't touch any food he offers you.

545
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:37,306
- Say you're fasting.
- Okay.

546
01:12:38,544 --> 01:12:40,910
- Not even water.
- Okay.

547
01:12:42,815 --> 01:12:45,340
What a scene she's creating.

548
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:52,247
It's not a scene.
It's that Lord's miracle.

549
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:56,118
The work will be done soon.

550
01:12:56,595 --> 01:13:00,087
- Do one thing for me.
- Yes, grandma?

551
01:13:00,933 --> 01:13:04,630
Convey my love to your blessing.

552
01:13:06,539 --> 01:13:10,407
There's no blessing here.

553
01:13:15,648 --> 01:13:18,208
Here's what you wanted.

554
01:13:21,754 --> 01:13:23,312
Run!

555
01:13:43,075 --> 01:13:47,671
If I knew you were my uncle,
I wouldn't sell you cigarettes.

556
01:13:52,117 --> 01:13:55,951
Don't worry about anything now.

557
01:13:57,256 --> 01:14:03,126
I have little time and
lots to talk to you about.

558
01:14:04,997 --> 01:14:09,058
So I'll talk and you eat.

559
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:14,395
First promise not to tell Bijuriya
about my polish or cigarettes.

560
01:14:22,047 --> 01:14:26,848
- Actually that girl...
- Her name is Bijuriya.

561
01:14:38,731 --> 01:14:40,961
My baby's come!

562
01:14:46,472 --> 01:14:49,600
Why are you so late?
Didn't the rascal let you go?

563
01:14:50,342 --> 01:14:53,334
His name is not rascal
but Mister Vikram Mayur.

564
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:57,909
And he's my real uncle!

565
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:02,147
Real uncle! Didn't even
give you one toffee!

566
01:15:08,627 --> 01:15:10,527
What's all this?

567
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:13,658
How do I know? I haven't seen it.

568
01:15:13,866 --> 01:15:15,595
- He packed it along.
- Given for you!

569
01:15:15,768 --> 01:15:20,102
- Put it in my carriage.
- Come.

570
01:15:20,172 --> 01:15:22,470
It's all ours!

571
01:15:43,896 --> 01:15:47,354
My sweet is up? Wash up
I'll rustle up breakfast.

572
01:15:47,533 --> 01:15:50,696
How can I get up?
Give me my gown.

573
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:07,139
Who used my soap?

574
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:12,372
My hands were dirty so I...

575
01:16:12,414 --> 01:16:14,939
You're so big yet you don't know...

576
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:18,053
You shouldn't use anybody's
comb, towel or soap!

577
01:16:18,087 --> 01:16:23,115
Sorry. Don't spoil your
mood. I'll wash it for you.

578
01:16:23,692 --> 01:16:26,718
That's the limit!
Is a soap ever washed?

579
01:16:26,829 --> 01:16:31,823
Soap washes things. You keep
this. I'll bathe in the hotel.

580
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:35,534
What will uncle think
of you if he hears?

581
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:25,318
Didn't recognise me?

582
01:17:27,322 --> 01:17:28,914
I'm your Nandu!

583
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:33,889
Even I didn't know I'm master Mayur.

584
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:40,531
I've got so much wealth that
I can make you into gold.

585
01:17:41,637 --> 01:17:45,004
But I hope you remember my request.

586
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:51,207
I have an appointment
with uncle for dinner.

587
01:18:12,467 --> 01:18:16,130
Not that way. You don't play
the band with a fork and knife.

588
01:18:16,538 --> 01:18:18,096
I'll show you.

589
01:18:18,874 --> 01:18:21,536
Uncle said, you must
pick up food as if...

590
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:26,804
The spoon touches the plate
and makes gentle music.

591
01:18:30,118 --> 01:18:32,552
You can never learn to eat!

592
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:38,022
You eat the normal way!

593
01:18:56,645 --> 01:19:01,139
I've got this cassette specially
for you all the way from London.

594
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:03,744
What's special about it?

595
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:10,585
You will see it and
tell me what it is!

596
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:21,296
This is the palace of
the queen of England.

597
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:24,433
This is Mayur Mansion.

598
01:19:27,242 --> 01:19:29,073
Not of the queen.

599
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:32,347
This is your house.

600
01:19:46,728 --> 01:19:49,356
This is your bedroom.

601
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:51,824
You'll sleep here.

602
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:55,930
This is your dining room.

603
01:19:56,638 --> 01:19:57,900
Your study.

604
01:19:59,207 --> 01:20:04,008
- How did you like it?
- It didn't appear real.

605
01:20:04,746 --> 01:20:06,407
It all felt like a dream.

606
01:20:08,216 --> 01:20:13,586
If you come with me,
all your dreams will come true.

607
01:20:15,324 --> 01:20:18,225
But how can I come with you?

608
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:22,358
Why can't you come with me?

609
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:26,896
I told you I had a problem.

610
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:39,310
I remember but you never
told me what that problem is.

611
01:20:44,953 --> 01:20:49,390
Don't worry. I'm your uncle.

612
01:20:51,526 --> 01:20:54,962
I have to get Bijuriya married.

613
01:20:59,968 --> 01:21:02,937
- What do you have to do?
- Get her married.

614
01:21:14,783 --> 01:21:17,911
You've been selling whisky
and cigarettes for this?

615
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,283
And polishing shoes on roads...

616
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:26,689
The money is good in Bombay
Plus I get to see boys.

617
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:34,931
And while working I find out
a lot about them and get paid.

618
01:21:40,575 --> 01:21:43,942
But the moment they find out...

619
01:21:44,045 --> 01:21:47,242
She dances that dirty dance
in Banjo's beer bar...

620
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:52,182
They don't show their face.
In addition don't even pay me!

621
01:21:57,559 --> 01:22:00,926
Do you know what you're doing?

622
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:03,663
Getting my Bijuriya settled.

623
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,094
You're ruining your life.

624
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:19,539
These are your days of
studying and playing.

625
01:22:19,948 --> 01:22:25,682
Once I get her married,
I'll enjoy all my life.

626
01:22:28,857 --> 01:22:32,020
How will you get her married?

627
01:22:32,227 --> 01:22:36,220
I won't do it. I pray
to a God every Monday.

628
01:22:36,431 --> 01:22:40,731
He'll do it, I light his lamp.

629
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:47,335
Had it! Talking to you,
I forgot today is prayer day.

630
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:50,071
I'm going.

631
01:23:07,229 --> 01:23:12,531
That girl should be given the
court summons now before sunset!

632
01:23:15,303 --> 01:23:20,400
I can't tolerate my master Mayur
staying with her for one minute!

633
01:23:24,112 --> 01:23:26,580
She has no character.

634
01:23:26,615 --> 01:23:28,947
Super vagabond!

635
01:23:56,611 --> 01:23:58,101
- Where is she?
- Who, sir?

636
01:23:58,446 --> 01:24:01,847
Who has just turned 16!
Where is she?

637
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:05,842
We're in Goa sir.
She lives in Bombay.

638
01:24:09,891 --> 01:24:12,416
I'm in Goa and she's in Bombay!

639
01:24:12,827 --> 01:24:14,818
Turn the ship back now!

640
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:22,694
- Turn back now!
- Turn back now!

641
01:24:30,211 --> 01:24:33,408
What has come home today?

642
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:37,209
I beg you, fall at your feet.

643
01:24:37,686 --> 01:24:40,519
Stop showing me the stars.

644
01:24:40,555 --> 01:24:44,616
You've got me stamped as a
vagabond by the government!

645
01:24:45,327 --> 01:24:48,626
This is the notice from
that cheat uncle of Nandu's!

646
01:24:48,997 --> 01:24:53,434
I have no character, a vagabond
so he'll take my child away!

647
01:24:54,035 --> 01:24:57,493
Let me see. Why do
you worry when I'm here?

648
01:24:57,772 --> 01:25:00,832
All the worries rose because of you!

649
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:03,567
You take all our news
to that foreigner!

650
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:06,205
And put our lives in danger!

651
01:25:06,448 --> 01:25:09,679
- What are you saying? I...
- Now you be quiet.

652
01:25:10,218 --> 01:25:14,882
You're a man of God.
What can you do but pray?

653
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:20,760
Now hear me out! Got rid
of brother for property!

654
01:25:21,196 --> 01:25:23,994
Now he wants to take away
my Nandu and parcel him off.

655
01:25:24,032 --> 01:25:26,762
But he hasn't dealt with me!

656
01:25:26,868 --> 01:25:32,397
I'll file a complain against
his whole family at Chinchpokli!

657
01:25:32,807 --> 01:25:35,469
I'll file a case against that rascal!

658
01:25:36,044 --> 01:25:37,807
Yes, write.

659
01:25:38,546 --> 01:25:44,075
He blew up a bomb in a ship.

660
01:25:44,452 --> 01:25:48,912
And write my Nandu should
get his share, right here!

661
01:25:49,424 --> 01:25:50,789
And in cash!

662
01:25:51,059 --> 01:25:55,086
He'll grind the mill
in prison all his life!

663
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:58,925
It's only the rich who file cases.

664
01:25:59,167 --> 01:26:02,398
Your house will be sold
settling the case.

665
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:07,836
The poor don't file cases.
They attack.

666
01:26:09,644 --> 01:26:10,702
What do you mean?

667
01:26:10,845 --> 01:26:14,144
I mean he was half infatuated when...

668
01:26:14,182 --> 01:26:21,987
You masqueraded as a queen
and slipped your garment down.

669
01:26:22,857 --> 01:26:27,351
What do you imply?

670
01:26:27,929 --> 01:26:34,767
He lost his senses so much
that he couldn't sleep at night.

671
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:40,668
And he kept wandering in his
Juliet's village like a Romeo.

672
01:26:41,009 --> 01:26:48,415
Leave prison mills, if you want
he'll grind flour for you forever!

673
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:54,878
What you say holds water.

674
01:26:55,890 --> 01:27:00,259
You're pouring water on my efforts!

675
01:27:00,595 --> 01:27:03,393
You're chopping off your
own feet with an axe!

676
01:27:03,565 --> 01:27:09,561
Please keep your water, your
axe and havoc to yourself!

677
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:14,531
I'll take my master Mayur with me!

678
01:27:15,143 --> 01:27:17,839
That's what I want.

679
01:27:18,046 --> 01:27:20,241
But how will you take him?

680
01:27:20,548 --> 01:27:26,180
The child who sees his mother
being maligned dies needlessly!

681
01:27:27,355 --> 01:27:32,224
I did tell you that they
are 2 bodies but one life.

682
01:27:32,761 --> 01:27:37,198
Ad you can take the child
with you with a smile.

683
01:27:40,869 --> 01:27:45,169
So you've brought me
a proposal from her?

684
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:56,449
I haven't brought
any proposal from her.

685
01:27:56,518 --> 01:27:59,783
I've come to tell you of
a solution from my heart.

686
01:28:00,088 --> 01:28:07,426
You can call her and lovingly...

687
01:28:11,065 --> 01:28:13,795
She herself couldn't express it well.

688
01:28:13,835 --> 01:28:17,430
We share a father and
daughter relationship.

689
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:22,041
Did she send you to say anything?

690
01:28:22,177 --> 01:28:25,874
She didn't say anything.
Just told me a joke.

691
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:37,757
The day she came to meet you,
she thought you'd be an old uncle.

692
01:28:38,593 --> 01:28:42,029
But you turned out to be a prince!

693
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:44,423
And the king of business!

694
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:47,493
She saw you and grew nervous!

695
01:28:47,769 --> 01:28:52,900
So nervous that she meant
something but said another.

696
01:28:53,241 --> 01:28:58,338
If she hadn't run away,
she'd have fallen at your feet.

697
01:29:00,849 --> 01:29:05,479
She was preparing her trap
for me right from day one!

698
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:10,523
How she threw her sari off...

699
01:29:20,268 --> 01:29:23,704
You've given me a brilliant idea.

700
01:29:24,138 --> 01:29:30,668
To save master Mayur from her
I'll have to get trapped first.

701
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:34,510
And show him her true colours.

702
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:41,985
It will create so much hatred in
his heart that he'll forget her.

703
01:29:42,724 --> 01:29:47,821
Now watch how I sort her out.

704
01:29:48,062 --> 01:29:52,328
Forgive me. It's not that.

705
01:29:52,934 --> 01:29:55,494
- Whatever.
- So begin!

706
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:09,047
Have you understood?

707
01:30:10,551 --> 01:30:12,815
What did you say your name was?

708
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:14,946
What's the matter?

709
01:30:16,891 --> 01:30:20,327
Sir, my moustache and my name...

710
01:30:20,361 --> 01:30:22,090
It's my life.

711
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:25,922
Nobody can forget my name!

712
01:30:26,067 --> 01:30:30,367
- You must not forget. Please.
- Don't do that.

713
01:30:34,042 --> 01:30:37,011
From brewing liquor to
setting a village aflame...

714
01:30:37,211 --> 01:30:39,475
There's nothing I can't do.

715
01:30:39,914 --> 01:30:44,214
Nobody in my family ever died
of a rascal doctor's medicine.

716
01:30:45,019 --> 01:30:47,317
They died but how...?

717
01:30:47,722 --> 01:30:50,816
By a bullet or AK 47 gun.

718
01:30:51,592 --> 01:30:52,923
Very good.

719
01:30:53,928 --> 01:30:55,623
The Lord's blessings.

720
01:30:56,331 --> 01:30:58,231
Why do you keep bending?
Stand straight.

721
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:01,692
I want to know your plan.

722
01:31:02,203 --> 01:31:05,468
Plan? Stand right here.

723
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:09,303
When she's dancing tonight...

724
01:31:09,544 --> 01:31:11,239
- The lights will go off.
- Why?

725
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:15,443
It happens. I'll bring a
screaming Bijuriya out.

726
01:31:15,783 --> 01:31:17,842
You'll come to save her.

727
01:31:18,152 --> 01:31:20,916
And I'll give you a punch.

728
01:31:21,422 --> 01:31:23,322
Don't be scared.

729
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:27,624
I'll put her in the jeep
and take her away.

730
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,523
Where are you taking her?

731
01:31:30,565 --> 01:31:37,334
You take a motorcycle, start it.

732
01:31:41,275 --> 01:31:43,266
I got it.

733
01:31:44,779 --> 01:31:47,475
And then in great style...

734
01:31:49,217 --> 01:31:55,918
Then you say, Don't you dare!
Rascals! Vile dogs! Scoundrels!

735
01:31:55,957 --> 01:31:59,324
I'll gouge out your eyes
if you look at her!

736
01:32:01,529 --> 01:32:04,555
Then I'll get out a knife.

737
01:32:05,166 --> 01:32:06,497
Hold it.

738
01:32:07,402 --> 01:32:12,669
And say, this is a knife,
not a toy for children.

739
01:32:13,141 --> 01:32:16,406
If it cuts you, blood spurts.

740
01:32:18,513 --> 01:32:22,472
Then one of my men will say
but who are you?

741
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:29,712
Your death!

742
01:32:31,692 --> 01:32:33,523
Your death!

743
01:32:34,128 --> 01:32:36,892
What dialogue delivery!

744
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:40,360
This is very silly!
I can't say these dialogues.

745
01:32:40,401 --> 01:32:42,232
Take this back.

746
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:48,572
If you say all this,
she'll be a slave at your feet!

747
01:32:48,643 --> 01:32:50,975
Stand straight, don't go down!

748
01:32:51,546 --> 01:32:54,743
- What is slave at your feet?
- That means...

749
01:32:55,116 --> 01:32:57,983
She'll do something sinful
as devotion if you say.

750
01:32:58,519 --> 01:32:59,816
No sin and no devotion.

751
01:33:00,188 --> 01:33:03,157
Everything is for Master Mayur.

752
01:33:05,093 --> 01:33:06,390
- Now?
- Just now.

753
01:33:06,427 --> 01:33:09,919
She's gone to Banjo's place.
He's a dangerous man.

754
01:33:10,264 --> 01:33:13,529
You have to stake your life.
I'm not doing it.

755
01:33:19,974 --> 01:33:23,034
Quote the price for your life.

756
01:33:23,244 --> 01:33:26,077
The other shoe too.

757
01:33:26,347 --> 01:33:28,406
Here. Take it.

758
01:33:30,384 --> 01:33:36,380
Bijuriya's show is tonight.
The lights will go off. So will she.

759
01:33:36,991 --> 01:33:38,481
Who sent this?

760
01:33:38,526 --> 01:33:40,756
Your English man.

761
01:33:40,795 --> 01:33:43,696
He wants to take you to dinner.

762
01:33:48,936 --> 01:33:53,270
Thank you mother goddess.
Finally you sent him!

763
01:33:54,108 --> 01:33:59,478
Now he'll feed me dinner
and I'll give him water!

764
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:33,810
Stop!

765
01:39:35,549 --> 01:39:37,141
I'm coming!

766
01:39:41,322 --> 01:39:43,381
Leave me!

767
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:55,700
If anyone so much as looks at her...

768
01:39:55,936 --> 01:39:59,497
I'll scratch his eyes out!

769
01:40:03,143 --> 01:40:05,805
This is not a toy.

770
01:40:06,714 --> 01:40:11,242
If it cuts you, blood spurts out.

771
01:40:16,824 --> 01:40:19,156
You have to ask who I am.

772
01:40:19,226 --> 01:40:21,956
And I'll say, your death!

773
01:40:25,566 --> 01:40:29,161
One minute. Where's your boss?

774
01:40:46,587 --> 01:40:49,556
Romeo, who are you?

775
01:40:57,464 --> 01:41:00,262
Your death!

776
01:41:02,069 --> 01:41:03,764
Now I'll hit you.

777
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:08,633
Not like this.

778
01:41:09,476 --> 01:41:13,037
I'll hit now, not you.

779
01:41:28,062 --> 01:41:31,259
Here's a razor and my moustache.

780
01:41:31,665 --> 01:41:36,693
Shave them off. They have
no right to be on this face.

781
01:41:37,071 --> 01:41:39,164
Go up!

782
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:43,301
Tell me who they were.

783
01:41:44,845 --> 01:41:49,509
Very dangerous people.
But no need to worry.

784
01:41:52,553 --> 01:41:56,319
- Bend down.
- My duty...

785
01:42:13,007 --> 01:42:14,406
I'll look after everything.

786
01:42:14,508 --> 01:42:18,911
- You're with Damodar.
- Will you leave her?

787
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:21,405
I have to take her to dinner.

788
01:42:21,548 --> 01:42:26,008
She's going to be somebody's dinner.

789
01:42:27,955 --> 01:42:31,413
And I'll have you for dinner.

790
01:42:32,026 --> 01:42:34,017
That too, raw!

791
01:42:38,632 --> 01:42:42,898
Not like that. This way.

792
01:42:58,519 --> 01:42:59,577
Let go!

793
01:43:11,098 --> 01:43:13,532
Not from the back!

794
01:43:15,569 --> 01:43:17,469
Bad manners to cheat.

795
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:38,750
What food do you like?

796
01:44:54,101 --> 01:44:56,831
Hold on. I'm coming.

797
01:45:21,962 --> 01:45:24,829
Now shall we go for dinner?

798
01:50:13,286 --> 01:50:16,187
You are great!
You showed your glory!

799
01:50:16,456 --> 01:50:19,914
Don't think I'll forget my
promise because I'm a kid.

800
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:22,990
I'll make a gold statue!

801
01:50:29,603 --> 01:50:35,200
Now starts the fluttering of her heart

802
01:51:04,204 --> 01:51:05,728
She's not at home.

803
01:51:06,006 --> 01:51:07,837
When she is not at home

804
01:51:08,108 --> 01:51:10,235
The whole village knows.

805
01:51:10,644 --> 01:51:14,341
But that foreign uncle of
yours whose mistress she is...

806
01:51:15,482 --> 01:51:18,542
Only you know where
she has gone with him.

807
01:51:19,553 --> 01:51:22,147
Earned a lot off your mother!

808
01:51:22,489 --> 01:51:24,889
Take me to her!

809
01:51:28,261 --> 01:51:32,664
I'll rip your stomach!
My uncle is in love with her.

810
01:51:32,999 --> 01:51:34,796
He will marry her!

811
01:51:36,703 --> 01:51:40,799
Marry her? He'll suck her
dry and spit in the gutter!

812
01:51:41,274 --> 01:51:44,710
There's still time.
Tell her to return to Banjo.

813
01:51:45,045 --> 01:51:48,572
Or I'll have to deal in the gutter.

814
01:51:50,116 --> 01:51:54,883
His foreign uncle will
marry his Bijuriya!

815
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:06,228
I'll go to the priest today.

816
01:52:06,967 --> 01:52:10,198
To decide on the marriage date.

817
01:52:19,913 --> 01:52:24,714
Now tell me, where are you
going all dressed like a prince?

818
01:52:24,784 --> 01:52:27,252
I'd gone to the priest.

819
01:52:29,923 --> 01:52:34,155
He's the best priest who
fixes dates for marriages.

820
01:52:35,195 --> 01:52:38,756
And he said, your uncle
is very fortunate.

821
01:52:38,798 --> 01:52:43,667
- Why? - Because the
day after is Ekadashi.

822
01:52:44,204 --> 01:52:46,434
When Lord Krishna
and Tulsi get married.

823
01:52:46,706 --> 01:52:49,140
And right after that...
on the fourth day...

824
01:52:49,342 --> 01:52:53,335
You'll marry Bijuriya!

825
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:56,039
Our marriage?

826
01:53:03,323 --> 01:53:06,121
Don't get tense.

827
01:53:06,426 --> 01:53:11,329
I've arranged everything. The
wedding dress and jewels are ready.

828
01:53:12,465 --> 01:53:16,231
But I'm warning you,
it's silver not gold.

829
01:53:21,174 --> 01:53:24,337
I'm in a hurry for the wedding...

830
01:53:24,444 --> 01:53:31,145
Because Banjo calls her your
mistress and insults her.

831
01:53:31,718 --> 01:53:35,586
That is why the earlier
you get married, the better.

832
01:53:38,725 --> 01:53:42,354
Somebody has misled you.

833
01:53:43,196 --> 01:53:47,132
Or did you dream of this wedding?

834
01:53:48,134 --> 01:53:49,123
Dream?

835
01:53:54,541 --> 01:53:57,009
How can you call this a dream?

836
01:53:57,677 --> 01:54:03,638
It's not a dream. I saw
what you showed my eyes.

837
01:54:06,886 --> 01:54:10,117
Is what Banjo said, true?

838
01:54:11,091 --> 01:54:15,050
That you won't marry her...
that you...

839
01:54:17,797 --> 01:54:20,459
Hear me out carefully.

840
01:54:21,501 --> 01:54:27,269
You are heir to the great
Mayur family with traditions.

841
01:54:27,907 --> 01:54:31,274
You saw it yourself.
And you only told me...

842
01:54:31,644 --> 01:54:35,136
A man getting his boots
polished on the road...

843
01:54:35,348 --> 01:54:38,511
...didn't want to marry her.
- They were unfortunate!

844
01:54:38,852 --> 01:54:40,717
The one who gets a godly fate...

845
01:54:40,854 --> 01:54:45,518
My God will only arrange
her match with that man!

846
01:54:46,459 --> 01:54:48,051
And you tell me one thing
if you didn't want to marry her...

847
01:54:50,363 --> 01:54:53,924
Why did you do that?

848
01:54:55,168 --> 01:55:01,164
- What did I do to her?
- Which a husband does to his wife.

849
01:55:07,213 --> 01:55:09,443
What do you think of her?

850
01:55:09,716 --> 01:55:15,382
A prostitute? She is not!
She is my mother!

851
01:55:20,326 --> 01:55:23,887
- Try to understand.
- I've understood everything!

852
01:55:24,431 --> 01:55:28,424
Now you understand!
Neither are you anything to me...

853
01:55:28,635 --> 01:55:32,332
Nor am I related to
your sinner family!

854
01:55:34,741 --> 01:55:38,871
If I have somebody,
it is only my mother!

855
01:55:39,612 --> 01:55:42,342
Now I understand,
this was all a bribe!

856
01:55:42,382 --> 01:55:45,408
To separate me from my mother!

857
01:55:46,319 --> 01:55:50,278
I spit at them!
Take them back!

858
01:55:52,492 --> 01:55:54,892
- Try to understand.
- No!

859
01:55:56,362 --> 01:55:59,627
I've understood everything.
Take back everything!

860
01:56:00,433 --> 01:56:03,925
- Take it all!
- That's enough.

861
01:56:04,003 --> 01:56:05,300
Take your bow tie!

862
01:56:08,174 --> 01:56:11,632
Take your jacket and waistcoat!

863
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:18,073
And your shirt!

864
01:56:20,487 --> 01:56:23,183
Take this and this!

865
01:56:27,093 --> 01:56:28,856
Don't do this.

866
01:56:31,531 --> 01:56:33,624
Here's your master Mayur!

867
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:41,998
What impression did you have?
Even if you'd brought me the stars...

868
01:56:42,075 --> 01:56:45,272
I'd have kicked them
away for my mother!

869
01:56:52,652 --> 01:56:55,712
Aren't you ashamed?

870
01:56:56,222 --> 01:57:00,852
Despite being a God,
you treated a kid like this!

871
01:57:01,394 --> 01:57:04,522
You didn't even honour
the flowers of my worship!

872
01:57:04,664 --> 01:57:07,098
You ate so many coconuts of mine!

873
01:57:07,534 --> 01:57:12,369
You ate them all up!
I bought them with my earnings!

874
01:57:14,741 --> 01:57:17,403
You can't be God!

875
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:20,040
But I won't spare you!

876
01:57:20,513 --> 01:57:23,482
I'll tell the villagers about you!

877
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:26,512
You're a cheat not God!

878
01:57:26,553 --> 01:57:30,819
I'll tell everyone.
Nobody will come to you!

879
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:34,790
Stay here alone, all night!

880
01:57:34,827 --> 01:57:36,818
That's your punishment!

881
01:57:49,208 --> 01:57:50,436
Understood.

882
01:57:54,547 --> 01:58:01,385
I sold all these,
didn't go to school.

883
01:58:02,689 --> 01:58:09,390
Lied to mother. You're
punishing me for these sins.

884
01:58:10,496 --> 01:58:15,263
But why are you punishing
my Bijuriya for my sins?

885
01:58:18,104 --> 01:58:20,265
What will happen to her?

886
01:58:20,306 --> 01:58:22,570
Where will she go?

887
01:58:48,601 --> 01:58:53,129
Where are you running like crazy?

888
01:58:53,673 --> 01:58:56,801
There's no sign of
Nandu since yesterday.

889
01:58:57,043 --> 01:58:59,671
He went to his foreign uncle
in grand style yesterday.

890
01:59:00,013 --> 01:59:01,674
He must be there.

891
01:59:01,814 --> 01:59:06,683
He's never stayed away from me.
He must have kidnapped him!

892
01:59:06,919 --> 01:59:10,320
He's tied from head to toe.
How can he fly?

893
01:59:10,356 --> 01:59:14,417
Your love has snipped
off his feathers, silly.

894
01:59:14,627 --> 01:59:19,394
You don't know. He came
here to take my son away!

895
01:59:35,314 --> 01:59:37,407
Where is Nandu?

896
01:59:38,951 --> 01:59:41,749
I asked where my Nandu is!

897
01:59:51,397 --> 01:59:56,926
I've spent the night like a decade.

898
01:59:59,272 --> 02:00:06,576
Only to get this answer from you.

899
02:00:09,082 --> 02:00:12,848
Where is Nandu?

900
02:00:15,054 --> 02:00:18,751
I want a simple answer
to my question.

901
02:00:21,294 --> 02:00:24,923
Now you have to answer me!

902
02:00:28,234 --> 02:00:32,796
But first you listen.

903
02:00:36,476 --> 02:00:42,073
Every morning the sun rises.

904
02:00:42,115 --> 02:00:48,111
And spreads its' light
throughout the world.

905
02:00:52,158 --> 02:01:00,657
And right from that time,
there's darkness in the child's life.

906
02:01:03,569 --> 02:01:10,270
He hides his face from that light.

907
02:01:10,476 --> 02:01:20,716
And wipes people's dirty
shoes with his forehead...

908
02:01:20,753 --> 02:01:22,914
And polishes them.

909
02:01:23,790 --> 02:01:35,099
And the same sun sets
in that child's life...

910
02:01:36,769 --> 02:01:40,466
So that he can go to
dens of black marketing.

911
02:01:40,606 --> 02:01:48,103
He can sell all these
and collect every penny!

912
02:01:48,748 --> 02:01:50,773
Lies! All lies!

913
02:01:51,284 --> 02:01:53,343
I may not be very rich...

914
02:01:53,486 --> 02:01:59,083
But I've fulfilled every wish
of my child before he asked for it!

915
02:02:00,927 --> 02:02:04,090
You've always been mistaken.

916
02:02:08,601 --> 02:02:13,436
Neither have you ever
understood the joy in his heart...

917
02:02:15,241 --> 02:02:17,732
Nor his sorrow.

918
02:02:22,715 --> 02:02:25,548
Your dirty profession.

919
02:02:26,252 --> 02:02:29,949
...is his biggest sorrow.

920
02:02:37,029 --> 02:02:43,832
And do you know
what's his biggestjoy?

921
02:02:45,938 --> 02:02:50,204
To give you a respectable life.

922
02:02:50,276 --> 02:02:54,975
To settle you down.

923
02:02:58,718 --> 02:03:03,280
And for this and to get you married...

924
02:03:03,489 --> 02:03:07,482
That child's childhood...

925
02:03:09,295 --> 02:03:11,855
...has been murdered!

926
02:03:13,566 --> 02:03:18,162
No. My Nandu cannot
be my misfortune.

927
02:03:18,571 --> 02:03:19,868
My baby!

928
02:03:22,208 --> 02:03:24,506
Don't call him a baby.

929
02:03:26,345 --> 02:03:29,280
In the form of a child...

930
02:03:30,082 --> 02:03:34,883
He has become an old father!

931
02:03:35,855 --> 02:03:40,952
He begs every passerby.

932
02:03:43,195 --> 02:03:45,425
Is there anyone?

933
02:03:46,499 --> 02:03:51,937
Will anybody hold
my Bijuriya's hand?

934
02:03:57,476 --> 02:04:01,344
He came to me with the same request.

935
02:04:01,914 --> 02:04:04,974
I've understood.

936
02:04:05,484 --> 02:04:09,511
This is your last trick
to take my child away!

937
02:04:10,456 --> 02:04:13,516
Such aspersions on my character!

938
02:04:13,793 --> 02:04:16,387
You'll never be reborn as a man!

939
02:04:16,529 --> 02:04:18,326
I curse you!

940
02:04:18,497 --> 02:04:24,231
I accept your curse. I'm willing
to be reborn as the devil each time.

941
02:04:25,071 --> 02:04:29,269
But in this birth,
for the welfare of this boy...

942
02:04:29,575 --> 02:04:34,478
I will have this answer from you!

943
02:04:35,448 --> 02:04:39,509
Where is Nandu?

944
02:06:06,405 --> 02:06:07,804
Mother...

945
02:06:09,341 --> 02:06:12,139
Have you ever seen
such a fortunate bride?

946
02:06:13,879 --> 02:06:20,250
Who has this make-up in her fate,
more precious than your stars!

947
02:06:21,854 --> 02:06:24,049
What kind of prank is this?

948
02:06:28,027 --> 02:06:30,222
I'm so unfortunate.

949
02:06:30,729 --> 02:06:34,722
My maternal love
turned out to be venom!

950
02:06:35,768 --> 02:06:40,603
A witch who ate her child alive!

951
02:06:42,675 --> 02:06:45,371
Where were you all night?

952
02:06:46,645 --> 02:06:50,308
Your mother was so worried.
Why don't you answer?

953
02:06:51,050 --> 02:06:53,484
Mother, give me strength.

954
02:06:54,053 --> 02:07:00,652
I want to cultivate so much
hatred in my child's heart...

955
02:07:01,193 --> 02:07:04,526
That he hates the thought of me!

956
02:07:04,563 --> 02:07:08,727
That I can break his heart.
Give me the strength!

957
02:07:10,136 --> 02:07:13,970
You have to keep a mother's word!

958
02:07:20,779 --> 02:07:21,871
Come here.

959
02:07:26,285 --> 02:07:31,018
When you knew I love Banjo,
that's the only joy in my life...

960
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:34,516
Why did you go to your
relative with my proposal?

961
02:07:35,294 --> 02:07:37,728
Answer me!

962
02:07:38,964 --> 02:07:41,524
Did I rear you for this?

963
02:07:42,168 --> 02:07:45,069
Why are you standing dumb?
Why don't you answer?

964
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:49,699
You love that sinner, Banjo!

965
02:07:49,742 --> 02:07:54,076
Want to marry him. Then what
were you doing with my uncle?

966
02:07:54,346 --> 02:07:59,147
- Claiming my right.
- What right do you have?

967
02:07:59,985 --> 02:08:03,386
Scoundrel! You're asking me my right?

968
02:08:04,156 --> 02:08:07,990
You jinx! Ate your parents on birth!

969
02:08:08,027 --> 02:08:13,090
Listen to my right. You had nobody
On my mercy you've grown so big!

970
02:08:13,766 --> 02:08:17,964
Every drop of your blood, part
of your body is owned by me!

971
02:08:18,137 --> 02:08:22,198
Your studies, medicines, eggs
and butter every morning!

972
02:08:22,775 --> 02:08:25,209
Who paid for that? Your relative?

973
02:08:25,611 --> 02:08:30,446
- 8 rotis smeared with butter in a
day! Did somebody donate them?

974
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:33,518
Come here son of Bijuriya!

975
02:08:34,153 --> 02:08:37,350
Did somebody from the
sky fill milk for you?

976
02:08:37,389 --> 02:08:40,381
Don't they cost money?
Count them all!

977
02:08:40,426 --> 02:08:43,793
You'll fill all your copies but
my rights won't be accounted for!

978
02:08:44,363 --> 02:08:47,161
Come here! Why are you
acting before an actress!

979
02:08:47,666 --> 02:08:51,158
Look here. The food
is crying for you!

980
02:08:51,604 --> 02:08:56,132
- Eat you free loader!
- I won't eat. - What?

981
02:08:56,508 --> 02:09:00,467
I never ate for free!
I thought it was my right!

982
02:09:00,579 --> 02:09:06,779
And I won't eat today either!
I'll never come here! I'm going!

983
02:09:08,754 --> 02:09:10,847
I'm going to my uncle!

984
02:09:10,889 --> 02:09:13,915
Go! I couldn't get
married because of you.

985
02:09:14,059 --> 02:09:17,825
Now I can be at peace! Get lost!

986
02:09:18,464 --> 02:09:20,557
I'm going but with a promise!

987
02:09:20,833 --> 02:09:23,996
I'll never drink water in your house!

988
02:09:26,538 --> 02:09:27,835
Listen!

989
02:09:31,443 --> 02:09:36,176
You turned so crazy for money
that you sacrificed Nandu!

990
02:09:36,615 --> 02:09:38,810
Bad times!

991
02:09:52,498 --> 02:09:54,966
That's enough!

992
02:10:11,183 --> 02:10:13,708
Men never cry.

993
02:10:16,155 --> 02:10:20,990
- Tell me what's wrong.
- How can I?

994
02:10:26,865 --> 02:10:28,355
What did you say?

995
02:10:32,504 --> 02:10:35,302
She wants her rights?

996
02:10:42,948 --> 02:10:44,540
Don't cry.

997
02:10:48,187 --> 02:10:51,623
Now tell me what she told you.

998
02:10:52,057 --> 02:10:56,016
Tell me everything.

999
02:10:59,298 --> 02:11:07,672
She said she's not my mother.
She called you my relative.

1000
02:11:09,441 --> 02:11:12,274
She's asking money for feeding me!

1001
02:11:12,444 --> 02:11:15,311
She wants to be paid for feeding me!

1002
02:11:32,498 --> 02:11:34,227
Your crying is not right.

1003
02:11:35,667 --> 02:11:37,794
Crying is harmful.

1004
02:11:38,670 --> 02:11:44,631
She says the bread was
smeared with butter!

1005
02:11:44,943 --> 02:11:50,313
Did she say that?
But was it smeared?

1006
02:11:50,783 --> 02:11:56,016
She wants to be paid for it!
It was absolutely dry!

1007
02:11:56,121 --> 02:12:01,684
Very bad to apply butter on bread.

1008
02:12:02,761 --> 02:12:07,528
But if she said it, it's bad.

1009
02:12:07,933 --> 02:12:09,264
Now stop crying.

1010
02:12:09,301 --> 02:12:11,792
We'll pay her dues.

1011
02:12:11,837 --> 02:12:16,069
She took me from my mother
even before I was born.

1012
02:12:16,675 --> 02:12:19,974
Nandlal is my son!

1013
02:12:20,946 --> 02:12:24,211
She fought with everyone and
forcibly raised me herself!

1014
02:12:24,750 --> 02:12:27,844
Did I ask her to do it?

1015
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:33,082
She has no right! I won't go!

1016
02:12:37,896 --> 02:12:41,263
It would have been better if
they had sent me to an orphanage!

1017
02:13:15,968 --> 02:13:18,937
What happened about the
2 tickets I wanted for London?

1018
02:13:21,807 --> 02:13:24,867
Not after 4 days!
I want them tomorrow!

1019
02:13:26,445 --> 02:13:29,380
You can do nothing!

1020
02:13:29,615 --> 02:13:34,780
Call my London office and leave
instructions to charter a plane!

1021
02:13:35,053 --> 02:13:38,580
I told you the child isn't well...

1022
02:17:12,404 --> 02:17:16,033
How dare you return! Come!

1023
02:17:17,743 --> 02:17:21,770
I'll make mincemeat of you
and feed it to the fish!

1024
02:17:29,454 --> 02:17:34,050
You hit a drunk.
That was very bad.

1025
02:17:34,126 --> 02:17:38,222
I won't spare you when I get sober.

1026
02:18:07,425 --> 02:18:10,622
Englishman has come!

1027
02:18:24,476 --> 02:18:27,673
Are you sleeping?
He's waiting outside.

1028
02:18:27,879 --> 02:18:29,904
The door is open.

1029
02:18:37,422 --> 02:18:42,519
Excuse me, there's a special
item today. Getting ready for it.

1030
02:18:43,395 --> 02:18:46,796
Yes, I understand.

1031
02:18:46,832 --> 02:18:49,027
Why did you bother to come?

1032
02:18:49,467 --> 02:18:53,961
I had to talk to you about your right

1033
02:18:57,742 --> 02:19:03,374
Whether you feel bad or good,
I'll take the entire sum in cash.

1034
02:19:03,748 --> 02:19:05,545
You may take your cheque back.

1035
02:19:06,218 --> 02:19:10,484
This is not a cheque.
It's a court document.

1036
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:17,792
That you have received full
payment of raising master Mayur.

1037
02:19:23,802 --> 02:19:29,365
You have to sign here.

1038
02:20:07,579 --> 02:20:08,773
Signature.

1039
02:20:12,450 --> 02:20:16,511
How can I just sign?
I must first get my dues.

1040
02:20:17,889 --> 02:20:20,756
Take your time to arrange for cash.

1041
02:20:21,159 --> 02:20:23,627
Come over when you do.

1042
02:20:23,995 --> 02:20:26,520
I'm in no hurry.

1043
02:20:27,632 --> 02:20:30,760
I've arranged for the cash.

1044
02:20:33,338 --> 02:20:34,828
Where is it?

1045
02:20:38,944 --> 02:20:40,036
Bring it in.

1046
02:20:59,965 --> 02:21:04,061
I had promised to square
your account of rights.

1047
02:21:04,336 --> 02:21:06,827
I've come to keep that word.

1048
02:21:11,076 --> 02:21:14,876
The thought of your right
never came to my heart.

1049
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:17,748
So how could I account for it?

1050
02:21:17,782 --> 02:21:21,718
And you never kept accounts
even with the grocer.

1051
02:21:22,053 --> 02:21:24,715
So how could you account
for so many years?

1052
02:21:25,123 --> 02:21:30,425
I'm giving you a blank
cheque along with this bag.

1053
02:21:38,570 --> 02:21:40,470
Thank you very much.

1054
02:21:45,477 --> 02:21:46,444
Signature.

1055
02:21:51,449 --> 02:21:55,283
Wait. This document is in English.

1056
02:21:56,154 --> 02:21:58,247
And you don't know English.

1057
02:21:59,090 --> 02:22:05,051
So I'll explain to you
what's written in it.

1058
02:22:06,264 --> 02:22:10,564
It says after signing this paper...

1059
02:22:11,069 --> 02:22:17,872
Miss Bijuriya has no
rights over master Mayur.

1060
02:22:20,678 --> 02:22:25,012
If she ever wants to meet her Nandu...

1061
02:22:25,450 --> 02:22:31,013
Master Mayur. If she ever
tries to write or call him up...

1062
02:22:31,589 --> 02:22:34,251
It will be considered an offense.

1063
02:22:35,193 --> 02:22:38,390
And I'll never think of her!

1064
02:22:44,602 --> 02:22:49,062
I'm a jinx! I ate
my parents on birth!

1065
02:22:50,175 --> 02:22:54,043
You raised me, brought me up.

1066
02:23:02,587 --> 02:23:05,681
Do me one last favour.

1067
02:23:06,591 --> 02:23:11,426
Don't come to the
airport to see this jinx!

1068
02:23:16,901 --> 02:23:18,630
This is a legal document.

1069
02:23:19,270 --> 02:23:25,300
If you wish, you can show
it to your legal adviser.

1070
02:23:26,511 --> 02:23:28,570
There's still time.

1071
02:24:36,514 --> 02:24:37,811
Come soon.

1072
02:24:54,432 --> 02:24:57,401
- Why have you come?
- Shut up!

1073
02:24:57,802 --> 02:25:02,637
I've come for my loot! Where's it?

1074
02:25:03,141 --> 02:25:04,108
What loot?

1075
02:25:09,447 --> 02:25:10,277
No!

1076
02:25:12,283 --> 02:25:13,648
- Let go!
- No!

1077
02:25:14,619 --> 02:25:17,110
That belongs to my child!

1078
02:25:25,463 --> 02:25:29,490
This belongs to an innocent
child. I must return it!

1079
02:25:33,271 --> 02:25:37,071
I beg you! I plead with you!

1080
02:25:37,442 --> 02:25:39,273
Have mercy!

1081
02:25:49,153 --> 02:25:54,352
Mercy? How will that
come to my heart?

1082
02:25:55,193 --> 02:25:58,026
You know how big a bastard he is.

1083
02:25:58,896 --> 02:26:02,354
Will you obey him?

1084
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:06,258
I'll do anything you say!

1085
02:26:06,738 --> 02:26:11,505
If I want something now,
I want itjust now!

1086
02:26:11,809 --> 02:26:15,404
Quote the price in your heart.

1087
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:18,144
She is priceless.

1088
02:26:18,449 --> 02:26:21,646
Her heart and profession is priceless.

1089
02:26:22,487 --> 02:26:27,254
But for that Englishman she
kept neither her face nor mine!

1090
02:26:27,925 --> 02:26:30,052
That is why I'm selling her.

1091
02:26:30,461 --> 02:26:33,123
You want my stuff?

1092
02:26:34,832 --> 02:26:38,666
Then bid as per your position!

1093
02:26:40,805 --> 02:26:43,968
You want to see my position!

1094
02:27:19,877 --> 02:27:22,710
You've done me a great favour.

1095
02:27:23,014 --> 02:27:27,417
This uncle had dreams for you.
It cried at your sorrows.

1096
02:27:27,919 --> 02:27:29,716
What blessings I asked for you.

1097
02:27:30,088 --> 02:27:32,818
- But what happened...
- No uncle!

1098
02:27:33,257 --> 02:27:40,754
You've done me a favour
by finding Nandu's family.

1099
02:27:41,699 --> 02:27:45,760
And this beggar who came to
your house dressed as a queen...

1100
02:27:46,137 --> 02:27:49,163
Has really become a queen!

1101
02:27:49,207 --> 02:27:51,471
She has earned so much wealth.

1102
02:27:52,610 --> 02:27:57,343
- Didn't you hear?
- I did but my heart...

1103
02:27:58,916 --> 02:28:02,647
Time is flying past. It's almost
time for Nandu's plane to leave.

1104
02:28:05,056 --> 02:28:10,517
This belongs to Nandu. Give it
to him and do me one more favour.

1105
02:28:10,762 --> 02:28:15,790
That's why I called you.
It contains his toys.

1106
02:28:17,802 --> 02:28:19,861
I understood.

1107
02:28:21,005 --> 02:28:23,235
You won't come to see him off.

1108
02:28:26,778 --> 02:28:30,305
All the joys of your life are gone.

1109
02:28:30,481 --> 02:28:36,716
And also give the blessing that
joys always be by your side!

1110
02:28:38,823 --> 02:28:41,087
Good bye.

1111
02:28:42,293 --> 02:28:44,557
Forgive me if possible.

1112
02:29:03,481 --> 02:29:07,918
- What's this?
- Bijuriya has sent toys for him.

1113
02:29:10,922 --> 02:29:14,688
Sent toys? Couldn't come herself?

1114
02:29:14,725 --> 02:29:16,488
I don't want them!

1115
02:29:20,898 --> 02:29:22,627
Give it to me.

1116
02:29:34,445 --> 02:29:38,541
You've accounted for
Bijuriya's rights.

1117
02:29:39,717 --> 02:29:46,350
And she kept the money.

1118
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:54,497
And you told her not to come
to see you off at the airport.

1119
02:29:54,532 --> 02:29:59,902
But it's our custom.
When somebody goes abroad...

1120
02:30:00,538 --> 02:30:02,904
His family comes to see him off.

1121
02:30:03,541 --> 02:30:06,806
I'm going away forever.

1122
02:30:06,844 --> 02:30:07,640
No!

1123
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:12,176
I'll come!

1124
02:30:13,184 --> 02:30:14,845
Where are you running off?

1125
02:30:14,986 --> 02:30:17,181
Nandu is calling me. If he gets
out of control, it will be terrible.

1126
02:30:17,221 --> 02:30:22,318
He'll come back running. All my
efforts will be ruined. Let me go!

1127
02:30:23,261 --> 02:30:25,161
Either come with me...

1128
02:30:27,365 --> 02:30:29,560
Now you're neither mine nor your own.

1129
02:30:29,767 --> 02:30:32,895
I've auctioned you off. Come.

1130
02:30:33,638 --> 02:30:36,630
Bhim Khalasi must be waiting for you

1131
02:30:36,974 --> 02:30:40,239
No!

1132
02:30:44,048 --> 02:30:46,346
Leave her! Where are you taking her?

1133
02:35:35,172 --> 02:35:37,766
Poison! Why?

1134
02:35:39,410 --> 02:35:42,709
- She's calling me!
- No!

1135
02:35:42,947 --> 02:35:45,882
She's calling me. I must go!

1136
02:35:47,184 --> 02:35:48,116
No uncle!

1137
02:35:54,959 --> 02:35:59,191
She's calling me. I must go!

1138
02:37:31,722 --> 02:37:34,316
Who is Vikram?

1139
02:37:35,759 --> 02:37:39,820
The Englishman with this cheap tart!

1140
02:37:44,635 --> 02:37:48,366
The cheap tart is called Bijuriya!

1141
02:37:50,174 --> 02:37:53,632
I said she's mine. Can't you hear?

1142
02:37:59,783 --> 02:38:01,410
Where are you going?

1143
02:38:02,786 --> 02:38:06,586
Nobody touch him.
It's a matter of hearts.

1144
02:38:07,358 --> 02:38:09,258
The decision will be between us.

1145
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:12,552
Nobody will shoot.

1146
02:38:14,598 --> 02:38:18,967
You want her? Take her.

1147
02:38:19,336 --> 02:38:20,098
Come and take her.

1148
02:38:21,071 --> 02:38:23,767
I've come to take her with me.

1149
02:38:24,441 --> 02:38:26,705
But before that...

1150
02:38:27,144 --> 02:38:30,671
The dirty hands with
which you touched her...

1151
02:38:31,048 --> 02:38:34,711
I'll make those hands
apologise to her!

1152
02:38:39,189 --> 02:38:41,817
You're the one who will apologise!

1153
02:38:42,059 --> 02:38:44,493
Because I'll show you your place!

1154
02:38:50,768 --> 02:38:53,566
Never forget your place!

1155
02:38:59,143 --> 02:39:01,373
This is what you're worth!

1156
02:39:25,335 --> 02:39:31,001
No! Not yet! Now the
last exhibition is left!

1157
02:40:34,004 --> 02:40:35,335
Shoot them!

1158
02:40:56,660 --> 02:41:00,152
First you will apologise.

1159
02:41:19,650 --> 02:41:24,087
What should man never forget?

1160
02:41:25,556 --> 02:41:28,389
Never forget his position.

1161
02:41:49,913 --> 02:41:51,244
Live long.

1162
02:42:08,198 --> 02:42:13,727
This girl I've accepted as
daughter is my life's earning.

1163
02:42:13,937 --> 02:42:19,671
I've given her to you. What else
does this mendicant have to give?

1164
02:42:20,644 --> 02:42:22,373
One Mahuwa betel
