1
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,695
Life is like a film

2
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,897
Each of us is the lead in our own film

3
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,231
Some might assume he is also
the co-lead in someone else's film

4
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,731
But in fact, his role is merely supporting

5
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,501
Or just a bit part

6
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,280
Or worse...
his scenes could have been edited out

7
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,748
He just doesn't know it

8
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,351
Like the mother and child here

9
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,729
The girl will certainly be the lead
in her mother's film

10
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,464
Yet, in ten years

11
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:51,002
How important would the role of the mother
be in her daughter's film?

12
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,971
I'm responsible for keeping track
of these deleted footages

13
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,446
I make sure they are intact

14
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,680
Because people do make mistakes
in editing all the time

15
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,911
When they realize they made the wrong cut...

16
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,048
I'd deliver the footages back to them

17
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:46,318
The destination of my next delivery is here

18
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,378
The time is now

19
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,045
The set is done

20
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,485
The studio is lit

21
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,426
The door is open

22
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,294
Costumes' been chosen

23
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,996
Vocals' been sweetened

24
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,104
Rhythm' been enlivened

25
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,607
All ready and waiting

26
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,371
Shoot-the past and present

27
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,570
Shoot-love and pain

28
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,546
Shoot-tangled rivalries

29
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,048
All are nothing, but an illusion

30
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,050
No less than a blink

31
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,190
No more than an eternity

32
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:55,157
It's heaven nevertheless

33
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,929
How close is the present
how distant are the memories?

34
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,261
How stressful is the past
how tiring is the present?

35
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:08,136
"In a world where love's forgotten
can a memory be born to last?"

36
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,937
What kind of a love story can pay
for your living?

37
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,809
Who would allow this story the highest glory?

38
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,679
Perhaps all love stories do not come easy

39
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,812
But they're just words on a blackboard
such is the irony

40
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,548
Wipe away the past and present

41
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,421
Wipe away love and pain

42
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,288
Wipe away the rivalries

43
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,554
All are nothing, but an illusion

44
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,290
No less than a blink

45
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,161
No more than an eternity

46
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:43,435
What kind of heaven is that?

47
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,364
Oh, this love story

48
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,066
Forget this love story

49
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,907
Hold onto this love story

50
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,800
Oh this love story

51
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,706
Forget this love story

52
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:26,180
Hold onto this love story

53
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,518
How close is the present
how distant are the memories?

54
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,557
How stressful is the past
how tiring is the present?

55
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,189
"In a world where love's forgotten
can a memory be born to last?"

56
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,234
How close is the present
how distant are the memories?

57
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,395
How stressful is the past
how tiring is the present?

58
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:51,602
"In a world where love's forgotten
can a memory be born to last?"

59
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:59,878
Or fade like a picture on a silver screen

60
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,148
Cut

61
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,222
Cut!

62
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,524
Slate... Clap-board!

63
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,558
Do we have a take?

64
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,093
Is lunch ready?

65
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,595
Let's break now

66
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,635
Meal break!

67
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,500
Mr. Nie!

68
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,470
Wanna be an actress? Meet the director!

69
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,369
How's it going?

70
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,544
The love amongst the leads is way too artificial

71
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,740
What do you mean?

72
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,548
She read your script yesterday
and cried so many times

73
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,312
- Didn't you?
- Oh yes... It was so moving!

74
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,821
You hear that? So moving!

75
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,159
Xiao-yu is not exactly in love with Zhang Yang

76
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,818
Zhang neither... he reunites with her
for other reasons

77
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,427
As for the circus master and Xiao-yu...
what they have is hardly love

78
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,365
If so...

79
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,797
This is not a love story then!

80
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,096
Xiao-yu and Zhang have to be in love
with each other

81
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,797
The circus master has to love Xiao-yu
and vice versa

82
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,172
There, we have a love story
which is exactly what I've promised to deliver

83
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,905
- You must make me a love story!
- Love story is silly

84
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,709
Love story is... that's not the point!

85
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,943
The point is, women dig love stories

86
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,279
The audience digs love stories!
Do you like love stories?

87
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,547
- Oh, yes...
- Good girl!

88
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,312
You see?!

89
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,403
No kisses, no nudity and no love scene!

90
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,634
Where am I?
- All in the contract...

91
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,109
Shanghai, on the way to the hotel
press conference

92
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,474
Hey! I must get the cheque
before the conference starts

93
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,618
Otherwise, we're not getting out of the limo

94
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,783
Okay, bye

95
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,079
How long did I sleep?

96
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,115
15 minutes

97
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,084
That's all?

98
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,121
You called and woke me up again last night

99
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,293
And said something about revenge
and getting even

100
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,331
I said that?!

101
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,930
Next time you take sleeping pills
go straight to bed!

102
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,265
Whenever you don't, you go crazy!

103
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,769
Why are we taking this film?

104
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,171
You're missing all the offers in Hong Kong!

105
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,146
I'm out of here as soon as the press
conference ends! You'll be on your own

106
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,110
Just don't ring me up every other night

107
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,384
Look, your actress

108
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,788
Don't you dare fall for her during the shoot

109
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,446
She's an opportunist

110
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,719
But she won't go for someone like you

111
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,761
She only digs directors

112
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,162
What "memoir"?

113
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,496
I only agree to do a photo book

114
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,135
But Miss Sun

115
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:13,244
Your success story can inspire our youth

116
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,075
If they were as poor as I was as a child...

117
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,980
They don't need to be inspired to succeed

118
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,781
Oh, that's good!

119
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,588
"If they were as poor as I was..."

120
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,192
What are you doing? You heard me
"No memoir"

121
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,190
Time to go, Miss Sun

122
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,359
The only value of my past is to remind me
to stay away from it

123
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,589
Is that clear?

124
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,902
What if one day you really forget it all?

125
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,233
Wouldn't it be a pity?!

126
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,134
That'd be perfect

127
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,843
What about love?

128
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,051
There is no such thing as love!

129
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:10,633
Miss Sun...

130
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,115
Hey Chief!

131
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:30,088
The contract should be fine with just
a couple of changes

132
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,850
Such as this word, you know
no one is comfortable with it

133
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,324
And this clause...

134
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,623
Never mind! I'll just rewrite the cheque

135
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,459
One more thing! Why is it written in past tense?

136
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,260
Never mind! I'll just take a zero off the cheque

137
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,326
But it's not something from the past

138
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,162
We'll talk later

139
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,701
The press conference is starting

140
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,940
- But the present tense suits the artist better...
- Later...

141
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,700
- The artist needs that...
- Get lost!

142
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,777
Rumors say that this time
the finance drives the project

143
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,744
And it's your Hong Kong investor...

144
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,611
...who insists on a musical and casting a star
from Hong Kong

145
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:02,413
Does it mark the end of Nie Wen as an auteur?

146
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,649
How do you think of...

147
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,161
I've never had more than one option
which is to make good movies

148
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,632
Finance, cast, genre
whatever are simply means towards my end

149
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:17,564
Sun Na

150
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,193
This is your first collaboration
with Lin Jian-dong

151
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,771
What's your favorite movie of his?

152
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,399
You won't believe it
I've not seen any of his films

153
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,044
- I seldom watch Hong Kong films
- Are there love scenes?

154
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,515
Wouldn't Mr. Nie be jealous?

155
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,883
Sun Na, have you closed the deal
on the Hollywood picture yet?

156
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:35,954
Not yet

157
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,555
Will you be using a dance-double?

158
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:46,091
If you don't start to ask
more intelligent questions

159
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,199
I suppose
I can end my Q & A session right here!

160
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,206
You've been avoiding making films in China

161
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,274
What makes you change your mind?

162
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,545
Good paycheck, a great director

163
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,975
And a gorgeous leading lady!

164
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,375
Well said, indeed!

165
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:09,045
And a great movie in the making
will eventually answer it all

166
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,885
Let's learn more about its plot
from the director now

167
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,589
This is a story about a love triangle

168
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,131
Sun Na stars as Xiao-yu

169
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,436
She had lost her memory

170
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,937
She'd forgotten her lover

171
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,374
She became homeless

172
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,305
And then... one day

173
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,141
She met a circus master

174
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,884
He took her in and made up
a beautiful memory for her

175
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,081
Good evening, mister

176
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,648
Mister?

177
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,992
Hurry, Xiao-yu!

178
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,495
But at this time, her former lover shows up

179
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,627
He's Zhang Yang

180
00:13:56,202 --> 00:14:06,043
It was you, no doubt... your voice, your back

181
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:17,388
The distant look in your eyes puts me to silence

182
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:29,123
Are you testing me because you doubt me?

183
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:35,035
Perhaps my memory is flawed

184
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,472
You aren't you after all

185
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:52,116
Who are you then?
Someone who has forgotten her love for me?

186
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:56,922
My heart is enthralled by you, broken by you

187
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:01,157
I regret nothing even if I should

188
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:10,901
Love that once existed, or perhaps
it was only my illusion

189
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,878
How could you forget it all...

190
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,678
Forget all about me?

191
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:28,056
Who are you?

192
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,890
Who's this person gazing at me?

193
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:37,832
Is it deja vu, or is it a dream?

194
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:42,463
I seem to have known you before

195
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:51,174
The love in your eyes is a feeling
I don't understand

196
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,152
Why do you have to ask me...

197
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:02,619
...ask me who I am?

198
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,762
Have I really forgotten...

199
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,472
...who I really am?

200
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:26,917
I did know you, didn't I?

201
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,110
Look

202
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,311
The camera loves him

203
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:35,118
But who are you?

204
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,257
Sun Na

205
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,353
The pressure is on you now!

206
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,725
You lost your focus here

207
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,329
Your performance was unstable

208
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,995
You're just picking on me!

209
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,892
Take it easy

210
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,425
It's only a rehearsal shoot

211
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,061
We've been through this every time

212
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,399
After editing
you'll always give us a pleasant surprise

213
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,469
Does it mean I should get you to edit
my next Hollywood film?

214
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,673
Practice your English first

215
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,645
Your deal is not even signed

216
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:32,842
Remember

217
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,954
Mr. Gu's party is the day after tomorrow

218
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,647
He has promised to invest in my next film

219
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,821
I have to study the script and stay "focused"

220
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,121
Where do I find time to entertain your investors?

221
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,229
Jian-dong's gaze is good
but there is too much anger

222
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,899
Got to tone him down...

223
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,271
Mention this when you meet Mr. Gu

224
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:04,040
Our musical deserves a bigger budget
for promotion

225
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,712
Who's going to be your PR
once I'm gone to Hollywood?

226
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,249
Good evening, Mr. Nie, Miss Sun

227
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,486
Nie

228
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,092
Zhang's agent called me just now

229
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,391
He read the script and...

230
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,264
He realized the circus master is not the lead

231
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,371
So he's not interested

232
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,404
He'll change his mind in a couple of days!

233
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,703
But he's already negotiating
another picture deal!

234
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,577
He won't turn me down

235
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,285
If he does, I can do it! I was an actor once

236
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,277
It was Nie who made Zhang a star

237
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,787
Get real, you guys!

238
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,216
No one needs to repay a favor
with the rest of his life!

239
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:36,405
Who are you then?
Someone who has forgotten her love for me?

240
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,305
"I hate you..."

241
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,236
"I hate you..."

242
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,545
The check, please!

243
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,402
Hey!

244
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,881
Can I take a shower at your place?

245
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,376
...spectacular

246
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,388
The world out there is so forlorn

247
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,687
While you're enjoying the world out there

248
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:15,993
I'll be here wishing you the best

249
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,146
Sorry, I took your carton of instant noodles... -
Monkey

250
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,731
Miss Sun

251
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,108
It's been a long time!

252
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,444
Oh, you are...?

253
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,206
Don't you remember?
Back then when you were a showgirl in Sanlitun

254
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,717
I saw your performance!

255
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,256
Your troupe leader Song was my buddy

256
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,448
You're mistaken

257
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,850
I've never been to Sanlitun

258
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,317
Hsian Ping, you're an assistant director now!

259
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,547
You gonna be a director next

260
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,553
You make it sound like a curse!

261
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,058
Jian-dong, my handsome man
Hsian Ping can make you a star!

262
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,395
Damn right!

263
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,158
Let's make a toast to our future
big shot director!

264
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,497
Stop jinxing me! Just drink up!

265
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,913
I could hardly recognize you

266
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,489
You come here often?

267
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:55,620
No

268
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,557
A classmate of mine got hired
as an assistant director

269
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,492
We came here to celebrate

270
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,721
So you're in film school

271
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,029
Yep

272
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,926
Is it fun to make movies?

273
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,771
Hey, what's your real name?

274
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,765
Call me Monkey!

275
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,369
My last name is Sun
same as the mythical Monkey King

276
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,777
- And you've come to Beijing to...
- Sing!

277
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,350
Who's going to be my audience in the village?
And you? An aspiring actor?

278
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,846
An aspiring director!

279
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,495
So "Hongkonger", I still owe you noodles

280
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,586
We'll meet again for sure!

281
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,396
Embarrassing, wasn't it?

282
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,491
You don't recognize the guy
but you do know the song, right?

283
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,791
I'd like to take a rest if you don't mind

284
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,637
You were so cute in those days

285
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,965
We've never met

286
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,405
Never

287
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,803
Knock it off!

288
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,841
You're driving too slow!

289
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,142
I'm sorry, ma'am!

290
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,614
So who was this girl I met ten years ago?
A ghost?

291
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,245
Whatever

292
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,121
Who you thought you met never existed

293
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,153
Ghost or not...

294
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,860
You know what scares me most?

295
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,804
...is that she never loved me

296
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,031
Then I've been a fool for ten years

297
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:24,738
Stop the car!

298
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,839
Miss Sun!

299
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,308
Lin Jian-dong!

300
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,183
I looked for you in the dorm

301
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,448
But they said you've moved out

302
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,715
When did you come back?!

303
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,622
Just now! And I came for you right away!

304
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,259
I'm going back to Hong Kong next week

305
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,721
You've graduated?

306
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,393
Nah... I...

307
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,195
I'm dropping out

308
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,466
What about directing?

309
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:32,065
I don't have the talent... I can't pretend

310
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,844
How do you know you don't have talent?

311
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,013
Do you have to raise your voice?

312
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,809
I mean, it's not like
you've made a few films already

313
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,077
How do you know you aren't talented?

314
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,623
Didn't you quit already?
What are the books for?

315
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,321
For the library! And I'll submit my resignation!

316
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:01,703
Hey!

317
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,273
Monkey, I'm not like you... invincible!

318
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,677
I do fall apart sometimes, you just don't see it!

319
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,770
There's no fun if everything comes easy

320
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,441
I blew all my money on the shoot...
even next term's tuition fee

321
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,109
Just come stay with me!

322
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,018
I'm getting by! I can take care of you!

323
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,054
It's your turn to owe me something

324
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,605
The troupe is disbanded

325
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:12,743
No way!

326
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,241
Such is life!

327
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:20,080
Nothing is certain! I might be a movie star
the next time you bump into me!

328
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,548
You want to be an actress?

329
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,644
A pub, at most, can only fit 100 people

330
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,189
But a single theatre can fit a few hundred!

331
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,520
Who would not want to be a movie star?

332
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,560
C'mon in!

333
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,260
Watch your head!

334
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,771
This ceiling is fine for me as long as
I don't grow taller

335
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,702
I'm stocked up with goods here
and that means extra income

336
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,905
If you tidy up the place sometimes
that would pay your rent

337
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,817
An art director is still a director, I suppose

338
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,218
Still, I'm a bit disappointed

339
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,591
I was counting on you to make me a star
once you become "the director"

340
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,364
I was kidding!

341
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,767
If you're determined to be a star

342
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,405
You can make it

343
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,238
You think so?

344
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,878
Because you're invincible

345
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,676
Quite true

346
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,614
Let's drink to that!

347
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,255
Good!

348
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,387
We'll drink to that!

349
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:47,361
A long, long time ago

350
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:54,640
You belonged to me; I belonged to you

351
00:31:56,281 --> 00:32:00,877
A long, long time ago

352
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:07,416
You left me to explore the world out there

353
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,224
The world out there is so spectacular

354
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:20,931
The world out there is so forlorn

355
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:28,707
While you're enjoying the world out there

356
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,977
I'll be here wishing you the best

357
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,417
A long, long time ago

358
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:42,855
You left me to explore the world out there

359
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,762
The world out there is so spectacular

360
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,653
Zhang Yang reunites with Xiao-yu in the circus

361
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,882
Bad news: She's become amnesiac!

362
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:14,650
And worse...

363
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,090
The circus master has already won her over...

364
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,593
...by providing her beautiful stories of her past

365
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:35,808
Once upon a time, he had a love story

366
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,414
Days of romance and youth

367
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,583
A sweet story to tell

368
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,879
Xiao-yu... that was your name!

369
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,077
We grew up together

370
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:49,454
Once upon a time
they were childhood sweethearts

371
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,854
His charm, her affection...

372
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,927
...inspiring envy

373
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:58,398
Then one day the girl lost her memory

374
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,127
A beginning hard to forget

375
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,203
An ending hard to remember

376
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,171
Enough! I'm happy as I am!

377
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:10,678
A loss so tragic, where truth lies

378
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:15,182
Not knowing, a blessing in disguise

379
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:19,619
The boy with a beautiful memory

380
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:24,694
The girl without a past, a mystery

381
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:25,886
Monkey

382
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,558
Are you happy?

383
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,833
What's your trick?

384
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,334
How can you always remain happy?

385
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,474
Do you remember?

386
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,110
I used to hold you just like this

387
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,387
Once upon a time, he had a sad story

388
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,894
Without a happy ending he won't surrender

389
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:05,263
Passion burns to shine, a brief history

390
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:10,705
Irony of fate, why hold onto misery?

391
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:17,677
Forget this love story come what may

392
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:22,149
Why not drink and dream your sorrows away?

393
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:26,620
Remembering changes nothing anyway

394
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:32,128
Will knowing the past begin a new day?

395
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:41,566
Once upon a time, I had a love story

396
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:46,132
I wonder, was it real...

397
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,938
...or fantasy?

398
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,190
Cut

399
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,355
Cut!

400
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,497
That's it for today!

401
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,468
- Mr. Nie...
- We'll continue tomorrow

402
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:21,002
We still haven't got the circus master...
who do we shoot with tomorrow?

403
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,879
I'll be the circus master!

404
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,477
Mr. Nie

405
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,835
Hot and sour noodles

406
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:01,640
Thanks

407
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:07,152
Remember your first movie?
It was shot right here!

408
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:11,088
You came here for my noodles everyday!

409
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,988
You gulped it down fast every time

410
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,031
Yes!

411
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,173
I was always hungry in those days

412
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,102
What happens to my appetite now?

413
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,742
You used to say, the sooner you finish a film...

414
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,809
...the faster you prove yourself a good director

415
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,291
Am I still a good director?

416
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:52,893
Stay asleep, in the dream within a dream

417
00:37:53,037 --> 00:38:00,307
From this day on, no more doubts

418
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:08,282
All I'm asking is a word from your heart

419
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:16,359
Say you loved me... all along

420
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:40,240
That will be all, just say no more

421
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:49,987
Because... you do love me

422
00:38:54,732 --> 00:39:06,109
Perhaps... you do love me

423
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,132
I'm enjoying this more and more!

424
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:35,730
I had a long chat with Zhang Ji this afternoon

425
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,975
For old times' sake

426
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:43,273
He promised to ditch the other deal
to do the role of the circus master

427
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,818
It's too tiring for you to direct and act as well!

428
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,693
What is it?

429
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,359
Am I not big enough?

430
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,634
With Zhang, you can recoup a couple
more millions in European sales

431
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,635
Why bother being an actor?

432
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,473
Zhang taught you that?

433
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,140
You taught me that

434
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,952
Would you care so much about me
if I hadn't made you a star?

435
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,081
If my film sucks...

436
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,623
- Will anyone care about me?
- Nie Wen!

437
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,897
Enough!

438
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,260
I'm not your child!

439
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,535
"Nie Wen", "Nie Wen"...Iong before you
became Sun Na, I'd already made Nie Wen!

440
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,136
When is the shoot? Can I visit?

441
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,143
Deal! It's the day after tomorrow!

442
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,723
Is the film going to be shown in America?

443
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,383
Yes, of course!

444
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,927
The American producer also said...

445
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,498
...don't know if he's serious though...

446
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,434
...that he'll marry me

447
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,976
A paper marriage! Otherwise
who would marry a fifty-year-old?!

448
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,975
He's probably teasing me

449
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,116
He knows I want to go to America

450
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,518
Is that what you want?

451
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,818
Of course! All film people dream
of going to Hollywood!

452
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,655
Who's going to watch the films made here?

453
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:25,964
He also said that I'm petite...
only a head shorter than average...

454
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:30,434
But in America, I'd be three heads shorter!
That would make me very special!

455
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,882
And much easier to visit you in Hong Kong
with an American passport!

456
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,643
Don't look...

457
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:25,817
It's a wonderful world out there

458
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:30,832
If I go out, how will I fare?

459
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:37,869
The world out there has so much to share

460
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:43,172
I can be free if only I dare

461
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:50,149
I can't see the present in my despair

462
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,882
Out there I'll see what my future will bear

463
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:03,262
The choice is not easy, I just can't compare

464
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:12,533
Blow out a candle
make a wish with this breath of air

465
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:19,775
It's a wonderful world out there

466
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:24,944
I'll find love and someone to care

467
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:31,856
Out there where there're chances to spare

468
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:37,194
I'll learn who I am, in the world so rare

469
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,362
Neither of us is going anywhere...

470
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,105
You aren't going to America

471
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,140
I'm not returning to Hong Kong

472
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:20,701
Where's the director?

473
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,846
Nobody's coming; just you and me
