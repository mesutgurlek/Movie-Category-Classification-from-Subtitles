1
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,868
I'm coming, Anna

2
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,870
Brother!
Wake up

3
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,544
I'm Nikki, not Anna

4
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:02,916
Get up now

5
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,678
oh, what's the problem that
you had to wake me so early!

6
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,748
I'd be married if only
you had waited

7
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,820
Married, did you say!

8
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,752
It's nothing... nothing at all.
What's the time anyway?

9
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:17,861
8 O' clock

10
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,894
If I'm late today too...

11
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,635
...Imran'll give me hell...

12
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,940
And I must be at the station
by 12 as well!

13
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,270
My goodness!
So many pictures of Anna!

14
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:40,678
She's in English literature.
In Economics...

15
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,184
In Psychology too!

16
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,719
I've only one favorite
subject...

17
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,582
Anna... Anna... And Anna!

18
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,259
She doesn't love you
though

19
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,433
But she likes me, doesn't she?
She'll love me too

20
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,938
Exactly at five past 12!

21
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:03,832
Oh, that's why you're going
to the station! She's coming

22
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,978
yes, after a whole year!
I want that when she gets off...

23
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,476
...It's my face that she
sees first

24
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,409
How happy she'll be
to see me!

25
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:19,120
Wear this jacket.
In this, you look very...

26
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,957
Sunil, Nikki!
- Coming. Just a minute

27
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,160
Here, give it to me, Mummy.
Why trouble yourself

28
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,371
Nikki said you had to go
to the Bank

29
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:35,072
Have you any errands? I'm
here to run them for you

30
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,805
No errands.
- Nothing?

31
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,207
Oh yes! You've to go to the
market then. For rations

32
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:45,316
I haven't to go to the Bank,
or get rations or need oil!

33
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,588
You've got this week's pocket
money. So don't butter me up!

34
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,882
Call your father, Nikki.
Breakfast's getting cold

35
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,590
That's what I like about
Mummy... No Nonsense

36
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:01,029
Papa, breakfast is ready

37
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,103
Coming. I'll just wash
my hands

38
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:08,701
I told you once.
Not a paisa'll you get!

39
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:13,175
Mom, please. Just 30 bucks.
Ok then, make it 20

40
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:22,319
Sunil, my beloved son,
you want money, do you?

41
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,518
You can ask me, your Dad,
can't you

42
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,587
I'll give however much
you want, my son

43
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,092
Considering you're such a
good son...

44
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,295
And how proud I'm of you

45
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,425
For failing not once or even
twice but THRICE!

46
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,633
In all subjects on one
occasion!

47
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,666
How can you work in
your Dad's garage!

48
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,603
Won't the grease dirty
your hands?

49
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:50,416
No, my son. You were born
to do such great deeds!

50
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:56,423
You're so kind as to give me
the chance to be your father

51
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,288
Now you do what you want

52
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:05,123
Stay out all day and even
the night too!

53
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:11,031
Go and play in a stupid band
with your useless friends

54
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,667
And play this rotten
stupid horn!

55
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,405
It's a trumpet, not a horn.
- Whatever!

56
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:20,338
It's not a stupid band.
We play very good music

57
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,509
As for your garage, I'll
never work there

58
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,546
So you'll play a damn horn
all your life? How'll you eat

59
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,913
Let me pass and I'll find
some job

60
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:31,123
Let him pass!

61
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:35,394
Heard that Prabha? As if wE
are stopping him from passing

62
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,358
And if you fail?

63
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,656
Fail?
The question doesn't arise!

64
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,526
It has! 3 years in a row!

65
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,803
But I'll pass this year.
No matter what

66
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,870
If you don't, it's the
garage. Understand?

67
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,042
I do.
- What did you understand?

68
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:53,212
I fail and that's the end of
music and the garage begins

69
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,980
I'm off.
- Your breakfast...

70
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,326
Can't you even stop to wish
me properly!?

71
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,967
I'm in a hurry

72
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,767
Hurry or no, you mustn't
forget your manners surely

73
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:27,038
well, drop me at the church.
- But it's the other way!

74
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,008
Whether you go one way
or the other...

75
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:33,687
...all paths lead to God

76
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,553
I must reach for the rehearsal,
Father

77
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,824
Slow... slow down, my son

78
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,031
I do know heaven is
beautiful...

79
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,199
but I'm in no hurry to go
there

80
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,373
Easy now. Why do you go
so fast?

81
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:58,974
I've been late 3 days running
and Imran will eat me alive!

82
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,981
What's the excuse today?

83
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,161
Believe me, it's no excuse.
I ran into Father Braganza

84
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,694
He asked me drop him to
the Church. What could I do?

85
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:56,062
The same excuse as yesterday.
- But I lied yesterday!

86
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:57,461
Believe me, I really met him!

87
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:03,234
How can I? You've to go to
the bank or get rations

88
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,736
And even queue up for oil!

89
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,238
If nothing else, it's
Father Braganza!

90
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,483
Let it be, Imran. At least
he has a new excuse every day

91
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:13,811
Shut up, yezdi!

92
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,958
My brother spoke to Patel
and he has agreed

93
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,495
Forgive me, Imran. Forgive
me, yaar

94
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,637
Hey Imran, who's this Patel?

95
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,032
Manager of Chinatown. Wants
a good band for the club

96
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:40,380
It's our first chance to turn
professional. Mustn't blow it.

97
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,343
Smita's getting married.
Who'll sing in her place?

98
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,484
That can wait, yezdi... well,
what are our chances, Tony?

99
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:50,619
It's done. Patel is a good
pal of my brother Richie

100
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,016
He'll take us to Chinatown
this evening to meet Patel

101
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:57,421
Today?
- An audition and it's ours!

102
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,370
A terrific new song
to make Patel happy!

103
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,606
Don't you worry, yaar

104
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,769
ok, Sunil. Get started.
Tony, your guitar...

105
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,074
Think of the lyrics, the tune

106
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,570
Make it quick, tho'.
I must go

107
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:15,777
Go where?

108
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,246
Anna is coming today.
- Anna?

109
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,777
Quiet, yaar. No body must
know this

110
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,052
you said you'd go to
the interview with me

111
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:27,656
Damn your interview! You'll
never get a job, so why go!

112
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,261
What to do! My Dad almost
canes me into going!

113
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:35,525
Sunil, stop yakking and get
to work. Be serious, yaar

114
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,237
yes, Imran. I was thinking...
the tune must be romantic...

115
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,736
And emphasize the melody...
Isn't that so

116
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,342
Correct! Melody means
sweetness...

117
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,739
...which'll enter the heart
thro' the ears...

118
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,814
Think of the words for
a romantic tune

119
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:55,849
what'll be the tune...
And what'll be its theme?

120
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:14,731
I got it! I got the theme
for the song!

121
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:20,511
The theme is... A lover
is waiting impatiently...

122
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:26,083
...for his beloved to return...
on a railway platform!

123
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,911
And I know who the girl is...
Anna!

124
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,590
Super! Sunil, go on.
Tell us, yaar

125
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,131
The lover is young and
very handsome

126
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,196
The train goes thro' the
jungle...

127
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,264
The girl's looking out
of the window

128
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:53,413
The trees rustle and sway

129
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,614
There's a monkey on a tree...
Quiet, you monkey!

130
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,845
Birds flying in the sky...

131
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,049
yes. I can see them too!

132
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,963
A tunnel thro' the mountains

133
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,659
And an engine hooting
again and again...

134
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:44,488
"Crazy...
This heart is crazy"

135
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:53,306
"This heart's crazy for you"

136
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:57,676
"How long have I waited
for you"

137
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:02,209
"when will you come,
o love of my life"

138
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,382
"How long have I waited
for you"

139
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:10,846
"when will you come,
o love of my life"

140
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:15,354
"The more I try
and quieten..."

141
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:19,597
"...the more excited
is this my heart"

142
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:28,674
"Crazy...
This heart is crazy"

143
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:37,950
"This heart's crazy for you"

144
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:05,389
The train's got stuck.
How I wish Chris was here!

145
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,061
But he's in Bangalore

146
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:30,751
Good you're back

147
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,281
know why we're writing it?
- Why?

148
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,581
For Patel.
- Oh, Chinatown!

149
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,595
The song's stuck now.
- Why?

150
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:42,331
Help us with the song.
Let's start again

151
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:46,160
Be quick, ok? I must go.
- Why?

152
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:49,234
Because Anna's coming.
- Anna? That's great, yaar!

153
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,971
That's why I got back quickly
from Bangalore

154
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,377
She'll be back in the band.
- This is really good

155
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:58,680
Damn! He is going too!

156
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,243
I thought I'd be going alone
to receive Anna

157
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,613
Chris, tell Anna we'll meet
her at the bakery today

158
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,384
Let's start

159
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:15,361
you look very happy, yaar.
- Of course. Anna's coming

160
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,824
But you needn't receive her.
- Why?

161
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:22,538
Her brother Albert'll fetch her.
He said so

162
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,270
of course. But I shall go.
I've waited for this moment

163
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,971
you needn't check the watch.
Do trains ever come on time!

164
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:33,579
They're always late... 2 or 4
or even 6 hours late

165
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:36,009
yesterday it was 12 hours late!

166
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:40,154
12 HoURS! If it were me,
I'd never go.

167
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:42,550
But I will go...
however late it may be!

168
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,521
Come here, Chris

169
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:49,663
Help finish the song.
- You've to go, as it is

170
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,329
Imran, I too must go early.

171
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:57,964
Going to the station?
- What'll I do there!

172
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:01,640
An errand for my Dad
and you know him...

173
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:09,716
Guys, Chinatown Club this
evening. What time, Tony?

174
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:11,250
7 o' Clock

175
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:16,683
we'll start with the song

176
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,443
"Showing off a style
all her own"

177
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:49,055
"To dazzle us with charms
a hundred more"

178
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:53,455
"Showing off a style
all her own"

179
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,789
"To dazzle us with charms
a hundred more"

180
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:02,127
"She will come
bringing spring with her"

181
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:06,839
"And make the garden bloom"

182
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:15,678
"oh please come now.
My dearest love"

183
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:23,120
"Crazy...
This heart is crazy"

184
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:28,687
"How long have I
waited for you"

185
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:33,026
"when will you come,
o love of my life"

186
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:37,404
"The more I try
and quieten..."

187
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:42,234
"...the more excited
is this my heart"

188
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:18,678
"I still treasure
in my heart..."

189
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:23,178
"...your silken scarf"

190
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,617
"I still treasure
in my heart..."

191
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:32,223
"...your silken scarf"

192
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:36,497
"what more can I say,
my darling"

193
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:41,064
"Come see for yourself
the state I am in"

194
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:49,803
"oh please come now,
my dearest love"

195
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:58,019
"Crazy...
This heart is crazy"

196
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:25,474
"wishing on a falling star..."

197
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:29,978
"It was you, my darling,
that I asked of God"

198
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:38,924
"wishing on a falling star..."

199
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:43,391
"It was you, my darling,
that I asked of God"

200
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:48,066
"Should all the stars in
heaven fall"

201
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:52,570
"This is the only wish
I will pray for"

202
00:19:52,809 --> 00:20:00,739
"oh please come now
my dearest love"

203
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:09,952
"Crazy...
this heart is crazy"

204
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:14,223
"How long have I
waited for you"

205
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:18,556
"when will you come,
o love of my life"

206
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:23,135
"How long have I
waited for you"

207
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:27,840
"when will you come,
o love of my life"

208
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:32,013
"The more I try
and quieten..."

209
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:37,012
"...the more excited
is this my heart"

210
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:45,456
"Crazy...
this heart is crazy"

211
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:54,827
"Crazy...
I am crazy for you"

212
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,073
Here, take this. Oh, it's
so long since I saw you

213
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,782
you are more beautiful and
adorable than ever

214
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:46,884
Started off again! Flattery
is such an old habit of yours

215
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:48,753
No, it's perfectly true

216
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,598
you're really more beautiful
and adorable

217
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:56,728
Stop flattering me.
What else is new?

218
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:01,665
Oh, I forgot to tell you
something

219
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:03,305
well... what?

220
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:04,938
I am in love

221
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:10,082
who is she?

222
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:14,916
She is so beautiful
and adorable, Anna

223
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:21,794
But you said all this to me
just now!

224
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:24,522
Yes, because yoU are
the girl I love, Anna

225
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,767
Albert is here... Albert!

226
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:48,450
Sorry, the car stalled half-way.
Hope you had no trouble

227
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:50,190
Absolutely none.
Sunil was here

228
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:52,724
what's he doing here?

229
00:22:56,497 --> 00:22:58,397
So you came to receive Anna

230
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:00,256
oh no. I came to receive
my friend

231
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:04,828
He was right here. Must've
gone home

232
00:23:05,072 --> 00:23:07,666
The flowers? Where're
they from?

233
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:10,804
From there...
- From the tea shop?

234
00:23:11,212 --> 00:23:12,770
Tea shops sell flowers!

235
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:14,213
Who sells tea then?

236
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:17,947
Oh, Albert! He came to meet me, ok?

237
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:23,186
Take the keys. Wait outside.
We'll bring the luggage

238
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:26,254
Hey, where're you off to?

239
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:29,755
To fetch a coolie...
Coolie... Coolie

240
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:32,365
No need. We two can manage

241
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,701
All this up to the car?
- No. To the house

242
00:23:48,783 --> 00:23:53,447
your Papa made this cake

243
00:23:55,256 --> 00:23:57,053
what a lovely cake
you've baked!

244
00:23:58,092 --> 00:24:00,788
Well, stop praising me
and eat your cake

245
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:07,625
Stop staring at the cake!

246
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,234
Looks like you'll eat it up
with your eyes

247
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:13,733
A small piece... please!

248
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:16,770
Look at yourself first!
You've diabetes as it is

249
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:19,840
But Mary, one tiny piece!

250
00:24:20,214 --> 00:24:23,115
I made this cake with such
love in my own bakery

251
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:25,952
And I can't get to eat
even a tiny piece!

252
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,213
What did the doctor say? No
sweets if you want to live!

253
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,525
It's God's punishment.
Rightly so!

254
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:36,129
What's the connection
between God and my diabetes!

255
00:24:40,134 --> 00:24:44,434
Anna, my child, tell me...
how's the cake?

256
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:52,939
Anna darling, please... won't
you give me a small piece...

257
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:09,522
The piece with the cherry,
Anna...

258
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:12,260
Please, Mummy isn't here

259
00:25:20,274 --> 00:25:22,936
Mmm... I had soaked the
cherries in brandy

260
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:24,141
Mummy!

261
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:32,814
Simon! Look here!

262
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,590
Oh Sunil! Careful! You're
lugging so many cases!

263
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,326
The poor chap just wouldn't
listen when I said I'd help

264
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,536
Hello Sunil. Doing fine
I guess

265
00:25:53,908 --> 00:25:58,345
Are your results out, Sunil?
- Not yet. Lots of time still

266
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:00,538
we all know he'll fail

267
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:03,340
Enough, Sunil.
It's been too much

268
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:07,814
you must give up this habit
of failing all the time

269
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:11,116
you ought to pay some
attention to studies, eh?

270
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:14,823
Look, why don't you take
Chris for an example?

271
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:17,130
Oh, Chris's case is
entirely different, Dad

272
00:26:17,498 --> 00:26:21,832
Stood first in class and
joined his father's office

273
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:24,671
And he's good at music too!

274
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:27,473
Stop it. You're after
this poor guy!

275
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:33,277
Here, Sunil. Have some cake
and come with me

276
00:26:35,282 --> 00:26:37,546
Get ready, Dad. I'll drop
you at the bakery

277
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:39,510
I must take the car to
the garage

278
00:26:41,655 --> 00:26:43,555
See this tie?
It's for Albert

279
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:46,091
And for me?

280
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:48,920
How do you like these
goggles?

281
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:53,091
I got them for Chris

282
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,837
Nice... what've you got
for me, Anna?

283
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:03,267
Couldn't get anything for
you tho' I wanted to

284
00:27:03,544 --> 00:27:05,569
In fact, I saw a very nice
thing...

285
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:09,077
An ideal gift for you

286
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,608
But as it happened...

287
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:14,013
I ran out of money when
I bought all this stuff

288
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:20,893
oh, it doesn't matter, Anna.
After all...

289
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:26,024
It's enough you at least
thought of me

290
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,561
And anyway, it's feeling
that counts

291
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,600
Gifts don't matter much

292
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:49,514
How's it possible I wouldn't
bring anything for you?

293
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:23,786
Sunil plays the mouth organ
so well

294
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:27,052
It's nothing. Just put it
to your lips and blow!

295
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:29,691
No, Albert. It's an art

296
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:34,063
It's like... sitting by the
lake on a January afternoon...

297
00:28:34,335 --> 00:28:38,101
...under a cherry tree and
eating a strawberry cake

298
00:28:39,106 --> 00:28:42,769
Simon, you're forbidden
even to think of sweets!

299
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:54,283
It's really very nice

300
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:57,215
we're all coming to meet you
at the bakery this evening

301
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:22,748
Sunil! You here?

302
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:26,019
You said you had to run
an errand for your Dad

303
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,081
I had to but Dad sent me off
to the Station with a parcel

304
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:32,355
And luckily, I met Anna
over there, yaar

305
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,986
But what happened to you?
I waited 'n waited for you!

306
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:39,265
I had a flat on the way

307
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:42,431
It was tough getting a taxi
and when I reached...

308
00:29:43,237 --> 00:29:44,397
It was too late, right?

309
00:29:45,072 --> 00:29:47,973
I'm so sorry. Meeting at the
station is so very different

310
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:50,601
No matter. Go and meet Anna now

311
00:29:51,645 --> 00:29:54,739
Listen, Sunil. How's Anna?

312
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,612
Yaar, did she ask anything
about me?

313
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:00,986
She asked after everybody...
Hmm, she did ask about you...

314
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:02,322
I can't remember what

315
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:05,582
you can't imagine how
excited I am

316
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:07,554
I'm feeling so strange...

317
00:30:16,036 --> 00:30:21,064
oh my God! Braganza!
- Hey, Imran!

318
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:26,771
Sorry, I couldn't see you,
Father

319
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:30,814
Drop me at vinayak's garage.
- I'm going the other way

320
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:33,210
No matter. Whether you go...

321
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:36,283
...this way or the other,
all paths lead to God

322
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:38,491
But first, I must go
to the garage

323
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:41,092
which leakage are you
talking of, Albert?

324
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:43,953
This leakage, that leakage!

325
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:47,664
The one you repaired 2 days
ago! It's leaking again

326
00:30:48,335 --> 00:30:51,862
I told you to get it welded
and the engine overhauled!

327
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:55,234
But uncle...
- Must change all the parts

328
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:58,737
why don't you repair all
leakages at one go?

329
00:31:00,214 --> 00:31:03,513
Why're you two fighting?
- Ask him, Father

330
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:09,318
It was repaired yesterday and
now it leaks! What am I to do

331
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,151
How am I to blame, Father!
It's junk. An old heap!

332
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:15,119
I told him it needs
overhauling

333
00:31:15,362 --> 00:31:16,852
All he gets done are
patch ups

334
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:22,327
why not sell this, put in
some money and buy a cycle?

335
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,697
This isn't your tempo.
It's a CAR!

336
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:29,065
Now children, no fighting

337
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:32,471
Tell me, vinayak.
What's the problem?

338
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,214
Ask me what problems
it HASN'T!

339
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:38,618
Well, the problem it HASN'T?
- Everything's a problem

340
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:42,314
The engine. Engine, you know?
- Yes, the engine

341
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,485
It must be overhauled

342
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:47,691
The entire wiring's in
a rat's belly!

343
00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:50,196
Rat's belly?
- Yes, rats eat the wires

344
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:54,558
Albert, now you tell me.
What's the problem?

345
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:57,062
What can I say, Father?
I'm getting late for work

346
00:31:59,073 --> 00:32:00,973
you just repair this leakage now

347
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,444
I'll pick it up this evening

348
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:07,175
well Father, I must go

349
00:32:09,616 --> 00:32:11,641
keep your class going

350
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:16,355
Potato pohe, specially made
for you

351
00:32:17,191 --> 00:32:19,216
And this sweet, for our
New year

352
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:22,489
oh, today is Gudi Padva,
your New year

353
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:25,423
How's it?

354
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:29,695
Delicious... Really very good

355
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:32,297
Sunil likes it very much too

356
00:32:33,874 --> 00:32:36,570
Talk to Sunil. He doesn't
intend to pass ever, it seems!

357
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:42,907
Sunil is a very good boy.
Let him live his own way

358
00:32:45,686 --> 00:32:46,948
Sunil! Look out!

359
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:55,057
What've you done!
You hit it!

360
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:58,330
Thank you, God! It's safe!
- Safe! It's fully damaged

361
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,466
Sunil, look out

362
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,012
He seems most dangerous!
- Come on, run

363
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:16,082
Run! Instead of Chinatown,
we'll end up in hospital!

364
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:22,980
Come on. Run!
- The bastards have run away

365
00:33:25,526 --> 00:33:26,686
ok... we'll see later

366
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:30,090
Hurry. We must go to the docks.
The goods are landing

367
00:33:42,142 --> 00:33:43,939
A band is already playing here

368
00:33:44,545 --> 00:33:47,673
It's only temporary...
oh, Mr. Patel

369
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:50,507
How're you, Richie?
- Fine

370
00:33:50,884 --> 00:33:51,612
I heard you're getting married

371
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:55,979
well, these are the boys
you were praising so, eh?

372
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,719
They're very talented, Mr. Patel

373
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:01,986
I'll introduce everybody

374
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:05,457
He's Imran, plays drums
superbly. This is Chris

375
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:08,495
what! Not a single girl
in your group!?

376
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:11,996
We do have Anna.
She sings very well

377
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:17,337
Now tell me when you can start

378
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:21,474
what! You mean we have
been employed!

379
00:34:24,818 --> 00:34:28,276
Read the terms and conditions
and sign the contract now

380
00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:36,786
Throw the bastards out!
Call this music!

381
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:42,702
This damn Patel! Where does
he pick such rotten bands!

382
00:34:59,786 --> 00:35:00,946
Please... oh, don't throw
the glasses!

383
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:02,948
They cost 300 a dozen!

384
00:35:03,357 --> 00:35:07,350
Throw this rotten band out!
Or we'll throw the glasses!

385
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:17,726
Play a fast tune

386
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:30,473
Look, Richie. The public
here is mad

387
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:33,018
A rough crowd.
Absolute hooligans

388
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:35,855
They throw glasses if they
don't like the music

389
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,480
As for this band...

390
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:44,591
No experience at all. What
to do! They begged, groveled

391
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:46,023
Asked me to give them
a break

392
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,334
And I gave them their
first chance!

393
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:52,768
Enough! No more!

394
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,598
I won't give anyone a first
chance in Chinatown!

395
00:36:17,064 --> 00:36:21,057
Why're you silent?
Why don't you tell me?

396
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:24,131
Of course we played

397
00:36:25,906 --> 00:36:28,374
we played a lot, Mr. Patel.

398
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:33,744
And this public's nothing,
Mr. Patel. NoTHING

399
00:36:34,114 --> 00:36:36,241
we played to a far more
dangerous crowd

400
00:36:36,516 --> 00:36:37,540
what!?
- Yes

401
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:40,852
our band was to do a show...
- what was the Club called?

402
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:48,383
Enter the Dragon Club!

403
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:50,791
The name sounds familiar

404
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:56,591
They throw only glasses here.
There they throw plates

405
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,706
Pick up 'n throw!
Pick up 'n throw...

406
00:37:02,075 --> 00:37:03,406
Enough!

407
00:37:03,777 --> 00:37:05,039
Even the waiters throw plates!

408
00:37:05,412 --> 00:37:06,902
Waiters?
- Yes

409
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:12,045
Go in, my son... Never say
such things before waiters!

410
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:15,112
What happened then?

411
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:16,421
What else, Mr. Patel!

412
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:20,021
We began to play and
there was pin-drop silence!

413
00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:24,619
And the whole crowd began
to wag its tail like a cow

414
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:26,258
wagged its tail like a cow?

415
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:29,865
But cows don't wag tails!
- They don't?

416
00:37:31,872 --> 00:37:34,102
They wagged tails like dogs!
- Like dogs?

417
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,776
You remember? How they
cheered and threw money...

418
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:42,310
Pounds, Dollars, Rials...

419
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:44,946
one guy threw gold biscuits!
- Gold biscuits?

420
00:37:45,218 --> 00:37:50,622
Yes. One of them hit Imran.
See the scar. Right, Imran?

421
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:53,792
No, Sunil. Stop it now

422
00:37:54,728 --> 00:37:59,358
Mr. Patel, the truth is we've
never performed in public

423
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:01,131
But believe me...
- wHAT!

424
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:04,898
Believe me. Our band is good

425
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:07,137
A 1000 times better than
what you've here

426
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:10,200
If they start throwing
plates here...

427
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:12,172
I'll have to quit TowN
and go to CHINA!

428
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:15,443
Please go...
Go, please

429
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:42,102
Don't do it, Sunil

430
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:47,812
I said stop it, yaar

431
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,510
why're you doing it?
Imran's getting irritated

432
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,448
This irritates Imran and
Imran irritates me!

433
00:38:56,923 --> 00:38:59,949
Why tell Patel we had never
played in public?

434
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:02,955
Don't start that again!
- Imran is right

435
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,264
we needn't lie to get work

436
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:07,759
How'd a small lie harm us!

437
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:10,498
What harm!? It'd be
outright deception

438
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,638
Cheating? We weren't
printing counterfeit notes!

439
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:18,236
A small lie and our worked
be done. Right, Anna?

440
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:23,047
Absolutely wrong! You ought
to be ashamed of it, Sunil

441
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,681
Even a lie must've limits.
Enter the Dragon Club indeed!

442
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:33,990
We had such hopes this time.
Almost on the last rung...

443
00:39:34,494 --> 00:39:38,692
But I don't know why these
things happen only to us

444
00:39:42,235 --> 00:39:44,726
It doesn't matter, Chris.
It'll be all right

445
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,170
Don't feel depressed

446
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:05,116
I don't know why these
things happen only to us

447
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:14,526
I must say it was a good try

448
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:17,829
Some tall story, huh!
Waiters throwing plates...

449
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:21,402
you'll jump with joy!
Know what?

450
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:23,470
Patel's dead, right?
- No, yaar

451
00:40:23,743 --> 00:40:26,109
Richie has given us a chance
to play at his wedding

452
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,048
But he had booked
another band

453
00:40:29,316 --> 00:40:31,250
Cancelled! We'll play instead

454
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,457
Another thing. Patel will be
there. If he likes our music...

455
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:40,852
Chinatown is certain!

456
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,502
You guys are ready?
- Absolutely

457
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:04,083
Mr. Patel come.
We've written a new song

458
00:41:08,388 --> 00:41:11,414
I'm so thirsty, Sunil,
- I'll get you a drink

459
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:32,611
what a nice pair Chris
and Anna make!

460
00:41:33,513 --> 00:41:34,912
Oh, there come Chris' parents!

461
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:47,158
I can't understand why he's
so taken with a bakery girl

462
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:55,359
Charles... There's something
we've to talk to you

463
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:57,200
Charles, the D'Cunhas are here

464
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:07,412
Sharon... where's Sharon?
I don't see her

465
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:08,841
There she is

466
00:42:15,221 --> 00:42:17,485
what's this, Sharon! You
grow prettier every day!

467
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,883
Perhaps it's my dress
that you complement!

468
00:42:22,028 --> 00:42:25,361
Have you met Chris yet?
- No

469
00:42:25,732 --> 00:42:28,098
No? I'll call him right
away. Chris!

470
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:29,960
Come here, Chris

471
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,173
Certainly. I'll drop by
suddenly someday! Ok?

472
00:42:42,415 --> 00:42:43,905
Chris, Patel is here!
- Where?

473
00:42:44,617 --> 00:42:47,643
Hey, take care!

474
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:50,155
What've you done to
yourself, Mr. Patel!?

475
00:42:50,757 --> 00:42:52,657
Please don't ask me, brother!

476
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:55,386
What happened? Accident?
- No no!

477
00:42:55,662 --> 00:42:58,563
Fell off a balcony?
- Oh no! What a thing to say

478
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:00,993
The balcony fell on you?
- Nonsense, man!

479
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:02,392
Then what did happen?

480
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:06,696
What else! I sacked the old
band and got a new one

481
00:43:07,173 --> 00:43:11,507
Absolutely dynamic.
Absolutely experienced!

482
00:43:12,112 --> 00:43:14,239
When they started playing...

483
00:43:19,552 --> 00:43:20,917
you'll find some way or
the other

484
00:43:55,054 --> 00:43:58,080
"why not we delight
in our love"

485
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:01,689
"why not we hold
each other in our arms"

486
00:44:02,061 --> 00:44:05,462
"I found my true friend.
Yes my true friend"

487
00:44:05,732 --> 00:44:09,190
"I found my love.
Yes my true love"

488
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:12,438
"Restless desires are
tranquil today"

489
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:15,934
"Becalmed today
are the love-crazed..."

490
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:19,767
"...love's passionate
devotees"

491
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:24,709
"Comfort and joy have I found
in the love of my life"

492
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:28,542
"I found my true friend.
Yes my true love"

493
00:44:28,955 --> 00:44:32,083
"Restless desires are
tranquil today"

494
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:35,587
"Becalmed today
are the love-crazed..."

495
00:44:35,962 --> 00:44:39,523
"...love's passionate
devotees"

496
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:44,361
"Comfort and joy have I found
in the love of my life"

497
00:44:44,771 --> 00:44:48,298
"I found my true friend.
Yes my true love"

498
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:30,312
"See how brightly
love's name is adorned"

499
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:34,383
"My true friend shines
in this company of friends"

500
00:45:37,624 --> 00:45:40,855
"See how brightly
love's name is adorned"

501
00:45:41,227 --> 00:45:44,458
"My true friend shines
in this company of friends"

502
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:48,291
"Now my heart says..."

503
00:45:48,568 --> 00:45:52,004
"Come and embrace,
my rosy-cheeked love"

504
00:45:52,238 --> 00:45:55,139
"Restless desires
are tranquil today"

505
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:58,639
"Becalmed today
are the love-crazed..."

506
00:45:58,912 --> 00:46:02,370
"...love's passionate
devotees"

507
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:07,786
"Comfort and joy have I found
in the love of my life"

508
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:11,115
"I found my true friend.
Yes my true love"

509
00:46:20,366 --> 00:46:22,266
oh, what lovely music
you guys make!

510
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:25,665
You are on at the Chinatown.
Definitely!

511
00:46:49,395 --> 00:46:52,193
"Love's union
intoxicates the air"

512
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,592
"who wants to stay sober!"

513
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:03,166
"Love's union
intoxicates the air"

514
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:06,970
"who wants to stay sober!"

515
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,278
"After how long
a waiting..."

516
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,086
"...comes this season
of spring"

517
00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:17,255
"Restless desires
are tranquil today"

518
00:47:17,624 --> 00:47:20,889
"Becalmed today
are the love-crazed..."

519
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,821
"...love's passionate
devotees"

520
00:47:26,065 --> 00:47:29,523
"Comfort and joy have I found"

521
00:47:29,902 --> 00:47:33,303
"I found my true friend.
Yes my true love"

522
00:48:34,332 --> 00:48:38,200
Please! Softly!
You'll wake Mummy and Daddy

523
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,430
which fool is honking
his car now!

524
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,965
That's no car horn. It's
our Sunil

525
00:48:45,343 --> 00:48:49,541
what! Sunil?
At this time of the night!

526
00:48:50,147 --> 00:48:51,409
He's gone raving mad!

527
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:58,420
Please! Please...

528
00:49:39,296 --> 00:49:41,423
you love Anna very much,
don't you?

529
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:44,724
Tell me. Don't you?

530
00:49:47,038 --> 00:49:50,474
You know, Nikki... how
the two of them sang today

531
00:49:53,044 --> 00:49:54,978
How they danced together...

532
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:59,878
Touched each other...
held hands...

533
00:50:01,685 --> 00:50:03,812
How they looked into each
other's eyes...

534
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:09,383
How close she was to him...

535
00:50:10,861 --> 00:50:15,298
As for me, she didn't even
try to understand my feelings

536
00:50:17,334 --> 00:50:19,131
How shall I convince her...

537
00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:22,266
Not even a thousand
Chrises together...

538
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,201
...can give her the love I can!

539
00:50:28,212 --> 00:50:32,672
But Chris has a car,
a bungalow...

540
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:36,148
He has factories,
and money!

541
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,114
No! Anna isn't at all
like that

542
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:43,048
And yoU say these things?
When you love her so much!

543
00:50:43,427 --> 00:50:47,090
But she must love me too!
- She will, surely she will

544
00:50:47,465 --> 00:50:50,161
why won't she love you!
What do you lack, tell me?

545
00:50:50,534 --> 00:50:54,630
When you go to a party or a
picnic, you bring it alive

546
00:50:55,005 --> 00:50:58,771
People're happy to see you.
You cast magic over them

547
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:01,737
How long'll Anna be safe
from this magic?

548
00:51:02,213 --> 00:51:05,273
And so, I tell you...
Anna'll surely love you

549
00:51:06,117 --> 00:51:08,779
Really, Nikki?
- Yes, I swear. Come...

550
00:51:13,757 --> 00:51:16,225
why don't you take Anna
to the Carnival Ball?

551
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:17,754
She'll be so happy

552
00:51:18,562 --> 00:51:23,659
you're right. Chris has won
the first round, that's all

553
00:51:24,034 --> 00:51:25,433
It's my turn tomorrow

554
00:51:43,254 --> 00:51:44,949
well, Anna. I'm off

555
00:51:45,222 --> 00:51:47,690
Be there exactly by six.
I'll meet you there

556
00:51:52,897 --> 00:51:55,695
Not going to the office?
- I am. Good I met you

557
00:51:56,066 --> 00:51:57,761
Come. I've terrific news

558
00:51:58,035 --> 00:51:59,696
I can't come, yaar.
- Come on

559
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,766
No, I've to buy bread.
- Oh, do it later, yaar

560
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,665
But my bike's here.
- Pick it up later. Come on

561
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:10,377
you don't know, Sunil.
I'm the luckiest man alive

562
00:52:10,648 --> 00:52:12,548
why? What happened?

563
00:52:12,816 --> 00:52:15,614
My life's changed, friend.
I'm in love!

564
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,218
You're in love? That's
wonderful news!

565
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:22,386
Who's the lucky girl?

566
00:52:22,993 --> 00:52:24,927
I told you so often
and you ask again!

567
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:26,558
You've told me?
- Yes

568
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:29,957
oh yes, I remember now!
Wonderful!

569
00:52:32,303 --> 00:52:34,294
Sharon is really lucky

570
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:37,906
oh no! It's not Sharon

571
00:52:38,175 --> 00:52:39,199
Not Sharon?
- No

572
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:45,678
Tina... Lisa...
Padmini!

573
00:52:46,483 --> 00:52:48,951
The girls you think of!
None of them

574
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,148
ok, yaar

575
00:52:50,521 --> 00:52:52,352
you tell me. I give up

576
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:55,619
you're the limit! How many
times have I told you

577
00:52:56,227 --> 00:53:01,187
The girl is Anna!
What happened!?

578
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:04,868
Nothing, yaar...
So you love Anna

579
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:08,668
out of all girls, you found
only one! That too Anna!

580
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:11,200
Why? What's wrong with Anna?

581
00:53:11,575 --> 00:53:14,135
Wrong... oh, yaar, how can
I tell you

582
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:16,638
Let's just say she isn't
worthy of you

583
00:53:17,014 --> 00:53:19,505
Not worthy! What do you mean?

584
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:23,880
Chris, you're so smart,
intelligent... handsome!

585
00:53:24,154 --> 00:53:26,281
And Anna is so ugly to look at!

586
00:53:27,191 --> 00:53:29,352
Ugly! You haven't gone mad,
have you!

587
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:34,164
Sunil, all I know is I love
her with all my heart

588
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:35,896
I want her so much!

589
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:40,128
Ok. Agreed you love her
very much... want her

590
00:53:40,504 --> 00:53:45,601
But Chris... Does Anna
love you too?

591
00:53:50,247 --> 00:53:55,116
Yes, she... I don't fully
know, yaar

592
00:53:56,253 --> 00:53:58,949
So find out, Chris.
First find out fully

593
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:01,455
Bring two cream rolls

594
00:54:02,393 --> 00:54:06,454
It's essential to find out.
Or it may be one way traffic

595
00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:10,061
ok, I'll find out

596
00:54:10,768 --> 00:54:15,068
Anyway, I'm meeting Anna at 6.
At the Carnival Ball

597
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:17,471
what's the matter!

598
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:20,435
Did you say you're meeting Anna?

599
00:54:20,811 --> 00:54:22,711
That too at the Carnival Ball!

600
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,479
I've already asked her

601
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:27,214
And she... She agreed to go?

602
00:54:27,584 --> 00:54:29,950
Yes, Sunil. I've got
the tickets too. Look

603
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:33,454
what's the matter?
- Your cream rolls, sir

604
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:41,419
well, you're a gone case!
Nobody can save you

605
00:54:42,132 --> 00:54:43,929
what's the matter?

606
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:48,065
Listen, Chris. I don't want
to prejudice you

607
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:51,465
you love Anna so much, yaar

608
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:55,074
Come on, have a samosa, yaar

609
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:58,674
Later, yaar... Look, Sunil.
Come clean with me

610
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:05,850
All right. But promise me, Chris

611
00:55:06,123 --> 00:55:08,148
whatever I tell you
will remain between us. Ok?

612
00:55:08,425 --> 00:55:10,325
All right. But tell me,
will you

613
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:15,890
you're not the first boy
in her life

614
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,430
what!

615
00:55:17,801 --> 00:55:21,237
You don't know how many boys
she's fooled with...

616
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:22,867
She may not even remember

617
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,639
what're you saying, Sunil!

618
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:30,306
They must all be rumors!

619
00:55:31,014 --> 00:55:32,606
I say Anna isn't like that

620
00:55:32,983 --> 00:55:35,451
That's the problem with love!
Man becomes a fool

621
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:39,186
you're worse than a fool.
You're being willfully blind

622
00:55:39,456 --> 00:55:42,118
Like that guy... er like...
you know... Rahul

623
00:55:42,393 --> 00:55:43,758
Rahul? Which Rahul?

624
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:48,029
Y' know... tall thin guy with
specs... he went off to Canada

625
00:55:48,298 --> 00:55:50,129
Rahul Chowdhury?
- Yes, Rahul Chowdhury!

626
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:54,130
Anna used to string him
along and then... cut him off

627
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:03,605
He couldn't bear the shock
and went mad for Anna's love

628
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:09,382
what're you saying, Sunil!
Are you sure it was Anna?

629
00:56:09,753 --> 00:56:11,687
Of course. It was Anna

630
00:56:12,523 --> 00:56:14,548
No. Perhaps it was another girl?

631
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:17,290
So you mean I'm lying!

632
00:56:17,761 --> 00:56:19,023
It isn't a matter of lying

633
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,857
No, I'm making it up
to mislead you!

634
00:56:22,232 --> 00:56:23,392
No. I mean people talk all
sorts of things

635
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:25,801
To hell with 'em!

636
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:27,736
I'll tell you about ME

637
00:56:28,439 --> 00:56:30,566
I'm forced to, since
you don't want to believe

638
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:34,836
Anna played her game of
so-called love with me too

639
00:56:35,345 --> 00:56:37,472
with yoU too?
- Yes... Give it here

640
00:56:37,748 --> 00:56:39,113
It's for someone else.
- Give him another

641
00:56:40,818 --> 00:56:44,481
what're you saying!
She did this to you too!?

642
00:56:44,855 --> 00:56:50,589
That's why I keep away from her.
Here's my advice...

643
00:56:51,195 --> 00:56:53,129
keep away from her in
this love stuff

644
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:58,464
Don't forget your promise

645
00:56:59,403 --> 00:57:03,032
you're not to tell Anna
any of this... Come on

646
00:57:03,907 --> 00:57:06,375
Pay the bill and go to your office.
You must be late

647
00:57:09,046 --> 00:57:12,948
you saved me. Or I'd be ruined

648
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:16,881
I'll never meet her after
this day!

649
00:57:17,488 --> 00:57:19,183
Won't even see her face!

650
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,582
I'll hate her! Just hate her

651
00:57:24,728 --> 00:57:28,289
you don't know how much
I loved her!

652
00:57:29,566 --> 00:57:31,591
The way she looked at me
yesterday...

653
00:57:32,603 --> 00:57:34,298
what a look it was!

654
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:37,139
Her lovely big eyes...

655
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:41,503
The tenderness on her face...

656
00:57:42,112 --> 00:57:44,239
Her innocent smile...

657
00:57:44,848 --> 00:57:47,749
yes. I still love her, Sunil

658
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:51,687
I can't live without her!
- You can't?

659
00:57:52,055 --> 00:57:53,647
I wlLL meet her!
- Just a minute...

660
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:55,386
I'm going, Sunil

661
00:57:56,326 --> 00:57:59,227
what're you doing, Chris!
Think again

662
00:57:59,596 --> 00:58:01,291
Look, you're your parents'
only child

663
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:05,968
If anything happens to you,
they'll weep to death!

664
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:09,637
At least think of them if
not your self

665
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,270
This is my fate, Sunil.
Nobody can do a thing

666
00:58:12,643 --> 00:58:14,338
Everything is in Anna's
hands now

667
00:58:16,146 --> 00:58:18,410
Listen, Chris!

668
00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:24,753
Good I met you. I was coming home

669
00:58:26,056 --> 00:58:28,081
Let's go out this evening.
I so want to

670
00:58:28,492 --> 00:58:29,857
Not today

671
00:58:30,327 --> 00:58:33,558
Please. I'll take you to a
fun place. You'll enjoy it

672
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:36,958
No, Sunil. I've to meet
Chris this evening

673
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:37,928
we are...

674
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:40,965
Going to the Carnival.
Chris has tickets. I know

675
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:42,836
I was just joking

676
00:58:43,206 --> 00:58:46,334
Chris sent you a message.
- Message?

677
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:50,271
He'll be late because some
important work has turned up

678
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:52,581
He'll reach there at 7
instead of 6

679
01:00:12,462 --> 01:00:15,022
oh Sunil! How come you're here?

680
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:18,300
Chris insisted that I take you
to the Carnival Ball

681
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:21,136
But what happened?
Why isn't he here?

682
01:00:21,505 --> 01:00:24,838
Poor guy's badly stuck at work.
He couldn't get out

683
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,800
He begs you to forgive him

684
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:30,305
And sent these two tickets
for the Carnival

685
01:00:31,114 --> 01:00:34,914
I had waited all day for
this evening

686
01:00:35,285 --> 01:00:38,948
He could've told me
earlier. Or at least phoned

687
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:42,883
He wanted to come but got
stuck at the last minute

688
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,387
Stuck! What does he think he is!

689
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:49,232
If he sets the time, he must
reach there at all cost!

690
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,634
There's a limit to rudeness

691
01:00:52,436 --> 01:00:54,427
But why're you so angry
with me!?

692
01:00:55,706 --> 01:00:59,267
I was angry with Chris,
not you

693
01:00:59,843 --> 01:01:01,777
He's gone and ruined
the entire evening!

694
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,911
I can understand what
you're going thro'

695
01:01:05,282 --> 01:01:07,409
But please, don't feel so
depressed

696
01:01:07,784 --> 01:01:09,046
who's depressed!

697
01:01:09,553 --> 01:01:12,021
If he doesn't come,
the world doesn't end!

698
01:01:12,489 --> 01:01:16,482
Let's go up.
Come, let's enjoy ourselves

699
01:01:51,394 --> 01:01:59,460
"How I wish
I'd never wake up"

700
01:02:00,036 --> 01:02:08,273
"How I wish
I'd never wake up"

701
01:02:08,745 --> 01:02:17,210
"So I could sing for ever
love songs to you"

702
01:02:18,121 --> 01:02:26,085
"How I wish
I'd never wake up"

703
01:02:26,763 --> 01:02:34,795
"How I wish
I'd never wake up"

704
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:14,733
"your silken hair perfumes
this evening"

705
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:19,209
"These laughing lips
spill sparkling wine"

706
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:23,182
"your silken hair perfumes
this evening"

707
01:03:23,453 --> 01:03:27,787
"These laughing lips
spill sparkling wine"

708
01:03:28,091 --> 01:03:31,754
"Sway and dance
as you make music"

709
01:03:32,128 --> 01:03:40,399
"So I could sing for ever
love songs to you"

710
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:49,436
"How I wish
I'd never wake up"

711
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:58,378
"So I could sing for ever
love songs to you"

712
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:07,094
"How I wish
I'd never wake up"

713
01:04:47,537 --> 01:04:51,439
"If only you were mine,
my love"

714
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:56,245
"I would be treading
on stars"

715
01:04:56,379 --> 01:05:00,042
"If only you were mine,
my love"

716
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:04,615
"I would be treading
on stars"

717
01:05:05,088 --> 01:05:08,649
"The whole world
I'd forget"

718
01:05:09,259 --> 01:05:17,724
"So I could sing for ever
love songs to you"

719
01:05:18,201 --> 01:05:26,336
"How I wish
I'd never wake up"

720
01:05:26,943 --> 01:05:35,408
"So I could sing for ever
love songs to you"

721
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:44,290
"How I wish
I'd never wake up"

722
01:05:44,894 --> 01:05:53,268
"How I wish
I'd never wake up"

723
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:24,606
well, Mr. Romeo!
You're here I see

724
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:27,311
How come you're here, yaar?

725
01:06:27,782 --> 01:06:31,684
Exactly what I want to ask you!
What're you doing here?

726
01:06:31,953 --> 01:06:33,978
I... I... came to get myself
an ice-cream

727
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:36,251
For yourself?
- Yes

728
01:06:36,624 --> 01:06:38,888
But you're holding two
ice-creams, Sunil!

729
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,524
Perhaps the other one's
for me?

730
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:43,693
Yes... take it, yaar

731
01:06:44,632 --> 01:06:46,532
what of Anna then?

732
01:06:47,368 --> 01:06:49,734
She must be waiting for
an ice-cream too!

733
01:06:50,204 --> 01:06:53,435
Anna! Er... The fact is...

734
01:06:53,908 --> 01:07:00,108
It's good you know it, Chris.
Or you'd misunderstand me

735
01:07:00,481 --> 01:07:02,813
whatever I did was for your
own good

736
01:07:03,184 --> 01:07:06,278
Anna's very dangerous.
She'd have ruined you

737
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:08,121
But I won't let it happen

738
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:11,947
Finished? Or is there more?

739
01:07:12,326 --> 01:07:15,352
Whatever you said that day
was a rotten lie!

740
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:19,063
About Anna, about Rahul...
Even about you

741
01:07:19,433 --> 01:07:23,426
The truth is you love Anna.
Yes, you do

742
01:07:24,905 --> 01:07:26,600
you're jealous when you see
us together

743
01:07:27,008 --> 01:07:31,104
To the extent of cheating me
so you can've fun with Anna

744
01:07:31,345 --> 01:07:32,744
No, Chris! You're mistaken

745
01:07:33,114 --> 01:07:35,105
I've misunderstood you?
- Yes

746
01:07:35,716 --> 01:07:38,708
we'll know soon enough.
Come, let's go Anna

747
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:43,215
why do you drag Anna
into what concerns us?

748
01:07:43,457 --> 01:07:45,049
It's between us. Let's talk here

749
01:07:45,426 --> 01:07:46,916
Afraid to face Anna,
are you!

750
01:07:47,294 --> 01:07:50,627
Afraid? Why, I've done no harm

751
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:52,397
My heart's clear.
I told you what I heard

752
01:07:57,571 --> 01:07:59,732
See who I've brought!
Chris!

753
01:08:00,207 --> 01:08:02,334
What's the use coming now!
It's too late

754
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,972
It's not my fault, Anna.

755
01:08:04,378 --> 01:08:09,042
No!? You show up at 8
and say it's not your fault!

756
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:12,113
Never mind. We enjoyed
ourselves more without you

757
01:08:15,756 --> 01:08:19,886
Listen to me! I was waiting
here since 6 for you

758
01:08:20,127 --> 01:08:21,287
Since 6?
- Yes

759
01:08:21,695 --> 01:08:23,390
But Sunil told me to come at 7!

760
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:28,091
That's what I wanted to tell you.
Sunil changed it to 7

761
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:29,834
A lie!
- Your fault

762
01:08:30,004 --> 01:08:30,800
But why!?

763
01:08:31,205 --> 01:08:32,570
Ask him. He did it
deliberately

764
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,968
what's all this hassle?
- Tell us!

765
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,939
No hassle. I'll tell you

766
01:08:38,312 --> 01:08:42,146
Remember, you were leaving
the bakery this morning?

767
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:46,081
You ran into me there.
I was on my bike

768
01:08:46,487 --> 01:08:49,047
you insisted I go to
the restaurant with you?

769
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:50,051
Yes

770
01:08:50,424 --> 01:08:51,982
There you said you were
meeting Anna at 7

771
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:53,749
you're lying! I said 6

772
01:08:54,028 --> 01:08:57,259
you said 7. Try and remember.
- Have some shame!

773
01:08:57,631 --> 01:08:59,656
Lies and more lies!
How many lies, Sunil?

774
01:09:00,034 --> 01:09:04,266
Please, wait! I swear I told
him 6 o' clock, Anna!

775
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:10,007
Sunil, tell me the truth.
What's the matter?

776
01:09:10,377 --> 01:09:14,143
All right, Anna. Perhaps I
heard it wrong as 7, not 6

777
01:09:14,715 --> 01:09:16,205
But if the time w AS 6...

778
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,015
Ask him why he gave me
the message for you...

779
01:09:21,188 --> 01:09:22,212
...to meet him at 7?

780
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:23,752
What message?

781
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:25,615
You forgot the message
in this 6 & 7 muddle!

782
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:28,122
A lie! I sent no message

783
01:09:28,395 --> 01:09:31,626
But why'd I lie, Anna?
If I did, why'd I make it 7?

784
01:09:31,999 --> 01:09:34,467
I could've said 9 or 10!
Or even Monday or Tuesday

785
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:36,769
I could even say Chris
wasn't coming at all

786
01:09:37,138 --> 01:09:41,268
Can't tell who's lying...
- I'm telling the truth!

787
01:09:41,642 --> 01:09:43,872
Sunil, if you lie, I'II...
- Stop it now!

788
01:09:44,245 --> 01:09:49,979
You cut him off ruthlessly

789
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:03,957
you promised you wouldn't say anything

790
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:04,959
I don't remember anything

791
01:10:06,967 --> 01:10:08,127
you should hear what else he said about you Anna.

792
01:10:08,836 --> 01:10:10,770
He said that you play games of love with guys

793
01:10:11,138 --> 01:10:15,575
And that you make false promises with them
and that your the biggest flirt.

794
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:22,981
What? You said that I'm a flirt?

795
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:27,687
Yes Anna and he said that you like playing with
guy's feelings.

796
01:10:27,955 --> 01:10:34,656
He said that you lead guys on and then when
they get serious you let them loose.

797
01:10:35,362 --> 01:10:37,421
You said all this about me?

798
01:10:37,798 --> 01:10:40,562
Yes! He also said it was you
who ruined Rahul Chowdhury

799
01:10:40,968 --> 01:10:43,630
He took to drugs and went
mad because of you...

800
01:10:43,904 --> 01:10:45,735
And went to Canada for treatment

801
01:10:47,074 --> 01:10:49,008
And what I'll tell you next
will stun you!

802
01:10:49,944 --> 01:10:53,038
He told me you led him on too!

803
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:54,542
And tried to trap him!

804
01:11:00,654 --> 01:11:03,020
Am I like that, Sunil?
- No! Absolutely not!

805
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:07,019
Perhaps... I was wrong. But
this isn't what I meant...

806
01:11:08,362 --> 01:11:12,594
I respect you so much...
I love you so much...

807
01:11:35,619 --> 01:11:38,952
Please speak to me... Let
me tell you why I did it

808
01:11:44,794 --> 01:11:47,695
Don't touch me! Don't ever
come before me!

809
01:11:48,064 --> 01:11:50,999
Don't talk to me. I don't
ever want to see your face!

810
01:11:52,569 --> 01:11:55,561
Anna! At least have this
ice-cream... Please

811
01:12:00,977 --> 01:12:02,638
what have you done, Sunil!

812
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:07,414
Dug your own grave! How'll
you get out of this mess...

813
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,612
But you've to get out

814
01:12:10,186 --> 01:12:12,120
you've only one goal... Anna

815
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:40,839
Sunil! You!

816
01:13:41,611 --> 01:13:43,841
I must tell you something.
It's very important

817
01:13:44,214 --> 01:13:45,181
I want to tell you that...

818
01:13:45,548 --> 01:13:47,482
How dare you come here!

819
01:13:47,951 --> 01:13:51,284
Anna, listen to me for
a minute

820
01:14:27,257 --> 01:14:30,249
what's the matter, Sunil?
- I must talk to you, Father

821
01:14:30,627 --> 01:14:32,891
I haven't the time to talk now

822
01:14:33,263 --> 01:14:36,061
But it's very important!
Just 5 minutes

823
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:39,130
No, Sunil. Later.
Not now

824
01:14:39,702 --> 01:14:41,431
I'm in such trouble

825
01:14:43,339 --> 01:14:46,433
you're always in trouble.
What's it now?

826
01:14:55,418 --> 01:14:57,909
You said such things about Anna?

827
01:14:58,922 --> 01:15:00,753
And you claim you said it
out of love!

828
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:03,383
What kind of love is this, Sunil!

829
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,622
You call a poor innocent girl
a flirt!

830
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:09,125
A girl who lays snares...

831
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:11,428
Strings boys along and
then cuts them off!

832
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:16,762
But I didn't REALLy say it!
I didn't mean it

833
01:15:17,173 --> 01:15:19,403
How could you? Even yoU
must've some limits

834
01:15:20,777 --> 01:15:24,406
Drove Rahul Chowdhry mad...
Sent him off to Canada!

835
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:26,806
But he did go to Canada

836
01:15:27,183 --> 01:15:29,014
But he didn't go mad before
going there!

837
01:15:30,253 --> 01:15:32,619
I'd have slapped you
if I were Anna!

838
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:34,247
She did slap me

839
01:15:35,391 --> 01:15:38,417
She slapped you, did she!
Good!

840
01:15:41,197 --> 01:15:43,563
You must go and ask her
forgiveness

841
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:47,494
I did go... thro' the window
after climbing the balcony

842
01:15:48,304 --> 01:15:52,070
The window! Oh, Sunil! Why
do you always use windows!?

843
01:15:52,442 --> 01:15:54,774
Why not try using the door first?

844
01:16:00,183 --> 01:16:02,447
I love Anna so much, Father

845
01:16:03,353 --> 01:16:05,787
The more I try and get close
to her...

846
01:16:06,155 --> 01:16:07,850
...the farther she is!

847
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:13,892
She's so angry that I don't
know how to placate her now

848
01:16:14,597 --> 01:16:16,394
what can I do to make her
forgive me

849
01:16:18,201 --> 01:16:23,400
Father, you must show me
a way out... Please...

850
01:16:27,176 --> 01:16:32,546
you must have something in
you that can win Anna's heart

851
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:34,941
But I have nothing, Father!

852
01:16:35,218 --> 01:16:37,345
There must be something.
Think, Sunil

853
01:16:46,162 --> 01:16:50,690
yes, you've music!
You play so well

854
01:16:51,067 --> 01:16:54,195
God has given you such a
great gift. Use it

855
01:16:57,307 --> 01:16:58,706
we're to perform at
the Chinatown Club

856
01:16:59,075 --> 01:17:01,270
I'll write such a song...
all will be happy

857
01:17:38,314 --> 01:17:45,152
He's taking extra pictures
of our group

858
01:17:45,421 --> 01:17:50,415
Come up quick. Must take
your pictures

859
01:17:50,593 --> 01:17:51,491
Against the band's name

860
01:17:53,196 --> 01:17:56,324
Forget it, Imran. Don't be
so hard-hearted

861
01:17:56,566 --> 01:17:58,932
Poor Sunil will feel so sad.
- Let him

862
01:17:59,302 --> 01:18:02,100
This poor guy of yours has
made Anna cry so much

863
01:18:02,472 --> 01:18:03,734
Remember that

864
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,768
once we've decided to
throw Sunil out of the band...

865
01:18:07,143 --> 01:18:09,134
...it's final

866
01:18:10,613 --> 01:18:14,606
Please relent, Anna.
What's done is done

867
01:18:14,984 --> 01:18:15,916
Forget it and call Sunil back

868
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:17,345
All right, call him

869
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:20,514
But I'll leave if he comes

870
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:23,825
Take the photos

871
01:18:25,395 --> 01:18:29,161
one minute, Anna... Come and
stand beside Chris... yes

872
01:18:31,934 --> 01:18:33,424
Now click our star pair
together

873
01:18:46,349 --> 01:18:50,149
ok, brothers, I'm off.
Practice hard, will you

874
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,215
Take Chinatown by storm tonight!

875
01:19:27,724 --> 01:19:31,091
Some people are so dense
that they can't take hints

876
01:19:31,294 --> 01:19:34,593
Hints! It's all written out
there. Can't read or what!

877
01:19:34,964 --> 01:19:39,401
There's no lack of shameless
people. We must ignore them

878
01:19:39,769 --> 01:19:40,929
And concentrate on our work

879
01:19:46,876 --> 01:19:50,312
May I sit here? I heard that
your music is very good

880
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,942
Thank you very much, sir

881
01:19:52,548 --> 01:20:00,455
But not here. Over there...
But you will keep quiet

882
01:20:01,157 --> 01:20:04,615
Don't even think of sneaking
into the band again

883
01:20:05,328 --> 01:20:07,694
I'm singing your lines now,
understand?

884
01:20:09,799 --> 01:20:12,734
I understand. Very well too.
- Good... Let's start

885
01:20:21,077 --> 01:20:22,977
Just a minute!
- I told you to keep quiet!

886
01:20:28,584 --> 01:20:31,815
I just wanted to say this
song won't do for Chinatown

887
01:20:32,188 --> 01:20:35,885
It'll be a total flop, actually

888
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:38,486
A flop, you say!

889
01:20:38,995 --> 01:20:41,793
Heard that? When it was such
a hit at Richie's wedding!

890
01:20:42,165 --> 01:20:43,325
They were crazy about it!

891
01:20:43,699 --> 01:20:46,259
What's more, Chris and Anna
made a super hit pair

892
01:20:46,536 --> 01:20:47,696
People loved them

893
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:51,164
I know folks loved it and
the song was a super hit

894
01:20:51,674 --> 01:20:54,575
But that was a suit'n tie crowd

895
01:20:55,077 --> 01:20:59,571
And Chinatown is an entirely
different world

896
01:21:00,716 --> 01:21:02,547
you sing a suit'n tie song
to that crowd...

897
01:21:02,919 --> 01:21:04,284
And what'll happen?
Thought of it?

898
01:21:09,559 --> 01:21:13,427
What he says is true

899
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:15,525
Dad hasn't insured my life,
you know!

900
01:21:15,898 --> 01:21:19,800
Well, if this won't do,
which other song will?

901
01:21:20,269 --> 01:21:25,229
I'll tell you. The song
must somehow reflect...

902
01:21:25,641 --> 01:21:26,573
...the life of those
who come to Chinatown

903
01:21:26,943 --> 01:21:28,706
It must say something
about their situation...

904
01:21:29,412 --> 01:21:31,437
...which they can recognize

905
01:21:32,048 --> 01:21:33,208
Something they can identify with...

906
01:21:39,922 --> 01:21:44,586
Rubbish! I don't agree

907
01:21:44,961 --> 01:21:47,657
And anyway, who'll write
such a song?

908
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:49,292
Yes! Who'll write it?

909
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:53,866
I wrote such a song

910
01:21:54,704 --> 01:21:58,367
wonderful! You've already
written it! You're a genius

911
01:21:59,075 --> 01:22:02,135
It's a trick. First, take
the song then the singer

912
01:22:02,511 --> 01:22:04,775
we don't want it.
- Absolutely!

913
01:22:10,019 --> 01:22:12,715
Why're you wasting time?
- They're outdated songs

914
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,988
Please listen to the song!

915
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,828
Why listen to a song
that we don't want!

916
01:22:20,329 --> 01:22:21,796
This isn't a trick, Anna

917
01:22:22,164 --> 01:22:25,964
keep me out of the band
but at least take my song!

918
01:22:26,235 --> 01:22:28,465
We said we don't want to
hear it!

919
01:22:28,738 --> 01:22:32,196
Ok, don't hear the song.
At least read it once!

920
01:23:00,636 --> 01:23:04,436
Now you understand?
- Ok...

921
01:23:04,807 --> 01:23:06,138
To hell with you all!

922
01:23:06,509 --> 01:23:07,874
Go sing your rotten old song!

923
01:23:10,179 --> 01:23:12,443
Don't come to me when they
throw their shoes at you!

924
01:23:25,828 --> 01:23:28,296
Sorry for what happened, yaar

925
01:23:28,664 --> 01:23:30,393
I'll leave the band if you wish

926
01:23:30,766 --> 01:23:32,893
If you're out, I'm out too.
- No need for that

927
01:23:33,269 --> 01:23:35,533
Don't you worry. I'll take
care of them

928
01:23:35,905 --> 01:23:39,671
An idea... we're going to the
Carnival after the rehearsal

929
01:23:40,042 --> 01:23:41,737
Try and persuade Anna there

930
01:23:42,111 --> 01:23:45,444
once Anna agrees, everybody
else will... All right?

931
01:24:02,231 --> 01:24:06,930
"Anna, don't think my love
is false, o my darling"

932
01:24:07,236 --> 01:24:11,673
"Anna, don't think my love
is false, o my darling"

933
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:16,444
"To win you, my love,
was this whole charade"

934
01:24:16,946 --> 01:24:21,508
"Anna, don't think my love
is false, o my darling"

935
01:24:22,084 --> 01:24:26,316
"To win you, my love,
was this whole charade"

936
01:24:26,789 --> 01:24:31,317
"what's done is done.
Won't you let it go at that"

937
01:24:31,594 --> 01:24:36,588
"what's done is done.
Won't you let it go at that"

938
01:25:01,857 --> 01:25:05,918
"Look at my fate!
An arrow's struck in my heart"

939
01:25:06,429 --> 01:25:11,731
"whose image is it
that haunts me, o my love"

940
01:25:11,934 --> 01:25:16,098
"Let go my hand!
I well know your kind"

941
01:25:16,605 --> 01:25:21,474
"Every word a lie
and every promise false!"

942
01:25:21,911 --> 01:25:26,245
"Whether I'm true or false
this whole world knows"

943
01:25:26,715 --> 01:25:31,379
"Anna, don't think my love
is false, o my darling"

944
01:25:31,987 --> 01:25:36,617
"To win you, my love,
was this whole charade"

945
01:25:36,926 --> 01:25:41,124
"what's done is done.
Won't you let it go at that"

946
01:25:41,597 --> 01:25:46,364
"what's done is done.
Won't you let it go at that"

947
01:26:36,952 --> 01:26:41,048
"The snare you set
caught you instead"

948
01:26:41,457 --> 01:26:46,520
"So Mister Trouble,
get back the way you came"

949
01:26:47,129 --> 01:26:51,122
"Don't, o my friend,
kick my bruised heart so!"

950
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:56,463
"For God's sake know
that I love you so!"

951
01:26:57,072 --> 01:27:01,065
"Now that I know
don't dare talk anymore"

952
01:27:01,677 --> 01:27:06,376
"Anna, don't think my love
is false, o my darling"

953
01:27:06,682 --> 01:27:11,346
"Anna, don't think my love
is false, o my darling"

954
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:16,382
"To win you, my love,
was this whole charade"

955
01:27:16,959 --> 01:27:20,952
"what's done is done.
Won't you let it go at that"

956
01:27:21,664 --> 01:27:26,431
"what's done is done.
Won't you let it go at that"

957
01:28:01,624 --> 01:28:03,649
Anna, listen to what I've
to say

958
01:28:05,261 --> 01:28:11,461
Go then, Anna. But give me
back my trumpet!

959
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:21,203
Brothers, today I present
a brand new band before you

960
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:27,115
It's a band that's the best.
Lively, strong... And a hit!

961
01:28:27,584 --> 01:28:28,744
Hey Patel, stop yakking

962
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:31,383
Bring on the musicians and
let's test their playing!

963
01:28:51,975 --> 01:28:56,173
Yes. Our palms are
beginning to itch!

964
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:05,986
Please, Brothers!
Don't throw glasses!

965
01:29:06,890 --> 01:29:09,154
Don't throw the glasses now.
We'll do it later

966
01:29:09,526 --> 01:29:10,788
yes!

967
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:15,564
Bullets'll hit this band!
Our Big Boss's coming today

968
01:29:15,932 --> 01:29:17,524
who? Anthony?
- Yes!

969
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:23,230
Who's this Anthony?
- The top Don of this town

970
01:29:47,230 --> 01:29:49,755
why've you all gone so quiet,
you bastards?

971
01:29:50,033 --> 01:29:51,193
Keep the party going

972
01:29:57,707 --> 01:30:00,267
And ya punks, keep
the song 'n dance going!

973
01:30:03,713 --> 01:30:04,737
Come on, start

974
01:30:09,619 --> 01:30:12,747
"why not we delight
in our love"

975
01:30:13,122 --> 01:30:16,455
"why not we hold
each other in our arms"

976
01:30:16,826 --> 01:30:19,954
"I found my true friend.
Yes my true friend"

977
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:23,857
"I found my true love.
Yes my true love"

978
01:30:25,335 --> 01:30:28,566
you dumb jackasses! What
sort of song is this!

979
01:30:32,675 --> 01:30:34,233
This song's so sappy!

980
01:31:05,775 --> 01:31:10,940
Listen, brothers! This
isn't a police siren! No

981
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:12,909
I played it. Listen, like this

982
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:23,817
Thank you, Sahib! Listen,
please sit down

983
01:31:24,227 --> 01:31:25,819
Please calm down...
There, at the back too

984
01:31:26,195 --> 01:31:28,993
Give us a chance for a
brand new, brilliant song

985
01:31:29,966 --> 01:31:32,127
Boss, this's the same guy
who hit your car!

986
01:31:33,036 --> 01:31:35,061
What? This worm?
- Yes

987
01:31:35,438 --> 01:31:36,598
Mark him down

988
01:31:36,973 --> 01:31:39,339
we'll finish him off
after the show

989
01:31:39,709 --> 01:31:45,773
The bastard sounds a siren!
He'll sing, will he!

990
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:49,282
Hits my car! The bloody worm!

991
01:32:32,462 --> 01:32:36,990
Friends, what you're about
to hear...

992
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:39,359
...isn't just a song.
It's also a story

993
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:46,067
yes a true story about a Don.

994
01:32:54,717 --> 01:32:58,084
"This is a true story.
- Listen, o my love"

995
01:32:58,654 --> 01:33:01,782
"In this city there lived...
A youngman"

996
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:05,821
"Straight and simple was he.
- A most lovable man"

997
01:33:06,195 --> 01:33:11,963
"How can I describe
how he turned into a Don"

998
01:33:19,342 --> 01:33:22,573
"This is a true story.
- Listen, o my love"

999
01:33:22,945 --> 01:33:26,278
"In this city there lived...
A youngman"

1000
01:33:26,549 --> 01:33:30,110
"Straight and simple was he.
- A most lovable man"

1001
01:33:30,386 --> 01:33:36,791
"How can I describe
how he turned into a Don"

1002
01:34:18,134 --> 01:34:21,297
"where all did he not go
just in search of a job!"

1003
01:34:21,604 --> 01:34:25,165
"Thrown out was he
wherever he went"

1004
01:34:29,212 --> 01:34:32,545
"where all did he not go
just in search of a job!"

1005
01:34:32,915 --> 01:34:36,715
"Thrown out was he
wherever he went"

1006
01:34:37,086 --> 01:34:40,214
"But he was young.
So purposefully young"

1007
01:34:40,423 --> 01:34:44,359
"Finally he left
the world of decent folk"

1008
01:34:45,328 --> 01:34:47,796
"But he was young.
So purposefully young"

1009
01:34:48,164 --> 01:34:51,793
"Finally he left
the world of decent folk"

1010
01:34:56,973 --> 01:35:00,966
"From the day he turned a Don
folks began to fear"

1011
01:35:01,677 --> 01:35:05,636
"He turned into a terror
is all that I can say"

1012
01:35:06,482 --> 01:35:09,042
"The whole world was
at his feet"

1013
01:35:10,953 --> 01:35:14,616
"In a way, he got
all he wanted"

1014
01:35:15,024 --> 01:35:18,460
"But the garden of his heart
did not bloom"

1015
01:35:18,694 --> 01:35:21,857
"His heart's happiness
he'd have found"

1016
01:35:22,231 --> 01:35:27,294
"If only someone
had loved him"

1017
01:35:35,378 --> 01:35:38,905
"This is a true story.
Listen, o my love"

1018
01:35:39,182 --> 01:35:42,879
"In this city lived
a young man"

1019
01:35:43,186 --> 01:35:46,417
"Straight and simple was he.
A lovable man"

1020
01:35:46,822 --> 01:35:53,284
"How can I describe how he turned
into a Don"

1021
01:36:49,685 --> 01:36:52,711
"How can I describe
the rest of his story"

1022
01:36:53,089 --> 01:36:56,650
"His days of youth
were burnt barren"

1023
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:04,063
"How can I describe
the rest of his story"

1024
01:37:04,433 --> 01:37:08,199
"His days of youth
were burnt barren"

1025
01:37:08,571 --> 01:37:11,563
"His very own
denied him love"

1026
01:37:11,941 --> 01:37:15,843
"The season of love
was never to be his"

1027
01:37:16,012 --> 01:37:19,243
"His very own
denied him love"

1028
01:37:19,515 --> 01:37:23,178
"The season of love
was never to be his"

1029
01:37:23,686 --> 01:37:25,586
"whenever he came
amongst people"

1030
01:37:26,956 --> 01:37:30,722
"whenever he smiled
and laughed"

1031
01:37:31,227 --> 01:37:34,458
"Those who saw him felt"

1032
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:41,294
"The tears
behind the smiles"

1033
01:37:48,144 --> 01:37:51,443
"This is his story
- Listen, o my love"

1034
01:37:51,681 --> 01:37:55,139
"Somewhere in this city...
- Lived a youngman"

1035
01:37:55,384 --> 01:37:59,081
"He was simple and straight.
A lovable man"

1036
01:37:59,288 --> 01:38:05,625
"I don't know how to tell you
how he became a Don"

1037
01:38:07,763 --> 01:38:08,787
"Don! Don!"

1038
01:38:45,559 --> 01:38:49,791
Great! What a tragedy
song it was!

1039
01:38:50,163 --> 01:38:51,221
What music!

1040
01:38:51,598 --> 01:38:55,500
I wanna to meet everyone in
this band and embrace them!

1041
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:04,377
Meet Sunil. He wrote
the song, composed the tune

1042
01:39:04,744 --> 01:39:05,574
He did everything in fact

1043
01:39:05,812 --> 01:39:08,508
wonderful, Sunil!
It was really something

1044
01:39:08,882 --> 01:39:12,443
The story in your song
was my story...

1045
01:39:12,819 --> 01:39:14,081
The story of every Anthony!

1046
01:39:14,487 --> 01:39:17,251
Your song's Don isn't a Don.
He's this Anthony Gomes!

1047
01:39:17,657 --> 01:39:19,318
Man, I've become your fan!

1048
01:39:21,761 --> 01:39:25,561
Look, you need anything in
life, call Anthony Gomes

1049
01:39:25,932 --> 01:39:27,092
I'll do anything for you!

1050
01:39:28,235 --> 01:39:29,167
Well, gotta be on my way

1051
01:39:32,372 --> 01:39:33,964
Just a minute. Patel, come here

1052
01:39:34,774 --> 01:39:37,140
Give it to the kids from me...
To buy some sweets

1053
01:40:11,778 --> 01:40:14,042
I knew that once I was
thrown out of the band...

1054
01:40:14,948 --> 01:40:16,540
I shouldn't have come here

1055
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:20,148
I shouldn't have even
stepped on the stage

1056
01:40:22,055 --> 01:40:23,784
But I couldn't stop myself

1057
01:40:32,866 --> 01:40:35,994
Hey, Sunil! Where're you going!?

1058
01:40:36,503 --> 01:40:38,198
It was because of you
we were saved

1059
01:40:38,672 --> 01:40:40,936
The band's a hit because of you

1060
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:47,146
But Chris, what I did to you
that day...

1061
01:40:47,747 --> 01:40:51,478
Forget that day. Today,
there's only you... only you

1062
01:40:53,186 --> 01:40:55,654
we couldn't even imagine
that the song'd be so good

1063
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:58,052
who had torn up the song?

1064
01:41:40,033 --> 01:41:43,161
You seem very happy today.
- I am very happy

1065
01:41:43,536 --> 01:41:45,231
I too am very happy today.
- Have some cake?

1066
01:41:45,972 --> 01:41:50,602
Where's Anna, uncle?
- Anna didn't come here.

1067
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:54,444
But she asked me to meet her here!
We're going out

1068
01:41:55,048 --> 01:41:56,310
well, I don't know about that

1069
01:41:57,117 --> 01:42:00,348
oh yes! Chris came and took
Anna out.

1070
01:42:01,054 --> 01:42:01,884
But how can it be! I...

1071
01:42:03,022 --> 01:42:05,490
Forget Anna, Sunil.
And you had better know...

1072
01:42:06,292 --> 01:42:10,058
But Dad, we must clearly tell
him what happened. Look...

1073
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:14,764
Chris and Anna are in love.
He has invited her home...

1074
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:18,036
...for us to talk to his
parents about their marriage.

1075
01:42:18,505 --> 01:42:20,439
They'll be married soon

1076
01:43:38,418 --> 01:43:45,256
vasco, some guy around here
is very very sad... yes man

1077
01:43:51,130 --> 01:43:55,226
Don't note it down!
Feel it?

1078
01:44:09,849 --> 01:44:14,616
Vasco, my heart's crying, man!

1079
01:44:14,988 --> 01:44:18,981
Take me to him...
yes, take me there

1080
01:44:30,136 --> 01:44:35,233
oh God, vasco!
It's my buddy, man!

1081
01:44:40,446 --> 01:44:43,244
What's happened to
my friend? Tell me!

1082
01:44:43,616 --> 01:44:47,484
He's very sad, Mr. Anthony.
He is a loser in love!

1083
01:44:49,188 --> 01:44:51,918
You mean...
his heart is broken!

1084
01:44:52,825 --> 01:44:54,087
Yes

1085
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:56,928
That's why such music is
bursting out of his heart!

1086
01:45:04,537 --> 01:45:06,437
The same thing happened to me!

1087
01:45:08,675 --> 01:45:11,269
But now, I'll talk to him

1088
01:45:11,644 --> 01:45:12,906
yes. I'll talk to my friend.

1089
01:45:22,021 --> 01:45:24,922
Don't worry, my friend.
I have come

1090
01:45:25,558 --> 01:45:27,526
your Anthony has come

1091
01:45:28,027 --> 01:45:29,722
I'll fix up everything

1092
01:45:29,996 --> 01:45:32,021
That guy yezdi told me everything

1093
01:45:32,732 --> 01:45:35,860
you're my buddy, man.
Get up.

1094
01:45:36,569 --> 01:45:38,161
I'll make it all right.
Come on...

1095
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:41,097
you want Anna, right?
You will have her

1096
01:45:41,474 --> 01:45:42,964
what's there to cry?

1097
01:45:43,576 --> 01:45:47,478
Look!
First, I'll bump off Chris

1098
01:45:47,847 --> 01:45:50,816
That leaves her parents.
I'll bump em off too

1099
01:45:51,284 --> 01:45:53,650
Then the girl's yours!
Marry her

1100
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:57,581
Go on a honeymoon...
Hey you, book a hotel in ooty

1101
01:45:58,091 --> 01:46:01,060
Just a minute, Mr. Anthony.
Have you gone mad!?

1102
01:46:01,427 --> 01:46:02,587
You're talking of killing
people!

1103
01:46:03,296 --> 01:46:06,424
You don't want 'em killed?
Ok, no killing then

1104
01:46:07,233 --> 01:46:10,566
only break their bones
- No! Mr. Anthony, No!

1105
01:46:11,704 --> 01:46:13,194
What's this, yaar even
break their bones?

1106
01:46:14,107 --> 01:46:17,565
Ok. I've found a simple and
straight way

1107
01:46:18,177 --> 01:46:21,738
Listen! Don't you say no to
me now... vasco, take the car

1108
01:46:22,215 --> 01:46:24,581
kidnap Anna.
Now, this very minute!

1109
01:46:24,951 --> 01:46:27,647
One moment! Who do you
think you are!?

1110
01:46:28,788 --> 01:46:30,915
You may be a big Don
or whatever!

1111
01:46:31,391 --> 01:46:34,827
But listen to what I've to
say. I love Anna very much

1112
01:46:35,294 --> 01:46:37,990
But it's my own affair and
I'll deal with it myself

1113
01:46:38,798 --> 01:46:40,732
But you dare meddle...

1114
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:43,227
I'll break your legs
and hand vasco the bones!

1115
01:46:50,677 --> 01:46:54,010
Speak to my friend with
politeness, you understand!

1116
01:46:55,815 --> 01:47:01,549
Sunil my brother!
My friend! Listen to me

1117
01:47:01,954 --> 01:47:03,979
on behalf of this
damn brute

1118
01:47:04,457 --> 01:47:05,947
...I beg your forgiveness
with folded hands!

1119
01:47:06,325 --> 01:47:09,954
My friend, you are a true lover!
Yes, a true lover!

1120
01:47:16,035 --> 01:47:22,565
When you are sad
I am DoUBLE sad!

1121
01:47:23,476 --> 01:47:25,410
And... I can't bear to see
you sad, man!

1122
01:47:27,847 --> 01:47:30,315
If you sit here this way
you'll lose her

1123
01:47:31,017 --> 01:47:32,609
Go to her...

1124
01:47:32,985 --> 01:47:35,010
Tear out your heart and
show her what's inside!

1125
01:47:35,421 --> 01:47:36,888
When she sees how much
you love her...

1126
01:47:37,256 --> 01:47:41,659
She top will love you
as much!

1127
01:47:46,099 --> 01:47:48,863
Are you ready?
It's time to go

1128
01:47:49,268 --> 01:47:51,498
yes, dear. Just 5 minutes.

1129
01:47:58,845 --> 01:48:01,336
Look Simon! We're going to
Chris' house

1130
01:48:01,714 --> 01:48:02,738
Take care what you eat!

1131
01:48:04,884 --> 01:48:06,283
So I don't have to scold
you in public!

1132
01:48:09,589 --> 01:48:13,787
What's wrong? Are you ok?
- I'm perfectly all right

1133
01:48:15,895 --> 01:48:17,726
Just feeling a bit nervous

1134
01:48:18,531 --> 01:48:21,523
when I think of his parents,
I'm a bit scared

1135
01:48:23,236 --> 01:48:26,694
I'm scared too, Simon...
They're such big people

1136
01:48:27,073 --> 01:48:29,405
From where to where has
Charles gone in a few years!

1137
01:48:29,776 --> 01:48:31,607
Such a big name in society!

1138
01:48:32,211 --> 01:48:36,511
I was a baker then and
I am a baker even now

1139
01:48:37,016 --> 01:48:39,246
Nobody bothers about these
things today

1140
01:48:39,652 --> 01:48:42,212
only the boy and girl must
like each other

1141
01:49:18,724 --> 01:49:21,488
Such a big party, Chris!
Anything special?

1142
01:49:21,961 --> 01:49:24,953
Yes, Aunty. It's my parents'
anniversary

1143
01:49:25,998 --> 01:49:27,260
you should've told us, Chris!

1144
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,437
We'd have brought a present.
I'd have baked a cake

1145
01:49:33,472 --> 01:49:35,269
Simon, we must go and
wish them. Come on.

1146
01:49:40,246 --> 01:49:41,941
Let's go over there, Anna.
- Why?

1147
01:49:42,315 --> 01:49:44,010
'Cos I'm going to Bangalore tomorrow

1148
01:49:44,417 --> 01:49:46,681
And I want to spend all
my time with you

1149
01:49:47,053 --> 01:49:49,954
And I don't want to be disturbed!

1150
01:49:50,223 --> 01:49:52,521
You're going to Bangalore?
For how long?

1151
01:49:53,025 --> 01:49:55,220
Not long. I'll be back soon

1152
01:49:55,828 --> 01:50:00,265
Look Charles, I want to talk
about something important

1153
01:50:00,499 --> 01:50:01,363
So tell me

1154
01:50:01,934 --> 01:50:04,198
I want... that...

1155
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:09,439
Charles! Mr. D' Cunha wants you

1156
01:50:14,747 --> 01:50:18,080
you know the D'Cunhas?
- Yes, we do

1157
01:50:18,451 --> 01:50:21,386
Albert works in their hotel.
- They're very rich

1158
01:50:21,621 --> 01:50:24,749
And very nice too. Have you
met their daughter Sharon?

1159
01:50:25,124 --> 01:50:27,456
Yes. Charles introduced us

1160
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:31,293
She's so sweet!
I like her so much

1161
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:33,259
The D'Cunhas want Chris
and Sharon to marry

1162
01:50:33,532 --> 01:50:35,762
we too think it'll be very good

1163
01:50:37,703 --> 01:50:39,500
That's what they're deciding now

1164
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:43,200
Chris is going to Bangalore.
As soon as he comes back...

1165
01:50:45,244 --> 01:50:47,712
I think... perhaps they want me

1166
01:50:52,718 --> 01:50:54,117
we thought one thing...

1167
01:50:54,587 --> 01:50:56,953
And the situation is
entirely different!

1168
01:50:57,456 --> 01:51:03,827
Simon! What's the matter?
- Nothing...

1169
01:51:04,964 --> 01:51:07,626
I'm feeling giddy...
- Sit down

1170
01:51:15,508 --> 01:51:17,339
Anna, Albert! Come on

1171
01:51:21,314 --> 01:51:23,339
we're going home.
Now, this very minute!

1172
01:51:29,322 --> 01:51:30,254
What's the matter, Anna?

1173
01:51:30,523 --> 01:51:31,353
We're going, Chris

1174
01:51:31,757 --> 01:51:34,624
So early?
The party has just begun!

1175
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:39,092
What's wrong?
Why're you all leaving?

1176
01:51:39,398 --> 01:51:41,525
Nothing.
Mom wants to go home

1177
01:51:41,901 --> 01:51:43,926
No, something's wrong.
You look very disturbed

1178
01:51:44,737 --> 01:51:47,297
Don't pretend that you know nothing!

1179
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:48,632
What's it, Anna?

1180
01:51:49,775 --> 01:51:52,573
Tell me the truth! I don't
understand anything

1181
01:51:53,379 --> 01:51:55,847
I'm talking of the marriage
that's being decided...

1182
01:51:56,115 --> 01:51:58,379
...between you and Sharon!
- What!?

1183
01:51:59,852 --> 01:52:01,114
She's beautiful...
Talented...

1184
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:03,845
what more do you want?

1185
01:52:04,757 --> 01:52:08,716
Believe me, Anna!
Sharon means nothing to me

1186
01:52:09,095 --> 01:52:10,585
you are everything to me Anna!

1187
01:52:18,604 --> 01:52:21,198
Hurry up, Anna.
It's getting late

1188
01:52:22,341 --> 01:52:25,777
Just see what Anna thinks Aunty!
What's wrong with her?

1189
01:52:29,982 --> 01:52:33,213
Look, Chris.
Try and understand

1190
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:37,052
we're very simple and
ordinary people

1191
01:52:37,456 --> 01:52:39,890
your family's very rich...

1192
01:52:40,359 --> 01:52:43,487
...where money and name
mean everything

1193
01:52:43,863 --> 01:52:46,764
Naturally, your parents want
you to marry...

1194
01:52:47,266 --> 01:52:50,064
...into the same society

1195
01:52:50,503 --> 01:52:53,734
No, Aunty! I don't believe
in such things at all

1196
01:52:54,006 --> 01:52:56,133
what you believe doesn't
change the truth

1197
01:52:56,409 --> 01:52:57,341
And the truth is...

1198
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:59,837
...your marriage with Sharon
is being settled!

1199
01:53:00,246 --> 01:53:02,806
Stop, Anna!
Listen to me...

1200
01:53:03,849 --> 01:53:06,750
I'm sure I can persuade
Mummy and Daddy

1201
01:53:07,019 --> 01:53:10,887
They can't refuse when they
know how we feel. It's true

1202
01:53:13,659 --> 01:53:17,220
All right. I'll go speak to
them right now. Wait here

1203
01:53:33,546 --> 01:53:39,849
you'll be happy to know that
our son Chris is to marry...

1204
01:53:40,086 --> 01:53:43,783
...Sharon, daughter of
Mr. & Mrs. D'Cunha!

1205
01:54:12,985 --> 01:54:16,421
Ok, brothers! Get ready for
the next show

1206
01:54:16,689 --> 01:54:18,281
you've only two days left

1207
01:54:19,959 --> 01:54:22,519
you must have a new song
for this show

1208
01:54:22,895 --> 01:54:26,888
More terrific than the
earlier one! A super hit!

1209
01:54:27,366 --> 01:54:28,333
It'll be done

1210
01:54:28,701 --> 01:54:32,262
you've come alone, Tony!
Where's Anna?

1211
01:54:32,872 --> 01:54:34,430
She won't come today.
- Why?

1212
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:37,408
She isn't well

1213
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:39,805
Nothing serious, I hope?

1214
01:54:40,279 --> 01:54:42,747
She'll come on time from tomorrow

1215
01:54:46,519 --> 01:54:49,113
what's happened to Anna?

1216
01:54:49,488 --> 01:54:51,456
Nothing, as I told you.
She'll come from tomorrow

1217
01:54:51,724 --> 01:54:53,282
But why hasn't she come today?
Something is wrong

1218
01:54:53,792 --> 01:54:55,350
It's nothing, I tell you

1219
01:54:55,861 --> 01:54:58,989
you're lying, Tony.
Something's surely wrong

1220
01:54:59,231 --> 01:55:03,133
you have got to tell me!
Tell me. What happened?

1221
01:55:03,502 --> 01:55:06,869
Chris' parents have fixed
his marriage to some Sharon

1222
01:55:08,207 --> 01:55:11,005
Anna came to know this last night

1223
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:14,838
oh, what a pity, yaar!

1224
01:55:15,548 --> 01:55:16,913
The poor girl's in a bad state

1225
01:55:18,617 --> 01:55:22,383
She didn't want to sing.
She agreed for the band's sake

1226
01:55:23,522 --> 01:55:25,353
Chris shouldn't have done this

1227
01:55:26,492 --> 01:55:27,584
I'll be off now

1228
01:55:28,093 --> 01:55:31,654
Sunil, let's have a really
hot song

1229
01:55:32,131 --> 01:55:36,124
It should pierce one's heart
like a bullet

1230
01:55:36,936 --> 01:55:37,903
And leave it wounded!

1231
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:40,500
Don't worry. What I've in
mind'll shatter everyone!

1232
01:55:41,006 --> 01:55:43,236
We'll create havoc in
Chinatown this time!

1233
01:55:45,711 --> 01:55:51,741
Remember! Today's the 14th.
The program's on the 16th

1234
01:55:51,984 --> 01:55:53,474
you've only two days left!

1235
01:55:57,890 --> 01:55:59,289
Come on, finish it fast

1236
01:56:02,728 --> 01:56:04,889
Today's the 14th, isn't it?
- Yes. Why?

1237
01:56:05,364 --> 01:56:10,358
14th... 14th... There's
something today...

1238
01:56:11,170 --> 01:56:14,606
Something very important...
concerning me...

1239
01:56:15,307 --> 01:56:16,899
oh well! What's this thing?

1240
01:56:17,176 --> 01:56:20,077
I know it's something
but can't remember what...

1241
01:56:20,446 --> 01:56:23,040
It's not important if you
can't remember

1242
01:56:23,415 --> 01:56:24,109
why're you worried?

1243
01:56:24,516 --> 01:56:26,108
Let's write the song...
Listen to this, Imran

1244
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:28,548
what happened?

1245
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:32,816
How could I forget!

1246
01:56:33,659 --> 01:56:35,092
My results will be out today!

1247
01:56:42,701 --> 01:56:47,661
O Bhagwan! Let me pass this time.
Everything's in your hands

1248
01:56:48,274 --> 01:56:49,639
Please don't crush my hopes!

1249
01:57:08,093 --> 01:57:11,324
O Lord! I ducked thrice.
Make me pass this time!

1250
01:57:14,566 --> 01:57:17,364
O Allah! Please help me
get through!

1251
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:20,736
Grant me passing marks!

1252
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:38,879
Why's courage got to do?
Open it and look for the number

1253
01:57:40,559 --> 01:57:43,995
well, you see and tell me...
I can't bear to look!

1254
01:57:45,798 --> 01:57:47,732
What's your number,
brother?

1255
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,560
1599.
- Lucky No! No need to see

1256
01:57:50,903 --> 01:57:51,835
Please see...

1257
01:57:54,506 --> 01:57:56,440
1100... 1200... 1500...

1258
01:57:57,042 --> 01:58:00,500
1595... 1598...

1259
01:58:13,792 --> 01:58:15,555
what's after 1598?

1260
01:58:17,363 --> 01:58:20,491
1599! Please look

1261
01:58:34,213 --> 01:58:36,681
Let it be, man. You'll pass
next time, yaar

1262
01:58:37,049 --> 01:58:39,313
I'm not bothered
whether I pass or fail

1263
01:58:39,885 --> 01:58:42,046
only one thing matters in
life... my music!

1264
01:58:42,521 --> 01:58:45,319
I won't be a better musician
if I passed or had a degree!

1265
01:58:47,559 --> 01:58:50,255
A degree or a lack of it
won't make a difference

1266
01:58:50,529 --> 01:58:53,157
It does, sir. It makes a
difference to my father

1267
01:58:53,532 --> 01:58:56,990
If he knows I failed
put me in the garage!

1268
01:58:57,469 --> 01:58:59,300
Then it means I won't
get out of the house

1269
01:58:59,772 --> 01:59:03,230
It's the end of my music
the band and Chinatown!

1270
01:59:03,609 --> 01:59:06,407
What!?
The end of Chinatown!

1271
01:59:06,779 --> 01:59:11,011
But son, you are the life
of this band!

1272
01:59:11,383 --> 01:59:13,510
Nothing can be done
without you

1273
01:59:14,119 --> 01:59:19,182
But my fate has been
decided...

1274
01:59:19,591 --> 01:59:22,219
Nobody can change it!

1275
01:59:22,494 --> 01:59:25,827
What do you mean, nobody can
change it! We must find a way

1276
01:59:27,966 --> 01:59:30,662
There is a way...

1277
01:59:30,903 --> 01:59:35,033
There's no way. This isn't
trivial, sir. I've failed!

1278
01:59:35,607 --> 01:59:38,542
Sunil, who says you've failed?

1279
01:59:39,011 --> 01:59:40,945
This... The paper says it!

1280
01:59:41,313 --> 01:59:42,575
Well, It says wrong.

1281
01:59:44,483 --> 01:59:47,475
You haven't failed.
You have passed, man!

1282
01:59:48,086 --> 01:59:51,613
The paper has missed your
number because of a mistake

1283
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:53,148
Understand?

1284
01:59:53,725 --> 01:59:54,657
...No...

1285
01:59:55,027 --> 01:59:59,225
It's a very simple matter man...
A false mark sheet

1286
02:00:05,070 --> 02:00:08,096
Everything'll be okay

1287
02:00:08,474 --> 02:00:10,066
Daddy is very angry

1288
02:00:10,442 --> 02:00:13,343
If he knows that you
failed... Be careful

1289
02:00:14,713 --> 02:00:24,281
Nothing'll happen, you see!
It'll be alright

1290
02:00:25,858 --> 02:00:28,190
Get out!

1291
02:00:28,694 --> 02:00:33,791
Calm down. Everyone will hear.

1292
02:00:34,066 --> 02:00:36,193
I don't care. Get out!

1293
02:00:36,568 --> 02:00:37,193
But Dad...

1294
02:00:37,469 --> 02:00:39,266
Don't you Daddy me
damn you!

1295
02:00:39,771 --> 02:00:44,299
It'll all stop now! No more
studies or loafing or music!

1296
02:00:44,543 --> 02:00:46,374
No horn! No Chinatown

1297
02:00:47,946 --> 02:00:53,543
First fetch water and clean
the cars

1298
02:00:53,919 --> 02:01:00,222
No need to wait for your
results

1299
02:01:00,692 --> 02:01:01,283
you already failed thrice

1300
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:02,584
But I passed, Dad

1301
02:01:05,063 --> 02:01:06,963
what did you say!
You passed!?

1302
02:01:07,232 --> 02:01:10,793
That's what I've been trying
to say all this time

1303
02:01:31,523 --> 02:01:34,287
Come quickly, Prabha!
Sunil's results are out

1304
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:38,227
Is it all right? You checked
the mark sheet?

1305
02:01:38,597 --> 02:01:41,828
It must be all right.
Anthony got it done

1306
02:01:46,905 --> 02:01:49,703
Never mind, son
Try once again...

1307
02:01:49,942 --> 02:01:51,671
Look, God willing...

1308
02:01:52,044 --> 02:01:54,171
you'll surely pass
the next time. All right?

1309
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:58,343
But he has passed, Prabha!
And with a first class!

1310
02:01:58,951 --> 02:02:02,284
You'll be crazy with joy
when you hear the marks...

1311
02:02:02,888 --> 02:02:05,584
79 percent in Psychology!

1312
02:02:07,893 --> 02:02:16,358
85% in Political Science!
- 95% in Economics!

1313
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:20,868
What's he done! 95%!
- Why? Is it less?

1314
02:02:21,139 --> 02:02:23,369
No, it's more! More than
necessary

1315
02:02:23,875 --> 02:02:26,105
No one's got 95%
in Economics so far!

1316
02:02:26,478 --> 02:02:29,174
So what! You got it now.
It's happy news

1317
02:02:29,448 --> 02:02:32,975
No, absolutely not! All I
wanted were passing marks

1318
02:02:33,251 --> 02:02:36,186
you should've told me first

1319
02:02:36,555 --> 02:02:40,753
Anthony is your fan and
must've got carries away

1320
02:02:40,993 --> 02:02:41,823
what can I do!

1321
02:02:43,095 --> 02:02:45,859
Look at the results! See
how happy your parents are

1322
02:02:46,231 --> 02:02:50,031
But Prabha, how can anyone...

1323
02:02:50,402 --> 02:02:52,393
...get such good marks
after failing thrice!

1324
02:02:52,771 --> 02:02:55,569
Why not? Hasn't my son done
it and shown you!

1325
02:02:56,041 --> 02:02:57,531
Right, son?

1326
02:02:57,909 --> 02:03:02,437
Yes, Mummy. To tell you
I had studied sincerely

1327
02:03:02,948 --> 02:03:04,973
See how capable my son is!

1328
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:08,148
I knew he cold do anything
if he wanted to

1329
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,445
Mr. Vinayak, I must tell you...

1330
02:03:10,822 --> 02:03:14,019
your son doesn't waste his
time. He's very talented

1331
02:03:14,393 --> 02:03:15,985
And has brought home today...

1332
02:03:16,361 --> 02:03:20,263
...the first earnings from
his talent... you give them

1333
02:03:26,438 --> 02:03:32,502
15 hundred! That means
a thousand five hundred!

1334
02:03:33,979 --> 02:03:36,447
You see this!? The boy you
used to scold...

1335
02:03:36,815 --> 02:03:38,510
...and thought useless...

1336
02:03:38,884 --> 02:03:40,715
How good and able he is!

1337
02:03:41,286 --> 02:03:45,188
Wonderful! Well done my son!

1338
02:03:48,026 --> 02:03:50,961
I don't feel good...

1339
02:03:53,265 --> 02:03:54,732
...cheating my parents
like this!

1340
02:03:56,001 --> 02:03:58,469
I shouldn't have done this

1341
02:03:59,371 --> 02:04:02,932
what's done is done.
Forget it and have fun

1342
02:04:03,308 --> 02:04:06,334
See you in Chinatown
tomorrow

1343
02:05:32,998 --> 02:05:36,331
Hello Anna. See what I've
brought you!

1344
02:05:38,036 --> 02:05:41,472
Nice, isn't it. Like it?
...well, I'll keep it here

1345
02:05:50,382 --> 02:06:00,257
I can't bear to see you
unhappy, Anna

1346
02:06:07,432 --> 02:06:10,094
you should be the happiest
loveliest girl in the world

1347
02:06:12,671 --> 02:06:15,139
you know, if I could...

1348
02:06:15,607 --> 02:06:17,973
I'd do anything to make you happy

1349
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:24,771
Just once...
please smile a little

1350
02:06:25,784 --> 02:06:32,189
Then I'll make you laugh
so much...

1351
02:06:43,268 --> 02:06:46,260
And please come to rehearsal.

1352
02:07:37,555 --> 02:07:39,785
Oh, you're home!
- What's happening here?

1353
02:07:40,158 --> 02:07:41,955
Mummy and Daddy
are waiting for you

1354
02:07:42,427 --> 02:07:44,987
Mummy, Daddy!
Sunil has come

1355
02:07:46,031 --> 02:07:47,965
Great! My son has come

1356
02:07:48,433 --> 02:07:50,594
Sunil wants to know what's
happening here

1357
02:07:51,069 --> 02:07:55,028
All that's happening here
is only for you, son

1358
02:07:56,174 --> 02:08:00,941
one moment! Please...
Some quiet, please

1359
02:08:01,212 --> 02:08:02,008
our son Sunil is here

1360
02:08:02,414 --> 02:08:06,407
Please give him a big hand
for passing his exam!

1361
02:08:15,827 --> 02:08:18,819
Oh Sunil! What you did
is great, yaar

1362
02:08:19,764 --> 02:08:23,200
you've shown the whole world
what you really are

1363
02:08:23,601 --> 02:08:25,626
I'm so happy for you!

1364
02:08:26,204 --> 02:08:29,435
Friends, it's most happy
day for me

1365
02:08:30,275 --> 02:08:32,641
I want to tell you all
something

1366
02:08:33,011 --> 02:08:36,469
In fact, I was very angry
with Sunil for failing thrice

1367
02:08:37,048 --> 02:08:40,176
I gave up all hope,
all expectations

1368
02:08:40,785 --> 02:08:43,253
I was most irritated
by his music

1369
02:08:44,055 --> 02:08:45,852
He'd play his horn all day
and night too!

1370
02:08:46,224 --> 02:08:48,658
How many sleepless nights!

1371
02:08:50,028 --> 02:08:51,461
What I mean to say is...

1372
02:08:51,830 --> 02:08:56,392
My wife... and so many of
you perhaps...

1373
02:08:56,968 --> 02:09:01,405
...thought that Sunil was
totally useless...

1374
02:09:01,906 --> 02:09:03,703
...he'd never amount to much
in life

1375
02:09:04,976 --> 02:09:06,876
And as for me, I was
absolutely sure...

1376
02:09:07,245 --> 02:09:10,180
...that he'd fail this year too!

1377
02:09:12,183 --> 02:09:13,343
But today...

1378
02:09:15,253 --> 02:09:17,050
...I've got everything
in life!

1379
02:09:17,756 --> 02:09:23,023
I don't want anything more.
Never again'll I say to him...

1380
02:09:23,428 --> 02:09:25,123
Son, come and work in
my garage!

1381
02:09:25,830 --> 02:09:27,855
No, son. Do whatever
you want

1382
02:09:28,233 --> 02:09:30,463
Make music your career
if you wish

1383
02:09:30,869 --> 02:09:32,996
yes. My blessings are
with you

1384
02:09:33,705 --> 02:09:34,535
May God...

1385
02:09:34,906 --> 02:09:36,168
...give you happiness and success

1386
02:09:45,183 --> 02:09:49,381
And my son... here's a gift
from all of us

1387
02:09:58,963 --> 02:10:00,430
you see what this mark sheet
has done?

1388
02:10:02,133 --> 02:10:06,092
I just don't know what to
do... It's so suffocating

1389
02:10:06,704 --> 02:10:08,729
I'm feeling bad too

1390
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:12,038
I didn't know it'd go
this far

1391
02:10:13,278 --> 02:10:16,509
Don't be afraid. I'll go
speak to your parents

1392
02:10:16,781 --> 02:10:19,477
No! Don't do it!
Don't know how they'll react

1393
02:10:19,951 --> 02:10:24,911
But they must be told
somehow...

1394
02:10:42,340 --> 02:10:46,208
you had a false mark sheet made!

1395
02:10:58,790 --> 02:11:01,054
Why on earth did you
do it, Sunil

1396
02:11:06,731 --> 02:11:10,963
your family is so happy
that you passed...

1397
02:11:11,336 --> 02:11:12,826
And threw such a nice
party for you

1398
02:11:13,438 --> 02:11:17,738
Have you thought of their
state if they know this!?

1399
02:11:26,117 --> 02:11:27,584
I've done something very
wrong...

1400
02:11:29,487 --> 02:11:30,977
Please forgive me

1401
02:11:31,589 --> 02:11:34,251
Please tell them,
I feel so wretched

1402
02:11:34,959 --> 02:11:36,426
No, I won't tell them

1403
02:11:36,694 --> 02:11:38,958
you did it and you must tell
them the truth

1404
02:11:39,330 --> 02:11:41,355
I can't! How can I!

1405
02:11:41,733 --> 02:11:43,997
You told the lie, so you
must tell the truth too

1406
02:11:44,469 --> 02:11:49,566
Go, Sunil, Go now,
this very instant!

1407
02:12:19,204 --> 02:12:23,004
It was a false mark sheet! You
failed! Aren't you ashamed!

1408
02:12:23,374 --> 02:12:26,502
Why're you silent, you wretch!
Come on, tell me!

1409
02:12:26,911 --> 02:12:31,780
Go drown yourself in some
dirty gutter!

1410
02:12:34,552 --> 02:12:36,247
You cheat! Liar!
Dirty wretch!

1411
02:12:37,956 --> 02:12:40,857
You lied to me!
You lied to everyone!

1412
02:12:41,759 --> 02:12:46,196
Get lost! Go away from
here! Now!

1413
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:48,455
Don't show me your face!
Don't step into this house!

1414
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,324
You're dead to me!

1415
02:12:56,107 --> 02:12:58,132
See what our son has done

1416
02:12:59,177 --> 02:13:02,408
Friends, I want to
tell you something

1417
02:13:03,014 --> 02:13:06,472
All that I said about Sunil
just a while ago...

1418
02:13:06,951 --> 02:13:08,213
...is all wrong

1419
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:11,851
That he made us happy...
and we were proud of him...

1420
02:13:12,357 --> 02:13:16,191
That our blessing're with
him... all that is wrong

1421
02:13:17,462 --> 02:13:21,899
All of you came here
to celebrate with us...

1422
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:25,392
...because Sunil passed
with a first class

1423
02:13:26,204 --> 02:13:28,229
It's false... everything's
false

1424
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:32,401
He made a fool of us...
cheated and lied!

1425
02:13:33,444 --> 02:13:37,437
Let alone a first class
he didn't even pass!

1426
02:13:37,815 --> 02:13:39,749
He failed... yes, failed!

1427
02:13:40,551 --> 02:13:46,979
The mark sheet he gave
his father was a fake!

1428
02:13:48,393 --> 02:13:52,261
What he did has made us
hang our heads in shame!

1429
02:13:53,931 --> 02:13:57,059
I'm ashamed that he is my son!

1430
02:14:26,164 --> 02:14:29,964
Vinayak, I've known Sunil
for so long

1431
02:14:30,435 --> 02:14:33,131
I know what's good and
what's bad in him

1432
02:14:33,504 --> 02:14:36,496
Don't judge him by standards
of passing and failing

1433
02:14:37,041 --> 02:14:40,374
Look, there're some people
in the world who want...

1434
02:14:40,745 --> 02:14:45,944
...to live life their own way.
It's no use forcing them

1435
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:50,447
Such souls aren't worried
about finding goals in life

1436
02:14:50,722 --> 02:14:54,021
Life's journey is everything
to them

1437
02:14:54,926 --> 02:14:57,622
This is the greatest thing
about Sunil

1438
02:14:57,995 --> 02:15:00,463
To live such a life needs
great courage

1439
02:15:01,165 --> 02:15:02,860
And it is Sunil's courage...

1440
02:15:03,167 --> 02:15:07,365
...that made him own up his
wrong doing before everyone

1441
02:15:07,772 --> 02:15:09,797
To confess your wrong doing
before so many...

1442
02:15:10,308 --> 02:15:12,674
...is no small thing!

1443
02:15:13,144 --> 02:15:17,046
It shows how pure of heart
Sunil is!

1444
02:15:18,082 --> 02:15:19,777
Sunil hasn't failed...

1445
02:15:20,151 --> 02:15:22,949
He has passed with cent
percent marks!

1446
02:15:24,655 --> 02:15:27,749
You should be proud to have
a son like him, vinayak!

1447
02:15:28,226 --> 02:15:30,057
If you feel what I said
is right...

1448
02:15:30,561 --> 02:15:34,429
Say that you've forgiven Sunil.
Say it, vinayak

1449
02:15:36,334 --> 02:15:38,928
Listen, vinayak...

1450
02:15:39,303 --> 02:15:41,533
you have to say you have
forgiven Sunil

1451
02:15:42,039 --> 02:15:49,878
Say that you have forgiven Sunil!
Say it, vinayak

1452
02:16:34,859 --> 02:16:38,226
"A blithe spirit is he"

1453
02:16:38,596 --> 02:16:41,929
"one in thousands
is he"

1454
02:16:42,633 --> 02:16:45,727
"A blithe spirit is he"

1455
02:16:46,237 --> 02:16:48,899
"one in thousands
is he"

1456
02:16:50,374 --> 02:16:53,138
"All you ever saw
were only his flaws"

1457
02:16:53,544 --> 02:16:57,207
"But his talents
you never saw"

1458
02:16:57,515 --> 02:17:00,746
"A blithe spirit is he"

1459
02:17:01,352 --> 02:17:04,685
"one in thousands
is he"

1460
02:17:05,389 --> 02:17:08,586
"All you ever saw
were only his flaws"

1461
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:12,191
"But his talents
you never saw"

1462
02:17:12,797 --> 02:17:17,234
"A blithe spirit is he"

1463
02:17:56,941 --> 02:18:03,972
"So lost in your own world
are you"

1464
02:18:04,482 --> 02:18:12,184
"How would you ever know
what's in his heart"

1465
02:18:16,127 --> 02:18:23,090
"So lost in your own world
are you"

1466
02:18:23,467 --> 02:18:30,305
"How would you ever know
what's in his heart"

1467
02:18:31,242 --> 02:18:34,473
"what I thought
was stone"

1468
02:18:34,845 --> 02:18:38,076
"Has turned into a diamond"

1469
02:18:38,549 --> 02:18:41,677
"All you ever saw
were only his flaws"

1470
02:18:42,086 --> 02:18:45,647
"But his talents
you never saw"

1471
02:18:46,157 --> 02:18:49,456
"A blithe spirit is he"

1472
02:18:49,961 --> 02:18:53,362
"one in thousands
is he"

1473
02:18:53,931 --> 02:18:58,925
"A blithe spirit is he"

1474
02:19:35,906 --> 02:19:42,539
"The flute was for you
only a lifeless stick"

1475
02:19:43,014 --> 02:19:50,182
"Did you ever hear
the melody of its song?"

1476
02:19:54,525 --> 02:20:01,454
"The flute was for you
only a lifeless stick"

1477
02:20:01,832 --> 02:20:09,000
"Did you ever hear
the melody of its song?"

1478
02:20:09,607 --> 02:20:12,599
"All you ever saw
was the lamp's lowly mud"

1479
02:20:13,110 --> 02:20:16,546
"Did you ever see
its bright flame?"

1480
02:20:17,148 --> 02:20:20,049
"All you ever saw
were only his flaws"

1481
02:20:20,451 --> 02:20:24,114
"But his talents
you never saw"

1482
02:20:24,488 --> 02:20:27,946
"A blithe spirit is he"

1483
02:20:28,325 --> 02:20:31,761
"one in thousands is he"

1484
02:20:32,329 --> 02:20:35,264
"A blithe spirit is he"

1485
02:20:36,233 --> 02:20:39,464
"one in thousands is he"

1486
02:20:40,171 --> 02:20:47,668
"A blithe spirit is he"

1487
02:20:58,631 --> 02:21:01,725
Sunil, I gotta know just now...

1488
02:21:02,301 --> 02:21:04,565
you got a first class...
with distinction too!

1489
02:21:10,843 --> 02:21:15,837
Show this one. Better huh?
100 out of 100!

1490
02:21:16,215 --> 02:21:17,477
He's brought another
mark sheet!

1491
02:21:35,001 --> 02:21:39,097
Anna my child, I know
you loved Chris very much

1492
02:21:39,472 --> 02:21:40,837
And you still love him
very much

1493
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:44,898
But you know,
in life...

1494
02:21:45,144 --> 02:21:48,602
...we don't get all that
we want and ask for

1495
02:21:49,982 --> 02:21:51,574
And... Sunil is such a
nice boy

1496
02:21:52,285 --> 02:21:54,116
He loves you so much,
doesn't he

1497
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:58,486
He'll make you very happy.
Isn't that so, Albert?

1498
02:21:59,659 --> 02:22:02,457
Think about him, child.
Think about Sunil

1499
02:22:13,873 --> 02:22:16,137
Sunil, my son

1500
02:22:16,509 --> 02:22:20,605
Have you ever thought of
getting married?

1501
02:22:21,213 --> 02:22:24,979
Marriage!? Whose?
You're joking, Daddy

1502
02:22:25,284 --> 02:22:26,842
I never ever thought of
marriage... never...

1503
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:29,914
Some girl you like may be...

1504
02:22:30,289 --> 02:22:40,187
Girl!? I don't even think.
- What about Anna?

1505
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:46,939
Anna! Did you say Anna?
You mean... our Anna?

1506
02:22:47,206 --> 02:22:50,004
Yes, our Anna.
Simon and Mary's Anna

1507
02:22:50,509 --> 02:22:53,137
So you're asking me about Anna...

1508
02:22:55,047 --> 02:22:56,981
we're pretty good friends

1509
02:23:08,728 --> 02:23:12,186
That's better!
Listen, last night...

1510
02:23:12,565 --> 02:23:15,329
we talked to Simon and Mary...
about your marriage to Anna

1511
02:23:16,035 --> 02:23:19,368
you should be happy to know
that they agreed

1512
02:23:21,841 --> 02:23:25,607
we'll have a church wedding
and one as per our custom

1513
02:23:26,312 --> 02:23:29,873
Go to Anna's house and
ask her father's permission

1514
02:23:30,249 --> 02:23:32,615
That's the way it's done
among Christian folks

1515
02:23:33,119 --> 02:23:34,916
you mean I must go today

1516
02:23:35,287 --> 02:23:37,881
Not today, now!
This very minute!

1517
02:23:40,459 --> 02:23:43,587
Here, take this gift...

1518
02:23:43,863 --> 02:23:45,421
Give it to our
daughter-in-law to be

1519
02:24:15,294 --> 02:24:18,855
I'm happy to see you came by
the door and not the window

1520
02:24:20,666 --> 02:24:22,759
well, sit down...

1521
02:24:29,275 --> 02:24:30,435
So, tell me now

1522
02:24:53,432 --> 02:24:55,764
I wanted to ask you...

1523
02:24:56,135 --> 02:24:59,468
Actually, I mean...

1524
02:24:59,772 --> 02:25:01,433
I wanted to... er ask your
permission...

1525
02:25:02,274 --> 02:25:04,970
why're you getting
so nervous, son?

1526
02:25:05,344 --> 02:25:07,710
Say what you've to simply.
We know why you're here

1527
02:25:12,885 --> 02:25:18,949
I just want to tell you this...

1528
02:25:19,992 --> 02:25:24,759
To me, the most precious and
lovely thing in this world...

1529
02:25:25,064 --> 02:25:26,622
...is your daughter Anna

1530
02:25:27,466 --> 02:25:33,405
And I know that everybody
thinks I'm useless

1531
02:25:34,406 --> 02:25:36,237
But I promise you this...

1532
02:25:36,842 --> 02:25:40,505
I'll always keep her happy
whatever happens

1533
02:25:41,213 --> 02:25:42,475
Because...

1534
02:25:43,082 --> 02:25:55,017
I love her very much...
so very much

1535
02:25:56,061 --> 02:25:58,188
we understand, my son.
We do understand

1536
02:25:59,565 --> 02:26:02,966
I've full faith that you'II,
make our Anna happy, Sunil

1537
02:26:05,738 --> 02:26:08,332
Uncle, then you consent
to this marriage?

1538
02:26:08,707 --> 02:26:12,939
We consent most happily

1539
02:26:13,646 --> 02:26:17,412
Come on, let's celebrate
with sweets

1540
02:26:27,459 --> 02:26:29,586
Let him eat, Mom.
It's a such a happy occasion

1541
02:26:30,195 --> 02:26:31,992
All right, eat

1542
02:26:34,466 --> 02:26:35,797
All three of us are going
to Church

1543
02:26:36,168 --> 02:26:38,102
I've something important to
discuss with Fr. Braganza

1544
02:26:56,255 --> 02:26:58,189
Such lovely flowers!

1545
02:27:02,394 --> 02:27:06,160
I've something to say to
you, Anna.

1546
02:27:07,866 --> 02:27:09,197
Actually, I want to say that...

1547
02:27:11,537 --> 02:27:12,697
This is the limit, Anna!

1548
02:27:13,072 --> 02:27:16,200
I've said all this so often
but I can't say it today!

1549
02:27:17,009 --> 02:27:22,743
Anna, try and understand
what I'm saying... that I...

1550
02:27:23,115 --> 02:27:25,481
That you love me very much Sunil

1551
02:27:26,852 --> 02:27:28,251
yes, Anna!

1552
02:27:29,054 --> 02:27:32,956
I'll always keep you happy Anna.
I won't trouble you!

1553
02:27:34,193 --> 02:27:36,753
All that I want is...

1554
02:27:38,130 --> 02:27:39,722
...you love me too...

1555
02:27:40,332 --> 02:27:42,266
...as much as I love you!

1556
02:28:25,611 --> 02:28:28,205
I agree I should've told my
parents about you earlier

1557
02:28:29,014 --> 02:28:31,039
But on the night of
the party...

1558
02:28:31,417 --> 02:28:33,977
I was going to tell them...
it all happened so quickly...

1559
02:28:34,486 --> 02:28:37,148
I couldn't tell them...
I could say nothing at all

1560
02:28:40,259 --> 02:28:42,853
yes, go on, Chris.
I'm listening

1561
02:28:45,397 --> 02:28:47,228
I'm aware I've done wrong...

1562
02:28:47,833 --> 02:28:50,131
I know I hurt you badly

1563
02:28:50,969 --> 02:28:55,235
But will you never forgive me
for my one mistake?

1564
02:28:55,741 --> 02:28:59,939
All right, I forgive you.
But all this talk is useless

1565
02:29:00,446 --> 02:29:04,974
why! Why's it useless?
You know how much I love you

1566
02:29:05,818 --> 02:29:07,080
But even then...

1567
02:29:07,453 --> 02:29:08,818
you talk this way to me!

1568
02:29:10,723 --> 02:29:12,554
Anna, I'm ready to give up
everything for you...

1569
02:29:13,025 --> 02:29:15,619
My parents, my home...
everything!

1570
02:29:15,994 --> 02:29:21,955
It's no use now! How can I
make you understand, Chris!

1571
02:29:22,234 --> 02:29:23,667
Sunil's parents have talked
to mine

1572
02:29:24,169 --> 02:29:28,037
The wedding date is fixed.
I've said yes, Chris!

1573
02:29:28,974 --> 02:29:31,772
I can't break Sunil's heart
under any circumstances!

1574
02:29:32,578 --> 02:29:35,570
He loves me so much!
So very much

1575
02:29:35,981 --> 02:29:39,314
My love means nothing at all
to you? Has it no value?

1576
02:29:39,685 --> 02:29:43,018
It's too late now...
I'm getting married to Sunil

1577
02:29:47,226 --> 02:29:50,787
All right. If this is your
final wish...

1578
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:54,499
I'll also wish that you are
always happy...

1579
02:29:55,534 --> 02:29:58,833
May Sunil give you the same
love and happiness...

1580
02:29:59,138 --> 02:30:01,231
...that I could have

1581
02:31:12,144 --> 02:31:15,910
Late even today! Wonder when
Sunil will learn to be on time

1582
02:31:18,383 --> 02:31:20,078
How long are we
to wait for Sunil!?

1583
02:31:20,452 --> 02:31:22,579
Don't worry. He must be on
his way

1584
02:31:23,088 --> 02:31:24,988
I can't wait anymore!
I must begin

1585
02:31:25,390 --> 02:31:27,187
I've come, Father...

1586
02:31:32,531 --> 02:31:33,555
How nice you both look!

1587
02:31:34,266 --> 02:31:36,029
Sorry, I was a little late

1588
02:31:36,535 --> 02:31:39,971
Little! A second more and I'd
have performed the wedding

1589
02:31:40,272 --> 02:31:42,934
How can Anna and Chris marry
without Sunil!

1590
02:31:49,214 --> 02:32:08,726
Chris, do you take Anna
for your wife?

1591
02:32:09,835 --> 02:32:10,802
I do

1592
02:32:14,773 --> 02:32:19,642
you are joined before
this gathering

1593
02:32:20,012 --> 02:32:21,843
May God make this union strong

1594
02:32:22,314 --> 02:32:25,442
Let His infinite mercy
bless you

1595
02:32:38,130 --> 02:32:41,463
As a symbol of your love
and trust...

1596
02:32:41,767 --> 02:32:43,325
you may now exchange rings

1597
02:33:17,803 --> 02:33:19,532
Sunil, found the ring?

1598
02:33:34,019 --> 02:33:35,384
I found the ring, Anna?

1599
02:34:20,732 --> 02:34:23,360
Can you tell me where this
address is?

1600
02:34:30,308 --> 02:34:33,209
Go straight. Turn left and
then right at the church

1601
02:34:34,246 --> 02:34:36,612
Turn left before or after
the church?

1602
02:34:39,484 --> 02:34:41,952
All right, I'll take you.
Anyway, I've to go there too.

1603
02:34:50,562 --> 02:34:52,359
Is all this luggage yours!?

1604
02:34:53,598 --> 02:34:55,725
The cabbie said the house
was somewhere nearby

1605
02:34:56,735 --> 02:34:58,965
Don't be scared! I'll carry
it all myself

1606
02:35:47,552 --> 02:35:50,350
you're carrying it all! Give
me the bag at least... please

1607
02:35:50,722 --> 02:35:51,984
No... it's okay

1608
02:35:52,591 --> 02:35:55,754
I've got used to it.
This luggage is nothing!

1609
02:36:05,203 --> 02:36:10,402
Oh look! It's the first time
in my life...

1610
02:36:10,675 --> 02:36:11,903
...that I've seen
a shooting star!

1611
02:36:12,511 --> 02:36:14,979
Oh, we see shooting
stars all the time

1612
02:36:15,680 --> 02:36:16,840
There's one every couple of days

1613
02:36:17,682 --> 02:36:19,377
you know what they say about
shooting stars?

1614
02:36:19,851 --> 02:36:23,651
Make a wish on a shooting and it will
come true

1615
02:36:28,793 --> 02:36:31,887
you guys were worried about what would
happen to our Sunil?

1616
02:36:32,297 --> 02:36:36,199
He's strong. There's no need to worry
about him.

1617
02:36:39,905 --> 02:36:43,136
Get over it just like Sunil did.

1618
02:36:43,542 --> 02:36:45,567
And his love story...
