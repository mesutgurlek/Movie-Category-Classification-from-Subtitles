1
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:52,602
THIS STORY AND ITS CHARACTERS
ARE IMAGINARY.

2
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:58,513
THEY SHOULD NOT BE SEEN TO
REPRESENT REAL PEOPLE OR EVENTS.

3
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,656
DANGLARD'S THE CHINESE SCREEN
PRESENTS <i>LA BELLE ABBESSE</i>

4
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,334
Come see me in the Casbah!

5
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,970
Not too nervous?

6
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,533
Looks like a rough crowd,
Monsieur Danglard.

7
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,541
I'd sooner enter a cage of tigers.

8
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,841
You have to tame them,
or they'll eat you alive.

9
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,449
Hide your fear
and they'll eat out of your hand.

10
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,111
That's easy to say.

11
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:45,461
<i>I was born at Sidi Bel Abbes</i>
<i>in the land of beautiful women</i>

12
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,404
My mother was a princess,

13
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,673
and my father said, "Caramba!"

14
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,620
Don't tell me you'd rather
go back to house painting.

15
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,724
I'm sure you're a great whistler.

16
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,124
When I heard you on your ladder,
I knew I could use you.

17
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,186
- Really?
- I'm telling you.

18
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:21,199
- Will you be in the audience?
- Don't worry. I'll be watching you.

19
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,974
You're doing very nicely.

20
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,704
Evening.

21
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,675
Go ahead, sweetheart.

22
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,916
There he is!

23
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,750
Is this where the fillies weigh in?

24
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,814
How about taking me on as a jockey?

25
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,156
You're too heavy.
They're over there.

26
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,681
Captain, is the country prepared?

27
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,589
All I need say is, lances
have been restored to the cavalry.

28
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,651
How about Russian railway shares?

29
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,560
Hopeless.
Muzhiks walk everywhere.

30
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,533
- What do you say, Coudrier?
- Once I leave my office, "Curtains!"

31
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,934
Incidentally, have you heard
that Konakri has voted a subsidy?

32
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,666
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

33
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,873
Slaves!

34
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,434
Yes, Monsieur Coudrier.

35
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,308
Bring me hookah, hashish
and the navel of La Belle Abbesse.

36
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,241
The paradise of Mahomet,
my dear chap.

37
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,753
Jealous, my friend?
- Like a tiger.

38
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,721
Good evening, my dear prince.

39
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,657
Come to share our worries?

40
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,661
I would greatly like to have worries.

41
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,898
Do I dare ask him to pay my rent?

42
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,867
I'm off to the White Queen.
Who loves me, follows me.

43
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,269
- Montmartre? That's dangerous.
- Exactly.

44
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,103
Where's Montmartre?

45
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,040
Where you were born.

46
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,906
Come.
- Strange idea.

47
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,545
We're going to see
the little ladies!

48
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,678
Inspector, the big fish
don't come here now.

49
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,578
They don't trust me.

50
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,809
Neither do we.
We're watching you.

51
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,819
What a life!
If only I could sell and retire.

52
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,651
Excuse me, Inspector.

53
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,488
Monsieur Danglard, what an honor!

54
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,497
- Scram!
- Hands off the merchandise!

55
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,235
You'll be comfortable here.

56
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,233
What will you have?

57
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,802
- Only champagne for me.
- The lady will have red wine.

58
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,076
It's on the house.

59
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,918
Cherries in brandy for everyone.
- Yes, boss.

60
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,548
What do those stuffed shirts want here?

61
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,156
They're slumming, for thrills.

62
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,539
- She's nice, that little one.
- Which one?

63
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,486
They're wild!

64
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:41,391
Didn't our grandmothers
call this the cancan?

65
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,951
No, the chahut.

66
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,860
Land values are rising here.

67
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,697
You're enterprising.
You'd do well here.

68
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,932
With a clientele like this?
What do you think, Walter?

69
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,133
- I'm just your backer.
- And profit taker.

70
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,200
On occasion.
Ideas are his department.

71
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,041
Alas, I can't afford
to back them myself.

72
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,545
Know what I mean?
- Let's dance.

73
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,519
My little pet!

74
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:12,713
Don't be put off by appearances.
The White Queen is good business.

75
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,980
Ladies?

76
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,016
- Shall we?
- Let's relive our youth!

77
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,782
But ladies!

78
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,220
You like the cancan?

79
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,555
Better than working in the laundry.

80
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,444
You seem upset, pretty lady.

81
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:52,382
Not at all.
I'm enjoying myself enormously.

82
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,117
Do you waltz?

83
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,095
Waltzing with another man?

84
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,301
Our friend Danglard
is straying again,

85
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:52,710
which means our distraught beauty will
seek consolation in Papa Walter's arms.

86
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,931
Come.

87
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,744
You don't care about me.

88
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,149
- He dances so well.
- Do I dance so badly?

89
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,313
That's different. I love you.

90
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,381
You've got a gold mine there.

91
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,121
To dance like that,
he must be a duke.

92
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,685
Or an artist.

93
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,425
- Did you make a date?
- That's enough!

94
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,626
Think what you will, Bidon,

95
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,837
but what little money I have,
I earn honestly.

96
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,169
We'll go somewhere else
on Saturday, Nini.

97
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,172
You don't look too happy.

98
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,640
Coming, my dear?

99
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,812
I'm going home.
Are you coming, Zizi?

100
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,881
You'll exhaust my patience in the end.
Come home with me.

101
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,120
I take orders from no one.

102
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,125
But we are ever at your command.

103
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,432
Come. We'll find
a carriage further along.

104
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,163
Very well.

105
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,834
- You're not angry?
- Of course not.

106
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,240
What do you see in that girl?

107
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,942
Everything and nothing.
She dances like a goddess, that's all.

108
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,881
You said that when you met me.

109
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,648
But I'll never tell her.
I don't even know her name.

110
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,087
- Really?
- I swear.

111
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,520
Don't think I'm jealous.

112
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,256
On the contrary.

113
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,924
At least admit
that I'm not jealous, either.

114
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,899
What's that supposed to mean?

115
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,859
Nothing.

116
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,204
Baron Walter and the others.

117
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,799
Zizi, darling,
that's completely different.

118
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,186
Yes?

119
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,859
It's the bailiff, boss.

120
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,526
A visitor, darling?

121
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,465
Yes, a little social call.

122
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,674
Here.

123
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,849
Can you pay?

124
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,510
Just a moment.

125
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,854
A drop in the ocean.

126
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:37,198
There ought to be 500 louis
in the till of the Chinese Screen.

127
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,872
Perhaps there's a little something
tucked away here.

128
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,205
Here you go.

129
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,069
That's hardly enough.

130
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,583
I regret that I must give you
this summons

131
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,278
and commence an inventory
of your possessions.

132
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,782
They're arresting you? Why?

133
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,518
- Worse than arrest.
- What is it?

134
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,924
Our friend Baron Walter
is out for my skin.

135
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,986
And you're going to let him have it?

136
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,564
He brought up my mortgages.
I can't fight this paper.

137
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,294
Is that all the trouble?

138
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:13,304
I must place it directly in the hands
of the person concerned.

139
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,337
Vixen!

140
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,812
Now it's in the hands of
"the person concerned."

141
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,717
I shall leave my clerk
to make the inventory.

142
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,286
General Boulanger calls on me often.

143
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,019
I'll remember you
when he's in power.

144
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,591
You're tilting against windmills.

145
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,098
They've no end of such bits of paper.

146
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,326
- Are you unhappy?
- Not with you at my side.

147
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,733
If you wish, I'll give up
everything for you.

148
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,032
Can you see yourself living
in a cottage on bread and love?

149
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,107
I don't need much.

150
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:58,673
In the big fireplace we could roast
the wild boar you'd kill in the hunt.

151
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,248
We'd have a very ancient cook

152
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,780
and a terribly young servant girl
to do the cleaning.

153
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,385
Sounds like
a perfectly balanced bill.

154
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,393
Now get dressed, darling.

155
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,794
I will.

156
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,798
But Walter will pay for this!

157
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,106
Is this really the horn used in
Emilienne de Passy's famous number?

158
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,509
She sounded like
the English queen herself.

159
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,409
I found her
on the rue Mouffetard.

160
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,041
You know, I'm a bit of an artiste myself
in my spare time.

161
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,778
I sing, I dance.

162
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,288
My friends all call me
Serpentine Casimir.

163
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,849
Couldn't you give me a chance
at the Chinese Screen?

164
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:45,693
I'd drop everything else in a flash.
Watch what I can do.

165
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,749
I see.

166
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,578
But is the Chinese Screen still mine?

167
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,146
Zizi, help me.

168
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,058
You've got a good job, Casimir.
Keep it.

169
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,960
The theater isn't a living.

170
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,762
Art, audiences, applause -
that's all very nice,

171
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,671
but you're always at the mercy
of the man with the money.

172
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,301
He twists your arm
whenever he pleases.

173
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,239
Tighter!

174
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,273
Slaves - that's what we are.

175
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,682
If I had a son,
I'd make him a civil servant.

176
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,355
Anything with a pension.

177
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,928
Maybe, but the stage is in my blood.
From now on, I'm your man.

178
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:54,499
Well, poor Casimir, you've got
a lovely future ahead of you.

179
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,869
I've seen some changes in the
neighborhood, sir, I can tell you.

180
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,380
All our customers used to be locals,

181
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,282
but last night we even had
a grand duke.

182
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,683
A grand duke?

183
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,911
Careful!
You'll drown your absinthe.

184
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:20,320
He wanted champagne,
but he got absinthe like everyone else.

185
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,324
He even tipped me a louis.

186
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,554
Only the White Queen doesn't change.

187
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,637
- Waiter.
- Sir?

188
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,421
Who's the guy
you were with last night?

189
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,186
He won't set me up in a palace.

190
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,386
He bought me a beer,
then I went home.

191
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,019
- Good day, Henriette.
- Hello, girls.

192
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:02,089
- Have you been shopping?
- What have you got there?

193
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,829
Veal. My boyfriend
has a delicate stomach.

194
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,996
He only eats white meat.

195
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,906
Six months ago
she carried baskets, too.

196
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,466
Some have all the luck.

197
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,545
But she didn't rush into it.
She found out all about him first.

198
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,917
- What about you and Paulo last night?
- What about it?

199
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,891
- You treat him horribly.
- I like him, but he's too young.

200
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,358
Can you see him with a family?
- But he's nice.

201
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,021
He'll be nicer when he's the boss.

202
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,870
Young or old, I'll take
the first who comes along,

203
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,166
provided he gets me out
of that laundry... by respectable means.

204
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,407
Hey, there's your dancer from last night.
- Oh, heavens!

205
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,311
- He's following us.
- You think so?

206
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,714
You have all the luck.
He's loaded!

207
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,775
He's a wonderful dancer.

208
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,115
Come on.

209
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,811
I've got a pebble in my shoe.

210
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,816
You do not.
Look, you got your way.

211
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,112
I did it for you.

212
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,381
Would you like
to become a dancer, miss?

213
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,980
- Everyone knows what that means.
- She's my daughter.

214
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,854
I'm very interested in her, madame.

215
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,154
My daughter is an honest girl.

216
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,925
I don't doubt it.
What does she earn working for you?

217
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,997
She's not for sale.

218
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,796
I want to give her a career.

219
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,961
She already has one.
What kind of career?

220
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,597
The finest of all, dear lady.
The theater.

221
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,472
But there's nothing I can do.

222
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,011
We'll teach you.

223
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,873
And don't suck your thumb.

224
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,146
What would you pay her?

225
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,289
Three francs in training,
100 sous when she appears on stage.

226
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,585
A hundred sous! What luck.

227
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,991
A hundred sous?
When does she start?

228
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,121
- At once, if you like.
- She must finish the day.

229
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,459
Then I'll call for her tonight.

230
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,123
All very well,

231
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,236
but how do I know you're serious?

232
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,031
Here's an advance.

233
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,300
Hold it right there.
I've got a say in this.

234
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,808
What's your name
and where will you have me dance?

235
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,100
My name's Danglard.

236
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,512
At the moment I'm running
the Chinese Screen.

237
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:34,780
And by tomorrow I might -
well, that's another story.

238
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,421
So, shall I come for you later?

239
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,582
Good-bye.

240
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,559
The pleats in this blouse
are a disgrace.

241
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,062
How's the pleat in your backside?

242
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,781
It's expected among theater people.

243
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,013
You have to do it
or you get nowhere.

244
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:12,587
- That's what bothers me.
- If I were in your shoes -

245
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,157
I always dreamed that Paulo
would be the first.

246
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,226
I'm afraid of looking foolish
with Danglard.

247
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,398
You've still got time
to take a lesson before tonight.

248
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,626
Listen to you!

249
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,100
- Where's your uncle?
- Asleep upstairs.

250
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,524
My little Nini,
now you're my wife.

251
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,828
It's nothing to cry about.

252
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,503
I'm not crying.
I'm just happy.

253
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,319
Come on.
No need to be frightened.

254
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,935
Say olé with more passion.

255
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,946
Where are we?

256
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,349
At Guibole's, your teacher.

257
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,910
Then this is really about dancing?

258
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,479
What did you think?

259
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,821
Well, I thought I'd have to -

260
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,563
It's not like that anymore.
You're behind the times.

261
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,028
A pupil?

262
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,531
Better. An idea.

263
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,933
Let's see your idea.
Come into the light, child.

264
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,211
- I'm not a freak animal.
- I do the talking here.

265
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,741
What do you want to make of her?

266
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,479
You'll be astonished.

267
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,188
Remember your cancan triumphs?

268
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,019
Is that your idea?

269
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:04,527
Yes, and not just for her.
For all your girls, and others besides.

270
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,291
You've lost your marbles.

271
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,693
No, I haven't.

272
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:12,893
Imagine a line of pretty girls
in fancy dress with faces like this one.

273
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:17,408
The cancan is dead.
What could she do with it now?

274
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,942
Why not a minuet?

275
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,039
We'll find a new name for it.

276
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,877
They only go for English names now.

277
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,350
Macadam, Macfarlan,
Pickpocket, Lavatory.

278
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,685
Poor old cancan.

279
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,224
French Cancan.

280
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,954
Not bad.

281
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:41,658
The only thing is, these kids
will never be able to do this.

282
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,461
My gosh!

283
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,335
Only you can revive
the cancan, Guibole.

284
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,904
- Oh, stop.
- I'm serious. Play, Oscar.

285
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,761
Quiet down!
I can't sleep with all that racket!

286
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,531
Shut your trap, philistine!

287
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,771
Help me up.

288
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,304
Off with you.

289
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,641
Isn't this better than washing clothes?

290
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,806
- Yes, but I'll never manage it.
- Sit down.

291
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,650
Sit still.

292
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,391
It's not funny!

293
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,862
- She's flexible.
- So you'll start tomorrow?

294
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,693
- Be here at 8:00 a.m.
- Yes, madame.

295
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,268
Good night.

296
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,712
Hello, Danglard.

297
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,847
Look at the pretty ribbon I found.

298
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,359
Vanity will be your downfall.

299
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,758
And you'll always be a prince.

300
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,627
Do you know her?

301
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,498
That's Prunelle, Queen of the Cancan.

302
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,004
The toast of Paris
before you were born.

303
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,312
- Good night, Monsieur Danglard.
- Night, sweetheart.

304
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,280
I was down in the dumps.

305
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:48,185
But seeing her skip
along the street was a revelation.

306
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,750
Do you know what I'll give them?

307
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:55,489
A taste of the low life for millionaires.
Adventure in comfort.

308
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:00,732
Garden tables, the best champagne,
great numbers by the finest artistes.

309
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,839
The bourgeois will be thrilled
to mix with our girls

310
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,305
without fear of disease
or getting knifed.

311
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,969
But where?

312
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,713
- I just bought the White Queen.
- With what?

313
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:17,354
Well, with drafts, promises,
a lot of hot air.

314
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,083
There's no lack of money.

315
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,819
It's just getting it
out of backers' pockets.

316
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,383
May I make a suggestion?

317
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,118
Just a little song.

318
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,855
Ancient heroes were lauded
by a chorus.

319
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,868
Aren't our heroes today
worthy of the luxury?

320
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,439
I'll be your chorus.
Nice idea, right?

321
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,777
<i>Money is as shy as a turtledove</i>

322
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,116
<i>Money can be wooed</i>
<i>like a maiden's love</i>

323
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:51,645
<i>Money hides shyly beneath widows'beds</i>
<i>Money mounts up in misers'heads</i>

324
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:56,217
<i>Millionaire</i>, <i>banker</i>, <i>courtesan</i>
<i>bigot</i>, <i>aristocrat</i>, <i>holdup man</i>

325
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,793
<i>There's all that money</i>
<i>to be shaken from trees</i>

326
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,023
<i>What's money for Danglard</i>
<i>but shooting the breeze</i>

327
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,537
<i>Forward! Charge the windmills</i>

328
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,230
<i>Soldiers</i>, <i>hold your positions</i>

329
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,401
<i>Forward! Capture the pretty frills</i>

330
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,879
<i>Shake the temple's columns</i>

331
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:21,082
<i>Soldiers! Remember that from the top</i>
<i>of the Moulin de la Galette</i>

332
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:26,419
<i>Forty centuries look down upon you</i>

333
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:35,062
- Casimir, I'm pleased with you.
- Long live the emperor!

334
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:42,165
Zizi, I bring a sinner
eager to repent.

335
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,370
Forgive me, but I can only
offer you the edge of my bed.

336
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,274
I'm punished by my own sins.

337
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:58,353
Lola has told me about your idea
of a Chinese Screen for the masses.

338
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,081
High life for modest purses.

339
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,091
The illusion of high life.

340
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:08,222
Society needs its illusionists,
so I've decided to help you.

341
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,263
First, I'll return your furniture.

342
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,767
No, I'd rather live in a hotel.

343
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,664
In my profession,

344
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:19,539
a home means family and such,
a luxury I can't afford.

345
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,338
As you wish.

346
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:29,018
I'd like to clear up certain
delicate points in our relationship.

347
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,552
Casimir, would you leave us?

348
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,689
You're not going to fight?

349
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,318
Don't be silly.

350
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,724
As you well know, my dear friend,

351
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,632
it wasn't jealousy
that provoked me.

352
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,393
I'm not jealous.

353
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,267
Adrien, don't you love me anymore?

354
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,771
Lola, I adore you.

355
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,438
The precarious modern world

356
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,647
judges by appearance only.

357
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:02,082
Respect them,
and I'll remain your supporter.

358
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,053
Appearances. What do I care?

359
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,214
I do as I please.

360
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,555
Yes, you can afford
to indulge yourself.

361
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:15,827
In the future, when you provoke
the resentment of our Belle Abbesse,

362
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,434
see that it doesn't happen in public.

363
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,830
Sounds like a plan.

364
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,923
- The Prussians!
- Fear not, dear lady. I am here!

365
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,690
Magnificent explosion, Baron.

366
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,858
- The Cossacks have arrived!
- There's no peace anymore.

367
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,295
- They're demolishing the White Queen.
- It's Danglard's doing.

368
00:32:55,373 --> 00:33:01,710
A harmless meeting place for maids,
destroyed for Danglard's den of vice.

369
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,438
I won't set a foot inside.
- It's progress, Commandant.

370
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,813
- That's enough.
- Once more, just for me.

371
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,183
There's no favoritism in dance.
She'll never get it.

372
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,389
What do you say?
- Nothing.

373
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,251
Then I'll go.
Good-bye, Monsieur Danglard.

374
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,661
Madame Guibole.
- Good-bye, sweetheart.

375
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,127
After all, the laundry isn't so bad.

376
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:07,038
My friend's in a hurry.
It's their busy day at the delicatessen.

377
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,773
Who shall I let in,
the two gentlemen or the girl?

378
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,712
All three.

379
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,826
I'm afraid Walter
has an administrative meeting.

380
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,952
- What about Lola?
- The same meeting.

381
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,622
Administrative?

382
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,963
He asked me
to give you this check.

383
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,103
I hear you sold
the Chinese Screen. Why?

384
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,829
For a down payment
on the White Queen.

385
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,169
- Wasn't that for your old age?
- Walter is my partner.

386
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,476
If this flops, he'll employ me
as a messenger in one of his banks.

387
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,444
Any dancing experience?

388
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,984
No, but I was first
in my gymnastics class.

389
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,992
Let's give her a chance.

390
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,605
Report back here tomorrow.
Wear pantaloons.

391
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,172
Next.

392
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,109
I pose for painters.

393
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,446
"The Temptation of Saint Anthony,"

394
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,285
well, that's me.

395
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,391
Let's see what you can do.

396
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,935
- You haven't got it.
- What do you do with the rejects?

397
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,003
Do you need more mine workers?

398
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,942
Excellent idea.
She could do some overtime.

399
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,340
Not likely.

400
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,954
Bring us some punch.

401
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,355
Punch?

402
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,793
Do you need warming up,
my great big Coco?

403
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,006
- I think it's broken.
- Relax. It doesn't break.

404
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,776
She did the splits.

405
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,975
Positions, girls.

406
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,609
Quickly!

407
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,969
Behave, Adrien.

408
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,472
Let's go to the Comédie Française.

409
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,751
Madame's dress and coat.
And get the carriage ready.

410
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,261
Come help us.

411
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,827
Ladies, take your positions.

412
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,368
Are you pleased?

413
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,537
You're still rather stiff. Relax.

414
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:40,842
Now that you're warmed up,
let's take the diagonal.

415
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,169
My dear.

416
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,732
Don't speak, don't move.

417
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,810
I've an awful headache.

418
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,317
I just wanted to say I've arranged
to visit the new building.

419
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,351
My dress, quick!

420
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,584
- What about your headache?
- What headache?

421
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,828
What if we call it
the Palace of La Belle Abbesse?

422
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,727
- Admirable idea.
- Very original.

423
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,300
- What do you think?
- Nothing.

424
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,963
You hypocrites!

425
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,939
I suggest the Cancan Palace.

426
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,101
Enough!

427
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,335
This isn't the circus.
We're working.

428
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,607
Ladies and gentlemen, the establishment
will be called the Moulin Rouge.

429
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,514
<i>At the Moulin Rouge the upper crust</i>
<i>will drink red wine till they burst</i>

430
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,522
No, they'll drink champagne!

431
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,854
I love you, Nini.

432
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,421
I love you too, darling.

433
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,964
I've made great progress.

434
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:07,026
If it depended on me, Monsieur Danglard
could open the show now.

435
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,831
- You're not staying?
- I can't.

436
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:14,067
A government official is coming to see
how the Moulin Rouge is coming along.

437
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,745
We're all going to be there.

438
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,192
An official is coming.

439
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,421
An official at the Moulin Rouge?

440
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,432
Nothing surprises me in the Republic.

441
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,169
What pickings!

442
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,875
A government official!

443
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,436
Monsieur Danglard is sorry
he couldn't receive you personally.

444
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,310
He's up to his ears in work.

445
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,418
Hi, Nini.

446
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,692
What a squadron!

447
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,091
They're taking the bread
from our mouths.

448
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,799
Watch your step, sir.

449
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,834
- Honored.
- How are you, Gustave?

450
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,140
Are you a patron of the arts, Walter?

451
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,877
May I present Lola de Castro
de la Puente y de Extremadura?

452
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:30,546
Honored, madame.
I greatly admire your choreography.

453
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,887
Thank you.
I adore compliments.

454
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,303
I've seen you somewhere before.

455
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,634
It was here, madame,
when it was the White Queen.

456
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,883
Why are you here?

457
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,715
I dance the French Cancan.

458
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,218
- Did Danglard hire you?
- Yes, madame.

459
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,488
Not in front of the minister.

460
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,122
Thank you for coming, Gustave.

461
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,963
Good-bye, sir.

462
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,746
- She's gone crazy.
- What did you do to her?

463
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,188
Get a hold of yourself!

464
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,696
So you wouldn't see her again.
You didn't know her name! Hypocrite!

465
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,193
Lola!

466
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,533
You want to dance the cancan?
Let's see!

467
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,649
Leave me alone!

468
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,877
I love your impulsiveness,
but is this the place?

469
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,446
You should have punished that girl.

470
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,355
- That's not my role.
- I don't understand.

471
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,690
Quiet! Get me my salts.

472
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,078
- I'll go get a doctor.
- Hurry.

473
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,772
She's not dead?

474
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,616
The boss is lifting your girl's skirts.

475
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,419
Does that hurt?

476
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,491
You're a brave little soldier.

477
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,958
Hey, that's my wife!

478
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,530
Your wife? Where did you marry her?
On a street corner?

479
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,599
I'll slap you silly!

480
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,827
Take care of him.

481
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,170
- She'll pay for this!
- Your leg!

482
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:42,872
Let me go!

483
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,652
Nini, that will do.

484
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,326
No scandal, I warned you.

485
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,988
If our lovely lady has crippled Nini,
I'll break your jaw.

486
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,886
Next number, gentlemen.
"Butterflies and Violets."

487
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,427
What about us?

488
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,876
- Excuse me, sir.
- Don't mention it.

489
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,945
I love hand-to-hand combat.

490
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,263
This is really absurd.

491
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,262
Let's put an end to this.

492
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,132
Nini, that's enough.

493
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,806
You too, Lola.

494
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,407
That's enough!

495
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:24,237
This was supposed to be
a friendly meeting.

496
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,042
A family gathering.

497
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,882
We all belong
to the Moulin Rouge family.

498
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,715
Not again!

499
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,967
Are you satisfied?

500
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,703
What's going on here?

501
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,567
The girl's lover
pushed Danglard in the pit.

502
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,238
That's a lie!

503
00:46:57,714 --> 00:47:00,649
- Come with me.
- Let me through.

504
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:12,689
- Hold on there.
- We haven't done anything.

505
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,421
- Take them in.
- Is this justice?

506
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,658
- He didn't do anything.
- Calm down or we'll arrest you too.

507
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,726
- What's this?
- A souvenir from my mother.

508
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,068
- And this one?
- From my grandmother.

509
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,814
Quick, doctor, over here!

510
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,453
- I'm so happy you're all right.
- Leave me alone!

511
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:42,057
- Forgive me.
- I never want to see you again!

512
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,070
Are you family?
Congratulations.

513
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,745
A nice fracture.
Forty days out of action.

514
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,921
The neighborhood's quieted down.

515
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,060
Like the days of the White Queen.

516
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,790
Danglard's not beaten yet.

517
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,056
He'll never find another backer.

518
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,134
His star's on the wane.

519
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,433
What are you doing here?

520
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,375
It's good to see you're better.

521
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,810
I want a word with you, in fact.
- I'm listening.

522
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:45,678
Don't get upset, but the last payment
for the White Queen was outstanding.

523
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,919
- I was in the hospital.
- Still, business is business.

524
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:52,993
I've got enormous commitments.

525
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,892
- To fish!
- No, to my family.

526
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:59,197
My son's going to the polytechnic
and my daughter to the conservatory.

527
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,029
I've been forced to accept
a most tempting offer.

528
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,596
From whom?

529
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:07,275
I've been asked not to reveal that.

530
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:13,412
Well, neither of us has
any more business here.

531
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,576
Congratulations.

532
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,118
There's Madame Prunelle.

533
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,793
So, you're gathering up the leftovers.

534
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,990
You'll come out all right.
You're a prince.

535
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,964
Lend me a louis, will you?

536
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,276
May I see that?

537
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,214
I know that perfume.
May I have it?

538
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,048
My pleasure.

539
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,445
What are your conditions?

540
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,715
No more cancan
and everything as it used to be.

541
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:31,125
Much too high a price.
My means no longer permit such folly.

542
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,126
You lout!

543
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,376
Monsieur Danglard,
may I have a word?

544
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,811
- Certainly.
- In private.

545
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,041
Will you excuse me?

546
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,315
We're very upset.

547
00:50:56,453 --> 00:51:00,890
I've never been
in such an embarrassing situation.

548
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:04,560
Such an old customer and friend -

549
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,888
You have to take my room.

550
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,725
The gentleman looked most upset.

551
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,459
He's got money troubles.

552
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,672
He looked like he was at a wake.

553
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,577
- Well, good-bye.
- I've plenty of time.

554
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,994
When might I take the luggage,
Monsieur Danglard?

555
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,131
You might take it
whenever you wish.

556
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,728
Cheer up, my friends.

557
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,375
I'm sure it must be a wake.

558
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,518
What's all this about luggage?
Are you leaving?

559
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,245
When you're a big star,

560
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:10,324
you'll discover that hotel managers
suffer from a painful lack of cultivation.

561
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,087
You didn't pay for your room?

562
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,825
I can't hide anything from you.

563
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,426
Off you go now.

564
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,966
They're throwing us out, boss.
Where will we go?

565
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:25,040
Well, there are plenty of bridges
over the Seine.

566
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,072
- Wait for us at Guibole's.
- Really?

567
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,475
What a tragedy.
Matter triumphs over mind.

568
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:37,820
If I were a poet,
I'd write a poem entitled

569
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,922
"Soliloquy of the Homeless."

570
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,624
You've got it all wrong.

571
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,383
<i>Once upon a time</i>

572
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,020
<i>Once upon a time</i>

573
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,393
<i>There sat a big</i>, <i>fat</i>
<i>Persian pussycat</i>

574
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:55,036
<i>Then the concierge gave the cat</i>

575
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:59,606
<i>Then the concierge gave the cat</i>
<i>a really pretty little rat</i>

576
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,903
<i>Little rats are tasty fare</i>

577
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,274
<i>In hotel rooms</i>
<i>to be crunched up rare</i>

578
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,386
Haven't you gone yet?

579
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:21,430
You'd better go.
I have packing to do.

580
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:32,901
What is it?

581
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,872
Waiter, some champagne.

582
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,445
- What's gotten into you?
- I wasn't speaking to you, sir.

583
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:40,548
Your best.

584
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:49,592
- Silly girl.
- I forbid you to laugh.

585
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:31,825
I'd never have thought I'd make love
and drink champagne in a chic hotel.

586
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:35,665
If someone told me
I'd fall so in love with a little laundress

587
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:39,134
that I'd feel like a king
when I ought to feel most desperate,

588
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,139
I'd be pretty surprised too.

589
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,612
A little champagne?

590
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,686
Before being Danglard,
what were you?

591
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,022
A waiter in a café.

592
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,132
Please. A sommelier.

593
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:14,372
Lola, I've waited two years
for this moment.

594
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:17,944
Two years ago -
even a few days ago -

595
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,812
I wanted for nothing.
You didn't even exist.

596
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,919
So this has all been out of spite?

597
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,615
And despair.

598
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,929
- Good day, Titi.
- Hello, Thérese.

599
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,329
- Enjoy your meal.
- You too.

600
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,970
- Discard.
- I'll take that.

601
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,109
Lunch!

602
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,814
Sorry, but it's all I could get.

603
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,715
Good thing you kept your job
at the cafeteria.

604
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,324
Monsieur Danglard.
Madame Guibole.

605
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,083
- Delicious.
- Inedible!

606
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,196
- "When the pelican -"
- Can it!

607
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,474
Hello, Paulo.
Sun feel good outside?

608
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,512
What feels good is finding you.

609
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,580
Act 3, Scene 4:
Enter the avenger.

610
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,413
<i>You're breaking my heart</i>

611
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,784
Don't mock me.

612
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,825
I'm not mocking you.
Your timing's perfect.

613
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,121
I had no idea how to make my exit.

614
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,594
The window? I hate heights.

615
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,893
A revolver? Too noisy.

616
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,432
The gas? Disconnected.

617
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,197
I do apologize.

618
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,100
So that's where it stands?

619
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,140
He catches on quickly.

620
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,777
- Keep out of it, the rest of you!
- Go on. You're doing me a favor.

621
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,512
You're too cowardly
to do it yourself.

622
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,348
That's right.

623
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:39,850
Don't count on me.

624
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,456
Then I'll finish my lunch.

625
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,457
Where's Nini?

626
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,659
Eating at her mother's.

627
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,820
I'll go there.

628
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:49,463
As you like.

629
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,493
No, I won't go.
I know Nini.

630
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,195
You've got a strong hand now
because you're down and out.

631
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:58,830
But when you get back
on your feet, I'll be waiting.

632
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,904
You ladies tell Nini that
whenever and wherever she likes,

633
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,774
I'll be waiting for her.

634
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,361
- What a brute!
- He's berserk.

635
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,434
What do you expect
after two months in jail?

636
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:28,366
- Think he has a knife?
- Nini had better watch out.

637
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:30,869
He'll leave her alone.
He got the picture.

638
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,269
Let me listen.

639
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,020
Isn't that a pretty voice?

640
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:54,258
<i>The steps up the hill</i>

641
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,888
<i>Are steep for the lovelorn</i>

642
00:58:56,132 --> 00:59:01,365
<i>But the windmills'sails</i>
<i>shield lovers from the storm</i>

643
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:06,835
<i>Princess of the street</i>
<i>your welcome is sweet</i>

644
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,467
<i>In my wounded heart</i>

645
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,575
Sure you're not afraid
to go out alone?

646
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,046
Are you kidding?

647
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,155
- You know Paolo's not very happy.
- Neither am I.

648
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,015
Don't take the Camembert again.

649
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:28,088
Good-bye, Mother.

650
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,625
Thérese.

651
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,359
Have you got the Camembert?

652
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,431
Where did it go?

653
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,835
- I don't even like Camembert.
- Neither do I.

654
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,631
I'll slap all of you!

655
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,810
- I've come for my blouse.
- It's not ready.

656
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,981
- I was frightened.
- Of me?

657
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,213
Of someone else?

658
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,653
What are you doing here?

659
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,450
Waiting for you.

660
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,852
I've decided to wait
for you my whole life.

661
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,084
- Here?
- Anywhere.

662
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,593
What lovely roses!

663
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,100
It's so trite, bringing
roses to a young lady

664
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,129
but what I have to say
is so important,

665
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,738
I was afraid I couldn't
say it right off,

666
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,601
so I brought roses to -

667
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,505
To break the ice.

668
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,445
But now that I see you,
I want to plunge right in

669
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:22,976
and speak to you seriously.

670
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,915
I have to get to dance class
or Guibole will scold me.

671
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:29,352
I'll talk to her.
She seems like a nice lady.

672
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:34,021
Shall we sit
on the grass up there?

673
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:35,787
- You know it?
- Yes.

674
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,064
Allow me to dream
that I'm the boy next door

675
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,366
taking the girl next door out
for the first time.

676
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:04,991
It's so beautiful here.
May I sit down?

677
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,786
How polite you are.

678
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,760
Too polite for a boy next door?

679
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:11,823
So there's a big gap between us?

680
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:15,435
Miles.
Prince, listen to me.

681
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,470
Let me say
something important first.

682
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,176
I've never been in love,
and I'll never love again.

683
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,278
You are the love of my life.

684
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:25,079
One more thing.

685
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,676
Ask whatever you want of me.

686
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,479
I can give you so much.

687
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,620
Want to be my country's princess?

688
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,948
It is not very rich,
but it is nice.

689
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:38,925
No steel or coal.
Just sheep, tobacco and roses.

690
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,193
We'll get married in the capital.
Archbishop Alexis will bless our union.

691
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,267
The archbishop?

692
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,135
If you prefer to stay here,
I'll make you queen of Paris.

693
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,642
I'll cover you in jewels
and build you a palace.

694
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:02,507
You're sweet, you're handsome
and you're rich.

695
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,310
All a girl could want.

696
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,317
I wish I could love you,

697
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,914
and for that I wouldn't need
an archbishop or a palace.

698
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,289
But I can't love you.

699
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:14,757
The baker boy?

700
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,060
Is it him?

701
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,600
Yes, it's him.

702
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,468
You can't be dancer and bakery girl,

703
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:27,540
but princess and dancer you can be.

704
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,869
I won't be a dancer.

705
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:32,412
What about the lesson
you were rushing off to?

706
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,642
There's no more dance class,
and no more Moulin Rouge.

707
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,046
La Belle Abbesse has bought the site.

708
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,212
Things might be arranged.

709
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,650
The land is expensive.

710
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,656
If it's only money, it's yours.

711
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:48,253
I couldn't.
I'd hate myself.

712
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:51,423
Nini, don't make me suffer.

713
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,868
My life is at stake.

714
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:57,097
Your life?
Now you're joking with me.

715
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,935
Do I look like I am?

716
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,574
Not really.
That's what upsets me.

717
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,340
Life is not as simple
as it seems.

718
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:21,961
They've started work again.
We're done for.

719
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,325
Seems a prince bought the site

720
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:27,127
and is giving Danglard whatever
he needs for his Moulin Rouge.

721
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,429
All for the love of a dancer.

722
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,367
Ah, love.

723
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,014
A real song of the streets.

724
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,832
- I need the piano.
- Take it.

725
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,664
Use a little less vibrato,

726
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:04,272
and flash those pretty eyes
of yours around.

727
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,271
- We have to rehearse.
- Take it. You come with me.

728
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,605
You don't realize, madame.

729
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:14,114
The slightest interruption or noise
and my inspiration vanishes.

730
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,648
- Dance class.
- Right away.

731
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,549
No one understands artistes.

732
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:52,955
What are you waiting for?

733
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:54,622
My foot hurts.

734
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:04,061
- Is she here?
- Every day, just like me.

735
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,631
And you have no suspicions?

736
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:09,169
All lovers have suspicions.
I try to hide mine.

737
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,305
Has she told you
she loves Paulo?

738
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,600
She has.

739
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,833
You haven't noticed anything
between her and Danglard?

740
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:18,742
Just the usual intimacy
among artists.

741
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:28,950
You're blind, my friend.
Let's see if you're deaf too.

742
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:33,161
Nini, come here.
- I'll come if I please.

743
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,161
Don't interrupt work, Lola.

744
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,960
I intend to interrupt
more than work.

745
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,544
Hurry, boss!

746
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,681
What do you want?

747
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,649
First, to congratulate you.

748
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,153
You're doing well for a beginner.

749
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,654
You came to say that?

750
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,853
No, and you know it.

751
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,327
Maybe it's better this way.

752
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,501
I've been meaning
to tell you, Alexandre.

753
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,228
I just didn't know how.

754
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,500
I'm a bad girl.

755
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,007
And you're so kind,
I can't bear to hurt you.

756
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:24,843
Then it's true?

757
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:27,738
Yes, it's true.

758
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,385
I'm his mistress,
and I'm proud of it.

759
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:40,489
- Come now, little one.
- Leave me alone, Oscar!

760
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,290
All right, all right.

761
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,706
I'm so sorry,
but the operation was necessary.

762
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:59,312
Dear madame, may I ask
yet another favor of you?

763
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:00,845
Beat it!

764
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,742
Your French is improving.

765
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:07,820
A few more such adventures
and you'll be a true Parisian!

766
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,956
You have something
to say to me?

767
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:17,930
Just that you're the queen of the shrews
and you'll always have a spot in my show.

768
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,795
My poor darling. Your show!

769
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,402
Class is over.

770
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,438
Get dressed, girls.

771
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:38,542
Prince Alex, when you're free,
remember me.

772
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:49,790
What did she do to you?

773
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:51,350
Special edition! Prince Alexandre
hovering between life and death!

774
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,543
- Another foreigner.
- Can't do without 'em.

775
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,214
Poor Alexandre.

776
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,042
- It's really most upsetting.
- Indeed.

777
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:18,147
Let me finish my story.

778
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:21,719
After he stitched her up, the surgeon
realized he'd lost his monocle.

779
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:25,924
And you know where?
Stitched up inside my poor mother.

780
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,329
Be quiet.

781
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:32,195
This isn't the time for jokes.
We're not at the White Queen.

782
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,667
I make jokes when and where I wish.
Once I leave the office -

783
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:40,604
I know: "Curtains."
But you are a symbol of our class.

784
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:44,804
Appearances are all
that can save us.

785
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,742
That's called hypocrisy.

786
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,212
- I admit it.
- You're a gloomy sort.

787
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,385
Of course. Poor Alexandre.

788
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,715
Ah, yes. A remarkable chap.

789
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,220
- A considerable fortune.
- A future king.

790
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,486
- A real gentleman.
- Descended from Mahomet Ali.

791
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,562
Have you wailing women
finished your act?

792
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:07,033
To think this is my fault!
I'm disgusted with myself!

793
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:09,034
- My dear!
- What a sensitive heart!

794
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:15,437
Our little spat is pure vanity.
Nothing but hot air.

795
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:18,172
After what I've done,
you might not believe this,

796
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,314
but I'll say it anyway.

797
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,644
If things work out,
I'll join you again.

798
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,410
I owe it to Alexandre.

799
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:29,113
Nini, I'd be happy
to have you as my friend.

800
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:32,056
I hope you'll be happy
with Danglard.

801
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:34,788
I can never be happy again.

802
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,625
Don't be angry with me.

803
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:39,996
When I'm in a rage,
I don't know what I'm doing.

804
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:41,466
I'm not angry with you.

805
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:45,639
Who could resist such
a scene of burgeoning friendship?

806
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:51,107
Danglard, let's forget our quarrels.
If you need a backer, I'm your man.

807
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,441
Have you turned into a statue?

808
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,847
So we move ahead
with the Moulin Rouge?

809
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:59,853
Miracles never cease.
Barjelin has understood.

810
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,853
I have faith in miracles,
but not in surgeons.

811
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,722
Suppose Alexandre dies.

812
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,958
His father, the king,
inherits the Moulin Rouge.

813
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,531
He presents it to the archbishop,
who turns it into a convent,

814
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,700
and it's curtains for our cancan.

815
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:17,338
If I were Danglard,
I'd recover the deeds to the site.

816
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,632
And I know who
I'd send on that mission.

817
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,443
Think of your pals, Nini.

818
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,168
Don't count on me.

819
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:29,016
An unremarkable case.

820
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:34,111
The top surgeons aren't interested.
He's saved!

821
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:36,517
The patient is asking for
Mademoiselle Nini.

822
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,869
- Does it hurt?
- Not even that.

823
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:57,878
I've always been clumsy.

824
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:01,208
I've not only been clumsy,
I've been -

825
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,374
What?

826
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,148
Nothing.

827
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,422
Allow me
to be less modest than you.

828
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,254
What do you think of my little
demonstration? Not bad, eh?

829
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,920
Alex, you're so much better
than the rest of us.

830
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:19,796
No better, no worse.
Just different.

831
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:23,132
Animals in the jungle
keep to their own species.

832
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,664
They don't mingle,
under pain of death.

833
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:30,442
I stuck my nose where I shouldn't have,
but I survived. I was lucky.

834
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,338
How well you talk.

835
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:34,643
Will you give me a present?

836
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:35,715
A present? Me?

837
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:44,717
Before I leave, give me
a make-believe memory of Paris.

838
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:48,891
Let me pretend for one evening
that I'm the boy next door

839
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:51,962
taking you out
for the first time,

840
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,459
and that you allow him to love you

841
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:56,070
in silence.

842
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,698
When I'm old,

843
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:03,869
I'll dazzle the younger generations
with my wonderful Parisian romance.

844
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:08,311
- Where shall we go?
- Everywhere.

845
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:34,540
<i>Madame Arthur</i>
<i>set tongues wagging for so long</i>

846
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,041
<i>She'd no need of newspapers</i>
<i>or advertisements</i>

847
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,079
<i>To entertain an army of lovers</i>

848
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:43,116
<i>Madame Arthur</i>
<i>set tongues wagging for so long</i>

849
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,745
<i>You should have seen her dance</i>

850
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:50,047
<i>With all her charm</i>

851
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,160
<i>And yet I love you</i>

852
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:58,392
<i>And yet I love you</i>

853
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:04,338
<i>But you drove me crazy</i>

854
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:08,204
<i>And set me wandering the globe</i>

855
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:13,139
- Lovely, isn't it?
- Yes.

856
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:18,618
<i>So much grief embedded</i>

857
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:22,852
<i>In my poor wandering soul</i>

858
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:30,290
<i>You who pass</i>
<i>through this arbor</i>

859
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:32,864
<i>Come in and drink</i>

860
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:36,260
<i>Drink</i>, <i>young soldiers</i>

861
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:40,566
<i>Drink the wine of victory</i>

862
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:46,042
<i>You ruby-red rascal</i>
<i>Unequaled nectar</i>

863
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:50,777
<i>You fill our hearts with courage</i>

864
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:54,545
<i>O wine of hope</i>

865
01:14:54,790 --> 01:15:00,558
<i>Drink</i>, <i>my friends</i>
<i>this victory wine</i>

866
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:07,024
<i>Be kind</i>, <i>unknown lady</i>

867
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,897
<i>For whom I've so often sung</i>

868
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:14,537
<i>Any small offering is welcome</i>

869
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,372
<i>Please give what you can</i>

870
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,844
<i>Be kind</i>, <i>unknown lady</i>

871
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:24,051
<i>For whom I've so often sung</i>

872
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,882
<i>I welcome you always</i>

873
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:31,388
<i>O unknown lady</i>

874
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,215
Good-bye, Alex.
You'll soon forget me.

875
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:57,145
- This is just a story for youngsters.
- Yes, Grandmother.

876
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:58,776
Don't rub it in.

877
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:02,320
I feel like I've aged ten years
since I left the laundry.

878
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:07,190
We're both veterans of that famous
campaign called the Moulin Rouge.

879
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:09,788
Let's kiss before we part

880
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:12,299
as veterans do.

881
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,839
Good-bye, Alex.

882
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:21,799
One more thing.

883
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:25,442
I'm going home
to a difficult profession.

884
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:30,217
Here I am, incapable of managing
my own little affairs

885
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:33,783
and one day
I must lead millions.

886
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,186
Tobacco, sheep and roses.

887
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:41,655
No more roses -
they were reserved for you.

888
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:49,203
I ask you to accept the only heart
I can still offer.

889
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,741
It's too beautiful.
I'll never dare wear it.

890
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:58,175
Mere pebbles.

891
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:00,910
One soon gets used to them.

892
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:08,450
I almost forgot.
I think you'll find these useful.

893
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:12,318
The deeds to the Moulin Rouge.

894
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:16,426
I've put them in Danglard's name -
it's simplest.

895
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:37,942
Evening, Paolo.

896
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:39,553
Let me by!

897
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:43,952
You can't say I've bothered you
since I got out of jail.

898
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:46,083
Prunelle is dead drunk.

899
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:49,491
Me too.
We've both drowned our sorrows.

900
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:50,959
Poor old woman.

901
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:55,659
Have you really forgotten
all about me and the bakery?

902
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,234
My uncle's retiring.
I'll be the boss.

903
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:04,036
We could go out on Sundays
and take vacations in the country.

904
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:06,280
Of course.

905
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,209
We could have children.

906
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:12,713
We could have been
happy together,

907
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:15,479
but I'm not the same Nini anymore,
my poor Paulo.

908
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:18,215
You'll do fine as you are.

909
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,094
But after your debut,
it'll be another story.

910
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:26,767
I don't want a wife who gives herself
to thousands every night.

911
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,631
Sorry. I've made my choice.

912
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:32,467
You'll end up like Prunelle
when Danglard doesn't need you anymore.

913
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,371
- He'll never leave me.
- Think about it.

914
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:39,603
The moment you appear in public,
you've lost me.

915
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:09,336
Amédé!

916
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,546
Hurry.
I want to see Nini dance.

917
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:21,153
- Why not the pope?
- He doesn't dance.

918
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:25,416
We must be mad
to pay to see Nini's thighs.

919
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,585
- Is she the one who shot the prince?
- Idiot!

920
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:30,457
A person who commits suicide
shoots himself!

921
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:33,566
- His father's a king.
- They're called czars.

922
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:36,737
She had a jailbird boyfriend, too.

923
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,273
We could well see bloodshed tonight.

924
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,432
Then let's leave.
I don't like dramas.

925
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:44,044
Stars don't have dramas,
only scandals.

926
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,410
No luck. I give up.

927
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:56,249
- Shall we see Nini?
- Mustn't be left out.

928
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:59,151
They messed up my dress.
It has to be redone.

929
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,785
It doesn't matter. Put it on!

930
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,863
The solo violin kills my act.
It's the violin or me. Make your choice.

931
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:12,806
Get out of here!

932
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,603
Copper's crashed in New York!
We're ruined.

933
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,640
That carpet should have been
down an hour ago.

934
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:21,678
- You told us to buy.
- It's your fault.

935
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,114
Am I your keeper?

936
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,242
Lend me a hand with that carpet.

937
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:50,236
- This better be a success.
- Have we got much money in this?

938
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:54,039
Rest assured, the Moulin Rouge
will profit us more than it will Danglard.

939
01:20:56,117 --> 01:21:00,884
Thank you, but hold your applause
until you've seen the show.

940
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:05,322
I see several uniforms
of the Russian navy.

941
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:19,129
Doubtless men from the <i>Prince Orlof</i>,
now anchored at Brest.

942
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,100
It's my pleasure to tell
these fine sailors

943
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:26,178
that Catherine,
Empress of all the Russias,

944
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:29,178
in celebration of
the Franco-Russian alliance...

945
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:35,846
has come to review the troops
of the Moulin Rouge.

946
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:39,051
So we've rallied our troupe
to honor her.

947
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:42,058
Catherine's been dead a century,
you'll say.

948
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:47,030
But we here at the Moulin Rouge
attach no importance to such details.

949
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:09,652
<i>Catherine the Great</i>
<i>had a hearty appetite</i>

950
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:13,454
<i>Her mouth began to water</i>
<i>when a real man came in sight</i>

951
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:18,862
<i>To the strains of balalaikas</i>
<i>there was a scuffling midst begonias</i>

952
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,937
<i>But if passion ran colder</i>, <i>it was</i>
<i>"Throw him in the Volga!"</i>

953
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:28,007
<i>Our stalwart grenadiers</i>
<i>are on the march</i>

954
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:33,581
<i>Now the ladies applaud</i>
<i>their bayonet charge</i>

955
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:39,779
<i>But as Queen Hortensia remarked</i>
<i>as a palace ball progressed</i>

956
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:43,254
<i>"In their uniforms so vast</i>

957
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:48,590
<i>One has to guess the rest"</i>

958
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,283
Long live the empress!

959
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:36,801
<i>But as Queen Hortensia remarked</i>

960
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:42,042
<i>"One has to guess the rest"</i>

961
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:35,466
Casimir, go introduce Esther.

962
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,265
Right, boss.

963
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:46,645
Remember, every man in the audience
must believe you sing for him alone.

964
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,179
Understand? Now go on.

965
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,214
Go and work the door.

966
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:31,616
Did you like that?

967
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:36,095
Now we invite you to breathe in

968
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:39,425
the scent of a little flower
from the streets of Montmartre.

969
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:42,536
Our newest star: Esther Georges.

970
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,943
<i>Above the rue Saint Vincent</i>

971
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,413
<i>A poet and an unknown girl</i>

972
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,815
<i>Loved for a brief moment</i>

973
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:02,047
<i>And never met again</i>

974
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:09,087
<i>Hoping the waif would hear it</i>
<i>for her he wrote this song</i>

975
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:14,029
<i>As she wandered the streets</i>

976
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:19,072
<i>One morning in spring</i>

977
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:27,240
<i>The waning moon</i>
<i>shimmering down</i>

978
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:30,283
<i>Crowns your gold hair</i>

979
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:36,590
<i>The gilded moon</i>
<i>with glory festoons</i>

980
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:39,625
<i>Your petticoat bare</i>

981
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,726
<i>The pallid moon</i>

982
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:48,302
<i>Starkly outlines</i>
<i>your tired opal eyes</i>

983
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:55,341
<i>Princess of the street</i>
<i>your welcome is sweet</i>

984
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:58,775
<i>In my wounded heart</i>

985
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:05,017
<i>The steps up the hill</i>

986
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:08,645
<i>Are steep for the lovelorn</i>

987
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:15,090
<i>But the windmills'sails</i>
<i>shield lovers from the storm</i>

988
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:19,957
<i>Little waif</i>

989
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:24,333
<i>I feel your small hand</i>
<i>searching for mine</i>

990
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:31,872
<i>I feel your heart beat</i>
<i>your waist so neat</i>

991
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:34,174
<i>My sorrows decline</i>

992
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:41,318
<i>Yet your lips betray</i>, <i>feverishly</i>

993
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,321
<i>The hunger of years</i>

994
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:49,956
<i>At your touch I feel a rush</i>

995
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,025
<i>That brings me to tears</i>

996
01:27:55,236 --> 01:28:00,606
<i>The steps up the hill</i>

997
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:04,109
<i>Are steep for the lovelorn</i>

998
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:07,408
<i>But the windmills'sails</i>

999
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:10,312
<i>Shield lovers from the storm</i>

1000
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:15,380
<i>But now the rain drips</i>

1001
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:17,821
<i>The moon in eclipse</i>

1002
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,484
<i>My princess has gone</i>

1003
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:27,927
<i>A sky without moon</i>
<i>I sing forlorn</i>

1004
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:32,403
<i>In search of my dream</i>

1005
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,849
- Go and announce Roberto.
- Again?

1006
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:55,452
I work in a mortuary.
I should be used to tears!

1007
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:06,606
And now, the Great Roberto,
the famous whistler.

1008
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:10,368
The soul of a poet,
the whistle of a blackbird!

1009
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:26,986
I owe it all to you.
I'll never leave you.

1010
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:32,966
Go now, little sparrow.

1011
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:34,898
Don't mind me!

1012
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:48,111
Open the door, Nini.

1013
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:50,412
I order you to open this door.

1014
01:29:51,786 --> 01:29:54,778
- Do the cancan without me.
- You've got some timing!

1015
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,030
- Where's Nini?
- She doesn't want to dance.

1016
01:30:03,197 --> 01:30:04,824
Is she crazy?
She'll ruin everything.

1017
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,261
- I'm so sorry.
- Go find Casimir.

1018
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:10,027
- What's going on?
- Nini's letting us down.

1019
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:12,605
Did you cheat on her with Esther?

1020
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,799
You should be ashamed.
A nice girl like Nini?

1021
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:18,070
I could slap you!
- Don't start again!

1022
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:20,271
All ready for the cancan?

1023
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,144
No, keep them happy
with the band.

1024
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,846
We'll have to cut down
the number of dancers.

1025
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:29,388
Never!
You'll take Nini's place.

1026
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:31,355
Are you crazy?
With this mug?

1027
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:32,720
What about it?

1028
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,987
I knew it in the old days.

1029
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:37,427
You knew the chahut,
not the French cancan.

1030
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:41,567
There's a big difference.
Still, you could fill a gap.

1031
01:30:57,418 --> 01:31:02,287
We beg for your patience while
waiting for the French Cancan.

1032
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:13,795
To clear the floor, those who must move
can come and sit on the stage.

1033
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:19,198
Maestro Oscar will entertain us
with a medley of current hits.

1034
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:50,136
I'll see what's going on.

1035
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:56,308
- She won't dance. She finally understood.
- What a shame!

1036
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:05,976
I'm Nini's mother!

1037
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:10,617
Nini, you're terrible!

1038
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,689
- What's going on?
- Your daughter, madame.

1039
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:20,329
She's being stubborn again.

1040
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:22,793
Open up, Nini.

1041
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:24,831
It's your mother!

1042
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:28,741
I'd rather have you smack my face.

1043
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:30,707
Stop being mean.

1044
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:32,274
You hear that?

1045
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:35,912
I'll stay on one condition.

1046
01:32:37,351 --> 01:32:39,012
I want Danglard all to myself.

1047
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:42,552
You want to put me in a cage
like a canary?

1048
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:44,314
I warn you,
it won't last long.

1049
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:47,787
You couldn't stand me
after a couple of weeks.

1050
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:50,725
You want the Danglard
of the theater

1051
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:54,096
or Danglard who wears slippers?
I've never worn them and never will!

1052
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,465
I'll give you some good advice.

1053
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:59,732
If you want a lover,
Alexandre's perfect.

1054
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:02,342
If you want a husband,
marry Paulo.

1055
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:07,607
Choose between jewels and palaces
or a happy retirement by the fireside,

1056
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,647
with honor and dignity,
but I can't give you either!

1057
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:15,882
Do I look like Prince Charming?
Only one thing matters to me -

1058
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:17,547
what I create.

1059
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:20,252
And what do I create? You!

1060
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:21,258
Her!

1061
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,663
There have been others before.
There'll be others to come.

1062
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:28,599
In the end, you think it matters
what you and I want?

1063
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:32,832
All that counts is what they want.
We're at the service of the public.

1064
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:35,169
You know why it breaks my heart
to see you go?

1065
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:38,867
They can smash the place to pieces
for all I care!

1066
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:40,947
But the profession's
losing a good trouper.

1067
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:44,245
I thought you were one of us.
If not, get out!

1068
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:49,685
Line up for the quadrille, girls.

1069
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,289
Lola, get ready.

1070
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:10,668
Wait, I'm coming.

1071
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,009
Take your places for the cancan.

1072
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:21,719
Your dress!

1073
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:33,125
They wouldn't care about Nini
if I'd shot myself over her.

1074
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:34,800
You don't think so?

1075
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:40,971
- What's going on?
- Everything's fine.

1076
01:34:42,643 --> 01:34:44,941
- What about your introduction?
- You do it.

1077
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:47,138
Me?
But Nini isn't ready.

1078
01:34:47,281 --> 01:34:49,647
She will be. Get going!

1079
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,821
Ladies and gentlemen,
the French Cancan!

1080
01:35:31,759 --> 01:35:33,283
Would you sit down?

1081
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:45,896
Hurry.

1082
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:50,729
Never seen a behind before?

1083
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:07,687
I have an idea.
Tomorrow I'll marry you.

1084
01:41:07,828 --> 01:41:10,388
- Time to put an end to everything?
- Perhaps a beginning.

1085
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:13,466
The stock exchange will have
confidence in an empress's husband.

1086
01:42:09,389 --> 01:42:11,323
Mind stepping aside?

1087
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:14,856
You're in the way.

1088
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:12,675
- Still quitting?
- Are you mad?

1089
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:18,051
Would you like
to go on the stage?

1090
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:19,216
Oh, yes!

1091
01:43:46,587 --> 01:43:48,851
