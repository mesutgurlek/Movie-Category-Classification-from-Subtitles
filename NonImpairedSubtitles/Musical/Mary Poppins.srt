<i>Loud and long and clear</i>

964

Mmm-hmm hmm hmm!

01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:42,598
Dreadful.

Sss sss sss!

01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,894
Not at all attractive.

I was hoping you'd turn up.

1010
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,209

<i>The more we're a merrier we</i>

1026
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:37,255
Welcome, children. Welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1027
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,503
Pull up a chair.

1028
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,504
I say, you're a sight.

1029
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:48,933
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.

1030
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,102
He works in a watch factory.

1031
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,896
What's he do?

1032
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,771
He stands about all day
and makes faces.

1033
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,031
Makes faces in a watch factory!

1034
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,529
You made that up.

1035
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,290
That's good.

1036
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,084
Such behaviour.

1037
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:24,965
It's disgraceful
or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

1038
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,298
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

1039
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,180
What's the name of his other leg?

1040
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,138
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of...

1041
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:39,397
Children, it's tea time.
I won't have schedule interruptions.

1042
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,648
Please stay.

1043
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,105
Look, I have tea ready for you.

1044
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:45,986
And it's getting cold.

1045
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,660
I had hoped that maybe you would...

1046
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,958
Splendid! Thank you very much.

1047
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,081
Mind the bread and butter.

1048
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,332
Now watch, children.

1049
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:03,462
I knew she'd do it... A proper tea.

1050
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,795
I suppose you'll want me to pour.

1051
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,551
If I must, I must.

1052
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,553
But stop behaving
like laughing hyenas.

1053
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,354
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.

1054
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,809
- Bert?
- None for me.

1055
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:24,441
I'm glad you came.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.

1056
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:27,816
Pour some milk
for Michael and yourself.

1057
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:31,573
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes.

1058
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:37,330
The other day when it was cold,
a friend bought long underwear.

1059
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:41,496
The shopkeeper said,
"How long do you want it?"

1060
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,379
My friend said,
"From September to March."

1061
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:52,299
Jane! Control yourself!

1062
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,890
Children, please sit up properly.

1063
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,607
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Thank you, dear.

1064
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,901
I'm having fun.

1065
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,321
I wish you could always stay here.

1066
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,366
We'll have to. There's no way down.

1067
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,694
Oh, there is a way.

1068
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:18,125
I hate mentioning it because
you must think of something sad.

1069
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,076
Do it, please.

1070
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,083
Let me see.

1071
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,585
I've got the very thing.

1072
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,714
Yesterday, when my neighbour
answered the bell, a man was there.

1073
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:36,093
The man said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."

1074
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:39,349
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.

1075
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,557
Then he said, "I'll replace your cat."

1076
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,019
She said,
"Okay, but can you catch mice?"

1077
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,529
I started out saying...

1078
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,906
I try.
Really, I do.

1079
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:58,489
But everything ends up so hilarious.
I can't...

1080
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,620
I can't help...

1081
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,664
That will be enough of that.

1082
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,125
It's time to go home.

1083
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,427
Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.

1084
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:14,802
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

1085
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,096
Come along, children.

1086
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,849
Must you really go?

1087
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:26,731
People come to see me all the time,
and we have such a lovely time.

1088
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:32,157
Then they go home,
and I'm very, very sad about it.

1089
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,825
Don't worry. 
We'll return soon.

1090
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,902
It was lovely.

1091
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,832
- Keep an eye on him, Bert.
- I'll stay a while.

1092
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,499
Thank you.

1093
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,794
Uncle Albert,

1094
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,591
I got a jolly joke I saved for 
just such an occasion.

1095
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:53,010
- Want to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.

1096
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,589
Righto. It's about me granddad.

1097
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,016
One night, he had a nightmare.

1098
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:03,062
So scared he chewed his pillow to bits.

1099
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,686
Next morning, I says,
"How do you feel?"

1100
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:09,439
He says, "A little down in the mouth."

1101
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,527
There's nothing like a good joke.

1102
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,740
No, and that's nothing like a good joke.

1103
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,973
Bit late tonight, aren't you?

1104
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,307
I say, Banks!

1105
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,729
Is anything the matter, Banks?

1106
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,647
Banks!

1107
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,192
We're so glad you're home!

1108
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,027
We had the most wonderful afternoon.

1109
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:04,741
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

1110
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,827
We don't know anyone 
called Smith.

1111
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:12,666
The second chap says,
"What's his other leg's name?"

1112
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,672
And a party on the ceiling.

1113
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,503
Children, be quiet.

1114
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,465
Mary Poppins says we'll go again.

1115
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:21,673
Oh?

1116
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,185
Oh, Mary Poppins said that?

1117
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,810
Please return to your room.

1118
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:31,563
Mary Poppins, will you come with me?

1119
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:33,360
As you wish.

1120
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:39,859
Mary Poppins, I regret what I must say.

1121
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,790
Good evening, George.
ls anything the matter?

1122
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,037
I'm afraid so.

1123
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,121
I have to dress for my rally.

1124
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:55,174
- I'd rather you be present.
- Of course, George.

01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:59,470
Mary Poppins,
I confess I'm disappointed in you.

1126
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,220
She's for it. I've heard this before.

1127
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,472
I don't deny I'm partially responsible

1128
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:10,273
for allowing
the children's worthless frivolity.

1129
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,146
But they must learn
the seriousness of life.

1130
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,444

1132
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,483
George, are you certain?

1133
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,159
I believe I am.

Good evening, gentlemen.

Yes, Father.

1776
02:06:05,725 --> 02:06:09,775
In 1773,
an official of this bank

1777
02:06:09,854 --> 02:06:12,323
unwisely loaned a large
sum of money

1778
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,363
to finance a shipment of tea

1779
02:06:14,442 --> 02:06:16,365

Do you know what happened?

1781
02:06:18,654 --> 02:06:22,830
I do.
As the ship lay in Boston Harbour,

1782

colonists dressed as Red Indians

1783

1784

and threw the tea overboard.

1785
02:06:30,958 --> 02:06:33,677
This made the tea
unsuitable for drinking,

1932
02:14:58,299 --> 02:15:01,678
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1933
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:05,139
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1934
02:15:05,264 --> 02:15:09,360
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

1935
02:15:11,478 --> 02:15:15,108
<i>When you send it ﬂying up there</i>

1936
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:18,577
<i>All at once you're lighter than air</i>

1937
02:15:18,652 --> 02:15:20,620
<i>You can dance on the breeze</i>

1938
02:15:20,696 --> 02:15:23,745
<i>Over houses and trees</i>

1939
02:15:23,866 --> 02:15:26,335
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

1940
02:15:27,244 --> 02:15:29,838
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

1941
02:15:29,913 --> 02:15:32,086
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1942
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:36,178
<i>Let's go ﬂy a kite</i>

1943
02:15:36,253 --> 02:15:39,553
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1944
02:15:39,632 --> 02:15:43,011
<i>Let's go ﬂy a kite</i>

1945
02:15:43,093 --> 02:15:46,438
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1946
02:15:46,513 --> 02:15:48,811
There you are, Banks.

1947
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:50,985
Congratulations.

1948
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:52,607
Capital bit of humour.

1949
02:15:52,728 --> 02:15:55,072
"Wooden leg named Smith,"

1950
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:57,445
or Jones, whatever it was.

1951
02:15:57,524 --> 02:15:58,901
Father died laughing.

1952
02:16:00,653 --> 02:16:02,280
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

1953
02:16:02,363 --> 02:16:05,492
Nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.

1954
02:16:05,616 --> 02:16:07,994
Never seen him happier.

1955
02:16:08,077 --> 02:16:10,250
He left an opening for a new partner.

1956
02:16:10,454 --> 02:16:12,582
Congratulations.

1957
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:16,260
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

1958

<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1959

<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1960
02:16:23,133 --> 02:16:27,183
<i>Oh, let's go</i>

1961
02:16:28,097 --> 02:16:29,144
<i>Fly a kite</i>

1962
02:16:31,767 --> 02:16:34,691
Awk! 
That's gratitude for you.

1963
02:16:34,812 --> 02:16:36,860
Didn't even say goodbye.

1964
02:16:36,939 --> 02:16:38,236
No, they didn't.

1965
02:16:38,357 --> 02:16:39,825
Look at them.

1966
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:44,280
They think more
of their father than of you.

1967
02:16:44,363 --> 02:16:46,536
That's as it should be.

1968
02:16:46,615 --> 02:16:48,913
Don't you care?

1969
02:16:48,992 --> 02:16:51,370
Practically perfect people
never permit sentiment

1970
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:52,955
to muddle their thinking.

1971
02:16:53,038 --> 02:16:54,711
Is that so?

1972
02:16:54,790 --> 02:16:58,385
Mary Poppins, you don't fool me.

1973
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,552
Really?

1974
02:16:59,628 --> 02:17:03,178
Really. I know how you feel.

1975
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:07,262
If you think
I'm keeping my mouth shut...

1976
02:17:07,886 --> 02:17:11,356
That will be quite enough, thank you.

1977
02:17:33,537 --> 02:17:35,255
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.

1978
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:36,673
Don't stay away too long.

1979
