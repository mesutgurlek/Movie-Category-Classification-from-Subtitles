00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,537
Mylene ain't seeing no <i>Star Wars.</i>

158
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,333
And tell Zeke not to waste his breath
'cause my girl got big plans.

159
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,711
Her life's about to change.
She gonna turn him down flat.

160
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,547
Mylene, can I tell you something?

161
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,424
When you sing, it's like...

162
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,594
how red velvet feel.
That's how you sing.

163
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,764
Like how butterscotch taste.

164
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,184
Warmed up though,
like how they serve it sometimes?

165
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,562
You sounded like that.

166
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,564
You're tender, like...

167
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,526
like crying tears tender.

168
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,446
And at the end,
right there at the finale...

169
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,118
Damn, holy shit.
Your roar is a motherfucker, girl.

170
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,246
Yeah, you talk good.

171
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,624
Ain't talk when it's true.

172
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,051
God. I'm sorry.

173
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,053
We don't do this no more.

174
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,263
But we could.

175
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,141
-No.
-But it's not like we do it all the time.

176
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,183
Or ever, really.

177
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,270
<i>-Ay, bendito,</i> don't be difficult.
-But--

178
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,565
What are you doing tonight, for real?
We can go see <i>Star Wars </i>together. Hey.

179
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,983
I want you to be my girl.

180
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,777
No. I got plans.

181
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,947
-What you talking about?
-Okay. Can you keep a secret?

182
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,824
Yeah.

183
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:57,370
Okay, so tonight, Regina's getting me
and the girls into Les Inferno.

184
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,122
Les Inferno? Are you crazy?

185
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,374
- Gangsters be there and shit!
- Shut up.

186
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,793
I'm sleeping at Yolanda's
'cause it's easier to sneak out.

187
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,420
DJ Malibu is spinning there tonight.

188
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,715
There's a dance competition. The winner
gets to have dinner with Malibu.

189
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,592
That's what the tape's for.
I'm gonna win the dance-off,

190
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,136
get him the tape
so he can listen to it and say:

191
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,430
"Shit,
she's the next Donna Summer."

192
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,515
And then sign me to his label.

193
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,808
That is so stupid.

194
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,226
Okay, I'll tell her.

195
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,145
- You're stupid.
- Mylene!

196
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,190
<i>Ven aqui! </i>Daddy wants to see you.

197
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,610
I told him you were singing devil music
and he said--

198
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,404
Thy voice shall only be lifted
to the glory of God.

199
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,574
But, <i>Papi</i>, Ezekiel and I were just
preparing for Sunday's service.

200
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,409
-Okay?
-Sorry, I--

201
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,661
Should I ask Ezekiel
which hymn you were singing?

202
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,871
That's not what your sister told me.

203
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,040
This is the last time you do this.

204
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,126
What you gonna do?
Sucker.

205
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,255
Your sister said that you made a tape
singing that dirty Donna Summer's music?

206
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,883
Actually, Dad, it's Misty Holloway.

207
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,177
- So, it was disco?
- Mylene!

208
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,553
Yo, Ra.

209
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,099
- You are in my church!
- Bye, Mylene.

210
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,391
Straighten out or get out of my house.

211
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,769
Get the fuck out.

212
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,355
-Yo, Zeke! Still ain't getting none?
-Mind your own.

213
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,816
I thought you was smart?
It ain't never gonna happen!

214
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,402
You are grounded again.

215
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,363
You will not be sleeping
at Yolanda's tonight.

216
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,740
<i>-Papi!</i>
-Looks ugly this time, man.

217
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,326
Be home by 10, go to your room
and study the word of God.

218
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,577
What?

219
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,664
Mama, <i>por favor,</i> you promised me
I could stay at Yolanda's tonight.

220
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,667
Please, don't provoke him.
Your father's word is final.

221
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,003
-10 p.m.
-You always take his side, man!

222
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,588
Go!

223
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,885
- Yo, what's got you down, girl?
- God!

224
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,513
-Yo, did you ask her?
-Man, I tried.

225
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,098
What? What you mean, you tried?

226
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,434
My dad's tripping, man.
He's not gonna let me go out tonight.

227
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,104
That means I won't be able
to get my tape to DJ Malibu.

228
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,356
She's dead set
on going to Les Inferno tonight.

229
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,399
Les Inferno?

230
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,443
-Yeah.
-Man, that's an epic turn of events, bro!

231
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,903
You gotta get in with a lady.

232
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,697
Those Holy Rollers go to bed early.

233
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,533
We'll wait till your parents are asleep
and then we'll sneak you out.

234
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,161
You'll be back before
anybody knows anything.

See, Shaolin was in the yards,
and saw the dude hot one-ten,

244
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,283
and so he karate-chopped his ass.
Waa-taa!

245
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,873
And that's how the war started.

246
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,542
- How do you know? You talk to Shao?
- Dude, shut up.

247
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,045
No one's ever even seen Shao,
let alone talked to him.

248
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,213
It's not a war they're fighting.

249
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,467
But for all of us.
When we see our names on these trains,

250
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,679
if only even for a fleeting moment,
we can say: "I was here."

251
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,183
Crash, you paint spotlights
and Bat-signals.

252
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,601
Daze, you paint constellations,

253
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,228
breadcrumb trails of sparks
that tell a story.

254
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,605
Shao 007,

255
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,731
<i>man...</i>

256
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,777
<i>his Pumas are always pristine.</i>

00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,237
<i>His hands are samurai swords.</i>

258
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,407
And his pieces, they're all fireworks.

259
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,035
Big, bright, explosive.

260
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,788
Have you seen Shao's latest?

261
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,291
"Clan of the Dragon Fist."

262
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,670
Wait.

263
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,588
Shaolin Fantastic has a new piece?

264
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,050
-I gotta check it. Where's it at?
-The rubble fields, by Charlotte Street.

265
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,677
- I'm out of here.
- You crazy!

266
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,221
- You're going now?
- Savage Warlords territory, you can't--

267
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,139
A life lived in fear is a life half-lived.

<i>Mayor Beame is in bad trouble.</i>

<i> But underdog candidate</i>

<i>Graffiti and crime plague our streets.</i>

<i>Poverty pimps like Francisco Cruz</i>

<i>with your tax dollars</i>

<i>while claiming to provide services</i>
<i>to his people.</i>

<i>Ed Koch for mayor.</i>
<i>Tough, competent, tireless and fair!</i>

"Poverty pimp,"?

290
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,000
He gets elected,
your whole operation here goes away.

291
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,918
No one will do more for you
than the mayor can.

292
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,005
Koch is a loser.
I'll help Beame get elected,

293
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:03,176
but if your boss wants votes, he's gotta
help me build something special.

294
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,012
Looks like the goddamned Taj Mahal.

295
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,889
The Charlotte Street Taj Mahal.

296
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,600
You tell the mayor
he has a very simple choice.

297
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,351
Lose the election...

298
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,272
or fund my vision.

299
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,111
So, in order to meet with Malibu,

300
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,405
Mylene gonna have to dance
in a contest at Les Inferno?

301

All the hustlers up there.

302
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,785
-She gonna fuck around and get turned out.
-Not Mylene.

303
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,786
She ain't like that.

304

305
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,581

00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,384
A new piece on Charlotte Street.
Clan of the Dragon Fist.

310
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,636
But that's Savage Warlords territory!

311
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,057
But it's Shaolin Fantastic.
So, take a deep breath and follow!

312
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,148
Come on.

313
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,461
Shaolin Fantastic, man.

314
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,588
Clan of the Dragon Fist.

315
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,843
Dizz, it's a master blaster.
Yo, tonight, we go to the yards.

316
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,553
You gotta let your hero know you exist.

317
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,432
Not so loud, Boo.

318
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,183
I feel like we're being watched, y'all.

319
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,019
Probably by Shaolin.

320
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,647
I think I seen Shaolin Fantastic
the other day.

321
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,857
No way.

322
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,276
Up on the roof. Flying.

323
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,946
Right there. Roof to roof.

324
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,907
- You see his face?
- No, but I saw the red Pumas.

325
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,535
I heard Shaolin's so slick,
he snuck into Yankee Stadium

326
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,163
and stole Chambliss'
walk-off home run bat.

327
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,747
He fearless, man.

328
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,750
You gotta be
to live in Savage Warlord territory.

329
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,420
-Dizz, man.
-What's up, Boo?

330
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,090
You afraid of Warlords?
I ain't afraid of no stupid Warlords.

331
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,218
Seriously, though,
can we please go now?

332
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,763
Fuck y'all doing on our turf, punks?

333
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,642
We writers, little man, not gangsters.

334
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,145
All we find, all we keep.

335
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,146
Y'all got money?

336
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,648
I said all we find, all we fucking keep!

337
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,818
-Who the fuck y'all looking at?
-Little nigga, let me talk to you.

338
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,528
-Don't touch me.
-Hey, hey!

339
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,323
Boo!

340
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,908
Hey, Boo. Hey, get back, stop!

341
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,535
Savage Warlords are gonna
beat your ass, fuckers!

342
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,453
Get the hell off me!

343
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,163
- Leave my fucking brother alone!
- Get off me.

344
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,373
After I smash his ugly face.

345
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,751
Napoleon!
We told you to fucking look out

346
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,629
and you taking these fools off
for their lunch money?

347
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,630
Yo, bounce.

348
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,676
The fuck's wrong with you?

349
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,763
You begged to be our lookout
at Les Inferno tonight,

350
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,641
-but you can't handle the responsibility!
<i>-Oye, oye, oye.</i>

351
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,852
-Savage Warlords, be on your way.
-Yo, it's Papa Fuerte!

352
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,188
- Everybody else, to school!
- Come on.

353
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,564
Let's go!

354
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,900
<i>Pa fuera de la calle. Fuera de la calle.</i>

355
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,652
- Yo!
- Run! Run!

356
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,947
Anybody wants some static,
still be there by the time I count three.

357
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,449
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

358
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,867
Ha!

359
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,663
<i>Que pendejo.</i>

360
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,374
He reminds me of me.

361
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,002
Come on, Stanley, join the party.

362
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,130
"Clan of the Dragora Fist."

363
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,466
I can never make heads or tails
of this graffiti shit.

364
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,884
I'll tell you what, Stanley.

365
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:36,097
You bring me art classes, art supplies,
and art teachers for our schools here,

366
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,056
and I promise you,

367
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,684
this right here is gonna be
hanging at the MoMA,

368
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,895
not on the side of some
burnt-out buildings or the five train.

369
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,147
Look at that.
Landlord's paying these gangs

370
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,858
to burn buildings
to collect the insurance money.

371
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,153
I got an epidemic on my hands here,
but I gotta hear it

372
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:55,449
from the fire chief over at Engine 71
that you closed two more firehouses?

373
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,536
I'm down four fucking firehouses
in the last nine months here, Stan.

374
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,538
-The mayor knows he owes you.
-Fuck the mayor!

375
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,502
Listen up. I know some of y'all are gonna

376
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,089
want to make some money this summer,
so remember, Francisco Cruz is offering

377
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,009
paying summer jobs and internships.

378
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,844
Make sure you visit his center,

379
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,473
tell him Ms. Green sent you. I want you
to live with confidence this summer, okay?

380
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,769
Okay, settle down!

381
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,647
Settle down! We are not done yet.

382
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,733
And I got plenty of detention slips

383
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,610
if y'all want to keep acting a fool.

384
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,403
Now, as promised,

385
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:37,033
it is time for me to announce the winner
of the poetry writing contest.

386
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,661
Imani, please sit.

387
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,039
The winner for the best poem is...

388
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,709
Ezekiel Figuero.

389
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,003
- Aww.
- Everybody applaud. Come on.

390
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,631
My God.

391
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,299
-Faggot!
-Hey.

392
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,092
Faggot.

393
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,761
All right, that's enough, quiet down.

394
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,554
- Brainiac bitch.
- Okay, Ezekiel.

395
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,266
Come on up and get your prize
and recite your poem.

396
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,269
...I can't. I hurt my back.

397
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,980
Is that right? That's fine.

398
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,024
I'll come to you.

399
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,192
Ooh!

400
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,281
-Thanks, Ms. Green.
-"Thanks, Ms. Green."

401
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,617
Mock him again
and I'm going Lady Macbeth on your ass!

402
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,494
- Fuck you.
- Ooh!

403
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,121
I'd like for you to read your poem,
Ezekiel.

404
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,247
Yeah, I'd rather not.

405
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,291
Why not?

406
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,879
Because, I didn't write it.

407
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,549
I copied it from a book. That's all.
Here's your candy back. I'm sorry.

408
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,467
Why you lying?

409
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,179
Whoo! We outta here.

410
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,597
Ezekiel Figuero...

411
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,975
- we need to talk. Okay, everybody.
- Meet me by the flagpole.

412
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,520
Have a great summer.
I'm going to miss you.

413
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,273
- You're my favorite teacher.
- Have a good one. Take some good pictures.

414
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,277
You know, Ezekiel really did write
that poem. Unfortunately, you know,

415
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,364
he's not manly enough
to stand up and admit it.

416
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,074
-Mylene.
-Zeke.

417
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,033
Come on.

418
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,120
Have a great summer, Ms. Green.

419
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,913
-You have a great summer, baby.
-Okay.

420
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,634
Look out onto that vista there, Stanley.

421
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,720
Tell me what you see.

422
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,680
I see a national disgrace.

423
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,974
I see something beautiful, Stan.

424
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,643
I see houses.
Like that model in my office.

425
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,813
Not projects that were built to segregate
and warehouse the working poor.

426
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,023
I see homes, Stan.

427
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,359
Homes for my rainbow people.

428
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,991
I see ball fields for the kids.
A library, right over there.

429
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,744
<i> Full of kids nourishing</i>
<i>their intellectual curiosity.</i>

430
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:48,748
Prepping for internships,
colleges and good jobs. And over there,

431
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,375
<i>what the hell, a man-made lake.</i>
<i>With ducks, Stan.</i>

432
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:56,046
I see a proud community. And I see
my contractors building that lake

433
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,715
and constructing these homes.

434
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,885
I see a new South Bronx,
an attainable future for my people.

435
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,888
-That's a hell of a dream, Cisco.
-No, it's not a dream, Stanley.

436
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,390
Your mayor sucks.
Everybody knows it.

437
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,892
In your own words,

438
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,771
he's desperate for me to deliver
20,000 new voters for the primary, right?

439
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,023
- Twenty-five.
- Well, I'm gonna deliver 50,

440
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:14,982
you keep the change.

441
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,942
<i>Mira,</i> I did the research, Stan.

442
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,029
And those houses are gonna cost
at least ten million.

443
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,740
And your midget mayor,
he's gonna pick up the tab.

444
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,992
-Ten million don't--
-If the mayor wants my loyalty

445
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,161
and my votes and the blood of my people,

446
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,539
then that ten million comes directly
right the fuck here!

447
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,793
I'll make it happen. Okay? You happy?

448
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,463
I'm always happy, Stan.
Sadness is for suckers.

449
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,590
Come on, we'll get an egg cream.

450
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,813
But, Ms. Green, your poetry contest

451
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,023
was poetry writing, not poetry reciting.

452
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,399
So, you did write it.

453
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,986
-I didn't say that.
-I don't know why it is, Ezekiel,

454
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,491
that you seem to want to be nothing,
when with just a little courage...

455
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,743
you could really be something.

456
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,994
I got courage.

457
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,204
No, you don't.

458
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,414
Leaders lead.

459
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,542
Cowards cower.

460
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,129
Now I understand
that your poem is personal.

461
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:24,009
I understand that it might make you
feel uncomfortable to share it.

462
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,178
But take a look around.

463
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,013
The Bronx is a war zone.

464
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,434
Our community is dying.

465
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,062
And it's gonna take leaders to save it.

466
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,147
That means you.

467
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:45,531
That is why I have been trying
to get you to stand up

468
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,616
and share your gift with the class.

469
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,995
But every time, you take the easy way out.

470
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,914
Well, luckily for you, I'm probably
not gonna be in school next year.

471
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,341
How would your mother and father feel
if they were alive?

472
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,553
To hear you talking like that?

473
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,889
You live with your aunt and her boyfriend,
right?

474
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:14,727
Do you think that they took on the burden
of raising you

475
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,645
just so you could drop out of school?

476
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,025
Be dead,
be in jail by the time you turn 21?

477
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,652
-I don't know.
-You don't know.

478
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,114
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you really didn't write this poem.

479
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,115
I wrote it.

480
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,410
Then prove it.

481
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:54,308
<i>Boom, then crash</i>
<i>The shattering of glass</i>

482
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,187
<i>I dived to the floor</i>
<i>Busted my ass</i>

483
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,650
<i>"What the hell was that?"</i>
<i>Was all that I said</i>

484
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,612
<i>Then I seen a pool of blood</i>

485
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,364
<i>Then I see my moms was dead</i>

486
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,076
<i>No emotion in the commotion</i>
<i>I wasn't even sad</i>

487
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,745
<i>Even when I learned</i>
<i>That the bullet was meant for my dad</i>

488
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,457
<i>Vietnam made Pops crazy</i>
<i>He was already half-dead</i>

489
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,126
<i>So, why couldn't that have been him</i>
<i>That they shot in the head?</i>

490
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,796
<i>All the news that fits the print</i>

491
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,008
<i>Mama's death went unreported</i>
<i>Not a whiff, word or hint</i>

492
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,054
<i>"They don't care about us niggas"</i>
<i>Is how my pops explained it</i>

493
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,099
<i>But I didn't know I was a nigga</i>
<i>Until my dad proclaimed it</i>

494
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,102
<i>Six months later</i>
<i>My pops was dead, too</i>

495
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,106
<i>Drug-related shots fired</i>
<i>His skin turned cold blue</i>

496
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,275
<i>On the news that night</i>
<i>The president's wife got a new hairdo</i>

497
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,820
<i>The news guy said</i>
<i>"I like it. How about you?"</i>

498
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,448
<i>No word about my pops</i>
<i>In the </i>Post <i>or on CBS</i>

499
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,034
<i>Why was that, you ask?</i>

500
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,577
<i>Take a fucking guess</i>

501
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:01,625
<i>And, yeah, why is that?</i>
<i>Is what politicians should be asking</i>

502
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,586
<i>But who's got time for questions</i>
<i>When y'all skiing up on Aspen?</i>

503
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,756
<i>Bronx get gunshots to the head</i>
<i>And all y'all swerving us is Aspirin</i>

504
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,426
<i>My mama was so lovely</i>
<i>She would have made your head spin</i>

505
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,011
<i>Level the playing field</i>
<i>And y'all would see who would really win</i>

506
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,471
<i>And, yeah, I got anger</i>

507
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,225
<i>But I don't let it take me down</i>
<i>Because my mama taught me better</i>

508
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,144
<i>And she holds me up when I fall down</i>

509
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,064
<i>Rest in peace, Moms</i>

510
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,108
<i>Don't worry about your son</i>

511
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,989
<i>Someday I'll make you proud</i>
<i>Because, yeah, I am the one</i>

512
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,076
Ezekiel...

513
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,956
there are opportunities out there
for your advancement.

514
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,083
Francisco Cruz, he...

515
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,724
<i>♪ Step out in the limelight... ♪</i>

516
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,896
What if Malibu will only listen to
your tape if you get down with him?

517
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,022
What you gonna do then?

518
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,356
Listen, he's not like that.

519
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,234
My God, Mylene.
You don't know nothing about the world.

520
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,905
So, you hit her with the poetry
and she still said no? That's cold.

521
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,741
I don't know, man.
I'm trying everything I got, Ra.

522
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,327
Well, listen, man.
Mylene's looking for a man.

523
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,996
Dress slick, right? Act smooth.

524
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,915
Savoir faire, man.

525
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,627
These are men, Mylene.
Look, it's different.

526
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,130
Like, last time I was there,
I met this dude, Little Wolf.

527
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,257
He's Cadillac's main man,

528
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,010
and I mean, he was so fine,

529
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,807
and like, he had gap!
I'm talking about g-money like this!

530
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,810
Took me to a high post hotel and stuff.

531
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,311
Howard Johnson's is high post?

532
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,730
Well, they had
good room service and champagne.

533
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,650
Listen, I'm gonna give you some advice.

534
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,486
You let Malibu take you to the hotel.

535
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,403
Shit.

536
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:57,533
You sing a sexy song for him
in your lingerie and shit.

537
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,327
Shake your little <i>culo.</i>

538
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,578
<i> Culo?</i>

539
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,247
That's how you get a record deal.

540
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,082
Fucking Howard Johnson, Ra?

541
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,544
You need to calm down, first of all.
Both of y'all need to calm down.

542
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,046
Fuck! You're right, Ra.
We gotta get into Les Inferno.

543
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,297
Stop.

544
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,591
you can't sweat a freak, man.

545
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,719
I'm not planning on getting down
with nobody, all right?

546
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,264
-You have to show up looking fly.
-Yeah.

547
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,975
-With the suave bolla. Okay?
-Suave-- Okay.

548
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,394
I just wanna meet DJ Malibu
and give him my tape,

549
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,604
so I can get out of my father's church
and never look back.

550
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,482
-That's it.
-You have to get her something. A gift.

551
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,400
Okay.

552
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,360
Not expensive
because you ain't got no money.

553
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,154
But, you know, something that says:

554
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,156
"I know you, girl.

555
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:44,997
I know you deep into your Taino
Puerto Rican punany, <i>mamasita.</i>"

556
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,498
Don't talk about her like that.

557
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,418
Look, number one:
you need to be there to dance with her.

558
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,588
you need to be dangerous.

559
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:53,839
Okay.

560
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,633
Any dude that messes with her
gotta get the hammer.

561
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,261
Bang, bang. It's over.

562
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,014
Where the hell would I cop a gun?
It's a stupid idea.

563
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,473
-Stupid.
-Look, man.

564
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,684
The gun's a personal choice.

565
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,245
That Clan of the Dragon Fist piece
was fly.

566
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,123
But let it be your last,
and focus, Grasshopper.

567
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,959
Tonight your quest will end
and your journey will begin

568
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,086
if you bring me back the Pakoussa.

569
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,589
The Pakoussa? By Misty Holloway?

570
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,009
-Where is it?
-The Jamaican on Charlotte Street.

571
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,637
Protected by the Warlords, so watch out.

572
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,264
Bring me back the Pakoussa, Grasshopper.

573
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,016
Osu.

574
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,773
And Grasshopper!

575
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,943
Have you found yourself a wordsmith yet?

576
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,402
Not yet.

577
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,447
Then you must learn
to trust and choose wisely.

578
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,658
You're well-liked but always alone.

579
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,118
The journey requires a wordsmith.

580
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,038
Bring me the Pakoussa by midnight,
Grasshopper.

581
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,001
Whoo!

582
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,588
The gift.

583
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,258
It's a must-have,
and it's gotta be personal.

584
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,175
So, what's she like?

585
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,761
-Perfume? Clothes?
-That "Far, Far Away" joint.

586
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,846
-Misty Holloway?
-The remix, by Carlo Pakoussa.

587
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,599
She crazy for it. Plus, it's rare.
I heard they only made like 50 copies.

588
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,685
That Jamaican's spot
on Charlotte Street got rare stuff.

589
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,812
Boom! Get that shit.

590
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,272
- Get in the club.
- Yeah.

591
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,189
Get the DJ to play it.

592
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,524
-Okay. Yeah.
-Right?

593
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,817
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

594
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,735
Then you take her in your arms.

595
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,447
You sweep her up,
and you dance a sexy hustle.

596

Yo, not so loud.

690
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,923

you can't be dancing

691
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,133
in this contest at Les Inferno
by yourself.

692
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,260
Maybe we could dance together.

693
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,846

702
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,671
Now, what do you do if Shaolin Fantastic
appears in the train yards?

703
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,172
- Run.
- Good.

704
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,675
'Cause Shao'll pull your pants down

Yo, Zeke ain't gonna get into
Les Inferno by himself, you know?

708
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,688
I just hope he doesn't keep asking me
'cause I can't, like, reject him again.

709
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,273
- Mylene.
- Poor Zeke.

710
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,943
-I feel bad for your man.
-Yolanda, Zeke is my friend.

711
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,530
-Not my man, okay?
-That means I could go out with him?

712
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,657
- I didn't say that.
- 'Cause you like him.

713
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,576
-Let's just figure out what I'm wearing.
-Yeah!

714
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,120
Now, if you do have to run
from Shaolin, remember,

715
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,747
what rail do you watch out for?

716
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,832
Duh. The third rail.

717
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,877

'cause he got a 7-inch weenie.

718
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,170

Thanks for getting me and the girls out.

1277
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,873
Yeah. No doubt.

1278
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:45,293
- That was--
- Horrible. I know.

1279
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,425
I just want to go to bed.

1280
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:56,221
But... I should give this to you.

1281
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,349
No, that's-- That's for you.
I got that for you.

1282
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,600
I don't want it.

1283
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,436
But it's-- You love it.

1284
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,022
-It's your favorite.
-Zeke, we're not-- We're not dating.

1285
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:09,067
-We're not a couple.
-Let's start. Let's make it official.

1286
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,569
-Zeke--
-I wanna be your man, Mylene.

1287
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,112
I know you like me.

1288
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,158
And I like you so much,
I can't hardly breathe.

1289
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:21,204
I like you so much, I feel like I got
thunder and lightning inside of me.

1290
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,206
You make me nervous.

1291
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:25,208
But you also make me calm.

1292
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:26,876
Real calm.

1293
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:31,798
Calm almost like how God must be calm,
you know, Mylene? Calm from loving.

1294
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,384
I love you.

1295
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,263
Mylene, I love you.

1296
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:41,766
What do you think about that?

1297
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:47,772
Okay, look. I don't mean
to be conceited or nothing.

1298
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,607
You know I'm not like that anyway.

1299
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:51,901
But if you see how you're
looking at me now,

1300
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,737
that ain't the look of someone
who don't like someone.

1301
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:55,655
So, come on.

1302
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,617
What do you say??

1303
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:08,751
No.

1304
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:12,380
No. Because I'm gonna be a singer, Zeke,

1305
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:15,091
-I'm gonna be a disco star.
-I know you will. I know.

1306
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,260
And someday soon,
I'm gonna cross that East River,

1307
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,013
and I can't let anybody
distract me from that.

1308
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,973
-I won't distract you.
-Yes, you will.

1309
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:25,768
And it's sad because you are so gifted.

1310
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:29,022
You're so smart
and you just mess around with it.

1311
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,525
Like today in class when you were supposed
to stand up and do that poem.

1312
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,861
You say you want me,

1313
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:38,114
but you don't know
what it is that you want. But I do.

1314
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:42,493
And even if I was gonna be with somebody,
which I'm not,

1315
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:46,372
I'm gonna be with a man
that has goals and has a plan.

1316
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,374
Not a kid from the neighborhood.

1317
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,585
Not a boy. Not you.

1318
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,379
-Mylene--
-Not now.

1319
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:54,631
If you give it a chance--

1320
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:57,091
I don't love you, Zeke. I don't love you.

1321
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,015
And it's quits.

1322
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,144
Mylene.

1323
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,084
"Even in the darkness,
there is light, for God is gracious,

1324
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,293
and tells us,

1325
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:36,673
'Ye be kind to one another,
tender hearted, forgiving for one another,

1326
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,425
as God in Christ forgave you.'"

1327
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,803
<i>Dios mío.</i> What are you wearing?

1328
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:42,929

1329
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,013

1330
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:45,723

<i>-¡Tranquilo nada!</i>
-Ramon!

1332
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,563
Have any idea what time it is?
Your mother almost died.

1333
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,357
-I'm sorry.
<i>-Casi me da un </i>heart attack.

1334
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,274
Look at yourself.

1335
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:56,943
Look at you. Our own daughter.

1336
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,277
A teenage whore.

1337
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,904
-Ramon!
-<i>Puta</i>, Lydia.

1338
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,407
I went out with my friends
to listen to music.

1339
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,200
I didn't drink, I didn't smoke--

1340
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,160
-You didn't drink? You didn't drink?
-No.

1341
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:07,370
-No, no.
-You didn't smoke? No?

1342
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,831
<i>Mentirosa.</i> Again, you are a liar.

1343
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,959
I may have had one drink
and a cigarette, <i>pero</i> Mami,

1344
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,502
-that's what teenagers do.
-Ramon!

1345
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,546
-No, not my teenager. Not you.
-Ramon, <i>por favor.</i>

1346
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:17,839
No "Ramon"! And this?

1347
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:21,217
You want to be like Misty Holloway?
What is this disco garbage?

1348
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,301
It's poison.

1349
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,888
You are not this. You will never be this.

1350
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,516
Do you understand me?
You'll never be this. Never be this!

1351
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,143
-You went through my things?
-Yes!

1352
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,978
I will not tolerate blasphemy.

1353
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,938
You will not associate with garbage.

1354
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:36,482
You will not sing disco,
and from now on,

1355
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,359
you will never leave this house. Ever.

1356
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,194
I will sing, <i>Papi</i>.
And you cannot stop me.

1357
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:41,654
I can't stop you?

1358
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:42,905
-No!
-I'll show you how I stop you.

1359
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,824
- Ramon!
- I'll show how I stop you!

1360
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,617
- I will beat the evil out of you.
- Ramon!

1361
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,954
I'll beat it out of you!
You are my darling angel.

1362
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,539
I will beat you all night

1363
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,708
- to separate from you and <i>El Diablo!</i>
- No!

1364
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,002
-No, Ramon! Ramon! Stop it.
-No! You cannot.

1365
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,795
- No!
- No, no!

1366
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,964
Let her go! No! No!

1367
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,048
Lydia!

1368
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,176
Go to your uncle!

1369
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:05,470
I...

1370
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,101
We were in the studio,
finishing up the rhythm track.

1371
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,227
I'm producing.

1372
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,771
We're this close. We're so close.

1373
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,106
And right outside the door,
good old Hector,

1374
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,859
he's got like,
five chicks that wanna blow him,

1375
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,068
-three dope dealers.
-No.

1376
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:23,362
Now that your luck's gone bad,
you're telling stories.

1377
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,157
I wanna do one more overdub
because I'm a perfectionist.

1378
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,992
There's a reason I got three Grammys.

1379
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,329
- <i>¿Qué?</i>
<i>- I need to talk to my uncle.</i>

1380
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:33,706
<i>¿Qué te pasa? Pero dime que te pasó.</i>

1381
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,291
How much is the music producer in for?

1382
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:38,085
- Mylene, calm down, please.
- He's down 25 large.

1383
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,212
<i>La sobrina.</i>

1384
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,050
<i>¿Nena?</i>

1385
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,053
And she's right. I ain't shit.

1386
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,306
I ain't ever gonna be shit.
She has no business being with me.

1387
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,184
I just-- I'll probably--

1388
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:58,648
I'll probably end up working in a fucking
supermarket my whole fucking life!

1389
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:03,778
Can you fill us in with anything
about Les Inferno? The shoot-out?

1390
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,279
My heart got shot out.

1391
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:06,823
My fucking heart got shot out.

1392
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,750
Yo, osu, wordsmith.

1393
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:18,835
Who the fuck is that?

1394
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,802
Some wild, wild west shit back there.

1395
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,388
This motherfucker
with the fake karate and shit.

1396
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,225
Now what did I do?

1397
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,563
I got you in.

1398
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:41,357
I got Malibu, who's dead,
to play the record,

1399
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,110
which in fact is the last record
that he'll ever play.

1400
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,153
While motherfuckers shooting
from both sides,

1401
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,155
while your stupid ass is trying
to get the record

1402
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,992
off of Malibu's turntables,
all for a bitch

1403
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,035
-who thinks she's better than you.
-Don't call her a bitch.

1404
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,287
A motherfucking bitch!

1405
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,914
-Don't call her a bitch!
-Sit your ass down.

1406
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:57,999
Yo, you got the gift.

1407
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,877
But you look like a bitch
crying over a bitch.

1408
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,839
I don't understand all the crying
over a female.

1409
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,132
You don't know. You don't know.

1410
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,175
I don't know? I don't know? About what?

1411
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,721
-Not about to say "love," are you?
-What if I did?

1412
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:15,099
Then I say you're fucking right,
I don't understand anything about love.

1413
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:17,310
Who is this dude, man?

1414
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,186
- Yeah, who the fuck is this dude?
- Yo,

1415
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,480
- who you getting loud with, shortstop?
- Hey.

1416
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:24,775
-You, nigga.
-Aww, little munchkin.

1417
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:26,235
Hey, man. We're all cool.

1418
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:27,862
We're all cool.

1419
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:28,988
Let me see this.

1420
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,075
I write, maybe y'all seen me up.

1421
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,336
- Whoa.
- No!

1422
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,087
- No!
- Get the fuck outta here.

1423
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,213
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1424
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,674
You're Shaolin Fantastic?

1425
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,134
The lady-killing romantic.

1426
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,344
Hell, no.

1427
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,763
Yo, Zeke. Is this really him?

1428
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,848
I don't know. I just met the dude.

1429
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,558
Hey, man. Just look at his shoes.

1430
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,853
Bro, this little guy--
This is my brother, Boo-Boo.

1431
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,313
And that's my other brother, Ra-Ra.

1432
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:03,856
Do you know who I am?

1433
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:10,947
Rumi 411.

1434
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,032
You stay up with Crash and Daze.

1435
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,368
You also down with the Soul Artists?

1436
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:16,786
I spray all-city.

1437
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,704
Yo, where's my record at, man?

1438
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,040
-You like Misty Holloway that much?
-Where's my record?!

1439
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,876
Here's your fucking record.
Here. Go fetch.

1440
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,299
Why do you need the record?

1441
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:31,717
It's for the get down.

1442
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,220
What's the get down?

1443
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:38,099
You don't know what the get down is?

1444
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:41,644
You're a natural, and you don't know
who Grandmaster Flash is?

1445
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,063
Shit. All right, punks.

1446
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,691
Y'all want to go to the flyest...

1447
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,069
secret underground party
in the entire Bronx...

1448
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:51,612
you follow me.

1449
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:53,489
You decide.

1450
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:57,576
Let's go.

1451
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,462
- Yo.
- Shao. What's up?

1452
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,339
They with me, all right? All of them.

1453
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:19,974
Yo!

1454
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:25,730
Aseke.

1455
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,072
Hey!

1456
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,077
My God.

1457
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,417
Ra, this is crazy cool.

1458
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,425
B-boy hard rocks in here.

1459
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,010
They don't like outsiders.

1460
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:57,553
Like, they really don't play, man.

1461
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,472
Y'all gotta pretend like y'all know
what's what.

1462
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,851
Why y'all look so scared, man? Come on.

1463
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,269
Yo, Shaolin!

All right. All right. I'm impressed.

1476
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,726
But have you found your wordsmith yet?

1477
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,105
I think I found him tonight.
So, can you teach me how to DJ now?

1478
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,191
I'm ready right now, Grandmaster.
Just show me the magic.

1479
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,485
Tomorrow we begin. But tonight?

1480
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,070
We party.

1481
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:00,199
Whoo!

1482
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:12,878
Whoo!

1483
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:18,634
The Grandmaster pinpoints
the get down part.

1484
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,762
Sometimes the drums only play
for ten seconds,

1485
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,849
and the rest of the record
is violins and singing and shit.

1486
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:29,145
He won't play that bullshit,
so he plays the same record on two decks.

1487
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,774
While the get down plays on one,
he cues the same part on two.

1488
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,737
Now, I don't know how he knows
exactly when to do it,

1489
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:41,699
but the moment one finishes,
bang, he flips the mixer...

1490
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,826
the beat goes on and on.

1491
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,830
The beat goes on, the wordsmith can go on.

1492
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,875
Man, what the fuck is the wordsmith?

1493
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:54,670

Fat Annie's?

1528
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:19,630
And then they shot him. In front of me.

1529
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,882
- They shot up the whole place.
- What--

01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:49,955
Will you sign my book?

1687
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,832
I'll do one better.

1688
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,584
I'm retiring from my writing.

1689
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:57,754
Gonna be a full-time DJ.

1690
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:00,924
So, all my stuff downstairs...

1691
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:03,385
it's all you, Rumi.

1692
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:06,263
For real?

1693
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:07,764
For real.

1694
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:09,391
Thanks.

1695
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:12,519
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Huddle up, fellas, huddle up.

1696
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:13,979
Huddle around. Let's do it.

1697
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,732
I'm about to introduce you
to the three kingdoms.

1698
01:27:17,441 --> 01:27:21,319
Okay? We got the west.
There's the land of DJ Kool Herc.

1699
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:24,239
-Who's Kool Herc?
-If you don't know who Kool Herc is,

1700
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,699
you need to ask somebody.

1701
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,367
Well, I am asking somebody.

1702
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:33,790
Let's just say
he has the biggest sound in the Bronx.

1703
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,168
Over here are his rivals.

1704
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,504
Bambaataa and the Zulus.

1705
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,673
And who's right here?

1706
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,550
- We are.
- Yeah, well...

1707
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:46,720
Right now, right here...

1708
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:50,390
and will always forever be the land...

1709
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:51,975
the kingdom...

1710
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:54,436
of Grandmaster Flash.

1711
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,482
Yeah, but what about our kingdom?

1712
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,776
Well...

1713
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:01,902
that's a good question.

1714
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,406
Y'all want your own kingdom,
or you wanna...

1715
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,950
be peasants in someone else's kingdom?

1716
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,035
We want our own kingdom.

1717
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:14,915
Then so it shall be.

1718
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,126
Stick with me and we'll run shit.

1719
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,587
We'll be musical kings.

1720
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:22,464
Fantastic Four Plus One.

1721
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,091
Running shit
from Hunts Point to Riverdale.

1722
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,760
Large and in charge.

1723
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:29,513
Yeah.

1724
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:31,348
Train!

1725
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:32,849
Shit.

1726
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:34,768
- Shit!
- My God.

1727
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,561
- That's us, Boo.
- Shit!

1728
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:37,646
That's our train!

1729
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,356
That's the train!

1730
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:40,899
All-city, yo!

1731
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:46,613
All-city!

1732
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,074
Get a better angle, get a better angle!

1733
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,077
- Check this out.
- Hey, yo.

1734
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,495
Think we could run the Bronx?

1735
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:55,121
What?

1736
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:59,835
You and me, the Jackson Five
Kipling brothers over there...

1737
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:03,380
I don't know who can fuck with us.

1738
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:06,550
Plus, you're a natural wordsmith, man.

1739
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:07,467
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1740
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,220
You a natural everything.

1741
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:16,226
Yo, we gonna be bigger than Les Inferno.

1742
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,270
We gonna be bigger than...

1743
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:20,272
the Yankee Stadium.

1744
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:23,024
We gonna be bigger
than the whole fucking Bronx.

1745
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,693
We gonna be bigger than the world.

1746
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,576
There you go. We broke night.

Respect the--

Hey. Hands off everything, munchkin.

01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:08,103
Yo. Everybody, gather around.
Gather around.

1640
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,939
This is the Aladdin's Cave.

1641
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:14,318
No one else has seen this before.

1642
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:15,902
Shit. We must be special.

1643
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:20,907
- You ready?
- Yeah!

1644
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,200

1645

Bung! Doo-doo!

1646
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,204
Bung!

1647
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,290
Ba-dow!

1648
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:29,666
Shit!

1649
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,127
This is my lifetime collection, man.

1650
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:33,754
Alphabetized and everything.

1651
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,130
Yo, Shao, man.

1652
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,798
This is where you stay at?

1653
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,717
You know,
other than staying at my girl's crib.

1654
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,553
That's where I keep my custom AJ Lesters.

1655
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:42,929
- Custom?
- Hoo-hoo!

1656
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:44,056
He said custom?

1657
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,558
Yo, so how do you rig up the electric?

1658
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:47,768
You wired it yourself?

1659
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:50,187
-Magic. Says who?
-No such thing.

1660
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,147
Boo! Be careful, man!

1661
01:25:53,357 --> 01:25:55,692
How the fuck do you brush your teeth?

1662
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,570
Yo, the city ain't cut off
the water in the building yet.

1663
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:01,365
- Shit, there is water. He ain't lying.
- Man.

1664
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:03,700
If I knew Flash's secret,

1665
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:06,536
-I could extend the get down right here.
-This-- This--

1666
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,705
This is def, man. This shit's def.

1667
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,165
Yo, yo. Yo, Shao.

1668
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:11,375
-Yo.
-The sun's coming up.

1669
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,668
I can't see the train here.

1670
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,628
-Can we get on the roof?
-Let's hit the roof.

1671
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,004
To the roof!

1672
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:17,547
All right. Let's do it.

1673
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,591
- Yo, yo, yo.
- All-city.

1674
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,426
I'm the king of New York.

1675
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:25,764
- Heads up.
- Snap.

1676
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,642
Stick with me, little man.
I'll teach you how to fly. Hoo!

1677
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,477
-Yo, Zeke.
-Yeah, bro?

1678
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:32,354
Tonight was pretty dope, right?

1679
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:33,522
Yeah, bro. Yeah.

1680
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,941
Shaolin Fantastic, he's kind of cool?

1681
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:36,942
Yeah, he is.

1682
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,946
Hey, hey. Brah, brah, come on.
You're cool, too.

1683
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:44,950
-Don't you wanna see Dizzee's burner?
-Last one up eats a dick.

1684
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:46,493
Hey, fuck you!

1685
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,787
- Motherfucker.
- Hey, Shao.

1686
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:49,955
Will you sign my book?

1687
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,832
I'll do one better.

1688
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,584
I'm retiring from my writing.

1689
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:57,754
Gonna be a full-time DJ.

1690
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:00,924
So, all my stuff downstairs...

1691
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:03,385
it's all you, Rumi.

1692
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:06,263
For real?

1693
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:07,764
For real.

1694
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:09,391
Thanks.

1695
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:12,519
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Huddle up, fellas, huddle up.

1696
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:13,979
Huddle around. Let's do it.

1697
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,732
I'm about to introduce you
to the three kingdoms.

1698
01:27:17,441 --> 01:27:21,319
Okay? We got the west.
There's the land of DJ Kool Herc.

1699
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:24,239
-Who's Kool Herc?
-If you don't know who Kool Herc is,

1700
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,699
