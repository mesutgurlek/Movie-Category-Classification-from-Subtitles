1
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,529
Here comes the sugar man.
This'll make the last payment on my car.

2
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:32,006
Yeah, but it's all worn out.

3
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:34,509
Where you been all this time?

4
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,907
Hartwell.

5
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:41,814
Donegan.

6
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:43,477
Yoo-hoo!

7
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,889
Man, give me that fortune.

8
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,118
What are you gonna do
with all that money?

9
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,288
I'm gonna buy a herd of chorus girls
and make 'em dance on my bed.

10
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,768
Ninety-five, a hundred...

11
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:02,361
five, six...

12
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:05,202
seven... a hundred and eight dollars.

13
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,936
Good week, Vince.

14
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,208
You ready?

15
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,712
Yeah.

16
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:20,345
Vince likes that kind of punishment.
Someday he's gonna learn.

17
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,228
Okay, drinks are on me.

18
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:36,295
That's the kind of athletic contest
I appreciate. He's game, that boy.

19
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,340
I'll get you next week.

20
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,501
You bet, Vince.

21
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,174
Buy me a drink, cowboy?

22
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,047
- You're buyin', aren't you?
- Jake, draw one for the lady.

23
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:52,645
- I'll take a shot, if you can afford it.
- I can afford it.

24
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,561
I saw you here last week
cashing your check.

25
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:02,496
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, you got nice hair.

26
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,191
I get through work around 4:00.

27
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,295
- Why, you two-bit little tramp!
- Hey!

28
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:13,398
She didn't mean anything.
I bought a round for the house.

29
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:15,467
- Keep outta this.
- She wasn't outta line.

30
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:19,572
- I said, keep your mouth outta this.
- Leave her alone.

31
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:23,551
Look, buster. You want some teeth
knocked out, just keep it up.

32
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,689
You scare me.
Woman beaters always scare me.

33
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:27,087
You scare me.
Woman beaters always scare me.

34
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:30,853
Why don't you run along, sonny,
before I muss up your hair?

35
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,679
Vince, he's had enough!
He's had enough!

36
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,895
Hey, kid, you can hit.

37
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:14,030
Somebody call a doctor.
This guy's hurt bad.

38
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:23,208
You've been found guilty by a jury of
your peers of the crime of manslaughter.

39
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:26,581
You're hereby remanded to
the custody of the sheriff...

40
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,913
and you'll be transported
to the state penitentiary...

41
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:32,944
to serve a term of not less than one,
nor more than ten years of imprisonment.

42
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,526
Court dismissed.

43
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:51,797
A tough woodchuck, huh?

44
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,207
Well, that's what we're here for,
to teach you hooligans.

45
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:58,714
It says here you killed a man
with your bare hands.

46
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,409
We don't use hands here.
We use guns.

47
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:06,183
I'll tell you another thing we use for
cons who don't toe the mark: The whip.

48
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,689
- Understand?
- Yes.

49
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,282
Sir!

50
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,055
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,591
I'm puttin' you in with
Hunk Houghton, an old-timer.

52
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:24,596
- All right, that's all.
- Thank you, sir.

53
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,750
When do I finish my processing?

54
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:42,222
No hurry.
You got plenty of time.

55
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,709
Hang it up.

56
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,315
- Put it up where you got it.
- Sure.

57
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:17,757
Didn't know you're
touchy about it.

58
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:20,421
I live here.
I'm touchy about everything.

59
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,232
You're on my bunk.

60
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,642
Is this okay?

61
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,340
- My name's Vince Everett.
- You know my name.

62
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,612
Glad to know you.

63
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,119
Yeah.

64
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,256
- You're not through processing.
- Not yet.

65
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,259
- What about your haircut?
- What about it?

66
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,261
You want a good one
or a fresh fish special?

67
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,422
- A fresh fish...
- A fresh fish special.

68
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,457
They hack it up. A good one will
cost you three packs of cigarettes.

69
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,469
I haven't got three packs.

70
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:04,028
- You got any money?
- Nope. Spent it all on my lawyer.

71
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:12,407
I'll loan you three packs,
you pay back four.

72
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,480
Kind of silly savin' up
cigarettes like that.

73
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:22,747
You'll learn.

74
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:47,075
Okay, tell me about
the cigarettes.

75
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,884
I run a business, sonny.

76
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:53,012
I'm what you might call
one of the top cons in this stir.

77
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,956
I got representatives in the
tailor shop, commissary, sick bay...

78
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:58,289
kitchen and shoe shop,
and they all work for me.

79
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:02,354
You want a good haircut? I fix it.
A good pair of shoes? You ask me.

80
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:04,865
Like everything else,
you gotta pay for it.

81
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:06,902
This here is
the coin of the realm.

82
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:08,527
Where do you get cigarettes?

83
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:11,630
You trade with guys who don't smoke,
you buy 'em, you steal 'em...

84
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:13,800
just like you did
for money on the outside.

85
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:17,039
I'm broke. I'll never
accumulate any cigarettes.

86
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:20,776
The state pays you 18 cents a day.
That's a start.

87
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,718
- Play ball with me, and I'll stake you.
- That's real nice of you.

88
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:27,779
I can't have my cell mate
lookin' like a bum.

89
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:30,018
I got a reputation
to live up to.

90
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,652
- You been assigned a job yet?
- Not yet.

91
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:36,994
You'll probably draw the coal yard.
It's hard and it's dirty.

92
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:41,435
Maybe I can get you out of it, get you
assigned to the print shop where I am.

93
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:43,495
How many packs?

94
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:46,406
Five cartons of cigarettes.
I'll loan 'em to you.

95
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,409
At what interest rate?

96
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:50,809
You're learnin' fast.

97
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,611
The interest rate won't be too high.
You just do what I say when I say it.

98
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,244
That's the basis
of my organization.

99
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,851
- No, thanks.
- Huh?

100
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:05,894
I'll take my chances.

101
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,226
Suit yourself.

102
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,789
- Thanks anyway, though.
- It's no skin off my behind.

103
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:24,812
Hey, guard,
how about a water call?

104
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,974
One water call every two hours.
You oughta know the rules by now.

105
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,280
- In this heat?
- Get back to work.

106
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,220
That new warden, the jerk!

107
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:37,351
Ever since he come here,
this can ain't fit to live in.

108
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:42,663
- Hey, Houghton!
- I hear you callin'.

109
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:45,826
What are we gonna do about conditions?
I've had a bellyful.

110
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:49,667
I got less than a deuce to go.
I'm gonna suffer my little heart out.

111
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,241
- Not me. I'm gonna do somethin'.
- What a lousy dump!

112
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:52,502
- Not me. I'm gonna do somethin'.
- What a lousy dump!

113
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:55,169
I'd better quiet
those steers down.

114
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:10,082
I'm up in the mornin'
with the risin' sun

115
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,220
I work like a slave
'til the day is done

116
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:18,427
Just workin' and sleepin'
and nothin' more

117
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:22,733
And every day is just
like the day before

118
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:26,741
One more day

119
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,836
One more day

120
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:35,043
One day older
and nearer to my Lord

121
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:39,076
One more day

122
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:42,818
Listen to the prayer
of a lonely man

123
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:47,295
Livin' day to day
the best he can

124
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:50,992
Give me the strength
to carry my load

125
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,595
Glory waits for me
at the end of the road

126
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:59,698
One more day

127
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:03,768
One more day

128
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:09,546
One day older
and nearer to my Lord

129
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:15,454
One more day

130
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:22,559
That's mighty pretty, Hunk.
Give us another.

131
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:28,727
Thanks a lot, neighbors.

132
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:32,262
Appearin' before you has given me
a big hunk of pleasure.

133
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:35,970
I hope to be around pickin' and
singin' for you again real soon.

134
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,280
Whereabouts did you learn
to sing like that?

135
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:42,613
That used to be my trade,
sonny buck.

136
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:45,882
I was singin' country music
before the words were invented.

137
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,391
I was on the stage with the best of 'em:
Eddy Arnold, Roy Acuff.

138
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,483
Did you make good money?

139
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,961
I made two bills a week.
I was swimmin' in gravy in those days.

140
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:57,364
Get on to the sad part.

141
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,668
A woman and a bank did it.

142
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:05,138
She got used to bonded bourbon,
I robbed a bank.

143
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:07,334
I thought you were
makin' 200 a week?

144
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:10,803
Booking's got a little thin.

145
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:16,542
- You made all that money just singin'?
- Why not?

146
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:22,119
Mind if I horse around with it?

147
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,790
Don't break any strings.

148
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,764
I can sing better than you.

149
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,993
Naturally.

150
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,264
I used to have an uncle
that had one of these things.

151
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,067
I fooled around with it some.

152
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,175
Here's one of his songs.

153
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,506
Here's one of his songs.

154
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:45,275
You're so young

155
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,010
And beautiful

156
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:56,149
And I love you so

157
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,960
Your lips so red

158
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,990
Your eyes that shine

159
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:14,004
Shame the stars that glow

160
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:16,806
So feel

161
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:23,341
These lonely arms of mine

162
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:30,018
And kiss me tenderly

163
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,892
Then you'll be

164
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:40,664
Forever young

165
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:46,868
And beautiful to me

166
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:56,651
Like my singin'?

167
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,449
You don't know one thing
about the guitar.

168
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:01,956
The boarders liked it.

169
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:04,993
They're what you might call
a captive audience.

170
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,221
Here, let me show you
a few chords.

171
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,130
That's a C-major chord.
That's a big one.

172
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:25,139
Now try the G.

173
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:37,189
You will never make a guitar player.
You got no rhythm in your bones.

174
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,717
Well, I never heard of anybody
payin' money to hear a guitar player.

175
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,957
Don't pay any attention to me.

176
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:45,865
I was only in the business
for ten years, that's all.

177
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:49,029
Yeah. I read you,
loud and clear.

178
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,696
Try it again.

179
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:04,210
Vince, take a water break.

180
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,850
Hey, screw,
I'm gonna get some water.

181
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,727
We're gonna have
a prisoners' show.

182
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,461
A committee from the state legislature
is comin' to investigate.

183
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:22,436
The warden wants to throw up
a smoke screen.

184
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,438
He's all heart, that warden.

185
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,441
- Who do you think's producin' the show?
- You.

186
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,999
Who told you?

187
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,643
I got a spot for you in the show.
I'll teach you a new tune.

188
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:36,242
I don't know. What's the percentage
in singin' for a bunch of cons?

189
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:39,879
Experience, you lunkhead.
That's the percentage.

190
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:42,890
- I'll consider it.
- Fine. You do that.

191
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,917
While you're about it, consider the fact
this show is goin' on national TV.

192
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:50,557
- You're kiddin'.
- No. It's called "Breadth of a Nation."

193
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:52,567
I guess they figure we got color.

194
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,933
I considered. I'm on.

195
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,336
What do you think's prettier?
Red or blue?

196
00:15:57,406 --> 00:16:00,398
- Red or blue what?
- Color for a convertible.

197
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:01,909
Geez!

198
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:05,708
You guests of the state
are gonna be mighty sorry...

199
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:08,215
this next boy's a short-termer...

200
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,619
'cause he sure sings pretty.

201
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,354
Let's hear it for Vince Everett!

202
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:27,202
There's no joy in my heart

203
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:30,727
Only sorrow

204
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:36,005
And I'm sad as a man can be

205
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:41,112
I sit alone in the darkness

206
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:44,516
Of my lonely room

207
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:49,546
And this room
is a prison to me

208
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:54,129
I look out my window

209
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:57,723
And what do I see

210
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,894
I see a bird

211
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:03,699
Way up in a tree

212
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,003
- I wanna be free
- Oh, yes

213
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:08,600
- Free
- Oh, yes

214
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:10,975
Free

215
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:13,037
I wanna be free

216
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,107
Like the bird in the tree

217
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:17,675
Wanna be free

218
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:20,586
Hurry up, fellas.
I gotta count my fan mail.

219
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,185
Vince Everett.

220
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,983
Hey, you birds, come here.

221
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,592
How'd you like to make
five cartons apiece?

222
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,390
Five? Who do you
want us to murder?

223
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:05,866
It's the easiest money you'll ever make.
Just keep your mouth shut.

224
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:07,959
I mean, about the mail.

225
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:11,301
I made a mistake. I gave the kid
the best spot in the show.

226
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:14,740
If word gets out all this mail's for
Vince Everett, it makes me look bad.

227
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,507
Follow? I mean me,
the professional singer.

228
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,378
I, uh... I see.

229
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,011
If within a week the word's not around,
you get the cigarettes.

230
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:28,454
Yeah, but it's Everett's mail.
Who's gonna keep him quiet?

231
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,320
If I know the warden,
Everett will never get it.

232
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:39,164
We'd be a natural together.
Both ex-cons.

233
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:41,964
The publicity
would be sensational.

234
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,470
Look.

235
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,102
You get out in six months.

236
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,336
I follow you 12 months later.

237
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,244
- What do you say, boy?
- You mean we sing together?

238
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,043
Together, alone,
it makes no difference.

239
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:56,880
We hire a couple of other acts,
we got our own show.

240
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,045
We play the circuit
and we roll.

241
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,055
I don't know anything
about gettin' bookings...

242
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:04,388
Let me worry about
the business end.

243
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:05,892
Here.

244
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,194
I've made a contract for us.
We split everything down the middle.

245
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:15,202
Sit down here a minute.

246
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,231
Come on, boy, sit down here.

247
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:21,909
Sign right there.

248
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:29,211
How come you're willing to
give me 50% of your earnings?

249
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:33,516
I mean, like you said, you're the one
that's got the experience and the name.

250
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,116
One simple reason:
I got faith in your possibilities.

251
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,422
You're never gonna
command the dough I can...

252
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,758
but with training,
you'll do all right.

253
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,664
Besides, I need a young man
to appeal to the kids.

254
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,827
I'm levelin' with you, boy.

255
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,804
Alone, son...

256
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:57,641
you'd be like a lamb
in a pack of wolves.

257
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,637
Go ahead.

258
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:16,822
I wouldn't feed this garbage
to a razorback hog.

259
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:19,891
I thought that investigatin' committee
was gonna fix things up here.

260
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,664
Investigatin' committee.
What do those jerks see?

261
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:24,899
What the warden
wants 'em to see!

262
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,235
Slop.

263
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,297
Slop!

264
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,483
Come on!
Let's get back to the cell!

265
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:49,129
Come on. Back to your cell!

266
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,249
All right.

267
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,348
One.

268
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:14,684
Two.

269
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:17,090
Three.

270
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,222
Four.

271
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:21,455
Five.

272
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:49,423
I didn't have money enough
to buy the grease.

273
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:53,621
- The price was 300. I didn't have it.
- I wish you did.

274
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:57,631
It's a lesson to remember.
Without money, you may as well be dead.

275
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,703
That's all the sympathy I'll give you.
Pity's a commodity in here.

276
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,468
You buy it and sell it
just like anything else.

277
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,271
What are you, man?
Some kind of an animal?

278
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:12,313
That's right, buddy.

279
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm an animal in a jungle,
and I got a motto:

280
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,744
"Do unto others as they would
do unto you, only do it first."

281
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,452
That's right.

282
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:30,326
Do it first.

283
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,902
And it's just as bad
on the outside.

284
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,403
Worse.

285
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,796
Remember that.

286
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,968
I don't aim to forget it.

287
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,142
Everett, you ready?

288
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:20,343
Drop in on us when you're
in this part of the country.

289
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:24,112
- Glad to put you up for the night.
- Just go away, screw!

290
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:26,450
I wanna say good-bye
to my friend.

291
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,922
See you in about ten months.

292
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,390
That's right, boy.
Together we'll knock 'em over.

293
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,553
The name of the joint
is the Florita.

294
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:37,291
I wrote a letter to Sam Brewster,
the owner, an old buddy of mine.

295
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:40,596
- I'm positive he'll give you a job.
- Okay. See you.

296
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,136
Take it easy.

297
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,604
Here's what the state
owes you: $54.

298
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,374
Do I owe income taxes?

299
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:55,678
Don't give me any sass, bub,
and get outta here.

300
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,809
I'll try not to break down.

301
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:00,921
Oh, wait a minute.

302
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,718
- Here's something belongs to you.
- What's this?

303
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:10,287
Letters you got
after that television show.

304
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,299
You're a real star, Everett.

305
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,461
- How come I didn't see these before?
- 'Cause I didn't want you to.

306
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,028
That's against the law,
keepin' mail from an inmate.

307
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:22,008
Have me arrested.
Now get out, and don't come back.

308
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:25,745
You've been just like
a father to me, Warden.

309
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:29,115
Sir!

310
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,753
I'll send a woman up
to make the bed directly.

311
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:49,894
What do you want?

312
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:52,906
It's custom to tip a man
when he brings you to your room.

313
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:55,841
Well, I'm startin'
a new custom: No tip.

314
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:58,712
No law against tryin'.

315
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:25,268
"Dear Vince, I saw you on television
today singing from the jail...

316
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,433
"and I thought you looked real cool.

317
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:31,639
"My name is Marijane Hamilton, and
I'm 15 with blue eyes and brown hair.

318
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:34,546
"My measurements are 33-25-36.

319
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,551
"Do you think I should reduce?
Ha-ha.

320
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,077
"If you come to Riverport, how about
giving me a blast on the phone?

321
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:44,284
"My number is Lockwood 4357."

322
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,828
Where's the nearest pawnshop?

323
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:57,804
Down the street to the right,
a couple of blocks.

324
00:25:57,872 --> 00:26:01,205
What you gonna do?
Buy yourself a diamond ring?

325
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:05,144
No. I'm gonna buy a guitar
and sing love songs to you.

326
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:18,453
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Peggy.

327
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:20,016
- Shorty.
- Hi, Peggy.

328
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,999
- How's your boy doin'?
- Large. He's on top.

329
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:07,940
"Crying to the Stars"
got 84 plays.

330
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:10,603
Yeah? I'm sick of it.

331
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,113
Now watch your tongue, Shorty.

332
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,322
Tell me what you see.

333
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,655
About 5'4", weight 115,
pretty well stacked.

334
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,594
- I'm glad you find me pleasing.
- I don't find you nothin'.

335
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,530
- Then why are you staring?
- I'm interested in the jukebox.

336
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,090
Well, I'm sorry.
I don't know about mechanics.

337
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:36,137
I don't either.

338
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:37,899
I'm a singer.

339
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:40,640
Indeed.

340
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:45,874
I saw you writin' down
some figures in your little book...

341
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:49,849
and I wondered what you were doing,
so don't get fancy ideas about yourself.

342
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,376
Oh, I see.

343
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,089
- Well, I'm afraid I misunderstood.
- I'm afraid you did.

344
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:03,095
If you buy me a fresh drink,
I'll tell you about the figures.

345
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:05,223
Buy your own drink.

346
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,428
Is yours the approved manner
with ladies in the backwoods?

347
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:11,495
- Just tell me about the figures.
- All right.

348
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:13,734
I'm an exploitation man
in the record business.

349
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:16,072
I work for Mickey Alba.
You've heard of him?

350
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:18,374
Word sometimes gets
to the backwoods, yeah.

351
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,507
Well, I plug his records with
disc jockeys, jukeboxes, stores.

352
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:25,348
- Oh, hello, Sam.
- Hello, kid.

353
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,547
This is Sam Brewster,
the cheerful owner.

354
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,817
Vince Everett.
Did you get Hunk Houghton's letter?

355
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:33,224
- So you want a job, huh?
- When do I go to work?

356
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,593
- Whenever you want.
- Tonight's good as any.

357
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:39,132
It's up to you.
Bring me a seltzer, will you?

358
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:43,899
Can those guys play
with me when I sing?

359
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,236
What do you mean, "sing"?

360
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,071
Sing! You said
I could start tonight.

361
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,169
As bar boy.

362
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:55,080
- Make setups, bring ice.
- Hunk said you'd give me a job singing.

363
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,846
What do you think I am,
a mental case?

364
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:00,648
This place is
no hobby, you know.

365
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:03,782
All I want is a chance,
Mr. Brewster.

366
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:06,486
Look, kid,
I'll save you some grief.

367
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:10,961
So Hunk taught you
a couple of songs? Swell.

368
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:13,762
Be the life of the
next party you go to...

369
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,668
but we don't have
opportunity night here.

370
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:21,500
Do you want the job
or don't you?

371
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:23,407
Bar boy.

372
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:25,742
I'll see you around, honey.

373
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:32,382
Hunk Houghton.
That name sounds familiar.

374
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:35,719
He's an old country music singer.
I met him in the penitentiary.

375
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:39,488
Make setups and bring ice.

376
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:52,065
Ladies and gentlemen...

377
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,702
I'm not a part of this show, so don't
encourage me or pay me any mind at all.

378
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:59,941
But the man that owns this place thinks
I can't sing, so I gotta prove it.

379
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:02,346
So you just go ahead
with whatever you're doin'.

380
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:06,217
It won't take long.
Do a chorus of "Young and Beautiful."

381
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:12,219
You're so young

382
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:16,992
And beautiful

383
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:21,695
And I love you so

384
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:25,666
Your lips are red

385
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,642
Your eyes that shine

386
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:34,704
Shame the stars that glow

387
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:39,412
Don't let me
interrupt you, mister.

388
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:41,182
I won't.

389
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:52,496
So fill these lonely arms of mine

390
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:57,766
And kiss me tenderly

391
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:06,011
Then you'll be forever young

392
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,245
And beautiful to me

393
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:31,965
Hey! You forgot something!

394
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,565
- What?
- Me.

395
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,906
That was quite
a temper tantrum back there.

396
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,412
That creep had it comin'.

397
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,712
Look. Why don't you get me
off the streets, huh?

398
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:45,446
I'm bushed.

399
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:48,954
She'll do 80 on a straightaway.

400
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:53,885
Come on, huh?

401
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:03,768
Do you always bust guitars
on talking customers?

402
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,636
- I wasn't that bad.
- Oh?

403
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:10,066
Do you think so?

404
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:13,642
Well, I didn't think
you were very good, Vince.

405
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:15,876
After listening to
Mickey Alba all day...

406
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,440
All right.

407
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:20,617
You tell me.

408
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,020
Why didn't they listen to you?

409
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:26,424
I don't know.
I'm no worse than a lot of 'em.

410
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:29,055
And no better.

411
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:34,296
Okay, you're used to the top talent.
Why waste your time working me over?

412
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:37,337
I like the way
you swing a guitar.

413
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,342
I guess I did get a lot of
wrist action into it, didn't I?

414
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,811
Well, that's all she wrote.

415
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,716
My musical career started
and ended with one song.

416
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:55,012
I don't know why...

417
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:57,751
not until you've given
yourself every chance.

418
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:00,953
But if they won't listen to me,
I can't hold a gun on 'em.

419
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:03,327
Did you ever listen to yourself?

420
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,923
How can I listen to myself
when I'm singing?

421
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,298
Make a tape recording.

422
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:11,634
Maybe when you hear yourself,
you can discover what's wrong.

423
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,770
How much does it cost?

424
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:20,037
About $20 for the
recording studio, I think.

425
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:24,217
I haven't got a guitar.

426
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:26,617
I'll borrow one for you.

427
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:28,622
Can't hurt anything.

428
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:43,526
- I'm sorry I'm late, Vince.
- Just don't pay attention to my nerves.

429
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,937
- I brought you some background.
- Who's gonna pay 'em?

430
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,533
It's on the house.
Have you picked a tune?

431
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,669
Yeah. Sit down, fellas.

432
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:56,674
Let's see if you know this one.

433
00:33:57,885 --> 00:34:01,446
Don't leave me now

434
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,352
Now that I need you

435
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,297
Okay, I'm ready
as I'll ever be.

436
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,136
Stand by, please.

437
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:19,673
Everett demonstration
number one, take one.

438
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:21,732
One, two, three.

439
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,912
Don't leave me now

440
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:43,053
Now that I need you

441
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:48,933
How blue and lonely I'd be

442
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:53,303
If you should say we're through

443
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:59,278
Don't break my heart

444
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:04,676
This heart that loves you

445
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:06,310
Man, it's awful.

446
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:09,989
Do I sound like that?

447
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:15,221
If you should leave me now

448
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:23,097
What good is dreamin'

449
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:26,106
I guess I owe that guy
at the Florita a couple of drinks.

450
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:27,607
It's a nice tune, though.

451
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:30,439
There's nothing wrong with the tune.
It's the way I'm doing it.

452
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:31,978
How do you mean?

453
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,675
I sound like
a million other singers.

454
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,878
- Then sing it differently.
- Like how?

455
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:42,218
Like how you feel it.
Put your own emotions into the song.

456
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,019
Make it fit you.

457
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,922
Make it fit you.

458
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:50,156
Well, the first thing
is that guitar.

459
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,496
It's tough tryin'
to find the chords.

460
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,469
- I just won't use it.
- Nobody cares.

461
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:59,028
- Okay, fellas, let's do it again.
- Good.

462
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:05,274
Burn me up this time. Let's see
if we can get a little fire in it.

463
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,876
- Try it again, sir.
- All right. Stand by.

464
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:13,221
Everett demonstration
number two, take one.

465
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:13,619
Everett demonstration
number two, take one.

466
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:29,193
Don't leave me now

467
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,171
Don't leave me now

468
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,371
- Now that I need you
- Oooh

469
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:42,644
How blue and lonely I'd be

470
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:47,877
If you should say we're through

471
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,889
Don't say we're through

472
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,983
Don't break my heart

473
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,029
Don't break my heart

474
00:36:56,097 --> 00:37:01,729
This heart that loves you

475
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:07,707
There'd just be nothin' for me

476
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:11,711
If you should leave me now

477
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:13,872
Don't leave me now

478
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:19,750
What good is dreamin'

479
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,551
If I must dream all alone

480
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,592
By myself

481
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,189
Without you, darlin'

482
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:35,027
- What do you think?
- I think it's wonderful.

483
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,036
- Good enough for a record?
- It sure is.

484
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:39,470
- Then let's go ahead.
- With a record?

485
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,838
Why not?
How do you go about it?

486
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:43,706
It isn't that easy, Vince.

487
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:46,474
You have to go to a record company
and sell 'em on the idea.

488
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:50,347
Let's do it. You know the business,
and I want to cash in on some loot.

489
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:53,553
Well, I don't know.

490
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:57,390
We might try Geneva Records.

491
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,892
What can they do?
Send me back to the pen?

492
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:19,442
- Thanks, Peg, for lettin' me hear it.
- I think he's got a distinctive style.

493
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:22,311
Everybody's got
a distinctive style these days.

494
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,875
I'd like to hear someone
sing a song straight for a change.

495
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:28,581
But you know they're going
for the new sounds, Jack.

496
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:32,786
I wish I could help you with it,
but you know our program this year.

497
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,054
No experiments.

498
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:37,188
We're sticking with
the established record sellers.

499
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:43,198
Well, I guess we'll have
to let MGM Records have it.

500
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,034
- I wish you luck.
- Thanks anyway, Jack.

501
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:47,699
Let's get outta here.

502
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:50,209
I'll tell you what.

503
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:55,248
Leave the tape with me. I'll play it
over the phone to D.L. in New York.

504
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:58,079
That's the best I can do.

505
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:00,552
That'd be wonderful, Jack.
Thank you.

506
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:03,021
I don't promise you anything.

507
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,820
- It's nice to meet you, sonny.
- Likewise.

508
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,087
Pretty sharp cuff links.

509
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:13,224
I'm gonna have me
some like that someday.

510
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,134
Mickey Alba made me a present of these
when we gave him his eighth gold record.

511
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:20,002
Maybe someday you'll make me
the same kind of present.

512
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:22,702
That'd be nice.

513
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,904
- Good-bye, Jack.
- Bye, Peg.

514
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:37,383
- Hello?
- Hello, Vince.

515
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,325
- I'm afraid I have bad news.
- You saw Lease, huh?

516
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:43,762
He said the man in New York
didn't like the tape.

517
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:46,163
What do we do now?

518
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:49,168
- Keep on trying other labels, I guess.
- Okay, you do that.

519
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,935
I'll meet you at that
same restaurant about 7:00.

520
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,407
Okay. Good-bye.

521
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,845
Hi.

522
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:07,214
You've kept me waiting
20 minutes.

523
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:10,155
- I've been sleepin'. You eat yet?
- Certainly not.

524
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:13,921
Don't you know the meaning
of the word "courtesy"?

525
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:17,157
We don't use it much
in the backwoods. Let's eat.

526
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:20,723
You might at least ask me
what happened this afternoon.

527
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:24,259
- What happened this afternoon?
- I sold your record, that's all.

528
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,772
Swell. I could tear
into a good steak.

529
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,242
Would it hurt you just to say
that you're happy about it?

530
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:31,869
It wouldn't be easy.

531
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:34,540
When the money starts rolling in,
then I'll say I'm happy.

532
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,082
Who'd you make the deal with?

533
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:45,648
- Deltona.
- Never heard of 'em.

534
00:40:47,394 --> 00:40:50,056
It's fairly new.

535
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:54,067
They're crazy about it, Vince.
They say they're gonna push it hard.

536
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,397
Great.

537
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,664
Let's celebrate, huh, Vince?

538
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:01,173
We'll have a bottle of wine
and a nice meal...

539
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:04,803
and then after dinner we'll drive out
and see my father and mother.

540
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,508
- I didn't know you had parents.
- They didn't win me on a quiz show.

541
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:13,051
You like burgundy?
Goes great with steak.

542
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:17,914
I like anything that goes
with steak. I'm broke.

543
00:41:19,627 --> 00:41:22,061
If it's all right with you,
I'll pay for the meal.

544
00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:24,954
You will if we eat.

545
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:26,522
Hey, waitress.

546
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,705
It's a real crazy pad.
What does your old man do for a livin'?

547
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,717
He's a professor
at Bertrand College.

548
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:57,955
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, daddy.

549
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:01,729
- I'd like you to meet Vince Everett.
- Welcome, young man.

550
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:04,532
Mother, this is Mr. Everett,
the singer Peggy's been working with.

551
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,300
- How do you do?
- Can I fix you a drink?

552
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:08,933
- No, thank you.
- Scotch? Bourbon?

553
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:11,375
- You got any beer?
- Coming up.

554
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,573
We're very pleased to see you.
Peggy's told us about you.

555
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:17,116
She hasn't told me
anything about you.

556
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:19,618
I hear you sold
your first record today.

557
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:23,619
You seem to hear
everything about me, huh?

558
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,884
How long have you been
in the music business?

559
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,327
- About a week.
- I see.

560
00:42:29,396 --> 00:42:32,422
There you are, sir.
And what did you do before that?

561
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:35,835
- Peggy didn't tell you?
- No.

562
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:39,361
- Mr. Everett was in the penitentiary.
- Is that so?

563
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,308
- What was the rap?
- One to ten. I did 14 months.

564
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:46,369
August, why don't you put on
that new record by Stubby Rightmire?

565
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:49,143
I'm sure Mr. Everett's
interested in jazz music.

566
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:51,343
- It's his profession.
- Righto.

567
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:54,615
Will you excuse me?
I have to fix the sandwiches.

568
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:58,054
That bomb kind of
laid an egg, didn't it?

569
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:01,561
- What bomb?
- About the penitentiary.

570
00:43:01,629 --> 00:43:04,655
I'm afraid the shock value
isn't worth very much.

571
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:18,038
I think Stubby's gone overboard
with those altered chords, don't you?

572
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:22,481
I think Brubeck and Desmond have gone
as far with dissonance as I care to go.

573
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:25,916
Oh, nonsense. Have you heard
Lenny Tristano's latest recording?

574
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:28,580
He reached outer space.

575
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:32,251
Someday they'll make the cycle
and get back to pure old Dixieland.

576
00:43:32,326 --> 00:43:36,820
I say atonality is just
a passing phase in jazz music.

577
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:38,728
What do you think,
Mr. Everett?

578
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,191
I don't know what the hell
you're talkin' about.

579
00:43:57,418 --> 00:44:00,182
You finally got your sensation.
I hope you're satisfied.

580
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:01,983
Get off my back.

581
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,355
You insulted my father, mother and me,
and it's just unforgivable!

582
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:07,986
I have a little beer,
first thing you know...

583
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,496
some old broad's
askin' me a stupid question.

584
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,691
They were trying to bring you
into the conversation.

585
00:44:12,766 --> 00:44:15,360
They can shove their conversation.
I'm not sure they were talkin' English.

586
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,233
- I'll drive you to your hotel.
- I'll walk.

587
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,642
I think I'm gonna just hate you.

588
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:29,782
You ain't gonna hate me.

589
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:33,486
I ain't gonna let you hate me.

590
00:44:37,825 --> 00:44:40,817
How dare you think such
cheap tactics would work with me.

591
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:53,131
That ain't tactics, honey.

592
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:55,402
That's just the beast in me.

593
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:18,262
Before we go in,
there's something I'd better say.

594
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:21,028
About the other night...

595
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:23,899
I guess I did get
out of line a foot or two.

596
00:45:25,272 --> 00:45:27,433
I got a pretty big mouth
sometimes...

597
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:30,500
so if you'll just tell
your old lady I said I'm...

598
00:45:30,577 --> 00:45:32,169
Sorry?

599
00:45:33,714 --> 00:45:35,477
Yeah. Come on.

600
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:42,248
May I help you?

601
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:45,416
Today's the release date for
"Don't Leave Me Now." Do you have it?

602
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,290
We sure do. The kids
are all crazy about it.

603
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:50,091
It's the greatest.

604
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,258
- I think I'll take a half a dozen.
- Yes, sir.

605
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,325
Did you hear that?
They're crazy about it.

606
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:59,133
- I'm gonna start off with a red one.
- A red what?

607
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:01,140
Convertible.

608
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:04,302
That'll be six dollars plus tax.

609
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:06,471
May I see those records, please?

610
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:12,685
What's the matter, Peg?

611
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,915
"'Don't Leave Me Now'
by Mickey Alba"?

612
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:19,754
Geneva Record Company.

613
00:46:20,794 --> 00:46:24,059
- I'm afraid I don't get it.
- I do.

614
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:26,565
- Which booth can we use?
- Any of them.

615
00:46:33,273 --> 00:46:34,968
Of all the low and filthy...

616
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,602
Peggy, tell me what's goin' on.

617
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:40,772
Don't leave me now

618
00:46:40,848 --> 00:46:43,840
Don't leave me now

619
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:48,752
Now that I need you

620
00:46:50,123 --> 00:46:52,785
How blue and lonely

621
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,090
That lousy thief.

622
00:46:55,162 --> 00:46:58,188
He stole my style,
my arrangement, my everything.

623
00:46:58,265 --> 00:47:00,324
Lease copied your tape
and gave it to him.

624
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,334
What about my record?

625
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:05,935
You can forget it.

626
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:07,906
It's gone.

627
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:11,000
- Miss...
- I'll see you later.

628
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,342
- Vince!
- I'll see you later, Peg.

629
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,716
Vince, where are you going?

630
00:47:16,783 --> 00:47:20,344
Sonny, you don't own that song.
It's published. Anyone can record it.

631
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,581
You turned it down.
You said you didn't like it.

632
00:47:22,656 --> 00:47:25,887
- We didn't want to record an unknown.
- What about my arrangement?

633
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:28,484
So see your lawyer.
You can't copyright an arrangement.

634
00:47:28,562 --> 00:47:30,689
- You're a thievin' rat!
- Listen to me, sonny.

635
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,392
Don't "sonny" me, you louse!

636
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:36,129
Crawl back under your rock,
you snake!

637
00:47:42,576 --> 00:47:43,838
Come in.

638
00:47:57,891 --> 00:48:00,086
- What did you do to him?
- Nothin'.

639
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,253
Just slapped him
a couple of times.

640
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,498
Isn't that dangerous?

641
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:07,898
I mean, he might have you
arrested or something.

642
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,459
Why are you scared?
It's not you.

643
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:15,137
I just don't want anything
to happen to you, that's all.

644
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:20,346
I'm terribly sorry, Vince.

645
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:23,747
Old Hunk Houghton told me
once back in the pen.

646
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,843
He said, "Watch out for the teeth,
sonny. It's a jungle."

647
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:30,549
Yeah, he had it taped.

648
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:34,458
On the inside, they're Cub Scouts
compared to Jack Lease.

649
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:37,497
If you make something,
they might steal it from you...

650
00:48:37,564 --> 00:48:41,000
but they'd be too honorable to go around
saying they made it themselves.

651
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:45,167
Yeah, it was
a pretty rotten thing.

652
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:50,099
Now that the crying's over...

653
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,407
I wanna make another record.

654
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,811
The same thing might
happen all over again.

655
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:56,508
You got no guts, Peggy.

656
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:59,518
So if they steal from you,
there's only one thing to do:

657
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:01,918
- Start your own record company.
- Your own company?

658
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:03,923
Certainly.
What's the mystery?

659
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:08,087
We can find out the details
from a lawyer or something.

660
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:10,152
You don't have to own a factory.

661
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,061
You contract for the pressings.

662
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:15,761
But you just don't go out and start
your own record company, just like that!

663
00:49:15,836 --> 00:49:17,804
Why not?
It's done every day.

664
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,339
We're just as smart
as those other birds.

665
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,006
Look, I make the decisions now.

666
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:26,568
I can't louse things up
any worse than you did.

667
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:36,015
Distribution.
Well, I know a little bit about it.

668
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:39,388
Sure you do. And exploitation.
That's your racket.

669
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:42,485
Look, we'll be partners.
We'll split things up 60-40.

670
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,759
- Sixty-forty?
- I'm the artist, don't forget.

671
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:46,924
Are you with me?

672
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:52,795
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

673
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,732
Well, I'll quit my job tomorrow.

674
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:00,113
My own record company.

675
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,205
I can smell the money already.

676
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:07,411
This really calls for a celebration,
doesn't it, Vince?

677
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,012
Do you know a lawyer?

678
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,523
Do you know how to dance?

679
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:15,459
We'll need a good one,
a guy with an eye to a buck.

680
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:17,622
Do you know a lawyer?

681
00:50:17,698 --> 00:50:19,791
Yeah, I know a lawyer.

682
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:23,495
Mr. Shores.
But he's a cold-blooded old fish.

683
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,902
Good. How's he fixed financially?

684
00:50:25,972 --> 00:50:28,600
They say he's got
the first dollar he ever earned.

685
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:30,905
Sounds like my man,
interested only in money.

686
00:50:32,746 --> 00:50:35,840
Is that all you're
interested in, Vince?

687
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:37,349
Well, what else?

688
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,344
Nothing.

689
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,854
Hey, when can we see
this Mr. Shores?

690
00:50:43,857 --> 00:50:46,291
Tonight, if you want to.

691
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:47,621
Good.

692
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:55,528
And incorporation papers
will cost you $100.

693
00:50:55,602 --> 00:50:57,092
We'll raise it.
What else?

694
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:01,201
Registering your trademark, $25.

695
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:04,143
Are you interested
in show business?

696
00:51:04,211 --> 00:51:06,145
Not in the slightest.

697
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:09,614
How would you like
to be my manager?

698
00:51:09,683 --> 00:51:13,585
I should want to first ascertain
what your earning potential will be.

699
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,016
We're real kinfolk, Mr. Shores.

700
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,650
Peggy and I are gonna earn
some money, and when we do...

701
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:22,160
we'll make another record,
and then we'll be in business.

702
00:51:22,229 --> 00:51:25,426
You know somethin'?
I'm gonna make you rich.

703
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,296
I'm already rich.

704
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:29,301
You'll be richer.
Good night.

705
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:31,599
- Thank you, Mr. Shores.
- You're welcome.

706
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:34,130
You got it?

707
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:37,370
- Okay, we're ready.
- Stand by, please.

708
00:51:37,444 --> 00:51:39,742
- What's this new label of yours?
- Laurel Records.

709
00:51:39,813 --> 00:51:42,907
Laurel number 101, take one.

710
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,316
When I walk through that door

711
00:51:53,393 --> 00:51:56,191
Baby, be polite

712
00:51:56,263 --> 00:51:58,925
You're gonna make me sore

713
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:01,365
If you don't greet me right

714
00:52:01,434 --> 00:52:04,062
Don't you ever kiss me once

715
00:52:04,137 --> 00:52:06,071
Kiss me twice

716
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:09,803
Treat me nice

717
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:13,004
I know that you've been told

718
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,775
It's not fair to tease

719
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:18,317
So if you come on cold

720
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,013
I'm really gonna freeze

721
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:25,524
If you don't want me to be
cold as ice

722
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,456
Treat me nice

723
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:32,555
Make me feel at home

724
00:52:32,632 --> 00:52:35,328
If you really care

725
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:40,635
Scratch my back and run
your pretty fingers through my hair

726
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:43,870
You know I'd be your slave

727
00:52:43,944 --> 00:52:46,640
If you asked me to

728
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:49,443
But if you don't behave

729
00:52:49,516 --> 00:52:51,746
I'll walk right out on you

730
00:52:51,818 --> 00:52:56,346
If you want my love
then take my advice

731
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,550
Treat me nice

732
00:53:00,627 --> 00:53:03,425
Make me feel at home

733
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:06,158
If you really care

734
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:11,500
Scratch my back and run
your pretty fingers through my hair

735
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:14,734
You know I'd be your slave

736
00:53:14,808 --> 00:53:17,402
If you asked me to

737
00:53:17,477 --> 00:53:19,911
But if you don't behave

738
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,642
I'll walk right out on you

739
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:27,176
If you want my love
then take my advice

740
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:29,788
Treat me nice

741
00:53:31,258 --> 00:53:32,691
Treat me nice

742
00:53:33,827 --> 00:53:36,318
Treat me nice

743
00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:38,762
If you really want my lovin'

744
00:53:38,832 --> 00:53:41,960
Treat me nice

745
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:15,394
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, darlin'.

746
00:54:15,468 --> 00:54:18,631
What's this I hear about you quitting
Alba and becoming a recording tycoon?

747
00:54:18,705 --> 00:54:21,003
That's right.
Here's my first offering.

748
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:23,099
"'Treat Me Nice',
Vince Everett."

749
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,906
- How is it?
- Good enough to make me quit my job.

750
00:54:25,979 --> 00:54:28,379
And you want me to
give it a couple of shots?

751
00:54:28,448 --> 00:54:31,576
If you only would, Teddy.
It would mean so much to us.

752
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:34,381
Well, we'll try,
see how the cookie crumbles.

753
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:35,944
Thanks.

754
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,513
Peg, how long are
you gonna be in town?

755
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,024
About a day or two.

756
00:54:40,093 --> 00:54:43,585
Well, suppose we get together
and split a herring?

757
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:45,597
- I'd like that.
- Good.

758
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:04,842
"Folks, does your dog turn up his nose
at the same old canned dog foods?

759
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:07,011
"Then why don't you try fresh meat?

760
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:10,648
"Cy's Pet Shop will deliver fresh,
red, juicy horse meat...

761
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,125
"wrapped in the size package
you demand, right to your door.

762
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:19,960
"It's a bit more, but the treat for your
dog will be worth dollars in health.

763
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:23,969
"Remember Cy's Pet Shop.
Telephone Mammoth-62480.

764
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:27,029
"That's Mammoth-62480."

765
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:31,504
Friends, I owe our listeners
an apology.

766
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:35,275
Callers have complained they couldn't
hear all of the Vince Everett record...

767
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:38,317
because of the commercial,
so we're going to play it again.

768
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:41,650
We're doing it for Betty,
Maryjo, Linda, Julie...

769
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:45,282
the gang down at Ray's Auto Upholstery
and... well, the list is too long.

770
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:48,156
Apparently, just about everybody
wants to hear this new platter.

771
00:55:48,228 --> 00:55:51,493
So here he is, Vince Everett
singing "Treat Me Nice"...

772
00:55:51,564 --> 00:55:53,794
on the new Laurel label.

773
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,818
Mr. Shores.

774
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:24,693
I now have confidence in your
earning potential, Mr. Everett.

775
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:26,061
You're in.

776
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:29,761
For 10% of the record company
and 5% of your earnings.

777
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:31,633
Nine percent of the company.

778
00:56:31,704 --> 00:56:34,138
That leaves me 51%
and controlling interest.

779
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:35,606
Agreed.

780
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:39,611
- And 4% of my personal take.
- I have the papers already prepared.

781
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,704
With those figures?

782
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,976
I anticipated you, Mr. Everett.

783
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:49,215
How do you like that? He smelled
the money from 400 miles away.

784
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:50,722
I think I got it made.

785
00:56:59,866 --> 00:57:02,528
Vince. Come on in.

786
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:08,001
I just checked the record shop.
We sold 425 copies.

787
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:11,600
- That's great.
- We got a hit.

788
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,613
You stick with me, and I'll
put diamonds in your teeth.

789
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,171
Oh, that's nice.

790
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:18,717
How do you like the cuff links?
A dollar a week.

791
00:57:18,785 --> 00:57:21,618
Do you intend on using them
for a landing strip?

792
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,486
It's the mark of a man's success.

793
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,798
You look sexy tonight.

794
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,802
You start the hammers
to pounding in my skull.

795
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:56,385
You must have read my mind
when you wore this dress.

796
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:59,550
- What's on your little mind?
- A celebration.

797
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:02,424
Tonight's the night
for a real celebration.

798
00:58:02,495 --> 00:58:04,520
- I like the idea.
- We'll send up rockets.

799
00:58:04,597 --> 00:58:07,031
- But not with you.
- Soft music, loud champagne.

800
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,295
We'll charge it to
Laurel Records' ex...

801
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:11,428
- Not with me?
- No, not tonight.

802
00:58:11,504 --> 00:58:14,769
- Who with?
- I have a date with Teddy Talbot.

803
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:18,800
- That record spinner? You're kiddin'.
- That record spinner made a hit for you.

804
00:58:18,878 --> 00:58:22,211
But I've already got reservations
at the local nightspot and everything.

805
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:26,750
Vince, you should have made
reservations with me.

806
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:28,844
I still have a life
of my own, you know.

807
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,857
I thought this was one night
you wouldn't let me down.

808
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,526
Vince, I don't understand
why you're so upset.

809
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:39,759
You told me yourself. I asked you if
money was all you were interested in...

810
00:58:39,832 --> 00:58:42,323
and your answer was,
and I quote, "What else?"

811
00:58:42,402 --> 00:58:44,495
Ah, that was different then.

812
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:46,471
Was it?

813
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:49,372
Vince, I will not be subject
to your beck and call.

814
00:58:51,578 --> 00:58:53,170
Excuse me.

815
00:58:56,883 --> 00:58:58,316
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi.

816
00:58:58,384 --> 00:59:00,284
- You do look scrumptious.
- Thank you.

817
00:59:00,353 --> 00:59:02,287
- Be right with you.
- Okay.

818
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:05,683
- Hi, Vince.
- What do you say?

819
00:59:05,758 --> 00:59:09,023
- Seein' much of our little metropolis?
- Oh, I've seen enough.

820
00:59:09,095 --> 00:59:11,586
Did you thank the man
for all the help he's given us?

821
00:59:11,664 --> 00:59:13,598
Oh, that's not necessary.

822
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:16,294
Thank the man, Vincent.

823
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:18,428
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

824
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,532
Good night, Vince.

825
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,875
Good night, Vince.

826
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:44,095
After the success
of his initial record...

827
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:48,190
Mr. Everett was enabled to command
more advantageous contracts.

828
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:52,398
I was told the adolescents found
Mr. Everett's unique style of singing...

829
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:54,872
quite titillating.

830
00:59:54,941 --> 00:59:58,672
Our expenses, however,
increased with gross income.

831
00:59:58,745 --> 01:00:02,374
I found transportation costs
to be particularly high.

832
01:00:02,448 --> 01:00:04,678
This, however,
was a deductible item.

833
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:07,743
Oh, his choice of color was white.

834
01:00:13,126 --> 01:00:15,720
I doubted I could convince
the Internal Revenue Department...

835
01:00:15,795 --> 01:00:19,731
that all of Mr. Everett's entertaining
was for business purposes only.

836
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,135
On the other hand,
my client felt extremely elated...

837
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,228
over his latest good fortune.

838
01:00:26,306 --> 01:00:28,740
He'd been invited by
the National Broadcasting Company...

839
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:32,744
to participate in a nationwide
television extravaganza.

840
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:44,948
Hiya, pard.

841
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,055
How are you? Huh?

842
01:00:55,134 --> 01:00:57,295
I guess you heard the news
about the TV show.

843
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,304
Yes, Mr. Shores told me.

844
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:01,706
Come on.

845
01:01:01,774 --> 01:01:04,368
I wanna introduce you
to a new member of the troupe.

846
01:01:06,846 --> 01:01:09,212
Laury Jackson,
this is Peggy Van Alden.

847
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:12,217
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
- How do you do?

848
01:01:12,285 --> 01:01:15,277
Laury is a real cool little singer.
I'm takin' her to New York with me.

849
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,781
In that case,
I don't think I'll go.

850
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:24,229
Were you planning to go?
What for?

851
01:01:24,297 --> 01:01:26,060
No reason I can think of now.

852
01:01:26,132 --> 01:01:28,100
Got nothin' to do with
the record business.

853
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,964
Of course not.

854
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:32,334
It's just like you said
that night in Joplin:

855
01:01:32,405 --> 01:01:35,135
"You and me,
it's strictly business."

856
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,142
Let's keep it that way.

857
01:01:39,846 --> 01:01:43,077
Let me know when you wanna
cut another record, pard.

858
01:01:59,899 --> 01:02:03,164
Okay, I'll see you.
You gonna wish me luck?

859
01:02:06,873 --> 01:02:08,204
Luck.

860
01:02:08,274 --> 01:02:10,435
Where's my Vince boy?

861
01:02:11,577 --> 01:02:13,010
Hi, son.

862
01:02:13,846 --> 01:02:16,076
Remember me?

863
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:19,607
Hunk, you old son of a gun.
How are you?

864
01:02:19,685 --> 01:02:22,916
You must be Peggy Van Alden,
the gal that started the record company.

865
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:26,322
- How do you do?
- I'm the bird got Vince started, right?

866
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:28,917
You'd better believe it. How'd you
know about the record company?

867
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,225
I gotta keep up with
the activities of my partner.

868
01:02:31,297 --> 01:02:33,561
You've got more partners
than a square dance.

869
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:36,363
Yep. I taught the boy plenty.

870
01:02:36,436 --> 01:02:39,234
You'll find out just
how well you taught him.

871
01:02:39,305 --> 01:02:40,738
Good night.

872
01:02:41,874 --> 01:02:43,466
That's a pretty little thing.

873
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,874
Well, boy, I'm rarin' to go.

874
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:50,644
How do you like it?
Thirty cartons of cigarettes.

875
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:52,877
You old stud.
How about a drink?

876
01:02:52,952 --> 01:02:54,886
Sing it to me
in the key of G.

877
01:02:54,954 --> 01:02:59,050
Folks, meet Hunk Houghton,
the toughest old con in cell block 21.

878
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,650
Howdy. Pleased to meet you.

879
01:03:01,727 --> 01:03:04,628
- How 'bout that drink now?
- You can pour me a gourd full.

880
01:03:06,165 --> 01:03:09,532
Uncle Matthew bonded bourbon.
Do you know how old this bourbon is?

881
01:03:09,602 --> 01:03:12,537
- How old?
- Twelve years old.

882
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:14,436
Heavens above.

883
01:03:19,412 --> 01:03:22,848
That's like an angel dancing
over the tip of your tongue.

884
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:26,407
It seems a shame to even
digest this bourbon.

885
01:03:26,486 --> 01:03:29,944
You made it, huh? I've been readin'
about it, and I feel proud of you.

886
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:32,923
- Yeah, I've been lucky so far.
- Lucky?

887
01:03:32,992 --> 01:03:35,426
Talent. I knew you had it
the minute you opened your mouth.

888
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:38,362
- Now you're goin' on TV.
- You know everythin', don't you?

889
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:42,299
I feel good.
What's your plans for me, boy?

890
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,538
Well, I ain't exactly
got any, Hunk.

891
01:03:46,606 --> 01:03:50,269
- No plans for Hunk, your old partner?
- What do you wanna do?

892
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:53,210
I want a spot in that TV show.

893
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:56,112
You're talkin' crazy, Hunk.
You better think it over.

894
01:03:56,182 --> 01:03:58,844
I've been thinkin' about it
for 18 years.

895
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,546
Yeah, I know, but...

896
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:03,782
times have changed
and styles have changed.

897
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:06,256
You might fall
flat on your face, boy.

898
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:08,589
I might get lucky like you too.

899
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:14,063
I tried your style, like you taught me.
Boy, I laid a bomb.

900
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:16,067
But you ain't me.

901
01:04:17,136 --> 01:04:20,572
I need one good break.
You can get it for me on that show.

902
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:27,077
I owe you that much, but I
don't know how it's gonna work out.

903
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:29,706
Oh, you let me worry about that.

904
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,613
You're a good boy.

905
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:36,647
Ladies and gentlemen,
a little while back...

906
01:04:36,722 --> 01:04:40,715
I had kind of a vacation with a bunch
of men in a big place out yonder.

907
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:44,456
While I was there, these men...

908
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:46,964
kind of guests, you might say...

909
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:51,333
we'd get together and horse around
a little bit and sing...

910
01:04:51,404 --> 01:04:54,237
'cause we were havin'
such a good time...

911
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:58,110
and we always had a lot of fun
with this one, "The Jailhouse Rock."

912
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:58,337
And we always had a lot of fun
with this one, "The Jailhouse Rock."

913
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:12,684
One, two
One, two, two

914
01:05:18,598 --> 01:05:21,328
The warden threw a party
in the county jail

915
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,233
The prison band was there
and they began to wail

916
01:05:24,303 --> 01:05:26,794
The band was jumpin'
and the joint began to swing

917
01:05:26,872 --> 01:05:29,602
You should've heard
those knocked-out jailbirds sing

918
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,700
Let's rock

919
01:05:31,777 --> 01:05:34,041
Everybody, let's rock

920
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:38,407
Everybody in the whole cell block

921
01:05:38,484 --> 01:05:41,453
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

922
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,421
Spider Murphy played
the tenor saxophone

923
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:47,323
Little Joe was blowin'
on the slide trombone

924
01:05:47,393 --> 01:05:49,793
The drummer boy from Illinois
went crash, boom, bang

925
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,729
The whole rhythm section
was a purple gang

926
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:54,732
Let's rock

927
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,734
Everybody, let's rock

928
01:05:58,504 --> 01:06:01,439
Everybody in the whole cell block

929
01:06:01,507 --> 01:06:04,499
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

930
01:06:04,577 --> 01:06:07,375
Number 47 said to number 3

931
01:06:07,446 --> 01:06:10,176
You're the cutest jailbird
I ever did see

932
01:06:10,249 --> 01:06:13,013
I sure would be delighted
with your company

933
01:06:13,085 --> 01:06:15,576
Come on and do
the jailhouse rock with me

934
01:06:15,655 --> 01:06:17,748
- Let's rock
- Go, go, go

935
01:06:17,823 --> 01:06:21,259
- Everybody, let's rock
- Lay it on me, daddy-o

936
01:06:21,327 --> 01:06:24,262
Everybody in the whole cell block

937
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,855
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

938
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,361
Rock, rock
Rock, rock

939
01:06:30,436 --> 01:06:33,269
Rock to the jailhouse rock

940
01:06:33,339 --> 01:06:36,035
Rock, rock
Rock, rock

941
01:06:36,108 --> 01:06:38,372
Rock to the jailhouse rock

942
01:06:38,444 --> 01:06:41,709
Sad Sack was sitting
on a block of stone

943
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:44,341
Way over in the corner
weepin' all alone

944
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,545
The warden said, hey, buddy
don't you be no square

945
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,180
If you can't find a partner
use a wooden chair

946
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,190
- Let's rock
- Rock, rock

947
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,193
- Everybody, let's rock
- Rock, rock

948
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,719
Everybody in the whole cell block

949
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:01,699
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

950
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,600
Shifty Henry said to Bugs
For heaven's sake

951
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:07,537
No one's lookin'
Now's the chance to make a break

952
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:10,040
Bugsy turned to Shifty
and he said, Nix, nix

953
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,976
I wanna stick around
while I get my kicks

954
01:07:13,045 --> 01:07:15,104
- Let's rock
- Rock

955
01:07:15,181 --> 01:07:18,639
- Everybody, let's rock
- Rock

956
01:07:18,718 --> 01:07:21,710
Everybody in the whole cell block

957
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,847
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

958
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:27,722
- Dancin' to the jailhouse rock
- Rock, rock, rock

959
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,626
- Dancin' to the jailhouse rock
- Rock, rock, rock

960
01:07:36,435 --> 01:07:39,233
- Dancin' to the jailhouse rock
- Rock, rock, rock

961
01:07:45,077 --> 01:07:47,875
Dancin' to the jailhouse rock

962
01:07:56,589 --> 01:07:58,420
Thank you, Mr. Everett.
Very good, Jack...

963
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:02,552
but a couple of your dancers
missed their marks, and we lost them.

964
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:04,687
We'll go right into
the hillbilly number.

965
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,932
What's his name? Houseman?

966
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,592
Hunk Houghton.

967
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:12,203
All right, Mr. Houghton.

968
01:08:12,271 --> 01:08:15,007
Okay, cut to four.
Dolly in and hold.

969
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:15,336
Okay, cut to four.
Dolly in and hold.

970
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:27,345
I'm up in the mornin'
with the risin' sun

971
01:08:27,419 --> 01:08:30,980
I work like a slave
'til the day is done

972
01:08:31,056 --> 01:08:33,024
Just workin' and sleepin'

973
01:08:33,092 --> 01:08:36,789
- Where'd he come from?
- Some pal of Everett's.

974
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:39,695
- Say, what is this?
- Don't blame me, Mr. Barton.

975
01:08:39,765 --> 01:08:43,132
It wasn't my idea.
He came as part of the Everett deal.

976
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:47,229
I'm sorry. Deal or no deal,
he's off the show.

977
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:50,503
Okay, Mr. Barton.
Everett might bellyache.

978
01:08:50,576 --> 01:08:54,034
Compared to the sponsor's pain,
his would be nothing.

979
01:08:54,113 --> 01:08:57,310
- I wonder what he ever did for Everett.
- I've got no money...

980
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:01,114
Freddie, we're way over length.
We're gonna have to trim four minutes.

981
01:09:01,187 --> 01:09:02,449
Tell you what.

982
01:09:02,521 --> 01:09:05,354
We'll go right from
"The Jailhouse Rock" to the film clip.

983
01:09:05,424 --> 01:09:07,517
Cut the hillbilly number.

984
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:19,065
I get calls and wires from all over
the world, but not little Peggy.

985
01:09:19,138 --> 01:09:22,596
No, not little Peg. I'll bet she
doesn't even tune me in tonight.

986
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:31,940
Okay, baby,
you wait for me to call you?

987
01:09:32,017 --> 01:09:34,281
Well, it'll be a cold day in...

988
01:09:35,387 --> 01:09:37,651
Yeah, that's what it'll be.

989
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:42,923
- That ain't gonna help.
- It always has.

990
01:09:42,995 --> 01:09:46,396
- I warned you, but you wouldn't listen.
- Don't rub it in.

991
01:09:46,465 --> 01:09:49,127
And don't ask for pity.
You taught me that.

992
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:52,193
- Don't worry, I'll get along.
- How?

993
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,467
One flop ain't a man's whole life.

994
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:57,907
How'd you expect me to follow
that three-ring circus you put on?

995
01:09:57,977 --> 01:10:00,343
You couldn't have
followed a juggler.

996
01:10:00,412 --> 01:10:02,346
Naturally.
I haven't got your talent.

997
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:04,780
That's right, you haven't.
So what are you gonna do?

998
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:06,408
That's not your business.

999
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,347
Now look, Hunk...

1000
01:10:10,422 --> 01:10:12,686
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1001
01:10:12,758 --> 01:10:15,750
I'm not gonna put the brakes
on my career now.

1002
01:10:15,828 --> 01:10:18,763
I don't want you as part of my troupe.
You're not good enough.

1003
01:10:23,202 --> 01:10:25,227
It's been a long time, Hunk.

1004
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:28,068
Music changes every six months.
You gotta change with it.

1005
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:36,474
I was in show business
when you were in wet pants...

1006
01:10:36,548 --> 01:10:38,607
and I'll be in it when they
can't remember your name.

1007
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:41,278
Fine, but not with me.

1008
01:10:41,353 --> 01:10:44,754
- Aren't you forgettin' somethin', sonny?
- I was wondering when you'd bring it up.

1009
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:47,383
Right down the middle, 50-50.
It's a legal contract.

1010
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:50,622
Uh-uh. I put Mr. Shores
on that contract.

1011
01:10:50,696 --> 01:10:52,755
It's not worth the ink
it took to write it.

1012
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:55,425
You should've checked
with a lawyer, dad.

1013
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:01,701
I figured it was a contract in
good faith, more than how legal it was.

1014
01:11:01,774 --> 01:11:04,572
Is that what you figured, Hunk?

1015
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:06,611
Is that what you figured...

1016
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,978
even after the fan mail you knew about
that I got in the can?

1017
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:14,418
A contract is a contract.

1018
01:11:15,921 --> 01:11:18,151
Let's level, huh?

1019
01:11:18,223 --> 01:11:20,418
Okay, you did me a favor.

1020
01:11:20,492 --> 01:11:23,427
You started me out in music,
and then you tried to rob me.

1021
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:30,660
But I ain't forgettin' about the
whippin' you tried to buy me out of.

1022
01:11:30,736 --> 01:11:33,364
So I'm gonna honor that contract,
providing I don't hear...

1023
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:35,964
any more of that jazz
about good faith.

1024
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:40,000
I'm gonna honor it, Hunk,
but not for no 50%.

1025
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,744
- How much?
- Ten.

1026
01:11:44,984 --> 01:11:48,715
I wonder if Shorty checked those airline
reservations. Will you find out for me?

1027
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:51,221
- Ten percent, huh?
- Ten.

1028
01:11:53,525 --> 01:11:54,924
You know...

1029
01:11:54,994 --> 01:11:58,225
a punk like you is liable to get lucky
enough to make a million dollars a year.

1030
01:11:58,297 --> 01:12:00,322
That's just what
I intend to do.

1031
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,630
And 10% of a million
is 100,000.

1032
01:12:03,702 --> 01:12:07,069
There you go. You were
always good at arithmetic.

1033
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,999
You're gonna have the most expensive
flunky in show business.

1034
01:12:16,315 --> 01:12:19,409
After the television show,
the floodgates opened wide.

1035
01:12:19,485 --> 01:12:24,081
We had engagements in the best-paying
recreation centers in America.

1036
01:12:24,156 --> 01:12:28,752
Receipts doubled and redoubled.
Our tax situation became acute.

1037
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:33,196
The record business was neglected
during this phase, much to my regret.

1038
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:35,665
However, my hands were tied.

1039
01:12:35,734 --> 01:12:39,636
There seemed to be emotional problems
between the two principal stockholders.

1040
01:12:39,705 --> 01:12:41,673
The 40% participant...

1041
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:44,903
refused to telephone
the 60% partner.

1042
01:12:45,978 --> 01:12:49,379
It was an impasse,
and highly unbusinesslike.

1043
01:12:50,549 --> 01:12:53,746
Finally, there was only one phase
of the entertainment industry left...

1044
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:55,411
so we went there.

1045
01:12:55,487 --> 01:12:59,116
We signed a nonexclusive contract
with Climax Studios.

1046
01:13:02,194 --> 01:13:05,027
We welcome you, Vince,
with all our hearts.

1047
01:13:05,097 --> 01:13:07,463
You may find Hollywood
to be a lonely town.

1048
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:10,502
You're new here,
and good friends are hard to find...

1049
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:13,197
just as in any other industry.

1050
01:13:13,272 --> 01:13:17,538
I want you to know that you may feel
free to regard my home as your own.

1051
01:13:17,609 --> 01:13:19,099
Come to me anytime...

1052
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,581
- Yes?
- The photographer's here.

1053
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,708
Please send him in.

1054
01:13:25,784 --> 01:13:28,309
We want to get your publicity
campaign started right away...

1055
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:30,981
so we're having
a studio photographer come in.

1056
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,996
Mr. Everett, meet Miss Sherry Wilson,
your leading lady.

1057
01:13:41,066 --> 01:13:42,055
How do you do?

1058
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,634
We thought some
photographs together...

1059
01:13:43,702 --> 01:13:46,296
- Sure.
- If you'll just step in there.

1060
01:13:46,371 --> 01:13:49,602
Thank you very much.
Now smile pretty.

1061
01:13:50,809 --> 01:13:53,243
That's fine.
Now maybe an action shot...

1062
01:13:53,312 --> 01:13:56,179
like you just signed your contract
and you're shakin' hands.

1063
01:13:56,248 --> 01:13:59,183
Smile pretty now.
Thank you.

1064
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:01,845
Now we have a little chore
for you two young people.

1065
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,683
We want you to be seen together.

1066
01:14:03,755 --> 01:14:06,952
I'm not doin' a thing for
the next couple of days and nights.

1067
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:10,051
And, Sherry? Remember
that old cooperation, dear.

1068
01:14:10,129 --> 01:14:14,088
Of course. A job's a job

1069
01:14:15,067 --> 01:14:17,331
You'll find I grow on you.

1070
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,163
Who's gonna see us here?

1071
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,332
I got my eye on you every minute.

1072
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,474
I thought we'd have
lunch at Romanoff's.

1073
01:15:02,781 --> 01:15:04,908
You can only eat
so much, you know.

1074
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:09,814
On your left, across the street...

1075
01:15:09,888 --> 01:15:12,550
you will see the mansion
of Jack Benny.

1076
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:16,156
Oh, brother!

1077
01:15:16,228 --> 01:15:18,924
- Sensational, huh?
- It's a smash.

1078
01:15:27,573 --> 01:15:30,201
Don't bother
seeing me to the door.

1079
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:32,140
I could make it.

1080
01:15:32,211 --> 01:15:35,544
I asked for nothing,
I expected nothing and I got nothing.

1081
01:15:36,548 --> 01:15:38,914
What'd you expect for nothin'?

1082
01:15:47,025 --> 01:15:49,892
Okay, everybody,
let's get this show on the road.

1083
01:15:56,501 --> 01:16:00,369
Mr. Drummond, do we have to do
the love scene the very first shot?

1084
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:03,704
Oh, we can't change
the schedule now, Sherry.

1085
01:16:03,775 --> 01:16:06,141
I wanted to sort of
work myself up to it.

1086
01:16:06,211 --> 01:16:08,406
Making love to that rube
won't be easy.

1087
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,075
Oh, you'll be fine, dear.
You're a trooper.

1088
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,983
- Let's rehearse it!
- On the set, everybody!

1089
01:16:16,054 --> 01:16:18,113
The situation is a simple one.

1090
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:22,388
Vince, you've just come home
with great news about your promotion...

1091
01:16:22,461 --> 01:16:25,259
but your wife is lying
on the couch with a bad headache.

1092
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,355
You're bursting with happiness...

1093
01:16:27,432 --> 01:16:30,299
but when you see she isn't well,
you're concerned for her.

1094
01:16:30,369 --> 01:16:33,861
You kiss her tenderly,
and then tell her. Got it?

1095
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:36,032
- Got it.
- Let's run through it.

1096
01:16:36,942 --> 01:16:38,671
Quiet on the set!

1097
01:16:42,914 --> 01:16:45,246
All right, Vince, come in.

1098
01:16:45,317 --> 01:16:47,683
Hey, honey, guess what?

1099
01:16:47,753 --> 01:16:50,051
I finally got that promotion.

1100
01:16:50,122 --> 01:16:51,749
What's the matter?

1101
01:16:51,823 --> 01:16:54,792
I guess it's one of those
miserable headaches again.

1102
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,488
- Did you take any aspirin?
- It doesn't seem to do any good.

1103
01:16:58,397 --> 01:17:00,331
Let me rub your temples.

1104
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:08,531
Good. Now kiss her.

1105
01:17:10,142 --> 01:17:11,632
Gently!

1106
01:17:19,918 --> 01:17:22,011
No, Vince!
Let's try it again!

1107
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:38,430
- How's your headache?
- I'm coming all unglued.

1108
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:50,540
- You know how to float?
- No.

1109
01:17:50,615 --> 01:17:53,106
Come on. I'll teach you.
Come on.

1110
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,018
There you go.
Lay your head back.

1111
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,787
Move your arms.
Kick your feet.

1112
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:06,059
There you go.
Okay, you're on your own.

1113
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,173
- I wanna throw a party.
- For what?

1114
01:18:18,243 --> 01:18:19,608
To celebrate.

1115
01:18:32,991 --> 01:18:34,925
You don't like crazy music

1116
01:18:34,993 --> 01:18:38,053
You don't like rockin' bands

1117
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,564
You just wanna go
to a movie show

1118
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:42,327
And sit there holdin' hands

1119
01:18:42,401 --> 01:18:44,733
You're so square

1120
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:46,896
Baby, I don't care

1121
01:18:48,206 --> 01:18:50,674
You don't like hot rod racin'

1122
01:18:50,742 --> 01:18:53,176
Or drivin' late at night

1123
01:18:53,245 --> 01:18:55,679
You just wanna park
where it's nice and dark

1124
01:18:55,747 --> 01:18:57,578
You just wanna hold me tight

1125
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,708
You're so square

1126
01:18:59,785 --> 01:19:01,844
Baby, I don't care

1127
01:19:03,188 --> 01:19:08,125
You don't know any dance steps
that are new

1128
01:19:08,193 --> 01:19:11,219
But no one else can love me
like you do

1129
01:19:11,296 --> 01:19:13,093
Do, do, do

1130
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,531
I don't know why my heart flips

1131
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,000
I only know it does

1132
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:20,230
I wonder why I love you, babe

1133
01:19:20,305 --> 01:19:24,435
I guess it's just because
you're so square

1134
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,977
Baby, I don't care

1135
01:19:27,045 --> 01:19:29,479
Baby, I don't care

1136
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:47,564
I don't know why my heart flips

1137
01:19:47,632 --> 01:19:49,395
I only know it does

1138
01:19:49,468 --> 01:19:52,403
I wonder why I love you, babe

1139
01:19:52,471 --> 01:19:56,407
I guess it's just because
you're so square

1140
01:19:56,475 --> 01:19:58,841
Baby, I don't care

1141
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:01,344
Baby, I don't care

1142
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:04,348
Baby, I don't care, care, care

1143
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:06,941
I don't care, care, care

1144
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,862
Gee, Vince, when you sing,
it's really gonesville.

1145
01:20:21,933 --> 01:20:24,060
- All for you, honey.
- 'Bye.

1146
01:20:26,304 --> 01:20:29,569
I didn't see you applauding.
You didn't like me?

1147
01:20:29,641 --> 01:20:32,007
You've come a long way
since cell block 21.

1148
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,170
Yeah, and it's been
a tough road to hoe.

1149
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:37,613
I don't know. You hardly haven't
touched the ground at all.

1150
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,283
What do you mean?

1151
01:20:40,352 --> 01:20:42,582
You walked most of the way
on other people.

1152
01:20:43,722 --> 01:20:45,713
You're just gettin' bitter,
old buddy.

1153
01:20:47,392 --> 01:20:50,361
- Doll, where've you been?
- Right in your little heart.

1154
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:52,794
You didn't say a thing
about my outfit.

1155
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:55,460
Flippy.

1156
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:57,365
Real flippy.

1157
01:21:14,986 --> 01:21:17,250
I thought you'd
never come back, Peg.

1158
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:21,354
Every time I see you,
you're working a neck.

1159
01:21:21,426 --> 01:21:23,986
I just been waitin'
and wonderin'...

1160
01:21:24,062 --> 01:21:26,690
if you missed me
like I missed you.

1161
01:21:26,765 --> 01:21:30,223
There was always the telephone.
It would've been nice if you'd called.

1162
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:33,760
I been up to my ears in work, Peg.
No foolin'.

1163
01:21:33,838 --> 01:21:35,430
I understand.

1164
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:40,141
The real reason I came
was about the record company.

1165
01:21:40,211 --> 01:21:42,941
Isn't it about time
you cut a few sides?

1166
01:21:43,014 --> 01:21:44,777
Records?

1167
01:21:44,849 --> 01:21:47,716
Is that why you came back?

1168
01:21:47,786 --> 01:21:50,584
Nobody gets so big that they
can ignore the records, Vince.

1169
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:52,213
Not even you.

1170
01:21:53,925 --> 01:21:56,393
Sure, I'll make records.

1171
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,797
You set up a date, huh?

1172
01:21:59,864 --> 01:22:02,799
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll see that my guests are happy.

1173
01:22:07,105 --> 01:22:09,630
How do you like
our movie star, Peggy?

1174
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,676
He has adapted very quickly.

1175
01:22:11,743 --> 01:22:15,076
There's not much oxygen up where he is,
and a man gets lightheaded.

1176
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,842
Most actors,
when they become stars...

1177
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:22,318
go through a brief period
of being modest.

1178
01:22:22,387 --> 01:22:24,821
Not our boy.
He became a heel overnight.

1179
01:22:24,889 --> 01:22:27,653
What are you doin'
here today, Peg?

1180
01:22:27,726 --> 01:22:29,785
I guess I like punishment.

1181
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:32,022
You don't have to
take it, you know.

1182
01:22:32,097 --> 01:22:34,190
I'll learn.

1183
01:22:34,265 --> 01:22:35,357
Sure.

1184
01:22:36,635 --> 01:22:39,195
You're too smart a gal
to let him cut you up.

1185
01:22:40,005 --> 01:22:41,563
Sure I am.

1186
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,541
- Where's Mr. Everett?
- He's over there.

1187
01:22:47,012 --> 01:22:47,145
Mr. Everett, may I speak to you?
I have startling news.

1188
01:22:47,145 --> 01:22:50,672
Mr. Everett, may I speak to you?
I have startling news.

1189
01:22:50,749 --> 01:22:52,216
Did you hit uranium?

1190
01:22:52,283 --> 01:22:55,741
I've just received a most impressive
proposition from Geneva Records.

1191
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:58,345
Ah, don't mention
that clip joint to me.

1192
01:22:58,423 --> 01:23:02,917
Even though it involves three-quarters
of a million dollars in capital gains?

1193
01:23:02,994 --> 01:23:05,758
- Mention it.
- They want to buy Laurel Records.

1194
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:10,062
In addition to sale price, they want you
in an exclusive contract for recordings.

1195
01:23:10,135 --> 01:23:11,568
For which they'll pay?

1196
01:23:11,636 --> 01:23:15,834
Seven and one half percent
of all the records you sell.

1197
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:18,239
No artist has ever received
an offer that big.

1198
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:20,568
What about Peggy?

1199
01:23:20,645 --> 01:23:22,442
I haven't discussed it with her.

1200
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:25,278
Good. Let me talk to her.

1201
01:23:27,952 --> 01:23:30,716
You're due at the studio in
a half hour to shoot that last scene.

1202
01:23:32,323 --> 01:23:34,848
Order up some booze so I can
pour a few drinks for the crew.

1203
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:36,894
Yes, your majesty.

1204
01:23:36,961 --> 01:23:39,862
These dogs don't get enough exercise.
They're gettin' fat and lazy.

1205
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:42,399
- Why don't you hunt 'em?
- I got a better idea.

1206
01:23:42,467 --> 01:23:44,059
Take 'em for a walk.

1207
01:23:47,739 --> 01:23:49,673
What's the matter?

1208
01:23:50,909 --> 01:23:53,036
My contract says nothing
about walkin' dogs.

1209
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,170
Contract?

1210
01:23:55,246 --> 01:23:56,736
What contract?

1211
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,549
Okay, I'll walk your dogs.

1212
01:24:06,558 --> 01:24:09,721
You know I ain't askin' you
to shine my shoes or nothin'.

1213
01:24:11,396 --> 01:24:14,593
A man just takes so much, sonny.

1214
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:16,600
Keep that in mind.

1215
01:24:23,675 --> 01:24:26,508
It's been a wonderful party.
Let's do it again.

1216
01:24:26,578 --> 01:24:28,978
- Thank you very much.
- Good-bye.

1217
01:24:29,047 --> 01:24:31,914
Vince, see you.
Take it easy.

1218
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,832
Where've you been?
Almost everybody's gone.

1219
01:24:54,906 --> 01:24:58,433
- I missed a streetcar.
- Let me fix you a blast, huh?

1220
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,447
You missed a swell party.

1221
01:25:04,949 --> 01:25:08,146
What is it that you wanted
to talk about, Vince?

1222
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:10,153
Oh, yeah.
See you fellas later.

1223
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:22,825
- It's about the record company, Peg.
- Mush, you coyotes!

1224
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:30,140
Who's buyin' the drinks?

1225
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,654
What have you been doin'
to these dogs?

1226
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:46,713
I almost walked
the feet off 'em.

1227
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:49,521
I covered eight miles
and four saloons.

1228
01:25:49,594 --> 01:25:51,755
What are you tryin'
to prove, dad?

1229
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:54,856
Well, you said to exercise 'em.

1230
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:57,993
I was afraid the Indians
would cut us off at the pass.

1231
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,935
I don't see nothin' funny!

1232
01:26:01,005 --> 01:26:03,940
Vince, what about Laurel Records?
What is it?

1233
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:18,255
We got an offer for the label.
It's too good to turn down.

1234
01:26:18,323 --> 01:26:22,282
- What kind of an offer?
- To sell out to Geneva Records.

1235
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,488
Wait a minute.
Wait'll you hear the deal.

1236
01:26:25,563 --> 01:26:29,624
Seven hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, a capital gain.

1237
01:26:29,701 --> 01:26:33,660
That's 225,000 in cold cash
for you, after taxes.

1238
01:26:34,706 --> 01:26:36,674
But, Vince,
I don't wanna sell out.

1239
01:26:36,741 --> 01:26:39,209
You got no choice, kid.
I own...

1240
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:41,472
I know. Sixty percent.

1241
01:26:43,748 --> 01:26:46,012
That's the way the mop flops.

1242
01:26:47,085 --> 01:26:49,019
You'd think I was
tryin' to rob you.

1243
01:26:49,087 --> 01:26:52,488
You're getting practically
a quarter of a million dollars!

1244
01:26:52,557 --> 01:26:54,491
Dollars!

1245
01:26:56,494 --> 01:26:59,395
Is that the beginning
and the end of the world for you?

1246
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:02,058
Is there no emotion left in you
but the lust for money?

1247
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,730
Emotion?

1248
01:27:06,004 --> 01:27:07,733
What emotion?

1249
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:13,165
It's strictly business
between you and me. You said that.

1250
01:27:13,244 --> 01:27:15,508
I don't care what I said.

1251
01:27:16,581 --> 01:27:19,448
We started this thing together.

1252
01:27:19,517 --> 01:27:23,009
We nursed it and
brought it up, you and I.

1253
01:27:23,087 --> 01:27:25,749
It may be just a ledger page
to you and Mr. Shores...

1254
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:28,348
but to me
it's part of my life!

1255
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,256
Go ahead and sell it!
I don't care what you do!

1256
01:27:39,037 --> 01:27:40,470
Nothin' but a record company.

1257
01:27:41,973 --> 01:27:45,033
It's not just the record company
that's botherin' her.

1258
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:51,205
Trampin' on me
is one thing, sonny.

1259
01:27:51,282 --> 01:27:53,512
Hurtin' a little girl
like Peggy is another.

1260
01:27:53,584 --> 01:27:56,109
Just don't you go gettin'
no ideas, Hunk.

1261
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:59,315
There comes a time when you gotta take
a hand in things, and that time is now.

1262
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:02,052
- Don't push me, Hunk.
- I'm gonna beat hell outta you.

1263
01:28:02,126 --> 01:28:04,594
Don't try.
You're talkin' crazy, man.

1264
01:28:04,662 --> 01:28:07,324
- You know you got it comin', son.
- I said, don't try!

1265
01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:13,162
Man, what's the matter with you?

1266
01:28:18,242 --> 01:28:21,302
Now stop it, Hunk!
Just stop it!

1267
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,641
Stop it!

1268
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,646
Get up and fight,
you yellow punk!

1269
01:28:28,252 --> 01:28:31,779
I don't wanna fight you, Hunk.
I told you I don't wanna fight you!

1270
01:28:43,868 --> 01:28:46,098
There's your contract.

1271
01:28:47,972 --> 01:28:50,372
What's the matter?

1272
01:28:53,177 --> 01:28:54,769
What's the matter?

1273
01:28:58,649 --> 01:29:00,776
Somebody get an ambulance!

1274
01:29:00,852 --> 01:29:03,650
Get an ambulance!
Hurry up!

1275
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:49,425
Well, it was a close call.

1276
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,661
The blow hit him in the larynx,
or Adam's apple...

1277
01:29:51,736 --> 01:29:54,569
causing it to swell
and cutting off his windpipe.

1278
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,506
- We had to do a tracheotomy.
- What's that?

1279
01:29:57,575 --> 01:30:01,568
Cut a hole in his windpipe down here
so that he could breathe.

1280
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:04,274
Now, the big thing is his voice.

1281
01:30:04,348 --> 01:30:07,681
A blow like that can change
the whole structure of the voice box.

1282
01:30:07,752 --> 01:30:10,983
- You mean, he might not be able to sing?
- That's right.

1283
01:30:11,055 --> 01:30:14,388
We'll have to wait a few days
until the swelling goes down.

1284
01:30:14,459 --> 01:30:15,790
We'll see.

1285
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:19,455
You can visit him in about 24 hours,
but please don't let him talk.

1286
01:30:47,225 --> 01:30:49,785
How do you feel?

1287
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:53,160
Can I get you anything?
Bottle of whiskey or somethin'?

1288
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:58,301
I want you to know
I feel terrible, son.

1289
01:30:59,637 --> 01:31:02,504
I can't find the words
to tell you how bad I do feel.

1290
01:31:07,678 --> 01:31:09,805
It was an awful thing I did.

1291
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:16,410
If I could only take it back, I'd
cut off both my arms up to the elbow.

1292
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:24,123
I can't ask you to forgive me.

1293
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,832
I want you to know
I'll never forget it.

1294
01:31:49,353 --> 01:31:50,615
Hi.

1295
01:31:57,295 --> 01:31:58,887
You look fine.

1296
01:32:00,198 --> 01:32:02,928
We talked to the surgeon...

1297
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,560
and he thinks
the operation was a success.

1298
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:13,005
Hunk told me what happened
in the fight...

1299
01:32:13,077 --> 01:32:15,341
and the fact that
you wouldn't hit him.

1300
01:32:17,882 --> 01:32:20,612
I think it was wonderful, Vince.

1301
01:32:21,586 --> 01:32:23,884
It was an act of true love.

1302
01:32:25,489 --> 01:32:27,081
Yes, it was.

1303
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:32,027
Don't be afraid to love, Vince...

1304
01:32:32,096 --> 01:32:34,257
because I love you.

1305
01:32:53,117 --> 01:32:54,448
How's it look, Doc?

1306
01:32:54,518 --> 01:32:58,648
It looks just like last week,
Mr. Everett: Completely healed.

1307
01:32:58,723 --> 01:33:00,054
Doesn't feel too good.

1308
01:33:00,124 --> 01:33:03,150
Well, the injury is healed
and the surgery was successful.

1309
01:33:03,227 --> 01:33:06,025
Your larynx looks
as good as it ever did.

1310
01:33:06,097 --> 01:33:10,033
Whether or not your voice is the same
can only be determined by trying it.

1311
01:33:10,101 --> 01:33:11,659
Sure.

1312
01:33:11,736 --> 01:33:15,297
Try it. Sayin' it's easy,
but what if it's not there?

1313
01:33:15,373 --> 01:33:16,806
Look, Mr. Everett...

1314
01:33:16,874 --> 01:33:20,275
these morbid fancies of yours
are doing you no good.

1315
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:24,246
Unless you get hold of yourself,
you'll be a mute, musically speaking.

1316
01:33:24,315 --> 01:33:27,079
Give it a try.
Gotta find out sometime.

1317
01:33:27,151 --> 01:33:29,312
I don't know, Peg.

1318
01:33:29,387 --> 01:33:32,185
Well, now is as
good a time as any.

1319
01:33:33,391 --> 01:33:35,484
I got nobody to play for me.

1320
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:41,457
Come on in, fellas.

1321
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:43,500
Yo, Vince, how you doin'?

1322
01:33:43,567 --> 01:33:45,865
- Let's go to work.
- Hi.

1323
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:50,730
Pretty big audience.
Give a man stage fright.

1324
01:33:50,808 --> 01:33:52,400
Now, Vince.

1325
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:58,239
Okay, but just with the piano.

1326
01:33:58,316 --> 01:34:01,080
- The rest of you guys...
- We'll wait in the other room.

1327
01:34:02,753 --> 01:34:05,722
- Doc, you better stay here, okay?
- All right.

1328
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:33,482
You're so young

1329
01:34:33,551 --> 01:34:37,988
And beautiful

1330
01:34:38,055 --> 01:34:43,891
And I love you so

1331
01:34:45,296 --> 01:34:49,960
Your lips so red

1332
01:34:50,034 --> 01:34:53,435
Your eyes that shine

1333
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:59,403
Shame the stars that glow

1334
01:35:00,544 --> 01:35:04,810
So fill these lonely

1335
01:35:04,882 --> 01:35:09,114
Arms of mine

1336
01:35:09,186 --> 01:35:13,748
And kiss me tenderly

1337
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:20,085
Then you'll be

1338
01:35:20,164 --> 01:35:23,327
Forever young

1339
01:35:24,201 --> 01:35:28,934
And beautiful to me

1340
01:35:31,609 --> 01:35:34,305
You're so young

1341
01:35:34,378 --> 01:35:37,836
And beautiful

1342
01:35:37,915 --> 01:35:43,080
You're everything I love

1343
01:35:44,522 --> 01:35:47,787
Your angel smile

1344
01:35:47,858 --> 01:35:51,453
Your gentle touch

1345
01:35:51,529 --> 01:35:57,058
Are all I'm dreaming of

1346
01:35:57,134 --> 01:36:01,798
Oh, take this heart

1347
01:36:01,872 --> 01:36:04,602
I offer you

1348
01:36:04,675 --> 01:36:10,079
And never set me free

1349
01:36:11,582 --> 01:36:14,779
Then you'll be

1350
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:18,618
Forever young

1351
01:36:18,689 --> 01:36:26,357
And beautiful to me
