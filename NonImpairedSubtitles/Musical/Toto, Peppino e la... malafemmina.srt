1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Totò, Peppino and the Evilwoman

2
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,900
(subtitles by Simone)

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,160
(revision by Claudio)

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A liar woman has left me...

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
- You're always in between!
- Damn!

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,960
Did I hurt you?

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Think about your health!

8
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,000
Health, what health?

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,960
Here it is: Mezzacapa ("Halfhead") Farm.
Even the name is unpleasant.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't like it too, but I don't know
why we have to hate him.

11
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,000
Because you never understand anything.

12
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,010
Mezzacapa is our neighbour, right?

13
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,000
His field borders on ours, right?

14
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,960
I don't like him.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All neighbours are unpleasant and hideous.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Check if he's at the window.

17
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,000
No.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Be quick.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
- Who was that?
- Don't ask.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Same story. Those two are the Caponi ("Bigheads")
brothers. If I catch them...

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He heard you.
He heard you.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Good morning, Peppino.
Good morning, Totò.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You put your feet
under the wheel.

24
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,000
Damn it!

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I was waiting for you yesterday.

26
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,960
I couldn't come. My wife was sick.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, you mustn't be late,
otherwise i'll change metayer.

28
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,960
No, why?

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Then, you owe 60.
And 40 of the old bill.

30
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,960
That makes 100.

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That makes 100.
Neat, neat: net weight.

32
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,010
Net weight: here 10,000 lire are missing.

33
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,000
Sorry, they were in this other department.

34
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,180
- Ok, ok. - And now, you owe me
12,000 lire.

35
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,800
- 12,000 I used to pay the vet for the cow.
- Yes, yes, I remember.

36
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,370
The cow died and so the two veals.
I've... I've said enough, I've said.

37
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,680
- One moment, I paid 12,000 lire, Peppino.
- He's said enough, you'll never see them.

38
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,600
- How I'll never see them?
- Tell me Nicola, what do you owe me?

39
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,720
Nothing, I already paid you in advance.

40
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,870
Ok, but now it's summer,
pay me this in advance.

41
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,410
Don Antonio, I already paid you '56, '57 and '58.

42
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,500
- But '59 is uncovered.
- You like jokes, but I get angry.

43
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,560
Good morning, Don Antonio,
did you bring me a present?

44
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,130
Of course, turn around.

45
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,850
Close your eyes.

46
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,450
Open your eyes.

47
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,840
- Oh, it's beautiful! -You like it?
- Thanks, Don Antonio -You're welcome.

48
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,690
See you later, eh? Bye!

49
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,010
- It's 27,000 lire.
- 27,000 lire.

50
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,000
Plus... plus... plus...

51
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,620
- Give here.
- I was counting them for you.

52
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,620
I count them myself.

53
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,230
So we're even...
and with you, as well.

54
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,690
Madam?

55
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,180
Oh, you're here at last!
I've been waiting for you for two hours!

56
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,710
And I can't close the luggage
without underwear.

57
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,320
- What you're looking at?
- Nothing... I was looking for you.

58
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,020
Ah... I know who you're looking for.

59
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,130
But you, my son, Mr. Gianni,
you must forget him.

60
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,830
You and all the girls around, right?

61
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,790
Let's go!

62
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,840
Madam, I'm a serious girl!

63
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,490
Maybe you are...

64
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,860
but you iron very badly!

65
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,910
Look at this... Is this ironed?

66
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,440
Well ironed?

67
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,910
My girl...

68
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,190
With this my son has to take his degree
in front of the biggest scientists of the world!

69
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,650
Alright...

70
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,930
I'll take care of that.

71
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,480
Let's go upstairs, hurry up,
it's late.

72
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,510
And Gianni has to leave for Milano.
Come on! Come on!

73
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,910
Where are my brothers?

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,600
They'll make him lose his train.

75
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,020
- They're outside.
- Doing what?

76
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,420
You look like the National Bank cashier.
Counting, counting, but what d'ya count?

77
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,580
Beast! Spend your money! Have fun!

78
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,030
Life is short! Death can comes
any time! Look at me!

79
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,230
One can also live 100 years.

80
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,290
And then?

81
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,330
I've said enough, I've said.

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,050
By the way...

83
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,340
- Oh, sorry.
- By the way...

84
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,770
You owe 40,000 lire.

85
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,140
About that consignment of oil of the last month.

86
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,470
-Consignment? Consignment is consigned!
-No, no, not for me.

87
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,970
Ok, ok. What's that?
You're in hurry?

88
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,400
You just said one can live 100 years.

89
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,880
But death can comes any time.

90
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,510
C'mon, c'mon, hurry up.

91
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,760
Hurry up, hurry up...

92
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,970
It depends on you.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,930
How?

94
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,220
Well, these ones, you take them with you?

95
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,110
Yes, I put them aside.

96
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,380
In the same place.

97
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,590
I put them aside.

98
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,670
Right, if somebody has found a safe place,
it's no use to change it.

99
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,630
Then, go!

100
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,880
You put them in the same place.

101
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,850
I put them aside.

102
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,630
Mine is a friend's advice.

103
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,600
And brother's.

104
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,500
And my advice is to go, now!

105
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,580
You put them there, do you?

106
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,330
I put them aside.
Ouch!

107
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,060
- Just go!
- I'm going.

108
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,420
Don't change the place!
Don't change the place!

109
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,050
- Go!
- You stingy peasant!

110
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,940
Dear brother,

111
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,260
here are your 40,000 lire.

112
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,970
Ah, very well.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,650
One is missing.

114
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,840
- How's that?
- One is missing.

115
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,850
Here it is. A bit of distraction.

116
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,810
It happens.

117
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,480
- So, there's nothing left?
- We're even. - We're even.

118
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,900
- The game is over.

119
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,760
Now, I'd need a little favour.

120
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,940
- What? - We have
to start a new one.

121
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,090
You have to lend me 80,000 lire.

122
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,420
Hmm, not 80,000.

123
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,990
I can lend you these 40,000 lire.

124
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,590
Here they are.

125
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,790
- Distraction.
- It happens.

126
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,630
- Listen...
- You already owe me 40,000 lire.

127
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,390
Why?

128
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,900
Didn't I give them to you before?

129
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,500
I gave you 40,000 lire.

130
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
And game is over.

131
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,050
Then I asked you 80,000 lire,
but you could only lend me 40,000.

132
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,420
- How many lire are missing
to get to 80? - 40.

133
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,330
Then you owe me 40,000 lire,
right?

134
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,170
It's simple. Maths is not an opinion.

135
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,020
My dear brother, you need
an accountant.

136
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,710
You're ignorant.

137
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,490
I'd like to know what you do
with all this money.

138
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,010
You need lots of money.

139
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,430
I'm not like you.
I'm a man who lives...

140
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,360
lives and knows how to live.

141
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,790
Modestly speaking I know
how to dress myself.

142
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,780
Some girls...
I enjoy myself...

143
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,700
Presents...
The necklace...

144
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,970
Those dogs, he calls them girls...

145
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,270
One day you'll end up there,
I'm telling you.

146
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,290
- What does it mean there?
- I've said enough, I have.

147
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,140
You said nothing!

148
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,060
You see, for example,
you stingy man,

149
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,170
Of these 40,000 you just lend me,

150
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,280
20,000 are a present to our nephew.

151
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,860
- Understand?
- Bad idea.

152
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,830
Why?

153
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,240
Very bad. That's a young guy,
you're spoiling him.

154
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:34,680
Spoling him?

155
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,750
Look at me. I give him healthy things.

156
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,950
A nice caciotta cheese, and he's okay.

157
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,650
So he's in Napoli, downtown,

158
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,460
he wants to go to the theatre with a girl,

159
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,730
and he goes to the counter
with a slice of caciotta! Peppino!

160
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,270
So there they are!

161
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,600
Antonio! Peppino!

162
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,020
Gianni is ready, c'mon!

163
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,090
Hurry up! The train won't stay there waiting!

164
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,780
Mom, relax, there's still time.

165
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,490
- Still time, What time is it?
- What time is it?

166
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,920
- Mine is slow.
- And mine is fast.

167
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,870
What time is it?

168
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,750
A quarter past five.

169
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,150
Here's a quarter to five.

170
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,440
- Let's meet us.
- Then it's five.

171
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,990
There's still an hour.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,310
Beautiful son of mine, please, study!

173
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,230
Honour your father's memory!

174
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,540
He wanted you to become a
great doctor so much.

175
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,980
Don't worry, mom,
everything's gonna be alright.

176
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,280
Have a nice trip, doctor.

177
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,410
I'm no doctor, yet.

178
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,100
You will, you will.

179
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,720
With your...
I've said enough.

180
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,530
- What did you say?
- I've said enough.

181
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,460
- Bye Mariangela.

182
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,540
Because of hurrying I was forgetting
the passito wine.

183
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,540
Antonio, Gianni's bag!

184
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,590
-I can take it myself. -No, you must study.
Uncle Antonio e uncle Peppino will take care.

185
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,060
- Uncle Antonio e uncle Peppino.
- It's us.

186
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,480
The bottle.

187
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,530
-Did you hear? Uncle Antonio e uncle Peppino.
-We'll take care.

188
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,500
The boy must study.

189
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,750
Slow down!

190
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,320
A liar woman left me...

191
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,650
Did I hurt you?

192
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,650
But your head is always in the middle.
Think about health.

193
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,060
Check out, is he at the window?

194
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,200
- No. - Take.

195
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,540
- Keep it a while.
- What is it?

196
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,980
- What has he done?
- Nothing. He threw a stone.

197
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,400
Mezzacapa, we don't like him.

198
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,150
So, everytime we buzz around,
we throw him stones.

199
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,150
Haven't you become children, do you?

200
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,930
What children.

201
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
Anyway, it's him who throws, not me.

202
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,950
- Write! - Write!

203
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,370
- Don't shoot.
- Let me do it, let me do it.

204
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,170
How can you smile?
He could hit us!

205
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,080
He could hit you, not me!

206
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,990
Why me? You threw the stone!

207
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,590
- Are you bored?
- It's not bad, thanks.

208
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,600
I see, and you know why?

209
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,740
Because here there's too much crowd,
too much light,

210
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,720
and because we're not alone,
you and me.

211
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,820
I have been waiting for 30 centuries.

212
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,200
But I've been in Napoli since a month.

213
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,540
Exactly. Each day a century.

214
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,410
Listen, let's make it,
an English-style escape.

215
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,710
Come to my place.

216
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,590
Are you sure I'd enjoy myself
more than here?

217
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm the best partner.

218
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,900
Sure, you're a nobleman,
you're rich

219
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,030
haughty...

220
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,210
Yes, indeed!

221
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,360
very haughty.

222
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,960
Hey, you two, did you really decide
to stay together all the time?

223
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,400
I'll wait you on the stairs in 5 minutes.

224
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,420
- It's my turn, now.
- As you prefer.

225
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,620
It's so crowded on this terrace.

226
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,710
- But you invited them.
- Yes, that's true.

227
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,210
And now I can't throw them away.

228
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,640
But I have a bottle of champagne for the two
of us, there, on the other balcony.

229
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,840
Can we drink it you and me,
totally alone,

230
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,680
under the moonlight?

231
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,170
And...?

232
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,400
Then?

233
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,890
Well... let's not be in advance
of our time!

234
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,450
Yes, good, let's not be it.

235
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,490
Remo, you're a very bad
amphitryon.

236
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,820
You let anyone thirsty
and you don't care.

237
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,680
- Go and care of your guests.
- Gabriella, you're so boring.

238
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,210
- Well, what's up?
- I got bored.

239
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,180
- I wanna go away.
- What's wrong with you?

240
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,260
Ah... All these hands upon me...

241
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,620
Dear, try to be rational.

242
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,690
Gabriella... I dance samba only with you.

243
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,270
Stay near to me,

244
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,610
one more night,

245
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,050
you can never know,

246
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,600
how dear you are,

247
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,210
a caress is like the sky,
a caress from the moon,

248
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:36,890
a caress is like the sea,
a caress of the sand,

249
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
let me sleep.

250
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,670
-Good evening.
-Good evening,

251
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,120
I'm sorry, I didn't know that...

252
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,830
Where are you from?

253
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,510
Would you let me go away
through this room?

254
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,340
Of course not, come in.

255
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,500
Thank you.

256
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,400
So, you're a real, a real woman.

257
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,770
Very real, why?

258
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,460
Because I saw you appearing over there

259
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,350
and I thought

260
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,980
if I touch her, she disappears.

261
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,780
If you lead me to the door,
I disappear in a moment.

262
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,870
-I don't wanna disturb.
-Oh no, indeed.

263
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,930
You were playing.

264
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,930
Musician?

265
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,640
No, I'm taking my degree in Medicine.

266
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,290
Oh, really?

267
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,750
I would let you cure me not even a nail.

268
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,180
And why?

269
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,900
You sing too beautifully to be a good doctor.

270
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,770
Then? Do you lead me to the door?

271
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,490
With pleasure. But, tell me,
what do you do during the night?

272
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,690
Walk over the roofs?

273
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:30,930
Where are you from?

274
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,190
From a party I wasn't interested in anymore.

275
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,560
-Escaped?
-Yes.

276
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,670
Then everybody will be looking for you.

277
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,230
-Not bad. This way?
-I'd love it!

278
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,920
You can go out through this room, as well.

279
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,100
But it's better the other way.

280
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,340
Can you wait a while?

281
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,320
Do you need something, Mr.Gianni?

282
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,070
Don't you sleep?

283
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,220
I've been trying for the last two hours.

284
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,210
A molar tooth.

285
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,930
Did you take a sleeping pill?

286
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,340
Yes.

287
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,910
Have to take another.

288
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,790
But, won't it make me bad?

289
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,440
No, what bad, open your mouth.

290
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,550
Here it is. A bit of water...

291
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,500
Very well.

292
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,480
And now, take rest, I switch off the light.

293
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,660
-Thank you.  -Goodnight.
-Thank you.

294
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,590
Excuse me, would you just wait
for a while before going?

295
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,330
Why?

296
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,380
See, this is not my house,

297
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,490
I come from the country,

298
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,860
I'm on board from these
my uncles' acquaintances.

299
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,710
They are a very moral family.

300
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,590
I can't have guests.

301
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,690
Did I compromise the little doctor?

302
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,740
Oh no, you can go if you want,

303
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,440
but grandpa is still awake,

304
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,530
and we have to pass through there to get out.

305
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,230
I'm saying this for you, as well.

306
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,330
Alright.

307
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,310
Let's wait.

308
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,830
Now you're thinking about this peasant
from the countryside

309
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,600
and lives here poorly and with no freedom.

310
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,320
I come from the countryside, too.

311
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,860
But, who knows,

312
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,000
maybe I've had too much of freedom.

313
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,930
Are those your uncles?

314
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,540
Yes, they are extraordinary men.

315
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,140
Uncle Peppino, the one sitting is Uncle Antonio,

316
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,760
-and their nephew, Gianni.
-Marisa.

317
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,270
Then we must drink to our meeting.

318
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,190
Passito. Uncle Antonio takes special care of it.

319
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,770
No, thanks. I drank too much
and I haven't eaten.

320
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,050
I'd like to drink to Uncle Antonio,

321
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,810
but I should eat something first.

322
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,630
In this case...

323
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,850
Caciotta!

324
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,540
Caciotta? Wonderful!

325
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,450
I'm trying to understand
what kind of woman you are.

326
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,250
Really? Is that so hard?

327
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,160
Let's see. What could I be?

328
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,440
A student?

329
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,150
No, you're too refined.

330
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,900
A girl from the high class?

331
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,430
You haven't said a swearword, yet.

332
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,750
A model?

333
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,290
You would care more about your dress.

334
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,520
An actress.

335
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,680
I don't think so.
You'd be showing off.

336
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,310
A bad girl?

337
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,460
Oh no, no clue of that.

338
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,450
Oh, then it means that I'm nothing.

339
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,230
Oh no, indeed. Everything.

340
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,370
A complete woman.

341
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,880
-Do you like it?
-Being a complete woman?

342
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,050
No, the caciotta.

343
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,990
It's delicious.

344
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,090
Uncle Peppino would be proud of this.

345
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,960
-Uncle Antonio, Uncle Peppino...
-And Gianni.

346
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,990
And which is Gianni's speciality?

347
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Well, if you want...

348
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,080
My health is perfect.

349
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,030
Your heart, too?

350
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,040
Unfortunately, yes.

351
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,280
No, put away that instrument,

352
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,240
I like more this one.

353
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,940
Or do the all family wake up?

354
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,130
No, they're used to.

355
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,020
Who's there, with the grandpa?

356
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,740
Mrs. Tina, the Cavalier her husband,
and their daughter Giulietta.

357
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,730
13-year-old and cross-eyed.

358
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,970
-And she's in love with you, of course.
-Who can guess?

359
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,240
When she looks at me,
she stares the radiator

360
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,750
Come on.

361
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,720
One voice, one guitar and a bit of moon,

362
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,950
what do you need more

363
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,670
to play a serenade?

364
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,680
to whisper of love,

365
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,750
softly,

366
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,950
sweet words,

367
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,630
for your beloved.

368
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,570
I love you, so much, so much,

369
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,530
I can't live anymore far from you.

370
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,140
One voice, one guitar and a bit of moon.

371
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,620
How sweet this serenade is.

372
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,170
Your mouth comes nearer,

373
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,670
and you hold me more tightly.

374
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,120
with you near I'm happy.

375
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,250
My love,

376
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:49,310
I can't forget you anymore.

377
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,210
My love,

378
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:14,060
I can't forget you anymore.

379
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,820
You promised me to lead me to the door.

380
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,650
Would you keep your promise?

381
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,930
Ok.

382
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,810
Go and check if I can go away.

383
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,750
-Mr. Gianni!
-What's up? Oh, it's you.

384
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,710
You sang beautifully this night.

385
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,690
Thank you, but now go to sleep.

386
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,060
How beautiful your voice is.

387
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,770
Ok, ok, but go to sleep.
Goodnight!

388
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,870
Goodnight.

389
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,370
What is better than a beautiful memory?

390
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,800
One, two, three, four...

391
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,100
Keep on going, girls.

392
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,240
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

393
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,330
-Good morning.
-Hi!

394
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,570
What did you do last night?
They looked for you everywhere.

395
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,430
Can I know where you escaped?

396
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,480
-Good morning, miss.
-Good morning.

397
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,230
We're ready, we can start if you want.

398
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,540
Alright, I change my clothes and I come.
-Ok, come on, girls!

399
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,040
I met a young boy.

400
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,050
Handsome and irresistible.

401
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,350
-Nice, very nice.
-Rich?

402
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,320
Very rich. He owned a whole caciotta.

403
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,700
A student in Medicine.

404
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,620
Please, Marisa, don't get on my nerves.

405
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,470
Relax, I won't see him anymore.

406
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,340
Alright. Better like this.

407
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,030
Really better like this.

408
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,710
Otherwise...
Who knows?

409
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,950
So, when I came back inside,
she wasn't there anymore.

410
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,980
A nice dream.

411
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,760
Why don't we use it to play
at the lottery?

412
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:21,980
Two coffees.

413
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,560
Hey, Raffaele, look at this.

414
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,470
Do you call this a dream?

415
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,780
So we have the evidences of the dream.

416
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,220
What do you think?

417
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,500
What do I think?

418
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,700
I think there are the typical features
of the disturber agent of the young man.

419
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,650
Raffaele, I must find this girl
come hell or high water.

420
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,640
-Let's put an add on the newspaper!
-Let's put it.

421
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,510
"Looking for...
I must find this girl..."

422
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,070
"Your son

423
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,340
rather than studying

424
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,780
gets lost with brothel

425
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,030
women. A friend."

426
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,970
Oh mother of mine, what a tragedy!

427
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,000
what we do now? what we do?

428
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,340
Peppino!

429
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,580
Antonio!

430
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,770
Madam, they're out!

431
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,790
Where have they gone?
Send someone to get them!

432
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,950
What a tragedy!

433
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,650
Look what a beauty.

434
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,390
How much did it cost?

435
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,440
2 millions and a half.

436
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,130
Who gave you the money?

437
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,560
-Don't ask.  -How's 'Don't ask'?
-Don't ask.

438
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,190
How's 'Don't ask'?

439
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,450
We wanna waste time!

440
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,660
Let's waste it. I wanna know
you gave you the money.

441
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,480
I sold three pairs of oxen.
Ok?

442
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,410
What oxen?

443
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,950
It ain't none of your business.

444
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,020
No, they are mine business,

445
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,100
I really think so, which oxen?

446
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:16,920
Yours.

447
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,930
Here we are!

448
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,880
Keep your hands off!

449
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,090
Not a move! Not a move!

450
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,270
It is because we are brothers, understand?

451
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,560
and then? I'm the elder.

452
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,750
And you sold the oxen to buy this tank?!?

453
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,160
How's the saying?
"Women and oxen from your own country"

454
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,640
Do you call this a tank?

455
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,530
This is a... a jewel of mechanics!

456
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,510
Let's face it:
is it only me not liking Mezzacapa

457
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,290
or you don't like him, too?

458
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,230
I don't like him, too.

459
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,440
But I liked the oxen.

460
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,150
And what does this mean?

461
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,110
It means that when Mezzacapa sees
that we have the tractor,

462
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,300
will be green with envy.

463
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,340
Yes, and meanwhile
the oxen are gone.

464
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,370
And you're disheartened?

465
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,550
You're the only last!
Peasant!

466
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,890
And I come to you speaking
about civilization,

467
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,290
this is civilization, it's progress!

468
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,630
And you want back the animals?
Look what a magnificence!

469
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,990
Don't touch!
Look what a magnificence!

470
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,990
-Ahhh!   -What's up?
-What are you doing?

471
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,380
It was:"Ahh... Look the body!"

472
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,280
To keep mosquitos out of the dashboard.

473
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,080
-What?   -Dashboard.

474
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,560
These are mechanical terms,
you can't understand them.

475
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,720
This is the mechanical-movemaking apparatus.

476
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,920
-This is the engine.
-The engine.

477
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,080
Here you put the mixture,

478
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,990
-Here there is the carb... the bica... the bcarb...
-The bicarbonate?  -Yes, the bicarbonate!

479
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,190
Does it work with bicarbonate?!?

480
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,380
-What bicarbonate!    -The fuel!
-The fuel for the ca-ca-carburettor.

481
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:30,930
And what is this?

482
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,170
This is the compass.

483
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,870
With the compass we can go North, South,
South-West, Middle-East.

484
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,700
Where you want. Where you want.

485
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,580
-But do you know how to drive?
-I don't but it means nothing.

486
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,620
Why does it mean nothing?

487
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,020
Because everything is written.

488
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
You see, there is the inscription.

489
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,210
The way how to use it.

490
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,390
Well... Ah! It's not so easy.

491
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,800
It comes from Milano. It's written in Milanese.

492
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,150
Well, let's call Mezzacapa.

493
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:53,680
Him? Never!

494
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
But he says he has been in Milano.

495
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,080
Nevermore. Get on!

496
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,530
-No, you get on!   -Get on!

497
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,250
Poor beasts of mine...

498
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,190
It's so narrow here.

499
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,400
-It's narrow here!
-You have one leg too much.

500
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,570
Don't give me your shoe...
Where are you putting that foot?

501
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,630
I tell you it is narrow!

502
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,820
Should we ask to widen it?
To put it in the shape?

503
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,700
Don't move.

504
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,730
Peppino! Antonio!

505
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,810
Who's there?

506
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,050
Come home! Don't wander around,
she needs to talk to you!

507
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,060
Later, later.

508
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,120
Alright...

509
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,350
Hold you tight.

510
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,850
Weight on the left!

511
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:55,870
Starboard!

512
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,950
Help!

513
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,730
Hard-a-starboard!

514
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,600
Be still.

515
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,510
Reverse!

516
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,220
Help!

517
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,550
What happened to you?

518
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,940
Are you playing the Indians?

519
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,800
And do you think
there's time for jokes?

520
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,760
At your age.

521
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,160
Indians? What Indians?
It's a miracle we're alive.

522
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,850
A miracle?

523
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,730
-Why? What has happened?
-His fault.

524
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,020
He insisted to drive the tractor,
this animal.

525
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,420
-Me?    -You know nothing,
you can only drive the pigs.

526
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Since you are their facsimile.

527
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,250
What happened then?

528
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,470
Nothing important, nothing important.

529
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,240
You sent for us, what has happened?

530
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,470
Read, read this letter has just come.

531
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,670
A million they have to give me!
At least a million!

532
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,200
-Come in!
-Good morning M. Lucia.

533
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,690
Please calm down, what is happening?

534
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,460
To calm down... it is just a word.
With what they did to me!

535
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,690
Your respectable brothers...

536
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,220
-...where are they?
-They are here.

537
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,180
Here they are.

538
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,990
Did you break your head!

539
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,120
You deserve that.

540
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,430
But, what happened?

541
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,920
What happened, an earthquake,
the H bomb.

542
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,690
These gentlemen have played
with the tractor,

543
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,530
and they have smashed down
a wall of mine!

544
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,260
Let's start to dot our i's.

545
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,920
We are serious persons,
we don't play with the tractors.

546
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,570
If this disgrace occured,

547
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,430
it occured, it happened,
because

548
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,360
this disgraced brother of mine,

549
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,060
unable at driving, wanted to touch
a gear and the disaster happened.

550
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,940
Anyway,

551
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,090
is it our fault
if the wall couldn't stand the crash?

552
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,800
That's a rotten wall.

553
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,230
The wall wasn't rotten,
it was very compact.

554
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,940
Anyway, rotten or not rotten,
you have to pay for it.

555
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,050
Alright, alright, the one
who broke it will pay.

556
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,160
We pay, we pay,
what's that?,

557
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,460
the Caponi brothers have always paid,
do you understand?

558
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,400
How much are the damages?

559
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,460
How much are the damages?

560
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,360
How much are th..

561
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,460
Do you let me speak?

562
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,590
-Then do it!
-I'm the elder!

563
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,480
How much are the damages?

564
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,430
One million. You have to give me one million.

565
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,470
One million?

566
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,840
Give him this million. Don't make
me see this Halfhead anymore.

567
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,760
Are we joking? Giving a million
to a halfhead? If so a...

568
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,380
...a whole head, how much is it?
A billion ?!? He's right!

569
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,270
A whole house, how much is it?
Let's not be exaggerated!

570
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,050
Are we joking?

571
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,850
What are we doing?
The black market of walls?

572
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,020
Alright, alright. Then,
if it isn't a million,

573
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,590
let's hear, how much will you give me?

574
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,640
You, you, instead,

575
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,500
make us a request, but a honest one,
a proper one, let's hear!

576
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,390
Tell! Tell! Tell!

577
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,940
Alright, then i'd tell...

578
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,950
I'd tell??

579
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,950
Where are we?

580
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,430
As if it is a golden wall!

581
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,000
Golden? I haven't spoken yet!

582
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,380
-We are exaggerating!  -You've spoken too much.
-We are exaggerating!

583
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,610
Exaggerating, exaggerating...

584
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,060
Excuse me, you tell me to make
a honest request,

585
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,200
and did you make it?

586
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,850
-No, I was going to.
-And didn't you make it?

587
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,850
-Not yet.
-Then, why don't you make it?

588
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,120
-Well, let's make...   -Let's make?

589
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,080
Gentlemen, you have to understand
that the wall has to be paid for.

590
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,310
We want to pay for it,
because we have always paid.

591
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,260
Take this out of my sight.

592
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,360
If a million isn't ok,
we can come to an agreement.

593
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,610
I speak. Ok? I speak.

594
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,130
Do we agree then?

595
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,710
Agree what?

596
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,810
How agree what? I mean,
do we agree that I speak?

597
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,780
Ok, let's hear.

598
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,470
It's not your word, not mine,

599
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,690
not my brother's, not my sister's,

600
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,130
200,000 lire and we're even!

601
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,490
200,000 lire? Are we joking?

602
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,240
200... This is a 50,000 matter,
and I'm saying too much.

603
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
What?

604
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,350
50,000 lire? You don't wanna pay, that's it!

605
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,620
Come on, come on, come on!
Deal done!

606
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,110
50,000 lire and we are even!

607
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,140
It was also a disgrace!

608
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,730
-It was a disgrace!
-It was a disgrace!

609
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,560
No, disgrace is only mine!

610
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,210
50,000, we make 25,000 each, ok?

611
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,490
Pay you in advance.

612
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,860
I don't have money right now.

613
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,040
Pay you in advance.

614
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,490
-Do I pay?  -Yes, you.
-But you don't move from here, right?

615
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,090
-I stay here.  -Do you stay here?
-I stay here.

616
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,340
But how if I move?

617
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,330
Then you pay in advance.

618
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,030
I pay. I go.

619
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,360
I really don't understand this brother
of mine. He's so ignorant!

620
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,930
No, I don't understand the two of you.

621
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,850
Here it is.

622
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,840
Mr. Halfhead, here are your 50,000 lire.

623
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,720
Remember, you owe me 75,000 lire,
I have witnesses.

624
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,990
-How?   -I gave 50 to Mr. Mezzacapa,

625
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,980
your part was 25...

626
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,570
-Well, but you owe 40,000...
-That one is over now!

627
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,090
Over? It isn't at all!

628
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,310
Gentlemen, let's be clear. I take
these 50,000 only as a prepayment.

629
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,090
It means that when the wall is done,
we discuss again.

630
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,650
Alright, there's a remedy for everything.

631
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,260
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

632
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,770
-Then: you owe me...
-Peppino! Peppino!

633
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,540
With these counting

634
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,560
you're insistent!

635
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,130
You're mortifying! You're a bore!

636
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,920
He is right, you're a bore!

637
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,400
-Now, we have to speak about much
more serious things.  -Serious things.

638
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,060
Listen to this letter I received from Napoli.

639
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,510
Listen to it.

640
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,450
"Your son, instead of studying,

641
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,090
gets lost with brothel women.

642
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,290
A friend."

643
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,460
A friend of yours.

644
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,180
A friend of mine?

645
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,310
There's written a friend, there.

646
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,340
Because it is without signature.

647
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
Ah, it is homonymous.

648
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,420
You spoiled him.
You, you spoiled this boy.

649
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,120
And what do we do now?

650
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,510
What we do? Poor boy,
we send him some money.

651
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,620
So, instead of dealing with a bad woman,

652
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,360
he will deal with a good woman.

653
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,830
He really has problems here...

654
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,230
he really lacks of brain.

655
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,600
What we do, then?

656
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,960
We have to call him back.

657
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,330
Yes right,

658
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,120
I've always thought it:

659
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,240
only the military career gives
an iron discipline.

660
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,000
No... Call him back to order
and to feelings towards the family.

661
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,670
Bravo! But how?

662
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,670
Let's write to him.

663
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,670
-Yes.  -Let's send him a telegram.

664
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,920
And what do we tell him?

665
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,480
Let's think about it.

666
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,240
We should...

667
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,350
We'd need...

668
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,820
We could...

669
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,850
-I'm thinking.
-Think well!

670
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,370
"Careful: uncles are watching you."

671
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,940
Do you understand something of this?

672
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,180
Maybe they knew you became a Don Juan.

673
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,090
Don Juan...

674
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,310
At your place, you host
blonde and mysterious women,

675
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,440
while I, with all the villa,

676
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,290
I lack of first matter.

677
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,090
The only person I meet

678
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,610
is me in my underwear in the mirror.

679
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,460
I'm so shocking.

680
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,420
Tell me,

681
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,360
your parents,

682
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,830
when do they come back?

683
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,310
Why?

684
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,430
Because if we should find her again,
you could...

685
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,560
...lend me the house.

686
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,730
Of course...

687
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,470
it's a matter of price, you know.

688
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,880
Listen, Gianni, why don't you tell me
about that girl from the roof?

689
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,080
In the meanwhile I go away.

690
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,190
Have fun of me.

691
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,510
She has become an obsession,

692
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,400
until I can't find her, I...

693
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,800
Do I mean nothing to you?

694
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,180
How stupid you are.

695
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,980
With all the girls walking on the road,
you fall in love with a roof-walker.

696
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,320
Who the hell she may be?

697
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,520
-A student.  -A student.

698
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,250
-No, no.  -She isn't.

699
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,000
-Or a model.  -A model!
Is a model ok for you?

700
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,910
No, no.

701
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,460
A cat, a roof ridge.

702
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,140
No, a girl from the high class.

703
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,020
On the roofs?

704
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,720
Yeah, on the roofs.

705
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,680
-Then an actress.
-She may be an actress.

706
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,310
Yes, yes, she may be.

707
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,430
Maybe my grandma.

708
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,000
But she is an actress!
It's her!

709
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It's her! I swear!

710
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,860
Word of honour, it's her!

711
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,180
-Is she this one?  -Yeah!

712
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:44,660
You will dream of me,

713
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,800
I will dream of you.

714
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,660
And in the dream thousands stars
will shine there in the sky,

715
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,700
if you'll look at me,

716
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,860
and then you'll kiss me.

717
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,790
I will dream of you.

718
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,870
-You will dream of me.
-She is good, isn't she?

719
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,150
Good, good.

720
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,430
And her mother, how good she has been!

721
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,380
And we will live the most splendid reality.

722
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,860
And we will live the most splendid

723
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,980
reality!

724
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,500
-Brava!   -Here we are:
run home and prepare everything.

725
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,200
Listen, I think you're illuding yourself.

726
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,980
Tell me if you don't wanna give me your house.

727
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,490
No, I lend it to you but I don't want you
to waste it just for talking!

728
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,710
Don't worry! Leave the key
on the right of the gate

729
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,140
and go to sleep at my pension.

730
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,290
What a wonderful night I'll have.

731
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,500
Tomorrow I'll make you
the anatomy exam!

732
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,110
-Brava!  -Extraordinary!
-Here you are at last!

733
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,040
How beautiful you are.

734
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,130
Do you know that you were even
more attractive tonight?

735
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,180
-Really?  -Really.

736
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,360
Don't you say hello to me?

737
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,410
Dear, you are here! Welcome back!
Did you like the show?

738
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,540
Sincerely, I liked you.

739
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,430
Do you have dinner with me, don't you?

740
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,780
Excuse me, didn't we agree that...

741
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,540
No, no, I come first!

742
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,720
-First?  -Calm down,
because I'm very busy tonight.

743
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,660
That's right. Tonight we have a diplomatic
dinner with that impresario from Milano.

744
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,740
Oh yes. I forgot about it.

745
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,120
You must excuse me
but I really can't come.

746
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,230
Marisa, we make a bad impression!

747
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,270
I? You make it.

748
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,710
As manager, one more, one less...

749
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,390
But... but what shall I tell him?

750
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,390
Tell him what you want.

751
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,460
Now go out you all, because I have
to change and I'm in a big hurry.

752
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:07,890
Maria,

753
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,840
help me, I have an appointment
and I don't wanna be late.

754
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:20,310
"What is better of a beautiful memory?

755
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,720
A pizza together tonight."

756
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,400
This was the best week in my life.

757
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,400
But it's not over like this.
I come to Milano with you.

758
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,380
Oh Gianni, what a joy!

759
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,540
It's wonderful! But your studies, the university?

760
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,030
I'll bring the lecture notes to Milano, I'll study,
then I'll come back to Napoli for the exams.

761
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,330
Another thing, Gianni,

762
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,560
I'm not a practical girl

763
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,590
but I don't think you're rich.
How do you manage it?

764
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,750
This beautiful house must have cost
a lot to you.

765
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,620
No, no, it was a deal with a friend.

766
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,230
Here I am, I am here...

767
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,910
Who's that guy on the boat?

768
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,080
He passes every day and looks here.

769
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,000
He seems he's spying on us.

770
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,270
No, it's one of those sea wanderers.

771
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,200
Poor him!

772
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,210
-Let's give him something.
-Yes, if you want so.

773
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:01,230
Oh, here we are.
The daily call from Gabriella.

774
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,600
Excuse me, honey.

775
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,050
Hey,

776
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,310
Hallo?

777
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:27,800
Yes, Gabriella, it's me.

778
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,230
I'm fine, very fine.

779
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,600
Of course it is still on.

780
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,380
Listen, would you mind your own business?

781
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,160
Do I come to theatre?
Do I make my duty? Yes.

782
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,600
So don't bother me.

783
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,750
Yes, yes, you can tell the manager, too.

784
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,210
Be damned the day I gave you that key!

785
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,940
Is it possible that I have to come
to my house through the sea?

786
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,310
How boring you are!

787
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,910
Next Monday I'm off.

788
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,410
Great. Where do you go?

789
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,610
To Milano with her.

790
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,530
To Milano? And who gives you the money?

791
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,810
Yesterday I met a family friend. No, a family enemy.
He lent me 300,000 lire.

792
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,670
Lucky you!

793
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,130
Did you bring me my clothes?

794
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:08,690
Yes, here it is.

795
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:09,750
Catch it!

796
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,060
130, 140, 150.

797
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,320
Here you are. This is my part,
the rest is my brother's.

798
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,590
Here it is. These are my 150,000 lire.

799
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,640
Very well. Plus 150 it's 300.
Here the bill.

800
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,550
What a shame, what a shame!

801
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,700
Shame... why do you complain?
I've always told you that he's a... a...

802
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,950
-What?
-I've said enough.

803
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,570
When you say ' I've said enough',
you make get angry.

804
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,570
This ' I've said enough'
makes me get angry.

805
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,800
Because you say, you say
and you never say anything.

806
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,170
Do I never say anything?
You call this anything?

807
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,670
You call this anything?!

808
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:53,890
Stop that. Let me sit.

809
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,060
Listen, Mr. Halfhead,
where did you see my son?

810
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,500
Madam, I've already told you,
I've seen in Napoli.

811
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,490
It happened by chance.

812
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:04,560
One night I was walking along via Caracciolo,
when I heard someone calling me.

813
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,870
I turned around and there was your son.

814
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,920
He came out from an expensive restaurant
together with a beautiful girl.

815
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,780
I got closer and he introduced me to the girl.

816
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,480
-Mezzacapa -he said- this is
my girlfriend.   -Girlfriend?

817
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,750
Yes, girlfriend.

818
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,190
We took a coffee together,

819
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,200
and at one point he called me
in a corner,

820
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,920
and he asked me 300,000 lire.

821
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,100
What could I do?
Not giving them to him?

822
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:28,760
No.

823
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,210
I know you since a long time.

824
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:34,460
I know you as honest people.

825
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,480
-Sorry.
-No problem.

826
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,540
I had to lend him those money.

827
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,240
Of course, I made him signing a bill.

828
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,170
Listen, I go to Napoli.

829
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,540
-But where...   -I go.
-Where do you wanna go?!

830
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,120
What do you think, that Napoli
is just down the corner?

831
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,200
Why do you go to Napoli?
Do you think it's like...

832
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,710
I've said enough.

833
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,780
-It's useless you go to Napoli.
-Why is it useless?

834
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,610
Because... there's no one left in Napoli.

835
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,720
Has it been evacuated?

836
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,660
Has it been emptied?

837
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,070
I didn't mean that.

838
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:07,820
I meant that your nephew isn't in Napoli anymore.

839
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,960
-Because he followed the lost
women's caravel.   -What?

840
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,230
Women in Napoli lost their caravans.

841
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,200
No, what have you understood?!

842
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,120
The lost women's caravel is a vaudeville.

843
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,360
Understand? The lost women,
in Napoli, looked for the villains.

844
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,100
In Napoli, women lost their caravans
because of the villains.

845
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,600
What are you saying, for God's sake?

846
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,630
Haven't you understood?

847
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,550
Mr. Halfhead, you must be objective with us.

848
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:34,500
These subtle sentences don't convince us, ok?

849
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,370
Let's speak clear.

850
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,400
-Clearer than th...
-Clear!

851
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,340
Who lost these caravans?

852
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,010
Nobody lost them.

853
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,270
The caravel is a show,

854
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:48,430
and Gianni's girlfriend is a singer.

855
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:50,600
And I mean seriously.

856
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,130
If I can speak freely,

857
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,500
this girlfriend

858
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,230
is a beautiful girl.

859
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,910
Tall, blonde, well-rounded.

860
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,650
She has beautiful legs.

861
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,390
How did you manage to see her legs?

862
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,490
Me? Only me?
A half of Napoli saw them!

863
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,160
At the theatre, it's normal,
you pay the ticket,

864
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,840
you sit on your chair and you see the legs.

865
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,770
Oh my God!

866
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:12,440
What are these? Legs on payment?

867
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,950
Calm down, calm down.

868
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,860
No, no, now you have to be objective.

869
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,220
-Poor son of mine.
-Calm down, Mrs. Lucia, calm down.

870
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,320
Listen, Halfhead,

871
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,630
you said they left.

872
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,740
Where did they go?

873
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,050
To Milano.

874
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,610
Then, let's go to Milano now.

875
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,510
-Are you crazy?
-Why?

876
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,760
You can't go to Milano like this.

877
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,410
To get to Milano you need,

878
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,250
at least, four days on the sea.

879
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,720
Maybe more, because then...

880
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,410
He has said enough.

881
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,940
What are you saying, please,

882
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,050
sea? What sea?

883
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:43,740
You go to Milano by land.

884
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,470
On foot?

885
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:45,420
On foot...

886
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,120
Which country are you living in?

887
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,370
On foot!

888
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,140
Easy to say...

889
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,740
You know where Milano is, don't you?

890
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,800
In Calabria!

891
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,440
In Sardinia, I made a mistake.

892
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,910
Calabria, Sardinia...

893
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,360
Milano is the capital of the North.

894
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,190
We know that.

895
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,410
Try to imagine, this is the "Boot".

896
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,840
Up here there is the North,
down here the South.

897
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,320
Ok, we are those who stay under the boot.

898
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,760
The Southerners.

899
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,130
North, South,

900
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,130
I said I was going to Milano
and I will!

901
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,410
If you want come with me,
otherwise I'll go alone.

902
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,760
My son has got to study.

903
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,580
My son has to leave that woman,
understand?

904
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,020
Bless... bless... bless...

905
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,630
Peppino, we have to go to Milano
with our sister.

906
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:24,320
She can't go alone.

907
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,010
Ok, let's go with her.

908
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,280
Instead, we'd need someone
who gives us advice.

909
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,950
Going to Milano is not easy.

910
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:31,960
Someone?

911
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,390
What am I doing here, then?

912
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,880
Everybody calls me "the Milanese".

913
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,940
Halfhead, let's speak clearly.

914
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,430
Have you ever really been to Milano?

915
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,870
How haven't I? I made my military
service there.  In 1931.

916
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,900
But what I mean, Halfhead,

917
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,890
what the Milan people said
when they saw you?

918
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,700
What should have they said?

919
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,230
I mean, when you walked by the road...

920
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,120
This stranger...

921
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,280
Let's not be silly,

922
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,080
they didn't notice me at all.
In Milano?

923
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,750
You have no idea about what Milano is.

924
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,790
They speak, they speak, don't they?

925
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:01,930
Do they speak?

926
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,740
Milano is a great city.

927
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,250
They walk, they walk like us, don't they?

928
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,240
Do they walk? There's a huge traffic.

929
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,140
Indeed, you must be careful.

930
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,700
Crossing the street is a dangerous thing, there.

931
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,700
We'll never cross it!

932
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,160
We won't even move!

933
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,660
I must say that the weather isn't like here.

934
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,330
There's a more rigid weather.

935
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,550
-Wind, snow...
-Cold?

936
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,560
Cold, the storms.

937
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,220
The storks.

938
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,130
There are storks?

939
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,450
-On the road?
-On the road.

940
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,010
On the road, everywhere.

941
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,790
They go inside the buildings,
up the roofs...

942
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,800
Water, wind and fog!

943
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,220
Fog... fog...

944
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,010
This frightens me.

945
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,950
Anything else, but the fog...

946
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:40,960
In Milano, when there's fog, you can't see.

947
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,860
Good Lord!

948
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:43,740
But who saw her?

949
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,410
What?

950
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,560
This Fog.

951
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,270
Nobody.

952
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,290
But, if people cannot see
when there's Fog in Milano...

953
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,490
how can you see Fog is in Milano?

954
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:55,470
No, it's something you don't touch, ok?

955
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,310
Don't touch?

956
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,660
-It's something that goes inside you.
-Don't touch her.

957
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:03,060
But, apart this Fog,
I won't touch her for Christ's sake,

958
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,990
if we have to meet with our nephew,

959
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,370
and with this singer,

960
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:09,640
how do we see them?
How do we find them?

961
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,860
Right, I haven't thought about it.

962
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,170
It's easy. The singer
has her name on the poster.

963
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,620
Understand? In Milano,
when there is the fog,

964
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,410
they put their names on the posters.

965
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:20,230
"If you want to meet me, I'm here!"

966
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,770
-A kind of signalling.
-Signalling.

967
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,140
You see the name of the singer,
you go to the theatre.

968
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,200
What is her name?

969
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,470
Miss, this is from Grand Milan's direction,
with many congratulations.

970
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,020
Are you happy, my dear?

971
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,560
I'm so happy, my love,
but you shouldn't have done it.

972
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:10,860
Should not? You make me study all day long,
tonight that is your birthday...

973
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,080
For you, miss.

974
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:24,750
Thank you.

975
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:26,280
Who's the sender?

976
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,530
That gentleman over there.

977
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,120
Who's he?

978
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,120
I don't know.
It's the first time I see him.

979
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,160
But he sends you flowers, doesn't he?

980
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,960
Dear, you often forget I'm a showgirl.

981
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,040
But you make me remember it.

982
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,830
Gianni, please.

983
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,650
Here they are, our doves!

984
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,960
I didn't miss them.
Was it you who invited them?

985
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,330
Me? Are you crazy?

986
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,610
Come, come, follow me.

987
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,740
You wanted to be alone, didn't you?

988
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,320
But you can't escape from us.

989
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,850
We sit even though we're not invited.

990
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:05,970
Waiter, another table.

991
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,260
May I? How are you, Marisa?

992
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,460
-Fine, thanks.
-Twentytwo!

993
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,470
They are 22 like the other years,
aren't they?

994
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,180
-One single cake wouldn't be
enough for yours.   -Evil you are.

995
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,050
I have a present for you, too.

996
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,050
A proposal for South America.

997
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,200
Don't spoil my birthday
with the same proposals of yours.

998
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,250
We only miss South America, now.

999
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,290
And we only miss that she puts
a spoke in our wheel.

1000
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,650
I come to America with you
only if he makes me get angry.

1001
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:29,860
So, let's hope for the best.

1002
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,180
Doctor, are you singing for us tonight?

1003
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,410
Why not? Give me the guitar.

1004
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,990
There is one that really suits
with what is happening now.

1005
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,290
Love was keeping me in chains,

1006
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,930
but I said it was enough
and I got free.

1007
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,650
The sky looks blue anymore.

1008
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,340
The sun looks bright anymore.

1009
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,740
And my heart is singing from happiness.

1010
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,860
That girl, that girl,

1011
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,980
She is telling me she wants to leave me.

1012
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,700
She thinks I'm swallowing a bitter pill.

1013
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,400
She thinks I'll go crazy
and shoot myself.

1014
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,780
That girl, that girl,

1015
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,970
She doesn't know the favour
she makes me.

1016
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,700
I'll find a prettier one

1017
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,360
and alone she will be.

1018
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,460
That girl, that girl, that girl!

1019
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,890
Yesterday I got a letter

1020
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,800
from the usher's daughter.

1021
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,930
She writes she's not happy.

1022
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,980
She'd like to make peace with me.

1023
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,930
But I am enjoying my freedom.

1024
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,340
That girl, that girl,

1025
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,480
She is telling me she wants to leave me.

1026
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,280
She thinks I'm swallowing a bitter pill.

1027
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,280
She thinks I'll go crazy
and shoot myself.

1028
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,400
That girl, that girl,

1029
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,500
She doesn't know the favour
she makes me.

1030
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,120
I'll find a prettier one

1031
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,840
and alone she will be.

1032
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,100
That girl, that girl, that girl!

1033
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:04,120
What are you doing there?

1034
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,470
Nothing, I'm breathing fresh air.

1035
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:07,230
What should I do?

1036
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,760
By the way,

1037
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,490
Bring some money with you

1038
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,120
because we'll have to face
mad expenses in Milano.

1039
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,200
Hotels, travels, trains.

1040
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:16,990
Dinners.

1041
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,360
I'll bring everything I have.

1042
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,810
But bring yours, too.

1043
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:23,320
Bring mine...

1044
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,130
Mine, I arrived late.

1045
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:27,170
To the bank?

1046
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:28,330
No, to my bank.

1047
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,400
Listen, would you lend me some money?

1048
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,710
I must confess you something.

1049
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:36,790
I don't know how.

1050
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,510
I have less money here, less!

1051
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:41,680
-How is that possible?
-I don't know.

1052
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,820
You always keep it as...
Where do you keep it?

1053
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,650
That's my own business,
but I have less.

1054
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,230
I had a million first.

1055
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,910
Do you know how much is left?

1056
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,120
700,000 lire.

1057
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:51,050
How do you know that?

1058
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,350
You can see it:

1059
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:54,800
that is a 700,000 lire package.

1060
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,630
So, I miss 300,000 lire.

1061
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,510
It's a logical thing,
a logical consequence.

1062
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,060
Why?

1063
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,830
Why?!

1064
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:02,700
You don't keep yourself up to date.
You don't read the newspapers.

1065
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,720
You don't follow the stock exchange.

1066
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,200
Currency devaluates.

1067
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,810
Yours had a 30% devaluation.

1068
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:10,330
Understand?

1069
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,440
Currency devaluation.

1070
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,370
Inflation.

1071
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,180
Why is everybody laughing?

1072
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,170
Who?

1073
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,190
-They smile.
-Of course they do.

1074
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,130
-Did you ever look at yourself
in the mirror?

1075
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:57,560
Dear Peppino, you,

1076
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,150
Milano style dressed,
are ridiculous!

1077
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:00,910
And you don't, do you?

1078
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,490
What's the point with me?
I follow the trend.

1079
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:07,670
Anyway, Halfhead said it was cold in Milano,
that there was the fog.

1080
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,070
So what?

1081
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,760
Where is this fog?

1082
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,760
What did Halfhead say?

1083
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,180
When there is the fog,
you don't see.

1084
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,600
There is the fog and you don't see her.

1085
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,460
And you don't touch her.

1086
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,820
Anyway, I feel hot.

1087
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,570
Don't be silly, it's cold in Milano.

1088
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,760
But I feel hot.

1089
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,670
It must be a hot cold.

1090
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,950
Listen, let's go to the hotel,
I'm dying from this hot.

1091
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:28,900
We go, now we go, even though
I really don't feel all this hot.

1092
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,880
-Don't you?
-No, I don't.

1093
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,540
It can't be hot in Milano.

1094
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,400
Here is the wine. And the oil

1095
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:37,620
Pants.

1096
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,060
And bread.

1097
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,150
Hang up this caciotta.

1098
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,390
Here's the pasta.

1099
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,290
Wheat pasta.

1100
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,460
Will it be enough for three days,
what do you think?

1101
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,520
-Let's hope so.
-They are four kilos.

1102
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:59,650
Give me the bag with the linen.

1103
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,670
I've already taken care of that.

1104
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,510
-Where's my dearly departed husband's
portrait?  -It's there!

1105
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:09,370
What's in here?

1106
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,560
Our underwear.

1107
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:13,870
Underwear? Out! Out! C'mon!

1108
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,560
Out, out, out!
Walk around the room!

1109
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,800
I think we set up everything.

1110
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,960
I tell you what,
now that we are in Milano,

1111
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,710
why don't we go and see
this famous Colosseo?

1112
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,690
No way with the Colosseo.

1113
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,260
You have to take care of my son's problem.

1114
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,730
I'll take care of it, as I told you.

1115
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,540
I go and speak with this girl, two words that...

1116
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:44,110
I've said enough.

1117
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:45,370
Enough?

1118
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,180
What do you mean with this 'I've said enough'
and you always say nothing?!

1119
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,480
What do you think?
that speaking is enough?

1120
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,780
What idea did you get?

1121
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,770
You think she's a woman worth nothing?!

1122
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,020
That's a woman of high rank.

1123
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,240
This problem needs money,
a lot of them.

1124
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,530
And we have brought money with us,
by luck.

1125
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,900
-I have brought.
-You have brought.

1126
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,100
Did you bring that basket?

1127
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,080
We make this, in that basket,

1128
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,810
we put all the money,

1129
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,290
then we write a nice covering letter,

1130
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:14,210
and we bring it to her.

1131
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,040
I wanna come with you.

1132
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,250
No, you go and take some rest
because you're tired.

1133
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:23,250
Lucia, go! Let us do it,
we are the men!

1134
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,010
Lucia, are we men or are we not?

1135
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:25,930
Aren't we men?

1136
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:28,220
What did your brothers come for,
otherwise?

1137
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,820
Man, paper, inkpot and pen, c'mon!

1138
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,550
Come on, let's write.

1139
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,260
Did you write?

1140
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,150
-A moment!  -C'mon, start!

1141
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,820
Paper, inkpot and pen.

1142
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,490
Miss

1143
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,520
Miss!

1144
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,860
-Where is she?  -Who?
-The miss.

1145
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,630
What miss?

1146
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,140
You said 'Miss'

1147
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:02,940
Did a miss come in?

1148
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,110
-Come in!
-Beast! Miss!

1149
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,060
It's the letterhead

1150
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,360
of the letter.

1151
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,270
What was wrong with that 'Miss' you wrote?

1152
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,240
Miss

1153
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:25,050
We come... we come... we...

1154
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:28,270
with this letter of mine to tell you

1155
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,750
'Totellyou' one single word: totellyou!

1156
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,530
to tell you one single word.

1157
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,850
-That.  -That.

1158
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,690
-That.  -That.

1159
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:44,020
-What?  -One 'that'?

1160
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:45,750
One 'that'!

1161
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:47,800
-That.  -That.

1162
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,200
You will forgive us if they are not enough.

1163
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:52,300
-That.  -That.

1164
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,420
You will forgive us if they are not enough.

1165
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,610
But 700,000 lire

1166
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:00,260
semi-colon, are

1167
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:06,380
are for us, expecially 'cause this year

1168
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:07,640
one single word

1169
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,910
thisyear

1170
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:14,740
there has been a big pestilence of the cows,

1171
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:18,460
as you surely know.

1172
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,710
Dot! Colon!

1173
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,760
Yeah, let her see we abound.

1174
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:26,130
Abbondantis adbondandum.

1175
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:30,490
This money are for

1176
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,960
This money are for

1177
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,210
This money are for your comfort.

1178
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,120
Write faster.

1179
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,860
-Co-m-f...  -For your comfort.

1180
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,320
I thought it was 'for your comfit'.

1181
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,490
Don't interrupt me that I lose the thread.
I've it all in my mind!

1182
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:49,870
I thought it was the comfit.

1183
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,140
from the sorrow

1184
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:56,080
from the sorrow you shell have

1185
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:58,060
shell have

1186
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,660
shell have

1187
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,880
yes, it is, it's feminine.

1188
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,680
shell have for the reason why

1189
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,150
why

1190
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,300
I don't know

1191
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:08,690
What you don't know?

1192
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,660
-Why what?  -What?

1193
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,820
The reason why! The sorrow because!

1194
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:17,220
It's the adjective for sorrow, isn't it?

1195
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,960
because

1196
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,410
you must leave

1197
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,170
our nephew

1198
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,830
because his uncles,
that's us ourself personified,

1199
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:38,730
What are you making, a slog,
that you dry your sweat?!

1200
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:42,030
that's us ourself personified,

1201
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,470
send you this

1202
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:51,690
because the lad

1203
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,630
is student who studies

1204
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,860
that has to gradate

1205
01:04:58,410 --> 01:04:59,510
gradate

1206
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:00,330
gradate

1207
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:04,220
that has to keep his head
screwed in the same way

1208
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:05,250
that means

1209
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,710
in the right way.

1210
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,060
Dot, semi-colon, dot, semi-colon.

1211
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,850
It's too much.

1212
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,880
Let it be.

1213
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,480
She won't say we're from the countryside,
that we are stingy.

1214
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:20,180
But it's too much.

1215
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,180
Yours unfaithfully

1216
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,410
yours unfaithfully,

1217
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:28,420
hurry up,

1218
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,700
the Caponi brothers,

1219
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,110
that is us.

1220
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,710
Open bra!

1221
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:42,260
Open a bra and say 'That is us',
the Caponi brothers.

1222
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,600
Did you open the bra?

1223
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,480
Close it.

1224
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:48,930
Here it is.

1225
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,890
Did you wanna add something?

1226
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,780
I think there's no need.

1227
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,570
Fold it. Come on!

1228
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,030
Quick!

1229
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,810
Close it. Let's go!

1230
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,170
-Lucia, we are going!
-We're out!

1231
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,430
Be careful!

1232
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:44,980
Love?

1233
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:45,510
Dear?

1234
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:46,500
Are you going out?

1235
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,650
Yes, I'm going to the theatre.

1236
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:48,650
I have the dree rehearsal.

1237
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,910
Do you come back here before the show?

1238
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,310
I'm afraid it's not possible.

1239
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:54,040
Then I'll come to take you
when it's over.

1240
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,410
No, better not,
you waste a lot of time.

1241
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:59,020
Is there some particular reason
you don't want me in the theatre?

1242
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:03,280
When the show is over, I come back
and we go to dinner together.

1243
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,570
Listen, my love,

1244
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:06,840
you don't tell any lies, do you?

1245
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,230
Lying to you?!

1246
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,430
Never!

1247
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:25,120
-Bye.  -Bye.

1248
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,640
Beautiful, isn't it?

1249
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,640
What is it? The town hall?

1250
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,300
The town hall? What are you saying?

1251
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,310
This may be the Scala Theatre of Milano.
[Scala = Ladder]

1252
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,320
And where is it?

1253
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:50,990
What?

1254
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:51,760
The ladder.

1255
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,980
It will be inside, won't it?

1256
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,280
-Beautiful, it looks like it's real.
-Looks? It is real!

1257
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,540
This is Etruscan style.

1258
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,120
It's a half oval. A half oval.

1259
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:04,540
This country is so big,
that I can't find myself.

1260
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,950
What do we do?

1261
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:09,900
We should find someone to ask
for this Marisa Floriani's address.

1262
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,560
Let's ask that soldier over there.

1263
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,590
That one? Are you crazy?

1264
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,620
He could be an Austrian general.

1265
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,040
What's the problem. We're allied.

1266
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:19,490
Are we? Yes, that's true. We are allied.

1267
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,450
-Excuse me.   -Ouch!
-Stay far.

1268
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:34,800
Excuse me,

1269
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,180
-do you live here?
-Yes, please.

1270
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:37,060
-Do you live here?
-Yes,

1271
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,390
I live here, why?,
did you think I was German?

1272
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,210
You are German? I told you he was.

1273
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:43,290
-And what do we do now?
-Let me speak, don't worry.

1274
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:47,410
-Do you speak it?
Of course, I had a friend prisoner in Germany.

1275
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:49,970
Let me speak,
otherwise I wander from the point.

1276
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:51,230
Well...

1277
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:56,340
-Nojo...
-What?

1278
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:57,760
He understands!

1279
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,230
-What did he say?
-I tell you later.

1280
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:00,150
Nojo...

1281
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:03,480
voule... voulevam... voulevons

1282
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,590

1283
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,880
Nojo voulevan savoir l'indiriss

1284
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,520
Ja?

1285
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:13,220
You have to speak Italian
because I can't understand you.

1286
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:18,880
He speaks Italian! He speaks Italian!
Congratulations! Bravo!

1287
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,320
Excuse me,

1288
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,190
Where did you think you were?
This is Milano.

1289
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:23,130
Yes, precisely, I know.

1290
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,020
We would like to know

1291
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,790
to go where we have to go,

1292
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,210
where do we have to go?
It's just an information.

1293
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,120
-Listen,
-Sir, yes, sir.

1294
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,680
If you want to go the sanitarium,

1295
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,980
-I will lead you.
-Yes, sir.

1296
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:43,560
I can't believe.

1297
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,850
Where are you from? Bergamo?

1298
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,920
He didn't understand a word.

1299
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,000
Do you know what we do?

1300
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:54,530
This is the main square.

1301
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,770
Let's sit here and she will pass by.

1302
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,610
Are you crazy? This isn't a village.

1303
01:09:58,620 --> 01:09:59,560
This is a big city.

1304
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,310
-What do we do then?
-Come with me, trust me, come with me.

1305
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:03,910
What is that?

1306
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:05,760
That may be the Titus' arc.

1307
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,720
-Isn't it dangerous?
-No, it isn't.

1308
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:09,630
It is so tall.

1309
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,660
Excuse me, who are you looking for?

1310
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,070
Miss Florian.

1311
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,050
You're here, at last!

1312
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:39,690
Listen you got to iron this,
Last changing room, n.10.

1313
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:41,340
Quick, girls, it's late!

1314
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,970
This time we'll be fined.

1315
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:45,410
I'll make him a smile
and he won't fine us.

1316
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,170
-All because of you.
-Easy, easy, let's go.

1317
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,010
At last you came, what happened?

1318
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,600
Come in.

1319
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:02,580
May I?

1320
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,240
The ironer. Come in, come in.

1321
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,100
Come inside.

1322
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,710
You'll find everything over there.

1323
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,630
D'you know what I'm telling you?

1324
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,020
Everyone has his own ideas.

1325
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:16,140
Yes, but in the end there's
only one thing that matters.

1326
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,150
Money!

1327
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,790
If you don't have anything better.

1328
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,850
Falling deeply in love must be
a real disgrace for you.

1329
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,790
I think it's a fortune.

1330
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,630
Excuse me, who is Miss Florian?

1331
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:29,730
It's me.

1332
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,070
Why?

1333
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:33,610
No, nothing.

1334
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,520
I think the iron is hot now.

1335
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,920
Yes, yes, it is.

1336
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:39,530
Hi Marisa.

1337
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:40,820
A telegram from New York.

1338
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,970
The producers will probably come tonight.

1339
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,520
I appeal to you.

1340
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:47,350
I've already told you
that I won't come to South America.

1341
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,560
Ok, ok, we will see.

1342
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,720
Marisa, would you ruin our careers, too?

1343
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,790
Anyway, do me a favour,
be kind to them.

1344
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,180
Induce them to sign.

1345
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,310
I will finish them after.

1346
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,540
Marisa, please, we depend on you.

1347
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,510
Alright, what a drag!

1348
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,240
Please, the tulle petticoats must be very stiff.

1349
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,890
Alright, you'll be attended, Miss.

1350
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,740
What a nice Milanese accent!

1351
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,150
We, people from Napoli have a good ear.

1352
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,470
We need just a few hours
and we learn.

1353
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,190
Anyway, I adore the people from Napoli.

1354
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,500
But I'm from the countryside.

1355
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:24,620
Them expecially.

1356
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,960
Maybe it's because I've a special reason.

1357
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,370
Are you engaged to
some young man from there?

1358
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,070
Did I guess?

1359
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:36,180
Some nice, very rich, generous young man.

1360
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:37,540
All true.

1361
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:39,020
He's the best man in the world,

1362
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,300
Only he is not rich, he's a student.

1363
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,630
A student, o Lord,
what are you saying?

1364
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:45,360
Sorry, but I am an old woman,

1365
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,270
I could be your mother,

1366
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,150
why do you want a moneyless
student to marry?

1367
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:52,280
But I earn enough for two

1368
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:55,050
Now you wanna offend that poor young man.

1369
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:57,290
Do you think he'll accept to live with your money?

1370
01:12:58,030 --> 01:12:59,660
Then we will live with his few.

1371
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,280
It's so easy to say...

1372
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,710
Marisa, would you lend me your greasepaint?

1373
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:07,530
-You always need something.
-That's it...

1374
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:16,650
So, you could leave everything for him.

1375
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,740
The theatre, the luxury.

1376
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:21,780
When you fall in love, madam...

1377
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,870
You're in deep trouble, my dear.

1378
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:29,080
Either you ruin him,
or you ruin yourself.

1379
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:31,990
Sorry, but I'm speaking from the heart.

1380
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:36,010
I'd like to know why people thinks we are special.

1381
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:39,870
Why? Can't I fall in love and marry me
like all the other girls?

1382
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:42,080
Miss, you're really nice,

1383
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,000
but, see, there is a reason.

1384
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,420
For example, can you roll out the dough?

1385
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:48,340
No.

1386
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,830
If your husbands gets
an ink stain on his jacket,

1387
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:53,290
do you know how to wash it?

1388
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,470
No.

1389
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:56,750
Have you ever made a washing?

1390
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,130
No, I've never made it.

1391
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,570
But I'll learn, and a lot of other things.

1392
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:04,470
And there's one thing you reasonable
people will never learn.

1393
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:06,170
What really loving each other is.

1394
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,030
You can't even imagine it.

1395
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,650
I love my boyfriend more than my life.

1396
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,380
I could even be a maid,
for his love.

1397
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,650
Ok, don't get angry.

1398
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,150
I've spoken this way cause I'm a mother.

1399
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:22,010
Miss, there's this gentleman,
do I let him in?

1400
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,050
Ambrogio, I've told you not to let in anybody.

1401
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:26,540
But this is an Earl.

1402
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:30,350
I told you no one, except Mr. Gianni,
but he isn't coming tonight.

1403
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,320
Are you married, aren't you?

1404
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,640
I'm widow.

1405
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:40,860
Did you know how to make everything
when you got married?

1406
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,590
But we were of the same condition.

1407
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,460
Who do you think I am?

1408
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:49,480
Ny father was a village vet,
and he will be doctor, soon.

1409
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,890
He will be it if he studies.

1410
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:53,470
What do you think he's doing now?
Studying.

1411
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,160
I he doesn't study, I don't wanna see him.

1412
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,100
Do you need it now?

1413
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:03,680
My dress! Yes.

1414
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,430
Is it okay like this?

1415
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:07,470
Yes, good!

1416
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,520
How beautiful you are!

1417
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:18,350
Now I understand why that student
lost his mind for you.

1418
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:20,430
I lost it, too.

1419
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,940
I'd make any sacrifice for Gianni's happiness.

1420
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:26,090
His name is Gianni.

1421
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:34,090
Good evening, miss.

1422
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:35,520
How much I owe you?

1423
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,240
Nothing.

1424
01:15:58,030 --> 01:15:58,850
Come, it's here.

1425
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,170
I think it's here.

1426
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,530
-At last!
-I can't walk anymore.

1427
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,710
Yes, this is the stage.

1428
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:08,240
Let's hope to find her.

1429
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,450
Gentlemen, you can't stay here.

1430
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:11,830
So sorry.

1431
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:15,400
You can't stay there, too.

1432
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:17,760
And you can't smoke.

1433
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:21,900
And you can't go in.

1434
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:24,660
And you can't speak.

1435
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,120
Dear man, you are exaggerating, aren't you?

1436
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,710
Don't go in, don't smoke,

1437
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:29,880
don't speak,

1438
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,210
I think this is too much.

1439
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,560
Tell us what we can do.

1440
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:37,710
First you have to tell me who you are,
what you want and what you look for.

1441
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:39,540
What is this? A road block,
a frontier, a border?

1442
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,270
Sorry, sorry, you're always behind...

1443
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:44,910
There's more freedom in our country!

1444
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:45,760
Unconditional.

1445
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,020
But maybe you are the people from...

1446
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,220
-Abroad!
-From the South.

1447
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:50,840
I'm so sorry.

1448
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,940
Miss Florian is waiting for you.

1449
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,800
I hadn't realized.

1450
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,480
Where is Miss Florian?

1451
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:01,120
At the end of the corridor, on the right.

1452
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,480
Changing room n.10.

1453
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:08,600
-Next time we will see in our country...
-Let it go!

1454
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:10,350
Who are they? The producers
from South America?

1455
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,370
Yes, it's them.

1456
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,590
Don't be a troublemaker.

1457
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:20,440
Good evening gentlemen.

1458
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:23,200
Remember me,
I'm the one who dances on tiptoe.

1459
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,900
-Where do you dance?
-On tiptoe.

1460
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,500
She says she dances on tiptoe...
Lucky her!

1461
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,860
And I'm the one that does
the splits in the 2nd act.

1462
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,210
That does the splits in the 2nd act.

1463
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:34,280
-What does it mean?
-Are you asking to me?

1464
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:41,650
-Two plus two is... is?
-Four!  -Four!

1465
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:51,870
She says if you are thirsty
and want an olive.

1466
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,490
-No, thanks.  -No, thanks.

1467
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:54,500
Enjoy your meal.

1468
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,040
Buenasera senor.

1469
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:58,180
Would you give me a cigarette?

1470
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,390
I don't smoke.

1471
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:01,800
If you want to take a puff...

1472
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,910
Another laugh near the pipe.

1473
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:09,290
Unfortunately,
you won't see much of me tonight.

1474
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,870
They cut my part.

1475
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,260
What did they cut?

1476
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,710
The part, the part.

1477
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:14,720
Which one?

1478
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,850
The best one.

1479
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:19,500
-It's a pity so young...
-I'm so sorry for you.

1480
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,400
-Marisa, they are here.
-Who?

1481
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,550
The producers, the SouthAmericans,
they are so boorish!

1482
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:26,560
Ok, let them in.

1483
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,180
Please, come in.

1484
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,600
-Here we are.
-Please, adelante, adelante.

1485
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,000
Adelaide! Adelaide!

1486
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,330
No, please, do come in,
please, please, come in.

1487
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:43,400
Muy encantada, please,
take a seat,

1488
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,800
forgive the mess of my room,
but it's work, you know.

1489
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,980
You must forgive my Spanish but
I was in Barcelona a short 'tiempo'.

1490
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:55,930
But you speak a little Italian, don't you?

1491
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,890
Sometimes yes, sometimes not.

1492
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,420
Not the Latin, not the Latin.

1493
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,970
-Well, miss...
-Well

1494
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,510
A moment, I'll speak
because I'm the elder.

1495
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:10,820
Miss, with no offense,
we are serious persons.

1496
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:13,150
persons that...
here we are.

1497
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,230
I know, the vice-consul of Paraguay
told me a lot about you.

1498
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:18,580
-Who's him?
-Paraguay?

1499
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,120
Do you know this guy?

1500
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:22,680
He must be someone we met by chance.

1501
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:26,800
Indeed, nobody says bad things about us.

1502
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,100
We were waiting for you,
we got your telegram.

1503
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,810
Did you send a telegram?

1504
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:35,680
-Who sent this telegram?
-I didn't!  -Neither did I!

1505
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,830
-Who sent it?
-It must have been someone for you.

1506
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,850
-Who can he be?
-Mezzacapa!

1507
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,330
He never minds his own business.

1508
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:44,670
That one! You don't know Mezzacapa!

1509
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:46,920
By the way, we want to deal with
the conditions, don't we?

1510
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:47,990
Which conditions?

1511
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:50,200
The financial conditions.

1512
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,000
Here we have som...

1513
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,200
It's not the right time,
not the right time.

1514
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,480
Let's hear.

1515
01:19:56,730 --> 01:20:00,650
I have many expenses, the dresses,
the costumes, my life tenor...

1516
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,560
Also the tenor?

1517
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:02,560
Is there a tenor, too?

1518
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:05,050
Ok, it means that we'll provide
for the tenor as well.

1519
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:06,310
Did you bring some small change?

1520
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:07,860
I will speak with the tenor, ok?

1521
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:10,230
I wanted to ask you:

1522
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,110
Are things quiet in the South?
No revolutions a-coming?

1523
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:18,040
Are we joking?
Revolutions in the South?

1524
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:21,610
Because I read in the newspapers
about some movement...

1525
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,750
Even this they put in the newspapers!

1526
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:26,890
-The journalists...  -That is nonsense,
nothing to be worried about.

1527
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:31,220
That has to do with our enemy,
Mezzacapa.

1528
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,250
So, you are interested in politics.

1529
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,680
Sometimes, we break his windows.

1530
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:40,020
Break his windows, but we're joking.

1531
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:43,770
-And he shoots us.  -He's a hunter,
so he shoots us.

1532
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,900
And Gianni... you know.

1533
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,560
Gianni?

1534
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,800
What does Gianni have to do with this?

1535
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,810
He does. Gianni is our nephew.

1536
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:55,410
How? So you are...

1537
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,270
Gianni's nephews.

1538
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,920
Nephews' Giannis.

1539
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,650
The nephew... We are the neph...
the nephew...

1540
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,510
Gianni has a nephew...

1541
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:04,830
And who is this nephew?

1542
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,020
-Speak!  -Speak!

1543
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:07,380
Excuse him.

1544
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:08,720
He makes me confuse.

1545
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,090
We are Gianni's uncles.

1546
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:12,540
Gianni is nephew to us.

1547
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:14,870
-To me.  -To the Caponi.

1548
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:16,840
Gianni's uncles!

1549
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:20,760
How didn't I recognize you immediately?!

1550
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,430
It's not so easy, we are in disguise.

1551
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:24,380
In civvies.

1552
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:27,370
I wonder what Gianni will say when he sees you.

1553
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,060
You, you are Uncle Peppino.

1554
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,580
And you are Uncle Antonio.

1555
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:34,570
-And how is Mom Lucia?
-Fine, thanks.

1556
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:35,180
I'm happy.

1557
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,050
-Well, here there is..
-Oh, thanks!

1558
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,530
Are they for me?

1559
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:39,250
"IRIS" FIGS

1560
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,450
You are so kind, very kind.

1561
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:44,030
Miss? On stage!

1562
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:48,480
I'm coming! Sorry, but I must go,
I must leave you.

1563
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,760
But sit here!
Sorry I gotta run.

1564
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:53,500
Did you understand?

1565
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,440
Did you understand?

1566
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,050
She's on the run. I wonder
what else she has done.

1567
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:57,950
Where does she go?

1568
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:58,760
How do I know?

1569
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,040
If you were not my brother,

1570
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,370
I would beat you.

1571
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,080
Why?

1572
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,140
You didn't make me talk.

1573
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:06,080
She didn't let us talk.
She did it on purpose.

1574
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,080
She didn't, yes, she didn't.

1575
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:08,520
What do we do now?

1576
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,360
What do we do now? We go.
What do you wanna do?

1577
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:11,570
Going, uh?

1578
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,340
The basket with the money and the letter is there.

1579
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:16,990
When she comes in, after her flingery,
her fling, she comes back,

1580
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,780
she opens and reads all the...

1581
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,410
I made my point, ok?

1582
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:22,860
And what are we gonna do?

1583
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,930
We are in Milano.
Aren't we gonna have fun?

1584
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,390
-And Lucia?  -Lucia... Just half an hour,
a bit of fun and we go home.

1585
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:36,230
I've seen that blond one there
winking to me!!

1586
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:38,110
Be serious!

1587
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,250
She locked us up.

1588
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:50,630
How stupid you are! How stupid you are!

1589
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:51,630
C'mon, cheer up!

1590
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:53,590
Do you know what we do now?

1591
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,860
We invite all those pretty girls at dinner with us.

1592
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:02,310
-Don't be louse!  -All of them?
-All of them, shame on you!

1593
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,270
In a town abroad, that's the way to be.
Being magnanimous to each other.

1594
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,240
In your pocket, how much do we have?

1595
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:12,860
We must come back home, remember.

1596
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,610
We'll do it somehow.

1597
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,260
No joking!

1598
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:16,790
They are coming, don't speak,
never speak! Here they are.

1599
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,920
Your plans for tonight, caballeros?

1600
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,410
We want to have some fun.

1601
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:24,680
Every night, after the show,
we have dinner at Grand Milan.

1602
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:26,990
If you want to give us this honour,
we'll have a good laugh all together.

1603
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:30,710
We'll have the time of our life.

1604
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:35,250
So, go ahead, order a pretty nice dinner,
and when the show is over we join you.

1605
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:51,430
Please.

1606
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,610
-What are you doing? What's up?
-My hat, my hat!

1607
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:58,970
It's the custom!

1608
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:00,730
-Custom?
-Didn't she give you this?

1609
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:02,940
-Do I have to put this on my head?!
-No, you put your hat on it.

1610
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:03,990
She took it!

1611
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,880
But she gave you this.

1612
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,180
-And where do I put it?
-In your pocket.

1613
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,160
Look at me, would you give one
even to me, miss?

1614
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,510
-Please!  -It's the custom.
This is the receipt.

1615
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:16,230
Shut up!

1616
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,130
Good evening, gentlemen.

1617
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,040
Good evening. Do you know him?

1618
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:21,690
-No.  -He saluted me.

1619
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:24,830
They are polite in Milano, salute him!
Good evening, good evening.

1620
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,050
How many gentlemen?

1621
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:28,160
-How many?  -Gentlemen.

1622
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:30,880
We don't know how many gentlemen
there are in Milano.

1623
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,000
No, I mean you, you.

1624
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,730
-Us? How many are we?
We are two!

1625
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,680
We are the Caponi brothers.

1626
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:40,380
I'm the elder, he's the second one.

1627
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:42,590
A table for two, then.

1628
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,590
No, we are waiting for those girls of the...

1629
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:49,180
Those that... those that...
the vaudeville, ok?

1630
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:50,530
Those in fancy-dress.

1631
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:51,940
I got it, I got it.

1632
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:54,400
Then, in the upper parlour. Please.

1633
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,070
It's that, it's that.

1634
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,920
Would you gentlemen wait?

1635
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:37,960
-We wait.  -We wait.

1636
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,110
Good night.

1637
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,580
Hi!

1638
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:03,030
Marisa, have you seen the Duke in the stalls?

1639
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:04,980
I guess he's in Milano for us.

1640
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,750
I've seen him, I've seen him.

1641
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:10,440
My dear, if you used your brain,
you'd come at dinner with us tonight.

1642
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,780
Don't you know he is crazy after you?

1643
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:15,770
Please, Gabriella, stop with all this stuff!

1644
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,300
Do you know who came to meet me tonight?

1645
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,430
Gianni's uncles.
Two simpletons, but very, very nice.

1646
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:23,500
I left them here, when I was back,
they have gone away.

1647
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,190
They were so confused.

1648
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,120
They brought me a basket from the countryside.

1649
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:30,320
Look, it must be there.

1650
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:53,620
Why are you laughing? What's the matter?

1651
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,830
So when are this girls coming?
They are late!

1652
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:40,180
Late... What are they,
the train from Battipaglia?

1653
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:41,650
Late...

1654
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:48,060
This is a luxury eatery.
We'll lose our life here.

1655
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,470
We'll lose our life! We'll lose our life!

1656
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:53,170
Peppino, I'd beat myself!

1657
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:55,410
Skinflint!

1658
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,560
By all means,

1659
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:59,300
in for a penny, in for a pound!

1660
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:03,940
Indeed, a dinner for 6-7 people,
how much can it be?

1661
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:05,210
2-300,000 lire!

1662
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:09,880
2-300,000 lire? Are you crazy? Who has them?

1663
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:12,020
-Who has them?!
-Yes, who has them?

1664
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,090
How much do you have?

1665
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:15,660
-I have 20,000 lire.
-20,000 lire?

1666
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,010
You wretch, why didn't you tell me before?

1667
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,980
Now we call the waiter and we make a deal
for a dinner at cost price.

1668
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:31,380
Let's make this deal, first.

1669
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:32,340
Let me do.

1670
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,130
Waiter!

1671
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:44,330
Morons...

1672
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:48,420
He comes immediately.

1673
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:50,660
Good evening gentlemen.

1674
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:53,510
Good evening, commander.

1675
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:54,420
What do you gentlemen need?

1676
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:56,240
We wanted to talk to the waiter.

1677
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:58,200
Precisely, I am the maitre.

1678
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:00,380
-What did he say?
-He is a metre.

1679
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:03,490
A metre?
He doesn't look his highness.

1680
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:06,190
Nice to meet you. Please, take seat.

1681
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:08,350
Take seat, don't stand.

1682
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:09,180
Thank you, gentlemen, I cannot.

1683
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,550
You're the welcome, come on!

1684
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:13,410
-He says he cannot.
-If you can't...

1685
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:15,920
We do sit down, because we're a bit tired.

1686
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,400
What do you gentlemen were saying?

1687
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,430
-Can we speak freely with you?
-Please.

1688
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:23,710
We have a meeting with some girls.

1689
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,650
-So, we'd like to organize a dinner...
-I understand!

1690
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,410
-a dinner that is...
-I understand!

1691
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:34,180
I'm here to counsel our customers.
I am the counsellor.

1692
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,850
You are the Councillor!
Very pleased to meet you!

1693
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:38,840
May I, Mr Councillor?
Very pleased to meet you!

1694
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,030
-My brother.  -Bighead.

1695
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:42,020
We are the Bigheads brothers.

1696
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,720
-Take seat! Don't you want?
-Please, gentlemen.

1697
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,590
We are sorry that you stand.

1698
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:49,490
Then, a cold dinner or a hot one?

1699
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:53,910
-Hot, hot, hot!
-A tepid one...  -A hot one!

1700
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,040
How many persons are you?

1701
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,820
-Well, we are two males...
-And five females.

1702
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:00,820
So, there's need of seven covers.

1703
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:04,260
-Seven covers?  -If we'd asked the tepid one,
there wouldn't have been need of them!

1704
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,290
Listen, Mr. Councillor

1705
01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:09,010
it's not so cold in Milano.

1706
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:12,170
Couldn't we eat without blankets,
in order to feel more free, fresh?

1707
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:16,070
You must be joking.
You can't eat without cover.

1708
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:19,710
Is it compulsory?  -The rules...
-It must be a custom in Milano.

1709
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:23,100
I'd suggest a tortoise soup as a starter.

1710
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:27,230
-One moment... How... how...
-Tortoise soup, yes!

1711
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:33,750
-Price?
-My brother is a price collector.

1712
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,300
He always wants to be informed, you know.

1713
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:36,430
How much is it?

1714
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:40,090
1,300 by 7 is 9,100 lire.

1715
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:41,950
A bit expensive, uh?

1716
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:43,560
No, no, let's skip the soup.

1717
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,360
One should always start with a soup.

1718
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,080
Ok, let's make a nice bean soup.

1719
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:51,250
Good! Great idea! Beans! For everyone!

1720
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:52,430
Trust me.

1721
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:56,860
I'll arrange a service you won't forget, nevermore.

1722
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:57,720
What?

1723
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:02,690
A service you won't forget, nevermore.

1724
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:03,500
Yes, sir.

1725
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,670
He'll really make us the 'service', uh?

1726
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:16,660
-He will.  -Have you seen his face?
So irritating. A real swine.

1727
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:17,920
He threatened us clearly.

1728
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:24,160
-How much do we have?
Make me see those 20,000 lire!

1729
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:26,340
Leave!

1730
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,460
Let's see these 20,000 lire, in case...

1731
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,010
They are only two, only two.

1732
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,210
Sometimes they stick together.

1733
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:36,770
Two, only two.

1734
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:39,340
We'd need a miracle.

1735
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:41,950
We'd need a miracle.

1736
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:48,110
St.Antonio of mine,
dear St.Antonio of mine,

1737
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:50,460
you who are such a miraculous saint,

1738
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:52,730
you who do 13 graces per day,

1739
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:53,850
do one grace for me.

1740
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:56,110
Don't let the girls come here.

1741
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:57,440
Here we are!

1742
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:02,000
St. Antonio, I thank you!

1743
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:06,490
Antonio! Peppino! We thought you were
the South American producers.

1744
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:08,550
-Is dinner ready?  -I could eat a horse!

1745
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:10,340
And I am thirsty... A lot of champagne for me!

1746
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:12,780
Leave it down!

1747
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:14,450
This is from Marisa.

1748
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:15,880
She returned the empties.

1749
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:18,130
No, no, there are the money!

1750
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:19,390
And she asked me to tell you

1751
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:22,940
she doesn't wanna know anything else
about your nephew and your dirty money.

1752
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:23,370
Don't touch!

1753
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:27,760
This is dirty money. Dirty!
Come on, let's eat!

1754
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,530
Councillor! Waiter!

1755
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:35,900
Vegetable soup! Tortoise soup!
Fish canape'!

1756
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:38,610
Champagne!

1757
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:06,150
Hello. 'Nuovo' Theatre, please.
The stage.

1758
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,050
Hello, it's 'Nuovo' Theatre.

1759
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:11,360
Excuse me, is Miss Florian still there?

1760
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,410
She's left already.

1761
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:15,030
Left? When did the show end?

1762
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:15,850
More than an hour ago.

1763
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:18,990
-Thanks.  -You're welcome.

1764
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:29,220
Come in.

1765
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:33,630
What is it? Thanks.

1766
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:46,930
"Gianni, don't ask me why,

1767
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,770
but we must take our own roads.

1768
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:49,670
Farewell, Marisa."

1769
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:33,170
Gianni!

1770
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,100
Hi.

1771
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:37,520
Hi, sit with us.

1772
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:45,430
This stupid brother of mine

1773
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:51,050
hid the money under a brick!

1774
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:53,540
I went there...

1775
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,350
-...and I nicked all his money!
-You rascal!

1776
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:03,900
There's not the sun in Napoli,
when you're not there.

1777
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,790
Not the moon, not the sea, nothing.

1778
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:07,780
-Shut up, I'm jealous!
-Well done!

1779
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,830
You cut a poor figure of yourself.

1780
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,220
If you had done to someone else

1781
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:46,220
what you did to me,

1782
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:50,010
this man would have killed you,

1783
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:53,110
and do you want to know why?

1784
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:56,670
Because over this world

1785
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,980
women like you

1786
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:04,380
shouldn't exist for a man

1787
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:08,110
that is honest like me.

1788
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:13,120
-Woman...
-Who's that boy? Do you know him?

1789
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:17,050
-you're an evil woman,
-No, I never saw him.

1790
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:20,370
you made these eyes cry

1791
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:24,580
tears and infamies.

1792
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:30,970
Woman, you're worse than a viper,

1793
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:35,250
you poisoned my soul,

1794
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:38,840
I can't live anymore.

1795
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:45,720
Woman, you're sweet as sugar,

1796
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:49,490
but this angel face

1797
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:53,340
is there to betray.

1798
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,930
Woman,

1799
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:03,130
you're the most beautiful woman,

1800
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:07,690
I love you and I hate you

1801
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:13,300
I can't forget you anymore.

1802
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:21,510
Woman, you're the most beautiful woman,

1803
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:26,940
I love you and I hate you,

1804
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:32,000
I can't

1805
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:40,770
forget you.

1806
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:48,890
-It's Gianni!  -It's a record!

1807
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,960
Gianni! Gianni!

1808
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,480
"Go and sleep because you are tired..."

1809
01:38:14,570 --> 01:38:15,470
"We are men..."

1810
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:17,490
"We get rid of her"

1811
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:19,960
And I trusted you, stupid me.

1812
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:21,320
Look there,

1813
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:23,960
look how they are reduced, look.

1814
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:29,150
You came to Milano to save your nephew,
didn't you?

1815
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:31,590
Lucia, don't shout, please!

1816
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:33,840
I' ve got the apathetical colics.

1817
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,160
Please, there's no shouting
with the apathetical colics.

1818
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:41,910
We saved our nephew in the end, didn't we?

1819
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:43,800
Nothing else matters.

1820
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:45,740
It was all tactics.

1821
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,740
It was a sort of strattregical manoeuvre.

1822
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:52,850
We made a fling...

1823
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,970
Why worrying? In the end, we are men.

1824
01:38:56,650 --> 01:38:57,660
I've said enough.

1825
01:38:58,810 --> 01:38:59,720
Shame on you!

1826
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:01,190
Why shame?

1827
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:06,250
How could I know
that I was popular in Milano?

1828
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:11,550
Don't make me laugh.
You are old and potty!

1829
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,330
The minor spoke.

1830
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:16,920
Peppino, my liver!

1831
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:21,550
It was all that alcohol we drank yesterday.

1832
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,570
Curacao, Bernocchi...

1833
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:27,940
Go to Hell!

1834
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:30,450
However, we reached our aim.

1835
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:32,630
We got rid of the girl.

1836
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:35,040
Got rid?

1837
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:39,600
The only words she deserved,

1838
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:42,330
you weren't able to tell her.

1839
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,150
You're really a good daughter.

1840
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,330
And this one is like her mom.

1841
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:55,640
Like her dad.

1842
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:59,910
Come to your dad.

1843
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:06,220
Our holidays are ending,
even this year.

1844
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:06,810
Are you sorry for that?

1845
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:09,980
In Napoli, you have no time for me
with the bloody clinic.

1846
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:13,550
-But, sometimes...
-A pizza together.

1847
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:18,500
Where is Gianni jr.?
I haven't been seeing him for an hour.

1848
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,850
Those two madcaps brought him on the calash.

1849
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:23,080
Where do they go with my son?

1850
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:24,350
Around.

1851
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:27,420
They tell they have to teach him
the family traditions.

1852
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:41,300
A liar woman has left me...

1853
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:43,960
-Did I hurt you?  -No.

1854
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:44,660
How not?

1855
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,230
Check out! Is he at the window?

1856
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:54,560
Throw the stone, come on.

1857
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,420
Strongly, come on, come on.

1858
01:41:13,970 --> 01:41:16,230
THE END
