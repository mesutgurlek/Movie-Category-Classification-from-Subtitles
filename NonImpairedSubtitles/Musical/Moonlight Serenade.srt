1
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:32,623
ś They say
that falling in love ś

2
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:35,760
ś Is wonderful ś

3
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:43,567
ś It's wonderful ś

4
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:50,775
ś So they say ś

5
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,588
ś To hold the girl
in your arms ś

6
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:08,759
ś Is wonderful ś

7
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,229
ś Wonderful ś

8
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:19,804
ś In every way ś

9
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:28,679
ś So they say ś

10
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:35,520
We develop short investments

11
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:39,823
by analyzing the level of
a particular stock's overvaluation,

12
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:41,959
then assigning a rating.

13
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,229
I don't need to know
your homework technique, son.

14
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,198
Give me something
I can chew on.

15
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,134
Don't worry, Mr. Beretsky,
I'm about to give you a mouthful.

16
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:53,237
According to the research
compiled by Miss Webster here,

17
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:56,207
more than 60 percent
of your current portfolio

18
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,209
is rated at mid-risk
to dangerous.

19
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,911
You can find weak spots
in any company.

20
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:04,449
None of this means anything
until we verify it.

21
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,951
These companies
have been stable for years.

22
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:09,053
Check out everything
if you want.

23
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:10,488
It'll take weeks.

24
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,123
Meanwhile,
state regulators

25
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:15,126
have investigations pending
on both Klasco and DeBridge,

26
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:18,196
which, I believe, are two
of your biggest holdings.

27
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,798
Due respect, sir, but
without some serious hedging,

28
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,001
you're ripe for a big fall,
and soon.

29
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:26,169
I've heard enough.

30
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:31,342
Carl, wait, uh, we have
other investment ideas.

31
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:32,910
Better ones.

32
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,813
Formulated
by better brokers.

33
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:37,315
Let me introduce you
to a few...

34
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:40,684
I'm not interested
in other brokers.

35
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:43,053
I like the way
he thinks.

36
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,033
That went
fantastically well.

37
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,602
Yeah, you think
Holtzman trusts me?

38
00:03:57,603 --> 00:04:00,104
Forget Holtzman
He isn't smart enough to trust you.

39
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02,039
Beretsky does.
That's what's important.

40
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,842
A whole new part of your life
is starting right now.

41
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,245
After this, it's only a matter of time
before there'll be

42
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,781
a handful of Carl Beretskys begging you
to take care of their money...

43
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:14,685
at the investment firm of
Nate Holden and Associates.

44
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,820
Well... Go on.

45
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:22,059
Go on. Get going.
No, wait. Here. Here.

46
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,894
Got it.

47
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:30,834
ś At last ś

48
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:35,606
ś My love has come along ś

49
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,014
ś And my lonely days
are over ś

50

Frank D., everybody,
right here at The House.

58
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:40,504
Stevie Cotter on guitar.
Tony Banda, Ramon Banda.

59
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,540
Our special guest this Friday
and Saturday, Khani Cole.

60
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,542
- Nate, where you going?
- I'm sorry, Frank. I gotta go.

61
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:46,377
Are we gonna see you
for an entire show?

62
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:48,178
You're lucky I could
stay for the set.

63
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:51,749
We got this new big shot client.
He has me up to my ears.

64
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,185
Alright. Well, did I tell you Junior's
starting private school next month?

65
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:58,856
Hey. Don't worry, Frank.
I'll take care of you.

66
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:00,557
All right.

67
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:29,286
ś

68
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,784
ś When I fall in love ś

00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:08,625

ś In love ś

72

ś In a restless world

73
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:39,656
ś Love is ended

ś You feel ś

ś That way too ś

93
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:10,307
Yes!

94
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:13,110
Yes, yes! Hil-Co.

95
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:18,516
I think we might have something here
with the reshuffling at Hil-Co.

96
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,619
Feels like a smoke screen to me, like
they're changing the band on the Titanic.

97
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,086
What do you think?

98
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,522
Sorry. What?

99
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,624
Did you read
the Hil-Co story?

100
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,659
Uh, no.
I haven't gotten to it yet.

101
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,795
Something about it feels right to me.

102
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,397
Sorry, Mr. Holden
has a phone call.

103
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:34,565
Take a message.

104
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,866
It's the police.

105
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,441
Nate Holden.

106
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:47,044
<i>Hi, Mr. Holden?
This is the Weehawken Police.</i>

107
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:49,813
<i>There was a break-in at a residence
that's registered in your name.</i>

108
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:52,716
We're gonna need you to come down here
and speak with the detectives.

109
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:55,285
As far as we can tell there's at least
three other houses

110
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:57,655
in your neighborhood
that were hit last night.

111
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:00,624
I don't know if you have an inventory
of your valuables or not.

112
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,027
No, this was
my mother's house.

113
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:05,829
There weren't
many valuables.

114
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,933
Well, as you can see, they turned
the house upside down pretty well.

115
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,068
- Yeah.
- Though there is a room down the hall

116
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:12,235
where the door's locked.

117
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,071
We're not quite sure
about that.

118
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:16,006
We could pop it open
and take a look, if you'd like.

119
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,474
No, no,
that's okay.

120
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,809
Nate, go take a look.

121
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:21,946
Thanks anyway.

122
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,147
Well, suit yourself.
Take a look around.

123
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:26,149
If you change your mind,
let me know.

124
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,818
Thank you.

125
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,453
Excuse me.

126
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:40,897
My God.

127
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,268
What?

128
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,646
I took this photograph.
You remember?

129
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,114
Yeah.

130
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,285
- Why isn't this at your apartment?
- I don't know.

131
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,821
- Well, here. Take it with you.
- Look!

132
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:11,294
I don't want to deal
with this right now.

133
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,965
Well, you're not just
gonna leave it here.

134
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,567
That's the plan.

135
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,821
Here you go.

136
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:41,525
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

137
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,129
Excuse me.
Are you Nate Holden?

138
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,798
- Yes.
- I thought so.

139
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,799
My father hates you.

140
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:53,637
Uh, did you and I date?

141
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:56,907
His hatred for you
is strictly professional.

142
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:59,810
Hi, I'm Marie Devrenier.
My father's Robert Devrenier.

143
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:02,112
The CEO of Duocon.

144
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:05,683
They had kind of
a rough patch last year.

145
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,985
Yes, which you rode
all the way to the bank.

146
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:11,121
Yeah. Look, uh, it's been
kind of a long day,

147
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:15,659
and I don't really like to talk
business while I'm here, so...

148
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,861
I'm sorry. Yeah.
Neither do I.

149
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:20,097
Would you like to have a drink
with me and my friends?

150
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:22,099
We won't talk business.
I promise.

151
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,602
Uh, maybe some other time.

152
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:28,305
Wow. You're not selling me
short, too, are you, Nate?

153
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,241
No, really,
it's nothing personal, and, um...

154
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:35,245
like I said,
hopefully some other time.

155
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:39,016
Okay. But I'm gonna
hold you to that.

156
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,717
Bye.

157
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:56,033
So, Nate, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

158
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,968
You free? I'll be
in your neighborhood.

159
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:00,771
"Chloe sings. The Last Stop".
Come on, Frank. I gotta work.

160
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:03,741
Ah, all right.

161
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,777
Is, uh, everything okay
between you and Charlene?

162
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,011
Of course. Why?

163
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:09,780
Oh, you know,
I'm just wondering why

164
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:13,183
you're wasting your time driving
halfway across the city on your night off.

165
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:16,019
- Who says it's a waste of time?
- Aw, come on, Frank.

166
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,988
There's got to be 2,000 girls
in this city

167
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:21,825
making up little postcards and singing
at rundown joints like the Last Stop.

168
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,526
And, okay,
maybe in the end,

169
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:26,764
one of two of them have got what it
takes to sing in a place like this,

170
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,766
but come on,
do the math.

171
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:33,603
The odds are a thousand to one
this girl is not wasting your time.

172
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:36,806
Have a good evening.
It's yours.

173
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:41,077
That's Chloe.
You didn't know that?

174
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:45,949
- No.
- You know, Nate, music isn't money.

175
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,752
Somebody gave me a shot once,
I wanna return the favor.

176
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:51,321
- That's the way it works.
- Excuse me.

177
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:54,858
Hey, Chloe. I think this
just came off your bracelet.

178
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:57,494
Oh. Thank you.

179
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,264
You need to apologize to her.

180
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:07,204
Excuse me.

181
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:13,142
Thank you.

182
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:18,248
Do you need a ride?
'Cause we're going across town.

183
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,217
No, Jesse'll be here
any minute. Thank you.

184
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:21,852
- Do you want us to wait?
- No, that's okay.

185
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,821
You guys go ahead.
I'll see you on Friday night?

186
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,156
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

187
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:28,491
Can I give you a ride home?

188
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,194
No, thanks.

189
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,998
Uh, all right,
I'll walk with you, then.

190
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,168
I'm fine.

191
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:40,503
Just leave me
alone, okay?

192
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:45,475
ś When I fall in love ś

193
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:49,713
ś It will be forever ś

194
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:56,086
ś Or I'll never fall ś

195
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:59,922
ś In love ś

196
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:04,527
Thank you.

197
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,929
Found that outside
my window.

198
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:09,966
Where you sang with me.

199
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:14,671
Look, I hope...

200
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:16,974
you didn't take what I said
before too personally.

201
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,442
- I...
- Ugh.

202
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:20,810
Hey!

203
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,312
Wait!

204
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:25,782
Look, I spend all day and most
of my nights predicting failure.

205
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,617
It's my job.
I'm very good at it.

206
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:29,819
- Well, I'm sorry for you.
- Well, I'm not.

207
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,188
I believe
in what I do, but...

208
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:35,125
I need music
to keep me sane.

209
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:36,860
That's why I go
to the club every night.

210
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,929
That's why I play
a song or two before bed.

211
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,963
It helps me...

212
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,434
I don't know,
it helps me keep in touch

213
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:47,170
with a part of my...

214
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,039
- A part of your soul?
- Yeah!

215
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,476
Yeah. Do you know how many drunken
confessions I hear from suits like you?

216
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,178
Every week.
"Oh, I hate my job.

217
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,448
I should have been a musician".

218
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,518
Look. You apologized,
and I accept your apology.

219
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,121
So let's stop this before it
gets any more annoying, okay?

220
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:06,122
But I'm not drunk.

221
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:09,225
And I'm not
confessing anything.

222
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:13,397
I just want you
to play music with me.

223
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,299
- That's...
- No, thanks.

224
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,468
- I don't do charity work.
- It wasn't charity work the other night.

225
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:22,105
No, it wasn't.
It was a vocal warm-up.

226
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:24,141
Excuse me?

227
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:27,410
I play a gig
near your house.

228
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:30,213
I was warming up.

229
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:33,083
You're a decent piano player, but there
are a lot of them in this city

230
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:35,752
that I should be playing with before you,
including my boyfriend.

231
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:38,221
Yeah, right.

232
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:39,823
- What is so funny?
- Come on.

233
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:42,392
You're walking home alone late
at night in this neighborhood?

234
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:47,030
There is no way
you have a boyfriend. No way.

235
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:49,399
Look, I don't have to prove
anything to you, Mister...

236
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,870
- Just call me Nate.
- But since you asked, here.

237
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,441
Photograph
doesn't prove anything.

238
00:17:57,442 --> 00:18:00,743
Here. You should
read the back.

239
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:03,413
It's kind of cute,
actually.

240
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,352
Anyway, this is
my building.

241
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,454
Thanks for
the walk home... Nate.

242
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:13,956
Yeah.

243
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:27,404
- Morning.
- Morning. You should take a look at this.

244
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:30,107
Okay, but before I forget,
this is Sunset-Western and DEK.

245
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,075
I'd like you to take
a look before lunch.

246
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:34,143
- Sure.
- And one more thing.

247
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:39,682
- I'm sorry about yesterday.
- Oh! Stop it. Stop.

248
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,918
- And I appreciate your concerns.
- Stop it.

249
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,221
No. Look.

250
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:46,923
I think I got a little overwhelmed
there for a couple of days,

251
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:50,293
but it's over and done with,
so thank you.

252
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:52,396
Well...

253
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,263
Come on!

254
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:03,073
They're lovely.

255
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:07,109
Speaking of which, this is
what Vogler gave us on Hil-Co.

256
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,849
That's it?

257
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:18,988
Don't waste
my time, David.

258
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,925
I know you have more on Hil-Co
than two quarterly breakdown sheets.

259
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,494
I did, but I don't anymore.

260
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:26,996
- Where is it?
- I honestly don't know.

261
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:29,199
Right.
You lost the research.

262
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,169
I don't have what you're looking for
You could check my files.

263
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,538
No, no. I'll let
Holtzman do it.

264
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,339
Wow.

265
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,975
You're first really big case,
and you're running to Holtzman

266
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:41,911
with some lame conspiracy theory
that I'm, what,

267
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:44,514
shredding documents?

268
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:47,584
Not the best show of poise
under pressure, kid.

269
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:50,220
I mean, you might want to do
your own research.

270
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,590
That is, if you don't find
what you're looking for here.

271
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:59,295
Life gets a lot easier when you're not
betting against people.

272
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,368
We should do lunch sometime.

273
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:07,471
Is Chloe coming on soon?

274
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,506
Yeah. Should be.
Comin' right up.

275
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:11,207
All right.

276
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,385
But I just talked to him.
He's gonna be here any minute.

277
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:25,589
- Don't lie to me.
- Please?

278
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,056
Look, I know
it's annoying,

279
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:29,726
but Jesse just needs to feel
like people are waiting on him,

280
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:31,128
but then he's fine.

281
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,163
Three nights in a row
he's been AWOL,

282
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:36,733
while you and I are
wasting our time here.

283
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:39,269
You gotta stop
doing this, Chloe.

284
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,338
What Jesse needs is help.

285
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:44,174
I know. I know.
If I...

286
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:46,509
From somebody
other than you.

287
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:49,746
You're too nice
to be in this business.

288
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:52,582
I can't afford
to lose this gig, Rudy.

289
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,920
Rudy...

290
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:19,141
- Hey, Rudy, how ya doin'?
- How ya doin'?

291
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:28,918
Good night.

292
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:53,976
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:56,779
Do you know
"In The Wee Small Hours"?

294
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,849
Uh... yeah.

295
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,819
Can you play it?
"A" flat?

296
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,188
Uh, well, actually,
I was just doing some work.

297
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:15,965
ś In the wee small hours
of the morning ś

298
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,637
ś While the whole wide world ś

299
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:24,974
ś Is fast asleep ś

300
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:27,944
ś You lie awake ś

301
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:33,283
ś And you think about the boy ś

302
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:36,553
ś And never ever think of ś

303
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:41,157
ś Counting sheep ś

304
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:44,060
ś When your lonely heart ś

305
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:48,732
ś Has learned its lesson ś

306
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,400
ś He'd be here ś

307
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:56,273
ś If only he'd call ś

308
00:22:56,274 --> 00:23:00,777
ś In the wee small hours ś

309
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:04,681
ś Of the morning ś

310
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:07,684
ś That's the time ś

311
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,721
ś You miss him most ś

312
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:18,061
ś Of all ś

313
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:28,504
Do you want a glass
of wine or something?

314
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,577
If you're still interested
in playing together,

315
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:37,914
I can be back here tomorrow night
at the same time.

316
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,119
Did something
happen to you?

317
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,423
Look, if you don't mind,
I'd like to keep this about music, okay?

318
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,693
Sure. Same time
tomorrow night?

319
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,696
Yeah, same time
tomorrow night.

320
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:00,370
Pick up a hundred thousand
on the first uptick.

321
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:03,206
- Ten thousand-share increments?
- Right. Now it's at 72 and a half.

322
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,408
- So, say we start at...
- Sixty-eight.

323
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:07,410
Exactly, and watch it
drop like a rock.

324
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:09,212
Good, good. That's great.

325
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:12,515
ś Love walked right in
and drove the shadows away ś

326
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:16,986
ś Love walked right in
and brought my sunniest day ś

327
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:21,257
ś One magic moment
and my heart seemed to know ś

328
00:24:21,258 --> 00:24:23,593
ś That love said hello ś

329
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,729
ś Though not a word
was spoken ś

330
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,667
ś One look and I forgot
the gloom of the past ś

331
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:35,037
ś One look and I had found
my future at last ś

332
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,576
ś One look and I had found
a world completely new ś

333
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,277
ś When love walked in
with you ś

334
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:43,780
So far we're
ahead of schedule.

335
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:45,214
Good.

336
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:47,517
We're gonna build it
around Hil-Co.

337
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:51,421
Hil-Co was Vogler's baby.
He give you any problems?

338
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:53,256
David's been great.

339
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,960
Thanks.

340
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:00,329
I'm gonna work
on these at home.

341
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:05,535
- Snappy.
- ś Ah ahh ś

342
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,003
Right.

343
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:09,939
Can I at least
give you cab fare?

344
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,176
No, I'm fine.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

345
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,841
Reinhardt, it's Holden.

346
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:48,678
Oh, boy, have I got a story to tell you
about a company called Hil-Co.

347
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:50,880
ś Love walked right in
and drove the shadows away ś

348
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:54,050
So, listen. Rumor has it that
you're shorting Hil-Co.

349
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,718
Where'd you
hear that?

350
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,521
Nate, come on.
Don't tease us.

351
00:25:58,522 --> 00:26:00,557
We pay our secretaries
good money for that.

352
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,860
ś love said hello though not
a word was spoken ś

353
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:05,694
You have a good night.

354
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:08,264
See you tomorrow.

355
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:12,168
ś One look and I had found
my future at last ś

356
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:13,703
ś One look ś

357
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:17,106
ś And I had found
a world completely new ś

358
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:20,042
ś When love walked in with you ś

359
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,989
Hey, Dot.

360
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:36,893
Oh. Excuse me.

361
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,102
- Cream?
- Oh, thank you, I...

362
00:26:46,103 --> 00:26:47,636
Say when.

363
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,541
Uh... when.

364
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,047
Sugar?

365
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,384
Oh. No. Thank you.

366
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:03,853
Sweet enough already, huh?

367
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,725
- Ready, Terry?
- Sure thing.

368
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:13,495
Have a great day.

369
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:24,874
These guys could hire
Superman to run their company,

370
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,876
and they'd still be looking
at 12 to 15 months...

371
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:28,511
of tough times.

372
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:31,180
Oh, yeah, we're talking about
years of dysfunction here.

373
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,417
- One minute.
- Right.

374
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:37,319
Uh, Jimmy, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

375
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,988
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

376
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,324
Nate, I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

377
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:45,028
Terrence Hill,
this is Nate Holden,

378
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:47,964
our brightest young
portfolio manager.

379
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:49,566
What a pleasure
to meet you.

380
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,968
Well, any friend
of David's is...

381
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:54,837
Terry is the CEO of Hil-Co.

382
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:59,008
So, this is where it all happens.

383
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:03,412
Word is you see our stock dropping
35 percent in the next two quarters.

384
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:05,448
We run
a family business.

385
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:08,484
When you tell the business world
we are mismanaged

386
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:10,319
or irresponsible,

387
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,421
not only are you doing
damage to our company

388
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:14,290
but to my family as well.

389
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,225
Well, facts are facts,
Mr. Hill.

390
00:28:16,226 --> 00:28:20,029
These people you love have made
a series of financial mistakes,

391
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,600
and this little ambush that
David has set up here for us

392
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:27,403
won't change that or the negative impact
it will eventually have on your stock.

393
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:29,305
Which you have
no qualms profiting from.

394
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:30,473
David, please.

395
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:32,742
This is not an ambush,
Mr. Holden.

396
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:35,044
- No...
- This is an invitation.

397
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:38,815
I'm here simply to invite you
to consider our approach,

398
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:41,150
to think as we do.

399
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:43,519
It's easy to focus on
the mistakes of the past.

400
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,857
But we believe the changes we've made
make us strong for the long term.

401
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:51,693
The question is whether you have
the foresight to believe it.

402
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:56,432
- Have a great day.
- Yes. Thank you.

403
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,568
An invitation.

404
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,505
Thank you, David.

405
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,715
Who is that man?

406
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:14,650
Terrence Hill.

407
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,985
Oh.

408
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,055
Uh, as in...

409
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:21,157
Hil-Co.

410
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:26,996
What happened?

411
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:28,731
He stuck up
for his company.

412
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:31,634
I can't figure out why David
is hell-bent on protecting them.

413
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:33,036
He's jealous.

414
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,837
You're young, you're single,
you're attractive,

415
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:36,906
and soon you'll be
twice as rich as he is.

416
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:38,908
- Come on.
- Shall I call for takeout?

417
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:42,378
No, no, I'm gonna grab
something later at home.

418
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:44,413
I don't want
to stay here too late.

419
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:47,283
But we're making
good progress, don't you think?

420
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:51,320
Yes, I suppose we are.

421
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:54,590
Good. Have a good night.

422
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:02,565
ś You go to my head ś

423
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:06,769
ś Like a sip of
sparkling Burgundy brew ś

424
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:11,174
ś And I find
the very mention of you ś

425
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:16,478
ś Like the kicker
in a julep or two ś

426
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:21,017
ś The thrill of the thought
that you might give a thought ś

427
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:24,754
ś To my plea
casts a spell over me ś

428
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:27,323
ś Still I say to myself ś

429
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:29,525
ś Get a hold of yourself ś

430
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:33,295
ś Can't you see
that it never can be ś

431
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:36,465
ś You go to my head ś

432
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:40,569
ś With a smile that makes
my temperature rise ś

433
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:45,074
ś Like a summer
with a thousand Julys ś

434
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:49,578
ś You intoxicate
my soul with your eyes ś

435
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:54,851
ś Though I'm certain
that this heart of mine ś

436
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:57,086
ś Hasn't a ghost of a chance ś

437
00:30:57,087 --> 00:31:01,891
ś In this crazy romance ś

438
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:07,329
- ś Oh, you go to my head ś
- ś You go to my head ś

439
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:25,714
ś You go ś

440
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:29,885
ś To my head ś

441
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,593
I should go.

442
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,964
Why? Because we
almost kissed?

443
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:47,503
We didn't almost kiss. We were just
in the moment of the song.

444
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:48,938
It's nothing personal.

445
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:51,240
Oh, come on.
Everything is personal with you.

446
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:54,310
Oh! Is everything
so simple to you?

447
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:57,246
"That's a waste of time".
"It's personal".

448
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,548
Does everything become black
and white when you have money?

449
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:03,519
- Can you tell me that?
- I guess I tend to think in absolutes.

450
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,188
My life isn't
like that, Nate.

451
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,290
Well, tell me
what it's like, then.

452
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:09,158
No, thank you.

453
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,227
Right.

454
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:15,331
Is there anyone you can tell?

455
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,100
- Huh?
- Fine.

456
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:22,638
I'm in love with somebody
who doesn't love themselves,

457
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:25,141
so it makes it hard
for them to love me.

458
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:29,178
And every day, because I love
this person, I lower my expectations

459
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:32,315
until just getting him
to sit upright and be alert

460
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:36,018
is... a really good day.

461
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:38,287
Actually, I think
I know how that feels.

462
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:40,089
Yeah, of course you do.

463
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,191
I'm sorry.
You don't know me either.

464
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:44,526
Let's just
keep it like that, okay?

465
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:49,565
On the night that Frank D.
showed up to hear me sing,

466
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,934
my piano player didn't.

467
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:54,770
And I can't afford
to lose that gig.

468
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,405
And you want me to help?

469
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:57,506
Yeah.

470
00:32:57,507 --> 00:32:59,441
It's, um...

471
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:02,111
on Wednesday night.

472
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:04,280
And it's late, so...

473
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:05,781
Right.

474
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,050
What's the big deal?

475
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:13,522
I... I don't play out.

476
00:33:13,523 --> 00:33:16,058
Why not? I thought you said
you wanted to play music together.

477
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:17,626
No, it's not
about that. I...

478
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:19,661
I don't like performing.

479
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:21,397
Can you make
an exception?

480
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:23,032
One night.
Three songs.

481
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:25,368
And what happens after that?

482
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:29,939
Well, then Frank D. gives me a gig
at The House, and I play with him.

483
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,473
Oh.

484
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,144
Frank D.'s coming.

485
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:36,912
Right.

486
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:43,085
Well, that's
why I came here

487
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:45,521
'cause I already
blew it with Frank D.

488
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:49,658
But I figured he was your friend and he'd
show up to hear you play.

489
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:51,093
You figured?

490
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:53,128
Yeah. Still personal?

491
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:58,434
That's just not gonna
work for me. I can't.

492
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:01,070
Oh, come on. I thought you wanted
to play music together.

493
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:03,072
Of course I wanna
play music together,

494
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:05,507
but I don't wanna be in
a position where I'm playing music

495
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:07,609
for the benefit
of someone else.

496
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,112
Especially not Frank D.

497
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:13,416
The guy doesn't even know that I play,
and that's the way I wanna keep it.

498
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:16,652
I can't believe that you don't get this.
Music is a gift.

499
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:18,754
Don't start
with that, please.

500
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:22,391
When somebody plays,
when Frank D. plays,

501
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,327
he is giving you
a piece of his soul,

502
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,663
and the greatest thing is to be able
to give that right back to him.

503
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:30,366
I've given back to Frank D.
more than a few times.

504
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:31,934
With what,
financial advice?

505
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:34,903
Is that what your soul
is made up of?

506
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:36,538
Is it?

507
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:40,843
What if it is?

508
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:44,646
Then I'm sure you're
very good at what you do.

509
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:08,437
ś Fool that I am ś

510
00:35:08,438 --> 00:35:12,574
- ś For falling... ś
- ś falling in love with you ś

511
00:35:13,743 --> 00:35:17,579
ś And fool that I am ś

512
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,750
ś For thinking
you love me too ś

513
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:24,120
ś You took my heart ś

514
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:30,192
ś Then played the part
of little coquette ś

515
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:33,162
ś And all my dreams
just disappeared... ś

516
00:35:33,163 --> 00:35:35,064
ś just disappeared ś

517
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:40,636
ś In all the smoke
from our cigarettes, oh ś

518
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:43,705
ś Fool that I am ś

519
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:48,144
ś For hoping you'd understand ś

520
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:51,914
ś And thinking you
would listen to ś

521
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:56,818
ś All the things
I had planned ś

522
00:35:56,819 --> 00:36:00,989
ś But we couldn't see
eye to eye ś

523
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,593
ś Darling, this is goodbye ś

524
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:07,263
ś But I still care ś

525
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:11,900
- ś Crazy little fool that I am ś
- ś What a fool I am ś

526
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,306
It's clear there are
gonna be cash-flow problems.

527
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:28,611
Yeah, I suppose. I guess I'm not sure
they can't weather the storm.

528
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:31,913
May I just point out to you
that Cytek is just as vulnerable

529
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:36,051
as Sunset-Western and DEK,
both of which are on the board.

530
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:40,356
Nate?

531
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:43,759
Nate, Angelica. Someone you might
want to say hello to.

532
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,827
You remember
Marie Devrenier.

533
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:48,964
Yes. We've met before.
Nice to see you again.

534
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:50,832
Likewise.

535
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:54,370
Miss Devrenier is here on behalf
of her father, Robert Devrenier.

536
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:58,807
CEO of Duocon.
Well, he must hate us.

537
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:01,502
He's over it. But now he'd like
to take his personal investments...

538
00:38:01,503 --> 00:38:02,778
in a new direction.

539
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:04,846
Which would be you, Nate.

540
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:07,849
If you're free this evening, I'd like you
to take Miss Devrenier to dinner

541
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,419
and convince her that her father's money
should be with us.

542
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,223
I'm sorry for the short notice, but my
father likes to wrap things up quickly,

543
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:17,059
and I'm headed out of the country
tomorrow for the next two weeks.

544
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,561
Sure, sure.

545
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,664
You're still ahead of schedule
on the Beretsky plan, right?

546
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:24,032
- Uh, well...
- Yes, we're ahead of schedule.

547
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:26,502
Good.
Then you're free.

548
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:29,438
I'll leave you two
to iron out the details.

549
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:32,508
Uh, Marie,
this is Angelica Webster.

550
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:35,110
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do?

551
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:40,616
Uh, just leave it open,
thank you.

552
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:47,623
- Angelica, it's fine.
- Why be fine when you can be perfect?

553
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:50,926
She's a beautiful girl.
And smart.

554
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:54,062
I don't know why
you're not more excited.

555
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:56,298
- You could use a woman in your life.
- Debatable.

556
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:59,067
- Oh, come on.
- I'm just not in the mood.

557
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:00,836
Well, find a way
to get there.

558
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:02,705
Devrenier would be
a huge client.

559
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:04,573
This girl could be
the key to your future.

560
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:07,243
So... do the right thing.

561
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,544
Which is what,
exactly?

562
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:12,481
Make her happy.

563
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,149
Go on.

564
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:22,124
ś

565
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,192
I'll take those. Here.

566
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:27,028
You just keep this part,
and I will, uh...

567
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:28,631
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

568
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,133
- Okay, great, great.
- Let's sit over here.

569
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,338
- I want to talk to you.
- Huh? I'm sorry.

570
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:39,908
- I want to talk to you!
- Sorry, I can't hear you.

571
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,145
Hey, come on.
Let's go.

572
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:46,948
- Here. Ticket.
- Thank you.

573
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,617
Just bring it
back later.

574
00:39:48,618 --> 00:39:51,720
Band is gonna take a short
break. They'll be right back.

575
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:53,722
Yeah, the band was great.

576
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,326
This is great,
guys.

577
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:08,537
So, Nate... tell us.

578
00:40:08,538 --> 00:40:11,873
Come on, please.
Stop with the questions, you guys.

579
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:14,310
Sorry. We're all
a little fascinated by you.

580
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,545
Yeah, we were all there
for "the rejection".

581
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:21,917
- Rejection?
- Oh, come on. You remember.

582
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:23,585
- Oh, that.
- Right.

583
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:26,588
<i>That doesn't happen
to Marie. Ever.</i>

584
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:28,890
What were
you thinking?

585
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:31,059
Well, I was thinking...

586
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,129
what a horrible mistake
I was making.

587
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,497
Right.

588
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:37,899
Smart boy.
Here's to that.

589
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,267
Cheers.

590
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:41,704
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

591
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,105
Cheers.

592
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:46,875
Great glasses.

593
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:53,314
ś

594
00:40:57,086 --> 00:40:59,120
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

595
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:01,489
- Have a good night.
- You, too.

596
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:04,525
Hey.

597
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:07,562
Ticket.

598
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:10,766
- Why are you so upset?
- I'm not upset.

599
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,601
- She's a client.
- Who's a client?

600
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:15,571
- The woman I'm with.
- You're with a woman?

601
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:18,607
Very funny. Look, I need to talk
to you about last night.

602
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:20,609
Please,
no more talking.

603
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,977
It's exhausting.

604
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:24,646
- Hey, you ready to go?
- Ticket?

605
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:27,015
Yeah, ready.

606
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:28,950
I'll see
you guys later.

607
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:32,654
Okay, huh? You two have a good time.

608
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:36,458
Here you go.
Have a good night.

609
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,059
Yeah, nice meeting you.

610
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:42,330
Next. Hi.

611
00:41:57,947 --> 00:42:00,348
What do you think?

612
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:04,586
Is this supposed
to prove a point?

613
00:42:04,587 --> 00:42:07,723
No. I thought it might be a nice
play-out on Wednesday night.

614
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:09,758
I was trying to tell you
at The House,

615
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:12,794
but you were too busy
not being upset.

616
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:17,132
- How's your client?
- I dropped her off.

617
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:23,672
So, you like
the music or not?

618
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:25,741
Well, it's not how
I would have done it.

619
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:27,309
So?

620
00:42:28,277 --> 00:42:30,846
So, I don't know.

621
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,615
You can't expect me
to just instantly like something

622
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:35,451
that's not what
I've been imagining. Sorry.

623
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,785
When you figure it out,
you know where I live.

624
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:44,425
Wait.

625
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:50,665
Will you
play it for me?

626
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:56,304
Yeah.

627
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,112
- Yeah.

Yeah.
That's just about it.

656
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:15,243
I mean... the bridge could probably use
a little bit of work,

657
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:16,777
but otherwise it's...

658
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:21,349
What do you think?
It's in pretty good shape, right?

659
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:47,042
I didn't make
a hard copy of that.

660
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:48,610
Good.

661
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:50,779
I wanna go long with
Beretsky's investments.

662
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,081
- You what?
- I spent the entire night

663
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:55,483
thinking about what we've
been doing here, Angelica,

664
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:57,953
and I'm tired of it.

665
00:45:57,954 --> 00:46:01,757
Do I really want to spend
my entire life finding failure? No.

666
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,358
But, Nate, it's what we do.

667
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,260
We sell short.
We're good at it.

668
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:07,062
Maybe it's time we got good
at something else.

669
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:09,297
I don't think it's time.

670
00:46:09,298 --> 00:46:12,600
We're a couple of days away
from finishing a $40-million portfolio.

671
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:15,137
Now is definitely not the time
to go back to square one.

672
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:17,639
I know I'm pulling the rug out
from underneath you here,

673
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,308
but I wanna do this,
and I want you to do it with me.

674
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:21,909
Okay.

675
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:26,815
I want you to tell me
what's going on.

676
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:29,017
- Angelica...
- You don't just wake up one morning

677
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:32,120
and decide that everything you've been
doing for the past 5 years is wrong!

678
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:33,655
Well, how else
does it happen?

679
00:46:33,656 --> 00:46:35,657
I don't know!

680
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:38,026
You haven't been yourself
since your mom's house was broken into!

681
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:40,028
- Aw, come on...
- I was concerned about you then.

682
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:43,765
You told me not to worry,
and I tried not to, and now look!

683
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:46,401
- This is totally reckless.
- Well, maybe it is.

684
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:50,205
Maybe I'm losing my mind.
I don't know, but...

685
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:53,141
it just can't be any other way.

686
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:58,146
You're my best friend.
I love you. Let's do this.

687
00:46:58,147 --> 00:47:00,348
Just stop it!

688
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:02,717
- Angelica?
- Stop it!

689
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:07,889
We'll start with
Buchanan's newsletter.

690
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,226
He's an optimist,
but he's not blind to reality.

691
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:13,294
- I'll get the last three months.
- Good.

692
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,265
And I love you, too.

693
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:23,671
Yeah, right away, please.
I think so.

694
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:25,140
What have I got for you?

695
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:28,309
Well, how about Hil-Co?

696
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,112
No, I'm not joking.
Five years' time,

697
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,447
they'll be swatting
everybody else away like flies.

698
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:35,082
These are the stocks
I'd bet on for the long term.

699
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:38,854
I know what I said before,
but I don't care.

700
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,388
I'm over it.

701
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:42,858
Okay, yeah, I trust you.
You're right.

702
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:44,793
Explain how I'm supposed
to feel comfortable

703
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:47,729
buying a stock that just last week
you told us to sell short?

704
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,631
Look, it's simply
a question of perspective.

705
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:53,034
That's right. What do you
say you return the favor?

706
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:55,270
All right, what do you got?

707
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:58,606
Sixty-six and one-eighth.
January, right.

708
00:47:59,475 --> 00:48:02,644
Now I have a favor
to ask you.

709
00:48:02,645 --> 00:48:05,046
Up three points?
Up three points.

710
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:06,915
No, that's driven
them up, right?

711
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:09,551
No, it's going up.
Up. Yeah.

712
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,425
- We did it!
- We did it.

713
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:30,371
They're solid
investments, Paul.

714
00:48:30,372 --> 00:48:33,241
That isn't really
the point.

715
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:36,111
The point is Carl Beretsky bought into
a strategy of short-selling,

716
00:48:36,112 --> 00:48:38,746
and you're giving him
something completely different.

717
00:48:38,747 --> 00:48:41,149
In fact, you're giving him
the opposite.

718
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,985
With all due respect, Mr. Holtzman,
Beretsky didn't buy into a strategy.

719
00:48:43,986 --> 00:48:46,554
He bought into Nate. He was worried
about his financial security,

720
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:48,356
and Nate
gave him hope.

721
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:51,326
I doubt he really cares what we do
with the money as long as it grows.

722
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:53,361
It's not that simple, Angelica.

723
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:57,132
I have to tell Carl we
completely reversed the field.

724
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:59,267
He could fly off the handle
and pull all his money.

725
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:01,569
Not if you believe
in the plan yourself.

726
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,005
With all due respect,
your number one man did all the work.

727
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:07,342
All you have to do is trust him.
How easy is that?

728
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:21,689
You were amazing.
That speech was inspirational.

729
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,359
Now that we've got
the basics ironed out,

730
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,229
we ought to talk about some
designations for Beretsky's general fund.

731
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,031
I had ideas for creating tax protection
I wanted to run by you.

732
00:49:30,032 --> 00:49:32,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

733
00:49:32,434 --> 00:49:34,970
We've been working
our butts off for weeks.

734
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:38,673
You know what?
I want you to take the day off.

735
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:40,942
Don't be silly.
There's plenty of work to do here.

736
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:43,478
I'm taking the day off.
I want you to do the same.

737
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:46,381
Well, what are you gonna do?

738
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:48,783
Hello.

739
00:49:48,784 --> 00:49:50,118
- Hi.
- Hi.

740
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,955
Uh, Angelica,
this is Chloe.

741
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:55,223
Hi.

742
00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:57,325
It's really nice
to meet you.

743
00:49:57,326 --> 00:49:59,928
Likewise.

744
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:03,331
They're, um, fancy digs.

745
00:50:03,332 --> 00:50:06,634
Would you like the 25-cent tour
before you two go?

746
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:08,636
Oh, thank you.
I would like that.

747
00:50:08,637 --> 00:50:10,705
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay. Let's go.

748
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,142
Wow, you guys work here?

749
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:17,845
Sometimes.

750
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:29,090
Oh, my...

751
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:47,908
Is there no nonfat milk
in this place? Shee.

752
00:50:56,785 --> 00:51:04,124
ś I don't know why
but I'm feelin' so sad ś

753
00:51:05,294 --> 00:51:09,164
ś I long to try somethin' ś

754
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:13,000
ś I've never had ś

755
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,637
ś Never had no kissin' ś

756
00:51:17,306 --> 00:51:22,209
ś Mmm, what I been missin' ś

757
00:51:23,045 --> 00:51:26,881
ś Lover man,
oh where can you be ś

758
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:29,617
That's for you.
Come on. Sit down.

759
00:51:31,787 --> 00:51:33,955
ś The night is so cold ś

760
00:51:33,956 --> 00:51:36,091
- Yeah?
- I didn't know that.

761
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:40,495
ś And I'm so all alone ś

762
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:45,700
ś I'd give my soul ś

763
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:48,903
ś Just to call you my own ś

764
00:51:48,904 --> 00:51:50,071
Oh! My heart.

765
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,974
ś Got a moon above me ś

766
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:59,414
ś But no one to love me ś

767
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:05,320
ś Lover man,
oh where can you be ś

768
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,093
ś I've heard it said ś

769
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:19,233
ś That the thrill
of romance can be ś

770
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:23,671
ś A heavenly dream ś

771
00:52:23,672 --> 00:52:25,507
- What do you think?
- Oh. Hmm. Well.

772
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:27,208
A new man?

773
00:52:27,209 --> 00:52:29,344
ś One day we'll meet ś

774
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:30,811
Thank you.

775
00:52:30,812 --> 00:52:35,282
ś And you'll dry all my tears ś

776
00:52:36,452 --> 00:52:43,858
ś And whisper sweet
little things in my ears ś

777
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,995
ś Huggin' and a-kissin' ś

778
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:55,070
ś Mmm, what we've been missin' ś

779
00:52:55,071 --> 00:53:01,275
ś Lover man,

780
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:07,115
ś Be ś

781
00:53:07,116 --> 00:53:08,950
You still want
"A" flat, right?

782
00:53:08,951 --> 00:53:11,686
Yeah.
Give me a hand up?

783
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:13,254
Thanks.

784
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:15,823
Hi.

785
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:18,826
Welcome to the Last Stop.

786
00:53:18,827 --> 00:53:19,994
Hit it.

787
00:53:19,995 --> 00:53:25,165
ś

788
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:32,207
ś Here I go again ś

789
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:36,478
ś I hear those trumpets
blow again ś

790
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,814
ś All aglow again ś

791
00:53:39,815 --> 00:53:43,651
ś Taking a chance on love ś

792
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:48,055
ś Here I slide again ś

793
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:52,026
ś About to take
that ride again ś

794
00:53:52,027 --> 00:53:55,863
ś So starry-eyed again ś

795
00:53:55,864 --> 00:53:59,134
ś Taking a chance on love ś

796
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:03,203
ś I thought that cards
were a frame-up ś

797
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,108
ś I never would try ś

798
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:10,745
ś But now I'm
taking that game up ś

799
00:54:10,746 --> 00:54:16,417
ś And the ace of hearts
is high, oh ś

800
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:19,320
ś Things are mending now ś

801
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:23,758
ś I see a rainbow blending now ś

802
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:27,328
ś We'll have
our happy ending now ś

803
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:31,232
ś Taking a chance on love ś

804
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:35,269
ś

805
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:45,580
ś Taking a chance on love ś

806
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:47,715
Thank you.

807
00:54:58,093 --> 00:55:00,428
Yeah, sorry.

808
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:02,029
They were friends.

809
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,199
You know
what I'm worried about?

810
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,933
Now that you're
gonna be singing with me,

811
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:07,868
I have to bring
my "A" game every night.

812
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:11,506
- Yeah, Frank, no more slackin' off.
- Well, here's to the "A" game.

813
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:13,507
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

814
00:55:16,645 --> 00:55:19,046
And, you, I don't
even know you anymore.

815
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:22,717
- You want a gig, too?
- No, Frank, I'm retiring.

816
00:55:22,718 --> 00:55:24,619
Goin' out on top.

817
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,088
Well, you're gonna have to come
play a duet with me sometime.

818
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:29,190
You're not just
gonna sit there.

819
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:30,958
- Yeah.
- All right.

820
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:33,060
- Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yay!
- Alright, alright, alright.

821
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:34,395
- Cheers.
- That'd be great.

822
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:37,297
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

823
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:40,901
But I don't want you singing.

824
00:55:40,902 --> 00:55:43,203
You just stick
to the organ, Frank. Okay?

825
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,289
Mmm...

826
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,994
You're like a piano.

827
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:10,164
Play something on me.

828
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,968
Like what?

829
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:16,370
I don't know.
You choose.

830
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:21,909
Okay.

831
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,823
What is that?

832
00:56:37,058 --> 00:56:38,326
Schubert.

833
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:41,461
Mmm. It's wonderful.

834
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,068
My mother used to play this
every time she sat down to practice.

835
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:53,508
Which was right about the time
I got home from school.

836
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:57,445
So...

837
00:56:57,446 --> 00:57:00,614
I must have heard that
hundreds of times.

838
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:04,284
Used to hate it.

839
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:10,191
Now it's what I think about
every time I look at a piano.

840
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:18,699
Mmm.

841
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:22,703
Do you miss her?

842
00:57:30,479 --> 00:57:32,880
I wish she hadn't
died unhappy.

843
00:57:36,952 --> 00:57:40,187
If I could figure that out,

844
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:46,927
that would probably lead me to
knowing whether I miss her or not.

845
00:57:46,928 --> 00:57:48,896
I...

846
00:57:48,897 --> 00:57:51,366
Well, that's a pretty
complicated answer

847
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:54,168
for somebody
who thinks in absolutes.

848
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,972
Well, I thought I had
everything figured out.

849
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:03,610
And then I met you.

850
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,001
Holtzman's been here for 3 hours.
This doesn't look good.

851
00:58:27,002 --> 00:58:29,871
- Good morning.
- I've gone over everything.

852
00:58:29,872 --> 00:58:33,107
About half of Beretsky's portfolio
can absorb some overall market damage.

853
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:35,410
The other half I would
classify as vulnerable.

854
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:36,911
- Mm-hmm.
- We have two options:

855
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:39,614
short anything that gets
an initial uptick,

856
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:43,918
or we just dump everything right away and
start again once the market's stabilized.

857
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:47,321
What do you wanna do?
We don't have a lot of time.

858
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:49,624
Well...

859
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,459
I think we should
just ride it out.

860
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,728
Ride it out.
Are you kidding?

861
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:56,731
No. I like this portfolio
for the long term.

862
00:58:56,732 --> 00:58:59,266
Nate, you're gonna lose his money!

863
00:58:59,267 --> 00:59:03,003
We need to sell everything in the Beretsky
portfolio as soon as the market opens.

864
00:59:03,004 --> 00:59:04,439
I'm not gonna
do that, Paul.

865
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,807
Excuse me?

866
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:07,809
I'm not going to give up
on a good thing

867
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,677
because I'm scared that
something bad might happen.

868
00:59:09,678 --> 00:59:11,245
I believe
in the stocks we chose.

869
00:59:11,246 --> 00:59:14,515
I don't have time to get
into this with you right now,

870
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:16,451
but we have 40 million dollars...

871
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,453
tied up in a market
that's about to crash.

872
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:19,416
So if you don't mind...

873
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:21,456
You don't know that,
and even if it does,

874
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,023
this portfolio
can withstand...

875
00:59:23,024 --> 00:59:25,326
Beretsky will lose
half his money by noon!

876
00:59:25,327 --> 00:59:27,495
And I can't
withstand that!

877
00:59:27,496 --> 00:59:29,830
So just dump
the damn stocks!

878
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,267
Or I'll find
somebody who will.

879
00:59:33,268 --> 00:59:35,470
You better
start looking, Paul.

880
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:37,805
- You got five minutes.
- Stop it! You made your point!

881
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:40,274
It's not about making a point.
I am not going to be bullied

882
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:42,109
into doing something
I do not believe in.

883
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,777
That's fine.

884
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:46,848
I'll sell
the Beretsky portfolio.

885
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,716
You clear out
your desk.

886
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:50,417
You're fired.

887
00:59:50,418 --> 00:59:52,052
Excellent.

888
00:59:52,053 --> 00:59:53,320
Mr. Holtzman, wait.

889
00:59:53,321 --> 00:59:55,456
I haven't
got time to wait!

890
00:59:55,457 --> 00:59:56,724
Mr. Holtzman!

891
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:59,826
Aw, come on.
Angelica, let him go. It's okay!

892
01:00:13,408 --> 01:00:16,310
Hi. No, it's okay.
You don't have to be afraid of me.

893
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:18,245
I'm-I'm here to help.

894
01:00:18,246 --> 01:00:20,314
I don't need any help.

895
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:22,483
Well, I'm here
to help Jesse.

896
01:00:22,484 --> 01:00:24,552
I don't know
where Jesse is.

897
01:00:24,553 --> 01:00:26,253
Well, I do.
He's in the bedroom.

898
01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:31,325
I would give it
a couple of hours.

899
01:00:31,326 --> 01:00:33,561
It's not really
a good time right now.

900
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:35,630
What did you do to him?
Who are you?

901
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:36,764
No...

902
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:39,099
I'm Vince.

903
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:43,203
Jesse didn't tell you
about me, did he?

904
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:44,605
No.

905
01:00:44,606 --> 01:00:48,776
I'm the guy people call when...
when they can't get clean.

906
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:56,017
Call me tomorrow.
Holtzman will have cooled off by then.

907
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:59,453
- I'm sure I can get him to reconsider.
- Don't bother.

908
01:00:59,454 --> 01:01:01,656
Nate, you need this job.

909
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:03,998
You need it so that you eventually
have the leverage...

910
01:01:03,999 --> 01:01:05,459
to start something
for yourself.

911
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,795
I already have started
something for myself.

912
01:01:10,032 --> 01:01:11,731
Finally.

913
01:01:12,768 --> 01:01:16,671
And... I have
all the leverage I need.

914
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:19,373
Seeing as Holtzman
had to have the last word,

915
01:01:19,374 --> 01:01:21,676
I should get
a pretty good severance.

916
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:23,678
That's not
gonna last forever.

917
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,081
Well...
who knows?

918
01:01:27,082 --> 01:01:28,683
Call me!

919
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:31,452
Life's gonna be
pretty simple for Jesse.

920
01:01:31,453 --> 01:01:34,121
He's gonna have
two kinds of people.

921
01:01:34,122 --> 01:01:36,457
People that
help him stay clean,

922
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,626
and people that don't.

923
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:41,661
It's your choice.
It is your choice.

924
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:46,333
I haven't seen Jesse
for a few weeks,

925
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,603
and I didn't know...

926
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,605
when he was coming back.

927
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,939
And, um...

928
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:56,010
I'm sorry.

929
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:58,212
I'm sorry. Um...

930
01:01:58,213 --> 01:02:00,680
You were already gone,
weren't you?

931
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:05,185
You're already outta here.

932
01:02:05,186 --> 01:02:06,787
Yeah.

933
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:09,056
Oh...

934
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:12,093
I'm sorry. I should have said this
from the beginning.

935
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:14,495
You don't have to do this.

936
01:02:14,496 --> 01:02:16,397
You don't.

937
01:02:45,326 --> 01:02:46,794
Can I help you?

938
01:02:46,795 --> 01:02:49,797
Uh, I'm looking for Chloe.
Is she here at all?

939
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:51,866
Chloe's not available
right now.

940
01:02:51,867 --> 01:02:53,800
Can I give her
a message?

941
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,905
Is she here or... not?

942
01:02:57,906 --> 01:03:00,675
She's here,
but she's not available.

943
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,576
Is there a message
I can give her?

944
01:03:02,577 --> 01:03:04,712
Yeah, just tell her
Nate dropped by, I guess.

945
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:08,382
Nate. Okay, Nate.
I'll tell her.

946
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:10,685
All right?

947
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,186
Thanks.

948
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,102
Nate? Hey.

949
01:03:28,103 --> 01:03:29,570
What's going on?

950
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:31,972
I'm going to explain.
Um...

951
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:36,010
You wanna grab some breakfast?
I need to talk to you, too.

952
01:03:36,011 --> 01:03:38,478
No, I, um...

953
01:03:38,479 --> 01:03:40,880
I have to stay here.

954
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,151
What's the matter?

955
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:48,856
Um, that man
that you met upstairs

956
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:51,525
is here to help us
get Jesse clean.

957
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:54,361
"Us"?

958
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,696
Yeah, Jesse and me.

959
01:03:57,365 --> 01:03:59,466
He came back
last night.

960
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:04,071
Um, and the next few days are
supposed to be kind of crazy,

961
01:04:04,072 --> 01:04:07,241
so Vince is gonna hang around
for a couple of days

962
01:04:07,242 --> 01:04:11,145
and make sure that nothing bad
happens to Jesse.

963
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:13,580
What about you?

964
01:04:13,581 --> 01:04:16,583
I'm-I'm going to help.

965
01:04:17,953 --> 01:04:19,286
Oh, Chloe.

966
01:04:19,287 --> 01:04:20,955
It's not what
you're thinking.

967
01:04:20,956 --> 01:04:23,390
- You're doing what we always do.
- No, I'm not.

968
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:26,360
Yes, you are!
You just can't see it!

969
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:29,663
If you had a chance to go back right now
and try to help your mom,

970
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:32,233
you would do it no matter how bad
the odds were.

971
01:04:32,234 --> 01:04:34,334
That's different.
That's totally different.

972
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:37,237
That's only because it's too late.

973
01:04:41,009 --> 01:04:43,143
I'm sorry.

974
01:05:21,783 --> 01:05:27,588
ś The thrill is gone ś

975
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:34,828
ś The thrill is gone ś

976
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:42,069
ś I can see it ś

977
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:45,739
ś In your eyes ś

978
01:05:46,607 --> 01:05:48,408
ś I can hear it ś

979
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:53,079
ś In your sigh ś

980
01:05:54,716 --> 01:06:01,054
ś Feel your touch and realize ś

981
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:06,793
ś The thrill is gone ś

982
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,164
- I'll get Vince.
- Stay.

983
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:16,937
ś This is the end ś

984
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:19,506
Jesse?

985
01:06:19,507 --> 01:06:25,178
ś So I pretend ś

986
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:32,186
ś And let it linger ś

987
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:34,855
It's gonna be
one hell of a write-off.

988
01:06:34,856 --> 01:06:36,290
Here's your receipt.

989
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:40,460
ś On ś

990
01:06:40,461 --> 01:06:46,833
ś The thrill is gone ś

991
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:49,603
So, you know, basically I'm just

992
01:06:49,604 --> 01:06:53,473
exploring my options right now,
figuring out what I'm gonna do.

993
01:06:53,474 --> 01:06:56,343
There's no rush,
right?

994
01:06:56,344 --> 01:06:58,379
Did you quit,
or were you fired?

995
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,881
Which one was it,
'cause I'm not totally clear on that.

996
01:07:00,882 --> 01:07:02,149
Uh, uh, I quit.

997
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:06,620
Well, you know, for all
intents and purposes, I quit.

998
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:08,588
Right.

999
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,430
Ah.

1000
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:34,848
<i>Hey, Nate, it's Frank.</i>

1001
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:37,884
<i>I haven't seen you around
The House lately. Where you been?</i>

1002
01:07:37,885 --> 01:07:40,921
<i>Where's that gig you promised me?
Give me a call.</i>

1003
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:57,771
ś Why do I let you do the things you do ś

1004
01:07:57,772 --> 01:08:02,242
ś 'Cause, baby,
when it comes to you ś

1005
01:08:02,243 --> 01:08:07,046
ś I should know better ś

1006
01:08:08,649 --> 01:08:13,820
ś Once upon a time your love
was my great passion ś

1007
01:08:13,821 --> 01:08:17,757
ś Shined just like
the colors of a rainbow ś

1008
01:08:17,758 --> 01:08:23,030
ś Happiness
Ours for the asking ś

1009
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:27,167
ś I remember
when you loved me ś

1010
01:08:27,168 --> 01:08:29,636
ś Then I looked around ś

1011
01:08:29,637 --> 01:08:31,905
ś And without a sound ś

1012
01:08:31,906 --> 01:08:33,607
ś Love is gone ś

1013
01:08:33,608 --> 01:08:36,343
ś Still I can't let go ś

1014
01:08:36,344 --> 01:08:39,179
ś I keep holding on ś

1015
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:42,949
ś When I know
I should go ś

1016
01:09:06,841 --> 01:09:09,676
- Up.
- Uh, what...

1017
01:09:12,747 --> 01:09:14,181
What is...
What's that?

1018
01:09:14,182 --> 01:09:16,583
What's what?

1019
01:09:16,584 --> 01:09:17,784
It's soup.

1020
01:09:17,785 --> 01:09:20,020
Not the sou...
The tune you're humming.

1021
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:21,288
What is that?

1022
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:24,291
Oh. Was I humming?

1023
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:25,759
Yeah.

1024
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,761
Oh.

1025
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:31,131
You didn't know
you were humming?

1026
01:09:31,132 --> 01:09:33,300
No, I didn't know
I was humming.

1027
01:09:33,301 --> 01:09:35,702
I knew you were humming.

1028
01:09:37,705 --> 01:09:40,941
Mmm.

1029
01:09:40,942 --> 01:09:44,243
- You know, I was thinking...
- Don't think. Eat.

1030
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:49,082
I'm serious.

1031
01:09:51,052 --> 01:09:54,253
I was... I was thinking
we should get outta here.

1032
01:09:55,022 --> 01:09:57,390
Are you sure
you're up for that?

1033
01:10:00,528 --> 01:10:03,263
No, I mean, um...

1034
01:10:03,264 --> 01:10:05,732
"out of here"
out of here.

1035
01:10:10,938 --> 01:10:14,040
I can't be in
this city anymore, Chloe.

1036
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:16,309
It's not healthy.

1037
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:25,151
I wanna go somewhere else
and start all over.

1038
01:10:26,154 --> 01:10:28,555
The right way.

1039
01:10:28,556 --> 01:10:30,724
With you.

1040
01:10:30,725 --> 01:10:32,126
My little lady.

1041
01:10:34,996 --> 01:10:36,897
What do you think?

1042
01:10:40,968 --> 01:10:42,536
Um...

1043
01:11:08,563 --> 01:11:13,267
ś What's new ś

1044
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:18,572
ś How did that romance ś

1045
01:11:18,573 --> 01:11:22,008
ś Come through ś

1046
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:34,788
What'd you expect?
You don't return any of my phone calls.

1047
01:11:36,957 --> 01:11:39,326
Super let me in.

1048
01:11:39,327 --> 01:11:43,797
He mentioned, by the way, he loves
what you're doing with the place,

1049
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:46,600
and I have to agree.

1050
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:52,472
As good
as that looks, I...

1051
01:11:52,473 --> 01:11:55,209
I'll just stick
to my glass of wine,

1052
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,677
but thanks for the offer.

1053
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:22,568
What, are you mad at me?
I'm on your side.

1054
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:26,372
I'm not mad at you.
I'm just...

1055
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:31,945
I don't have anything
left inside of me.

1056
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:36,750
I don't have the energy
to return my phone calls or...

1057
01:12:37,952 --> 01:12:41,755
sit on the couch and talk about
what's going on in my life.

1058
01:12:41,756 --> 01:12:43,289
Sorry.

1059
01:12:45,493 --> 01:12:49,495
It's the girl.

1060
01:12:51,299 --> 01:12:55,602
You know, when we met, I thought
there was something so familiar about her.

1061
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:58,372
I couldn't figure it out,
and then just last night,

1062
01:12:58,373 --> 01:13:00,807
it occurred to me how much
she reminded me of your mom.

1063
01:13:00,808 --> 01:13:02,008
That's ridiculous.

1064
01:13:02,009 --> 01:13:03,343
She does.

1065
01:13:03,344 --> 01:13:05,612
You remember your mom.
Before she got depressed,

1066
01:13:05,613 --> 01:13:07,614
she had that same sunny,
optimist...

1067
01:13:07,615 --> 01:13:09,916
Of course I remember!

1068
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,788
I moved on!

1069
01:13:17,725 --> 01:13:19,726
You should be trying
to do the same thing, Angelica.

1070
01:13:19,727 --> 01:13:22,062
You're not
exactly young anymore.

1071
01:13:22,897 --> 01:13:25,365
Maybe you should sit down
and try to figure out

1072
01:13:25,366 --> 01:13:28,168
what's really going on in your life,
what you're going to do,

1073
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:30,503
instead of just playing
my wet nurse.

1074
01:13:37,878 --> 01:13:40,446
Everybody deals with
heartbreak in their own way.

1075
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:43,784
Some people drink.

1076
01:13:43,785 --> 01:13:46,486
Some people eat sweets.

1077
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:48,154
You...

1078
01:13:48,956 --> 01:13:52,492
you just push away
everything you love.

1079
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:54,627
And everybody, too.

1080
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:26,645
ś

1081
01:16:36,657 --> 01:16:37,824
- Hello.
- Hi.

1082
01:16:37,825 --> 01:16:39,825
- Just one.
- Yeah.

1083
01:16:43,798 --> 01:16:45,664
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1084
01:17:10,457 --> 01:17:13,126
Thank you very much.
We're gonna take a short intermission.

1085
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:15,461
We'll be right back.

1086
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:19,032
Hey, Frank.
How ya doin'?

1087
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:20,867
- Nate, how ya doin'?
- Good to see you.

1088
01:17:20,868 --> 01:17:23,136
- Sounding pretty sharp up there.
- Thank you, thank you.

1089
01:17:23,137 --> 01:17:24,737
Yeah.

1090
01:17:28,509 --> 01:17:31,678
Frank, what?
I did what I had to do, and that's that.

1091
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,180
I'll be fine, okay?
I'll find something else.

1092
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:37,150
All's I'm sayin' is you could have thought
of me before you did something rash.

1093
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,786
I have a feeling you'll be okay.

1094
01:17:39,787 --> 01:17:42,355
Ah, anyway,
it's good to see that you're back.

1095
01:17:42,356 --> 01:17:44,824
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1096
01:17:47,728 --> 01:17:49,728
So what's the plan?

1097
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:53,599
I'm not sure.

1098
01:17:55,202 --> 01:17:57,470
Look, have you seen
Chloe at all?

1099
01:17:57,471 --> 01:18:00,607
No. That girl,
she just vanished.

1100
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:03,577
Anyway, I hope
you've been practicing.

1101
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:06,179
I got you booked here
for next Wednesday.

1102
01:18:27,234 --> 01:18:29,235
<i>This is Nate Holden.
Please leave a message.</i>

1103
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:32,171
<i>Nate, it's Angelica.</i>

1104
01:18:32,172 --> 01:18:34,040
<i>Forget about
the other night.</i>

1105
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:37,877
There's a new firm looking for a partner,
and they're asking for you.

1106
01:18:37,878 --> 01:18:40,480
Hello. Hi.

1107
01:18:44,885 --> 01:18:47,520
<i>No, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.</i>

1108
01:18:49,223 --> 01:18:51,024
Yeah.

1109
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,194
No, I really appreciate it,
Angelica. I do.

1110
01:18:57,197 --> 01:18:59,598
Wait a minute. Who?

1111
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:04,270
The crash.

1112
01:19:04,271 --> 01:19:08,307
The crash was really
more of a fender bender.

1113
01:19:08,308 --> 01:19:10,343
It had
a healthy rebound.

1114
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:12,211
All I did was reinvest
Beretsky's funds

1115
01:19:12,212 --> 01:19:15,749
into what pretty much amounted
to the portfolio you created.

1116
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,317
It went up 12 percent.

1117
01:19:18,318 --> 01:19:20,486
And this...

1118
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:24,090
this I've been planning
for quite some time.

1119
01:19:24,091 --> 01:19:28,261
But it was your investments that gave
me the push I needed to make it happen.

1120
01:19:28,262 --> 01:19:31,531
I mean, you and I together,

1121
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:34,867
I mean, we could make
an incredibly strong team.

1122
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,137
And I know Beretsky
feels the same way.

1123
01:19:40,374 --> 01:19:42,642
The only question is...

1124
01:19:42,643 --> 01:19:45,679
how do you feel?

1125
01:19:47,915 --> 01:19:50,416
- How'd it go?
- Incredibly well.

1126
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:57,490
Now, would you meet me...

1127
01:19:57,491 --> 01:19:59,992
at this address tonight?

1128
01:20:02,663 --> 01:20:04,263
Here.

1129
01:20:05,616 --> 01:20:06,628
What is this?

1130
01:20:06,629 --> 01:20:08,868
And in the meantime,
David wants to see you.

1131
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:12,271
- What for?
- Just go on in. He's waiting for you.

1132
01:20:13,874 --> 01:20:15,942
Me?

1133
01:20:19,379 --> 01:20:21,714
You're gonna be great.

1134
01:20:24,919 --> 01:20:26,586
Go on.

1135
01:20:32,593 --> 01:20:35,027
He's expecting me.

1136
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:27,146
Why do I let you do the...

1137
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,651
- Hey.
- Hi.

1138
01:22:06,887 --> 01:22:09,589
Did you, um,
finish up in there?

1139
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:19,398
Does, um, that have anything to do
with this sheet music?

1140
01:22:23,503 --> 01:22:26,372
You, um,
love him?

1141
01:22:26,373 --> 01:22:28,708
Jesse...

1142
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:31,076
You know,
it's funny when...

1143
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:36,749
I mean, when you think
you've lost everything,

1144
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:41,053
you find out you can, um,
always lose a little more.

1145
01:22:45,759 --> 01:22:46,893
Hey...

1146
01:23:13,988 --> 01:23:17,590
ś

1147
01:23:44,618 --> 01:23:46,953
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1148
01:23:46,954 --> 01:23:49,989
At this time, I'd like to bring
a very special guest up,

1149
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:53,492
personal friend of mine,
Mr. Nate Holden.

1150
01:23:53,493 --> 01:23:56,095
Ladies and gentlemen,
please make him feel welcome.

1151
01:23:56,096 --> 01:23:57,997
It's his first time
here at The House.

1152
01:24:09,276 --> 01:24:11,677
Thank...

1153
01:24:11,678 --> 01:24:13,646
Excuse me. Thank you.

1154
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:23,489
ś

1155
01:24:24,891 --> 01:24:27,293
Hey. Angelica? Hi.

1156
01:24:27,294 --> 01:24:28,761
Oh!

1157
01:24:32,032 --> 01:24:35,000
- What a pleasure to meet you.
- Hi. Pleased to meet you.

1158
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,643
ś If the nightingales
could sing like you ś

1159
01:24:44,644 --> 01:24:49,248
ś They'd sing much sweeter
than they do ś

1160
01:24:49,249 --> 01:24:51,896
ś For you brought
a new kind of love ś

1162
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,222
Microphone. Yeah.

1163
01:24:56,223 --> 01:25:01,060
ś And if the sandman
brought me dreams of you ś

1164
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:04,964
ś I'd want to dream
my whole life through ś

1165
01:25:04,965 --> 01:25:11,670
ś 'Cause you brought
a new kind of love to me ś

1166
01:25:11,671 --> 01:25:16,675
ś I know that I'm the queen,
you're the king ś

1167
01:25:16,676 --> 01:25:20,213
ś Still you can
understand ś

1168
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:24,583
ś That underneath it all
I'm a girl ś

1169
01:25:24,584 --> 01:25:28,121
ś And you, you're only a man ś

1170
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:32,325
ś I would work
and slave my whole life through ś

1171
01:25:32,326 --> 01:25:36,062
ś If I could
hurry home to you ś

1172

1177
