Our eyes they fly
like kites up high

10
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:49,353
The threads of our gazes collide

00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:41,165
But when it hits,
it hurts and it shows

From every wound a little joy derive

Rabba..

22
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:58,955
Hear a little truth and
a piece of a lie..

23

00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,123
..we'll fit the budget
into the apartment.

58
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:49,687
Gotta go now.. Mum's
calling from Bhatinda.

59
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:55,826
Yikes!

60
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,129
A man's gotta sit so

Ok.. ok, l also don't mind..

Did l say you could sit?

66
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,388
And you didn't say l couldn't..

67
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:29,300
They're all occupied.

68
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:34,567
Whatsup..

69
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:36,533

What am l doing? Am l
making a pass at you?

77
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:08,538
Typical lndian mentality.

78
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:10,734
Sorry..

79
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,936

84
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,460
Thank God!

85
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:39,663

My best friend also Pakistani.

88
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,682
Huffy Bhai.. Hafeez Pathan,
business partner..

89
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:54,482
He brings the latest lndian
movies from Pakistan..

90
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:57,883
l make copies of the DVDs
and market them..

91
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:02,393
Marketing pirated DVDs.. Wow.

92
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:06,894
As if you've never watched
a pirated movie.

93
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,494
l don't watch lndian movies.

94
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:11,968
Whatchyasaying?

95
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,770
lt's true.

96
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:18,308
So you watch Pakistani movies?
They're crap.

97
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:21,273
l only watch foreign language films..

98
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,713
..French, Chinese, lranian..

99
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,348
At times Hollywood.

100
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:26,476
At times Hollywood!

101
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,379
And that's good. Which is why l'm not
even in the DVD business anymore..

102
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:34,489
Now Huffy Bhai and l are
Property Agents..

103
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:37,559
My folks.. they love lndian movies..

104
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:42,695
Papa wanted to name me Madhubala,
Mama got stuck on Sadhna.

105
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:48,707
Alvira is very beautiful name.

106
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:51,443
Flirting again..

107
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:58,314
Why should l.. l'm engaged
too. See original Topaz.

108
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:00,843
l've come to pick up my fiance too..

109
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,854
..she's coming by the
same train as your fiance..

110
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,685
Does she even have a name or
you always call her fiance?

111
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,387
No she's nameless.. what a question!

112
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,559
So what's her name?

113
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:17,460
Anaida..

114
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:24,566
So how did you two meet up?

115
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:28,972
First time, we met at the Hotel Ritz.

116
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:33,576
Ritz?

117
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,086
The one in Paris..

118
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:38,421
The same one where the Princess
Diana-Dodi episode happened..

119
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:41,756
l was there that night.. Diana
was looking amazing..

120
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:45,727
l was just five feet away.. Had l
reached out l could've touched her..

121
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:51,435
And then appeared Anaida.. Hundred
times more beautifuler than Diana..

122
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:54,365
She was the Assistant
Manager at the Ritz..

123
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,478
As Diana and Dodi reached the gate..

124
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,655
..suddenly photographers popped
out of everywhere..

125
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:15,392
Everybody was looking at Diana..

126
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,520
..but l was looking at Anaida

127
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:20,527
Diana-Dodi's story was
coming to an end..

128
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:24,970
..and Rikki-Anaida's love
story was about to start

129
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,733
Haven't you heard..

130
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:35,074
When two love-birds die
another two are born.

131
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,580
You were wearing a suit?

132
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:40,511
Yeah..

133
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:43,480
You see..

134
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:45,083
God made Man..

135
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,149
.. And Tailor made Gentleman.

136
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:53,428
God made Man and after that
Tailor made Gentleman.

137
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:54,830
..Huffy Bhai says.

138
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:57,499
Can't imagine you in a suit.

139
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,599
Goodness..

140
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:04,973
Such a historic moment and you're
worried about my suit..

141
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:09,672
Had you and Huffy Bhai gone to
rent out the Eiffel Tower?

142
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:14,543
We're also into antiques in a big
way.. We'd gone to Paris for a deal.

143
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:18,714
DVDs, property, antiques.. Wow.

144
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,857
Just not fashionable doing one
business these days, boss.

145
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:28,527
Huffy Bhai was bringing the seller
and the antiques from Bombay..

146
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:32,134
..and l was handling
the buyers in Paris.

147
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:34,204
And these antiques were
obviously stolen.

148
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:39,109
They would have rotted
away in lndia anyway..

149
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:43,538
..what's the harm if a few people
make some money out of it?

150
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:45,675
lt's 100%y hard earned money, madam.

151
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:46,844
Yeah right!

152
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,613
Want to hear the rest of the
story or should l leave?

153
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:52,717
After finishing the story.

154
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:04,566
We'd been waiting for more
than three hours..

155
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,501
l was getting desperate..
when would Huffy Bhai come..

156
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:09,507
..when would this deal get over..

157
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,770
..and when would l celebrate
with Anaida..

158
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:19,742

162
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,755

Cops snatched the goods darling..

00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:38,727
What about you?

167
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:42,934
Slipped out the moment l smelt
trouble.. Have the buyers left?

168
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,178
Nope.. they're all here..

169
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:50,844
Better slip out Rikki, slipping
in and out is what we do best.

170
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,181
And look, just handle them with care.

171
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:03,793
They're babbling something in French.

172
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,558
l think they're cursing..

173
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:12,168
Hello.. Monsieur, don't go..

174

182
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:34,990
You were staying at The
Ritz with empty pockets?

183
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:41,825
The antique seller coming from lndia
was to finance the trip..

184
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:46,698
l didn't even have enough cash
to watch cabaret at Lido..

185
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,000
Where was Anaida in all this?

186
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:49,731
Coming to that, boss..

187
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,306
First let me get out of the room..

188
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,606
Couldn't have walked out with the
suitcase, they'd have caught me..

189
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,706
..so l stuffed everything
in my pockets..

190
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:59,717
..wore my clothes on top of
each other and walked out.

191
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:04,252
l'm Slim Shady, my Mamma's Slim Shady,
please stand up, please stand up..

192
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:05,722
She was just two feet away..

193
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:09,257
..she looked at me and said..

194
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:10,625

195
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,991

She was being so nice to me and
l was sneaking out of the hotel!

197
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:26,640

Credit Card payment.. non..

Why?

205
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:00,277
Last bill.. when did you pay?

206
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,813
Just paid before coming.

207
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:06,011
Credit card company says you haven't
paid your dues for a year.

208
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:07,143
Liars!

209
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:11,311
Never go for this card..
l'm really regretting.

210
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,257
Careful with that please..
it's invaluable.

211
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:17,754
Lottery ticket..

212
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:21,263
First prize one million pounds..
second prize free trip to Hollywood.

213
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:25,136
At this moment you're holding
a million bucks in your hand.

214
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,695
Monsieur Thukral, l'm sure you will
win the lottery some day..

215
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:29,707
..you'll become a millionaire
some day..

216
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:31,970
..but the bill you'll
settle today. Now!

217
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,874
Anaida Madam..

218
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:36,240
Now look..

219
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:40,114
Just by living in France you
don't become French..

220
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:43,185
..you got lndian blood
in those veins.

221
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:45,381
Mon pere et mere etre Karachi.

222
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:50,726
Blood is Pakistani, Monsieur
Thukral, not lndian.

223
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:51,888
Pakistani!

224
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:57,728
l was screwed.. she was going to
kill me with 60 years of hatred.

225
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:06,467
You lndians are amada to fight
but always blame Pakistanis.

226
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:08,243
Amada means..?

227
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:10,748
Don't you know what amada means?

228
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,281
Sorry l don't.

229
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:15,887

you my love story.

231
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,750
Am l fighting with you?

232
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,156
Why would you fight with me?

233
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:26,195
l'm not even Pakistani.

234
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,800
l'm British you know..

235
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:33,896
Oh you're British.. They what's the
quarrel.. Long live the Queen..

236
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,843
So where was l?

237
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,015
..there was Anaida, in her chair,
and here l was standing beside her..

238
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:54,826
What are these two going on about?

239
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:55,952
That l call the cops.

240
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:58,462
No no no need cops. Just think..

241
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,263
..if this episode hadn't happened..

242
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:04,833
if we'd met like normal people, the
situation would've been very different.

243
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:07,802
Together we would've gone
to Eiffel Tower..

244
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,170
..climbed to the
top and screamed..

245
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,072

Well done! Harami means..

272
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,547
Say it in Hindi..

273
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:28,945
Why cry?

274
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:42,343

00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,262
Today?

290
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,200

00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:43,575
So don't feel sad..

Let's both go to London..

294
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:48,484
l couldn't get leave.

295
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:50,586
That's so unfair..

296
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,123
No leave even for such
an important thing..

297
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,158
They really overwork you.

298
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:04,626
Look, but when you come to London
next stay at my house..

299
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:06,930
lt's small.. but very nice.

300
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:11,466
No..

301
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,408
Actually, it's too small for you..

302
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:22,176
Thukral..

303
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:25,081
Want to go home?

304
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:32,487
lf l let you go my boss will fire me.

305
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:33,996
Believe me, Anaida madam..

306
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:37,228
Moment you let me go l'll be back
from London in a jiffy with the money.

307
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:41,662
But if you don't.. l will be screwed.

308
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,229
l will not allow anybody screw you..

309
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,005
One chance, please.

310
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:02,453
Soon as l landed in London, l went
straight to Diana memorial..

311
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:03,993
To offer flowers..

312
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,655
You went to offer flowers?

313
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,666
l'd never waste money
on dead people..

314
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:11,065
l would think so.

315
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:13,433
Huffy Bhai is a die-hard
Diana lover..

316
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:17,538

317

My instrument is broken, here l am,
a musician without fame..

318
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:27,139
My beloved is gone, here l am,

320
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:34,353

the hotel bill.. gimme some money.

321
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:35,517
Have you gone mad?

322
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:38,289
Have we ever settled anything
that we'll settle a bill?

323
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:39,420
No..

324
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:42,292
But this time we will..
please gimme some money.

325
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,096
lf Huffy Bhai says no, then
it's a no. End of story.

326
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:53,007
Now forget about it dear..
see what l have here..

327
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:57,138
l've been through hell and you're
showing me this photo.

328
00:21:57,214 --> 00:21:59,375
Not just any photo.. look behind it.

329
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:05,622
We'll go dancing to Hollywood my
boy.. you won the lottery Rikki!

330
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:08,749
You won the lottery! Your Hollywood
dream has come true!

331
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,321
We're going to Hollywood my boy,
we're going to Hollywood!

332
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,158
Why are you stumped?

333
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:23,229
- Lost it.. - Not lost..
it's with Anaida.

334
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:25,070
- Who's that? - Hotel's manager..

335
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:26,632
What does she look like?
- Very beautiful.

336
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,678
- Not another word l understood
everything. - Understood what?!

337
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:31,706
Had to leave the suitcase
and wallet with her..

338
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:34,682
She wasn't letting me leave..
the ticket's in the wallet.

339
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,583
How many times have l told you,
stay away from women..

340
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,588
..they snatch things that matter.

341
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:40,590
- Now go back and get
the ticket. - How?

342
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,786
Without the money for the bill..
she'll get me arrested..

343
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:45,055
Here..

344
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:47,290
What all you make me do..

345
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:50,197
Huffy Bhai must you lift
your shirt everywhere..

346
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:51,700
lf l move l'll lose my place.

347
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:56,569
Here. And don't tell that
girl you won. Understood?

348
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,665
Now get lost..

349
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:02,311
l'll get you perfume from Paris.

350
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:05,507
Yea, l'll have a real perfume
party. Now scram!

351
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,280
l dreamt of going to Hollywood..

352
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:13,550
..but the lottery ticket was
financed by Huffy Bhai.

353
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:19,319
My heart was dying to live the
Hollywood dream with Anaida.

354
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,591
But l made my heart understand..
She's Miss World, you're Rikki Thukral

355
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,727
Why would she go with you? Huffy
Bhai is what you get Rikki..

356
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:29,295
Settle the bill get
the ticket.. simple.

357
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,273
Hullu ke paththa!

358
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:36,406
What's baldy saying?

359
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:39,309
He says, can't believe you're back.

360
00:23:39,683 --> 00:23:43,175
l had to.. My lottery
ticket's still with you.

361
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:47,122
You came for the ticket?

362
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:49,121
And to settle the bill..

363
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:53,254
..it's all there.. including
the taxi-fares.

364
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,257
Good..

365
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,826
Solomon..

366
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,828
And my stuff?

367
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:04,367
Solomon.. his stuff.

368
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,813
Harami why is she so touchy today?

369
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:25,191
Why angry?

370
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:35,363
My ticket!

371
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:41,636
Madam..

372
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:43,179
What do you want?

373
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:44,339
That..

374
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:45,473
What that?

375
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:50,210
That which is in your hand..
that's mine too.

376
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:52,847
lt's in my hand.. so it's mine.

377
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:54,914
Whatchyasaying?

378
00:24:55,526 --> 00:24:58,791
lt was in my purse.. which
l left with you..

379
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:01,561
- With whose permission
did you go? - Yours..

380
00:25:01,632 --> 00:25:03,429
And if l hadn't let you go?

381
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:08,368
l'd have rotted away..
or gone to jail.

382
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:09,868
And that didn't happen.

383
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:11,465
So?

384
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:14,809
So this ticket is.. My fee..

385
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,337

Au'revoir..

So then how did you get engaged?

391
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:38,797
That's another story altogether..

Just for one day if not two

396

Dunked in dew, a peppermint drop,

398
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:23,279
A thread cut kite soaring away,
a sliced cloud caress

399

Give me all the pieces or

Thukral actually came back for you..

478
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,652
..all the time dreaming of
going to Hollywood with you.

479
00:32:15,632 --> 00:32:17,122
Then why didn't he ask me?

480
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:20,861
You're Miss World..

481
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:23,362
..and he's Rikki Thukral..

482
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:28,136
..even if he touched you,
you'd get spoiled..

483
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:32,638
Didn't get spoiled using his hanky..

484
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:35,810
..in fact, became more beautifuler..

485
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:41,122
There'll only be one
bed for two people.

486
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:44,989
We can adjust..

487
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:47,926
..it's only for seven days..

488
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,695
Seven days that's it?!

489
00:32:57,874 --> 00:33:01,901
Thukral was thinking of adjusting
his entire life with you.

490
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:04,278
Full life adjust.

491
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:11,413
Ok..

492
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,389
Whatchyasaying?!

493
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,187
l'm saying l love Thukral, you idiot.

494
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:26,132
l love you Anaida!

495
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,208
You sacrificed the ticket on her?!

496
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:43,445
The moment she said my cut..

497
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:45,821
..that was the turning
point of my innings..

498
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:48,854
That's when l made up my mind,
she was just my type..

499
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:51,026
Ticket was no big deal, l'd
have sacrificed my life.

500
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:53,062
Must admit..

501
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:55,189
What?

502
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:57,063
You're a die-hard romantic.

503
00:33:58,034 --> 00:33:59,899
Whatchyasaying?

504
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:04,029
Moment ago you couldn't even share
the table with me and now..

505
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:05,332
And now what?

506
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:07,201
Now..

507
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:10,106
..your turn.. tell me..

508
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:12,982
..how did you meet your fiance?

509
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,345
Now don't be an aunty ji.

510
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:19,979
Oh l get it.. arranged is it?

511
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,290
Boy from Birmingham.. five figure
salary, good moral character..

512
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:25,953
- Hobbies cricket and.. - Rubbish..

513
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,761
So it's not arranged?

514
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:33,231
Superman brought us together.

515
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,367
He sells comic books?

516
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:38,798
Have you been to Madame Tussaud's,
the wax museum?

517
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:39,933
Of course l've been..

518
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,410
..they have several
models of our guys..

519
00:34:43,113 --> 00:34:46,276
Gandhi ji, Nehru ji, lndira
ji, Ash ji, Amit ji..

520
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,444
..our good ol' Bachchan..

521
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,047
..very few of your Pakistanis..

522
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:57,918
Anyway.. so you went to Tussaud's ..

523
00:34:57,994 --> 00:34:59,484
.. with my cousin Humera..

524
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:03,163
There was a Superhero Special
at Madame Tussaud's..

525
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:06,293
Batman, Hawkman, Aquaman, Superman..

526
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,428
..giant sized models everywhere..

527
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:10,803
Humera, my cousin was jumping from
one to the other screaming..

528
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:14,401
.. Aapi take a picture of this..

529
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:16,502
.. Aapi take a picture of that..

530
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:24,513
Watch out!

531
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:42,999
lf the fake Superman had fallen
on me, it'd have squashed me..

532
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:46,838
But the real Superman saved my life..

533
00:35:48,912 --> 00:35:53,576
l was dying to kiss him
and say l love you..

534
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:56,343
So.. you kissed him?

535
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:01,023
Didn't even say l love you.

536
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:06,256
l took an oath when l
was six years old..

537
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:15,135
Dear God l will never fall in love with
a dark-skinned Pakistani or lndian..

538
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:22,369
Please find a nice white-skin British
man just like yourself to marry me.

539
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:23,503
Amen

540
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:28,146
- Hello. - Hi..

541
00:36:28,218 --> 00:36:29,344
Sorry, l'm on the phone

542
00:36:29,953 --> 00:36:31,250
Yeah this is Steve..

543
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:35,080
Bollocks! l've already said
l don't want his case..

544
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:36,622
Don't ever call me again..

545
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,527
Your name's Steve?

546
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:42,956
Yeah..

547
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:45,264
But you're..

548
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,028
Mum British..

549
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:50,436
Dad Punjabi..

550
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:54,238
Ouch! My foot.. God it hurts.

551
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:55,471
Left or right?

552
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:57,072
Both..

553
00:36:57,948 --> 00:36:59,074
You were badly hurt?

554
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:03,013
No silly.. l pretended
so he would stay.

555
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,915
Way to go boss, l'd
have done the same.

556
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,016
..but what about the oath?

557
00:37:10,593 --> 00:37:11,924
He is half Brit isn't he..

558
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:14,156
..so l compromised.

559
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,066
Must admit..

560
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,126
Drink something

561
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,964
l'll have .. Pepsi!

562
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,731
No not Pepsi, Seven Up..

563
00:37:49,173 --> 00:37:50,697
Actually Tango..

564
00:37:50,774 --> 00:37:55,234
..and chips, cookies
and that chocolate..

565
00:37:57,281 --> 00:37:59,579
l was praying that a
miracle would happen.

566
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,813
..and Humera would vanish forever..

567
00:38:02,886 --> 00:38:05,013
..and not ruin the foot massage.

568
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,885
Those fingers were just magical

569
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:21,602
Fingers so delicate, arms so strong..

570
00:38:21,738 --> 00:38:24,263
..he carried me all the
way to my bedroom..

571
00:38:34,284 --> 00:38:36,149
He was forcing Michelle to dance ..

572
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:38,746
Michelle?

573
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:40,619
Yeah.. that's her name..

574
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:43,287
Michelle didn't want to dance..

575
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:45,326
..but he insisted..

576
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:47,787
l stopped him ..

577
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:51,334
He hit you so hard?

578
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:53,900
Just a scratch.

579
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:58,240
He's still going through
plastic surgery..

580
00:38:59,843 --> 00:39:05,748
So then you and Michelle .. Got
married or still dating?

581
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,247
She wasn't the one.

582
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:10,377
O ..

583
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:13,917
Your parents are amazing ..

584
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:16,852
He barged into your bedroom
and they didn't even mind.

585
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:19,919
Why would they .. he saved
their daughter ..

586
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:22,961
Papa-Mama had found
their son-in-law..

587
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:24,725
Son-in-law!

588
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:29,364
You met the thug an hour ago.. and
you're already planning marriage..

589
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:30,736
Thug!

590
00:39:30,807 --> 00:39:34,766
With a foot-long scar on his face..
has to be a thug!

591
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:37,003
Forget it l'm not telling
you the rest of the story.

592
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:39,808
Ok sorry..

593
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,278
You get stuck in these small details.

594
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:45,847
The flavour is all in
the small details ..

595
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:47,919
How did he look..

596
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:49,951
What did he say..

597
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:52,022
How did he touch..

598
00:39:52,963 --> 00:39:54,021
Where did he touch..

599
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:55,291
Ok so who touched what where?

600
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:56,423
Good night.

601
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:58,433
Don't let Superman bite.

602
00:39:58,936 --> 00:39:59,994
Good night.

603
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:10,145
Shit! Phone number!

604
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:13,715
Steve..

605
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:16,010
Steve!

606
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:24,722
Hey Steve.. give me your
number.. please!

607
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:29,096
Where would l have found him ..

608
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:31,390
There are thousands of
Steves in London ..

609
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:34,930
Next day was like hell ..

610
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:37,469
..but when l came back from
work next evening ..

611
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:39,967
..then..

612
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:44,872
l'll get it!

613
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:48,809
Hello?

614
00:40:48,885 --> 00:40:49,977
Hi ..

615
00:40:50,854 --> 00:40:53,152
Thanks for the flowers
and the chocolates..

616
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:54,485
Can you walk alright ..?

617
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:56,123
Just about ..

618
00:40:56,193 --> 00:40:58,184
Then you need another
round of massage.

619
00:40:58,262 --> 00:41:00,321
My car's waiting for you.. Bye..

620
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:01,455
Bye!

621
00:41:14,778 --> 00:41:17,076
Find it funny.. l was in such pain..

622
00:41:19,383 --> 00:41:20,816
You lied..

623
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:23,317
lf you lie ..

624
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:25,014
..it always catches up with you.

625
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:27,447
Lie, go ahead and lie..

626
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:31,260
..but make sure it's palatable..

627
00:41:32,396 --> 00:41:33,886
..Huffy Bhai says.

628
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:37,131
So then you limped all
the way to meet him.

629
00:42:14,304 --> 00:42:16,829
l hopped, skipped and
jumped to his office..

630
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:20,833
..but as l entered the edifice..
l was psyched..

631
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,844
lt's not that l have holes
in my pockets..

632
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,981
..but this guy was bigger
than Prince Charles..

633
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:35,416
A snap of his fingers..

634
00:42:35,492 --> 00:42:38,256
..and all the Bond Street beauties
would line up at his door..

635
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,327
For a moment l was scared..

636
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:48,428
..then l thought,
let's deal with it.

637
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:00,607
Hi Al ..

638
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:02,376
Al?

639
00:43:03,353 --> 00:43:04,411
How do you know..?

640
00:43:11,962 --> 00:43:13,259
Friends call you Al..

641
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:16,095
Mama-Papa call you Allo ..

642
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:20,361
Allo's cute ..

643
00:43:20,437 --> 00:43:23,998
Please! Sounds like the
name of a fat cat.

644
00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:28,000
..Work at the House
of Fraser ..Manager.

645
00:43:29,413 --> 00:43:34,043
Visit the church every
morning before office.

646
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:36,051
A five minute prayer. Five minutes.

647
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:38,484
No more, no less.

648
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:41,016
This guy's a police officer
or a gangster?

649
00:43:41,224 --> 00:43:43,283
Are you a gangster or
a police officer..

650
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:46,587
l haven't committed a crime?

651
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,927
Yes you have..

652
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:51,126
..You made me fall in love with you.

653
00:43:56,573 --> 00:43:59,167
What do you do in such a huge office?

654
00:44:01,111 --> 00:44:02,169
Lemme guess ..

655
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:04,543
..blackmailing.

656
00:44:05,048 --> 00:44:06,174
Pretty close.

657
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,010
We're lawyers. Singh and
Smith and Company..

658
00:44:11,254 --> 00:44:14,985
You're Steve Singh of 'Singh
and Smith'?! Wow!

659
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:17,588
You're so .. so ..

660
00:44:18,228 --> 00:44:19,354
Horrible?

661
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:20,960
And young too..

662
00:44:22,566 --> 00:44:25,034
Now explain the pictures..

663
00:44:26,436 --> 00:44:29,030
You're not going to decorate
your house with them are you?

664
00:44:29,706 --> 00:44:31,196
Not a bad idea..

665
00:44:31,274 --> 00:44:32,332
Steve!

666
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:33,569
Okay look ..

667
00:44:34,044 --> 00:44:37,241
This company has a board of directors
..are you with me?

668
00:44:38,181 --> 00:44:39,239
Good ..

669
00:44:39,316 --> 00:44:41,307
..now the board has decided ..

670
00:44:41,585 --> 00:44:44,110
..that l should propose to you ..

671
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,047
Propose?!

672
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:51,087
How does the board know about us?

673
00:44:51,161 --> 00:44:53,026
The board knows everything ..

674
00:44:55,232 --> 00:44:56,290
Ok.

675
00:44:57,267 --> 00:44:59,997
l don't care on whose
behest you propose..

676
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,528
..go ahead propose. l'm ready!

677
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:06,999
The proposal is that you
sue Madame Tussaud's..

678
00:45:07,077 --> 00:45:09,477
..for the Superman accident..

679
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:11,605
..and appoint me your lawyer..

680
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,641
But don't accept this proposal..

681
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:19,112
l've done my duty.

682
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:22,355
l'll tell the Board of Directors..

683
00:45:23,193 --> 00:45:24,421
..that you've refused.

684
00:45:26,396 --> 00:45:30,230
But why don't you want me
to sue Madame Tussaud's?

685
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:35,395
lf l wasn't in love with
you, l'd love you to.

686
00:45:36,172 --> 00:45:39,539
Within seconds l would've gotten
you to sign the papers ..

687
00:45:40,443 --> 00:45:49,147
Within days.. l would've
used you as a client..

688
00:45:50,186 --> 00:45:53,178
lf, l wasn't in love with you..

689
00:45:55,225 --> 00:45:57,056
How much money?

690
00:45:58,061 --> 00:45:59,323
About a million ..

691
00:45:59,396 --> 00:46:00,454
Million pound!

692
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,522
Wow! Million pounds?

693
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:07,161
Champagne or juice?

694
00:46:07,237 --> 00:46:08,295
Ok..

695
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:11,264
Champagne okay or juice okay?

696
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:14,237

697
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:15,802
Al ..

698
00:46:16,246 --> 00:46:17,577
Can l call you Al?

699
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:18,705
Hmm ..

700
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:23,782
Al .. you don't have to
get involved in this.

701
00:46:24,254 --> 00:46:26,313
But l want to get involved.

702
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:30,089
You've done so much for me ..

703
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,254
..the least l can do is help you.

704
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:36,590
Al ..

705
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,566
..you're such a simple girl..

706
00:46:39,102 --> 00:46:41,161
Who says l'm simple?

707
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:43,703
Come let's fix the deal ..

708
00:46:44,507 --> 00:46:49,137
..if we win you take your
commission from the compensation.

709
00:46:49,512 --> 00:46:53,107
..but if we lose, it's your loss.

710
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:55,350
Smart girl!

711
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:57,177
Steve said the same thing.

712
00:46:58,688 --> 00:46:59,814
Smart girl.

713
00:47:01,424 --> 00:47:03,153
Okay .. deal.

714
00:47:04,494 --> 00:47:07,520
- To Superman! - To Superman!

715
00:47:11,434 --> 00:47:12,492
This isn't the right time.

716
00:47:14,204 --> 00:47:15,262
Why?

717
00:47:16,373 --> 00:47:19,831
lt's eight thirty..
too early for you?

718
00:47:21,444 --> 00:47:22,502
Ms. Khan ..

719
00:47:23,546 --> 00:47:26,447
l'm your lawyer ..
you're my client ..

720
00:47:27,317 --> 00:47:32,311
..our relationship should stay
professional till we win the case..

721
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:34,314
Till then ..

722
00:47:36,226 --> 00:47:37,352
Let's stay away.

723
00:47:42,232 --> 00:47:43,893
Too much..

724
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:45,625
lsn't it.

725
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:49,338
Really too much. Really.

726
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:53,732
How did he stop himself
at the last moment?

727
00:47:55,612 --> 00:47:59,571
Not everybody can do that ..
you need to have balls.

728
00:48:00,316 --> 00:48:02,284
This is called self control.

729
00:48:02,686 --> 00:48:05,211
This is called.. class.

730
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:08,224
Just look at her.. my client.

731
00:48:08,558 --> 00:48:09,616
Does she want riches?

732
00:48:09,693 --> 00:48:10,819
No.

733
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:12,888
Does she want revenge? No my lord.

734
00:48:13,296 --> 00:48:17,198
She wants your compassion,
your sympathy..

735
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:18,632
..and my love..

736
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,937
Hey! Stay away from
the Kiss of Love..

737
00:48:35,618 --> 00:48:37,848
O they kill me, those tangy eyes

738
00:48:37,921 --> 00:48:39,912
Kiss of love, kiss of love

739
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:42,287
Falling stars fill up my skies

740
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:44,349
Kiss of love, kiss of love

741
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:46,486
O they kill me, those tangy eyes

742
00:48:46,563 --> 00:48:48,531
Kiss of love, kiss of love

743
00:48:48,598 --> 00:48:50,725
Falling stars fill up my skies

744
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,859
Kiss of love, kiss of love

745
00:48:52,936 --> 00:48:55,336
O when l steal a peek into your eyes

746
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,670
You rob me of a breath

747
00:49:01,644 --> 00:49:03,874
O when l steal a peek into your eyes

748
00:49:03,947 --> 00:49:05,812
You rob me of a breath

749
00:49:05,882 --> 00:49:08,282
O shut them tight O shut those eyes

750
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,683
They're raiders running red

751
00:49:10,754 --> 00:49:14,656
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love

752
00:49:18,995 --> 00:49:23,432
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love

753
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:05,533
O the helpless trappings

754
00:50:11,314 --> 00:50:14,340
Of this brazen heart

755
00:50:14,984 --> 00:50:17,043
A night seems like eternity

756
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,747
When it's spent apart

757
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:21,954
Your love has made me many things

758
00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:23,890
A weaver, too, of dreams

759
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,360
l lie awake a thousand years

760
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:28,363
Sleep a thousand it seems

761
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:32,492
When you drop your bashful gaze

762
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:36,369
The stars come tumbling down

763
00:50:37,006 --> 00:50:39,338
O shut them tight O shut those eyes

764
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:41,707
They're raiders running red

765
00:50:41,778 --> 00:50:45,578
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love

766
00:50:49,886 --> 00:50:54,380
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love

767
00:50:58,862 --> 00:51:04,596
The English court of Law decides
the case in favour of Ms. Khan.

768
00:51:26,723 --> 00:51:30,090
To you, my plea

769
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:34,552
Do your duty

770
00:51:40,036 --> 00:51:44,029
Touch my pulse

771
00:51:44,107 --> 00:51:47,702
And set me free

772
00:51:47,977 --> 00:51:50,844
Don't turn back for
a peek at the world

773
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:52,882
You might trip and tumble down

774
00:51:53,049 --> 00:51:55,108
With a foot thump swing
in dance and a twirl

775
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:57,414
This moment will come around

776
00:51:57,487 --> 00:51:59,682
When you drop your bashful gaze

777
00:52:01,824 --> 00:52:04,122
The stars come tumbling down

778
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:08,095
O shut them tight O shut those eyes

779
00:52:08,164 --> 00:52:10,496
They're raiders running red

780
00:52:10,566 --> 00:52:14,593
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love

781
00:52:14,671 --> 00:52:18,835
Stay away, stay away, stay
away from the kiss of love

782
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:23,140
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love

783
00:52:23,212 --> 00:52:27,546
Stay away, stay away, stay
away from the kiss of love

784
00:52:27,617 --> 00:52:32,020
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love

785
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,721
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love

786
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:47,466
Hey! Stay away from the kiss of love

787
00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:54,934
So you two ..

788
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:56,103
Got engaged.

789
00:52:56,546 --> 00:52:59,709
No l mean you and he .. you know ..

790
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,517
..you had sex?

791
00:53:03,987 --> 00:53:05,113
We made love.

792
00:53:07,824 --> 00:53:09,849
Good good .. nice..

793
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,825
But your hero.. he's kind of filmi..

794
00:53:13,563 --> 00:53:14,621
Much better than you.

795
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:17,957
lsn't stingy in buying flowers
for his girlfriend.

796
00:53:18,868 --> 00:53:20,836
He's much stingier than me..

797
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:24,005
..if he's such a millionaire why
isn't he coming by air to meet you?

798
00:53:24,073 --> 00:53:25,802
..why is he coming by train?

799
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:26,967
Because of work..

800
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:29,507
..there's a case involving
British Railways..

801
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,547
..which he's investigating
on the train..

802
00:53:32,782 --> 00:53:33,840
Great now he's going to
screw the railways..

803
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:34,974
What?

804
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:38,043
Ok fine he's not stingy ..

805
00:53:38,654 --> 00:53:40,121
..but he's still a lawyer ..

806
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,214
..you be careful.

807
00:53:42,892 --> 00:53:45,861
How'd you know? You
haven't even met him?

808
00:53:46,996 --> 00:53:48,827
As if meeting him is going
to change anything ..

809
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:50,024
lt'll change your opinion of him.

810
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:54,100
Fine, so we'll meet.. Just
a matter of another hour.

811
00:53:56,873 --> 00:53:58,101
Oh blimey!

812
00:53:58,674 --> 00:54:01,700
Get going buddy. The train
must have arrived..

813
00:54:01,778 --> 00:54:03,609
You took so long to tell the story.

814
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:05,078
Because you kept interrupting.

815
00:54:05,148 --> 00:54:06,274
Let's not fight now.

816
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:07,543
Ok.

817
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:09,244
You carry on.. l'll just
buy some doughnuts.

818
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:10,615
Doughnuts?!

819
00:54:10,686 --> 00:54:13,246
For Anaida.. she must be hungry.

820
00:54:13,723 --> 00:54:15,190
That's very sweet.

821
00:54:15,258 --> 00:54:16,555
l got class.

822
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,718
Bye.

823
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:19,853
Bye ..

824
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,094
When did this train get here?

825
00:54:25,301 --> 00:54:26,825
Half an hour ago ..

826
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:28,800
But wasn't it an hour late?

827
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:31,135
Late?! Left Manchester on time..

828
00:54:32,175 --> 00:54:36,077
Manchester?! What happened
to the Birmingham train?

829
00:54:37,246 --> 00:54:39,806
O blimey! Another hour late!

830
00:55:38,808 --> 00:55:40,105
Another hour late!

831
00:55:41,043 --> 00:55:42,101
Damn!

832
00:55:42,245 --> 00:55:43,303
Blimey!

833
00:55:44,814 --> 00:55:45,872
Coffee?

834
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:48,908
Only coffee.

835
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:50,814
l'll have a doughnut with my coffee.

836
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:53,880
No! l don't mean that ..

837
00:55:54,123 --> 00:55:57,115
..only coffee, nothing else ..

838
00:55:57,793 --> 00:55:58,919
..you know.

839
00:55:58,995 --> 00:56:00,758
l know l know .. l love Anaida.

840
00:56:01,063 --> 00:56:03,122
So? l love Steve.

841
00:56:03,399 --> 00:56:05,230
Steve seems the cuppa tea type..

842
00:56:05,301 --> 00:56:07,360
No cuppa tea, only coffee..

843
00:56:07,436 --> 00:56:10,371
Our eyes they fly like kites up high

844
00:56:10,439 --> 00:56:12,964
The threads of our gazes collide

845
00:56:13,042 --> 00:56:15,738
Drink the dew, that heady brew
'n jus' sway baby sway

846
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:20,839
Sway this way this sway this
way sway this way this way

847
00:56:20,917 --> 00:56:25,911
Sway this way this sway this
way sway this way this way

848
00:56:25,988 --> 00:56:31,187
Sway this way this sway this
way sway this way this way

849
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:36,129
Sway this way this sway this
way sway this way this way

850
00:56:52,998 --> 00:56:54,090
Disgusting.

851
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:56,432
She's nice.. why disgusting?

852
00:56:57,002 --> 00:56:58,230
Not her. You're disgusting.

853
00:56:58,337 --> 00:57:00,498
You're worse than my neighbour.

854
00:57:02,007 --> 00:57:03,201
What does he do?

855
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:04,672
Lives in the house right
opposite mine.

856
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:09,071
Whenever l'm in my room he spies
on me through his telescope.

857
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,642
You must be doing something
to tempt him.

858
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:14,343
Me?

859
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:20,583
Aho! Aho! Aho!

860
00:57:21,326 --> 00:57:22,384
l don't do anything..

861
00:57:25,364 --> 00:57:26,422
C'mon game.

862
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:28,291
l'm not playing.

863
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:33,670
First you'll do one thing that you've
never done but l've done,

864
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:37,106
Then l'll do one thing that l've
never done but you've done.

865
00:57:38,043 --> 00:57:39,271
l've done everything..

866
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:42,504
Your turn first.. follow me.

867
00:57:42,681 --> 00:57:46,276
l'm not going anywhere.. we play
right here, in front of everybody.

868
00:57:49,154 --> 00:57:52,317
l'm not that kinda guy..
l got class man..

869
00:57:53,058 --> 00:57:55,492
lf l wanted to kiss
you l'd have asked.

870
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:57,153
This is the limit.

871
00:57:57,262 --> 00:58:00,129
You.. just forget it.

872
00:58:00,632 --> 00:58:02,361
Just sip the coffee and
read the newspaper..

873
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:07,061
Sorry.

874
00:58:11,076 --> 00:58:12,373
Go up on that escalator.

875
00:58:13,212 --> 00:58:14,406
But it's coming down.

876
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:17,345
So? You've never climbed up an
escalator that's coming down?

877
00:58:17,449 --> 00:58:19,576
l have. Many times.

878
00:58:19,651 --> 00:58:21,516
Off you go. This is the game.

879
00:58:22,354 --> 00:58:23,412
This is crazy.

880
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:24,547
l don't bother for it..

881
00:58:27,192 --> 00:58:28,250
Hold this.

882
00:58:32,297 --> 00:58:33,423
Get started..

883
00:58:35,534 --> 00:58:36,592
You gone crazy.

884
00:58:36,668 --> 00:58:38,101
Mind your own business.

885
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,138
This escalator's coming down.

886
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:41,297
Oh really l didn't know.

887
00:58:41,373 --> 00:58:42,431
You'll hurt yourself.

888
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:43,566
Keep quite!

889
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:45,467
ldiot!

890
00:58:45,544 --> 00:58:46,602
Moron!

891
00:58:50,149 --> 00:58:51,207
Not bad.

892
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,382
Ok.

893
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:08,365
Ok my turn next.

894
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:10,693
Rikki eveready..

895
00:59:12,137 --> 00:59:13,229
Have you ever gotten a tattoo done?

896
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:15,365
No.

897
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,498
Have you?

898
00:59:17,743 --> 00:59:19,176
Liar.. show.

899
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:21,405
Can't.. it's here..

900
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,482
l'm not doing anything
till l see it myself.

901
00:59:30,155 --> 00:59:32,589
God you're impossible. Hold this..

902
00:59:34,426 --> 00:59:35,484
Higher..

903
00:59:38,597 --> 00:59:39,655
Here.

904
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:43,559
Happy.. ?

905
00:59:44,169 --> 00:59:45,261
But what is it?

906
00:59:45,637 --> 00:59:46,695
Butterfly.

907
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:48,230
Oh.

908
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:50,433
Show again.

909
00:59:51,176 --> 00:59:52,336
You wish! C'mon!

910
00:59:59,184 --> 01:00:01,675
Bring it on big mamma.. kill me..

911
01:00:03,188 --> 01:00:04,280
Boom Shankar!

912
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:14,556
Just imagine..

913
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,297
..if you and l were not engaged..

914
01:00:21,373 --> 01:00:25,332
..and Anaida and Steve had bumped
into each other on the train..

915
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,438
Now just suppose..

916
01:00:30,215 --> 01:00:33,275
..if Steve-Anaida had met..
had coffee together..

917
01:00:33,385 --> 01:00:34,511
..chatted up..

918
01:00:34,586 --> 01:00:37,555
..you think they would've hit it off?

919
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,618
Fallen in love?

920
01:00:45,664 --> 01:00:48,326
Then Steve would've
been Anaida's Rikki..

921
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,334
..and Anaida would've
been Steve's Alvira.

922
01:00:52,337 --> 01:00:55,636
Then what would've happened
to Rikki and Alvira?

923
01:00:57,242 --> 01:00:58,334
You flirting?

924
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:59,807
What do you mean by Rikki and Alvira?

925
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:02,243
Why don't you just say you and l..

926
01:01:02,314 --> 01:01:03,406
Right ok..

927
01:01:04,683 --> 01:01:07,243
..if we had met, just like that..

928
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,378
l mean..

929
01:01:09,521 --> 01:01:11,682
..if Steve and Anaida were
out of the picture..

930
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:14,917
Then what would've happened?

931
01:01:20,465 --> 01:01:21,591
Say..

932
01:01:53,732 --> 01:01:58,328
Pluck threads of light from
the weave of the moon

933
01:02:04,376 --> 01:02:08,676
And knit yourself a veil

934
01:02:14,953 --> 01:02:19,447
Pluck threads of light from
the weave of the moon

935
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:24,724
And knit yourself a veil

936
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:30,325
lf l'm shy l'll face
your warm embrace

937
01:02:30,435 --> 01:02:36,431
Entwine your breath in mine

938
01:02:36,508 --> 01:02:41,468
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke

939
01:02:41,613 --> 01:02:45,777
Your lips so halke
halke Hold me halke

940
01:02:46,952 --> 01:02:51,821
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke

941
01:02:52,391 --> 01:02:56,350
Your lips so halke
halke Hold me halke

942
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,731
Here's the Taj Mahal.

943
01:03:37,402 --> 01:03:38,767
A red stone Taj?

944
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:42,636
lt is the Taj. Someone's
painted it red.

945
01:03:43,975 --> 01:03:45,943
Tell me this monument's
name, or l'll leave.

946
01:03:50,415 --> 01:03:51,507
King Humayun's Tomb.

947
01:03:53,452 --> 01:03:55,852
Didn't have the money to take you
to Agra and show you the real Taj.

948
01:03:56,421 --> 01:03:57,513
Sorry.

949
01:03:59,591 --> 01:04:02,424
From today Humayun's Tomb
is the Taj for me..

950
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:06,863
As beautiful as our love..

951
01:04:13,104 --> 01:04:17,939
Come exchange your sleep for mine

952
01:04:18,443 --> 01:04:23,471
Give me a dream, take one from me

953
01:04:23,882 --> 01:04:28,512
There's one dream trapped
inside these eyes

954
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:33,923
One beneath a pillow moon

955
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:43,592
Let's put to bed this sleepless sky

956
01:04:43,668 --> 01:04:45,966
Come join me in a lullabye

957
01:04:46,037 --> 01:04:50,838
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke

958
01:04:51,076 --> 01:04:55,479
Your lips so halke
halke Hold me halke

959
01:04:56,481 --> 01:05:01,578
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke

960
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:06,114
Your lips so halke
halke Hold me halke

961
01:05:33,952 --> 01:05:36,512
One should cover their head before
entering a Gurdwara (Sikh temple)

962
01:05:38,857 --> 01:05:39,915
Even in the Dargah.

963
01:05:44,129 --> 01:05:46,529
Must cleanse your body before
offering prayers to the Gurdwara..

964
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:50,061
Same at the Dargah.

965
01:06:01,613 --> 01:06:03,046
What l get from my Guru, will
l get from your shrine?

966
01:06:04,215 --> 01:06:05,580
They both house the love divine..

967
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:09,611
My devotion is your devotion..

968
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:14,650
Your love is my love..

969
01:06:14,893 --> 01:06:19,557
lt took us an endless age to say

970
01:06:19,998 --> 01:06:24,833
Two words, one eternal thought

971
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:30,064
That one day seemed a hundred years

972
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:35,876
Another hundred the night forgot

973
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:41,018
How would it be if soft,
slow, silent

974
01:06:41,653 --> 01:06:47,717
Eternity were in a moment caught

975
01:06:58,103 --> 01:07:03,006
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke

976
01:07:03,642 --> 01:07:06,236
Your lips so halke halke

977
01:07:18,957 --> 01:07:20,015
Taj!

978
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:23,719
No, Humayun's Tomb.

979
01:07:26,998 --> 01:07:29,193
As beautiful as our love.

980
01:07:31,069 --> 01:07:33,867
No profit, no loss,
no virtue, no sin..

981
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,737
Love infinite love..

982
01:07:40,912 --> 01:07:41,970
Marry me.

983
01:07:46,017 --> 01:07:49,578
Then every year we'll celebrate
our wedding anniversary..

984
01:07:49,654 --> 01:07:52,748
..right here at Taj.

985
01:07:55,694 --> 01:07:56,786
Every year Taj?

986
01:07:59,664 --> 01:08:00,722
Promise.

987
01:08:03,702 --> 01:08:04,828
l accept.

988
01:08:07,672 --> 01:08:12,109
Pluck threads of light from
the weave of the moon

989
01:08:18,183 --> 01:08:23,678
And knit yourself a veil

990
01:08:27,792 --> 01:08:30,727
lf l'm shy l'll face

991
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:33,696
Your warm embrace

992
01:08:33,865 --> 01:08:39,701
Entwine your breath in mine

993
01:08:39,771 --> 01:08:44,265
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke

994
01:08:44,809 --> 01:08:48,939
Your lips so halke halke
Hold me halke

995
01:08:50,148 --> 01:08:55,108
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke

996
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,747
Your lips so halke halke
Hold me halke

997
01:09:09,901 --> 01:09:10,959
So..

998
01:09:13,772 --> 01:09:15,000
What would've happened
between us..

999
01:09:15,073 --> 01:09:16,301
..if Steve and Anaida
weren't in the picture?

1000
01:09:17,742 --> 01:09:20,370
What would've happened?
Would've been war.

1001
01:09:25,016 --> 01:09:26,108
Right..

1002
01:09:27,852 --> 01:09:28,978
.. war.

1003
01:09:29,754 --> 01:09:31,278
Nothing else could've happened.

1004
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,183
No chance at all..

1005
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:40,697
The train coming in from Birmingham
has arrived on Platform number 3.

1006
01:09:40,765 --> 01:09:43,256
Sorry for the inconvenience.

1007
01:09:46,771 --> 01:09:48,796
Train's come too soon.

1008
01:09:49,874 --> 01:09:51,000
Soon?

1009
01:09:51,776 --> 01:09:52,834
Late by two hours..

1010
01:09:55,046 --> 01:09:58,777
Late it is but still
too soon isn't it?

1011
01:10:00,218 --> 01:10:01,276
Sorry?

1012
01:10:04,088 --> 01:10:05,988
You go get your doughnuts.

1013
01:10:12,997 --> 01:10:14,123
Bye.
