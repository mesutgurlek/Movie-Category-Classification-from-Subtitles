1
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,262
Hey, Carlos. Did you learn this song
I wrote for Miss Brooks?

2
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:17,167
She'll be here in a couple minutes.

3
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,501
When you sing,
put your heart and soul into it.

4
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,234
Don't let her get away from you.

5
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,709
Don't worry.
When I sing, they never get away.

6
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,108
Good.

7
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:28,250
On second thought, you better
put my heart and soul into it, huh?

8
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:29,612
Okay.

9
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:31,014
Ladies and gentlemen...

10
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:35,055
...the famous Colombian baritone,
Señor Carlos Ramirez.

11
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:26,874
Hey, Carlos, there she is.

12
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,570
Let go, Carlos, please.

13
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,517
Please, Carlos, don't...

14
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,188
Sorry.

15
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,089
Hello, how are you?

16
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:57,755
I'm sorry.

17
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,004
Hello, how are you?

18
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,050
Gee, it's fun to be people.

19
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,189
- Darling.
- Yes, dear?

20
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:15,023
I wrote a letter to Dean Clinton last night.
I told her to get a new swimming teacher.

21
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,660
Sweetheart.

22
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:21,462
I just put a call through to George Adams
and told him to find a new songwriter.

23
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,869
- Darling.
- Yes, dear?

24
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,339
- I've a surprise for you.
- What?

25
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,501
I can cook.

26
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,614
Sweetheart, I have a surprise for you.

27
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:34,647
I can't eat.

28
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,064
Have these things
taken up to my room, will you?

29
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,967
- Name, please?
- Adams. George Adams.

30
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,303
- Very well, sir.
- Hello, George, what are you doing here?

31
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:05,208
Hello, Cugie, I'm here to find out
what goes on with that crazy songwriter.

32
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,848
You mean Elliott?

33
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,176
I mean Elliott.

34
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,342
He came to write music
for my water pageant.

35
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,009
And what do I get?

36
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:14,952
Nothing. I send at least 20 wires
asking what's wrong.

37
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:16,591
What does he answer?

38
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,058
Nothing. Cugie, I can't stand it.
What's happened to him? Where is he?

39
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:22,356
He's at the pool, of course.
Where else?

40
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:25,432
The pool? What are you talking about?
He hates water.

41
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,195
But wait till you see what's in it.

42
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,896
Oh, no. Don't tell me it's a woman.
I can't believe it.

43
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:34,804
- Steve would never fall for a bathing suit.
- But wait till you see what's in it.

44
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:39,311
You know, he plans to marry that girl.
Settle down here and retire.

45
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:41,279
Retire?

46
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:46,086
- No, no, no...
- Oh, yes, yes, yes...

47
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,746
But what am I gonna do
with Harry James?

48
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:52,121
What will I do with my water pageant,
these pipes, pumps and faucets?

49
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,592
I don't know.
Have you seen a plumber?

50
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,059
I beg your pardon.
I don't think I know you.

51
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:04,172
You don't, huh? Listen.
Don't try to give me the brushoff.

52
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,241
- I knew you when.
- When he what?

53
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,843
Yes, of course. How stupid of me.
It's little Mary Donovan.

54
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:17,884
Maria Dorango to you,
you big phony.

55
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:21,113
"I'm gonna make a star of you,
my dear girl.

56
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,781
I'm going to put your name
up in lights."

57
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,554
You put my name in your address book
and that's as far as it ever went.

58
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,131
But I never forgot you.
I was just waiting for the right role.

59
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:43,643
Darling, are you sure you're going
to be happy living here?

60
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:46,646
I was never so sure of anything
in all my life.

61
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,785
From now on, no more Tin Pan Alley,
no more smoky nightclubs...

62
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:52,750
...no more Broadway producers
like George Adams.

63
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,982
I'll never write another
boogie-woogie tune as long as I live.

64
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:59,821
With you as my inspiration, I can write
important music like symphonies...

65
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:02,463
...and tone poems or sonatas.

66
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:05,191
- We're still gonna be married tomorrow.
- Yes, of course.

67
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:10,498
Providing my grandfather
wires his consent and my dowry.

68
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:11,901
Your dowry?

69
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,338
- You mean, I'm gonna get money too?
- Oh, come on.

70
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,645
He can't do this to me.
I'm his best friend.

71
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:23,512
I'll get those songs
if I have to stop that marriage.

72
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:27,451
Maria, I've got it.
How good an actress are you?

73
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:28,715
- Well, l...
- Fine.

74
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,724
You're about to play the biggest part
of your career. Come on.

75
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,363
If there is anyone here who can show why
they shouldn't be joined in holy wedlock...

76
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,628
...let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

77
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:45,006
Do you, Caroline, take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband?

78
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:46,163
I do.

79
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:49,175
Do you, Steven, take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

80
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,369
I do.

81
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:53,515
I now pronounce you man and wife.

82
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,079
Stop.

83
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,153
What's the meaning of this?

84
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:00,879
This man is my husband.

85
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,216
- What?
- What?

86
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:03,585
- What?
- What proof have you?

87
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,090
What proof have I?

88
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,359
Oh, now... No, no, believe me.

89
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:17,028
Caroline.

90
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,947
Would you care for some lunch,
Miss Brooks?

91
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:37,187
You've got to connect me.
She's my husband. I mean, I'm her wife.

92
00:14:37,726 --> 00:14:41,287
She checked out. Well, did she
leave a forwarding address?

93
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,363
Oh, she didn't, huh?

94
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:44,726
Okay.

95
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,663
George, she's gone and I've lost her.

96
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,929
- Steady, Steve. Caroline isn't the only girl.
- Well, she is for me.

97
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:54,041
We'll leave for New York immediately.
In times of stress, work is the solution.

98
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:56,302
Now, you finish packing.
I'll pay the bill.

99
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,571
Buck up. You must bury yourself
in your music.

100
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:01,147
Yeah, I'd just as soon bury myself.

101
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,046
Hello?

102
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:05,243
Cugie.

103
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,946
That crazy Dorango woman
been around?

104
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:09,351
She disappeared?

105
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,753
Why does she do this to me?

106
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,791
- Steve, I saw her.
- Which one?

107
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,896
- The good one, Caroline.
- Where?

108
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:17,089
She was at the travel window
buying a ticket.

109
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,530
Well, ticket for what?

110
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,026
You know where she was going?

111
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:24,195
I don't remember.
Something like, a cow.

112
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:27,365
Cow? Don't tell me
she went to Moscow?

113
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:28,703
No.

114
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,435
Istanbul?

115
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,171
No.

116
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:36,177
- Is there some such place as Jersey?
- Well, there's New Jersey.

117
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,914
That's where Victoria College is.
She's gone back to her old job. Come on.

118
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,428
- Hey, is this Victoria College?
- It isn't West Point.

119
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:56,162
Well, we finally made it. Fling open
the gates, my good man, I'm in a hurry.

120
00:15:56,338 --> 00:16:00,138
Just hold your horses. The gates don't
fling until I find out what you want.

121
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:03,301
Oh, I wanna see
Miss Caroline Brooks.

122
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:04,970
Take off your hat.

123
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,344
- l...
- You aren't gonna see her.

124
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,248
We don't allow men in this school...

125
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:15,652
...and especially,
we don't allow men with red hair.

126
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,449
Well, I didn't know...

127
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:20,652
Oh, you don't allow men, huh?

128
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,160
What's that guy, a tomboy?

129
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:26,165
That's Professor Evans.
Professors don't count.

130
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:27,632
That guy can't read, either.

131
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:30,601
Nobody gets through these
but parents, teachers, students.

132
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:33,003
- Well, now, l...
- But you are a parent.

133
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,802
What about Tom, Dick and Harry?

134
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:38,136
You're wasting your time, mister.

135
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:40,543
Tell her to call me
at the Town and Country Club.

136
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:42,479
It's a matter of life and death.

137
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,141
Mine.

138
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,818
- Very pretty, but that one's flat.
- Oh, how are you, Harry?

139
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:11,255
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

140
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:14,088
I've been trying to get into college.

141
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:16,828
- Where's George?
- Out with a posse looking for you.

142
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:20,025
- He needs that music, Steve, so do I.
- Don't worry. You'll get it.

143
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,295
- Yeah?
- I'll start first thing in the morning.

144
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,770
Swell, now, don't go away.
I'll be back right after this number.

145
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,889
If you don't mind, sir?

146
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,658
Well, thanks a lot.
What are you, a musician?

147
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,130
No, attorney.

148
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:55,336
- Do you wanna know something?
- No, I don't.

149
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,369
I was gonna be married next month.

150
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:58,699
I was married last month.

151
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:02,435
It's that darn charter.
If I don't change it, I'll lose my job.

152
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:06,172
And if I lose my job, I'll lose my girl.
And if I lose my girl, I'm lost.

153
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,010
- Yeah, I've already lost mine.
- Your job?

154
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,811
No, my girl.

155
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:13,648
- She's in Victoria College.
- So is the charter.

156
00:21:13,822 --> 00:21:17,724
- What charter?
- The charter I have to change.

157
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:20,020
The... Look...

158
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,663
Here's my girl. The girl...

159
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:26,961
- Now, here's my girl.
- I'm very happy to meet you.

160
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,729
And here's the charter.

161
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,806
And here's me.

162
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:38,003
Now, I have to change that
before I can get that.

163
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,613
Is that clear?

164
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,271
Oh, sure.

165
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,212
You're biting my girl.

166
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,685
Now, what's your trouble?

167
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:51,419
Well, sir, speaking in your language...

168
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,884
...that is me.

169
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,155
I need a haircut, don't I?

170
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,961
That is Victoria College.

171
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:03,263
And this is the gate man.

172
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:07,107
And this...

173
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,608
...is Caroline, the apple of me eye.

174
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,715
Now, I have to get past this
to get into that...

175
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:18,948
...to get this.

176
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:21,444
What are you doing?

177
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:24,023
I'm putting the charter
back in the college.

178
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:25,682
What charter?

179
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:29,194
The charter that I've been trying
to change.

180
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:33,323
- Look, Victoria is a woman's college.
- Yeah, and they don't allow men.

181
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:37,370
No, but it says in the charter
they do allow men.

182
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:40,235
That's why they want me to change it.

183
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,511
What kind of a man would wanna go
to a woman's college?

184
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:45,907
None.

185
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:48,106
A man should go to a man's college.

186
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,342
And a woman should go
to a woman's college.

187
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,113
And a child should go
to a child's college.

188
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,949
That's right.

189
00:22:58,226 --> 00:22:59,818
Charter?

190
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,335
Thank you, Professor Evans.

191
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:14,601
Your paper, "O'er Hill and Dale with Field
Glass and Camera" was most instructive.

192
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:15,970
- Splendid.
- Yes.

193
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,873
- Wonderful idea.
- Yes, it is splendid.

194
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:22,210
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt, Dean
Clinton, but there's a man in my office.

195
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,579
- Well?
- Well, he wants to register.

196
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:28,086
- Well, whom does he want to register?
- Himself.

197
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:33,194
It's probably some silly college boy
sent here on an initiation stunt.

198
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:38,993
Oh, he isn't a boy. He's a man,
with red hair, and he's very determined.

199
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,528
Why should a man wish
to become a student here?

200
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:43,500
He says he has a thirst for knowledge.

201
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,607
And he wants to quench it
in our swimming pool.

202
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:52,940
Caroline, will you take care of this matter
while we continue with the meeting?

203
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:55,982
But Dean Clinton, wouldn't you rather...
I mean, wouldn't you...

204
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,346
No, dear, no. You take charge of it.

205
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,820
Just act the way you say I act,
when I'm not around to hear you say it.

206
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,695
Miss Caroline, I can't figure out
how he ever got past me.

207
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,304
He must've climbed over the wall.

208
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:18,803
Shall I throw him out?

209
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:22,034
No, no, you wait out in the hall.
I'll call you if he gets violent.

210
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,871
Yes.

211
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:27,107
- Caroline.
- I'm Miss Brooks.

212
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:30,410
I understand you wish
to enroll in Victoria College, Mr...

213
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:33,816
Elliott. Steven Elliott.
The husband of the same name.

214
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:37,322
You're not gonna be anybody's husband
pretty soon, you Casanova, you.

215
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:40,017
- I've started annulment proceedings.
- Oh, no, Caroline.

216
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,663
You can't. I'm innocent, believe me.

217
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:44,822
I was standing there
getting married, and...

218
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,594
- Oh, Caroline, you've gotta trust me.
- Trust you?

219
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:50,567
How can I trust you?
You redheaded bluebeard, you.

220
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,231
Oh, I'm not a blueheaded redbeard...
I mean, a...

221
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,441
Evidently you're not aware of it,
but this is a girls' school.

222
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:00,843
Evidently you're not aware of it,
Miss Brooks...

223
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:02,916
...but this is a girls' school for boys.

224
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:07,714
It says so in the charter.
Page 10, Section Six.

225
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:10,585
Of course, if you were to drop
the annulment proceedings...

226
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,694
...I might be persuaded not to enter.

227
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:18,232
You wait right here,
you blackmailer, you.

228
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,400
He claims this is
a coeducational institution.

229
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:29,203
That men and women are permitted.

230
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:32,039
He says it's in the charter.
Of course he's wrong?

231
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:34,682
- Unfortunately, he's right.
- What?

232
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:37,409
I was under the impression
our charter had been altered.

233
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:39,486
Lawyers have been working
on the matter.

234
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:42,384
At the moment,
a man is legally entitled to enroll here.

235
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:45,117
- Why... I've never heard.
- There's just one thing to do.

236
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,885
Have the fellow investigated.

237
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:49,292
- Oh, I don't think we ought to do that.
- Why not?

238
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,033
Well, think of the publicity.

239
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:56,660
Caroline is right. Victoria is noted
for its cloistered atmosphere.

240
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:59,329
Our students come
from the finest families.

241
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:01,600
Publicity of this sort
would be embarrassing.

242
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:03,073
Yes, that's right.

243
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,611
He must be gotten rid of
quickly and quietly.

244
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,476
- Yes, but how?
- Oh, that's very simple.

245
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,914
Each new student
is on two weeks' probation.

246
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:15,420
If during that period she or he acquires
a sufficient number of demerits...

247
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,751
...out she or he goes.

248
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:19,723
- Good.
- Yes.

249
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:23,125
Yes, now, if we all cooperate,
he should be out of here in no time.

250
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:24,287
Good.

251
00:26:32,474 --> 00:26:34,339
Well, Steve, you get your wish.

252
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:38,946
- You mean you'll cancel the annulment?
- No, I mean we accept your application.

253
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:46,780
All right. Bring on the enrollment blank,
pencil sharpener and my roommate.

254
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:53,120
Oh, may I carry that for you?

255
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:20,312
Hey, what am I?
A coal miner or a student?

256
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:27,355
Oh, now, this is charming.
What is it, the Victoria swap shop?

257
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:30,362
Unfortunately, all our best rooms
are occupied.

258
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:33,626
I hope you'll be
very uncomfortable here.

259
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,935
Now, here's your sche...

260
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,111
Here's your schedule of classes.
You'll find them quite heavy.

261
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:49,273
Gosh, what a romantic spot
for a honeymoon.

262
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:51,544
Here is your book of rules
and regulations.

263
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,052
You know, you have
the longest eyelashes.

264
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:56,190
You're expected
to follow those implicitly.

265
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:58,918
Your hair's kind of silky.
Did you ever try braiding it?

266
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,257
We especially stress neatness,
truthfulness and punctuality.

267
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,921
You know,
I dream about you every night.

268
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,034
Now we come to the subject
of discipline.

269
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:09,762
Each student is allowed 100 demerits
per semester.

270
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,599
You're lovelier than I remembered.

271
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,901
And we give them very freely,
especially to you.

272
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:17,601
One hundred and out you go.

273
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:21,078
Well, I can hardly wait.

274
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:22,443
Oh, really?

275
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,847
And 20 demerits for insubordination.

276
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:26,919
How many demerits
for kissing a teacher?

277
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:29,522
Enough to expel you, you wolf.

278
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:32,455
Caroline, Caroline, are you all right?
Open the door.

279
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,527
How dare you lock that door.

280
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:36,994
Well, why not?
You're my wife, aren't you?

281
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:40,066
Open this door
or I shall be forced to break it down.

282
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:48,140
Call him off. Call him off.
Call him off. Call him off.

283
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,608
- Did this oaf attempt to molest you?
- What do you mean, oaf? I happen...

284
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,873
Steven Elliott, the new student here.

285
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:56,278
Oh, it seems I was a trifle hasty.

286
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:58,476
Please accept my apology, old man.

287
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:03,056
You see, I'm inclined to be a trifle touchy
where Miss Brooks is concerned.

288
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:05,283
Oh, yeah?

289
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,893
Who do you happen to be, bub?

290
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:10,224
Why, this is Professor Evans,
your botany professor, Mr. Elliott.

291
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:13,561
He knows all there is to know
about Tropaeolium.

292
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,602
"Nasturtiums" to you.

293
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,670
Yeah? Nasturtiums to you too.

294
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,699
Caroline, we must allow Mr. Elliott
to clean his room, mustn't we?

295
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:25,334
Yes, we certainly must.
He ought to be ashamed of himself.

296
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:30,109
Oh, and by the way, I almost forgot.
Here is your freshman beanie.

297
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:33,686
You will be required to wear it
at all times.

298
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:35,579
And...

299
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,624
...you may find this useful. Good day.

300
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:40,226
Thank you.

301
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,671
Come on, now.

302
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,313
Hurry.

303
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:01,844
Hey, come on.

304
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,353
Oh, will you do it, Miss Smith?

305
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:09,956
- Come on, please?
- Please, come on. Come on.

306
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:12,752
Ladies, please.
What are you talking about?

307
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,361
Come on, Smitty,
nobody can do it like you can.

308
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,122
Come on, please. Please, Smitty.

309
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:19,858
Now, girls, you know the rules.

310
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:22,298
- Come on, kids.
- Let's get rid of this stuff.

311
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,495
- Open the top. Let's get started.
- All right.

312
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:27,766
But if the faculty finds out,
I'll have to leave Victoria.

313
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:29,910
Lucky you.

314
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:23,484
That was super, Miss Smith.

315
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:25,319
- Now let's really get hot.
- Yeah.

316
00:32:25,493 --> 00:32:28,189
Let's go below the border
for some South American jive.

317
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,796
- Yeah.
- Wonderful.

318
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,955
Okay, kiddies.

319
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:34,298
I mean, very well, ladies.

320
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:36,164
But everyone will have to help.

321
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:39,306
Okay, Smitty, we're with you.

322
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,884
Oh, wonderful.

323
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:42,987
Girls, big news. Steve Elliott's here.

324
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,153
Steve Elliott?

325
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,892
You're kidding. The man who wrote
"Boogie Woogie Sugie"?

326
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,263
And "Beat Me Daddy,
With a Boogie Brush"?

327
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:51,496
And "Dig Me Sister,
With a Solid Spade"?

328
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,470
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go.

329
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:10,577
"I have lost my pen in the garden
of my aunt?"

330
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:31,160
Hello.

331
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:42,611
"I have lost my pen in the garden
of my aunt in the Casbah."

332
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,375
I thought you would like to know.

333
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:46,543
What makes you think
I'd be interested?

334
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:49,451
Well, you should be.
She's your aunt too.

335
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,060
Oh, look, Caroline, why don't you let me
come over and talk to you?

336
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:56,719
I'm sorry, Mr. Elliott, you'll have to wait
until the last Sunday in October.

337
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:58,456
If you're still here.

338
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,467
That's when I hold my annual reception
for new students. Good night.

339
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,127
Well, look, l...

340
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,772
Hello?

341
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:07,940
Hello?

342
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:21,180
Relax, Stevey, this isn't French,
it's music.

343
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:25,086
Professor Hendricks won't be here
for 10 minutes. We set his clock back.

344
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:29,195
Oh, good.
His music sets me back about 10 years.

345
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,124
I must have taken a little catnap.

346
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:35,030
Catnap, my eye. You weren't purring,
you were snoring.

347
00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:37,898
Don't men look silly
when they're waking up?

348
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,300
Don't men look silly?

349
00:37:39,473 --> 00:37:41,737
I can imagine what you look like
when you wake up.

350
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:43,536
What do you mean?

351
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:46,771
Do you realize what girls go through
to make themselves beautiful?

352
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:49,610
How they look when they first get up?
Look, I'll show you.

353
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,684
Now, the chair will be the bed. See?

354
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,616
Here's an imaginary dresser
with the mirror and the makeup.

355
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,654
The mirror and the makeup
are important.

356
00:37:56,824 --> 00:37:59,054
I'll take the part of the girl, see?

357
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:03,060
Now, you give me something to wake
me up like they do early in the morning.

358
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:42,017
Cheese it, here comes Piccolo Pete.

359
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:01,997
And now we come to the folk song,
or traditional type of melody.

360
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:07,443
A perfect example of this school
is the old Scotch ballad, "Loch Lomond."

361
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:14,053
You may illustrate, Miss Smith.

362
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,520
And no embellishments, please.

363
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:27,062
By yon bonnie banks
And by yon bonnie braes

364
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:32,934
Where the sun shines bright
On Loch Lomond

365
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:38,067
Oh, we too have passed
So many blithesome days

366
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:44,844
On the bonnie, bonnie banks
Of Loch Lomond

367
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:50,082
Oh, you take the high road
And I'll take the low road

368
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:55,251
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye

369
00:41:55,429 --> 00:42:01,527
But I and my true love
Will never meet again

370
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,773
Are we keeping you awake,
Mr. Elliott?

371
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,203
Barely.

372
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:11,572
I suppose you think you could improve
upon the melody, Mr. Elliott?

373
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:13,337
Oh, he has, many times.

374
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:17,177
Oh, indeed.
I shall give him another opportunity.

375
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:18,409
Thank you, sir.

376
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:20,918
You'll bring a sample
of your improvement tomorrow.

377
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:23,352
At which time,
I shall turn the class over to you.

378
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:24,957
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

379
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,992
That's rather quick notice,
isn't it, professor?

380
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:30,994
Tomorrow, huh?

381
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:33,730
May I bring my own accompanist?

382
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:36,165
Oh, you may bring anyone you like.

383
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:39,033
And now, if you haven't
any objections...

384
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:42,266
...we will proceed with our music,
Mr. Elliott.

385
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:55,147
Here's coffee. I brought you some
doughnuts too. I made them myself.

386
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,519
- I helped her carry them over.
- Oh, swell. Thanks a lot.

387
00:43:10,237 --> 00:43:12,705
- Oh, here they come.
- Here they come.

388
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,031
I'll take the high road

389
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,899
And I'll take the low road

390
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:51,200
You're not a Tetrazzini

391
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:55,971
And, babe, you're no Caruso
But don't you get a tingle

392
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:58,411
Whenever our voices mingle?

393
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,847
You've heard that Sinatra fellow

394
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:04,954
I swoon when he gets mellow

395
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,920
Well, anything he can do I can do

396
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:11,459
Accompanied slightly by you

397
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:15,963
I'll take the high note
And you take the low note

398
00:44:16,134 --> 00:44:21,094
And we'll make sweet music together

399
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:23,001
I'll sing in your key

400
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:25,574
And you'll sing in my key

401
00:44:25,743 --> 00:44:30,271
We won't be off-key together

402
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:32,678
We'd be such a lovely duet

403
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,080
We might even sing at the Met

404
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:37,687
There's no telling how far we'll go

405
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:39,823
- lf I sing high
- And I sing low

406
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:44,690
So I'll take the high note
And you'll take the low note

407
00:44:44,862 --> 00:44:49,424
And we'll make sweet music together

408
00:44:59,377 --> 00:45:01,971
Oh, I'll take the high note
And you take the low note

409
00:45:02,146 --> 00:45:04,273
And I'll be in Dixie afore ye

410
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:06,973
Well, anything you can do
I can do too

411
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:09,551
Accompanied slightly by you

412
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,884
I'll take the high note
And you take the low note

413
00:45:14,058 --> 00:45:18,722
And we'll make sweet music together

414
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:23,563
I'll sing in your key
And you sing in my key

415
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:28,262
We won't be off-key together

416
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:33,138
We'd be such a lovely duet
We might even sing at the Met

417
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,779
There's no telling how far we'll go

418
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:38,313
If you sing high

419
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,746
And you sing low

420
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:43,018
I'll take the high note

421
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:45,712
And you take the low note

422
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,414
- High
- High

423
00:45:47,592 --> 00:45:49,184
- Da-da-da-de-a
- Da-da-da-de-a

424
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,759
- Da-do-dey
- Da-do-dey

425
00:45:50,928 --> 00:45:52,623
High, high, high, la-do-da-de-a

426
00:45:52,797 --> 00:45:55,630
I'll take the high note
And you take the low note

427
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,495
And we'll make

428
00:45:57,668 --> 00:46:03,834
- We'll make sweet music together
- We'll make sweet music together

429
00:46:04,008 --> 00:46:09,537
We'd be such a lovely quartet
We might even sing Rigolet

430
00:46:09,714 --> 00:46:12,182
There's no telling what we could do

431
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,908
If I sing true

432
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:16,713
And I sing blue

433
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:35,567
High, low

434
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:41,110
High, high, high, high, the high note

435
00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:46,911
I'll take the high note
And you'll take the low note

436
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:50,212
And we'll make sweet music together

437
00:46:50,388 --> 00:46:54,222
We four together

438
00:46:54,392 --> 00:46:55,882
We'll take the high note

439
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,254
We'll take the low note

440
00:46:57,428 --> 00:47:00,329
And we'll make sweet music together

441
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:02,497
We'll sing in your key

442
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:03,827
We'll sing in your key

443
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:07,198
We won't be off-key together

444
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:10,204
We'd be such a lovely sextet

445
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:13,002
We'll do Lucia di Lammermoor yet

446
00:47:13,177 --> 00:47:16,044
We'll give out with a hot gavotte

447
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:19,376
- lf Smith plays sweet
- And James plays hot

448
00:47:51,115 --> 00:47:55,711
We'd be the best of all the octettes
We'd dance a ring around the Rockettes

449
00:47:55,886 --> 00:47:58,684
Our Terpsichore is to the pernt

450
00:47:58,856 --> 00:48:01,256
In fact, we've learned to kill the jernt

451
00:48:18,843 --> 00:48:21,107
Two, three, kick

452
00:48:36,127 --> 00:48:38,118
Isn't that redheaded fellow wonderful?

453
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:39,421
That's me.

454
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:41,155
- High
- High

455
00:48:41,332 --> 00:48:42,697
- Da-da-da-de-a
- Da-da-da-de-a

456
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:44,425
- Le-do-dey
- Le-do-dey

457
00:48:44,602 --> 00:48:47,696
High, high, high, high, da, high
I'll take the high note

458
00:48:47,872 --> 00:48:51,330
And you take the low note
And we'll make

459
00:48:51,509 --> 00:48:52,999
We'll make

460
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:59,173
Sweet music together

461
00:49:03,888 --> 00:49:05,788
Splendid. A great improvement.

462
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:07,082
Thank you very much.

463
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:09,283
Well, there you are, professor.

464
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,552
Young man...

465
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:13,663
...due to circumstances
over which I have no control...

466
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:16,823
...I am forced to give you
an A in music.

467
00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:44,761
Gee, you've got the longest eyelashes.

468
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:53,535
You know,
I dream about you every night.

469
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,400
Gosh, your hair's silky.

470
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:01,240
Did you every try it in braids?

471
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,047
Come in.

472
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:17,420
I knew you'd like it in braids.

473
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:19,324
How dare you come here?

474
00:50:19,497 --> 00:50:21,226
Oh, now.

475
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:23,025
Rule 113:

476
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,136
"Students are invited at all times
to bring to the members of the faculty...

477
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:29,966
...problems of a personal nature."

478
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:33,133
Now, I have a problem...

479
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:36,239
...and it's very personal.
- Well, what is it?

480
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:38,608
Well, it's about my bed.

481
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:40,682
What about your bed?

482
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:42,842
Well, it's cold.

483
00:50:43,154 --> 00:50:45,952
Now, don't tell me you forgot
to bring your hot-water bottle.

484
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:49,422
It's the first thing you packed
when we were going on our honeymo...

485
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,961
I'll see that you get another blanket.
Good night, Mr. Elliott.

486
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,121
Oh, I have another problem.

487
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:58,258
- What is it?
- It's about my bed again.

488
00:50:58,903 --> 00:51:00,530
Not only is it too cold, but...

489
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:02,797
Well, it's too short.

490
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:05,441
My foot sticks out. Both of them.

491
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:07,372
Well, have it cut off. Both of them.

492
00:51:08,145 --> 00:51:10,705
Well, I'd much rather
have a bigger bed.

493
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:13,748
One like the one we were going to buy,
you remember?

494
00:51:14,652 --> 00:51:16,779
No. No, I don't remember.

495
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:19,548
You remembered
the hot-water bottle, though.

496
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:22,191
Oh, brother. What a bed that was.

497
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:26,352
Carved out of rosewood
with little cupids all over it.

498
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:29,397
You remember it.
It was in that store window in California.

499
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:32,263
If you miss the bed,
why don't you go back to California...

500
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:35,667
...and sleep in the window.
- I will, if you'll go with me.

501
00:51:36,674 --> 00:51:40,007
Oh, Caroline,
you've got to believe me...

502
00:51:40,411 --> 00:51:42,971
Caroline. Oh, Caroline.

503
00:51:43,747 --> 00:51:45,942
Here comes that Evans
and that elephant again.

504
00:51:46,116 --> 00:51:48,710
Hey, what's that guy
hanging around you for?

505
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:52,583
Why, we're very dear friends.
In fact, we're more than friends, we're...

506
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:54,121
We're practically engaged.

507
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:55,588
Well, congratu...

508
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:57,090
Engaged?

509
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:58,250
You're married to me.

510
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:00,522
I won't be when that annulment
comes through.

511
00:52:00,698 --> 00:52:01,926
Caroline, are you there?

512
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,999
Just a moment, Willis, dear.

513
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:06,898
Willis, dear. You know
you're not in love with that creep.

514
00:52:07,071 --> 00:52:08,766
Don't tell me who I'm in love with.

515
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:10,236
I'm not in love with you.

516
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:11,840
Now, now, you get out of here.

517
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:13,340
Go on.

518
00:52:13,744 --> 00:52:16,110
Go ahead, open the door
for your lover.

519
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,441
I'll go out of your life
through the window...

520
00:52:18,616 --> 00:52:20,106
...into the night.

521
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:22,684
Oh, get lost. Go on.

522
00:52:28,092 --> 00:52:30,526
- Good evening, Willis.
- Good evening, my dear.

523
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:32,753
What...? What kept you so long?

524
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:35,125
Oh, I was just cleaning out my room.

525
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:37,199
Oh, come, come, come, Duke.

526
00:52:37,368 --> 00:52:41,168
I know we're happy to see Miss Brooks
but we must behave like a gentleman.

527
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:42,327
Sit.

528
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:45,737
Sit. That's a good boy.

529
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:51,369
Willis, come sit here next to me.

530
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:58,319
l... I missed you
this summer, my dear.

531
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:00,854
Lake Tillamook wasn't the same
without you.

532
00:53:01,025 --> 00:53:02,652
Well, I missed you too, Willis.

533
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:06,387
I wish I'd gone to Lake Tillamook
instead of California.

534
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:07,928
Really, Caroline.

535
00:53:08,098 --> 00:53:10,658
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

536
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:14,770
Oh, Willis, stop teasing.
You know how I feel about you.

537
00:53:15,673 --> 00:53:17,106
Why, Caroline.

538
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:20,710
Darling, I didn't know.

539
00:53:30,888 --> 00:53:34,415
Duke hasn't been himself ever since
that Elliott person registered here.

540
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,685
- Perhaps I'd better investigate.
- Don't bother, dear.

541
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:40,091
He probably just smells a rat.

542
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:41,390
Don't you mean a mouse?

543
00:53:41,565 --> 00:53:42,964
No, I mean a rat.

544
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:44,122
A large rat.

545
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:48,769
Whatever you say, my dear.

546
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:52,672
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go to the movies.

547
00:53:52,843 --> 00:53:55,004
There's a double feature
in the village tonight.

548
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:56,771
If we hurry, we can still make it.

549
00:53:56,947 --> 00:53:58,244
Oh, very well, my dear.

550
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:01,578
But I do hope
the pictures are educational.

551
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,314
- You get the car, I'll meet you outside.
- All right.

552
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:09,084
Oh, and suppose we leave Duke here
to keep an eye on the rat?

553
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:10,590
An excellent suggestion.

554
00:54:10,761 --> 00:54:13,093
Duke, I don't want you to budge
from this spot...

555
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:15,527
...until Miss Brooks and I
return from the cinema.

556
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:17,462
Do you understand?

557
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:20,298
That's a good boy.

558
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:26,072
Oh, that's the way we say good night.

559
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:36,718
If you are not in your room by 9:00,
I will be forced to have you expelled.

560
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:39,583
Rule 110.

561
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:43,659
At the sound of the gong,
the time will be 8:55.

562
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:44,953
Bong.

563
00:54:45,129 --> 00:54:47,154
Good night.

564
00:54:52,436 --> 00:54:54,529
Lassie, go home.

565
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:18,045
- Oh, I'm in the wrong room.
- You certainly are.

566
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:20,115
- You ought to be in a cell.
- How are you?

567
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:22,343
You're carrying this
girl business too far.

568
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:25,044
Oh, this. I'm dressed like a dame
to escape a Dane.

569
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:27,156
- What?
- Who told you I was here?

570
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:28,951
Harry James.

571
00:57:29,126 --> 00:57:30,252
Now, listen, schoolboy.

572
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:32,395
I'll give you 10 days
to finish my score...

573
00:57:32,563 --> 00:57:34,827
...or I'll raise a scandal,
it'll blast you out.

574
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:37,091
- George...
- And the dean and Caroline with you.

575
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:38,859
- Oh, you wouldn't.
- Oh, wouldn't I?

576
00:57:39,036 --> 00:57:40,765
I'd do anything for my water pageant.

577
00:57:40,938 --> 00:57:44,271
Schubert's the only guy who got away
with an unfinished symphony.

578
00:57:45,576 --> 00:57:46,565
Here.

579
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:48,506
Get busy.

580
00:57:51,715 --> 00:57:53,979
It's no use, George.

581
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:57,242
Ever since the day I lost Caroline...

582
00:57:57,421 --> 00:57:59,855
...why, I haven't been able
to write a line.

583
00:58:00,724 --> 00:58:03,488
I've just been trying
to figure out a way...

584
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,594
...to kind of get her back.

585
00:58:06,964 --> 00:58:10,331
If I could get my hands on that woman,
I'd choke the truth out of her.

586
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,331
Somebody put her up to that.

587
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:15,630
And I'll find out who. And when I do...

588
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,838
Hey, George.

589
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:22,505
How come you showed up so quick
in California?

590
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:25,842
- Where were you while I was...?
- Steve, it's me, your best friend.

591
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:28,041
You don't think
that after all these years...

592
00:58:28,218 --> 00:58:30,448
- My dear fellow...
- No, it couldn't be. I'm sorry.

593
00:58:30,621 --> 00:58:33,385
- You'll have to forgive me. I'm not myself.
- Steve, listen.

594
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:35,115
I'm interested in your happiness.

595
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:39,023
I want you to stay here in this school
until you win back your little bride.

596
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:40,891
I've tried, but it isn't easy.

597
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:43,897
The professors giving demerits,
Caroline giving dirty looks...

598
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:46,467
...everybody gives homework.
- Don't worry about it.

599
00:58:46,637 --> 00:58:48,002
I'll help you.

600
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:51,163
You may not know it
but I was expelled from Oxford.

601
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:52,740
Really?

602
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:54,843
You can help me
with a little homework.

603
00:58:55,012 --> 00:58:57,207
- There's three maps. Wait a minute.
- All right.

604
00:58:57,381 --> 00:58:59,713
Four pages of history...

605
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:03,478
...five pages of geometry...

606
00:59:04,087 --> 00:59:06,555
...six pages of chemistry...

607
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:09,155
...ten pages of botany...

608
00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:12,022
...and a thesis on the love life
of a plover.

609
00:59:12,195 --> 00:59:13,287
- The what?
- I don't know.

610
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:17,160
Look, do that for me and get it back
in the morning. Will you, George?

611
00:59:19,603 --> 00:59:22,299
Steve, it looks as if
I'm working your way through college.

612
00:59:22,472 --> 00:59:24,963
Yeah. Good night, George.

613
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:31,202
Hello?

614
00:59:31,381 --> 00:59:34,248
Yes, I placed a long-distance call
to Xavier Cugat.

615
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:35,407
Put him on.

616
00:59:35,585 --> 00:59:38,179
Hello. Hello, Steve, how are you?

617
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:41,756
Cugie? No, sorry, he's on stage
playing that Venezuela number you like.

618
00:59:41,925 --> 00:59:43,324
Want to listen?

619
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:56,510
Say, Cugie, Steve Elliott's on the phone.

620
01:02:58,488 --> 01:03:00,319
Hello. Hello, Steve.

621
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:02,890
Hello, Cugie?
Say, your number sounded wonderful.

622
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:05,254
Have you heard
from that crazy woman?

623
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:09,387
I grieve to tell you
we have heard nothing but silence...

624
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:12,126
...since the day of that incident.

625
01:03:12,302 --> 01:03:14,930
She has vanished into hot air.

626
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:17,801
I know. I know. I know.
I sympathize with you.

627
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:19,566
I know your loss was great.

628
01:03:19,743 --> 01:03:21,472
I too sustained a great loss.

629
01:03:21,645 --> 01:03:24,478
When the señorita left,
she took my last pair of maracas.

630
01:03:24,648 --> 01:03:27,242
Who cares about maracas?
She took my last pair of nylons.

631
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:28,714
- Maracas.
- Nylons.

632
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:31,317
- Nylons, I said.
- All right, maracas.

633
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:33,217
Fine.

634
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:37,258
Cugie's lost his maracas,
Lina's lost her nylons...

635
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:39,853
...and I've lost my Caroline.

636
01:03:41,364 --> 01:03:42,991
"Geometry, 90.

637
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:45,134
Chemistry, 95.

638
01:03:45,302 --> 01:03:46,997
History, 98."

639
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,501
Oh, well. My... This is awful.

640
01:03:48,672 --> 01:03:52,335
There seems little hope of getting rid
of Mr. Elliott scholastically.

641
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:55,444
How do we stand on demerits?
Professor Evans?

642
01:03:55,612 --> 01:03:58,911
Oh, well, 10 demerits for sleeping
through botany.

643
01:03:59,082 --> 01:04:02,848
- Miss Phillips?
- Ten for defacing his map in geography.

644
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:06,318
- Professor Hendricks?
- Ten demerits for tardiness.

645
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:09,320
Twenty-five demerits for...

646
01:04:09,492 --> 01:04:12,859
- Go on, my dear.
- For insubordination.

647
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:14,394
I see.

648
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:16,156
Anyone else?

649
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:21,828
Well, that's only 55. A long way
from the hundred we need to expel him.

650
01:04:22,005 --> 01:04:24,997
You all realize that each hour
that young man remains here...

651
01:04:25,175 --> 01:04:28,975
...our situation becomes
more precarious.

652
01:04:29,312 --> 01:04:32,406
There must be some way
of stepping up his demerits.

653
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:34,209
Legitimately, of course.

654
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:36,716
Dean Clinton, you forget.

655
01:04:36,886 --> 01:04:39,514
Tomorrow the young man starts with me
in eurhythmics.

656
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:42,920
Oh, yes...

657
01:04:43,093 --> 01:04:45,118
...eurhythmics.

658
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,208
That was very,
very nice girls, very nice.

659
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:35,571
Now, the next thing
we shall do will be...

660
01:05:35,745 --> 01:05:38,646
Well, come in, Mr. Elliott.

661
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:41,283
No, I don't think I'd better.

662
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:42,748
Will you please come in?

663
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:46,980
We have no time to play the
hide-and-the-seek, Mr. Elliott. Come in.

664
01:05:53,063 --> 01:05:56,396
Well, well, well, look who's here.

665
01:05:56,566 --> 01:05:59,000
Mr. Apollo.

666
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:01,461
Stomach in.

667
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:02,662
Chest out.

668
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:03,828
Shoulders back.

669
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:05,497
Head up.

670
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:10,741
Girls, line up, please.

671
01:06:13,183 --> 01:06:18,917
One, and two, and three, and four,
and five, and six, and seven, and...

672
01:06:19,089 --> 01:06:22,024
Oh, no, no, no, no.
What's the matter?

673
01:06:22,192 --> 01:06:24,160
That was an accident.
My leg won't stretch.

674
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:27,353
It's all right this way,
but this is new to me.

675
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:30,431
- It won't stretch, huh?
- No, ma'am.

676
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:32,357
I shall stretch it for you.

677
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:34,264
Put your arm around there.

678
01:06:34,437 --> 01:06:36,962
Straight. Give me your leg.

679
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:39,136
Give me your leg.

680
01:06:40,477 --> 01:06:43,002
Up high, high, high, high...

681
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:45,079
Up. up.

682
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:50,317
Get up there. Get off of there.

683
01:06:50,487 --> 01:06:53,479
Stomach in. Chest out.
Shoulders back. Head up.

684
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:55,283
To the bar.

685
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,291
Put your foot on the rail.

686
01:06:59,629 --> 01:07:01,153
Up here. Up here.

687
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:02,923
You have some pretty tall friends.

688
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:04,293
Get up there.

689
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:07,163
Hurry up. Up. Up.

690
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,366
Get off the floor.

691
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,509
Get off the floor.

692
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:15,974
Stomach in. Chest out.
Shoulders back. Head up.

693
01:07:16,146 --> 01:07:19,775
Girls, line up for the walking exercise.

694
01:07:21,718 --> 01:07:23,276
Is that a way to walk?

695
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:25,284
Walking isn't up there.

696
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:28,515
It's here.

697
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:32,323
Well, I've been using
the wrong end for years.

698
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:35,225
Where is your carriage?

699
01:07:35,632 --> 01:07:38,430
The secret of good carriage is pride.

700
01:07:38,601 --> 01:07:41,195
Each day a woman
must say to herself:

701
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:43,271
"I have a secret.

702
01:07:43,439 --> 01:07:45,100
I am beautiful.

703
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:46,799
I am beloved."

704
01:07:46,976 --> 01:07:50,537
And she must carry herself
as if she believes it.

705
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,570
Watch.

706
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:55,183
I have a secret.

707
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:57,882
I am beautiful.

708
01:07:58,154 --> 01:08:00,122
I am beloved.

709
01:08:01,191 --> 01:08:03,022
Now you do it.

710
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:06,895
- Me?
- Yes, you.

711
01:08:08,398 --> 01:08:09,456
Well, I'd rather not.

712
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:12,601
You will walk
or I will give you demerits.

713
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:13,758
I'm walking.

714
01:08:15,205 --> 01:08:17,002
I have a secret.

715
01:08:17,173 --> 01:08:19,004
I am beautiful.

716
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:22,667
- I am beloved.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Elliott.

717
01:08:22,845 --> 01:08:24,312
We do not waddle like a duck.

718
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,845
That's the only way I know.

719
01:08:26,015 --> 01:08:28,176
Hold your head up. High. High. High.

720
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:31,081
- It's hooked on back there.
- Well, hold it up high...

721
01:08:31,254 --> 01:08:33,779
...and act like a proud horse.

722
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:37,956
Move over, Nell.

723
01:08:39,662 --> 01:08:43,564
That will be 20 demerits
for bad stable manners.

724
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:45,928
Girls, sit down.

725
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,005
How many times
have I told you not to eat candies?

726
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:02,446
You will ruin your shape.

727
01:09:02,619 --> 01:09:03,779
What shape?

728
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:05,784
The next one I catch eating candies...

729
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:08,423
And throw away on the floor
all the sticky paper...

730
01:09:08,591 --> 01:09:11,389
...will get 25 demerits.

731
01:09:13,162 --> 01:09:15,596
Line up, everybody, for the waltz.

732
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:21,102
Come on. Hold up.
Lively, make it lively. That's it.

733
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:23,666
Music.

734
01:12:05,902 --> 01:12:06,891
Well...

735
01:12:07,069 --> 01:12:10,266
...we might as well face it, dear.
Tomorrow is Parents' Day, isn't it?

736
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,536
And in spite of all our efforts,
Mr. Elliott's still here.

737
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:15,869
I know.

738
01:12:16,646 --> 01:12:20,742
Frankly, I'm at a loss to explain
his presence here to the parents.

739
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:22,441
And as dean of Victoria...

740
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:24,586
...l'm responsible.

741
01:12:26,956 --> 01:12:28,514
Perhaps...

742
01:12:29,592 --> 01:12:31,560
...if some very attractive young person...

743
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:34,992
...could arrange an engagement
with Mr. Elliott tonight...

744
01:12:35,498 --> 01:12:39,434
...and manage to keep him out
after hours...

745
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:43,672
We might also arrange to have
Professor Evans at the gate...

746
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,105
...to expel the young man
when he returns.

747
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,411
Perhaps we could.

748
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:28,579
Ladies and gentlemen...

749
01:13:28,751 --> 01:13:31,413
...next,
we present a musical phenomenon.

750
01:13:31,587 --> 01:13:32,849
Some years ago...

751
01:13:33,022 --> 01:13:34,546
...in a little café in Romania...

752
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:37,249
...Jascha Heifetz,
the famous violinist...

753
01:13:37,426 --> 01:13:41,192
...heard a gypsy fiddler play a selection
that made such an impression on his mind...

754
01:13:41,364 --> 01:13:43,798
...that later, he wrote
a brilliant adaptation of it.

755
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,399
Tonight, for the first time...

756
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,128
...we present these violin fireworks...

757
01:13:48,304 --> 01:13:51,296
...as transcribed for the trumpet
by Harry James.

758
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:52,736
Ladies and gentlemen...

759
01:13:52,909 --> 01:13:54,934
..."Hora Staccato."

760
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:15,875
- Darling.
- Yes, dear?

761
01:16:16,052 --> 01:16:17,280
Pinch me, will you?

762
01:16:17,453 --> 01:16:20,513
- What for?
- Never mind. Just pinch me.

763
01:16:21,857 --> 01:16:24,655
Ouch, yeah, it's real.

764
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:26,724
For a minute,
I thought I was dreaming.

765
01:16:26,896 --> 01:16:29,922
I can't believe it's really me,
sitting across from you.

766
01:16:30,099 --> 01:16:31,225
It looks like you.

767
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,732
You know, I nearly gave up
a couple of times...

768
01:16:33,903 --> 01:16:36,463
...but then you'd say
or you'd do some little thing...

769
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:38,698
...that made me feel you still cared.

770
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:39,932
Would I?

771
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:42,407
I knew once you had time to think...

772
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:45,775
...you'd never believe the stuff
that crazy woman said in California.

773
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:48,678
Please, Steve,
I'd rather not talk about it.

774
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:50,910
You know, Caroline...

775
01:16:51,087 --> 01:16:53,715
...when you love someone,
you trust them.

776
01:16:53,889 --> 01:16:57,552
No one could ever make me
believe anything bad about you.

777
01:16:59,361 --> 01:17:02,489
I want to see Mr. George Adams.
It is very important that I see him.

778
01:17:04,734 --> 01:17:06,531
I'll take care of this. How do you do?

779
01:17:06,702 --> 01:17:08,465
- Glad to see you.
- What about the part?

780
01:17:08,637 --> 01:17:10,195
Why haven't you sent for me?

781
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:12,636
I will see you in just one minute.
Thank you.

782
01:17:12,808 --> 01:17:13,797
Hey!

783
01:17:13,976 --> 01:17:16,467
Let me out of here. Open that door.

784
01:17:16,746 --> 01:17:19,306
Well, I have our little house
all planned.

785
01:17:19,482 --> 01:17:21,882
Now, over here will be the living room.

786
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:24,076
And here's the fireplace.

787
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:27,050
We could sit in front of it
during the long winter nights...

788
01:17:27,223 --> 01:17:30,715
...and be kind of like this. That's you...

789
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:32,622
...and, well, this is me.

790
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:34,996
You're more like...

791
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:42,102
You know, I used to lie awake
nights in the janitor's room...

792
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,603
...sort of dreaming about this.

793
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:47,532
Now, over here is the dining room...

794
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:51,578
...with a big bay window and a cupboard
for my grandmother's Spode china.

795
01:17:51,747 --> 01:17:54,147
I'm pretty sure she'll give it to us.

796
01:17:55,985 --> 01:17:58,385
You know,
my grandmother's gonna love you.

797
01:18:00,256 --> 01:18:03,316
- Do you think so, darling?
- I know so.

798
01:18:04,727 --> 01:18:08,356
Now, over here is the hall
with a big winding staircase.

799
01:18:08,531 --> 01:18:11,523
You know how kids like to
slide down banisters.

800
01:18:13,669 --> 01:18:16,331
You are planning on children,
aren't you?

801
01:18:18,841 --> 01:18:19,865
Yes, darling.

802
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:21,737
Then what are we waiting for?

803
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:24,471
Let's go to Victoria College,
throw things in the bag...

804
01:18:24,647 --> 01:18:26,842
...and let's get out of here.

805
01:18:28,484 --> 01:18:31,214
Well, you want to, don't you?

806
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:34,879
Well, yes, dear, of course I do.
But, well...

807
01:18:35,057 --> 01:18:37,321
Well, they're playing
one of my favorite songs.

808
01:18:37,493 --> 01:18:39,427
Let's dance awhile first, huh?

809
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:40,755
Oh, sure.

810
01:19:36,218 --> 01:19:40,951
And now we give you
your favorite singing star, Helen Forrest.

811
01:19:42,358 --> 01:19:49,355
I cried for you

812
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:59,164
Now it's your turn to cry over me

813
01:20:03,913 --> 01:20:08,373
Every road

814
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:14,386
Has a turning

815
01:20:14,556 --> 01:20:18,890
That's one thing

816
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:24,863
You're learning

817
01:20:25,034 --> 01:20:32,031
I cried for you

818
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:37,104
What a fool

819
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:44,014
I used to be

820
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:50,083
'Cause I've found two eyes

821
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:54,662
Just a little bit bluer

822
01:20:56,665 --> 01:21:00,658
And I've found a heart

823
01:21:00,836 --> 01:21:05,899
Just a little bit truer

824
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:13,772
I cried for you

825
01:21:15,985 --> 01:21:19,921
Now it's your turn

826
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:27,086
To cry over me

827
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,666
Hey, buddy, do you know
how I can get to Victoria College?

828
01:22:07,836 --> 01:22:11,169
- Straight down the road about 20 miles.
- Thanks.

829
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:14,335
The figure is familiar...

830
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:17,502
...but I cannot place the voice.

831
01:22:22,885 --> 01:22:25,683
Well, Duke, tonight we have occasion
for rejoicing.

832
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:30,917
Before the cock crows, Mr. Steven Elliott
will be out of our lives forever.

833
01:22:34,563 --> 01:22:36,554
- Dear?
- Yes, darling?

834
01:22:36,732 --> 01:22:41,328
There never really was anything between
you and that awful woman, was there?

835
01:22:41,503 --> 01:22:43,869
Of course not.

836
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:46,439
I knew deep down in my heart
there couldn't be.

837
01:22:46,608 --> 01:22:50,100
If she were really your wife,
she would have had a marriage license.

838
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:54,045
Of course, there were
those three little red-haired boys.

839
01:22:54,216 --> 01:22:57,151
There are millions
of redheaded boys all over the world.

840
01:22:57,319 --> 01:22:59,913
I couldn't be the father of all of them.

841
01:23:00,089 --> 01:23:02,057
No, of course not, darling.

842
01:23:02,224 --> 01:23:03,851
Forgive me?

843
01:23:04,927 --> 01:23:07,157
- Are you happy?
- Happy? I'm delirious.

844
01:23:07,329 --> 01:23:08,660
Why shouldn't I be?

845
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:12,665
Gosh, I've got my wife back,
I'm on the first lap of our honeymoon.

846
01:23:12,835 --> 01:23:15,303
- A man couldn't ask for any more.
- No, only...

847
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:18,440
It took a long time to walk
from that church to the bridal suite.

848
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:22,134
- But we finally made it, didn't we?
- Well, not quite, dear.

849
01:23:22,311 --> 01:23:24,779
What do you mean?
We're on our way to pack, aren't we?

850
01:23:24,947 --> 01:23:28,348
Well, yes, of course.
But I'm afraid when we get to the gate...

851
01:23:28,517 --> 01:23:31,179
...Willis might not let you in.

852
01:23:31,353 --> 01:23:33,014
Willis might not, why?

853
01:23:33,188 --> 01:23:35,588
Well, you're out after hours...

854
01:23:35,757 --> 01:23:39,488
...and he's waiting to expel you.

855
01:23:40,362 --> 01:23:44,526
I'm gonna knock that petunia-presser
right on his trapeoliums.

856
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:47,330
Hey, wait a minute.

857
01:23:47,503 --> 01:23:49,266
How did he know you were with me?

858
01:23:49,438 --> 01:23:50,905
Oh, l... I don't know, dear.

859
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:54,941
Unless it's because I told him.
You'd better turn here, dear.

860
01:23:57,746 --> 01:23:59,737
- You told him.
- Oh, look, darling.

861
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:03,783
I simply had to get you out of school
before the parents come tomorrow.

862
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:06,716
And well, it seemed
the only way to do it.

863
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:11,523
Honey, I didn't know I was gonna
fall in love with you all over again...

864
01:24:12,494 --> 01:24:15,122
...and that I'd wanna leave Victoria
with you.

865
01:24:15,631 --> 01:24:17,963
Oh, that's different. Come on, let's go.

866
01:24:18,133 --> 01:24:20,897
Oh, no. I can't leave
on such short notice.

867
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:24,937
- It's not fair to Dean Clinton.
- No, we've got to be fair to Dean Clinton.

868
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:28,702
- Oh, you're not mad, are you?
- Oh, no, I'm as happy as a lark.

869
01:24:28,877 --> 01:24:32,313
You're just going in, I'm staying out.
Nothing to get mad about.

870
01:24:32,481 --> 01:24:34,915
Oh, but, sweetheart.
You know you can't come in.

871
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:39,042
- Tomorrow's Parents' Day, and...
- Tonight is definitely not Husband's Night.

872
01:24:41,757 --> 01:24:45,488
Besides, you can't
get through the gate.

873
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:51,064
Of course,
you could climb over the wall.

874
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:55,500
Yeah, the wall.

875
01:24:56,038 --> 01:24:57,801
Just to pack your bags, of course.

876
01:24:57,973 --> 01:25:00,464
Oh, of course. Yeah.

877
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,440
Will you come down to the room
and help me pack?

878
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:04,977
Of course.

879
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:09,712
I'll climb over that wall.
I'll jump over it.

880
01:25:09,918 --> 01:25:12,546
I'll drive through...

881
01:25:12,721 --> 01:25:16,179
...and tell Willis you've left.

882
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:44,382
He's there. Turn off the lights
the minute we burst into the room.

883
01:25:44,553 --> 01:25:46,612
- Right.
- One, two, three...

884
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:48,016
Go.

885
01:25:50,459 --> 01:25:52,051
Here. Put me down. Put me down.

886
01:25:52,227 --> 01:25:55,355
- Okay, Bunny, we've got him.
- Steven Elliott, your hour has come.

887
01:25:55,530 --> 01:26:00,331
You've been chosen to join the order of
the wise and worthy witches of Alpha Nu.

888
01:26:01,536 --> 01:26:04,664
- Okay, kids! Give him the business.
- Now, wait a minute. What...?

889
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,900
Why don't you girls pick on
somebody your size?

890
01:26:08,076 --> 01:26:09,100
Gosh, who's that?

891
01:26:09,278 --> 01:26:10,870
I think it's one of your teachers.

892
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:15,073
- Jeepers. How'll we get out of here?
- You're witches, figure it out for yourself.

893
01:26:15,517 --> 01:26:16,677
Here, what are you doing?

894
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:25,221
Hey, now, what are you...?

895
01:26:29,131 --> 01:26:31,622
- Hello, Señor Elliott. l...
- Oh, no, not you.

896
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,735
I have to explain to you why I'm here.
It's just that I'm...

897
01:26:34,936 --> 01:26:37,097
Steve, open the door, it's Caroline.

898
01:26:37,272 --> 01:26:39,536
I only want to help.

899
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:41,437
Hurry, darling.

900
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:43,202
Sorry, pal, this is taken.

901
01:26:43,378 --> 01:26:45,278
- Oh, goodness.
- Let me down. Let me down.

902
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:47,381
Let me dow...

903
01:26:53,522 --> 01:26:56,355
Darling, hurry.

904
01:26:57,492 --> 01:26:59,756
- Yes, dear?
- Don't just stand there. Come on.

905
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:01,623
Carry me over the threshold.

906
01:27:01,797 --> 01:27:05,255
Oh, yeah, the threshold. Well...

907
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:08,634
Maybe you should come back later.
A week from Wednesday?

908
01:27:08,804 --> 01:27:10,863
Come on, alley-oop.

909
01:27:22,317 --> 01:27:23,944
There we are.

910
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,950
Are you cold, dear?

911
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:28,350
Yes, I am.

912
01:27:28,523 --> 01:27:29,888
- I'll get you a robe.
- Thanks.

913
01:27:30,058 --> 01:27:32,549
Oh, no, no, it isn't in there.

914
01:27:32,728 --> 01:27:34,355
Oh, oh, is it over here?

915
01:27:34,529 --> 01:27:36,690
No, no, it isn't in here either.

916
01:27:36,865 --> 01:27:40,426
- Well, where?
- Well, I never wear the things.

917
01:27:40,869 --> 01:27:42,200
Well, I'll get your slippers.

918
01:27:42,371 --> 01:27:44,168
No, No. I never wear them, either.

919
01:27:44,339 --> 01:27:45,863
What's that noise?

920
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:47,770
Suppressed steam.

921
01:27:47,943 --> 01:27:49,877
Sometimes it goes on like that
all night.

922
01:27:50,045 --> 01:27:51,535
- Really?
- Yes.

923
01:27:51,713 --> 01:27:53,510
Maybe we'd better go
to your house, huh?

924
01:27:53,682 --> 01:27:55,912
No, dear. If you can stand it, I can.

925
01:27:56,084 --> 01:27:57,779
- Oh, I can't.
- Come on, sit down.

926
01:27:57,953 --> 01:27:59,352
Relax.

927
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:03,355
Now, here we are all alone.

928
01:28:03,525 --> 01:28:04,514
Yeah, all alone.

929
01:28:04,693 --> 01:28:06,524
Just you and I.

930
01:28:06,695 --> 01:28:08,595
Yeah, you and I.

931
01:28:08,864 --> 01:28:11,025
How about a game of pinochle?

932
01:28:11,933 --> 01:28:13,400
Chess?

933
01:28:13,635 --> 01:28:15,159
Checkers?

934
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:17,532
Cribbage?

935
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:23,236
Jacks?

936
01:28:23,412 --> 01:28:25,039
Steve, what's the matter with you?

937
01:28:25,213 --> 01:28:27,340
Me? There's nothing the matter
with me. l...

938
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:31,743
Steve, I come to warn you.

939
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,151
- Who do you suppose is here?
- Who do you suppose is here?

940
01:28:35,323 --> 01:28:36,847
Not fair, I asked you first.

941
01:28:37,025 --> 01:28:39,220
Hello, Carlos. How are you?

942
01:28:39,394 --> 01:28:41,328
With the exception of a slight cold,
good.

943
01:28:41,496 --> 01:28:43,896
Slight cold.
Come in out of the night air, goodness.

944
01:28:44,065 --> 01:28:46,829
- I'm not intruding?
- No. We're glad to see you. Aren't we?

945
01:28:47,002 --> 01:28:50,028
My, yes. We can have a nice little game
of three-handed bridge.

946
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:52,605
- Good. I'll get the cards.
- I do not play the cards.

947
01:28:52,774 --> 01:28:55,436
- I only play the guitar.
- Let's have a game of guitar.

948
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:58,977
Look, Carlos, why don't you find
yourself an audition somewhere else.

949
01:28:59,147 --> 01:29:01,980
If you've got a bad cold,
you'd better take care of it, boy.

950
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:05,278
Go home and soak
your head. Good night.

951
01:29:12,027 --> 01:29:14,587
Don't mind me. I'm broad-minded.
My parents aren't.

952
01:29:14,763 --> 01:29:16,788
- They're on their way over.
- Your parents?

953
01:29:16,965 --> 01:29:19,661
Yes, they got here ahead of time.
We've got to hide, quick.

954
01:29:19,835 --> 01:29:21,962
Hide? What for?
There's nothing wrong here.

955
01:29:22,137 --> 01:29:25,538
Yeah, that's what you think.
I think I hear them coming. Quick, hide.

956
01:29:25,707 --> 01:29:28,904
We mustn't get the dean in trouble.
Let's hide somewhere. The closet.

957
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:31,875
Okay, No, no, no. not there.
Over here. It's cooler.

958
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,748
- There's something I must tell you.
- Hide.

959
01:29:36,918 --> 01:29:38,146
What are you talking about?

960
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,514
- Get in there.
- Let me out.

961
01:29:39,688 --> 01:29:43,454
But I assure you, Mrs. Allenwood,
the young man has already left Victoria.

962
01:29:43,625 --> 01:29:46,287
Nevertheless,
I prefer to see it with my own eyes.

963
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:02,303
You see, everything is in order.

964
01:30:02,477 --> 01:30:03,705
It seems to be, yes.

965
01:30:03,879 --> 01:30:05,676
You are mistaken about Steve Elliott.

966
01:30:05,847 --> 01:30:08,645
- He's a fine, upstanding young man.
- You.

967
01:30:08,817 --> 01:30:11,980
Evidently, our fears are groundless.

968
01:30:19,995 --> 01:30:21,587
Stuffy.

969
01:30:21,763 --> 01:30:23,094
Who, my parents?

970
01:30:23,265 --> 01:30:24,732
- It seems to be.
- Listen.

971
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,391
We must go back, Alonzo.
I've lost my lorgnette.

972
01:30:27,569 --> 01:30:29,560
Here we go again.

973
01:30:30,138 --> 01:30:32,368
Oh, no, no, no.

974
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:40,471
- Do you think you dropped it in here?
- I dropped it about here. Oh, there it is.

975
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:42,742
- Well, you're very fortunate.
- Thank you.

976
01:30:42,918 --> 01:30:44,408
Very.

977
01:30:47,856 --> 01:30:50,086
- Please, I can explain.
- You cellar Casanova.

978
01:30:50,258 --> 01:30:52,123
I can explain, really I can...

979
01:30:54,896 --> 01:30:56,693
Miss Brooks, will you please let me...?

980
01:30:56,865 --> 01:30:58,560
- Oh, my.
- No, put me down.

981
01:30:58,733 --> 01:31:00,462
- Excuse me.
- I know the whole story...

982
01:31:00,635 --> 01:31:02,626
...I just can't live with it.

983
01:31:02,804 --> 01:31:04,533
Let me go.

984
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,807
George, I've ruined everything.

985
01:31:13,982 --> 01:31:16,542
I've embarrassed the dean,
disgraced Victoria College...

986
01:31:16,718 --> 01:31:18,515
...and caused Caroline to lose her job.

987
01:31:18,687 --> 01:31:21,451
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- I am.

988
01:31:21,623 --> 01:31:23,818
I came in to say goodbye.

989
01:31:23,992 --> 01:31:25,323
Goodbye?

990
01:31:25,493 --> 01:31:27,085
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

991
01:31:27,262 --> 01:31:29,958
I'd jump in the river
but the water reminds me of Caroline.

992
01:31:30,131 --> 01:31:32,463
But what about my songs?

993
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:34,528
George, I'll make you a proposition.

994
01:31:34,703 --> 01:31:36,671
Star Caroline in your water pageant...

995
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:38,931
...l'll see you get the songs
for the opening.

996
01:31:39,107 --> 01:31:41,337
Star Caroline?
But she's unknown, Steve.

997
01:31:41,509 --> 01:31:44,239
Well, that's my proposition.
You can take it or leave it.

998
01:31:44,412 --> 01:31:47,779
- Take it? I got to take it.
- Oh, swell, George.

999
01:31:48,183 --> 01:31:50,048
Wait a minute, Steve.

1000
01:31:51,252 --> 01:31:52,844
How does she look
in a bathing suit?

1001
01:31:53,021 --> 01:31:55,615
How does she look in a bathing suit?

1002
01:31:55,991 --> 01:31:57,788
Is he kidding?

1003
01:32:02,631 --> 01:32:06,158
Hide behind that piece of scenery.
You can see Caroline, she can't see you.

1004
01:32:06,334 --> 01:32:09,303
Oh, I know that,
but you don't have to rub it in.

1005
01:32:12,273 --> 01:32:14,798
Come on, Steve, hurry up. Hurry up.

1006
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:18,743
Oh, Steve, darling, forgive me.
She told me everything.

1007
01:32:18,913 --> 01:32:20,278
- Who?
- Me.

1008
01:32:20,448 --> 01:32:21,608
I don't...

1009
01:32:22,183 --> 01:32:23,707
Please excuse me just a moment.

1010
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,654
Excuse me one moment.

1011
01:40:31,172 --> 01:40:34,369
What am I doing? I can't swim. Help.
