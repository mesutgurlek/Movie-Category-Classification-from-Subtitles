1
00:01:45,484 --> 00:01:47,384
This way to the sanitarium.

2
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:49,884
Free bus to the sanitarium.

3
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:53,991
This way to the Standish Sanitarium.
Standish San... Standish San...

4
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,650
This... This way to the Standish...

5
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:59,456
Stand... Free bus. Free bus.
Standish Sanitarium.

6
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,168
Free bus to the sanitarium.
Just got room for a few more.

7
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,071
- Sanitarium?
- No, racetrack.

8
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:12,005
You don't wanna go there.
You're sick.

9
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,935
I'm going to the races!

10
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:17,374
All right. You want something hot
in the fifth race?

11
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:22,012
Sanitarium? Bus to the sanitarium.
Standish Sanitarium.

12
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:26,184
Free bus to the sanitarium.

13
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,849
It's no use, Tony.

14
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:32,861
If business keeps up like this,
I'm afraid I'll have to drive the car myself.

15
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:35,591
Oh, no, Miss Judy. You can't fire me.

16
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:38,793
- But what if I can't pay your salary?
- That's different.

17
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,530
You don't have to pay me,
but you can't fire me.

18
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:44,574
- Tony, you're sweet.
- Yeah. And don't worry, Miss Judy...

19
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:48,235
...I'm gonna get us some customers
if I have to make them sick myself.

20
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:50,847
Tony, I'm afraid we need
more than customers.

21
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:53,985
You don't understand.
I owe a great deal of money.

22
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:56,643
Far more than I can ever pay.

23
00:02:56,822 --> 00:03:00,349
Let me see.
Who do I know that's rich?

24
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:03,824
How about that big, strong,
sick woman at the sanitarium?

25
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:05,758
- You mean Mrs. Upjohn?
- That's the one.

26
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,262
She'd lend you the money.

27
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:10,868
Oh, she's rich. Why, last week,
she gave me a dollar tip.

28
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:12,867
She did once offer to help.

29
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:15,370
But it doesn't seem right
to borrow from a patient.

30
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,838
- Then we make her a partner.
- Oh, Tony.

31
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:20,443
We gotta hurry
before she changes her mind.

32
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:30,646
Go ahead, Miss Judy.
There's Mrs. Upjohn now.

33
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:33,757
- But, Mrs. Upjohn...
- There's no use, doctor. I'm leaving!

34
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,890
Mr. Whitmore, I want my bill at once.

35
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:39,553
- Just as you say.
- What's the matter, Mrs. Upjohn?

36
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:42,131
It's no fault of yours, my dear.
It's the doctor.

37
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,133
Telling me I'm perfectly well
when I know I'm on the verge...

38
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:48,170
...of a nervous collapse.
Goodbye, Judy, dear.

39
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,734
Have the boy come up
and get my bags, please.

40
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:06,250
Gil! Oh, Gil!

41
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,860
- I'm glad you're here.
- What is it, honey?

42
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:13,691
Hold me tight. I'll be all right.

43
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,026
Come on, honey, tell me.

44
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,431
It's Mrs. Upjohn.

45
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:20,127
She's leaving.

46
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:23,763
Oh, let her leave. Say, I have something
here worth 100 Upjohns.

47
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:26,638
You don't understand.
I'm going to lose this place.

48
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:31,408
No, you're not. That's what I'm trying
to tell you. From me to you, with love.

49
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,780
Your radio contract. You've got it!

50
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:40,258
"Gelding, out of Honey Lamb
by Blue Bolt...

51
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:44,020
...two-year, Hi Hat."

52
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:48,861
- Why, Gil, this doesn't make sense.
- It's a horse, honey, a racehorse.

53
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:51,832
Perhaps I'm awfully stupid,
but what do we want with a horse?

54
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:54,403
I'll tell you. Horse wins race,
owner wins money.

55
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:58,065
Owner gives money to girl he loves.
Girl saves sanitarium. It's very simple.

56
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:01,269
Very simple?
But what happens if horse loses race?

57
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:05,849
Oh, but he can't lose. He's a wonder.
I picked him up for a song, only $ 1500.

58
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:07,780
Fifteen hundred dollars?

59
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:11,255
That's all the money
you had in the world.

60
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:13,857
Well, I still have my job
singing at the casino.

61
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:17,358
Now, Gil. You return that horse at once
and get your money back.

62
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,429
You've got to go on
with your music.

63
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:22,624
You need money fast, more than
I could make 10 years of singing.

64
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:27,295
I don't care. I want you to be
a great singer, not a racetrack tout.

65
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:29,872
Oh, wait a minute.
That isn't fair!

66
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,010
- Are you going to return that horse?
- I can't. I just bought him.

67
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:36,670
You mean you don't want to. You'd rather
bet on a horse than on yourself.

68
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:40,284
- Of all the ungrateful people!
- What have I got to be grateful for?

69
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:44,013
You've thrown your career away on a long
shot and gambled away our happiness.

70
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:48,353
Here. Take your horse.
And I hope you're very happy with it.

71
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:54,329
I'm going to someone who understands me,
to Dr. Hackenbush.

72
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:57,400
Dr. Hackenbush? Why, I never heard
of him. Has he a sanitarium?

73
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:01,300
The biggest in Florida, that's what he said.
Of course, I was never there.

74
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:05,967
Hugo, I mean, Dr. Hackenbush,
always insisted on treating me in my home.

75
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:09,341
I didn't know there was a thing
the matter with me until I met him.

76
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,585
Excuse, please.

77
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,354
We're getting a lot of customers since
they heard Dr. "Hackenapuss" is coming.

78
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,258
- Did you say Hackenbush?
- Yes, ma'am.

79
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:29,264
I wonder if that could be
the same one.

80
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:31,026
Where does he come from?

81
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:34,194
- Where's your Hackenapuss come from?
- Palmville, Florida.

82
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:35,999
That's the one!

83
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,501
Why... Why, Judy!

84
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:42,545
Why didn't you tell me
Dr. Hackenbush was coming here?

85
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:44,477
Dr. Hackenbush?

86
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:46,879
Oh, I'm so excited!

87
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:49,111
Judy, why don't you make him
chief of staff.

88
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,585
He'd do wonders for the sanitarium.

89
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:56,216
With Dr. Hackenbush in charge,
I might help you financially.

90
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:58,726
I don't say I will, but I might.

91
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:03,391
Oh, Mr. Whitmore, have my bags
sent right up. I'm staying!

92
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:10,498
- Who's Dr. Hackenbush?
- I don't know.

93
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:14,543
But if she wants a Hackenapuss,
she's going to get a Hackenapuss.

94
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:28,085
Inhale.

95
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,250
Exhale.

96
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:32,089
Inhale.

97
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:34,561
Exhale.

98
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,564
Inhale.

99
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:38,726
Exhale.

100
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:40,803
Inhale.

101
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,304
- Here's a telegram for you, doc.
- What does it say?

102
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, goes on to say...
How should I know?

103
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:48,236
"Come up and take care
of Mrs. Upjohn. Stop.

104
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:51,814
You can write your own ticket. Stop.
Come at once, Standish Sanitarium."

105
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,850
Mrs. Upjohn. Ah, Emily.

106
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,580
She never forgot that hayride.

107
00:07:57,956 --> 00:07:59,287
Don't she know you're a vet?

108
00:07:59,457 --> 00:08:03,484
She's so in love with me, she doesn't know
anything. That's why she's in love with me.

109
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:06,425
They could throw a horse doctor in jail
for treating people.

110
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:09,624
They can throw a horse doctor in jail
for not paying his rent too.

111
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:12,201
- Up in there.
- What have I got to lo...?

112
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:40,096
Take one of those every half-mile.
And call me if there's any change.

113
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:47,363
Mr. Morgan, if I sign this, it means I turn
the sanitarium over to you today.

114
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:49,734
That's right,
and I'll give you $5000.

115
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:52,240
But the notes aren't due.
I've got almost a month.

116
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,073
This place has been losing money steadily.
You'll never be able to pay.

117
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:59,148
If you wait, I'll take it over,
and you won't get a cent.

118
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:03,947
As your business manager, Judy, I strongly
advise you to take Mr. Morgan's offer.

119
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:06,613
You're forgetting that doctor
Mrs. Upjohn recommended.

120
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,521
Surely with him in charge,
we'll be able to pay Mr. Morgan.

121
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:12,458
Are you going to take the advice
of a hysterical patient?

122
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,894
- Now, look here, Miss Standish...
- Judy!

123
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:17,694
- Judy, he's here! He's here!
- Why, who's here?

124
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:20,669
Dr. Hackenbush!

125
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,898
Are you going to sign that or not?

126
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:25,167
- No.
- Of course she's not going to sign it.

127
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:28,403
I have a month. I can at least
try this new doctor.

128
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,844
You're going to wish
you'd taken that check.

129
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,505
Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan!

130
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:36,881
- You fixed that, all right.
- How'd I know she was going to butt in?

131
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:40,456
- I'll get to work on this new doctor.
- Work fast.

132
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,356
With Dr. Hackenbush in charge,
I'm sure my trustees will let me help you.

133
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,090
- I think I'm better able to advise...
- I don't want to hear any more about it.

134
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:51,633
I can't stand this excitement.
I know this will cause a relapse.

135
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,673
Oh, my metabolism! Doctor!
Oh, doctor!

136
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:00,277
Here, boy. Here, boy.

137
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:03,209
Take these bags to my room,
and here's a dime for yourself.

138
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:07,147
Oh, no, no, no, no. This is Mr. Whitmore,
our business manager.

139
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:10,310
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Here's a quarter.

140
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:12,456
You mustn't take the doctor
too seriously.

141
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:14,785
He probably feels tired
after his long trip.

142
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,951
Why shouldn't I be tired?
Did you ever ride four on a motorcycle?

143
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:19,926
And me, top man.

144
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:23,795
This is Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush,
your new chief of staff.

145
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:27,899
And now, doctor,
I'd like you to meet Miss Standish.

146
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:30,063
Oh, doctor.

147
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:31,765
Doctor.

148
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:33,968
Just a moment,
while I calm these paralytics.

149
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:36,511
Oh, dear. Doctor.

150
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:39,707
Doctor, this is Miss Standish,
owner of the sanitarium.

151
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:43,578
- How do you do, Miss Standish?
- How do you do?

152
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:46,952
You're the prettiest owner
of a sanitarium I've ever seen.

153
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,650
- Thank you.
- You have a charming place here.

154
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:54,229
I knew your mother very well.

155
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,291
I'll let you in on a little secret.

156
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,129
Many, many years ago,
in the dear, dim past...

157
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:01,602
...I proposed to your mother.

158
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,808
- But that's my father.
- No wonder he turned me down.

159
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:09,369
Now, doctor, I'd like you
to meet your new associates.

160
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,777
Johnson, Bellevue Hospital, 1918.

161
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,611
Franco, Johns Hopkins, '22.

162
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:18,051
- Wilmerding, Mayo brothers, '24.
- Dodge brothers, late '29.

163
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:20,555
Doctor, I'm happy to welcome
you as chief of staff.

164
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,956
I hope you'll be able to pull
the sanitarium out of its difficulties.

165
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:26,995
The sanitarium's having
a little financial trouble.

166
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:30,032
I get it. I'm not gonna get paid.
So long! Take it away!

167
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:32,635
Oh, no, no, no.
Doctor, please don't go.

168
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:35,466
- I'll take care of your salary.
- Oh, yeah?

169
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,938
The last job I had,
I had to take it out in trade.

170
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:40,270
And this is no butcher shop.

171
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:42,413
Not yet anyhow.

172
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:46,149
Judy, it seems to me,
if I may say so...

173
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:48,182
...we are making rather
a hasty decision.

174
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:51,254
Surely you don't question
the doctor's ability.

175
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:53,686
No. Not exactly.

176
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:57,157
But running a sanitarium calls
for a man with peculiar talents.

177
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:01,059
I've got the most peculiar talents
of any doctor you ever met.

178
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:04,133
I'm satisfied with Mrs. Upjohn's
recommendations.

179
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:07,703
If you'll excuse me, I'll go
and bring in the rest of the staff.

180
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:11,535
Why don't you go out and bring in
something. Preferably your resignation.

181
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:14,411
Tell me, Dr. Hackenbush...

182
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,844
...just what was your medical
background?

183
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:19,950
- Medically?
- Yes.

184
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:24,782
Well, at the age of 15, I got a job
in a drugstore filling prescriptions.

185
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:27,356
Don't you have to be 21
to fill prescriptions?

186
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:30,983
Well, that's for grownups.
I just filled them for children.

187
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:33,321
No, no, doctor.

188
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:36,899
I mean, where did you get your training
as a physician?

189
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:40,629
Oh, well, to begin with,
I took four years at Vassar.

190
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:45,504
- Vassar? But that's a girls' college.
- I found that out the third year.

191
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:48,612
I'd have been there yet, but I went out
for the swimming team.

192
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:53,876
The doctor seems reluctant
to discuss his medical experiences.

193
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:57,112
Well, medically, my experiences
have been most unexciting.

194
00:12:57,288 --> 00:13:00,052
- Except during the flu epidemic.
- And what happened?

195
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:01,851
I got the flu.

196
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:07,225
- Oh, doctor, I think it's time for my pill.
- Lx-nay on the ill-pay.

197
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:10,492
Now, you told me
to take them regularly.

198
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,101
Just a minute, Mrs. Upjohn.

199
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:23,111
- That looks like a horse pill to me.
- Oh, you've taken them before?

200
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:26,739
- Are you sure you haven't made a mistake?
- You have nothing to worry about.

201
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:30,513
The last patient I gave one of those to
won the Kentucky Derby.

202
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,178
May I examine this, please?

203
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:35,415
Do you actually give those
to your patients?

204
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:37,584
Isn't that awfully large for a pill?

205
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:41,095
It was too small for a basketball,
and I didn't know what to do with it.

206
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:44,200
Say, you're awfully large
for a pill yourself.

207
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:47,000
Dr. Wilmerding...

208
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:50,465
...just what is your opinion?

209
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:53,132
It must take a lot of water
to swallow that.

210
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:55,871
Nonsense. You can swallow that
with 5 gallons.

211
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:58,208
Isn't that a lot of water
for a patient to take?

212
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,408
Not if the patient
has a bridge in her mouth.

213
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:04,487
The water flows under, the patient walks
over and meets the pill on the other side.

214
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:09,885
So it's war!
I'm off to the battlefield!

215
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,585
No, that's from the racetrack.

216
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:15,790
- Racetrack? Well, what am I doing here?
- Oh, doctor, don't leave me!

217
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,139
Well, you won it, Stuffy.

218
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:33,780
Nice work, Stuffy.

219
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,784
I told you to lose that race.

220
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:57,997
Stuffy, where are you? Where's Stuffy?
Did you see my jockey?

221
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:00,076
Whoa. Please, Mr. Morgan,
Don't stay here.

222
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:02,576
You ought to beat the head
off that ornery devil!

223
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:05,215
Well, he only acts this way
when he sees or hears you.

224
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,549
I should have plugged that nag
when I owned him.

225
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,685
Please, Mr. Morgan,
don't stay here.

226
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:19,127
Calm down. He's gone now.
That's a boy.

227
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:23,228
You better stay out of Morgan's way
for a while.

228
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:28,771
Get your ice cream.
Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

229
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,005
Stuffy!

230
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,740
Hey, get out of there.

231
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,937
Hey, that was some ride
you put up.

232
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:39,309
I had 5 bucks right
on the nose.

233
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:42,146
I won 60 cents. Yeah.

234
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,049
Who you riding tomorrow?

235
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:46,486
What's the matter? What happened?

236
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:50,855
You're fired?
Oh, Morgan fired you, huh?

237
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:54,259
- He wanted you to throw the race?
- He wanted Stuffy to be crooked, eh?

238
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:56,195
You know he's honest.

239
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:59,435
He's honest, but you gotta
watch him a little.

240
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:02,300
Gil, why don't you give Stuffy a job.
Let him ride Hi Hat.

241
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:05,704
We can't afford a jockey. We haven't
enough money to eat on ourselves.

242
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:09,836
Eat, eat, eat. All the time eat.
We don't have to eat. I'll eat.

243
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:12,278
- Hey, you.
- Hello, sheriff.

244
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,850
- Have you got the money for the feed bill?
- You see...

245
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:16,987
You guys have been stalling me
for weeks.

246
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:20,248
Either I get some money right now,
or I'm taking Hi Hat.

247
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:24,087
Wait, wait.
I'll give you some money.

248
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:25,524
There you are.

249
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:29,325
Five dollars? That's not enough.
Come on. Well?

250
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,731
All right, all right.
I've got some more. Just...

251
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,098
There you are.

252
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:37,867
That makes 10. Chicken feed.
Come on, you've got some more.

253
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:40,306
Yeah, but it's hard to get at,
you know?

254
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:42,446
- Come on, come on.
- All right. Don't hurry.

255
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:46,379
I've got it someplace.
I know it's someplace.

256
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:48,212
Here. I knew it was someplace.

257
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:51,981
Well, that's 15.
Have you got any more?

258
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,818
- I'll let you know in a minute.
- Quit stalling. Come on, hurry.

259
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:58,359
All right, I've got some more,
but I can't hurry.

260
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,556
Hey, what are you doing? Cut it...
Get up. What is this? Cut it...

261
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,327
What are you trying to do?
Get up.

262
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:10,803
Here! Come back here!

263
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:16,977
Well, that's fine. Now we owe
the sheriff $ 120 and a sock.

264
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:19,582
It's a good thing Judy doesn't have
to depend on me.

265
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,188
- I can't even hold on to the horse.
- No? Well, we hold on to the horse.

266
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:32,990
Say, if we only had some dough.
I got a tip on Sun-Up.

267
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:36,429
Sun-Up? He's in the next race!
We don't got much time!

268
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,694
Hey, wait! What are we gonna use
for money?

269
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:43,606
Hey! What are you doing,
you crazy kook, you?

270
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:47,844
Hey, look, look!
Sun-Up, he's 10-to-1.

271
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:51,470
Oh, boy, are we gonna clean up,
10-to-1.

272
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,050
- We haven't any money to bet.
- Don't worry. I get us some money.

273
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,312
I find a sucker someplace.

274
00:17:57,488 --> 00:18:00,855
Scram. I think I see a sucker coming now.
Get out of here.

275
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:03,960
Get your ice cream.

276
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:10,729
Two dollars on Sun-Up.

277
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:14,667
Hey. Hey, boss. Boss, come here.
You want something hot?

278
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:18,832
Not now. I just had lunch.
Anyhow, I don't like hot ice cream.

279
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,106
Hey, come here. I no sell ice cream.
That's fake to fool the police.

280
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,683
I sell tips on the horses. I got something
today can't lose. One dollar.

281
00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:31,549
No. Some other time. I'm sorry.
I'm betting on Sun-Up. Some other time.

282
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:34,088
- Two dollars on Sun-Up.
- Hey, boss. Hey. Come here.

283
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:36,317
Sun-Up is the worst horse
on the track.

284
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:41,022
- I notice he wins all the time.
- Just because he comes in first.

285
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:44,167
I don't want him any better than first.
Two dollars on Sun-Up.

286
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:46,769
Hey, boss, come here.
Come here.

287
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:50,566
Suppose you bet on Sun-Up. What you
gonna get for your money? 2-to-1.

288
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:53,471
One dollar, and you'll remember me
all your life.

289
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:56,909
That's the most nauseating proposition
I ever had.

290
00:18:57,081 --> 00:19:01,541
Come on. Come on.
You look like a sport. Come on, boss.

291
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:04,381
Don't be a crunger for one buck.

292
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:09,186
Thank you.

293
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,157
- What's this?
- That's the horse.

294
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:12,590
How'd he get in here?

295
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:17,632
Get your ice cream.
Tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

296
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:20,430
"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L."

297
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:25,505
I had that same horse
when I had my eyes examined.

298
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,100
Hey, ice cream.

299
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:31,744
What about this optical illusion
you slipped me? I don't understand it.

300
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,851
That's not the real name of the horse.
That's the name in code.

301
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:36,543
Look in your codebook.

302
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:39,053
- What do you mean, "code"?
- Look in the codebook.

303
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:42,420
- That will tell you what horse you got.
- I haven't got any codebook.

304
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:44,857
- You don't got one?
- You know where I can get one?

305
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:49,398
Well, just by accident, I think
I've got one right here. Here you are.

306
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,194
- How much is it?
- That's free.

307
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:55,361
- Oh, thanks.
- Just a $ 1 printing charge.

308
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:58,468
Well, give me one without printing.
I'm sick of printing.

309
00:19:58,642 --> 00:20:01,543
Come on. You want to win?

310
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:05,273
- Yeah, sure. Of course I want to win.
- Well, then you've got to have this.

311
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:07,747
But I don't want the savings
of a lifetime...

312
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:10,580
...wiped out in the twinkling
of an eye.

313
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:16,356
- Here.
- Thank you very much.

314
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,859
Ice cream...

315
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:22,988
"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L, page 34."

316
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:28,501
Hey, ice cream, I can't make head
or tail out of this.

317
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:33,037
That's all right. Look in the master
codebook. That will tell you where to look.

318
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,371
Master code? I haven't got
any master codebook.

319
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:38,674
- You don't got a master codebook?
- Do you know where I can get one?

320
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:42,580
Well, just by accident, I think
I've got one right here. There you are.

321
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:46,450
A lot of quick accidents around here
for a quiet neighborhood.

322
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:49,855
- Is there a printing charge on this?
- No.

323
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:51,585
Oh, thanks.

324
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:54,526
Just a $2 delivery charge.

325
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:57,966
Delivery charge?
I'm standing right next to you.

326
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:01,400
Well, for such a short distance,
I make it $ 1.

327
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:04,939
Couldn't I move over here
and make it 50 cents?

328
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:08,567
Yes, but I'd move over here
and make it $ 1 just the same.

329
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,971
Say, maybe I'd better
open a charge account, eh?

330
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:13,411
You got some references?

331
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,347
The only one I know
around here is you.

332
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,352
That's no good.
You'll have to pay cash.

333
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:22,356
A little while ago, I could have put $2
on Sun-Up and avoided all this.

334
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:24,926
Yeah, throw your money away.
Thank you very much.

335
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:26,392
- I'm all set, huh?
- Yes, sir.

336
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:29,260
Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

337
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:33,392
- Master code, master code, plain code.
- Get your ice cream...

338
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:37,268
...tootsie-fruitsie.
Get your tootsie-fruitsie...

339
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:43,607
"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L. The letter Z stands for J
unless the horse is a filly."

340
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:47,114
- Get your tootsie-fruitsie...
- Hey, tootsie-fruitsie.

341
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:50,742
- Is the horse a filly?
- I don't know. Look in your breeder's guide.

342
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:53,719
Get your ice cream...

343
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:56,519
What do you mean?
I haven't got any breeder's guide.

344
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:58,662
You haven't got a breeder's guide?

345
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:02,697
Not so loud. I don't want it to get around
that I haven't got a breeder's guide.

346
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:05,995
Even my best friends don't know
I haven't got a breeder's guide.

347
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,369
Well, boss, I feel pretty sorry for you,
walking around without a breeder's guide.

348
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,567
Why, you're just throwing
your money away...

349
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:16,178
...buying those other books
without a breeder's guide.

350
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:27,881
Where can I get one?
As though I didn't know.

351
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:30,856
One is no good.
You got to have the whole set.

352
00:22:31,028 --> 00:22:33,462
Get your tootsie-fruitsie...

353
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:36,259
You know, all I wanted was a horse,
not a public library.

354
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,765
- What do you mean? How much is a set?
- One dollar.

355
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:41,427
- One dollar?
- Yeah. Four for $5.

356
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:44,631
Give me the four of them.
There's no use throwing away money.

357
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:46,105
All right, here you are.

358
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:48,677
This is all I'm buying too.
I didn't want so many...

359
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:51,815
- I thought you could do this quickly.
- There you are.

360
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:56,580
Six dollars on Sun-Up.

361
00:22:58,522 --> 00:23:01,923
- Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.
- Breeder's guide.

362
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:03,992
Get your ice cream.

363
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:08,154
- "Z-V-B-X-R-P-L is Burns."
- Yeah, that's right.

364
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:09,594
- Burns?
- Yeah.

365
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:12,827
Some days it gives you the name
of the jockey instead of the horse.

366
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:17,633
You find out who jockey Burns is riding,
and that's the horse you bet on. It's easy.

367
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:20,675
Get your ice cream, tootsie-fruitsie.

368
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:24,007
I'm getting the idea of it.
I didn't get it for a long time.

369
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:26,581
It's pretty tricky when you don't
know it, isn't it?

370
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,217
It's not that book.

371
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:30,876
- It's not that book.
- It's not that book?

372
00:23:31,055 --> 00:23:32,579
Oh, I see.

373
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:36,089
No. It's not that book.
Not that book.

374
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,791
- Nope. Nope. It's not that book.
- It's not?

375
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:45,766
No, you haven't got that book.

376
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:53,576
You've got it, huh?

377
00:23:57,848 --> 00:23:59,782
I'll get it in a minute, though, won't I?

378
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,784
Get your tootsie-fruitsie.

379
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:07,286
I'm getting a fine tootsie-fruitsying
right here.

380
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,791
Get your ice cream.

381
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:14,064
- How much is it?
- One dollar.

382
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:17,632
- And it's the last book I'm buying.
- Sure, you don't need no more. Here.

383
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,964
Now, here's a...
Here's a $ 10 bill.

384
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:23,732
- Shoot the change, will you?
- I got no change.

385
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:26,375
I'll have to give you nine more books.
You don't mind.

386
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:28,272
- You take nine more books.
- Nine more?

387
00:24:28,445 --> 00:24:32,347
- You don't handle any bookcases, do you?
- Well, you come tomorrow again.

388
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:35,576
- I didn't know that you needed...
- You're gonna win today.

389
00:24:35,753 --> 00:24:38,153
I thought you just walk up
and bet on a horse.

390
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:40,984
- Open!
- Am I shedding books down there?

391
00:24:41,158 --> 00:24:43,217
Close! Close! That's it.

392
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,589
It's a good thing I brought
my legs with me, eh?

393
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:47,856
- Now, what horse have I got?
- It's right here.

394
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:50,592
- I just heard the fella blowing his horn.
- Here it is.

395
00:24:50,768 --> 00:24:53,965
Jockey Burns, 152.
That's Rosie.

396
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:56,663
- Rosie, yeah?
- Look! Oh, boy! Look, 40-to-1!

397
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,831
- 40-to-1, huh?
- Oh, what a horse!

398
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:03,241
Am I gonna give that bookie a whipping!
I was going to bet on Sun-Up at 10-to-1.

399
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,814
- Look, it's 40-to-1.
- I'll show them a thing or two.

400
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:08,975
Hey, there, big boy.
Two dollars on Rosie, eh?

401
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:11,018
Sorry, that race is over.

402
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:13,486
- I say the race is over.
- Over? Who won?

403
00:25:13,657 --> 00:25:16,820
- Sun-Up.
- Sun-Up! That's my horse! Sun-Up.

404
00:25:16,994 --> 00:25:19,986
Sun-Up. Hurry up. Sun-Up.

405
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:26,194
Goodbye, boss. Goodbye. Sun-Up.
Ten, 20, 30... Sun-Up! Forty, 50...

406
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:33,436
Get your tootsie-fruitsie. Nice ice cream.
Nice tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

407
00:25:35,412 --> 00:25:37,073
- Oh, Miss Standish?
- Yes?

408
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:40,080
- These calls came while you were out.
- Oh, thank you.

409
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,424
Hello.

410
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,591
- Mr. Stewart?
- I'm still out.

411
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:54,595
I'm sorry. Miss Standish is still out.

412
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,759
Yes, Mr. Whitmore.

413
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:59,528
What about that call
to the Florida medical board?

414
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:02,934
What? Well, keep on trying.

415
00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:04,665
Call me the moment you get it.

416
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:07,675
You can't even get any action
out of your telephone operator.

417
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:10,405
Don't worry. I'll get the dope
on that Florida quack.

418
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:15,450
Now, listen, I want to turn this place into
a gambling casino before the season ends.

419
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:18,417
With my racetrack, my nightclub
and this...

420
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:21,524
...I'll have every sucker in America here,
but every day counts.

421
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:24,889
- I'll let you know the moment I get the call.
- I'll be waiting.

422
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:27,163
Doctor, may I have one
of your photographs?

423
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:28,559
Why, I haven't one.

424
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:31,963
I could let you have my footprints,
but they're upstairs in my socks.

425
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:34,798
I want to announce your association
with the sanitarium.

426
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:36,963
We'll send your picture
to all the papers.

427
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:39,507
- Florida papers?
- Yes. It'd be wonderful publicity.

428
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:43,578
Publicity? We mustn't have any of that.
You know, the ethics of my profession.

429
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:46,011
But we have to get new patients.

430
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:49,641
Well, after all, the old patients
were good enough for your father.

431
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,118
Besides, who wants to see my picture?

432
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:56,749
I'm not a famous man. I'm just a simple
country doctor with horse sense.

433
00:26:56,927 --> 00:26:58,326
Oh, you're too modest.

434
00:26:58,495 --> 00:27:00,725
- We'll forget about the pictures.
- That's better.

435
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:03,662
And, doctor, remember,
I'm counting on you.

436
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:06,997
The success of the sanitarium
is in your hands.

437
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:13,332
Look, Miss Standish, suppose...
Suppose I were to tell you...

438
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,410
...that I'm not the doctor
you think I am.

439
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,706
Well, you're the only one
that can help me.

440
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,849
And do be nice to Mrs. Upjohn,
won't you?

441
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:25,387
Well, she's not exactly my type,
but for you, I'd make love to a crocodile.

442
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:27,183
Silly.

443
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:33,220
Have the florist send roses to Mrs. Upjohn.
Write "Emily, I love you" on the bill.

444
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:35,797
Just a moment, Dr. Hackenbush.

445
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:38,859
Yes, Mr. Whitmore.

446
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:42,631
No, I haven't been able to get that call
through to the Florida medical board.

447
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:45,707
Well, I'm doing the best I can.
It ought to be here any minute.

448
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:49,744
If that call's what I think, she can cancel
those roses and make it lilies for me.

449
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,176
Get me Mr. Whitmore.

450
00:27:57,821 --> 00:28:00,255
- Hello?
- Here's your Florida call, Mr. Whitmore.

451
00:28:00,424 --> 00:28:02,722
All right. Hello?

452
00:28:02,893 --> 00:28:05,361
Florida medical board.
Good morning.

453
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:08,327
I'd like to talk to the man
in charge of the records, please.

454
00:28:08,498 --> 00:28:10,625
Record department?
Just a moment, sugar.

455
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:14,902
Record department.
Colonel Hawkins talking.

456
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:19,405
Colonel Hawkins, did you get a wire
from me regarding Dr. Hackenbush?

457
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:22,844
I'm sorry, sir, but there's a hurricane
blowing down here...

458
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:25,675
...and you'll have to talk
a little louder.

459
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:28,317
It certainly is the windiest day
we ever did have.

460
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,747
<i>It certainly is windy!</i>

461
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:35,256
I want to know about Dr. Hackenbush!

462
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:40,827
- Yes?
- Whitmore, cut out that squawking.

463
00:28:40,998 --> 00:28:43,193
The patients are all complaining.

464
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:46,461
<i>And I hope, sir, that that's</i>
<i>the information that you require.</i>

465
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:50,232
I'm sorry, colonel. I didn't hear it.
I was called to the Dictograph.

466
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:54,776
- What was that you said, sir?
- I was called to the Dictograph!

467
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:02,173
Whitmore, one more yelp out of you,
and I'll have you bounced out of here.

468
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:05,185
<i>And I trust, sir, that that answers</i>
<i>your question.</i>

469
00:29:05,355 --> 00:29:08,518
I'm terribly sorry, colonel.
I didn't hear you.

470
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:11,126
I can't hear you. You'll have to talk
a bit louder.

471
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:15,629
I want to find out something
about Hackenbush!

472
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:20,634
- Well, what is it now?
- That's the last time...

473
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:22,863
...I'm gonna warn you
about that yowling.

474
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:25,901
<i>And in conclusion,</i>
<i>let me say</i>...

475
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:29,136
I'm sorry, colonel. What was
that you said about Hackenbush?

476
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:33,647
Hacken... You mean, Dr. Hackenbush?
Oh, no. He's not here.

477
00:29:33,817 --> 00:29:36,285
I know he's not there. He's here!

478
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:39,251
Then what are you
bothering me for, Yankee?

479
00:29:39,423 --> 00:29:42,415
But I want to know something
about his Florida record.

480
00:29:42,592 --> 00:29:44,423
Here's your Florida call, Mr. Whitmore.

481
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:46,323
Operator, will you get off the line?!

482
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:49,226
- Hello? Hello, colonel.
- <i>Yes?</i>

483
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:53,426
Are you sure you're speaking
of Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush?

484
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:55,935
- Who?
- Hugo Z. Hackenbush!

485
00:29:56,573 --> 00:29:57,801
Who's calling him?

486
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:03,445
- The Standish Sanitarium.
- Yeah, that's where he works.

487
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:06,309
Say, I understand he's doing
a mighty fine job up there.

488
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:07,973
I...

489
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:13,420
I want to get some information
regarding his qualifications for the job.

490
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,150
- What job?
- As head of the sanitarium!

491
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:18,191
- Who?
- Hackenbush!

492
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,761
- Whitmore, are you calling me?
- No, you sap!

493
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:31,874
- Hello.
- Yes, now, what was that name?

494
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:34,467
Hackenbush. Hackenbush!

495
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:40,176
Well, as soon as he comes in,
I'll have him get in touch with you.

496
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:49,985
Hey, you see that sourpuss?

497
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,253
That's Whitmore,
the man you gotta watch.

498
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:54,454
You see, he's no good.
He's in with Morgan...

499
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:58,761
...and I think they're trying to get
the sanitarium away from Miss Judy.

500
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,262
Hey, hey! No, no, no.

501
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,931
You no gonna fight him.
You gonna watch him.

502
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:08,202
You gotta watch him like a hawk.

503
00:31:08,378 --> 00:31:11,870
That's it. Not so fast.
No, not so fast.

504
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:14,346
First, I gotta get you
in here as a patient...

505
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:16,679
...or else Whitmore's going
to get wise to you.

506
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:19,651
Come on, I take you to the doctor.

507
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:23,919
Stuffy! Stuffy! Hey, come here.
Hey, he won't hurt you.

508
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:27,530
No, no, come here.
This fella's a nice doctor.

509
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:31,258
You're hungry, eh?
You want some ice cream?

510
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:34,199
You want a nice, big steak?
With spinach?

511
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:36,965
All right, all right.
No spinach. No spinach.

512
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,632
Apple pie? And beautiful nurses?

513
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,575
Oh, baby, come on.
You're gonna get a nurse.

514
00:31:43,747 --> 00:31:45,874
Oh, my, you're gonna get plenty.

515
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:48,184
- Have you seen Dr. Hackenbush?
- No, doctor.

516
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:49,943
Go find him.
Mrs. Upjohn wants him.

517
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,386
- What's the matter with Mrs. Upjohn?
- Nothing, in its most violent form.

518
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:02,192
- Pick me up at 5.
- Yes, sir.

519
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,568
- May I have an okay on this, please?
- I'm too busy right now.

520
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:12,640
I'll put the O on now
and come back later for the K.

521
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:14,674
- Dr. Hackenbush.
- A little later.

522
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:16,710
- Get me the Turkish bath.
- Yes, sir.

523
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,212
Dr. Hackenbush, Mrs. Upjohn
is complaining again...

524
00:32:19,382 --> 00:32:21,543
...and these x-rays show
nothing wrong with her.

525
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:25,154
Is that so? Who are you gonna believe,
me or those crooked x-rays?

526
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:27,790
Doctor, the Turkish bath.

527
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:32,395
Hello? Gus, will you look in the steam room
and see if my frankfurters are done?

528
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:36,732
That will be all.
I have some important research.

529
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,595
Now...

530
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:56,585
Excuse me.

531
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:59,553
Oh, so you're the doctor.

532
00:32:59,723 --> 00:33:02,283
Yeah, remember me?
I used to be in the book business.

533
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:04,017
Hey, forget about that, doc.

534
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:07,061
- I got some good news for you.
- Yeah? What are the odds?

535
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,721
No, no, it's no horse.
I got a patient for you.

536
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,993
Oh, a patient? Oh, fine.
What size?

537
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:15,437
- You didn't get him here any too soon.
- Hey, Stuffy!

538
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:18,506
Sit down here till I snatch you
from the jaws of death.

539
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:22,441
- Just sit quietly.
- Sit down.

540
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:35,752
Either he's dead,
or my watch has stopped.

541
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:38,324
He's a good doctor.

542
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:40,656
Knows his business.

543
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:48,226
Singing doctor.

544
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:51,033
Here you are. Oh, come on.
This isn't gonna hurt.

545
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:54,836
- Come on, everybody gets that.
- Open up those pearly gates.

546
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:57,673
Flip this under your flapper. Attaboy.

547
00:33:57,847 --> 00:34:01,305
- Didn't hurt, did it, huh?
- He's pretty sick, eh, doc?

548
00:34:10,594 --> 00:34:13,859
Well, that temperature
certainly went down fast.

549
00:34:15,332 --> 00:34:18,961
Hey, don't drink that poison!
That's $4 an ounce.

550
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:22,204
We better put him to bed.
He looks awfully sick today.

551
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:23,839
Better get him a nurse too.

552
00:34:24,007 --> 00:34:26,737
If he thinks that, he'll go to bed.

553
00:34:28,478 --> 00:34:32,471
- Come on.
- There, now. Take it easy, will you?

554
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:34,879
He's been a doctor for years,
this fella.

555
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:38,452
I've been a doctor longer than you've been
a patient, I'll tell you that.

556
00:34:38,622 --> 00:34:41,056
Come on. Why do you do like that?

557
00:34:41,224 --> 00:34:43,954
What do you think,
he's gonna play with you?

558
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:50,894
No, don't look at me.
Let me look at you, huh?

559
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:54,800
No.

560
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:57,701
Don't look at me.
What do you think I am, a peepshow?

561
00:34:57,874 --> 00:35:00,001
Get away there, will you?

562
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:04,940
It's rather a strange-Iooking sight.

563
00:35:05,115 --> 00:35:09,074
- Yeah, it's serious, huh, doc?
- I haven't seen anything like this in years.

564
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:12,619
The last time I saw a head like that
was in a bottle of formaldehyde.

565
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:16,156
- I told you he was sick.
- That's all pure desiccation along there.

566
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:21,026
He's got about a 15-percent metabolism
with an overactive thyroid...

567
00:35:21,197 --> 00:35:23,995
...and a glandular affectation
of about 3 percent.

568
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:27,830
- That's bad, huh?
- With a 1 -percent mentality.

569
00:35:28,171 --> 00:35:32,608
He's what we designate
as the crummy, moronic type.

570
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:38,538
This is the most gruesome-Iooking
piece of blubber I've ever peered at.

571
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:40,876
Hey, doc! Hey, doc.

572
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:44,953
You got the looking glass turned around.
You're looking at yourself.

573
00:35:45,822 --> 00:35:47,722
I knew it all the time.

574
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:50,621
That was a good joke on all of us,
wasn't it?

575
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:55,191
Let's do it again sometime, huh?

576
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,662
Say, "Ah."

577
00:35:59,836 --> 00:36:01,599
Louder.

578
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:04,436
Louder!

579
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:08,608
- Hey, doc, where you going?
- I'm going to the ear doctor. I'm deaf.

580
00:36:08,778 --> 00:36:11,508
Come on back. It's not you. It's him.

581
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:14,775
Sometimes, I'm not sure
who's getting the examination here.

582
00:36:16,252 --> 00:36:18,379
Take it easy, now, huh?

583
00:36:28,264 --> 00:36:30,789
Say, am I stewed,
or did a grapefruit just fly past?

584
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:32,958
I don't see nothing.

585
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:46,714
If that's his Adam's apple,
he's got yellow fever.

586
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:49,317
- He's got ingrown balloons.
- He has, huh?

587
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:51,886
Well, we'll soon find out.

588
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,588
- Hold that till I get a rock.
- He's got a blister on his tongue.

589
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:02,755
- Is that what it is?
- I think he's a Ubangi.

590
00:37:02,932 --> 00:37:06,095
Well, I'll get the hammer
and "Ubangi" that right off.

591
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:10,296
I had a case like that once in Dsseldorf
many years ago, and...

592
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:13,237
Say, it's grown considerably,
hasn't it, huh?

593
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:17,243
- What's that hairy fungus all over it?
- Some fungus, eh, doc?

594
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:19,745
Not a great deal, no.

595
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,851
- Well...
- You're making a mistake. That's his head.

596
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:25,920
If that's his head,
he's making a mistake, not me.

597
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:31,458
I can't do anything for him.
That's a case for Frank Buck.

598
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:34,925
Put him in the room
till Frank Buck gets here.

599
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:38,431
Fine. Shall we say a 50-buck room,
or would you prefer something better?

600
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:40,660
- We'll take something better.
- That's nice.

601
00:37:40,837 --> 00:37:45,365
- But we'll talk about the money tomorrow.
- Oh, no. Money on the line, or out you go.

602
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:51,380
"To Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush,
for saving my horse."

603
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:54,676
- Come here with that watch.
- You, a horse doctor?

604
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:57,217
- A little easy with that talk.
- A horse doctor.

605
00:37:57,387 --> 00:38:00,550
- Don't mention that word around here.
- Hey, that's terrible.

606
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:02,953
I'm gonna tell Miss Judy quick.

607
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:05,026
No. That's no good.

608
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:08,790
Miss Judy, she's depending on you.
A horse doctor.

609
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:12,901
Now, listen, boys, I admit it.
You've caught me with my coat down.

610
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:16,903
- Well, it's been nice knowing you.
- Oh, no, you don't. Oh, no.

611
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:19,667
Let's get together.
I'm open to any kind of proposition.

612
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:22,004
All right, you stick on this job.

613
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:26,080
You make Mrs. Upjohn happy,
or we're gonna have you thrown in jail.

614
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:28,547
Well, that doesn't leave me
much choice, does it?

615
00:38:29,152 --> 00:38:31,347
Nobody must know
you're a horse doctor.

616
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:36,420
You make one false move,
and we fix you good.

617
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:41,428
I hate to admit it,
but I haven't got a leg to stand on.

618
00:38:41,598 --> 00:38:43,031
Now, let's...
Hey, wait a minute!

619
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,133
- Bring that over here.
- There it goes.

620
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:48,498
- No, whip it around the other way.
- You keep quiet.

621
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,764
- We know what we're doing.
- Okay.

622
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,431
Say, I thought I wasn't
gonna be able to walk again.

623
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,134
- I got it too.
- It's fine now.

624
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:58,212
Stuffy, I got it. Come on.

625
00:39:09,192 --> 00:39:10,853
1:44. That's bad.

626
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:13,655
You think that's bad?
I know something worse than that.

627
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,661
- Did Stuffy tell you?
- Tell me what?

628
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:17,925
- Hackenapuss, he's a horse doctor.
- What?

629
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:22,504
- Sure. Here, ask Stuffy.
- A horse doctor?

630
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:27,306
- Does anyone else know about this?
- Only Hackenapuss, and he won't talk.

631
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:29,274
It's bound to get out sooner or later.

632
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:32,278
There must be something
we can do to help Judy.

633
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:37,647
Yes. Hi Hat, you gotta win the race
and make us plenty of money.

634
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:41,455
Stuffy's right.
Hi Hat's too hungry to run.

635
00:39:41,624 --> 00:39:45,060
I'm gonna get paid extra for singing
at the water carnival tonight.

636
00:39:45,228 --> 00:39:48,129
That's fine. You sing,
I sell some more books...

637
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:50,391
...and Stuffy, he's gonna
put Hi Hat to bed.

638
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:52,534
I've gotta go to rehearsal.
See you later.

639
00:39:52,702 --> 00:39:54,567
- All right. Good luck.
- Hey, you!

640
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:55,965
Hello, sheriff.

641
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:59,802
I told you not to take this horse out
till I got the rest of my dough.

642
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:02,308
We didn't take him out.
He walked out, we followed.

643
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:04,446
I warned you.
Now I'm taking the nag.

644
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:09,745
Hey, you can't take that horse. How will
we win money to pay the feed bill?

645
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:14,379
That don't mean a thing to me. I'm gonna
put him where nobody will take him out.

646
00:41:38,101 --> 00:41:40,467
He couldn't get you,
so he took six other girls.

647
00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:45,694
Isn't it beautiful?

648
00:47:45,868 --> 00:47:48,530
It's the prettiest number
I've ever seen.

649
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:55,037
Oh, Hugo, it's so impress...

650
00:47:56,112 --> 00:47:57,670
Now what?

651
00:47:57,847 --> 00:48:00,611
The idea!

652
00:48:01,951 --> 00:48:03,714
Oh, now, Judy, wait a minute.

653
00:48:03,886 --> 00:48:06,377
I want to talk to you.
You can't depend on Hackenbush.

654
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:10,582
Mrs. Upjohn is perfectly satisfied with
Dr. Hackenbush, and that's what matters.

655
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,285
In fact, she may take over
the notes tomorrow.

656
00:48:14,563 --> 00:48:17,157
I guess everything's all right.
Nothing to worry about?

657
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:19,961
No, not a thing,
except that horse of yours.

658
00:48:20,136 --> 00:48:22,400
Wait. That horse is all right.
He's in the pink.

659
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:25,563
Why, today he ran the mile in 1:36.
That horse is going places.

660
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:28,676
Oh, that's wonderful.
I wish you luck.

661
00:48:28,844 --> 00:48:31,711
- Thanks. I'm sorry I bothered you.
- It's all right.

662
00:48:32,948 --> 00:48:36,509
Now, Judy, I'm the biggest liar
in seven states.

663
00:48:36,685 --> 00:48:38,744
He isn't all right,
he isn't in the pink...

664
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:41,219
...and it was 1:44 instead of 1:36...

665
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,291
...and the only place he'll go
is where the sheriff takes him.

666
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,429
You can't possibly mean Hi Hat.

667
00:48:47,897 --> 00:48:50,127
Well, there's only one horse
in my stable.

668
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:52,130
Come on, let me have the rest of it.

669
00:48:52,902 --> 00:48:54,927
The only thing I'm going
to say is this, Gil:

670
00:48:55,104 --> 00:48:58,801
Don't ever let a horse
come between us again.

671
00:49:00,576 --> 00:49:01,941
She loves him.

672
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:04,443
Everything is going to be
all right now.

673
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:19,492
Change your partners.

674
00:49:42,718 --> 00:49:46,882
- Hugo, I am surprised at you.
- Oh, you didn't know I could rumba?

675
00:49:53,362 --> 00:49:55,660
Change your partners.

676
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:21,980
How would you like me
to dance away from you?

677
00:50:22,157 --> 00:50:25,149
I'd be satisfied if you'd dance
off my feet.

678
00:51:03,866 --> 00:51:07,029
I'm disappointed. To think of your dancing
with that strange woman.

679
00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:10,433
Well, don't think of it.
Think of me dancing with you.

680
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:17,368
I'm crazy about you.

681
00:51:18,213 --> 00:51:21,080
Nothing will ever
come between us again.

682
00:51:22,484 --> 00:51:24,475
You don't know
how Ionely I get at night...

683
00:51:24,653 --> 00:51:27,178
...in my little room at the sanitarium.

684
00:51:27,356 --> 00:51:28,789
Room 412.

685
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:32,223
Perhaps I could come in
and say good night to you.

686
00:51:32,394 --> 00:51:36,228
Yes. We could have a midnight snack,
nice little steak between us.

687
00:51:36,632 --> 00:51:38,691
Why, Hugo!

688
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:42,064
You'd stay up until midnight.
That's how you follow doctor's orders.

689
00:51:42,237 --> 00:51:45,798
You know you're supposed to be in bed
by 10:00. 12:00. 10:00.

690
00:52:00,155 --> 00:52:02,555
Listen, we mustn't have
any disturbance here tonight.

691
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:06,559
All right. I can wait.

692
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:51,656
Well, it's in the bag. I have a date
with him in his room at 12.

693
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:55,098
Nice going. See that you stay there
till I break in with Mrs. Upjohn.

694
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,738
I want Hackenbush fired
out of the sanitarium tonight.

695
00:58:57,906 --> 00:59:00,033
Don't worry.
When you knock on the door...

696
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:04,144
...I'll have that moth-eaten Romeo
playing the balcony scene.

697
00:59:18,593 --> 00:59:21,289
I got you. I got you. L...

698
00:59:21,463 --> 00:59:23,897
You're spoiling my game.
What's the matter?

699
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:25,761
What's the matter?

700
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:27,868
Buffalo Bill?

701
00:59:28,804 --> 00:59:31,500
Buffalo Bill goes ice-skating?

702
00:59:37,145 --> 00:59:38,407
Oh, Hackenbush!

703
00:59:38,747 --> 00:59:41,238
Oh, what's the matter with him?

704
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:43,407
Dr. Hackenbush.

705
00:59:43,585 --> 00:59:45,644
He's got a snake?

706
00:59:46,888 --> 00:59:48,219
No.

707
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:50,551
He's got apple dumpling?

708
00:59:51,259 --> 00:59:52,692
Dr. Hackenbush...

709
00:59:52,861 --> 00:59:54,988
...he's got apple dumpling.

710
00:59:55,497 --> 00:59:56,896
No apple dumpling.

711
00:59:57,065 --> 00:59:59,260
No, it's no apple dumpling. No.

712
00:59:59,434 --> 01:00:00,662
No.

713
01:00:00,836 --> 01:00:03,805
Oh, it's a woman! A woman.
Oh, I get it.

714
01:00:03,972 --> 01:00:07,237
Oh, there's a woman.
Yeah. Smart, eh?

715
01:00:08,076 --> 01:00:10,044
Dr. Hackenbush...

716
01:00:10,212 --> 01:00:12,146
...there's a woman...

717
01:00:12,914 --> 01:00:14,677
...she got a wooden leg?

718
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,078
No?

719
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:18,151
She got a woodpecker?

720
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,117
She got a headache?

721
01:00:21,857 --> 01:00:23,290
Dr. Hackenbush...

722
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:24,948
...there's a woman...

723
01:00:25,127 --> 01:00:27,118
...she knock on the door!

724
01:00:27,295 --> 01:00:29,286
She knock on the door!
All right. All right.

725
01:00:29,464 --> 01:00:33,798
Dr. Hackenbush, there's a woman,
she knock on the door...

726
01:00:39,908 --> 01:00:42,433
You're crazy!
You make me sick.

727
01:00:42,611 --> 01:00:44,340
What's the matter now?

728
01:00:46,615 --> 01:00:48,242
Oh, she's going to frame him!

729
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:51,749
Oh, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up.

730
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:23,914
- Who is it?
- It's Miss Marlowe.

731
01:01:24,085 --> 01:01:26,280
Just a moment, fruitcake.

732
01:01:45,941 --> 01:01:47,738
Yes?

733
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:49,840
Oh, doctor.

734
01:01:50,011 --> 01:01:52,343
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

735
01:01:52,914 --> 01:01:54,905
- Do you like gardenias?
- I adore them.

736
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:57,745
- How did you know?
- I didn't, so I got you forget-me-nots.

737
01:01:59,054 --> 01:02:01,716
One whiff of this,
and you'll forget everything.

738
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:04,548
Won't you sit down?

739
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:11,660
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

740
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,357
Oh, do you mind?

741
01:02:13,535 --> 01:02:16,265
Not at all. I always take the wrap.

742
01:02:17,138 --> 01:02:19,436
You are such a charming host.

743
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:21,439
The Hackenbushes, we're all like that.

744
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:23,771
- How about a short beer?
- Nothing, thank you.

745
01:02:23,945 --> 01:02:25,572
Thank you.

746
01:02:27,682 --> 01:02:31,743
Miss Marlowe, I've dreamed
of this moment ever since I met you.

747
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,184
For days, I've been trying to see you...

748
01:02:34,356 --> 01:02:36,881
...and I still don't seem
to be able to make the grade.

749
01:02:37,058 --> 01:02:40,858
A quiet evening alone with you.
What more could anyone ask?

750
01:02:41,363 --> 01:02:43,388
Say, did you sneak out of here?

751
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:45,692
Oh, there you are.

752
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:49,463
Isn't this too, too devastating?

753
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:52,438
You mind carving?
I can't reach the steak from here.

754
01:02:52,607 --> 01:02:54,234
Me?

755
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:56,036
Yes?

756
01:02:56,411 --> 01:02:59,073
Hey, doc. Hey, doc, can you see us?

757
01:02:59,347 --> 01:03:01,872
If I can't, there's something wrong
with my glasses.

758
01:03:02,984 --> 01:03:04,815
You mean, her? She's the one?

759
01:03:04,986 --> 01:03:06,214
We fix her.

760
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:11,181
Oh, baby, you look good to me!

761
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,587
Oh, stop it!

762
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:15,628
Wait a minute.
I thought you came here to see me.

763
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:18,095
Well, I can see you from here.

764
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:19,961
Get up, you...

765
01:03:20,135 --> 01:03:21,534
You know my friend.

766
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:29,770
Oh, no. Not for me,
three men on a horse.

767
01:03:30,312 --> 01:03:32,974
What is the meaning of this?

768
01:03:33,148 --> 01:03:34,740
Why, you little pest.

769
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:37,851
What's the matter with you mugs?
Haven't you got any gallantry?

770
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:40,214
She's with Whitmore.
She's trying to frame you.

771
01:03:40,388 --> 01:03:43,221
Wouldn't mind framing her.
A prettier picture I've never seen.

772
01:03:43,391 --> 01:03:44,619
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

773
01:03:44,793 --> 01:03:47,990
Hey, doc. Doc, I'm telling you a secret!
She's out to get you!

774
01:03:48,163 --> 01:03:50,597
Why, I've never been so insulted
in my life.

775
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:52,960
Well, it's early yet.

776
01:03:53,134 --> 01:03:55,932
I'm leaving. I'm not going to stay here
with these men.

777
01:03:56,104 --> 01:03:59,130
You're not leaving. They're leaving.
I want you fellas to get out.

778
01:03:59,307 --> 01:04:01,741
- Oh, my cape!
- Come back here with my woman.

779
01:04:02,477 --> 01:04:04,968
You fellas are busting up
a beautiful romance.

780
01:04:05,146 --> 01:04:07,011
Get her out.
She's going to make trouble.

781
01:04:07,182 --> 01:04:10,777
You're wrong. This is my aunt. She's
come to talk over some family matters.

782
01:04:10,952 --> 01:04:12,647
I wish I had an aunt look like that.

783
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:14,618
Well, take it up with your uncle.

784
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:17,314
Hey, doc. Doc, you're playing with fire.

785
01:04:17,492 --> 01:04:20,256
- You didn't mind getting scorched.
- I got fire insurance.

786
01:04:20,428 --> 01:04:21,918
Well, you better get accident.

787
01:04:22,097 --> 01:04:24,327
Scram. Blow.

788
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:33,938
How do you like those cheap chiselers
horning in on us?

789
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:38,974
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

790
01:04:45,286 --> 01:04:47,880
- How about a little Scotch?
- Why, I'd love it.

791
01:04:48,056 --> 01:04:49,956
Oh, I'll ring for some.

792
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:53,060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

793
01:04:54,763 --> 01:04:57,823
Will you have the bellhop
hop up with some hop Scotch?

794
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,729
I'll flip you to see who pays for it.

795
01:05:00,902 --> 01:05:03,496
Oh, doctor.

796
01:05:11,312 --> 01:05:12,904
I'm O'Reilly, the house detective.

797
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:15,811
Don't talk so loud.
Your mustache will drop off.

798
01:05:16,384 --> 01:05:17,783
Have you got a woman in here?

799
01:05:17,952 --> 01:05:20,512
If I haven't, I've wasted 30 minutes
of valuable time.

800
01:05:20,688 --> 01:05:23,657
You better get her out.
This is the last time I'll tell you.

801
01:05:23,825 --> 01:05:25,520
The last time? Can I depend on that?

802
01:05:25,693 --> 01:05:29,129
Yes, because this time,
I'm going to stay all night.

803
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:37,394
- This looks like a tough case.
- So does this.

804
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:40,369
I think I'll call me assistant.

805
01:05:54,088 --> 01:05:57,148
If you're looking for my fingerprints,
you're a little early.

806
01:06:08,303 --> 01:06:10,669
When you're through
with that steak, chew him.

807
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,044
Pull in your ears.
You're coming to a tunnel.

808
01:06:18,847 --> 01:06:22,943
Get along, little doggies.
Get along, little doggies.

809
01:06:23,952 --> 01:06:25,385
It's been a nice, quiet dinner.

810
01:06:25,553 --> 01:06:28,613
How do you know?
You haven't had any yet. Shall we?

811
01:06:31,826 --> 01:06:33,691
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

812
01:06:37,332 --> 01:06:39,095
Tomato soup?

813
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:45,900
Have you got a can opener?

814
01:06:46,074 --> 01:06:47,905
Oh, here it is.

815
01:06:49,277 --> 01:06:50,972
Oh, I'm really not hungry.

816
01:06:51,145 --> 01:06:52,737
Couldn't we just sit over here?

817
01:06:52,914 --> 01:06:56,350
I want to be near you.
I want you to hold me.

818
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:58,577
Oh, hold me closer.

819
01:06:58,753 --> 01:07:01,813
Closer. Closer.

820
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,720
If I hold you any closer,
I'll be in back of you.

821
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,085
You're so comforting.

822
01:07:08,263 --> 01:07:10,026
The Hackenbushes, we're all like that.

823
01:07:10,198 --> 01:07:12,632
Shall we sit down and bat it around?

824
01:07:21,075 --> 01:07:24,135
You're a little near-seated...
A little nearsighted, aren't you?

825
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:29,977
Oh, no. There's nobody else going
to get in. I bolted the door.

826
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,414
Say, fun is fun.

827
01:07:40,128 --> 01:07:42,221
We come to hang the paper.

828
01:07:42,397 --> 01:07:44,957
How about hanging yourself instead?

829
01:07:47,535 --> 01:07:50,834
- Well, I'm going to stay right here.
- Thank you.

830
01:07:51,005 --> 01:07:55,704
That's right, Stuffy. You work that side, I
work this side, and we meet on the ceiling.

831
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:58,710
You'll wind up on the gallows
is my prediction.

832
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:03,874
I must be a citizen.
I just got my second papers.

833
01:08:08,723 --> 01:08:11,817
Looks like a wet track tomorrow, Stuffy.

834
01:08:13,895 --> 01:08:18,389
- I think Stuffy's is the one with water.
- I'll see that he's dismissed immediately.

835
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:23,696
What's going on?

836
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:27,397
Good gracious!

837
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:32,238
You're mistaken. There's no woman here.

838
01:08:32,413 --> 01:08:34,574
- What are they...?
- No?

839
01:08:38,553 --> 01:08:40,111
Hugo!

840
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:41,653
What are you doing?

841
01:08:41,823 --> 01:08:44,951
I'm having the place done over.
It'll make a lovely honeymoon suite.

842
01:08:48,096 --> 01:08:49,654
- Good...
- You better go, dear.

843
01:08:49,831 --> 01:08:52,231
- We're tearing up the floor next.
- Oh, my.

844
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,426
Come, Mr. Whitmore.
I've a few words to say to you.

845
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,874
Boys, you were wonderful.
You saved my life.

846
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:09,009
I'll get even. You... You dirty, low-down,
cheap, double-crossing snake.

847
01:09:09,183 --> 01:09:10,878
Thank you.

848
01:09:18,593 --> 01:09:22,051
Hugo, speak to me.

849
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:25,565
I said I was sorry about last night.

850
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:28,964
I never should have mistrusted you.

851
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:33,164
Isn't there anything I can do
to make you forgive me?

852
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:36,208
You could take over the notes
from Miss Standish.

853
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:38,406
Then would you forgive me?

854
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:40,513
Well, it would help.

855
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:44,613
Emily, I can't hide it any longer.
I love you.

856
01:09:44,786 --> 01:09:46,515
Oh, Hugo.

857
01:09:46,688 --> 01:09:49,452
It's the old, old story, boy meets girl.

858
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:51,353
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

859
01:09:51,526 --> 01:09:53,323
Minneapolis and St. Paul.

860
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:55,391
Mrs. Upjohn.

861
01:09:55,897 --> 01:09:57,865
Judy has the papers ready
for you to sign.

862
01:09:58,032 --> 01:10:00,000
Later, later. Can't you see we're busy?

863
01:10:00,168 --> 01:10:02,295
It's all right.
I'll remember where I left off.

864
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:05,303
Must they do that now?

865
01:10:06,174 --> 01:10:07,869
Mrs. Upjohn, just a moment, please.

866
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:11,341
Mrs. Upjohn, may I present
Dr. Leopold X. Steinberg of Vienna?

867
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:14,675
And this is Dr. Hackenbush.

868
01:10:14,849 --> 01:10:18,410
Doctor. I have a few questions
I would like to ask you.

869
01:10:18,586 --> 01:10:20,520
I've got a question I'd like to ask you.

870
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:24,089
Steinberg, what do you do
with your old razorblades?

871
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:27,560
I've been telling Dr. Steinberg
about your unusual case.

872
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:32,632
Yes, and I would like to know
what is this ailment, double blood pressure?

873
01:10:34,135 --> 01:10:37,036
Dr. Hackenbush tells me
I'm the only case in history.

874
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:42,939
I have high blood pressure on my right
side and low blood pressure on my left side.

875
01:10:43,111 --> 01:10:44,976
There is no such thing.

876
01:10:45,146 --> 01:10:47,137
She looks as healthy
as any woman I've met.

877
01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:49,745
You don't look like
you ever met a healthy woman.

878
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,976
- What?
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

879
01:10:52,153 --> 01:10:55,850
There's a very simple way to settle this.
Why not examine Mrs. Upjohn?

880
01:10:56,023 --> 01:10:58,355
- Splendid, splendid.
- Right this way, Mrs. Upjohn.

881
01:10:58,526 --> 01:11:02,428
Dr. Hackenbush will show you,
then I insist that you apologize to him.

882
01:11:02,597 --> 01:11:06,124
Come, Hugo. The idea!

883
01:11:08,703 --> 01:11:12,400
Hey, doc, where you going?
If Steinberg examines her, we're through.

884
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:14,200
- I'm through right now.
- You're not.

885
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:17,367
You gotta get in there.
Do anything, but stop Steinberg. Hurry.

886
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:20,810
I'll say. I'm hopping the next
banana boat for Central America.

887
01:11:20,982 --> 01:11:22,847
Hey, doc, where you going?

888
01:11:23,317 --> 01:11:25,342
Wait, doc. Wait.

889
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:31,750
It's all right with me. Go right ahead.
I'm not sleeping here tonight.

890
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:36,992
- It's Hi Hat.
- Nonsense. That's a horse.

891
01:11:37,165 --> 01:11:40,965
No, it's Hi Hat. We hide him in the closet
so the sheriff can't find him.

892
01:11:41,135 --> 01:11:43,262
Is that so?
He's not going to find me either...

893
01:11:43,437 --> 01:11:45,564
...because I'm leaving here
right away, boys.

894
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,401
Doc, doc, wait a minute, now.

895
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:50,100
- No, I'll see you again sometime.
- No, doc, please.

896
01:11:50,278 --> 01:11:52,974
See you again, just as soon
as I get my effects.

897
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:56,446
Old Hackenbush isn't gonna be
with you very long.

898
01:11:56,617 --> 01:12:01,077
- Doc, you can't walk out on us like this.
- I'll say I can't. I'm gonna run out.

899
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:05,120
You can't go, doc.
If you walk out, where will Judy be?

900
01:12:05,293 --> 01:12:08,126
She won't be in jail,
and that's where I'll be if I stay here.

901
01:12:08,296 --> 01:12:09,524
Besides, what can I do?

902
01:12:09,697 --> 01:12:13,258
- You've got to stop the examination.
- Not today I don't.

903
01:12:13,434 --> 01:12:15,129
Are you a man or a mouse?

904
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:18,397
You put a piece of cheese down there,
and you'll find out.

905
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,036
Well, it's been nice seeing you.

906
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:25,140
Oh, no, you don't.
You leave, it's over my dead body.

907
01:12:25,313 --> 01:12:27,076
Well, that's a pleasant way to travel.

908
01:12:27,248 --> 01:12:30,843
All right. Now, look, doc.
You can't leave Miss Judy in a fix like this.

909
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:32,952
- I know, but the sheriff...
- Doc, doc.

910
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,954
If you leave now,
Judy loses the sanitarium.

911
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:38,519
All right. I'll stay.

912
01:12:38,693 --> 01:12:41,184
You're gonna stay?
I knew you'd do it, doc.

913
01:12:42,263 --> 01:12:43,992
Next, we will see...

914
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:45,962
Just a moment. Take your hands off her!

915
01:12:46,133 --> 01:12:47,691
A fine doctor you are.

916
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:50,895
You're not supposed to touch a patient
without being sterilized.

917
01:12:51,072 --> 01:12:53,336
You don't see me running
an examination like that.

918
01:12:53,507 --> 01:12:55,407
No, that's true.

919
01:12:55,576 --> 01:12:57,567
And I think it would be very interesting...

920
01:12:57,745 --> 01:13:00,839
...to see just how Dr. Hackenbush
does conduct an examination.

921
01:13:01,015 --> 01:13:04,212
Splendid, splendid. Show them, doctor.

922
01:13:04,385 --> 01:13:06,478
If you insist, I'll proceed.

923
01:13:16,264 --> 01:13:19,722
In case you've never done it,
this is known as washing your hands.

924
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:35,546
I'd rather have it rusty than missing.

925
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:42,982
You'll go a long ways to see
prettier drippings than those.

926
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:46,888
Why sterilization? After all,
this is not an operation, you know?

927
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:52,158
Not yet, but I may get hot and operate
on everybody in the joint, including you.

928
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:55,360
Come, come, doctor. Aren't you ready?

929
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:58,498
Now, Mrs. Upjohn,
I guess I know my business.

930
01:13:58,673 --> 01:14:00,664
Of course, that's just a guess
on my part...

931
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:03,776
...but at any rate, I know a thing
or two about cleanliness...

932
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:07,472
...and that's more than I can say
for that mountain goat standing there.

933
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:13,009
Come, doctor. We're waiting.

934
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:15,815
All right. If you insist,
we'll proceed at once.

935
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,891
Now, Mrs. Upjohn,
I want you to take your arms...

936
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:22,427
...and let them wave through the air
with the greatest of ease.

937
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:25,560
Not too swiftly.

938
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:28,827
- Like that, doctor?
- Yes, that's splendid.

939
01:14:29,003 --> 01:14:31,198
How long do you want me
to do this, doctor?

940
01:14:31,372 --> 01:14:33,897
Just until you fly away.

941
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,574
I told you guys to stay down
in that room with those pigeons.

942
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,221
Dr. Hackenbush, tell me,
who sent for these men?

943
01:14:57,398 --> 01:15:00,595
You don't have to send for them.
You just rub a lamp, and they appear.

944
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:03,100
- My name is Steinberg.
- Nix. Nix. That's Steinberg.

945
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:06,967
Dr. Steinberg, by a strange coincidence,
this is another Dr. Steinberg.

946
01:15:07,141 --> 01:15:10,872
May I introduce my colleagues
and good friends, another Dr. Steinberg?

947
01:15:11,045 --> 01:15:13,070
This is a Dr. Steinberg, Dr. Steinberg.

948
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:15,511
Dr. Steinberg and Mrs. Steinberg.

949
01:15:15,683 --> 01:15:18,948
And, doctor, I'd like you
to meet another Dr. Steinberg.

950
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:21,186
And that's Steinberg Jr.

951
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:25,618
If Dr. Hackenbush is not going to continue
with the examination, professor...

952
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:29,285
...may we have your diagnosis, please?
- With pleasure.

953
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:31,055
In all my years of medicine...

954
01:15:31,232 --> 01:15:34,599
In your years of medicine. You don't
know the first thing about medicine.

955
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:37,333
And don't point that beard at me.
It might go off.

956
01:15:37,505 --> 01:15:41,999
Dr. Steinberg, do you remember
your diagnosis?

957
01:15:42,176 --> 01:15:45,634
Certainly. To begin with,
her pulse is absolutely normal.

958
01:15:45,813 --> 01:15:47,644
- I challenge that.
- Challenge that?

959
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:49,578
- You take her pulse.
- Pulse?

960
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,014
- Take her pulse!
- I don't do any pulse work.

961
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:54,279
I am an acute diagnostician.

962
01:15:54,455 --> 01:15:56,821
Take her pulse. Take her pulse!

963
01:15:57,491 --> 01:16:00,585
Oh, no, no, no. My purse, my purse,
my purse. He has my purse!

964
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:03,127
You must forgive him.
He doesn't spell very well.

965
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:05,959
Oh, dear. Come, gentlemen.
Let us begin.

966
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:10,570
You shouldn't have done that. Now we're
all unsterilized. What's the matter with you?

967
01:16:19,547 --> 01:16:22,141
Well, I must say,
I've seen quicker examinations.

968
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:24,341
Maybe, but you'll never see
a slipperier one.

969
01:16:24,518 --> 01:16:27,146
- Are you ready to proceed?
- We'll proceed immediately.

970
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:30,620
Doctor. And what do you expect
to do next?

971
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:33,521
The next thing I think we should do
is wash our hands.

972
01:16:33,694 --> 01:16:35,889
- You're absolutely right.
- Oh, I've never seen...

973
01:16:41,368 --> 01:16:44,565
- Oh, what is the matter with them?
- I don't know.

974
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:47,571
- What is this? Get away!
- Everything is going to be all right.

975
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:50,539
Nurse, sterilization! Sterilization!

976
01:16:50,711 --> 01:16:53,441
- Are they mad? What is it?
- No, we're not mad.

977
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:56,105
We're just terribly hurt, that's all.

978
01:16:57,017 --> 01:17:00,544
Hey, just a moment. Just put
the gown on, not the nurse, huh?

979
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:02,245
Come here.

980
01:17:03,924 --> 01:17:06,791
- How is it a dame like that never gets sick?
- But I am sick.

981
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:08,952
Doctor, will you pay attention to me?

982
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,963
You'll have to get in line.
There's three orders ahead of you.

983
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:15,398
That poor girl may be out there,
catching her death of cold.

984
01:17:15,569 --> 01:17:18,037
- Same nurse, sterilization.
- Doc, get away from there.

985
01:17:18,205 --> 01:17:21,197
- This is absolutely insane!
- That's what they said about Pasteur.

986
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:24,572
This is ridiculous.
Put the patient in a horizontal position.

987
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:28,242
- Oh, what are you gonna do now?
- Be careful. Be careful.

988
01:17:28,415 --> 01:17:31,145
I don't want to be examined anymore.
Do you hear me?

989
01:17:34,255 --> 01:17:35,483
Doctor, where are you?

990
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:38,489
Oh, my. I want to get down.
You let me down this very moment.

991
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:39,887
Do you hear me?

992
01:17:40,127 --> 01:17:42,095
I'll get you down.

993
01:17:42,263 --> 01:17:44,788
I'll report this to Miss Standish.
You wait and see.

994
01:17:44,965 --> 01:17:48,594
What are you doing?
Get off there. Get off there!

995
01:17:52,072 --> 01:17:54,097
How do you like that, honey?

996
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:57,074
What are you doing? Give me that.

997
01:17:57,244 --> 01:18:00,873
Get away from me. I don't want
to have my head massaged!

998
01:18:01,048 --> 01:18:05,109
In all my life, I haven't seen
such an examination!

999
01:18:05,786 --> 01:18:08,220
But there is one indisputable test.

1000
01:18:08,389 --> 01:18:09,617
- What?
- The x-ray!

1001
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:12,486
- X-ray!
- X-ray!

1002
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:16,460
X-ray! All about the examination!

1003
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:20,122
X-ray! All about the examination!

1004
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:22,963
X-ray! X-ray!

1005
01:18:23,137 --> 01:18:25,071
X-ray!

1006
01:18:25,506 --> 01:18:27,974
That's enough! I will call the police!

1007
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:32,873
I've never gone through
anything like this!

1008
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:07,469
- Well, I certainly messed things up for Judy.
- You messed things up?

1009
01:19:07,648 --> 01:19:10,845
I suppose old Doc Hackenbush
didn't throw a nasty monkey wrench.

1010
01:19:11,018 --> 01:19:12,986
You no throw the monkey wrench.

1011
01:19:13,153 --> 01:19:14,484
I'm the guy that did it.

1012
01:19:14,655 --> 01:19:17,647
Now, listen.
It was nobody's fault but mine.

1013
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,889
I don't want any more arguments.
It was all my fault.

1014
01:19:21,061 --> 01:19:23,029
I think he's right. It was his fault.

1015
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:25,722
Oh, it was my fault, eh?
That's the thanks I get.

1016
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:30,063
I get you the first shower you had in years,
you turn on me like a snake in the grass.

1017
01:19:30,237 --> 01:19:32,933
- Someone's coming.
- The sheriff.

1018
01:19:41,148 --> 01:19:44,584
- Judy.
- Hello, Miss Judy.

1019
01:19:44,752 --> 01:19:47,550
- Hello. Hello.
- You're the prettiest sheriff I've ever seen.

1020
01:19:47,721 --> 01:19:49,848
- Thought I was the sheriff?
- Taking no chances.

1021
01:19:50,024 --> 01:19:51,616
I just brought you these blankets.

1022
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:55,193
I thought it might make it
a little more comfortable living out here.

1023
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:56,590
Get up. Get up.

1024
01:19:56,764 --> 01:19:59,426
Don't worry about our comfort.
We bungled your affairs.

1025
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,862
You did your best, Gil.

1026
01:20:01,035 --> 01:20:02,969
Yes, and our best was none too good.

1027
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:06,163
Tell me, is the water still running
in the examination room?

1028
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:09,241
After tomorrow,
I'm afraid that's Mr. Morgan's worry.

1029
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,435
Morgan, he no got the sanitarium yet.

1030
01:20:11,612 --> 01:20:14,240
A lot of things can happen
before tomorrow.

1031
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:16,815
The sanitarium doesn't matter anymore.

1032
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:20,249
Gil, you were right.
I've been taking things far too seriously.

1033
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:23,686
It's much better this way.
Now I can be free. I won't be tied down.

1034
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:27,657
I can enjoy myself and really laugh.

1035
01:20:27,828 --> 01:20:29,056
Oh, Judy, please.

1036
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:32,721
Don't cry, Miss Judy.
I feel sad, but I laugh.

1037
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,061
I laugh. Stuffy's laughing too. Look.

1038
01:20:35,235 --> 01:20:36,930
Go on and laugh, Stuffy.

1039
01:20:37,504 --> 01:20:41,201
Hey, look. Look at Hackenapuss.
Laugh. Go on, laugh.

1040
01:20:42,076 --> 01:20:43,976
Where did that come from?

1041
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:51,643
It can't be that bad, Judy.

1042
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:58,517
Look at those kids. Laughing, happy.

1043
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:02,924
Come on. You're just a kid.
Laugh. Be happy.

1044
01:31:19,512 --> 01:31:21,412
It's the sheriff.

1045
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:27,419
- Hey, you.
- I ain't done nothing.

1046
01:31:27,587 --> 01:31:29,748
You've got nothing on me.
My skirts are clean.

1047
01:31:29,923 --> 01:31:32,756
Yeah? This letter from Florida
says you're a horse doctor.

1048
01:31:34,361 --> 01:31:35,885
Put them all under arrest.

1049
01:31:36,062 --> 01:31:38,690
They won't run, sheriff,
if you break their legs.

1050
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,758
Get that horse. Get that horse.

1051
01:31:43,803 --> 01:31:45,134
What's wrong with that horse?

1052
01:31:45,305 --> 01:31:48,240
He goes wild every time
he sees Morgan or hears his voice.

1053
01:31:48,408 --> 01:31:50,433
Get him out.

1054
01:31:51,444 --> 01:31:55,312
Hey, come here, you.
Where do you think you're going?

1055
01:32:06,459 --> 01:32:07,949
You can't get away with this.

1056
01:32:12,565 --> 01:32:14,294
Never mind him. Get the horse.

1057
01:32:19,172 --> 01:32:20,901
Why, you!

1058
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:24,173
Nice work, Stuffy.

1059
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:28,003
Stop that horse!
Don't let him get out of here!

1060
01:32:28,181 --> 01:32:29,910
Did you see that horse jump?

1061
01:32:30,083 --> 01:32:33,018
And I'm doing some
pretty fancy jumping myself.

1062
01:32:34,854 --> 01:32:36,481
Let me off this rope!

1063
01:32:36,656 --> 01:32:39,489
I'll throw you all in jail!
Get me down! Get me out of here!

1064
01:32:39,659 --> 01:32:42,685
This is no way to treat the law.
You'll never get away with this!

1065
01:32:42,862 --> 01:32:44,591
I'll get you.

1066
01:32:47,267 --> 01:32:48,495
There he goes.

1067
01:32:51,404 --> 01:32:54,271
If he's headed south,
I'd like to make a reservation.

1068
01:32:54,474 --> 01:32:56,635
Look at that horse.
He cleared the automobile.

1069
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:58,038
I wish I could clear mine.

1070
01:32:58,211 --> 01:33:01,977
Darling, perhaps that's why he
never won a race. He's a jumper.

1071
01:33:02,148 --> 01:33:05,845
Am I a sap. I have a steeplechase horse,
and I don't know it.

1072
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:47,357
We're gonna find that added starter
and see that he doesn't start.

1073
01:33:47,861 --> 01:33:50,455
They're not pulling any fast ones.
Hi Hat's not running.

1074
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:53,895
- But Hi Hat isn't a jumper.
- He was doing plenty of jumping last night.

1075
01:33:54,067 --> 01:33:57,036
- But he can't beat your horse.
- Well, I'm not taking any chances.

1076
01:33:57,203 --> 01:33:59,671
My money is riding on Skee Ball,
and that's not all.

1077
01:33:59,839 --> 01:34:03,206
If Hi Hat wins,
we can kiss the sanitarium goodbye.

1078
01:34:03,376 --> 01:34:06,743
Well, Morgan, you got nothing
to worry about. Hi Hat's not on this track.

1079
01:34:06,913 --> 01:34:09,074
See he doesn't get on.
Put a man at every gate.

1080
01:34:09,249 --> 01:34:12,047
If that nag slips by you,
it means your job.

1081
01:34:26,199 --> 01:34:29,293
Here. Keep me posted.

1082
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:39,143
He's made it!
He's made it!

1083
01:34:39,312 --> 01:34:41,473
Go ahead, Stuffy!
Go to it. Good luck!

1084
01:34:41,648 --> 01:34:44,139
Ride them, cowboy,
or we're heading for the lockup.

1085
01:34:44,317 --> 01:34:45,841
Come on. We get a reserved seat.

1086
01:34:52,592 --> 01:34:54,617
- Gil!
- I got a man on every gate.

1087
01:34:54,794 --> 01:34:58,286
- There's no sign of them.
- See there's no sign of them till after.

1088
01:34:58,464 --> 01:35:01,194
Whoa, Hi Hat!
Whoa, boy! Hi Hat, whoa!

1089
01:35:03,236 --> 01:35:04,464
Hey, what you got in there?

1090
01:35:06,673 --> 01:35:09,574
If you believe in signs, Sherlock,
look at that ambulance.

1091
01:35:12,645 --> 01:35:15,671
- Now, wait a minute, sheriff!
- Don't you start anything, Stewart!

1092
01:35:18,751 --> 01:35:21,948
We'll just put this baby
under lock and key.

1093
01:35:23,523 --> 01:35:26,424
You keep searching for those other mugs.

1094
01:35:33,066 --> 01:35:34,556
Stuffy.

1095
01:35:34,734 --> 01:35:36,668
What's the matter?

1096
01:35:37,537 --> 01:35:39,164
What's happened?

1097
01:35:39,339 --> 01:35:40,829
What?

1098
01:35:43,209 --> 01:35:45,370
Hi Hat's gone!

1099
01:35:46,512 --> 01:35:50,812
- The race is going to start!
- They won't start till we find Hi Hat.

1100
01:35:56,556 --> 01:35:59,423
Now, listen, son,
you're riding this race to win.

1101
01:35:59,592 --> 01:36:02,925
I don't care what you do as long
as the judges don't see you doing it.

1102
01:36:03,096 --> 01:36:06,395
All right, men!
Go to your horses!

1103
01:36:15,541 --> 01:36:17,031
Soap!

1104
01:36:26,219 --> 01:36:30,246
<i>We are sorry for the delay,</i>
<i>but the horses are now coming on the track.</i>

1105
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:32,221
Twenty-five minutes late!

1106
01:36:32,392 --> 01:36:34,417
<i>The horses are parading</i>
<i>past the grandstand.</i>

1107
01:36:34,594 --> 01:36:36,118
<i>Only 11 are headed postward.</i>

1108
01:36:36,296 --> 01:36:38,890
<i>Hi Hat, the added starter, is missing.</i>

1109
01:36:39,065 --> 01:36:41,226
<i>This is the third running...</i>

1110
01:36:53,946 --> 01:36:56,710
Hey, Stuffy! Stuffy!
Did you find him?

1111
01:36:56,883 --> 01:36:58,180
Did you find the ambulance?

1112
01:36:58,351 --> 01:37:00,319
Well, keep on looking.
We know it came in.

1113
01:37:00,486 --> 01:37:02,977
<i>Now that the storm of hats</i>
<i>has subsided...</i>

1114
01:37:03,156 --> 01:37:06,387
<i>... the stewards have ordered</i>
<i>the track cleared for action.</i>

1115
01:37:06,559 --> 01:37:09,392
- Don't stop searching till you find them!
- Here you are, boss.

1116
01:37:09,562 --> 01:37:13,328
- <i>and the horses are back on parade</i>
<i>towards the starting point.</i>

1117
01:37:13,499 --> 01:37:16,593
<i>They're going back now,</i>
<i>up to the starting post.</i>

1118
01:37:16,769 --> 01:37:20,637
<i>And everyone is getting his own hat,</i>
<i>we hope.</i>

1119
01:37:21,307 --> 01:37:24,572
<i>The horses are coming back</i>
<i>to the starter now. They're very fractious.</i>

1120
01:37:24,744 --> 01:37:26,939
<i>They are giving the boys</i>
<i>quite a bit of trouble.</i>

1121
01:37:28,881 --> 01:37:31,509
<i>First Legion is acting very badly...</i>

1122
01:37:31,684 --> 01:37:34,585
Free parking! Here you are!
Free parking!

1123
01:37:35,221 --> 01:37:37,781
Get your free parking!
Come on! Come on, this way!

1124
01:37:37,957 --> 01:37:40,517
<i>They're coming up this time,</i>
<i>almost in an even line.</i>

1125
01:37:40,693 --> 01:37:43,127
<i>The starter has his flag up,</i>
<i>and it looks like</i>...

1126
01:37:43,296 --> 01:37:44,558
<i>Wait a minute!</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

1127
01:37:44,731 --> 01:37:47,291
<i>A horserace or an automobile race?</i>

1128
01:37:48,768 --> 01:37:50,395
Hold those horses!

1129
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:52,162
Hold it! Hold it!

1130
01:37:58,444 --> 01:38:01,311
Plenty of room. Nice fresh parking today.
Right ahead, folks.

1131
01:38:19,165 --> 01:38:21,827
You girls got anything on for tonight?

1132
01:38:22,902 --> 01:38:24,995
Hey! Hey!

1133
01:38:25,171 --> 01:38:27,639
- Get that one!
- Hey, get off!

1134
01:39:03,242 --> 01:39:04,903
Going my way?

1135
01:39:08,381 --> 01:39:10,281
Get them out!
Get them out of here!

1136
01:39:14,253 --> 01:39:16,084
Hey, Stuffy, did you find Hi Hat?

1137
01:39:16,255 --> 01:39:18,655
Well, keep looking.
He must be around somewheres.

1138
01:39:30,336 --> 01:39:33,794
Get that horse out of there!
There's been a terrible wreck!

1139
01:39:34,574 --> 01:39:36,974
Come on! Hurry up! Help me!

1140
01:39:54,193 --> 01:39:57,993
- Come on, we've got no time to lose.
- Is she alive?

1141
01:40:03,135 --> 01:40:06,366
- Get going, sheriff, I'll take care of her.
- All right.

1142
01:40:17,083 --> 01:40:19,278
- <i>Well, here we are again.</i>
- Come on!

1143
01:40:19,452 --> 01:40:22,421
Get them off
before something else happens.

1144
01:40:22,588 --> 01:40:25,853
- Turn that horse around.
- <i>It looks like he's going to send them away.</i>

1145
01:40:26,025 --> 01:40:27,993
- <i>Yes, yes...</i>
- Now, easy, easy.

1146
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,560
<i>And now they go!</i>

1147
01:40:33,966 --> 01:40:36,093
- At last.
- <i>Flying Demon is third.</i>

1148
01:40:36,269 --> 01:40:38,635
<i>Sun Helmet is fourth, and Green Goddess.</i>

1149
01:40:38,804 --> 01:40:41,364
<i>Skee Ball showing the way</i>
<i>in the center of the track...</i>

1150
01:40:41,541 --> 01:40:44,533
<i>... by two lengths.</i>
<i>Sun Helmet is second.</i>

1151
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:47,736
<i>Green Goddess is third,</i>
<i>and Flying Demon is fourth.</i>

1152
01:40:48,347 --> 01:40:52,545
<i>Now they're going around the first turn</i>
<i>with Skee Ball in front by two lengths.</i>

1153
01:40:52,718 --> 01:40:54,618
<i>First Legion is second by a head.</i>

1154
01:40:54,787 --> 01:40:56,186
<i>Wait a minute!</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

1155
01:40:56,822 --> 01:40:58,016
What is...?
What happened?

1156
01:40:58,691 --> 01:41:01,125
Get me the riot squad!

1157
01:41:01,494 --> 01:41:04,520
- Oh, Mr. Morgan, don't get excited.
- I'm not excited! Shut up!

1158
01:41:07,934 --> 01:41:09,561
<i>Quiet, please. Your attention.</i>

1159
01:41:10,703 --> 01:41:13,137
<i>Quiet, please! Your attention!</i>

1160
01:41:13,306 --> 01:41:14,671
Stuffy!

1161
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:18,401
<i>The stewards have ruled this</i>
<i>a false start...</i>

1162
01:41:19,011 --> 01:41:22,708
<i>... and have ordered the horses back</i>
<i>to the starting post.</i>

1163
01:41:23,049 --> 01:41:25,779
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>if you will all...</i>

1164
01:41:25,952 --> 01:41:27,510
Stuffy, scram!

1165
01:41:27,687 --> 01:41:30,781
<i>Who knows, we may yet have</i>
<i>a horserace this afternoon.</i>

1166
01:41:30,957 --> 01:41:34,393
<i>Horses are back at the starting point.</i>

1167
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:39,190
<i>And now the boys are turning them about.</i>
<i>They're very nervous, very fractious.</i>

1168
01:41:39,365 --> 01:41:41,162
<i>They're having quite a bit of trouble.</i>

1169
01:41:41,334 --> 01:41:42,892
Get that wagon off of here!

1170
01:42:04,256 --> 01:42:05,883
Get off!

1171
01:42:06,525 --> 01:42:08,356
Get it off!

1172
01:42:11,063 --> 01:42:13,759
Hi Hat, he got him away from me!
I don't know where he is!

1173
01:42:13,933 --> 01:42:15,798
What do you think that is, stupid?

1174
01:42:17,837 --> 01:42:19,737
- Number 7!
- Somebody's gonna pay for this!

1175
01:42:19,905 --> 01:42:21,133
That's Hi Hat!

1176
01:42:21,974 --> 01:42:25,569
<i>They're coming up to the start this time,</i>
<i>and the starter has his flag raised.</i>

1177
01:42:25,745 --> 01:42:27,610
<i>And now they go!</i>

1178
01:42:28,514 --> 01:42:30,812
<i>Here comes Hi Hat!</i>

1179
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:32,712
<i>And he's in the race!</i>

1180
01:42:32,885 --> 01:42:34,318
Come on! Hoof it!

1181
01:42:34,487 --> 01:42:37,479
<i>Skee Ball going to the front,</i>
<i>First Legion is second...</i>

1182
01:42:37,657 --> 01:42:40,421
<i>... Flying Demon is third,</i>
<i>Sun Helmet is fourth...</i>

1183
01:42:40,593 --> 01:42:41,992
<i>... and Green Goddess is fifth.</i>

1184
01:42:42,161 --> 01:42:44,026
<i>Now there goes Hi Hat into contention.</i>

1185
01:42:44,196 --> 01:42:46,790
<i>He's picking up the field,</i>
<i>he's moving up between horses.</i>

1186
01:42:46,966 --> 01:42:49,764
<i>And look at him go!</i>
<i>He's moving up there at the leader.</i>

1187
01:42:49,935 --> 01:42:52,597
<i>And Skee Ball's still in front,</i>
<i>pressing into second.</i>

1188
01:42:52,772 --> 01:42:56,401
<i>But here comes Hi Hat between horses,</i>
<i>and now he's challenging the leader.</i>

1189
01:42:58,377 --> 01:43:00,436
<i>Skee Ball in front</i>
<i>by a length and one half.</i>

1190
01:43:00,613 --> 01:43:02,945
<i>Hi Hat is second by three-quarters</i>
<i>of a length.</i>

1191
01:43:03,115 --> 01:43:05,345
<i>First Legion is third</i>
<i>by a length and one half...</i>

1192
01:43:05,518 --> 01:43:08,487
<i>... and Flying Demon is fourth.</i>
<i>Now Skee Ball is going out a bit.</i>

1193
01:43:08,654 --> 01:43:12,283
<i>And they're coming to the first fence now,</i>
<i>and Skee Ball takes it...</i>

1194
01:43:12,458 --> 01:43:14,824
<i>... but Hi Hat refuses.</i>
<i>He's turning back.</i>

1195
01:43:14,994 --> 01:43:18,555
<i>But wait a minute, wait a minute.</i>
<i>He's going to try it. There he goes.</i>

1196
01:43:18,731 --> 01:43:20,961
<i>He's going after it this time,</i>
<i>and he's over!</i>

1197
01:43:21,133 --> 01:43:23,124
Oh, your idea worked, Judy!

1198
01:43:23,302 --> 01:43:26,703
<i>Flying Demon is third by three-quarters</i>
<i>of a length. Sun Helmet in fourth.</i>

1199
01:43:26,872 --> 01:43:29,238
Oh, he's lost Morgan's picture!

1200
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:32,134
<i>And he's going up on the outside</i>
<i>this time...</i>

1201
01:43:32,311 --> 01:43:36,304
<i>... and here he is at the leader! It's Skee Ball</i>
<i>in front. Here comes Skee Ball...</i>

1202
01:43:36,482 --> 01:43:38,712
Can you shout like Morgan?

1203
01:43:38,884 --> 01:43:41,079
No, but Morgan can.

1204
01:43:42,021 --> 01:43:44,683
- <i>third by three-quarters of a length.</i>
<i>Skee Ball on the outside.</i>

1205
01:43:44,857 --> 01:43:48,759
<i>And Hi Hat on the rail,</i>
<i>with Flying Demon third</i>...

1206
01:43:49,729 --> 01:43:51,663
Something's happened
to the loudspeaker.

1207
01:44:04,977 --> 01:44:07,207
- Let me take a look.
- Give me those glasses...

1208
01:44:07,379 --> 01:44:08,641
<i>It's you! Officer!</i>

1209
01:44:14,954 --> 01:44:17,422
You take care of Judy,
and I'll take care of Morgan.

1210
01:44:37,042 --> 01:44:39,567
I hope the judges didn't see that.

1211
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:47,876
Mind telling the radio audience
what a heel you are?

1212
01:44:48,053 --> 01:44:49,850
Come back later.
I've had enough of y...

1213
01:44:50,389 --> 01:44:53,790
<i>If the police can't handle you,</i>
<i>I'll handle you myself!</i>

1214
01:44:54,627 --> 01:44:56,857
Keep that man away from me,
do you understand?

1215
01:45:02,768 --> 01:45:04,963
Get down there! And stay there!

1216
01:45:05,137 --> 01:45:07,105
And see that
I'm not disturbed again today!

1217
01:45:11,811 --> 01:45:13,073
Get out of here!

1218
01:45:13,245 --> 01:45:14,644
<i>Get out of here!</i>

1219
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:40,968
Oh, we've got him!
He won't get away this time!

1220
01:45:46,078 --> 01:45:48,342
- They're both down!
- Stuffy's down!

1221
01:45:58,624 --> 01:46:00,182
Skee Ball's in the lead!

1222
01:46:15,374 --> 01:46:16,932
- Smell this.
- Oh, get away!

1223
01:46:17,109 --> 01:46:19,475
<i>I don't wanna smell anything!</i>
<i>Get him out of here!</i>

1224
01:46:19,645 --> 01:46:22,443
<i>Come on! How many men</i>
<i>does it take to do this?</i>

1225
01:46:22,615 --> 01:46:25,277
Come on, Skee Ball!
Come on, Skee Ball!

1226
01:46:25,451 --> 01:46:27,214
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

1227
01:46:32,424 --> 01:46:36,485
Skee Ball wins! He wins at everything!
Let me out of here.

1228
01:46:40,032 --> 01:46:43,661
Okay, sheriff, what are your rates
for a cell with southern exposure?

1229
01:46:43,836 --> 01:46:47,067
Gil, Hi Hat couldn't have tried harder.

1230
01:46:47,239 --> 01:46:48,672
We were just unlucky.

1231
01:46:53,379 --> 01:46:56,678
Great race, Skee Ball.
Great race, Skee Ball.

1232
01:46:59,885 --> 01:47:02,752
Get out of here!
Get him out of here!

1233
01:47:14,033 --> 01:47:16,729
- Why, it's number 7!
- Hi Hat's the winner.

1234
01:47:19,905 --> 01:47:23,568
- Hi Hat wins! Cancel that reservation.
- It's Hi Hat!

1235
01:47:23,742 --> 01:47:26,711
Gil, come on! Come on,
I want to put the wreath on the winner!

1236
01:47:26,879 --> 01:47:29,939
One more yell out of you,
and he'd have jumped over the grandstand.

1237
01:47:30,115 --> 01:47:31,912
- Stuffy!
- Stuffy, you were wonderful!

1238
01:47:32,084 --> 01:47:34,314
- Oh, boy!
- I haven't seen so much mudslinging...

1239
01:47:34,486 --> 01:47:36,681
...since the last election.

1240
01:47:40,559 --> 01:47:43,323
Come on, boy! Hi Hat!

1241
01:47:45,631 --> 01:47:47,462
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

1242
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,559
Hallelujah!

1243
01:48:23,802 --> 01:48:25,793
Emily, I have a little confession to make.

1244
01:48:25,971 --> 01:48:27,632
I really am a horse doctor.

1245
01:48:27,806 --> 01:48:30,832
But marry me,
and I'll never look at any other horse.

1246
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:15,409
