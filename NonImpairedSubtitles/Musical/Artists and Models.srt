00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:28,558
<i>You can trace the mystery
of ancient history</i>

4
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:31,958
<i>Through art artists and their models</i>

5
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:35,350
<i>You can comb through
the Rome Coliseum</i>

6
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:39,025
<i>In the rear of your nearest museum</i>

7
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:40,949
<i>There's the Mona Lisa</i>

8
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:42,607
<i>The tower of Pisa</i>

9
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:45,907
<i>A cowhand's daughter out in Texas</i>

10
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:49,007
<i>And there's modern art to see</i>

11
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:52,940
<i>That makes you wonder
what the heck it's meant to be</i>

12
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:54,737
<i>On the streets of Montmartre</i>

13
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,497
<i>There's a Frenchy kind of art</i>

14
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:59,894
<i>That is strictly for the tourists
from the sticks</i>

15
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:03,340
<i>And those wise Greenwich guys
really open up your eyes</i>

16
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:06,861
<i>Painting portraits
of their pretty little chicks</i>

17
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,676
<i>So to each creator and imitator</i>

18
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:13,774
<i>Who daubs and dabbles
with the brushes</i>

19
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,733
<i>To the guys that draw the bunnies</i>

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,653
<i>For the Sunday morning funnies</i>

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,012
<i>And the brighten up the world today</i>

22
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:22,933
<i>And to every girl that poses</i>

23
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:24,656
<i>To every Grandma Moses</i>

24
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,759
<i>We'd like to tip the old beret</i>

25
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:46,131
<i>The art of artists and their models</i>

26
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:53,227
Hey, Todd. Rick Todd.

27
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:54,611
Yes, sir, Mr. Kelly.

28
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:57,809
Mr. Trim is here for a demonstration.
You ready?

29
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,293
Right away, sir, soon as
Eugene tunrs on the smoke machine.

30
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,148
Hey, Eugene.

31
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:07,759
Hey, get up.
The boss and Trim are here. Get up.

32
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:10,317
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait.
I'm on the third murder.

33
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:13,008
Looks like the Bat Lady's gonna
blow one of the Rat Man's heads off.

34
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:16,111
If I end up reading the want ads,
one of your heads will blow off.

35
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:17,775
Now come on. Get going.

36
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:19,220
Okay, okay.

37
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:36,723
Oh, Bat Lady! My Bat Lady!

38
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,131
Rick! Rick!

39
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,443
Got me.

40
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:45,169
Rick! Rick! Where's Rick?

41
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,699
What's holding you up, Todd?

42
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:48,716
Starting right away, Mr. Kelly.

43
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,634
All right, get going.
Kelly wants to see it work.

44
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:53,295
tell him to come in here.

45
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:54,642
Eugie!

46
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:01,906
Rick! Rick! Rick!

47
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:04,302
Eugie, boy, you all right?

48
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,367
You need air.

49
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,969
What's the matter, Kelly?
She having trouble with her lungs?

50
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:22,227
Look, I'll handle the smoke,
and you attach the tube. Come on.

51
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:30,931
Okay.

52
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,932
- Let her go.
- Okay.

53
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:41,200
Wait! My Bat Lady!

54
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,998
She's not smoking, she's spitting.

55
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,850
Hey, what's going on here?

56
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:50,802
Oh, not a thing, Officer.

57
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:53,228
We're just demonstrating a new sign.

58
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,733
Mr. Kelly, watch it.

59
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,228
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:17,973
Hey, Rick, I'm all set...

61
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:21,487
Rick? Rick.

62
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:26,415
Ricky-Ricky. Ricky-Ricky.

63
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,589
- Yo, Rick!
- What?

64
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:34,100
Oh. I'm all set to make your dinner.
How would you like your beans?

65
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:36,108
Preferably out of the can.

66
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:39,026
No, I mean, how would you like
to have your beans done?

67
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:41,014
Why don't you stuff them?

68
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:45,837
No. broil them, medium-rare,
a little mushroom sauce over them.

69
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:49,259
Beans. Do you know
why all we got eat is beans?

70
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:52,629
'Cause every time I find a job,
you lose it.

71
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:55,473
Bat Lady.

72
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:58,225
You and your crummy comic books.
That's all you ever think about.

73
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:00,115
No, sometimes I think about girls, too.

74
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:03,084
I think about girls, too.
That's about all, just think about them.

75
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,459
But can I afford to take them out? No.

76
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:08,177
You Know, on account of you,
I'm going to be an old maid.

77
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:11,403
Do you remember why we left
Steubendale and came to New York?

78
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,333
Yeah, because you promised
to marry Ophelia Jackson

79
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:15,984
- and her father found out...
- No, that wasn't the only reason.

80
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:17,941
Oh, it was that other girl,
Mabeline Smithers.

81
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,697
- Her brother thought...
- No. Come here. Come here.

82
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,613
We came to New York
so I could make money to study art,

83
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,237
so I could become a famous painter,

84
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:27,190
so I colud be hung in art galleries,
so I could be hung in museums.

85
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,880
Yeah, and you almost got hung
in Steubendale.

86
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:30,226
Forget Steubendale.

87
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,693
Try and remember
why you came to New York.

88
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,804
I...

89
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,257
Why'd I come to New York?

90
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:46,002
I didn't... No. Wait.

91
00:05:46,102 --> 00:05:47,629
Oh, yeah.

92
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:48,782
That's right.

93
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,293
You were going to be a writer.

94
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,172
You were gonna write children's books
about Freddie the Field Mouse,

95
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,212
Goosey the Goose, right?

96
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,366
What have you done?

97
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,056
Nothing.
Nothing except read comic books.

98
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,362
You also lose our jobs
on account of comic books.

99
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,055
You keep me awake every night
with your bad dreams

100
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,850
on account of comic books.

101
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:08,115
You know I've decided to do, pal?

102
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:11,990
- Be pals with me?
- Yeah, we'll be pallies.

103
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,118
I'm gonna write you a letter
at least once every month.

104
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:17,808
- And I'll answer you.
- Good. Now go get supper.

105
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:29,972
Write to me?

106
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:47,476
Look, junior,
a divorce is the only way out.

107
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,179
We've been together too long.

108
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,693
Ever since we were Tenderfeet
in the Kangaroo Patrol.

109
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,557
You can have the whole apartment,

110
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,850
full custody of the beans
and the Bat Lady.

111
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:08,017
Okay?

112
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,767
Not so hard.

113
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,162
Thank you.

114
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:26,739
I hope the bubbles
didn't tickle your nosey.

115
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:29,009
No, just my nose-tril.

116
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,044
- Your nose-tril?
- Yes, just a little tickle.

117
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,346
Hey, you think you have enough there
if I want a little slug?

118
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:38,293
Oh, sure, Rick.
I have everything when I'm pretending.

119
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,732
You see, I'm just making believe

120
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,408
that we're both very rich,
wealthy millionaires with money.

121
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,503
And you're a very, very famous artist,
and I'm a very famous writer, see?

122
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:50,061
And I'm just making believe
that we're not even eating beans,

123
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,792
just a big, juicy steak.

124
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:53,519
Would you like a piece
of my big, juicy steak?

125
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:55,186
Oh, no. No, no. I'm up to here.

126
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:57,135
I think I had too much vichyssoise.

127
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:59,693
That's the idea, Rick.
You have to pretend.

128
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,903
See? 'Cause when you pretend,
then your dreams come true.

129
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:03,980
It's just like wishing. Watch.

130
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:12,879
Damp.

131
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,855
Damp.

132
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:33,163
Do that once more.

133
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:39,916
You see, you're not concentrating, Rick.

134
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:42,259
You must pretend
and concentrate. Watch.

135
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:56,531
<i>Although you're stuck beans</i>

136
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,702
<i>There's money in your jeans</i>

137
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:03,661
<i>When you pretend</i>

138
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:06,959
<i>The wolf that's at your door</i>

139
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:09,550
<i>Is not there anymore</i>

140
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:14,094
<i>When you pretend</i>

141
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:18,898
<i>There's nothing you can't be</i>

142
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:24,523
<i>Just wish and see</i>

143
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,620
<i>The world's your cup of tea</i>

144
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:35,340
<i>Some dish, says me</i>

145
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:38,741
<i>The happiness you find</i>

146
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:41,140
<i>Is all a state of mind</i>

147
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:46,573
<i>That's true, my friend</i>

148
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:51,599
<i>And life is filled with happy endings</i>

149
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:56,688
<i>When you pretend</i>

150
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:01,392
You sold me, junior.
Tomorrow I'm gonna pretend

151
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:04,144
I don't have to tour
the employment agencies, okay?

152
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:05,522
Oh, that's wonderful.

153
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:08,143
And I'll make a real hard wish
that we get a big, juicy steak

154
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:09,937
so you'll have the strength.

155
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,772
<i>Although you're stuck with beans</i>

156
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,074
<i>There's money in your jeans</i>

157
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:21,876
<i>When you pretend</i>

158
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,243
<i>The wolf that's at your door</i>

159
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,676
<i>Is not there anymore</i>

160
00:12:26,774 --> 00:12:31,280
<i>When you pretend</i>

161
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:35,790
<i>There's nothing you can't be</i>

162
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:40,466
<i>Just wish and see</i>

163
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:45,070
<i>The world's your cup of tea</i>

164
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:49,899
<i>Some dish, says me</i>

165
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:53,171
<i>The happiness you find</i>

166
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,158
<i>Is all a state of mind</i>

167
00:12:55,253 --> 00:13:00,272
<i>That's true, my friend</i>

168
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:04,781
<i>And life is filled with happy endings</i>

169
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:09,229
<i>When you pretend</i>

170
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:17,519
You are a riot. You're a real riot.

171
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:20,142
You expect me to eat that slop?

172
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:23,279
So don't eat. You're fat enough anyway.

173
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,699
You know what I'm gonna do?

174
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,878
Do you know what I'm gonna do?

175
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:33,172
I'm gonna take that lousy steak
And I'm gonna throw it out the window.

176
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:58,961
Oh, good steak.

177
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:05,170
Oh, Rick, come on out.
We got steak for supper.

178
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,277
Now, why don't you lay off of that stuff?

179
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:10,991
- Don't you want a piece of steak?
- For last time, no.

180
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:14,449
Pretend you're eating it all by yourself.

181
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,704
- Okay, if you say so.
- I say so.

182
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,921
No, impossible.

183
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:30,068
Impossible!

184
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:32,494
<i>The happiness you find</i>

185
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:34,256
<i>Is all a state of mind</i>

186
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:38,613
<i>That's true, my friend</i>

187
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,572
<i>And life is filled with happy endings</i>

188
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:46,539
<i>When you pretend</i>

189
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,237
Oh, pardon me.

190
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:24,204
Out of the wild blue-yellow yonder,
with tail full of jet propulsion,

191
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:27,724
comes Vincent, Vincent the Vulture.

192
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,173
Vincent the Vulture,
defender of truth and liberty

193
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,612
and member of Audubon Society.

194
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:40,558
He is half-boy, half-man, half-bird,
with feathers growing out of every pore.

195
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:43,891
He is flying
to his interplanetary space station,

196
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,787
trying to escape Zuba,
Zuba the Magnificent.

197
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:52,334
But Vincent is very aware
that behind those inviting red lips,

198
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:57,227
behind those purple boudoir eyes,
and behind that cleaving cleavage

199
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:59,822
lies a diabolical soul.

200
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,228
Zuba is trying to get away from Vincent

201
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:04,114
his secret power formula,

202
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:10,706
X34 minus 5R1 plus 6-X36.

203
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:15,411
Vincent is hit. He is hit.

204
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,787
Zuba fires her death-dealing,
atomic-atomising pivot gun.

205
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,208
The gore is oozing out of his tail.

206
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,539
Will Vincent the Vulture
ever live to fly back

207
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:35,948
to his homogenised space station
high above the Milky way?

208
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:40,853
Zuba!

209
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:55,571
And out in space,
Vincent pulls her close,

210
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:59,215
but Zuba fights against the embrace
of Vincent the Vulture.

211
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:03,693
She is allergic to his feathers.
Her teeth snarl, gleaming white.

212
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:07,692
He tears her clothes and exposes
her two big, round shoulders.

213
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:09,969
Vincent closes in on her.

214
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:18,323
Eugene. Eugene!

215
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:21,201
Get me a lawyer.

216
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,086
Oh.

217
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:24,493
Coming.

218
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:26,828
You'd better.

219
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,130
Oh.

220
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,107
- Oh, it's you, Mrs. Muldoon.
- It ain't Gina Lollobrigida.

221
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:44,075
Listen, Eugene, you've been flapping
your gums in your sleep again,

222
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:47,051
and my new tenant
in 4A is complaining.

223
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:50,540
Yeah, well, I'm awfully sorry,
Mrs. Muldoon, but I'll apologise to him.

224
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,140
He is a her.

225
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:55,312
She's a successful artist,
and you stay away from 4A.

226
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:58,131
I don't want her thinking
that she's moved into skid row.

227
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,891
You mean she's an artist
who makes money?

228
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:05,680
Paid her rent in advance.

229
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:10,092
Remember, any more noise, and you're
gonna be using the kerb for a pillow.

230
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:12,532
Oh, all right, Mrs. Muldoon, I'll watch it.

231
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:16,404
From now on, I'll sleep with Band-Aids
over my mouth. Band-Aids.

232
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:19,603
Band-Aids on my...

233
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,021
Successful artist.

234
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:27,534
Maybe if she saw
some of Rick's paintings...

235
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:05,808
There's someone at the door, Abby.

236
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:07,507
There's someone at the door.

237
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,362
What goes on at this place?

238
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,698
First the banshee downstairs,
and now something else.

239
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:14,442
I don't know how I let you
talk me into moving here.

240
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,135
Because it's Greenwich Village
and it's romantic.

241
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:20,401
Besides, my horoscope said
this is where I'd meet my true love.

242
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,869
Hold it. Finish this pose.

243
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:27,566
What'll I say now?

244
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,661
Good evening.
My name is Eugene Fullstack,

245
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,871
and I hear
you're a very successful artist.

246
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,340
And thought maybe that you could
meet my good friend Rick Todd,

247
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,259
who I believe is one
of the better painters.

248
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,779
And I thought if someone so successful
like you would talk to him,

249
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:41,867
you might just cheer him up.

250
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:44,178
You see, he's getting very discouraged
just hanging around.

251
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:45,292
So am I.

252
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:46,859
Good evening.
My mame is Eugene Fullstack,

253
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,104
and I thought...

254
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,613
Rick! Rick!

255
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,028
Rick! Rick! Rick!

256
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:08,523
Rick, I just saw the Bat Lady
upstairs, Rick! Wake up!

257
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:10,636
Honest, I saw her for real
on the fourth floor.

258
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:13,610
Rick, I'm trying to tell you something.
On the fourth floor...

259
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:15,857
- Help! Help! Police!
- Oh, I'm sorry. No, lady, don't yell.

260
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:17,779
- It's a mistake . No, lady, don't yell.
- Help!

261
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,852
- Help! Help! Police!
- No, lady, please.

262
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,363
- No yelling. Lady...
- Help! Help!

263
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:23,185
- I'm sorry, lady.
- Police! Help!

264
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:26,035
Help! Police!

265
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,555
The Bat Lady, the fat lady!

266
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:32,875
Rick! Rick!

267
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:34,768
Rick, Rick.

268
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,258
- Rick, I saw the Bat Lady uptairs.
- What?

269
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,089
- I saw the Bat Lady upstairs.
- Sure you did.

270
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:40,596
She made a three-points landing
on the roof. Sure.

271
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:41,970
No, I'm not kidding.
This is honest, really.

272
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:43,084
She's upstairs on the fourth floor.

273
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:44,596
Just take it easy.
Look, will you go back to sleep?

274
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:45,620
No, this is serious, Rick.

275
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:47,605
Honest, the Bat Lady scared me
and I ran into the fat lady.

276
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:49,676
What Bat Lady, fat lady?
What are you, crazy?

277
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,058
No, I'm not crazy. This really happened.

278
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:52,751
Let me explain.
You see, upstairs is the Bat Lady.

279
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,097
I ran up to the Bat Lady
and she scared me,

280
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:55,757
- so I ran downstairs to the fat lady.
- Sure.

281
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:56,973
She scared me
worse than the Bat Lady, see?

282
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:58,026
- Yeah, sure.
- I was running downstairs

283
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,115
- to tell you about the Bat Lady.
- Eugie.

284
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:00,880
But the Bat Lady caught me,
the Bat Lady scared me.

285
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:01,963
- The fat lady was downstairs.
- Eugie!

286
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,444
I ran downstairs
to tell you about the fat lady.

287
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,068
You're just having
one of your bad dreams.

288
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:06,384
Now, will you get back to sleep?

289
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:07,500
No, really. I saw her out in the hall.

290
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:08,587
She's got things
sticking out of her head.

291
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:09,740
She's a crazy-looking person.

292
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:11,275
Eugie, you got things
sticking in your head.

293
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,625
Now, look, we'll see.
Come on, I'll show you.

294
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:14,319
No, no, they're out there.
I'm telling you, I saw it.

295
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,469
- Come here.
- I'm telling you, Rick.

296
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:17,940
For real, there's someone out there.
I keep telling you.

297
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:19,085
All right. Be a brave boy.

298
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,815
Open the door and show me.
There's no one out there.

299
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:21,866
No, I'm scared, Rick.

300
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:23,119
Scared? I thought
you loved the Bat Lady.

301
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:24,236
I am, but I'm scared of the fat lady.

302
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:25,618
There's no fat lady, there's no Bat Lady.

303
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,107
Now open the door
so we can both go back to bed.

304
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:31,983
I told you she was out there.

305
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:33,395
- The Bat Lady?
- No, the fat lady.

306
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:36,789
Oh, you're flipping your butch.
I'll show you there's no one out there.

307
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,099
- She's out there.
- The Bat Lady?

308
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:47,539
No, the fat lady.

309
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:06,094
Abby.

310
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:09,044
Abby, look.
According to my chart, it's happened.

311
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:11,563
Tonight my moon is full
and square to Jupiter.

312
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:14,986
Uranus is square to Sagittarius,
Mars is square to Venus.

313
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:17,679
I saw him for the first time tonight.

314
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:20,781
He's the one, my true love.

315
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:22,795
Oh, Bessie, no.

316
00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:25,203
That square's your true love?

317
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:28,498
- You tear up that horoscope.
- The stars don't lie.

318
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:33,770
- But isn't awful about our children?
- Your children?

319
00:22:33,878 --> 00:22:35,983
Shouldn't you be introduced first?

320
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:37,678
Well, suppose they look like him?

321
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:39,723
Rent them out for Halloween.

322
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:50,004
He's not very handsome.

323
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:54,987
But he is kind of cute.
You know, the safe kind.

324
00:22:55,094 --> 00:22:58,705
The safe kind? What's safe in pants?

325
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:00,114
Oh, the not-so-handsome kind.

326
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,423
They make the best husbands,
you know.

327
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,118
Other women don't want them.

328
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:06,604
Listen, the man that another woman
doesn't want doesn't exist.

329
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,498
Now, lights out, girl.

330
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:11,597
I've got an early appointment
with my publisher in the morning.

331
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:14,412
Suffering catfish!

332
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:19,437
You're supposed to be an artist
and a writer of children's stories.

333
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,713
Well, you're not an artist
and you're not a writer,

334
00:23:21,813 --> 00:23:24,017
not by my wife's standards.

335
00:23:24,117 --> 00:23:26,059
I knew I'd make the grade.

336
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:30,126
Sixty-two pages of drawings
and no blood?

337
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:31,855
Not even an itsy-bitsy nosebleed?

338
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,299
But, suffering catfish,

339
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:36,300
do you call this
a Murdock book for kiddies?

340
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:39,918
With no stranglings,
With no decapitation?

341
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:41,265
Where are they?

342
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:43,700
I must have lost my head,
because this is where I get off.

343
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,226
Now, wait a minute, Abigail.
Abigail, please.

344
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,315
Please, now, sit down. Relax.

345
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:48,625
Let me explain something to you, honey.
Now, come on. Now, listen.

346
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:51,343
Well, I'm a little bit on the edgy-wedgy
this morning.

347
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:52,852
My wife's been giving me the knife.

348
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,884
And if sales don't pick up,
she's gonna give me the ax.

349
00:23:56,373 --> 00:24:01,010
You wouldn't want old Murdie boy
out of a job, now, would you?

350
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,467
I'm not Cupid, Mr. Murdock.

351
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:05,166
If you can't wear the pants
in your family...

352
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:06,698
The pants?

353
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,024
The pants!

354
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:14,322
Since Edith and I are separated,
it's a wonder I've got my striped shorts.

355
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:16,210
Look at the competition
we're getting in television.

356
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:18,862
You realise, Abigail, night before last,

357
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:24,268
I counted 13 murders, four stabbings,
nine suffocations and six poisonings

358
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:26,894
on two channels in one hour.

359
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:30,252
And another thing...
Just you think of this, girl.

360
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,691
When they're able to show that blood,

361
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:37,426
that red blood gushing out
of open wounds in spectacular colour...

362
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:42,195
And they'll get it free,
right into their living rooms there,

363
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:43,754
free, right into their living rooms,

364
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:47,658
sponsored by
those friendly used-car dealers.

365
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:50,765
Sorry, Mr. Murdock.
Get yourself another artist,

366
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,974
someone who can bleed
to suit your wife.

367
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:54,736
Please, let's talk this over again.

368
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:57,903
Now, come on.
Now, please, Abigail, don't leave me.

369
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:01,136
Oh, miss, I'm Rick Todd
and this is Eugene Fullstack,

370
00:25:01,237 --> 00:25:03,725
and the landlady said
we'd find Abigail Parker here.

371
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:05,553
She's busy now in surgery.

372
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:06,995
Good. We'll wait. Sit down.

373
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:08,948
Look, If Miss Parker
doesn't back up your statement,

374
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:10,736
we're back on the asphalt,
you know that?

375
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:13,226
Unless you can prove you weren't
trying to make time with the fat lady.

376
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,860
What "make time"?
Who's got that kind of time?

377
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:18,227
I told you, Rick, I'm still all excited
about when I saw the Bat Lady.

378
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:23,626
- You like the Bat Lady?
- Oh, Yeah.

379
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:26,675
And I just found out she's for real.

380
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:28,564
Sure she is.

381
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,888
She's a living doll.

382
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,120
- Do you... Do you know her?
- Intimately.

383
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,514
In fact, she's even more darling.
in person.

384
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,020
No fooling.

385
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:44,305
Boy, those lovely lips.

386
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:47,892
Those red, inviting, luscious lips,

387
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:51,338
like two strips of liver
gleaming in the moonlight.

388
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:56,043
What's wrong with your mouth?
Is it sore?

389
00:25:57,525 --> 00:25:59,892
No. I just thought
I felt a pucker coming on.

390
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:05,172
Oh. And her eyes,
those magnificent eyes.

391
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:09,004
What's wrong with yours?
You got astigmatism?

392
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,768
No. I was just uncrossing them.

393
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,236
Hey, they really pay money
for this kind of drawing?

394
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,373
What's the matter
with Abigail's drawing?

395
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:16,939
Oh, bad, very bad.

396
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:19,347
Look at all that.
Look, the legs, they look like arms.

397
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,714
You should see the Bat Lady's legs.

398
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:27,280
- Oh, miss?
- Yes?

399
00:26:27,381 --> 00:26:29,104
Your seam's crooked.

400
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:32,882
Thanks heaps.

401
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:38,865
- Yes, Mr. Murdock?
- Bessie, I need an artist.

402
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:43,924
Get me the names of the best artists
that we have on file.

403
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:46,029
Yes, sir. I'll bring you the folder.

404
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,140
Did you hear what he said?
He needs an artist.

405
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,513
- Did you hear him?
- I'm way ahead of you, junior.

406
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,500
Look, when Bessie comes out,
you grab her and you kiss her.

407
00:26:56,597 --> 00:26:59,314
- Who wants to kiss her?
- You do. I gotta get into that folder, boy.

408
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:00,558
Yeah, but I got a blister on my lip.

409
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,082
Look, if you could pretend
that beans are T-bone steaks,

410
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,782
you can pretend that she's the Bat Lady.

411
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:05,900
She might fight you, but you remember,

412
00:27:06,005 --> 00:27:08,307
you're gonna do this
for your old Kangaroo Patrol pal.

413
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:09,866
Yeah. Pouches forever.

414
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:12,002
- Okay, kiss, kiss.
Remember, kiss, kiss.

415
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:12,690
- Yeah.

416
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:17,165
Will you watch my switchboard, please?

417
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,728
I won't only watch your switchboard,

418
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:21,804
but I'll buzz your lights
and tangle your plugs.

419
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:24,211
- Come here, baby.
- Not with your friend watching.

420
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,472
- Oh, he's gone.
- What are we waiting for?

421
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:30,191
- My Sagittarius is rising. Hang on, boy.
- No, you're supposed to fight me.

422
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:33,043
- You're supposed to fight me. No!
- No, no, no. Don't fight.

423
00:27:45,685 --> 00:27:48,270
Easy, gal,
he just got some new bearings.

424
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:50,388
Here, you dropped this.

425
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:56,148
The stars were right.
My Jupiter's jumping.

426
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:59,538
Now, stout, fella.
I think we're getting somewhere now.

427
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,492
Yeah, and I think
my blister's getting a blister.

428
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:04,339
Look, it's smart business
to get in good with the boss' secretary.

429
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:06,062
Yeah? Why don't you
go into business for yourself?

430
00:28:06,165 --> 00:28:08,270
Put more men on the job.

431
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:10,762
Here she comes. Grab her, kiss her.
Kiss her again!

432
00:28:19,637 --> 00:28:22,157
- What do you think you're doing?
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry, ma'am.

433
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:23,886
I thought you were someone else.

434
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:26,258
He told me to kiss you,
except you're not you, are you?

435
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:27,534
You told him to kiss me?

436
00:28:27,637 --> 00:28:29,044
Lady, if I had known
he was gonna kiss you,

437
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,148
I wouldn't have sent a boy
to do a man's job.

438
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,871
That's for the man.
You can tell him the job's filled.

439
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:36,526
- Oh, look what you've done.
- Oh, the Bat Lady.

440
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:39,117
Are you Miss Abigail Parker,
Miss Parker?

441
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:41,010
Are you Miss Parker, Miss Parker?

442
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:42,483
I'm Eugene Fullstack.

443
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:44,970
- You should lay off protein.
- No, that's my name.

444
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:46,354
Look, I'm sorry he kissed you,

445
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:48,209
and he's sorry he kissed you,
aren't you, Eugie?

446
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,513
- No, I liked that a lot.
- No. Look, come here.

447
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:53,100
You stay here and see if you can
sell Murdock one of your stories.

448
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:56,369
Maybe between the both of us,
one of us might get a job. Go on.

449
00:28:57,685 --> 00:28:59,921
Hold it, Miss Parker.
Oh, you gotta help us.

450
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:02,606
My partner said he went to your door
last night and saw a real Bat Lady.

451
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:05,742
Yes. My model was posing.
Now may I go?

452
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:06,860
Well, what's the rush?

453
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:09,234
I never met a lady cartoonist before.

454
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,472
All lady cartoonists
are extremely grateful.

455
00:29:11,572 --> 00:29:12,555
Well, I'm an artist myself.

456
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:14,221
What do you say
we get together sometime

457
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:16,048
and compare mad scientists?

458
00:29:18,837 --> 00:29:21,488
I sure love the way
you draw the Bat Lady.

459
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:25,235
Lovely lines.

460
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,551
I like the way
your bone structure is structured.

461
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:35,532
Dandy "tibialis gastrocnemiuses", also.

462
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,834
- Going up?
- Yes, down.

463
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,072
Try sideways,
then once around the park.

464
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:45,006
Parker will do better, dear.

465
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:48,655
She's going to do substantially better.
That's what I said.

466
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:51,474
Yeah, so don't fret
your ever-loving fretter.

467
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:52,980
I said yes!

468
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:58,259
The sales of the next issue
will show a substantial increase.

469
00:30:00,053 --> 00:30:01,362
Yes.

470
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:05,004
Throw in a couple of "uh-huhs"
once in a while, will you?

471
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,196
Great Scott!

472
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:37,899
What are you supposed to be?

473
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,860
I'm supposed to be Eugene Fullstack.

474
00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:42,477
No, I am Eugene Fullstack.
Are you Mr. Murdock?

475
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:44,174
All right, come on, speak up, boy.
Come on, speak up.

476
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:45,357
Speak, speak, speak.

477
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:48,330
Speak. What's on your mind?
Spit it out, boy. Spit it out.

478
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:56,081
But, you see, I write little stories
for children. Children's stories, see?

479
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:59,476
- And I came up...
- You're... Oh, you're a writer. Oh!

480
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:04,755
You have that thin, emaciated,
anaemic look, bloodless look,

481
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:08,529
probably very much in need of
a publisher for a great new comic book.

482
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:09,774
Well, why didn't you say so?

483
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:11,633
Come on, now.
Wipe that helpless look off your face.

484
00:31:11,732 --> 00:31:13,488
Come right up to me and say,

485
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:19,535
"Mr. Murdock, I've got a great new idea
for a new comic book.

486
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:21,873
"Are you interested?" Come on.

487
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:25,136
"Mr. Murdock,

488
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:29,745
"I've got a new, great idea

489
00:31:30,293 --> 00:31:32,911
"for a new comic book!

490
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:36,755
"Are you interested?"

491
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,700
- No. No.
- Oh.

492
00:31:41,013 --> 00:31:42,639
But wait. Wait, wait, wait.

493
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:46,898
But maybe an idea
growing out of the brain

494
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:49,746
that probably lies behind that face

495
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:52,911
may be just what
my wife's separate maintenance needs.

496
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:55,791
Lad, what's the idea?
Give me the gist of it.

497
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:57,583
What is it all about? Give me the idea.

498
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:00,173
Well, you see,
I write about all my little friends.

499
00:32:00,277 --> 00:32:02,187
- Oh, yes.
- Little Goosey Goose

500
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:06,287
and little Freddie Field Mouse,
who live in a little corn field.

501
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:07,949
Now, these little friends of mine...

502
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:11,850
Little Goosey Goose
and little Freddie Field Mouse?

503
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:18,859
You see that little window
back there, boy?

504
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:20,110
Yes, sir.

505
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:23,341
Open it a little. Then jump.

506
00:32:23,445 --> 00:32:25,332
All right. No, no!

507
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:26,771
I'd like to see Mr. Murdock.

508
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,778
Good afternoon, madam.
At your service.

509
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:32,267
Then you, Mr. Murdock,
are responsible for my son, Richard.

510
00:32:32,372 --> 00:32:35,242
Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Murdock?
Nice to know you.

511
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:39,150
I am not Mrs. Murdock.
I am Mrs. John Stilton.

512
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:40,201
Oh.

513
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,163
As publisher of "The Bat Lady",

514
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:45,425
you are responsible
for my son's condition.

515
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:48,820
And as I am chairman of
the Second Elementary School District,

516
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,851
I am going to file a petition
against your comic book.

517
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:53,680
Before I do, however,

518
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:57,327
I think you ought to have the pleasure
of my son Richard's company

519
00:32:57,428 --> 00:32:59,501
While I go shopping,

520
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:02,736
to observe for yourself
the effect your horror literature

521
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:04,691
has on undeveloped minds!

522
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:07,178
Yes, but, madam, as a mother,

523
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:10,961
aren't you just a little bit worried about
leaving your undeveloped mind here?

524
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:13,450
Your mother is the one to be worried.

525
00:33:16,436 --> 00:33:20,714
Well, Richard,
pleased to make your acquaintance.

526
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,442
Pleased to offer you my hand.

527
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,685
What happened? What's the matter?

528
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:33,967
Bessie, what floor is the nurse on?

529
00:33:34,068 --> 00:33:35,629
The second,
right below Dr. Stevens' office.

530
00:33:35,732 --> 00:33:36,910
Thank you.

531
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:39,028
Bringing kids!

532
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:43,881
Who's that?

533
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:47,786
This is Richard Stilton.
His mother left him here for developing.

534
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,576
Don't get too close, though.
He may be poisonous.

535
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:52,466
Well, he's cute.

536
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,866
Well, Richard,
What can I do to entertain you?

537
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:57,648
Not a thing.
You're too old for me, mophead.

538
00:33:57,749 --> 00:33:59,888
- Is this a dagger?
- No, it's a letter opener,

539
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:02,323
and it's too sharp
for little boys to play with.

540
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:03,947
Who wants to play with it?

541
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:14,953
Richard! That's no way to behave.

542
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:16,784
The Bat Lady wouldn't like that.

543
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:18,740
Who cares about the Bat Lady?

544
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:21,225
She's too tame. She stinks.

545
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,405
No blood. I like blood.

546
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:29,172
You touch me, and I'll throw
this jug of acid in your eyes.

547
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:32,116
- I'll mobilise you!
- Eugene, no!

548
00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:33,456
I got it.

549
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,956
Look, Niagara Falls.

550
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:41,428
Why don't you two go on a honeymoon?

551
00:34:41,524 --> 00:34:43,280
I'll bring the barrel.

552
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:50,066
- Hurry! Outside!
- Yeah.

553
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:02,153
Thank you for the escort.

554
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:05,108
It's been dandy having somebody
breathe down my neck for two hours.

555
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:08,205
Oh, well, it's a dandy neck,
and I wouldn't mind going on overtime.

556
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:10,283
Same old line, eh, Ricky?

557
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:11,796
It's a man at work.

558
00:35:11,957 --> 00:35:13,615
Now, look, honey,
you're an unemployed artist

559
00:35:13,716 --> 00:35:14,862
and I'm an unemployed artist.

560
00:35:14,964 --> 00:35:16,241
What do you say
we get together sometime

561
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,762
and rattle our palettes around?

562
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:21,072
Watch out, girl. He really rattles.

563
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:24,206
- Aren't you late for something?
- Looks like it.

564
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:27,625
That's a friend of yours?

565
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:29,009
She is now.

566
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:31,563
Look, I'm sorry you're unemployed,
but it happens that I'm not.

567
00:35:31,669 --> 00:35:32,945
I'm doing an advertising layout.

568
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:36,525
So if you'll excuse me,
I'll get my models and get to work.

569
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:37,741
Models?

570
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:40,404
Yes, models.

571
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:43,212
You understand.
They're people who pose.

572
00:35:43,316 --> 00:35:45,651
I need one male and one female.

573
00:35:45,748 --> 00:35:47,155
Well, now,
you can't beat that combination.

574
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:48,463
How about me for the male?

575
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:51,663
I posed once. Remember that poster,
"Send This Boy to Camp"?

576
00:35:51,764 --> 00:35:53,259
It was me.

577
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:56,564
Maybe you would do.
Have you ever posed with a girl?

578
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,483
Not while anyone was watching.

579
00:36:10,581 --> 00:36:12,948
No, no, no. Hold her tighter.

580
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,735
Be passionate. You love her.

581
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,778
Take it easy. My back's killing me.

582
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,859
You heard boss. She said tighter.

583
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:24,141
I said tighter,
but I didn't say fracture her rib case.

584
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:26,033
Come on, I'll show him.

585
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:29,134
Now put your arms around me.

586
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:34,571
That's it. Now bend me back a little.

587
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:40,271
That's fine. Now look into my eyes.

588
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,947
Come close.

589
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:48,429
Now pretend you love
my Cleave-To lipstick.

590
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:50,899
Pretend? You sound like my roommate.

591
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,490
But you don't look like him.

592
00:37:00,628 --> 00:37:02,090
Well, that was uncalled for.

593
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:04,051
I could have sworn I heard you call.

594
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:07,181
I believe you should be
sent back to camp, Mr. Todd.

595
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:09,905
That'll be all today, Janet.

596
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:12,012
We'll continue tomorrow

597
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:15,215
when I can get you
a professional model to work with.

598
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,072
Okay, Miss Parker.

599
00:37:17,973 --> 00:37:19,729
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

600
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:25,226
Let's see. You worked two hours.
That should do it.

601
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:27,536
No. That one was on the house.

602
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:30,866
It's only a sample to show you what
you don't have to be missing anymore.

603
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:33,136
Your humility intrigues me.

604
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:39,763
Miss Parker, aren't you breathing
a little heavy for just a kiss?

605
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:42,122
You're not in condition, are you?

606
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:44,782
What's the matther,
all work and no playing around?

607
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:47,406
Mr. Todd, I'm breathing heavily

608
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:51,370
because I happen to be
a perfectly normal young woman.

609
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:55,056
My heart beats, my pulse pounds,
my blood count is high.

610
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:59,597
I have all the biological impulses
that anybody else has.

611
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:05,673
- I'm no different than you.
- I wouldn't say that.

612
00:38:09,332 --> 00:38:11,405
I like being kissed. I love it.

613
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:14,737
Under the mistletoe, in the dark,
early in the morning,

614
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:18,479
lunchtime, teatime,
cocktail time, anytime,

615
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,719
but I don't want to be kissed by you.

616
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,315
Oh, hold it.

617
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:24,595
Give me a chance.

618
00:38:25,077 --> 00:38:28,426
At least with the cocktails
and the mistletoe bit.

619
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:30,125
I might grow on you.

620
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,940
See, I even fell for you.

621
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:38,384
<i>I never thought</i>

622
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:41,583
<i>I'd ever be caught</i>

623
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:46,644
<i>Using an old cliché</i>

624
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,488
<i>I'm on a spot</i>

625
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:53,266
<i>Believe it or not</i>

626
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:59,663
<i>This is all I can think of to say</i>

627
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:05,452
<i>You look so familiar</i>

628
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:10,575
<i>Have we ever met before?</i>

629
00:39:11,317 --> 00:39:14,961
<i>Everything about you</i>

630
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,500
<i>Seems to ring a bell</i>

631
00:39:20,757 --> 00:39:24,880
<i>You look so familiar</i>

632
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:30,130
<i>Have we been this close before?</i>

633
00:39:30,676 --> 00:39:33,425
<i>If my heart could talk</i>

634
00:39:33,524 --> 00:39:39,787
<i>You'd hear it sing as well</i>

635
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:43,722
<i>There must be</i>

636
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:48,106
<i>An explanation</i>

637
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,712
<i>What I feel is not</i>

638
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:59,049
<i>Imagination</i>

639
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:03,403
<i>You look so familiar</i>

640
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:08,178
<i>Now it all comes back, it seems</i>

641
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:15,858
<i>I remember, you were in my dreams</i>

642
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:21,329
Scout's honour, Your Honour.

643
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:25,396
<i>I remember</i>

644
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:32,137
<i>You were in my dreams</i>

645
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,253
- Hello?
- Is Mr. Rick Todd in yet?

646
00:40:54,356 --> 00:40:55,501
Just a minute.

647
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:01,138
Rick Todd! Telephone!

648
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:05,774
Ask him to meet me for lunch
at the Stork Club in a half an hour.

649
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:07,120
Yes, Mr. Murdock.

650
00:41:07,477 --> 00:41:10,793
Rick Todd! Telephone!

651
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:14,609
Telephone? Okay, just a minute.

652
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:24,658
<i>You look so</i>

653
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:25,684
<i>You look</i>

654
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,787
Oh, Rick.
Oh, Rick, there's a telephone call.

655
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,234
- Who is it?
- What?

656
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:35,634
- Who is it?
- Oh, I don't know.

657
00:41:35,732 --> 00:41:38,099
- Well, go find out.
- Oh, all right.

658
00:41:38,197 --> 00:41:39,124
Now!

659
00:41:39,252 --> 00:41:41,195
Now. Check, check, okay.

660
00:41:57,045 --> 00:41:58,932
- Hello.
- Mr. Todd?

661
00:41:59,028 --> 00:42:01,483
- Yeah. Who's calling?
- The Murdock Publishing Company.

662
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:03,247
Oh, okay, just a  minute.

663
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:17,934
Hey, Rick, Rick.
It's the Murdock Publishing Company.

664
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:18,985
What'd I tell you?

665
00:42:19,092 --> 00:42:21,001
With your sugar lips and my brains,
we're gonna go places.

666
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:22,515
- What'd they want?
- Oh, I didn't ask.

667
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:23,986
Then ask. Well, go and ask!

668
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:26,320
Oh, check, check, okay.

669
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:40,976
Hello. What do you want?

670
00:42:41,844 --> 00:42:44,878
Mr. Murdock would like to know
if Mr. Todd can see him.

671
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,573
Just a minute. I'll find out.

672
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:03,091
Well, well?

673
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:05,072
Can you see Mr. Murdock?

674
00:43:05,172 --> 00:43:07,561
Can I see him? Of course I can see him.
Where? When? Where?

675
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,643
- I don't know.
- Well, go find out!

676
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:11,275
Yes, sir. Check, check, check.

677
00:43:27,412 --> 00:43:28,525
Hello.

678
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:31,823
When? Where?

679
00:43:32,052 --> 00:43:33,296
"When? Where?"

680
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:35,721
Oh, Mr. Murdock would like to know

681
00:43:35,828 --> 00:43:38,545
if Mr. Todd could have lunch with him
at the Stork Club in half an hour.

682
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:42,157
He'll... He'll be there.

683
00:44:23,924 --> 00:44:27,569
All right, what'd they say?
What'd they say?

684
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,347
Speak up, butt-brain.
What'd they say? Speak up!

685
00:44:32,532 --> 00:44:35,314
I can't hear you. Tell me.
Give me a signal, something.

686
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:37,833
- What did they say?
- Wait.

687
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,045
Eugie, what'd they say?

688
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:44,878
Give me a signal, something. Good.

689
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:49,385
Oh, a duck? A duck. A duck, right?

690
00:44:49,492 --> 00:44:51,314
A duck. A duck.

691
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,286
Sounds like... Sounds like murder.

692
00:44:54,388 --> 00:44:58,666
Murder? Sherlock? Murder?
Murder? A murduck?

693
00:44:58,772 --> 00:45:01,325
Murdock! Oh, Murdock.
Oh, yeah, Murdock.

694
00:45:01,428 --> 00:45:02,410
That was him on the phone?

695
00:45:02,516 --> 00:45:04,883
Well, what does he want?
What's he want? What does he want?

696
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,013
He wants... A cow?

697
00:45:08,116 --> 00:45:10,418
Murdock wants a cow?

698
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:14,444
What's he want a cow for?
He wants to eat a cow?

699
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:17,681
He wants to eat meat, right? What?

700
00:45:18,612 --> 00:45:21,329
What does he want? what?

701
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:25,419
Oh, he wants some meat. Meat?

702
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:27,727
What are you doing in the tub? Meat?

703
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:32,016
He wants to meat...
Oh, Murdock wants to meet me.

704
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:34,483
Yeah! Where? Where?
All right don't get...

705
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,652
Where does he want to meet me?

706
00:45:36,756 --> 00:45:39,723
Out there? He's out there now? Where?

707
00:45:41,428 --> 00:45:43,468
He wants to meet me and fly?

708
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:48,331
- Where?
- Hold on.

709
00:46:07,316 --> 00:46:09,585
Oh, you're a stork! That's it!

710
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:13,099
Mr. Murdock wants to meet me
at the Stork Club, right?

711
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,569
Hey, thanks for squaring
Eugie and me with the landlady.

712
00:46:26,676 --> 00:46:27,886
You're welcome.

713
00:46:27,988 --> 00:46:30,955
She explained all about Eugene
and his wild comic-book dreams.

714
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,613
You're to blame, all that Bat Lady stuff.

715
00:46:33,716 --> 00:46:35,756
That's all over now.

716
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,616
You know, I think I could help Eugene.

717
00:46:37,716 --> 00:46:40,367
Is he free to go to a meeting we're
having tonight about comic books?

718
00:46:40,468 --> 00:46:41,515
Why don't you go up and ask him?

719
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,041
He's taking a bath, but walk right in.

720
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:45,708
He's got his clothes on.

721
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:50,129
You know, you still look familiar.

722
00:46:51,315 --> 00:46:53,682
And you still act familiar.

723
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,690
I'll see you later.

724
00:47:10,676 --> 00:47:12,301
- There. Todd?
- Yes, sir.

725
00:47:12,404 --> 00:47:14,411
Sit right down.
I've already ordered for you.

726
00:47:14,516 --> 00:47:16,338
Thank you, Mr. Furdock... Murdock.

727
00:47:16,436 --> 00:47:18,443
This is my daughter.

728
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,220
Now, let's get right down
to business, lad.

729
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,844
What are your ideas?

730
00:47:25,684 --> 00:47:27,277
- Ideas?
- Yes.

731
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:29,137
You mean stories?

732
00:47:29,844 --> 00:47:30,989
You want someone to write them?

733
00:47:31,092 --> 00:47:35,150
I need crime, I need passion
and even romance,

734
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,324
that is, providing
it's between your repulse characters.

735
00:47:37,428 --> 00:47:41,290
You want something gory,
like the Vulture.

736
00:47:41,396 --> 00:47:43,981
Vulture, Vulture. Sounds fresh.

737
00:47:44,084 --> 00:47:46,451
I don't think there's any character
like that in comic books.

738
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:48,719
You mean
you've never heard of the Vulture?

739
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,925
well, how could I? You just told me.

740
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:54,705
Well, now, come on. now.
When did you dream this up?

741
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:56,331
I didn't dream this up.

742
00:47:56,436 --> 00:47:58,443
I didn't know
he dreamed original dreams.

743
00:47:58,548 --> 00:48:00,370
Come on, now. Stop babbling, boy.
Stop babbling.

744
00:48:00,468 --> 00:48:01,417
Who dreams? What dreams?

745
00:48:01,524 --> 00:48:05,452
Come on, tell me about the Vulture,
and give me that gore pouring out.

746
00:48:05,556 --> 00:48:09,385
Oozing out, Mr. Murdock!
Oozing out of his tail!

747
00:48:10,612 --> 00:48:12,586
Don't pay any attention to them.
It's perfectly all right.

748
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:15,343
- Oozing out of whose tail, lad?
- Vincent. Vincent the Vulture.

749
00:48:15,443 --> 00:48:16,785
Oh, Vincent the Vulture.
Vincent the Vulture.

750
00:48:16,884 --> 00:48:19,372
Oh, I see what you mean.
What happens next? Tell me.

751
00:48:19,476 --> 00:48:20,905
I can't tell you now.

752
00:48:21,012 --> 00:48:23,248
You can't tell me now. Well, why not?

753
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:25,104
I gotta go home
and have him sleep on it.

754
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:27,309
I mean, I gotta go home and sleep on it.

755
00:48:27,411 --> 00:48:30,095
Oh, Eugie, you dream boy, you.

756
00:48:33,972 --> 00:48:37,998
The Better America Forum "is on the air".

757
00:48:40,468 --> 00:48:41,994
You nervous, Eugene?

758
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,002
Oh, no, just my knees are nervous.

759
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:47,241
They've never been on television before.

760
00:48:47,348 --> 00:48:50,730
Tonight "The Better America Forum"
brings to your attention

761
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:54,577
the monumental problem
confronting your children today,

762
00:48:54,676 --> 00:48:56,236
the ever-growing threat and menace

763
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,828
of the cheap pulps
found on all newsstands

764
00:48:58,932 --> 00:49:01,966
masquerading under the titles
of comic books.

765
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:03,978
Now, to aid us in our discussion,

766
00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:07,662
we have enlisted the aid
of Professor Samuel D. Roberts,

767
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:10,764
child psychologist Mrs. Newton Geudel,

768
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:12,111
Miss Abigail Parker.

769
00:49:12,212 --> 00:49:14,154
Miss Parker, artist and writer,

770
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:18,351
was until recently
herself a contributor to comic books.

771
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:21,615
She knows the pressures
brought by unscrupulous publishers.

772
00:49:21,716 --> 00:49:24,204
We've fortunate also
in having Miss Parker's guest,

773
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:26,696
Mr. Eugene Fullstack.

774
00:49:26,804 --> 00:49:31,179
Mr. Fullstack, I understand, has been
reading comic books for 15 years.

775
00:49:31,283 --> 00:49:34,415
He has come at Miss Parker's request
to give us his firsthand knowledge

776
00:49:34,515 --> 00:49:39,436
of what can happen to the human brain
on a steady diet of comic books.

777
00:49:50,548 --> 00:49:52,784
<i>Bullyoo, bullyoo</i>

778
00:49:52,884 --> 00:49:55,753
<i>Boy, have I got news for you</i>

779
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,281
<i>I've got a feeling, hap-happy feeling</i>

780
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:00,722
<i>This is my lucky day</i>

781
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,275
<i>Don't want to sing the blues no more</i>

782
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,616
<i>Not when I feel this way</i>

783
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:08,050
<i>I'm gonna rock it 'cause in my pocket</i>

784
00:50:08,148 --> 00:50:10,384
<i>I got a load of green</i>

785
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:12,851
<i>I want to spread the word around</i>

786
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,987
<i>So you'll know what I mean</i>

787
00:50:15,091 --> 00:50:17,393
<i>Bullyoo, bullyoo</i>

788
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:19,314
<i>Boy, have I got news for you</i>

789
00:50:19,412 --> 00:50:24,333
<i>I'm going to march, march, march
along the avenue</i>

790
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:28,810
<i>I'm gonna sing, sing, sing
my lucky song</i>

791
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:34,317
<i>I'm going to fly, fly, fly
like little birdies do</i>

792
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:38,642
<i>Spread your wings and come along</i>

793
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:43,595
<i>I'm going to live, live, live it up
along the way</i>

794
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,336
<i>So tell me, how can things go wrong?</i>

795
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:51,632
<i>Hey, brother, what a heyday</i>

796
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:54,666
<i>This has been my lucky payday</i>

797
00:50:54,772 --> 00:50:57,489
<i>And my lucky song</i>

798
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:00,818
<i>Bullyoo, bullyoo</i>

799
00:51:00,915 --> 00:51:03,915
<i>Boy, have I got news for you</i>

800
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,405
<i>Scat a song</i>

801
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,717
<i>sing along</i>

802
00:51:22,228 --> 00:51:27,084
<i>I'm going to march, march, march
along the avenue</i>

803
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:31,759
<i>I'm gonna sing, sing, sing
my lucky song</i>

804
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:36,813
<i>I'm going to fly, fly, fly
like little birdies do</i>

805
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:41,226
<i>Spread your wings and come along</i>

806
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:45,968
<i>I'm going to live, live, live it up
along the way</i>

807
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:50,737
<i>So tell me, how can things go wrong?</i>

808
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:53,737
<i>Hey, brother, what a heyday</i>

809
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,942
<i>This has been my lucky payday</i>

810
00:51:57,044 --> 00:52:00,044
<i>And my locky song</i>

811
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,061
<i>Wanna give</i>

812
00:52:02,163 --> 00:52:03,091
<i>Wanna give</i>

813
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:05,577
<i>Wanna spread this happy stuff around</i>

814
00:52:05,684 --> 00:52:06,796
<i>Wanna sing</i>

815
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:07,914
<i>Wanna dance</i>

816
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:10,507
<i>Wanna raise my feet right off the ground</i>

817
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:42,832
<i>I'm going to march, march, march
along the avenue</i>

818
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:47,536
<i>So tell me, how can thing go wrong?</i>

819
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:50,734
<i>Hey, brother, what a heyday</i>

820
00:52:50,836 --> 00:52:53,705
<i>This has been my lucky payday</i>

821
00:52:53,812 --> 00:52:57,107
<i>And my lucky song</i>

822
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:01,449
<i>My luck-luck-lucky song</i>

823
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:13,810
<i>My luck-luck-lucky song</i>

824
00:53:16,691 --> 00:53:20,848
<i>My luck-luck-lucky song</i>

825
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,721
<i>Thank you, and good evening.</i>

826
00:53:28,147 --> 00:53:29,162
Hi, Eugie.

827
00:53:29,267 --> 00:53:31,984
<i>I am here to talk to the children
and to the parents of the children,</i>

828
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,353
<i>because if there weren't parents,
there wouldn't be children,</i>

829
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:35,913
<i>and vice versa.</i>

830
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,987
<i>What I mean is that parents
are necessary if you want children,</i>

831
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:41,197
<i>and children are necessary
if parents want them,</i>

832
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:42,324
<i>if know what I mean.</i>

833
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:43,251
<i>if know what I mean.</i>

834
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:45,901
Eugene! What are you doing in there?

835
00:53:46,003 --> 00:53:50,127
<i>I'm here to tell you
how bad comic books are for you.</i>

836
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,529
<i>I never thought they were bad myself</i>

837
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:54,962
<i>until my friend Rick Todd
told me how bad they were.</i>

838
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:58,060
Well, I was wrong.
Boy, was I wrong. Hey.

839
00:53:58,163 --> 00:53:59,625
<i>And how right he was.</i>

840
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:01,357
No, I was wrong, you dope.

841
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:03,914
<i>And I almost became a dope
reading comic books.</i>

842
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:07,947
<i>And I realise that
that is why I am now a little retarded.</i>

843
00:54:08,052 --> 00:54:10,441
<i>You see, I was very slow in school.</i>

844
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:13,165
<i>That is, the comic books made me
very slow in school.</i>

845
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:14,827
<i>As a matter of fact,
I was so slow in school</i>

846
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:17,233
<i>that I went to summer school
in the wintertime.</i>

847
00:54:17,331 --> 00:54:21,193
<i>Like, for instance,
the story you told me about, Mr. Baker.</i>

848
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,339
<i>The five-year-old kid that was caught</i>

849
00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:25,865
<i>stuffing his grandmother
in the trunk compartment of the car.</i>

850
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,273
<i>An extreme example
of comic book influence.</i>

851
00:54:28,371 --> 00:54:29,451
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

852
00:54:29,555 --> 00:54:33,298
<i>And any five-year-old kid should know
he's not old enough to drive a car.</i>

853
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,981
<i>Have comic books influenced you
to that extent?</i>

854
00:54:36,084 --> 00:54:39,018
<i>Oh, I didn't learn to drive
until I was eight.</i>

855
00:54:39,124 --> 00:54:42,702
<i>Now, would you say that you have
learned anything from comic books?</i>

856
00:54:42,835 --> 00:54:44,875
<i>Oh, yes. Yeah. Oh...</i>

857
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,157
<i>Oh, boy, yes.</i>

858
00:54:46,259 --> 00:54:49,739
<i>I learned... Particularly, I learned
how to grow poison plants</i>

859
00:54:49,844 --> 00:54:51,982
<i>in a windowsill flowerport,</i>

860
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,898
<i>how to keep the tarnish
off brass knuckles,</i>

861
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:59,469
<i>also, how to start a fire
by rubbing two gasoline cans together.</i>

862
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:01,132
<i>What a fire that makes.</i>

863
00:55:01,235 --> 00:55:03,439
<i>And also
how to make a hangman's knot.</i>

864
00:55:03,572 --> 00:55:05,394
<i>And last
and certainly, by no means, least,</i>

865
00:55:05,492 --> 00:55:08,787
<i>how to prepare rat poison
so that it spreads like peanut butter.</i>

866
00:55:08,884 --> 00:55:09,898
<i>I see.</i>

867
00:55:10,004 --> 00:55:12,906
<i>And now you realise
that this knowledge is dangerous.</i>

868
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:15,859
<i>Oh, yes, it is very dangerous. yes.</i>

869
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:19,817
<i>Oh, it's pretty... Real...
It's dangerous, all right.</i>

870
00:55:19,923 --> 00:55:21,963
<i>It gave me very bad dreams.</i>

871
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,042
Bad? They're worth a pile!

872
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:25,968
<i>Now, what exactly did you dream?</i>

873
00:55:26,068 --> 00:55:28,653
<i>Well, that's the trouble, see?
That's it, right there.</i>

874
00:55:28,755 --> 00:55:30,413
<i>I never retained anything I dreamed.</i>

875
00:55:30,516 --> 00:55:33,996
<i>I never remembered anything
when I woke up,</i>

876
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,434
<i>except my friend Rick
said they were very bad dreams.</i>

877
00:55:36,531 --> 00:55:39,313
<i>Oh, yes. They were awful.
I screamed and carried on and...</i>

878
00:55:39,411 --> 00:55:40,359
<i>Oh, it was something awful.</i>

879
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:42,857
<i>My subconscious was battling
against my conscious,</i>

880
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:46,094
<i>and the basic intelligence of my mind
wouldn't allow myself to comprehend</i>

881
00:55:46,195 --> 00:55:48,650
<i>some of the problems
that were forethought prior to sleeping,</i>

882
00:55:48,756 --> 00:55:50,447
<i>and at the same time,
not having any rest,</i>

883
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,547
<i>because of no sedation whatsoever
to make my rest and dreams</i>

884
00:55:53,652 --> 00:55:57,426
<i>any brighter or smarter than they were
when I was much younger.</i>

885
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:00,937
Rick, we're home.

886
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:03,248
Well, now, Mrs. Muldoon,
you're much stronger than I am.

887
00:56:03,348 --> 00:56:05,006
We'll pay the rent, honest.
Miss Parker and I...

888
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:07,474
Oh, yes. I'm going to illustrate
one of Eugene's stories.

889
00:56:07,571 --> 00:56:08,499
I know it'll sell.

890
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:11,595
Sell, schmell. Eugene, your rent's paid.

891
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:14,448
You give this to Mr. Todd for me.

892
00:56:14,547 --> 00:56:17,776
Well, what do you...
What do you mean, our rent's paid?

893
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,974
It certainly is. He gave it to me.
Mr. Todd, in advance.

894
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:29,193
I think Rick took that job with Murdock.

895
00:56:29,299 --> 00:56:32,114
And if he did, we're not pals no more.

896
00:56:43,955 --> 00:56:45,100
Rick.

897
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:49,139
Rick? Rick? Rick.

898
00:56:49,555 --> 00:56:51,213
Well, where you two been?

899
00:56:51,315 --> 00:56:52,242
Where you been?

900
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:53,768
And where did you get the money
to pay the rent?

901
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,370
Oh, I've arrived, boy. I've arrived.

902
00:56:55,475 --> 00:56:58,672
It's me and Rembrandt now.
We're neck-and-neck. Look.

903
00:56:58,803 --> 00:57:01,323
- Oh, you sold the painting!
- Oh, Rick, that's wonderful.

904
00:57:01,427 --> 00:57:02,769
That was nothing.

905
00:57:02,867 --> 00:57:06,348
Matter of fact, I feel another
masterpiece coming on right now.

906
00:57:06,451 --> 00:57:07,728
What is it, curly top?

907
00:57:07,828 --> 00:57:09,202
Well, I feel
a little ashamed of myself, Rick.

908
00:57:09,299 --> 00:57:12,048
I thought you got the money
for doing a comic book for Mr. Murdock.

909
00:57:12,147 --> 00:57:16,141
Here. That's from Mrs. Muldoon,
and that's from me.

910
00:57:16,243 --> 00:57:17,421
Thanks.

911
00:57:19,155 --> 00:57:21,359
Jury still out on you?

912
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,281
Not guilty.

913
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:32,172
Hey! Cute characters.

914
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:34,738
Your boyfriend has a story idea
for children's books.

915
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:37,585
- I'm going to illustrate them.
- My boyfriend?

916
00:57:37,684 --> 00:57:39,920
He's up to his ears with the Bat Lady.

917
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:41,775
Well, you should have told him
it was you.

918
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,072
I wanted him to go for me,
not for some costume you dreamed up.

919
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:47,724
Well, you weren't wearing a costume
when he kissed you.

920
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:50,960
You weren't wearing a costume
when he kissed you.

921
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:55,818
But I told you,
he thought it was you coming back.

922
00:57:55,923 --> 00:57:57,450
You just be patient.

923
00:57:57,555 --> 00:58:01,417
He'll stop those crazy dreams
and see you for your own charming self.

924
00:58:06,707 --> 00:58:08,114
Our song.

925
00:58:10,675 --> 00:58:13,425
All right, you said that. Okay, you said it.

926
00:58:22,195 --> 00:58:24,170
Dream louder. Louder.

927
00:58:29,587 --> 00:58:31,529
Vincent flaps his feeble wings

928
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:34,352
as he tries to fly back
to his space station

929
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:36,338
before Zuba gets to him.

930
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,441
She looks across the water
with her lavender eye

931
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:41,710
and then moves in for the kill.

932
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:44,200
Lavender eyes? You said purple eyes.

933
00:58:44,307 --> 00:58:46,958
One lavender, one purple
and one magenta.

934
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:47,987
Three eyes?

935
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:50,504
One in the back, like a rear-view mirror.

936
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:54,735
And she uses her beautiful body
like a pair of pontoons.

937
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:57,899
She sails across the jungle swamp,

938
00:58:58,003 --> 00:59:00,938
ready to sink her fangs
into Vincent's jungular veins

939
00:59:01,043 --> 00:59:03,760
so that she can get away
with his secret power formula,

940
00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:09,096
X34 minus 5R1 plus 6-X36.

941
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:16,554
Oh, boy.

942
00:59:28,179 --> 00:59:29,456
Bessie?

943
00:59:32,371 --> 00:59:35,786
What do you suppose
the stars would say about Rick?

944
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:39,472
I've taken up numerology.

945
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:41,837
I'm off the stars.

946
00:59:41,939 --> 00:59:44,110
They made me flip my Little Dipper
and fall for a guy

947
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:46,218
who's in love with the lady in black.

948
00:59:46,323 --> 00:59:48,178
I'll gonna tell him you're the Bat Lady.

949
00:59:48,275 --> 00:59:52,072
Oh, no, you don't. I don't want to wear
a mask the rest of my life.

950
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:55,528
Some honeymoon,
with a pair of wings on my back.

951
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,871
How's the numerology working out?

952
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:01,132
You know, numerology's a science.

953
01:00:01,235 --> 01:00:02,315
I take the numbers,

954
01:00:02,419 --> 01:00:04,655
the day, the month and the year
that I was born.

955
01:00:04,755 --> 01:00:07,144
I add to the day, the month
and the year that Eugene was born.

956
01:00:07,251 --> 01:00:08,844
And that answer,
I divide with my street address,

957
01:00:08,947 --> 01:00:10,703
then I add that
to my Social Security Number,

958
01:00:10,803 --> 01:00:13,105
and with that answer, I divide
Eugene's Social Security Number.

959
01:00:13,203 --> 01:00:15,691
Then I mutiply that by the number
of dancing lessons I take,

960
01:00:15,795 --> 01:00:18,162
and the number of calories
I eat in one day, I subtract from that,

961
01:00:18,259 --> 01:00:21,936
and then I multiply the whole thing,
by now tall I am, and that's the answer.

962
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,516
- How does it work out?
- Zero. Eugene again.

963
01:00:27,379 --> 01:00:30,062
That still doesn't help me with Rick.

964
01:00:41,395 --> 01:00:43,916
Could be
you're in love with Rick, maybe.

965
01:00:44,435 --> 01:00:48,330
Oh, Bessie, you don't fall in love with
someone you've only seen a few times.

966
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:55,312
I guess I'd better put some oil on you.
You're going to burn.

967
01:00:59,443 --> 01:01:01,069
You have strong hands.

968
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,043
Bessie?

969
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:13,295
I wonder if he really likes me.

970
01:01:15,731 --> 01:01:19,211
I bet if he had the chance,
he couldn't keep his hands off you.

971
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:24,014
I love this song. Listen.

972
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:29,480
<i>If our lips should meet</i>

973
01:01:29,587 --> 01:01:33,067
<i>Innamorata</i>

974
01:01:34,931 --> 01:01:38,346
<i>Kiss me, kiss me sweet</i>

975
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,996
<i>Innamorata</i>

976
01:01:43,923 --> 01:01:49,902
<i>Hold me close and say you're mine</i>

977
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:58,351
<i>With a love as warm as wine</i>

978
01:02:01,107 --> 01:02:04,816
<i>I'm at heaven's door</i>

979
01:02:04,915 --> 01:02:08,493
<i>Innamorata</i>

980
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:13,388
<i>Want you more and more</i>

981
01:02:13,491 --> 01:02:17,168
<i>Innamorata</i>

982
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:22,605
<i>You're a symphony</i>

983
01:02:22,707 --> 01:02:27,148
<i>A very beautiful sonata</i>

984
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:30,383
<i>My innamorata</i>

985
01:02:30,483 --> 01:02:35,721
<i>Say that you're my sweetheart</i>

986
01:02:35,827 --> 01:02:40,300
<i>My love</i>

987
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:46,258
- Bessie?
- Yeah?

988
01:02:46,355 --> 01:02:48,624
Who's that singer? He sounds like Rick.

989
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,854
Oh, you know, he's the fellow that had
that big record on "That's Amore".

990
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:53,679
You remember, the one...

991
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:59,052
How can you be rubbing my back
from way over there?

992
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,266
Oh!

993
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:05,066
I don't sing as good as he does,
but I'm trying.

994
01:03:05,171 --> 01:03:08,618
Yes, he...
Strong voice and very strong hands.

995
01:03:08,723 --> 01:03:11,025
You're breathing heavy again.

996
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:12,846
I should have brought along
my stethoscope.

997
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:15,281
Oh, you're a doctor, too?

998
01:03:15,891 --> 01:03:18,509
I think I could prescribe something.

999
01:03:18,611 --> 01:03:21,742
Like a chiropractor treatment, no doubt.

1000
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:25,521
A little pink pill that says
you can fall in love with someone

1001
01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:27,822
you've only seen a few times.

1002
01:03:54,707 --> 01:03:58,351
<i>If our lips should meet</i>

1003
01:03:58,451 --> 01:04:02,248

01:04:37,043 --> 01:04:40,338

<i>Love</i>

1039
01:08:05,459 --> 01:08:08,361
There. Now, how's that for Freddie?

1040
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:12,207
Oh, he looks just like
I dreamed he would. He's cute.

1041
01:08:12,306 --> 01:08:14,194
He looks like you, Eugene.

1042
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,494
No, I'm not cute.

1043
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:18,286
They wanted to have me drowned
when I was born,

1044
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,775
but the SPCA stopped them.

1045
01:08:20,883 --> 01:08:23,730
I know somebody else
that thinks you're cute.

1046
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:27,656
Oh, you mean your Bat Lady model?
I can't wait to meet her.

1047
01:08:28,051 --> 01:08:30,189
You will. She'll be dancing
at the Artists and Models Ball.

1048
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,664
You'll meet her then.

1049
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:33,835
Oh, you mean she dances, too,
like Bessie?

1050
01:08:33,938 --> 01:08:36,360
- Almost exactly like Bessie.
- Oh.

1051
01:08:36,466 --> 01:08:38,441
Now, how about trying
that Goosey Goose pose again?

1052
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:40,302
Oh, okay.

1053
01:08:52,403 --> 01:08:54,704
Okay, Anita. Take five.

1054
01:09:04,818 --> 01:09:07,568
- How's it going?
- Oh, pretty good.

1055
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:10,158
You've changed.

1056
01:09:10,258 --> 01:09:13,324
Now when I pose for you,
all you do is draw.

1057
01:09:14,322 --> 01:09:17,967
Rick! Rick! Rick!

1058
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:20,816
- Oh, yes.
- Come on. Please hurry.

1059
01:09:24,274 --> 01:09:26,478
Is that why you've changed?

1060
01:09:26,578 --> 01:09:29,131
You change. Go get dressed.

1061
01:09:29,235 --> 01:09:32,017
Come back tomorrow, the same time.

1062
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:33,773
It's Eugene. He was posing for me.

1063
01:09:33,874 --> 01:09:35,980
I think it's his sacroiliac.
He can't straighten up.

1064
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:38,187
Come on, quick! He can't straighten up.

1065
01:09:40,499 --> 01:09:42,091
Good afternoon,
Eureka Massage Parlour.

1066
01:09:42,194 --> 01:09:44,583
Our rub and steam
will make you dream.

1067
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:45,868
Just a minute, I'll check.

1068
01:09:45,971 --> 01:09:47,345
Bring him right in here. Right in here.

1069
01:09:47,443 --> 01:09:50,160
Yes, we can take you
this afternoon at 5:30. Bye.

1070
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:51,688
We don't need
your assistance now, son.

1071
01:09:51,794 --> 01:09:53,867
Just put him down.
Now, you run and have some alfalfa tea.

1072
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:55,912
We'll have him all fixed up in no time.

1073
01:09:56,979 --> 01:09:59,761
- Think nothing of it.
- Easy.

1074
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:07,080
- Hurt?
- No.

1075
01:10:08,466 --> 01:10:11,248
A little tougher than I thought.
What have you been eating, anyway?

1076
01:10:11,346 --> 01:10:12,688
Your diet's all wrong.

1077
01:10:30,675 --> 01:10:32,049
All fixed up.

1078
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,919
Oh, easy. Easy, please.

1079
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:50,920
Oh, pain. Oh, plenty of pain.

1080
01:10:53,842 --> 01:10:55,752
Oh, I gotta get new soles.

1081
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,530
Oh, easy. Easy.

1082
01:11:05,843 --> 01:11:07,752
Anyone for taffy?

1083
01:11:20,082 --> 01:11:21,871
Wait, no.

1084
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,517
Wait a second. No, lady.
Look, get this foot...

1085
01:11:25,618 --> 01:11:28,782
No, wait. This... Oh, my leg's falling off.
Oh, I'm sorry.

1086
01:11:28,883 --> 01:11:30,825
Wait, just hold everything.
One second, please.

1087
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:33,319
Lady, one second. Rick. Rick!

1088
01:11:33,426 --> 01:11:35,401
Wait one... My friend will...

1089
01:11:35,507 --> 01:11:36,521
- Rick!
- What is it?

1090
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:37,707
Here, you better get...

1091
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:40,428
- We're in trouble a little here.
- You're in trouble? Well, I'll help.

1092
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:41,959
Yeah, why don't you
put your foot under hers?

1093
01:11:42,066 --> 01:11:44,336
Brace her foot up. That's it, that's it.

1094
01:11:44,434 --> 01:11:45,841
- Just put your foot... Yeah.
- Under her?

1095
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:47,432
- Sit here, Rick, by leaning back.
- All right.

1096
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:48,619
That's it. Good.

1097
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:49,999
- That way?
- No, wait a second.

1098
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:51,560
- No?
- Come around this way.

1099
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:54,252
- This way?
- That's it. Now brace your foot up, over.

1100
01:11:54,355 --> 01:11:57,354
- Over. That's it.
- That ought to fix everything, huh?

1101
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:58,636
- Yeah.
- Sure.

1102
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:00,648
That's not working very good.

1103
01:12:00,754 --> 01:12:03,471
Lady, lady, would you help here?

1104
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:05,643
You just grab...
See my foot down there?

1105
01:12:05,746 --> 01:12:07,208
Just hold it. Pull it up. That's it.

1106
01:12:07,314 --> 01:12:09,648
Now get up on the table. Fine. Up and...

1107
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:11,721
Now come over.
Bring this foot around here.

1108
01:12:11,826 --> 01:12:14,412
That's good. Hold it there.
Now hold my foot.

1109
01:12:14,546 --> 01:12:16,848
And I may be able to slip this one out.
No, hold it.

1110
01:12:16,947 --> 01:12:18,572
Hold everything.
Let me slip this one out.

1111
01:12:18,674 --> 01:12:20,136
Rick, it's going to be all right.

1112
01:12:20,242 --> 01:12:22,925
- Sure it is.
- Wait, we'll get another lady.

1113
01:12:23,026 --> 01:12:25,033
- You better... Here. No.
- Sure, we need another lady.

1114
01:12:25,138 --> 01:12:26,829
Give me this hand. Hold on there.

1115
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,607
Now let go of that foot.
Good. Is there another lady?

1116
01:12:30,706 --> 01:12:32,975
That's fine. Here, you hold onto her.

1117
01:12:33,074 --> 01:12:36,587
Good, like that. Fine. Lady! One lady.
Here, could you get on the edge of the...

1118
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:37,967
- It's gonna be all right.
- I know. I'm fine.

1119
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:39,277
Get on the edge of the table. That's it.

1120
01:12:39,379 --> 01:12:41,615
Now, look.
Here, miss, just bend down over here.

1121
01:12:41,714 --> 01:12:45,063
Here. Give me your hand.
Good. Now hold onto him.

1122
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:46,910
That's fine. Now bring this leg over.

1123
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:48,651
That's fine. Bring that leg over.

1124
01:12:48,754 --> 01:12:51,023
No, bring this leg down here.

1125
01:12:51,122 --> 01:12:52,399
That's fine. That's it.

1126
01:12:52,498 --> 01:12:54,124
Now get... You... Look.

1127
01:12:54,227 --> 01:12:57,041
Just get that leg over in this side.

1128
01:12:57,138 --> 01:13:00,008
That's fine. Wait, no.
Bring it around there.

1129
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:03,016
Can you help her with this leg there?

1130
01:13:03,123 --> 01:13:04,649
Maybe if she...

1131
01:13:04,754 --> 01:13:09,740
Wait, I tell you what.
I'll see you at the apartment later, huh?

1132
01:13:11,155 --> 01:13:12,911
I don't think so. I may have lunch here.

1133
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:15,661
All right. See you later.
Oh, what a mess.

1134
01:13:20,403 --> 01:13:24,265
Wait a minute! Easy.
It's a dime. It's a dime.

1135
01:13:48,434 --> 01:13:51,696
That, gentlemen, is the final test
of our new power formula.

1136
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,641
We can safely predict
our nation will be the first

1137
01:13:54,738 --> 01:13:56,942
to break through
the Earth's gravitational pull

1138
01:13:57,043 --> 01:13:59,050
and establish a space station.

1139
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:02,863
Colonel Drury here has been in charge
of developing our secret power formula.

1140
01:14:02,962 --> 01:14:05,897
I'm  afraid it's not a secret
any longer, General Traynor.

1141
01:14:09,426 --> 01:14:12,426
"X34 minus 5R1"?

1142
01:14:13,394 --> 01:14:15,336
But that's half of our formula!

1143
01:14:15,474 --> 01:14:17,995
My son bought that
at the corner newsstand last night.

1144
01:14:18,098 --> 01:14:20,487
You can't buy a top secret
at a corner newsstand.

1145
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:22,350
The Murdock Publishing Company
in New York

1146
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:24,305
disagrees with you, General.

1147
01:14:24,979 --> 01:14:26,669
Get me the Secret Service
on the phone immediately.

1148
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:27,719
Yes, sir.

1149
01:14:27,826 --> 01:14:30,062
Yes, General,
I have the comic book before me.

1150
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:32,496
I'll put two my best men
on the assignment.

1151
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:36,075
This may be a clever way
of conveying our secrets to the enemy.

1152
01:14:36,178 --> 01:14:37,902
We must find out
if they have the remainder

1153
01:14:38,002 --> 01:14:39,912
of our space station formula.

1154
01:14:48,627 --> 01:14:52,238
Of course the United States wouldn't
publish top secrets in a comic book,

1155
01:14:52,338 --> 01:14:54,509
but the formula works to a point.

1156
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:57,512
It's a trap. We cannot take a chance.

1157
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:01,579
If this cartoonist has
the mathematic equations

1158
01:15:01,682 --> 01:15:05,228
to take a space station
beyond the Earth's atmosphere,

1159
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,988
we must take the chance.

1160
01:15:08,114 --> 01:15:09,521
All right.

1161
01:15:11,474 --> 01:15:14,289
I leave it to an expert in these matters.

1162
01:15:15,634 --> 01:15:19,595
My dear Sonia,
where a man is concerned,

1163
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:21,389
you have never failed.

1164
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:25,418
This time you have to work fast.
Get to him quickly, directly.

1165
01:15:25,906 --> 01:15:30,030
Become his friend,
his closest companion.

1166
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:31,661
Yes, gentlemen.

1167
01:15:31,762 --> 01:15:34,762
I am always their closest companion.

1168
01:16:04,306 --> 01:16:06,827
- Hello.
- Hello.

1169
01:16:07,122 --> 01:16:09,009
I'm looking for a man.

1170
01:16:09,746 --> 01:16:12,015
Well, they never let me
dress with the girls.

1171
01:16:12,146 --> 01:16:13,673
His name is Todd.

1172
01:16:14,258 --> 01:16:16,298
Oh, he isn't here. He's my roommate.

1173
01:16:16,402 --> 01:16:19,468
I'm Eugene Stackfull...
I mean, Fullstack.

1174
01:16:20,306 --> 01:16:22,695
Oh, here you are.

1175
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:26,057
Thank you.

1176
01:16:26,866 --> 01:16:28,971
- Will he be long?
- I don't know.

1177
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:30,895
Is there anything I can do?

1178
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,319
I doubt it.

1179
01:16:34,194 --> 01:16:35,601
I'll wait.

1180
01:16:39,538 --> 01:16:41,610
I'd like to stay
and check my thermometer,

1181
01:16:41,714 --> 01:16:44,714
but I have to go see a man
about a costume.

1182
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:51,341
Well, I tell you, we're a smash, Todd!

1183
01:16:51,442 --> 01:16:52,719
The presses are working overtime.

1184
01:16:52,818 --> 01:16:54,990
We're selling on the black market
in Boston.

1185
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:57,960
I told you that that Zuba was all girl.
Look at her.

1186
01:16:58,066 --> 01:17:00,074
By the way, you've met my cousin here,
haven't you?

1187
01:17:00,178 --> 01:17:01,520
When you meet her,
you meet your whole family.

1188
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:02,828
Family. I'm speaking of family items.

1189
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:04,620
Look at this.
The Vulture brass knuckles.

1190
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:06,958
It's guaranteed, no rust. Oh, yes.

1191
01:17:07,058 --> 01:17:08,269
And look at this, Rick.

1192
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,988
Right according to your specification,
just the way you drew it.

1193
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,905
The death-dealing
disintegrator atom gun.

1194
01:17:14,002 --> 01:17:14,984
Watch this.

1195
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:22,153
Real nice, Murdock. Very nice.
A couple more issues,

1196
01:17:22,258 --> 01:17:23,535
and you and I
will make them forget Hitler.

1197
01:17:23,634 --> 01:17:26,155
Now, wait a minute.
Don't get squeamish, Todd.

1198
01:17:26,258 --> 01:17:29,706
Now, why don't you and your daughter
and your niece and your cousin

1199
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:30,758
tell your wife off?

1200
01:17:30,866 --> 01:17:33,038
I'm through, Mr. Murdock.

1201
01:17:33,138 --> 01:17:35,505
I gotta go, go, go.

1202
01:17:37,266 --> 01:17:39,819
- Say goodbye to your uncle.
- But you...

1203
01:17:52,338 --> 01:17:53,647
What's going on down there?

1204
01:17:53,746 --> 01:17:56,113
Oh, Well, it seems like...

1205
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:59,822
It looks like Todd told Murdock off
and he's leaving.

1206
01:18:00,338 --> 01:18:03,272
Of course, I can't see so well
from this rear window.

1207
01:18:13,746 --> 01:18:15,917
- Todd?
- Yeah.

1208
01:18:18,706 --> 01:18:20,528
Secret Service?

1209
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:26,000
Look, I've been telling you.
Eugene dreams the space formula.

1210
01:18:26,098 --> 01:18:27,559
He doesn't know
what he's saying in his sleep.

1211
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:29,640
We've got to know
whether he's got the rest of that formula

1212
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:31,633
tucked away in his subconscious or not.

1213
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:33,104
Go with Todd.
Check on Fullstack's dreams.

1214
01:18:33,202 --> 01:18:34,893
- Take the tape recorder.
- Oh, no, look.

1215
01:18:34,994 --> 01:18:38,474
If they go with me, then I gotta go
tell Eugene that I'm doing "The Vulture".

1216
01:18:38,578 --> 01:18:40,268
Then we'll be through as pals.

1217
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:43,370
Can't they come after the ball,
when he's asleep?

1218
01:18:43,474 --> 01:18:44,522
All right,
but I'm holding you responsible.

1219
01:18:44,626 --> 01:18:46,601
Don't you let Fullstack out of your sight.

1220
01:18:46,706 --> 01:18:48,648
We don't want him
dreaming for our enemies.

1221
01:18:48,754 --> 01:18:50,445
Well, I'll stick with him, sir.

1222
01:18:50,546 --> 01:18:52,881
I appreciate your cooperation, Todd.

1223
01:18:52,977 --> 01:18:55,050
Who knows? The President
might invite you to the White House.

1224
01:18:55,154 --> 01:18:56,942
- Oh, I doubt that.
- Why?

1225
01:18:57,042 --> 01:18:58,569
I shoot in the low 70s.

1226
01:19:00,882 --> 01:19:02,922
Nothing. If he has
the rest of the formula,

1227
01:19:03,026 --> 01:19:04,619
he must keep it in his head.

1228
01:19:14,642 --> 01:19:17,130
- Get him to the laboratory tonight.
- Don't worry.

1229
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:31,434
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

1230
01:19:31,858 --> 01:19:32,970
Mr. Todd?

1231
01:19:34,162 --> 01:19:36,398
If I'm in the right apartment,
I'm Mr. Todd.

1232
01:19:36,498 --> 01:19:40,720
I am Mrs. Thomas Curtis.
Your roommate let me in. He left.

1233
01:19:41,394 --> 01:19:43,466
You know, that's the smartest thing
he's ever done.

1234
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:47,945
I've heard what a fine artist you are,
and I came to see your paintings.

1235
01:19:48,562 --> 01:19:50,449
Oh, it's beautiful.

1236
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:53,479
lovely.

1237
01:19:55,346 --> 01:19:56,655
I like them very much.

1238
01:19:56,754 --> 01:19:58,542
Why, thank you. That makes two of us.

1239
01:19:58,642 --> 01:20:01,675
You see, I would like
to have my portrait painted,

1240
01:20:01,778 --> 01:20:05,608
and after seeing your work,
I am sure you could do me very well.

1241
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:07,470
Well, thank you very much.
I'll do my best.

1242
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:09,904
Now, what size portrait would you want,
full-length or bust?

1243
01:20:10,002 --> 01:20:14,312
Well, I had full-length in mind.
I'll show you what I mean.

1244
01:20:14,482 --> 01:20:17,481
You see, I would like to give it
to my third husband

1245
01:20:17,586 --> 01:20:19,920
as a surprise present.

1246
01:20:24,626 --> 01:20:26,765
My congratulations to all three of them.

1247
01:20:26,866 --> 01:20:29,768
What do you think of this pose,
Mr. Todd?

1248
01:20:30,482 --> 01:20:32,621
You could do a big calendar business.

1249
01:20:32,721 --> 01:20:34,664
Well, if you don't approve,
what do you suggest?

1250
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:35,980
Oh, I'm not knocking it.

1251
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:40,817
I think if you had this arm up
a little there...

1252
01:20:40,914 --> 01:20:42,157
That's it.

1253
01:20:42,769 --> 01:20:45,552
And head down.

1254
01:20:46,194 --> 01:20:48,911
Yes, yes. I like this much better.

1255
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,050
You see,I want something intimate,

1256
01:20:51,154 --> 01:20:53,358
something I can hang over the bar.

1257
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:57,003
Well, with you hanging there,
they won't need any liquor in the bottles.

1258
01:20:57,106 --> 01:21:00,008
Could you start working on me
right now, Mr. Todd?

1259
01:21:00,114 --> 01:21:01,968
Don't you think it's a little late for that?

1260
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:03,822
We could go to my house.

1261
01:21:03,922 --> 01:21:07,021
My husband is away,
and we wouldn't be disturbed.

1262
01:21:07,122 --> 01:21:10,570
We would be quite alone,
just the two of us.

1263
01:21:10,674 --> 01:21:12,015
- Just the two of us?
- Hey, Rick!

1264
01:21:12,114 --> 01:21:13,969
Who's gonna put the ice on my neck?

1265
01:21:14,994 --> 01:21:16,456
Hey, Rick!

1266
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:19,729
If I have a neck left.
Just a minute, honey.

1267
01:21:19,826 --> 01:21:22,247
There'll be a slight intermission,
Mrs. Curtis.

1268
01:21:24,466 --> 01:21:25,676
What...

1269
01:21:42,034 --> 01:21:43,408
Oh, hello, darling.

1270
01:21:43,505 --> 01:21:44,553
Hi.

1271
01:21:44,658 --> 01:21:46,568
- Where's Eugene?
- Eugene?

1272
01:21:46,706 --> 01:21:48,080
I thought I heard you
talking to someone.

1273
01:21:48,178 --> 01:21:51,790
Eugene. Oh, well,
he's taking off his clothes,

1274
01:21:51,889 --> 01:21:53,482
and he's taking a shower.

1275
01:21:53,586 --> 01:21:55,691
Oh, well, ask him
what he's going to wear tonight.

1276
01:21:55,794 --> 01:21:58,095
Tell him the Bat Lady wants to know
so she can recognise him.

1277
01:21:58,194 --> 01:21:59,852
Okay. I'll ask him.

1278
01:22:08,754 --> 01:22:12,103
- Hello, Abigail.
- Eugene! You're taking a bath.

1279
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:13,900
Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm gonna wear
my new costume.

1280
01:22:14,002 --> 01:22:15,344
It's the first time
I ever had my own head.

1281
01:22:15,441 --> 01:22:18,409
- How is that, my own head?
- Oh, no, you're taking a bath right now.

1282
01:22:18,514 --> 01:22:21,449
Fine, Abigail, but don't rush me.
I'll take a bath.

1283
01:22:21,553 --> 01:22:24,815
Eugene, Abby wants to know
what you're gonna wear tonight.

1284
01:22:24,914 --> 01:22:28,329
Oh, I'm going to wear my...
Who's he talking to?

1285
01:22:29,874 --> 01:22:33,584
Yes, who was he talking to?

1286
01:22:33,681 --> 01:22:35,656
All right. I'll tell her.

1287
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:43,792
Well, what did he say, dear?

1288
01:22:43,889 --> 01:22:45,645
Well, he's gonna wear
his Freddie Field Mouse costume.

1289
01:22:45,746 --> 01:22:47,306
Oh, why don't you
let me talk to Eugene?

1290
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:50,574
Oh, no, Abigail. He's taking a shower.
You'll get all... You'll get all wet.

1291
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:53,805
He's taking a shower. You'll get all wet.

1292
01:22:54,514 --> 01:22:56,302
You got dry in a hurry, didn't you?

1293
01:22:56,402 --> 01:22:58,377
There's no one in there.
Just my mother, see?

1294
01:22:58,482 --> 01:23:00,937
It's a surprise.
She's from Steubendale, remember?

1295
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:03,627
Oh, mother.

1296
01:23:03,762 --> 01:23:06,445
- Mother?
- Well, I can explain this, Abby.

1297
01:23:06,546 --> 01:23:07,920
Not to me, You can't.

1298
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:11,111
Watch out for the bit
with the suntan oil, Mother.

1299
01:23:11,217 --> 01:23:12,494
Mother?

1300
01:23:19,153 --> 01:23:21,193
Entertain Mrs. Curtis
while I talk with Abigail.

1301
01:23:21,298 --> 01:23:22,672
Entertain her?

1302
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:27,145
Wow! Here we are.
You just sit right there.

1303
01:23:28,818 --> 01:23:32,746
No, not that way. Do your
Boy Scout bird calls or something.

1304
01:23:37,778 --> 01:23:41,640
What bird call are you particularly
interested in, Mrs. Curtis?

1305
01:23:41,745 --> 01:23:45,161
Do you know the Hungarian kiwi?

1306
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:47,312
The Hungarian kiwi?

1307
01:23:47,409 --> 01:23:49,133
Oh, you mean the Hungarian peewee.

1308
01:23:49,234 --> 01:23:51,600
In Hungary, we don't have peewees.

1309
01:23:51,697 --> 01:23:53,421
We only have kiwis.

1310
01:23:53,521 --> 01:23:54,950
Oh, in Hungary,
you don't have peewees?

1311
01:23:55,058 --> 01:23:57,229
You only have kiwis.

1312
01:23:57,361 --> 01:23:59,052
You don't know the Hungarian kiwi?

1313
01:23:59,154 --> 01:24:03,147
No, I don't know the Hungarian kiwi.
The Hungarian peewee, I know.

1314
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:04,330
- Good.
- Good.

1315
01:24:05,202 --> 01:24:08,268
To tell you the truth,
I mostly know the Steubendale bird,

1316
01:24:08,369 --> 01:24:11,020
like, the pizza bird that goes...

1317
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,959
She's gotta be a phony, Mr. Samuels.

1318
01:24:19,058 --> 01:24:21,360
Right off the bat, she turns on
her heater and goes overboard

1319
01:24:21,457 --> 01:24:23,465
to try to get me to go to her place.

1320
01:24:23,569 --> 01:24:25,544
I played along
till I had a chance to call you.

1321
01:24:25,649 --> 01:24:27,176
Very smart, Todd.

1322
01:24:27,282 --> 01:24:28,591
If she didn't show any interest
in Eugene,

1323
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,380
she doesn't know he has the formula.

1324
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,042
Now, keep playing along.

1325
01:24:32,146 --> 01:24:34,666
There may be others with her
and we can get them all.

1326
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,111
Here's what you do.

1327
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:38,381
Tonight after
the Artists and Models Ball...

1328
01:24:39,857 --> 01:24:42,607
Well, what if Mrs. Curtis
doesn't want to go to the ball?

1329
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:46,059
What?

1330
01:24:46,802 --> 01:24:49,769
Well, I can't do that, Mr. Samuels.
I'm in love with another girl.

1331
01:24:52,977 --> 01:24:55,912
It's my duty
to the United States of America?

1332
01:24:56,017 --> 01:24:57,392
Are you sure?

1333
01:24:59,505 --> 01:25:03,247
If I'd known that, I'd have joined the FBI
instead of the Kangaroo Patrol.

1334
01:25:04,049 --> 01:25:06,897
Okay. Oh, boy.

1335
01:25:23,122 --> 01:25:24,049
What are you doing,

1336
01:25:24,146 --> 01:25:25,837
bucking for a nosebleed or something?

1337
01:25:25,937 --> 01:25:27,825
I can't keep this dickey down, Ricky.

1338
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:31,402
Anybody ever tell you
that dickeys went out with horse cars?

1339
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:33,709
If you're going to rent, why didn't you
rent a modern dress shirt,

1340
01:25:33,809 --> 01:25:35,784
something, like, about 1922?

1341
01:25:35,889 --> 01:25:37,166
There. That ought to do it.

1342
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:39,054
Thank you very...

1343
01:25:39,154 --> 01:25:40,463
Thank you very much, Rick.

1344
01:25:40,562 --> 01:25:41,576
I gotta look real nice,

1345
01:25:41,682 --> 01:25:43,886
'cause I'm gonna meet the Bat Lady
for the first time tonight.

1346
01:25:43,986 --> 01:25:45,000
You know, if she's wearing a bustle,

1347
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:46,993
you two are gonna make
a dandy-looking pair.

1348
01:25:47,089 --> 01:25:48,431
- Yeah.
- There.

1349
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:49,457
There.

1350
01:25:50,706 --> 01:25:53,040
What am I gonna do, Rick?
If the Bat Lady feels like kissing me,

1351
01:25:53,138 --> 01:25:55,210
every time she'll come near me,
she'll get an uppercut.

1352
01:25:55,314 --> 01:25:57,070
I got an idea. I got an idea.

1353
01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:00,715
Why don't you button the dickey
on the top of the shorts here? See?

1354
01:26:00,818 --> 01:26:01,930
Well, let me do it. You can't get to it.

1355
01:26:02,034 --> 01:26:03,627
- Go ahead.
- Wait a minute.

1356
01:26:03,729 --> 01:26:04,657
Here? This button, huh?

1357
01:26:04,754 --> 01:26:06,576
Yeah, put it right there.
That'll hold everything down.

1358
01:26:06,674 --> 01:26:07,950
All right.

1359
01:26:08,402 --> 01:26:10,060
Oh, yeah. Hey, thanks, Rick.

1360
01:26:10,162 --> 01:26:12,267
Good. Now hurry up.
We're going to be late.

1361
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:13,678
- Hurry up.
- All right.

1362
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:16,744
I'll be right there,
as soon as I put my shoes on.

1363
01:26:16,849 --> 01:26:19,118
I wonder if I can walk at all with this.

1364
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:21,132
Something's crooked.

1365
01:26:22,129 --> 01:26:25,425
I think something's... Wait, this way.

1366
01:26:25,553 --> 01:26:29,350
Over there. That's it.
Something's pulling me. Yeah.

1367
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:31,658
I'll be right there, Rick.

1368
01:26:48,978 --> 01:26:51,280
Hey, Bessie, you were great.

1369
01:26:51,602 --> 01:26:53,129
It's just the numerology.

1370
01:26:57,233 --> 01:27:00,495
Hurry up, girls. Let's go. Step on it.
"Artists and Models" number.

1371
01:27:00,594 --> 01:27:02,416
Todd, Fullstack, you're on.

1372
01:27:03,953 --> 01:27:05,841
- And we'll be pals forever?
- Pals forever.

1373
01:27:05,937 --> 01:27:06,920
- Scout's honour?
- Scout's honour.

1374
01:27:07,025 --> 01:27:08,334
- Kangaroo Patrol.
- Kangaroo Patrol.

1375
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:09,416
Pouches forever.

1376
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:12,271
- Hippity-hop, hippity-hop, kangaroo.
- Hippity-hop, hippity-hop, kangaroo.

1377
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:15,119
- Hippity-hop, hippity-hop, kangaroo.
- Hippity-hop, hippity-hop, kangaroo.

1378
01:27:15,217 --> 01:27:18,065
- Hippity-hop, hippity-hop, kangaroo.
- Hippity-hop, hippity-hop, kangaroo.

1379
01:27:18,161 --> 01:27:20,878
- K-A-N-G-A-R-O-O!
- K-A-N-G-A-R-O-O!

1380
01:27:27,314 --> 01:27:29,735
- Are you ready?
- In a minute.

1381
01:28:01,905 --> 01:28:04,523
<i>All you very lovely ladies</i>

1382
01:28:04,625 --> 01:28:07,047
<i>In your very fancy frocks</i>

1383
01:28:07,153 --> 01:28:09,095
<i>And you fellas with the palettes</i>

1384
01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:11,623
<i>In your most artistic smocks</i>

1385
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:13,388
<i>Use your thumb to get perspective</i>

1386
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:16,653
<i>Of a world that's drab and grey</i>

1387
01:28:16,753 --> 01:28:18,640
<i>Add a lot of colour</i>

1388
01:28:18,737 --> 01:28:20,625
<i>Colour</i>

1389
01:28:20,753 --> 01:28:25,707
<i>And frame it just that way</i>

1390
01:28:28,785 --> 01:28:32,527
<i>You can trace the mystery
of ancient history</i>

1391
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:34,927
<i>Through art of artists and their models</i>

1392
01:28:35,026 --> 01:28:36,008
<i>Models</i>

1393
01:28:36,113 --> 01:28:39,113
<i>You can comb through
the Rome Coliseum</i>

1394
01:28:39,218 --> 01:28:41,771
<i>In the rear of your nearest museum</i>

1395
01:28:41,873 --> 01:28:42,822
<i>Museum</i>

1396
01:28:42,929 --> 01:28:44,620
<i>There's the Mona Lisa</i>

1397
01:28:44,721 --> 01:28:46,380
<i>The Tower of Pisa</i>

1398
01:28:46,481 --> 01:28:48,903
<i>A cowhand's daughter out in Texas</i>

1399
01:28:49,009 --> 01:28:49,958
<i>Texas</i>

1400
01:28:50,065 --> 01:28:52,935
<i>And there's modern art to see</i>

1401
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:56,718
<i>That makes you wonder
what the heck it's meant to be</i>

1402
01:28:56,817 --> 01:28:58,573
<i>On the streets of Montmartre</i>

1403
01:28:58,674 --> 01:29:00,299
<i>There's a Frenchy kind of art</i>

1404
01:29:00,402 --> 01:29:03,697
<i>That is strictly for the tourists
from the sticks</i>

1405
01:29:03,793 --> 01:29:07,306
<i>And those wise Greenwich guys
really open up your eyes</i>

1406
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:09,417
<i>Painting portraits
of their pretty little chicks</i>

1407
01:29:09,521 --> 01:29:10,765
<i>Pretty little chicks</i>

1408
01:29:10,865 --> 01:29:14,477
<i>So to each creator and imitator</i>

1409
01:29:14,577 --> 01:29:17,774
<i>Who daubs and dabbles
with the brushes</i>

1410
01:29:17,874 --> 01:29:19,597
<i>To the guys that draw the bunnies</i>

1411
01:29:19,698 --> 01:29:21,454
<i>For the Sunday morning funnies</i>

1412
01:29:21,553 --> 01:29:24,619
<i>And brighten up the world today</i>

1413
01:29:24,721 --> 01:29:26,314
<i>And to every girl that poses</i>

1414
01:29:26,418 --> 01:29:28,360
<i>And to every Grandma Moses</i>

1415
01:29:28,465 --> 01:29:31,465
<i>We'd like to tip the old beret</i>

1416
01:29:33,265 --> 01:29:35,370
<i>Let me warn you, stranger</i>

1417
01:29:35,473 --> 01:29:37,229
<i>That red means danger</i>

1418
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:40,679
<i>Beware of any gal that wears it</i>

1419
01:29:40,785 --> 01:29:44,397
<i>I agree she may be very gracious</i>

1420
01:29:44,497 --> 01:29:47,978
<i>But you'll find
that she's kind of flirtatious</i>

1421
01:29:48,081 --> 01:29:51,856
<i>Oh, I'd like to pilot a gal in violet</i>

1422
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:55,248
<i>A shrinking violet is my pleasure</i>

1423
01:29:55,345 --> 01:29:58,662
<i>Hear my heart go whoop-de-doo</i>

1424
01:29:58,769 --> 01:30:02,631
<i>To any baby dressed in periwinkle blue</i>

1425
01:30:02,737 --> 01:30:04,526
<i>If a girl's wearing lime</i>

1426
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:06,316
<i>You can squeeze her every time</i>

1427
01:30:06,417 --> 01:30:09,865
<i>For a lime is something
anyone can squeeze</i>

1428
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:13,548
<i>Any gal wearing green
makes a most enchanting queen</i>

1429
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:16,497
<i>She's the kind of queen
who always aims to please</i>

1430
01:30:17,361 --> 01:30:21,256
<i>Oh, I'm really sold on a gal with gold on</i>

1431
01:30:21,361 --> 01:30:24,525
<i>If I could find her, what a treasure</i>

1432
01:30:24,626 --> 01:30:26,480
<i>To a gal that's wearing yellow</i>

1433
01:30:26,577 --> 01:30:28,465
<i>I'm a very mellow fellow</i>

1434
01:30:28,562 --> 01:30:31,878
<i>This shade of blue is just my kind</i>

1435
01:30:31,985 --> 01:30:36,841
<i>You will never hear me knocking
any pink that's really shocking</i>

1436
01:30:40,657 --> 01:30:44,269
<i>I think we're going colourblind</i>

1437
01:31:44,401 --> 01:31:47,947
<i>You can trace the mystery

<i>Today</i>

1465
01:33:38,769 --> 01:33:40,973
I gotta get into my other costume
to meet the Bat Lady.

1466
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:42,732
- Hurry up.
- Here, take that off.

1467
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:43,761
All right.

1468
01:33:51,345 --> 01:33:53,766
Get him down the back elevator
immediately.

1469
01:33:53,873 --> 01:33:55,531
Leave it to me.

1470
01:34:04,113 --> 01:34:05,706
Hey, you're stepping on my tail!

1471
01:34:05,809 --> 01:34:07,948
The Bat... The Bat...

1472
01:34:08,049 --> 01:34:10,602
- Bat Lady!
- Come to me, darling.

1473
01:34:11,377 --> 01:34:15,403
- Come on. There we go.
- Hello, Henrietta.

1474
01:34:16,561 --> 01:34:17,935
Eugene?

1475
01:34:20,145 --> 01:34:22,283
Hey, Eugene, what are you doing?

1476
01:34:22,385 --> 01:34:26,608
Well, if ask me, he's making time
down the back elevator with a bat.

1477
01:34:26,705 --> 01:34:29,704
Oh, wonderful.
He went with Bessie. That's great.

1478
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:36,107
- Bessie! What happened?
- Where's that dame?

1479
01:34:36,209 --> 01:34:37,867
She stole my clothes.

1480
01:34:41,137 --> 01:34:44,301
- They've gone.
- Whoa! I can't go out there like this.

1481
01:34:44,401 --> 01:34:45,546
Put this on.

1482
01:34:48,305 --> 01:34:51,567
- Did a bat and a fat rat come out?
- They just left in that foreign job.

1483
01:34:51,665 --> 01:34:54,828
Come on. Let's get going.
Bessie! Hurry!

1484
01:34:54,929 --> 01:34:56,620
- Coming.
- Come on.

1485
01:35:28,529 --> 01:35:30,384
Here we are, darling.

1486
01:35:30,481 --> 01:35:32,902
Oh, that's nice.

1487
01:35:33,585 --> 01:35:35,822
Yeah, but where are we?

1488
01:35:35,921 --> 01:35:38,256
Where we can be alone, darling.

1489
01:35:39,793 --> 01:35:42,510
Wow! What a place to grow orchids.

1490
01:35:42,609 --> 01:35:45,326
Oh, darling, you look so tired.

1491
01:35:45,425 --> 01:35:48,807
Why don't we go upstairs
where you can take a nice nap?

1492
01:35:48,913 --> 01:35:52,109
Your voice sounds very familiar.
I think we met someplace before.

1493
01:35:52,209 --> 01:35:54,118
Here. Now, get to the nearest phone,
call the Secret Service,

1494
01:35:54,225 --> 01:35:56,297
- tell them where we are. Come on.
- Yes, sir.

1495
01:35:57,329 --> 01:35:59,304
This sure is a cosy place you have here.

1496
01:35:59,409 --> 01:36:01,198
This is our little nest.

1497
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:04,712
You could breed locomotives
in this little nest.

1498
01:36:13,841 --> 01:36:15,663
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

1499
01:36:15,761 --> 01:36:19,023
Just get me a new liver, that's all.
Come on. We gotta get over here.

1500
01:36:20,081 --> 01:36:22,951
Come, darling. Let's go upstairs.
Come on.

1501
01:36:23,057 --> 01:36:26,538
Come, come. Come on.

1502
01:36:26,641 --> 01:36:27,656
Oh, boy!

1503
01:36:27,761 --> 01:36:29,136
Come on.

1504
01:36:30,065 --> 01:36:31,407
Come on.

1505
01:36:32,497 --> 01:36:33,871
There.

1506
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:36,233
Here we are.

1507
01:36:37,681 --> 01:36:39,339
There.

1508
01:36:39,441 --> 01:36:42,757
Oh, you look so tired.
Let me help you with this.

1509
01:36:42,865 --> 01:36:44,207
You need some rest.

1510
01:36:44,561 --> 01:36:47,757
And by the way, what are you keeping
that mask on for, Miss Bat Lady?

1511
01:36:47,857 --> 01:36:50,312
Mystery lends enchantment.

1512
01:36:50,448 --> 01:36:52,237
Well, if I want mystery, I watch "Dragnet".

1513
01:36:52,337 --> 01:36:55,020
First we'll have a drink, darling.

1514
01:36:55,121 --> 01:36:57,128
Here, sit down. I'll be right back.

1515
01:36:57,233 --> 01:36:59,600
I'll have celery tonic on the rocks.

1516
01:37:07,921 --> 01:37:09,547
This will do it.

1517
01:37:17,265 --> 01:37:20,080
To us, darling.

1518
01:37:22,769 --> 01:37:25,868
To our troubles.
May they never be little ones.

1519
01:37:27,792 --> 01:37:28,905
Are you wearing that mask

1520
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:31,725
because there's something wrong
with your nose, possibly?

1521
01:37:31,825 --> 01:37:34,214
There's nothing wrong with my lips.

1522
01:37:42,033 --> 01:37:44,041
- There's something wrong.
- What?

1523
01:37:44,145 --> 01:37:47,658
Well, when Bessie kisses me,
the tops of my shoes pop open.

1524
01:37:47,761 --> 01:37:50,062
- Would you mind if I tried again?
- No.

1525
01:37:50,161 --> 01:37:51,787
Thank you.

1526
01:37:55,888 --> 01:37:59,980
I'm sorry. Bessie's the one. Sorry.

1527
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,757
Well, then I wish you all the luck.
Here is to Bessie.

1528
01:38:03,857 --> 01:38:06,443
I'll drink to that. And you're a good loser,
I don't mind telling you.

1529
01:38:06,544 --> 01:38:07,657
A real good loser.

1530
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,062
To Bessie Sparrowbush.

1531
01:38:16,561 --> 01:38:18,568
Well, thank you very much for the drink.

1532
01:38:18,672 --> 01:38:20,745
- It was wonderful.
- You're welcome.

1533
01:38:20,848 --> 01:38:22,277
- Good night.
- Night.

1534
01:38:45,489 --> 01:38:46,918
He's dreaming.

1535
01:38:50,417 --> 01:38:54,672
Goosey Goosey, 221.
Freddie Freddie, 711.

1536
01:38:54,769 --> 01:38:56,973
Goosey Goosey, Freddie Freddie.

1537
01:38:57,072 --> 01:38:59,942
What's this "Goosey Goosey,
Freddie Freddie"?

1538
01:39:07,057 --> 01:39:10,286
Goosey Goosey lives
at 221 Appleseed Avenue,

1539
01:39:10,385 --> 01:39:11,879
on the corner of Prune Street,

1540
01:39:11,984 --> 01:39:14,919
and Freddie Freddie lives
at 711 Cornfield Place

1541
01:39:15,025 --> 01:39:17,163
between Succotash Street
and Corn Pone Place.

1542
01:39:20,785 --> 01:39:23,534
Eugene, wake up! Eugie, wake up!

1543
01:39:23,921 --> 01:39:27,499
You're sleepy. So sleepy.

1544
01:39:27,729 --> 01:39:30,118
- Oh, sleepy.
- They're in the garden. Hurry up.

1545
01:39:32,913 --> 01:39:34,320
He's up there.

1546
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:51,951
Zuba comes after Vincent.

1547
01:39:52,048 --> 01:39:53,707
She sinks her teeth
into his goose feathers.

1548
01:39:53,808 --> 01:39:55,848
"What is the formula?" she asks.

1549
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:01,452
She's hurting Vincent's mousetrap.
He has to tell. He has to tell.

1550
01:40:01,552 --> 01:40:04,619
- The secret formula is...
- Kangaroo Patrol!

1551
01:40:04,721 --> 01:40:06,826
Kangaroo Patrol! Kangaroo Patrol!

1552
01:40:06,929 --> 01:40:11,239
K-A-N-G-A-R-O-O!

1553
01:40:14,193 --> 01:40:17,192
Ivan! Kurt! Otto! They're up here.

1554
01:40:21,041 --> 01:40:22,285
Sorry, we don't need any.

1555
01:40:27,664 --> 01:40:29,933
Don't shoot.
Remember, we need his dream.

1556
01:40:30,033 --> 01:40:31,080
Where did they go?

1557
01:40:31,185 --> 01:40:33,902
They took him away.
He was yelling "kangaroo".

1558
01:40:34,001 --> 01:40:35,888
Spread out. Find them.

1559
01:40:40,048 --> 01:40:43,082
K-A-N-G-A-R-O-O-O!

1560
01:40:43,184 --> 01:40:45,803
K-A-N-G-A-R-O-O-O-O-O.

1561
01:41:05,008 --> 01:41:07,212
They're up here. Hurry!

1562
01:41:41,777 --> 01:41:43,882
Help! Get me out of here!

1563
01:42:09,584 --> 01:42:12,781
Oh, Eugene! Eugene!

1564
01:42:14,065 --> 01:42:16,301
Eugene, Eugene, Eugene.

1565
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,669
Eugene, please, wake up.

1566
01:42:23,601 --> 01:42:25,706
There goes the Sagittarius.

1567
01:42:54,929 --> 01:42:56,270
Very good.

1568
01:43:06,928 --> 01:43:07,856
No!

1569
01:43:24,624 --> 01:43:26,413
Come on. We'll just make it.

1570
01:43:26,513 --> 01:43:30,407
<i>When you pretend</i>

1571
01:43:30,513 --> 01:43:34,953
<i>The world is gonna shine</i>

1572
01:43:35,057 --> 01:43:36,682
<i>Gee whiz!</i>

1573
01:43:37,456 --> 01:43:39,279
<i>Divine</i>

1574
01:43:39,376 --> 01:43:43,468
<i>And things turn out just fine</i>

1575
01:43:43,568 --> 01:43:45,673
<i>She's his</i>

1576
01:43:45,776 --> 01:43:48,329
<i>You're mine</i>

1577
01:43:48,433 --> 01:43:51,335
<i>There always comes a time</i>

1578
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,480
<i>For wedding bells to chime</i>

1579
01:43:53,585 --> 01:43:58,407
<i>That's true, my friend</i>

1580
01:43:58,512 --> 01:44:02,767
<i>For life is filled with happy endings</i>

1581
01:44:02,864 --> 01:44:06,545
<i>When you pretend</i>
