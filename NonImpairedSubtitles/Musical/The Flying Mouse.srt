l want to fly.

22
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:15,335
Oh, a mouse
was never meant to fly.

00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,642
Think carefully! Beware!

00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:28,786
then you shall have a pair.

27
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:46,823
Hello there, brother.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

A mouse?!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

30
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:57,433
No mouse can fly.
They ain't got wings.

31
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:00,442
So if you ain't a bat--
Ha ha ha ha ha!

32
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:02,444
You're nothing.
Think of that.

A mouse? Ha ha!

Don't you like to fly?

48
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:17,819
l'm not a mouse.

49
00:08:17,854 --> 00:08:20,584
l wish that l could die.

50
00:08:20,623 --> 00:08:24,081
Come, come, my little friend.
Cheer up.

51
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:25,787
