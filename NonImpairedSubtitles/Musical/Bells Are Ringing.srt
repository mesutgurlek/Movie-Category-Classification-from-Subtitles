00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,434
Can l take a message for Mr. Moss?

65
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,270

for hím to tahe me to the races!

66
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:08,103
l can't spend my whole lífe
waítíng for hím to take me to the racest

67
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,101
For heaven's sake.

68
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,867
''The races!''

69
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:15,102
That's all he needs
is to be taken to the races.

70
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,501
As if he hasn't got enough trouble now.

71
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,967
Ella.

72
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,268
When are you gonna stop
worrying about that playboy?

73
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,302
He's not a playboy.
He's a very talented playwright.

74
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:29,402
All he does is play. he never writes.

75
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,067
l beg your pardon?

76
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:36,538
He and his partner have written most of
the successful successes on Broadway.

77
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,868
So. what's his problem?

78
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,201
-His partner left him.
-So?

79
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:44,067
He has to write alone.

80
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,935
So let him write alone. Big deal.

81
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,236
Don't you see what that
can mean to somebody?

82
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,603
He's terrified that he might not
be able to make it alone.

83
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,034
-He's sensitive. he's creative.
-Hi. girls.

84
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,802
Hi. He's artistic.

85
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,535
Oh. Ella.

86
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,568
Look at this.

87
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,503
Miss Number 63 is canceling service...

88
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,235
...because she's marrying Mr. Number 78.

89
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,635
Oh. how wonderful.

90
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,801
l had nothing to do with it.

91
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:24,637
l happened to know that Miss Number 63
wanted to mate her female Siamese cat.

92
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,570
And l also knew that Mr. Number 78
had a male Siamese cat.

93
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:31,235
So l told her. and she called him...

94
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,202
-...and they all got together.
-The fact remains...

95
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:37,836
...we now have one account
instead of two.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,402
Ella. l have told you a thousand times...

97
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:43,702
...just give and take messages. That's all.

98
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:48,670
Don't be so helpful to the subscribers.
It could get us into trouble.

99
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,469
Why don't you help yourself
and get yourself a man?

100
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:56,403
Ella. what are you doing here?
l made that date for you at 5:OO.

101
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:59,869
-Do l have to go?
-Do you have...?

102
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:05,303
Ella. this is the sixth young man
l've dredged up this year.

103
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:09,369
He's a very nice young man.
He's the nephew of my dearest friend...

104
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,935
...so please make an effort.

105
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,035
All right.

106
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,201
Ella.

107
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,334
All right.

108
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:31,804
Don't forget to wake Jeffrey Moss up
in time for his appointment.

109
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:40,870
All that yakety-yak at the board. yet
every time she goes out with a real fella...

110
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,435
-...she clams up like an oyster.
-She's a little shy.

111
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,502
-Her fingers turn into thumbs.
-lt takes a little while--

112
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,268
-She knocks things over. spills drinks.
-Maybe--

113
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:53,770
The only thing she
hasn't done is catch on fire.

114
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,201
Miss Pringle's residence.

115
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,037
l couldn't possibly hold a table
for that length of time. l have reservations--

116
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,735
-Let me look.
-Captain. captain.

117
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:07,035
-One moment.
-Will we get our table soon?

118
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,902
-l'll check as soon as l can.
-We've been waiting.

119
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:13,002
l'm afraid my date
is going to die of starvation.

120
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,135
-l'll check as soon as l can.
-Would you. please? Thank you.

121
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,903
Hello. Mr. Chase?
Yes. 10:1 5. a party of four.

122
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:23,736
-That's the best l can do.
-l seem to have picked out the wrong place.

123
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:26,569
They're so busy here. we may
have to do our own cooking.

124
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:30,870
Anyway. we have these. Now. if we
could just get our table. Captain?

125
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,669
You're being an awfully
good sport about all this.

126
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,834
Well. Iet's have a toast to friendship.

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,768
Friendship is the gift of the--

128
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,801
-l'm sorry.
-Oh. l'm sorry.

129
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:44,401
Just when l'm trying
to make a good impression.

130
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:46,801
-Oh. l'll get it.
-Oh. no. l'll get--

131
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,901
-Oh. it's--
-Sorry. l--

132
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,767
l hope l didn't hurt you.

133
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:54,236
You'll think l'm an awful oaf.

134
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,335
l'd better get another drink.

135
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,668
-Oh. no. take this one.
-No. you keep that.

136
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,569
-No. no. no.
-Let's share it. then.

137
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,701
-All right.
-You take the first sip.

138
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,902
lt's getting so late.
l wish they'd-- Oh. captain.

139
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,034
Oh. it is getting late.

140
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,535
Oh. l missed him again.

141
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,202
You know. l'm not usually this clumsy.

142
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,768
lf you wanna know the truth.
l'm a little nervous.

143
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,035
Blind dates don't usually
turn out this well.

144
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,769
And l approached this date
with some trepidation.

145
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,968
l've had some terrible experiences.

146
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:31,503
You know. my aunt. bless her.
but she and some of her friends...

147
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,502
...including. if you'll forgive me.
your cousin Sue...

148
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,235
...have come up with
some of the most awful dog--

149
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,035
Excuse me. some of the strangest girls.

150
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,468
So when you showed up....

151
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,768
You know. you're a good listener.

152
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:48,734
That's an art in itself.

153
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,602
Helps to build the other person's ego.

154
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,436
l guess you must be thinking
that l'm kind of garrulous...

155
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,269
...the way l've monopolized
the conversation. but--

156
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:01,702
-Oh. captain.
-l'm checking on your table right now. sir.

157
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,468
Oh. thank you. that's--

158
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,568
Oh. l'm sorry.

159
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:09,402
-Your table is ready now. This way. please.
-Thank you.

160
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:11,167
Good. we can go now--

161
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,634
-Oh. l'm sorry.
-Really. it's all right.

162
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,034
Oh. l'm sorry.

163
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,269
l guess nothing else can happen to us.

164
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:23,170
You have days where nothing goes right.
That happened to me last week.

165
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,935
-From the first thing in--
-l'm terribly sorry.

166
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,968
My fault. madam.

167
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,370
Anyway. it's possible that the stars
have something to do with that.

168
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,935
l've read about that....

169
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,468
Well. you just beat your own record.

170
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,568
Door to door in 45 minutes.

171
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,468
-How'd it go?
-Oh. fine.

172
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:56,102
My date suddenly remembered
a pressing engagement.

173
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:57,600
With a tailor?

174
00:12:57,766 --> 00:13:00,802
-Yes.
-Well. what happened?

175
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,401
Dr. Stafford's office.

176
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:11,336
-Thís ís Mrs. Herman.
-Oh. Mrs. Herman.

177
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,102
Your basal metabolism test
is at 9 tomorrow.. .

178
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:18,237
...so don't eat when you wake up.
not even coffee. And don't smoke. please.

179
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,934
-Thanh you.
-Goodbye.

180
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,969
-Hey. Gwynne. where's Sue?
-You're safe.

181
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,535
-She's out with Otto.
-Who?

182
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,071
-You know. that European recording guy.
-Oh. good.

183
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:33,469
l put a file in this bread
in case you wanna break out of here.

184
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,468
-Hi. Carl.
-Hi.

185
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:39,670
lf you got money on you. l'd be delighted
to treat you to a soda at the drugstore.

186
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,701
Oh. l'd love it.

187
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:44,668
-Ella.
-Oh. go ahead. Gwynne. l'll be here.

188
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,502
-Thanks.
-Did you remember to wake Jeffrey Moss?

189
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:52,470
l tried. The sleeping prince
said to call him again at 6:OO.

190
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,769
But that means he didn't keep
his appointment with his producer.

191
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:59,736
Ella. he's only a disembodied voice.
remember?

192
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,937
Jeffrey Moss is just Plaza O-4433.

193
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,803
He doesn't mean any more
than any other subscriber to me.

194
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:11,668
Six o'clock. l have to wake him.

195
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,767
Yeah.

196
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,702

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,169

-Yes. it's 6:OO.

198

Time to get up.

199
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,800
One moment. please.

200
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:59,204
Ella. aren't you ever gonna give up
that old lady's voice you use on him?

201
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,900
He needs a mother.

202
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,035
Hello. Mr. Moss?
You left yourself this message:

Because l'll never meet hím

237

A face that only a mother could love?

263
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,838
lf you don't mind. l just sort of thought
maybe you and l could shoot the breeze.

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,769
Or chew the old fat-eroo.

265
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:35,834
Mom. l'm scared.

266

Last chance?

272
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:57,769
Mr. Moss. l know you can write
by yourself without your partner.

273
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:01,469
Now. you sit down and finish that outline.

274
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,536
Mom. you really care
what happens to me. don't you?

275
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,902
No ax to grind.

276
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:13,768
Not like the bunch of phonies

You hnow, you're the only person

00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:40,168
What's the use?

306
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,702
l'll never make it alone.

307
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,801
Francie.

308
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,101
Francie!

309
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:14,267
Here it is.

310
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:19,669
The minute one of those girls gets
on the phone. turn on the tape recorder.

311
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,135
Are you sure about this.
Inspector Barnes?

312
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,769
Mr. Barnes. you meathead.

313
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:27,769
l'm gonna get a promotion
for closing up this joint.

314
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:31,569
Just because the law arrested
all those girls at All-Alone-A-Phone...

315
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:34,769
.. .doesn't mean every
answering service is a front for...

316
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:38,336
-...a lonely-hearts club.
-Come on.

317
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:02,101
How do you do?

318
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:06,536
My name is Barnes. We're doing a little
article on the answering services.

319
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,601
We're from...

320
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,068
... Vogue magazine.

321
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,868
We'd just like to ask you
a couple of questions.

322
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,300
-Vogue_
-Yes.

323
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:19,770
Me? Oh. well. thank you.
l'd be glad to.

324
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:22,669
-Won't you sit down?
-No. thank you. We'll stand.

325
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,902
-l'll be with you in a minute.
-Alrighty.

326
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,403
Now. tell me. do you enjoy
doing this line of work?

327
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:35,671
Oh. l love it here. l used to be a plain
switchboard operator in a lingerie house.

328
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:39,970
Pretty dull. except for a little
modeling on the side.

329
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,436
Modeling on the side. huh?

330
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,904
But this is so much more personal. l come
into contact with so many different types...

331
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:51,169
...and l can give each one
the particular kind of help he needs.

332
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:54,636
My cousin Sue thinks l spend
too much time with each one.

333
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,070
She keeps saying. ''Get it over with
and get on to the next one.''

334
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,935
-Excuse me.
-Yes. of course.

335
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,968
Madame Grimaldi's.

336
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,268
No. the madame is out.

337
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:13,301
Well. there's several of us.

338
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:15,801
Oh. that's me.

339
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,770
Charge? For any friend
of Madame Grimaldi's. it's free.

340
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:27,535
-Okay. hang it up.
-Excuse me. sir-- What do you mean--?

341
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,470
-Get your toothbrush and come on along.
-My toothbrush?

342
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:34,669
-lt's hot.
-What do you do?

343
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,435
-l work here.
-Well. maybe you better come along too.

344
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,370
Just park the car. Otto. and hurry back.

345
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:44,002
Why. girls. what are these
men doing here?

346
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,568
We're closing the joint.
You're all coming along.

347
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:48,101
Women's detention home.

348
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:51,936
lnspector Barnes. vice squad.

349
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:56,003
l knew it. l knew you'd get us
into trouble. l warned you.

350
00:25:56,166 --> 00:26:01,170
-But. inspector. what did we do wrong?
-Well. l'll just let you speak for yourself.

351
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,568
Madame Grímaldí's.

352
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:11,835
No. the madame ís out.

353
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,268
Well. there are several of us.

354
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,701
Oh, that's me.

355
00:26:17,466 --> 00:26:22,537
Charge? For any fríend
of Madame Grímaldí's. ít's free.

356
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,835
Okay. which one is the madam?

357
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,335
That's Madame Grimaldi. the opera star.

358
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,371
l recommended a mustard plaster
for her cold. so then her....

359
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:40,935
Have you got a dirty mind!

360
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,638
Okay. inspector. you take me down
to the women's detention home.

361
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,703
By the time l'm through with you.
l'll have you demoted to a chicken inspector.

362
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:55,604
And here's our list of subscribers. inspector.

363
00:26:56,333 --> 00:27:01,337
Oh. well.... Well. all right.
l made a mistake.

364
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,901
Maybe....

365
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:06,702
Listen. l'm gonna be around.
and l'm gonna be listening in.

366
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:11,237
-Monitoring the phone?
-Any personal talk with a subscriber...

367
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,971
...or let's say. meeting any
male clients on the outside...

368
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:20,570
...and you and the madame are gonna be
taking calls at the women's detention home.

369
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,134
Otto.

370
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,335

371
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,102
You have the keys to my heart.

...to move all my
recording enterprises here...

...where l'll embark on a sales campaign...

384
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,535
...on an overall urban-saturation basis...

385
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,835
...to bring Kultur to the masses.

386
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,801
That's very interesting. professor.

387
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:25,368
Well. goodbye. Mr. Barnes.

388

Well. now. this has been
a pleasure. Iadies.

But you just remember what l told you.

390
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:33,301
Come on. Francie.

391
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,438
Take care. You know it's illegal to pass on
information you receive to a subscriber...

392
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,070
-...even for a mustard plaster.
-Francie.

393
00:28:56,633 --> 00:29:00,570
Oh. Otto. You can put
your things right over here.

394
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:02,734
Splendid.

Ella. please. remember

397
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:26,536
Stay out of the lives of the subscribers.

398
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,903
Oh. l know they all need help.

399
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:32,468
Dr. Kitchell wants to write songs.

400
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:35,902
Blake Barton wants to be
an actor. But they'll get along.

401
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,468
All you have to do is give...

402
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:42,003
-...and take messages. that's all.
-And take messages. that's all.

404
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,769
lf that's the way things

405
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,902
...be back at the Bonjour Tristesse
Brassiere Company.

406
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,870
Oh. Otto. it's lovely!

407
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,568
Oh. l am desolate.

00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:50,203
Gentlemen. gentlemen...

418
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,568
...and ladies.

419
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:56,336
The first board of directors meeting

Titanic Records.
What is Titanic Records?

423
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:08,870
That's us. At last. a foolproof system.
which will allow us to operate...

424
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,701
...under the eyes of the law...

425
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:13,668
...and yet seem to be serving
the cause of Kultur.

426
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:17,336
Now. to begin with.
we do not make bets on horses.

427
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,969
-We take orders for records.
-Records?

428
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:22,935
What does he mean, ''records''?

429
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,869
There are many different
racetracks in the country.

430

...and in Florida. the famous Hialeah
racetrack. to mention but a few.

432
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:39,137
Now. Louis. Louis. ask me

434

...in the third race at Belmont.

435
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:48,568
Splendid. Now. consult
your charts carefully.

436
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:51,402
As one of the agents
for the Titanic Record Company...

437
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:54,969
...you will call me up and say.

Anything but face that awful blank page.

611
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:01,003
-Oh. yeah.
-Oh. sure. go ahead. Drink.

612
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:05,103
-Ruin your last chance.
-Last chan-- Last chance to do what?

613
00:45:05,266 --> 00:45:09,303
Well. whatever it's your last chance
to do. You look desperate to me.

614
00:45:09,466 --> 00:45:11,801
l'm about to be ill.

615
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:15,703
You wouldn't happen to have
a cup of coffee on you?

616
00:45:15,866 --> 00:45:18,168
Yes. l would.

617
00:45:26,533 --> 00:45:29,335
And a cheese Danish?

618
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:32,134
Prune.

619
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:36,536
-Oh. listen. Miss...?
-Scott.

620
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:39,035
Melisande.

621
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,035
Moss. Jeffrey.

622
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:46,737
-Sit down. Miss Scott.
-No. l can't because l have to go.

623
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,037
Oh. well. now that my vision
has cleared up a bit...

624
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:00,604
...and l'm beginning to see shapes
and colors at more than 6 inches away...

625
00:46:00,766 --> 00:46:03,368
...you're beginning to look
pretty good to me...

626
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:07,904
...since l haven't anything to do
for the next 10.OOO years....

627
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:11,102
That's just another way
of avoiding your work. Girls.

628
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:14,302
And you do have something to do.
You have an appointment to keep.

629
00:46:14,466 --> 00:46:17,969
-Who said so?
-Your 7:OO call. Stay up and start writing.

630
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:20,435
You can write alone.
You did it once before.

631
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:24,537
-How do you know l did it once before?
-Because anybody who's a writer...

632
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,569
...must have written something
by himself once.

633
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:31,203
-Did l say l was a writer?
-No. but you're not a plumber. are you?

634
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:33,768
-No.
-Well....

635
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,035
But you don't think so yourself.
or you'd be writing...

636
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:40,503
...instead of running around
and coming home at 7 in the morning...

637
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:42,934
...and sleeping all day.

638
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:45,701
lt's uncanny.

639
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:48,235
-Are you plugged into me somewhere?
-No.

640
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,101
-You know me from someplace.
-No.

641
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:53,202
-You're psychic.
-Yes.

642
00:46:53,366 --> 00:46:55,301
l'm very intuitive.

643
00:46:55,466 --> 00:47:00,838
l get feelings about people. l know a lot
about you just from listening to you talk.

644
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,869
And l see visions.

645
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,403
-What's the matter?
-l see one now. It's a vision of you.

646
00:47:09,566 --> 00:47:11,901
What am l doing?

647
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:15,736
Nothing. You're lying facedown
in the gutter.

648
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,637
-Stop it. You're scaring the hell out of me.
-Sorry. that's what l see.

649
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,537
My visions are never wrong.
unless you do something about it.

650
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:27,169
l tried analysis.
l might as well try witchcraft.

651
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,268
We'll go the old witchcraft routine.

652
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:33,570
We'll get the doll. we'll get the pins.
and the boiling water and the drums.

653
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,902
Anything you want me to do. l'll do it.

654
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:39,402
-All right. Do as l say.
-Yeah?

655
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:42,902
-Go to your typewriter.
-Yeah?

656
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:50,702
-Sit down.
-Yeah?

657
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:56,135
-And now...
-Yeah?

658
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,201
...write it.

659
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,836
l knew there was a catch to it.

660
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,503
Oh. that's enough.
You're not so badly off.

661
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:11,470
l know a guy whose father's forcing him
to be a dentist. He wants to be a composer.

662
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:16,537
The poor fellow sits up in an office all day
Iong composing songs on an air hose.

663
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,236
Nobody's keeping you
from doing what you want.

664
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,502
Nobody except yourself.

665
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:26,202
You're afraid everybody's gonna say.
''Oh. the partner's the talented one.''

666
00:48:26,366 --> 00:48:28,267
Well. so what?

667
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:31,469
You call other people phonies
because you hate yourself.

668
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:36,371
You're afraid what you write isn't gonna be
important. so you don't write anything.

669
00:48:37,866 --> 00:48:40,335
Boy. do you know me.

670
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,936
Mr. Moss. you have to have
confidence in yourself.

671
00:48:44,233 --> 00:48:47,202
l don't even know you.
but l have confidence in you.

672
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:50,869
-You do?
-Yes. l do.

673
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:54,135
-You're crazy.
-Yes. l know.

674
00:00:05,608 --> 00:00:07,576
l'll try.

675
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:23,343
Hey. wait a minute.

676
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:26,945
l don't think l can do this
unless you're here.

677
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:23,446
So that's what you looh líhe

678
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:29,012
At last l know

679
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:33,645
You're better
Better than a dream

680
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:38,545
What you are
Is better far than a dream

681
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:42,478
l tríed to pícture your face

682
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:45,510
But now l see you

683
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:48,277
You're out of thís world
You're out of thís sphere

684
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,243
You're out of that outer space

685
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:55,012
Better, better than a dream

686
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:59,478
What ís real
Is more ídeal than a dream

687
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:03,945
To see and hear you
To be so near you

688
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:08,445
ls better
Better than a dream

689
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,310
Can thís be a dream?

690
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:14,743
Can l stíll be asleep
On the couch there?

691
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:18,444
Can thís gírl be really here?

692
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,979
She seems to know by sheer íntuítíon
How l landed ín thís condítíon

693
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:26,143
Boy, does she know me

694
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:30,879
The way that l thính, the way that l drính
The fact that l slept all year

695
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:33,109
But ít's not a dream

696
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,577
Because look. l've got some words
On the paper

697
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:39,212
Steady, boy, don't faínt or scream

698
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:44,479
Don't ask who sent you
Thís angel

699
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,111
lt's better
Better than a dream

700
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,444
-lt's better. better than a dream
-Can thís be a dream?

701
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,676

702
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:02,679
-What you are ís better far than a dream

00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:17,076

709
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:19,344

00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:28,144

00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:35,314
-ls better. better than a dream
-ls better. better than a dream

715
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:16,577
What's the matter?
You're shaking.

716
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:19,811
He liked it. Larry liked it.

717
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:23,144
Well. of course he liked it.

718
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:28,413
He said it's not quite written yet. and he
made me promise to go to the country...

719
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:32,812
...and whip it. but by and large.
it's something of a miracle.

720
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,609
lt's not a miracle. You did it.

721
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,510
-And you know what?
-What?

722
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,176
You're the miracle.

723
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:42,511
What's the matter? You blind?
Where do you think you're going?

724
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:46,412
Don't give me none of that. Driving
around here. nobody takes any care.

725
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:49,577
The light was still green.
He says it was red. It was green.

726
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:53,579
-People. Wow.
-What'd you expect? Herrings?

727
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:57,612
Look at them. A band of cutthroats.

728
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,777
You ever see such hatred?

729
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:05,279
lf l so much as asked one of these people
for the time. they'd turn into a lynch mob.

730
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:09,612
Everybody wants to be friendly. only
nobody's willing to make the first move.

731
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,811
Why don't you say hello
to this nice man over here?

732
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:15,410
He'd appreciate it.

733
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:20,712
Him? That's Dracula's uncle.
the Wolf Man.

734
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,944
The only thing he'd appreciate
would be a nice. fresh cup of blood.

735
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:27,778
Oh. it's so easy.
All you have to do is say hello.

736
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:29,610
Watch.

737
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,276
-Hello.
-What'd you say?

738
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:37,144
-All right. easy.
-l just said hello.

739
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:39,376
Hello? Hello?

740
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,944
Did you just say hello?

741
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:47,280
This is the first time in 30 years a stranger's
ever said hello to me on the street.

742
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:51,612
Hello. My name's Ludwig Smiley.

743
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:54,611

-Oh. no.

756
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:39,211
Oh. come on. Go on.

757
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:47,277
-Hello.
-No handouts.

758

A suit. We got a name
for actors who wear suits.

911
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:12,011
Be a punk imitation the rest of your life.

912
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:16,178
l'm telling you. you want the job.
you gotta cut the blue-jeans action.

913
00:19:16,342 --> 00:19:18,143
You know what l mean?

914
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:22,344
Look around you.
You're a glut on the market.

915
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:28,413
Like. man. like. dig.

-Just tried it on to see if it fits.
-Oh. l get it.

946
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,209

947
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,577
Ella. you're not gonna meet
the sleeping prince?

948
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,110
No.

949
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:16,446
That's good. Because if that
inspector catches you....

950
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:22,345
-What do you mean. no?
-l mean l'm not going.

951

Good.

953
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:48,910
How come you're not going?

00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:51,276
l can't.

955
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:54,745
-Why not?
-l can't see him again.

956
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:56,643
Why not?

957
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,143
Because l'd have to tell
him who l really am.

958
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:01,176
-So tell him.
-lt's impossible.

959
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:05,312
What's impossible? You're making
yourself miserable over nothing.

960
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:08,543
-Nothing.
-Sure. nothing.

961
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,043
What did you do
that was so impossible?

962
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,442
You lied a little.

963
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:15,877
-Lied a little.
-All right. So you lied a lot.

964
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:17,710
He forced you into it.

It's impossible.

981
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:34,078
Oh. Jeffrey. don't be such a pill.

982

l've got work to do.

983
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:43,711
You can work some other time.

984
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:48,744
Besides. they're waiting
for us downstairs.

Yeah. but l have
a business appointment.

987
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:10,811
-Mel.
-Good afternoon. Mr. Moss.

991
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:23,177
Get somebody else to take you

Well. now. where were we?

How did you know
about her and the races?

1000
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:52,345
lt's written all over her face.
She even looks a little like a horse.

1001
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:57,843
l can't believe you're really here.

1002
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,377
l can't believe it either.

1003
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:14,845
-How are you. Mel?
-l'm fine. thanks.

How's your work?

1007
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:27,712
Oh. wonderful. Wait till you see this.
l rewrote the whole first act...

1008
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,011
...and l more or less have
a rough draft for the rest of it.

1009
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,878
l hope you don't sue me. but you know
that dentist you were telling me about?

1010
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,544
Well. l wrote him into the play.

1011
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:39,976
That's wonderful.

1012
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,710
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

1013
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:49,244
-Mel.
-Oh. don't.

1014
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:52,277
What is this?
What did you come here for?

1015
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:54,844
-l thought you needed a secretary.
-Secretary!

1016
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:56,809
You're pretty well fixed for girls.

1017
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:59,377
lf you're here as a secretary.
get to the typewriter.

1018
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,076
-What do you charge?
-Nothing.

1019
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:03,444
-Oh. come on.
-A thousand dollars an hour.

1020
00:27:03,608 --> 00:27:07,945
That's reasonable enough.
Now sit down. Sit down.

1021
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:11,611
l promise l'll keep my grimy
paws off of you.

1022

Now. where were we?

Señor Mendoza's hacienda in Iceland?

1024
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:21,578
Rodriguez is kneeling by the bedside.

1025
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,709
Mel.

1026
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,044
l don't know what you think
you walked in on.

1027
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,076
lt wasn't anything at all.

1028
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:33,477
You probably don't care
whether it was or not...

1029
00:27:33,642 --> 00:27:36,578
...and you obviously think
l'm still with girls. girls--

1030
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,344
But l'm trying to tell you
that l've changed.

1031
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:41,943
l think l've finally found the one.

1032
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:44,077
The first one who's--

1033
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:46,544
-Mel--
-l have to go.

1034
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,609
Mel. you can't.

1035
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:52,178
You drop into my life like a miracle.
you save me from drowning.

1036
00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:56,345
You just can't toss me
back to the sharks.

1037
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,910
Mel. l love you.

1038
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:57,076
All right?

1039
00:28:57,408 --> 00:29:00,177
Do you think we should have left this on?

1040
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:07,310
-Too much?
-Yeah.

1041
00:29:07,842 --> 00:29:10,110
-Where is he?
-Where's who?

1042
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:15,580
-J. Otto Prantz.

Thank you. You like it?

1046
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,142

00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,944
Where's he taking you?
To a fancy society party?

1052
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:56,777
No. We're just going dancing.

Oh. that dress will be so beautiful

Yeah. Let's play with some music.

00:30:12,108 --> 00:30:16,579
Hey. couldn't l have

00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:19,444
-Oh. it's a cha-cha-cha.

And he did it all by himself.

and every canvas is at least 20 by 20.

1241
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:06,210
l say if you don't have wall space for it...

1242
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,144
...just move and get yourself
a place with the wall space.

1243
00:43:09,308 --> 00:43:11,243
You'll never regret it. my dear.

1244
00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:14,344
They're the most absolute riot
of color. my dear.

1245
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:19,980
And they're all tans and plums and olives.
And they're all pictures of eyes.

1246
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:24,145
Open eyes. closed eyes. blinking eyes.

...just eyes. eyes. eyes! Marvelous.

He's the first absolute genius

1249
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:32,744
...l was a year ago last summer
in the South of France.

1250
00:43:32,908 --> 00:43:35,577
l don't know your specifications.
That's the only--

1251
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:38,878
Wait a minute. this is a London call.
We gotta straighten this out.

1252
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:40,276
He's a hack. Iet's face it.

1253
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:43,278
Without Jeff. those plays wouldn't
have gotten off the ground.

1254
00:43:43,442 --> 00:43:46,812
-Jeff has the brilliance. the flair. the wit--
-A wonderful ear.

1255
00:43:46,975 --> 00:43:50,378
-That's the difference.
-Wonderful ear. You have it or you don't.

1256
00:43:50,575 --> 00:43:52,176
You've got to be born with it.

1257
00:43:52,342 --> 00:43:55,878
-What a beautiful talent.
-And what a great human being.

1258
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,276
l agree with you.

1259
00:43:58,008 --> 00:43:59,309

-lt's simply fantastic.
-Hang up when we get downstairs.

1261
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:04,744
Look. we've got to
get this straightened out.

1262
00:44:08,975 --> 00:44:12,745
Time me. and l'll be back
in 30 seconds flat.

1263
00:44:16,008 --> 00:44:18,310
What is that?

1264
00:44:19,442 --> 00:44:21,577
What is what?

1265
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:26,077
l don't think it's a play for a British director.

1266
00:44:26,342 --> 00:44:30,345
Well. it was the big night of my life.

Just beíng wíth hím

1358
00:51:26,175 --> 00:51:30,345
Mow you must wahe up

1359
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:34,945
All dreams must end

1360
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:38,644
Take off your makeup

1361
00:51:40,175 --> 00:51:44,379
The party's over

1362
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:11,644
We got stuck with the wrong shipment.

1363
00:52:11,808 --> 00:52:15,511
Maestro Corvello says you'll have to cover
the cost to the tune of 5000 albums.

1364
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:18,744
-But l did not switch them.
-Otto. who are these gentlemen?

1365
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:22,044
Two musicians from
the Chicago Concert Orchestra.

1366
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,443
Gentleman. l am innocent.
and l refuse to pay.

1367
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:29,212
Well. in that case. Otto. we may take you
across the river for a recording session.

1368
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:32,277
-A recording session?
-Maestro Corvello is waiting to record...

1369
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:35,711
...Síegfríed's Rhíne Journey
an8 Funeral March.

1370
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:39,511
You got two hours. We'll meet you
at the warehouse. Let's go. Nick.

1371
00:52:39,675 --> 00:52:44,846
Oh. bye-bye! Otto. you mustn't let
little business worries upset you.

1372
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:49,112
You know. you need someone
to look after you. Well. a woman.

1373
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:53,045
-Someone you can confide in.
-Sue. l will confide in you.

1374
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:55,810
Up till now. l want only to bring Kultur
to the masses...

1375
00:52:55,975 --> 00:53:01,013
...but now l want us to grow rich together.
But to do this. we must invest capital.

1376
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:04,378
How much money have you got?
You must trust me. l'm talking to you...

1377
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:07,811
-...like someone who may love you.

1378
00:53:07,975 --> 00:53:10,077

Sue. l love you.

1381
00:53:53,408 --> 00:53:56,144
Nowhere to go

1382
00:53:57,008 --> 00:54:00,711
lt's no use. Jeff. We've covered every bar
in town. Come on back to the party.

1383
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:04,812
l don't know anything about her. Where she
lives. how to get in touch with her.

1384
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,844
-Just a note saying goodbye.
-Come on. Jeff.

1385
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:11,611
Don't worry. Larry. Don't worry
about the play. l'll keep working.

1387
00:54:15,308 --> 00:54:17,143

-l would like to order a martini.
-Okay.

1389
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,277
Dry. Very dry.

1390
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:58,378
-Good evening. Mr. Moss.
-Good evening.

1391
00:54:58,542 --> 00:55:02,646
You don't know me. do you. Mr. Moss?

1392
00:55:02,808 --> 00:55:05,377
Must be the suit. l got to tell you...

1393
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:08,945
...l love the part Mr. Hastings

1394
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:12,110
The dentist who wants to be a composer.

1395
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:17,279
Where do you writers get an idea like that
from. anyway? l mean. an idea like that....

1396
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:21,144
-Where do you get them from?
-Oh. Iet me alone. will you?

1397
00:55:21,308 --> 00:55:26,046
-Excuse me. Mr. Moss.
-l'm sorry. Barton. l feel rotten.

1398
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:31,580
-Let's put it this way. l wish l were dead.
-Gee. Mr. Moss. l know what you mean.

1399
00:55:31,742 --> 00:55:34,578
A couple of weeks ago. man.
l was the lowest.

1400
00:55:34,742 --> 00:55:38,245
l hadn't worked for months.
and then. a miracle!

1401
00:55:38,408 --> 00:55:42,211
Oh. please. no miracles.
You're a nice guy. Barton. Drink up.

1402
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:45,544
-Thanks. l got one coming.
-And now. it's showtime.

1403
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:51,580
And for our opening production number.
The Pyramid Pips present a brand-new song:

1404
00:55:51,742 --> 00:55:55,579
''The Midas Touch'' !

1405
00:55:59,808 --> 00:56:04,879
Gold and all íts glory
And here's the story of the Mídas touch

1406
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:06,743
Did they say ''The Midas Touch''?

1407
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:14,412
The beggar rests hís weary head

1408
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:18,412
And dreams of just one crust of bread

1409
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,776
But...

1410
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:24,679
...when the beggar's dreams grow bold

1411
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:30,947
He dreams as others do

1412
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:35,512
Of gold

1413
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:40,978

00:56:56,675 --> 00:56:59,744

1425
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:23,945
-Oh. like the number?
-Especially the fourth one from the right.

1426
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:28,545
No. no. the song.
l wrote it. Isn't it wonderful?

1427
00:57:30,475 --> 00:57:34,212
Excuse me. Did you say you wrote that?

1428
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:36,844
''The Midas Touch''?
Sure. Great title. isn't it?

1429
00:57:37,008 --> 00:57:39,243
l always thought so.

1430
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,444
-Would you join us?
-Oh. l'd be glad to.

1431
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:48,945
-l'm Jeffrey Moss. This is Blake Barton.
-How do you do? My name is Joe Kitchell.

1432
00:57:49,108 --> 00:57:50,876
Sit down.

1433
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:58,711
Jackpot. Francie. The three of them
are together. We'll close in tonight.

1434
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,177
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

1435
00:58:01,342 --> 00:58:04,745
l don't know whether they're pushing dope.
or if it's a spy ring...

1436
00:58:04,908 --> 00:58:07,644
...but it's something big.
and she's Miss Big.

1437
00:58:07,808 --> 00:58:10,110
Go alert the squad.

1438
00:58:11,008 --> 00:58:14,311
-Mr. Kitchell--
-lt's Dr. Kitchell.

1439
00:58:14,475 --> 00:58:16,777
Actually. l'm a dentist.

1440
00:58:16,942 --> 00:58:18,176
-Dentist?
-A dentist?

1441
00:58:18,342 --> 00:58:21,144
-Sure.
-That's funny. l'm a dentist.

1442
00:58:21,308 --> 00:58:25,612
-You're a dentist?
-Well. l play a dentist in a play.

1443
00:58:25,775 --> 00:58:30,913
That's funny. Well. l'm not a dentist
anymore. l'm a composer now.

1444
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:33,010
My father didn't want me
to be a composer.

1445
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:35,977
My father doesn't want me
to be a composer.

1446
00:58:36,142 --> 00:58:39,178
-He doesn't?
-My father in the play.

1447
00:58:39,342 --> 00:58:42,411
-That's funny.
-lt's real funny and sad.

1448
00:58:42,575 --> 00:58:46,845
lt's a very interesting part. See. l make up
these tunes on the air hose...

1449
00:58:47,008 --> 00:58:49,910
-...and my father doesn't want me to--
-You...?

1450
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:53,044
l wrote ''The Midas Touch'' on the air hose.

1451
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:56,778
That's what's holding up the play.
l've been using paper.

1452
00:58:56,942 --> 00:59:00,345
-What play?
-The play we're talking about. He wrote it.

1453
00:59:00,508 --> 00:59:03,677
-You wrote the play?
-The Mídas Touch.

1454
00:59:03,842 --> 00:59:07,979
-That's the name of my song.
-Yeah. l know. l know.

1455
00:59:08,608 --> 00:59:10,910
That's funny.

1456
00:59:11,942 --> 00:59:16,079
-l remember. l got the title from that girl.
-What girl?

1457
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:18,777
The girl that was thinking of
the Midas touch that day.

1458
00:59:18,942 --> 00:59:21,711
-What day?
-That was the day that changed my life.

1459
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:25,378
l was feeling lower than low.
hopeless. and suddenly...

1460
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:27,310
-...a miracle happened.
-Miracle?

1461
00:59:27,475 --> 00:59:31,212
-He's got a miracle too.
-She was in the office a couple minutes...

1462
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:35,579
...tipped me off about this job. and l got it.
She was blond. pretty...

1463
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:39,679
-...5'6''. big brown eyes--
-Wait a minute. Wait a second here!

1464
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:43,145
That's how l got the chance
to do the part in your play.

1465
00:59:43,308 --> 00:59:47,578
This girl comes up to me and tells me
about myself. the clothes and the whole bit.

1466
00:59:47,742 --> 00:59:51,145
She changes my life. l get the part.
What l'm leading up to is:

1467
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:54,477
-She was blond. 5'6''--
-Melisande!

1468
00:59:54,642 --> 00:59:56,043
-Who?
-Melisande Scott.

1469
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:58,009
-l gotta find her.
-He's flipping.

1470
00:59:58,175 --> 00:59:59,409
-Let's go.
-Wait a second.

1471
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:02,878
That girl is the same girl
that dropped into my life.

1472
01:00:03,042 --> 01:00:05,978
-The same girl?
-Where did you see her last? Where?

1473
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:09,545
She was in the office a minute
and disappeared. l never saw her again.

1474
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:12,177
-Same with me.
-l've got to get to the bottom of this.

1475
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:16,012
l've gotta find her. l'm in love with her.
Where can l call you later?

1476
01:00:16,175 --> 01:00:19,077
-l don't know where l'll be.
-l don't know where l am.

1477
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:23,479
-l'll give you my phone number here.
-l'll give you my phone number too.

1480
01:00:28,342 --> 01:00:32,512

1481
01:00:33,775 --> 01:00:36,811
-All right. you three. come on along.
-Wait a minute.

1482
01:00:36,975 --> 01:00:40,011
-There's only two of them.
-Cover the exit. Cover the men's room.

1483
01:00:40,175 --> 01:00:43,411
-What's going on here?
-We're taking you down to the station.

1484
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:47,412
-Would this have to do with the blond girl?
-You said it.

1485
01:00:47,575 --> 01:00:49,176

All Susanswerphone.

1501
01:02:33,508 --> 01:02:36,611
That was the other one l was talking to.

1502
01:02:37,642 --> 01:02:39,443
Mom.

1503
01:02:39,942 --> 01:02:42,177
Melisande.

1504
01:02:46,508 --> 01:02:49,043
Mom!

1505
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:52,277
But. Ella. l'm not angry with you.

1506
01:02:52,442 --> 01:02:55,311
l just wish you'd confided in me sooner.

1507
01:02:55,475 --> 01:02:58,611
-Well. you mustn't leave.

Ella. l need you here.

1510
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:19,011
The subscribers won't even know l've gone.

1511
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:21,710
That's not true. Why. only today...

1512
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:24,911
...Mrs. Mallet called twice
about her little boy. Junior.

1513
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:29,045
He wanted to talk to Santa Claus.
They all ask for you.

1514
01:03:30,842 --> 01:03:33,778
They call me ''the other one.''

1515
01:03:34,608 --> 01:03:36,343
Please stay. Ella.

1516
01:03:38,408 --> 01:03:40,676
l can't. Sue.

1517
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:44,744
l've spent my whole life tuning in
on other people's lives...

1518
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:47,710
...playing all sorts of imaginary characters.

1519
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:51,411
They became even more real to me
than l was.

1520
01:03:51,975 --> 01:03:54,944
Jeff fell in love with one of them...

1521
01:03:55,108 --> 01:03:57,210
...not with me.

1522
01:03:58,008 --> 01:04:02,679

To the Bonjour Trístesse Company

01:07:42,442 --> 01:07:44,977
-Give me a chance to explain it.

1566
01:07:45,142 --> 01:07:48,678
-Just a minute. please.
-Come on. get in!

1567
01:07:48,842 --> 01:07:51,611
Get in here. you fink. you.

1569
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:58,045
-But give me a chance to check the books.
-Ella. Iet me help you.

1570
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:01,077
Why. Otto. what's the matter?

1571
01:08:03,675 --> 01:08:06,310
This is impossible.
Who could have done this?

1572
01:08:06,475 --> 01:08:09,611
Who switched these orders from
Beethoven's 10th to Beethoven's 9th?

1573
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:13,378
l did. Beethoven only wrote
nine symphonies.

1574
01:08:14,142 --> 01:08:16,944
You idiot! You put all the money
on the wrong horse.

1575
01:08:17,108 --> 01:08:19,143
l was almost bumped off for this
by the mob.

1576
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:20,542
Shut up.

1577
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:25,712
To think my simple. little bookie system
can be loused up by this dumb broad.

1578
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:28,277
-Horses?
-Bookies!

1579
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:31,678
Otto. is that what l gave you
all that money for?

1580
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:34,177
-Sue. you didn't.
-That's swell. Ioudmouth.

1581
01:08:34,342 --> 01:08:37,244
-Now these dames know all about it.
-They can't talk.

1582
01:08:37,408 --> 01:08:42,546
One peep out of them. and the cops will put
them in jail and close up Susanswerphone.

1583
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:45,110
-Let's go! The money!
-My life savings!

1584
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:48,411
-Ella. please do something!
-Shut up!

1585
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,842
-They don't get it.
-Get what?

1586
01:08:55,008 --> 01:08:56,776
Shut up!

1587
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:01,678
-Okay. Otto. your number's up.
-Ridiculous.

1588
01:09:01,842 --> 01:09:06,446
Oh. no. Remember Mr. Barnes
of Vogue magazine?

1589
01:09:06,608 --> 01:09:09,610
-Vogue_
-He's not Mr. Barnes. He's Inspector Barnes.

1590
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:13,712
And the cops know about this
whole layout. It's a trap!

1591
01:09:14,408 --> 01:09:16,376
You're coming with us to Corvello's.

1592
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:19,711
No. no. no. It won't be necessary
to rub us out. boys. because....

1593
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:25,046
Because you've all been
spilling your guts into a tape recorder.

1594
01:09:32,142 --> 01:09:33,510
Where is it?

1595
01:09:33,675 --> 01:09:35,076
Where is it?

1596
01:09:35,242 --> 01:09:38,044
You think you're playing with kids?
''Where is it?''

1597
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,043
Where is it?

1598
01:09:40,908 --> 01:09:43,710
lt's rigged up to the police station.
that's where.

1599
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:46,577
And you better get going.
because as a matter of fact...

1600
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:49,878
...lnspector Barnes
should be here any minute.

1601
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:54,111
lnspector Barnes.
Am l glad to see you.

1602
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:57,678
-Get your toothbrush and come on along.
-My toothbrush?

1603
01:09:57,842 --> 01:10:01,045
-That's right.
-No. we can just drop that act right now.. .

1604
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,944
...because l've got the whole
bookie mob right here.

1605
01:10:04,108 --> 01:10:07,845
-All you have to do is take them away.
-lnspector Barnes. l surrender happily.

1606
01:10:08,008 --> 01:10:11,344
These are two of Corvello's henchmen.
l want to congratulate you.. .

1607
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:15,278
...for having such a brilliant ally working
with you to uncover the Corvello gang.

1608
01:10:15,442 --> 01:10:20,113
Me? l'm nothing. Small potatoes.
Corvello. he's the head of everything.

1609
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,209
We only work for him.

1610
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,810
-What?
-lnspector. don't you get the picture?

1611
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:27,544
Titanic Records is a bookie operation.

1612
01:10:29,675 --> 01:10:33,578
-Take them away.
-Take them away!

1613
01:10:36,908 --> 01:10:41,879
-Farewell. my líebchen.
-Oh. Otto. how you deceived me.

1614
01:10:42,042 --> 01:10:46,980
But how you deceived me.
you little Mata Hari.

1615
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:05,112
lnspector Barnes.
you'll get a promotion for this.

1616
01:11:05,275 --> 01:11:07,276
l didn't do anything.

1617
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:11,344
l told you she was a nice girl.

1618
01:11:14,275 --> 01:11:19,413
Well. is it a crime to have made
a human mistake? l misjudged you.

1619
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:26,079
l wonder if you'd mind coming down to
the station with me. l may need your help.

1620
01:11:26,242 --> 01:11:28,844
l'll be glad to.

1621
01:11:29,008 --> 01:11:33,278
Now. Ella. promise me you won't leave.

-l'm comíng over.
-Well. it won't do you any good.

1628

Crackpot!

1629

-Sue. what was that?
-Somebody looking for somebody.

Max's Dog and Cat Beauty Shop.
Nobody home.

1635
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,577
Are you sure this is the right address?

1636
01:12:37,742 --> 01:12:41,011
-That's it.
-Doesn't look like an office building to me.

1637
01:12:41,175 --> 01:12:43,377
That's it. buddy.

1638
01:13:05,908 --> 01:13:10,412
What kind of a place is this?
It looks like something out of Olíyer Twíst.

1639
01:13:11,242 --> 01:13:14,712
-What?
-Keep away. young man.

1640
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:19,079
We girls are not allowed
to be familiar with the customers.

1641
01:13:19,242 --> 01:13:20,977
Mom.

1642
01:13:21,275 --> 01:13:23,977
Mom. Don't you know me?

1643
01:13:24,142 --> 01:13:27,879
Don't you know your little telephonic
sonny boy?

1644
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,912
Oh. yes. Mr. Moss. Get out!

01:13:43,842 --> 01:13:47,645

1647
01:13:47,808 --> 01:13:52,846
-There's no Melisande. l made it up.
