1
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,560
How are you feeling now, Kitty?

2
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,470
I'm all right.

3
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:42,700
You lay down during the intermisson
and I'll give you a couple of shots.

4
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,997
I'll lay down
but I don't want any shots.

5
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:10,000
Telegram for you, Kitty.
For God's sake, give me.

6
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,133
Nothing serious, I hope, Kitty.

7
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,059
No, it's nothing.

8
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:20,578
Kitty, Kitty.

9
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,830
There's more. The one and only.
Take it easy, boys.

10
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:36,051
Hey, boys, don't forget.
At the conclusion of tonight's performance...

11
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,428
Hey, is there a doctor in the house?

12
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:42,001
No foolin, boys.
Is there a doctor in the house?

13
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:44,133
All right, What's the answer to that?

14
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,349
Is Dr. Leonard here?
Is Dr. Leonard here?

15
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:51,941
Leonard! Leonard!
Doctor Leonard!

16
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:53,900
Doctor Leonard.

17
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,500
Doctor Leonard.

18
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:57,529
What do you want?

19
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,900
Come backstage, doc.
Make it snappy.

20
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:03,056
Hey doc, how did you ever get away
from the office?

21
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:07,706
Right this way, doctor.

22
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,560
All of you on the other side of the stage.

23
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,317
I'll take you to the dressing room.

24
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:17,187
Stay in your pallet.
No, no, right of center door.

25
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,289
That's right.

26
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,007
Oh, I don't get clothes.

27
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:24,416
Go on to your dressing-room, quick!

28
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,279
Something she ate?

29
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,549
No, she hasn't been feeling so good
for a couple of days.

30
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:34,870
And then when we came off this number
she got this telegram and passed out.

31
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,026
What's it all about?

32
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,100
It's from her husband.

33
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:42,100
He got sent up for croaking a big bum
with an itch for Kitty.

34
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:47,160
Eddie was a swell fellow.
But he didn't belong to this racket.

35
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,600
Crazy about Kitty.
Jealous of everybody.

36
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,880
But that's no way to be
in the Burlesque game.

37
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,828
No, I guess not.
Gee, it's tough on Kitty, though.

38
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:57,550
Will she be able to go on again tonight, doc?
No, sir.

39
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,090
Nor for many an acts to come.

40
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,329
Send one of the boys across the street
for my surgical bag, will you?

41
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,333
Sure.
Is there anything very serious?

42
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,320
No, not if we work fast.

43
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,732
Hey, you.
Come in here. I'll need you.

44
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,200
On stage everybody.

45
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:26,945
Step on it.
Come on, get on there.

46
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:29,754
Hurry up, Joe.
It's your entrance.

47
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:03,600
Well, Maude Adams?

48
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:07,550
How about getting out there
and giving the cast a little of your time, eh?

49
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:10,047
What's the matter with you?
You're not getting out there?

50
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:13,917
Kitty's got a baby.

51
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:17,051
Well I'll be.
She's got a baby.

52
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,349
Kitty's got a baby.
Kitty's got a baby.

53
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:23,320
Kitty's got a baby.
Oh, Kitty's got a baby.

54
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:26,328
Kitty's got a baby.
Kitty's got a baby.

55
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:28,742
What?
Oh, boy!

56
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:06,538
Come on in, boys and girls,
we got company.

57
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,160
Gee, Kitty, the baby looks great.

58
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:27,068
Oh, isn't it cute?

59
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,744
It looks just like Kitty.

60
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:32,721
Oh, what a beautiful baby!

61
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:02,007
Watch that left foot there, precious.

62
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:06,007
That's right. That's fine.
That's momma's big girl.

63
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:10,535
Come in.
Uncle Joe!

64
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:18,976
Well, how's my best girl today?
Fine.

65
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:21,600
Now, Kitty, I got good news.

66
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:23,336
Just came from Maxmount's office

67
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:26,001
And you and the Highflying Company is all set.

68
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,073
Thirty weeks date,
 you open in Toledo.

69
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,460
Did you make it plain about my billing?

70
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,400
Oh, yeah.
He came through without a squawk.

71
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,626
And as for you, Snoops,
look what I got for you.

72
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,904
From one comic to another.

73
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:42,252
Mommy, look!
Oh, Joe, that's swell.

74
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:46,501
Come on, little monkey, you run over there.
Try'em on, see how they look.

75
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:56,743
Listen, Kitty, I've been thinking a lot
lately about you.

76
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,610
What you two need is a man like me
to take care of you.

77
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,500
Kitty Darling don't need any man
to take care of her.

78
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,611
Ain't she getting along pretty well
without one now?

79
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,300
If you'd leave it to me I'd buy a cosy little home
some place for you, Nicky.

80
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,105
where she could grow up right.

81
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,900
A home for me, eh?
You want lumps growing on me, I suppose.

82
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:19,708
No, Mr. King, I got plans.
I'm headed straight for Broadway, the big time.

83
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:23,204
No foolin', Kitty. The kid deserves a better break.

84
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,679
Why, this burlesque racket
is no place for her.

85
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:27,883
I can take plenty care of her, thanks.

86
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:29,050
Yeah, I know.

87
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:32,556
But she's getting to the age
where she's learning things whether you like it or not.

88
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:35,313
Why, last night I overheard her trying to tell the one

89
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:37,770
that the girls brought back from
the elf's backyard.

90
00:10:38,074 --> 00:10:39,944
Look. Look.

91
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,635
You see what I mean?

92
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:47,188
Yes, maybe you're right.
But, Joe, what can I do?

93
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:52,559
Listen, I got a cousin that'll send your kid
to a nice school in Wisconsin. A convent.

94
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:56,100
Take April away from me?
The Blessed Heart. She said it was great.

95
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:59,046
Oh, no, Joe. I couldn't.
I couldn't. I'd die.

96
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,385
It's for her own good, Kitty. Honest.

97
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:03,072
She'd get an education.

98
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:07,014
Grow up at a nice place.
Not in some lousy burlesque theater.

99
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:11,800
No sleeper jumps and none of the small town johns
hanging around at nights.

100
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:16,000
And there'll be sisters there
to teach her the word of God.

101
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,651
And she'd grow up in a nice place,
grow up to be a lady.

102
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:23,412
not a cheap little tot.
You want April to be a lady, don't you?

103
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:26,721
You bet she's gonna be a lady.
I got plans for her.

104
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:28,393
Then you'd better send her to that convent.

105
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:31,160
Maybe I will.
Maybe I will.

106
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:37,000
Let us contemplate in its mystery

107
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,285
how our Lord, Jesus Christ

108
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,440
being sentenced to die

109
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:45,678
bore with great patience
the cross which was laid upon him

110
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,440
for his greater torment and ignominy.

111
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,729
And now, April,  there's a little prayer
that goes with this, dear.

112
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,065
It goes like this.

113
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,419
Oh, Holy Virgin, example of patience.

114
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,985
by the most painful carrying of the cross

115
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:09,900
on which thy son, our Lord Jesus Christ,

116
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:12,587
bore the heavy weight of our sins,

117
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:18,601
obtain for us of Him,
by thy intersession,

118
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,610
courage and strength

119
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:24,138
to follow His steps

120
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:30,068
And bear our cross after Him
to the end of our lives,

121
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,079
Amen.

122
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,669
I know he loves me,
heaven knows why

123
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:43,756
And when he tells me
he can't live without me

124
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:48,174
what wouldn't I do for that man?

125
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:50,671
He's not an angel or saint,

126
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,630
I know he loves me, heaven knows why

127
00:12:55,648 --> 00:13:00,068
and when he tells me
he can't live without me

128
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:04,126
what wouldn't I do for that man?

129
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:09,300
I'll never leave him alone,
I'll make his troubles my own

130
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:13,900
With all his faults I know we'll get by

131
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm just no good when his arms are about me

132
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:24,625
what wouldn't I do for that man?

133
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:30,382
what wouldn't I do for that man?

134
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:39,800
Give me air.

135
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:43,109
After that one I'd better get out of here
while I'm still alive.

136
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,620
Come on, Hitch, stick around.
It's early.

137
00:13:45,637 --> 00:13:48,217
I can't, Peggy. Honest.
Kitty'll be sore.

138
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,747
Anybody'd think she got a mortgage on you.

139
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:52,263
You see that rock?

140
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:55,052
As long as she keeps kicking in
with little love tokens like that, sweetness,

141
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:58,606
I'm gonna keep right on being her wide-bedded boy.

142
00:13:58,619 --> 00:13:59,939
Okay, big boy.

143
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,700
As long as she doesn't get wise that you're giving
the runaround with every dame in the coop.

144
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,800
When she does, I'll get me a new mama, peaches.

145
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:09,190
And your name's right on top of the list.

146
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:11,074
Aw, baloney.

147
00:14:17,868 --> 00:14:20,558
I loved that man from the start

148
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,000
and way down deep in my heart

149
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:29,071
I know he loves me,
heaven knows why

150
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,880
and when he tells me he can't
live without me

151
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:38,614
What wouldn't I do...
Hello, beautiful!

152
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:41,216
Gee, you gave me a start.
Ain't you home early?

153
00:14:41,223 --> 00:14:42,803
Well, I dumped the gang, luscious.

154
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,926
Had to come home to my big blonde mama.

155
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, honey.
My own sweet boy.

156
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:50,939
What's all that stuff?
Forget-me-nots?

157
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:52,900
Just a lot of old letters and junk.

158
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,900
Hey, what john wrote your loads?

159
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:57,284
You ain't the first good-looking guy
in my life.

160
00:14:57,294 --> 00:14:58,644
But the last, eh?

161
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:00,336
Who's the dame?
Give me that.

162
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,167
Wait a minute, can't you?

163
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:04,089
What's the rush?

164
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:06,459
Cute kid.

165
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:09,517
Sister?
To my own darling mama.

166
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,900
Give me that.
Hey!

167
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,079
What's that mean "To my own darling mama", eh?

168
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,350
You can read, can't you?

169
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,521
You mean to tell me this kid's yours?

170
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:19,477
Well, is it?
Well, what if she is?

171
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:21,218
You've been holding out on me.

172
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:24,765
Shut up. You're all alike.
Just a lot of dirty double-crossing broads.

173
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:26,222
How old is the kid?

174
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,086
Seventeen.
Where's she at?

175
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:29,690
In school. In a convent.

176
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,120
That's a laugh. What for?

177
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:34,683
I got plans for her.
I want her to have an education.

178
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:37,324
Yeah, but I always thought those joints
were so expensive.

179
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:40,169
I manage to round up a coin every month.

180
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,702
So that's where all your spare cash goes.

181
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:44,813
No wonder you didn't have 100 bucks
to loan me Monday.

182
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,745
But when I do have it to loan,
what do you do with it?

183
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:48,277
Drop it in some bookie's lap.

184
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,148
Well, I'm not thinking of myself
so much now, see?

185
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:51,622
But you oughta be sore if I go away.

186
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:52,980
Sure, you got a great career.

187
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,750
But it takes plenty of jack as well as
talent to make the grade.

188
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:58,163
I got plenty of both, I guess.

189
00:15:58,168 --> 00:16:02,518
Speaking of that, how about that act of ours
you said the Keith Office was interested in?

190
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:03,905
There you are, you see?

191
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:06,403
That's gonna cost about $1200 to mount.

192
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:09,341
Classy looking props, three changes for you, orchestrations

193
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:11,294
and I'll bet you ain't got $1200.

194
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,183
Maybe not. But you said you'd help, remember?

195
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:16,276
Now, that ring I gave you.

196
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,400
I knew that was coming.

197
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:19,404
Hawk it, eh?

198
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:21,747
That's all the sentiment you got in ya.

199
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,320
Hawk that new overcoat
you got me too, I suppose.

200
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,420
No, I want you to look nice.

201
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:27,874
Yeah, well...

202
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:31,400
I guess I'm gonna be the little old excess baggage
around here from now on.

203
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:34,122
I can see you've been playing me
for a sucker.

204
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:37,637
Just a goodtime pal to keep you
from getting lonesome on sleeper-jumps.

205
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,980
I've been nuts about you.
But I'm wise now.

206
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:42,527
Hitch, what are you driving at?

207
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,533
I guess I got sense enough to know when I'm through.

208
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:46,000
You're not walking out on me?

209
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:48,173
What do you expect me to do
after the deal you've given me?

210
00:16:48,183 --> 00:16:50,410
What deal, honey,
what are you talking about?

211
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:54,576
When we made our bargain it was gonna be 50/50
and no holding out on each other, right?

212
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:57,715
Now what? I find out you got a kid seventeen
and you've been blowing your dough up.

213
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:00,149
Dough we need for ourselves,
for our future, for your career.

214
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,860
What can I do, she's my daughter, ain't she?

215
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,820
I'll tell you what you can do.

216
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:06,200
You don't have to keep her
in some expensive dump like that, do you?

217
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,449
Now get the kid down here.
Take her out of school?

218
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:10,383
Make her go to work.
She's old enough.

219
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:13,273
I wanna keep my baby out of show business.

220
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:16,636
Okay, Kitty, that's my answer.
Wait a second. Give me time to think.

221
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,650
There ain't nothing to think about.
It's her or me. That's flat.

222
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:23,184
All right,
if you think that's the right thing to do.

223
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:25,861
Why, sure it is, babes.

224
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,811
It's time you did something for yourself

225
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,559
instead of dishing out the gravy
for someone else like you do.

226
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:34,031
One thing no, Hitch.
She ain't going in to show business.

227
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,810
I'll get her a job outside some place.

228
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:39,075
Okay, Kitty, just so long
as she holds up our own name.

229
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:42,060
Now you sit right down here
and write her a little letter.

230
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:44,779
Now, Hitch, don't be cross at me,

231
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,200
but don't you think we oughta think
this over a little?

232
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:49,534
Honest, the way you rush me
into things sometimes...

233
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:51,912
Will you just stop fussing and write to her?

234
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,845
You've been saving and scrimping all your life
to keep this jane in school.

235
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:56,453
Now it's her turn to do something for you.

236
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,689
Help you put away a little money
for a rainy day, right?

237
00:17:58,695 --> 00:18:01,525
Oh, I don't know...
You got a great career, babes.

238
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:04,851
She oughta be proud to help you,
proud to be Kitty Darling's daughter, right?

239
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:08,854
Why, I know so.
She ain't as good looking as her ma...

240
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:11,001
maybe she takes after her old man.

241
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:14,784
Instead you can depend on me, Kitty baby,
to treat her right for your sake.

242
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,070
Why, we'll just be one big happy family.

243
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:20,655
One big happy family.

244
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,120
May God's love and kindness guide you.

245
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:29,104
As you go forth
into the great world outside these gates...

246
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,000
and keep you from all harm

247
00:18:32,469 --> 00:18:33,779
till we meet again.

248
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,049
That is my prayer for you.

249
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,113
Little angel.

250
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,370
Goodbye.

251
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,839
Looking for somebody, honey?

252
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:25,975
Yes, I...
Mr. Greeley.

253
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:27,345
Mr. Greeley.

254
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:29,118
Cash customer.

255
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,155
I'm supposed to meet my mother here,
Miss Darling.

256
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:34,690
Oh, so you're Kitty Darling's little girl, eh?

257
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,150
Well, I'm a couple of cockeyed sewing sewers.

258
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,441
My name's Eddy Vermont.

259
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:41,101
I'm in the merry-merry too.
One of your momma's best pals.

260
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:44,046
Put it back here.
How do you do, Mr. Vermont?

261
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,830
Your ma is up at the theater.

262
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:48,186
She wants you to wait upstairs till she gets back.

263
00:22:48,197 --> 00:22:51,127
Oh, how long will I have to wait
to see her?

264
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,483
Not more than an hour or so.

265
00:22:52,492 --> 00:22:54,682
These uptown grind joints get out early.

266
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:56,070
I'll show you to the rooms.

267
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,073
Thank you.
You got a great ma, Miss Darling.

268
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,279
And believe me, she sure knows her stuff.

269
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:03,711
That Swedish movement of hers
has been laying'em in the aisles ever since I was a pup.

270
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:04,900
Swedish movement?

271
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,927
I mean the way Kitty slams over her number.

272
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:11,413
And boy, she packs the meanest strip and teaser routine
that ever burned a Verona way.

273
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:13,416
You know what I mean.
Not exactly.

274
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:16,347
I haven't seen my mother
on the stage since I was five.

275
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:18,790
No?
But I remember she was wonderful.

276
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,160
I'll say so.
Say, I got a bright idea.

277
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,836
Instead of hanging around this dump,

278
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:25,852
why don't you grab the Lexington Ave. local
and go up and catch the show?

279
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:28,519
Do you really think I could?
Sure.

280
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:30,316
I can't take you myself,
I have a heavy date.

281
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,310
But my kid brother, Slim,
he'll take you.

282
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,459
He's a nice guy, too.

283
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,346
Okay with you?
Yes.

284
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:37,867
All right, I'll get him right down.

285
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,900
512, sweetheart.

286
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,550
Slim? Come right down.
I got a job for you.

287
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:46,160
Yeah, yeah.

288
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:16,529
Sorry the seats ain't so hot
but the show's almost over.

289
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,300
Sit down!

290
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:21,101
What are you looking at, punk?

291
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:49,121
We oughta pension off
that faded old blonde.

292
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:52,175
Yeah, she's all worked up anyway,
look at that.

293
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:23,716
Let's go away from here, please.

294
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:25,332
Okay, I'll take you back to your ma.

295
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:26,492
All right.

296
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,626
All right, tag along this side.

297
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:56,763
Mommy!

298
00:26:56,776 --> 00:26:58,676
April, baby!

299
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:00,470
I don't know whether I done right
bringing her up here, Kitty.

300
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,449
but she was all harped up in seeing you.

301
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:04,119
We thought it would be a nice surprise.

302
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:06,239
It sure was, you did just right.

303
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:09,891
Oh, my, look at this girl...
Well, guess I'll be edging along.

304
00:27:09,904 --> 00:27:11,454
So long everybody.
Bye.

305
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,890
You look like an old lady.
Oh, mother, mommy!

306
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,020
Oh, dear. You're so pretty.
Ain't she, Hitch?

307
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,660
Yes.
Oh, this is Hitch Nelson.

308
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,439
He's the Hitch I've been writing you about.

309
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:23,554
How do you do, Mr. Nelson?
Make it Hitch, kid.

310
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:26,776
We're all pals together.
What do you think of my great big girl.

311
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:30,453
A litttle skinny.
Ah, Hitchy. Ain't he a lemon, though?

312
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:32,686
Honest, the things he says to people I meet.

313
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:34,800
He's a bad one.
He don't mean nothing by it.

314
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:37,812
Now you sit down here.
Say, you better finish your change, beautiful.

315
00:27:37,826 --> 00:27:39,916
You only got a couple of minutes.
Yeah, that's right.

316
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:42,586
If I had known
I could have company like this I... oooh!

317
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,720
like this, well...

318
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,060
Angel baby, just as soon as we get out of this joint
we'll go down to Gialetta's

319
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:50,528
and we'll sit on the swellest place
you ever saw

320
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,999
and stuff ourselves flat in the face.

321
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:54,186
Up short, Kitty.
All right, all right.

322
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:56,944
Come on, watch me finish the show.

323
00:27:56,952 --> 00:27:59,072
I'd rather stay here if you don't mind.

324
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,209
All right for you then.

325
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,310
Kick'er up, honey.

326
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,603
Got any ideas about going into show business?

327
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:13,400
No.
Why not?

328
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:15,708
Don't you like it?
No.

329
00:28:15,723 --> 00:28:17,483
You're a funny kid.

330
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,666
Oh, don't jump.
I ain't gonna bite.

331
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:23,300
Did you hear that?
Suppose that was for you, huh?

332
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,570
Everybody in the whole damn house
clapping and yelling.

333
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:28,117
Going nuts about ya.

334
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:29,900
Nice? No?

335
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,008
Why not?

336
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:33,430
You're a funny kid.

337
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:34,859
Just a little bit goofy.

338
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:36,770
But that's what comes
from not knowing what it's all about.

339
00:28:37,273 --> 00:28:38,503
Please, Mr. Nelson.

340
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:40,120
Didn't I ask you to call me Hitch?

341
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:41,989
I wanna be your pal, see?

342
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,879
And if you listen to me you'll let me learn you
a couple of dance routines

343
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,911
to put you in the show.
No, thank you.

344
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,232
I'm pretty sure
I don't want to be in the show.

345
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:51,278
But you've got the makings
of a great artist.

346
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:52,771
With your looks and my training

347
00:28:52,782 --> 00:28:55,742
it's Broadway for you, no foolin'.
You take the word of an old cue man.

348
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,711
That's the finale. Gotta go.
Seeya later, kid.

349
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:44,192
...and give your baby nights a lovin'...

350
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:51,227
Open up your eyes
and open up your lips

351
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,732
Why don't you try to get some sleep, precious?

352
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,040
I can't.

353
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:01,700
You oughta be plenty tired
after your trip and all.

354
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,900
Oh, I'm tired enough but...

355
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,249
I don't know. I feel funny.

356
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:11,025
All mixed up inside.

357
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:15,500
Why, precious. What's the matter?
Tell mother what's the matter.

358
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:19,553
Everything is so different
from what I thought it would be.

359
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:22,184
Sure. You ain't in a convent anymore.

360
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,046
But ain't you glad to be back with me again?

361
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:26,378
Yes, mommy darling, but...

362
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:28,822
I don't know how to describe it.

363
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,756
But New York's too big,

364
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:33,681
dirty and noisy.

365
00:30:33,695 --> 00:30:36,905
And your theater with all those men...

366
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:40,086
and the girls with no clothes on.

367
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:42,547
Oh, I suppose it does seem queer to you.

368
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:45,644
Coming from a place
where they cover everything but their noses.

369
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,665
But things ain't as bad as that.

370
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,289
It ain't what you do so much.
It's what you are.

371
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:53,000
That's it. It's what you are.

372
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:55,803
Why there's a couple of dames in this troupe

373
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:59,737
good at things you'd never expect to see,
even if they do make their living shaking.

374
00:31:00,122 --> 00:31:03,191
I ain't ashamed of it.
You shouldn't be ashamed of me neither.

375
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:05,700
Oh, mommy, I'm not ashamed of you.

376
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:08,756
Let me tell you something, April, baby.

377
00:31:08,772 --> 00:31:12,482
If it wasn't for the dough I've been piling up
that way in the last 10 or 12 years

378
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:15,049
you would never have been to no convent.

379
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,400
I know. I know.

380
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,200
That's what I've been thinking.

381
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:22,037
I'm just beginning to realize that.

382
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:25,688
All these things you've gone through
and I never knew.

383
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:31,246
Dancing with those girls.
Horrible men staring at you.

384
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:33,985
Saying awful things.

385
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:38,463
Now don't you think I'm going to be
in this burlesque racket all my life neither.

386
00:31:38,473 --> 00:31:43,303
Just one more season
with my name on Broadway in lights.

387
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:47,013
And the big dough.
Then we'll have a nice little home.

388
00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:49,235
And we'll be together and be happy.

389
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:52,079
Oh, mommy.

390
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:55,743
You've done so much to make me happy.

391
00:31:56,956 --> 00:32:00,446
From now on I'll try and make you
just as happy.

392
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:03,549
Oh, I ain't done nothing.

393
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:06,868
But we've got each other from now on
and it's gonna be for always.

394
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:09,189
Yes, for always.

395
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:12,268
And we'll be so happy together.

396
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:14,432
Just you and I.

397
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:16,143
You said it.

398
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:20,909
After all, snooks, things can't be all bad
as long as we got each other.

399
00:32:20,915 --> 00:32:22,805
Don't you forget that.

400
00:32:22,814 --> 00:32:25,364
Now you go to sleep, now.

401
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:32,145
Close your pretty eyes
and close your pretty lips

402
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:38,265
and give your baby nights a loving...

403
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,560
Mommy, about Mr. Nelson

404
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,230
What about him?

405
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:46,129
I don't think he likes me.

406
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:49,569
Aw, he's crazy about you.
Why, he said so.

407
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:53,394
Are you going to be married?

408
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:56,284
Really?
I don't know?

409
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,012
I don't know.

410
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:00,249
But don't you worry about it, now.

411
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,100
Go to sleep, baby.
Go to sleep.

412
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:09,672
Close your pretty eyes
and close your pretty lips

413
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,587
Oh, Holy Virgin...

414
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:16,576
by the pain...
in which our Lord Jesus Christ...

415
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:19,809
Bore the burden of our sins...

416
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:23,217
obtain for us

417
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:25,600
by thy intecession

418
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,314
the courage and strength

419
00:33:27,325 --> 00:33:29,765
Follow in his footsteps

420
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:32,618
and bear our cross

421
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:36,034
until the end of our lives.

422
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:38,333
Amen.

423
00:34:03,728 --> 00:34:04,988
What do you want?

424
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:10,474
You'll wake her up.

425
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,231
Get us a drink.

426
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:32,179
Oh, mommy. Mommy, the telephone.

427
00:35:32,189 --> 00:35:33,569
All right, baby.

428
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:39,133
Did you have a good sleep, angel?
Yes, thank you.

429
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:42,561
Hello. Oh, hello, Gus.
Good morning yourself.

430
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:47,661
Oh, is that all? Ok, we'll meet the troupe
at the station at three.

431
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:51,947
That was Gus Weinbaum from the booking office.
We open in Buffalo this week.

432
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:55,021
Better get up and get dressed, precious.
We gotta start packing.

433
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:58,806
Got a nice cold grapefruit
for you and a swell breakfast.

434
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:00,185
Oh, good.

435
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:01,900
We open in Buffalo tomorrow.

436
00:36:03,735 --> 00:36:05,945
Now Hitch, honey...

437
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:07,887
Let's settle our problems.

438
00:36:07,893 --> 00:36:11,343
You and me, we can't go on like we have
with April here.

439
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:13,671
We gotta get married now.

440
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:15,632
Well, it's up to you, Kitty.

441
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:18,084
It's okay with me like I told ya,

442
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,042
providing that kid of yours is put to work.

443
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,172
She will, honey, she is going to work,
but not in show business.

444
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:26,026
I got other plans for her.
There you go again.

445
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:27,891
What else can she do, I'm asking ya?

446
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,870
I mean, here we are,
jumping to Buffalo with that...

447
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,819
and from there, well, who knows?

448
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:35,611
Now if she gets a job in New York
that means she can't travel with us.

449
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,980
So, are you planning on leaving her alone here?

450
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,745
The kid's got a real chance in burlesque.
Don't you see that?

451
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:45,009
She's got youth, looks, the whole works.
She comes by it naturally.

452
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:47,451
I can make her one of the biggest bets
in show business.

453
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:50,339
But she don't wanna be in show business.
She said she hates it.

454
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:52,229
How does a kid like that
know what she wants?

455
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:55,542
Now listen, Kitty. I'm not gonna waste
any more time arguing.

456
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:57,888
I'm not gonna get married unless
I'm gonna be the boss.

457
00:36:57,899 --> 00:37:01,189
And if I'm gonna be the boss,
I say the kid is going into show.

458
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:04,344
That's final.
I don't know. Don't be cross at me, Hitch.

459
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:08,533
I'm trying to do the best all around.
If you think it's the right thing to do...

460
00:37:08,548 --> 00:37:10,808
Why, sure it is, babes.

461
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:14,393
You go on in there and get her.
I'll talk to her.

462
00:37:14,403 --> 00:37:18,813
I'll sell her the idea. She's getting
the swellest break a kid ever got.

463
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:21,842
We'll be one big happy family, huh?

464
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,380
The three of us.

465
00:37:23,395 --> 00:37:26,135
We'll go to Buffalo
or any other man's place, huh?

466
00:37:26,148 --> 00:37:28,268
Come on, get her in here.
April!

467
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:31,300
April, baby. Come here.
Mommy wants to talk to you.

468
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:34,955
Come here, baby.
Come to your daddy.

469
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,231
He's gonna pour a million dollars
in gold in your lap.

470
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,860
Here's to the bride and groom.

471
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:52,545
How's that?
Rotten.

472
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:53,983
Now look, now.

473
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:56,907
Don't!
What's the matter?

474
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,749
I don't like to be mauled
Too bad about you.

475
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:02,318
Maybe a good maul would do you good
for a change.

476
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:05,485
This touch-me-not stuff is beginning to give
me a pain in the neck.

477
00:39:06,797 --> 00:39:08,157
What's the idea of that?

478
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:10,169
It's too hot in here.
Yeah?

479
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,400
Come on,
let's run through that tap routine.

480
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:15,656
All right.

481
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,900
What's the matter with you?

482
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:20,359
You've been in the show eight months

483
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:22,956
and you got about as much ambition
as a Ziegfeld clothes horse.

484
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:25,311
Can't you take a little interest
in what I'm trying to teach you?

485
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:28,218
No. I hate dance.
And I hate burlesque.

486
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:30,567
You don't have to stay in burlesque.

487
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:34,989
Just give me a little cooperation
I'll make another Marilyn Miller out of you.

488
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,368
I'm not interested.

489
00:39:36,379 --> 00:39:38,939
Will you lay off that tone of voice?

490
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:41,315
Here I am. Trying to help you,
trying to be your pal.

491
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:44,267
You treat me like I was an ashman
or something.

492
00:39:44,271 --> 00:39:46,321
Jeez, you get my goat!

493
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:48,082
Why don't to let me alone.

494
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,170
Let you alone?

495
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,800
Listen, what you need is to have somebody
wake you up and make you be human.

496
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:56,117
I got a good mind to teach you a couple of tricks
they'd never learn you in a convent.

497
00:39:56,281 --> 00:39:58,761
You won't teach me anything.
Let go of my wrist.

498
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:01,316
I met babies like you before, Saint Cecilia.

499
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:03,500
There's only one way to treat them
and that's rough.

500
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:07,185
There, that's something to think about.

501
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,561
Oh, oh!

502
00:40:09,692 --> 00:40:13,000
What's going on here?
It's just that precious infant of yours
getting temperamental again.

503
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:14,612
Don't you two ever stop fighting?

504
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:17,289
here I am, working like a dog
trying to learn her the business.

505
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:18,520
Never mind.

506
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:21,750
What do you think that dirty little
Gus Weinbaum pulled on me this morning?

507
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:24,550
He said he ain't gonna give me a contract
for the new stock season...

508
00:40:24,597 --> 00:40:27,557
till I've been in the show for two weeks
and he can see how I get by.

509
00:40:27,576 --> 00:40:31,726
Not only that, he practically insists that I
go with a bunch of the girls...

510
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:35,170
to a lousy stag smoker in the Bronx after the show tonight.

511
00:40:35,178 --> 00:40:36,640
Can you beat that for a nerve?

512
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:40,341
Me, Kitty Darling,
dancing for a lot of drunk stags.

513
00:40:40,502 --> 00:40:42,422
Well, what of it? The problem with you
and that kid of yours

514
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:44,014
is you're both getting too high-hat.

515
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:45,461
Why, Hitchy.

516
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:51,653
What's the matter with you, cookie?
Oh, nothing.

517
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:53,956
You hadn't oughta be fighting all the time.

518
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:56,500
I'd like you'd to try to be nice
to him for a change.

519
00:40:56,513 --> 00:40:58,123
Try to make him love you, cookie.

520
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,950
Make him love me?
Yes, angel. Make him love you.

521
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,581
For my sake.

522
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:12,500
This is a swell night
to be going to a stag smoker.

523
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:14,387
Thought you were going to try
to get me out of it.

524
00:41:14,396 --> 00:41:17,006
Well, I argued with Gus
but it didn't do no good.

525
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:21,453
A good husband you are, letting Gus send your wife
to shake for a mob Bronx gorillas.

526
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:25,483
On such a hot night.
Well, fifty bucks is fifty bucks.

527
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:27,304
Ready to go home, mommy?

528
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:29,455
No, sweetness,
I gotta go to that stag smoker.

529
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,100
Hitch couldn't fix it for me with Gus.

530
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:33,134
I'll see that you get home okay, April.

531
00:41:33,144 --> 00:41:34,400
I gotta get going.

532
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:36,700
Come on, snooks,
walk out to the door with me.

533
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:38,489
You wait outside for me, April.

534
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,587
She will.
Mommy, take me with you, please.

535
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:43,645
To a stag party? I should say not.
I'll wait outside for you.

536
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:45,400
Till 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning?

537
00:41:45,413 --> 00:41:47,563
You're crazy.
Now you go back to the hotel.

538
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:49,583
I don't want to go back to the hotel
with Hitch.

539
00:41:49,598 --> 00:41:52,998
Please, mommy, please.
The girls in the taxi are waiting for you, Miss Darling.

540
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:55,651
Thanks, Otto.
Now you stop fussing about Hitch.

541
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:58,123
Be a good girl.
Maybe he'll buy you some chop suey.

542
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,770
I gotta tip him.
Mommy!

543
00:42:19,776 --> 00:42:21,900
Oh, hey, I've been waiting for you.

544
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:25,500
Oops! Hello, kid.
Hey give us a kiss.

545
00:42:25,518 --> 00:42:26,900
What's your hurry, sister?

546
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:28,917
Where are you going, baby?

547
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:33,005
Wait a minute, sweetheart.
Come on, baby, give me a break.

548
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,017
Say, listen now, just...

549
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,031
Say, who do you think you're messing with?
Stay away!

550
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:40,900
Hey, what's this?
Keep out of this. She's my girl.

551
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,575
I am not. He's following me.

552
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:45,325
On your way, guy, or I'll poke a hole
through that pant of yours.

553
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:46,800
You and Harmony Marines.

554
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:52,264
You Navy guys think you're tough, don't ya?

555
00:42:52,274 --> 00:42:54,444
They don't come any tougher.

556
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:00,170
Got any other odd jobs for the Navy tonight?
No, thank you so much.

557
00:43:00,188 --> 00:43:03,418
Pretty late for a little girl like you
to be wandering around by yourself.

558
00:43:03,426 --> 00:43:05,336
Maybe I'll have to stroll a little way with you.

559
00:43:05,346 --> 00:43:06,600
Oh, please don't bother.

560
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,260
Did you say "bother"?

561
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:19,001
Hope you don't think I'm fresh
walking along with you like this.

562
00:43:19,018 --> 00:43:20,518
Not at all.

563
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:23,388
I hope you don't think
I'm trying to follow you or anything.

564
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:24,829
Oh, no.

565
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:26,668
Live around here?
No.

566
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:30,464
I come all the way from Wisconsin.
Why don't you go back?

567
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,380
Say, I think you're trying to get rid of me.

568
00:43:34,393 --> 00:43:37,503
How did you guess?
Oh, I'm clever that way.

569
00:43:37,557 --> 00:43:40,377
What way?
Oh, come on, be nice, won't you?

570
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:42,381
I'm not a gorilla.
But I don't know you.

571
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:45,679
Well, use your chance.
No, listen, here's the idea.

572
00:43:45,688 --> 00:43:48,700
Why not let's stop somewhere and get something to eat?
There's no harm in that.

573
00:43:48,704 --> 00:43:51,354
And if you don't like the cut of my gib
I'll be on my way.

574
00:43:51,368 --> 00:43:53,888
Well, that seems fair enough.

575
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:56,459
I always eat after the show anyway.

576
00:43:56,464 --> 00:43:58,264
Now you're talking.

577
00:43:58,487 --> 00:44:00,777
Say, you're nice.
You don't look like a show girl.

578
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,441
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned it.

579
00:44:02,452 --> 00:44:04,602
No kidding, I like you.

580
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:07,077
And I guess you're not so bad yourself.

581
00:44:07,282 --> 00:44:09,232
Come on, Wisconsin.

582
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:17,352
Boy, was I hungry.
Me too.

583
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:20,216
Gee, you don't know
how much I appreciate this.

584
00:44:20,228 --> 00:44:23,218
No kidding. I mean,
I've been cruising around town all evening...

585
00:44:23,221 --> 00:44:25,251
up one street and down the other.

586
00:44:25,265 --> 00:44:27,005
Just looking for somebody to talk to.

587
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,001
Sailors don't generally have much trouble
finding company.

588
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:32,187
Oh, I don't want the kind of company you mean.

589
00:44:32,195 --> 00:44:34,645
Listen, all sailors ain't a bunch of bums.

590
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:39,132
But you got no idea how tough it is
to be all alone and lonesome in a city like this.

591
00:44:39,149 --> 00:44:40,659
Maybe I have.

592
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:42,608
Aw, a girl like you lonesome.

593
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:44,529
So, what's your name, anyway?

594
00:44:44,535 --> 00:44:47,255
I've been so excited about finding you
I forgot to ask.

595
00:44:47,263 --> 00:44:49,453
April.
April?

596
00:44:49,466 --> 00:44:51,100
No kidding?

597
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:52,987
Sounds like a name out of a book.

598
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:55,400
I don't know, though.
It sorta fits you.

599
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:59,086
Sounds sweet, sort of gentle.
Just like I bet you are.

600
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,680
Oh, you say the same thing
to every girl you meet.

601
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:04,215
How could I?
I never met a girl named April before.

602
00:45:05,823 --> 00:45:07,853
What's your name?
Tony.

603
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,670
I don't like it much.
Sounds like a white bootblack.

604
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:12,757
Oh, no, I think Tony's a nice name.

605
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:15,357
You do?
Tony and April.

606
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,120
Sounds nice together, eh?

607
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:19,978
Gee, but your eyes are blue.

608
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,665
Eat your chocolate cake.

609
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:29,177
April.

610
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:32,565
April.

611
00:45:32,577 --> 00:45:33,777
April.

612
00:45:33,784 --> 00:45:35,714
Why the little...

613
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,380
Hello, Ed?
Did April come in yet?

614
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:40,539
She didn't?

615
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,800
Are you sure?

616
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:42,813
Thanks.

617
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,135
The little...

618
00:46:06,142 --> 00:46:08,112
Those big waves...

619
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,470
Gosh, they look to be about as tall
as the Woolworth building, pretty near.

620
00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:14,819
They'd come down over the bough, crash.

621
00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:17,469
And the ship would shake
like it was gonna split in two.

622
00:46:17,487 --> 00:46:19,667
One big wave after the other.

623
00:46:19,675 --> 00:46:22,775
Boy, all night we didn't know
if we was gonna weather it or not.

624
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:24,917
Well, anyway...

625
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:26,555
next morning the sun was shining

626
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,825
the ocean was as smooth as glass.

627
00:46:28,837 --> 00:46:31,457
And right up the starboard
was the coast of China.

628
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:34,839
It must be wonderful
to sail all over the world that way.

629
00:46:34,847 --> 00:46:37,947
Oh, I don't know. You get tired of it
just like anything else.

630
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:41,125
I got a week to make up my mind
if I'm gonna enlist again.

631
00:46:41,206 --> 00:46:42,476
I suppose I will.

632
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:45,419
Sorry, pal. Closing time.

633
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:47,000
But the park is still open.

634
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:48,831
Okay, skipper.

635
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:51,511
I had no idea it was so late.

636
00:46:56,005 --> 00:46:57,480
Here you are.

637
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,443
Gee, I don't want to lose you so soon.

638
00:47:01,454 --> 00:47:03,000
Just when we were getting acquainted.

639
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:04,844
Can't we find some other place?

640
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:08,559
But it's pretty late.
I know just the place. It's nice and cool too.

641
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:09,660
Where?

642
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:10,765
Brooklyn Bridge.

643
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:40,526
Isn't it beautiful?

644
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:44,863
Yeah. Sure is pretty.

645
00:47:47,176 --> 00:47:48,976
Even Brooklyn looks pretty.

646
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,470
It must be awfully late.

647
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:57,200
What do you care?
My mother will be worried.

648
00:47:57,205 --> 00:48:00,055
I do have to sleep some time.

649
00:48:00,074 --> 00:48:01,954
They have rehearsal at eleven.

650
00:48:04,169 --> 00:48:06,489
Well, I won't get much sleep tonight.

651
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:10,617
It's too hot to sleep.

652
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,250
I mean, I'll be thinking about you.

653
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:19,847
Look at that city over there.

654
00:48:20,753 --> 00:48:22,633
Everybody sleeping.

655
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,930
Everybody dreaming.

656
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:28,944
And two people like us, on this bridge

657
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:32,000
just as if we've known each other
all our lives.

658
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:35,566
It's sort of like a dream too,
isn't it?

659
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,002
Yeah.

660
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:42,027
Pretty soon the sun will come up

661
00:48:42,037 --> 00:48:43,837
and the people will wake up.

662
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:48,000
and even you and I will go right on
the way we were before.

663
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:50,784
Just as if we'd never met at all.

664
00:48:50,796 --> 00:48:52,626
Say, don't kid yourself.

665
00:48:52,636 --> 00:48:56,566
I'm gonna camp right on your doorstep
the rest of the time I'm on leave.

666
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:57,769
How long is that?

667
00:48:57,778 --> 00:49:01,558
Saturday. This is Tuesday.
That makes four days.

668
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:04,365
And then you'll forget all about me.

669
00:49:04,377 --> 00:49:06,200
No, sir. Never.

670
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:07,649
Yes, you will.

671
00:49:07,657 --> 00:49:10,387
You'll go sailing away from me,

672
00:49:10,393 --> 00:49:12,643
just like that boat down there will now.

673
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:16,285
A tanker going out with the tide.

674
00:49:17,393 --> 00:49:19,833
Ships have to go out with the tide,
don't they?

675
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:23,300
And sailors have to go with their ships.

676
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,450
And the world is full of other
rivers and bridges

677
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:30,173
with girls to sit on them
till the tide goes out.

678
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:34,843
Oh, April, I'm not like the rest of those gobs.

679
00:49:36,858 --> 00:49:40,378
Sometimes I think there are people
who were just meant to be lonesome.

680
00:49:40,385 --> 00:49:41,755
You know,

681
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:45,119
and then they'll meet someone
for a little while

682
00:49:45,523 --> 00:49:48,213
and it gives them something to remember.

683
00:49:49,127 --> 00:49:52,627
So their lonesomeness doesn't hurt
so much for a while.

684
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:55,371
I don't know how to say what I mean.

685
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,833
Yes, but if those people meet
the right people

686
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,770
they get together for keeps.

687
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,000
Then they ain't lonesome anymore.

688
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:06,389
But the right people
don't seem to find each other very often.

689
00:50:09,194 --> 00:50:10,624
Yeah, ain't it the truth.

690
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:20,245
Well, Tony...

691
00:50:23,758 --> 00:50:26,578
Well...
I've got to go home.

692
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:28,983
I don't want to, but I've got to.

693
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:33,095
Right. Let me help you down.

694
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:50,135
Good night.

695
00:50:50,145 --> 00:50:52,165
Or rather, good morning.

696
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:54,749
Don't forget tomorrow. It's a date.

697
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:56,345
I won't.

698
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:58,486
I hope I'm gonna live that long.

699
00:50:58,497 --> 00:51:00,467
Just don't stop breathing.

700
00:51:03,173 --> 00:51:05,223
Looks like I just can't let you go.

701
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:07,589
I've really got to go now.

702
00:51:09,897 --> 00:51:10,977
Well...

703
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:13,195
Well...

704
00:51:16,008 --> 00:51:17,410
Good night.

705
00:51:17,524 --> 00:51:18,500
Good night.

706
00:51:32,671 --> 00:51:36,511
Good night, girls. Go right home, now.
Leave that taxi driver alone.

707
00:51:37,134 --> 00:51:39,614
Hello, sailor boy.
Hello, yourself.

708
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,085
What's the rush, sailor boy?

709
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,560
Well, young lady,
where do you think you've been?

710
00:51:54,575 --> 00:51:57,800
Is mommy in yet?
Never mind. Who've you been out with
until 5 o'clock in the morning?

711
00:51:57,947 --> 00:51:59,047
None of your business.

712
00:51:59,131 --> 00:52:02,900
A pickup, huh? A pickup just like every other
cheap little burlesque dame.

713
00:52:02,914 --> 00:52:05,274
I'm not a cheap little burlesque dame.
No?

714
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,500
Just an innocent kid from a convent, huh?

715
00:52:07,506 --> 00:52:08,881
Well get this through your head.

716
00:52:08,891 --> 00:52:12,531
If you're gonna start this stay-out-all-night stuff
I'm gonna have something to say about it myself.

717
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:15,028
Charity begins at home, baby.
Let me go!

718
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,649
Let me go...

719
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:20,205
Well, what's this?

720
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:24,273
Hello, beautiful. You're just in time to witness
the signing of the Peace Treaty.

721
00:52:24,285 --> 00:52:26,535
While we was waiting for you
we come to an understanding.

722
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:30,437
Everything's jake now.
April April, is it true?

723
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:32,800
Just one big happy family from now on.

724
00:52:32,806 --> 00:52:34,986
Everything's swell okay.

725
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:38,080
One big happy family, hooray!

726
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:44,200
Oooh, gee wiz, I gotta lie down,

727
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,430
Gee.
Look at all those people down there.

728
00:53:12,744 --> 00:53:14,854
Aren't there a lot of people
in the word, though?

729
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,550
Only two as far as I'm concerned.

730
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:23,174
Look.

731
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:27,173
Just look.

732
00:53:27,188 --> 00:53:31,500
I'd hate to fall.
If you did, I'd fall right after you.

733
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:34,218
Wouldn't that be silly?

734
00:53:51,004 --> 00:53:53,764
Look, the Woolworth Building.
Yeah.

735
00:53:58,272 --> 00:54:00,022
That's some sight, isn't it?

736
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:01,600
Oh, it's wonderful.

737
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,180
You are wonderful.

738
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,320
Well, there's the sea.
Yes.

739
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:14,969
Look at the old Statue of Liberty.

740
00:54:14,977 --> 00:54:18,967
I bet if I stood here I could see your ship
when it leaves tonight.

741
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:21,117
I should wave my handkerchief.

742
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:26,700
What are you laughing at?

743
00:54:28,008 --> 00:54:30,748
Well, April, I'm not going back to my ship.

744
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:31,932
Why not?

745
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:34,790
Well, I got an important date tomorrow.

746
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:36,451
Have you?
Hm-hm.

747
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:39,453
And so have you.
We're gonna be married.

748
00:54:39,461 --> 00:54:42,711
Oh, I thought for a minute you were serious.

749
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,970
I am.

750
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,419
You're gonna marry me...

751
00:54:45,428 --> 00:54:47,832
and we're going back to my home town in Wisconsin

752
00:54:47,862 --> 00:54:52,452
and graze wheat and have a Ford,
a radio, well, and several things.

753
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,620
We are not.

754
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:55,032
Oh, yes we are.

755
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,040
You're gonna marry me.
It's all decided.

756
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,160
I decided it.
Did you?

757
00:54:59,178 --> 00:55:01,591
You better say yes.
I don't see why.

758
00:55:01,601 --> 00:55:05,351
Because if you don't,
I'll jump right off this roof.

759
00:55:05,362 --> 00:55:07,412
Oh, Tony!
Yes!

760
00:55:30,524 --> 00:55:32,244
Aw, gee, I'm happy.

761
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:33,991
Aren't you?
Yes.

762
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,330
What I know about sailors, they 

763
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:47,041
But I believe everything
you told me about yourself and your folks.

764
00:55:47,078 --> 00:55:50,518
I think you're on the level.
You bet I'm on the level, Miss Darling.

765
00:55:50,523 --> 00:55:52,603
You gotta be good to my little girl.

766
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:55,737
She's just a baby.
Don't worry about that.

767
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,500
She'll love it out in the country.

768
00:55:57,506 --> 00:55:59,316
My folks will be crazy about her.

769
00:55:59,671 --> 00:56:02,351
Well, that's that, I suppose.

770
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:06,087
I'm glad. I never wanted April to be in show business.

771
00:56:06,095 --> 00:56:08,365
My baby angel.

772
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,940
What's the next thing on the program?

773
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:14,200
Why, I thought we all might all have dinner
some place to celebrate.

774
00:56:14,206 --> 00:56:16,700
Where? You gotta make it early.
I have a show.

775
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:19,124
How about that chop suey place
we was at the other night?

776
00:56:19,134 --> 00:56:20,784
That's fine.
Okay, about six?

777
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:23,478
Great. Well, I'll be running along.

778
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:25,941
Goodbye for a little while, sweetheart.

779
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:33,371
Oh, excuse me.

780
00:56:36,883 --> 00:56:38,263
You're all right, son.

781
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:52,000
Was that the boyfreind we've been hearing so much about
I've just run across in the hall?

782
00:56:52,003 --> 00:56:53,733
Mommy, I'll go in and change my dress.

783
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:55,065
Wait a minute, I'm talking to you.

784
00:56:55,073 --> 00:56:57,273
This playing around with the Navy's gotta stop.

785
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,200
Oh, let her alone.
She's got a date with her fiance.

786
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:01,320
Her what?

787
00:57:01,322 --> 00:57:02,722
The man she's gonna marry.

788
00:57:02,737 --> 00:57:04,047
Are you trying to kid me?

789
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:06,178
No, April's gonna be married.

790
00:57:06,182 --> 00:57:09,592
You're telling me you're gonna allow April
to marry some lousy gob?

791
00:57:09,602 --> 00:57:12,490
Oh, he's all right. I like him.
We had a long talk.

792
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:14,151
You had a long talk.

793
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,086
Well, how about consulting me once in a while?

794
00:57:16,096 --> 00:57:18,926
Oh, turn your dapper down.
Everything's under control.

795
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:21,007
Oh, it is, is it?
That's what you say.

796
00:57:21,014 --> 00:57:24,384
Now me just back from a two-hour session
at the Keith Office getting our acts set.

797
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,980
What's that got to do with April?

798
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:27,771
Everything.
They want her to do it with me.

799
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,450
But that's our act.
Yours and mine.

800
00:57:29,462 --> 00:57:32,582
Well, it's all been changed.
It's April or the whole proposition's cold.

801
00:57:32,597 --> 00:57:35,067
They want a younger woman in the act,
that's all, luscious.

802
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:38,230
A younger woman?
Yeah, they want it younger, like April.

803
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:41,838
She's ideal.
A smile like hers is worth a million dollars.

804
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:44,215
She's got a swell figure
and a pair of legs that...

805
00:57:44,225 --> 00:57:45,925
Why, she's got more sex-appeal than...

806
00:57:45,931 --> 00:57:48,192
For a dame you couldn't stand the sight of
a few days ago...

807
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:51,282
you seem to be taking a big interest in April
and her sex-appeal.

808
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:53,341
Professionally, sure.
Yeah?

809
00:57:53,354 --> 00:57:55,900
I wanna see her get ahead.
I got our future in mind.

810
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,059
What about my future?

811
00:57:57,069 --> 00:57:59,769
Now, beautiful.
Beautiful my eye. Listen, Hitch Nelson.

812
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:01,410
Nobody's gonna do that act but me, see?

813
00:58:01,426 --> 00:58:03,816
I don't know what you and the Keith Office
got up your sleeve

814
00:58:03,822 --> 00:58:05,752
but nobody's double-crossing Kitty Darling.

815
00:58:05,766 --> 00:58:06,876
Oh, yeah?

816
00:58:06,886 --> 00:58:09,906
Well, I'll show you how much
I'm double-crossing ya, wise girl.

817
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:12,338
You don't have to know I spent the whole morning
with Gus Weinbaum

818
00:58:12,344 --> 00:58:15,008
begging him to keep you in your own show.
What are you trying to give me now?

819
00:58:15,018 --> 00:58:17,600
Your two weeks is up tonight
and Gus is all set to can ya.

820
00:58:17,638 --> 00:58:18,768
You're a dirty liar.

821
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:21,668
All right. Phone Gus
and find out for yourself.

822
00:58:21,675 --> 00:58:23,515
Well, I'm certainly going to call you
on that one.

823
00:58:23,528 --> 00:58:26,428
Bryant 9483.

824
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:28,873
We'll just have a little showdown around here.

825
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:30,068
It will suit me fine.

826
00:58:30,078 --> 00:58:32,948
Hello, I want to speak to Gus Weinbaum.
This is Miss Darling.

827
00:58:32,959 --> 00:58:34,659
Hello, Kitty?

828
00:58:34,664 --> 00:58:36,024
What's on your mind?

829
00:58:36,038 --> 00:58:39,680
What's this I hear about you not renewing my contract
after the show tonight?

830
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,050
Well, you haven't got that quite right, Kitty.

831
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:45,072
The fact is I got Lou working on a book now...

832
00:58:45,085 --> 00:58:46,935
called "The Boarding School Girls".

833
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:49,841
And it's gotta have somebody in it that's young.

834
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:51,948
An ingenue lead, see?

835
00:58:51,957 --> 00:58:55,287
Ingenue lead? I know the stuff the boys
there out front want...

836
00:58:55,295 --> 00:58:57,285
I don't know why you shouldn't write
that book around me.

837
00:58:57,295 --> 00:58:59,315
You're not gonna be left out.

838
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:03,287
I got you down for a specialty number
and a runway number...

839
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,135
so where do you get in to squawk?

840
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,240
I'm a liar, eh?

841
00:59:07,259 --> 00:59:08,789
I'll show Gus where he gets off.

842
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,135
I'll have a contract in my own terms
in ten minutes.

843
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,628
Hello, girlie, get me Bryant 9400.

844
00:59:13,836 --> 00:59:16,056
Hello, I wanna speak to Dave Holtz.

845
00:59:16,068 --> 00:59:18,518
I'll show the dirty little...
Hello, Dave.

846
00:59:18,544 --> 00:59:19,964
This is Kitty Darling.

847
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:23,046
Say, Dave, I'm closing
with Parisian Flirts tonight.

848
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:26,275
How about grabbing yourself a real bet
for your Summer Widows?

849
00:59:26,283 --> 00:59:30,190
Thought I'd give you first crack
instead of fooling around with other stuff.

850
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,970
Well, you better take him.

851
00:59:32,988 --> 00:59:34,628
I got nothing for you.

852
00:59:45,029 --> 00:59:48,809
Twenty managers killed in the rush.
I got plenty of friends in this town.

853
00:59:48,811 --> 00:59:52,671
Ah, save your nickels, you may need them.
None of your wisecracks, Hitch Nelson.

854
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:55,256
It takes a wise girl to know when to quit
and that's no wisecrack.

855
00:59:55,364 --> 00:59:58,214
Quit what?
Show business. Can't you see you're all washed out?

856
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:01,008
Why, you...
What have you got left to give'em?

857
01:00:01,023 --> 01:00:04,133
You've been in it for twenty years.
Why kid yourself? You ain't kidding anybody else.

858
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,460
You mind your own business.

859
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,978
I'm not letting any cheap comic
tell me how to run my affairs.

860
01:00:07,981 --> 01:00:11,511
Cheap comic, eh? If it hadn't been for me
telling you how to run your affairs

861
01:00:11,527 --> 01:00:14,667
you'd have been through long ago.
You're a joke. You're just a fat old woman.

862
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:16,929
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Look at that neck, look at them wrinkles.

863
01:00:16,934 --> 01:00:20,714
You better get wise to yourself and figure out
where the coffee and cake's money is coming from next season.

864
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:23,171
Right in that room is your meal ticket
from now on.

865
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:26,651
And you let her marry some dope from the Brooklyn Navy
outright when you needed her most.

866
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:30,541
She's gonna marry him too, if I have to buy a tin cup
and sell pencils on Broadway.

867
01:00:30,555 --> 01:00:32,375
Not after I have a talk with her tonight.

868
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,553
If you dare to open your trap to her tonight
we're through.

869
01:00:34,566 --> 01:00:35,726
I'm fired, eh?

870
01:00:35,738 --> 01:00:37,878
Well, you're wrong. I quit, see?
So what do you think of that?

871
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,600
I'm sick of seeing you around here.

872
01:00:39,604 --> 01:00:41,664
I guess I got everything out of you I want, babes.

873
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:44,840
I got plans
and they don't include any old blondes.

874
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:46,831
Get out! Get out before I kill you.

875
01:00:49,304 --> 01:00:51,144
See you in the show business, beautiful

876
01:01:22,164 --> 01:01:23,854
Mommy, you look tired.

877
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:25,187
I am a little.

878
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:28,871
Maybe you'd better rest a little for a while
instead of coming to dinner with us.

879
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:30,647
I think I'd better.

880
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:33,811
You two don't want any old ladies along anyway.

881
01:01:33,826 --> 01:01:36,206
You run along to your sailor boy.

882
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:38,319
Mommy. Mommy.

883
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:40,840
Tell me, what's the matter?

884
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,810
Mommy, I'm not going to be married.

885
01:01:45,816 --> 01:01:49,000
I'm never going to go away from you now.

886
01:01:49,008 --> 01:01:52,558
You heard Hitch and me
yelling at each other, is that it?

887
01:01:52,563 --> 01:01:56,353
Come on now, cookie.
Don't go taking it that serious.

888
01:01:56,362 --> 01:02:00,682
You know how Hitch and me are,
always rowing about something.

889
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:02,777
He don't mean what he says half the time.

890
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:06,017
By tomorrow we'll both of us forget
all about it...

891
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:07,866
Everything's okay.

892
01:02:07,872 --> 01:02:09,732
Don't let a thing like that get you down.

893
01:02:09,742 --> 01:02:14,400
You run along now see your sailor boy.
Stop being that way.

894
01:02:14,476 --> 01:02:18,866
No, mommy. I'm going to tell Tony
I can't marry him.

895
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,400
But you must marry him, snooks.

896
01:02:21,415 --> 01:02:23,235
After all we talked over?

897
01:02:23,247 --> 01:02:26,377
I'm counting on it.
You don't know how much it means to me.

898
01:02:27,783 --> 01:02:30,333
No, mommy.
I just can't, that's all.

899
01:02:30,376 --> 01:02:31,906
Now you listen to me, young lady.

900
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:35,151
I'm your ma, and I say you're going right down
to dinner and fix it up.

901
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,900
and there'll be no more talk about it.

902
01:02:36,904 --> 01:02:40,174
All right, mommy.
I'll fix it up.

903
01:02:40,192 --> 01:02:45,112
And when I come to the theater tonight
I wanna be sure you're gonna tell me everything's okay.

904
01:02:45,124 --> 01:02:47,424
It will be.
It will be.

905
01:02:47,436 --> 01:02:49,826
Come on now, kitten.

906
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:53,588
You gotta do this.
And don't worry about me.

907
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:56,500
I'm not a black number yet.

908
01:02:56,509 --> 01:02:57,999
I know, mommy.

909
01:05:53,207 --> 01:05:55,017
Boy, that's happy music.

910
01:05:55,224 --> 01:05:56,999
Just for us.

911
01:05:57,355 --> 01:05:59,045
Wanna dance?
No.

912
01:06:00,054 --> 01:06:02,834
Wish you didn't have to work tonight.
We could go to Coney Island.

913
01:06:02,845 --> 01:06:04,275
I don't like Coney Island.

914
01:06:04,285 --> 01:06:06,700
Aw, come on, you don't.
You did the other night.

915
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,258
That was the other night.

916
01:06:08,461 --> 01:06:10,300
What's the matter with you, honey?

917
01:06:10,308 --> 01:06:12,098
Why? Nothing.

918
01:06:12,103 --> 01:06:13,523
Oh, yes there is.

919
01:06:13,532 --> 01:06:14,872
Come on, let's have it.

920
01:06:16,985 --> 01:06:18,225
Tony, I'll tell you.

921
01:06:19,237 --> 01:06:21,187
I don't know how to say it, but...

922
01:06:22,096 --> 01:06:24,036
Tony, I don't want to get married.

923
01:06:25,044 --> 01:06:27,800
Say, don't say things like that,
I got a week heart.

924
01:06:27,814 --> 01:06:29,264
Tony, I mean it.

925
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:32,421
I like you an awful lot
and all that...

926
01:06:33,334 --> 01:06:35,914
but I just can't think of getting married
right now.

927
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:38,700
What's the matter, honey?
What's happened?

928
01:06:40,003 --> 01:06:41,553
Nothing.

929
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:44,806
I don't think you'll be able to understand, but...

930
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:47,831
Being born on the stage and all

931
01:06:47,854 --> 01:06:51,874
well, getting married and leaving,
it seems to be giving up everything.

932
01:06:51,892 --> 01:06:55,000
You told me the other night
you wanted to get out of the show business.

933
01:06:55,004 --> 01:06:56,764
That's how I thought I felt.

934
01:06:56,774 --> 01:07:00,524
When I come right down to it,
I just can't, that's all.

935
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,575
You'll never know, Tony,

936
01:07:03,593 --> 01:07:06,400
what it feels like to be on the other side
of those footlights.

937
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:08,700
and to hear them clap and clap for you.

938
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:11,594
It does something to a girl.

939
01:07:11,803 --> 01:07:13,600
I don't know what.

940
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,770
April, I don't believe a word you're saying.

941
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:20,259
Either you're lying to me
or else you've just been kidding yourself.

942
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,600
Now, come on,
let's dance and forget about it.

943
01:07:22,617 --> 01:07:24,023
I don't want to dance.

944
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:27,977
I want you to get it through your head
right now.

945
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:31,328
This is it, really.

946
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:34,782
Mother signed a new contract today
for a new show.

947
01:07:34,836 --> 01:07:38,376
And there's a chance
for me to go with her in a splendid part.

948
01:07:39,386 --> 01:07:43,156
If I don't take it
I know I'll be sorry all my life.

949
01:07:43,161 --> 01:07:45,681
Then we'll both be miserable.

950
01:07:45,693 --> 01:07:48,303
But listen, honey.
That's no life for you.

951
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:53,200
Well, I'm not so sure that married life
in some godforsaken farm is a life for me either.

952
01:07:53,873 --> 01:07:56,690
After all, I'm young.
People tell me I'm pretty.

953
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,360
Here I've got a big chance.

954
01:07:58,379 --> 01:08:00,609
I might be a star.

955
01:08:00,616 --> 01:08:03,690
Now, I ask you, Tony...

956
01:08:03,703 --> 01:08:07,613
what girl wouldn't grab at the chance
to land on Broadway in a big show?

957
01:08:07,923 --> 01:08:10,063
None, I suppose.

958
01:08:10,073 --> 01:08:11,863
Not since you're locked to them.

959
01:08:11,873 --> 01:08:15,353
Let's pray it ended up
with nothing to be locked with right now.

960
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:20,977
Tony, don't look at me like that.

961
01:08:22,323 --> 01:08:24,120
Makes me feel terrible.

962
01:08:24,127 --> 01:08:27,777
I really think
you're an awfully sweet boy, but

963
01:08:27,783 --> 01:08:32,763
after all, when it comes to love,
why, I've only known you five days.

964
01:08:32,777 --> 01:08:36,300
You think of jumping into something

965
01:08:36,376 --> 01:08:38,426
and giving up a whole career...

966
01:08:39,434 --> 01:08:41,404
Well, Tony, you ought to understand.

967
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:42,417
Sure.

968
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:45,627
I mean,
we'll still have lots of fun together.

969
01:08:45,633 --> 01:08:50,133
Just the same. Go to lots of parties.
Why, we might even still be engaged.

970
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:53,549
No. I wouldn't want to feel
like I'm tying you down.

971
01:08:53,554 --> 01:08:56,564
Guess I'd better go back to my ship.

972
01:08:56,773 --> 01:09:00,473
You mean, enlist again?
Yeah.

973
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:03,310
Sailing for the West Indies.

974
01:09:04,219 --> 01:09:06,399
I've always wanted to see the West Indies.

975
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:07,871
But you'll come back.

976
01:09:07,882 --> 01:09:09,422
Sure, some day.

977
01:09:12,533 --> 01:09:14,323
What time is it?

978
01:09:15,836 --> 01:09:17,826
Eight o'clock, almost.

979
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:19,500
I could just make it if I hurry.

980
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:20,590
Tony!

981
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,520
You're angry with me.

982
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:26,916
I didn't want you to be.

983
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,610
Tony, please try not to hate me.

984
01:09:32,129 --> 01:09:34,180
Please try to understand.

985
01:09:34,188 --> 01:09:36,678
This was the best way for us both.

986
01:09:37,584 --> 01:09:40,883
I don't hate you.
I just gotta hurry, that's all.

987
01:09:40,893 --> 01:09:43,463
You ought to be getting down
to your show too, don't you?

988
01:09:44,576 --> 01:09:47,236
I'll walk to the subway with you.
It's on my way.

989
01:09:47,245 --> 01:09:49,000
You'll be late.
I don't care.

990
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,052
Check, please.

991
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:30,300
Seventh floor, mam.
Good night, Jim, I'll see you in the morning.

992
01:10:30,308 --> 01:10:31,848
Good night, honey.

993
01:10:58,659 --> 01:10:59,619
Well,

994
01:10:59,766 --> 01:11:01,886
thanks for coming down with me, April.

995
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:03,451
Oh, that was all right.

996
01:11:52,509 --> 01:11:55,029
Well, here's my train.

997
01:11:55,839 --> 01:11:57,569
Bye, April.

998
01:11:57,576 --> 01:11:58,916
Bye, Tony.

999
01:12:53,729 --> 01:12:57,249
Don't cry, kid.
There'll be another one along any minute.

1000
01:12:57,253 --> 01:12:58,810
Cheer up.

1001
01:13:49,796 --> 01:13:50,796
April!

1002
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:53,608
April!

1003
01:13:57,419 --> 01:13:58,419
April!

1004
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,641
April! April!

1005
01:14:14,816 --> 01:14:16,390
Aw, be quiet!

1006
01:14:21,434 --> 01:14:23,284
Where's April?
Where's April?

1007
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,570
Mother!
What's the matter?

1008
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:29,562
Help me to my dressing room

1009
01:14:30,688 --> 01:14:32,358
Well I'll be...

1010
01:14:32,368 --> 01:14:34,358
Where did she get?

1011
01:14:34,368 --> 01:14:39,238
Mother, you're sick.
Don't worry about me.

1012
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,730
Is everything all right?
Everything's fine.

1013
01:14:41,746 --> 01:14:43,800
Are you gonna be married right away?

1014
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,040
No, I sent him back to his ship, ma.

1015
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:49,730
What's this you're saying?
You lie down, you'll feel better.

1016
01:14:49,747 --> 01:14:52,500
Tell me, tell me.
Don't worry, it's all over.

1017
01:14:52,505 --> 01:14:53,808
I sent him away.

1018
01:14:53,818 --> 01:14:56,348
I guess it is jolly life on board.

1019
01:14:56,355 --> 01:14:58,504
It's a good thing we found out in time.

1020
01:14:58,514 --> 01:15:01,100
Oh, nothing matters now but you, mommy.

1021
01:15:01,106 --> 01:15:03,500
We'll always have each other.

1022
01:15:03,508 --> 01:15:06,238
Nothing's ever going to separate us again.

1023
01:15:06,247 --> 01:15:09,700
Oh, my God. What have you done?
What have I done?

1024
01:15:09,707 --> 01:15:11,457
Mommy, you're not well.

1025
01:15:11,466 --> 01:15:14,006
My baby, my little baby.

1026
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:18,900
Well, this is a swell time to be showing up
for a Saturday night show.

1027
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:20,368
What's the matter with her?
Drunk?

1028
01:15:20,388 --> 01:15:21,590
Well, what if she is?

1029
01:15:22,098 --> 01:15:26,038
Drunk as a fool,
look at her lying there, the gin-soaked old...

1030
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:29,061
You let my mother alone!
You men make me sick.

1031
01:15:29,078 --> 01:15:30,528
You don't care about anything

1032
01:15:30,537 --> 01:15:33,237
as long as you can shove somebody
on your filthy stage.

1033
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,126
and make them shake for a bunch of gorillas.

1034
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:37,316
Yeah? Well that talk don't get me anywhere.

1035
01:15:37,336 --> 01:15:40,157
So far as I'm concerned Kitty Darling's finished.

1036
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:43,802
Here I talk to Gus Weinbaum
trying to keep her in the show here...

1037
01:15:43,812 --> 01:15:48,372
and look at her, blind, paralyzed,
Saturday night with nobody to take her place.

1038
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:50,212
I'll take her place.

1039
01:15:50,288 --> 01:15:52,738
I'll get out there and get those gorillas
your money's worth.

1040
01:15:52,961 --> 01:15:54,009
Now what do you think of that?

1041
01:15:54,019 --> 01:15:57,929
Me take a chance on a dumb chorus girl
to fill a specialty number?

1042
01:15:57,937 --> 01:15:58,937
You're crazy!

1043
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:01,146
Listen, she ain't so dumb.
I've been rehearsing her for weeks.

1044
01:16:01,152 --> 01:16:02,342
She's swell, I'm telling ya.

1045
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:05,321
Anyway ain't it be better
take a chance with the kid?

1046
01:16:05,336 --> 01:16:08,456
Well, maybe it is.
Hop to it, kid. But you'd better be good.

1047
01:16:08,462 --> 01:16:11,201
Come on, baby, wake up.
Oh, I'll be good all right.

1048
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,150
I'll get out and give them what they want.

1049
01:16:13,163 --> 01:16:16,113
I'll show them, I'll show them!
Now you're talkin'.

1050
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,702
You get out of my way.

1051
01:16:19,495 --> 01:16:20,745
Well I'll be...

1052
01:17:44,872 --> 01:17:46,822
Come on, get out there and play again.
No!

1053
01:17:46,843 --> 01:17:50,033
Come on, get out there.
No!

1054
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:53,449
Come on, girls, get out there.
Do something.

1055
01:17:53,457 --> 01:17:55,267
Go ahead, get onstage there...

1056
01:17:55,728 --> 01:17:57,128
Come on, you get onstage too.

1057
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,950
Tony!
Tony!

1058
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:05,105
I came back because I thought,
well, maybe...

1059
01:18:05,115 --> 01:18:09,015
Take me away from this terrible place.

1060
01:18:09,165 --> 01:18:10,385
You mean it?

1061
01:18:10,397 --> 01:18:12,827
I never want to be in the stage again.

1062
01:18:12,835 --> 01:18:14,925
You know, I had a hunch
you weren't telling me the truth.

1063
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:16,889
Aw, come on, what's it all about?

1064
01:18:16,898 --> 01:18:18,638
It's mother.

1065
01:18:18,641 --> 01:18:21,300
Tony, I can't go away and leave her now.

1066
01:18:21,362 --> 01:18:24,400
She's sick. She needs a home.

1067
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,348
Then let her come with us.
That'll be swell.

1068
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:29,539
Come on, let's go in and talk to her.
I bet I can make her see it our way.

1069
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,643
It would be wonderful if she would.

1070
01:18:31,929 --> 01:18:35,400
We'll always be together, won't we?

1071
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:37,789
Yes, honey.
All three of us.

1072
01:18:38,902 --> 01:18:40,882
All three of us.

1073
01:18:43,991 --> 01:18:58,200
