1
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:26,077
- I almost burst!
- I made you!

2
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,516
I hope you burst, so I won't
ever have to see you again!

3
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:31,724
- Picking a fight again?
- You are! You block-head!

4
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,407
- Get lost, you insect!
- You sorry excuse of a man!

5
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:37,758
- Madalena, no more words I said!
- Lambis, no more fighting!

6
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,203
Congratulations for your son.

7
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:44,397
And for your daughter
the blabber-mouth!

8
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:46,836
My Madalena was sweet,
she spoke only kind words.

9
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:49,077
Our dispute is to blame!
Let's make peace.

10
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:52,239
- Then stop being a boatman.
- I was born a boatman.

11
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:54,557
I don't know how to do
anything else. I'll starve.

12
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:57,759
You were a farmer. You became
a seaman just five years ago.

13
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:01,004
And I'll remain a seaman,
until I make you a farmer.

14
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:04,244
You and you mulishness! That's
why they call you captain Windy!

15
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:07,364
And you, captain Calm.
You're such a sorry man!

16
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,639
Who's coming with our boat?

17
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:18,804
Come with the Flying Bird!

18
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:22,079
In half an hour,
you'll be in Hora.

19
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:25,404
Come with the Island Dolphin!

20
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:28,758
In half an hour it can
bring you back to White Island.

21
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:32,197
Whoever comes with me
goes fast!

22
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:35,077
Get out of my way!

23
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:37,197
- I had a bad dream!
- I had a great dream!

24
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:40,558
- I saw you got no passengers!
- Get out of my way!

25
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,477
I almost choked!

26
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:08,718
The damn thing won't work!

27
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:20,036
You're deafening me!

28
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:27,557
What are you laughing at?
She's sly.

29
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,717
- She's a girl!
- She's a hazard!

30
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,877
Don't take her
as a daughter-in-law.

31
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,162
- I rather drown.
- Since you can't swim.

32
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:37,359
- Watch your mouth, Cosmas!
- Don't threaten me!

33
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:41,156
I'll stick your head in the sea
and you'll make bubbles...

34
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,403
...like the mayor's hookah!

35
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,723
- Get it?
- Are you telling me?

36
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:52,757
Mr. Mayor...

37
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:57,120
Mr. Baroutis,
may I ask you something?

38
00:04:57,207 --> 00:05:00,358
- Do I have the permission...
- You have it.

39
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:04,278
What shall we do with the boatmen? 
They're fighting like dogs.

40
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:07,877
- Let them fight.
- But, we fight, too.

41
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:12,125
- The village is cut in two.
- Just like we were with politics.

42
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,163
Half of you
are with captain Cosmas...

43
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:17,721
and the other half
with captain Giorgaros.

44
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:19,957
You get it out of your system...

45
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:23,159
and, in the end,
you all vote for me.

46
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:26,359
We also vote for you
to keep unity in the island.

47
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:29,604
But does this island
want unity?

48
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,724
- Of course it does, father.
- No, it doesn't.

49
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:35,964
Don't you remember
when we were divided again...

50
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,477
half with father Anestis,
may he rest in peace...

51
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,723
and the other half, with me?

52
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:45,038
Two churches, two parishes,
two priests!

53
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:49,925
And you were with father Anestis,
may he rest in peace.

54
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:53,477
When one priest was missing...

55
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:56,679
they wouldn't baptize, marry
or commune with the other one.

56
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:58,923
You delayed your wedding
for three months...

57
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:02,926
when father Anestis was sick
in Athens!

58
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:05,521
The bride almost burst,
waiting for your priest!

59
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,603
Listen to them!

60
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:09,843
Come with me, I'm a woman!

61
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:13,044
- She's my passenger.
- Now she's mine!

62
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:22,321
- Aren't you coming with us?
- I'm going with the sheep.

63
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:29,000
When the Lord took
father Anestis in his arms...

64
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:32,358
and I was left the only priest
and there was unity...

65
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,565
after three months you were
separated in two parties again.

66
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,917
In two windmills.

67
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:43,084
When you were ill in Athens
for four months...

68
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:45,436
your clients preferred
to starve!

69
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:48,838
And the others showed them
the loafs...

70
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:52,323
and they went insane
from hunger.

71
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:57,322
But the Lord, who is wise,
blew away the one mill.

72
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,479
- And there was peace.
- For six months.

73
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:06,725
On the seven month, we
were divided in two boats.

74
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,237
He is my uncle!

75
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,437
Come with me uncle,
for aunt's sake!

76
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:16,644
- He's my uncle, too.
- How come?

77
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:19,643
What did you tell him?

78
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:23,037
That you have a cat on board!
He has a dog...

79
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:24,924
Liar!

80
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:28,965
Two boats, two parties!

81
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:32,397
For some reason, we need
to be divided in two.

82
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,564
As if we're asking
for dispute in this island!

83
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:38,724
Not only us,
but the whole world.

84
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:43,045
I read the Old Testament 
and I only find quarrels!

85
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:46,358
Even the angels
were divided in two.

86
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:50,117
That's where the demons
came from.

87
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:52,717
You sinner!

88
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:57,523
Does your sainthood allow you
to read the coffee-cup?

89
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:03,205
It does, when you have to do
with demons and ghosts!

90
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,484
- She's past you!
- She has a short chain.

91
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:11,725
Father! Untie the rope!
We're sailing!

92
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:18,520
- Open our sail!
- Hurray, my captain!

93
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,759
- What did you say?
- Hurray, my captain!

94
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:25,921
- Didn't you hear me?
- I wanted to hear it again!

95
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,881
You're not good enough
to be a deck-boy!

96
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,918
Don't go against me...

97
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:34,084
cause I'll make you repent
40 times evening and night...

98
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,163
for 40 days!

99
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:38,403
You'll loose weight and people
will stop saying...

100
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:42,118
that you have your teeth
in community funds!

101
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:50,766
Captain Madalena!
See you later!

102
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:56,965
- We have to get past him!
- Hold the tiller!

103
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:04,204
- The boat will turn over!
- Let it!

104
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:08,445
- You want as to drown?
- We have our pride to think of!

105
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:22,680
Captain Lambis, I'll dock
and help you with the rope.

106
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:20,199
Madalena, my child, I don't
want you to fight with them.

107
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:23,324
- Giorgaros is a harsh man!
- His son is.

108
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:26,484
You mustn't call them names.
You're a woman, a girl!

109
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:29,564
- What does that mean?
- You're a fragile creature.

110
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:33,077
- If you were a son, a male...
- You always say that!

111
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:36,284
Because I think about it.
If something happens to me...

112
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,881
what will become of you,
six girls and Pantelis?

113
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:42,284
I have a thorn in my heart.
The doctor said...

114
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,439
dictators and bad hearts never
know when their time will come.

115
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:48,564
But there is nothing wrong with
you! What do doctors know?

116
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,678
If they knew anything...

117
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,924
Dr. Valintas wouldn't have died
yesterday from a grain in his...

118
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:56,202
Relax, there's
nothing wrong with me.

119
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,404
You have a great heart,
nothing can happen to it.

120
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:02,843
I want to see you smile!
See? I'm smiling!

121
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:07,205
OnIy if you never say again:
"I wish you were a male".

122
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:10,923
If just need Mr.Lambis' pants
to be a male, too.

123
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:14,278
- Nothing else?
- What else?

124
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,837
Crew, get on deck!

125
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:25,805
Time for the mess!
Get in line!

126
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:27,075
- Violeto!
- Present!

127
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:29,243
Pothito!... Marouso!...

128
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:32,199
Hrouso!... Paraskevo!...

129
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:36,042
And last, Pantelis!

130
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,723
Didn't I sew your
button this morning?

131
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,879
This one!
Now I lost the other one!

132
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:47,519
- Did you bring me some candy?
- Grandma! You got a sweet-tooth!

133
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:50,724
Go prepare the donkey,
I'm going to the vineyard.

134
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:54,397
Let's go, Pantelis.
We'll all go together.

135
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:59,157
She's better than a son.

136
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,803
But, she's not a son!

137
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:09,000
- You love him that much?
- Don't be jealous!

138
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:11,197
You know we grew up together.

139
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:14,444
Born on the same day
and at the same time.

140
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,837
But he was born a male.

141
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,844
- How do we call our donkey?
- Giorgaros!

142
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:29,715
To mock captain Windy!
Now, we'll call him "Lambis".

143
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:32,999
Will he listen to us
now that we'll change his name?

144
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,402
We'll call him so the whole
village will listen...

145
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:38,724
and laugh at mister Lambis!
The donkey!

146
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:42,004
Father, come down!
Mr. Lambis is ready!

147
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:47,326
You always take care of me.
You spoil me.

148
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:49,637
Bless you, my son!

149
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:55,724
- I don't want to scare the kids.
- What's wrong, father?

150
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,485
It's nothing.

151
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:59,678
Father, I'm scared.

152
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,758
It'll pass.

153
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:05,635
- Shall I take you upstairs?
- Yes, I want to relax.

154
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:04,444
- Are you well now?
- I'm better.

155
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,717
Come closer.

156
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,597
If anything happens to me...

157
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:12,121
take care of the children.

158
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:17,080
Swear to me, that you'll
take care of the children.

159
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:19,322
That's why
I wanted you to be a son.

160
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:21,677
Now, you'll be a father.

161
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,283
I can't take it...

162
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:28,440
The captain is crying!
Aren't you ashamed?

163
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:32,966
I want you to see you
in the storm!

164
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:42,285
Nothing is wrong with father.
Isn't that right?

165
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:48,120
Don't look at me with sad eyes.
What can I do to make you laugh?

166
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:52,485
Do you want me to make
Paraskevo say a difficult word?

167
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:55,564
Do you want us to sing?
Do you want us to dance?

168
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,560
Let's dance together like
we did the other day.

169
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:23,165
See the son you have!
Laugh! SmiIe!

170
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:25,518
What are you doing?

171
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:28,644
I brought you some spirit
and cotton, son-in-law.

172
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:32,606
We're dancing
to make father laugh!

173
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:35,878
That's not a funny dance!

174
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:40,043
Dance
"How do they grate pepper".

175
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,563
You're right, grandma!
Let's go, guys.

176
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:47,243
<i>How do they grate pepper...</i>

177
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:55,724
<i>the devil's monks?</i>

178
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:59,881
<i>They grate it with their arm!</i>

179
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,843
Well done, children.

180
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:15,285
They also grate it
with their ass!

181
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:21,520
<i>They grate it with their rear!</i>

182
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:43,199
You have my blessing!

183
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:52,915
Cosmas Haridimos
58 years old

184
00:17:56,047 --> 00:18:00,120
After nine days, will give him
a proper memorial.

185
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:07,600
He didn't leave you a fortune,
but he left you a name.

186
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:11,999
A good name
is the best dowry, Madalena.

187
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:18,519
If anything happens to you,
you come to me.

188
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:21,878
God embraces the orphans.

189
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,399
And if He sometimes forgets,
He'll never fail you.

190
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:33,438
Well done, daughter.
You are brave.

191
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:37,606
The whole village
spoke of your courage.

192
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:42,524
What are you going to live on,
until you get married?

193
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:47,879
- We'll live of my boat.
- You'll hire a boatman.

194
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:51,926
Am I not capable?
I'll sail it.

195
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,403
- You're a girl, a female!
- I might be a female...

196
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:59,480
but I'm better boatman
than any captain!

197
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:02,684
- That's how my father called me.
- He was joking!

198
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:05,719
You don't know me well,
but you will see me.

199
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:07,877
- I know the village.
- The village will see me, too.

200
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:11,044
Are you going against
our traditions?

201
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:14,244
I know nothing about traditions.
I only know what I swore.

202
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,397
My father told me...

203
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,439
"Swear that you'll
take care of the children".

204
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,677
"Be a father to them".

205
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:24,879
And you're telling me to break
my oath? And you're a priest!

206
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:27,959
How will I confess to you
so I can commune?

207
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:32,125
We'll both go to hell! And you
will go much deeper in it!

208
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:36,525
Do you think that Giorgaros
will let you?

209
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,804
They'll declare war on you!

210
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,917
"In the storm..."

211
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,999
"I want to see you there".
That's what my father told me.

212
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,237
If they want war,
they'll get it.

213
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:55,241
I heard Madalena will
continue sailing the boat.

214
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,238
Alone?

215
00:19:57,327 --> 00:20:00,319
Don't laugh.
She's not like the others.

216
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,046
- It's her spite!
- It'll harm her.

217
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:06,244
- Are we going to fight a woman?
- I'll show her!

218
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:08,602
Not like that!
Don't be harsh.

219
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:11,684
I say we let her get a passenger
once in a while...

220
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:13,843
now that her father is dead.

221
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:17,084
We have to finish with her.
If she gets married...

222
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,442
her husband
will be our rival forever.

223
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:22,764
We have to fight her,
whether we like it or not!

224
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,122
If they want a war,
they'll get it!

225
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,204
You, eat! And you, Paraskevo!

226
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,403
This is not a game.

227
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:34,486
We are having a family
meeting here.

228
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:37,560
Let's have a meeting,
but not a war.

229
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,764
I want a war!
Paraskevo, get the slingshots.

230
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,162
He's going
to kill a chicken again!

231
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:45,437
I'll kill Lambis' rooster!

232
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,404
You keep your mouth shut!

233
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:49,563
I'm in a meeting!

234
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:52,759
Tomorrow morning, the whole
crew is going to the boat!

235
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:56,038
You'll walk behind me
and then, we'll see.

236
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:29,924
Who's coming with our boat?

237
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,039
The good boatman is here!

238
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,476
Here's the Island Dolphin!

239
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:43,765
Whoever comes with me,
goes fast and safe!

240
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:56,844
Blow your whelk! You can blow
as much as you want now!

241
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:59,999
- Blow it!
- It broke!

242
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,084
Who's coming with the boat?
We're leaving!

243
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:07,322
Who's coming with our boat?

244
00:22:07,447 --> 00:22:10,519
Have some eggs, but I can't
come with your boat.

245
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:13,844
Take your eggs back,
we thank you.

246
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:17,004
My siblings are not beggars!

247
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:19,797
Who's coming with our boat?

248
00:22:19,927 --> 00:22:23,044
That's it.
Release the cable!

249
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:30,197
Who's coming with our boat?

250
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:41,079
Not even one.
I told you so.

251
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:44,438
Man can become a monster
for his ego.

252
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:47,719
Not even a couple
from compassion?

253
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,799
I would have thrown them out!
I need no charity!

254
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:53,919
I know you well, they don't.
They don't trust you!

255
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:57,044
They're scared that they'll
drown with a girl like you.

256
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,446
A girl like me?

257
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:01,400
They'll see me now!
Kids, get in!

258
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:05,560
- We're taking the priest?
- We're going to the demons!

259
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:26,240
We'll get them! Hold up, my boat!
Hold up, Madalena.

260
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:29,559
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

261
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:31,677
The kingdom come.

262
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,964
- What are you saying?
- I'm praying so will catch them.

263
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:39,437
Hold tight
and we'll catch them!

264
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,723
I wish I had a flag!

265
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:05,919
Pantelis,
take your pants off.

266
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:20,766
Captain Lambis,
this is the fIag that suits you!

267
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:28,402
Silence! Shut up!

268
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:33,280
Peace be with you!
I'm taIking!

269
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:37,679
What happened this morning
was inhumane!

270
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:41,004
Are we going to leave
seven orphans to starve?

271
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:46,519
What do you think, Lambis?

272
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:49,002
The priest is right!

273
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,159
This morning
you called her names!

274
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:55,085
That's business. Human
kindness is something different!

275
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,397
So is nobility!

276
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,597
Well done, son.

277
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:04,443
I was happy to see our boat full,
but when I saw hers empty...

278
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:09,086
and the children
dressed in black...

279
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:13,519
Six children, Harisis.
Didn't your heart bleed?

280
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:18,165
Don't take any passengers 
and let them in the other boat.

281
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:22,284
Business is business.

282
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:26,964
But you should say so, 
when you see something wrong.

283
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:30,318
I have to say it.
If I don't, I'll choke.

284
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:33,524
I can't even think
of such things!

285
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:37,606
Because your head is filled
with debts and interests.

286
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:41,760
While the sea blows in our
heads and clears them.

287
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:49,444
How can you trust your life
in boatman wearing a dress?

288
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:52,798
I'm in a dress and you
trust me with your soul!

289
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:57,366
She doesn't have a sweet tongue!
She was booing people!

290
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:00,678
- She is wild.
- She's been wronged!

291
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,042
Whoever is wronged, turns wild.

292
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:06,164
That's why the notables
must make things right...

293
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,357
so she'll be calm again.

294
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:12,122
That is what we'll do today.
Do we have an agreement?

295
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:14,443
- The bell!
- Who is ringing it?

296
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:17,564
It's ringing from the strange
things it heard!

297
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,803
Can it be a fire?

298
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:35,957
Maybe something
happened to Lambis!

299
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:38,322
- I'll faint!
- Leave it for later!

300
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:42,444
You know everything, that's
why they call you "newspaper".

301
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,802
You're the sergeant's wife!

302
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,958
Move aside!

303
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,277
- Who killed? Where's the body?
- What happened?

304
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,404
We'll find out! I'm going
to the scene of the crime.

305
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:03,603
Move aside!
The authority is here!

306
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:05,683
The authorities!

307
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:09,158
- Where is the body?
- There is no body.

308
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:13,325
- The murderer?
- This is the offender!

309
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:16,484
- The donkey?
- He rang the bell!

310
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:21,322
The rope is cut and they
have put a vine here.

311
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:25,998
The donkey smelled the vine,
chewed on it...

312
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:28,555
and the bell rang.

313
00:27:30,327 --> 00:27:33,444
They were saying
that I was ringing it.

314
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,921
- Whose is the donkey?
- Madalena's.

315
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:41,276
She always creates trouble.

316
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:43,877
There she is.

317
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:47,244
- What did you do?
- He embarrassed us.

318
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,363
- Is it his fauIt?
- Is it mine?

319
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:51,597
It's the one's who tied
the vine on the rope.

320
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:54,799
You did that, mayor.
And you are a churchwarden!

321
00:27:54,927 --> 00:27:57,964
Didn't I tell you to buy
some rope for the bell?

322
00:27:58,087 --> 00:28:01,124
We had to call a meeting
to decide on the sum.

323
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:04,204
You did it because
of your nearness!

324
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:07,205
It's your fault! 
You let your donkey run free!

325
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:09,323
It's your fault, you Scrooge!

326
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:12,484
- You're calling me Scrooge?
- The whole village does.

327
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,604
They call you a miser
and a thief!

328
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:20,043
You are presumptuous!
Hear her, fellow-citizens?

329
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:23,358
And you wanted me to travel
with her boat out of charity!

330
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:26,439
I don't want to hear
that word again!

331
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,757
I don't need your charity!

332
00:28:29,047 --> 00:28:31,436
Leave me alone!

333
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:37,002
You torturers!

334
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:46,643
Let me bless you!

335
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,843
Not the holy water, again!

336
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:51,959
So we won't get a bad eye
now that our boat is doing well!

337
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,277
Madalena's grandmother
does the same.

338
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,517
I don't know why God listens
to our prayers...

339
00:28:56,607 --> 00:28:59,280
and not to seven orphans.

340
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:02,404
You feel bad for them, too.
The poor things.

341
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:05,280
- What about Madalena...
- I don't feel sorry for her.

342
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:08,399
I admire her.
She fights like a man.

343
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:10,597
And that pride of hers!

344
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:13,764
Sometimes, she makes me proud!

345
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,875
Take the wheat to the mill.
They're grinding today.

346
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:22,166
You'll load me
like a donkey again!

347
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:36,239
Come on, Lambis!

348
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:45,279
You're walking like
you're wearing heels today.

349
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:49,446
Maybe you're sad, too.
We're grinding our last wheat.

350
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:53,679
The Lord might forget,
but He never fails you.

351
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:58,244
Quit with the melancholy!
Why the long face?

352
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:02,320
You look like Mr. Lambis
when he saw our boat full.

353
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,237
Check out that load!

354
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:12,564
Let's go see him up close.

355
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:29,723
- Did I talk to you?
- Did I?

356
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,957
- You laughed.
- I laughed at my donkey.

357
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,602
He complaints about the load.
Doesn't he see you?

358
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:38,281
- What can I tell you?
- Nothing.

359
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:40,637
Your tongue is sticking out!

360
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:47,361
- Throw it over.
- Leave me alone.

361
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:50,479
Throw it over!
You're a sorry sight.

362
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,604
- You hate me that much?
- It's not because of that.

363
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:56,764
- Why then?
- You call me names all the time.

364
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:58,963
You're calling
your donkey Lambis.

365
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:02,278
My donkey is not just any
donkey like... I better not say...

366
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,478
He's a donkey with pride,
not like... I better not say...

367
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,877
- And you are a...
- Come on!

368
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:15,046
You're lucky I'm dying
to have a cigarette!

369
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:24,323
Isn't it nice?

370
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:27,484
- I told you so.
- You have a kind heart.

371
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:29,558
In spite of what they say...

372
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:32,724
- "Nice but tough".
- As for tough...

373
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,725
You scare me!

374
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:49,005
There's a strange sight!

375
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,837
I'll help you.

376
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:11,960
- Leave it, that's mine.
- I'll carry it upstairs.

377
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:35,364
He's not like we say he is...

378
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:39,565
I think it's time I stopped
calling you Lambis.

379
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:47,596
- Who's first?
- Lambis came first.

380
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:50,918
- You would have gone past me.
- Because of the donkey.

381
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,202
- You grind yours first.
- You go.

382
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:57,366
We can go back together and
you'll get to smoke on the way.

383
00:32:57,687 --> 00:33:01,760
I'll grind for both of you.
You mustn't fight.

384
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,964
Such a beautiful girl
and such a handsome man...

385
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:08,443
should do other things together
and not fight.

386
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:11,644
- What are you talking about?
- What is this?

387
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:13,723
Stop with the fighting...

388
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:16,884
join your boats
and make a partnership.

389
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:20,039
That can't happen,
we won't compromise.

390
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:22,402
Think I would compromise?

391
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:24,722
Compromise with what?
You've got no one left.

392
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:27,725
You took everyone
with lies and dirty tricks.

393
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:30,924
- Calling names again?
- I'll do as I pIease!

394
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:33,277
Get out of here!

395
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:46,800
You're not called "Lambis"
anymore, but "Mayor".

396
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,523
You'll be just like him.

397
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:54,846
You can yammer and kick,
so you'll be just like the Mayor.

398
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:59,883
Mayor!

399
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,840
They gave me nickname!

400
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:14,157
I won't dare
to look at a donkey again!

401
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:17,724
That's what she did to me.
Get it?

402
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,843
She calls me a donkey!

403
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,963
I don't get one think.

404
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:25,164
How can she call you donkey,
when you are not one.

405
00:34:25,207 --> 00:34:28,597
- She's calling you a donkey?
- She's calling the donkey "mayor".

406
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,042
Then the donkey
should file a complaint!

407
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:33,163
You confused me!

408
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:36,279
Who's the donkey
and who's the mayor?

409
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:40,520
Go arrest Madalena
and use handcuffs.

410
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:43,764
- We have no handcuffs.
- Use a rope.

411
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:51,725
Since we have no handcuffs,
keep your hands together.

412
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:54,924
- On your back!
- I get it.

413
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:58,559
- What will they do to you?
- They won't hang me.

414
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:01,719
They might fry my a bit.
But, I'll fry them, too!

415
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:18,120
- You've strapped her too tight!
- Release yourself.

416
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:22,763
Come here.

417
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:32,760
Your name and your residence.
Why won't you answer?

418
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:35,998
Are you kidding me?
You know all that!

419
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:38,276
I have to write a report.

420
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:41,603
Are you going to disgrace me
in the papers?

421
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:45,276
It's not for the press,
it's for my records.

422
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:51,920
I don't have to explain myself
to you! I'm a sergeant.

423
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:59,115
What are you now?
A war hero?

424
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:07,280
You'll have to defend yourself!
Why name your donkey "mayor"?

425
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:11,526
- That's criminal vituperation!
- The mayor is the criminal.

426
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:14,644
He's letting my siblings
starve to death.

427
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:17,759
If you were just, you should
have brought him here.

428
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:20,998
But you're no better
than him!

429
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:25,086
- Better than who?
- I won't fight about that!

430
00:36:25,127 --> 00:36:27,766
- Put her behind bars.
- We have no bars.

431
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,600
- Take her to jail.
- We have no jail.

432
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,918
Let's built one now
that we have the chance.

433
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:49,806
That's how I want you to march!
How's the prisoner?

434
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,079
She's hungry!
I'm starving!

435
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,278
- Of course, it's two o' clock.
- We haven't eaten either.

436
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,801
- Let's go, Hercules.
- Duty first!

437
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:02,158
You'll starve all day
for correction!

438
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:07,124
- Hercules, the girl is eating!
- Thank you, Mrs. Sergeant

439
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:10,239
Mrs. Deputy Governor!
She won't eat!

440
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,439
- But I'm hungry!
- I spoke!

441
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:16,564
You say what your wife
tells you!

442
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:55,637
He's sleeping.

443
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:05,404
- How did you get here?
- We've been hiding.

444
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:07,597
The guard is sleeping.

445
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,924
- When will they hang you?
- Why hang me?

446
00:38:12,047 --> 00:38:14,242
They put you in jail!

447
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:19,285
- Did you feed the donkey?
- I took a sack of straw to him.

448
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:34,279
Shame on you,
torturing a girl like that!

449
00:38:34,407 --> 00:38:36,443
You are right!

450
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,637
I told the sergeant, but...

451
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:42,596
- But why do you care?
- I don't!

452
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:46,880
She calls me
names all the time!

453
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:50,119
I'm just saying, that
you can't treat a girl like that.

454
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,476
You are forbidden
to care for the girl.

455
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:54,962
What you're doing is harsh.

456
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:58,278
Tell your sergeant
that Lambis said so!

457
00:38:58,407 --> 00:39:01,604
You're forbidden to speak
like that about my sergeant.

458
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:04,082
- You spoke like that.
- I'm an authority.

459
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:07,199
Authorities have the right
to insult each other.

460
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:10,319
It's a common thing. But I
forbid you to care for the girl.

461
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:12,443
- He's right!
- What did you say?

462
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:15,599
Why are you
interfering in our business?

463
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,757
- They locked you up!
- It's their right!

464
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:20,924
Is it their right to lock up
a girl in a basement?

465
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:23,157
They don't have a proper prison?

466
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:26,199
- A girl? A fragile creature?
- You are fragile!

467
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:28,682
I came here
to get you out and you...

468
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,839
Who told you that I want out?
I like it in here!

469
00:39:31,927 --> 00:39:34,157
She's right.
Why would you care?

470
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:37,404
What do you care
what we do between us?

471
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:39,717
- Split!
- Hit the road!

472
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:42,964
You're a lunatic!
I'm leaving!

473
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:45,317
Have a safe trip!

474
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:47,041
Well done!

475
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:50,204
- You told him right!
- Thank you!

476
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:53,837
He came here to act
like a savior! A man!

477
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:57,124
Now he got a taste of Madalena.
Men are ridiculous!

478
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:08,479
Your cooking is remarkable!

479
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:12,560
That's why I'm going
to pardon the prisoner...

480
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:16,163
so she'll eat and I won't
have to worry about her...

481
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:18,557
and spoil my feast!

482
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:12,000
That's all I needed! Roses!
Two months now, the same thing!

483
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:14,203
- Good morning, my child.
- Good morning, father.

484
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:16,403
You came to the dock again?

485
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:19,245
It doesn't matter,
what you tell them!

486
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:23,042
- They fear the mayor.
- And won't fear the Lord.

487
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:25,561
I hear you are selling
your vineyard.

488
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:27,882
I owe the grocer 
and his pressuring me.

489
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:30,003
The mayor put him up to it.

490
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,157
- Patience, child. The Lord...
- The Lord...

491
00:41:32,287 --> 00:41:34,562
Any objection is forbidden.

492
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:37,719
The Lord my forget,
but He'll never fail you!

493
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:40,879
- Will you take me across?
- You must be in a hurry.

494
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:43,999
I decided to go with your boat.

495
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,403
I'll tell my siblings and my cousins!
To as many as I can!

496
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:49,876
He won't fail you!

497
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:54,245
Get in, Mr. Yakoumis.
Get in with your right foot!

498
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:58,966
Maybe we'll get our luck back!
Bless the Lord!

499
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:12,720
Forgive me Lord, but I'll get
Yakoumis for what he did.

500
00:44:07,927 --> 00:44:11,363
- You have a sweet voice.
- I'm happy.

501
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:14,638
Thank you
for not fearing the mayor.

502
00:44:14,727 --> 00:44:18,037
I wonder myself,
but love can defy anything!

503
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:21,284
- Love?
- I have you in my heart.

504
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:23,477
That's why you came
with my boat.

505
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:26,963
I fear the sea. I wouldn't get
in a boat sailed by a woman.

506
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:31,285
"When the captain is a woman,
the passenger is a fool!"

507
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:33,917
- What are you doing?
- Taking you back.

508
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:37,044
I want people to come with my
boat because I'm a captain...

509
00:44:37,127 --> 00:44:39,163
not because I'm a girl!

510
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:42,324
- I want to marry you.
- I want passengers, not grooms!

511
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:46,600
If I marry you, you'll trap me
in the fields and the animals...

512
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:50,800
and I'll have to leave the sea!
The world will come to an end!

513
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:54,238
- You're in love with the sea.
- In love? What is that?

514
00:44:54,327 --> 00:44:56,397
The sea is something else!

515
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,995
I love its space, its wind,
its saltiness!

516
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:02,164
- And its storms!
- They're sweet, too.

517
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:06,326
It's the sea, not milk
to turn it into yogurt!

518
00:45:08,087 --> 00:45:12,080
You are persistent!
I wasn't lucky today.

519
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:14,757
All our prayers went to vain!

520
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:21,597
That's it. 3.215, 60.

521
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,646
- My father told me 2.500.
- You don't remember correctly.

522
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:32,766
Those were his last words.
You don't forget such things.

523
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:36,038
Maybe the diseased
didn't remember correctly.

524
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,119
I thought that from the 3.000
I got from my vineyard...

525
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:41,317
I would have something left.

526
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:44,638
Take it all
and I'll owe you the rest.

527
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:47,844
Are you doubting me?
I have everything written here.

528
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:52,045
- You know well how do add.
- And you how to multiply...

529
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,917
I sold you.

530
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:16,079
I sold you to pay our debts.

531
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:20,245
What are you looking at me for?
We've been together for 17 years.

532
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:23,439
Wouldn't you have sold me?

533
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:25,683
What? The boat?

534
00:46:25,847 --> 00:46:29,806
The boat is sacred,
don't be disrespectful.

535
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:32,322
Don't look at me, because...

536
00:46:32,407 --> 00:46:35,046
I have to turn you over.

537
00:46:35,847 --> 00:46:39,965
You seem in a hurry. I always
knew you were ungrateful.

538
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,244
I shouldn't have fed you
all that straw!

539
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:47,884
Come...
I want to get rid of you!

540
00:46:48,527 --> 00:46:52,679
Don't stare at me! 
You won't make me feel sorry!

541
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:56,720
The last thing I need
is to burst in tears.

542
00:47:03,967 --> 00:47:06,242
My poor donkey!

543
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:08,437
The mayor got you!

544
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:11,758
My poor Mayor,
the donkey got you!

545
00:47:26,047 --> 00:47:28,197
Are you hungry?

546
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:31,564
- You are. Want cheese?
- No, I don't.

547
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:37,085
In Madalena's home they are
suffering. They have no food.

548
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:39,243
You mind your own business!

549
00:47:39,327 --> 00:47:43,479
They went to the grocery, but
Harisis didn't give them anything.

550
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:46,919
- Hear me, Lambis?
- Why are you telling me?

551
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:49,959
Tell it to her.
She's arrogant and hot-tempered!

552
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:53,278
- You used to call her proud.
- She's quarrels like a man!

553
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:55,881
She can't be a woman!

554
00:47:56,127 --> 00:47:59,164
Get off my case with her!

555
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,597
You are teaming.

556
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:27,838
So I won't forget that once,
I was a teamster.

557
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:30,037
You're a priest.

558
00:48:30,127 --> 00:48:33,244
But I can also be a teamster
if needed.

559
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,478
Here, I sow
and I get a crop.

560
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:40,685
At church, I sow my words
and very few listen.

561
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:44,238
That's why once in a while,
I fetch my animals.

562
00:48:44,327 --> 00:48:47,603
Why didn't you come
to confession?

563
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:50,878
I'm not worthy to commune.
I've sinned.

564
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:54,084
- Did you fall in love?
- That's the last thing I need!

565
00:48:54,207 --> 00:48:57,324
- Then, why did you sin?
- Because of hatred.

566
00:48:58,567 --> 00:49:01,559
Let's go to church.

567
00:49:23,847 --> 00:49:27,760
I hate everyone.
Can you believe that?

568
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,879
Even you.
And I had you like a father.

569
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,958
I want everyone's harm.

570
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:36,159
When I here that something
happened to someone...

571
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:39,165
a bad turn, a sickness, a death...
I feel happy.

572
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:42,719
When I see people laughing,
I'm heart-broken.

573
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:45,077
I think of dark thoughts.

574
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:48,278
I want to break, to destroy,
to do harm.

575
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:52,406
Not just to some people,
but to the whole village.

576
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:55,684
I stopped praying at night.
You want to know why?

577
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:59,806
In my prayers,
I prayed for harm.

578
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:04,919
I pleaded God
to burn this island!

579
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:11,885
- Did you say everything?
- As much as I could.

580
00:50:12,127 --> 00:50:16,200
I need to hear no more.
I can't stand any more.

581
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:19,524
You have my blessing.
You can commune.

582
00:50:19,607 --> 00:50:23,964
- I'll be shaking.
- No, I will.

583
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:28,198
O Lord Jesus Christ my God
I commit my spirit.

584
00:50:28,287 --> 00:50:31,597
Do Thou bless me, do
Thou have mercy on me...

585
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:39,917
The priest will silence now 
and the teamster will take action.

586
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:47,720
The good teamster...

587
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:52,277
My Lord, show mercy...

588
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:56,725
but sometimes you forget
about your White Island.

589
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,839
You forgot about Your child,
the orphan.

590
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:06,997
Maybe you left this to me.

591
00:51:08,647 --> 00:51:13,277
You don't have time
for everything. Right?

592
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:18,604
It must be that way.
I understand.

593
00:51:18,647 --> 00:51:21,798
So I'll act according
to Your will.

594
00:51:21,887 --> 00:51:25,038
Madalena, your torments
will be soon over.

595
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:27,243
I have a plan.

596
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:31,440
It was hard to decide it,
but the Lord helped me.

597
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:34,718
- He spoke to me.
- What did he tell you?

598
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:36,200
He told me...

599
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:39,359
I don't have to explain to you
what the Lord told me!

600
00:51:39,447 --> 00:51:40,880
Those are secrets of the business.

601
00:51:41,087 --> 00:51:44,318
The day after tomorrow,
on Epiphany Day...

602
00:51:44,407 --> 00:51:47,638
when we'll throw the cross
in the sea, you...

603
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:15,959
I want you to catch the cross
this year, too.

604
00:52:16,047 --> 00:52:19,164
- That's what you say every year!
- For the good of our business.

605
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:22,358
- Wear this charm.
- Another? I told you, I'll catch it.

606
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:24,637
Five years now, our Lambis wins.

607
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:28,475
Beware of Sotiris and Grigoris.
They practiced new dives.

608
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:32,037
Leave me alone!
I'm going to find a good spot.

609
00:52:40,687 --> 00:52:43,201
Do as I told you.

610
00:52:47,887 --> 00:52:50,003
Be ready.

611
00:52:55,207 --> 00:52:57,596
I'm scared.

612
00:53:14,647 --> 00:53:17,764
Don't be scared,
I'm here for you.

613
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:23,197
Be ready.

614
00:53:40,007 --> 00:53:43,044
My Lord, please forgive me,
the sinner.

615
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:46,284
- I'm shaking!
- I make the rules here!

616
00:53:56,127 --> 00:53:58,925
The cross fell up front!

617
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:22,323
I caught it!

618
00:54:22,407 --> 00:54:24,967
You caught the cross?

619
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:29,605
This hasn't happened since 100
years ago when my grandmother...

620
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:33,800
Maybe it's a sign from heaven.
What do you say, Christians?

621
00:54:33,927 --> 00:54:36,919
Is this Your will?

622
00:54:41,727 --> 00:54:44,446
Have we wronged the orphan?

623
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:54,079
Since we've wronged her, we
must make good as Christians.

624
00:54:55,887 --> 00:54:59,004
Don't say too much.
We'll get caught.

625
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:03,239
- Since we wronged the girl...
- The captain!

626
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,756
we must make good now.

627
00:55:07,687 --> 00:55:11,043
From tomorrow, whoever doesn't
travel with the girl's boat...

628
00:55:11,127 --> 00:55:13,880
- With captain Madalena's boat...
- Just "captain"!

629
00:55:15,807 --> 00:55:19,038
I'm no God or doctor
to change your sex!

630
00:55:19,727 --> 00:55:22,878
From tomorrow, all of you
travel with her boat...

631
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:26,158
- Not all, half of them.
- I'll throw it back in!

632
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:30,446
Whoever doesn't go with her boat,
I'll put him in my books.

633
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:34,606
And what is written,
can't be erased!

634
00:55:37,327 --> 00:55:40,637
Forgive them, my Lord,
and me, too...

635
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:44,879
and bless Your White Island
which has repented.

636
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:52,797
Blow, you deadbeat!

637
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:56,004
You weren't even worthy
of catching the cross!

638
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:58,726
Look! We're doomed!

639
00:56:02,127 --> 00:56:06,245
I don't want anymore
with my boat, they are enough!

640
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:14,238
- Uncle! You come.
- I'll go with the blessed.

641
00:56:15,127 --> 00:56:18,278
- Aren't you coming with us?
- I'm going with the blessed.

642
00:56:18,447 --> 00:56:22,520
- Won't you come with the sheep?
- I'm going with God.

643
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:25,804
Release the cables!
We broke the spell!

644
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:28,964
We're sailing!

645
00:56:44,647 --> 00:56:47,445
- I see you're singing!
- See our food!

646
00:56:47,527 --> 00:56:49,757
Potatoes, beans
I hadn't seen for months...

647
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:52,361
spaghetti my grandmother makes...

648
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:54,557
- Oil, rice, soap...
- Halva!

649
00:56:54,647 --> 00:56:57,719
That's why we sing.
Food and songs go together.

650
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,997
And captain Giorgaros
is broke and he's cursing!

651
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:02,237
Those two go together, too.

652
00:57:02,287 --> 00:57:05,359
Since the Lord blessed you, 
no one stepped in his boat again!

653
00:57:05,487 --> 00:57:08,638
- He's eating himself up!
- I didn't eat anything!

654
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:11,122
Crew, let's go!

655
00:57:19,927 --> 00:57:23,920
My Lord, I know you're mad
at your servant.

656
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:29,400
You heard the poor
children in the morning.

657
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:34,682
Their laughter brought
my eyes tears of joy!

658
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:40,920
I know, I have sinned.

659
00:57:41,007 --> 00:57:45,159
When You take me in your
arms, I'll pay the price.

660
00:57:46,487 --> 00:57:49,638
But they are seven orphans.

661
00:57:50,047 --> 00:57:54,086
You made them orphans,
let's not forget about that.

662
00:57:54,207 --> 00:57:56,437
There were
extenuating circumstances.

663
00:57:56,567 --> 00:58:00,685
You can forgive
your unworthy priest.

664
00:58:02,007 --> 00:58:06,080
- We must get her out of the way!
- She made me look like a fooI!

665
00:58:06,127 --> 00:58:10,086
They're calling me captain Whelk!
I'm always with a whelk in hand.

666
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:13,204
- Your throat must be sore.
- Silence, women!

667
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:16,444
It's the only way
we'll get rid of her.

668
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,882
Our plan must remain secret.

669
00:58:18,967 --> 00:58:22,004
- It's a sin. She's an orphan.
- Shut up!

670
00:58:22,047 --> 00:58:25,039
- Don't defend her!
- We're striving for you.

671
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:28,278
- For your dowry.
- I don't want that dowry.

672
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:31,404
We'll destroy seven orphans
for my dowry!

673
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:34,524
- Have you lost your mind?
- You lost your compassion.

674
00:58:34,607 --> 00:58:36,882
You were proud to be a fine man.

675
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:41,245
I was proud of you
and now I feel shame.

676
00:58:43,727 --> 00:58:47,766
Thank you, brother.
I'll never forget this.

677
00:58:47,847 --> 00:58:51,157
You praised Madalena
and spoke of her pride!

678
00:58:52,527 --> 00:58:55,599
He spoke such words.

679
00:58:56,007 --> 00:59:00,125
He made me love
and feel for Madalena.

680
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:14,000
Who the hell leaves these?
Is he some ghost?

681
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:17,558
Think somel ghost
fell in Iove with me?

682
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:21,678
- Are you talking to yourself?
- I wanted to see you.

683
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,759
I heard you fought with your
parents and took my side.

684
00:59:24,887 --> 00:59:27,117
- I like you.
- It's not a small thing.

685
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:30,318
When everyone is after you,
it's good to know...

686
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:34,119
I heard they slapped you.
Did it hurt?

687
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:37,239
- I've never been slapped.
- It was my first time, too.

688
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:40,478
And all that for me.
Rozina, I'll give you this rose.

689
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:42,797
- It's not worth anything for me.
- Who gave it to you?

690
00:59:42,887 --> 00:59:45,959
A ghost! I find one
on my boat every morning.

691
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,084
- Some fool must put them there.
- Fool or in love?

692
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,759
Same thing.

693
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:53,003
This is a rose
with one hundred leafs.

694
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:55,846
We are the only ones in
the island with roses like this.

695
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,925
Come with me to our garden.

696
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:02,479
It's the only rose-bush
of this kind in the island.

697
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:04,643
Whoever cuts it,
cuts it from here.

698
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:06,957
- But who?
- Who else?

699
01:00:07,047 --> 01:00:10,005
Who can get in our garden?
Think about it.

700
01:00:10,087 --> 01:00:12,123
I don't know. Who?

701
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:13,885
Lambis.

702
01:00:14,047 --> 01:00:16,242
Your brother?
He swears at me all day long.

703
01:00:16,327 --> 01:00:19,444
He swears at you in public,
because he secretly loves you.

704
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:21,762
How can that be?

705
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:23,957
Men are very shy.

706
01:00:24,047 --> 01:00:27,084
When they're in love
they're too shy to admit it.

707
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:29,476
He brings you the roses!
He secretly loves you!

708
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,637
That's why he tries to kill me?

709
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:34,878
If he loved me in public,
he'd chop my head off.

710
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:38,445
Who's coming with my boat?

711
01:00:38,607 --> 01:00:40,837
Here's the Island Dolphin!

712
01:00:43,847 --> 01:00:46,236
Whoever goes with me goes...

713
01:00:47,327 --> 01:00:50,399
- No shouting today?
- No.

714
01:00:51,287 --> 01:00:54,563
- How come?
- No reason.

715
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:58,806
This is a safe boat!
The captain is male!

716
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:02,044
When the captain is female,
the passenger is a fool!

717
01:01:02,127 --> 01:01:04,243
No swearing either.

718
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,324
- How come?
- No reason.

719
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:11,679
- You're getting shy, finally.
- You're the shy one.

720
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,605
Men are very shy.

721
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:19,604
I'm not too shy to swear at you
after the names you've called me!

722
01:01:19,727 --> 01:01:22,321
Arrogant! Skinny! Basket-case!

723
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:25,120
- Go on.
- You like it?

724
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:27,283
I like it!

725
01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:47,324
The girls are getting
the magic water...

726
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:51,480
to see if they are going
to marry quickly.

727
01:01:52,727 --> 01:01:54,763
Weddings, children,
christenings...

728
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:59,000
Children grow, get married,
bear other chiIdren...

729
01:01:59,127 --> 01:02:03,962
Grow and conquer
the White Island with my blessings!

730
01:02:05,407 --> 01:02:09,400
Does the church accept
these traditions?

731
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:13,039
No, that's alchemy.

732
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:18,836
All the free men gather branches.

733
01:02:19,807 --> 01:02:24,005
The crier is calling them to
prepare for Saint John's fires.

734
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:26,966
There will be a big feast tonight.

735
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:31,366
Is it true that those who jump
more times over the flames...

736
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:34,484
are going to marry sooner?

737
01:02:34,647 --> 01:02:38,686
Don't cause me to sin!
That's alchemy.

738
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:02,919
- Once more, Lambis!
- Once more, Rozina!

739
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:10,803
Come jump, too.

740
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:16,358
- She's not for such things.
- She wears a dress.

741
01:03:16,447 --> 01:03:18,483
So what?
She says so herself...

742
01:03:18,607 --> 01:03:21,599
She's a boatman, not a woman.

743
01:03:52,887 --> 01:03:56,960
The good boatman is here!
The male boatman is here!

744
01:03:58,007 --> 01:04:01,079
When the captain is female...

745
01:04:01,167 --> 01:04:03,283
the passenger is a fool!

746
01:04:03,447 --> 01:04:06,166
A captain with a dress...

747
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:08,637
You're laughing?

748
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:13,919
I'm laughing.
I'm in a good mood.

749
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:17,318
- What is that?
- You're asking me?

750
01:04:18,607 --> 01:04:20,723
This is strange.

751
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:25,001
She's going crazy!

752
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:32,486
I'll drown her!

753
01:04:32,807 --> 01:04:35,162
The good boatmen are here!

754
01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:39,246
Whoever goes with me goes fast!
Whoever goes with him goes safe!

755
01:04:39,447 --> 01:04:42,166
The good boats are here!

756
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:16,917
I got you!

757
01:05:17,007 --> 01:05:20,841
So you're bringing me
the roses!

758
01:05:22,047 --> 01:05:24,163
All of them?

759
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:28,283
What can I tell you?
Are you an officer or a ghost?

760
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:32,525
And you're a thief, too. You
must have stolen over 50 roses.

761
01:05:33,007 --> 01:05:35,043
Sixty-seven.

762
01:05:37,407 --> 01:05:40,444
Will you take me to the other side?

763
01:05:40,647 --> 01:05:44,435
On one condition: No more roses!

764
01:05:48,127 --> 01:05:50,243
I was mocked!

765
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:52,523
Why are you mad?

766
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:55,838
Because I thought
you were someone else.

767
01:05:58,967 --> 01:06:02,004
So you didn't place the roses?

768
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:04,682
That's what we thought.

769
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:07,958
She showed me the roses and
I thought she was mocking me.

770
01:06:08,087 --> 01:06:11,124
She was mocking herself.
And now, she's in love with you.

771
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:14,204
- Are you serious?
- With all I told her...

772
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:17,364
Words! Us women, like words!

773
01:06:17,487 --> 01:06:19,523
What happens now?

774
01:06:19,567 --> 01:06:22,798
Explain to her so she'll
stop imagining things.

775
01:06:23,127 --> 01:06:25,687
Why should she stop?

776
01:06:26,807 --> 01:06:29,367
Cut me a rose!

777
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,763
You liar! You fraud!
You cheater!

778
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:39,125
You dare speak to me?
Liar! Cheater!

779
01:06:39,847 --> 01:06:42,919
Stop shouting! 
The whole village will hear us!

780
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:45,959
I don't need your words,
your doings will do!

781
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:49,397
- It's Rozina's fault!
- You're the same blood!

782
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:53,606
- You'll be sorry for what you said!
- I'm not scared of you anymore!

783
01:07:02,847 --> 01:07:05,964
Madalena's boat is over.
The poor orphan will starve.

784
01:07:06,047 --> 01:07:09,756
Giorgaros bought a petrol boat.

785
01:07:11,647 --> 01:07:14,878
It's not a small thing.
A boat with an engine!

786
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:17,157
The new technology is coming!

787
01:07:51,807 --> 01:07:55,846
- We'll crush that damn female...
- Now she'll stop bragging!

788
01:07:56,007 --> 01:07:59,477
This is the end of poor Madalena.

789
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:04,683
My boat... My Madalena...

790
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,122
What do we do now?

791
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:14,757
Give the coin back!

792
01:08:14,927 --> 01:08:17,919
Aren't you ashamed to cry now
that they are laughing?

793
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:19,725
Be a man!

794
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:22,998
I won't cry... I'm a man...
But what about the coin?

795
01:08:23,087 --> 01:08:26,397
The coin will show them
that we have no hatred.

796
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:30,804
The Lord is Great for those
who have a great heart.

797
01:08:30,927 --> 01:08:32,997
That's what father Fotis says.

798
01:08:33,127 --> 01:08:35,277
Of course the Lord is Great...

799
01:08:46,407 --> 01:08:49,126
In His greatness
He made a mistake.

800
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,283
He gave us more brain
than we need...

801
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:54,598
and we build all these machines
that will give us a better life...

802
01:08:54,687 --> 01:08:57,326
while they only bring disaster.

803
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:59,876
No one comes
with your boat anymore.

804
01:09:00,007 --> 01:09:04,080
They go with the engine boat. They
even forgot about the blessed.

805
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,322
They rather go the fast way.

806
01:09:06,447 --> 01:09:08,722
Fast!
That will eat us up!

807
01:09:08,887 --> 01:09:11,162
Didn't I once buy a fast mule...

808
01:09:11,287 --> 01:09:15,360
which threw me off its back
and I broke three ribs.

809
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:18,405
I brought a candle
to light in honor of the saint.

810
01:09:18,527 --> 01:09:22,440
The saint needs no candles.
Candles are for people.

811
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:25,719
Saint Nicolas
takes care of the seamen...

812
01:09:25,807 --> 01:09:28,162
What can the saint do?
This is an engine...

813
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:30,846
It's technology... 
The devil's craft...

814
01:09:32,647 --> 01:09:34,956
The engine won this battle.

815
01:09:35,407 --> 01:09:37,637
Can't the Lord
fight the engine?

816
01:09:37,687 --> 01:09:39,996
Of course He can,
but He doesn't want to.

817
01:09:40,127 --> 01:09:42,163
Don't ask me why.

818
01:09:42,207 --> 01:09:45,324
No one knows His will.

819
01:09:47,047 --> 01:09:51,120
No, thank you, Mr.Yakoumis.
Madalena doesn't want charity.

820
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:55,605
It's not charity, it's a gift.
Two heads of cheese.

821
01:09:55,647 --> 01:09:58,764
What if we take one head
so Madalena won't be that angry.

822
01:10:00,687 --> 01:10:02,723
- There she is.
- What brings you here?

823
01:10:02,847 --> 01:10:05,919
I was passing by
and stopped to say hello.

824
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:10,085
Did you bring food?
You're not holding anything.

825
01:10:10,447 --> 01:10:13,519
I brought it
while you were playing.

826
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:17,720
We're having rice-soup.
Don't you believe me?

827
01:10:17,807 --> 01:10:20,605
I'll got put the pot on fire.

828
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:33,479
- Where is this going?
- If she hears you, she'll be furious!

829
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:36,719
- Did you tell her about me?
- I didn't dare to.

830
01:10:37,207 --> 01:10:40,199
- You didn't put the rice in.
- Let the water boil first.

831
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:43,717
- Grandma puts the rice first.
- I put it later.

832
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:49,086
I must be going.
Have a nice evening.

833
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:54,397
You are bad!

834
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:06,839
I will fight! I still have courage.

835
01:11:07,287 --> 01:11:10,359
You have been defeated.
Admit it.

836
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:13,399
You tried things
that were difficult.

837
01:11:13,527 --> 01:11:15,995
You were a woman
working like a man.

838
01:11:16,087 --> 01:11:19,159
That's what makes me furious!
They hurt my pride.

839
01:11:19,207 --> 01:11:21,596
Forget about the boat.

840
01:11:21,847 --> 01:11:26,079
Marry Yakoumis who keeps
coming to me to convince you.

841
01:11:26,727 --> 01:11:30,197
How will I marry him?
I don't love him.

842
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:33,842
What will become of you?
You're starving.

843
01:11:33,927 --> 01:11:36,999
Consider your siblings.
You swore to your father!

844
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:41,086
And I'll keep my promise.
I decided to sell my house.

845
01:11:41,407 --> 01:11:43,557
I'll buy an engine-boat, too.

846
01:11:43,647 --> 01:11:47,720
I won't let that fraud Lambis
laugh at my expense!

847
01:11:48,207 --> 01:11:50,277
I will take my revenge.

848
01:11:50,487 --> 01:11:53,479
And you will sell your house
for revenge?

849
01:11:53,567 --> 01:11:57,606
How will you marry
when your time comes?

850
01:11:57,687 --> 01:12:01,760
Here they say that a bride with
no home, is a groom with no pants!

851
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,197
I know, but I'll sell it!

852
01:12:04,447 --> 01:12:06,642
That spite of yours!

853
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:10,004
Women confess in me
all these years...

854
01:12:10,127 --> 01:12:13,244
and they are still
a mystery to me.

855
01:12:27,767 --> 01:12:30,804
Yes, father... 
I'll sell the house.

856
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:35,240
You were a captain, too.
You understand.

857
01:12:36,207 --> 01:12:39,279
And you will forgive me.

858
01:13:00,447 --> 01:13:01,880
Fire...

859
01:13:02,407 --> 01:13:04,523
The children...

860
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:19,363
Help!

861
01:13:56,327 --> 01:13:58,318
The orphan is alive!

862
01:13:58,407 --> 01:14:00,523
Bring me a blanket!

863
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:02,842
Keep away!

864
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:06,521
My tormented child...

865
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:09,482
A bride with no home...

866
01:14:12,367 --> 01:14:14,562
- Where is she going?
- What is she doing?

867
01:14:14,607 --> 01:14:17,599
She'll burn!
She's lost her mind.

868
01:15:04,647 --> 01:15:06,638
Get up...

869
01:15:06,727 --> 01:15:08,957
Be strong...

870
01:15:11,687 --> 01:15:14,759
For the children.
For the oath you gave.

871
01:15:15,047 --> 01:15:18,278
Yes, father Fotis.
I know. I understand.

872
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:21,837
- Let's go.
- Where?

873
01:15:21,927 --> 01:15:24,122
To Yakoumis.

874
01:15:26,047 --> 01:15:30,040
Sacrifice and mercy.
May God bless you!

875
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,837
Tomorrow...

876
01:16:13,927 --> 01:16:18,045
Tomorrow we'll have
your engagements.

877
01:16:20,087 --> 01:16:22,123
Right, Madalena?

878
01:16:23,007 --> 01:16:25,316
Right... Tomorrow...

879
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:31,318
- You are very happy.
- Yes, but something concerns me.

880
01:16:31,527 --> 01:16:34,564
Madalena has no love inside her.

881
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:38,277
That might separate us
sooner or later.

882
01:16:40,527 --> 01:16:44,600
The people I wed,
love can't separate them.

883
01:17:23,007 --> 01:17:25,965
Stop drinking... 
You'll get drunk.

884
01:17:27,847 --> 01:17:31,283
I will get drunk.
We're celebrating!

885
01:17:33,207 --> 01:17:36,279
Have something to drink.
It'll give you a good mood.

886
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:40,406
I'll find my mood.
When I say "yes", I mean it.

887
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:15,239
Don't drink anymore,
you'll get dizzy.

888
01:18:15,367 --> 01:18:18,518
I'm already dizzy.

889
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:20,757
- So you really love her.
- Shut up!

890
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:22,923
I just asked.

891
01:18:22,967 --> 01:18:26,004
You don't ask a fooI
of his foolishness.

892
01:18:26,447 --> 01:18:30,520
- Yakoumis, won't you dance?
- If Madalena wants to.

893
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:33,844
The circumstance calls for it.

894
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,447
PIay a "baIos" dance!

895
01:19:59,887 --> 01:20:04,005
I wish I could kiss
your eyes, Madalena.

896
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:12,957
Your sweet mouth.

897
01:20:14,647 --> 01:20:17,002
- May I?
- Of course.

898
01:20:17,127 --> 01:20:20,278
- I don't want to.
- It's tradition.

899
01:20:20,407 --> 01:20:22,477
And if I deny him?

900
01:20:22,687 --> 01:20:25,804
Then I'll have to fight him.

901
01:20:28,767 --> 01:20:30,837
I'll dance.

902
01:20:48,127 --> 01:20:51,517
- So you're getting married?
- It doesn't concern you.

903
01:20:51,767 --> 01:20:54,839
- Marrying the one you loath?
- He's not the only one.

904
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:58,522
- You loath me, too?
- Dance and don't talk.

905
01:20:59,727 --> 01:21:01,843
I love you.

906
01:21:02,367 --> 01:21:04,881
You can't imagine how much.

907
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:08,164
- You are crazy...
- Not yet.

908
01:21:08,367 --> 01:21:11,404
- But if I loose you...
- You're drunk.

909
01:21:11,527 --> 01:21:14,644
When I heard you were getting
married, that's when I realized.

910
01:21:14,727 --> 01:21:18,356
It seems I'm in love with you
for a long time.

911
01:21:18,487 --> 01:21:21,524
- And you swore at me!
- I was selfish.

912
01:21:21,567 --> 01:21:24,240
I didn't want to admit
I loved you.

913
01:21:24,287 --> 01:21:27,563
- And you crushed me.
- Now you crushed me, too.

914
01:21:28,447 --> 01:21:32,599
Play a fast "balos"!
Let the organs play!

915
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:35,476
I want to dance!

916
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:37,444
- I'm lost without you.
- Stop it, I'll scream.

917
01:22:37,567 --> 01:22:39,683
- You'll be lost, too.
- Let me.

918
01:22:39,807 --> 01:22:42,958
Is that all you have to say?
Nothing more?

919
01:22:43,047 --> 01:22:46,084
Now, I have nothing...

920
01:22:46,887 --> 01:22:48,957
Slowly...

921
01:22:50,687 --> 01:22:53,326
I loath you...

922
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:57,441
Stop the music!

923
01:22:58,647 --> 01:23:01,684
I can't take it anymore!

924
01:23:08,527 --> 01:23:12,679
Our life is in your hands.
Both mine and Madalena's.

925
01:23:14,367 --> 01:23:18,360
She wants me, too. And
not the one you're giving her.

926
01:23:19,607 --> 01:23:23,566
If I don't marry her, I'm lost.
I'll do crazy things.

927
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:28,238
- I'll have her by force.
- Never! I'll curse you.

928
01:23:29,967 --> 01:23:34,006
Then I have nothing left,
but the sea.

929
01:23:35,607 --> 01:23:37,723
You love her that much?

930
01:23:37,807 --> 01:23:42,517
If we weren't in a church
I could open my heart to you.

931
01:23:42,927 --> 01:23:46,124
I would shout it out
and you'd believe me.

932
01:23:46,447 --> 01:23:48,438
I love her.

933
01:23:48,527 --> 01:23:51,724
Like you love the Virgin Mary.

934
01:23:59,127 --> 01:24:02,199
- Are you leaving?
- I shouldn't have come.

935
01:24:02,327 --> 01:24:07,447
I came to ask for your help
and today you'll engage them.

936
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:11,278
I can see it...
It's too late.

937
01:24:16,967 --> 01:24:20,004
Since I fixed this wedding...

938
01:24:20,407 --> 01:24:23,285
I will have to...

939
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:26,964
My Lord,
what do your Christians ask for!

940
01:24:27,047 --> 01:24:30,164
They'll be saved
and I'll end up in hell!

941
01:24:44,447 --> 01:24:47,678
- Shall we start, Madalena?
- And get over with it.

942
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:54,803
Do you Yakoumis take Madalena
to be your wife?

943
01:24:57,207 --> 01:25:00,324
If Madalena agrees, I do.

944
01:25:03,447 --> 01:25:07,486
Do you take Yakoumis to
be your husband and master?

945
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:12,835
I do.

946
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:17,639
I have to remind you...

947
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:21,084
- This is your life.
- Seven lives.

948
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:27,280
If you have changed your minds
there is still time.

949
01:25:31,607 --> 01:25:33,882
Father, bless us.

950
01:25:46,847 --> 01:25:50,886
The child of the Lord,
Iakovos...

951
01:25:53,207 --> 01:25:57,200
is engaged
to the child of the Lord...

952
01:25:58,327 --> 01:26:01,524
The child of the Lord,
Madalena...

953
01:26:04,487 --> 01:26:07,843
is engaged
to the child of the Lord...

954
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:20,845
Lambis!

955
01:26:21,007 --> 01:26:23,965
I know what I'm saying, son.

956
01:26:25,407 --> 01:26:29,525
What love brings together,
no man can separate.

957
01:26:48,007 --> 01:26:52,364
- So you're getting married.
- To tall handsome man!

958
01:26:57,767 --> 01:27:00,759
I wish you
a life to be a bed of roses!

959
01:27:00,847 --> 01:27:03,077
But not with a hundred leafs!

960
01:27:09,087 --> 01:27:12,159
- It stopped.
- The engine broke down.

961
01:27:12,207 --> 01:27:14,277
I'll fix it now.

962
01:27:14,367 --> 01:27:16,642
Crew, get in!

963
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:26,683
Captain, throw a rope
and I'll pull you!

964
01:28:23,607 --> 01:28:27,725
