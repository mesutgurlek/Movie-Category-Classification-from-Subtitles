1
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,465
More! More!

2
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,680
Mr. Farnham, can l have your autograph?

3
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,909
Sure, honey.
l never refuse the few requests l get.

4
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,520
My mom and dad took me to see
your show on Broadway last year.

5
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,124
l think you're the greatest dancer
in the world.

6
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,329
lt's you and me against Fred Astaire.

7
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,940
-May l cut in?
-Certainly.

8
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,679
-Aren't we supposed to dance?
-l'd love to.

9
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,079
But, unfortunately, l don't know how.

10
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,777
-You don't know how?
-No.

11
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,719
-Then why did you cut in?
-Well, l thought we might sit this one out.

12
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,826
That l know how.

13
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,459
-l'll teach you to dance.
-l'm a very poor pupil.

14
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,792
Follow me. Right foot back.

15
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:33,800
One, two, three, four.

16
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,033
-One, two...
-One, two...

17
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,009
Four.

18
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,309
Shall we try it again?

19
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,178
Only this year they're doing it
without the ''ouch.''

20
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,194
Oh, my poor feet.

21
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,330
l'm afraid you'll never learn.

22
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,932
lt's just as well. l wanted
to get better-acquainted anyway.

23
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,331
-lt's such a short boat ride.
-What, five days?

24
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,938
l wasted four and a half
before l met you.

25
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,539
How do you do?
My name is Tom Farnham.

26
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,337
How do you do? l'm Melinda Howard.

27
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,174
Well, that's over.

28
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,382
Now, what do you say
we throw caution to the winds.

29
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,582
Please. Let's not make up
four and a half days in four seconds.

30
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,288
Okay. l'll wait.
What's another minute or two?

31
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,369
The ship's paper says you're visiting
New York after several years' absence.

32
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:42,506
Oh, really? Did it also give my age and say
that l don't like men who operate so fast?

33
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,935
All right, all right. You win.

34
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,614
After that number l saw you do,
l'd say you were in show business.

35
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,080
l am. ln a way.

36
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,744
l've been touring the provinces
with a small theatrical company.

37
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,751
Saved a little money and decided to come
to America and surprise my mother.

38
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,663
-They always have a mother.
-Gosh, l haven't seen her in years.

39
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:11,129
You've probably heard of her. Jessica
Howard. She's very famous on Broadway.

40
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,931
-On Broadway? Now?
-She's starring in a musical.

41
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,241
Excuse me.
l don't know much about show business.

42
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,840
What do you do, Mr. Farnham?

43
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,415
Oh, l spend most of my time
trying to get girls to call me Tom.

44
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,384
lf you'll excuse me, l just remembered
that l have some packing to do.

45
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,581
-l'll help you.
-Oh, no, thank you, l'll manage.

46
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,919
What's the matter, don't you trust me?

47
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,794
What's this for?

48
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,094
There's a message on it for you
from the women of the world.

49
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,498
Good night, Mr. Farnham.

50
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,765
''ln God we trust.''

51
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,708
Well, it wasn't a total loss.

52
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:40,558
Sorry to disturb you, Diamond Jim,
but that's the front door.

53
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,420
Front door, living room,
master bedroom, library.

54
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,565
This is like living
in a pinball machine.

55
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,997
Can't even eat around here.

56
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:56,099
-Why did l ever leave show business?
-l'll bite. Why did you?

57
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,175
-Yes, miss?
-Oh, how do you do? l'm Miss Howard.

58
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,113
Would you bring in my luggage?
l'll take this one.

59
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,844
l beg your pardon.

60
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,649
Have Mother come down,
but don't say who's here.

61
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,286
This is the residence of Adolph Hubbell.
He has no children.

62
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,295
-That anyone's been able to trace.
-What's he doing in my mother's house?

63
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:25,963
-Are you sure you have the right address?
-This is 485 Beekman Place, isn't it?

64
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,067
Hasn't been changed.

65
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,607
That's the address on every letter
that Mother sends me.

66
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,609
-Oh, no. You're not Melinda Howard?
-Yes.

67
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,751
You're in England.
You're gonna stay there, aren't you?

68
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,817
l'm here.

69
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,423
Follow me.

70
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,489
-Where are we going?
-You should've written you were coming.

71
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,565
-l just wanted to surprise her.
-You'll surprise her.

72
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,499
She's rented the house to Adolph Hubbell.
You know, Hubbell Breweries.

73
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,696
Just while she's on tour.

74
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,205
On tour?

75
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,846
Don't tell me she's out of town.

76
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,347
She's due in a day or so
for a conference with her producers.

77
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,112
-l'll see if l can find her.
-lf she isn't here...

78
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,757
...where am l going to stay?
l haven't any money.

79
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,557
No money?
Welcome to the club.

80
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,691
Am l intruding?

81
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,697
Oh, Gloria. This is Miss Howard.
You know, Jessica's daughter.

82
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,869
Miss Davis, the lucky girl
marrying me.

83
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,367
-How do you do?
-Hello.

84
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,336
Be with you in a minute, Gloria.
This way, please.

85
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,275
A charming room if you don't mind
staying in the servants' wing.

86
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,946
Oh, l don't mind at all.

87
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,449
lt's nice of you to go to all this trouble.

88
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,917
This ought to fix you up temporarily.

89
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,489
And don't worry about your mother.
l'll see that she gets here.

90
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:58,687
-Why shouldn't she?
-Oh, that's right. Why shouldn't she?

91
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,458
l've been one of your mother's
admirers for years.

92
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,569
You see, l- l used to be
in show business myself.

93
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,070
Oh, really?
But then why are you doing this?

94
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:13,803
Oh, l don't know, it was just a mad,
impulsive desire to keep from starving.

95
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,318
-Good night, Bob.
-Thank you.

96
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,690
Joe, hit me.

97
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,428
Jessie, you have another show.
You won't be able to see the customers.

98
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,935
That's all l've got to look forward
to at the end of a hard day.

99
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,266
Not seeing the customers.

100
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,841
-Jessica.
-Hello, Lefty.

101
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,605
-Baby, you're singing better than ever.
-You don't have to lie to me.

102
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,749
We're not on the same bill anymore.

103
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,976
-This isn't exactly the Palace either.
-What will you have?

104
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,351
-Give me a Bromo. With a chaser.
-One olive or two?

105
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:11,554
-Did you mail that check to the kid?
-Yeah, but l could've saved you a stamp.

106
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,925
She's here.

107
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,130
Here? ln New York?

108
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,337
-You didn't bring her down?
-No, she's at the house.

109
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,838
The house she thinks you own.

110
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,908
You've got to send her back.

111
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,979
How do we do it, with mirrors?
She's come to see you.

112
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,843
lt's been a long time.

113
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,216
l draw a blank.
l don't know where to go from here.

114
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,185
There's only one way.
l told her you're on the road.

115
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,259
Tomorrow you come into town for one day,
have a big reunion and go back on the road.

116
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,326
And where do we hold this big reunion?
ln a telephone booth?

117
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,901
l've arranged that too.

118
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,198
Tomorrow the Hubbells throw a party.
Half of Broadway is the entertainment.

119
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,399
-You come back and steal the show.
-lf l can get in.

120
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,779
Here's your invitation.
l made out the guest list.

121
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,609
No, Lefty.

122
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,251
l couldn't face her. l-
She'd know. She'd-

123
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,216
How? Who's gonna tell her?

124
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:13,084
Look at me.
Greenwich Village Gertie.

125
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,826
lt'll be like the old days.
Everybody in town will be there.

126
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,463
Lights, music...

127
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,932
...and Jessica Howard. You'll be a smash.

128
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,398
Do you really think
l could get away with it?

129
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:31,804
lf Jessica Howard
can't play Jessica Howard, who can?

130
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,676
All right, Lefty, l'll try.

131
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,441
-Nine o'clock?
-Sure, sure.

132
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,848
-But promise me one thing.
-Not a drop.

133
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,588
Everything's gonna be all right.

134
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:50,058
lncidentally, the kid's a knockout.

135
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,253
Like her mother.

136
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,262
Hit me again, Joe.

137
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,438
lt's homecoming day.

138
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,145
Hi.

139
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,638
Hello.

140
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,479
ls it all right if l go upstairs
and look around?

141
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,552
-l don't know.
-My mother wrote...

142
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,849
...and told me so much about this place.
l'd like to see it.

143
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,756
Oh, l guess it'll be all right.
Mr. and Mrs. Hubbell are asleep by now.

144
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,624
-Right up those stairs.
-Thanks.

145
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,265
Oh, listen, while you're staying here...

146
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,765
...keep away from Mrs. Hubbell
if you can.

147
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,200
Thanks for the tip.

148
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,830
Oh, this house is so wonderful.

149
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:41,536
-Mother must be doing all right, huh?
-Oh, yes, she's really flying.

150
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,243
Oh, l'm so sorry.

151
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:26,350
-l thought you were asleep.
-Who are you? What are you doing here...

152
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,680
-...twisting around in my living room?
-l'm Miss Howard.

153
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,857
-This means something?
-l hope l didn't disturb you...

154
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,516
...but l just wanted to sort of
have a look around the house.

155
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,698
-lsn't that a beautiful painting?
-Painting? Madam, this is not a museum.

156
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,766
People don't come in off the streets.

157
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,767
Don't do that. lt's liable to leave a ring.

158
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,907
Do you realize how much
a table like this costs?

159
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,839
You are in the furniture business now?

160
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,242
You shouldn't take advantage
that my mother's out of town...

161
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,679
-...and abuse her furnishings.
-l abuse what l want!

162
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:04,322
Please don't spill any more beer. How
would you like it if this were your house?

163
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,821
Right now l wouldn't like it.
What is this?

164
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,791
-Better l get the police.
-Something wrong, sir?

165
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,693
Yes. This girl, she comes in my house,
she dances around in circles.

166
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,130
She won't let me drip beer
on my own rug.

167
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,772
l sneak down to get away
from Mrs. Hubbell, and what do l get?

168
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,406
-Another Mrs. Hubbell.
-Leave everything to me.

169
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,010
Come, l have good news about your mother.
Wait for me downstairs.

170
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,648
-l'll explain everything.
-What's going on in my own house?

171
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,510
Who is she?

172
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:37,087
Do you remember many years ago you
backed a Broadway show, Pretty Lady?

173
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,224
-Of course.
-Remember the star?

174
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,893
Yeah, Jessica Howard.
How could l forget?

175
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,723
A wonderful woman.
Too bad what happened to her.

176
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,527
This girl is Jessica Howard's daughter.

177
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,164
What?

178
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,636
She doesn't know about her mother.
We want to keep it from her.

179
00:17:55,841 --> 00:18:00,301
-Will you help us?
-Anything. Anything l can do.

180
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,480
Thank you, sir.

181
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,074
Sorry, l keep thinking it's my house.

182
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:52,220
The dancing will be interrupted
for a few minutes while two great artists...

183
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:57,061
...who are taking a vacation
from the theater entertain you.

184
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,160
l'm really enjoying myself,
Mr. Hubbell.

185
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,467
Pretty soon your mother gets here,
and even better you will enjoy it.

186
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,473
Lefty. Lefty, you were wonderful.

187
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,579
So why am l passing this tray?

188
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,442
Oh, it's nice that you asked
so many show people.

189
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:37,213
You invite actors,
free entertainment you get.

190
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:42,018
Confidentially, Ferndel, the producer,
brings them so l put money in his show.

191
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:46,391
This way l throw two stones
at one bird.

192
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,190
There's Ferndel now.

193
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,065
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

194
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,966
Here he is, my boy, Tom Farnham.

195
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,903
With the number that will be
the hit of my new show.

196
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,375
-Come on out here, Tom.
-George.

197
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,770
Thank you.

198
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,075
Thank you.

199
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,715
Unaccustomed as l am
to public auditions...

200
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,856
...l'm always glad to raise a buck
for my producer. Let's go, Page.

201
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:16,156
-What's he gonna do?
-Like a dream he dances.

202
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,420
Come up here.

203
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,824
You wouldn't believe this,
but l gave him his first lesson.

204
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,528
Lefty, why her mother don't get here?

205
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,169
l don't know. Keep her occupied
till l find out what's happened.

206
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,568
-All right, l introduce her to Mrs. Hubbell.
-No, no, you stay away from her.

207
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:21,474
What will your wife think? You, taking a
blond and giving her a room in your home?

208
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,480
You mean, you-?
You think she would think that l...?

209
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:31,184
Thank you. That's the nicest thing
anyone has said to me in 15 years.

210
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,753
Thank you.

211
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,860
Oh, Miss Howard.
l have some money for you.

212
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,795
Here's a nickel.
You owe me four insults.

213
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,129
You picked up dancing pretty quickly
for a beginner.

214
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,330
Oh, l'm ready for more lessons anytime.

215
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,973
What are you doing here anyway?
l never thought l'd see you again.

216
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,547
lt's a small, uncomfortable world,
isn't it?

217
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,983
l see l've got a lot of explaining to do.

218
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,748
That was my shipboard treatment
you got that day.

219
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,221
On land, l'm really not a bad guy.

220
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,054
Tell me, how are you underwater?

221
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,788
Would you give me a little time
to redeem myself?

222
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,797
Oh, Tom.

223
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,903
l've got to butter up Mrs. Hubbell.
Back in two seconds.

224
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,835
Oh, you can take longer than that.

225
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,208
-Here, Tom, l think you earned this.
-Thank you, Mrs. Hubbell.

226
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,645
-Did you like my little number?
-l think it'll be wonderful.

227
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,978
ln a show my husband
doesn't have to back.

228
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:39,714
-He hasn't done too badly in show business.
-He's lost everything but his accent.

229
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,518
-Well, now, if you'll excuse me, l-
-Better wait.

230
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:46,891
l may call on you
to rescue my husband from Ferndel.

231
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:51,033
No, no, not even a nickel does my wife
let me put in another Broadway show.

232
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:56,333
But, Adolph, l counted on you for 50,000.
l'm already in rehearsal.

233
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,709
Rehearsal already.
And who picked the chorus girls? You.

234
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,777
Who stages the numbers? You.
Who picks the music? You.

235
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,538
And who pays the bills? Me.

236
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,347
But this is a modern Broadway show.

237
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:12,887
l'd like to have you help, but your taste
in music and girls is a little old-fashioned.

238
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,823
So my money's old-fashioned too.
lt won't go out of the house.

239
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,889
Remember us, Mr. Ferndel?
Davis and Mack?

240
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,499
-Oh, sure, sure.
-We're just working here for laughs.

241
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,830
Not to mention food,
lodging and clothing.

242
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,007
Oh, but the theater's our first love.

243
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,869
Give us a spot in your show,
l'll turn in my dickey.

244
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,341
There isn't gonna be any new show.

245
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,572
My angel just flew the coop.

246
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,447
Freeloader.

247
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,122
-Fine, Tom. Very, very good.
-Thank you.

248
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,295
How much did you go for this time?

249
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,330
Not a cent.
l kept my promise to you. Sure.

250
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,397
Anna, l wonder, do you mind
if l ask something?

251
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,628
-What?
-The music, the excitement...

252
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,536
...l'm getting too old for it.
Every bone in my head aches.

253
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:09,474
Always too old. Always something aches.

254
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:13,980
l just thought if l could go upstairs,
slip away without anyone noticing.

255
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,881
-That's just to get out of dancing with me.
-Anna-

256
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,182
All right, go upstairs
to your hot-water bottle, but l stay.

257
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,225
How can you sneak away? There's people
here who want something from you.

258
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,192
l manage it, don't worry.

259
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,094
Sure you won't mind staying a little longer
and carrying on for me?

260
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:34,169
Not a bit. l'll dance with Tom.
Won't l, Tom?

261
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:39,776
-Well, l... l'd be glad to, Mrs. Hubbell, but-
-Thanks, it helps me out. l won't forget it.

262
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:46,048
Good night, Anna. lf anybody asks for me,
tell them l'm enjoying poor health.

263
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,181
Well, shall we give it a tussle?

264
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,388
Mr. Hubbell. Excuse me,
has my mother arrived yet?

265
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,703
Don't worry, she will come.
Everything l have taken care of.

266
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:12,467
-What are you doing here all alone?
-Oh, l'm trying to avoid a dancing lesson.

267
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,612
What's the matter,
you don't like the teacher?

268
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,312
Well, l haven't made up my mind yet.

269
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:22,850
A pity l am too old,
or l would dance with you.

270
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,648
You would?
Oh, well, you know the old saying:

271
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,950
-''The young in heart never grow old.''
-So?

272
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,220
-l think you're one of the young in heart.
-Thank you.

273
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,893
May l have this dance, please?

274
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,399
-Me?
-Oh, this is a nice waltz.

275
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,402
All right, but too much
you shouldn't expect.

276
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,839
My heart is young,
but my feet are ready to retire.

277
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,945
Shall we then?

278
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,010
-Right now?
-Would you rather wait for the next one?

279
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:55,880
Oh, no, no, by that time,
even older l will be.

280
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,566
Come on, you can do it. lt's easy.

281
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,270
-See? You dance beautifully.
-Thank you.

282
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,278
l'm afraid l'm not as lightheaded
as l used to be.

283
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,947
Look, there's Adolph.

284
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,924
And he told me that he had a headache.

285
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,638
-Getting a little tired?
-No, it's a little crowded.

286
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:58,247
Let's get closer
to where the crowd ain't.

287
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,345
Who is that girl?

288
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,385
Look, l'm gonna stop dancing.
One Hubbell creating a spectacle is enough.

289
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,023
l should cut in.
Before he knocks himself out.

290
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,522
-Yes, go on.
-Excuse me.

291
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,729
Why, Tom, what a surprise.
For years l haven't seen you.

292
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,838
-You know Miss...?
-Howard, Melinda Howard.

293
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,667
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

294
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,709
Excuse me, l see somebody makes motions
to me. Pardon me.

295
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,214
-May l?
-l'm charmed.

296
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,249
Who is that girl, and why did you
come back here to dance with her?

297
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:49,161
You know, when- As l was going out,
l bumped into George- George Gubbins.

298
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,768
-You often hear me speak of him.
-Never.

299
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,531
And what has that got to do with it?

300
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,198
She's his daughter, you know.
Poor child.

301
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,369
Men don't seem to like her.
He asked me to talk to her about it.

302
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:07,881
-Men seem to like her now.
-Yes, l talked to her.

303
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,222
Three O'Clock Club.

304
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,795
Oh, hello, Lefty.

305
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,229
Who? Jessie?

306
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,870
No. No, they poured her out of here
around 2:00 this morning.

307
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:31,169
-What's happened to her?
-The usual. Screaming meanies.

308
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,743
-She was breaking up the joint.
-l'll come down right away.

309
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,414
But she's not here.
They took her away.

310
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,480
Same place.

311
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,251
lt's tough.

312
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,985
-Lefty, any news from her mother?
-She's not going to make it.

313
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,489
Why? What happened?

314
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,458
She's drinking again.
They've taken her to a hospital.

315
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,292
-l better go and see if she's all right.
-Go, l pay all the bills. Go.

316
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,093
-Thank you, boss.
-Go.

317
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:04,104
-Mr. Hubbell, what time is it, please?
-Time, who cares for time?

318
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,503
Mother was supposed
to be here at 9:00-

319
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,508
Why doesn't everybody have fun?

320
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,944
Tom, sing another song.
Give the party a shot in the head.

321
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,778
Please, no more solos.
l'm tied up for the evening.

322
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,851
Well, do something together.

323
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,682
-What?
-Even better it will be.

324
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,717
-Well, what do you say?
-l'll just be in your way.

325
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:25,157
We'll have a wonderful time
falling all over each other.

326
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,263
Come on, you start it.

327
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,098
Will you play ''You're Getting
to Be a Habit With Me''?

328
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,704
Gather around.
Have a little surprise for you.

329
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,705
Now you're gonna get some
real entertainment.

330
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:19,966
Melinda, still up?
What are you doing here?

331
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,435
Everybody goes home an hour ago.

332
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,201
-Oh, Mr. Hubbell, l'm worried.
-Your mother?

333
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,479
Think something happened
to the train?

334
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,046
l promise you, to the train
nothing happened.

335
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,377
Now, please, go to bed.

336
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,716
Lefty, where have you been?
Have you heard anything?

337
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,485
-l just talked to your mother on the phone.
-You did? Where is she?

338
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,993
l don't know how to tell you.
She's not coming home right away.

339
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:51,134
-She's not coming home? Why not?
-You know how it is. The show's a hit.

340
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:55,396
lf they took her out of it, it'd kill
the business. She's the star, you know.

341
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,904
-Did you tell her l was here?
-Of course not.

342
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,339
-You wanted to surprise her.
-That's right.

343
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:04,002
Easy it is to understand.
Maybe you go back to England.

344
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,673
When her show finishes,
she will come to see you, no?

345
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,911
-l'll pack your bags in the morning.
-Lefty, l'm not going.

346
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,649
l'm gonna stay right here and wait
for her, even if it takes months.

347
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,852
Months? You know how long is months?

348
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,930
Oh, l know l was foolish
coming so unexpectedly.

349
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,364
But now that l'm here,
l can't go until l see her.

350
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:30,370
Months. Maybe better you
should go to a hotel and wait.

351
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:34,066
Oh, Mr. Hubbell, if you don't mind,
l'd much rather stay here.

352
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,213
You have so many empty rooms
in the house and everything.

353
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,282
Wouldn't it be kind of foolish
if l went to a hotel?

354
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,112
So foolish l don't know
why you even brought it up.

355
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,879
-Thank you, Mr. Hubbell.
-Yeah.

356
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,057
-Good night.
-Good night.

357
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,060
Adolph, who's downstairs?

358
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:56,393
No, no, no, nobody is downstairs.
Nobody.

359
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,192
Months.

360
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:09,743
Just look at these grocery bills. And most
of them are for food for the servants.

361
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,744
They have to eat.

362
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,577
That butler and maid eat enough
for three people.

363
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,653
No, it's only two. Two actors
is the same as three people.

364
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,086
They're out of the house
most of the time.

365
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:25,490
-They are trying to go back to the theater.
-Well, l hope they get back soon.

366
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:31,328
Anyway, the bills have got to come down,
or they go out. Tell them.

367
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,432
-You rang?
-You heard?

368
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,779
We can't cut down. You wouldn't want us
to deprive Melinda of anything.

369
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,471
Oh, no, no, no, but what can we do?

370
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,780
Well, we could cut down
on your dinners.

371
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:53,116
All right. lf l get hungry,
l'll come down and eat with you.

372
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,122
Maybe l have been spending
too much money on food.

373
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,795
But it's just to keep
Melinda's spirits up.

374
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:02,625
She's in pretty bad shape.
Came all the way to this country.

375
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:08,794
Her mother won't see her. She's broke.
Had to pawn her coat today.

376
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,304
We have to take care of that.

377
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,636
And she cries all the time.

378
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,813
-When nobody's looking.
-lt's terrible, terrible.

379
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:21,178
Mr. Hubbell, you've got a chance
to do something wonderful.

380
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,479
Cheer her up. Take her to dinner,
to a show.

381
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,657
lt'll bring the sunshine to her lips...

382
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,658
...and the rosebuds to her cheeks.

383
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:35,798
Gee, l should be on the dramatic stage
instead of vaudeville.

384
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,798
But how can l take her out?
l am married.

385
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:43,565
-Can you think of a better reason?
-No, l couldn't. My wife. No.

386
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,731
Ferndel was right.

387
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,878
-What you know about Ferndel?
-l heard what he told you.

388
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,071
You're old-fashioned.
You have no eye for beautiful women.

389
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,911
He shouldn't judge me by my wife.

390
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,588
But what would he think if he saw you
with Melinda tonight, alone...

391
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:05,353
...having dinner?
Wouldn't you feel young again?

392
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,327
l wouldn't be old-fashioned then, huh?

393
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:15,200
Why, you may have found the leading lady
for his new show right under his nose.

394
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,930
Already l feel younger.

395
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,167
But, Melinda, you think she
would come to dinner with me?

396
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,505
Yes. She knows
you're trying to help her.

397
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:27,080
She's worried and alone.
Why, you'd be doing her a good turn.

398
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,378
Tonight l'll do my good deed.

399
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,723
Wasn't it nice of Mr. Hubbell
to ask me to dinner?

400
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:45,299
You remember one thing, dearie.
Don't let him get any ideas.

401
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,733
What? Why, he's like a father to me.

402
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:54,343
Take it from a girl who's been out with a lot
of fathers in her time, lead with your left.

403
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,706
Here you are, sir.

404
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,848
Every night he has to go
to his club for pinochle.

405
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:05,317
Mama, tonight l got a feeling
l'm going to hold the best hand in years.

406
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,585
-Good night, darling.
-Good night.

407
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:11,090
Don't wait up for me.
The game may go on for hours.

408
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,164
-Good night, Mr. Hubbell.
-Good night.

409
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,684
-Oh, good evening, Mr. Hubbell.
-Good evening, Mr. Mack.

410
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,863
ls she ready?

411
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,000
-All ready, Mr. Hubbell?
-Come on, then. We go stepping.

412
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:57,002
Oh, forgot my hat.

413
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:01,703
-Already l feel 20 years younger.
-Adolph?

414
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,346
l feel 20 years older.

415
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:10,053
What are you doing here? l thought
you were going to play pinochle.

416
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,721
-l...
-Mr. Hubbell just dropped in...

417
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,892
...to give us a lecture
on our extravagance.

418
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,924
And he had a perfect right
to mention it to us.

419
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,893
-Our food bill has been much too high.
-Much high.

420
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,567
We'll cut down someplace.

421
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,032
l didn't think he'd speak
to you about it.

422
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:30,934
That's the reason l came downstairs.
Thank you. Have a good game.

423
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,871
l will, l will. Don't wait up for me.
Good night.

424
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,569
Good night.

425
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,356
-What's the matter with that door?
-lt was stuck.

426
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,287
-Didn't l hear Mrs. Hubbell down here?
-Big as life.

427
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:54,430
-Oh, is she coming with us?
-No, a headache she has. Too bad.

428
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,189
Come.

429
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,861
-Well, have fun.
-Don't worry.

430
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,600
Sidney, the theater's dying.

431
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:35,204
The angels aren't happy just to lose their
money, they want to produce the flops too.

432
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,067
All of which means Hubbell
didn't stand still, huh?

433
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,106
He wanted to help with the casting.

434
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:45,213
And the old boy doesn't know
a pretty girl from a guernsey cow.

435
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:50,183
Hey, don't look now, but he just walked
in with the pride of the dairy.

436
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,660
-Two, Mr. Hubbell?
-You said it, kiddo.

437
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,830
Yes, sir.

438
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,868
That girl was at his party.
She's a pretty good performer.

439
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,978
Or she runs a little hat shop.

440
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,374
You don't think that-?

441
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:21,813
Offer her a part in your show and see how
quickly he pulls out his checkbook.

442
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,381
-A drink before dinner?
-Oh, not for me, thank you.

443
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,889
How about you, Mr. Hubbell?
Your usual beer?

444
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:33,495
Beer? Where you been living, pop?
ln a cave?

445
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,661
-A double zombie.
-For you?

446
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:42,532
What's the matter, you want
to see my driver's license?

447
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,168
l tell your fortune.

448
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,174
Good evening, Adolph.

449
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,075
Hello, kid. How is tricks?

450
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,773
Haven't l seen your charming
companion somewhere?

451
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,180
At the party the other night,
Mr. Ferndel.

452
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,548
She is my discovery.

453
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,487
l pick pretty good
for an old-fashioned Joe, huh?

454
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,924
My compliments.
She also has a good voice.

455
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,597
-Thank you.
-Naturally.

456
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,426
So l am putting her into a show.

457
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:15,936
-Mr. Hubbell, you didn't tell me.
-He's full of surprises tonight.

458
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,598
To Adolph Hubbell, the star-maker.

459
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,273
Are you trying to run me off the street?

460
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,040
Why can't we get together
on my new show?

461
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:30,243
l'm sure we can find something
very interesting in it for this young lady.

462
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,855
Well, everyone seems to have my future
pretty well settled.

463
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:40,453
l don't know. We'll see
about backing your show. Maybe.

464
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:44,794
How much l write in my checkbook
depends on how much l got to say.

465
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:48,563
Mr. Hubbell,
you're producing the show.

466
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,464
l'll give you the check tomorrow.

467
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:55,236
All made out and ready for you
to sign, Adolph. There.

468
00:46:55,779 --> 00:47:00,409
Tom Farnham will be at my office at 2:30
tomorrow to run through some numbers.

469
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,484
lt'll be a good time for us
all to get together.

470
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,815
Don't blow on it! After that zombie,
you might scorch it.

471
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:09,549
-l can pick them, huh?
-So can l.

472
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,593
-Well, see you tomorrow, Miss Howard.
-Fine.

473
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,787
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

474
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:21,935
l remember your mother once sung
a great song, ''Lullaby of Broadway.''

475
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:27,001
-That was her favorite.
-l'll revive it and let you sing it.

476
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,007
-l got another idea.
-What?

477
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:35,685
Tonight l am full of them.

478
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:39,322
We call the show Lullaby of Broadway.

479
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,858
May l have your order, madam?

480
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:48,964
l'm so excited, l think
l'll just have crackers and milk.

481
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:53,830
And for dessert she has shrimp cocktail,
steak, potatoes and coffee.

482
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:57,470
-And you?
-Another double zombie.

483
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:02,477
Yes, sir.

484
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,458
-They're very nice, but $ 1500?
-lt is our established price.

485
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:24,065
Then how come the model l see
in the window-? This one, you see.

486
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:25,701
Please, please, come down.

487
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:30,840
No, you are the one should come down.
The price here is only 1400. Yes.

488
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:56,289
Mr. Hubbell, are you all right?
Would you like some water?

489
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,027
-Water? A double zombie.
-That's a nice jacket you're modeling.

490
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,263
You got nothing better to do
than peek in store windows?

491
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,374
l'm sure it'll look much nicer
on your wife.

492
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:11,546
-l'll take it. This one in the window.
-Yes, sir, l'll have it giftwrapped.

493
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:15,445
l'll come and put the card on it
and take it with me.

494
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,446
lt isn't for my wife.

495
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,054
Don't mind me,
l still read The Bobbsey Twins.

496
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:24,353
lt's for a girl who is lonely in New York.
l want her to know she has a friend.

497
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,052
No better way to win friends
and influence girls.

498
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,700
You keep it under your hat.
l wouldn't want it to drip out.

499
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,266
My lips are sealed.

500
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,632
And now, if you have to be
at Ferndel's office by 2:30...

501
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,740
...please don't let me detour you.

502
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:05,157
Hello, doll. Who's inside?
Somebody trying out?

503
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,099
-Mr. Hubbell has a little surprise for you.
-For me?

504
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,170
Take a look.

505
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,007
-Surprise!
-Yes, surprise.

506
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,041
-But the sock is on the other shoe.
-What's this about?

507
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,542
l'm giving her a part
in Lullaby of Broadway.

508
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,408
-That's great.
-That's wonderful!

509
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,583
Only a half-hour rehearsal she has...

510
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:32,187
...and she sings ''Somebody Loves Me''
like nobody in the world.

511
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:35,415
l'd like to hear it.
Come on, let's do it together.

512
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:41,427
-You think you can handle this, Buddy?
-Oh, l think l can.

513
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,918
That's enough.

514
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:40,321
-We work pretty good together, huh?
-Yes, she makes you look good.

515
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,583
Come on, Ferndel,
l think l run along.

516
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:43,986
-Goodbye.
-So long.

517
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,388
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

518
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,496
Keep working,
maybe she teaches you something.

519
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,338
Well, thanks again for everything.

520
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:01,943
-l told you l could pick them, huh?
-You certainly can.

521
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:06,946
Only one mistake l made in my life,
and l married it.

522
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,619
What a small, wonderful world.
Here we are in a show together.

523
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,847
Oh, l can hardly believe it.

524
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,117
-Here.
-Thank you.

525
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:22,194
Did you really like
the way l did the number?

526
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,526
Honey, in the first part
you were great.

527
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,202
-Oh, good.
-But...

528
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,702
...l think we can improve
on that kiss.

529
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,544
-Care to run through it for a half an hour?
-Thank you...

530
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,974
...but l wouldn't think
of imposing on you.

531
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,648
Oh, that's all right.
l don't mind a bit.

532
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:42,215
Now, relax.
Approach it like a loser.

533
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:45,980
lf you're going to fight it,
you'll have a long downhill struggle.

534
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,953
Mr. Farnham, l may have been
in Europe...

535
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,060
...but l'm sure that kissing
is the same the world over.

536
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:55,231
You'll have to sell me.
And stop calling me Mr. Farnham.

537
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,161
The name's Tom.

538
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,233
Now, here we go.

539
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,068
Close your eyes.

540
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,570
Pucker up.

541
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,905
A little more.

542
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,015
What'd you say your name was?

543
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,594
Hi. What are you two doing up?

544
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,097
-Something wrong?
-lt's Gloria.

545
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,739
She's about to tear down something
that's big and fine and noble.

546
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:43,572
lt's Mr. Hubbell. Bright eyes here started
something that's gotten a little out of hand.

547
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,782
But how? Mr. Hubbell's been wonderful
to me.

548
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:51,113
Why, he gave me a part in the show,
and he's been devoting so much time to me.

549
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:54,881
-Why?
-Well, l guess he thinks l have talent.

550
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,685
lf he doesn't,
then it's just out of friendship.

551
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,554
Come here.

552
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,055
You don't spend money like this
on a friend.

553
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,669
lt was left here this afternoon.
l opened it thinking it was the groceries.

554
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,133
l've never seen anything so beautiful.

555
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,775
Oh, Melinda, you're such a babe
in the woods.

556
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,905
''To keep your little shoulders warm
when l take you to the benefit...

557
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,812
...at the Broadway Theatre. Adolph.''
Oh, isn't that sweet of him?

558
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:27,717
Yes. lmagine him worrying
about your little shoulders.

559
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,324
Oh, now, wait a minute.

560
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,463
Gloria, you don't really think
that Mr. Hubbell and l-?

561
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:39,226
At his age? Why, that's
the most ridiculous thing l've ever heard.

562
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,300
l don't know about that.

563
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,667
Lots of times there's snow on the roof
and fire in the cellar.

564
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:49,106
So what? lf it gets too hot,
you can always turn the damper down.

565
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,780
Oh, you couldn't believe
that of Mr. Hubbell.

566
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,380
l've been around, honey.

567
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,848
As long as they've got a pulse beat,
they're in there pitching.

568
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,545
l'm ashamed of you.
l'm ashamed of both of you.

569
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,157
He shouldn't have sent this expensive coat,
and l'm returning it.

570
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,295
But as far as thinking what you did-

571
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:10,023
Don't link me with Gloria in this.
Mentally, we're perfect strangers.

572
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:13,064
Well, l'm gonna show you
how wonderful Mr. Hubbell is.

573
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:16,670
He's going to get Mr. Ferndel
to give you both a spot in the show.

574
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:22,435
As for that coat, l'll call the furrier's myself
and have them take it back.

575
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,357
You got a mink coat to return
to Thayler's?

576
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,360
Not so loud. Just a minute.

577
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:50,001
Come here, Mr. Mack,
and see what l've got.

578
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,540
And l thought Mr. Hubbell
forgot my birthday.

579
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:02,617
Just look how small he got it.
He thinks l'm still as thin as l used to be.

580
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,385
He's so sweet.

581
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,420
When he sees you, he thinks
of a young, beautiful girl.

582
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,388
Oh, thank you, Mr. Mack.

583
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,559
-You think it's becoming?
-You look charming.

584
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,197
Thank you, Mr. Mack.

585
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,733
Oh, a note.

586
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:24,402
-Thank you.
-All in the day's work.

587
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:29,101
Oh, just listen to this. Tonight Mr. Hubbell's
taking me to the Beaux Arts Benefit.

588
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:32,007
My best evening gown is at the cleaners.
Go get it.

589
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:36,117
-l got something to tell Mr. Hubbell.
-Tell him later. Go to the cleaners.

590
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,116
l need that dress.

591
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,754
Wait. l'm in a hurry.
Where's that mink?

592
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,657
l couldn't get it back in the box
with what was in it.

593
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,838
-What are you got up for?
-Thank you.

594
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:07,278
lt's a little small, but your heart
was in the right place.

595
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,614
The jacket! Where you got it? How?

596
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:15,621
l'm sorry to spoil your surprise,
but l found it on the table downstairs.

597
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:19,457
Downstairs? How far downstairs?

598
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,961
Downstairs. You did buy it for me,
didn't you?

599
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,101
No. l mean yes, yes.

600
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,134
Oh, and l loved the note
you pinned on it.

601
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,806
What note?

602
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,304
lnviting me to the Broadway Theatre
tonight.

603
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:38,538
-You did invite me, didn't you?
-No. Yes, yes.

604
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,046
What's the matter?
Don't you want to take me?

605
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,811
No, l- Sure, l-
Why shouldn't l want-?

606
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,887
My darling, l just forget to buy you
the corsage.

607
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:51,550
Thank you. You've been thoughtful enough
as it is. l'll wait for you downstairs.

608
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,404
Tonight everything happens so quick.

609
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:07,872
Your wife was like a retriever
the way she went after that fur.

610
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,170
l left it for one second in the hall...

611
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,213
...and the next second
she's rooting it out of the box.

612
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,408
Worse yet. Melinda waits for me
at the Broadway Theatre...

613
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,177
...to take her to the benefit.

614
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,913
You have to go down and
tell her l don't show up.

615
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:24,025
Say l am sick. And it is no lie.

616
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,889
lt's our night off.
Gloria and me are going bowling.

617
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,087
lt won't take you a minute to stop.

618
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,860
Just so everything in the end
straighten itself out.

619
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:38,264
But the coat. How do l get
the mink coat back from my wife?

620
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,051
No. lt would ruin the coat.

621
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,218
Mink coat, mink coat.

622
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,865
-Oh, there she is.
-Hi, Melinda.

623
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:14,805
What are you doing?
l thought you were going bowling.

624
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:19,072
-We are, but we got a message for you.
-Mr. Hubbell can't meet you. He's sick.

625
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,477
Sick? Oh, that's too bad.

626
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:24,084
We'll make it up to you
and take you with us.

627
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,312
-Well, hello, everybody.
-Hi, Tom.

628
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,490
ls this private,
or can anybody get in?

629
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:31,159
Barge right in. We're going bowling.
A foursome?

630
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,592
Thanks very much, Lefty,
but l'm on the bill tonight.

631
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,628
Aren't you overdressed for bowling?

632
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,267
l was going to the theater
with Mr. Hubbell...

633
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,994
...and Gloria told me he's sick
and can't come.

634
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:45,834
-Hubbell?
-l guess he wanted me to see your act.

635
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,101
You can see it.
l'll take you backstage.

636
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,279
-Oh, good. Do you mind?
-Not a bit.

637
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,675
You can come too, Gloria.

638
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:58,283
-No, you don't.
-All right, Lefty, l understand.

639
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,512
But why didn't you let me go?

640
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:05,524
What, are you crazy or something?
Who's gonna set up my pins? Come on.

641
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,131
Ladies and gentlemen,
recently on my trip abroad...

642
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,934
...l visited a famous toy maker
in the beautiful city of Florence.

643
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:25,672
l discovered he had perfected
life-size mechanical dancing figures...

644
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,907
...of which his toys are replicas.

645
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,779
l induced him to bring
his dancing dolls to America.

646
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,455
So tonight for the first time
in this country...

647
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:38,320
...the De Mattiazzis present
their dancing mechanical dolls.

648
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:12,924
Music, maestro, please.

649
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:45,851
-What are you looking at?
-There's Mr. Hubbell.

650
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,449
Well, he certainly made
a quick recovery, didn't he?

651
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:57,023
-Tom. Tom, look. lsn't that sweet?
-lsn't what sweet?

652
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:00,031
Mr. Hubbell gave the mink jacket
to his wife.

653
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,069
lsn't it customary for a husband
to give his wife furs?

654
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:06,571
Certainly, but in this case
he didn't originally buy it for her.

655
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,471
l'll say he didn't.

656
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,646
Looks a little small, doesn't it?

657
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,543
l guess he forgot we don't wear
the same size.

658
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:17,310
We? What is this, a sister act?

659
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,150
-You're on next, Tom.
-Right, Eddie.

660
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,553
Go on with me. We're doing
''l Love the Way You Say Goodnight.''

661
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,751
We've rehearsed it enough.
Now we can show it to the boss.

662
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,396
-Are you serious?
-Of course.

663
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,657
l can't dance in this.

664
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,995
-With or without the kiss?
-l don't know.

665
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:38,196
-Your big romance is out front.
-Oh, silly.

666
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,599
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
a surprise.

667
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:13,297
From the forthcoming show,
Lullaby of Broadway...

668
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:18,105
...a preview of one of the new numbers.
l hope you like it. Music, professor.

669
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,390
Put her there, partner. l think we're in.

670
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,192
-Melinda.
-Yeah?

671
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:37,269
l want to get something straight.
Did he buy that mink coat for you?

672
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:40,101
He wanted to, but, naturally,
l gave it back to him.

673
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,675
-He's been nice enough already.
-Have you been seeing him?

674
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:46,177
Of course, we're very good friends.

675
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,613
-And you've been going out with him?
-Naturally.

676
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:53,811
-Why do you ask?
-How much comes naturally with you?

677
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,258
l better take you home.

678
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,774
-You live here?
-Yes.

679
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,537
-But this is Hubbell's house.
-Well, naturally.

680
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,580
-Will you stop using that word?
-He was nice enough to let me stay here.

681
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:23,217
That's awfully white of him.

682
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,852
Well, it's better than paying
for a hotel room.

683
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,488
What?

684
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:31,421
lt's a shame we had to leave so early.
We could've gone out together.

685
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:34,425
That would have been cozy.
He was with his wife.

686
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,564
Oh, what difference does that make?

687
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,191
-lt wouldn't have bothered you?
-Well, of course not.

688
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:45,539
lt would've given me a chance to tell her
how wonderful Mr. Hubbell's been to me.

689
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,141
You mean, you'd have told her?

690
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,136
Well, why not?

691
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,204
Look, Melinda, l've got to go home
while l still know where l live.

692
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:59,115
-Hey, aren't you gonna kiss me good night?
-Does everybody?

693
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,656
-Did you have a good time?
-l should've slapped his face.

694
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,836
You had a good time.

695
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:24,539
-She'll be right along.
-Confidentially, how is she?

696
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:27,375
She'll be all right
as long as she stays this way.

697
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:30,245
So long. Don't think
it hasn't been charming.

698
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:34,047
Don't play another
return engagement, dearie.

699
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,817
-l'm gonna take you right to the house.
-What for?

700
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:41,360
We've held the curtain long enough.
Time to make an appearance.

701
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:45,090
ln this condition?
Not a chance, big boy.

702
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:49,203
l want her to remember me the way
l looked the last time she saw me.

703
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,635
l was young and pretty.

704
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,070
-l was Broadway's darling.
-Jessica, listen.

705
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:58,610
l was a headliner, a star.
Next to closing, my name in lights.

706
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,874
Nothing was too good
for Jessica Howard.

707
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,315
Now nothing's too bad.

708
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:09,384
Old, ugly, has-been, once-was.

709
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:12,458
A voice that even the drunks
won't listen to.

710
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:17,025
Jessica Howard, the beer singer
of Washington Square.

711
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,860
Why go back to the club?
Just take it easy.

712
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,663
Take it easy? l've got to earn a living.

713
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:25,305
l've got a kid to support.

714
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,804
l'm dying to see her, Lefty...

715
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:32,208
...but she's just got to wait
until l straighten myself out.

716
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,576
Come on.

717
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,849
Hello? We should be very happy
to exchange the jacket for a larger size.

718
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:49,792
But l here can find no record of any coat
for Mrs. Adolph Hubbell...

719
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:52,865
...of 485 Beekman Place.

720
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,763
Oh, wait a minute, madam.
Yes, there was a call to pick up a jacket.

721
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:58,303
Yesterday.

722
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:01,340
From a Miss Melinda Howard
of the same address.

723
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,602
A Miss Melinda Howard, eh?

724
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:08,146
-Are you sure it wasn't a Miss Gubbins?
-Yes, l'm quite sure.

725
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:12,013
Thank you, you don't know
what a help you've been.

726
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,084
Adolph.

727
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:19,454
-Yes, my darling.
-Where are you going?

728
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:22,221
-To play some pinochle.
-At this hour?

729
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,127
We are having a matine.

730
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:30,862
-How can you play so much pinochle?
-l force myself.

731
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,200
Lefty.

732
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:04,872
Gloria.

733
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:08,065
Oh, l forget, they are at rehearsal.

734
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:12,708
Melinda. Melinda, l take you to rehearsal.

735
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:19,377
Melinda, it's me. Adolph.

736
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:30,129
Would you care to play pinochle with me?

737
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,300
Mama!

738
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,527
Here's your paper, Mr. Farnham.

739
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:12,772
Thanks, Elmer.

740
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:42,236
-Melinda.
-Come in.

741
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,368
-Hi.
-Hello.

742
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:49,200
What does a fella have to do
to make you smile?

743
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:53,214
As soon as we finish rehearsing,
l'd like to have a talk with you.

744
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,044
ls something wrong?

745
01:15:57,352 --> 01:16:00,617
Just remember, whatever happens,
l'll stick with you.

746
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,926
-How about a statement?
-You deny the allegations?

747
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:16,536
-How did you meet?
-Did he give you a bracelet?

748
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:19,138
-ls Mr. Hubbell still in town?
-What?

749
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,367
-Haven't you seen this?
-His wife's gonna sue for divorce.

750
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,570
-Here, read the story.
-Let me read one of these papers.

751
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:29,647
-Didn't he give you a charge account?
-ls it true you call him Cuddles?

752
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:33,378
Mr. Hubbell is a gentleman,
and l respect him as l would my father.

753
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:37,389
-That's all there is to it.
-All right, boys. All right. All right.

754
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,652
Miss Howard has no statement to make.

755
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:43,957
lf you'll be good sports and wait a minute,
we both may give you one. Deal?

756
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:46,293
-Okay, Tom.
-lt's a deal.

757
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,095
-Come on out, have a smoke.
-l need a cigarette.

758
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:02,540
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Everything's gonna be all right.

759
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,685
By tomorrow, they'll forget it.

760
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,481
And as for your mother,
l'm sure she'll understand.

761
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,386
-l hope so.
-l know so.

762
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:13,993
She'll be just as forgiving as l am.

763
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:17,498
Forgiving?

764
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,862
What you've done is over.
We're never gonna mention it again.

765
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:24,731
-What do you mean by that remark?
-The past is over.

766
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,374
We've got the future to look forward to.

767
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:30,101
What past are you talking about?

768
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,877
l love you, darling.
l want you to marry me.

769
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:39,277
You left out four words, didn't you?

770
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,787
-What words?
-''ln spite of everything.''

771
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,118
You didn't say them,
but you meant them.

772
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,852
-Oh, now, look, Melinda-
-Look, nothing.

773
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:52,663
l suppose l should be grateful to you
for offering to make an honest girl of me...

774
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:56,668
...but l'm not grateful.
l'm just disgusted.

775
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,403
Get out of here.
l never wanna see you again.

776
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,769
-Melinda, please.
-Get out of here.

777
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:16,322
Miss Howard.

778
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,551
-Please, won't you let me alone?
-l'm not gonna bother you.

779
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:22,559
Just give me an exclusive
on the story.

780
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,857
l have nothing more to say.

781
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:28,161
Okay, Miss Howard,
l was only trying to...

782
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,838
Hey, wait a minute.

783
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:33,406
Are you and Jessica Howard related?

784
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,101
She happens to be my mother.

785
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:39,212
Jessica Howard of the Three O'Clock Club?

786
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:43,748
-The Three O'Clock Club? What's that?
-lt's a clip joint down in Greenwich Village.

787
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,180
You mind if l take this?

788
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:48,982
We don't have a picture of your mother
without a glass in her hand.

789
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:58,824
Listen, lady, either come in or get out.
You can't stand here.

790
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,963
And now for the local news.

791
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:12,106
Melinda Howard, pretty actress
named as co-respondent...

792
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:16,437
...in the divorce suit against millionaire
Adolph Hubbell, has disappeared.

793
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:20,081
A citywide search has failed
to reveal her whereabouts.

794
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,284
Mr. Hubbell.

795
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:27,480
Listen, Adolph, what are we going to do
about the show?

796
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:30,886
lf your wife's divorce suit
chased our star out of town...

797
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:34,027
...l'm coming up there
and break her arm in three places.

798
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,925
Upstairs, downstairs and in the basement.

799
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:40,291
Don't forget, we got an attic.

800
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:50,134
She's probably hiding somewhere,
alone and hungry.

801
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:53,946
lt's tough starving to death, isn't it?

802
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:57,718
lt all depends on how much
you like food.

803
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:02,651
-Hello.
-Hello, Lefty.

804
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,882
Melinda!

805
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,091
Lefty, will you do something for me?

806
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:11,822
We've hunted high and low for you.
Your mother's in town.

807
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:16,399
She's been in town all along.
At the Three O'Clock Club.

808
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:18,970
l don't have to have a brick house
fall on me.

809
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,869
l know she doesn't care anything
about seeing me.

810
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:26,246
Wait, you've got the wrong angle.
Your mother's had a lot of hard luck.

811
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:29,246
She didn't want you to know
she was singing in a joint.

812
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:32,309
Do you think that would've made
any difference?

813
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,546
ls that the best excuse she can offer
for not seeing me?

814
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:39,457
Well, there were other fluid reasons.

815
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:44,392
Lefty, l wanna go home on the
Queen Victoria, and it sails this afternoon.

816
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:48,125
Now, l've reserved my ticket.
Would you come down and pay for it?

817
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:51,066
l'll send the money back to you
when l get home.

818
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:55,367
What about the show? lt opens tonight.
They haven't got anybody to replace you.

819
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:59,369
Do you think l could face people
after all that's happened?

820
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,515
Will you come and help me
with my ticket, or won't you?

821
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,981
Okay, if that's the way you want it.
Who am l to fight you.

822
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:10,453
ln the hands of a woman,
l'm so much putty.

823
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:33,006
Everything's all set. You got a nice cabin
several feet from the rail.

824
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:36,775
-Here's a bottle of seasick pills.
-Thanks, l'll probably need them.

825
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:39,646
Lefty takes them when he goes
to a newsreel theater.

826
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,082
-Why?
-He gets seasick...

827
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,655
...when he sees the fleet come in.

828
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:48,291
Come on. Here we are.

829
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:50,862
Go in and see how you like it.

830
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:04,242
-Mother.
-That's what it says on the birth certificate.

831
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,072
l guess that's the only way
you could tell.

832
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:15,887
Melinda...

833
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:18,191
...don't make it tougher than it is.

834
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,157
But l thought you didn't wanna see me.

835
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:25,129
You've got it all wrong.
l didn't want you to see me.

836
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,564
Why? Just because you had tough luck?

837
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,330
That's when l should've been
with you.

838
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:35,466
l know it now, dear.

839
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:39,202
lf we'd been together,
all this wouldn't have happened.

840
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,012
You've seen the newspapers?

841
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,341
-Do you believe it?
-Of course not.

842
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:49,023
But you mustn't run away.
Or other people will think it's true.

843
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:53,091
But l can't stay after all those
terrible things they've said about me.

844
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:57,094
Look, darling, don't make
the same mistake l did.

845
01:23:57,298 --> 01:24:02,201
All my life l was running away,
trying to hide from unpleasant things.

846
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:04,770
And look at all the unhappiness
it's caused.

847
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:09,602
-But what about the Hubbells?
-Mrs. Hubbell knows the truth now.

848
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,745
Thanks to Lefty.

849
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:15,046
The little man's had a busy day.

850
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,047
l still can't go back.

851
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:21,512
There's another reason.

852
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:23,852
Tom?

853
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:27,227
l never wanna see him again.

854
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:30,827
He's evil-minded.
He's conceited, condescen-

855
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:35,025
-How do you know about him?
-Lefty told me.

856
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:40,268
-You love Tom, don't you?
-Oh, yes.

857
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:43,736
Look, it's tough for me
to talk like a mother.

858
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:46,573
l need a couple of more rehearsals.

859
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:48,612
But if you love that boy...

860
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:50,511
...don't lose him.

861
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:54,245
He'll never look at me now.
Not after what l've said to him.

862
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,055
He'll look at you.

863
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,392
And remember this, sweetheart:

864
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:03,291
From here in, it's you and me together.

865
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,360
Mother.

866
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,037
Can't you wait a few minutes?

867
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:13,104
The passengers who have this room
are onboard.

868
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:17,142
How long do you expect to use this room
for $5?

869
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:19,774
Let's get down to the theater.

870
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:25,078
l hate peace and comfort. You still got the
2 bucks you were saving for a rainy day?

871
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,880
-Yeah. Why?
-Well, break it out, it's pouring.

872
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:31,422
-Come on, Melinda.
-Oh, Mother, my bag.
