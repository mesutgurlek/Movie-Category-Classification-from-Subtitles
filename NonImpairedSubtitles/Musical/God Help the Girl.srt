You could argue even, you know,
Nick Drake's mystique is a lot

3
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,037
to do with him not being around,
d'ya know what I mean?

4
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:38,437
If Nick Drake was now
on <i>Chatty Man</i> with Alan Carr,

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,709
talking about his new record,

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,678
that mystique would
be dissipated, wouldn't it?

No, you're absolutely right,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ian Curtis has got two albums.

ever see Joy Division?"

they were always around,

14

mystique builds inextricably.

Starting to think that
both of us still being here

328
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,165
Makes him sound like
early Joseph Cale.

329
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,700
Sounds like the Pastels
and everything.

330
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,536
I mean, that is absolutely
definitive indie,

331
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,605
isn't it, really, I mean
the look with the sort of,

332
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,341
you know, an anorak and hair
that looks slightly

333
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,110
like it's been dipped
in chip fat, you know?

334
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:32,844
I used to try and dress
like Roddy Frame in 1981.

335
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,884
You didn't get a girlfriend
till you were 30, did you?

336
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,654
Excuse me, hi.

337
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,589
Are you guys doing
a live session tonight?

338
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:44,856
-Yeah.
-What's your band called?

339
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,561
Wobbly Legged Rats.

340
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,329
Oh, yeah, I've heard of you.

341
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,933
If I give you something,

342
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,303
could you give it
to Findley or Donovan?

343
00:23:58,304 --> 00:23:58,503
-Sure.
-This is really important.

344
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,808
They're expecting this tape.

345
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,042
I'll give it to them
the second I see them.

346
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:07,445
Okay.

347
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,882
Did we meet before?

348
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,086
Nope, never.

349
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,622
I would have remembered.
I am Anton.

350
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,992
We play at the Berlin Club
in a few days

351
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:24,495
and I can add you to the list
if you'd like.

352
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,898
Okay, sure,
I'll try and make it.

353
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,299
All right.

354
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:28,933
Just please give them
the tape, okay?

355
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,637
Remember to give them
the tape.

356
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,741
-Yes.
-Thank you.

357
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,476
Nice to meet you.

358
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,850
She is unbelievable.

359
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,953
Yup, but it's not like
she's gonna look at us

360
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,855
with all the Swiss Germans here.

361
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:51,856
No, there's no way she's getting
past the big Swiss German.

362
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,562
Life is tragic.

363
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,863
But good.

364
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:10,808
Eve.

365
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,579
I've been out
of the city for a while.

366
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:16,814
Maybe you can tell me
if I start acting conspicuous.

367
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,454
I like conspicuous.

368
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,859
Probably take the freakiest
thing about you and blow it up.

369
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,167
-Are your hands cold?
-No.

370
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:39,370
I bet if I touched your hands
they'd be freezing cold.

371
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,372
My hands are fine.

372
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,284
Cold, knew it.

373
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,788
I couldn't stand that, I mean,
I'd get sick instantly.

374
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,724
I've got the constitution
of an abandoned rabbit.

375
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,329
When did you learn to play?

376
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,198
I've always played.

377
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,633
Show me something.

Just you, just now.

416
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,818
-You're very good at it.
-Thank you.

417
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,790
I've been teaching this girl
to play guitar.

418
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,230
Mm-hm.

419
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,699
You should come with me
some time.

420
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,368
And what do you want
me to do?

421
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,703
Maybe we could work
on one of your songs?

422
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,572
Or you could help
her write something.

423
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,074
I mean, she wants to write,
but she doesn't quite have

424
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,743
your way.

425
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,645
You may have to pretend
to be my assistant.

426
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,548
-Carry your pencils and stuff?
-Exactly.

427
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,719
Some thought should be put in
to the matter of what to wear.

428
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,559
Hi, James.

429
00:29:57,496 --> 00:30:00,097
Cassie, this is Eve.

430
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,845
Do you mind us
hijacking your lesson?

431
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,715
It depends, are you going
to make me play scales?

432
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,285
o.
-Then I don't mind.

433
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,657
So, what would you rather do?

434
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,326
Well, when I started this,
I was hoping

435
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,729
we were going to write songs.

436
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,831
It does help to know
your instrument first.

437
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,034
(sighs)

438
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,476
I think sometimes
you just need to know the chord

439
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,112
you're looking for.

440
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,648
Yeah, but how do you find it?

441
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:51,215
Well, maybe we should just
try and write a song right now.

442
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,120
-Okay.
-Well...

443
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,822
a good song isn't written
by committee, I don't know if--

444
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:58,589
Cassie, what have
you done today?

445
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,594
Just tell me the first thing
you did

446
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,396
when you got out
of bed this morning.

447
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,099
Well, I meant to get up
really early,

448
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,835
but I was still the last nap
and I had to fill the dishwasher

449
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,803
'cause I was last downstairs,
which was a rip-off

450
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,139
'cause I didn't get
anything to eat.

451
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,441
And then what happened?

452
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,877
I jumped in the shower,
got dressed.

453
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,446
Captain was crying
so I had to take her out.

454
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,914
She's my dog.

455
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,282
We went to the park,

456
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,384
climbed the fence
for a shortcut.

457
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,553
Anything happen in the park?

458
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,623
Captain was acting strange,
she kept running ahead

459
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,525
and then got into
the herb garden

460
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,694
and then she started
digging like mad.

00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,970
but I got more into the song,
"Romeo and Juliet."

485
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,272
It's a good song.
The guy who wrote that song

486
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,207
is a songwriting deity.

487
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,176
Did he write any other
tunes as good?

488
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,578
One, one and a half.

489
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,414
So, then how can you proclaim
him a deus?

490
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,251
A man needs only write
one genius song,

491
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:43,254
one song that lives forever
in the hearts of the populous

492
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,456
to make him forever divine.

493
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,691
Well, it should be
easy then.

494
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,159
It's not easy.

495
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,693
Many women and men have lived
empty, wasted lives in attics

496
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,766
trying to write
classic pop songs.

497
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,335
What they don't realize is
it's not for them to decide.

498
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,538
It's God.
Or, the god of music.

499
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,608
Or, the part of God that
concerns Himself with music.

500
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,244
That's why the hit maker
has to be considered part divine

501
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,445
because the divine
spoke through them.

502
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,451
Preposterous notion.

503

get in here?

00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,952

your inhaler.

978
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,254

your room keys?

go through my stuff.

983

No way, brother.

984
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:23,099
We might even
cook you dinner.

985
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,433
What's the song like?

986
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,202
A little bit Osmonds,
little bit Bowie.

987
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:27,970
Oh, oye, no.

988
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,472
Hey, I love him.

989
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:30,973
I'm going through
a real phase with him.

990

Don't you think it's stupid
just to give yourself a name

01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:39,728
just because
you sing songs?

What, so the Beatles
were stupid?

1046

Well, they were
kind of stupid

if they actually
stopped to think about it.

I--I'm a lifeguard,

I work at a pool

ourselves a name.

What, like the Lifeboys
or something?

Look, I just don't want
to have a name conversation.

It's a Saturday,
right now all over this town

are having name conversations.

Goths, psychobillies,

1059
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,724
indie kids, rockers,
and just general knobheads

1060
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,261
are just sitting there arguing
about what to call themselves.

1061
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,430
I think you
just hate people.

1062
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:16,966
I don't mind people.

1063
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:17,266
I just can't stand
collective idiocy.

1064
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,339
Maybe we should
have a name

1065
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,441
that means something
really dirty

1066
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:26,642
but nobody knows
what it means,

1067
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:28,344
like Pearl Jam
or something.

1068
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:29,912
What--what does
Pearl Jam mean?

1069
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:33,182
Well, it's like,
you know, it's like spunk.

1070
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:35,150
-What?
-Like jizz.

-Ew.
-What, how is that?

1073
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,225
Because that's
like the average amount

1074
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:43,559
that a man ejaculates,
ten ccs, yeah.

No.

What, when you
were so mental

1527
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,046
you couldn't even
get dressed properly?

1528

Maybe.

1529

Maybe I didn't
fancy you then.

1530
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:14,328

I wanna tell you
something else.

1534
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,561
At the start of the summer,
just before I left the hospital,

1535
01:32:53,468 --> 01:32:56,937
this woman came
to cut hair,

1536
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:58,338
and when it was my turn,

1537
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:00,040
out of the blue she just
started talking to me

1538
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,241
and telling me that she healed
people while she cut their hair.

1539
01:33:05,013 --> 01:33:07,915
You didn't think
she was just some nut?

No, she...

1546

she told me to lie down.

1547
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:27,034
She had this
massage couch.

1548

She put a blanket over me

practiced Christian healing.

1550
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:37,511
And I said, "What if you don't
believe in Jesus?"

1551
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:43,684
She said it would

Well, I know he was a man,

I just don't know how much
of the story to believe.

1556
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:54,862
So, anyway, I shut my eyes,
and I imagined the desert,

1557
01:33:58,766 --> 01:33:59,500
you know, like a Christmas card
with camels in.

1558
01:34:02,937 --> 01:34:04,605
And then I thought,

1559
01:34:04,606 --> 01:34:06,273
"What if the woman's hands were
his hands, would that help me?"

1560
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:12,846
And nothing happened.

1561
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:15,215
But then...

1562
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:17,017
my eyes were tight shut,
but I--

1563
01:34:17,018 --> 01:34:18,519
I know this sounds stupid,

1564
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:22,289
but I felt like there was
a man standing over me.

1565
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,624
And I was too scared to open
my eyes up, I couldn't move.

1566
01:34:27,095 --> 01:34:28,662
It was a strange moment,

1567
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:29,663
but it was like I knew that
this was my chance, like,

1568
01:34:33,368 --> 01:34:36,570
like I could decide
my own fate.

1569
01:34:36,571 --> 01:34:37,037
So I started
saying to myself,

1570
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,876
"I want to be better.

1571
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:44,344
I want to be well.

1572
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:47,314
I want to be better,
I want to be well."

1573
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:50,617
Over and over.

1574
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:52,719
And I suppose
that was a prayer.

1575
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,087
After, did you feel any better?

1576
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:58,792
I mean, a few days later
I started feeling much worse.

1577
01:35:02,764 --> 01:35:04,698
You know, seriously panicking,
paralyzed in bed.

1578
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:08,602
What about now?

1579
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:11,872
I feel...

1580
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:17,044
different.

1581
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:17,544
It's like she sort of
cleaned me out or something.

1582
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:21,815
Um, do you think you'll
still play the show?

1583
01:35:25,153 --> 01:35:25,719
Yeah, I will.

1584
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:31,158
Just don't...

1585
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:31,692
don't tell Cass I'm leaving,
okay, just not yet.

1586
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:36,863
Okay.

1587
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:40,133
It was that sort of scrubby,
huge Jiffy bag on reception.

1588
01:35:40,134 --> 01:35:41,602
opened it, what did
we find in there?

1589
01:35:41,603 --> 01:35:42,869
The world's last cassette.

1590
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,371
The world's last cassette.

1591
01:35:44,372 --> 01:35:46,707
We had to roam the streets
looking for an old car

1592
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:48,809
and break into it with
a wire coat hanger,

1593
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:50,344
and play the cassette
in the car,

1594
01:35:50,345 --> 01:35:51,345
and then we got arrested.

1595
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:52,913
Which means
even if I could,

1596
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:56,483
I can't get along to
the old school house
