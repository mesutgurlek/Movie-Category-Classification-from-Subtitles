1
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,852
 A City of Dreams,

2
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,464
you can't find this on any world map,

3
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:07,552
because this only is in my dreams,

4
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,815
and this is the wonderful bar of my city,

5
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:14,015
RK bar,

6
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,653
I used to drink English whisky

7
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:19,013
whenever I have money.

8
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,141
It makes me feel good,

9
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,071
by the way, I am Gulab

10
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,999
you have never seen a woman like me,
anywhere,

11
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,894
who sells false love each night,

12
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:34,545
but narrates a true love story

13
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:38,375
this story which I'm about to tell you,
is not of any normal man,

14
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,622
It's a story of an Angel!

15
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:42,145
dirty jeans,

16
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:43,513
A guitar in his hand,
wearing a cap,

17
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:45,713
A Rock Star Angel!

18
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,195
I met him here first time,
at this bar,

19
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,767
like everyday, I was the
last customer of the bar,

20
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,127
give me one more glass of whisky

21
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,619
give me one glass of  milk, please!

22
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,336
who is this guy asking for milk in the bar!

23
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:07,937
I'm the lead singer of this bar,

24
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:11,074
tomorrow is my first show,
so I'm here to practice,

25
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,009
but you can't sing lullaby here,

26
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,280
Here, only songs that
touch your body will work

27
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,584
a song is that which touches your soul,
not your body!

28
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,053
Soul!

29
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,548
a thing what you can't see?

30
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:32,204
like this matchstick, which has fire
but can't be lit until scratched,

31
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:37,439
or like whisky, contains intoxication,
but can't be seen,

32
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,044
wow, your words are indeed powerful!

33
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,750
Will I become a star?
- You'll become a super star!!

34
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,975
then you must listen to my song,

35
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:49,405
I'll just hear two lines,
come on sing!

36
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,208
what a guy he was,

37
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,110
like one in every girls dream!

38
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,014
that night, his song became
his identity for me,

39
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,214
Saawariya!

40
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,457
his voice was running all over my body,
the whole night,

41
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:43,026
when I think about him,

42
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:44,794
he makes me happy!

43
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,563
one night I was sitting in my area,

44
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,228
and was counting my earnings!

45
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,351
Hey, get your ball!

46
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
this is my ball!

47
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:57,840
Good evening!

48
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,808
you know what

49
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:02,562
I don't' have a pillow,
So, I sleep on it as a pillow.

50
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:07,116
But it doesn't stay put for long.
Sorry, I'll just pick it up!

51
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:11,498
you're the singer at the RK bar,

52
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,105
yes,

53
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:19,028
that's why I was thinking,
I have seen you somewhere,

54
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:22,065
but why are you sleeping
here on the street?

55
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:24,267
you tell me what should I do?

56
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,568
First, this city is new to me,

57
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:27,203
also my job,

58
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:28,638
and I don't know anybody here,

59
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,506
so no reason to be in anyone's home,

60
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:31,841
or trust a stranger,

61
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,543
the world is not like that,

62
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,378
In short, you don't
have place to live

63
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:37,578
correct!

64
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,650
You have come to the right place.

65
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,884
look up there...

66
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,084
that's my house!

67
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,656
What you say, partner?

68
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:48,896
Shall we try it tonight?

69
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,054
Thank you, but maybe some other time,

70
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,279
I like you,

71
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:59,525
you are the first one,
who refused to Gulab ji!

72
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,604
you are so gorgeous,

73
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:06,089
and the gorgeous like you,
don't sleep in street.

74
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,759
Lillian lives there.

75
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,280
An arrogant old woman!

76
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,582
If she likes you,
she'll make you a tenant,

77
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,901
if not, then Chicken Tandoori...

78
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,854
you can try you luck,
tomorrow morning!

79
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,054
Thank you!

80
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,326
Are you able to live here?

81
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,861
this is our area,

82
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,061
of Prostitutes,

83
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,232
why won't I be able to live here?

84
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:34,192
Gulab ji, they are someone's sister,
mother, or daughter,

85
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,122
but not anyone's wife,

86
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,771
but can be someone's friend,

87
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,612
what do you say?

88
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,147
can you be my friend?

89
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:45,515
you want to make me friend!

90
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,715
ok, we are friends.

91
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,158
I feel very sad, whenever
I heard Razia's baby cry,

92
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,358
I don't like it,

93
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,627
she cries this much every day,

94
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,560
her mother went to business,

95
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,363
she won't be here all night,

96
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,641
our business is quite tough,

97
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,742
and life is the same,

98
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:16,546
Our all childhood went this way,

99
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,281
crying without mother,
whole night,

100
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:22,646
or else waiting whole night
for the fairy to come,

101
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,137
not a single fairy came,
and no one make us quiet,

102
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,879
you go to sleep!

103
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,127
Lillian Ji!

104
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,681
Who is it?
Me!

105
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:53,416
Who are you?

106
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,718
actually, I've heard that you have
a vacant room,

107
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,918
but who are you?

108
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,388
Ranbheer Raj!

109
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,790
but you can call me Raj!

110
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,224
what's your father's name?

111
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,909
Did you lose him in gambling while drunk?

112
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,463
no, I don't gamble,

113
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,265
and I swear I don't drink!

114
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:11,167
you have any reference?

115
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,835
no reference,

116
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,203
actually, I'm new to this city!

117
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:16,439
sorry, I can't give it anyone
without reference,

118
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
get out!

119
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,351
I have one reference!

120
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:31,187
what you say?

121
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:34,490
I have one reference.
Who?

122
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,624
You.
me?

123
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:40,840
Whatever anyone says about me,
good or bad,

124
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,564
you are the one to decide,

125
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,202
my reference is your heart,

126
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,411
is it ok?

127
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,436
do you do something
or do you just talk?

128
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,032
nothing but music,

129
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,282
piano is quite out of tune,

130
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,085
how many keys are there in a piano?

131
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,353
eighty eight (88)

132
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:06,188
and how many strings in violin,

133
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:07,656
four,

134
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:11,462
If you add the string of your heart,
then it's five,

135
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,562
what will you give as a deposit,

136
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:15,197
I'll give myself!
And rent?

137
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,465
Until I can't give,

138
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,267
I'll do everything you say,

139
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,703
you know anything else
besides music?

140
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:21,670
yes,

141
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,305
I see dreams, I write thoughts!
and I try to spread happiness all over,

142
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,308
and sometimes, I need to sleep,
and have bread and water,

143
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,793
If you say, I can even repair this piano.
- No.

144
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,853
What about the room?

145
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:43,926
If I'll give you room, then I too sleep
after eating bread and water!

146
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,502
Can I ask you one thing?
What?

147
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:49,080
when did you smile last time?

148
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,368
- It's none of your business.

149
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:55,755
When did the last time
you called someone yours?

150
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,105
When did you love
anyone last the time?

151
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:02,454
When did you hug someone last time?

152
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,198
I hugged him,
Vincent

153
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,119
I told him

154
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,396
please don't go in Army!

155
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,557
but he went there,

156
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:17,005
37 years, he's been away!

157
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,399
you are alone for last 37 years,

158
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,504
you don't smile, don't love anyone,
don't hug anyone,

159
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,594
It's ok if you don't give me room,

160
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,176
but I want to give you something,

161
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:36,501
What you want to give me?

162
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,543
I want to hug you, Lollipop!

163
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,218
Oh Rascal,

164
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,798
he uses to call me Lollipop!

165
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,628
you want to be hugged Lilly?

166
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,496
that night Lillian
found her lost son,

167
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,665
unmelodious piano, got melody,

168
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:32,864
and women like me got
a good friend,

169
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:37,484
He was everything to us but
there was no one for him.

170
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,508
The only thing he had was fate...

171
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,533
which finally came to my Saawariya one night,

172
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,017
Hello!

173
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:12,308
It's not raining, then
why this umbrella...?

174
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,508
are you crying?

175
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,325
Please Madam, just don't cry,

176
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,315
I feel sad if I see anybody crying...,

177
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,320
you can have umbrella,
no problem,

178
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,371
I'm just so stupid,

179
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,607
Hello,

180
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,078
Hello!

181
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,683
where'd she go?

182
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,553
Madam!

183
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,644
you need any help?

184
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:58,387
no thank you,

185
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:00,756
please just don't follow me,

186
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:01,957
I don't follow you, Madam,

187
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,282
I was trying to help you,

188
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:10,332
If you need any help, do call me.
I'm seated in that cafe. Okay?

189
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:12,532
Ok!

190
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,356
excuse me!

191
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:56,556
can I drop you home?

192
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,026
no thanks,

193
00:22:58,226 --> 00:22:59,828
I don't know you,

194
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,363
I don't know you either,

195
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:04,032
but it has become my responsibility to
drop you to your home,

196
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,200
Madam, who knows,

197
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,102
that trouble may come once again,

198
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,805
you don't have to trouble for me,

199
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:11,673
I'll go myself,

200
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,208
what trouble?

201
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,344
It would be my honor
to drop you,

202
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:17,544
no thank you very much,

203
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,791
hey listen!

204
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,295
hope you aren't thinking me
as that drunk man,

205
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,740
yes, I thought you were,

206
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,400
when you stopped at
bridge looking to me,

207
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,968
no Madam,
you are totally wrong!

208
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,837
when I saw you alone
at the bridge I thought,

209
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:42,938
what?

210
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:45,072
what'd you think of me?

211
00:23:45,272 --> 00:23:47,671
that I was also a prostitute?

212
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,914
no Madam, you are wrong again,

213
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:56,464
I didn't think of you,
in that manner,

214
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,587
you were crying,

215
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:02,055
and it looked to me
like you needed help

216
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,207
and you do...

217
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,371
come on,
I'll drop you to your home,

218
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,463
but still one thing remaining,

219
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:44,132
you didn't tell me,
why were you crying!

220
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:46,332
I live nearby!

221
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,503
that's why you were crying,

222
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:51,139
I also live nearby,
but I don't cry,

223
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,974
I must admit,
you are too funny!

224
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,412
look, there's no path
without potholes,

225
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:02,809
and no life without grief,

226
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,380
Why are you lying at my feet?

227
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,684
oh, you dropped your anklets!

228
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,796
your anklet is too much,

229
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,749
you look so pretty,
when you smile,

230
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,454
then why you were crying,

231
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,677
by the way, sadness
also suits you,

232
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,421
you know what,

233
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:15,596
grief, it's quite dangerous,
I know,

234
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,226
It's comes in everyone's life,

235
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:22,164
but don't worry, I have a remedy
to fight it with,

236
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:23,865
it's a secret,

237
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,530
suppose, life is like boxing,

238
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,304
and grief is your opponent,

239
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,355
it's got a thousand hands,

240
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,617
but you have only two!

241
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,044
don't be afraid,
whenever it comes in your way!

242
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:38,662
look deep into it's eye

243
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,204
recognize it's strength,

244
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:46,169
and then,

245
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,706
Ladies and Gentlemen,

246
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:50,826
welcome to the fight of the century!

247
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,994
in one corner is a beautiful
young lady,

248
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,931
and in the other is unhappiness,
and the crowd goes mad,

249
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,133
but don't forget one thing,

250
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,478
that grief is a very strong opponent,

251
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,355
let's fight

252
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,096
it will first attack your face,

253
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,015
it'll hurt you,

254
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:14,983
no worries,

255
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:16,384
keep fighting,

256
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:18,119
it'll attack once more,

257
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:18,887
and you'll fall down,

258
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,122
but you got to stand up,
and fix it,

259
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:24,178
because if you lose
in the third round,

260
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,094
then every punch, grief will
fill tears in your eyes,

261
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:27,796
and every jab, it can
snatch your smile,

262
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,464
and in the fifth round,
it'll get into your house,

263
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,966
and then snatch
your family's' happiness,

264
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,400
and in the sixth round,
everything,

265
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,835
everything what you want most,

266
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:35,804
it'll finish it up,
it's going to knock you out!

267
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:37,706
and the winner is unhappiness,

268
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,906
yeah,
yes!

269
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,932
there's still remaining sadness
in your smile,

270
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:07,312
by the way, happiness
suits you too,

271
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,207
this is my home!

272
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:48,376
you home is quite beautiful,

273
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:52,113
don't you think that your home
came quite early,

274
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:56,003
I wish your home
should be a little farther,

275
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:01,057
I wish we can be together,
for a while more,

276
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,203
I wish this rain wouldn't stop,

277
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:21,252
and I wish we keep standing together,
under this umbrella while it's not raining,

278
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:31,953
Ranbheer Raj!

279
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:34,153
you can call me Raj!

280
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,341
and what's your name?

281
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,037
one second,

282
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:51,237
just wait there!

283
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,309
what is your problem?

284
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:55,577
we are friends now,

285
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:57,612
still you don't want to tell me
your name!

286
00:29:57,812 --> 00:29:58,446
no!

287
00:29:58,646 --> 00:30:01,616
you rejected this hand five times,
in today's meeting,

288
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:07,766
If I tell you your name in next five seconds,
you must shake this hand,

289
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,458
or else you won't find this Raj anymore

290
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:12,658
One!

291
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,478
Two!

292
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,383
Sakina!

293
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:24,018
it's midnight, come on, get in,

294
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,423
you are Sakina!

295
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:33,181
you'll be beaten, besides sweets on Eid day,
if your grandmother wakes up,

296
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:34,416
come inside hurry!

297
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:36,616
yes, I'm just coming,

298
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,968
we'll meet tomorrow,

299
00:30:55,168 --> 00:30:57,152
tomorrow!

300
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,541
who knows what will happen tomorrow,

301
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:00,809
what will happen!

302
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:04,125
It'll be Eid day,
if the moon appears,

303
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:06,295
or else you wait.

304
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,267
Goodbye!

305
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,389
Sakina!

306
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,459
Sakina!

307
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,232
Sakina!

308
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:51,899
I was waiting for you the whole night, and
you drop in by window and sleep on the piano.

309
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:53,234
you idiot, you are in love.

310
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:55,434
what?

311
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,146
so finally God has mercy on you.

312
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:07,346
full with mercy.

313
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,933
what is her name?

314
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,302
Sakina..
Sakina!

315
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,884
how does she look?
She is Beautiful.

316
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,343
she is girl or orchestra party?

317
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,344
when I am going to meet her?

318
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:41,582
I will meet her today, and will tell her
how I feel and tomorrow you can meet

319
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,907
you don't have any issue?

320
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:48,400
if it were Vincent, would I have
any issue?

321
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:54,593
you won't leave me after getting married?

322
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,288
if it were Vincent, would he leave?

323
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,150
he has left!

324
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,679
but this Raj will never leave you.

325
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,338
what is this?
- Leave application.

326
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,256
tonight I won't be able to sing.

327
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:56,023
why?

328
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:58,191
you won't sing?

329
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:02,693
Sir, someone is waiting for me,
and I must meet her.

330
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,834
And what about all those people who
are waiting for you to sing?

331
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,904
don't worry, I will apologize
to them personally.

332
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:12,673
but today my heart is not in
control.

333
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,913
that's why I am leaving.

334
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:22,507
tonight you will sing 'til these
people want to hear you.

335
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:41,383
So the magic has climbed upon your head!!
if tonight you won't sing, you are out.

336
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:53,987
you are in a hurry Saawariya,
Sakina is lucky to have a lover like you

337
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,859
you know her Gulab ji?

338
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:03,701
I am street queen, take one step and
I can tell the whole journey.

339
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:09,510
this is the path of love,
beware.

340
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:20,423
and listen, don't fall too much,
or someday you'll hate yourself

341
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,687
wow, Gulab ji...

342
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,459
fool.
so you want to leave this job?

343
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:38,975
I want something else, and I can
leave life for her.

344
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:49,178
but you won't get this chance again.

345
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,308
Sakina...!

346
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:36,589
what's the problem?
ok bye, I am going!

347
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
how...!

348
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:05,452
I have seen you after long time,
so where were you going that late?

349
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:10,267
Badi Ammi will get worried,
it's not good.

350
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:17,171
it was raining in the morning, and
because of Eid preparation I have to.

351
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:26,576
see everything come together this year,
Friday, Eid and rain.

352
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,817
and our friendship too.

353
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,273
you know him?

354
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:35,533
no. Khala Jaan, he seems a stranger.

355
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
stranger?

356
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:42,162
Oh God, two ladies can't even talk
in person.

357
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,729
you're stupid, listening our conversation.

358
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:53,299
see I told you it's not good,
lets go, we will go somewhere else

359
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,683
listen,
will you listen to me Raj?

360
00:42:13,883 --> 00:42:19,633
Ranbheer Raj ok? my name is stranger
and also known as stupid.

361
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,739
forgive me Ranbheer Raj,
you take me wrong.

362
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:31,280
if you didn't like me, you should have
told me, I would forget about you

363
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:39,037
if I talked to you, Khala Jan would inform
at home and I won't be allowed to go out.

364
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,208
and our friendship would end
in one night.

365
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:46,180
friendship... you don't even know the
meaning of friendship.

366
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,582
and I called you by your name too.

367
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:49,450
and I heard...

368
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,451
yeah still left.

369
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:59,942
I though what would you think,
in only one night this girl stopped.

370
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:14,557
madam, for you its easy to forget last
night, not for me.

371
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:23,793
you have changed in one night, last
night we were friends and now strangers?

372
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:30,968
it would better if I would wait for
the moon, not you.

373
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:43,784
oh. God, you speak so sweet.

374
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:58,631
listen Raj,
shop is closed come in the morning.

375
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,790
I am telling,
I am a very dangerous man,

376
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,458
ok.. ok..
forgive me.

377
00:44:04,658 --> 00:44:05,793
not like this.

378
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:09,435
you didn't forgive me but I did.

379
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,254
hey listen...!

380
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,926
shop has closed.

381
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:36,839
what?
now don't start laughing...

382
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:47,617
what are you doing, leave me...

383
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,336
I am stupid...

384
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:52,353
see I don't like this, leave me.

385
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,424
I am a wanderer!

386
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,460
and wild too..

387
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,533
forgive me.

388
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,836
And a fool as well.

389
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,061
where are you taking me?

390
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,599
what is this place?

391
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:45,105
When I am happy, I come here...
And even when I'm sad, I come here!!

392
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,053
"Subhanallah"

393
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:02,860
How beautiful the world appears from here.

394
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,690
- But, not more than you!

395
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,635
what are you doing?
leave me.

396
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,086
I was just kidding.

397
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:40,323
you scared me..
don't do this again.

398
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,520
last night I was thinking about you.

399
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,440
you were also thinking about me?

400
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:53,260
why would I think about you,
I don't even know you.

401
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,478
you know my name! I work as lead
singer in RK bar

402
00:46:58,678 --> 00:47:06,073
Lillian is my only family, I am her paying
guest, come with me, I will show you my place

403
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,965
I have told you everything
about me, now it's your turn.

404
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:22,670
name and address you know already. work,
making carpet, Badi Ammi is only family.

405
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,591
and Chunri Aapa is for taking care
of.

406
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:26,791
what about parents?

407
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:35,546
Badi Ammi says Dad left, no one knows
where.

408
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:46,524
and mom was waiting for him
her whole life.

409
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,670
that's it.

410
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:04,045
you know, when God takes everything
from us, he must send someone for us.

411
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,301
just like Lollipop..
and Badi Ammi for me.

412
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:09,544
no.. Raj!

413
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:12,687
crazy...!

414
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:19,328
tell me one thing,
does Badi Ammi love you?

415
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:25,231
yeah.. but she is strict, even ties
me with safety pin.

416
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:32,165
safety pin, who ties with a safety pin,
you are telling me story.

417
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:37,931
Badi Ammi can't see well, she is
afraid I will leave her like my parents

418
00:48:38,131 --> 00:48:40,131
that's why she ties me.

419
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:45,181
if she ties you then what are
you doing here this late?

420
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:50,200
you fool, I came here and ties
someone else instead of me.

421
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:59,032
that means Badi Ammi is not strict,
but you are mischievous

422
00:48:59,232 --> 00:49:01,136
lets have coffee.
no...

423
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,133
what happened?

424
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:08,612
Raj I can't go with you.
Why?

425
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:12,478
I have to go to the bridge.
Bridge?

426
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,468
I am waiting for someone.

427
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:16,236
who Sakina?

428
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:19,184
someone special.

429
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,016
special!
Who?

430
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,721
The one whom I love dearly!

431
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,830
whats happening, why you are silent?

432
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,207
nothing...
Can I know his name?

433
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:46,844
no... calling a lover's name
lessen the years of his life.

434
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:50,022
But, you could tell me by writing

435
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,994
Raj!

436
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:06,600
no Raj, its Iman. oh God, forget his
name.. you are so stupid.

437
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:17,545
we were so poor, even our
house was put for rent.

438
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:27,549
I remember that night everybody was
sleeping, and there was knock.

439
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:36,698
Badi Ammi someone is at the door,
must be paying guest.

440
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,327
Greetings...

442
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,671
Sakina, how this guest looks like?

443
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,221

445
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:11,011

449
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,970

450
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,039
Badi Ammi... you just leave him..

451
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,785
Sakina, give him receipt and take
rent.

452
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,121

breakfast only one time a day.

454

Yeah go..!

455

456
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:09,074
You are here or gone?
Move.

457
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:16,089

458
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,922

459
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:53,823

460
00:53:56,233 --> 00:54:06,666

461
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:18,350

462
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,958

queen, and his attractive voice.

464
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:41,907
now queen has lost her peace
day and night.

465
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,699
where did king come from in this
story?

466
00:54:45,899 --> 00:54:49,236
he wasn't in there?
yeah, that's what I was thinking.

467
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:53,652
Who she is talking to?

468
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:59,929
I was dreaming with open eyes,
falling in love like hell.

469
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,817
I hadn't see him since many days.

470
00:55:04,017 --> 00:55:05,943
and then one night.

471
00:55:06,143 --> 00:55:08,068
across all limits.

472
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,371
I went to his room.

473
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,858

Just to meet you.

Tell me what you
think about it?

496
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:30,363
For what?

497
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:31,998
Sakina child.

498
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,198
You won't tell her.

499
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,668
Now what you forget.

500
00:57:36,868 --> 00:57:39,906
Nothing much its a
little story Mrs. Nabbo.

501
00:57:40,106 --> 00:57:42,575
Which function made at lake side.

502
00:57:42,775 --> 00:57:44,611
There is a premier of Mughl-e-Azam.

503
00:57:44,811 --> 00:57:46,646
I think that will you
come with us.

504
00:57:46,846 --> 00:57:47,647
Will you come?

505
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:52,947
We don't go anywhere, but if you
force us then we shall come.

506
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,022
You must go but how
you see there?

507
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,602
Naughty.
What we need to see.

508
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,642
I just listen.
How fear when you fall in love.

509
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:09,035
Falling in love is not a
wrong thing.

510
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,650
Then why live like this.

511
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,946
For God Sake, your owner.

512
00:59:15,146 --> 00:59:17,118
Don't make her alone.

513
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:38,866
God being started to make
story of our love but.

514
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,576
The words are end.

515
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,031
Second day Jhoomri sister tells me.

516
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:47,951
That he leave our house forever.

517
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:47,908
Stop crying.

518
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,045
Lets clean your tears.

519
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,810
I would take you with me.

520
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,321
Here.

521
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,577
But I can't take you with me.

522
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,671
I am doing work for death.

523
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,250
and where I am going,

524
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,830
There's danger every moment.

525
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:16,071
And every relation is weakness.

526
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:19,086
I want to make you my power.

527
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,744
But you want to be my weakness.

528
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,682
Sakina...

529
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,560
O Sakina..

530
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,736
I miss you so much.

531
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,590
When I read any book.

532
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,711
I miss you.

533
01:01:39,911 --> 01:01:41,861
When anyone is crying

534
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,284
I miss you.

535
01:01:44,484 --> 01:01:47,336
And when anyone will stop
laughing.

536
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:49,497
And laughing in crying.

537
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,158
I miss you.

538
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:54,127
O Sakina.

539
01:01:54,327 --> 01:01:56,327
Where are you?

540
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,523
And that night he promised me.

541
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,165
Next year on night of Eid.

542
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,995
He will meet me before
moon's dawn.

543
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,576
Just I am waiting for him.

544
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,679
And for Eid's moon.

545
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:33,199
What is this?

546
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:35,399
My face showing gift.

547
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:40,282
He was given me that night.

548
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,725
This is a useless coin.

549
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,747
And your story is false.

550
01:02:47,947 --> 01:02:50,083
Its not a story.
Its truth, Raj.

551
01:02:50,283 --> 01:02:52,225
I can't trust Sakina.

552
01:02:52,425 --> 01:02:53,686
You want to tell me that.

553
01:02:53,886 --> 01:02:57,857
You love's a man like this who
comes like a rain one night.

554
01:02:58,057 --> 01:03:00,097
And then lost in clouds.

555
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:03,168
Do you know what he does?

556
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,330
Where he lives?

557
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,898
I don't know.

558
01:03:06,098 --> 01:03:07,133
House, home he have anything?

559
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:08,635
I don't know anything.

560
01:03:08,835 --> 01:03:11,235
You won't know where he goes?

561
01:03:11,435 --> 01:03:13,506
How these questions
belong to my love?

562
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,341
Sakina, its related.

563
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,344
Because if he is homeless then
how he will make your home?

564
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,179
Does he write any letter to you?

565
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,379
Make home.

566
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:27,680
And this coin have one side, wait.
And one side, alone life.

567
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,232
Your face showing is false.

568
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:41,044
How's my luck today without
crack body coin comes.

569
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,450
Listen, its my coin.

570
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:44,971
But I got it in the way.

571
01:03:45,171 --> 01:03:47,171
Please, my coin.

572
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:51,818
But your name is not written on it.

573
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,614
Look, I don't want to speak
like you women.

574
01:03:54,814 --> 01:03:56,765
Give me my coin.

575
01:03:56,965 --> 01:04:00,995
Why are people like you scared
to speak our name?

576
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,404
Ok, What's your name?

577
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:08,227
Don't ask for name to Mrs. Gulab,
ask about price.

578
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:12,108
Mrs. Gulab give back her coin.

579
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:13,733
Do you know her.

580
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,933
We are neighbors.

581
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,385
Am I right, Beloved?

582
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,873
Stop joking give the coin back.

583
01:04:21,073 --> 01:04:23,509
I will give back the soul to God.

584
01:04:23,709 --> 01:04:25,709
What is this coin.
Take.

585
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,797
Why you do this?

586
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:35,230
Let her go. He have to see
that how you love her.

587
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:38,257
Its just a little meeting
of last night.

588
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:42,027
And you wrote her name
on stones and walls.

589
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:47,400
She has to know these stones are
costly in love between money.

590
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,576
Raj.

591
01:04:49,776 --> 01:04:51,752
come here, Raj.

592
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,948
What's up Sakina?
you tell me that he won't come.

593
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,851
Look, he wrote my
name on stones.

594
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:06,419
That means he comes back.

595
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:08,744
That means he comes back.

596
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:13,426
If he comes, then why
shouldn't he meet you?

597
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:15,921
He wants to check our love.

598
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,531
Its possible he is hiding here.

599
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:20,399
And watching us.

600
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:22,558
How I love him.

601
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:24,717
How I love.

602
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,394
Look at it carefully.

603
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:38,091
It has one side Promise
and second side Trust.

604
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,467
And look Raj.

605
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:42,836
He will do his promise.

606
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,390
Look, I was right
he will come.

607
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,966
And take me away from here.

608
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:52,098
Sakina go from
here while you can.

609
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:55,053
I am already a
heart patient.

610
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,351
You gone mad.

611
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:16,556
can I say something?

612
01:06:16,756 --> 01:06:18,682
Tell.

613
01:06:18,882 --> 01:06:20,807
I am very.

614
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:26,876
It's raining, I swear
hard to go home.

615
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:29,383
Why lady.

616
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:45,883
Brother, do you think
that rain will stop?

617
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,624
Raj, are you my best friend?

618
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,248
Yes.

619
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,338
Then you tell me what I
have to do?

620
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,453
Do for what?

621
01:07:20,653 --> 01:07:22,653
About Iman.

622
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:26,826
You can't speak her name nor
ask also but you can write.

623
01:07:27,026 --> 01:07:28,728
You mean letter?

624
01:07:28,928 --> 01:07:30,846
Why write a letter.

625
01:07:31,046 --> 01:07:32,984
There is no side effect?

626
01:07:33,184 --> 01:07:37,075
He don't think that I want
to show him my love.

627
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,307
Waiting all night and
crying to every word.

628
01:07:41,507 --> 01:07:44,944
Its better then that you
take the first step.

629
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,144
I will try if you say.

630
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,197
Yes.

631
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:53,052
Ok, tell me if you were,
what you wrote?

632
01:07:53,252 --> 01:07:54,020
Damn.

633
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,688
I too.
You.

634
01:07:55,888 --> 01:07:57,888
Yes, me.
Lets begin.

635
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:02,795
I will write that you fool Iman
It's no need to come back now.

636
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:07,075
I am falling in love with
a boy who is named Raj.

637
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,868
Seen you stop me
at first time.

638
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:15,238
We can begin it like this.

639
01:08:15,438 --> 01:08:18,325
Since when I see you
just like hope.

640
01:08:18,525 --> 01:08:20,446
I want to write it.

641
01:08:20,646 --> 01:08:23,859
Ok then I have write
that you want too.

642
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:26,585
Now write some bad words.

643
01:08:26,785 --> 01:08:28,287
Did he mind it?

644
01:08:28,487 --> 01:08:31,190
If you give him inside
your heart then not.

645
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,390
With trust.

646
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:43,382
I have told you just one word.
But you can't do this.

647
01:11:43,582 --> 01:11:45,821
You call yourself a friend.

648
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:47,319
Why you worry Sakina?

649
01:11:47,519 --> 01:11:49,488
I have the whole letter in my mind.

650
01:11:49,688 --> 01:11:51,857
yesterday I will give you in
written a good hand writing.

651
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:53,592
And then you will post it.

652
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,792
Liar, you are a liar.

653
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,831
If that is a last night of our
friendship Raj.

654
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:02,985
And when I go back with him.
Then you'll get too much sorrow.

655
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:05,735
Thank you,
think about my pain.

656
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,608
I was listening to your story
from last 2 nights.

657
01:12:09,808 --> 01:12:10,676
Why Raj.

658
01:12:10,876 --> 01:12:12,478
Do you have some pain inside.

659
01:12:12,678 --> 01:12:14,446
Nothing any problem like this.

660
01:12:14,646 --> 01:12:18,498
Yes, but it will be from
tomorrow.

661
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:24,824
Raj, may I give you one problem?

662
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,240
What.

663
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,297
This letter?

664
01:12:33,497 --> 01:12:35,481
I wrote it for him.

665
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:39,805
Sakina if you have a letter
then why you tell to me?

666
01:12:40,005 --> 01:12:43,525
Just to know that
what I wrote is true.

667
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:47,171
But which you think
exactly like this.

668
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,256
Will you send it to Iman.

669
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,587
I know that you
can't tell me no.

670
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:59,815
And yes Jhoomri sister tells me
that he lives in old town.

671
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,267
I know it's so far.

672
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,846
Bring it.

673
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,701
Ok Raj, I have to go now.

674
01:13:08,901 --> 01:13:11,971
If Grandma is awake then
its really a big problem

675
01:13:12,171 --> 01:13:13,872
Goodbye.
Stop, Sakina.

676
01:13:14,072 --> 01:13:14,573
I will leave you there.

677
01:13:14,773 --> 01:13:16,909
I can go.
Just send the letter there.

678
01:13:17,109 --> 01:13:18,110
Ok.

679
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,778
Sakina should we
meet tomorrow?

680
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:22,188
If you get an answer then.

681
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,650
Listen if I can't get the
answer then?

682
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:27,102
Then I give you more problems.

683
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:30,022
And yes don't forget to send it.

684
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,841
And Raj.
What?

685
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:35,561
Nothing.

686
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:37,761
I'll wait for you.

687
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,415
Ok bye.

688
01:13:40,615 --> 01:13:42,582
Ok bye.

689
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,102
That bloody love is
thing like this.

690
01:15:23,302 --> 01:15:27,807
Which converts God in a stone
And an angel to a devil.

691
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:33,661
that night I look a beloved
dies in his eyes.

692
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:37,404
Its just in two nights make it all.

693
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:42,911
But I don't know what's
in the next two nights.
