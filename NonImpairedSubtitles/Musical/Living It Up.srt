1
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,354
There she goes, Homer,
the <i>Super Chief!</i>

2
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,432
Seems she goes much faster
passing Desert Hole.

3
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,073
In exactly 28 seconds,

4
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,839
I'll be climbing aboard
the <i>Eastbound Skyrocket,</i>

5
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,588
following her every inch of the way.

6
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,799
Gee, Mr Jackson, I sure wish
I could go to New York with you.

7
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,593
Now, Homer,
you're gonna be filling my shoes.

8
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,712
- Stationmaster of Desert Hole.
- Yeah.

9
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,033
In exactly 52 years,
you'll be getting your pension.

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,391
Then you'll be on your way to wine,
women and song!

11
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,952
- In 52 years who'll be able to sing?
- There comes the <i>Skyrocket!</i>

12
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,435
- Well, at last I'm on my way.
- All aboard!

13
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,793
You'd better hurry, Mr Jackson,
they hate to wait in this station long.

14
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,196
Broadway, Radio City,
the Yankee Stadium!

15
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,836
Here, son.
Sleep with this under your pillow.

16
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,073
- Thanks. Goodbye, Mr Jackson.
- So long, Homer!

17
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,350
I'll mail you your card
from the Copacabana.

18
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,191
See you in 52 years.

19
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,553
Bye!

20
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,039
That was a short trip.

21
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,956
Hey! Hey, come back, I'm here! Hey!

22
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,478
Hey! Hey, you!

23
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,676
Come back here!

24
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,398
What's your name?

25
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,430
Oh, please work. Please work.

26
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,272
Oh, boy, it works!

27
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,672
Reckless driver!

28
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,548
Radioactive car! Run for your lives!

29
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,033
Hi, mister.
Could I get some water, please?

30
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,435
- Oh, you bet your life. Okay.
- Hey, what's all the commotion

31
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,675
with everybody running away?

32
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,155
Well, I'll be diddly-dad-burnt if I know.

33
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,555
- Everyone rushing around.
- Yeah.

34
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,796
- Say, what kind of a car is this here?
- Oh, that's a...

35
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,110
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, sure. Go right ahead.

36
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,994
- This is... Oh, Radioactive. Four door.
- I never heard of it.

37
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,271
You never heard of a Radioactive?

38
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,198
Cars coming in and out of here
all day long?

39
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,994
I'll never forget the first time
I saw a Radioactive.

40
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,393
- Good morning, Mr Stone.
- Good morning.

41
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,715
- Oliver!
- I'm not interested.

42
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,078
- Oliver, you've got to hear me.
- Get out. I fired you last week.

43
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,476
Do you want me to repeat those words
with all their Anglo-Saxon charm?

44
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,158
Oh, but here's salvation, Oliver.

45
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,998
A shot in the arm
for your dying scandal sheet.

46
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,394
Now, look! "Desert Hole, New Mexico"...

47
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,956
I don't want to listen to you,
you female Svengali.

48
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,318
The Mother Goose stories
that you talked me into printing.

49
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,873
"The Man from the Flying Saucer,"

50
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,355
a midget that you dressed up
in a Buck Rogers outfit.

51
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,835
"The Man on the Ledge," your brother.

52
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,235
You're right, but this poor kid,
Homer Flagg,

53
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,193
his country doctor only gives him
three weeks to live,

54
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,311
radiation poisoning eating away
his bones.

55
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,910
- Your phoney stories, eating away mine.
- But this time I'm going straight.

56
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,349
- Now, look, Desert Hole, New Mexico.
- We covered it.

57
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,835
Covered it! We ain't covered... Oliver!

58
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,479
You covered it!

59
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,310
Six lines on the back page
next to the kidney remedies.

60
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,956
Did you read the last line?

61
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,240
"All I hope is that I can see
New York City before I die."

62
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,478
"All I hope is that I can see
New York City before I die."

63
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,868
That's not the end of the story, Oliver.
That's just the beginning.

64
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,117
- I ought to be shot for what I'm thinking.
- What are you thinking, Oliver?

65
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,470
I'm thinking that
maybe that cynical mind of yours

66
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,592
has hit pay dirt at last.
Maybe you've really learnt your lesson.

67
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,994
You'll never be sorry.

68
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,634
We'll bring that kid to New York
for a last fling at life.

69
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,318
Pay all expenses as long as he lasts.

70
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,478
The <i>New York Morning Chronicle</i>
pays its debt to humanity.

71
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,670
It won't hurt circulation, either.

72
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,836
I knew
your better instincts would triumph.

73
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,428
Well, I'll go to the cashier
and get my expense money.

74
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,953
Wait a minute!

75
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,557
What if this kid doesn't die
in three weeks?

76
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,910
What if he just keeps on living?

77
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,952
Oh, I wouldn't let him do a thing like that
to you, Oliver.

78
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,679
<i>People worry</i>
<i>about the pursuit of happiness</i>

79
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,156

80

Doc. Doc.

99
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,033
- Doc!
- What is it?

100
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,352
Oh, well, I just came
from making out my will.

101
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,749
It didn't take very long, and I...

102
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,711
<i>Love me, love me</i>

103
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,435
Well, this is a fine time to be singing.
I have a good mind to disinherit you.

104
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,879
Stop looking so tragic, Homer.

105
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,197
You're not going to die,
unless you get run over or something.

106
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,356
But you told me
I had something terrible.

107
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,869
And my blood and my tests
and my X-rays.

108
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,913
I know. I checked them over again.
You don't have radiation poisoning.

109
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,032
Look, and your blood count,
well, it got away from me.

110
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,116
I should've paid more attention in class.

111
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,195
What?

112
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,312
- Look, Doc.
- Yeah?

113
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,630
I know you're the best pal I got here
in town.

114
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,638
- That's right.
- Well, I don't want you to spare me.

115
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,557
- I won't.
- I mean, I can take it.

116
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,875
- I know it.
- Let me know the worst.

117
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,560
Homer, don't you think
I'd want you to have radiation poisoning,

118
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,432
just to break up the monotony?

119
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,476
Look, Doc, give it to me straight.
When do I keel over?

120
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,908
Will you listen to me?

121
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,508
You know, you even threw me a curve
on the fluoroscope.

122
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,198
I did?

123
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,432
I was so anxious to get a patient,

124
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,710
I didn't notice
that your radiation had numbers on it.

125
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,991
- 10:27. Exactly.
- Right.

126
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,798
- And you know that car you drove?
- Yeah?

127
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,399
It was sitting in the desert for months.

128
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,990
And believe me, Homer, all you have
is a very slight sinus condition,

129
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,111
which I'll do my best to prolong.

130
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,117
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

131
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,632
- I'm not gonna die?
- No, you're not gonna die.

132
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,711
I'm not gonna die. I'm gonna live.

133
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,233
I'm gonna live!

134
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,679
I'm gonna live?
Oh, no, Doc, you can't do that.

135
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,394
- Easy, Homer. Come on. Here, Homer.
- No, I can't, Doc. I made some plans.

136
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,669
- I can't live.
- Sit down.

137
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,279
- No, I don't want to, Doc.
- Homer.

138
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,836
- Oh, that's not fair, Doc. Gee willikers.
- Here, take some of these pills.

139
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,314
- A sedative.
- No.

140
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,670
It'll knock you out at first,
but then you'll feel great.

141
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,597
- I think that's what it does.
- No, thanks.

142
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,711
What's wrong with you, Homer?
You should be celebrating.

143
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,673
I just saved your life.
First patient I ever did that for.

144
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,349
Well, I don't want to sound ungrateful,
Doc, but you also just spoiled my trip.

145
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,232
- What trip?
- My trip to New York.

146
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,318
I was gonna use the $300 bonus
the railroad gives you for dying

147
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,432
to go to New York and have a good time
and die happy.

148
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,791
Oh, I'm sorry, kid. If it was up to me,
you could have a trip around the world.

149
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,878
What good would that do me?
I'd only wind up back in Desert Hole.

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,878
There's nothing wrong with Desert Hole,
if you like holes in the desert.

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,560
Well, I kind of graduated from it
while I was dying.

152
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,432
Now I have to go back to that station,

153
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,632
working every day
and watching the <i>Super Chief</i> whiz by.

154
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,429
If only once it would go...

155
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,672
But, no, always...

156
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,150
All right, all right, all right.
Steady, Homer, easy. Easy.

157
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,874
Gee whiz, Doc! I'm not ungrateful,

158
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,275
but it is kind of strange
to be brought to life twice,

159
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,595
and both times in Desert Hole.

160
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,314
You probably thought nothing
was wrong with him, either, huh?

161
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,958
- Going straight through, Art?
- Nope, got a passenger for you today.

162
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,117
A... A...

163
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,513
- Desert Hole, New Mexico. Hi, Homer.
- Hi, Mr Moore.

164
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,109
Oh, no. Not even for the Pulitzer Prize.

165
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,355
Just a minute, ma'am.

166
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,948
They all do that the first time,
but you'll get used to it.

167
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,992
That's what I'm afraid of. Oh, well!

168
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,433
All aboard!

169
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,277
Oh, just lead me to the coolest,
driest martini in town.

170
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,277
I'm gonna take off my shoes
and wade in it.

171
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,630
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but we don't have a saloon here.

172
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,591
But maybe I can get Joe Stevens
down at the drugstore

173
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,073
to tap a new keg of sarsaparilla.

174
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,953
Oh, no. No, thank you. I just swore off.

175
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,312
I'm looking for Homer Flagg.

176
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,874
Do you have any idea
where I can find the poor kid?

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,831
I'm the poor kid, ma'am.

178
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,268
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here, give me these bags.

179
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,234
Sit down!

180
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,276
- You mean you're still working?
- Why should I quit?

181
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,072
"Why should I quit?"

182
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,910
Now, there's a headline for you.

183
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,679
Homer, I'm Wally Cook
of the <i>New York Morning Chronicle.</i>

184
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,075
- Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do?

185
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,316
I know it's difficult
for you to talk about it,

186
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,477
but if you could give me
some information.

187
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,830
- Well, it's sort of all over now.
- Oh, never say it's all over, Homer!

188
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,593
Well, I didn't say it, but Doc Harris...

189
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,312
Look, I don't want to hear
about your ailment.

190
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,715
I don't want to hear anything
that isn't gaiety and laughter

191
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,159
as far as you're concerned.

192
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,352
Because, Homer,
I'm taking you to New York.

193
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,111
- New York?
- That's right.

194
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,874
As guest of Oliver Stone,
editor of the <i>Morning Chronicle.</i>

195
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,389
- Now, don't say anything until I tell you...
- Oh, I didn't say anything.

196
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,475
Good.

197
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,830
We're going to lay the whole
cockeyed city at your feet.

198
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,957
The town will take you to its heart.

199
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,759
Everything you've ever wanted,
you'll have on a silver platter.

200
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,108
- Everything?
- Everything.

201
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,673
Could you get the <i>Super Chief</i> to stop

202
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,392
right here at Desert Hole to pick me up?

203
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,193
Homer, Oliver Stone could get
the <i>Queen Mary</i> to stop here.

204
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,673
All of this just because...

205
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,435
Yes, Homer.

206
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,558
That's putting it bluntly,

207
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,719
but I might as well be honest.

208
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,476
You're going all the way to New York

209
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,670
because you've got radiation poisoning.

210
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,156
How far can I go on a sinus condition?

211
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,919
Oh, don't joke, Homer.

212
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,149
It's too serious.

213
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,278
Now, could you show me to a hotel
so I could freshen up?

214
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,119
- Yes, ma'am. There's one right here.
- Oh, I'll take the bag.

215
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,788
I'll take the coat.

216
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,440
- This way, ma'am.
- All right.

217
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,628
Hi, Shane.

218
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,877
Believe me, I'd take you out of this town
if you were my worst enemy.

219
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,357
Have you lived here all your life?

220
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,748
Oh, twice that, ma'am.

221
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,318
Tell me, Miss Cook, when will we go?

222
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,632
Right after I talk to your doctor.

223
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,955
Oh, do you have to?

224
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,670
Our readers like all
the gruesome details.

225
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,597
They're strong enough
to stand the truth.

226
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,789
Yeah, but am I?

227
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,516
Well, here's the hotel, Miss Cook.

228
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,957
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

229
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,075
Doc!

230
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,668
<i>Love me, love me, love me, baby, too</i>

231
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,239
Hey, Doc. Excuse me! Hey, Doc!
Listen, Doc! Doc! Hey, excuse me, Doc.

232
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,239
- Hey, Doc! Hey, Doc, you gotta help me!
- You got an appointment?

233
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,430
No, but listen, Doc, there's
a reporter from New York, see?

234
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,677
And she wants me to go there with her,
all expenses paid, and you know why?

235
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,155
- Because I'm dying.
- You're not gonna die, Homer.

236
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,793
I just made out a new report
to the railroad.

237
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,117
Oh, you can overlook it, can't you, Doc?
It could slip your mind, can't it?

238
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,435
Every doctor makes mistakes,
that's why we have hospitals.

239
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,753
Look, the retainer the railroad gives me
is the only thing that keeps me alive.

240
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,235
- I couldn't do a thing like that.
- Oh, yes, you could!

241
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,950
Because if you don't,
I'll just drop them a little line myself.

242
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,310
What a fine doctor they got,
takes X-rays of Swiss watches.

243
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,555
You'd be fired.

244
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,433
Then I'd tell them about
their new stationmaster,

245
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,070
who's trying to gyp them out of $300.

246
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,269
Then you'd be fired.

247
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,155
Yeah, that's probably
what would happen.

248
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,991
That is, if we both weren't
honourable men.

249
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,588
- But we are, aren't we?
- Sure.

250
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,630
What would it hurt you to tell one
little teeny-weeny white lie?

251
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,068
I'm sorry, Homer.

252
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,669
I may have been last in my class,
but I'm a doctor.

253
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,755
I couldn't hand in a phoney report.
I swore the solemn Hippocratic oath.

254
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,957
"With purity and holiness,
I will pass my life and practise my art."

255
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,793
Yeah, I guess you're right.

256
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,434
I couldn't ask you to go back
on an oath like that.

257
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,316
You don't have to lie.
Just give me something fatal.

258
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,475
Oh, I couldn't do that, not on purpose.

259
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,990
It doesn't necessarily have to be
radiation poisoning.

260
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,190
It could be just anything
you got laying around the office.

261
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,510
- I won't be a party to it.
- Force yourself!

262
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,917
- No!
- Well, then, I'll help myself!

263
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,314
Now, don't touch that stuff, Homer!

264
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,271
I'll touch anything
that'll get me to New York.

265
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,154
A little of this.

266
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,628
Two cc's of that.

267
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,949
A little of this.

268
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,754
Witchcraft!

269
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,313
Splendid! Reaction!

270
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,229
I'll drink it.

271
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,868
I'm going to drink it.

272
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,879
- What was that?
- Congratulations, Homer.

273
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,719
You're gonna have the healthiest baby
that was ever born in this town.

274
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,319
Oh, that's her. That's her, Doc. Please.

275
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,510
Come on, Doc, give me a break,
will you, please?

276
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,834
Come in.

277
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,190
Remember, Hippocratic oath.

278
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,113
Dr Harris?

279
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,229
Yes.

280
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,396
I'm Wally Cook
of the <i>New York Chronicle.</i>

281
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,999
How... How...

282
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,635
How.

283
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,072
Oh, I'm sorry. It's been such a long time
since I've seen a girl,

284
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,558
I mean, a female girl in Desert Hole.

285
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,512
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like some facts about

286
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,869
Homer's ailment.

287
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,672
Miss Cook,
we might as well tell the truth.

288
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,233
You see, about those X-rays...

289
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,237
Oh, Homer, you look pale.

290
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,315
I do?

291
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,759
- You're not well.
- I'm not?

292
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,233
- You better lie down.
- What for?

293
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,112
You just rest and let me do the talking.

294
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,309
Yeah, but...

295
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,909
You wouldn't believe me if I told you
what his pulse was.

296
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,277
Oh, the poor kid.

297
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,318
You know, if you're gonna take him
all the way to New York,

298
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,556
he'd better be under
medical supervision at all times.

299
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,079
Oh, don't you worry.

300
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,151
We'll get him the finest doctors
in the world.

301
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,675
Oh, no, Homer has a strange feeling
that no doctor can do for him what I can.

302
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,152
And it's best not to upset him.
After all, his is a very rare case.

303
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,793
Yeah, Miss Cook, you could search for
years and not find another one like it.

304
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,837
You see, Miss Cook,
it's my duty never to leave his side,

305
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,953
as long as I can be of help
with a little faith, a little knowledge

306
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,472
and a deeply-felt sense
of honour and integrity.

307
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,594
Don't stand there, get a doctor!

308
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,429
Just talked to Oliver, Oliver Stone,
my editor.

309
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,516
He's toe-dancing in the streets,
waiting for us.

310
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,632
Half the town is at La Guardia Airport.

311
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,115
What's that down there? What's that?

312
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,949
Oh, that's little old New York.

313
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,719
If you see a red carpet down there,
Homer, that's for you.

314
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,832
And eight million people
will be weeping and cheering

315
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,393
and buying newspapers.

316
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,953
What a way to make a buck.

317
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,913
Oh, don't feel bad, Miss Cook, because
if your newspaper didn't make money,

318
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,554
I'd have never gotten this trip.

319
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,752
So we're even. I just want to have fun.

320
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,069
Then, have fun, Homer.

321
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,156
From the Battery to the Bronx,
it's all yours.

322
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,952
Take it while you can.

323
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,719
Because in a month from now,
they'll have forgotten all about you.

324
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,599
- Miss Cook, I'd like to ask you a favour.
- Yes, Doctor?

325
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,433
I don't want any so-called specialists
poking at my patient.

326
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,869
I'm not bringing him all the way
to New York just to be a guinea pig.

327
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,514
Yes, 'cause everybody knows what
I got is incurable, so it would just be

328
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,868
a waste of time.

329
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,992
Oh, don't worry.
I'll see you're not bothered.

330
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,829
You know, sailor, all these stories
have to begin the same way.

331
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,840
Now, what do you think of New York?

332
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,952
Oh, I feel as if I lived here all my life.

333
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,029
I feel as if I were coming home.

334
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,316
- Beautiful!
- I'm gonna have fun first.

335
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,518
I am, really I am.

336
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,750
Well, if that doesn't make them cry,
nothing will.

337
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,428
Cry? Why should they cry?

338
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,838
Because you're the bravest, sweetest,
and nicest kid in the whole world.

339
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,669
Miss.

340
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,989
"...I were coming home.

341
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,393
"I feel..."

342
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,474
- What was that?
- 2:00 medicine.

343
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,112
2:00 medicine at 9:00?

344
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,439
You're not supposed
to give me medicine.

345
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,070
You were last in your class.

346
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,118
Just one of his seizures. He's been
going on nerve alone, you know?

347
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,708
Oh, the poor, brave kid.

348
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,396
Does this happen very often?

349
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,148
Can't tell yet. The case is too new.

350
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,032
Oh, but he'll be all right.

351
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,195
I hope so.

352
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,437
I know how you feel about poor Homer,
but life must go on.

353
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,591
I ought to take you out on the town
tonight and cheer you up.

354
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,392
- Homer would want it that way.
- Really?

355
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,635
Sweetest kid that ever was.

356
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,318
Now, you tell me where you live,
and I'll pick you up.

357
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,750
My dear doctor, I live on the front
page of the <i>Morning Chronicle.</i>

358
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,949
On the what?

359
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,753
On the front page
of the <i>Morning Chronicle.</i>

360
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,110
And you can pick me up
for seven cents.

361
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,832
Now climb back in your horse
and buggy

362
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,838
and try your bedside manner
on someone else!

363
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,275
What was that?

364
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,480
We just came down to earth.

365
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,393
Come on, boy, we've landed.
Come on, come on.

366
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,159
"Gentlemen, as the Mayor of New York
City, it gives me great pleasure

367
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,316
"to receive you here
and to present you..."

368
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,032
Oh, I guess I'll remember it all right.

369
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,199
I really appreciate your doing this,
Your Honour. It's for a worthy cause.

370
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,516
Hey, Doc!
Doc, what's the latest bulletin?

371
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,029
- Status quo.
- Well, is he suffering?

372
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,073
Feeling no pain, hasn't opened his eyes
since we landed.

373
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,191
Poor guy.
How long do you figure he'll last?

374
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,355
Sixteen days?

375
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,630
- Fifteen days, maybe?
- Well, that's hard to tell.

376
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,352
Well, look, if you get a hint, tip me off,
will you?

377
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,232
Because I got the fourteenth day
in the pool.

378
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,590
Yeah, I'll tell him.
Maybe for you, he'll speed things up.

379
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,551
Thanks, Doc.

380
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,874
- Is there a cure for him?
- Not in his condition.

381
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,280
I'm Dr Harris.

382
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,072
Would you take a letter, please?

383
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,589
To Mr Saks,
in care of Saks Fifth Avenue,

384
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,948
New York, New York.

385
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,274
Would you read that back, please?

386
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,358
"Mr Saks, Saks Fifth Avenue,
New York, New York."

387
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,118
- Is that all I said?
- Yes, sir.

388
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,275
Thank you.

389
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,789
Dear, Mr Saks, how's the family?

390
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,639
New paragraph.

391
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,117
I read the ad in the paper today
and I would like two of everything.

392
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,196
And send the bill to Oliver Stone,

393
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,709
in care of
the <i>New York Morning Chronicle.</i>

394
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,992
Drop over and see me for a minute

395
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,475
if you can get someone
to watch the store.

396
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,875
Sincerely yours, Homer Flagg.

397
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,433
The poor kid.

398
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,833
- Oh, don't feel bad. I'm not gonna...
- Homer!

399
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,273
...have trouble living here. Hiya, Steve.

400
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,273
Hey, Steve, get a load of all this.
Is this beautiful?

401
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,517
Come here, let me show you around!
In here. Isn't this terrific?

402
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,113
A bathroom
bigger than the station at Desert Hole.

403
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,958
And look it out here, Doc.

404
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,474
Another bathroom.

405
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,114
So shiny, so clean, you gotta wash up
before you go in there.

406
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,434
Hey, come here.

407
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,315
This way.

408
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,839
- And guess what's in here?
- A bathroom.

409
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,038
Right. Isn't that silly?

410
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,355
Indoors, three bathrooms.
Outdoors, nothing.

411
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,914
- All right, Homer, calm down.
- And look over here.

412
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,349
- Homer.
- Hey, Doc, look at this furniture.

413
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,674
- Is that terrific?
- Homer.

414
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,473
And the telephone, all you have to do
is pick it up and ask for room service.

415
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,477
- Homer!
- But the paper's paying for it.

416
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,434
Hello, room service, please.
Hello, room service? Guess who?

417
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,912
What are you doing, Doc?

418
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,715
Come on. He's a very sick boy.

419
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,235
Come on.

420
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,720
Oh, hello. Hello, everyone.

421
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,959
How are you all?

422
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,157
What are you doing, you idiot?

423
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,589
- I'm living my last days to the hilt.
- You gotta calm down.

424
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,631
Don't you know this whole city's
gone off its rocker about you?

425
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,795
You gotta play the part.

426
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,148
You gotta give them
something to cry about.

427
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,157
Like the end is drawing close.

428
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,995
Oh, Doctor.

429
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,436
I think the end is drawing close.

430
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,470
I'm not long for this world, Doctor.

431
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,359
Oh, and I'm so young.

432
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,711
Oh, much too young to die.

433
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,397
No. You gotta play it weak and soulfully.

434
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,592
- Well, that was weak and soulfully.
- But it wasn't believable.

435
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,109
Look, if someone comes in,
first we do this.

436
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,391
Then I take your pulse,
and you do the rest with your eyes.

437
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,396
Remember this is a sickroom.
Hurry up, get in bed.

438
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,878
Hello. Yes, this is Dr Harris.

439
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,877
I told you, Mr Flagg is in no condition
to receive visitors.

440
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,277
Needs all the rest he can get.

441
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,792
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
Send them right up!

442
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,797
Homer! Homer!

443
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,878
Wally and the editor,
they're on their way up. Here.

444
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,475
Thirty-two in the waist.

445
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,749
Would you make
two of everything, please?

446
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,949
One for me and one for my doctor.

447
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,069
- Did you hear that, two of everything?
- Homer!

448
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,394
- One for him, one for the doctor.
- Here he is now!

449
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,475
- Hiya, Doc.
- What are you doing here?

450
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,750
These guys make nice clothes.
Go ahead, measure him.

451
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,359
- Don't measure me.
- The shoulder is 17.

452
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,311
- Homer!
- Hello, room service?

453
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,919
- Homer.
- What have you got left?

454
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,794
I'm just gonna order something
to eat for you. Aren't you hungry, Doc?

455
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,275
Homer!

456
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,999
- Will you let me out?
- Hello, room service.

457
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,109
He's a very sick boy.

458
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,038
- Hello. Just a minute. Hold on.
- Homer.

459
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,637
- Hello, New York. Hello. I love you.
- Homer.

460
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,672
You want to come up for dinner?
Room 3608.

461
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,712
- How many shrimp cocktails?
- Homer.

462
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,951
- I got it.
- Homer.

463
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,470
What are you doing down there, Doc?

464
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,874
Come on.

465
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,316
Hello? Hello?

466
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,716
Yes, I'm holding on room service.

467
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,511
I'm just trying to get room service.

468
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,789
Come on, son, you're going to bed.

469
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,114
Oh, no, but I have guests for dinner!

470
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,276
You do that later. Right now,
I got to check your haemoglobin.

471
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,675
No, wait a minute.
Send me 3,000 shrimp cocktails.

472
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,839
- Oh, Homer, 3,000 shrimp cocktails.
- Well, that's how many people I invited.

473
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,749
Why, you little hyperthyroid.

474
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,757
Everybody'll get wise,
and Wally will be here in a minute.

475
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,030
Yeah, and I'm gonna tell her on you,
too. You leave me alone.

476
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,948
I'm just trying to have some fun,
and you're stopping me from having it!

477
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,748
Come on, I want to have fun.

478
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,394
You want to have fun?
Go ahead, have fun.

479
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,909
Doc! Doc!

480
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,317
Here comes Dr Harris now.

481
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,590
Quiet, everyone, quiet.

482
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,995
Friends, I'm sorry
you had to see him like that.

483
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,680
But it's the leukocytes
fighting the necrosis.

484
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,150
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't mention that.

485
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,474
Now, if you'd all leave,

486
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,239
I'm sure he can get a little peace
and a little quiet.

487
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,271
Thank you. Goodbye.

488
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,311
Doc! Doc! Hey, Doc!

489
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,515
That wasn't very nice of you, Doc.
I had no fun in there!

490
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,358
- Oh, quiet, Homer.
- What's the matter?

491
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,879
Wally's out in the hall.
Now, do me a favour.

492
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,433
- What?
- Die a little.

493
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,075
Now.

494
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,835
Come in.

495
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,997
- Oh, Dr Harris, how is he?
- Status quo.

496
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,513
Is there any pain?

497
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,277
Comes and goes, goes and comes.

498
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,118
- Oh, this is Oliver Stone, my publisher.
- Happy to know you, Doctor.

499
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,516
I don't know how we can show
our thanks for all you've done,

500
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,232
but I'm having my paper, the <i>Chronicle,</i>

501
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,511
prepare a series of articles
against socialised medicine.

502
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,711
Say, he has quite an appetite,
hasn't he?

503
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,916
Oh, eats like a horse.

504
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,312
Symptoms of the disease.

505
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,593
Well, but don't you think
you should put him on a diet?

506
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,756
Dr Harris, may we see him?

507
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,598
Well...

508
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,432
- May we?
- Yes.

509
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,875
- This way.
- This way.

510
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,558
Well...

511
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,438
- How are you, sailor?
- Seasick.

512
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,916
Hello, Homer. I'm Oliver Stone.

513
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,717
Oh, how do you do?
I'm awfully glad to meet you, Mr Stone.

514
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,434
You're the kind soul
that's giving me everything free.

515
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,596
Everything I want, sparing no expense.

516
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,156
What a fine man, what a good man,
what a swell man you...

517
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,837
Seems awfully healthy to me.

518
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,108
That's the way he is, always smiling.

519
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,476
Homer, Oliver has scheduled
a lot of public appearances for you.

520
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,592
Oh, I'm sorry,
but the fewer people he sees the better.

521
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,392
I think it's best I filled in for him.

522
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,637
Wait a minute! He's the story, not you!

523
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,990
If you think at these prices that I...

524
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,388
I didn't mean to upset you,
but we've made all the arrangements.

525
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,872
The World Series,
complete tour of the city.

526
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:23,516
Tomorrow, tomorrow was going to be
Homer Flagg Night at Wonderland.

527
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,511
Oh, he doesn't feel up to it.

528
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,079
What's Wonderland?

529
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,634
Oh, it's a dancehall, girls.
Much too tiring.

530
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,513
- I feel fine.
- Are you sure you're up to it?

531
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,839
All these events are fine for circulation,
but you come first.

532
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,039
Oh, I'm fine.

533
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,916
But when the end does come,

534
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,272
I want you to write about me,
"Exit Laughing."

535
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,111
You better go now. He's had enough.

536
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,992
- Come on, let's go. Come on.
- Yes.

537
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,478
- Doctor.
- Yes?

538
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,078
I want to thank you
for what you're doing for Homer.

539
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,920
- It's not very much.
- I know all about it.

540
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,639
You do? Well...

541
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,076
Leaving your hometown
to come to New York,

542
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,156
giving up your whole practice.

543
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,795
My whole practice is right in that room.

544
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,669
The poor kid.

545
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,709
Poor Homer.

546
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,277
No! No! Wait a minute.

547
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,754
There's gotta be a mistake.

548
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,316
- Shrimp cocktails for 3,000.
- No! I protest!

549
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,437
This must be the wrong room!

550
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,516
- Who ordered these shrimp cocktails?
- No!

551
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,438
...popcorn, chewing gum!

552
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,109
Candy, peanuts, popcorn, chewing gum!

553
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,356
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

554
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,597
<i>Homer Flagg</i>
<i>has just entered Yankee Stadium.</i>

555
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,069
<i>I ask this distinguished gathering</i>
<i>to rise in tribute.</i>

556
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,399
<i>Who is the bravest?</i>

557
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,035
<i>The very bravest by far</i>

558
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,716
<i>You are the bravest</i>

559
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,590
<i>Homer Flagg, you are</i>

560
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,076
<i>We thank you. Be seated.</i>

561
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,993
<i>And now,</i>
<i>Homer will throw out the first ball.</i>

562
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,710
<i>The first ball for us,</i>
<i>perhaps the last one for him.</i>

563
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,075
Mr Flagg.

564
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,960
If you're too weak to throw it
all the way to the pitcher,

565
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,832
just toss it to me, and I'll relay.

566
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,393
Oh, no, thank you.

567
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,393
<i>There will be a change in the line-up</i>
<i>for New York.</i>

568
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,509
<i>Now pitching...</i>

569
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,317
I think I'll have

570
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,193
this filet mignon with soufflé,

571
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,235
and then some vichyssoise.

572
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,309
Duck a I'orange aux truffles is nice,

573
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,990
and for dessert,
I'll have some of those petit fours.

574
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,439
I'll leave it to you.

575
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,835
You bring me
everything you can think of.

576
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,713
- Why should I worry about my weight?
- Homer.

577
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,278
- Don't eat the food here, it'll kill you.
- But I'm hungry.

578
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,239
I'll run next door to the delicatessen.
I'll get you a nice corned beef sandwich.

579
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,920
Oh, I wouldn't want you to go
to that trouble.

580
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,591
I assure you, it's an honour.

581
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,195
Hey.

582
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,358
How does a fellow get through to you?

583
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,630
Oh, I'm sorry. I was watching Homer.

584
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,637
I've tried everything.
You know, some boys and girls,

585
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,239
when they dance,
pay attention to each other.

586
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,874
- Oh?
- May sound like a radical idea to you,

587
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,592
but why don't you give it a try?

588
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,518
I'm sorry, Steve.
I'm paying attention now.

589
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,878
What did you want to tell me?

590
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,233
<i>How do you speak to an angel?</i>

591
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,831
<i>I'm completely in the dark</i>

592
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,678
<i>When you know</i>
<i>that you've just met an angel</i>

593
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:09,237
<i>is there a proper remark?</i>

594
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,152
<i>We were alone for a moment</i>

595
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:23,551
<i>Why was I lost in a cloud?</i>

596
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:30,914
<i>Do you speak to an angel in a whisper?</i>

597
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,552
<i>Or do you just say I love you</i>

598
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,552
<i>out loud?</i>

599
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,476
<i>We were alone for a moment</i>

600
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,711
<i>Why was I lost in a cloud?</i>

601
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,756
<i>Do you speak to an angel in a whisper?</i>

602
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,913
<i>Or do you just say</i>

603
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,158
<i>I love you</i>

604
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:23,072
<i>out loud?</i>

605
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,117
Let's see what Homer's doing.

606
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,917
Maybe he's got a girl for me.

607
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,713
Especially for you.

608
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,557
Eat. Eat. Enjoy yourself.

609
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,671
Thank you.

610
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,869
Thank you.

611
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,796
- Having fun?
- Kind of.

612
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,319
But sometimes I get a little depressed.

613
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,954
Like before,
when we walked in, everybody moaned.

614
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,799
They all looked at me
like I was an iodine label.

615
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,955
Hold it!

616
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,556
That ought to wring their hearts.

617
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,638
I used to love New York when it went
gaga over some celebrity

618
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,558
and danced in the street
with a neon light around its heart.

619
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,798
But I'm getting fed up with the trick tears
and the phoney lamentations over you.

620
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,679
I'm glad they're phoney.

621
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,075
Kind of makes everything
all right in a way.

622
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,680
- Makes what all right?
- Well...

623
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,476
- Makes what all right?
- Well...

624
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,433
Homer means he doesn't like
to see these people suffer.

625
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,834
They love to suffer.

626
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,918
Yeah, for good clean fun,
there's nothing like a wake.

627
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,598
Please, let's not talk shop.

628
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,312
Come on now,
this conversation's getting me down.

629
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,874
Let's loosen up a bit.
A little champagne, please.

630
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,672
- That's the word. Champagne.
- Champagne.

631
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,869
- Buckets of it.
- Buckets of it.

632
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,955
- White champagne.
- White champagne.

633
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,149
- Pink champagne.
- Pink champagne.

634
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,395
- Blue champagne.
- Blue champagne.

635
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,351
Mix it all together
and force it down my throat.

636
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,755
This is my last fling,
and I'm gonna fling it.

637
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,031
- No, Homer, it's not on your diet.
- Big mouth.

638
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,479
Waiter, bottle of ginger ale for Mr Flagg.

639
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,352
Bottle of ginger ale for Mr Flagg.

640
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,677
- Domestic.
- Domestic.

641
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,959
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

642
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,992
<i>May I offer greetings</i>
<i>to this star-studded array of celebrities.</i>

643
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,633
<i>Tonight, there is one among us</i>

644
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,354
<i>who adds a bit of unaccustomed drama</i>
<i>to our revels.</i>

645
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,879
Here's your ginger ale.

646
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,149
Thanks very much.

647
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,714
<i>There he sits, undaunted by fate,</i>
<i>a brave smile on his lips,</i>

648
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,958
<i>drinking in the charm, the glitter,</i>
<i>the gay sounds of life.</i>

649
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,031
Don't pay any attention to the label.

650
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,196
You've got champagne
in the ginger ale bottle.

651
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,153
Big mouth, he got ginger ale
in the champagne bottle.

652
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,195
- "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."
- Thank you.

653
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,750
<i>On with the show, my little actors all,</i>

654
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,199
<i>for New York is New York,</i>

655
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,278
<i>and though its heart breaks, it dances.</i>

656
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,389
<i>Tonight!</i>

657
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,268
<i>Tonight, my friends,</i>

658
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,789
<i>you are not the famous people</i>
<i>of Broadway.</i>

659
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,197
<i>Tonight, you are a little chorus</i>
<i>laughing and pirouetting</i>

660
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,311
<i>to afford one last brief hour...</i>

661
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,791
- Here's your water, Homer.
- Who wants water?

662
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,310
- Vodka.
- Oh, vodka.

663
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,229
- Only for you.
- For me.

664
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,874
Compliments, Waiters' Union,
Local 603.

665
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,995
- Now?
- Who's stopping?

666
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,511
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>if the judges are ready,</i>

667
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,189
<i>we will start Wonderland's</i>
<i>internationally famous Jitterbug Final.</i>

668
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,549
I wanna dance.

669
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,108
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>never have I been so deeply touched.</i>

670
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,708
<i>Homer Flagg has asked permission</i>
<i>to enter our dancing contest.</i>

671
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,229
<i>One final gauntlet thrown into the face</i>
<i>of the Grim Reaper.</i>

672
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,032
- <i>Shall we let him?</i>
- No!

673
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,878
- Yes!
- Yes!

674
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,877
<i>Homer, you're very fortunate</i>
<i>this evening.</i>

675
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,230
<i>My friends, we are indeed</i>
<i>very happy to present</i>

676
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,920
<i>last year's contest winner,</i>
<i>Miss Sheree North.</i>

677
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,476
<i>You're gonna dance with me, baby</i>

678
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,318
<i>That's what you're gonna do</i>

679
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,916
<i>You're gonna dance with me, baby</i>

680
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,190
<i>I've got my eye on you</i>

681
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,356
<i>Come on and dance it up, baby</i>

682
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,596
<i>This is my lucky day</i>

683
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,836
<i>We're gonna win a cup, baby</i>

684
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,315
<i>We'll take the prize away</i>

685
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,672
<i>I've got to have my baby</i>
<i>or I'd rather wind up dancing alone</i>

686
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,797
- <i>No other gal</i>
- <i>No!</i>

687
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,150
<i>I wanna winner not a beginner</i>

688
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,350
<i>No other guy for you, baby</i>

689
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,710
<i>What makes you think you're free?</i>

690
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,796
<i>Tell all the others</i>
<i>to dance with their brothers</i>

691
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,717
<i>That's how it's got to be</i>

692
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,475
<i>We'll win the cup</i>
<i>Steal the prize</i>

693
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,556
<i>Right before their very eyes</i>

694
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,231
<i>'Cause you're gonna dance</i>
<i>with me, baby</i>

695
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,834
Give him air.

696
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,269
Give him some air.

697
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,512
- Is he all right?
- He's hurt.

698
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,993
Come on, give him some air.

699
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,633
Doctor, I want to know the worst.

700
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,239
We go to press in 15 minutes.

701
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,590
Oh, Oliver. Is there a chance, Steve?

702
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,234
Say something. Say something.

703
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,828
Here's a new bulletin
on the condition of Homer Flagg,

704
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,871
who collapsed last night at Wonderland.

705
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,070
<i>The Mayor of New York</i>
<i>has rushed to Homer's side</i>

706
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,633
<i>to extend the city's sympathy.</i>

707
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,909
And the following is a statement

708
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,350
issued from the sick room at 9:15
by Dr Stephen Harris.

709
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,832
<i>Quote. Homer is holding his own.</i>
<i>Unquote.</i>

710
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,918
Here. We'll go halfies.

711
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,756
Oh, Steve. We were so nervous.
It took you so long.

712
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,116
I had to go clear over to
the Belleflower Hospital

713
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,719
- for the latest drugs.
- Oh, yeah.

714
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,032
- Sorry, no visitors.
- The <i>Chronicle</i> has to know.

715
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,151
Yes, but, Doctor, I have
a very important appointment!

716
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,316
Oh, I'm sure
it won't take much longer now.

717
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,192
The Mayor wants to take your pulse.

718
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,595
Oliver wants to pull a sheet
over your head.

719
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,076
That's what this dog wants to do.
Can't we send him back?

720
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,158
That's a pedigreed basset hound,
a gift from the Governor of Kentucky.

721
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,797
You don't want to insult
the Bluegrass State, do you?

722
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,754
No, but why couldn't they send me
a horse I could ride out of town?

723
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,553
Oh, my head.

724
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,233
You have what is known in
the medical annals as <i>la</i> hangover.

725
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,394
I got worse than that,
I got a conscience.

726
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,351
I'm a liar, that's what I am.

727
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,517
Worst liar that ever lived.

728
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,356
I'd shoot myself, only I'm afraid
it might make me feel better.

729
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,393
Here, drink this.

730
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,439
Go ahead, drink it.

731
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,394
What was that I drank?

732
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,590
Tomato juice, Worcestershire,

733
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,869
Tabasco, horseradish and a raw egg.

734
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,394
- Why didn't you give me medicine?
- Medicine? Never carry it.

735
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,353
- It's too dangerous.
- What college did you graduate from?

736
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,118
- Who graduated?
- Oh.

737
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,110
I don't care how important it is!
What I'm doing is more important!

738
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,753
You think you've got troubles.

739
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,838
Look at me.
For the first time in my life, I'm in love.

740
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,351
Just a moment, please.
She's out there now.

741
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,755
She's been begging to get in to see you.

742
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,031
Homer, I want to go straight.

743
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,239
The works, preacher,
white picket fence.

744
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,552
She won't listen to me.

745
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,032
She'll listen to every cockeyed story
you tell her, but me, she won't listen to.

746
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,832
Will you do me one favour?

747
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,194
You want I should die? Oh, Doctor.

748
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,073
I don't want you to die.
Just tell Wally what I said.

749
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,350
The works, marriage.

750
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,950
She'll believe you
even when you're telling the truth.

751
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,954
Is it the truth?

752
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,869
- Do you want to marry her?
- Yes.

753
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,598
Okay, Steve. I'll tell her.

754
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,514
Thanks, Homer. I...

755
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,828
Thanks.

756
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,272
Yeah, well... Goodbye.

757
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,273
He wants to see you.

758
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,512
Please, it'll be much easier
if they're alone.

759
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,910
I'm glad you wanted to talk to me.

760
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,596
You see, I'm going away,

761
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,673
and I thought
I might not see you again until...

762
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,756
You're going away? Where?

763
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,914
- Just to Albany.
- What for?

764
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,511
Well, just to see the Governor.

765
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,594
What are you doing in Albany
with the Governor?

766
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,592
It's about me, huh?

767
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,030
It's about a monument in Central Park.

768
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,429
What monument?

769
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,559
Your monument, Homer.

770
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,158
I don't want any monument.

771
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,514
Why not?

772
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,714
Well,

773
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,112
because I hate pigeons.

774
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,357
The city wants you to have it.

775
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,831
And I'm glad I told you about it.

776
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,313
I want you to know now and always
that I think you're magnificent.

777
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,116
I wish you wouldn't say that, Wally.

778
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,316
I don't feel magnificent at all.

779
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,229
I know.

780
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,192
And that's what
makes you so magnificent.

781
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,995
Why do we always have to talk about
me and monuments and things?

782
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,957
Why don't we
talk about something cheerful,

783
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,514
like marriage and a home and a family?

784
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,877
- Why, Homer.
- And Steve can give you all that, too.

785
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,149
Steve?

786
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,388
Well, I know you think
he's not the kind to settle down,

787
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,317
but with you, he would.

788
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,116
Who wouldn't with a girl like you?

789
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,554
You're so understanding, and kind,

790
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,114
and sweet,

791
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,159
and beautiful and...

792
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,555
I wish I could think of another word.

793
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,717
Homer, did Steve ask you
to tell me all this?

794
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,068
Well, what difference does that make?

795
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,679
- He's a...
- Did he?

796
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,479
That's pretty hard to answer,
except to say yes.

797
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,553
I think that's the most unselfish
and beautiful thing I ever heard.

798
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,837
Well, Steve's like that, unselfish and...

799
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,358
I wasn't talking about him.

800
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,510
Oh, how could I have been so blind?

801
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,551
I know you'd never lie to me.

802
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,230
You're in love with me, aren't you?

803
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,839
Yes, I am, Miss Cook.

804
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,716
Mr Flagg, will you marry me?

805
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,876
But Steve's in love with you.
No, no, he's the one you should marry.

806
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,036
There's no future in marrying me.

807
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,917
- That's the most heartbreaking...
- No. No.

808
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,553
Oh, what if all we have
is a couple of weeks?

809
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,398
A handful of perfect hours.

810
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,873
- No, no.
- And I'll be there at the end, sailor.

811
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,389
I'll be there saying goodbye.

812
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,593
Yes, yes.

813
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,431
- Steve! Steve!
- Goodbye.

814
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,115
Steve!

815
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,519
- Well, what happened?
- Is it the end?

816
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,835
- Well, he just fainted.
- I'll get out another extra.

817
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,076
Mayor, can you perform
a wedding ceremony tomorrow?

818
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,156
- Why, of course I can.
- Wally.

819
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,669
- You'll be best man.
- Best man?

820
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,155
Mayor...

821
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,029
I tried, Doc, but she wanted me.

822
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,796
You must have tried awfully hard.

823
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,351
I don't feel very good.

824
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,471
<i>Champagne and wedding cake</i>

825
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,111
<i>Oh, what a celebration it will be</i>

826
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,915
<i>There'll be</i>
<i>champagne and wedding cake</i>

827
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,108
<i>The day that you belong to me</i>

828
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,710
<i>Nine foot high and 10 foot wide</i>

829
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,991
<i>The biggest wedding cake</i>
<i>you've ever seen</i>

830
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,749
<i>The champagne bubbles</i>
<i>can solve all your troubles</i>

831
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,668
<i>So try a glass</i>
<i>and you'll know what I mean</i>

832
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,632
Gee, Wally, I...

833
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,195
I don't usually have trouble talking,
and I'm...

834
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,633
But I guess
I do have trouble talking to you.

835
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,790
<i>How do you speak to an angel?</i>

836
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,997
<i>I'm completely in the dark</i>

837
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:57,632
<i>When you know</i>
<i>that you've just met an angel</i>

838
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:05,157
<i>is there a proper remark?</i>

839
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,675
<i>We were alone for a moment</i>

840
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,795
<i>Why was I lost in a cloud?</i>

841
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:23,914
<i>Do you speak to an angel in a whisper?</i>

842
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:30,998
<i>Or do you just say I love you</i>

843
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,955
<i>out loud?</i>

844
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:53,152
<i>Do you speak to an angel in a whisper?</i>

845
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,632
<i>Or do you just say I love you</i>

846
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,755
<i>out loud?</i>

847
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:20,549
<i>I love you, I love you, I love...</i>

848
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,715
Hello.

849
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,633
You're really going
to go through with this, huh?

850
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,637
Why shouldn't I? She loves me.

851
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,030
What happens when she gets tired
of waiting for you to keel over?

852
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,310
She loves me. She'll be happy.

853
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,319
And after the wedding,
I'll tell her the whole thing,

854
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,510
and we'll have a big laugh over it.

855
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,399
If you really believe she loves you,
you'll tell her before you marry her.

856
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,794
Yeah? Well, you're just jealous.

857
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,037
And if you want to be a spoilsport,
why don't you tell her?

858
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,639
Oh, sure, why don't we tell everybody?

859
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,273
We're both in this up to our necks.

860
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,312
If this city ever finds out
what kind of a fraud you are,

861
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,317
they'll lock you up
and throw the warden away.

862
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,158
I couldn't do it to you.

863
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,793
Oh, it's awfully big of you.

864
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,876
I'm taking my stuff
and I'm going across the hall,

865
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,150
so you and Wally can have
the whole place to yourselves.

866
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,554
Thanks a lot.

867
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,272
And believe me,
I don't give you three weeks to live.

868
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,115
Yes?

869
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,997
- Hi, Steve.
- Hi.

870
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,154
I know it's bad luck,

871
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,360
but I wanted to see Homer
before the wedding.

872
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:20,792
But I wanted to see Homer
before the wedding.

873
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,514
Well, he's gone.

874
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,310
Don't worry. You couldn't be that lucky.
He's around here somewhere.

875
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,830
- Wally.
- Please, Steve, let go of me.

876
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,916
You're not gonna go through with it,
are you?

877
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,553
- Yes.
- Why?

878
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,910
Because the world owes Homer
a little happiness.

879
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,473
You're not the world.

880
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,228
You're in love with me.
You are, aren't you?

881
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,270
- What are we going to do about it?
- Nothing.

882
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,312
You'll just have to wait until
Homer's gone.

883
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,993
I should live so long.

884
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,589
Wally.

885
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,111
We are gathered here together

886
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,796
to join this man and this woman

887
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,431
in bonds of holy matrimony.

888
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,391
If any of you know
any just or legal reason

889
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,515
why these two
should not be thus joined,

890
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,559
speak now or forever hold your peace.

891
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,588
Do you, Wally Cook, take Homer Flagg
to be your lawful wedded husband,

892
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,470
to love, honour and cherish him,

893
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,349
to comfort him
in sickness and in health?

894
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,469
I do.

895
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,758
And you, Homer Flagg,

896
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,032
do you take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

897
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,032
No, because she doesn't love me.

898
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,549
- Homer.
- Well, it's true. You just pity me.

899
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,790
You were only marrying
a sinus condition, anyhow.

900
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,148
- Now, Homer.
- Bye.

901
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,235
But, Homer, no.

902
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,271
What's the matter with him?
What did he mean?

903
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,709
Oh, it's sad. His case is more advanced
than I thought.

904
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,149
You see, the poisoning has reached
his lobus maximus.

905
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,316
- His what? His lobus...
- Maximus.

906
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,113
- Let me get to him first.
- All right.

907
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,958
Mayor, help me get through.

908
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,712
Homer, what are you doing?

909
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,512
I'm packing my things
and I'm going back to Desert Hole,

910
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,710
where I'll never have to
wear these again.

911
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,149
You acted like a man,
but you can't run away.

912
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,872
Yeah? Well, she'll be after me again,

913
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,592
begging me to marry her.

914
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,677
And next time, I'll be too weak to resist,

915
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,518
and I'll hate myself
every morning for years.

916
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,756
You can't hide. You're a national figure.

917
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,472
Well, I don't feel like a national figure.

918
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,795
I'm just gonna sneak away
with my hat over my eyes

919
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,512
through the park and down the alley.

920
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,358
Then on a boat to Sing Sing.

921
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,398
- Wally.
- Protect me.

922
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,080
Don't let her come in.
If she kisses me again, I'm a goner.

923
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,998
You got my word, but if she gets
past me, there's no way out.

924
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,509
- What'll I do?
- I'll leave that entirely up to the boy

925
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,473
who was quick-witted enough
to get us into this mess.

926
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,034
I told her
it reached your lobus maximus.

927
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,511
- You take it from there.
- Oh, you mean...

928
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,675
Yeah.

929
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,708
Is he in there?

930
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,393
Well? Well? Well?

931
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,669
I'd much rather you wouldn't see him

932
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,836
- in his present condition.
- Well, what's the matter with him?

933
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,916
No, no, the Doctor's absolutely right,
Wally.

934
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,918
- We'll just send in a photographer.
- No, I want to know the worst.

935
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,554
Look, Doctor,
I want to talk to you a moment, just...

936
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,750
- Homer!
- Where are you?

937
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,359
- Homer?
- Where is he? What happened to him?

938
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,789
We're over target! Bombs away!

939
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,472
Hurrah! A direct hit!

940
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,799
Bombs away!

941
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,157
Bombardier to pilot. Reload!

942
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,231
Homer, don't you know who I am?

943
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,191
Yes. You're our commanding officer.

944
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,788
And we'll win the war for you, too.

945
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,953
I told you not to come in.

946
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,435
Espionage, eh? Bombs away!

947
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,834
Direct hit, men.

948
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,633
- Major.
- Yes?

949
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,034
Is it all right if I send someone in

950
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,071
to photograph you
for the <i>Air Force Journal?</i>

951
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,428
No. You're an enemy!

952
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,599
This is silly.

953
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,435
Direct hit.

954
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,633
Please try and forget.

955
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,749
Oh, but...

956
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,551
Direct hit! Good work, men.

957
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,998
All right, Homer.
Homer, come on. Come on down.

958
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,354
Come on.

959
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,635
Will you stop playing games
and get down here?

960
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,072
- You still here? Go on home.
- Oliver, you've got to listen to me.

961
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,714
There are just three doctors,
three great men in this world,

962
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,717
who really know the score
on radiation poisoning.

963
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,558
- They might save him. Yes.
- Save him?

964
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,797
This whole town is getting
tired of the way he's hanging on.

965
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,717
There's such a thing as too much pluck.

966
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,799
- Besides, our circulation is dropping.
- Then this is the way to build it up.

967
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,190
We'll make it your personal campaign.

968
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,231
Think of the headlines, Oliver.

969
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,635
"Humanitarian Editor
Saves Hero's Life."

970
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,432
Why, they'll be
building monuments to you.

971
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,676
And there's always politics, Oliver.

972
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,669
Think what it means to be a senator.
Your mail goes free.

973
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,915
I'm not interested in personal glory,

974
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,759
but it might sell some newspapers.
You get those doctors on the phone.

975
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,029
Yes, sir.

976
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,399
- Long distance, please.
- Long distance?

977
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,033
Wait a minute, where are they?
California?

978
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,878
- Oh, no, one's in Hong Kong.
- No.

979
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,035
- One in Vienna.
- No.

980
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,673
- And one in Paris.
- No.

981
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,076
Hello. I'm calling for Oliver Stone.

982
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,794
I'd like to place a call
to Dr Chung See Lee,

983
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,115
Hong Kong General Hospital,
Hong Kong.

984
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,597
Thank you. The operator.

985
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,637
Look, operator, let me know
when my three minutes are up.

986
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,354
Steve, are you still so set against
any other doctors looking at Homer?

987
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,233
- That's the last thing I'd want to see.
- But if they didn't treat him,

988
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,920
if they just took him to Belleflower
Hospital and looked him over?

989
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,589
That's the last thing I want to see.
Can't we talk about something else?

990
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,792
We've had a beautiful morning.
You dragged me out of bed at 8:30.

991
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,639
I think we've fed every squirrel
in Central Park.

992
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,276
Oh, no, don't bother. You've had me
eating out of your hand long ago.

993
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,073
I guess I'd better get back to the office.

994
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,958
What's the matter?

995
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,078
I've been looking all over town
for that perfume.

996
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,758
Isn't this lovely?

997
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,712
Let me buy you a quart.

998
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,193
$104.

999
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,678
Just take a sniff and let's go.

1000
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,439
- Do you think you can afford even that?
- Oh, I'm loaded.

1001
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,313
- You saw my office in Desert Hole.
- Oh, luxurious.

1002
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,193
I own all the adhesive tape outright.
After all...

1003
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,791
<i>Financial responsibility</i>
<i>is a day to day affair</i>

1004
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,831
<i>But for the first time in my life</i>

1005
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,833
<i>I'm beginning to care</i>

1006
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:28,198
<i>Money burns a hole in my pocket</i>

1007
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,075
<i>How I wish I had millions of dollars</i>

1008
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,952
<i>and nothing to do</i>

1009
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:40,478
<i>but just buy pretty presents for you</i>

1010
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:48,829
<i>Money burns a hole in my pocket</i>

1011
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,796
<i>How I wish I had oil wells in Texas</i>

1012
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:57,795
<i>to keep me supplied with money</i>

1013
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,509
<i>while I sit by your side</i>

1014
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:06,108
<i>Every day of the week</i>

1015
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,275

01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,919
<i>All the beautiful things you seek</i>

1017
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,759

1018
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,637

01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,435

1020
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:31,597

1021
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:38,353
<i>And wishing</i>
<i>they were diamonds instead</i>

1022
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,350
Come on, cut it out, fellas!
I'm being forced into this!

1023
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,268
Wait till Dr Harris finds out.
You guys will be in trouble.

1024
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,075
We'll set him down here
while we open the door.

1025
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,079
- Look out! Look out!
- Stop that man!

1026
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,879
- Homer!
- Taxi! Taxi!

1027
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,872
- Taxi!
- Come back here, Homer!

1028
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,956
Homer! Come back, Homer!

1029
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,638
- Come back here, Homer!
- Taxi!

1030
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,079
I'm Homer Flagg.
They're after me. Let's go!

1031
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,430
- You bet we will.
- Good.

1032
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,400
Oh, no! These are the guys!

1033
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,828
What happened here? Convention?

1034
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,154
Oh, nothing to worry about, Doctor.

1035
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,191
Your patient's safely on his way
to the hospital.

1036
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,878
Oh, fine. Fine.

1037
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,475
- My patient! Hospital! What hospital?
- Belleflower.

1038
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,999
- What?
- Belleflower!

1039
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,554
Belleflower! Belleflower?
You know what they'll do to him?

1040
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,113
They'll examine him!

1041
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,233
You knew it all the time.

1042
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,588
Steve, it's for his own good.

1043
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,835
What do you know what's good for him?

1044
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,076
- I was only trying to help.
- "I was only trying to help."

1045
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,156
I gotta get to him first! Taxi!

1046
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,598
Belleflower! Taxi!

1047
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,879
Homer! You all right?

1048
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,989
Get me out of here!

1049
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,031
They got me strung up here
like a plucked chicken!

1050
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,515
Well, we'll both be dead ducks
if we don't hurry!

1051
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,517
The specialists are already here!

1052
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,437
One's from Vienna,
one's from Hong Kong,

1053
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,790
- and the other's from Paris.
- We should be in all those places.

1054
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,353
- Let's go!
- No, it's too late!

1055
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,595
We gotta fool the specialists.

1056
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,472
I gotta get your pulse up to 160.

1057
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,556
- What for?
- To send you into a coma.

1058
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,274
- What's a coma?
- Never mind. Put up your dukes.

1059
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,320
- Hit me.
- No, I like you.

1060
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,870
- Now hit me.
- I still like you.

1061
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,479
I know, but the doctors are waiting.

1062
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,750
You got us into this mess,
you little phoney.

1063
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,553
I was just trying to have some fun.
You were in on the whole thing!

1064
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,955
But it was your idea first.
Now come on, hit me!

1065
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,230
Who are you hitting,
you mail order M.D., you?

1066
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,793
Which stands for "miserable doctor"!

1067
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,717
- Attaboy!
- I'll mobilise you!

1068
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,432
- Come on! Hit me!
- You better watch your step.

1069
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,152
I'll make mincemeat out of you, boy!

1070
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,269
Attaboy. Hit. Come on.

1071
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,359
You asked for this, buddy. You're gonna
get yourself in a heck of a lot of trouble!

1072
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,516
Look at that! Watch that footwork!

1073
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,433
Attaboy, come on!

1074
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,550
More, more, more, more!
Hold it! Hold it!

1075
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,397
Come on, let's go! Hit me! Attaboy.

1076
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,909
Hit me. Oh, you can hit me.
Come on, try harder.

1077
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,474
- You can hit me.
- Well, let me hit you. Stand still.

1078
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,999
- Come on.
- I'll hit you.

1079
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,112
Let me hit you. Let me hit you once.

1080
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,035
Now, listen carefully.

1081
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,396
When you come to, just pant and groan.

1082
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,714
What do you mean, when I come to?

1083
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,912
Well, when you regain consciousness,
yell every time the doctors touch you.

1084
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,029
Yeah, yeah.

1085
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,709
- Okay, now, say good night to Papa.
- Goodnight, Papa.

1086
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,955
Good night.

1087
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,314
Dr Harris.

1088
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,549
Steve. Steve.

1089
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,715
Dr Harris!

1090
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,791
Dr Harris, are you in there?

1091
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,790
Don't come in, nurse.
Steve. Steve, get up.

1092
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,433
Dr Harris, Dr Egelhofer of Vienna

1093
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,233
is waiting for your patient
in the fluoroscope room.

1094
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,157
Did you hear me, Dr Harris?

1095
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,555
And Dr Nassau of Paris
and Dr Lee of Hong Kong

1096
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,875
have just entered the scrubbing room.

1097
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,359
Please hurry!

1098
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,880
Dr Harris, please hurry.
The doctors are waiting for you!

1099
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,638
I'll be right there, nurse.

1100
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,630
Here's the patient
from Room 433, Doctor.

1101
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,954
Seems to be in a coma.

1102
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,355
I shall make the medical judgements
here, gentlemen.

1103
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,357
I can dispose with your advice.

1104
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,559
Who is?

1105
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,552
Dr Nassau <i>de</i> Paris.

1106
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,031
Good, <i>kommen Sie rein,</i> Doctor.

1107
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,555
- Nassau!
- Oh, hello, Doctor!

1108
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,589
Yes, but <i>der verstunkene</i> patient
seems to be in perfect health.

1109
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,188
Oh, no, no, the Dr Nassau.

1110
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:37,074
The radiation poisoning set in
the reflex all over.

1111
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,792
That is not true!

1112
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,751
The reflexes, <i>Herr</i> Doctor.

1113
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,198
- See?
- No!

1114
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,432
That is not true!

1115
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,632
Please, Doctor!

1116
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,114
Horrible, <i>oui?</i>

1117
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,719
I do not understand!

1118
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,193
It's easy.

1119
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,550
- Who is?
- The consultation, Doctor.

1120
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,875
- The examination!
- But I...

1121
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,909
The X-ray!

1122
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,917
Here, study the X-ray.

1123
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,917
Examine the X-ray, Doctor.

1124
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,918
I am Dr Nassau.

1125
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,350
<i>Und</i> I am the one and only
Dr Emile Egelhofer.

1126
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,754
You're not going to kiss me a little bit?

1127
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,432
This is <i>Monsieur</i> Flagg?

1128
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,549
This...

1129
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,799
I must examine the patient.

1130
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:58,074
The <i>verstunkene</i> patient is
in the last stages of the last stages,

1131
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,236
and better your eyes
shouldn't be looking on him.

1132
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,954
- You should be looking on the X-rays.
- But, <i>Herr</i> Doctor.

1133
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,069
I have travelled
many thousands of miles.

1134
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,758
But the X-rays
will show what happened with the man.

1135
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,757
It is very important
that I examine the patient.

1136
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,678
Study the X-ray.
Study and you'll see that...

1137
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,235
Dr Nassau, listen.

1138
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,432
Where are you?
I must get back to my mice!

1139
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,876
You must be
Honourable Doctor Egelhofer.

1140
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,151
I am Honourable
Doctor Chung See Lee, Hong Kong.

1141
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,238
I am delighted.
Shall we examine the patient together?

1142
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,399
Oh, no! No time.

1143
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,318
I must get back to Hong Kong
to honourable wife,

1144
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,152
who is not very honourable.

1145
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,673
Funny? No.
Let us look at X-ray and see patient

1146
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,553
- who have radiation poisoning.
- Listen to me, I... No, no, listen...

1147
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,030
Dr Lee, I am Dr Nassau, Paris.

1148
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,878
I will examine the patient.

1149
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,075
But, Doctor!

1150
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,636
The patient, the examination is no good
without the X-ray.

1151
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,193
But, Doctor, this is not ethical.

1152
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,437
I came all the way from Hong Kong
to examine the patient.

1153
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,637
- <i>Monsieur...</i>
- Doctor.

1154
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,153
<i>Monsieur,</i> these are the X-rays
of a woman!

1155
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,989
Goes to show just
how sick <i>verstunkene</i> patient is.

1156
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,109
<i>Verstunkene?</i>

1157
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,035
<i>Verstunkene.</i> Confucius say...

1158
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,514
<i>... verstunkene</i> patient.

1159
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,635
You study X-ray.
Study X-ray, read X-ray.

1160
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,157
Oh, no, wrong room.

1161
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,953
Better room here, Doctor.

1162
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,753
Nice old room. Good room, Doctor.

1163
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,712
Oh, no fair, no fair. Two against one.

1164
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,229
- Doctor!
- Oh, no fair!

1165
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,191
<i>Trois</i> against <i>un.</i>

1166
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,272
<i>Drei</i> against <i>eins.</i>

1167
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,158
- Doctor...
- Bye!

1168
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,113
- Where's Homer?
- I Homer.

1169
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,356
- The jig is up!
- What jig?

1170
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,395
Goodbye!

1171
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,433
I told you we should have put him
in the Psycho Ward!

1172
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,959
What is going on? Who is he?

1173
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,115
He's Homer Flagg.

1174
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,071
- Are you all right, Dr Harris?
- Harris?

1175
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,794
Oh, fine. He jumped me and scalped
me. Last stages of radiation poisoning.

1176
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,831
Let me handle him.
I'll take care of him. Thank you.

1177
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,473
Wait! Such a case I've never seen.

1178
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,989
I would like to proceed
with the examination.

1179
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,872
What are we gonna do?

1180
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,599
Sir, now we are ready
for the examination.

1181
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,278
Over here, please.

1182
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,432
- Normal. Perfect.
- Wait!

1183
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,678
Something in the region
of the left aorta!

1184
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,799
My dear Mr Stone,
there is no vestige, no trace,

1185
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,038
no single real symptom of any
radiation poisoning in that young man.

1186
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,916
Only a <i>verstunkene</i> dollar watch.

1187
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,111
Are you sure you examined
the right man?

1188
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,673
We are positive.

1189
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,917
Here is the full report
of our examination.

1190
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,510
- Here are the X-ray pictures.
- The X-rays, <i>Monsieur</i> Stone.

1191
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,634
And here, Mr Stone, our bill.

1192
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,313
It's witchcraft!

1193
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,552
<i>Yes, Mr Stone?</i>

1194
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,677
Send me in four sluggers
from the Circulation Department!

1195
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,552
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1196
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,475
Hi, Oliver. Here's today's lead.

1197
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,279
I only hope the poor kid can still read.

1198
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,355
"Homer Flagg, laughing child
of the Golden West,

1199
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:58,472
"faced the lengthening shadows
today undaunted..."

1200
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,388
What's the matter with you, Oliver?
You're not listening to me.

1201
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,829
I am sitting here, Miss Cook,

1202
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:11,149
toying with the idea of removing
your heart and stuffing it like an olive!

1203
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,353
Now, now, just hold on, Oliver.
The strain's been too much for you.

1204
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,789
- I'll go get a doctor.
- Doctor!

1205
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,468
You wouldn't know a doctor
if you met one!

1206
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,639
Look! Look at that skeleton!

1207
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,279
Not a bone missing.

1208
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,553
Glowing with health and fat!

1209
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,993
Fat that I paid for! Look at it.

1210
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,992
Rub your nose in it!

1211
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,395
There you are. Homer Flagg!

1212
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,671
Homer Flagg,
the biggest fraud of the century!

1213
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,394
He's out-slickered the city slickers.

1214
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,637
Three weeks on the town
at your expense.

1215
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:50,313
Oh, come on, Oliver,
where's your sense of humour?

1216
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,796
You were going to marry him!

1217
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,591
He would have done to you
what he did to the paper!

1218
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,597
Why, that two-timing little fraud!

1219
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,870
Where's your sense of humour?

1220
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,994
You sent for us, boss?

1221
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:11,193
Well, these four Harvard freshmen
will give Mr Flagg what he deserves.

1222
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,880
There won't be enough left of him
to shove under your fingernail!

1223
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,274
Oh, no, you don't.

1224
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,674
That won't save the <i>Chronicle.</i>

1225
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,360
When I find those two desert rats,
I'll give this story a finish

1226
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,436
that'll dampen every eye
from here to Gowanus Canal!

1227
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,154
Well, you'd better or you'll be in it!

1228
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,677
- What do you want us to do, boss?
- Let us pray.

1229
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,313
Boy, what a celebration, huh, Steve?

1230
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,318
We really made monkeys out of
those specialists, didn't we, Steve?

1231
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,112
That's what they get
for paying attention in class

1232
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,832
and graduating with high honours.

1233
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,317
- Where do we go from here?
- Open up a little office on Park Avenue.

1234
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,429
What for?

1235
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,155
'Cause I'm the first doctor to discover
a cure for radiation poisoning.

1236
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,113
We'll be rich, famous,
never have to go back to Desert Hole.

1237
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,437
Oh, boy!
New York will be our hometown!

1238
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,074
<i>I love New York</i>

1239
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:14,033

1243
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,671

1244
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:39,470
<i>Are as fine as</i>
<i>the family on 107th</i>

1245
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,359
That's Homer Flagg!

1246
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,912

A toast to Oliver Stone, our absent host!

1279
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,949
Yeah, and he'll be very happy to hear

1280
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,036
that we learnt to drink this stuff
twice as fast.

1281
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,549
He's such a kind man, so generous.

1282
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,115
Now, a toast to Dr Stephen Harris,
that's me,

1283
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,516
discoverer of a cure
for that dread disease Desert Holeitis.

1284
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,232
Yeah.

1285
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,834
Who's that?

1286
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:48,633
Probably the Mayo brothers
for a bit of advice.

1287
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,079
You better get into bed.

1288
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,394
And remember, teeter on the brink.

1289
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,557
Don't worry, when I teeter, I teeter, boy!

1290
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,708
Come in.

1291
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,833
- Wally!
- And how's the little sailor?

1292
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,275
Oh, I wouldn't want you to see him
in his present condition.

1293
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,597
Oh, that's all right, Doctor.
I've got a strong stomach.

1294
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,875
Wally!

1295
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,509
Wally!

1296
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,878
How are you, Homer?

1297
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,239
His head's awfully warm.

1298
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,198
The poor kid.

1299
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,479
- Sailor.
- Yes, Captain?

1300
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,672
I know you ran out on me once
to spare me,

1301
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,554
but I was wondering if you could
find it in your heart to marry me now.

1302
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,874
I'll be strong.

1303
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,639
I think you'd better leave now.
His temperature is rising.

1304
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:45,797
Oh, I'm feeling much better.
This morning I heard a bird sing.

1305
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,753
Yeah, I heard the same bird sing,
Homer. Sing Sing.

1306
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,830
The fever's coming back.

1307
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,918
Oh, open a window. I'm burning up.

1308
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,879
98.6. Normal.

1309
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,873
That shows you how crazy he is.
He thinks he's normal.

1310
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,759
I'm drowning.

1311
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,838
- What's this?
- That's his 2:00 medicine.

1312
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,754
No need denying him anything now.
He's teetering on the brink.

1313
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,792
- Oh, and he wants to go formal.
- Yeah, he wants to go formal.

1314
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,558
That shows you
what condition his brain is in,

1315
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,069
doesn't know where he is. Where he is!

1316
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,997
Oh, Hong Kong!

1317
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,917
And sometimes
he doesn't know what he is.

1318
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,600
- This morning he thought he was a dog.
- No!

1319
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:45,631
Oh, not ordinary dog,
but honourable Chinese retriever!

1320
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,072
Come on. Come on, boy. Come on.
Come on.

1321
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,430
Mama wants to pet you goodbye
for the last time.

1322
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,313
That's a nice boy. Nice boy.

1323
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,758
- Wally!
- And you keep your hands off of me,

1324
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,110
- you singing quack!
- Should I try, "Bombs Away"?

1325
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,276
Well, you'd better try something,
because in a couple of hours,

1326
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,231
the whole city of New York
is going to be banging at the door,

1327
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,237
howling for your blood!

1328
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,873
I ain't got enough for everybody.

1329
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,069
- Wally.
- Yes?

1330
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,792
- How much do you know?
- The works.

1331
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,194
The doctors tipped off Oliver.

1332
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,869
Oh, that <i>verstunkene</i> Egelhofer should
have stayed in Vienna with his mouse!

1333
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,434
They'll boil you in oil in Macy's window!

1334
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,710
After you marinate
for a week in Gimbel's!

1335
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,070
You got us into this, Wally.
I told you no doctors.

1336
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,350
- Oh, let's get out of here!
- Let's pack our clothes and...

1337
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,040
Now, come on, wait a minute!
Nobody get hysterical.

1338
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,196
I'm in this as deep as you are,
so is the paper.

1339
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,469
Now, I've got an idea.

1340
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,068
Sit down at that table, you dying swan!

1341
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,031
Do what Wally says.
Sit down at the table.

1342
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:52,516
- Now, I want you to write.
- Write.

1343
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,517
- Write what?
- Your suicide note.

1344
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:57,154
My suicide note!
Oh, no, there must be another way!

1345
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,315
Well, we haven't much time.

1346
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,112
Will you sit down
and write what I tell you?

1347
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,798
"Dear metropolis of New York..."

1348
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,876
- How do you spell "dear"?
- Oh, never mind, I'll do it.

1349
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,230
Now, listen carefully.
We're going to go down to the river.

1350
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,794
I'll photograph Homer jumping,
the <i>Chronicle</i> will print the picture,

1351
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,638
- you'll be waiting below in a rowboat.
- That's great!

1352
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,909
Why can't I be in the boat?

1353
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,598
You will be,
as soon as we pull you out of the river.

1354
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,312
Then, we'll try to figure a way
to sneak you out of town

1355
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,192
while all of New York is crying over you.

1356
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,550
I may be crying a little myself.

1357
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,472
Now, come on, let's go.

1358
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,434
Wally!

1359
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,309
What happens if he can't find me
after I jump in the river?

1360
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,396
- Well, we'll search for you, of course.
- Well, of course.

1361
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,750
And if you do go under,
you'll go under happy,

1362
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,075
knowing that your last story wasn't a lie!

1363
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:40,478
Well, the first lie wasn't a lie, Wally.
I just wanted to see New York!

1364
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,109
Hello.

1365
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,829
What?

1366
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,956
Well, stop crying and read it to me!

1367
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,511
"Dear metropolis of New York,

1368
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,232
"I have enjoyed everything.

1369
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:10,110
"Now there's only one thing
left to enjoy, your river."

1370
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:14,553
Now, I'm gonna see to it that
you get the Journalism Merit Badge,

1371
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:18,434
if you don't call the fire or the police
departments for a couple of hours.

1372
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,198
I called them first.

1373
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,395
What's the matter, boss?

1374
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,829
We've got to see to it
that Homer ends up in that river

1375
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,313
before the police get to him.

1376
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,078
Come on, let's go!

1377
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,597
- Come on, take off your coat.
- Take off my coat! What for? It's cold!

1378
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,551
Come on, this rowboat is costing us
50 cents an hour.

1379
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,999
Fifty cents an hour! Big deal!

1380
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,031
And don't jump until someone sees you.
That's more evidence.

1381
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,151
And swim underwater to the boat
for about 50 yards.

1382
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,430
- Fifty yards? That's all I can swim!
- That's all I can row.

1383
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,993
- Take off your pants!
- Here?

1384
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,031
I thought this was a family newspaper.

1385
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,434
Here, you don't know what you're doing!

1386
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,959
- All right, go!
- No!

1387
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,798
- Come on, take the picture!
- Right.

1388
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,909
Oh, we're sunk!

1389
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,029
- Go on, jump!
- No!

1390
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,912
Jump! By the time you hit the river,
we'll be in the rowboat!

1391
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,359
- Come on!
- Come on!

1392
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,192
I won't do it! I won't do it!

1393
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,072
You can put it in your paper,
I'm not gonna jump!

1394
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,713
It's already in the paper
that you jumped!

1395
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:12,989
We're just waiting for the pictures.

1396
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,680
Well, I can change my mind, can't I?
I'm an American citizen.

1397
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,189
Homer, we'll give you a military funeral!

1398
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,030
- Homer, don't jump.
- Oh, no, I won't.

1399
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,833
- Please, Homer, don't jump.
- No, I won't.

1400
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,394
- Homer, don't jump.
- All right, already, I'm not gonna do it,

1401
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,635
but don't push me, pal!

1402
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,637
Please, for my sake, don't jump!

1403
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,672
All right, you talked me out of it,
but don't push!

1404
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,118
That way. Go get him!

1405
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,034
Oh, no! No!

1406
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,071
- Don't jump, Homer.
- No, I won't!

1407
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,953
What are you following me for?
Why don't you keep the crowd back?

1408
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,513
- Leave me alone, will you!
- Wait a minute!

1409
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,709
Homer, don't jump!

1410
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,877
- Well, that's what I'm trying to tell them!
- Don't jump!

1411
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,799
Help me.

1412
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,149
No!

1413
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,951
Goodbye, Homer!

1414
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,872
May I have a little quiet, please!

1415
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,276
Good people of New York,
fellow citizens,

1416
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,109
we've come to the end of our quest!

1417
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,993
- Bugler!
- Your Honour, step aside, please.

1418
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,838
Listen! They're playing my song!

1419
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,753
It's such a nice ceremony. It kind of
makes me feel like I should lie down.

1420
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,794
You know, the nicest thing the Mayor
ever did was to marry us in secret.

1421
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,037
- Goodbye. Don't work too hard.
- I won't.

1422
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,197
Steve, do you think it's safe
that we hang around New York like this?

1423
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:18,916
I know the Mayor gave us these jobs,
but after all, everybody knew me.

1424
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,350
Homer, you were just a flash in the pan
in old Manhattan.

1425
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,789
In a week,
they will have forgotten your name.

1426
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,911
In fact, you don't even need these.

1427
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,430
Well, if that's the case,
we might as well go to work.

1428
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:41,478
<i>Every street's a boulevard</i>
<i>in old New York</i>

1429
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:47,871
<i>So keep smiling</i>
<i>and you'll never wear a frown</i>

1430
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:54,354
<i>Just remember there's the East Side</i>
<i>and the West Side</i>

1431
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,438
<i>And Uptown and Down</i>
