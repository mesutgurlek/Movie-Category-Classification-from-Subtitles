00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:05,651
''When my veil falls away,
A shyness comes over me''

2
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:13,993
''When l see my sisters in love
l feel the stirrings within me''

3
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,209
''When my eyes fall asleep
Then the dreams come to me''

4
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,374
''And when the man l love
Comes in my dreams''

5
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:28,590
''New seasons of spring come to life
l feel a new stirring within me''

6
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:34,154
''And there is only one image
l hold in my eyes''

7
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:43,189
''When my veil falls away,
A shyness comes over me''

8
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:04,598
''Let us steal a few
moments from life''

9
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:09,676
''To quench this fire on our breaths''

10
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:14,820
''Let us make a new world for us.
A world far away from this world''

11
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:19,965
''When l look into your eyes...''

12
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:24,200
''what magic comes over me?''

13
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:29,520
''When the heart feels lonely,
l feel...''

14
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:35,319
''As if you are looking into my eyes''

15
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:43,670
''When my veil falls away,
A shyness comes over me''

16
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:05,109
''Every moment we share is precious...''

17
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:10,433
''Who knows, what's to happen tomorrow''

18
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:15,470
''Life is such a long journey''

19
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:20,653
''l'm afraid for l do not know
What is to happen''

20
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:24,824
''But ever since
l gave you my heart

21
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:30,061
''The sleep has fled my eyes
Oh these words that you speak!''

22
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:36,152
''l've made myself
A bad reputation''

23
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:44,494
''When the veil falls away,
A shyness comes over her''

24
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:52,835
''When she sees her sisters in love
She feels the stirrings within me''

25
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:27,244
A strong tradition is what makes
our outlook so different.

26
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,373
This song about the spring takes
a whole new look...

27
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:32,458
at the relationship between
man and woman.

28
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,242
Motherhood is a matter of pride.

29
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:45,669
Someday, l'll give you all my love.
That will be my gift to you.

30
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:49,145
l'll wait for that day.

31
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:25,075
''The most beautiful country
in the whole world''

32

''Our Hindustan''

33
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:46,140
''We are her hummingbirds
Her garden is our playground''

34
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:01,431
Ladies and gentlemen...

35
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:05,956
Thanks to your support, today's
programme is a grand real success.

36
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,475
As you know, the monies we have
raised, will be donated to the...

37
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:14,992
Air Force Wives Welfare Association
and for the school.

38
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,949
Thank you for your co-operation.

39
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:20,555
Victory to lndia

40
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,468
Very good

41
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,805
Let your hair loose.
You look great!

42
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:44,526
How went the speech
l wrote for you?

43
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,745
From the applause, the audience
must've appreciated it.

44
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:56,002
Listen...

45
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:59,135
Look, l'm sorry l'm late.

46
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:04,348
ls all this waiting the price for
being in love with a flier?

47
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:06,852
This isn't just a question
of a day or two...

48
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:09,902
this is the question of a lifetime.
- Just think...

49
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:14,077
when a flier is with you,
he's only with you.

50
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:18,496
Not like those civilians who
sit beside the women the love...

51
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:22,801
and worry about paying taxes.
- You pay taxes when you earn.

52
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:26,244
You blow half your
salary on booze.

53
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,092
Drink is for the lion-hearted!

54
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:32,848
l've seen this lion
mewing like a cat.

55
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:39,593
Sweetheart, for the sake
of your love!

56
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:49,175
''The life l wished to live with you
ln loneliness l have lived''

57
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:54,049
''A strange silence pervades...''

58
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:56,832
''Even soliloquy is oppressive''

59
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:03,084
''ln solitude l ask myself...''

60
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:08,646
''Beyond this beauty all around me
Beyond the bounds of time...''

61
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:12,398
''ls there anyone who
is waiting for me...?''

62
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:16,019
There's pathos in his voice.

63
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,177
A certain sensuousness.

64
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,952
He is in search of someone.

65
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,592
Who is he?

66
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,311
lf his voice has swept
you off your feet...

67
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,095
what's to happen once you meet?

68
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,649
Meet...?

69
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:33,703
You will have to.

70
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:36,902
What are you gaping at?
He's my brother.

71
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,903
''For the first time l have seen''

72
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:09,245
''Such a beauty''

73
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,774
''ls she a girl?
Or is she fire?''

74
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:22,038
''This is fire''

75
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,549
''Careful, this is the fire''

76
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:29,234
''You'd rather douse yourself
in water''

77
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:32,677
''Please my youth''

78
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:51,033
''What man is he who cannot
enjoy the fires of youth''

79
00:12:56,908 --> 00:13:01,032
''l have just come of age
lt's new and it's painful''

80
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:05,799
''The thoughts are maddening''

81
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:15,429
''Count your blessings, my boy''

82
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:27,138
''My blessings l have wasted
l have lost everything''

83
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:37,529
''Go away, my hunter
Your bait is hackneyed''

84
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:42,256
''Try using the bait somewhere else''

85
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:47,539
''Not a bird can you trap,
my lanky one''

86
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:52,303
''No girl will get hooked''

87
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:23,067
''How will l overcome
this distance between us??

88
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:27,588
''God alone knows the
plight of my heart''

89
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,632
''You have just seen me
from a distance''

90
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:43,017
''And you are head over heels''

91
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:45,936
''Try holding my hand''

92
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:52,614
''Sonny, try holding my hand''

93
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:59,310
''Once l take your hand,
l will never leave it''

94
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:04,072
''Remember that, my beauty''

95
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:48,049
Hey man! Come down.

96
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:42,585
Hi, sweetheart

97
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,301
l was scared to death.

98
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:49,745
Don't be silly darling

99
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:52,693
When l'm flying,
l feel like a king.

100
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:54,775
And you are the queen of my heart!

101
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:56,695
Gurdip Singh!
- Hi Amit!

102
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,817
You bloody fool!
- How are you?

103
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:02,951
l'm still a bachelor.
You're married, right?

104
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:05,729
Everything all right?
- Fit and fine my boy.

105
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:07,952
Won't you introduce me
to your wife?

106
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,251
Of course. Come on in.

107
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,336
My friend. Amit.

108
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,261
Simran, this my best friend.

109
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:24,564
You've done your bit.
Now get out.

110
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:26,721
What are you saying?
- For a minute. Out.

111
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,020
She's my wife!
- l know. But this is private. Go out

112
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,940
Simran, don't worry!
l'm right out here!

113
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:38,404
Get the flowers out of the way.

114
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,295
You can bring the spring into
my life! Do me one small favour.

115
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,075
After that, l'll serve you
all my life. - What?

116
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,917
l'll tell you...

117
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:53,170
You see, there was someone at your
wedding. She was in a pink dress.

118
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,431
She was very fair.
But not as fair as you...

119
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,958
Who, Chandni?

120
00:17:58,251 --> 00:17:59,258
Chandni!

121
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:03,740
Amit, what are you up to?
- Shut up!

122
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:05,928
l'm coming in!
- Stay out, you ass.

123
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,074
lntroduce me. For once.
And give me her address. Please.

124
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:14,685
My mother is out there. This is
creating the wrong impression!

125
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:15,942
Stop it!

126
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,608
Please! Do this for me.

127
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,622
lt was her birthday
the day before yesterday.

128
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,496
Whose?
- Shut up!

129
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:24,556
Cursed luck! l missed her
by a day before yesterday!

130
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:28,135
l'll give you her address.
- God bless you!

131
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,540
May you mother a hundred sons!

132
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:33,667
You want me to start farming sons?

133
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,829
You ass! What are you staring at?
l'm in love. Don't you see?

134
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:41,799
And l couldn't even send her
flowers on her birthday.

135
00:18:53,863 --> 00:19:00,072
l couldn't wish you on your birthday.
l'm punishing myself for it.

136
00:19:01,926 --> 00:19:06,334
On this day every month,
l'll send you flowers.

137
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:12,769
Flowers with their beauty
and fragrance will say a lot.

138
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:17,904
Should you please,
ask my flowers about me.

139
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:22,947
But l can't yet sign off with
a ''Yours'': Amit.

140
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:40,715
''Amit, the weather is splendid here.
Come over to Kashmir for a few days.''

141
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:43,703
''lt'd be fun: Shekhar''

142
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:48,915
Coming, brother.

143
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:54,644
Do me a favour, darling!
- Whatever you wish.

144
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:58,127
Amit is coming today.
Receive him at the airport.

145
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,673
And you...?
- Duty, darling. Duty.

146
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,457
Flying a sortie to Pathankot.
l'll return in a jiffy.

147
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,597
But l've never met Amit.

148
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,802
This brother of mine is one
in a million. Tall, handsome.

149
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:19,325
There's a sparkle in his eyes.
And what a voice!

150
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,804
He stands apart in a crowd.
You'll have no problem.

151
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,238
You'll recognise him
as soon as you see him.

152
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:29,710
Excuse me, are you Mr Amit?

153
00:20:32,572 --> 00:20:34,195
You should be Shobha?

154
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,492
Shekhar...
- My brother...

155
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,466
Mentions you often.

156
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:41,566
Hasn't he come?
- He sent me to receive you. Come...

157
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:47,125
You say you're Shekhar's brother
and then you start laughing?

158
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:53,736
Yes, there was a dilemma,
now solved after due deliberation.

159
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:59,920
My brother is a year and a half older
than l am. But we've been friends.

160
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,123
We started smoking together.

161
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:06,389
And then drinking. Together.
We shared our first drink.

162
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:11,534
But before that we fell
in love together.

163
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:14,241
With the same girl...
- You know?

164
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:15,809
Good.

165
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:18,408
Before that we used to bathe
together. ln the nude.

166
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,675
Heard that too.
- But you wouldn't have seen...?

167
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,089
We keep reversing roles.

168
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:29,672
Reversing roles...?
l don't understand.

169
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:36,966
When one of us landed in a spot,
the other would play big brother.

170
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:41,004
You'll drive me out of my mind!

171
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:44,483
Just a sample. We're going
to spend a lifetime together.

172
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:48,654
Meaning...?
- You're related to my brother.

173
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:50,530
l'm related to my brother.

174
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,825
That makes us relatives...?

175
00:21:57,553 --> 00:22:03,763
Mummy, this is the famous Mr Amit.
More an actor than a playwright.

176
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,100
This is punishing!

177
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:11,584
Tell me, what would you like to eat?
What do you like the most?

178
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:15,129
Once someone asked me what
my favourite dish is.

179
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:18,616
Punjabi, South lndian, Chinese,
Continental, Greece...

180
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:20,625
You know, what l told him?
- What?

181
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:23,753
The food my mother cooks for me.

182
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:27,227
l'll get you something.

183
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:32,441
Very smart! You've floored Mummy.

184
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:37,656
Don't fall for the cliche.
The floored opponent will rise.

185
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:40,439
Then it's someone else's turn
to get floored.

186
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:43,918
So you see, the cliche
is a cliche after all.

187
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,089
Mother! l've had enough for a day!

188
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:51,836
l thought you'd turn out
to be a serious playwright.

189
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:54,345
But you turned out...
- To be a joker?

190
00:22:54,554 --> 00:22:56,841
l was just doing my duty.
- Duty!

191
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:59,899
Entertaining you
in my brother's absence.

192
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:03,267
So, the sentiments are
solely for your brother?

193
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:06,403
Give or take ten per cent
for my feelings towards you.

194
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:09,286
Thank you for your ten per cent.

195
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:11,025
Keep up the cheer.

196
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:14,152
The percentage will climb till
one day, brother vanishes.

197
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,933
l'm not one of those who disappear.

198
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:20,061
Wherever l am, you will
find the stardust.

199
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:23,119
Not just friends; even my enemies
cannot forget me.

200
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,970
You brag too much.
Come on, embrace me.

201
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,463
Cheers

202
00:24:06,327 --> 00:24:08,721
She isn't dancing.
Break her in.

203
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:17,477
Where is Shekhar?
- Shekhar? Gone for a tipple.

204
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:23,491
This brother of mine boozes a lot.
Drinking, drinking all the time.

205
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,881
Keep him on a leash. Say what,
start tightening the screws.

206
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:32,359
Else, someday he'll go overboard.
Don't say l didn't warn you.

207
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,175
Come on, dance. Don't you know
how to dance?

208
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:43,124
Up here...
l'm dancing one floor up.

209
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,261
Hey sweetheart!

210
00:24:59,505 --> 00:25:02,314
Taught this one?
Now teach her.

211
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:13,369
What's this

212
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:19,625
What's this, Shekhar?
- Booze!

213
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,409
You're drinking too much.

214
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:27,346
Did Amit put you up to this?

215
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:35,267
You don't know, he's a bloody
alcoholic. A born alcoholic.

216
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:39,709
lf you listen to him,
l'm doomed.

217
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,603
What's your name?
- Ramola.

218
00:25:52,024 --> 00:25:54,074
Where do you live?

219
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:56,016
Your telephone number?

220
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,801
Brother, you're great!

221
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:25,761
You're driving you jeep like
you're flying your jet!

222
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:28,621
Let me do it!

223
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:37,900
Slowly! We aren't Air Force, man.

224
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:41,023
We're civilians. Have mercy on us.

225
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:45,469
You're driving too fast!
- Let me do it!

226
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:49,404
lt'll move after it starts.

227
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:52,698
Shift gears.

228
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:01,467
Remember that song we
used to sing in college?

229
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,545
Shut your ears.

230
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:16,053
ln the betel shop
Under my girl's house!

231
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:21,970
Let's make a little merry!
Let's have a few kisses!

232
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,309
Get down. Let me go home.

233
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:04,717
What are you doing?
Think about me!

234
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:06,873
What about me?
Hey brother!

235
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:08,366
Silence!

236
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:13,132
Oh come on,
he's just my brother.

237
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:12,177
You're crying... tell me,
what's your problem?

238
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:18,892
l bashed you up...
- When, where?

239
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:26,750
15 years ago. You were a little one.
When you tore Maya's letter.

240
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:30,017
What did l tear?
- Maya's letter...

241
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:39,331
No! l pushed you. And you hit
the wall. And you cracked your nut.

242
00:29:39,994 --> 00:29:43,086
No! l bashed you up!

243
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,267
Where's Maya these days?

244
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:55,696
Maya? Bloody Maya!

245
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:06,016
Maya must struggling to
tide the seas of life!

246
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:12,271
Right now, with her
four kids and husband in tow...

247
00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:18,116
she's waiting for a train
at a seedy station!

248
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,966
Trains are never
on time in lndia.

249
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,460
Right.

250
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:33,136
Write a play about it.

251
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:40,018
l'm a flier. l have nothing
to do with trains.

252
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:44,777
But still, l'll say
trains are a big problem.

253
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:47,520
Write a play.

254
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:54,678
Where's paper?

255
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:56,076
Paper?

256
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,449
You tore it!
That's why l bashed you up.

257
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,031
So what?

258
00:31:08,972 --> 00:31:10,667
You're my elder.

259
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:15,464
Look, if you're my elder...

260
00:31:15,923 --> 00:31:17,973
then l'm younger to you.

261
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:23,528
When l'm younger to you,
you're my elder.

262
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:26,931
So what, if you bashed me up?

263
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:35,866
Remember, once you were angry with me
about Maya. You left me and went away.

264
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:42,511
Don't leave me and go away.

265
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:47,926
Don't leave me!

266
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,032
l'm telling you the truth,

267
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,226
Not just one Maya...

268
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,596
l'll give up a thousand Mayas
for your sake!

269
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,723
Brother, don't leave me!

270
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:06,103
Don't leave me!

271
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,433
Don't cry, brother!
You're my younger brother.

272
00:32:13,272 --> 00:32:15,322
l'll never leave you!

273
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,440
l never will!

274
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:27,479
l have cried out your name
in these valleys. Chandni.

275
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,963
Ask these flowers,
if you won't believe.

276
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:34,923
All of yesterday, l sat writing
your name and mine.

277
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:40,338
Loneliness and solitude
are two words.

278
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:45,207
But together, they mean a lifetime.

279
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,220
ln a moment, the quest is transformed
into a world of happiness.

280
00:32:52,895 --> 00:32:58,903
Try it out: Amit.
Amit, who is mine no more.

281
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:43,170
Turn on the hot water.
- Okay.

282
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:46,644
All right?

283
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:53,172
This is fun!

284
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,684
Amit, pick up that soap.

285
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:02,284
l'm not picking up any soap.

286
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:08,186
Back in the hostel bathroom,
no one would pick up the soap!

287
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,183
And once when we were bathing naked,
Maya suddenly barged in.

288
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:19,659
And we covered our eyes in shock!

289
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:23,836
She wouldn't look at us for a week!

290
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,170
With you around,
l'm reliving my childhood.

291
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,821
Stay back for some more time...

292
00:38:35,343 --> 00:38:37,973
For your sake, l'd stay back
for the rest of my life.

293
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:42,595
But something urgent has cropped up.
l have to meet someone.

294
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,774
The soap...
- You so-and-so!

295
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:50,735
What a strange pair.

296
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:54,761
Mad, both of them...
- That spirit is rare.

297
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,903
l'm not anxious for you any longer.
- How come.

298
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:03,066
After what l've seen,
l'll say you're lucky.

299
00:39:03,596 --> 00:39:05,990
They'll take good care of you.

300
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:13,116
Amit, won't you let us get married?
Why don't you find yourself a girl?

301
00:39:13,328 --> 00:39:15,200
We could get married together.
We could honeymoon together.

302
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:16,586
Excuse me!

303
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:20,931
l'll let you know the day
l get my hands on a girl.

304
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:32,164
Call me when you reach Bombay.

305
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:35,185
You should look for a suitable boy
for Chandni if you could.

306
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:36,441
All right.

307
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:39,768
lt makes me sad when l think how
empty the house will become...

308
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:44,215
once she goes away.
- A daughter always leaves.

309
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:51,521
Some day she will have to leave.
Pray that she gets a good boy...

310
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:53,954
and that she likes him.

311
00:39:56,323 --> 00:40:00,909
Look into her eyes when you talk.
She's fond of young men.

312
00:40:01,328 --> 00:40:05,251
Just put in your best.
She'll take care of the rest.

313
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:08,972
l'll keep trying.
- This play of yours...

314
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:11,744
is going to be a costly exercise.
- Let's not go into that again.

315
00:40:11,928 --> 00:40:15,151
l've written it. That's all.
- Producing the play will cost a lot.

316
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:21,338
Lose this one and we end up begging
on the steps of the Jama Masjid.

317
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:24,536
How tough is she?
- Tough cookie.

318
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:28,707
ln Delhi, art, literature and culture
are spawned in her drawing room.

319
00:40:29,098 --> 00:40:30,793
Get it?
- Yes.

320
00:40:31,183 --> 00:40:32,427
Here we are.

321
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:37,751
Remember? Look into her eyes...
- Yes...

322
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,450
So what have you brought for me
from Mauritius?

323
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:47,340
You could've sent your wife
to buy it.

324
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:52,759
l'd pawn you off at the junk dealer's
and l wouldn't even ask for a receipt!

325
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:57,911
Let's talk later.
l have visitors.

326
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:02,074
Hello Ms Achala...
- Hello...

327
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:04,301
My friend, Amit.

328
00:41:05,002 --> 00:41:07,632
He's a playwright.
He has just written a new play.

329
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,846
From your looks, you'd be writing
only romantic plays.

330
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:15,977
Switch on the charm.

331
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:17,851
Well, till date...

332
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:19,596
May l sit?

333
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,013
Till date, my pangs of joblessness
haunts my plays.

334
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,774
Now that l've met you, l might write
some about the pangs of passions.

335
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:32,668
Where did you acquire that
voice of yours?

336
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:34,926
Where did you acquire
this beauty from?

337
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:38,706
A question isn't answered
with a question.

338
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,051
When a question answers itself,
it's no longer a question.

339
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,009
The pain... that's very much
a part of you?

340
00:41:46,502 --> 00:41:48,931
Pleasure is fleeting.

341
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:52,057
The pain you always remember.

342
00:41:52,515 --> 00:41:57,338
You sound so lonely...
- To be lonely isn't what it is...

343
00:41:58,632 --> 00:42:00,540
to live with loneliness.

344
00:42:00,856 --> 00:42:02,906
lf you prefer, l'll go out...

345
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:06,408
lt makes no difference
whether you're in or out.

346
00:42:08,503 --> 00:42:10,968
So when will you
read me your play?

347
00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:14,092
Whenever you wish...
- When you're coming next...?

348
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:18,119
You tell me. The likes of us
have nothing to do.

349
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:20,632
l have all the time in the world.

350
00:42:21,085 --> 00:42:24,795
But l'm so busy!
l haven't even time for myself.

351
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:27,721
Heard that?
- Yes.

352
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,752
Come over with your drama
tomorrow evening.

353
00:42:32,138 --> 00:42:34,188
Let's give it a reading
and a rehearsal.

354
00:42:34,606 --> 00:42:37,628
l'll call up a few artists.
- Sure

355
00:42:37,977 --> 00:42:40,442
Thank you very much.

356
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,434
l just asked you to hold
her attention while you spoke.

357
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:51,913
But you pounced upon her.
- l was following you in toto.

358
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:55,033
Don't you be too sure of yourself.
Had l not interrupted you...

359
00:42:55,425 --> 00:42:58,518
l would've had to return alone.
- Fait accompli. That's what matters.

360
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:00,878
Now it's your turn to deliver.
- Deliver what?

361
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,383
Chandni. The introduction.

362
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:06,231
Else, l'll drown myself in the waters
of the fountain in Hauz Qaji!

363
00:43:07,243 --> 00:43:13,216
What with this height, even a river
wouldn't be enough to drown you.

364
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:15,682
l'll introduce you...
- Thanks.

365
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:20,754
Life isn't mere breathing to live.
Breathing is no more than a habit.

366
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,726
You people bound by customs
and traditions...

367
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:28,159
Well now that you took a break...

368
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,070
Take the centre stage.

369
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:33,267
And not rage. Just a bit of
intensity, a bit of tension.

370
00:43:34,353 --> 00:43:36,225
And hands out of your pocket.

371
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:37,376
l'll try once more.

372
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:41,536
Make sure Chandni is invited.

373
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:47,171
Life isn't mere breathing to live.
Breathing is no more than a habit.

374
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:53,770
A big zero. That is what you are.
Zero thou art of zero becometh!

375
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:57,083
You cannot even think
what you want to think.

376
00:43:57,397 --> 00:43:58,819
You cannot speak,
what you wish to.

377
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,768
Live you cannot
as you wish to live.

378
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:05,940
Scream you may, but you will never
hear the echoes of your screams.

379
00:44:07,476 --> 00:44:11,671
Love, friendship, religion,
patriotism...

380
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:14,288
these are hollow words.

381
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:16,994
They have nothing to do
with reality.

382
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:19,288
But there's still time.

383
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,104
Listen to him carefully.
He's calling you.

384
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:24,879
Do not be afraid.

385
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:27,218
Do not be ashamed of your own self.

386
00:44:27,948 --> 00:44:29,714
Raise your voice.

387
00:44:29,964 --> 00:44:31,800
Raise your voice and say that
you are free.

388
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:33,815
Wrest the right of refusal.

389
00:44:34,134 --> 00:44:38,258
Say that you refuse to live this
life of shams, lies and frauds.

390
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:44,169
Throw open your windows.
Get out there! And scream!

391
00:44:44,493 --> 00:44:45,985
Say we are free!

392
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,567
Let the voices ring!
We are free!

393
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:52,722
We are free!

394
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:06,213
This silence is eerie.
- Of silence is born speech.

395
00:45:10,629 --> 00:45:13,296
Then l have something
to speak to you about.

396
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,166
Tell me just what l wish to hear.

397
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:27,059
Can it be expressed in words?

398
00:45:35,654 --> 00:45:37,349
Who is it...?

399
00:45:47,124 --> 00:45:50,003
A bouquet and a letter. For you.

400
00:45:51,295 --> 00:45:52,302
From?

401
00:45:54,423 --> 00:45:57,516
Either a girl or a nabob.
Want me to read it out?

402
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:00,121
Go on.

403
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:13,986
That girl of yours!
Got it?

404
00:46:14,652 --> 00:46:16,975
Great!

405
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:23,373
''The darkness last night was
lit up by the sunset red''

406
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:26,222
''Was it the magic
of the night alone?''

407
00:46:26,747 --> 00:46:30,871
''l want to find out. Shall we meet
at Lodhi Gardens tomorrow?''

408
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:33,455
Lovely!
Made my life!

409
00:46:33,977 --> 00:46:40,258
Come joy, come sorrow,
l'll take on the whole world!

410
00:46:41,136 --> 00:46:44,431
l'm elated! l could even
embrace you. Come on!

411
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:48,608
What?

412
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:51,033
You've dropped your towel
... the towel.

413
00:47:43,907 --> 00:47:49,536
''The blue sky has fallen asleep''

414
00:48:51,683 --> 00:48:55,807
''The night is wet with dewdrops''

415
00:48:56,202 --> 00:48:58,940
''Lips quiver''

416
00:49:04,683 --> 00:49:12,007
''Her heartbeats are trying to say
what she cannot say''

417
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:25,013
''The breeze sings a soulful tune''

418
00:49:25,468 --> 00:49:29,177
''Time passes too slowly''

419
00:49:30,264 --> 00:49:35,644
''The blue sky has fallen asleep''

420
00:50:09,192 --> 00:50:17,488
''lnto my arms you came shyly''

421
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:30,351
''As shyly as the moon treads
softly out of the clouds''

422
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:43,771
''ln this solitude, you and l''

423
00:50:44,296 --> 00:50:48,420
''Even the earth is silent''

424
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:54,334
''The blue sky has fallen asleep''

425
00:52:57,228 --> 00:52:59,171
What are you doing?

426
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:05,429
l love doing this.

427
00:54:33,207 --> 00:54:35,257
Shall l tell you something, Shekhar?

428
00:54:36,335 --> 00:54:41,158
Every time you go up with a squadron,
my heart misses a beat.

429
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:45,336
Never put too much trust in life.

430
00:54:46,415 --> 00:54:50,894
You and your words...
- You'll remember my words, won't you?

431
00:54:59,345 --> 00:55:00,968
You're crying?

432
00:55:01,186 --> 00:55:05,832
No, you're a soldier's lover.

433
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:08,274
You're my life!

434
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:16,090
Didn't you just say not to
put too much trust in life?

435
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,784
Remember one thing.

436
00:55:21,658 --> 00:55:23,909
l've told you this before.
And l'll tell you once again.

437
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:32,148
Whether l'm on land or in air,
l love you very much!

438
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:42,332
Hello.
- Yes Papa?

439
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:45,458
Put your Mummy on the line.
- Mummy isn't at home.

440
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:47,899
Any message?
- Yes my dear.

441
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:51,017
l'll give her the message.
Or is it something private?

442
00:55:51,341 --> 00:55:56,235
No. lt's about you.
l've fixed your marriage.

443
00:55:58,361 --> 00:55:59,369
What?

444
00:55:59,752 --> 00:56:03,189
Hello...
Can you hear me?

445
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:06,317
Yes.... yes Papa.

446
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,071
He's a very good boy.
Tell Mummy that everything is fixed.

447
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:17,711
What is the matter, my child?
Tell me.

448
00:56:18,173 --> 00:56:21,953
Papa, you won't get angry with me?
- What is it?

449
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:26,479
Papa, l love somebody.

450
00:56:26,793 --> 00:56:30,051
Oh! My God!
You should've told me, dear.

451
00:56:30,685 --> 00:56:32,416
You've put me in an awkward position.

452
00:56:34,856 --> 00:56:36,551
l'm sorry, papa.

453
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,444
May l...?

454
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:43,439
All right. l won't take
any decision now.

455
00:56:43,824 --> 00:56:45,625
lf it makes you happy,
it's fine with me.

456
00:56:47,717 --> 00:56:50,110
Oh papa! l love you.

457
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,632
l love you.
- l love you too, my child.

458
00:57:00,924 --> 00:57:02,452
l love you, Amit.

459
00:57:02,663 --> 00:57:05,755
Brother, where have you been?

460
00:57:07,668 --> 00:57:09,647
l've done you a favour.

461
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:12,355
Make it fast, Amit.
- Don't rush me.

462
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:15,479
Just listen.
l've found a girl.

463
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:20,689
Name the day, and we'll
enter wedlock together.

464
00:57:21,778 --> 00:57:22,785
Very good.

465
00:57:22,995 --> 00:57:25,909
Look Amit, l'm in a hurry. Bye.

466
00:57:29,147 --> 00:57:30,734
Must be in a real hurry.

467
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:54,057
Now that l have found your love,
l want nothing else out of life.

468
00:57:55,493 --> 00:57:57,543
When are we seeing each other?
- Tomorrow.

469
00:57:58,273 --> 00:58:00,667
Then, l'll introduce you
to my brother.

470
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:05,181
You know, our falling in love has
solved a big problem for my brother.

471
00:58:08,145 --> 00:58:12,826
He's still a bachelor.
He wants us to get married together.

472
00:58:14,852 --> 00:58:17,696
News has just come in
from the Ferozpur sector.

473
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:20,478
Four enemy planes have been
shot down.

474
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:26,182
The mission was led by
Sqn Ldr Shekhar Malhotra.

475
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:32,363
But there is sad news too.
Sqn Ldr Shekhar Malhotra...

476
00:58:32,822 --> 00:58:36,567
staked his own life and
set a new example for bravery.

477
00:58:36,853 --> 00:58:38,476
He has committed
the ultimate sacrifice.

478
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,654
Mummy!

479
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:04,476
The last battle snatched
away our father.

480
00:59:05,006 --> 00:59:07,056
l did not cry.

481
00:59:08,134 --> 00:59:10,872
My mother couldn't bear
the sorrow.

482
00:59:13,348 --> 00:59:16,441
l did not cry.

483
00:59:20,092 --> 00:59:24,085
Because to me, my brother...

484
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:33,118
was a mother, a father, my friend...
he was everything to me.

485
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,695
But...

486
00:59:46,646 --> 00:59:49,454
But today Chandni, l'm devastated!

487
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:55,021
l've been orphaned.

488
00:59:59,227 --> 01:00:04,394
Don't say that, Amit.

489
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:11,981
l'm here. For you.

490
01:00:32,143 --> 01:00:37,772
''Amit, don't cry.
You are my small brother''

491
01:00:39,024 --> 01:00:40,647
''l won't leave you''

492
01:00:42,534 --> 01:00:45,272
''l won't''

493
01:02:28,926 --> 01:02:30,727
Sqn Ldr Shekhar Malhotra

494
01:03:14,388 --> 01:03:16,259
How could this have happened?

495
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:21,122
You must have courage.

496
01:03:21,513 --> 01:03:23,906
lf you'll lose courage,
who will console us?

497
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:28,151
You have to take care of Shobha.

498
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:34,466
l'm broken, defeated...

499
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:38,990
l can't face life anymore.

500
01:03:41,324 --> 01:03:43,374
l can do no more.

501
01:03:44,452 --> 01:03:46,502
Don't say that.

502
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:52,925
Oh the dreams l had
... the hopes l had...

503
01:03:56,027 --> 01:03:58,077
Shobha would be married someday.

504
01:04:04,264 --> 01:04:06,314
Who is to blame?

505
01:04:07,392 --> 01:04:09,193
Whatever had to happen has happened.

506
01:04:09,825 --> 01:04:13,605
You don't know, son.
You know nothing.

507
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:18,127
That which should never
have happened, has happened.

508
01:04:20,947 --> 01:04:22,997
How do l tell you this?

509
01:04:25,118 --> 01:04:27,168
But tell you l must.

510
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:35,855
Shobha is carrying Shekhar's baby.

511
01:04:39,716 --> 01:04:41,766
What will happen now, Amit?

512
01:04:42,844 --> 01:04:44,894
What will happen to Shobha?

513
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:15,932
We all stand at
a strange crossroads.

514
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:21,726
You... l... your mother...

515
01:05:25,595 --> 01:05:27,645
We cannot console each other.

516
01:05:30,878 --> 01:05:33,201
We cannot even wipe
each other's tears.

517
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:47,456
My brother has left me with
a feeling of emptiness.

518
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:54,543
Your sorrow is much more
than mine, but...

519
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,335
you have a whole life
in front of you.

520
01:06:01,047 --> 01:06:06,356
What l do with this life?
Where do l go?

521
01:06:08,972 --> 01:06:11,022
How will l live this life?

522
01:06:11,822 --> 01:06:16,301
Wish for whatever you might,
live you will have to.

523
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,310
With whose support?

524
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,400
With what hope?

525
01:06:31,217 --> 01:06:32,639
For whom?

526
01:06:37,647 --> 01:06:39,590
Why think like that?

527
01:06:41,713 --> 01:06:45,493
You are still young, beautiful.

528
01:06:48,143 --> 01:06:51,200
lf you wish, you can marry.

529
01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:09,442
l once gave myself to a man.
He was Shekhar.

530
01:07:10,908 --> 01:07:12,958
l was to marry him.

531
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:20,952
Even after his death his name
will remain with me.

532
01:07:24,395 --> 01:07:26,302
Who will marry me?

533
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:31,720
Tell me... give me an answer.

534
01:07:35,933 --> 01:07:39,856
lt is easy to say,
it is easy to reason.

535
01:07:43,928 --> 01:07:49,451
But to live through it,
that's tough. Very tough.

536
01:07:51,852 --> 01:07:56,403
Who will marry me? Tell me.

537
01:07:58,943 --> 01:08:00,922
Who will marry me?

538
01:08:02,835 --> 01:08:06,130
Tell me, would you marry me?

539
01:08:07,632 --> 01:08:10,299
Shekhar's death has
turned me to stone.

540
01:08:11,385 --> 01:08:13,435
l came here to console someone...

541
01:08:14,027 --> 01:08:16,563
ln the process, l have lost
all my happiness.

542
01:08:17,538 --> 01:08:20,725
''l wish l could shower all
the happiness in the world on you''

543
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,897
''But l have nothing but
painful memories with me''

544
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:30,111
''Every time you feel your heartbeat,
think of me; l'm remembering you''

545
01:08:31,267 --> 01:08:33,246
''We can't be together
for the rest of our lives''

546
01:08:33,422 --> 01:08:35,472
''But for a while, we were
in love with each other''

547
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,870
''Swear this, Chandni. Swear it
by the love we shared.''

548
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:40,199
''Swear it by the promises we made.
Swear it by those memories...''

549
01:08:40,477 --> 01:08:42,420
that you will forget me''
Forget me Chandni''

550
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,274
''l am not unhappy that
you have deserted me''

551
01:08:52,051 --> 01:08:56,874
''But l'm sad that l've lost
all confidence in love''

552
01:08:57,474 --> 01:08:59,453
Chandni!

553
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:39,104
''The blue sky has fallen asleep''

554
01:10:39,277 --> 01:11:00,230
''All night l have gazed
at the moon through my tears''

555
01:11:01,347 --> 01:11:08,019
''Life is a vast lonely valley''

556
01:11:08,646 --> 01:11:16,942
''l have suffered but little
You will live in sorrow all your life''

557
01:11:17,926 --> 01:11:23,200
''The blue sky has fallen asleep''

558
01:12:20,106 --> 01:12:27,501
''Deep in the valleys of my memory
Echo the tales from my past''

559
01:12:28,726 --> 01:12:35,671
''My yesterday's lover
ls a stranger today''

560
01:12:36,233 --> 01:12:44,529
''Today l still thirst for him
The sorrow lies deep within me''

561
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:51,832
''The blue sky has fallen asleep''

562
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:28,668
How's the other patient?

563
01:15:37,152 --> 01:15:40,031
How is my wife?
- She's okay.

564
01:15:41,323 --> 01:15:43,018
But...
- What?

565
01:15:44,347 --> 01:15:46,290
But l couldn't save the child.

566
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:52,748
l'm sorry

567
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:56,233
Can l see my wife?

568
01:15:56,964 --> 01:15:57,971
Sure.

569
01:17:00,569 --> 01:17:06,233
Be brave, Shobha. You will have
to put up with this cruel fate.

570
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:12,378
l am not trying to console you.

571
01:17:15,167 --> 01:17:17,631
ln pain and in sorrow,
l will always be with you.

572
01:17:23,786 --> 01:17:25,208
Have courage.

573
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:31,115
Have courage, Shobha.
l am with you.

574
01:17:51,661 --> 01:17:53,711
l think l'm quite late.

575
01:18:00,003 --> 01:18:02,053
Well, what are you looking at?

576
01:18:02,436 --> 01:18:09,690
Tell me Chandni, are you never
angry or cross with me?

577
01:18:11,473 --> 01:18:13,168
l don't follow you.

578
01:18:13,906 --> 01:18:18,729
ln every other family, they
have such delightful fights...

579
01:18:19,155 --> 01:18:22,556
broken glass, flying vessels...
and here, it's a complete silence.

580
01:18:23,221 --> 01:18:26,338
Let's start from tomorrow.
- Why tomorrow?

581
01:18:26,454 --> 01:18:29,156
Let's begin today. Right now.

582
01:18:29,547 --> 01:18:34,370
Look, l'm home late. And you
don't even ask why am l so late.

583
01:18:34,865 --> 01:18:38,123
There are these pretty nurses
and interns in the hospital.

584
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:41,178
Any other wife would have
given me a thorough grilling.

585
01:18:41,711 --> 01:18:46,428
Any more questions, and
l'll start with the crockery.

586
01:18:47,377 --> 01:18:48,621
That's it.

587
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:50,851
That's the spirit.

588
01:18:51,096 --> 01:18:55,848
By the way, why are you late?
- An emergency case came up.

589
01:18:56,309 --> 01:18:57,317
What happened?

590
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,750
A couple had met
with an accident.

591
01:18:59,959 --> 01:19:03,218
The man wasn't hurt badly.
But his wife was serious.

592
01:19:03,608 --> 01:19:05,374
Who were they?

593
01:19:05,694 --> 01:19:07,744
Some playwright, Amit Malhotra.

594
01:19:25,505 --> 01:19:31,064
''The one dream l saw,
has become so many dreams now''

595
01:19:40,591 --> 01:19:47,357
''Roses too distance us''

596
01:19:56,892 --> 01:20:03,457
''My heart beats to your song''

597
01:20:05,128 --> 01:20:11,338
''Shyness cross'd my lips sealed''

598
01:20:12,915 --> 01:20:19,681
''The light of your love will
shine like a thousand lamps''

599
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:36,161
''Roses too distance us''

600
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:44,883
Good morning

601
01:20:47,497 --> 01:20:50,969
This is what made me fall
head-over-heels in love with you.

602
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,816
You wouldn't have met her.

603
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:56,179
My wife, Chandni.

604
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:01,848
She tends the wounds l salve.

605
01:21:03,069 --> 01:21:05,119
Why are you standing there
with the bouquet?

606
01:21:05,397 --> 01:21:07,447
Give it to the man
you bought it for.

607
01:21:11,861 --> 01:21:13,213
Thank you.

608
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:16,589
What you have done isn't right.

609
01:21:19,613 --> 01:21:25,656
You know that roses are my weakness.
And you gave the roses away?

610
01:21:26,529 --> 01:21:30,380
l've have the first right to them.
Right Mr Amit?

611
01:21:32,994 --> 01:21:35,044
Won't you ask these poor flowers?

612
01:21:36,331 --> 01:21:40,810
Even in their silence, the colour
and the fragrance have a lot to say.

613
01:21:41,405 --> 01:21:44,664
See how skillfully
he skirted the issue?

614
01:21:45,228 --> 01:21:47,799
Playing with words,
is his profession.

615
01:21:48,356 --> 01:21:51,935
He can corner anyone
with words.

616
01:21:52,979 --> 01:21:55,338
Now Mr Amit, do you remember
how the accident occurred?

617
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:59,783
A man's memories.
lt devastates a man.

618
01:22:00,869 --> 01:22:03,961
lt's difficult to get
rid of these memories.

619
01:22:06,082 --> 01:22:11,356
Those memories must have something
to do with your heart.

620
01:22:12,722 --> 01:22:14,973
Chandni, have you met his wife?

621
01:22:15,467 --> 01:22:17,517
No. l've just come in...
- And l barged in...?

622
01:22:19,707 --> 01:22:23,345
No flowers for Mrs Amit?
Very bad.

623
01:22:25,095 --> 01:22:28,638
May l borrow one flower from you?
- You may have the entire bouquet.

624
01:22:29,022 --> 01:22:32,458
Not at all. As of now, you have
the right to this bouquet.

625
01:22:33,193 --> 01:22:35,243
One flower is enough.

626
01:22:37,364 --> 01:22:40,172
Give this to Mrs Amit.

627
01:22:43,377 --> 01:22:45,249
l'll see you later.

628
01:22:51,997 --> 01:22:54,592
Good morning, Mrs Malhotra.
- Good morning, doctor.

629
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:57,589
l want to introduce
my beautiful wife to meet you.

630
01:23:03,431 --> 01:23:05,268
She had bought her ticket.

631
01:23:05,586 --> 01:23:09,367
But l brought her back for
that Amit's sake.

632
01:23:10,383 --> 01:23:11,734
What a pair!

633
01:23:11,947 --> 01:23:14,861
How do they say it?
Made for each other!

634
01:23:16,292 --> 01:23:20,416
Now l shall leave you to criticise
your respective husbands.

635
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:29,456
He's very humorous.
And he's so warm and friendly.

636
01:23:32,697 --> 01:23:36,513
You must've fallen for his charm.

637
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:41,967
l haven't an inkling what
makes him happy.

638
01:23:42,255 --> 01:23:43,950
Your company maybe?

639
01:23:46,182 --> 01:23:50,105
What did he find so special in me?
- He'd know better.

640
01:23:50,805 --> 01:23:55,972
But now that we have met,
l feel as if you're familiar.

641
01:23:56,819 --> 01:24:04,914
But l feel a sense of surprise.
ls there the hand of destiny?

642
01:24:06,377 --> 01:24:08,284
Even if there is,
l shall accept destiny.

643
01:24:08,497 --> 01:24:09,776
You mean...?

644
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,205
At least, l'll get
to know you better.

645
01:24:12,633 --> 01:24:18,120
When can we go home?
- Any time you wish.

646
01:24:18,784 --> 01:24:21,178
But you must take care of
your wife for some time.

647
01:24:21,634 --> 01:24:25,415
She should not undergo any
mental or physical exertion.

648
01:24:26,918 --> 01:24:30,982
Send her to me once a week
for check ups.

649
01:24:31,402 --> 01:24:33,997
l understand, doctor.
- Okay.

650
01:25:46,998 --> 01:25:48,834
For sometime, there's
been something on my mind.

651
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:51,892
What?
- You have taken on...

652
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:54,605
the mantle of your brother.
ln the beginning...

653
01:25:54,923 --> 01:25:58,146
l used to respect you for doing this.
Now l have started liking you.

654
01:25:59,406 --> 01:26:03,400
l am glad to hear that.
And relieved.

655
01:26:27,802 --> 01:26:31,381
ls your master at home?
Anyone else at home?

656
01:26:38,681 --> 01:26:42,355
Who were you calling?
- An old friend...

657
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:47,924
You have many friends here.
- And no dearth of enemies either.

658
01:26:50,465 --> 01:26:52,372
ls that a dig at me?

659
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:55,633
Time Shobha, time.

660
01:26:57,068 --> 01:27:00,363
Time, which we refer to as destiny,
or at times as accident.

661
01:27:01,656 --> 01:27:04,251
But all the time, it chases you.
Like your shadow.

662
01:27:05,896 --> 01:27:11,560
l find myself a pawn in Time's plot.
- lf so, why not exploit it?

663
01:27:12,222 --> 01:27:17,258
Meaning...?
- Let me play the dutiful husband.

664
01:27:18,895 --> 01:27:23,019
Let me take you shopping today.
- l don't mind shopping.

665
01:27:25,151 --> 01:27:27,201
But l don't like the word ''duty''.

666
01:27:28,627 --> 01:27:32,751
You don't like ''duty''?
Cut it out, then.

667
01:27:34,535 --> 01:27:35,779
How about ''debt''?

668
01:27:37,733 --> 01:27:42,841
Let's pamper the lady.
Show us the best you have.

669
01:27:46,005 --> 01:27:48,672
No, lighter shades
... like that white.

670
01:27:49,133 --> 01:27:50,661
This will do.

671
01:27:53,027 --> 01:27:54,722
That one down there...

672
01:28:05,226 --> 01:28:06,470
That one.

673
01:28:08,736 --> 01:28:10,016
May l see that one?

674
01:28:12,073 --> 01:28:13,909
The black one.

675
01:28:23,543 --> 01:28:24,550
Chandni

676
01:28:28,966 --> 01:28:31,016
l want to talk to you.

677
01:28:32,927 --> 01:28:34,764
Where? Tell me.

678
01:28:36,055 --> 01:28:38,105
Please pack these for me.

679
01:28:42,311 --> 01:28:44,077
How are you now?
- Fine.

680
01:28:44,397 --> 01:28:45,676
On a shopping spree?
- Likewise.

681
01:28:45,857 --> 01:28:47,907
You left me with those sarees.

682
01:28:48,221 --> 01:28:50,271
l saw her and l thought
l'd say hello

683
01:28:51,001 --> 01:28:55,623
l'm out to lighten my husband's purse
today. l hope you'll do it too.

684
01:28:56,909 --> 01:28:58,746
My packet, please.

685
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:02,258
l have to meet a friend at five.
At the lnter Continental.

686
01:29:02,541 --> 01:29:05,005
l'm getting late.
Excuse me.

687
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:07,857
Do drop in at our place sometime.

688
01:29:10,952 --> 01:29:17,518
She reacted as if we caught her
shop-lifting. Don't you think so?

689
01:29:18,598 --> 01:29:20,849
And the way you charged at her...
just like a policeman.

690
01:29:21,934 --> 01:29:23,984
Now come on and do your ''duty''.

691
01:29:25,063 --> 01:29:26,235
The check.

692
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:28,322
Finished shopping already?

693
01:29:34,447 --> 01:29:36,283
What time is your appointment
with the doctor?

694
01:29:36,532 --> 01:29:38,582
At five.
- l'll drop you there.

695
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:41,363
Aren't you coming with me?
- l just remembered.

696
01:29:41,746 --> 01:29:44,483
There's something urgent. l guess
l'll have to take care of it.

697
01:29:44,874 --> 01:29:47,611
What's the time now?
- Four thirty.

698
01:29:48,802 --> 01:29:50,639
l'll be there too early.
What will l do there?

699
01:29:50,922 --> 01:29:54,702
Chat up the doctor.
l have to be there by five.

700
01:29:55,093 --> 01:29:57,143
l might just make it
after dropping you.

701
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:32,517
Amit! lt's you!

702
01:30:32,839 --> 01:30:35,647
Where were you so long?
Have you forgotten me completely?

703
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:39,608
l heard you've married. Didn't you
spare as much as a thought for me?

704
01:30:40,555 --> 01:30:42,356
At the least you should've
invited me to the wedding.

705
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:46,351
l would've vetted your choice.
l guess she must be pretty?

706
01:30:47,436 --> 01:30:50,529
Then l heard, you had an accident.
Are you all right now?

707
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:52,963
Why are you looking away from me?

708
01:30:53,624 --> 01:30:56,159
Oh by the way, congratulations!
Your play has been nominated...

709
01:30:56,474 --> 01:31:00,503
for the Academy Awards.
And don't l keep tabs on you?

710
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:03,042
l watch you on tv,
l hear you on radio.

711
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:07,205
You're there in all the committees.
You're famous! Just like me.

712
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:11,030
Oh, l hear you've bought a big house.
But you haven't invited me for lunch.

713
01:31:11,419 --> 01:31:13,469
When are you inviting me?
- Ms Achala, if you will excuse me...

714
01:31:13,678 --> 01:31:17,044
l'll see you some other time.
- l'm waiting for the invitation!

715
01:31:18,718 --> 01:31:20,210
Hi Chandni!

716
01:31:20,803 --> 01:31:24,405
l'm seeing you after ages!
Where have you been?

717
01:31:24,974 --> 01:31:27,368
Here for an appointment
with your doctor?

718
01:31:28,102 --> 01:31:32,226
The two of you still
look like two lovebirds.

719
01:31:32,969 --> 01:31:38,942
You're looking great! The saree
suits you. And what a lovely shade!

720
01:31:39,572 --> 01:31:41,622
Where did you buy this one?

721
01:31:42,075 --> 01:31:47,182
You look worried. Are you seeing
your doctor, or is it someone else?

722
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,649
You aren't to be seen
in the parties nowadays.

723
01:31:51,111 --> 01:31:53,706
My husband keeps asking about you.

724
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:56,564
And l don't know a thing about you!

725
01:31:57,716 --> 01:31:59,766
The day after tomorrow,
the Lambas are throwing a party.

726
01:31:59,975 --> 01:32:02,191
l'll see you there.
You'll come, won't you?

727
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:04,909
How about a coffee, Chandni?

728
01:32:10,923 --> 01:32:12,902
Did a lot of shopping today?

729
01:32:15,024 --> 01:32:17,903
Looks like your husband
is taking good care of you.

730
01:32:18,152 --> 01:32:19,159
Ofcourse

731
01:32:19,369 --> 01:32:21,419
Look how many sarees
he has given me.

732
01:32:22,323 --> 01:32:25,581
Mrs Malhotra, we men
are very cunning.

733
01:32:26,494 --> 01:32:28,780
We make a gift or two
every month or so...

734
01:32:28,997 --> 01:32:31,664
to remind our wives
that we love them.

735
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:38,963
But l'll tell you that
your husband isn't that kind.

736
01:32:39,424 --> 01:32:40,431
No...?

737
01:32:40,675 --> 01:32:41,777
l'm lucky.

738
01:32:49,781 --> 01:32:51,831
Hello?

739
01:33:01,946 --> 01:33:05,382
''Past the window of memory
l stare into my past''

740
01:33:06,117 --> 01:33:09,791
''The secrets of the moments
When l was breathless''

741
01:33:10,288 --> 01:33:13,380
''When love blossomed
Those unspoken songs of love''

742
01:33:13,868 --> 01:33:17,542
''Then l walked alone a deserted street
A tale of broken promises''

743
01:33:18,629 --> 01:33:21,722
''Who remembers?
Who remembers all that?''

744
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:25,607
Amit, l never knew
you were so romantic.

745
01:33:26,971 --> 01:33:29,021
You hide such feelings
in your heart?

746
01:33:29,508 --> 01:33:31,867
Don't believe all that.
lt's bookish.

747
01:33:33,158 --> 01:33:37,152
What a thing to say. Has literature
nothing to do with life?

748
01:33:39,415 --> 01:33:41,879
l write these plays to get over
the emptiness of my own life.

749
01:33:43,377 --> 01:33:47,193
You don't like being complimented
by me? Because l'm your wife?

750
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:52,158
Had it come from another woman, you
would've appreciated the compliment.

751
01:33:53,734 --> 01:33:55,784
Did you have to make that comment?

752
01:33:58,322 --> 01:34:01,865
''On silent nights
That are filled with dreams''

753
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:06,342
''She is drenched in rain
Her wet veil has slipped''

754
01:34:07,428 --> 01:34:10,521
''Her eyes cased in closed lids
Dart and pulsate''

755
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:14,304
''A loving kiss
ls planted on her parted lips''

756
01:34:15,005 --> 01:34:18,856
''But who remembers?
Who remembers all that?''

757
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,326
Hello... Dr Anand speaking

758
01:34:43,689 --> 01:34:47,813
l'm Amit, your patient.
Do you remember me?

759
01:34:48,243 --> 01:34:50,601
Yes... Mr Amit.

760
01:34:50,988 --> 01:34:53,038
How are you?
- l'm fine.

761
01:34:53,282 --> 01:34:54,905
What can l do for you?

762
01:34:55,228 --> 01:34:58,594
l wish you'd join me
for lunch today.

763
01:34:59,329 --> 01:35:00,502
Lunch?

764
01:35:01,068 --> 01:35:02,726
One minute... Chandni

765
01:35:06,628 --> 01:35:08,323
lt's okay.

766
01:35:08,888 --> 01:35:14,232
Where do we meet?
- The lnter Continental. At one.

767
01:35:20,183 --> 01:35:21,878
Alone...?

768
01:35:22,582 --> 01:35:24,313
Were you expecting
anyone with me?

769
01:35:24,528 --> 01:35:28,071
l mean, your wife...?
- Did you invite her?

770
01:35:28,525 --> 01:35:30,220
l invited you.

771
01:35:30,542 --> 01:35:33,872
You told me on phone to join
you for lunch. So here l am.

772
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:36,063
Please be seated.

773
01:35:41,177 --> 01:35:43,084
So what will you have?

774
01:35:44,097 --> 01:35:46,976
Whatever you choose.
- You'll be delighted.

775
01:35:47,294 --> 01:35:50,836
The Chef is a friend.
You'll be treated royally.

776
01:35:51,465 --> 01:35:54,344
l had operated on him, once.
Ever since, he has been my fan.

777
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:57,297
You could've invited her
on my behalf.

778
01:35:57,721 --> 01:36:00,388
Who are you talking?
- Your wife.

779
01:36:03,977 --> 01:36:05,743
How are you?
- l'm okay, sir.

780
01:36:06,063 --> 01:36:09,914
All my favourite dishes, please.
Mr Amit is going to be delighted.

781
01:36:11,972 --> 01:36:18,881
Tell me, doesn't it sound as if
l'm the host and you're my guest?

782
01:36:20,035 --> 01:36:25,594
Just what l feel.
You're the host and l'm your guest.

783
01:36:27,508 --> 01:36:30,008
But you get to foot the bill.

784
01:36:32,826 --> 01:36:35,220
Chandni doesn't know,
what she's missing.

785
01:36:35,642 --> 01:36:38,485
Where is she?
- Now where was she supposed to go?

786
01:36:38,804 --> 01:36:40,392
Oh yes, some flower show.

787
01:36:50,308 --> 01:36:52,738
What's the name of the 3rd entry?
- ''My love''

788
01:36:53,194 --> 01:36:56,773
l want to talk to you.
- The 4th entry is ''We''.

789
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:01,705
Where can we meet?
- 5th, ''An Evening of Wait''

790
01:37:03,169 --> 01:37:04,413
Please, Chandni.

791
01:37:05,393 --> 01:37:07,194
6th, ''Love story''

792
01:37:07,652 --> 01:37:12,239
Tomorrow. Same time. Same place.
- l can't come.

793
01:37:12,796 --> 01:37:14,846
7th ''Dare Devil''

794
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:16,924
l'll wait for you.

795
01:37:17,315 --> 01:37:18,807
8th ''Eternal Bliss''

796
01:37:22,488 --> 01:37:27,832
You can't blame me, Amit.
l got your letter.

797
01:37:30,134 --> 01:37:33,571
With that one letter,
with that piece of paper...

798
01:37:33,749 --> 01:37:38,086
you changed my whole life.
You put an end to the relationship.

799
01:37:39,171 --> 01:37:44,966
You destroyed all the sentiments.
You broke all bonds.

800
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:50,949
And you asked me to live
... live your life!

801
01:37:53,318 --> 01:37:56,505
The torture of being alive,
of living this life!

802
01:37:58,009 --> 01:38:00,439
l won't say that
you've wronged me.

803
01:38:01,451 --> 01:38:05,196
But what you've done to me
wasn't a good thing to do.

804
01:38:08,472 --> 01:38:12,501
l've no answer. No excuses.

805
01:38:17,751 --> 01:38:22,918
The sorrow, the wound that
l have inflicted on you...

806
01:38:24,007 --> 01:38:26,057
l have no excuses for that.

807
01:38:28,178 --> 01:38:33,629
Call it fate, call it a bad time,
call it an accident, but...

808
01:38:34,434 --> 01:38:36,484
this is the truth.

809
01:38:39,057 --> 01:38:45,588
My wife was my brother's fiancee.
She was pregnant with his child.

810
01:38:51,466 --> 01:38:55,590
l took on the responsibility
with a sense of duty.

811
01:38:57,548 --> 01:39:00,463
With my own eyes, l saw
my dreams being shattered.

812
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:03,588
But l could do nothing.

813
01:39:14,057 --> 01:39:17,838
l gave you up, but all my life
l have waited for you.

814
01:39:19,619 --> 01:39:23,743
At every step, l hoped l would
see you, hopeless as it was.

815
01:39:27,057 --> 01:39:28,965
l told myself that
l would not love you.

816
01:39:29,177 --> 01:39:31,227
Yet l have desired you with
such intensity...

817
01:39:31,436 --> 01:39:33,486
that l have no desire left
for anyone else.

818
01:39:38,423 --> 01:39:45,676
No flower wishes to wilt
... though it has to.

819
01:39:47,494 --> 01:39:53,645
Why did all this happen?
Why did it have to happen?

820
01:39:55,071 --> 01:39:56,385
Why?

821
01:39:56,808 --> 01:39:58,159
Oh why?

822
01:39:59,659 --> 01:40:03,783
l hate you.

823
01:40:30,175 --> 01:40:32,225
Thanks. Let it be.

824
01:40:34,346 --> 01:40:36,396
Shall l make you a drink?

825
01:40:42,688 --> 01:40:45,081
All that is gone.
Gone with my brother.

826
01:40:47,415 --> 01:40:51,539
You aren't doing justice
to your brother's memory.

827
01:40:53,671 --> 01:40:58,293
What do you mean?
- Ever since you married me...

828
01:40:59,094 --> 01:41:03,218
you're so subdued, so depressed.

829
01:41:04,654 --> 01:41:09,761
And he used to be so lively.

830
01:41:15,081 --> 01:41:18,447
Can you ever forget him, Shobha?

831
01:41:25,161 --> 01:41:27,211
l don't need to.

832
01:41:28,567 --> 01:41:30,960
He's my past. A sweet memory.

833
01:41:32,251 --> 01:41:34,301
You are my life.

834
01:41:35,866 --> 01:41:39,990
He gave me his love.
You have protected me.

835
01:41:42,678 --> 01:41:47,086
He gave me a dream.
You turned it into a reality.

836
01:41:48,552 --> 01:41:50,946
Why do you forget,
that l am a woman?

837
01:41:52,549 --> 01:41:59,458
For me, my husband is cast in the
image of God. An article of faith.

838
01:42:06,104 --> 01:42:10,583
l've never seen you like this.

839
01:42:15,594 --> 01:42:22,124
Give to me your love.
And l'll make your sorrows mine.

840
01:42:24,873 --> 01:42:26,923
Are you happy?

841
01:42:28,001 --> 01:42:29,529
Very much.

842
01:42:30,574 --> 01:42:32,481
Are you happy?

843
01:42:33,215 --> 01:42:34,566
l...?

844
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,838
Yes, l'm happy too.

845
01:42:45,763 --> 01:42:48,393
lt's too late now, Amit.
Don't rake up the past.

846
01:42:49,898 --> 01:42:51,948
You have a wife.
l have a husband.

847
01:42:52,331 --> 01:42:54,654
Will you have two families
destroyed?

848
01:42:55,111 --> 01:42:57,611
Let's call this compromise
happiness.

849
01:42:58,657 --> 01:43:00,707
Promise me you'll never
see me again.

850
01:43:32,024 --> 01:43:33,790
You're not going to change, eh!

851
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:37,236
Hello, Mrs Amit!
l'm Vidyarthi.

852
01:43:37,724 --> 01:43:42,690
All right, you're a big shot now.
You're rich. You're famous.

853
01:43:43,146 --> 01:43:45,813
But that doesn't mean that
you'll ignore your friends.

854
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:49,018
Got married and you didn't
even invite me?

855
01:43:49,402 --> 01:43:53,253
Maybe l can't give you a gift.
But l'd surely have brought flowers.

856
01:43:54,998 --> 01:43:57,533
l won't sit down at your table.
No matter if l tire out standing.

857
01:43:57,918 --> 01:43:59,825
Besides there isn't
an extra chair.

858
01:44:00,211 --> 01:44:03,304
My compliments to the lady.

859
01:44:03,757 --> 01:44:08,095
But you... accepted that
you're a very famous man now.

860
01:44:08,484 --> 01:44:11,020
But you shouldn't forget
your old friends.

861
01:44:11,473 --> 01:44:14,008
l want that wedding treat.

862
01:44:14,809 --> 01:44:18,660
l'm coming home for dinner.
Remind him lady, l'm coming.

863
01:44:37,993 --> 01:44:39,545
Chandni, listen to me...

864
01:44:42,963 --> 01:44:44,657
Bitch! Can't you see?

865
01:44:45,048 --> 01:44:46,327
Let go!

866
01:44:54,432 --> 01:44:57,727
You don't even know
how to talk to ladies!

867
01:44:58,603 --> 01:45:00,653
Amit! What are you doing?
This is becoming a scene!

868
01:45:00,967 --> 01:45:03,360
Please for my sake. Please.

869
01:45:09,865 --> 01:45:11,915
How did you get hurt?

870
01:45:12,158 --> 01:45:13,995
Just a scratch...

871
01:45:14,244 --> 01:45:16,080
Which is worse.

872
01:45:16,329 --> 01:45:19,138
The unseen wound.
But the pain is felt.

873
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:26,258
Since when did you start on poetry?
- l'm a playwright's wife.

874
01:45:28,842 --> 01:45:30,892
You haven't yet told me...
- What?

875
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:34,707
How did you get hurt?
- l fell down...

876
01:45:36,002 --> 01:45:37,909
Falling isn't good
for a married man.

877
01:45:40,207 --> 01:45:42,352
Where are you?

878
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:50,703
Look, there's something important.

879
01:45:51,156 --> 01:45:54,107
You can't evade me anymore.
Where's your wife?

880
01:45:57,759 --> 01:46:00,082
Meet my wife. Shobha.

881
01:46:08,465 --> 01:46:13,016
My friend, Vidyarthi.

882
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:16,069
A guru of many acolytes.

883
01:46:16,806 --> 01:46:18,572
We're colleagues.

884
01:46:18,892 --> 01:46:23,016
So he has the right
to shoot his mouth off.

885
01:46:24,105 --> 01:46:30,114
He's a playwright after all.
And the plays he puts up!

886
01:46:30,779 --> 01:46:35,188
Mend your ways now.
At curtain call...

887
01:46:35,575 --> 01:46:37,625
you might end up
blowing it.

888
01:46:38,703 --> 01:46:43,870
l have no covers to blow.
Besides, what have l to hide?

889
01:46:44,299 --> 01:46:49,608
No smoke without fire. l hope
you don't spot the fire too late.

890
01:46:50,069 --> 01:46:52,214
Right madam?
- l hardly understand...

891
01:46:52,432 --> 01:46:55,003
what the exchange is about.
- But you're part of it already.

892
01:46:55,386 --> 01:46:56,738
How come?

893
01:46:59,557 --> 01:47:03,065
How about dinner?

894
01:47:03,728 --> 01:47:07,271
He's nervous l might expose him!

895
01:47:09,984 --> 01:47:22,038
l'm street-smart, you know.
ln an encounter with me, you'll lose.

896
01:47:22,671 --> 01:47:25,929
Vidyarthi, you're crossing the limit.
- lt hurts?

897
01:47:26,668 --> 01:47:27,841
Dinner!

898
01:47:31,013 --> 01:47:34,971
Why don't you let him speak?
- He can go on and on all night.

899
01:47:35,705 --> 01:47:37,885
He carries news of all the scandals
in the world in his head.

900
01:47:38,416 --> 01:47:40,466
l just came to know about one!

901
01:47:41,614 --> 01:47:44,979
Has he ever taken you to
The Oberoi for dinner?

902
01:47:45,436 --> 01:47:47,486
Lovely food!

903
01:47:48,565 --> 01:47:49,572
Right?

904
01:47:52,041 --> 01:47:54,091
Actually l forgot
the real thing.

905
01:47:54,474 --> 01:47:58,539
Ever since you married him,
his luck has changed.

906
01:47:58,992 --> 01:48:02,701
He's getting a gold medal!

907
01:48:03,163 --> 01:48:04,928
l had come to invite you.

908
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:10,771
You keep that medal.
Give me the gold. What...?

909
01:48:12,895 --> 01:48:14,590
l can't come.

910
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:22,067
For my sake. You're my inspiration,
my hope, my imagination.

911
01:48:24,017 --> 01:48:27,453
All-in-one?
What about the other girls?

912
01:48:28,188 --> 01:48:33,639
Don't laugh it off.
- My husband is away in Bombay.

913
01:48:34,097 --> 01:48:35,933
Then you can come.

914
01:48:43,828 --> 01:48:47,265
All right, Amit. l'll come.

915
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:55,049
How did you know that
l want to wear this?

916
01:48:55,646 --> 01:49:02,555
l know. And l'm wearing that.
- Are you coming too?

917
01:49:05,899 --> 01:49:11,943
Look Shobha, l'm not stopping you.
These occasions will keep coming.

918
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:14,449
Besides you aren't well.

919
01:49:14,935 --> 01:49:17,151
Maybe it's better
if you don't come.

920
01:49:17,543 --> 01:49:21,323
ls there any other reason?
- Don't expect me to spell it out.

921
01:49:21,992 --> 01:49:24,042
That place is going to be
filled with beautiful girls.

922
01:49:24,251 --> 01:49:26,918
How can l flirt with them
right in front of you?

923
01:49:27,622 --> 01:49:30,715
What if l let you flirt?
Will you take me then?

924
01:49:33,114 --> 01:49:34,879
That isn't candid enough.

925
01:49:35,269 --> 01:49:39,049
Then promise me something.
- What?

926
01:49:41,177 --> 01:49:45,301
You'll tell me the name of the girl
you happen to like.

927
01:49:46,808 --> 01:49:50,316
What will you do to her?
- Leave that to me.

928
01:50:02,379 --> 01:50:05,886
Ladies and gentlemen.
l'm grateful to you...

929
01:50:06,238 --> 01:50:11,724
for the respect and the adulation
you have given me.

930
01:50:13,849 --> 01:50:15,899
What can l tell you
about myself?

931
01:50:17,742 --> 01:50:23,265
One day, when l began my life here,
my heart was racing.

932
01:50:24,971 --> 01:50:29,866
Today, you are honouring me
in this very place.

933
01:50:31,227 --> 01:50:33,277
My heart is racing once again.

934
01:50:35,572 --> 01:50:38,486
One needs support to take
the journey though life.

935
01:50:40,125 --> 01:50:45,434
Thank you for being with me.

936
01:50:46,938 --> 01:50:48,703
What else have l to say?

937
01:50:49,301 --> 01:50:52,216
Let me recite a few lines
from my new play.

938
01:50:54,098 --> 01:50:57,084
''So what if a dream
is shattered by accident?''

939
01:50:58,859 --> 01:51:02,296
''Destiny cannot touch emotions''

940
01:51:04,247 --> 01:51:06,877
''Distances cannot suppress sentiments''

941
01:51:08,591 --> 01:51:13,757
''Love is a bond of hearts''

942
01:51:15,195 --> 01:51:20,231
''A bond that knows no bounds''

943
01:51:22,355 --> 01:51:25,234
''Though you are the moon
of someone else's nights''

944
01:51:27,291 --> 01:51:29,755
''Yet in every facet of my life
you are''

945
01:51:31,322 --> 01:51:34,617
''You light up my dreams,
my hopes''

946
01:51:36,153 --> 01:51:39,827
''Whatever path l tread
leads to you''

947
01:51:50,925 --> 01:51:54,432
You didn't even mention me.
And you say l'm your inspiration?

948
01:51:55,686 --> 01:51:59,989
Your hope? Your imagination?

949
01:52:01,769 --> 01:52:07,978
l might not have mentioned you.
But l spoke about you.

950
01:52:09,138 --> 01:52:11,117
Were you afraid?

951
01:52:11,571 --> 01:52:16,951
Yes. Had l mentioned your name,
l would've started a raging fire.

952
01:52:18,696 --> 01:52:22,926
Are you scared of the fire
you have started?

953
01:52:25,647 --> 01:52:27,898
l started the fire
to light up my heart.

954
01:52:28,879 --> 01:52:32,067
l'm afraid that people
might laugh at me.

955
01:52:34,441 --> 01:52:36,905
Shall l show you something?
- What?

956
01:52:50,776 --> 01:52:55,943
The ticket to your play.
l have preserved this ticket.

957
01:52:58,075 --> 01:53:03,005
On some pretext or the other,
l look at it everyday.

958
01:53:10,657 --> 01:53:14,200
ln those few meetings,
the way you looked at me...

959
01:53:14,758 --> 01:53:19,238
whatever you told me...
that is what l believe.

960
01:53:21,015 --> 01:53:23,681
The years, the months,
the days afterwards...

961
01:53:24,595 --> 01:53:27,853
have been empty...
without meaning.

962
01:53:41,174 --> 01:53:42,347
Welcome!

963
01:53:43,225 --> 01:53:44,955
Are you surprised?
To see me?

964
01:53:45,275 --> 01:53:47,041
l am your husband.

965
01:53:47,917 --> 01:53:50,168
You were supposed to come
and pick me from the airport.

966
01:53:51,463 --> 01:53:54,129
l didn't see you there,
and l almost died!

967
01:54:07,868 --> 01:54:11,126
What's this new affectation?

968
01:54:12,213 --> 01:54:13,456
What?

969
01:54:14,889 --> 01:54:17,875
You seem to have developed
a new love these days.

970
01:54:18,711 --> 01:54:22,492
You seem lost. You look surprised
whenever l speak.

971
01:54:23,682 --> 01:54:27,119
And l have this audacity
of trying to aim too high.

972
01:54:27,748 --> 01:54:31,872
What are you talking about?

973
01:54:32,961 --> 01:54:39,171
l know every move of yours...
where you go, whom you meet.

974
01:54:39,774 --> 01:54:42,309
After all, l have to keep an eye.

975
01:54:43,494 --> 01:54:47,036
l don't understand a word!

976
01:54:53,051 --> 01:54:58,574
You didn't tell me.
- Want me to tell you?

977
01:55:02,157 --> 01:55:05,938
What were you doing on tv today?
- On tv...?

978
01:55:06,328 --> 01:55:10,452
l saw you. l swear, you
were looking lovely.

979
01:55:12,584 --> 01:55:17,336
Mr Amit was insistent. And you
weren't here. So l went over.

980
01:55:17,798 --> 01:55:24,185
To please him.
- How about pleasing me at times?

981
01:55:28,295 --> 01:55:32,359
Don't understand?
l'll tell you...

982
01:55:32,818 --> 01:55:37,641
Between the desire in your eyes
and the craving on my lips...

983
01:55:38,726 --> 01:55:43,205
there lies life!

984
01:55:50,752 --> 01:55:52,589
The girl of my dreams!

985
01:56:11,676 --> 01:56:16,227
Solitude and l
often talk to ourselves.

986
01:56:18,002 --> 01:56:20,052
What would it be
if you were here?

987
01:56:20,782 --> 01:56:24,219
What would you say?

988
01:56:24,605 --> 01:56:28,729
What would shock you?
What would make you laugh?

989
01:56:30,341 --> 01:56:36,029
What would it be
had l you?

990
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:41,526
Solitude and l
often talk to ourselves.

991
01:57:30,956 --> 01:57:45,925
''Where is this we have reached
After taking the journey together?''

992
01:57:46,979 --> 01:57:55,275
''ln your arms my love,
My body and my heart melt''

993
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:38,033
''ls this the night?
Or is it the shade of your tresses?''

994
01:58:39,393 --> 01:58:43,244
''ls it moonlight?
Or do your eyes light up my night?''

995
01:58:45,024 --> 01:58:47,868
''ls this the moon?
Or the scythed bracelet on your arm?''

996
01:58:49,333 --> 01:58:51,383
''The stars?
Or the pleasure of your body?''

997
01:58:53,018 --> 01:58:56,798
''Was that a waft of breeze?
Or a waft of your fragrance?''

998
01:58:58,231 --> 01:59:03,054
''Was that the swish of dry leaves?
Or was it your sigh?''

999
01:59:05,182 --> 01:59:07,232
''ln solitude l imagine
Forever''

1000
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:13,477
''But l know that you are not with me
Nowhere near me''

1001
01:59:14,706 --> 01:59:19,257
''Yet l tell myself
Here you are... somewhere''

1002
01:59:21,519 --> 01:59:25,121
''You're the body
l am the shadow''

1003
01:59:26,142 --> 01:59:29,684
''Without you where will l be?''

1004
01:59:30,903 --> 01:59:39,199
''l am wherever you are, my love''

1005
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:48,763
''We had to meet, my love,
While we tread this path''

1006
01:59:59,021 --> 02:00:05,230
''This is where we have reached''

1007
02:00:08,371 --> 02:00:12,922
''After the journey together''

1008
02:01:11,246 --> 02:01:19,447
''On my breath the fragrant musk''

1009
02:01:20,734 --> 02:01:28,686
''Your love is the moonlight
Shining upon my heart''

1010
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:38,075
''The darkening evening of my life
Has mellowed me''

1011
02:01:48,541 --> 02:01:55,106
''This we have reached''

1012
02:01:57,994 --> 02:02:02,402
''After the journey together''

1013
02:02:05,432 --> 02:02:07,791
''Compulsions exist''

1014
02:02:09,325 --> 02:02:12,133
''l wake lonely nights
As you wake''

1015
02:02:13,913 --> 02:02:16,377
''l have so much to say
But to whom do l speak?''

1016
02:02:17,423 --> 02:02:19,923
''How long should l suffer
ln silence?''

1017
02:02:21,211 --> 02:02:27,149
''Break the barriers, my heart says
Bring down the walls that part us''

1018
02:02:28,546 --> 02:02:31,081
''Why burn our hearts?''

1019
02:02:31,639 --> 02:02:35,941
''Let's tell the world
Yes! We're in love''

1020
02:02:36,401 --> 02:02:38,546
What the hell is going on?
- Light gone out, sir.

1021
02:02:38,938 --> 02:02:41,675
lt's a question of life and death!
Put on the emergency light.

1022
02:03:10,066 --> 02:03:11,618
My boy!

1023
02:03:12,011 --> 02:03:14,820
He's going to be all right.
We'll take him to a doctor.

1024
02:03:15,349 --> 02:03:19,343
Hold on! This is a police case.

1025
02:03:19,658 --> 02:03:21,981
No need to make a police case.
l'll take care of the kid.

1026
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:25,179
Take care, will you?
You car-types don't even treat...

1027
02:03:25,394 --> 02:03:28,901
pedestrians as humans beings!
- l admit my mistake.

1028
02:03:29,147 --> 02:03:32,370
Kill someone, and then plead guilty.
How convenient!

1029
02:03:32,866 --> 02:03:36,789
Take down the registration number.
- Call the police.

1030
02:03:37,246 --> 02:03:40,883
Police? This is silly! Let's
take the kid to a doctor first.

1031
02:03:41,347 --> 02:03:43,882
Hear! We're silly!

1032
02:03:44,405 --> 02:03:49,300
Had l been strong enough l would've
slapped some sense into you.

1033
02:03:50,592 --> 02:03:51,599
Police!

1034
02:03:59,455 --> 02:04:03,057
Step aside. No one stands here.

1035
02:04:03,452 --> 02:04:05,289
Vacate this place.

1036
02:04:05,677 --> 02:04:09,043
What happened?
- A kid. He's hurt. Slightly.

1037
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:11,646
Who was driving the car?
- l was driving.

1038
02:04:12,489 --> 02:04:14,539
Your wife?
- Yes.

1039
02:04:15,686 --> 02:04:18,009
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

1040
02:04:18,467 --> 02:04:20,517
Follow me in your car.
To the police station.

1041
02:04:24,306 --> 02:04:26,178
You sit. l'll drive.

1042
02:04:33,691 --> 02:04:36,949
Hush up this case! Anyhow!
Else l'll die!

1043
02:04:37,514 --> 02:04:39,978
lf he comes to know...!

1044
02:04:40,364 --> 02:04:42,686
l understand. Be brave.

1045
02:04:55,414 --> 02:04:59,372
An accident has taken place.
Can you come over?

1046
02:05:01,496 --> 02:05:03,332
l'm coming.
- Thank you.

1047
02:05:12,028 --> 02:05:14,078
l have a request.
- Yes?

1048
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:19,280
Can we close this case?
- Reason...?

1049
02:05:21,517 --> 02:05:26,163
My wife is worried.
And l'm ashamed.

1050
02:05:26,626 --> 02:05:28,676
What has that to do with the law?

1051
02:05:30,692 --> 02:05:33,322
The kid has minor injuries.
We'll take the responsibility.

1052
02:05:33,716 --> 02:05:35,268
You're wasting my time.

1053
02:05:37,330 --> 02:05:41,454
lf this case is registered,
we will be maligned.

1054
02:05:41,919 --> 02:05:44,313
You should've thought about this
before running the kid over.

1055
02:05:44,734 --> 02:05:46,535
No one commits an accident
on purpose.

1056
02:05:46,784 --> 02:05:50,364
Don't disturb me.
Please let me get on with my job.

1057
02:05:54,119 --> 02:05:56,370
You're being more officious
than the case warrants.

1058
02:05:57,907 --> 02:06:04,473
l could do worse.
l could arrest you and your wife.

1059
02:06:04,928 --> 02:06:08,922
But you can't hang us!
- Unfortunately.

1060
02:06:09,377 --> 02:06:11,948
You're arrogant and you are egoistic!

1061
02:06:12,505 --> 02:06:15,598
And you're an irresponsible
and a careless citizen.

1062
02:06:16,571 --> 02:06:18,857
No use begging and arguing.

1063
02:06:19,421 --> 02:06:21,471
One more word and
you're in the lock-up.

1064
02:06:40,449 --> 02:06:44,514
A reputed man fears for nothing
but his own reputation.

1065
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,050
Call Dr Anand.

1066
02:06:51,606 --> 02:06:53,822
Sorry, it's too late.
l'm already here.

1067
02:06:54,596 --> 02:06:57,997
l'm sorry, doctor.
The kid was slightly hurt.

1068
02:06:58,384 --> 02:07:02,235
They paid up the kid's parents.
Then they parted friends.

1069
02:07:02,902 --> 02:07:04,597
Who were they?

1070
02:07:05,683 --> 02:07:10,163
Who did he say he is?
- Amit Malhotra... some writer.

1071
02:07:10,897 --> 02:07:13,990
l know him well.

1072
02:07:14,476 --> 02:07:18,541
His wife was driving the car.
- Whatever happened is for the better

1073
02:07:19,239 --> 02:07:21,289
l'll take leave now.
- Thank you doctor.

1074
02:07:25,772 --> 02:07:27,679
When did you come?
- This morning.

1075
02:07:28,031 --> 02:07:30,661
Where have you been?
Shobha was worried.

1076
02:07:31,159 --> 02:07:33,790
l got in a mess.

1077
02:07:34,323 --> 02:07:39,430
Tell me, do you get into messes,
or do messes get you?

1078
02:07:40,788 --> 02:07:42,838
Who gets whom, l can't say.

1079
02:07:43,221 --> 02:07:46,657
But what fun is life
without a few snafus?

1080
02:07:50,172 --> 02:07:53,608
About Shobha's wedding... you know
what situation it was...?

1081
02:07:54,343 --> 02:07:57,779
Yes.
- So we couldn't invite anyone.

1082
02:07:58,270 --> 02:08:01,600
l invited Shobha's cousin for lunch.
- Lovely!

1083
02:08:02,024 --> 02:08:03,232
Hello Aunt!

1084
02:08:08,454 --> 02:08:11,333
May l come in?
- You're in already.

1085
02:08:12,139 --> 02:08:16,547
Welcome, Kulbhushan.
l was just telling Amit about you.

1086
02:08:16,934 --> 02:08:20,371
Amit, this is Kulbhushan.
He's a policeman.

1087
02:08:20,827 --> 02:08:23,422
He was in Assam during the wedding.

1088
02:08:23,886 --> 02:08:28,709
My sister's son. l brought him up.

1089
02:08:29,447 --> 02:08:31,876
He is Shobha's pet.

1090
02:08:32,228 --> 02:08:33,235
Mummy...

1091
02:08:34,174 --> 02:08:36,153
Keep yourselves company.
l'll be back soon.

1092
02:08:40,743 --> 02:08:46,158
Perhaps, we have met?

1093
02:08:48,806 --> 02:08:50,749
You don't remember?

1094
02:08:50,997 --> 02:08:53,047
Your memory is weak.

1095
02:08:54,125 --> 02:09:00,133
Refreshing my memory
won't do you any good.

1096
02:09:01,424 --> 02:09:06,247
Best of all, don't forget,
that you're my guest.

1097
02:09:06,638 --> 02:09:10,418
And you are my wife's brother.
- Forget the formalities.

1098
02:09:12,024 --> 02:09:18,068
As a cousin, l've every right to
safeguard your wife's interests.

1099
02:09:23,598 --> 02:09:28,835
Here to help your cousin?
Where were you when she needed you?

1100
02:09:32,705 --> 02:09:36,142
Are you asking to be paid
for your obligations?

1101
02:09:38,752 --> 02:09:40,659
You're dirty!

1102
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:46,572
Don't try to talk me down.
l'm arrogant. And l'm egoistic.

1103
02:09:47,754 --> 02:09:55,991
l'll never forgive someone
who hurts cousin Shobha!

1104
02:09:59,606 --> 02:10:05,816
Not only arrogant and egoistic.
You are also foolish. And indecorous.

1105
02:10:07,115 --> 02:10:11,594
l'll excuse you because
you're my guest. Else...

1106
02:10:17,784 --> 02:10:22,430
My Aunt praises you a lot.
She worships you like God.

1107
02:10:23,798 --> 02:10:29,321
Don't go by your Aunt.
l'm human. l'm not God.

1108
02:10:31,097 --> 02:10:34,533
Trust your eyes.
And trust your ears.

1109
02:10:38,396 --> 02:10:43,018
We're much obliged to you.
Thus sworn to silence.

1110
02:10:45,868 --> 02:10:51,034
But how long will
she remain silent?

1111
02:10:56,539 --> 02:11:00,663
l'm a stranger in this city.
Will you please help me?

1112
02:11:01,335 --> 02:11:04,428
The entire police force
is at your beck and call.

1113
02:11:06,757 --> 02:11:12,481
This is a delicate matter.
lt involves my cousin's husband.

1114
02:11:15,238 --> 02:11:16,245
Listen...

1115
02:11:28,028 --> 02:11:31,323
Does a policeman unnerve you?

1116
02:11:32,199 --> 02:11:35,114
Don't worry, he has come to
meet me. Not to arrest me.

1117
02:11:35,745 --> 02:11:41,268
l think, she's has got me amiss.
Won't you introduce us?

1118
02:11:42,174 --> 02:11:48,704
My life, my desire, my spring,
my blossom, etc etc...

1119
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:51,895
l don't follow...
- l'll tell you.

1120
02:11:52,428 --> 02:11:56,007
l'm not having an affair with her.
Nor am l flirting with her.

1121
02:11:56,459 --> 02:12:00,524
l've married her.
She's my wife.

1122
02:12:05,079 --> 02:12:07,544
l didn't understand
the meaning of that expletive.

1123
02:12:08,485 --> 02:12:11,507
Anyway, about your cousin
and her husband...

1124
02:12:12,586 --> 02:12:17,138
Doctor, l think l'm forgetting
something.

1125
02:12:19,539 --> 02:12:24,090
Look, everyone is waiting for us.
We're late. Aren't you coming?

1126
02:12:24,474 --> 02:12:27,567
Sure, sweetheart.
Anything you say.

1127
02:12:29,688 --> 02:12:34,653
Say what, if you want a happy
married life, get henpecked.

1128
02:12:36,222 --> 02:12:39,931
Excuse me today.
Let's talk some other day.

1129
02:12:40,393 --> 02:12:44,173
Come on now!
- l'll get the car keys.

1130
02:12:51,757 --> 02:12:57,138
Tell me something. How do you like
being married to a playwright?

1131
02:12:57,735 --> 02:13:02,701
Their types should never marry.
They are always strangers.

1132
02:13:03,227 --> 02:13:07,849
They may be close to you... but
who knows if they are really close?

1133
02:13:08,963 --> 02:13:14,129
They live for the moment.
That's life with them.

1134
02:13:14,975 --> 02:13:17,025
What's your opinion?

1135
02:13:17,895 --> 02:13:19,874
l've just been branded.

1136
02:13:20,258 --> 02:13:22,723
l'm paying for it.
- How? By making friends with us?

1137
02:13:22,830 --> 02:13:25,330
Or by marrying Shobha?
- What nonsense!

1138
02:13:26,167 --> 02:13:27,340
l'm sorry.

1139
02:13:29,086 --> 02:13:30,994
l saw you somewhere recently.

1140
02:13:32,076 --> 02:13:33,083
Me...?
- Yes.

1141
02:13:33,397 --> 02:13:35,233
Now where did l see you?

1142
02:13:35,551 --> 02:13:40,718
Had a man said this, l would've
thought he was romancing my wife.

1143
02:13:45,353 --> 02:13:47,818
l remember. On tv

1144
02:13:53,277 --> 02:13:56,370
Why not pay off Amit's debts?
- My debt?

1145
02:13:56,753 --> 02:14:00,260
The lunch that day...
- Did he buy you lunch?

1146
02:14:00,924 --> 02:14:03,875
Maybe he wanted to treat you.
But he treated me.

1147
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:11,728
l guess l have the knack of saying
the wrong thing at the wrong time.

1148
02:14:14,896 --> 02:14:16,875
You were talking about debt.

1149
02:14:17,259 --> 02:14:20,352
l was saying this is your
first spring festival with me.

1150
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:24,242
Why not invite Amit and Shobha
for lunch?

1151
02:14:24,558 --> 02:14:25,566
Mr Amit?

1152
02:14:26,053 --> 02:14:30,283
Just lunch?
Or the spring fest?

1153
02:14:31,857 --> 02:14:34,950
This is my wife's first
spring fest.

1154
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:37,870
And with you around, the colours
will come to life!

1155
02:14:40,199 --> 02:14:42,035
Let we dance.

1156
02:15:12,523 --> 02:15:17,109
Strange custom. Men dance openly
with other men's wives.

1157
02:15:26,843 --> 02:15:28,893
A penny for your thoughts?

1158
02:15:30,423 --> 02:15:33,338
ls this a habit with you?
- What habit?

1159
02:15:34,698 --> 02:15:38,134
Getting lost...?

1160
02:15:39,633 --> 02:15:41,470
What do you think?

1161
02:15:41,997 --> 02:15:49,392
l think you're hiding a secret.
You want to say it. But you can't.

1162
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:55,374
Maybe that's why you
had that car crash.

1163
02:15:55,761 --> 02:15:57,669
Car crash? When?

1164
02:15:58,472 --> 02:16:00,451
Forgotten?

1165
02:16:00,766 --> 02:16:02,816
But l don't know driving.

1166
02:16:03,338 --> 02:16:06,703
Funny! The day before yesterday,
you and Mr Amit...

1167
02:16:07,786 --> 02:16:10,180
Maybe l got it wrong.

1168
02:16:11,957 --> 02:16:16,259
Look, 2 minutes with you,
and l've lost my memory!

1169
02:16:17,727 --> 02:16:22,135
l remember! The day before
yesterday, isn't it?

1170
02:16:23,427 --> 02:16:26,520
The day before yesterday, perhaps?
- l'm so forgetful...

1171
02:16:27,598 --> 02:16:30,265
He was teaching me
how to drive...

1172
02:16:30,726 --> 02:16:33,819
l lost control...

1173
02:16:34,202 --> 02:16:36,252
And l crashed the car.

1174
02:16:42,196 --> 02:16:44,246
You're great.

1175
02:16:53,666 --> 02:16:55,716
You're a lovely wife.

1176
02:16:56,377 --> 02:17:01,200
Anyone would be jealous of you.
Amit is indeed lucky.

1177
02:17:03,328 --> 02:17:07,179
l wouldn't know that.
But yes, l'm very lucky...

1178
02:17:08,438 --> 02:17:10,488
to have Amit for a husband.

1179
02:17:11,392 --> 02:17:13,442
May l use the colours on you?

1180
02:17:14,694 --> 02:17:16,566
Asking for permission?

1181
02:17:17,648 --> 02:17:19,176
Just asking.

1182
02:17:20,776 --> 02:17:22,826
You have the right to.

1183
02:17:25,295 --> 02:17:27,345
Your first spring festival.
All the best!

1184
02:17:27,658 --> 02:17:35,338
The colours look lovely on you.
- Reminds of my first love.

1185
02:17:35,792 --> 02:17:41,172
You mean the doctor?
- Him l have married.

1186
02:17:42,465 --> 02:17:43,673
Loved...?

1187
02:17:45,871 --> 02:17:50,978
He was forced into a marriage
before we could get married.

1188
02:17:53,796 --> 02:17:56,889
Yes. ln our country,
the husband is never the lover.

1189
02:17:58,419 --> 02:18:03,277
The one you loved, is she married?
- She was forced to.

1190
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:07,663
You've heard my whole story.
Now tell me your story.

1191
02:18:08,324 --> 02:18:13,704
l'm happy with what
God has given me.

1192
02:18:14,997 --> 02:18:16,348
One minute...

1193
02:18:36,859 --> 02:18:45,191
''The colours rain
Upon the veiled maiden''

1194
02:18:47,669 --> 02:18:53,535
''Who drenched you
in these colours?''

1195
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:59,099
''These delightful colours''

1196
02:19:28,056 --> 02:19:33,994
''My veiled maiden,
The colours are raining on you''

1197
02:19:34,486 --> 02:19:39,760
''Maiden! The colours
are raining on you''

1198
02:20:33,608 --> 02:20:37,459
''Serve him on a golden platter''

1199
02:20:38,752 --> 02:20:44,417
''Her lover is crazy about it!''

1200
02:20:45,773 --> 02:20:51,367
''Let him pine for it
While the colours rain''

1201
02:20:51,751 --> 02:20:57,202
''Maiden! The colours
are raining on you''

1202
02:21:28,038 --> 02:21:30,632
''Clove and cardamom''

1203
02:21:32,069 --> 02:21:36,098
''Stuff the betel leaf
with clove and cinnamon''

1204
02:21:37,282 --> 02:21:42,805
''Her lover will love
to chew on it''

1205
02:21:44,581 --> 02:21:49,748
''My veiled maiden,
The colours are raining on you''

1206
02:21:50,282 --> 02:21:55,663
''Maiden! The colours
are raining on you''

1207
02:22:32,477 --> 02:22:36,672
''Of jasmines''

1208
02:22:38,211 --> 02:22:41,304
''Make a bed''

1209
02:22:42,973 --> 02:22:50,226
''Make a bed of jasmines''

1210
02:23:02,784 --> 02:23:06,221
''A bed of jasmines''

1211
02:23:07,790 --> 02:23:09,840
''And who lies on it?''

1212
02:23:13,281 --> 02:23:18,732
''Her lover''

1213
02:23:20,198 --> 02:23:25,472
''And then they will make love
Let the colours rain''

1214
02:23:26,002 --> 02:23:31,169
''Maiden! The colours
are raining on you''

1215
02:24:07,850 --> 02:24:19,180
''My veiled maiden,
The colours are raining on you''

1216
02:24:20,536 --> 02:24:24,174
''Serve me on a golden platter''

1217
02:24:25,646 --> 02:24:29,283
You were ecstatic.
- Still am!

1218
02:24:30,268 --> 02:24:32,210
The opiate the doctor served
must've been potent.

1219
02:24:32,457 --> 02:24:34,507
l hope l didn't create a scene.

1220
02:24:36,628 --> 02:24:40,551
You should give me a lecture
about the limits of decency.

1221
02:24:42,884 --> 02:24:45,977
That tells me, l must've
slipped up somewhere.

1222
02:24:47,577 --> 02:24:50,148
Anyway, what's done is done.

1223
02:24:50,531 --> 02:24:52,854
lt was the spring fest...
l just got carried away a bit.

1224
02:24:54,354 --> 02:24:58,205
''The heart lives near the head,
and that's just as well''

1225
02:24:58,803 --> 02:25:02,310
''But sometimes, it's better
not to mix the head and the heart''

1226
02:25:05,824 --> 02:25:07,874
The dye isn't washing.

1227
02:25:08,952 --> 02:25:11,002
Some colours are fast...

1228
02:25:12,498 --> 02:25:14,892
l hope Amit didn't use
a fixer with the colours.

1229
02:25:16,251 --> 02:25:21,217
Now my suspicions are confirmed.

1230
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:30,808
Everyone has a past.
You may have one too.

1231
02:25:32,934 --> 02:25:36,442
Even if you have a past,
l won't ask you.

1232
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:42,697
Why won't you?
You have every right to ask.

1233
02:25:45,447 --> 02:25:47,497
l'm not one of those husbands.

1234
02:25:48,645 --> 02:25:52,709
l consider my wife a human being.
Not a slave.

1235
02:26:00,115 --> 02:26:02,615
Why did you have to remind me
about that today?

1236
02:26:05,328 --> 02:26:13,209
Today l remembered a part of my past
... a part l haven't told you about.

1237
02:26:30,353 --> 02:26:34,832
The past is best preserved
in memories.

1238
02:26:37,374 --> 02:26:43,098
Mix the past with the present,
and you're likely to ruin your life.

1239
02:26:44,881 --> 02:26:47,275
And someone else's life too.

1240
02:26:47,731 --> 02:26:50,054
You have no right to interfere.

1241
02:26:50,304 --> 02:26:52,627
Look, l'm your cousin.

1242
02:26:53,571 --> 02:26:55,550
l won't see your family
being ruined.

1243
02:26:56,977 --> 02:26:59,157
lf you can't, get yourself
transferred out of here.

1244
02:27:00,592 --> 02:27:02,915
l'm not weak.
Don't patronise me.

1245
02:27:04,102 --> 02:27:06,152
l can take my own decisions.

1246
02:27:08,864 --> 02:27:11,434
l don't wish to hear
anything about him.

1247
02:27:12,235 --> 02:27:14,285
So what? What's my crime?

1248
02:27:14,599 --> 02:27:17,443
You have the cheek.

1249
02:27:17,970 --> 02:27:21,335
You play Romeo, and then
you ask what's my crime?

1250
02:27:21,724 --> 02:27:24,746
Vidyarthi, you're taking undue
advantage of our friendship.

1251
02:27:25,234 --> 02:27:28,635
You don't like what l say?

1252
02:27:30,552 --> 02:27:33,088
The truth is always bitter.

1253
02:27:33,889 --> 02:27:36,981
l've been in love too.

1254
02:27:37,469 --> 02:27:40,727
But after l came to know
that she's married...

1255
02:27:41,188 --> 02:27:44,067
l walked away from her life.

1256
02:27:45,810 --> 02:27:48,441
That's an expression of love too.

1257
02:27:51,615 --> 02:27:54,873
lf you've had your say,
may l leave now?

1258
02:27:57,941 --> 02:28:02,065
Have you heard fairy tales
in your childhood?

1259
02:28:03,084 --> 02:28:04,779
Which one?

1260
02:28:05,552 --> 02:28:11,631
About the prince, the princess
and the fairy.

1261
02:28:15,597 --> 02:28:19,271
When fantasy is pitted
against reality...

1262
02:28:21,158 --> 02:28:23,208
it is reality that prevails.

1263
02:28:24,773 --> 02:28:32,240
But fantasy is very much part of life.
One needs fantasies.

1264
02:28:33,323 --> 02:28:35,373
What you want to say
is something else.

1265
02:28:35,756 --> 02:28:40,579
No. lt's the same old story.
One day, there comes a fairy.

1266
02:28:41,074 --> 02:28:44,546
She waves her magic wand,
and takes the prince away with her.

1267
02:28:45,905 --> 02:28:49,413
Which leaves the poor princess
in tears, right?

1268
02:28:49,798 --> 02:28:55,178
What l didn't like was
the princess' tragedy.

1269
02:28:56,332 --> 02:28:59,354
This story should be
written over again.

1270
02:29:00,539 --> 02:29:05,125
The princess shouldn't be
helpless and weak.

1271
02:29:06,759 --> 02:29:08,525
What should she do?

1272
02:29:10,096 --> 02:29:13,947
She should fight
for her rights.

1273
02:29:20,036 --> 02:29:21,589
And you...?

1274
02:29:23,269 --> 02:29:25,141
Where do you figure in the story?

1275
02:29:28,726 --> 02:29:34,521
ln the story, l am the king.

1276
02:29:35,885 --> 02:29:40,436
At nights, l go around in disguise
to see how my subjects are faring.

1277
02:29:41,377 --> 02:29:43,427
l am the giver of justice.

1278
02:29:45,061 --> 02:29:47,728
l have these many responsibilities...

1279
02:29:49,302 --> 02:29:55,654
of the kingdom, of the dynasty,
of duty, of tradition.

1280
02:29:57,782 --> 02:30:00,875
That tradition l am serving.

1281
02:30:05,081 --> 02:30:09,205
The king is mighty.

1282
02:30:11,338 --> 02:30:13,802
He can save his kingdom.
Whenever he wants.

1283
02:30:18,116 --> 02:30:19,988
l'm leaving.

1284
02:30:24,615 --> 02:30:27,707
l'll remember what you told me.

1285
02:30:44,392 --> 02:30:48,516
What do you want?
- ls that relevant?

1286
02:30:55,131 --> 02:30:59,682
Leave him...
- lt isn't within my power.

1287
02:31:00,763 --> 02:31:04,472
How can l do something
that is beyond my power?

1288
02:31:05,350 --> 02:31:08,443
Amit is my husband.

1289
02:31:08,930 --> 02:31:10,731
He's my love.

1290
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:13,063
l'm fated to love him.

1291
02:31:14,005 --> 02:31:15,948
You'll lose this game.

1292
02:31:16,333 --> 02:31:18,170
l'm not playing games.

1293
02:31:20,156 --> 02:31:21,922
Why are you ruining my family?

1294
02:31:22,694 --> 02:31:24,744
l'm ruining my family too.

1295
02:31:25,857 --> 02:31:31,581
lf you think you can snatch him
away from me, you're mistaken.

1296
02:31:33,781 --> 02:31:37,846
Are you confident?
- Yes. l am confident.

1297
02:31:38,995 --> 02:31:44,589
Then live with your confidence.
Let me live with my love.

1298
02:31:47,267 --> 02:31:51,047
lf this is war between love and faith,
l accept it.

1299
02:31:56,651 --> 02:31:59,318
l'll call you as soon as
l reach Bombay.

1300
02:32:02,004 --> 02:32:07,669
l forgot to pay the telephone bill.
Pay it tomorrow.

1301
02:32:09,511 --> 02:32:14,963
The gardener's wife is unwell.
Give him money if he asks.

1302
02:32:19,660 --> 02:32:21,640
Attend to my letters also.

1303
02:32:22,198 --> 02:32:24,414
Call me up if there's
any urgent letter.

1304
02:32:24,804 --> 02:32:26,854
l'll be staying at the Taj.

1305
02:32:33,424 --> 02:32:39,705
l've signed a few checks. lf you need
money, you can draw it from the Bank.

1306
02:32:45,832 --> 02:32:49,091
You haven't asked me
when l'm returning...

1307
02:32:50,872 --> 02:32:52,922
When are you returning?

1308
02:32:54,382 --> 02:32:56,811
ln 3 or 4 days.

1309
02:33:05,748 --> 02:33:07,798
l don't wish to leave you.

1310
02:33:10,683 --> 02:33:16,692
When l return, l hope l'll find
you waiting here for me.

1311
02:33:24,517 --> 02:33:27,325
Last time when you didn't come...

1312
02:33:27,715 --> 02:33:31,839
''The flight for Bombay is now
ready for departure''

1313
02:33:32,580 --> 02:33:34,974
Ready for departure!

1314
02:33:42,556 --> 02:33:44,772
ls this is right? Or is this wrong?
Tell me.

1315
02:33:45,232 --> 02:33:47,282
Why don't you answer me?

1316
02:33:47,734 --> 02:33:52,486
l can't live like this
torn between him and us!

1317
02:33:53,574 --> 02:33:57,283
How long will l go on cheating him?
How long will l go on cheating myself?

1318
02:33:57,745 --> 02:34:00,139
Who told you to live this life?

1319
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:03,409
Are you saying this?
- Yes. l

1320
02:34:03,861 --> 02:34:05,804
Do you have the courage
to live the life you want?

1321
02:34:06,121 --> 02:34:09,178
Stop wallowing in self-pity.
That's what l'm telling you.

1322
02:34:09,667 --> 02:34:11,254
Keep the pity for somebody else.

1323
02:34:11,474 --> 02:34:13,939
Rid yourself of this guilty conscience
... this self-recrimination.

1324
02:34:14,498 --> 02:34:18,563
Easy for you to say. You're a man.
You aren't going to be tainted.

1325
02:34:18,947 --> 02:34:20,997
This man-woman argument is dated.

1326
02:34:22,248 --> 02:34:25,922
You have to take a decision today.
- What decision?

1327
02:34:27,115 --> 02:34:28,986
Can you break your bonds?

1328
02:34:31,111 --> 02:34:33,161
Amit!
- Yes!

1329
02:34:37,228 --> 02:34:39,408
You don't want to live a life
torn between us and him.

1330
02:34:39,801 --> 02:34:43,167
l'm sick and tired of your fears
and your apprehensions!

1331
02:34:45,744 --> 02:34:47,959
Even when you're with me,
you aren't close to me.

1332
02:34:48,316 --> 02:34:50,674
When you're alone,
you're disturbed.

1333
02:34:55,094 --> 02:34:57,665
lf you haven't the guts, the courage,
it's your problem.

1334
02:34:58,292 --> 02:35:01,657
l've decided...
- What?

1335
02:35:04,270 --> 02:35:06,320
We can't live like this. Torn.

1336
02:35:08,371 --> 02:35:10,694
We have every right to lead
our life, Chandni.

1337
02:35:16,226 --> 02:35:21,677
l can't live without you.
Your decision is mine.

1338
02:35:29,503 --> 02:35:31,198
Going somewhere?

1339
02:35:32,561 --> 02:35:33,628
Shimla.

1340
02:35:34,022 --> 02:35:36,072
When will you return?

1341
02:35:36,454 --> 02:35:38,291
Can't say.

1342
02:35:38,748 --> 02:35:40,727
l want to tell you something.

1343
02:35:46,534 --> 02:35:48,584
Great timing, Shobha.

1344
02:35:51,574 --> 02:35:57,618
For days l've been thinking that
evading won't solve this.

1345
02:35:58,629 --> 02:36:02,136
What?
- About you and me. Sit down.

1346
02:36:14,826 --> 02:36:25,172
At some point of life or the other,
every relationship loses its warmth.

1347
02:36:28,729 --> 02:36:33,481
A relationship which is a mere
understanding between two people...

1348
02:36:36,167 --> 02:36:43,420
ceases to be a relationship.
lt becomes a bondage.

1349
02:36:48,158 --> 02:36:50,208
Your doubt is not baseless.

1350
02:36:54,101 --> 02:36:55,108
l...

1351
02:37:00,601 --> 02:37:02,651
l love Chandni.

1352
02:37:06,475 --> 02:37:08,525
l love Chandni.

1353
02:37:14,156 --> 02:37:18,944
Shobha, l don't want
to blame you for anything.

1354
02:37:20,795 --> 02:37:26,246
lf l have a past, a life
that l once lived...

1355
02:37:26,807 --> 02:37:28,857
will you say l am at fault?

1356
02:37:29,763 --> 02:37:33,543
After l married you,
l never looked back.

1357
02:37:36,435 --> 02:37:38,485
l forced myself to forget my past.

1358
02:37:41,857 --> 02:37:44,108
l didn't turn to her.

1359
02:37:46,168 --> 02:37:51,619
l told myself that l'd never see her.
She was gone far, far away.

1360
02:37:56,525 --> 02:38:03,256
But destiny picked me up,
and placed me right in front of her.

1361
02:38:08,065 --> 02:38:13,101
Tell me, how can l evade destiny?

1362
02:38:15,989 --> 02:38:18,039
Where will l run to?

1363
02:38:20,507 --> 02:38:22,557
l have no other regrets.

1364
02:38:23,635 --> 02:38:26,728
No grievances. No grudges.

1365
02:38:29,892 --> 02:38:34,857
lf l have one regret, one remorse,
if there is anything l rue...

1366
02:38:38,928 --> 02:38:40,978
it is the fact that...

1367
02:38:41,986 --> 02:38:46,110
l have hurt you.

1368
02:38:46,575 --> 02:38:49,454
lnadvertently.

1369
02:39:05,344 --> 02:39:07,394
You wanted to tell me something?

1370
02:39:10,905 --> 02:39:18,584
l doubt if l will be able
to put it in words.

1371
02:39:22,444 --> 02:39:27,610
Where do l go from here?

1372
02:39:31,446 --> 02:39:34,989
My life depends on the relationship
you call a bondage.

1373
02:39:37,702 --> 02:39:44,433
For me, it is love, duty,
religion, faith.

1374
02:39:46,079 --> 02:39:48,508
You've done your duty
towards your brother.

1375
02:39:49,311 --> 02:39:55,355
So you came into my life.
That's how l became your wife.

1376
02:39:58,522 --> 02:40:03,274
l appreciate the sacrifices
you have made.

1377
02:40:04,848 --> 02:40:09,470
l appreciate the way
you took care of me.

1378
02:40:11,451 --> 02:40:16,203
You gave me shelter.
You fulfilled your duty.

1379
02:40:19,376 --> 02:40:23,714
And by and by, l took a liking
towards you. l took you as mine.

1380
02:40:27,718 --> 02:40:29,413
l fell in love with you.

1381
02:40:33,870 --> 02:40:37,413
l used to love someone else.
But today...

1382
02:40:42,316 --> 02:40:45,752
Today, l am in love with you.

1383
02:40:48,259 --> 02:40:50,961
He was. You are.

1384
02:40:53,473 --> 02:40:55,523
Today, this is the truth.

1385
02:40:57,956 --> 02:41:00,006
Will you call this a lie?

1386
02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:08,346
How can you get rid of me like this?

1387
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:57,300
Why did you let him leave?
- What right l had to stop him?

1388
02:41:57,691 --> 02:42:02,857
You are his wife.
- For namesake only.

1389
02:42:07,075 --> 02:42:12,669
He took pity on me.
And he married me.

1390
02:42:14,478 --> 02:42:19,100
This is what comes
out of it, you see.

1391
02:42:22,021 --> 02:42:26,572
Let him come back to me if he wishes.
That's the way l want it.

1392
02:42:27,999 --> 02:42:32,123
Not under some flimsy pretext
or a compromise.

1393
02:42:34,185 --> 02:42:36,579
What if he doesn't wish to?

1394
02:42:39,503 --> 02:42:43,947
l don't wish to deprive him
of his right.

1395
02:43:12,626 --> 02:43:20,234
''What you try to destroy
l will not, my love''

1396
02:43:21,281 --> 02:43:28,226
''lf l stop loving you
Who else will l love?''

1397
02:44:20,750 --> 02:44:28,074
''You are the pearl
l am the string that holds the pearl''

1398
02:44:37,085 --> 02:44:44,339
''You are the gold
l am the sheen on the gold''

1399
02:44:44,906 --> 02:44:52,680
''What you try to destroy
l will not, my love''

1400
02:44:53,769 --> 02:44:56,506
''Hear me, my love''

1401
02:45:22,860 --> 02:45:29,627
''You're my Lord
l'm your slave''

1402
02:45:46,322 --> 02:45:54,558
''What you try to destroy
l will not, my love''

1403
02:46:00,702 --> 02:46:02,752
Have you any complaints
against your wife?

1404
02:46:03,205 --> 02:46:04,213
No.

1405
02:46:04,804 --> 02:46:07,198
You don't like her habits?
Or maybe she doesn't...

1406
02:46:07,410 --> 02:46:09,626
take care of you and
your house properly?

1407
02:46:09,878 --> 02:46:10,885
No, Gurdip.

1408
02:46:11,129 --> 02:46:13,700
Then why are you leaving
such a good woman?

1409
02:46:14,257 --> 02:46:16,995
Look, l'm your friend.
Not your lackey.

1410
02:46:18,220 --> 02:46:21,515
You married her of your own will.
No one forced you into the marriage.

1411
02:46:22,669 --> 02:46:26,034
You went beyond being just humane.
You towered above men.

1412
02:46:26,770 --> 02:46:32,979
You sacrificed your happiness and
your love to give her a new life.

1413
02:46:33,374 --> 02:46:37,154
You became a God, and now...
- Now l want to become human.

1414
02:46:37,475 --> 02:46:44,905
You cannot. Try to climb down,
and you will fall from grace.

1415
02:46:46,026 --> 02:46:49,664
Can man not live for himself?
For his little wishes?

1416
02:46:50,335 --> 02:46:52,800
Will the world not let
a man live his own life?

1417
02:46:53,116 --> 02:46:59,610
Why not? Just go away to a forest
and do what you want.

1418
02:47:00,206 --> 02:47:05,895
Else, you will be called names.
Have you the guts to face that?

1419
02:47:19,948 --> 02:47:24,072
Let's be frank. You hate
seeing Chandni with me.

1420
02:47:24,536 --> 02:47:27,759
Daddy is celebrating the
golden jubilee of his wedding today.

1421
02:47:28,221 --> 02:47:30,128
The house will be filled
with guests and relatives.

1422
02:47:30,445 --> 02:47:34,082
Everyone knows you and Chandni.
Now don't get me wrong.

1423
02:47:34,546 --> 02:47:37,639
You know how the world makes
mountains out of mole-hills.

1424
02:47:49,249 --> 02:47:53,278
We won't give you a bad name.
Don't worry, we won't come together.

1425
02:47:55,400 --> 02:47:59,879
l'll come as your friend,
and Chandni as Simran's friend.

1426
02:48:01,726 --> 02:48:03,776
l hope you've no objections.

1427
02:48:05,827 --> 02:48:07,877
See you then.

1428
02:48:14,169 --> 02:48:18,293
Amit, are you thinking
what l am thinking?

1429
02:48:18,757 --> 02:48:20,807
l'm thinking, how narrow-minded
our society is.

1430
02:48:21,468 --> 02:48:26,220
Has that marred the decision
you have made?

1431
02:48:29,845 --> 02:48:32,203
No one gets everything out of life.

1432
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:38,389
There's always a sense of deprivation.

1433
02:48:51,151 --> 02:48:53,058
Dr Anand here.
- Yes, sahib...

1434
02:48:53,341 --> 02:48:56,883
Get Madam on the line.
- She's not at home.

1435
02:48:57,963 --> 02:49:01,399
Not at home? Where has she gone?
- Don't know, sahib.

1436
02:49:04,219 --> 02:49:08,865
When she comes, tell her that
l'm coming by the 8 o'clock flight.

1437
02:49:10,128 --> 02:49:14,395
Hasn't your husband come?
- No, he has gone to Bombay.

1438
02:49:15,689 --> 02:49:17,525
Any children?

1439
02:49:20,242 --> 02:49:24,828
Are you the family-planning types?

1440
02:49:26,533 --> 02:49:28,583
Take my advice.

1441
02:49:29,279 --> 02:49:31,744
A woman is complete only after
she attains motherhood.

1442
02:49:32,372 --> 02:49:34,422
Otherwise she's incomplete.

1443
02:49:35,431 --> 02:49:42,198
Next time, come here with
your husband and your child.

1444
02:49:59,066 --> 02:50:04,659
''Hear all, this canto written
by the first of The Gurus''

1445
02:50:05,218 --> 02:50:06,746
''The skies sing your glories''

1446
02:50:07,095 --> 02:50:09,868
''The Sun and the Moon are
lamps held in Your prayer''

1447
02:50:10,257 --> 02:50:14,736
''The stars are little pearls''

1448
02:50:15,263 --> 02:50:17,798
''The fragrance of sandal
is the sunshine''

1449
02:50:18,182 --> 02:50:20,019
''The breezes fan You, Lord''

1450
02:50:20,336 --> 02:50:24,460
''All flowers offered in prayer to You''

1451
02:50:24,717 --> 02:50:29,682
''What an amazing hymn
The Universe sings to You, Lord''

1452
02:50:30,417 --> 02:50:34,896
''Every hymn we sing o'Lord,
flows unto Thee''

1453
02:50:35,282 --> 02:50:39,761
''With a thousand eyes, You see o'Lord
Yet none knoweth''

1454
02:50:40,253 --> 02:50:44,899
''ln a thousand images You are manifest
Yet none knoweth''

1455
02:50:45,361 --> 02:50:50,114
''A thousand paths You lead us upon
Yet we are tainted by sin''

1456
02:50:50,575 --> 02:50:55,292
''l am overwhelmed, my Lord''

1457
02:50:55,789 --> 02:51:00,268
''The spirit that shines in all
ls You, Lord''

1458
02:51:00,898 --> 02:51:05,413
''The light that shines upon our path
ls the enlightenment You giveth''

1459
02:51:05,833 --> 02:51:10,348
''The prophet leads us
to this enlightenment''

1460
02:51:10,839 --> 02:51:15,141
''This is the true prayer''

1461
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:20,151
''l, a speck of dust
Am overwhelmed''

1462
02:51:20,814 --> 02:51:24,938
''l thirst for Your grace, Lord''

1463
02:51:25,402 --> 02:51:34,610
''Bless me that l may be
one with You, Lord''

1464
02:51:35,411 --> 02:51:39,535
''Thinking of You
is prayer unto You''

1465
02:51:40,278 --> 02:51:42,672
''All else is illusion''

1466
02:51:45,839 --> 02:51:47,391
Hello.
- Shobha here

1467
02:51:50,635 --> 02:51:52,685
Dr Anand's plane has crashed...

1468
02:52:13,645 --> 02:52:14,996
What happened?

1469
02:52:17,294 --> 02:52:19,652
Dr Anand's plane has crashed.
- What!

1470
02:52:27,372 --> 02:52:28,900
Calling fire brigade..

1471
02:52:30,152 --> 02:52:32,095
Ambulance calling, crashed flight.
Report to the airport.

1472
02:52:36,060 --> 02:52:38,454
Helicopter cleared to land
lower from the airport

1473
02:53:40,292 --> 02:53:41,879
Wait here...

1474
02:53:42,864 --> 02:53:45,530
Come on. Hurry up. You on this side.
Please standby.

1475
02:53:45,992 --> 02:53:49,014
Any chance of survivors?
- So far, none.

1476
02:53:54,055 --> 02:53:55,548
Have all the bodies
been taken out?

1477
02:53:55,724 --> 02:53:58,189
We haven't been able to
control the fire yet.

1478
02:53:59,199 --> 02:54:01,106
Where are you going?
lt's dangerous there.

1479
02:54:01,563 --> 02:54:03,257
Don't! lt's dangerous!

1480
02:54:03,996 --> 02:54:06,046
Let me do my duty.
Anand might be alive.

1481
02:54:06,429 --> 02:54:09,451
No! You can't leave me!
l haven't anyone else in this world!

1482
02:54:09,904 --> 02:54:12,369
Nothing will happen to me.
This is my chance to atone.

1483
02:54:12,754 --> 02:54:14,733
Please! For the sake of your child!

1484
02:54:27,630 --> 02:54:31,754
lf anything happens to you,
l'll be nowhere.

1485
02:54:33,886 --> 02:54:39,053
No Amit will ever come
to support me, to help me.

1486
02:54:47,616 --> 02:54:51,645
You'll get your Amit back.
Take care.

1487
02:54:56,826 --> 02:54:57,833
Amit!

1488
02:55:26,022 --> 02:55:28,557
That's the rear fuselage.
People might be trapped inside.

1489
02:55:28,803 --> 02:55:29,870
Might be.

1490
02:55:30,124 --> 02:55:32,233
Why don't you go in, then?
- lt'll explode any moment.

1491
02:55:32,626 --> 02:55:34,321
Who are you?
Go away! Get out of here.

1492
02:55:35,998 --> 02:55:38,048
Stop! lt's dangerous!

1493
02:55:38,534 --> 02:55:39,542
Stop!

1494
02:56:50,586 --> 02:56:51,594
Anand!

1495
02:56:57,780 --> 02:56:59,830
Where's my wife?

1496
02:57:00,214 --> 02:57:02,156
She became unconscious.
She's in a serious condition.

1497
02:57:02,403 --> 02:57:04,690
Kulbhushan took her home
in an ambulance.

1498
02:57:23,918 --> 02:57:25,897
Please go outside.

1499
02:57:27,880 --> 02:57:29,859
She's my wife.
l'm responsible for her.

1500
02:57:30,104 --> 02:57:32,154
Now please leave us alone.

1501
02:58:01,385 --> 02:58:03,080
l'm back, Shobha.

1502
02:58:06,008 --> 02:58:11,768
l've broken all
the ties with my past...

1503
02:58:14,107 --> 02:58:18,859
with my love, with compromises.

1504
02:58:21,302 --> 02:58:25,497
l was sure you'd come.

1505
02:58:27,245 --> 02:58:31,239
From now on, just remember
one thing.

1506
02:58:34,752 --> 02:58:37,454
You are my wife.

1507
02:58:39,966 --> 02:58:42,110
l am your husband.

1508
02:58:45,179 --> 02:58:46,980
This is the truth.

1509
02:58:47,265 --> 02:58:51,886
The rest is all lies.
All lies.

1510
02:59:05,883 --> 02:59:10,150
''l wish l could sprinkle
stardust on your head''

1511
02:59:10,889 --> 02:59:15,368
''l wish l could make
a flower blossom from your lips''

1512
02:59:16,242 --> 02:59:20,615
''For your sake,
l will give up the whole world''

1513
02:59:21,385 --> 02:59:25,794
''Our garden will be fragrant
with the blossom of our love''

1514
02:59:26,147 --> 02:59:30,176
''ln your arms l find solace''

1515
02:59:30,526 --> 02:59:35,633
''With joys will be filled
this world of ours''

1516
02:59:36,122 --> 02:59:41,467
''A flower will blossom
in our garden''

1517
02:59:42,205 --> 02:59:49,635
''When my veil falls away,
A shyness comes over me''

1518
02:59:50,165 --> 02:59:58,152
''When l see my sisters in love
l feel the stirrings within me''

1519
02:59:59,061 --> 03:00:06,279
''Love is faith &
faith is for ever''
