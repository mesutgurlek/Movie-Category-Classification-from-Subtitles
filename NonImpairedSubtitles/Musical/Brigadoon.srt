1
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:44,984
Once in the Highlands

2
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:49,181
The Highlands of Scotland

3
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:55,195
Deep in the night
on a murky brae

4
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:59,423
There in the Highlands

5
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:03,902
The Highlands of Scotland

6
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,134
Two weary hunters

7
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,575
Lost their way

8
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:14,671
And this is what happened

9
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:18,309
The strange thing
that happened

10
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:22,788
To two weary hunters

11
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:28,795
Who lost their way

12
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:46,200
Brigadoon

13
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:50,773
Brigadoon

14
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:54,309
Blooming under

15
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:59,848
Sable skies

16
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:04,095
Brigadoon

17
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:08,828
Brigadoon

18
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:11,063
There my heart

19
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:15,836
Forever

20
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,844
Lies

21
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,039
Let the world grow cold

22
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:27,814
Around us

23
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:32,291
Let the heavens

24
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:38,093
Cry above

25
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:43,202
Brigadoon

26
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,674
Brigadoon

27
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:53,679
ln my valley

28
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:57,843
There'll be

29
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:01,854
Love

30
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:44,029
Come all to the square

31
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:50,127
Come all to the square

32
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:52,262
The market square

33
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:55,274
The market square

34
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,604
Salted meat
l'm sellin' there

35
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,647
'' At the square, laddie''

36
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:09,880
Come ye to the fair

37
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:12,982
Ale for sale
or barter there

38
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,617
'' At the square, laddie''

39
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:16,628
Ale for sale
or barter there

40
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:18,926
'' At the square, laddie''

41
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,835
Come all ye down

42
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:26,838
Ye in the town

43
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:30,239
Come ye from the hills

44
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,076
'' Woolen cloth l'm sellin' there
at the square, laddie''

45
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:37,412
Come ye from the mills

46
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,111
Come all ye there

47
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:41,210
Come all ye there

48
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:44,654
Come ye to the fair

49
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:47,955
'' Come ye, all ye''

50
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:51,794
Everywhere to the fair

51
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:55,301
Come ye from the hills

52
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:58,735
Come ye from the mills

53
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:02,206
Come ye in the glen

54
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,833
Come ye bairn

55
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,639
Come ye men

56
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:09,273
Come ye from the loom

57
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,614
Come from pail and broom

58
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:16,053
Hear ye everywhere

59
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:19,114
Don't ye ken
There's a fair

60
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:26,062
Down on MacConnachy Square

61
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:28,657
l'm sellin' a bit
of milk and cream

62
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:30,669
Come sip it and ye will vow

63
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:32,728
That this is
the finest milk and cream

64
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,774
That ever came out a cow

65
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:36,900
Though fine as it is
the price is small

66
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,967
With milk an' the cream alack

67
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,037
There's nothin' to do
but sell it all

68
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:44,083
The cow will not take it back

69
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:48,020
Come all ye there

70
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:51,390
Come all ye there

71
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,052
Come ye to the fair

72
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,652
Now all of ye come
to Sandy here

73
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,527
Come over to Sandy's booth

74
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:00,532
l'm sellin'
the sweetest candy here

75
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,568
That ever shook loose a tooth

76
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,603
l eat it myself
and there's no doubt

77
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:06,639
'Tis creamy and good and thick

78
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:09,402
'' So, laddies, l hope
you'll buy me out''

79
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:11,740
'Tis makin' me kind o' sick

80
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:15,110
Come ye to the fair

81
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:18,446
Come ye to the fair

82
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:21,817
Come ye in the glen

83
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,515
Come ye bairn

84
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,182
Come ye men

85
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:28,591
Come ye from the loom

86
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:31,960
Come from pail and broom

87
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:35,330
Hear ye everywhere

88
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,962
Don't ye ken
There's a fair

89
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,975
Down on MacConnachy Square

90
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:53,008
Let me see that map again.

91
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:58,417
Let's see.
Here's Auchindale.

92
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:01,358
''As l remember, that should be
on the left, and l don't remember.''

93
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,088
lt is.

94
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:04,858
Here's Braekirk.

95
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:06,489
Should be on the right.

96
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:09,057
-Then where the devil are we?
-What's in the middle?

97
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,103
-Nothing.
-That's where we are.

98
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,139
-Nothing?
-Yep.

99
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:15,140
For a fellow
of my potentialities...

100
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,267
this is an ideal location.

101
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:20,312
We'll find our way out
when the mist clears.

102
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,940
Must be depressing to be a bird...

103
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,950
and know the hunting season is on.

104
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:26,952
''The way you aim, the birds
have nothing to worry about.''

105
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,045
Yeah? Watch.

106
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:31,090
Wait a second.
That isn't a grouse.

107
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,421
Fine couple of game hunters we are.

108
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:39,124
''We come here from New York,
and the first night out, we get lost.''

109
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:41,667
Maybe we took the high road
instead of the low road.

110
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,395
''-Like a drink?
-No, thanks.''

111
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,403
Good. That leaves more for me.

112
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,496
You told me
you were gonna cut down.

113
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:50,509
''Yes, l did,
but l'm a terrible liar.''

114
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,602
''Besides, it doesn't pay.''

115
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,374
l remember l was going
with a wonderful girl once...

116
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,917
and she used to plead with me
to give it up.

117
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,452
''So, one day l did.''

118
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,614
''We discovered we had nothing more
to talk about, so we broke up.''

119
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:09,656
There's something about this forest...

120
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:12,425
that gives me the feeling
of being in a cathedral.

121
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:15,262
''lf we were, l'd know
where the exit is.''

122
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:18,270
''-You don't believe in anything, do you?
-Of course l do.''

123
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:19,600
Really? What?

124
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:21,640
Practically anything
l can understand.

125
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,539
Anything that's real to me.

126
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,877
''Things l can touch, taste,
hear, see, smell and swallow.''

127
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:31,007
What about the things
you don't understand?

128
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:32,984
l dismiss 'em.

129
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,986
''Makes it very easy, doesn't it?''

130
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:37,352
''Comfortable, anyhow.''

131
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:39,391
-l envy you.
-Why?

132
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:40,926
You seem so satisfied.

133
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,621
l am. Aren't you?

134
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:45,464
''No, l'm not.''

135
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,795
That's the silliest thing
l ever heard.

136
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,836
You've got a fine job
and you're engaged to a fine girl.

137
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:53,873
You're lost in a fine forest.
What more do you want?

138
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,899
l don't know.
Something seems wrong.

139
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,104
Especially about Jane and me.

140
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,807
That makes everything seem wrong.

141
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:07,012
Look how l postponed getting married.
l can't get myself to that altar.

142
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:10,613
Don't you love her?
You did when we left New York.

143
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,060
Sometimes l think l'm really
not capable of loving.

144
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:18,994
Sometimes l think nobody is anymore.

145
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:20,396
That's nonsense.

146
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,924
Don't start talking yourself
into an inferiority complex.

147
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:26,096
-You don't deserve it.
-What do you mean?

148
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:30,040
Most of my friends who have
an inferiority complex are right.

149
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:32,100
They're not as good
as everybody else.

150
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:35,477
''But you--
young, dashing, loaded.''

151
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:48,218
Hey. Look at that.

152
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:51,422
-lt looks like a village.
-lt is.

153
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:54,159
l thought you said there were
no towns on the map around here.

154
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:57,225
''-l did. You wanna see the map?
-No, l believe you.''

155
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:59,601
Let's go down.
There must be people down there.

156
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:02,106
They must eat food.
That's what we're interested in.

157
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:06,145
Funny it isn't on the map.

158
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,203
Maybe they don't like publicity.

159
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:27,359
Jean. Jean!

160
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:30,368
-Come away from the window.
-l'm tryin' to see Charlie.

161
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:33,166
''l know you are,
and you're not supposed to.''

162
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:36,436
'Tis bad luck to see the groom
before the weddin'.

163
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,306
Put the clothes in the chest.

164
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:40,608
Do you think he's glad
he's marryin' me...

165
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,205
or do you think he's
beginnin' to regret it?

166
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:45,910
''Well, if l see him...''

167
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,247
l'll ask him.

168
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,754
''Now, hurry up.''

169
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:54,449
''Father, how did ye feel
when Mother agreed to marry ye?''

170
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,586
l didn't propose to her.
She proposed to me.

171
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:58,095
Didn't it make you happy?

172
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:01,258
''Aye, her good judgment
pleased me highly.''

173
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:04,030
''Fiona, you'll be sure
to see Charlie and tell him...''

174
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:06,037
to come over to sign
the family Bible.

175
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:08,767
''-Aye, Father.
-l'm off to see Mr. Lundie.''

176
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,274
Attend to the marketing.

177
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:12,937
Buy everything that's needed
for the weddin' supper.

178
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:16,413
''-Aye.
-But remember, just what's needed.''

179
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:19,918
My aim for this occasion
is to be hospitable...

180
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:21,351
not philanthropic.

181
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:27,950
When you gonna think
about marriage for yourself?

182
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:30,587
When l find someone
who makes me think of it.

183
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:33,530
You've never met anyone up 'til now
that made you think of it?

184
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,692
''No, not as yet.''

185
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:38,202
Doesn't that worry you?

186
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,602
''Aye, a little...''

187
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:43,335
but l'm not gonna let it worry me
into marryin' the wrong one.

188
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:47,705
Many a lassie
as everyone knows'll

189
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,217
Try to be married before 25

190
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:56,221
So she'll agree
to most any proposal

191
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:01,522
All he must be
is a man and alive

192
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:06,588
l hold a dream
and there's no compromisin'

193
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:12,605
l know there's one
certain laddie for me

194
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:18,611
One day he'll come
walkin' o'er the horizon

195
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:21,146
But should he not

196
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:23,774
Then an old maid l'll be

197
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:30,753
Foolish ye may say

198
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:36,762
Foolish l will stay

199
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,303
Waitin' for my dearie

200
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:49,637
And happy am l

201
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,941
To hold my heart
'til he comes

202
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:58,814
Strollin' by

203
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:02,753
'' When he comes, my dearie''

204
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:07,156
One look and l'll know

205
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,490
That he's the dearie

206
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:14,499
l've been wantin' so

207
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,433
Though l'll live 40 lives

208
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,733
'Til the day he arrives

209
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:24,071
'' l'll not ever, ever grieve''

210
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,543
For my hope will be high

211
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:30,548
That he'll come strollin' by

212
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,846
For you see

213
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:38,046
l believe

214
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:39,853
That

215
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:44,158
There's a laddie weary

216
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,223
And wanderin' free

217
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,428
Who's waitin'

218
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:54,599
For his dearie

219
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:58,132
Me

220
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:55,600
What do you do
while you're waitin' around

221
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:59,434
For your lad to come your way

222
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,201
'' Well, when no one is lookin'''

223
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:05,142
You kneel on the ground

224
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,839
And you pray and pray

225
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,575
And pray

226
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,847
But when lassies sit
and have no men

227
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,149
'' Oh, how long becomes the night''

228
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:22,717
But l fear the night
is longer when

229
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:25,525
The lad's not right

230
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:33,201
Waitin' for my dearie

231
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:37,208
ls sweeter to me

232
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:41,235
Than wooin' any laddie

233
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:43,714
On the lea

234
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:49,476
Dreamin' of your dearie

235
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:53,321
And idlin' the day

236
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:55,758
That's how l am

237
00:16:55,828 --> 00:17:01,289
And how l'll always stay

238
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:05,394
Though l'll live 40 lives
'til the day he arrives

239
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:09,567
'' l'll not ever, ever grieve''

240
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,701
For my hopes will be high

241
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:14,974
That he'll come strollin' by

242
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:19,245
For you see

243
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:25,052
l believe

244
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:27,354
That

245
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:33,365
There's a laddie weary

246
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,639
And wanderin' free

247
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:44,039
Who's waitin'

248
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,605
For his dearie

249
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,689
Me

250
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:14,363
''Good mornin', Fiona!''

251
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,839
Thanks.

252
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,340
''-Good mornin', Miss Fiona.
-Good mornin', Mr. Beaton.''

253
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,346
-Good day.
-What would you be lookin' for?

254
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:23,439
A waistcoat for my father
for the weddin'.

255
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:27,919
''Of course. Jean and young Dalrymple
are gettin' married today, aren't they?''

256
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:31,354
''lf she had to choose someone
other than my son, Harry...''

257
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:33,858
l'm glad 'twas a lad
as fine as Charlie.

258
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,962
Would you have a waistcoat
of this that would fit him?

259
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,466
l think so. l'll have Harry
run over to the house and see.

260
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:44,025
''Friends, your attention, please!''

261
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:53,473
This is the second day
of our blessing...

262
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:55,036
and so to remind ye...

263
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:58,015
Mr. Lundie has drawn up
a map of our town...

264
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,143
and asked me to hang it
in the public square here...

265
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,450
where ye all can see it
and be reminded.

266
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:09,159
''Now, the boundaries
of our village are:''

267
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:13,164
''To the east, the bridge.
To the west, the old kirk road.''

268
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:16,565
''To the north, the stone fence
at the edge of the forest...''

269
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:19,229
''and to the south, Loch Harold.''

270
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:20,738
Let no one cross...

271
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:24,242
or we shall be ungrateful
before God...

272
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,279
and night shall
fall upon us forever.

273
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,756
The second day of whose blessin'?
'Tis for certain not mine.

274
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:41,292
-l'm truly sorry.
-Do not be.

275
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,090
''lf anyone's goin' to pity me,
let it be me.''

276
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:47,462
'Tis not fair for Charlie Dalrymple
to be weddin' her.

277
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:50,798
He's got everything--
school in Edinburgh and now Jean--

278
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,701
and l've got nothing.

279
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:56,571
Nothing but to be trapped
in this peasant village all my life.

280
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:59,008
Look at it.
The boundaries of a town?

281
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,205
Not to me.

282
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:05,614
'Tis more the dimensions
of my jail.

283
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:32,137
''Hey, sonny, could you tell us
where we could get some breakfast?''

284
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:39,146
That kid's gonna have problems
when he grows up.

285
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:49,817
Pardon me. Could you tell us
where we could find a local inn?

286
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,134
What is this?

287
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,806
ls there a place around here
where we could get some breakfast?

288
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:05,275
''-l do not know, sir.
-What do you know? lt talks.''

289
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,278
What's the name of this town?

290
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,814
l do not know.
You'll have to excuse me.

291
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,253
You're in Brigadoon.

292
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,929
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

293
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:28,455
You must forgive him. l imagine
he was a wee bit taken back.

294
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:30,525
People do not come here
very often.

295
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:33,934
What did you say
the name of this town is?

296
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,303
Brigadoon.

297
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,309
That's funny.
lt isn't on the map.

298
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:39,935
l should not be surprised.

299
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:41,946
You know it isn't on the map?

300
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:43,276
Aye.

301
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:45,510
''That's a little snobbish of you,
don't you think?''

302
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:50,244
-Why isn't it on the map?
-For good reason.

303
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,657
''Well, look, Miss, uh--''

304
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:57,161
-Campbell.
-Thank you.

305
00:21:57,229 --> 00:22:01,666
We're trying to get some breakfast.
ls there an inn around here?

306
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,668
An inn?
l do not think so.

307
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:06,432
''But if you follow the road,
you'll come to MacConnachy Square.''

308
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:08,666
You can find all the food you want
for sale there.

309
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,639
Thank you very much.

310
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,200
You're more than welcome.

311
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:16,137
Good day.

312
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:17,512
Good day.

313
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:21,877
Good day.

314
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:23,251
Good day.

315
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:24,584
Good day.

316
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:56,584
Look!

317
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,051
Funny clothes
they wear around here.

318
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:05,096
Maybe this is the day
they take pictures for postcards.

319
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:30,917
Hello.

320
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,289
lt couldn't be me. There must be
something peculiar about you.

321
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,495
''This milk is for sale,
isn't it?''

322
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:45,560
-Aye.
-Do you mind if l help myself?

323
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:49,300
''One moment, sir.
l'll have to see your money first.''

324
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:51,308
-My money?
-Show 'im the money.

325
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,811
-Look at the date!
-Funny-lookin' thing.

326
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,013
What did you give 'em?
A hunk of uranium?

327
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:06,353
''No, just a shilling.
What a loony layout this is.''

328
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,827
''Aye, 'tis very interesting, sir...''

329
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:11,692
but it does me no good.

330
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:13,857
You mean you won't sell me anything?

331
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:16,958
''l'm sorry, sir. l cannot.''

332
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,297
Why not?

333
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,338
''l cannot explain further, sir.''

334
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:24,442
They just happened in
a wee while ago.

335
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,879
''Well, welcome to Brigadoon.
How did you gentlemen get here?''

336
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:32,712
''We came from Graymore,
six miles yonder.''

337
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:34,912
Six miles.
That's quite a distance.

338
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:38,354
''You must be hungry. Angus, how about
some breakfast for our visitors?''

339
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:40,653
''Charlie, their money--''

340
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,523
l do not want their money.

341
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:45,427
''This is my weddin' day, laddie.
You're my invited guests.''

342
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:49,433
''Help yourselves.
Bread, scones, ginger cakes.''

343
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,470
''Oh, but first,
a bit o' heather ale.''

344
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:55,164
Sandy!

345
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,133
-Here l am.
-Some ale for our guests.

346
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,235
Ale for everybody!

347
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:09,351
So you're getting married today.
That's wonderful.

348
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,082
''Aye, it is.''

349
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,647
''This afternoon,
to Miss Jean Campbell.''

350
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,659
-Campbell?
-Aye.

351
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:21,189
l think l met your bride
a few minutes ago. She's very charming.

352
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:23,734
''Aye, that she is.''

353
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:25,770
Her health.
Her health!

354
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:31,401
-To our visitors!
-Here!

355
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:33,239
And to Mr. Forsythe.

356
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:35,542
l hope he knows
how grateful l am to him...

357
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:37,377
to postponin' the miracle for me.

358
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:40,213
''-That what?
-'Tis a toast we have here, sir.''

359
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:43,686
And may God bless me this evenin'
as much as l would bless him...

360
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:47,350
if l were he
and he were Charles Dalrymple.

361
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,458
l guess we'll not be seein' you
at the tavern anymore.

362
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:55,026
''Aye, lads.
My tavern days are over.''

363
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:59,633
l used to be a rovin' lad

364
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:03,197
A rovin' and wanderin' life
l had

365
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,573
On any lass l'd frown

366
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:09,740
Who would try to tie me down

367
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:14,311
But then one day
l saw a maid

368
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:18,914
Who held out her hand
and l stayed and stayed

369
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:22,188
And now across the green

370
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:27,961
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

371
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,830
'' Go home, go home''

372
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:31,893
Go home with bonnie Jean

373
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,494
'' Go home, go home''

374
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:37,702
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

375
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:05,631
ln Aberdeen l used to know

376
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:09,299
A lass with an air
an' her name was Jo

377
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:11,842
And every night at 10:00

378
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,745
l would meet her
in the glen

379
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:19,909
But now you'll not
see her again

380
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:23,512
Especially not
in the glen at 10:00

381
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:25,988
For now across the green

382
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:27,992
You'll--

383
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,588
Go home with bonnie Jean

384
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:33,494
'' Go home, go home''

385
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:35,362
Go home with bonnie Jean

386
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:37,129
'' Go home, go home''

387
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:41,366
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

388
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,293
Hello to married men l've known

389
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:11,894
l'll soon have a wife
and leave yours alone

390
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,438
A bonnie wife indeed

391
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:19,637
And she's all l'll ever need

392
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:22,509
You wanted her at any cost

393
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:25,948
But how do you know
if you've won or lost

394
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:28,486
And still across the green

395
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:32,683
You'll go home with bonnie Jean

396
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,692
'' Go home, go home''

397
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,591
Go home with bonnie Jean

398
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:38,288
'' Go home, go home''

399
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:41,992
You'll

400
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,035
Go home with bonnie Jean

401
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:05,888
''-Oh, you can't stop now!
-Go on!''

402
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:33,172
'' Go home, go home''

403
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,042
Go home with bonnie Jean

404
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:36,603
'' Go home, go home''

405
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,808
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

406
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:40,647
'' Go home, go home''

407
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:42,482
Go home with bonnie Jean

408
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,215
'' Go home, go home''

409
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:46,348
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

410
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:48,187
'' Go home, go home''

411
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,091
Go home with bonnie Jean

412
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:51,857
'' Go home, go home''

413
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,060
l'll go home

414
00:30:56,134 --> 00:31:00,161
With bonnie

415
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:02,172
'' - Jean
- Go home, go home''

416
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,607
'' Go home, go home
go home, go home''

417
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:08,612
'' Go home with bonnie Jean, aye''

418
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:25,194
Meg Brockie just told me
at the back window...

419
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:27,390
there are two strangers in town.

420
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:29,933
-Aye.
-Ya mean ya know it?

421
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:32,731
Why didn't ya tell me?
Did ya see them?

422
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:35,068
-Aye.
-Tell me about them.

423
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,074
What are they like?
How do they look?

424
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:40,373
''He has brownish hair,
a wee bit taller than father.''

425
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:43,175
-Very nice face.
-What about the other one?

426
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:46,012
''The other? He's about
the same, l imagine.''

427
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:48,882
l really cannot remember.
l only saw them for a moment.

428
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:50,888
Where are they?
Where did they go?

429
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:54,289
To the square for some food.
They've probably left by now.

430
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:02,389
Maybe they haven't.
l'm goin' to see.

431
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,458
l'll pick up the bread for ya.

432
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:08,395
Jean! Are you daft?

433
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,805
How can you even think
of goin' out today?

434
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,900
Supposin' you run into Charlie.

435
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:16,175
Do you want to start out your marriage
under a cloud of bad luck?

436
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:18,341
''-l'll get the bread.
-Oh, but, Fiona--''

437
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:21,579
Who ever heard of a bride bein' seen
on the day of her weddin'?

438
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:24,087
l'm surprised at you
for even thinkin' of it.

439
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:46,342
Lovely.

440
00:32:55,854 --> 00:33:00,154
''Oh, you're a winnin' lad.
A right winnin' lad!''

441
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:02,193
''You've noticed that, have you?''

442
00:33:03,061 --> 00:33:04,619
Do you have a wife?

443
00:33:05,997 --> 00:33:09,057
l never touch the stuff.
l don't believe in marriage.

444
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:11,568
l've seen too many happy love affairs
broken up by it.

445
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:14,833
''Oh, you're a braw and handsome lad,
Mr. Douglas.''

446
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:17,670
You should see me when l'm rested.
l'm almost robust.

447
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,647
We do not have enough lads
in Brigadoon.

448
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:28,277
''Enough for everybody else,
or enough for you?''

449
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:30,617
There are so few single lads
in town.

450
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:32,816
lt's hard for a lass
to catch a husband.

451
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:36,327
lt would be so nice if ya
could stay a while. Could ya?

452
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,328
l'll have to ask my pop.

453
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:46,430
We came over here to hunt grouse.

454
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:48,438
And coming from this hill--

455
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,899
''-Oh.
-Good mornin', dearie.''

456
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:53,910
Father asked me
to remind ya...

457
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:56,378
to be sure and come sign
the family Bible this afternoon.

458
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,040
l'll be over.

459
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:01,051
''-How was breakfast, sir?
-Wonderful. Thanks.''

460
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:04,784
Where's my bride?

461
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:06,118
She's home...

462
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:08,420
palpitatin'.

463
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,151
lsn't that your bride?

464
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:14,164
''No, lad.
That's her older sister, Fiona.''

465
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:23,506
-Do you mind if l have more ale?
-Help yourself.

466
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:33,643
''Here, old tank.
Amuse yourself.''

467
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,652
l thought we were going hunting.

468
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,051
l am.

469
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:41,015
See you at the weddin'.

470
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:44,794
Can l carry that for you?

471
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:47,354
''No, thank you.
l do not have far to go with it.''

472
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:49,423
''You're very busy today,
aren't you?''

473
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:52,129
''-Aye, my sister--
-They told me she's getting married.''

474
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:55,968
-l was overjoyed.
-That's very kind of ya.

475
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,874
''Not at all. ln this case,
her happiness is mine.''

476
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:02,344
''Besides, Charlie's a nice kid.''

477
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,746
''Aye, he is that.''

478
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:07,546
lt's wonderfully refreshing
these days...

479
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,713
to see someone so enthusiastic
about getting married.

480
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:13,155
-ls it so unusual?
-l think so.

481
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:15,818
l was thinking of facing
the minister once...

482
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:18,624
and l certainly wasn't
bubbling over like Charlie.

483
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:20,254
Oh?

484
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:21,491
''Oh, what?''

485
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:23,329
l'm very surprised.

486
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:27,337
You do not look like the sort of lad
who'd be thinkin' of settlin' down.

487
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:31,432
l didn't say that. l just said
l was thinking of getting married.

488
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:33,534
''Well, if ya felt that way...''

489
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:35,579
'tis a very good thing ya didn't.

490
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:41,914
''Yes, l suppose it was
a very good thing l didn't.''

491
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:47,990
''-Good mornin', Fiona.
-Good day, Mrs. Maclntosh.''

492
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:50,892
-This is--
-Albright. Tommy Albright.

493
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,164
-Likewise.
-He's just passin' through.

494
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:58,766
Where do ya come from?

495
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:00,236
From America.

496
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:02,432
You're an American?

497
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:04,407
lsn't that all right?

498
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:06,205
''Aye, of course.''

499
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:09,303
''-The bread, Mrs. Maclntosh.
-Aye.''

500
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,543
Andrew! Come to the window
and look at the stranger!

501
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:14,209
He's an American.

502
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:16,412
She gives us bread
for our potatoes.

503
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:18,718
-That's nice.
-She's a very nice lady.

504
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,052
'Tis just that--

505
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:22,820
People don't come here
very often.

506
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:25,522
Aye. You're very understandin'.

507
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,758
''No, l'm not.''

508
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:31,097
l don't understand one thing
about this place.

509
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:36,071
The bread will be ready in an hour.
l'll bring it to your cottage.

510
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,335
''-Thank you, Mrs. Maclntosh.
-Good day.''

511
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:39,740
Good day.

512
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:49,719
l've been wanting
to do that all day.

513
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,352
Now where?

514
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:56,825
l must gather some heather
for the weddin' decorations.

515
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,556
Where do you do that?

516
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,190
''On the far hill,
where the heather is.''

517
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,435
Do you mind if l come along?

518
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:17,412
-Why did ya want to?
-Why?

519
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,973
''Oh, l don't know exactly.''

520
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:23,043
Maybe it's because
l've nothing much else to do.

521
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:26,454
Or maybe it's because l'm so
full of wonder about this place...

522
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:28,458
and want to stay a little longer.

523
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:32,588
Or maybe it's because
l remember how relieved l was...

524
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:35,861
when l found out it was
your sister's wedding day and not yours.

525
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,635
Can't we two
go walkin' together

526
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,704
Out beyond
the valley of trees

527
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:55,981
Out where there's
a hillside of heather

528
00:37:56,054 --> 00:38:01,822
Curtsyin' gently
in the breeze

529
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:06,489
That's what l'd like to do

530
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:09,624
See the heather

531
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:14,536
But with you

532
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:23,443
The mist of May
is in the gloamin'

533
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:27,780
And all the clouds
are holdin' still

534
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:33,422
So take my hand
and let's go roamin'

535
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:39,088
Through the heather
on the hill

536
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:45,530
The mornin' dew
is blinkin' yonder

537
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:50,540
There's lazy music
in the rill

538
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:54,704
And all l wanna do is wander

539
00:38:54,779 --> 00:39:00,046
Through the heather
on the hill

540
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:05,385
There may be other days
as rich and rare

541
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:10,655
There may be other springs
as full and fair

542
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:13,492
But they won't be the same

543
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:17,523
They'll come and go

544
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:19,570
For this

545
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:24,906
l know

546
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,046
That when the mist
is in the gloamin'

547
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:36,943
And all the clouds
are holdin' still

548
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:42,653
lf you're not there
l won't go roamin'

549
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:48,666
Through the heather
on the hill

550
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:53,969
The heather

551
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:59,977
On the hill

552
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:51,468
''-Here's your waistcoat, Mr. Campbell.
-Thank you, Harry.''

553
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:53,510
'Tis good to see ya.

554
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:56,671
''-Wait a minute, lad.
-What for?''

555
00:43:56,747 --> 00:43:59,511
Why don't ya take my hand?
l'm not your enemy.

556
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:03,485
''Ye may not mean to be, but ye are,
and so is everybody in this town.''

557
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,852
Why do ya hate everybody?

558
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:09,859
l couldn't get through seein' her
marry someone else if l didn't.

559
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:13,727
What else can ya do when ya realize
your life means less than nothin'?

560
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:16,460
l cannot leave here.

561
00:44:16,534 --> 00:44:19,526
l cannot go to the university
and make something o' myself...

562
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:22,436
and l cannot have Jean.

563
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:25,873
So there's nothin' left to do
but to hate everything and everybody...

564
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:28,434
in this cursed town.

565
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:31,242
''You'll never find peace
by hatin', lad.''

566
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:34,182
lt only shuts ya off more
from the world...

567
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:37,414
and this is only a cursed town
if ya make it so.

568
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:40,389
''To the rest of us,
'tis a blessed place.''

569
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:58,138
Who was that?

570
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:01,007
My waistcoat came.
You should be gettin' ready.

571
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:02,875
l was waitin' for Fiona.

572
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:05,472
Where is she?
She's been gone for hours.

573
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:10,821
Go to your room.
Close the door.

574
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:12,822
''Charlie, go 'round to the window.''

575
00:45:20,064 --> 00:45:21,326
Here's the Bible.

576
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:22,991
There's the quill and ink.

577
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:26,036
Now sit ye down there and sign
right under the name...

578
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:28,264
of my dear departed wife.

579
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:30,830
''And when you've done that,
take your leave!''

580
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:32,205
''Aye, sir.''

581
00:46:00,371 --> 00:46:03,499
This is where l come all day
and tend my flock.

582
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:06,509
''When l say it sounds fascinating,
l want you to believe me.''

583
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:13,375
-lt's a very picturesque view.
-Thank ya.

584
00:46:13,451 --> 00:46:16,215
-What for?
-For likin' where l've brought ya.

585
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:18,346
lt makes me very happy.

586
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:20,913
''-You get happy very easily, don't you?
-Aye.''

587
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:27,089
l haven't been in a shed like this
since l was in college...

588
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:30,133
''which at this point seems
a good 2,000 years ago.''

589
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:33,261
''-Ya mean you're tired?
-Aye, lassie, l'm tired.''

590
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:36,272
''That's what you brought me here for,
wasn't it, so l could take a nap?''

591
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,935
l should not think a long walk
would fatigue a young lad like ye.

592
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,535
''-A young lad?
-Aye, you're very young.''

593
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:45,377
That's either a deliberate lie
or wishful thinking.

594
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:48,816
''l am ancient, decrepit
and disintegrating rapidly.''

595
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:51,286
My mother and father
met in this shed.

596
00:46:51,355 --> 00:46:53,050
We all make mistakes.

597
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:54,819
My mother was a gypsy...

598
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:56,860
and one day she was
walkin' past this shed...

599
00:46:56,927 --> 00:46:59,623
and she saw my father
lyin' down asleep.

600
00:46:59,697 --> 00:47:03,224
''She liked his looks,
and she was achin' for a husband.''

601
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,293
''So, she took off her shoes,
sat in the rocking chair there...''

602
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:09,601
and waited for him to wake up.

603
00:47:09,673 --> 00:47:12,369
And it was not long after that
that l was born.

604
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:15,503
That's one of the sweetest
bedtime stories l've ever heard.

605
00:47:17,815 --> 00:47:19,874
''What's under here, your father?''

606
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,555
Thank you very much.
You've been more than kind.

607
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:28,751
''Now, if you want to round out
your generosity, buzz off.''

608
00:47:28,826 --> 00:47:30,885
l just hate to leave ya.

609
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:34,863
''You better. When l sleep,
l make all sorts of odd noises.''

610
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:37,400
Who told ya?
Ya do not have a wife.

611
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:38,958
l was engaged once.

612
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:41,732
You're a right winnin' lad.

613
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:43,739
You should have someone
to take care of ya.

614
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:47,243
l don't know what you're after.
l just wanna go to sleep.

615
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:48,573
Now go!

616
00:47:50,814 --> 00:47:52,076
Go?

617
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:57,179
But do ya not see?
l'm highly attracted to ya.

618
00:47:57,254 --> 00:48:01,384
''Why, when l look at ya, l feel
wee tadpoles jumpin' in my spine.''

619
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:04,950
That's about as repulsive an idea
as l've heard in years.

620
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:08,157
''lf love were a hobby,
you'd be a collector's item.''

621
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:10,257
All you men are all alike.

622
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,894
-l should certainly hope so.
-You're all brutes!

623
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,734
Ya get what ya want from a lass
an' then 'tis farewell!

624
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:18,240
Get what l want?
l can't even get you to go away!

625
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,072
That's what l'm referrin' to.

626
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:23,580
l thought ya wanted to propose to me.
That's why ya brought me here.

627
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:26,678
You misled me.

628
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,913
You sure have one lulu
of an imagination.

629
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:33,047
''Can you think of one good reason
why l, a strange man...''

630
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:36,058
''should be interested in proposing
to you, a mighty strange woman...''

631
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:37,753
and at this hour of the day?

632
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:40,695
''Because you're a lad,
and l'm a lass.''

633
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:43,892
''With that philosophy, you must have
had a provocative career.''

634
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:46,835
Now go. Be off.
Away with ya.

635
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:49,839
-But--
-Go tend your flock.

636
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:51,431
''Fiona! There's some white heather,
lots of it.''

637
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:52,764
''Tommy, stop!''

638
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:58,072
There isn't any
white heather over there.

639
00:49:58,142 --> 00:50:00,133
Of course there is.
There's plenty--

640
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:03,579
What is it?
What frightened you?

641
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,638
'Tis nothin'.

642
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:09,208
ls it the bridge? Why do you have
such a look of fear on your face?

643
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:10,583
l cannot say.

644
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:13,589
Why can't you?

645
00:50:13,657 --> 00:50:17,753
''Fiona, what's the matter?
What's going on around here?''

646
00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:21,497
What was all that business
about Charlie and a miracle?

647
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:02,564
''Hey, look out! Tommy!''

648
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,732
What happened? Tommy!

649
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:06,400
Are you all right?

650
00:51:13,951 --> 00:51:18,217
''lf there's anything l hate,
it's you.''

651
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:20,950
Any civilized person
would be dead by now.

652
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:26,261
Maybe the sun
gave me the power

653
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:31,267
For l could swim Loch Lomond
and be home in half an hour

654
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:35,465
Maybe the air
gave me the drive

655
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:37,803
For l'm all aglow

656
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:43,472
And alive

657
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:47,574
What a day this has been

658
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:50,415
What a rare mood l'm in

659
00:51:50,487 --> 00:51:54,548
Why it's almost
like bein' in love

660
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,692
There's a smile on my face

661
00:51:58,762 --> 00:52:01,424
For the whole human race

662
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:07,027
'' Why, it's almost
like bein' in love''

663
00:52:07,104 --> 00:52:12,406
All the music of life
seems to be

664
00:52:12,476 --> 00:52:17,607
Like a bell that is ringin'
for me

665
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:20,809
And from the way
that l feel

666
00:52:20,884 --> 00:52:23,876
When that bell
starts to peal

667
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:26,787
l could swear l was fallin'

668
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:30,156
l would swear l was fallin'

669
00:52:30,227 --> 00:52:33,856
lt's almost like bein'

670
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:36,661
ln love

671
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:42,569
When we walked up the brae

672
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,803
Not a word did we say

673
00:52:46,877 --> 00:52:48,208
lt was

674
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,150
And her arm linked in mine

675
00:52:59,223 --> 00:53:02,818
Made the world kind of fine

676
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:04,326
lt was

677
00:53:59,082 --> 00:54:01,073
'' Why, it's''

678
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:05,747
Almost like bein' in love

679
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:21,303
'' Why, it's almost like bein'
in love''

680
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:02,044
Life seems to be

681
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:07,307
Like a bell
that keeps ringin'

682
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:10,217
For me

683
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:15,020
And from the way that l feel

684
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:19,119
When that bell starts to peal

685
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:23,223
l would swear l was fallin'

686
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:27,862
l could swear l was fallin'

687
00:55:27,938 --> 00:55:32,875
lt's almost like bein'

688
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:38,882
ln love

689
00:55:55,198 --> 00:55:57,359
-Aren't we headin' back?
-There's no hurry.

690
00:55:57,434 --> 00:55:59,925
Let's stick around a while.
There's gonna be a wedding.

691
00:56:00,003 --> 00:56:02,699
''-Yours?
-Oh, very funny.''

692
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:10,079
l thought we came to Scotland
to go grouse shooting.

693
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:13,446
l'd like to get one little bird
before the day is over.

694
00:56:13,517 --> 00:56:16,418
-What's the matter?
-Hey.

695
00:56:16,486 --> 00:56:20,047
l must be a little touched.
Listen to this.

696
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:22,557
''''''Married: Elizabeth Lang
to Andrew Campbell...''

697
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:26,027
''''''July 2nd, 1719.''''''

698
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:28,690
What about it?
People used to get married then.

699
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:32,531
''No, wait a minute.
''''Children: Fiona.''

700
00:56:32,602 --> 00:56:36,470
''''''Born October 10th, 1732.''

701
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,943
''''''Jean. Born April 8th, 1736.''''''

702
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:42,638
Well?

703
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:46,979
Fiona told me Jean's four years younger.

704
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,610
-Well?
-They're the sisters in this Bible!

705
00:56:49,686 --> 00:56:53,713
That's ridiculous.
They're probably just named after them.

706
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:57,419
''-You know Charlie's last name, right?
-Dalrymple, isn't it?''

707
00:56:57,494 --> 00:56:59,485
''Dalrymple, yes.
Get this.''

708
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:02,031
''''''Married: Jean Campbell to
Charles Chisholm Dalrymple...''

709
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:06,058
''''''May 24th, 1754.''''''

710
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:10,037
Now what do you say?

711
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:12,041
Congratulations.

712
00:57:14,277 --> 00:57:17,041
l don't understand.

713
00:57:17,114 --> 00:57:19,480
No Brigadoon on the map.

714
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:24,380
All those odd things that happened when
l was out with Fiona this afternoon...

715
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:28,220
all that stuff about a miracle...

716
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,225
and now this.

717
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:42,231
Why are you getting so worked up?

718
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,706
''lf it makes 'em happy to disregard
200 years of human bing-bang, let 'em.''

719
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:51,305
''There must be a logical explanation
for this, logical enough even for you.''

720
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:54,544
You don't have to explain
anything to me. l don't care.

721
00:57:58,855 --> 00:58:01,380
What's the matter?

722
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:04,655
ls that your name
in this Bible?

723
00:58:04,728 --> 00:58:05,717
Aye.

724
00:58:05,796 --> 00:58:08,526
Someone seems to have
messed up your book.

725
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:13,066
What does it mean?
You must tell me.

726
00:58:13,136 --> 00:58:15,696
''There is an explanation for it,
isn't there?''

727
00:58:15,772 --> 00:58:18,935
''Aye, there is,
but l cannot tell ya.''

728
00:58:19,009 --> 00:58:22,206
ls there anybody who can?
l've got to know.

729
00:58:22,279 --> 00:58:24,804
-You must talk with the dominie.
-Who?

730
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:26,815
''Our schoolmaster, Mr. Lundie.''

731
00:58:26,883 --> 00:58:29,545
''-Where does he live?
-Down the road in a tree, maybe.''

732
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:34,522
''He does not live in a tree, Mr. Douglas.
Mr. Lundie's a great man.''

733
00:58:34,591 --> 00:58:37,526
''All right, Tommy,
l'll take you to him.''

734
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:44,563
l hadn't wanted to...

735
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:49,333
because it'll be so hard
for you to believe what you'll hear.

736
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:52,134
And l wanted--

737
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:56,379
l wanted you to stay with me...

738
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:58,641
'til the end of our day.

739
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,790
Take us to see Mr. Lundie.

740
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:12,688
Aye.

741
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:16,493
''ls it informal,
or should l wear my Napoleon hat?''

742
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:56,868
''Good day, Mr. Lundie.''

743
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:00,239
''Why, hello, Fiona.
What a pleasant surprise.''

744
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:03,370
''Mr. Lundie, l'd like you
to meet Mr. Tommy Albright...''

745
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:05,880
and Mr. Jeff Douglas.

746
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:07,974
''-Good afternoon, gentlemen.
-How do you do, sir?''

747
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:10,576
Good afternoon.

748
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:12,781
Where do you gentlemen come from?

749
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:14,847
-We're from New York.
-New York?

750
01:00:14,925 --> 01:00:17,325
We changed it from New Amsterdam.

751
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:20,420
-So l understand.
-The British changed it.

752
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:23,261
''Confidentially, though, as soon as
Washington organizes himself...''

753
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:25,699
''we're gonna chase them out,
but keep it under your hat.''

754
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:27,703
''Put a cork in it,
will you, Jeff?''

755
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:30,239
''Mr. Lundie, l was wonderin'
if you'd be good enough...''

756
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:32,707
to tell these gentlemen
about Brigadoon.

757
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:35,108
They've heard and
they've seen a great deal...

758
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:37,271
and they're very perplexed indeed.

759
01:00:37,347 --> 01:00:40,714
-Perplexed is right.
-l would very much like him--

760
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:44,618
l mean them--to know.

761
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:47,088
l see.

762
01:00:47,157 --> 01:00:50,957
''-Will you not be seated, gentlemen?
-Thank you.''

763
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:54,428
''From what l gather, nobody can talk
about the place around here but you.''

764
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:57,398
''-ls that right?
-No, that's wrong.''

765
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:59,662
Mr. Forsythe could've told ya.

766
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:03,570
''Forsythe? l've heard about him,
but l didn't meet him.''

767
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,871
Likely not.
l think he's dead.

768
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,537
''That would stand in the way,
l suppose.''

769
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:13,548
''Let me warn you that what l'm goin'
to tell ya, ya will not believe.''

770
01:01:13,616 --> 01:01:17,609
That's all right.
We've already been warned.

771
01:01:17,687 --> 01:01:19,348
Why won't we believe it?

772
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:23,222
Because what happened
in Brigadoon was a miracle...

773
01:01:23,293 --> 01:01:26,194
and most folks
do not believe in miracles.

774
01:01:26,262 --> 01:01:30,790
''Miracles require faith,
and faith seems to be as dead as--''

775
01:01:30,867 --> 01:01:33,233
Mr. Forsythe?

776
01:01:33,303 --> 01:01:34,497
Aye.

777
01:01:34,571 --> 01:01:38,268
Now this miracle happened--
Let me see.

778
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:40,468
-What day is it?
-Friday.

779
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:46,140
Friday. That means it happened
exactly 200 years ago.

780
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:50,710
Two hundred years ago the Highlands
of Scotland were plagued with witches--

781
01:01:50,787 --> 01:01:53,517
wicked sorcerers who were
takin' the Scottish people...

782
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:58,289
away from the teachings of God
and puttin' the devil into their souls.

783
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:02,559
''They were indeed
horrible, destructive women.''

784
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:06,090
-l do not suppose you have such women.
-Witches?

785
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:08,899
''Oh, we have 'em.
We pronounce it differently.''

786
01:02:08,972 --> 01:02:12,169
lt did not matter that
they were not real sorcerers...

787
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:14,608
because you and l know
there's no such thing...

788
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:18,477
but their influence
was very real indeed.

789
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:21,846
Now we had at that time
in Brigadoon...

790
01:02:21,918 --> 01:02:24,409
an old minister of the kirk...

791
01:02:24,487 --> 01:02:26,455
named Mr. Forsythe...

792
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:29,617
and a good man he was.

793
01:02:29,692 --> 01:02:33,287
-The kindest man in Scotland.
-l believe he was.

794
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:37,527
No man loved his parish
as did Mr. Forsythe...

795
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,263
''but he was gettin' old,
and it grieved him that one day soon...''

796
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:44,033
he'd have to leave
those he loved so well.

797
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:46,735
But most of all
he worried about the witches.

798
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:49,745
''Now mind you, they hadn't
visited us as yet in Brigadoon...''

799
01:02:49,813 --> 01:02:53,977
but he knew that there was
a band of them coming our way.

800
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:58,348
So he began to wonder whether
there was not something he could do...

801
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:02,482
''to protect the folk of his parish,
not only against them...''

802
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,289
but against all the evils
that might come to Brigadoon...

803
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:08,387
from the outside world
after he died.

804
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:11,662
Then one day he came to me
and told me...

805
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:15,864
that he had decided
to ask God for a miracle.

806
01:03:15,939 --> 01:03:20,740
''And on an early Wednesday mornin',
right after midnight...''

807
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:24,439
he went out to a hill
beyond Brigadoon...

808
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:27,915
and made his prayer to God.

809
01:03:27,984 --> 01:03:32,011
''And there, in the hush
of the sleeping world...''

810
01:03:32,088 --> 01:03:35,319
he asked God that night
to make Brigadoon...

811
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:38,121
and all the people in it...

812
01:03:38,194 --> 01:03:42,153
vanish into the highland mist.

813
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:44,757
Vanish...

814
01:03:44,834 --> 01:03:46,859
but not for always.

815
01:03:46,936 --> 01:03:50,133
They would return
just as they were for one day...

816
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:52,606
every hundred years.

817
01:03:52,675 --> 01:03:55,405
The people would lead
their customary lives...

818
01:03:55,478 --> 01:03:58,311
but every day when they awoke...

819
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:01,509
it would be a hundred years later.

820
01:04:01,584 --> 01:04:05,350
And when we awoke next day...

821
01:04:05,421 --> 01:04:09,380
it was a hundred years later.

822
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:13,989
''ln this way,
Mr. Forsythe figured that...''

823
01:04:14,063 --> 01:04:16,293
there'd be no change
in the lives of the people.

824
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:21,235
They just wouldn't be in any century
long enough to be touched by it.

825
01:04:21,304 --> 01:04:23,067
You mean that--

826
01:04:23,139 --> 01:04:25,334
You mean that you
go to bed at night...

827
01:04:25,408 --> 01:04:28,866
''and when you wake up the next day,
it's a hundred years later?''

828
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:30,207
Aye.

829
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:33,874
And every day
is a hundred years later?

830
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,110
Aye.

831
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:37,244
What happened to the minister?

832
01:04:38,488 --> 01:04:40,422
We ne'er saw him again.

833
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:43,687
''You see, he realized
to ask for such a miracle...''

834
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,924
''some sacrifice would have to be made,
and he wanted to be the one to make it.''

835
01:04:47,997 --> 01:04:53,060
''Well, what was the greatest
sacrifice that he could offer?''

836
01:04:53,136 --> 01:04:56,799
lt was to be separated from
those he loved before his time.

837
01:04:56,873 --> 01:05:01,173
And that was why he went out
to a hill beyond Brigadoon...

838
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:04,338
''where, his miracle granted...''

839
01:05:04,414 --> 01:05:07,144
he'd ne'er see Brigadoon again.

840
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:11,482
All this happened
200 years ago?

841
01:05:11,554 --> 01:05:12,885
''Aye, lad.''

842
01:05:12,956 --> 01:05:16,119
''Which of course to us, you see,
is only two days ago.''

843
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:18,558
Let me ask you something.

844
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:24,099
Suppose somebody around here
got fed up and wanted to leave?

845
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:26,135
''-Then what?
-Well, he cannot leave.''

846
01:05:26,202 --> 01:05:30,434
''-You mean, l've gotta stay here now?
-No, lad.''

847
01:05:30,506 --> 01:05:32,974
But according to Mr. Forsythe's
contract with God...

848
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:36,443
if anyone belonging
to Brigadoon leaves...

849
01:05:36,512 --> 01:05:39,037
the enchantment
will be broken for all.

850
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:43,717
''And that night,
when all the people go to sleep...''

851
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:47,222
Brigadoon will disappear forever.

852
01:05:50,093 --> 01:05:53,961
''Look, l'm not saying
l believe all this...''

853
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,498
butjust for argument's sake...

854
01:05:56,566 --> 01:05:58,864
suppose a stranger like--

855
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:01,301
''well, like me--''

856
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:04,568
came to Brigadoon
and wanted to stay.

857
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:06,074
Could he?

858
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:12,338
''Aye, he could.
Mr. Forsythe provided for that.''

859
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:14,440
''He didn't miss a trick, did he?''

860
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:16,712
''No, lad, he did not.''

861
01:06:16,786 --> 01:06:19,983
A stranger can stay
if he loves someone here.

862
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:23,856
''Not Brigadoon itself, mind you,
but someone in Brigadoon...''

863
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:27,054
enough to be willing
to give up everything...

864
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:29,997
to stay near that person.

865
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:33,263
''Which is only right,
because after all, lad...''

866
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:37,602
if you love someone
deeply enough...

867
01:06:37,674 --> 01:06:40,438
anything is possible.

868
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:44,105
Aye. Anything is possible.

869
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,377
''Oh, Fiona, shouldn't you be thinkin'
of changin' for the weddin'?''

870
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:49,384
l had.

871
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:56,253
''Tommy, will l see ya later?''

872
01:06:57,327 --> 01:06:59,261
l'll be there.

873
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:02,231
l'd like to stick around...

874
01:07:02,298 --> 01:07:05,734
and see if this place evaporates
like you say.

875
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:07,565
l must hurry now.

876
01:07:07,637 --> 01:07:09,195
''Good-bye, Mr. Lundie...''

877
01:07:10,807 --> 01:07:12,741
and thank you.

878
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:20,879
She's a dear lassie.

879
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:24,978
''Yes, l'm finding that out.''

880
01:07:25,054 --> 01:07:29,423
''Mr. Lundie, are you all perfectly happy
living here in this little town?''

881
01:07:29,492 --> 01:07:31,983
''Why, of course, lad.''

882
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:36,088
''After all, sunshine can peep
through a wee hole.''

883
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:40,898
But what's it like at night
when you go to sleep?

884
01:07:43,206 --> 01:07:46,972
For me it's like being
carried on shadowy arms...

885
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:49,307
up to a distant cloud...

886
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:53,406
and there l float 'til mornin'.

887
01:07:53,483 --> 01:07:55,075
And yet...

888
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:59,383
sometimes l think
l hear strange voices.

889
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:01,480
-Voices?
-Aye.

890
01:08:01,557 --> 01:08:05,288
They say no words
that l can remember...

891
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:07,295
and yet...

892
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:11,322
they're voices filled
with a fearful longin'.

893
01:08:12,835 --> 01:08:16,737
And often they seem
to call me back.

894
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:21,935
l've pondered over it
when l was awake...

895
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:24,571
and l think...

896
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:29,107
l have a feelin'
l'm hearin' the outside world.

897
01:08:30,686 --> 01:08:35,316
''Oh, there must be
an awful lot of folk out there...''

898
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:38,554
searchin'...

899
01:08:38,628 --> 01:08:40,687
for a Brigadoon.

900
01:09:54,103 --> 01:09:56,162
Buchanan!

901
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:38,346
Douglas!

902
01:10:45,688 --> 01:10:47,781
Lindsey!

903
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:44,612
There's goin' to be a weddin'.

904
01:12:22,418 --> 01:12:26,081
We have no minister
in Brigadoon now.

905
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:30,057
''ln most villages,
this would be a calamitous thing...''

906
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:32,424
but when there is
no minister present...

907
01:12:32,495 --> 01:12:36,329
''it is perfectly proper,
according to the laws of Scotland...''

908
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:41,132
for two people to wed each other
by sincere mutual consent.

909
01:12:41,203 --> 01:12:43,467
There need be nothin' in writin'.

910
01:12:43,539 --> 01:12:45,530
All that is necessary...

911
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:48,543
is that ye promise
to love each other...

912
01:12:48,611 --> 01:12:51,808
while ye both are on Earth.

913
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:54,076
''Go ahead, lad.''

914
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:09,520
l shall love ya 'til l die...

915
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:14,035
and l'll make all effort
to be a good husband to ya.

916
01:13:14,103 --> 01:13:17,231
And so much will l try...

917
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:20,241
to be a fine and lovin' wife.

918
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:27,312
''-Are we married now, Mr. Lundie?
-Aye, lad, you're married.''

919
01:13:29,552 --> 01:13:31,850
''Go on, kiss her, lad.''

920
01:13:41,997 --> 01:13:45,865
''Mr. Forsythe would have liked
to have been here, l know...''

921
01:13:45,935 --> 01:13:49,393
but as long as you're both
good and true to one another...

922
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:52,566
ya cannot fail
but live in the grace of God...

923
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:56,133
and Mr. Forsythe could've
wished no more than that.

924
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:25,678
All l've done
was to want ya too much.

925
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:52,030
l'm leavin' Brigadoon!

926
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:55,338
'Tis the end of all of us!
The miracle is over!

927
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:00,706
''We must stop 'im! Cover the woods!
Sandy and Angus, guard the bridge!''

928
01:19:00,783 --> 01:19:03,377
''Robert, take a group
and spread out along the old kirk!''

929
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:06,979
''Fiona, is it true?
Could he make Brigadoon disappear?''

930
01:19:07,056 --> 01:19:09,991
''Aye, if he gets away.''

931
01:19:30,012 --> 01:19:32,913
Harry Beaton!

932
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:35,472
Harry Beaton!

933
01:19:35,551 --> 01:19:38,145
Harry Beaton

934
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:40,154
Harry Beaton

935
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,966
Run and get him
Get him

936
01:19:54,036 --> 01:19:56,800
Run and get him
Get him

937
01:19:56,872 --> 01:20:02,105
Run ye men or ye will
never see another mornin'

938
01:20:02,177 --> 01:20:04,771
Go and stop him
Stop him

939
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:07,475
Go and stop him
Stop him

940
01:20:07,549 --> 01:20:13,078
Run ye Highland men
or ye won't get another day

941
01:20:13,155 --> 01:20:15,988
Harry Beaton!

942
01:20:21,163 --> 01:20:23,563
Harry Beaton!

943
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,434
Beaton sure came this way

944
01:20:27,503 --> 01:20:30,131
'' And we cannot be
too far behind him, laddie''

945
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:32,765
'' Ye there, head for the brae''

946
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:35,435
'' Keep your eye open
or ye will not find him, laddie''

947
01:20:35,511 --> 01:20:38,105
l'll go down to the creek

948
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:40,808
'' And by God, if l see him
l'll throw him in it''

949
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:43,511
Search the hill to the peak

950
01:20:43,585 --> 01:20:48,852
'' Find him, lads
or tomorrow will never, never come''

951
01:20:48,924 --> 01:20:51,449
Run and get him
Get him

952
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:53,461
Run and get him
Get him

953
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:56,430
Run and get him now

954
01:20:56,498 --> 01:20:59,524
Or ye won't plow another meadow

955
01:20:59,601 --> 01:21:02,365
Go and stop him
Stop him

956
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:04,769
Go and stop him
Stop him

957
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,138
Run ye Highland men

958
01:21:07,209 --> 01:21:10,838
Or ye won't get another day

959
01:21:10,913 --> 01:21:13,211
Harry Beaton!

960
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:23,624
Harry Beaton!

961
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:40,936
lf he comes into sight

962
01:21:41,009 --> 01:21:43,569
Hold him fast
Many lives are depending on it

963
01:21:43,645 --> 01:21:46,205
This must not end tonight

964
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:51,617
They must know that tomorrow
is really going to come

965
01:21:51,687 --> 01:21:54,247
Run and get him
Get him

966
01:21:54,323 --> 01:21:56,917
Run and get him
Get him

967
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,290
Spread your human net

968
01:21:59,361 --> 01:22:02,194
But don't forget
that time's against ya

969
01:22:02,264 --> 01:22:04,892
Go and stop him
Stop him

970
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:07,561
Go and stop him
Stop him

971
01:22:07,636 --> 01:22:10,161
Run ye Highland men

972
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:14,676
Or ye won't get another day

973
01:23:10,632 --> 01:23:13,863
-How did it happen?
-He must've hit his head on a rock.

974
01:23:13,935 --> 01:23:16,267
''Ah, the poor lad!''

975
01:23:25,647 --> 01:23:29,014
''Oh, Harry, my son, my son.''

976
01:23:29,084 --> 01:23:32,281
How could ya be so ungrateful?

977
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:35,084
''Oh, l'm so ashamed for ye.''

978
01:23:35,157 --> 01:23:37,751
l'm so ashamed for ye.

979
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:42,126
''Look here, all of ya. There's been
enough sorrow for one weddin' night.''

980
01:23:42,197 --> 01:23:45,724
Don't tell anyone he's dead.
Just say he was stopped.

981
01:23:45,801 --> 01:23:48,292
They can find out in the mornin'.

982
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:59,611
l'll take him to my cottage.

983
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:01,842
No one will see him.

984
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:35,509
''-Father, what happened?
-lt's all right. The alarm is over.''

985
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:38,314
''-Was he hurt bad?
-No, just scratched a wee bit.''

986
01:24:38,387 --> 01:24:40,321
He'll be fine and fit
in the mornin'.

987
01:24:40,389 --> 01:24:43,187
Now let's all come back
to the weddin' supper.

988
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:47,326
''-Aren't ya comin', Fiona?
-Aye, Father.''

989
01:24:54,202 --> 01:24:56,136
''Angus, did ya see
Tommy, the American?''

990
01:24:56,204 --> 01:24:59,731
''Aye, dearie.
l saw him cross the bridge.''

991
01:24:59,808 --> 01:25:01,867
''Angus, did he come back?''

992
01:25:01,943 --> 01:25:04,104
l did not see him.

993
01:25:54,563 --> 01:25:57,691
They stopped him just in time.
He wasn't far from the brook.

994
01:25:57,766 --> 01:26:00,530
''Yes, they told me.''

995
01:26:00,602 --> 01:26:04,197
''Oh, Fiona, when l think
what could have happened--''

996
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,466
''Your whole world, gone forever.''

997
01:26:08,543 --> 01:26:12,536
l thought my world was gone.
l thought you'd left.

998
01:26:13,949 --> 01:26:16,918
Without saying good-bye to you?

999
01:26:16,985 --> 01:26:19,249
You know l wouldn't do that.

1000
01:26:19,321 --> 01:26:21,255
l know ya wouldn't have.

1001
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:33,292
''Tommy, darlin'.''

1002
01:28:36,691 --> 01:28:39,251
l can't leave you.

1003
01:28:39,327 --> 01:28:40,817
l can't.

1004
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:45,598
Lundie said you could stay
if you love someone enough...

1005
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:47,294
and l do.

1006
01:28:48,603 --> 01:28:50,628
l love you.

1007
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:54,232
l'd better hurry and find him.
There's not much time.

1008
01:29:15,997 --> 01:29:18,557
-Are they after you now?
-l'm looking for Lundie.

1009
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:21,693
l've got something
very important to tell you.

1010
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:24,466
l'm not going back with you.
l'm gonna stay here.

1011
01:29:24,539 --> 01:29:26,769
''Oh, that's nice.''

1012
01:29:26,841 --> 01:29:29,537
''Please, Jeff, be serious,
just for once.''

1013
01:29:29,611 --> 01:29:32,409
l am. l'm being serious
all over the place.

1014
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,779
''l tell ya, l feel more
a part of her and all this...''

1015
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:39,013
than l ever felt about Jane
or anybody or anything back home.

1016
01:29:39,087 --> 01:29:42,648
-Great.
-l can't give it up. l belong here.

1017
01:29:42,724 --> 01:29:46,057
''Yeah, you belong here, all right.
No doubt about it.''

1018
01:29:46,127 --> 01:29:49,426
''Milking cows in the morning,
planting little things...''

1019
01:29:49,497 --> 01:29:51,556
''weaving, butter churning.''

1020
01:29:51,633 --> 01:29:54,158
''That's for you, boy.
You'll have a ball.''

1021
01:29:54,235 --> 01:29:57,693
''And just think,
you can do it for always, always...''

1022
01:29:57,772 --> 01:30:01,469
''in a town that's got one of
the longest ''''always'''' on record.''

1023
01:30:01,543 --> 01:30:05,479
lt's got nothing to do with
all these things you're talking about.

1024
01:30:05,547 --> 01:30:07,845
Don't you see?
l believe in her.

1025
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:11,408
''And what's more, l believe
in this place, and l can't leave.''

1026
01:30:11,486 --> 01:30:14,046
''Well, kiddies,
that's what happened to Tommy today.''

1027
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:18,081
''But what about his friend, Jeff?
Well, he had fun too.''

1028
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:21,560
Tonight he went running off through
the woods after some Highland hothead...

1029
01:30:21,629 --> 01:30:24,063
who was gonna make
all the people disappear...

1030
01:30:24,132 --> 01:30:26,396
by crossing the wrong street.

1031
01:30:27,802 --> 01:30:30,236
''Well, after a while
Jeff thought he saw a bird...''

1032
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:34,036
''perched low in a tree,
and he shot at it.''

1033
01:30:34,109 --> 01:30:36,407
Something fell to the ground.

1034
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:39,936
''He rushed over to it,
and what do you think it was?''

1035
01:30:40,014 --> 01:30:41,743
lt was Hothead Harry.

1036
01:30:41,816 --> 01:30:46,913
''Yes, sir, the boy dervish himself,
lying there looking all dead.''

1037
01:30:46,988 --> 01:30:48,387
You mean you--

1038
01:30:48,456 --> 01:30:52,256
To kill somebody somewhere else in the
world would have been an awful thing.

1039
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:56,286
But Harry was a citizen
of the little town that wasn't there...

1040
01:30:56,364 --> 01:30:58,696
and he probably never lived
in the first place.

1041
01:30:58,767 --> 01:31:01,133
''Chances are,
there weren't even any woods.''

1042
01:31:01,202 --> 01:31:04,000
''ln fact, the whole day
probably never even happened...''

1043
01:31:04,072 --> 01:31:07,439
''because, you see,
this is a fairy tale.''

1044
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:11,445
''Oh, Jeff, you poor guy.
You must feel horrible.''

1045
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:13,105
''What do you mean, l must feel?''

1046
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:15,843
What am l supposed to feel
in a voodoo joint like this?

1047
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:19,353
''Dream stuff, boy, all made up
out of broomsticks and wishing wells.''

1048
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:22,685
lt's that or a boot camp for lunatics.
l don't know what goes on around here.

1049
01:31:22,757 --> 01:31:26,056
''All l know is that whatever it is,
it's got nothing to do with me or you...''

1050
01:31:26,127 --> 01:31:28,721
and anything that happens
to either of us just doesn't count!

1051
01:31:28,797 --> 01:31:30,924
How can it when
you don't understand it?

1052
01:31:30,999 --> 01:31:34,366
''And you want to give up your family,
your friends, your whole life for this?''

1053
01:31:34,435 --> 01:31:36,369
lt's not even worth arguing about.

1054
01:31:36,437 --> 01:31:40,533
Now go say good-bye to the little people
and thank them for the picnic.

1055
01:31:43,545 --> 01:31:46,878
''You're confused, aren't you, boy?''

1056
01:31:46,948 --> 01:31:50,782
''You know, if you believed as much
as you think you do, you wouldn't be.''

1057
01:31:55,657 --> 01:31:59,423
''Tommy, Fiona tells me
you want to stay.''

1058
01:31:59,494 --> 01:32:01,894
l'll wait for you by the bridge.

1059
01:32:03,164 --> 01:32:06,964
''Tommy, what did he mean by that?''

1060
01:32:08,036 --> 01:32:10,231
What is it?

1061
01:32:10,305 --> 01:32:13,035
''Fiona, it's me.
l thought--''

1062
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,940
''Do not be ashamed
of yourself, lad.''

1063
01:32:22,016 --> 01:32:24,746
lt's the hardest thing in the world
to give everything...

1064
01:32:24,819 --> 01:32:28,050
though it's usually the only way
to get everything.

1065
01:32:33,595 --> 01:32:37,258
''You'd better hurry, Fiona.
There's not much time left.''

1066
01:32:44,839 --> 01:32:48,570
''Fiona, do you understand at all?''

1067
01:32:48,643 --> 01:32:51,703
-l think so.
-Then you're not sorry l came?

1068
01:32:51,779 --> 01:32:55,442
''No, l'm glad.
l'll be less lonely now.''

1069
01:32:55,516 --> 01:32:58,781
Real loneliness is not
bein' in love in vain...

1070
01:32:58,853 --> 01:33:01,378
but not bein' in love at all.

1071
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:05,358
-lf l only had more time.
-lt's not your fault.

1072
01:33:09,297 --> 01:33:11,561
'Tis the end of our day!

1073
01:33:24,145 --> 01:33:27,603
''-lt isn't because l don't love you.
-l know, l know.''

1074
01:33:27,682 --> 01:33:30,173
''But to stay, l had to have
no fears and no doubts.''

1075
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:32,185
''Aye, Tommy, aye.''

1076
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:54,904
''Good-bye, Tommy...''

1077
01:33:54,976 --> 01:33:58,537
''and do not forget
any day, any night...''

1078
01:33:58,613 --> 01:34:01,446
that always and always...

1079
01:34:01,516 --> 01:34:03,643
l love you.

1080
01:34:03,718 --> 01:34:06,016
l love you.

1081
01:34:06,087 --> 01:34:07,987
l love you.

1082
01:34:09,057 --> 01:34:10,786
l love you.

1083
01:34:11,993 --> 01:34:13,824
l love you.

1084
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:42,656
''Peter, Peter,
l left the dogs in the car.''

1085
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:46,524
Will you be a dear and ask the driver
to take them home and feed them?

1086
01:34:51,632 --> 01:34:54,760
''l can't afford to get a divorce,
what with community property and taxes.''

1087
01:34:54,836 --> 01:34:57,532
-But alimony is deductible.
-But she'll want capital.

1088
01:34:57,605 --> 01:35:00,369
l can't give her that.
lt isn't fair to the children.

1089
01:35:00,441 --> 01:35:04,935
''Darling, l'm so sorry l'm late,
but l had the most agonizing afternoon.''

1090
01:35:05,013 --> 01:35:07,573
My new analyst is divine.

1091
01:35:07,648 --> 01:35:10,048
He has the most
marvelous new theory.

1092
01:35:10,118 --> 01:35:14,555
He believes that childhood
hasn't got anything to do with anything.

1093
01:35:14,622 --> 01:35:17,284
-Sounds dreamy.
-l've got my standards.

1094
01:35:17,358 --> 01:35:20,452
''l'll lie, cheat,
steal for this company...''

1095
01:35:20,528 --> 01:35:23,520
but l will not
give up my integrity.

1096
01:35:23,598 --> 01:35:27,659
l feel that a man is of value
to the organization as long as he--

1097
01:35:29,937 --> 01:35:33,304
''-Yes, it arrived this afternoon.
-Have Andre fix it for a party at 6:00.''

1098
01:35:33,374 --> 01:35:36,605
Tell him for me that if he
messes up the sauce this time--

1099
01:35:36,677 --> 01:35:40,204
''Great little car.
Hiya, Jeff.''

1100
01:35:40,281 --> 01:35:42,613
Once you get into
one of those foreign cars--

1101
01:35:42,683 --> 01:35:46,346
''But, honey, why don't you
try and see my side of it?''

1102
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:48,355
''Frank, bring me another brandy.''

1103
01:35:48,423 --> 01:35:50,721
''-lt's bourbon, sir.
-lt is?''

1104
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:54,319
''That's all you've had for four months,
ever since you got back from Scotland.''

1105
01:35:54,395 --> 01:35:57,592
ls that right?
l just decided l don't like it.

1106
01:35:57,665 --> 01:36:00,759
lt's not near as good as the whiskey
Mother used to make. l'll have brandy.

1107
01:36:00,835 --> 01:36:03,668
''-Yes, sir.
-Honey, l can't get home tonight.''

1108
01:36:03,738 --> 01:36:07,572
''l know, but l can't
let the boss down.''

1109
01:36:07,642 --> 01:36:10,202
He's got this girl
that he wants to take out...

1110
01:36:10,278 --> 01:36:14,612
and he needs another man along
so it won't look like she's with him.

1111
01:36:15,483 --> 01:36:17,747
''Yes, dear.''

1112
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:20,185
''You'd better bring me
two glasses of water, Frank.''

1113
01:36:20,254 --> 01:36:24,418
''l know, baby, but we can celebrate
your birthday tomorrow night.''

1114
01:36:24,492 --> 01:36:28,622
''Honey, l can't take any longer.
l've gotta get back. Talk to you later.''

1115
01:36:28,696 --> 01:36:31,028
Frank? Sorry.

1116
01:36:32,533 --> 01:36:35,024
''-Sorry.
-Would you like dinner, Mr. Douglas?''

1117
01:36:35,103 --> 01:36:37,333
-No. Bring me my lunch check.
-Certainly.

1118
01:36:37,405 --> 01:36:39,737
l think l'll eat out tonight.

1119
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:46,137
''-Frank, bring me another.
-So soon? Where's the last one?''

1120
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:49,945
lt vanished...
like Brigadoon.

1121
01:36:50,017 --> 01:36:51,951
''Like who, sir?''

1122
01:36:52,019 --> 01:36:54,681
That was the name
of my brother who ran away.

1123
01:36:59,527 --> 01:37:02,394
''Good evening, Mr. Albright.
Your table will be ready in a moment.''

1124
01:37:02,463 --> 01:37:04,397
''-Thank you, Peter.
-Tommy, Tommy.''

1125
01:37:04,465 --> 01:37:06,899
What's your opinion
about the Parker deal?

1126
01:37:06,968 --> 01:37:10,165
-l'll let you know tomorrow.
-l've got a real slant on it--

1127
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:13,002
l'll tell you tomorrow.
l'll give you a call.

1128
01:37:13,074 --> 01:37:16,874
''Albright, how about that meeting
this morning? Was that great?''

1129
01:37:16,944 --> 01:37:19,139
-Great.
-Things were brought out in the open.

1130
01:37:19,213 --> 01:37:21,545
-Let in a lot of fresh air.
-Great.

1131
01:37:21,616 --> 01:37:24,244
-Do you like how l handled the old man?
-Great.

1132
01:37:24,318 --> 01:37:26,252
''Thanks, Albright.''

1133
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:31,658
-Hi.
-Hi.

1134
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:34,354
-lt's hot in here.
-lt's not the heat. lt's the humanity.

1135
01:37:34,428 --> 01:37:37,829
''-Good evening, Mr. Albright.
-Oh, thank you, Frank.''

1136
01:37:37,899 --> 01:37:40,299
-Have you seen Jane?
-She meeting you here?

1137
01:37:40,368 --> 01:37:43,360
-Yeah.
-l'll drink up and get outta here.

1138
01:37:43,437 --> 01:37:46,668
There's nothing a woman hates more
than her fianc's best friend.

1139
01:37:46,741 --> 01:37:50,700
He knows the secrets she's gonna spend
the rest of her life tryin' to find out.

1140
01:37:50,778 --> 01:37:54,236
-l've been dodging her for a month now.
-Don't worry about it.

1141
01:37:54,315 --> 01:37:57,648
''l always say, scratch the surface
of any woman and she'll enjoy it.''

1142
01:37:57,718 --> 01:38:00,448
-When are you getting married?
-l don't know.

1143
01:38:00,521 --> 01:38:04,048
-l don't know if l want to get married.
-Why?

1144
01:38:04,125 --> 01:38:06,889
''Because, old tank,
l'm in love with someone else...''

1145
01:38:06,961 --> 01:38:09,657
''and l ''''canna'''' get over it.''

1146
01:38:11,899 --> 01:38:16,302
''And the trouble is, because l can't
be with her, l can't be with anyone.''

1147
01:38:16,370 --> 01:38:18,634
So many things
remind me of her.

1148
01:38:18,706 --> 01:38:21,140
''l'll be talking with people,
and they might say one little word...''

1149
01:38:21,209 --> 01:38:25,236
''that opens the door
to a memory for me, and then...''

1150
01:38:25,313 --> 01:38:29,909
''l'm a few thousand miles away with--
well, you know.''

1151
01:38:29,984 --> 01:38:34,546
''But slowly l come back to the
conversation, they ask me a question...''

1152
01:38:34,622 --> 01:38:37,056
and l don't know what in the world
they've been talking about.

1153
01:38:37,124 --> 01:38:41,254
-l haven't heard a word.
-You must be fascinating company.

1154
01:38:41,329 --> 01:38:42,762
lt ain't easy.

1155
01:38:53,841 --> 01:38:55,775
''-Hello, Jane!
-Hello, Jane!''

1156
01:38:55,843 --> 01:38:58,437
''-You've certainly been elusive.
-Hello, Jeff.''

1157
01:38:58,512 --> 01:39:00,878
l've been up to my neck at the office.
Would you like a drink?

1158
01:39:00,948 --> 01:39:04,076
''Love one. An old-fashioned, please,
and would you bring it to the table?''

1159
01:39:04,151 --> 01:39:07,245
''-How are you, Jeff?
-Darling, it's been weeks.''

1160
01:39:07,321 --> 01:39:09,687
''-Fine, Jane. How are you?
-l'm sorry.''

1161
01:39:09,757 --> 01:39:11,987
''Oh, l've had a little cold,
but other than that--''

1162
01:39:12,059 --> 01:39:15,460
-But you could've called more often.
-l hate to eat and run.

1163
01:39:15,529 --> 01:39:17,622
''-Your table is ready, Mr. Albright.
-Thank you.''

1164
01:39:17,698 --> 01:39:19,666
-l'll call you later.
-Hello!

1165
01:39:19,734 --> 01:39:23,067
''Good-bye!
Frank, put it on the bill.''

1166
01:39:23,137 --> 01:39:26,470
''-Your bill, sir, is very high.
-So am l!''

1167
01:39:30,811 --> 01:39:32,904
''-Jane, you look fine.
-So do you.''

1168
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:36,643
''-Would you care to order dinner now?
-No, we'll finish our drinks first.''

1169
01:39:36,717 --> 01:39:39,379
''Darling, l wish you'd been
with me over the weekend.''

1170
01:39:39,453 --> 01:39:42,980
''l went up to Connecticut, house hunting.
Saw the most wonderful place.''

1171
01:39:43,057 --> 01:39:47,289
''Rather interesting. Colonial,
and right on top of a beautiful hill.''

1172
01:39:47,361 --> 01:39:50,558
Through the heather

1173
01:39:50,631 --> 01:39:53,566
On the hill

1174
01:39:54,969 --> 01:39:57,301
The mornin' dew

1175
01:39:57,371 --> 01:40:01,569
ls blinkin' yonder

1176
01:40:01,642 --> 01:40:04,167
There's lazy music

1177
01:40:04,245 --> 01:40:08,204
On the rill

1178
01:40:08,282 --> 01:40:13,584
And all l want to do is wander

1179
01:40:13,654 --> 01:40:16,748
Through the heather--

1180
01:40:16,824 --> 01:40:19,418
''And l didn't think you'd
want to do that, would you?''

1181
01:40:19,493 --> 01:40:22,326
''Hmm? Uh, maybe.''

1182
01:40:22,396 --> 01:40:24,591
''You mean, you'd even consider it?''

1183
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:26,064
What?

1184
01:40:26,133 --> 01:40:28,624
Commuting from
60 miles out of New York.

1185
01:40:28,703 --> 01:40:31,797
''-No, l wouldn't wanna do that.
-l didn't think so.''

1186
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,636
And l told Mr. Bradville.

1187
01:40:34,709 --> 01:40:37,906
-Who?
-Herbert Bradville.

1188
01:40:39,313 --> 01:40:42,009
''-Who's he?
-Darling, he's the real estate man...''

1189
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,916
l just told you
l've been working with.

1190
01:40:44,985 --> 01:40:49,649
''l told him you'd call, so please do.
l'm trying hard to arrange everything.''

1191
01:40:49,724 --> 01:40:53,751
''By the way, do you still want
Jeff to stand up for you?''

1192
01:40:53,828 --> 01:40:57,161
''Yes, if he can.''

1193
01:40:57,231 --> 01:40:58,664
Why?

1194
01:40:59,734 --> 01:41:03,568
Nothing. lt's just
he's so impossible these days.

1195
01:41:03,637 --> 01:41:06,105
Everybody's bored to death with him.

1196
01:41:06,173 --> 01:41:09,074
''Maybe l'm not interested
in everybody, Jane.''

1197
01:41:09,143 --> 01:41:13,705
''Well, you certainly have been antisocial
since you got back from Scotland.''

1198
01:41:13,781 --> 01:41:16,944
l thought for a while there was
something really bothering you.

1199
01:41:17,017 --> 01:41:19,076
You certainly wouldn't
keep me waiting and--

1200
01:41:19,153 --> 01:41:23,385
Waitin' for my dearie

1201
01:41:23,457 --> 01:41:27,655
And happy am l

1202
01:41:27,728 --> 01:41:30,094
To hold my heart

1203
01:41:30,164 --> 01:41:36,399
'Til he comes strollin' by

1204
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:39,166
''-Give me a ring, won't you?
-Oh, of course.''

1205
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:43,142
'' When he comes, my dearie''

1206
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:47,442
One look and l'll know

1207
01:41:47,515 --> 01:41:49,915
That he's the dearie

1208
01:41:49,984 --> 01:41:54,785
l've been wantin' so

1209
01:41:54,855 --> 01:41:58,450
''-When l see you wander around like--
-No, Jane. No.''

1210
01:41:58,526 --> 01:42:02,121
-No what?
-There won't be a wedding next month.

1211
01:42:02,196 --> 01:42:05,597
''-Do you mean you're postponing it again?
-No, Jane, l'm not postponing it.''

1212
01:42:05,666 --> 01:42:08,863
-l'm calling it off for good.
-Calling it off?

1213
01:42:08,936 --> 01:42:11,962
''Jane, l'm sorry.
You've been wonderful, darling.''

1214
01:42:12,039 --> 01:42:15,497
''lt's not your fault, but something
strange happened to me a few months ago.''

1215
01:42:15,576 --> 01:42:18,568
''l can't explain it,
but l just don't fit here anymore.''

1216
01:42:18,646 --> 01:42:21,240
You've gone clean out of your mind.

1217
01:42:21,315 --> 01:42:24,944
We can't stand here and talk about it.
Let's go home and--

1218
01:42:25,019 --> 01:42:28,853
''Go home, go home
Go home with bonnie Jean''

1219
01:42:28,923 --> 01:42:30,481
'' Go home, go home''

1220
01:42:30,558 --> 01:42:33,220
''lf you want to stay and make
a fool of yourself, you can.''

1221
01:42:33,294 --> 01:42:35,228
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

1222
01:42:35,296 --> 01:42:38,925
'' Go home, go home
Go home with bonnie Jean''

1223
01:42:41,168 --> 01:42:44,103
Until l'm old enough
for Social Security...

1224
01:42:44,171 --> 01:42:46,401
l've got my expense account.

1225
01:42:46,474 --> 01:42:49,841
''But most important of all,
l'm building.''

1226
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:54,779
Building every day. That's about
the only security a man can have.

1227
01:42:54,849 --> 01:42:57,841
''Hello. Room 732, please.''

1228
01:42:57,918 --> 01:43:00,478
''Jeff, are you sober?
Listen to me.''

1229
01:43:00,554 --> 01:43:03,489
l wanna go back to Scotland.
You wanna come along?

1230
01:43:03,557 --> 01:43:06,390
Never mind what for!
Do you wanna come with me?

1231
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:08,985
''Okay, get plane reservations
right away.''

1232
01:43:09,063 --> 01:43:12,658
''l know it isn't there,
but l wanna see where it was!''

1233
01:43:12,733 --> 01:43:16,829
''Who cares if it doesn't make sense?
Jeff, l wanna go!''

1234
01:43:16,904 --> 01:43:18,667
l've got to!

1235
01:43:31,519 --> 01:43:33,851
lt's unbelievable.

1236
01:43:33,921 --> 01:43:37,516
-Awful and unbelievable.
-What is?

1237
01:43:37,591 --> 01:43:41,618
''To think that down there, somewhere
between the mist and the stars...''

1238
01:43:41,695 --> 01:43:46,530
''there's someone l want so terribly,
and l know she's not dead.''

1239
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:51,401
''She's only asleep,
and yet l'll never see her again.''

1240
01:43:51,472 --> 01:43:54,532
''Well, you didn't have to come
all the way over here just to say that.''

1241
01:43:54,608 --> 01:43:58,135
You could've told me on the phone
back in New York for a dime.

1242
01:43:58,212 --> 01:44:00,544
''No, l'll tell you why.''

1243
01:44:00,614 --> 01:44:03,845
She became so alive to me that
l had to come back and see for myself...

1244
01:44:03,918 --> 01:44:06,785
if the place really wasn't here.

1245
01:44:06,854 --> 01:44:09,482
lt didn't work that way for me.

1246
01:44:09,557 --> 01:44:12,082
lt's so much like a dream now
that l have to work hard...

1247
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:14,957
to convince myself
it happened at all.

1248
01:44:15,029 --> 01:44:17,623
''There's the big difference
between us, Jeff.''

1249
01:44:17,698 --> 01:44:21,099
''Oh, tell me about it.''

1250
01:44:22,736 --> 01:44:25,705
l found that...

1251
01:44:25,773 --> 01:44:29,539
sometimes the things you believe in
become more real to you...

1252
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:33,671
than all the things
you can explain away or understand.

1253
01:44:35,683 --> 01:44:38,516
''Oh, why do people
have to lose things...''

1254
01:44:38,586 --> 01:44:41,419
to find out
what they really mean?

1255
01:44:43,457 --> 01:44:45,857
''Well, let's start walkin'.''

1256
01:44:45,926 --> 01:44:48,827
l got lost around here once.

Brigadoon

1259
01:44:57,037 --> 01:45:00,564
Blooming under

1260
01:45:00,641 --> 01:45:04,907
Sable skies

1261
01:45:07,181 --> 01:45:10,639
Brigadoon

1262
01:45:10,718 --> 01:45:15,087
Brigadoon

1263
01:45:15,155 --> 01:45:21,094
There my heart forever

1264
01:45:21,161 --> 01:45:24,892
Lies

1265
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:30,268
Let the world grow cold

1266
01:45:30,337 --> 01:45:33,932
Around us

1267
01:45:34,008 --> 01:45:38,604
Let the heavens

1268
01:45:38,679 --> 01:45:41,580
Cry above

1269
01:45:43,017 --> 01:45:44,951
Tommy!

1270
01:45:54,395 --> 01:45:56,829
''Tommy, lad, you!''

1271
01:45:56,897 --> 01:46:01,095
''My, my, you must really love her.
You woke me up.''

1272
01:46:02,369 --> 01:46:04,894
''Come, lad.''

1273
01:46:21,689 --> 01:46:24,214
You shouldn't be too surprised.

1274
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:27,556
''l told ya, if ya loved
someone deeply enough...''

1275
01:46:27,628 --> 01:46:30,290
anything is possible.

1276
01:46:33,033 --> 01:46:35,558
Even miracles.

There'll be

Love

1282
01:47:41,702 --> 01:47:45,468
There'll be love
