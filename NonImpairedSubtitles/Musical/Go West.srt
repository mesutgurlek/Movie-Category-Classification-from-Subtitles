1
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,140
- Any of you boys got change for 10 cents?
- No, sir.

2
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,100
Well, keep the baggage.

3
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,020
Tickets for the West at this window!

4
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,100
One ticket for the West, end of line.

5
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,100
Yes, sir. That'll be $70, please.

6
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,780
There's your $70.

7
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,620
Don't bother counting it.

8
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,940
- There's only $60 here.
- I told you not to count it.

9
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,140
You need $10 more.

10
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,700
It's highway robbery.
No wonder you're behind bars.

11
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,420
I'll get that other $10.

12
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,100
Someday I'll be president of this railroad,
and when I am...

13
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,220
Hey, mister.

14
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,580
Is this the right way for my brother
to get on the train for the West?

15
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,180
Not unless they're throwing
a masquerade party out West, it isn't.

16
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,860
- All we wanna know is where's the train.
- The train? It's out on the tracks.

17
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,900
It seldom comes in here.

18
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,380
Come on, Rusty, I'll buy you a ticket.

19
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,020
Where's your $70?

20
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,980
You only got $10?
What did you do with the other $60?

21
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,140
You buy a snake?

22
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,140
I can't get you a ticket
if you ain't got enough money.

23
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,340
Money?

24
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,140
- You two gents are heading West, partner?
- Not me. Just my brother.

25
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,580
You see, I got no money.
So he's going West.

26
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,380
When he gets off the train,
he'll pick up some gold and send it to me.

27
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,260
They say the gold is laying
all over the streets.

28
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,620
All over the streets you find the gold.

29
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,580
The way he's dressed, he looks like
he was laying all over the streets.

30
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,460
Of course the gold is all over the streets,
but they won't let him take any.

31
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,740
He's a tenderfoot.

32
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,220
You wear those shoes,
you've got tender feet, too.

33
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,540
Those are shoes?
I thought that was fungus with buttons.

34
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,100
All right, suppose he's got tender feet.
You don't pick up gold with feet.

35
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,740
No, you don't understand.
A tenderfoot is an easterner.

36
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,140
Out West, they shoot at anything
that looks Eastern.

37
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,580
They'll blow his head off if he goes
out West with that flea incubator.

38
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,340
What's the matter with that hat?
It cost a lot of money.

39
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,580
- How much did it cost him?
- I don't know. He stole it.

40
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,140
- What's the idea?
- Wait a minute!

41
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,660
I'm just trying to save his life.

42
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,660
- You love your brother, don't you?
- No, but I'm used to him.

43
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,340
Now, this is the kind of hat
they're wearing this season.

44
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,300
This is the 1870 model.

45
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,260
It's what they call a pioneer's cap.

46
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,300
Isn't that tail supposed to be in the back?

47
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,860
Not on him.

48
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,020
- That's genuine beaver.
- It's pretty.

49
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,900
I'll stroke it. It's still my hat, you know.
That'll be $10.

50
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,580
- You want $10 for that old beaver?
- I'm not in business for love.

51
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,660
I was in love once and I got the business.

52
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,340
But that's another story,
and a very unpleasant one, too.

53
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,420
Why should he buy a hat?
He ain't got enough money for a ticket.

54
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,580
You can always get a ticket.
But this is the last hat of its kind.

55
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,380
The Beavers have stopped making them.
They're all out playing football. $10.

56
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,860
He's a poor boy. He'll give you $1.

57
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,340
You take it?

58
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,260
I'll take it, but I'm only making $1 on it.

59
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,020
Rusty, give him $1.

60
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,420
What floor was that on?

61
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,260
First business I've ever done
with a dust storm.

62
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,940
It'll cost me $1 to have this cleaned.

63
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,540
$9 change, please.

64
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,060
- What change?
- That's $10.

65
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,580
Yes, so it is.

66
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,540
Money lover.

67
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,100
A dollar's a dollar,
and every dollar is taking me further West.

68
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,500
Us, too.

69
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,060
- What are you laughing at?
- That hat.

70
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,220
It looks ridiculous
with that coat he's got on.

71
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,340
- What's the matter with that coat?
- They clash.

72
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,260
I have a coat that goes with that hat.
Have you got a moment?

73
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,060
Come over here, son.

74
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,220
Now, this is a coat that's really a coat.

75
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,980
There's the finest deerskin jacket
I've ever seen.

76
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,380
Looks like it was made-to-order.

77
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,380
Now, let's see.
That's $20 plus $1. That's $21.

78
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,980
We meet you halfway. We give you $1.

79
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,540
You must have come the short way.

80
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,420
- Come on, Rusty. Give him $1.
- That's fine.

81
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,620
- Adios, gentlemen.
- $9 change, please.

82
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,620
- Change?
- That's $10.

83
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,940
So it is.

84
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,740
- Say, it looks a lot like the other one.
- It should.

85
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,580
Here's your change.

86
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,020
It's a pleasure to do business
with a man like you.

87
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Our slogan is,
"The customer is always right."

88
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,380
Say, did you see something
flying across here?

89
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,500
- Might have been a pigeon.
- No, it wasn't a pigeon. It was green.

90
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,380
- Must have been a frog.
- It had numbers on it.

91
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,020
Those were the license plates.

92
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,500
I guess it's my... No, it isn't.

93
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,380
I can't seem to locate
that $20 you gave me.

94
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,260
What $20? We no give you $20.
We give you $2.

95
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,780
$1 for the hat, and $1 for the coat.

96
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,340
That's right, yes,
but you gave me two $10.

97
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,300
Sure, and you give us $18 change.
$18 from $20 is $2.

98
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,620
- And you got mixed up.
- So stupid of me.

99
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,380
There's something corrupt
going on around my pants...

100
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,020
and I just can't seem to locate it.

101
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,180
If you think we're crooked,
we give you another $1.

102
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,460
I'm sorry if I had you fellows
pegged wrong.

103
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
I must have misunderstood you.

104
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,140
$9 change, please.

105
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,620
- You wouldn't wanna give me $1?
- No.

106
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,020
How about giving me 10 singles
and I'll give you 9 singles change?

107
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,940
- But we got no singles.
- I just gave him $18.

108
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,460
He sends money home to his mother.

109
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,140
- You want $1?
- Not if it's gonna cost me $9.

110
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,100
- You should watch your money.
- I'll watch my money. You watch him.

111
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,180
$9 change, please.

112
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,620
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

113
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,740
You count good, but where's the change?

114
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,180
- Didn't I just give it to you?
- No.

115
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,340
Rusty, did he give it to you?

116
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,340
You must have given it to yourself.

117
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,380
Somebody's giving it to me.

118
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,940
You know, all I want to do is go West...

119
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,460
not go broke. Good day, gentlemen.

120
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,860
- You forgot something.
- Now what's the matter?

121
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,740
- The sales tax.
- What sales tax?

122
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,380
For the stuff you just sold us.
We gotta give you another $1.

123
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,620
No, thanks. I couldn't afford it.

124
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,620
But it's against the law not to charge tax.

125
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,020
- You wanna go to jail?
- I won't say anything if you don't.

126
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,540
I won't say anything, but he might.

127
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,660
- What does he want to keep quiet?
- Nothing.

128
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,700
All he wants to do
is to give you another $1.

129
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,220
- He doesn't want $9 change?
- No, he'll take $5 and $4.

130
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,740
Give me it.

131
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,980
He'll take $5 and $4.

132
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,620
One, two.

133
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,580
Here's $3. There's $4.

134
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,180
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

135
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,900
You know what I say,
I like to do business with you...

136
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,500
because I knew you were honest
the first time I see you.

137
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,780
The cornerstone of my success
is integrity.

138
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,100
- That's right.
- That's the only secure foundation.

139
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,500
That's what I said when I see you.

140
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,180
- When you have that, you have everything.
- Right. I know you're a good man.

141
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,700
I gotta do business.
I don't care about anything else.

142
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,420
You can conduct it another way,
but it's not permanent.

143
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,140
It's not the kind of thing
you can build your success on.

144
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,780
- That has been the climax of my success.
- That's what I said.

145
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,220
It's suddenly gotten very chilly in here.

146
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,780
Well, goodbye.

147
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,780
It seems that I've strayed into
a den of thieves.

148
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,220
However, it's a wise man
that profits by his previous mistakes...

149
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,660
and from herein, gentlemen...

150
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,700
I have made
some other financial arrangements.

151
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,500
It's been nice knowing you, gentlemen.

152
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,580
I'm glad to have made your acquaintance,
and a good day to you both.

153
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,100
- Good day.
- Goodbye.

154
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,220
Come on, Rusty.

155
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,940
Gentlemen, this is Mr. Terry Turner
who has just arrived from the West.

156
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,500
- Hello.
- How do you do?

157
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,220
Young man, I want you to tell these
gentlemen what you told me this morning.

158
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,780
I understand you are thinking
of building a railroad...

159
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,820
from Cripple Creek
north around the mountain.

160
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,180
And I'd like to ask you
to go in another direction.

161
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,980
I'd say the straightest way to go...

162
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,180
would be from Cripple Creek here
straight through to the Pacific.

163
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,820
You expect our trains
to fly over the mountains?

164
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,140
No, sir.

165
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,100
I expect your trains to go through here,
Dead Man's Gulch.

166
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,460
May I ask why you're so interested
in seeing that this land is sold?

167
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,060
Yes, sir. So that I can get married.

168
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,620
I think I understand.

169
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,540
- You own the land.
- No, sir, but my grandfather did.

170
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,780
He being quite a crook, he unloaded it
on my girl's grandfather, Dan Wilson.

171
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,900
Old Dan's been sore about it ever since.

172
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,340
It started a feud
between us Turners and the Wilsons.

173
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,620
And now he won't let me
marry his granddaughter.

174
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,660
If I could just prove to him
that I'm not a crook...

175
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,060
then maybe he could see the light.
After all, he's not a bad old coot.

176
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,380
I think Beecher should leave
as soon as he can to contact...

177
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,740
Dan Wilson, sir.

178
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,060
And arrange for the purchase
of the Dead Man's Gulch.

179
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,380
I don't know what's the matter.
I dig and dig, and the hole gets no bigger.

180
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,100
- I'm moving on.
- Yeah, but how about the gold?

181
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,780
There ain't no gold here.

182
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,260
I've been working Dead Man's Gulch
off and on for 40 years.

183
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,540
I'm convinced.

184
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,900
Mr. Wilson, why don't you quit?

185
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,660
I've got a little granddaughter
who's gotta be taken care of...

186
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,380
- And I won't last forever.
- Where you going?

187
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,140
I'll get a job until I get a grubstake,
and then I'll try again somewhere.

188
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,660
How much is a grubstake?

189
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,420
I reckon about $10 would see me through.

190
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,900
- We give you the $10.
- No, I couldn't take it.

191
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,940
But we got lots of money.

192
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,140
Then I'll take it, but it's just a loan.

193
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,500
That's all right.
Come on, Rusty, give him the $10.

194
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,860
No strings attached.

195
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,660
- Here you are.
- You gotta take some security...

196
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,060
and I ain't got no security
except a deed to Dead Man's Gulch.

197
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,700
- No, we no take your land.
- I'd feel better if you took it.

198
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,460
I don't reckon it's worth $10, though.

199
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,980
A fellow named Turner sold it to me
about 40 years ago.

200
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,020
Got me for my last cent.

201
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,500
If you boys meet up with any Turner
in this territory, shoot first.

202
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,180
First we steal his gun, then we shoot.

203
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,100
And, boys, when you get to Birch City...

204
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,980
Iook in on my little granddaughter,
will you?

205
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,140
And tell her
her old granddad will be back soon.

206
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,820
We'll tell her.

207
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,140
Let's go back to work. Come on.

208
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,860
Indians? You're crazy.
There's no Indians around here.

209
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,020
You can't walk around like that.

210
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,540
What do you think of it, Mr. Turner?

211
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,540
Now, Grandpa, stop glaring at Terry.

212
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,820
The Turners aren't as bad as you think.

213
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,700
Not all of them, anyway.

214
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,620
Darling!

215
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,940
- Darling, you've been gone a million years.
- Just three weeks.

216
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,820
- You were a million miles away.
- Only 2,000. Just to New York.

217
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,420
This is wrong.
You're a Turner and I'm a Wilson.

218
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,980
You should hate me and I should hate you.

219
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,380
Say, that sounds convincing.

220
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,420
- You mean it?
- Of course.

221
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,180
This much.

222
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,220
Do you hate me?

223
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,860
Yes. This much.

224
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,020
Hate me some more.

225
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,260
Terry, you really shouldn't be here.

226
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,820
If Grandpa ever sees you around...

227
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,420
Your grandpa won't be able to see
enough of me when he gets the $50,000.

228
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,540
- Fifty thousand what?
- Dollars, from the railroad company.

229
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,940
I sold them Dead Man's Gulch.

230
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,060
You sold Dead Man's...

231
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,340
I had a hunch,
and I followed it to New York.

232
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,100
I convinced the New York and Western...

233
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,860
a road through Dead Man's Gulch
would save them a fortune.

234
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,420
If that don't square things
between our families...

235
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,300
then your grandpa is a man
who just loves to hate.

236
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,060
But I love to hate.

237
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,820
I promise to hate, honor,
and obey you the rest of my life.

238
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,060
Eve, before I take you up on that...

239
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,540
I gotta fix it with your grandpa.
Where is he?

240
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,900
- Out in the desert, I guess.
- I've got to find him.

241
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,860
But not just yet.

242
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,620
That's no good. That's for horses.

243
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,420
I know you're thirsty. I'm thirsty, too.

244
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,700
Come on, we go into the saloon.
I get you a drink.

245
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,580
Rusty, I no like the West.
All the people do is kill each other.

246
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,980
I'd like the West better
if it was in the East.

247
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,900
Let's get out of here.

248
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,660
Letter. Pony express for you.

249
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,020
Game is over, boys.

250
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,740
Now, look here, Pete...

251
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,780
a whole week has gone by
and you still ain't brought Wilson in.

252
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,860
Get some more men.
Get some fresh horses.

253
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,540
I don't care how you do it,
but you find that desert rat.

254
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,460
Take it away.

255
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,060
Thirsty? My throat is dry,
just like the desert.

256
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,060
Yours, too?

257
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,700
Another, Joe.

258
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,900
Okay. There it is, Pete.

259
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,740
Hey, you!

260
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,580
What's the matter with you?
Put that down!

261
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,820
- What's going on here?
- Couple of tinhorns from the East.

262
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,740
Told them no money, no beer.

263
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,460
Then I turn my back, and he steals a glass.

264
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,460
- Why, you...
- He no steal it, mister.

265
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,620
We don't want no trouble. I'll pay.

266
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,020
You don't look as if
you had a dime between you.

267
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,140
No, but I give you an IOU.

268
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,660
Did you hear that, boy? An I owe me.

269
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,460
Sure, we're honest. We always pay.

270
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,300
Here, I owe you 10 cents. Joseph Panello.

271
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,740
That's rich and rare.
A business transaction, Joe.

272
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,740
Put it in the cash register
before somebody steals it.

273
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,940
Come on, you financiers, beat it.

274
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,940
Get out of here.

275
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,980
- You know where Dan Wilson's house is?
- Dan Wilson? Sure.

276
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,820
You just go half a mile up the road.
You can't miss it.

277
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,100
Say, you can do me a favor.
I got a telegram for Dan Wilson.

278
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,060
You can deliver it and save me the trip.

279
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,020
Sure, we'll deliver the telegram.
Maybe it's good news.

280
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,140
- There you are, and thanks very much.
- That's all right.

281
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,580
Dan Wilson. That means we don't open it.
You promise?

282
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,380
Right.

283
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,060
All right. We open it but we don't read it.

284
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,700
I no think I can trust you.
And I know you can't trust me.

285
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,980
So I tell you what we do.
I'll read it, but we don't listen.

286
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,220
Come on, put the fingers up.

287
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,260
Rusty, I cheated.

288
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,980
I listened.

289
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,460
You, too.

290
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,900
Mr. Beecher, we're here to meet you!

291
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,060
We're supposed to meet you!

292
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,500
Are you looking for John Beecher?

293
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,140
Sure, we've come to see him about
selling Dead Man's Gulch to the Railroad.

294
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,540
That's fine.

295
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm John Beecher.

296
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,180
We don't recognize you, do we, Rusty?

297
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,380
Naturally you don't recognize me.
We've never met.

298
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,020
Then how do I know it's you?

299
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
If I don't know
what Mr. Beecher looks like...

300
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,300
the only way I can tell it's him
is if he wears a white carnation.

301
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,860
Well, the very idea!

302
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,660
I don't know anything about...

303
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,740
Now, look here, you two...

304
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,220
Old Mr. Beecher, we look all over for you.

305
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,260
- We're so glad to see you.
- Yes, I'm glad that's settled.

306
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,980
Now, which one of you gentlemen
is Mr. Wilson?

307
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
None of us.

308
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,660
We got a name: Panello.
But we own the land.

309
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,940
- You have the deed with you?
- Sure.

310
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,620
I mean, no.

311
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,940
He's trying to tell us
it's home in Birch City.

312
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,580
We'd better go there immediately.
Come along, gentlemen.

313
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,820
Just follow me, please.

314
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,140
Why you tell him where the deed is?
All the time you talk too much.

315
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,260
From now on, you keep your hands shut.

316
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,340
If that's only a mirage coming,
I'm gonna look like you in a few days.

317
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,820
Come on, stranger, hop in.

318
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,820
- Where did I see your face before?
- Right where it is now.

319
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,100
Blondie, how would you like to buy
a diamond necklace...

320
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,460
that formerly belonged
to the Czarina of Russia?

321
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,780
- How did you get it?
- I used to room with Rasputin.

322
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,220
- $1.
- I'll buy it. Lend me $10.

323
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,260
- Sure, Mr. Panello.
- $10.

324
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,420
$9 change, please.

325
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,620
Let's forget about it.

326
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,580
Madam, why is that baby
constantly crying?

327
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,260
He can't stand the jerks in the coach.

328
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,220
Now wait a minute, boys.
It was nothing personal.

329
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,020
She didn't mean anything by it.

330
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,380
$10 for every ditch you hit.

331
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,260
- I'm so sorry.
- I must get myself straightened around.

332
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,460
- That's it, around.
- Let my bustle go!

333
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,540
Attaboy.

334
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,900
- I can fix this bustle myself!
- All right, he's just helping you.

335
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,260
Madam, it's none of my business,
but are you wearing a revolving door?

336
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,660
If you are,
I'd like to go around with you sometime.

337
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,180
Mr. Panello, instead of bargaining with you
for the rights of the land...

338
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,260
I intend to make you a liberal offer,
which I feel you'll instantly accept.

339
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,100
How much you gonna pay us for this land?

340
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,660
$500.

341
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,780
$500! We're gonna be rich!

342
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,020
Now, all I need is both your signatures.

343
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,020
On the bottom.

344
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
There you are. Thank you.

345
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,620
I'll give you $1,000.

346
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,860
- How dare you, you meddlesome fool!
- I heard that!

347
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,820
If you weren't so small,
I'd flog the daylights out of you.

348
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,060
- But I'm bigger than you.
- That's another reason.

349
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,860
You'll pay us double for this land
than the Railroad?

350
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,420
Yes, and it's a lucky thing for you
I got here in time.

351
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Mr. Panello,
you don't know who he represents.

352
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,340
At least you know my offer is bona fide.

353
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,940
That's right.
How do we know your offer is bona fide?

354
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,420
- Are your hands clean?
- Sure.

355
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,580
Then here's my card.

356
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,620
"Bona Fide Oil Company.
S. Quentin Quale, Pres."

357
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,300
Look. His whole company is bona fide.

358
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,060
In all my long business experience,
I've dealt with every important oil firm...

359
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,460
- And I've never heard of your company.
- You haven't?

360
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,180
Evidently you don't read
the bankruptcy notices.

361
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,900
It works out fine.
We get your land, you get $1,000...

362
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,540
and our friend here
gets bounced by the Railroad...

363
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,300
for letting this oily deal
slip through his greasy fingers.

364
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,700
If you don't mind,
would you mind taking your feet down?

365
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,820
It's a good joke.

366
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,940
Wait till the Railroad hears about this.

367
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,940
It's more than your land is worth, really...

368
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,980
but I'll stretch a point. $1,500.

369
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,940
Oh, boy. Stop it.

370
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,180
For $1,500, I write good.

371
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,060
- $2,000.
- $3,000.

372
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,140
- $4,000.
- $5,000.

373
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,300
$6,000.

374
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,820
- He says $6,000. What do you say?
- I wash my hands of this whole deal!

375
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,100
Try this soap.
We're having a special on it today.

376
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,860
It's $1 a cake, or two cakes for 25 cents.

377
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,460
Where's my bag?

378
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,780
Please. The contract.

379
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,620
Now, gentlemen, please...

380
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,620
Give me my hat!

381
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,220
- What's the idea?
- Where is my hat?

382
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,340
- Where's my hat?
- Where is my hat? There it is.

383
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,140
Here's yours.

384
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,540
Gentlemen, I have a whole railroad
on my shoulders...

385
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,940
- And I'd like to get something done!
- I want my hat!

386
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,780
You have my hat, madam. Here's your hat.

387
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,460
Have you a fountain pen?
I've got to get a contract signed.

388
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
Do you mind if I take my hat?

389
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,260
I've never been on a trip like this before.

390
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,260
Where is it anyway? Who has my bustle?

391
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,140
- Sit in your own seat.
- Give me my bustle!

392
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,260
- Mr. Beecher, no hard feelings.
- Wait, Panello.

393
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,460
I'll admit you've got me
in hot water, but...

394
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,340
Please.

395
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,340
Why don't you let me get this signed?

396
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,020
- Where's my hat?
- Here.

397
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,420
Nobody can outshoot Two-Gun Quale.

398
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,700
Boys, sweep them out of the gutter.

399
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,540
- Why, there's nobody out there.
- Well, sweep out the gutter.

400
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,980
Say, all the beautiful stems in here
are not on the wine glasses.

401
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,300
Lulubelle, it's you.
I didn't recognize you standing up.

402
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,340
- Vamoose, you goose.
- Nice piece of poetry.

403
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,140
Say, if you wanna stay healthy,
I'd keep shy of Lulubelle.

404
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,580
She's Red Baxter's girl.

405
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,860
Who's Red Baxter?
We'll settle this right now.

406
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,020
- Where's Red Baxter?
- Here.

407
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,660
- Where?
- Here!

408
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,340
You should've been home.
The pot of gold called.

409
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,780
Yes, they want their pot back.

410
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,860
- Why, you...
- Hold on, Red.

411
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,860
This is the gentleman who's selling us
the deed to the Wilson property.

412
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,380
No hard feelings, stranger.
Welcome to Crystal Palace.

413
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,260
Now then, Quale,
have you the deed with you?

414
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,500
I'll have the deed pronto,
whatever that means.

415
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,380
- That's fine. Bring it to Mr. Baxter's office.
- Yes.

416
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,540
Lulubelle, I want you to be good
to this little boy here.

417
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,620
- Come on, son.
- Bye, Daddy.

418
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,700
I'll sell Red the deed.
Then if you get your father's consent...

419
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,980
we'll get married,
if I can get my wife's consent.

420
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,940
Step aside, boys. This is love on the run.

421
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,300
- Yes. Let's have the deed.
- We ain't got it exactly.

422
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,300
I made them agree to $10,000,
and now you stall. Get the deed.

423
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,140
We'll get it if you lend us 10 cents.

424
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,500
10 cents?
I'm promoting this deal, not financing it.

425
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,340
Here.

426
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,860
How they handle all this and ride a horse
at the same time is beyond me.

427
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,660
She's mad about me,
as what woman isn't?

428
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,100
I know, you're going to ask
what is my secret.

429
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,420
You rotter. You scrounge.

430
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,140
The secret is never let her know you care.

431
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,820
Never pursue her. Let her pursue you.

432
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,700
Fan the flame of desire
with the bellows of indifference.

433
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,820
Didn't we meet at Monte Carlo
the night you blew your brains out?

434
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,380
How we laughed!

435
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,820
Foolish, foolish child.

436
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,380
It's madness,
this thing that's happened to us.

437
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,460
It can never be.
We come from different stock.

438
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,860
Suppose I brought you
to my country place...

439
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,580
at Drooling-on-the-Lapel?

440
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,340
What would my people say?

441
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,100
They'd phrase it more delicately.

442
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,140
Go! Let's break clean.

443
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:20,324
Rusty, now's your chance.
Nobody's Iooking. Get back the IOUs.

444
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,980
Here's the deed. Let's collect.
You got the bag for the money?

445
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,980
Fine. You wait here and I'll be right back.

446
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,460
It's our deed and our money.
Why should you go alone?

447
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,740
I give you my word as an embezzler
that I'll be back in two minutes.

448
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,620
Rusty, in two minutes,
Dan Wilson is gonna be rich.

449
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,900
Let's have some fun. Come on.

450
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,300
Rusty, I'm so happy
I'd like to play the piano.

451
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,820
You want I should play?

452
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,940
It's about time.
I thought you wasn't gonna ask me.

453
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,380
Mister, can I play the piano?
He said yes. All right.

454
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,020
Yeah, sure. Two minutes is all we got.

455
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,180
We can relax now. No matter what route
the Railroad decides on...

456
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,740
they'll have to come to terms
with Beecher and Baxter.

457
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,500
Baxter and Beecher.

458
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,580
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

459
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,460
Mr. Quale, everything is signed,
sealed, and delivered.

460
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,820
Yeah, but not yet paid for.

461
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,300
Let's get down to brass tacks,
or rather, greenbacks.

462
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,180
How about the $10,000?
This alligator hasn't eaten in a week.

463
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,180
- What are you talking about?
- The money this volcano owes me...

464
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,700
for making those numskulls
hand over Dead Man's Gulch.

465
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,260
That's right.
Our friend bid me up to $10,000...

466
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,740
when all they wanted was $500.

467
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,140
Competition's the life of trade.

468
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,340
Not around here, it ain't.

469
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,180
How about $9,000? $8,000?
How about $6,000?

470
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,900
How about the combination to the safe?

471
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,180
We don't want to appear
like we're not grateful.

472
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,740
We're gonna give you $500.

473
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,820
$500? I came up here intending to cheat
those two fellows out of $10,000.

474
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,700
You want me to cheat them out of $500?

475
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,260
What do you think I am? A cheat?
It's impossible.

476
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,300
I just got another idea.
We are not gonna pay you nothing.

477
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,340
That's one way of reducing your overhead.

478
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,660
- I want that deed back.
- Not a chance.

479
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,620
- Baxter, I want that deed back.
- Not a chance.

480
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,340
I'm not through with you yet.
There's a law in this state.

481
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,380
Before you call in the law,
there's something I want to show you.

482
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,580
Wait a minute! I'll fix that.

483
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,780
- See that shelf down there by the bar?
- Yes.

484
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,340
- Do you see the bottles on the shelf?
- Yes.

485
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,060
- Do you see the corks on the bottles?
- Yes.

486
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,100
- You see that man sleeping at the table?
- Yes.

487
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,060
- See his nose?
- Yes.

488
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,220
- See the fly on the end of his nose?
- Yes.

489
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,260
You've certainly got good eyesight.

490
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,700
- Here, water! Give him some water.
- Brandy.

491
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,940
Force brandy down my throat.

492
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,060
Where's the dime I lent you?

493
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,980
Look, the bag is empty.
Where's the money?

494
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,900
I gave them the deed,
but they refused to give me the $10,000.

495
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,460
I'd have hit them within an inch
of their lives, but I'd no tape measure.

496
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,420
You said you was an embezzler, but
you don't fool me. I knew you was a crook.

497
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,420
There's only one law in the West:
the law of blood and bullets.

498
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,740
It's either shoot or get shot.

499
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,100
- What are we gonna do?
- Sue 'em.

500
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,340
Come on, Rusty.
We'll show them you're not afraid.

501
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,060
Look out, Red!

502
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,340
This must be the house.

503
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,620
Listen. It's nice.

504
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,500
She must be the girl who minds the baby.

505
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,700
Don't be afraid of us, miss.
We're friends of Dan Wilson.

506
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,660
- You are?
- Sure.

507
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,900
Any resemblance between
these two characters and living persons...

508
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,780
is purely accidental.

509
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,300
Come in.

510
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,500
I didn't mean to be rude.
I was expecting someone else.

511
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,420
Won't you sit down, please?

512
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,500
I thought I knew all of Grandpa's friends
but I don't seem to recognize you.

513
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,380
Of course not. You don't know me.

514
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,540
People who know him
don't recognize him either.

515
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,500
Could we please see
Dan Wilson's little granddaughter?

516
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,700
- I'm his granddaughter.
- I'm expecting a baby.

517
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,020
You'd make a wonderful mother.

518
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,700
Are you sure you're not a little baby?
Because we brought you a present.

519
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,020
- It's lovely.
- Yeah, that's the best one we could steal.

520
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,780
Now Dan Wilson's got two little babies.

521
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,220
Do you know where my grandpa is?
I'm awfully worried about him.

522
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,020
He has a deed to some property
the Railroad wants to buy...

523
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,780
- And we can't find him.
- Your grandpop ain't got the deed.

524
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,220
- You know who's got the deed?
- No.

525
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,780
Your grandpop.

526
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,860
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

527
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,980
- Is something wrong with Grandpa?
- No, everything is fine.

528
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,460
That's good.

529
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,740
He's been so wonderful to me.

530
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,260
Gone without things
just so I could have them.

531
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,940
Now he'll be able to have everything
he's always wanted and couldn't afford.

532
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,500
He'll be able to go places
he's read about and couldn't see.

533
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,900
It'll be wonderful for us, too.
Terry and me, I mean.

534
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,900
We can get married.

535
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,740
Just one little thing happens
and the whole world is different.

536
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,660
- There is something wrong, isn't there?
- The only thing wrong...

537
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,260
is that your grandfather's deed
is in Red Baxter's safe.

538
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,820
Red Baxter? My grandfather
wouldn't have anything to do with him.

539
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,220
- He knows he's a crook.
- We didn't.

540
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,460
You see, Miss Wilson, your grandfather
gave the deed to these boys.

541
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,980
Security for a loan.
And Red Baxter stole it from them.

542
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,620
Don't worry. You couldn't help it.

543
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,020
But if you see Grandpa,
don't mention it to him.

544
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,540
What almost happened, I mean.

545
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,980
You see, he's old.

546
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,620
What about this Terry?

547
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,660
We're young. Another miracle will happen.

548
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,340
You're right. Come on, miracle men.

549
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,940
We also double at weddings as best men.

550
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,500
Will you keep quiet?

551
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,100
We've gotta work fast.
Baxter might come back.

552
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,180
Don't be afraid. If any trouble starts,
we'll telephone for help.

553
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,340
Telephone? This is 1870.

554
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,340
Don Ameche hasn't invented
the telephone yet.

555
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,140
The safe's in there. Come on.

556
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,940
- There she is, gentlemen. Proceed.
- That's a boy.

557
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,980
- Come on, Mary Lou. We can relax in here.
- Okay.

558
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,340
Those dopes
are trying to crack open the safe.

559
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,660
Send for Baxter and the boys.

560
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,540
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Find them!

561
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,820
How will I find them?
I don't know where they are.

562
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,300
Wait a minute.

563
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,500
- Did you say something?
- I no say nothing.

564
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,180
If it's me, my voice is certainly changing.

565
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,500
Carry on.

566
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,820
You dope!

567
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,940
That will teach you. Never trust me again.

568
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,140
Listen, you bring back some drinks,
and I'll try to keep them here.

569
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,140
- Can you handle all three?
- No.

570
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,380
Better bring another girl.
That redhead's a demon.

571
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,260
I could swear I heard voices.

572
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,340
There's nothing to worry about.
They're in the next room.

573
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,700
They are?

574
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,900
It's you.
I wish you'd stop talking to yourself.

575
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,900
Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm busy.

576
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,500
- Why, honey child.
- I'm not that busy.

577
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,620
Let's go somewhere
where we can be alone.

578
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,060
There doesn't seem to be anyone
on this couch.

579
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,820
I got a hunch Quale ain't got
his mind on his business.

580
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,180
Who hasn't?

581
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,300
That don't look like Red Baxter.

582
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,780
I beg your pardon,
I thought you were Mr. Baxter.

583
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,380
My eyes aren't what they used to be.

584
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,660
- Who do you wish to see?
- Not "who." Whom do you wish to see?

585
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,340
At my age, corrected by an illiterate.

586
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,860
I thought you were up here
looking for the deed.

587
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,940
I was just trying to find out
what she knows.

588
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,780
She looks like she knows plenty,
but not about the deed.

589
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,540
Come on, let's go back to work.

590
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,300
- Hello, boys.
- Maybe we can work in here.

591
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,420
No, I think we better toddle along.
We'll be back later, girls.

592
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,100
- Me, alone.
- Me, too.

593
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,100
- Did you get Baxter?
- Yes, he's on his way.

594
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,220
- Did you miss me?
- Hello, lambie-pie.

595
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,980
Sure, now, you can't up and leave us.

596
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,580
Gentlemen, how would you all like
a mint julep?

597
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,500
It's been years since I've tasted
the nectar of the Old South.

598
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,980
However, if you insist.

599
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,020
I take one, too,
just so he don't drink alone.

600
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,300
We get them drunk, then they won't know
what we're here after.

601
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,460
That's right, blabbermouth,
keep it a secret.

602
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,420
You keep them busy,
and I'll help Rusty crack open the S-A-F-F.

603
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,140
You're a one-man fifth column.

604
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,260
- You wanna know something?
- Not a great deal.

605
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,660
Dixie just wouldn't be Dixie
without a mint julep.

606
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,420
And you know something else, Scarlett?

607
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,020
Dixie wouldn't be Dixie without Dixie.

608
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,180
My compliments on this julep, ladies.
It's as sweet as you are, and twice as cool.

609
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,260
- Have another one, honey child.
- I'll take one more.

610
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,860
If you insist, I'll have eight more.

611
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,460
Come on, let's sing.
Mint juleps always make me sing.

612
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,860
Let's just drink.
How about some more mint juice?

613
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,820
- No, come on, let's sing.
- Yeah, come on.

614
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,740
- Come on, girls, we'll all sing now.
- Let's sing!

615
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,660
How about another drink?

616
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,540
Don't put any ice in mine.
It takes up too much room.

617
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,780
Gentlemen, let's drink to the South,
land of milk and honey.

618
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,100
The bee who collected this honey
must have some hangover.

619
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,740
A toast to where we girls was born:
South Carolina.

620
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,900
Mississippi.

621
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,340
Louisiana.

622
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,060
I thought these girls were sisters.

623
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,220
They are,
but their mother lived in a trailer.

624
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,060
It's a funny thing. I'm not drunk,
but what's the ceiling doing on the floor?

625
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,900
Your julep, coming right up.

626
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,940
What? Before I drink it?

627
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,260
You know something?
My stomach, she feels cute.

628
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,660
A toast to where we girls was born:
South Carolina.

629
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,140
Mississippi.

630
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,220
Louisiana.

631
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,140
I feel another song coming on.

632
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,900
Never mind the song.
A toast to where we girls was born:

633
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,380
South Carolina.

634
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,900
Mississippi.

635
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,860
Louisiana.

636
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,100
Hold tight, toots.
I feel another song coming on.

637
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,020
I'm gonna sing you a song
that I wrote myself...

638
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,300
with the aid of Stephen Foster.

639
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,900
A toast to where we girls was born:
South Carolina.

640
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,420
Mississippi. Louisiana.

641
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,180
Let me off at Rhode Island.

642
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,020
- Have another, honey child.
- I'll take one more.

643
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,620
If you insist, I'll have eight more.

644
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,700
Come on, let's sing.
Mint juleps always make me sing.

645
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,300
No, let's just drink.
How about some more mint juice?

646
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,540
No, come on, let's sing. Come on!

647
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,780
To my father, Col. Rufus Quale.

648
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,340
To Sunday dinner on the old plantation.

649
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,740
Chicken okra, corn pone,
shortening bread...

650
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,020
pickled watermelon, and a stomach pump.

651
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,900
Gentlemen, the South.

652
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,740
Less whiskey next time.
My glass can't take it.

653
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,340
- Come on, put them up!
- Come on, girls.

654
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,300
- Sober them up.
- Come on, you two. Sober up.

655
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,660
Pull yourself up.

656
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,460
- I must be drunk.
- Come on, up you go.

657
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,340
Scarlett, sugar, I loves you.

658
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,580
Stand up on your feet, you weasels.
Come on, stand up.

659
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,100
Red, the safe's open. The deed's gone.

660
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,980
- That redhead must've taken it.
- Find him.

661
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,500
You say you're sorry and we'll let you go.

662
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,420
Shut up. Now turn around.
No, the other way.

663
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,940
No, the both of you!
Turn around and face the window!

664
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,780
Go on, now.

665
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,700
- I don't like your faces.
- I suppose you think we like them.

666
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,420
Drop that cannon. Put your hands up.

667
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,580
Drop that gun and get your hands up.

668
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,020
Drop gun. Put your hands up.

669
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,100
All right, Pete,
drop your gun and get your hands up.

670
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,780
I wouldn't have known where to come
if Eve hadn't left me an invitation.

671
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,820
All right, folks, you can break ranks now.
Not you.

672
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,260
Maybe Mr. Beecher
would like to return the deed.

673
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,060
- It's not here. It's been stolen.
- Sure, you stole it.

674
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,100
Good. Put it in your pocket.

675
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,500
We'll deliver the deed
to the railroad officials in New York...

676
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,980
just to save you the trouble.

677
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,820
All right, boys, outside. You, too, Eve.

678
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,100
Which way did the women go?

679
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,020
You know, Beecher, it takes a smart man
to know when he's licked.

680
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,020
Maybe between you two
there's enough brains to figure that out.

681
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,020
Come on!
Open up this door and let us out of here.

682
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,820
- Red, wait a minute.
- Wait a minute, nothing!

683
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,380
If they deliver that deed to the officials,
we're sunk.

684
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,900
The only way they can get back East
is on the train that leaves tomorrow.

685
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,140
I know.

686
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,820
If they miss that train, they'll have to wait
a week for the next one.

687
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,620
- Can you sell our land to the railroad?
- In a week, I can sell them anything.

688
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,900
We'll be on that train tomorrow,
but something tells me they'll miss it.

689
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,220
Come on, open up!

690
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,060
Do you think it's safe to stay here tonight?

691
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,500
These Indians are friendly
if you treat them right.

692
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,820
Wait here.

693
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,180
I don't know why we don't sleep
at a regular motel.

694
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,700
That's the silliest-looking object
I've ever seen.

695
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,380
Eve, you take the small tepee.

696
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,740
We'll share the other. Come on.

697
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,460
She gave him the Indian sign.

698
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,740
Are you the chief that runs
from Chicago to Los Angeles in 39 hours?

699
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,420
Now wait a minute.

700
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,100
See, you got the chief mad.
Let me talk to him.

701
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,380
- Can you talk Indian?
- I was born in Indianapolis.

702
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,220
He wants to know
if you want starch in your shirts.

703
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,500
Why don't you open the window?

704
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,300
Panello, this Indian's no Indian.

705
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,340
If he's no Indian,
why is he wearing a chicken for a hat?

706
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,620
He's half-lndian and half-ostrich.

707
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,500
Stop trying to pass yourself off
as a red man.

708
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,500
Why, you can't even speak the language.

709
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,060
Let me hear you recite Hiawatha
by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

710
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,900
That's not it.

711
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,460
If it is, they've shortened it
since I went to school.

712
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,900
And you call yourself a red man.

713
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,220
And you call yourself a white man.
Let's go.

714
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,100
What did he say?

715
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,700
He said first they'll give us a fair trial,
then they'll kill us.

716
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,420
White man talk too much.
Make chief heap mad.

717
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,340
White man red man's friend.

718
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,940
White man wanna make friends
with red brother.

719
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,580
And sister, too.

720
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,700
Are you insinuating that the white man
is not the Indian's friend?

721
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,980
Who swindled you
out of Manhattan Island for $24?

722
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,060
White man.

723
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,620
Who stood your wooden statue
in front of a cigar store?

724
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,500
Who put your head on a nickel
and then took the nickel away?

725
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,940
Slot machine.

726
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,060
Members of the tribe...

727
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,180
I rest my case.

728
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,220
How would you like a little necklace
that belonged to the Czarina of Russia?

729
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,260
No like. Me want Cadillac sedan.

730
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,380
She's been off the reservation.

731
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,940
Wait a minute.
I don't want a scalp treatment.

732
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,860
Look, just to prove we're your friends,
we give you this totem pole.

733
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,700
It's stimulating when two giant intellects
get together.

734
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,060
- Who's that?
- Him medicine man.

735
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,260
That's a medicine man?

736
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,900
Can you imagine taking
a teaspoonful of him every three hours?

737
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,860
Chief like paleface who no talk.

738
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,860
You paleface friend. Chief like you, too.

739
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,260
Red man, you're a white man.

740
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,260
Come on.

741
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,220
You get a canoe later, and I'll paddle you.

742
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,540
Let's go.

743
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,700
I tell you, there's nothing to worry about.

744
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,460
They ain't gonna get on that train,
not while my boys are on the job.

745
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,060
- You haven't seen them?
- No.

746
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,220
- Well?
- It's no use.

747
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,700
Baxter's men are everywhere.

748
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,060
I'll get on the train
if I have to shoot my way on.

749
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,380
They'll outshoot you 10-to-1.

750
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:46,180
If they reach New York first and sell
their land, the deed'll be worthless.

751
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,820
We could ride ahead
and get on at the next station.

752
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,060
That's right. We'll cut through the pass.
Come on.

753
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,060
I got an idea
we better get on that train, too.

754
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,420
- Get off of that train. You're fired.
- What is this?

755
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,460
You're both fired.
You got no driver's license.

756
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,500
- I'll get this guy!
- I'll take care of you.

757
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,460
Run him through!

758
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,620
Touch!

759
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,100
I hate train rides. Don't you, Red?

760
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,740
Not this one, baby.

761
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,780
There's $250,000 at the end of the line.

762
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,780
"Pressure valve. Piston rods.

763
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:45,220
"How to cool off a hotbox."

764
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,860
Maybe that book is no good.

765
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,300
Of course it's good.
It's an engineer's manual.

766
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,820
But suppose the engineer's name
ain't Manuel?

767
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,260
Then he's gotta change his name.
He can't make a fool out of this book.

768
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,780
Here we are: "How to start an engine."

769
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,820
Slowly pull the throttle.

770
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,260
They need better engineers on this road.

771
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:11,540
When they pay for our land,
they won't have money left for engineers.

772
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,500
Attaboy, Rusty!

773
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,700
Rusty steers good.
The train is still on the track.

774
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,340
We must be coming to the station.

775
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,780
Yeah, I just remembered.
We gotta stop the train for the kids.

776
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,140
How're you gonna stop it?

777
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,580
It doesn't say in here.
Maybe it's in the next issue.

778
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,820
Wait a minute, I'll find out.

779
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,780
Hey, brother, how do you stop this thing?

780
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,340
The brake! Get me out of this!

781
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:47,420
You know,
this is the best gag in the picture.

782
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,020
The brake!
He said something about the brake.

783
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,380
The brake!

784
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,980
Attaboy, Rusty. You break the brake.

785
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,420
Come on, honey. We made it.

786
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,460
How do we stop?

787
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,220
Try dragging your feet.

788
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,740
Come on. We stop the train. Follow us.

789
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,140
No, let's borrow this.

790
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,100
They're following us.

791
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,020
I don't understand.
We're supposed to stop.

792
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,260
Tell the engineer full speed ahead.
No stops.

793
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,740
I'll tell him myself. Come on, Beecher.

794
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,740
- Come on, Beecher!
- Right with you, Red.

795
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,260
They've tied up the engineer and fireman.

796
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,020
Come on, hurry up!

797
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:05,420
There's something about you
that brings out the animal in me.

798
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:12,660
I know how to stop the train.
We pull the cord.

799
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,340
She's at top speed
and now they wanna stop!

800
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,580
- Don't stop!
- We won't stop!

801
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,180
It's no stop.

802
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,580
That's what you get for back-seat driving.

803
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,980
- Company's coming.
- Wait a minute!

804
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,500
We've finally caught up with you.

805
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,580
Stay where you are, Beecher.
We'll be out of this tunnel in a minute.

806
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:47,300
I'm not going to waste
any more time on you.

807
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,780
- Catch them, Red.
- Come on.

808
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,580
Where'd you get his gun? In the tunnel?
That's good.

809
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,220
- Where'd they go?
- Up the ladder, I guess.

810
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,780
We make the engineer stop the train.

811
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,060
They're up forward. Come on.

812
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,900
We'll uncouple the cars
and leave them behind.

813
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,780
That ought to get rid of them.

814
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,860
We'll uncouple the cars
and leave them behind.

815
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,620
That's a good idea.

816
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,860
That's fine.

817
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,660
We're on the wrong car!

818
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,700
Hang on, Rusty.
Don't let the train get away!

819
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,420
- Here they come!
- And here we go.

820
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,700
Lulubelle, you have beautiful eyes.

821
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,900
I hope you kids have a deck of cards.

822
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,180
The only way to stop the engine
is to put water on the fire.

823
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,420
Hold on, Eve. Giddap!

824
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,260
Just a minute, Red.

825
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,540
What happened?

826
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,460
What's the matter?

827
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,180
- First we throw the wood off.
- Splendid.

828
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,060
Get away from that wood!

829
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,820
Leave that wood alone!

830
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,940
- Get away from there!
- Drop that wood!

831
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,740
- There they are.
- I'll take care of them.

832
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,940
- Where are you?
- I can't see.

833
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,460
Hold on, there.

834
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,260
- There he is.
- Come and get me, boys.

835
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,500
- Get him, Red.
- I'll get you. I'll skin you alive!

836
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,580
Carsick.

837
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,820
Seasick.

838
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,340
If you gentlemen want anything, just ring.

839
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,380
Let's get this fire out. That'll stop it.

840
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,100
I wish Rusty would hurry up
with the water.

841
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,500
- This is good.
- Now she'll stop.

842
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,340
Dante's inferno.

843
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:46,860
- Terry, they're stopping!
- Come on, boy! Giddap!

844
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:50,340
We stopped the train.
See, I tell you we stop the train.

845
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,340
I knew you would stop the train.

846
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,860
I'm just as surprised as you are.

847
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,900
If that's water,
I'm glad I don't touch the stuff.

848
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:20,260
We gotta stop it. How do you stop it?

849
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:23,100
I don't know.
I've never been in an engine before.

850
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,140
Open the door.

851
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:38,140
How many times
do I have to let you boys out?

852
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:45,900
- This train is out of fuel.
- This rig will get us there.

853
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:48,540
Stop it! Stop that horse!

854
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,700
There they go.

855
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:58,220
There goes our last chance
to help those kids.

856
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,500
We've gotta get after them.

857
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,940
But we can't start the train.
There's no more wood.

858
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,500
There's plenty of wood.

859
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,220
What are you worrying about?

860
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,220
They can't follow us without any fuel.
There's no wood left on the train.

861
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:14,380
- What do you mean there's no wood?
- Look around.

862
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,820
- We'll keep the train going.
- Look at those boxes, barrels, and trunks.

863
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,900
Red, the deal's as good as closed.

864
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,660
Then what are we rushing for?

865
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:33,940
Come on!

866
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:39,780
Dump your baggage. Attaboy!
Send it all here.

867
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,380
Come on, quick.
You're slowing up, up there.

868
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,620
You got any trunks up there?

869
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,020
You better throw some butter in, too.

870
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,020
I'm throwing anything you hand me.
I can handle all you got.

871
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,100
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, pop goes the diesel.

872
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,580
Where are you, Quale?

873
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,300
Send for a Saint Bernard dog.
I'm snowbound.

874
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,940
I guess that will stop them.

875
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:28,180
I think we hit a cow.

876
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:32,620
We're off the track.
We're plowing up a farm!

877
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,980
Rusty, it's just like the merry-go-round.

878
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:52,820
I bet you can't get the brass ring
out of the bull's nose.

879
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,980
Come on down.
There's a lovely fire in the living room.

880
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,180
Hurray! We're back on the tracks!

881
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,940
- We need more wood.
- Timber!

882
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,180
Come on.

883
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,980
Too bad that nice new train
is all smashed up, Beecher.

884
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:03,220
- Yeah, I wonder how it happened.
- I wonder.

885
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,540
- Here they come.
- Giddap, there!

886
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,620
I don't see them ahead.

887
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,300
- We need more wood.
- Timber!

888
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,700
Keep to your seat. What's the matter
with you? Come on, boy.

889
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:52,860
Timber!

890
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,300
What happened?

891
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,900
They're catching up!

892
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:47,500
We'll never make it! Come on.

893
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,220
Swim for it.

894
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,380
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

895
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,860
the President
of the New York and Western Railroad...

896
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,540
will cut the tape, drive the spike...

897
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:27,580
and bank the eight ball
in the corner pocket.

898
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,500
Take it away, friends!

899
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,620
We owe you boys a lot.

900
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:39,060
It shall be your honor
to drive the golden spike.

901
