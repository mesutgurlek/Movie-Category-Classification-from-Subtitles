1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:01,697
<i>So here's what you missed on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:01,783 --> 00:00:02,750
<i>The New Directions! are headed to Nationals</i>

3
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:04,051
<i>in beautiful Los Angeles,</i>

4
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:05,419
<i>and Sue gave Mr. Shue an ultimatum that,</i>

5
00:00:05,453 --> 00:00:07,054
<i>if they don't win, the club is finished.</i>

6
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:08,642
Michael William Schuster!

7
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,246
<i>But he says he knows a
championship team when he sees one.</i>

8
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:10,715
You guys are ready.

9
00:00:10,716 --> 00:00:11,652
<i>Although last time I counted,</i>

10
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:12,623
<i>they don't even have enough members.</i>

11
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:14,168
<i>They'd better scare up
three band members stat.</i>

12
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,570
<i>Finn lead the Glee Club
to victory last year,</i>

13
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:16,571
<i>but now they don't have a leader</i>

14
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:17,539
<i>and they also don't have Rachel.</i>

15
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:20,038
<i>Or Kurt. Or Santana.
Or Britney. Or Mercedes.</i>

16
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:21,705
<i>Or Rory, the Irish kid. Where'd he go?</i>

17
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:22,952
<i>And they're also up against
a performing arts school</i>

18
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:24,220
<i>where they don't even take classes</i>

19
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:26,745
<i>and they're all, like,
acrobats and contortionists.</i>

20
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,573
<i>And that's what you missed on Glee.</i>

21
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:31,703
(school bell ringing)

22
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:33,237
(humming)

23
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:36,096
Hey, you wanted to see me?

24
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:37,977
Yeah. Have a seat.

25
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,779
(clears throat)

26
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:43,749
Um, I just want to let
you know that even though

27
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:45,451
I've kind of, like, checked out of school

28
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:46,685
since I'm not going to college,

29
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,320
I'm totally committed
to Glee Club, you know.

30
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:50,289
I've had Artie and Blaine
drilling me, like, nonstop

31
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:52,124
on the rights and lefts
of the choreography,

32
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:54,627
and I've recruited three hot
Cheerios! to get us to 12...

33
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:57,696
You don't have to prove
yourself to me, Sam.

34
00:00:57,731 --> 00:01:00,366
Finn transformed this
club when he joined up.

35
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,001
He wasn't just a male lead,

36
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:03,836
he was the captain of the football team.

37
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,538
He was the coolest kid in school.

38
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:07,206
I mean, a real dude, you know?

39
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,209
He was our secret weapon
at those competitions.

40
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:12,378
Other schools might have
had their version of a Rachel

41
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:14,547
or a Kurt, but no one had a Finn.

42
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:16,549
Yeah, he... he made it seem pretty cool.

43
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,883
When he recruited you,

44
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:19,985
he wasn't just looking
for another voice in here.

45
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,687
He was looking for someone

46
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:23,889
to take his place after he graduated.

47
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:27,860
Someone to help lead all
of these wonderful misfits.

48
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:30,029
I'm not Finn, Mr. Shue.

49
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,831
Finn was, like, a real leader, you know?

50
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,934
And so are you.

51
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:38,237
And I'm gonna need you to be
that guy when we get to L.A.

52
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:40,172
The kids want you to be that guy.

53
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:41,215
They're all waiting for you to see yourself

54
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:43,375
the way they see you.

55
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,878
The new kids love you,
and so do the older ones.

56
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:49,348
I'm sure that everything is
gonna be fine once we get there.

57
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:52,117
But if the time comes,

58
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:53,719
and you need to step up,

59
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:57,056
I'm gonna be counting
on you to get it done.

60
00:01:58,658 --> 00:01:59,725
They're here.

61
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,894
Hey, guys.

62
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:03,195
Good morning.

63
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:06,632
How's it going, man?

64
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,367
We just wanted to come in and say

65
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:11,904
that, uh, Finn really cared about you guys.

66
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:13,272
More than you know.

67
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:15,674
Finn always said that winning nationals

68
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,544
was the greatest
accomplishment of his life.

69
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:22,314
But I honestly believe
that coaching you guys

70
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,283
to winning would have
meant even more to him.

71
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,418
BURT: Now, now we're not saying

72
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:28,521
go out there and win it for Finn.

73
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:30,256
That wasn't his style.

74
00:02:31,157 --> 00:02:35,461
Um, what Finn would have said was

75
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:39,598
this is the time of your lives right now.

76
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:42,735
You're never gonna forget it,

77
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:45,504
and in a moment, it's all gonna be over.

78
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,806
So no sad faces.

79
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,742
No regrets.

80
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:51,877
Just go out there and have a blast,

81
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:55,114
and, you know, it'll be okay
if you won the damn thing.

82
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:56,482
(laughter)

83
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:58,417
And the best part about
it is that Burt and Carole

84
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:00,452
have agreed to come with us as chaperones.

85
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:03,689
(cheering)

86
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:06,859
But I think before we go,
we need a little mood music

87
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:07,927
to send us off.

88
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,028
Brad?

Even better! It's Mercedes Jones!

122
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,657
I was hoping you'd make it!

123
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,459
Are you crazy? I wouldn't
miss this for the world.

124
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,328
Ooh, I heard that you got a record contract

125
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:23,729
because either Usher, Kelly Clarkson

126
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:25,664
or Michael Jackson's daddy

127
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:29,101
bought your album in
a 7-Eleven parking lot.

128
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:31,637
<i>MERCEDES: I was selling my CD
Hell 2 the No in a parking lot.</i>

129
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:34,640
<i>Now, I ain't gonna lie, business was wack.</i>

130
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:37,009
<i>But then this Mexican lady bought one.</i>

131
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:38,777
<i>I think she felt sorry for me.</i>

132
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:41,914
<i>Turns out, that Mexican angel
on earth was the housekeeper</i>

133
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:42,915
<i>to Kanye West.</i>

134
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,550
<i>She gave it to Kanye,</i>

135
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,052
<i>who gave it to Kim, and she
gave it to Ryan Seacrest,</i>

136
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:50,623
<i>who gave it to Sony
Records... the Sony Records.</i>

137
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:52,191
<i>Next thing I know, I'm sipping Perrier</i>

138
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:53,452
<i>with a bunch of rich dudes.</i>

139
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,885
All right, I like this plan,

140
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,854
and I love that you guys like my songs.

141
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:59,156
So, yes, I'll write for
the artists on your label.

142
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:01,358
But there is a catch, so listen up.

143
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,961
In exchange for six songs,
I want my own album deal.

144
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:07,098
And I'm talking all the perks,
all the P&A that you can muster

145
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,999
and two music videos that you pay for.

146
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,401
And if it sells,

147
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:13,237
I don't have to do a lame
follow-up Christmas album.

148
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:15,072
Hold up.

149
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,173
Is that dog alive?

150
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,042
Oh, it's a faux-huahua.

151
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,577
A fake Chihuahua.

152
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:20,578
(laughs)

153
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,146
Mr. Shue, Mercedes is here!

154
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:23,926
- Oh, hey, Mercedes.
- Hi!

155
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,128
I'd like to speak to a manager, please.

156
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:27,463
What seems to be the problem here?

157
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:28,998
WOMAN: Well, one hour ago,

158
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:32,434
I got a call from Detective Sue Sylvester

159
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,337
with the LAPD saying that
a 50-year-old Ohio man

160
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:39,675
with a perm had abducted 12
emotionally disturbed teenagers,

161
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,944
and if he tried to make a reservation,

162
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:43,479
I was to contact the FBI.

163
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:46,982
Oh, my God, that's them.

164
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:49,151
Who?

165
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:51,287
Do you seriously have no idea who that is?

166
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:53,189
Do none of you read the show choir blogs?

167
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:54,323
No, Blaine, we don't.

168
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:56,659
None of us read the show
choir blogs. Just you.

169
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,127
That's Throat Explosion.

170
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:01,297
And that's their leader, Jean-Baptiste.

171
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:05,067
Jean-Baptiste was born in
Quebec to acrobatic parents.

172
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:07,736
He trained with Cirque du Soleil
before emigrating to Ft. Wayne

173
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:09,338
where he used his
French-Canadian circus stylings

174
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:11,307
to turn the entire show
choir world upside down.

175
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:13,242
Bonjour !

176
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:15,211
You must be the New Directions.

177
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:18,180
And you... must be Blaine.

178
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:21,283
How did you know my name?

179
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:23,018
Show choir blogs.

180
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:24,720
I'm, you know, I'm Sam Evans,

181
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:26,522
and I'm the leader of the New Directions.

182
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:29,225
And, you know, I know you guys
are all really good and stuff,

183
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:31,527
but that's just gonna get
us out of our comfort zones

184
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:32,761
and send us over the top.

185
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:35,397
Well, it was really great to meet you, Sam.

186
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:36,866
Best of luck, New Directions.

187
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,869
We really can't wait to see your set.

188
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:42,304
And crush you like a bug.

189
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,573
Bye!

190
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:46,976
Excuse me.

191
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,577
What is with the turtlenecks?

192
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:53,716
That was tense.

193
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,053
Oh, I wouldn't miss this
show choir high school drama.

194
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:00,189
Come on, tell me all about it. Let's go.

195
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:02,324
Like a bug. That was good.
He was right here in my face.

196
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,426
Why didn't I think of that?

197
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,527
He smells like a winner.

198
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:14,136
MAN (on TV): Another golden day
of sunshine here in Los Angeles.

199
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:17,339
Hey, Marley, it's Ryder.
Can I come in for a minute?

200
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,545
- Hi.
- Hi.

201
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,547
Can I talk to you?

202
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:26,382
- You can come in.
- Okay.

203
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:32,555
Look, you and me are
probably never gonna happen.

204
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,624
And... like, I'm slowly accepting that.

205
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,394
But that doesn't mean
I don't care about you.

206
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:40,029
Or that I don't occasionally look

207
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:41,931
at your Facebook page to check your status.

208
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:43,766
Single, and it's going to stay that way.

209
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,601
Talking about where you
put what your job is.

210
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:47,403
It used to say, "Singer/Songwriter,"

211
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:49,071
now it just says "Undecided."

212
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:54,777
I entered my songs into this contest.

213
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,479
And you lost?

214
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:59,882
Worse. I didn't hear back at all.

215
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,251
And I took that as...

216
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:03,753
I don't know... a wake-up call.

217
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,788
Oh, come on. That's only one contest.

218
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:09,592
Actually, I've entered a
bunch of contests, Ryder.

219
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:12,828
Anyway, what's so wrong
with joining Accounting Club

220
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:14,096
when we get back?

221
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:16,031
(chuckles) Uh...

222
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,399
I'll tell you one thing.

223
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,702
I think, uh, Accounting Club
interferes with Glee Club.

224
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,506
Marley, are you planning
on quitting Glee Club?

225
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:29,078
I didn't want to let anyone down.

226
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:33,816
And since this is going to be my swan song,

227
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,651
I just want it to be fun.

228
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,820
So, please, don't tell anyone.

229
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,193
Are you sure we should be doing this?

230
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:45,554
I mean, if we get caught...

231
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:46,564
Oh, just go!

232
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:48,332
Trust me, when I was in the Warblers,

233
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:50,501
sneaking onto stage the night
before a show was tradition.

234
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,837
We had other traditions, but
I can't really speak of them.

235
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:54,171
We're not doing anything wrong.

236
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:55,706
We're just, you know, getting a feel

237
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:57,441
for the layout of the stage... our stage.

238
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:59,777
So should we sing a song or hold hands

239
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:01,212
or say a prayer or something?

240
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:02,413
Because if I'm being honest,

241
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:04,115
this ghost light's kind of freaking me out.

242
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,250
All right, everybody,
circle up. I have a surprise.

243
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:13,324
Finn Hudson made us a promise
at the beginning of the year:

244
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:16,794
that we were all going
back to nationals together.

245
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,629
Even when we lost sectionals,

246
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:21,999
which was totally not Marley's fault,

247
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,801
Finn told us that it wasn't over.

248
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:27,605
He said that we'd be right here, together.

249
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,043
Now, maybe you're
thinking, "Finn isn't here."

250
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:40,418
Well, he is.

251
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:43,020
I made sure of it.

252
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:44,588
JEAN-BAPTISTE: Well, well!

253
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,525
Les Directions Nouveau !

254
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,460
Uh, apparently, we had the same plan

255
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:51,696
for an illegal midnight rehearsal.

256
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,463
"We?" You're alone.

257
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:53,731
Am I?

258
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:56,100
Existentially, yes, Blaine.

259
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:57,301
Perhaps.

260
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:58,402
We are all alone.

261
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:00,571
But tonight, tonight,

262
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:03,040
this stage belongs to us

263
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:05,142
from midnight until dawn.

264
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:07,545
You see, I called in a
few show choir favors.

265
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,313
So, we'll just give you three minutes

266
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:11,582
to gather your feelings and leave.

267
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:12,783
Who is that?

268
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:14,452
Your spirit guide?

269
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:15,953
Dolph, enough.

270
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:17,555
Have some respect.

271
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:23,361
Look, everyone knows
you're that show choir.

272
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,997
And everyone knows it's been
a very rough year for you.

273
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:29,867
And now everyone is just waiting

274
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:33,237
and watching... you.

275
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:36,273
Tonight, you have our
condolences, New Directions.

276
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:38,442
But let's just be very, very clear.

277
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:40,678
Tomorrow, you will not have

278
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:42,913
our mercy, pity or restraint.

279
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:46,050
We are Throat Explosion.

280
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:48,085
Expect us!

281
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:52,189
Seven, eight!

282
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:54,225
(feet stomping rhythmically)

283
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,327
- How'd you learn to do that?
- Have you met my son Kurt?

284
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:07,262
I cannot believe this
is our last competition.

285
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:08,697
I am not ready for this to end.

286
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:09,831
Do not start crying again.

287
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,333
I'm not gonna cry.

288
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,535
It's just that some of
my best memories from Glee

289
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,303
- are these competitions.
- BURT: Yeah, well, you know what?

290
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,105
That's why guys love
playing sports so much.

291
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,107
It's not so much about
the winning and the losing.

292
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:20,575
It's about going to war with your buddies.

293
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,877
You know? The camaraderie.

294
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:23,512
That's right. That's why you see a bunch

295
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:25,280
of 50-year-old men humping
around a softball field

296
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:26,715
or playing flag football.

297
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:27,883
They're trying to recreate that feeling

298
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:28,950
they're never gonna get back.

299
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:29,985
Oh, my God, yes!

300
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,219
That's it. Ugh.

301
00:12:31,254 --> 00:12:32,954
It's so depressing.

302
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:34,823
I can't believe this
is our last competition.

303
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,992
My life's gonna be so empty from now on.

304
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:38,593
At least you get to have one.

305
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,865
Oh, my God. I can't believe I said that.

306
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,033
I am so sorry.

307
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,068
No. It's okay.

308
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:47,069
I'm sorry.

309
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:48,470
That was totally insensitive of me.

310
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:50,639
- Tina always does this.
- No, no, no.

311
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:52,507
It's fine, honey, really.
You didn't do anything wrong.

312
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,076
BURT: You know what,
guys? Why don't you go?

313
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,078
And, uh, you go practice or something,

314
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:58,080
and I'll have Carole finish up the sewing,

315
00:12:58,114 --> 00:13:01,350
and I'll drop the dress by your room, okay?

316
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:03,051
Relax.

317
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:04,987
No eating anything from
the minibar; it's expensive.

318
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:07,589
If you want something,
go down to the 7-Eleven.

319
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:08,924
(door closes)

320
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:14,162
You okay?

321
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:15,931
I don't think I can do this.

322
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,333
I really wanted to.

323
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:20,736
But being around all his friends just...

324
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,204
I thought it would make me feel

325
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:24,072
close to him.

326
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:26,875
And I know this is awful to say, but...

327
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,078
every time that they laugh
or smile or skip away,

328
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:33,075
I just feel like my insides
are being ripped out.

329
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,443
Well, we don't have to stay.

330
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:36,011
Schuester can handle things on his own.

331
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:37,846
Tina's right though, you know?

332
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:40,807
When those kids leave McKinley,

333
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:44,578
it'll be like the last of him leaving, too.

334
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:46,580
Yeah.

335
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:48,281
It'll really be over.

336
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:51,551
I spend the days pretending
that it's not real.

337
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:55,155
But being around all of them...

338
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:57,157
I can't pretend.

339
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:59,259
Is that a bad thing?

340
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:03,463
Whatever you need.

341
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:05,966
We can get a room at the Montage.

342
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,534
Drive down to Laguna Beach.

343
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:09,402
I know how much you loved that show

344
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:11,671
- when it was on.
- (chuckles) I did.

345
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:13,640
Or we can fly home.

346
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:14,808
Whatever you want.

347
00:14:14,842 --> 00:14:16,843
Okay.

348
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:22,548
Dude, come on. Get dressed.

349
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:24,417
We got to be down there in 15 minutes.

350
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,885
So, you're talking to me now?

351
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,956
I just don't feel like losing
nationals because of you.

352
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:35,161
You barely even waited
until the body was cold

353
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:37,229
before you moved in on Marley.

354
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:38,931
Not cool.

355
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:40,800
I screwed up; I get that.

356
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,835
But you didn't even give me
a chance to apologize to her.

357
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:45,171
Or try and work things out.

358
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:46,439
I thought we were friends.

359
00:14:46,473 --> 00:14:49,008
We were.

360
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:51,877
I mean... we are.

361
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,180
At least, we should be.

362
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:57,516
All right, don't cry.

363
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:59,719
I'm going, I'm going.

364
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:01,621
Listen, man, I'm not
supposed to say anything,

365
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:04,090
but, uh, Marley's quitting
Glee Club when we get back.

366
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:05,224
Why?

367
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:07,718
She sent her songs out
to some stupid contests

368
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,454
and never heard back, so now she thinks

369
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:12,123
it's the universe trying to
tell her to give it all up.

370
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:14,625
(sighs) That's crazy.

371
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,761
She sent me a few of her songs
though, and they're awesome.

372
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:18,763
I was thinking if we could find someone

373
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:20,998
out here in L.A., you know,
someone... someone real

374
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22,366
who could tell her they're good.

375
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,469
Sure, I got CeeLo on speed dial.

376
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:26,237
No, I know I don't know anybody famous,

377
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:29,340
but we do know someone almost famous.

378
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,685
- What's wrong?
- Finn's plaque... it's missing.

379
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:41,719
Don't panic. I'm sure it's here somewhere.

380
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:43,221
It's not in here. I put it right here.

381
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:44,589
It's gone.

382
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:45,890
It's probably just...

383
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:48,159
(Jean-Baptiste chattering)

384
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:49,160
It's obviously a really big deal to them.

385
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:50,495
Give it back!

386
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,130
Give what back? Your talent?

387
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:54,665
Because you obviously left that in Ohio.

388
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,567
All right, just give us the plaque back.

389
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:58,002
Gentlemen, let's get serious.

390
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,704
You've got zero chance of winning.

391
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:01,406
You lost your sectionals.

392
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:02,999
So you're only here on a technicality.

393
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,768
And everyone knows all your
decent singers graduated.

394
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:06,903
And a little piece of wood with a picture

395
00:16:06,937 --> 00:16:08,438
of a guy on it isn't gonna change...

396
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,173
You're a tool, man! Come on!

397
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,607
Okay, break a leg.

398
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:14,477
Sam, just... just let it go.

399
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,079
They're just trying to psych
us out; they're being idiots.

400
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:19,849
We got to get our game faces
on and win this thing, okay?

401
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,621
Okay, guys, look. The
plaque doesn't matter.

402
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:26,989
You know why?

403
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:29,459
Because I believe with all
my heart that Finn is here.

404
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:31,561
He's right here with us, right now.

405
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,863
And he's holding all our
hands, and he's telling us,

406
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:35,765
"The show must go all over the place."

407
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,266
And when we're up there onstage,

408
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:39,869
he's gonna be sitting right
next to Mr. Shue cheering us on.

409
00:16:39,903 --> 00:16:42,672
And when we win our
second nationals trophy,

410
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:44,474
he's gonna be cheering us on even louder.

411
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:45,641
All right?

412
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:46,442
So let's do this! Let's go!

413
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:49,045
Yeah! (all cheering)

414
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,146
Let's go!

415
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
(whooping, cheering)

416
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:52,115
Let's do this.

417
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:58,031
ANNOUNCER: A reminder
from the City of Angels!

418
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:00,434
The 405 Freeway is closed
for repairs this month.

419
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:01,835
Also the subways isn't working

420
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,304
and bus service has been
canceled due to snipers.

421
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,607
Also if you try to walk,
people will look at you weird.

422
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:07,608
Hi, guys.

423
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:09,977
Also watch out for terrorists.

424
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:11,879
And now let's meet our judges!

425
00:17:11,913 --> 00:17:16,049
Please welcome living legend
and Academy Award winner,

426
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:17,417
Miss Marlee Matlin!

427
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:18,886
(crowd cheering)

428
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,320
Give a warm hand

429
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,122
for entertainment icon
and Emmy Award winner,

430
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:24,024
Jackée!

431
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:25,125
(crowd cheering)

432
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:28,195
But you all can just call me Jackée.

433
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:29,997
(cheering continues)

434
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,486
A round of applause for the
inventor of the fitness craze

435
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,555
that's sweeping the nation, Prancercise,

436
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,557
Joanna Rohrback!

437
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:38,592
(crowd cheering)

438
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:52,139
And now from Oklahoma City,

439
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:54,208
The Amazonians!

00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:17,026
We had a plan that we were
gonna call you up on stage

807
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,194
and give you the trophy to keep.

808
00:36:18,228 --> 00:36:19,695
It's not right.

809
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:22,131
This is not how the
story was supposed to end.

810
00:36:22,165 --> 00:36:23,432
You're right.

811
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:26,268
Oh, it would have burned Finn
to have lost to those guys.

812
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:28,637
All we would have heard for months was

813
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:30,139
how the judges had robbed you

814
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:32,541
or how you were so much better than them.

815
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:34,310
BURT: But then he would have stood up

816
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,345
and he would have told you that even though

817
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:40,149
most of you had never been in
a show choir before this year,

818
00:36:40,183 --> 00:36:44,120
you still stood tall
against the best of the best.

819
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,077
And you know what? Even though Finn

820
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:48,680
didn't have the best
voice or the best rhythm

821
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:50,248
or the best throwing arm,

822
00:36:50,283 --> 00:36:55,086
he always brought out the best in himself

823
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:57,455
and in others, and the
great thing about him is

824
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,926
he always managed to find
a way to feel like he'd won.

825
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:04,563
I was really proud of you guys up there.

826
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,665
Hearing those songs was so healing for me.

827
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:10,335
And... I don't know... I
saw how much he meant to you.

828
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:14,506
So, win or lose, he lives in you guys.

829
00:37:16,175 --> 00:37:18,476
WILL: Okay, guys.

830
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:21,179
Let's put this trophy where it belongs.

831
00:37:21,213 --> 00:37:22,647
ARTIE: A second place showing

832
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:25,817
is superior to when Finn decided
to make out with Rachel onstage

833
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:27,352
and we ended up in 12th.

834
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:32,090
Principal Sue wants to see you, Schuester.

835
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,632
Dead man walking.

836
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:52,744
SUE: Well, Roz, I got to admit,

837
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:54,646
I didn't think you had it in you.

838
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,716
Between the toxic fumes from
your excessive beauty products

839
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,618
and all those MoonPies I see you

840
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,119
shame-eating in the bathroom stalls

841
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,520
when you don't think anyone's looking,

842
00:38:02,555 --> 00:38:04,556
I didn't think there was room

843
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,891
for the kind of fire and creativity it took

844
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:08,560
to uphold the Cheerios! honor

845
00:38:08,594 --> 00:38:11,062
and bring home another
national championship.

846
00:38:11,097 --> 00:38:13,665
I'm sure it gives you
great disappointment to know

847
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:17,936
you weren't the only reason the
Cheerios! won all of those years.

848
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,604
Come back when you've won 16 more

849
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,539
and had a child with a celebrity crooner.

850
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:23,608
Then you can talk trash, Roz.

851
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:26,311
Until then, as principal...

852
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,812
Are they almost done?

853
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,949
She'll get to you when
she gets to you, loser.

854
00:38:30,983 --> 00:38:32,617
I... second place is not losing.

855
00:38:32,652 --> 00:38:34,419
It's like winning a silver
medal in the Olympics.

856
00:38:34,453 --> 00:38:35,620
Sure, if there was

857
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:38,790
an Olympic event in being totally gay.

858
00:38:38,824 --> 00:38:39,925
ROZ: Whoa.

859
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,627
Just like my date with John Salley.

860
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:44,296
(chuckling)

861
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,430
Well, bye, all.

862
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:46,698
If you need me over the summer,

863
00:38:46,732 --> 00:38:50,035
you can reach me at my beach
cottage in Saint-Tropez.

864
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:52,103
But there ain't no phones.

865
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:53,104
(chuckles)

866
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:54,272
(humming)

867
00:38:54,307 --> 00:38:55,440
Come on in, William.

868
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:58,977
(sighs softly)

869
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:08,119
I bet you're hoping for
a last-minute reprieve

870
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:11,456
and that I'll say something
about how your plucky band

871
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,260
of pinhead minstrels overcame
so much to get where they did

872
00:39:15,294 --> 00:39:19,464
and how second place is
actually an achievement.

873
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:22,701
I... I can't say I wasn't secretly
hoping you would consider it.

874
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,202
I have considered it.

875
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,171
More than you know.

876
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:27,939
But I just can't.

877
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:30,775
In the words of ex-Principal Figgins,

878
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,111
my hands are tied.

879
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:36,281
I'm the principal now, William,

880
00:39:36,315 --> 00:39:39,084
and my job is concerned with
the health of the entire school,

881
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:41,019
not just the fiefdoms that I like.

882
00:39:41,053 --> 00:39:42,687
And I do like you, William.

883
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:44,856
That's why I'm so mean to you.

884
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,325
That being said,

885
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,195
the Cheerios! stay because they won.

886
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:52,197
So does the debate team, the football team,

887
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:53,732
the girls soccer team

888
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,200
and mock U.N.

889
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:57,102
However, diving,

890
00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:59,938
academic decathlon, actual decathlon

891
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:03,808
and, yes, the glee club need to go.

892
00:40:08,347 --> 00:40:10,295
Should I fight?

893
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:13,740
Sh... should I make a
speech about the arts or...

894
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:16,588
or how much this club
means to me personally?

895
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,589
No, no.

896
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,057
Save that for your wife.

897
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:21,393
It'd probably turn her on.

898
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:24,552
That won't make any difference here.

899
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:26,287
So this is really it.

900
00:40:28,357 --> 00:40:29,691
What's gonna happen to the choir room?

901
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:30,959
Well, it's prime real estate.

902
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,628
I'll probably turn it into two classrooms.

903
00:40:33,663 --> 00:40:36,965
And since we won't be
needing the band anymore

904
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:39,467
to play everything from obscure Broadway

905
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:41,403
to Queen at a moment's notice,

906
00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:43,004
probably sell off their equipment

907
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,773
and buy some computers.

908
00:40:46,342 --> 00:40:48,176
Butt chin up, Schuester.

909
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,778
Look where you were

910
00:40:49,812 --> 00:40:52,380
four years ago when you started this thing.

911
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:54,382
You've got a national championship trophy

912
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:56,051
from last year in that case

913
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:58,687
and a bunch of other loser
trophies standing with it.

914
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:01,489
You and your team have
done phenomenally well,

915
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:04,292
and you did it with the
world's greatest nemesis

916
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,361
playing her best game against you.

917
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:10,065
You didn't lose, William.

918
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:14,536
The game is just over.

919
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:27,582
- Oh, my God.
- SANTANA: Now what?

920
00:41:27,616 --> 00:41:29,718
Your band booked a huge gig playing a show

921
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:31,319
at the Union Square subway station?

922
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:33,421
Why do you want to know? So
you can steal his dream, too?

923
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:34,856
- Exactly.
- It's Glee Club.

924
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,091
They've been disbanded.

925
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,892
They didn't win at
nationals; they're turning

926
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,961
the choir room into a
computer lab or something.

927
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:42,030
And Sue isn't backing down this time.

928
00:41:42,798 --> 00:41:44,032
It's over.
