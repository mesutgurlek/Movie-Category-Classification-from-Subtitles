1
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,102
Let the evil eye not fall on you.

2
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:37,106
I wonder which Prince is
going to carry you away!

3
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:38,766
Go, Mother.

4
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,590
Madam
- Yes Pichumani?

5
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,286
Flowers.. fell from your hair!

6
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,592
Oh! Give it to me.
- Let me do it myself!

7
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:17,605
Ok. I should go now.

8
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:30,455
Karthik..

9
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:33,121
..start the music as
soon as Pichumani puts the..

10
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:35,461
..flowers in her hair.

11
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:36,590
Ready, sir.

12
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,793
Viji.
- I am ready, sir.

13
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:41,101
The girl runs, Pichumani
is playing the flute..

14
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,105
.. and until he calls for her..

15
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:45,107
..and check out the special tone..

16
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:46,540
..for the begging
bowl crashing down.

17
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,170
I shall rock it.
- Okay. Okay, take.

18
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,120
Let the evil eye not fall on you.

19
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:04,126
I wonder which Prince is
going to carry you away!

20
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:05,354
Go, mother.

21
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:22,276
Madam..
- Yes Pichumani?

22
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,246
Flowers.. fell from your hair!

23
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:27,306
Oh! Give it to me.
- Let me do it myself!

24
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,366
Ok.

25
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:54,103
That sitar note you hit
when that Girl got shy..

26
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:56,112
..gave me Goosebumps!
- Yes..

27
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,114
..as if you played for Benhur
and Brave heart before this!

28
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:00,116
You have been doing the same
damn thing throughout the year.

29
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:01,617
He may hear you!

30
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:04,120
She is the landlord's daughter,
and he is just a beggar.

31
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:07,589
Just putting flowers in her hair,
how can love find its way?

32
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,182
He's a Hero! That's why..

33
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,591
What if you and I did the same?
- Police will find their way!

34
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:14,623
I pity these Landlord's
daughters in Tamil Cinema

35
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:15,858
Why?

36
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,600
They all seem to find only
beggars to fall in love.

37
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:20,795
Viji, are you ready?
- Okay sir, play.

38
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:44,320
How is it?

39
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:45,520
Beautiful.

40
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:46,824
So calm and peaceful

41
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:49,294
What are you doing?

42
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:53,402
Uncle! Don't move

43
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,267
Enemies are attacking us

44
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:56,498
Enemies?

45
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:00,541
Viji.. what is this?

46
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,621
We have a Terrorist
unit at our doorstep

47
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,122
They are just children.

48
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:15,317
It's so Beautiful and Calm again

49
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:21,292
Excuse me, where is Flat no 17 B?

50
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,128
That's unoccupied. Why
are you enquiring about it?

51
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,690
We are moving in there.

52
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:28,100
I handle the Security
and Maintenance here

53
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:31,402
In short, I have total control!

54
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:33,102
My name is Karthik.

55
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:34,609
This is Viji.

56
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,713
Straight this way.
Last block. First Floor.

57
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:42,742
Hello, how are you? I am fine.

58
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:52,589
Excuse me.. excuse me.

59
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:02,868
Your kerchief.

60
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,100
It fell down.

61
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:10,737
Thank you.
- What is it?

62
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,338
Thank you.

63
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,179
Its all right!

64
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:27,286
I just returned her Handkerchief.
Why is she getting so emotional?

65
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,866
Why are you laughing?

66
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,100
Was just thinking..

67
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:36,639
.. of you as Pichumani, and she
, the Landlord's Daughter!

68
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:05,791
Its very important to be
friendly with the neighbours.

69
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,097
Ring the Bell

70
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,264
V. Ananthakrishnan,
Chartered Accountant.

71
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,536
Yes.
- Hello, sir.

72
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:17,112
We are your new neighbours.
- Please come in.. come.. come.

73
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,239
I am Ananthakrishnan.

74
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,307
I am Karthik. He is Viji.

75
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,647
Sit.. sit. Please be seated.

76
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:29,784
I am the secretary of this
apartment. Janu. - I am coming.

77
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,593
My wife Janu!

78
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:41,262
Greetings. - Boiled Milk
from our house warming pooja.

79
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,770
Our new neighbours!

80
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,376
My son.
- His name is Arjun

81
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:53,410
Where are you working?

82
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:55,815
We are musicians. Keyboard Players.

83
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,517
You play in stage shows.

84
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,782
No. We are from the Film Industry.

85
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:02,120
Heard of Music director Vidyasagar!

86
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:03,318
Yes!

87
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:05,122
We play for his songs

88
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,856
Songs from the movie Chandramukhi?

89
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:08,323
Yes! We played those.

90
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:12,095
Is it so? ' Can't you
speak for a while..'

91
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:15,171
'..pampering me?'

92
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:18,230
Oh I just love that song.

93
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:20,776
You sing so beautifully.

94
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:23,703
Thank you. Even our son
Arjun is learning the keyboard.

95
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,111
He is really interested in music.

96
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,774
I can see that.

97
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,113
If you could teach him music,
when you are free..

98
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:31,518
Sure! With pleasure.

99
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,620
Seems like you cook well too
Just as beautifully as you sing.

100
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:38,752
The aroma from the kitchen is great.

101
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:40,126
If you don't mind,
could you give us some..

102
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:42,358
Definitely! I'll bring it, as
soon as the cooking is over..

103
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,764
Liking your apartment?

104
00:10:45,202 --> 00:10:46,464
Yes. Very much.

105
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,561
When is your family arriving?

106
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:49,662
They aren't coming.
I'm staying here alone.

107
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:52,367
Mother's with brother in Delhi.
Viji stays with me on and off

108
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:54,504
You aren't married?

109
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:56,739
Not yet. He just
returned her Handkerchief.

110
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:00,279
No, not yet.
- Not me either.

111
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:03,446
You go inside.

112
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,612
You go inside, Janu.

113
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,783
You mean, you are bachelors?

114
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,593
We should be, since
we are not married..

115
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:16,393
See Mr. Karthik, there has
been a mistake Some where..

116
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,400
I think so too! In his Horoscope.

117
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,095
According to our Apartment Rules..

118
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,105
..we don't allow
Bachelors to stay here!

119
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:24,299
Why?

120
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:26,103
There were 4 who stayed here..

121
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:27,768
..created too many problems.

122
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:29,778
Since then we don't
allow any bachelors.

123
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,108
We had sent all house
owners a notice on this.

124
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:33,115
But our house owner
lives in South Africa

125
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:34,309
I know

126
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,181
That is why we sent him an email!

127
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:38,517
I assure you we aren't
those kind of Bachelors.

128
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:40,715
We are the more decent ones
like Abdul Kalam and Vajpayee.

129
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,121
You won't even notice us here.

130
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:44,126
We leave home early
and come back late.

131
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,662
We've paid an advance of Rs. 2 Lacs.

132
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,198
Sorry. Isn't there
something called Rules?

133
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:51,097
Its better you look elsewhere.

134
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,101
Let's not discuss this now

135
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,399
We'll have a word with the
house owner and get back to you.

136
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:56,769
Come on, Viji.

137
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,704
Where are you going?

138
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,108
That Vessel is ours!

139
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,648
Drink lots of Milk! You
will be the next Dhoni.

140
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:11,750
It's difficult for
bachelors to find a flat.

141
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:13,118
Thinking practically there
seems to be only one solution.

142
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:15,123
And that is..
- What for that?

143
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:16,317
You getting married.

144
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:17,690
It's also your mother's dream

145
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,126
Your mother's as well.
Why don't you get married?

146
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:22,187
As a bachelor they
won't give you a Flat!

147
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:24,223
As a bachelor they
won't even give me a girl!

148
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:26,496
Shut up, Viji.
- I am serious.

149
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,505
That Secretary chap.. even
he found himself a Girl.

150
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:31,097
Tell your mom to find you a girl.

151
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:33,108
One doesn't get married like that !

152
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:35,110
It has to happen on its own.

153
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,509
What?

154
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,408
First I should see
the girl of my dreams.

155
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:42,110
When I see her I will know that..

156
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:43,652
.. I can spend the
rest of my life with her.

157
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:46,446
What?

158
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:47,581
You are making me teary eyed!

159
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:48,715
Don't pull my leg

160
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,282
How will you know she is the one?

161
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,452
That's how it is.

162
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:54,122
Like in Comic Books, there'll be
a Bulb glowing over your head..

163
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,664
.. ringing of bells ..

164
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,097
For that you should be an
Electrician or a Bell Boy!

165
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,100
Such things don't happen.

166
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:00,260
They will.

167
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,463
What to do with the
Secretary till then.

168
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,735
Before your bulb glows, he'll
pull the Fuse. - Let him be.

169
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:08,107
Talk of Romance, and
passions are ignited.

170
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,273
Hasn't such a thought
ever occurred to you?

171
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:16,115
You mean, with Bells ringing
and Bulbs glowing. Actually, I..

172
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:18,347
Better you keep quiet.

173
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,517
Whatever!

174
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,114
Let the bloody tomatoes rot!

175
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,126
How dare you avoid me!

176
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:26,321
I will kill you.

177
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:29,729
Leave me alone. You drunk rascal.

178
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,199
I'm a man. I'll do as I please.

179
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:35,102
What kind of a man are you.
Can't take care of your wife!

180
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,661
How dare you question me!

181
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,106
Remove your nose
ring and give it to me?

182
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,506
I'll kill you

183
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:42,101
Give me the money!

184
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:44,112
I know it's in your saree.

185
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,115
Don't be impertinent
to the man you belong to

186
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:48,707
Don't hit me!

187
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,292
Who are you? Holding my hand!

188
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,127
Who do you think you are?
A Supercop? Leave me.

189
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:07,101
I will do as I please with my wife.
Nobody around dare ask me.

190
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,105
I'll let you go, as you're a woman.

191
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,107
If a man had hit me..

192
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:14,405
..that would've been the end.

193
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,773
You dare hit me? Do you know who..!

194
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,111
Stop staring. Help me

195
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:24,779
Oh God! Am seeing Double.

196
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:12,196
You hired her to
beat me up, didn't you!

197
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:21,109
Instead of telling me all this..

198
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:23,111
..why don't you ask her straight..

199
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:25,477
..the Bulb glowed, Bell rang,
when can we get married?

200
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:27,482
She left in the
auto before I could..

201
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,314
What a woman she was. So Brave!

202
00:15:30,386 --> 00:15:32,854
Just like my mother.

203
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:34,451
You mean she was an old woman!

204
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,116
I meant like my mother.

205
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:39,184
My mother is just like that.

206
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:41,127
Once, this guy stole her handbag..

207
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:45,190
..you should have seen her
beat him up on the road.

208
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,102
Even I was scared to touch
that handbag after that!

209
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:49,297
I get it!

210
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:51,101
Scoring music for
too many action films..

211
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:52,300
.. has messed you up.

212
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,172
Who could she be?

213
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,576
Well she could be..

214
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,841
Never mind! Don't say anything..

215
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:00,780
Whatever!

216
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:35,115
''The twilight sky in woman's
form walks on the earth..''

217
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:39,713
''My heart stopped beating
with a glance she killed me..''

218
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:43,449
''Like electric lightning she
struck through the streets''

219
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:47,860
''My eyes are scorched..
My soul is torched..''

220
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:51,457
''Who is she.. No one knows..''

221
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:56,461
''Without giving me time to speak..

222
00:16:56,506 --> 00:17:00,465
..She disappeared
through the streets''

223
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,616
''The twilight sky in woman's
form walks on the earth..''

224
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,455
''My heart stopped beating
with a glance she killed me..''

225
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,462
''Like electric lightning she
struck through the streets''

226
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,399
''My eyes are scorched..
My soul is torched..''

227
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:52,551
''Who is she.. A
descendant of the warrior Queen?''

228
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,397
''Who is she.. A
descendant of Kannagi?''

229
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,609
''Is she a descendant
of the poet Bharati''

230
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:16,284
''Or the daughter born to
the sun and the moon..''

231
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:18,411
''An intoxicating Jasmine''

232
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:23,824
''A lotus with thorns
A scorching beauty''

233
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:29,421
''A computer
engineer A Karate expert''

234
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:31,694
''A lyrical angel..''

235
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,803
''Find out and tell me..''

236
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:46,442
''The twilight sky in woman's
form walks on the earth..''

237
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:51,544
''My heart stopped beating
with a glance she killed me..''

238
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,708
''If I see her, I'll ask her
name and attach mine behind hers''

239
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:22,680
''If I hear her, I will
compose music for her words''

240
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,457
''Adding poetry to her speech''

241
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:35,725
''Adding love to her lines''

242
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:38,460
''Mesmerizing her with words''

243
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,264
''Capturing her with humor''

244
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,397
''Unawares I will touch her heart''

245
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,374
''Adding a pinch of shyness''

246
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:48,501
''With an abundance of happiness''

247
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:52,412
''I will make her say she loves me''

248
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:56,451
''Our glances will
mingle completely..''

249
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:06,457
''The twilight sky in woman's
form walks on the earth..''

''My eyes are scorched..
My soul is torched..''

253
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:24,179
''Who is she.. No one knows..''

254
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:28,650
''Without giving me time to speak..

255
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:32,518
She disappeared through the streets''

256
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,107
I somehow don't think
Beethoven's birthday..

257
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:55,110
.. is cause enough for us to booze!

258
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:56,406
What?

259
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:59,676
He's a musician. We must
celebrate his birthday.

260
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:02,183
It's not like we drink everyday..

261
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:04,116
Last we drank was for
Michael Jackson's birthday!

262
00:21:04,187 --> 00:21:05,313
Which was last week!

263
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,117
That's his problem.

264
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,851
I am done. Bill!

265
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:13,388
Here.. finish the Chicken.

266
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:15,522
There is too much Garlic in this.

267
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:16,656
Karthik..

268
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,292
Garlic is very good for health.

269
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:23,104
If you have garlic everyday, one
in the morning and one at night..

270
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:26,107
.. you'll live for a 100 years.
My grandpa used to say that.

271
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:29,303
Not only did he say,
he lived it by example.

272
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:30,436
Really?

273
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:32,242
But the poor bugger died at 62!

274
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:33,373
How?

275
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:36,111
Well, he came out of bath,
dried his towel, sneezed. And died.

276
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:38,779
But the Garlic..?

277
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,114
There are somethings in life..

278
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:44,625
..which even Garlic can't save!

279
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,097
Can you believe this?
I am high on beer

280
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:54,101
That's because you hardly ever drink

281
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,401
So you ARE
suggesting I drink everyday?!

282
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:07,613
Hello.
- Hello.

283
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:09,116
I am Priti.

284
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:11,579
I am Karthik.

285
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:13,383
I am Inzamam-Ul-Haq.

286
00:22:14,257 --> 00:22:16,316
Can she not see me?

287
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:19,361
I heard you are a Musician
- Yes

288
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:23,127
I am also learning the Guitar

289
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,099
If you ever drop your Kerchief..

290
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:26,566
..on the guitar
he'll return it to you

291
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:28,364
Can she still not see me?

292
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:31,440
Let me not stop you. Good night.

293
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:32,735
Good night.

294
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,509
Wait.

295
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:44,580
There, she bumped
into something! Let's go

296
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,555
Why did you say you
are Inzamam-Ul-Haq?

297
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:50,659
Would she have fallen in Love
with me if I said I was Viji?

298
00:22:59,702 --> 00:23:01,294
Noticed one thing about Beer?

299
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,669
Once drunk one even burps beer.

300
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:10,841
Don't make noise

301
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:14,107
Viji.. What are you doing?

302
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:16,117
What is this? What is this,
Viji? He might come.

303
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:17,311
It's the Secretary

304
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:18,751
What are you doing?

305
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:23,115
What's this? In front of
the Secretary's house?

306
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:24,659
What if he comes..

307
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:29,295
What is this? What's happening here?

308
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,300
How dare you vomit outside my house?

309
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:36,167
It's not what you're thinking.
It's his birthday.

310
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,297
Happy Birthday, sir.

311
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:38,567
So? If it's your birthday..

312
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:40,108
..you will puke
outside everybody's house?

313
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:41,438
I never puked on my last birthday.

314
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,568
Are you joking?

315
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:43,703
Know who I am?

316
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:45,110
Secretary of this apartment.

317
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:47,376
Just a minute, sir.

318
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,508
What's he saying?

319
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:50,381
Viji.
- Let me talk to him

320
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:52,819
No need for that.
- I will talk to him.

321
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:57,785
If you want to vomit
go to the bathroom

322
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:01,123
Do we have Garlic at home?

323
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:02,858
Viji, get in.

324
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,100
Just that he had some Beer.

325
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,103
It didn't quite agree with him

326
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:10,832
Trying to fool me?

327
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:12,663
That's why we don't allow Bachelors.

328
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,710
I'll have this cleaned in 5 minutes

329
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:17,109
Think of this as a bad Vomit,
I mean, a bad Dream!

330
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,612
What?

331
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:21,275
What are you doing here again?

332
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:28,118
Actually he seems to be
puking more than he even drank!

333
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,454
This is the limit.
Yes, this is the limit.

334
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:32,426
I'll call the police.

335
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:34,122
Why Police?

336
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:36,357
Want us to vacate? We will vacate.

337
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:38,093
Just give us a little time.
- How long? Half an hour?

338
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,225
We've to find another house
- 1 hour?

339
00:24:40,303 --> 00:24:41,861
Sir.. please.
- How much time do you want?

340
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:44,400
How about 2 years?

341
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:45,770
Would that be enough?

342
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:48,173
Take 5 years. I'll call the police.

343
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:50,178
Janu, get my cell phone.

344
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:52,305
We'll vacate immediately sir.

345
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:54,110
We'll look for
another house right away.

346
00:24:54,183 --> 00:24:55,707
Go. Get going.

347
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,810
I'll call the police.
- What's that noise there?

348
00:24:58,454 --> 00:25:00,319
Nothing! Don't come out..

349
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:05,656
You are not my Friend.
Just my screwed up Fate!

350
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:14,230
Didn't I spell it out to you?

351
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:15,668
If you want to puke
go to the bathroom.

352
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,170
Why did you come out again?

353
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,638
Wasn't that the bathroom?

354
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,108
Which?
- Where I threw up?

355
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:23,270
Hey.. hey.

356
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:25,280
I was wondering..

357
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:27,282
..what the Secretary was
doing in our bathroom.

358
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:30,445
Sorry, Karthik.

359
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,384
I will wash away my own sins

360
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,450
What are you going to wash away?

361
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:36,582
I sat all night
washing away your mess

362
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:37,717
I am going to apologize
- What?

363
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:40,125
I'll say that the Bird Flu
got me, will get some sympathy

364
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:42,391
Not necessary.

365
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:44,194
Have told him, we'll
vacate this place.

366
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:46,098
That bad?
- He threatened to call the Police.

367
00:25:46,202 --> 00:25:48,227
Start looking for another house.

368
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,110
Leave this to me

369
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:58,271
The way I beg for forgiveness..

370
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:00,474
.. he is going to
come to you, and sob.

371
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:04,109
Viji is going to the bathroom,
Having a bath..

372
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:06,120
..Changing, meeting him and
finishing this once and for all.

373
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,622
Wait and Watch what
happens in half an hour!

374
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:11,385
Hey.

375
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,620
Karthik.

376
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:40,188
''Is it the moon that I
see through my window?''

377
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:44,522
''Is she the one I lost on the road?''

378
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:50,088
''What I saw, what I see..
Is it but a dream?''

379
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:56,104
''Is it my muse
right in front of me?''

380
00:26:56,172 --> 00:27:02,600
''The dove that flew away
disappeared behind the clouds''

381
00:27:02,678 --> 00:27:12,246
''But when I came home and saw It
was in my garden tittering about''

382
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:17,122
''She disappeared through the
streets but fate took me to her''

383
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:21,653
''This makes me believe
That love has blossomed truly''

384
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,596
Good Morning.

385
00:27:29,572 --> 00:27:30,800
My name is Karthik.

386
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:32,333
Newly moved in here.

387
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:35,377
You may not know me, but I know you

388
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:38,106
Remember last week, that
guy beating up his wife..

389
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,583
..you beat him up and threw him
into the garbage. It was amazing.

390
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:45,516
Wanted your autograph right away

391
00:27:45,588 --> 00:27:47,647
Before I could cross
the road, you had gone

392
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:50,123
Wanted to appreciate what you did

393
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:52,456
As I said before, I am Karthik,

394
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:53,586
May I know your name?

395
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:54,720
Jnana Prakasham.

396
00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:57,494
Jnana Prakasham?

397
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,592
Professor Jnana Prakasham.
- Oh! Karthik.

398
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,564
Where do you work?

399
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:05,469
I am a musician. I work in Films

400
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:06,599
Oh! Very good.

401
00:28:06,675 --> 00:28:09,269
I ardently listen
to Tamil Film songs.

402
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:11,279
There's this latest song..

403
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:20,446
It's a nice song.

404
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:21,615
I like that song a lot

405
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:25,319
I think it's based on Bhimplus raga.

406
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:28,386
I also enjoy Tamil Movies.

407
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:30,091
There's a new
director called Mani Ratnam.

408
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,689
Brilliant boy.

409
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,098
He'll become a great director.

410
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:34,294
Mark my words.

411
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,235
He'll go places. Mr.
Raghavan, stop there.

412
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:41,108
How can you ride
without your helmet?

413
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:42,302
I forgot it in the office.

414
00:28:42,378 --> 00:28:43,504
No. The Police will surely catch you

415
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:46,275
Even Chief Minister MGR has
said so in a recent interview.

416
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,551
Got caught with the Professor?

417
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:51,108
Who is he? Talks funny.

418
00:28:51,186 --> 00:28:53,711
He's a well read man
- Really?

419
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:55,120
Didn't notice the bald head?

420
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,557
Was a Professor in a University.
Now is slightly mentally off.

421
00:28:58,627 --> 00:29:01,118
Thinks we are all
still in the year 1984.

422
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:02,663
Why is that?

423
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:04,699
Well that is because..

424
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,098
Switch the motor off

425
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:09,170
Am going to switch the motor off.
We'll talk in detail later.

426
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:11,103
It's this way. Fengshui
is confusing everything..

427
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:13,164
Going late to school?

428
00:29:13,242 --> 00:29:14,709
If you go late,
you'll miss your lessons.

429
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:16,108
Then how will you
become a Great person?

430
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:19,113
'The one who sleeps in
school misses Knowledge'..

431
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:21,274
.. sang a great man

432
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,442
Mark my words.

433
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:23,610
Discipline is a must.

434
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,740
Such loud music.. so
early in the morning?

435
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:55,716
Nuisance!

436
00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:58,512
Hello..

437
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:04,691
Anybody home?

438
00:30:57,513 --> 00:30:59,105
Please help. Something
has happened to him.

439
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,375
What?

440
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:03,111
Don't know. Something
seems to have frightened him.

441
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:05,312
He is not responding

442
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:14,454
He did this on purpose.

443
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,724
Who? What?

444
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:18,289
Your friend. Why was he like that?

445
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,595
Like what?

446
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:22,102
I won't even look at the
face of someone I don't like

447
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,833
And he made me..

448
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:28,106
Please bring a hot cup of Tea.

449
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,576
For me.

450
00:31:29,645 --> 00:31:32,273
What are you looking at? Its For me!

451
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:35,443
Now tell me

452
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:37,280
Leave that. When are you vacating?

453
00:31:37,352 --> 00:31:38,444
Vacate? What for?

454
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,318
Didn't you promise
to vacate last night?

455
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,721
But I didn't even see you last night

456
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,191
Didn't see at all? This is too much.

457
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,591
Last night after your friend puked..

458
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:48,289
..didn't you say you would vacate?

459
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:51,298
Last night we were in Singapore

460
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,095
Singapore?
- We came in only this morning.

461
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:54,692
Can you prove it?

462
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,694
Thousands come from
Singapore everyday..

463
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,103
..are they all proving it?

464
00:31:58,173 --> 00:31:59,606
A Drunk's words cannot be trusted.

465
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:01,643
For the last time,
When are you vacating?

466
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,575
Don't you know the
rules of the apartment?

467
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:05,442
Isn't this apartment
within the Indian Boundaries?

468
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:08,108
In the Indian Penal Code
show me where it says..

469
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:09,707
..Bachelors can't
stay in Apartments.

470
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:11,116
I'll vacate immediately.

471
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:13,552
I swear on Ambedkar.

472
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:18,120
With all due respect..

473
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:20,388
..I think you have
Multiple Personality Disorder.

474
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:23,488
So calm outside, but
like a beast inside

475
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,396
Consult a doctor immediately.

476
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,465
What did you do to that man?

477
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,629
I didn't DO anything on purpose!

478
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:33,573
Tell me. No point
keeping it under covers.

479
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,110
I should have kept it covered.
But before I could..

480
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:38,373
What?

481
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:41,314
He saw me Shame Shame puppy shame!

482
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:44,514
Oh God! How did this happen?

483
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,110
Well I came out of the shower
and was bathing in some music..

484
00:32:46,188 --> 00:32:48,452
..the tempo dropped
and so did my towel.

485
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:58,665
This is the worst
punishment a man can get!

486
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,158
Get lost! Actually
why don't we vacate..

487
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:04,102
Why should we vacate?

488
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:07,438
You asked me to look
out for another house

489
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:10,103
When you went to the bathroom,
I saw from the balcony.

490
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:11,703
You also saw me?

491
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,680
No stupid. I saw my angel.

492
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:14,807
Who?

493
00:33:15,184 --> 00:33:17,345
My Rani of Jhansi.

494
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:18,545
Really?

495
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,111
She stays right here..
in our complex.

496
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,125
Even if the army comes to
evict me, I am not leaving!

497
00:33:24,193 --> 00:33:25,854
Then the Secretary?

498
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:29,596
If you want, get even
and see his Puppy shame!

499
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:31,462
Yuck! No!

500
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:44,812
Good shot. Do you like
cricket, Babu? - Yes

501
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,609
Did you see the match last week?

502
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:48,845
Which match?

503
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:52,276
India Australia match. We lost
by 46 runs. Didn't you watch?

504
00:33:52,354 --> 00:33:54,481
Yes. I watched it.

505
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:56,114
Hardly been a year since
we won the world cup..

506
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:58,523
.. and they are losing so badly.

507
00:33:58,594 --> 00:33:59,652
It's a shame.

508
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:02,288
Youngsters should
come into the team.

509
00:34:02,364 --> 00:34:03,592
Gavaskar should retire.
- Ah! You correct.

510
00:34:03,665 --> 00:34:06,099
There is this young
man from Hyderabad.

511
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:07,293
Very brilliant player.

512
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:09,269
Should play for India very soon.

513
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:10,429
Mark my words.

514
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:12,097
He'll be the captain of
Indian Cricket team one day.

515
00:34:12,174 --> 00:34:13,505
His name is..

516
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,548
Hello. Good Evening.

517
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:24,185
The name of American
president is George Bush.

518
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:26,346
British Prime
Minister's name is Tony Blair.

519
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:28,582
Latest James Bond's
name is Daniel Greig.

520
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:30,124
Why I am saying
all this is because..

521
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:32,422
..I know the names of these
people from round the world.

522
00:34:32,494 --> 00:34:33,586
But staying in the same apartment..

523
00:34:33,662 --> 00:34:35,186
..shouldn't I know your name?

524
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,097
Azharuddin. The Hyderabad player..

525
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,363
..I mentioned, his name
is Mohammad Azharuddin.

526
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,267
Very good player, Babu.

527
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:44,669
He is a good fielder too.

528
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,301
Even recently he played very
well in the Ranji Trophy Finals.

529
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,311
He is a very
promising player, you know.

530
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,108
And who is there after Kapil Dev?

531
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,670
We need another genuine fast bowler.

532
00:34:53,749 --> 00:34:55,239
Even Madanlal has grown older now.

533
00:34:55,317 --> 00:34:57,683
Every now come here.
- What happened to the old lady?

534
00:34:59,254 --> 00:35:01,381
Sister, Grandma fell down.

535
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:04,118
What happened?
- Nothing to worry, Babu.

536
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:06,660
Might have been on empty stomach.

537
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:08,662
Just take her to a doctor. Quick.

538
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:18,300
Know any doctor? Or
should I go to a Hospital?

539
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:44,092
Know Grandma's blood group?

540
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:15,621
Patient's relative?

541
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:19,693
Name of the Patient please.

542
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:24,271
Please tell me the name.

543
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:28,300
Why don't you just say it?

544
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:32,612
What's your problem?
You're not answering

545
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:12,512
I am sorry.

546
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:20,490
Must have been fasting.
Nothing to worry about.

547
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:23,588
Better to stay here tonight.

548
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:35,109
Grandma.. She is alright..
Nothing to worry

549
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:37,441
Better she stays here tonight.

550
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:52,683
Oh! It's okay.

551
00:38:02,704 --> 00:38:07,505
''From the depth of her
eyes she spoke poetry''

552
00:38:08,243 --> 00:38:13,510
''With beautiful gestures
she communicated freely''

553
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:19,248
''But through sounds she
can never speak to me''

554
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:30,460
''Silence is not a handicap''

555
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,367
''Words do not mean true perfection''

556
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:42,376
''Her face is enough for me
to speak language truly..''

557
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:05,291
Sometimes God can be so Cruel.

558
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:10,562
Let it be. Am sure your
bulb will glow elsewhere!

559
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,800
No, it's now burning brighter.

560
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:18,110
When I first saw her I
wanted a girl like her..

561
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,740
.. now I've decided..
it's her I want.

562
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:23,677
How?

563
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:27,688
Think about it. You are a musician.

564
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,316
You want to
accomplish something in music.

565
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:32,121
I can understand..

566
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:34,128
..if the woman in your life
doesn't understand music..

567
00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:36,391
.. but if she cant hear it even?

568
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:38,193
Why should she hear it.

569
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:42,670
You know that music
is felt, not heard.

570
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:48,437
That's why music needs no language.
And neither does Love.

571
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:53,112
When we score music for a film..

572
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:57,311
..don't we leave portions
of the film with no music?

573
00:39:58,587 --> 00:40:02,114
Doesn't that silence
have so much beauty.

574
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,818
I can love her silence too.

575
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:11,559
It doesn't mean that I
am giving her a life

576
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,568
I just want to share mine with her.

577
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,301
I think we will be happy

578
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:24,167
Be happy! So what are
you going to do next?

579
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:28,114
I've collected details about
her. She is a school teacher.

580
00:40:28,183 --> 00:40:29,377
What?

581
00:40:29,451 --> 00:40:31,385
A school for people like her.

582
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:34,479
She has a friend called Sheela.
Works in the same school.

583
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:36,114
We should speak to her

584
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:38,819
How will she talk?
- She can talk fine.

585
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:42,652
If we meet her we can
find out more about Archana.

586
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:47,168
You know you are lucky in Two ways!
- How?

587
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:49,100
Your wife won't talk unnecessarily..

588
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,695
..she won't bother if
you play rotten music.

589
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:54,441
Where do we meet Sheela?

590
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:20,759
Go and talk

591
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,672
She's gone

592
00:41:33,748 --> 00:41:35,443
Yes I can see that

593
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:39,651
Stop her and talk

594
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:41,245
What do I speak with her?

595
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:43,120
Don't know if you've
starting trouble..

596
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:44,317
..but I don't think her bike does!

597
00:41:44,392 --> 00:41:46,587
I'll stop her . You
think of something fast

598
00:41:46,661 --> 00:41:48,128
Hello. Hello, Madam..

599
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:50,289
Excuse me, stop.. stop. Stop.
- Yes.

600
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:52,230
License?
- Who are you?

601
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,495
CBI. - So, why do you
ask for the license?

602
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:56,366
We can ask anything.
Got a license or not?

603
00:41:56,471 --> 00:41:58,803
How do I believe you're
from the CBI? - Good question.

604
00:41:59,374 --> 00:42:02,104
Let me walk away. Call
out CBI, I'll surely turn.

605
00:42:02,177 --> 00:42:03,838
Joking?

606
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:07,171
I've been watching you. Is
this how you behave in a church?

607
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:09,443
One second ma'am.
Sorry to trouble you

608
00:42:09,517 --> 00:42:11,610
Who are you?
- He is LIC. I mean CBI

609
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:13,119
I'll call the police.

610
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:14,314
It's not what you're thinking.

611
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:15,515
I need to discuss something with you

612
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,317
What?

613
00:42:17,392 --> 00:42:19,451
About your friend Archana

614
00:42:20,195 --> 00:42:21,321
Archana?

615
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,691
What about her?.

616
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:29,102
There's a proposal for her.
Boy's name is Karthik

617
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,105
Plays the keyboard. I'm a
great guy. He's even better!

618
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:33,572
Who?

619
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:40,607
Please don't misunderstand.

620
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:42,741
I stay in the same place as Archana.

621
00:42:42,817 --> 00:42:44,114
When Archana's grandma
fell sick yesterday..

622
00:42:44,185 --> 00:42:46,380
..I was the one who
rushed her to the hospital.

623
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:50,123
I need to talk to
you for ten minutes.

624
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:51,818
Please.

625
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,496
There are somethings in
life that make you wonder why.

626
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:01,762
Archana is one of them.

627
00:43:03,238 --> 00:43:06,696
She was 3, when they found
out she had this defect.

628
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:10,836
After that, her dad slowly
moved away from her and her mother.

629
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,115
Being a single
mother took its toll,..

630
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:17,117
.. so, she never got the love..

631
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:20,279
.. and affection a child
of her age should get.

632
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:24,249
Then her father found another
woman and moved out completely.

633
00:43:24,325 --> 00:43:27,294
At the age of six
she lost her mother.

634
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:31,093
From then, her
grandmother has been her everything

635
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,602
Watching her parents fight,
made her a violent child.

636
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,538
She expects nothing from no one.

637
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:41,097
She despises sympathy,..

638
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:44,577
.. and expects
everyone to appreciate her.

639
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:48,104
For that she studied well,
learnt to paint,..

640
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:51,448
.. sculpt and even
learnt Karate and Kungfu.

641
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:52,577
Yes I saw that

642
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:54,121
If she starts hating something..

643
00:43:54,189 --> 00:43:56,680
..then it's difficult to
change her mind about it.

644
00:43:56,758 --> 00:44:00,626
And she generally feels
men are not to be trusted

645
00:44:00,695 --> 00:44:02,287
Come, let's go..

646
00:44:02,363 --> 00:44:03,455
No wait.

647
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:09,659
I believe I can give her the love
she didn't get from her parents.

648
00:44:09,704 --> 00:44:13,367
Don't ask me why I
feel this, I don't know.

649
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:16,368
I don't know you from before.

650
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:20,107
But you are asking about
Archana in front of God,..

651
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:22,479
.. I believe you will be true.

652
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,542
Will she understand
when we speak with her?

653
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,521
If you see her face and talk,
she can read your lips

654
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:31,851
Doesn't she have any other family?

655
00:44:32,193 --> 00:44:34,718
Her guardian. Mr Ananthakrishnan

656
00:44:34,796 --> 00:44:36,127
I have heard this name before

657
00:44:36,197 --> 00:44:38,097
Stays in the same apartment

658
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:40,292
In fact he is the
apartment secretary

659
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:42,563
Okay, bye.
- Yes, bye.

660
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:47,101
Hey, Karthik.. usually Love
happens, then comes the villain..

661
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:49,507
.. and with him, the problem.

662
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:53,274
Here the problem is ready,
and the villain awaits us.

663
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:56,342
Who next? Grandma?

664
00:44:57,452 --> 00:44:58,646
Coffee.

665
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,846
Thanks.

666
00:45:02,457 --> 00:45:04,584
Sheela told me everything.

667
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:07,594
But who is to tell Archana all this?

668
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:10,192
Do you see that?

669
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:13,098
There was one more Vase,
just like that.

670
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,691
6 months back, I
spoke to her about..

671
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:16,100
..getting married and she broke it.

672
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,569
Really?

673
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:20,164
You don't know about her anger.

674
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:22,106
Sometime back, at the neighbour's..

675
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:24,110
.. a young boy had
come from the army.

676
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:27,306
He fell for her and said, I Love you

677
00:45:27,382 --> 00:45:29,111
She punched his nose in return..

678
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:30,844
..and he went
running back, to Kashmir.

679
00:45:31,185 --> 00:45:32,311
Don't say a thing!

680
00:45:32,387 --> 00:45:34,685
But we can't just leave it, can we?

681
00:45:34,756 --> 00:45:36,451
Want to call him back from Kashmir?

682
00:45:36,524 --> 00:45:38,856
I mean we should be advising her

683
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:40,524
What do you want me to do?

684
00:45:40,595 --> 00:45:41,823
I will handle it.

685
00:45:42,297 --> 00:45:44,492
All I need is your consent

686
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:47,591
I was worried about her future

687
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:50,832
I will be glad to
see her settle down.

688
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:56,233
Your husband is
pestering us to vacate.

689
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:58,108
Ignore him. You just go ahead

690
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:01,842
Just make sure there are
no problems with him..

691
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:07,284
All routes seem clear.

692
00:46:07,355 --> 00:46:09,550
The next person is the Secretary

693
00:46:09,624 --> 00:46:11,717
I must find a place in his heart

694
00:46:11,793 --> 00:46:14,626
Even Aunty failed there!
Where do you stand?

695
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:16,664
Be serious. This is no time to joke.

696
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:18,598
That Fat Cream Bun Arjun..

697
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,759
Who?
- The Secretary's Fatso Son.

698
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,096
I will teach him the keyboards and..

699
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,604
.. make him a little Rehman,
within a month.

700
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:27,368
Now you are joking.
- We have no choice.

701
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:29,103
I'll go to the beach..

702
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:30,838
..cry out my woes and
commit the sin. - All the best.

703
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:32,441
Have to wake up at 5.30 am

704
00:46:32,513 --> 00:46:33,707
Delivering milk?

705
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:36,272
No am going Jogging.
- What? Why?

706
00:46:36,351 --> 00:46:38,444
Archana goes jogging everyday.
- Alone?

707
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:40,111
With her Dog.
- She won't need you then!

708
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,655
Good night.

709
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:45,125
Professor, this is too much.

710
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:46,524
Did you say something?

711
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:48,118
Who else to inform?
And you're sleeping ..

712
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:49,322
What's your plan?

713
00:46:49,397 --> 00:46:50,455
What can I do?

714
00:46:50,498 --> 00:46:52,693
Mr. Ananthakrishnan..

715
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,097
You don't realize the
seriousness of the situation.

716
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:55,863
The consequences could be very bad.

717
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:58,362
You are the right man for this!
- What happened ?

718
00:46:58,439 --> 00:47:01,272
How can you act as
if you know nothing?

719
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:03,606
MGR is unwell, has
been admitted in hospital

720
00:47:03,678 --> 00:47:05,270
What can I do? Am I a doctor?

721
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:06,608
He doesn't even look educated.

722
00:47:06,681 --> 00:47:09,241
Educated in an MBBS I mean!

723
00:47:09,317 --> 00:47:11,114
See? How irresponsible he is

724
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:12,482
Not like that.

725
00:47:12,553 --> 00:47:14,521
It is. MGR is a great leader.

726
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:16,181
They suspect a Brain Tumour.

727
00:47:16,257 --> 00:47:18,122
If something happens..

728
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:19,318
.. it will be a law & order problem.

729
00:47:19,394 --> 00:47:21,225
There won't be newspapers,
nor milk..

730
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:23,126
I'll deliver milk in
your house. Happy?

731
00:47:23,197 --> 00:47:24,562
Even the newspaper.
- Did I ask you?

732
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,464
Just supporting you
- Not necessary

733
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:27,659
I have a helping nature.
That's why. - Shut up.

734
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:31,229
Mr. Ananthakrishnan, You are
the secretary of this apartment.

735
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:33,102
Instead of speaking of security..

736
00:47:33,174 --> 00:47:34,505
.. you are talking like a milk boy.

737
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:36,099
Wait till the next election.

738
00:47:36,177 --> 00:47:37,439
We'll show you who we are.

739
00:47:37,512 --> 00:47:39,275
Mark my words. Your
days are numbered.

740
00:47:39,347 --> 00:47:41,110
Jnana Prakasham, you
are talking too much.

741
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:43,116
No, you are talking too much.

742
00:47:43,184 --> 00:47:45,118
You shut up. Take him away.

743
00:47:45,186 --> 00:47:46,312
Call that security.

744
00:47:46,387 --> 00:47:48,116
Don't worry, sir. Look, I will..

745
00:47:48,189 --> 00:47:50,555
..support you. In the next election,

746
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:53,116
at least by
casting ten false votes..

747
00:47:53,194 --> 00:47:55,458
..I shall make you win.
- Janu, go inside.

748
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,088
Irresponsible idiot.
- Sir, nothing will happen to MGR.

749
00:47:57,198 --> 00:47:59,223
They'll take him to America.

750
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,097
His ministers will
also accompany him.

751
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,569
He will also win the next election.

752
00:48:03,638 --> 00:48:05,538
How?
- His horoscope says so!

753
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:07,301
See. He is answering me responsibly.

754
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:11,641
Mark my words. He will
be the next secretary.

755
00:48:11,713 --> 00:48:14,375
Let that be for now.
Just go home and rest.

756
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:16,747
Whether there's milk or not,
your coffee will taste the same!

757
00:48:18,586 --> 00:48:20,520
Thank you so much son..

758
00:48:20,588 --> 00:48:21,646
Its ok

759
00:48:21,723 --> 00:48:22,781
It's not that.

760
00:48:22,857 --> 00:48:25,758
Everybody is always making
fun of him and ridiculing him.

761
00:48:25,827 --> 00:48:28,694
You are the only one
who speaks to him kindly

762
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,861
How did this happen to him?

763
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:35,162
We had a son.

764
00:48:35,236 --> 00:48:38,637
He was in his 12th class,
when he met with an accident

765
00:48:44,512 --> 00:48:46,480
In 1984?

766
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,107
As soon as we got the call..

767
00:48:50,184 --> 00:48:52,379
.. he was shocked and shaken.

768
00:48:52,453 --> 00:48:55,581
He doesn't know anything
that happened thereafter.

769
00:48:57,191 --> 00:48:58,715
He didn't even shed a tear.

770
00:48:58,793 --> 00:49:03,753
If he had broken down and cried,
this may not have happened.

771
00:49:05,466 --> 00:49:07,593
He never recovered from that shock.

772
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:10,103
As far as he is concerned,..

773
00:49:10,171 --> 00:49:13,800
..this world came to a
stand still that day in 1984.

774
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:17,276
Was your son's name Babu?

775
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:21,506
That's what we called him

776
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:23,607
Sir calls me Babu.

777
00:49:27,388 --> 00:49:31,324
If he had been alive, he
would have been like you.

778
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:08,456
Oh! Good morning.

779
00:50:09,197 --> 00:50:10,459
How is grandma?

780
00:50:10,498 --> 00:50:11,658
Grandma?

781
00:50:17,238 --> 00:50:20,298
You are asking if I jog every day?

782
00:50:21,442 --> 00:50:25,674
Yes. Me, daily. 5
'o' clock.. jogging.

783
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:32,641
Remember sometime back
there was floods in the city?

784
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,278
I jogged even then.

785
00:50:35,256 --> 00:50:36,587
Your dog.

786
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:41,560
Your dog? Very cute.

787
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:44,291
I love dogs.

788
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:48,366
So sweet.. pupy dear.

789
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,670
We want sixer.. we want sixer..

790
00:50:58,746 --> 00:51:02,273
We want sixer.. we want sixer..

791
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,615
We want sixer.. we want sixer.

792
00:51:05,686 --> 00:51:11,682
We want sixer.. we want sixer.

793
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:14,626
Yeah!
- Ahh..h!

794
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:58,229
Karthik, you went like a Hero
and came back like an Item Girl?

795
00:51:58,306 --> 00:52:00,274
Was showing
Archana's dog, my affection.

796
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:01,740
He didn't return my feelings

797
00:52:01,809 --> 00:52:04,107
Heard you broke
athletic records in Chennai.

798
00:52:04,178 --> 00:52:05,304
Shut up!

799
00:52:05,379 --> 00:52:08,348
I heard from the
Apartment kids. Am proud of you!

800
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,444
Didn't realize..

801
00:52:10,518 --> 00:52:12,645
..that a Giant Beast could
be within such a small Dog?!

802
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:15,680
You?

803
00:52:19,193 --> 00:52:20,524
Hello aunty. How come
you've come here alone?

804
00:52:22,596 --> 00:52:23,654
What happened?

805
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,598
It's ok. Control yourself.

806
00:52:30,571 --> 00:52:32,266
Whatever it is, tell me.

807
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,398
But please in Tamil..

808
00:52:33,474 --> 00:52:34,532
.. since I don't know Chinese.

809
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:38,370
What happened to your nose?

810
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,572
Nose?

811
00:52:39,647 --> 00:52:42,172
Shut up, the stitches will come off

812
00:52:42,249 --> 00:52:44,183
Hello Doctor, how come you are here?

813
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:46,185
Convey my regards to
every one at home.

814
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,660
Viji, It hurts like crazy.

815
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:36,362
Doctor poked me,
all around my navel.

816
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,097
What did you expect?
Spin a top around it?

817
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:39,298
Hi.

818
00:53:42,276 --> 00:53:44,369
I heard, a dog bit you?

819
00:53:45,346 --> 00:53:46,438
Even you know about it!

820
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,675
Where did it bite you?

821
00:53:48,749 --> 00:53:50,410
Started in Adyar, then
it bit me in Besant Nagar

822
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:52,777
Where did it bite you on your body?

823
00:53:54,255 --> 00:53:57,122
Nowhere in particular.
Everywhere in general.

824
00:53:57,191 --> 00:53:59,284
I want to see.

825
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:03,128
Is this a national
heritage for public viewing?

826
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:04,596
No college?

827
00:54:04,665 --> 00:54:05,689
I took leave today

828
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,462
Why?
- Didn't feel like going

829
00:54:11,672 --> 00:54:13,765
Can I stay and look after you?

830
00:54:13,841 --> 00:54:15,638
No need. Please leave me alone..

831
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:17,802
Won't you understand my feelings?

832
00:54:18,512 --> 00:54:22,448
The doctor gave me heavy
injections, I feel dizzy.

833
00:54:22,516 --> 00:54:23,574
Need to rest. Do me a small favour?

834
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:24,845
What is it?

835
00:54:25,252 --> 00:54:26,549
A small favour..

836
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,815
Close the door on your way out.

837
00:54:43,504 --> 00:54:44,698
Won't you understand my feelings?

838
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,734
What do I do with this girl?

839
00:54:47,808 --> 00:54:49,639
Be fair! She has the same disease.

840
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,338
Looking at you all
her bulbs are glowing!

841
00:54:52,413 --> 00:54:55,439
You heard only one bell
but she heard a million

842
00:54:55,516 --> 00:54:57,643
She is back

843
00:54:57,718 --> 00:55:00,346
Must be someone else.
Tell them I am indisposed.

844
00:55:02,189 --> 00:55:04,123
How come I am
always invisible to her?

845
00:55:06,293 --> 00:55:07,453
Please come in.

846
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:20,105
HI, please come in.. come.

847
00:55:20,174 --> 00:55:22,267
This is my friend Viji.

848
00:55:23,377 --> 00:55:28,280
I'm Sheela. Yes, I know that.
- Viji. Please sit down. Come.

849
00:55:35,523 --> 00:55:36,649
She says I'm sorry

850
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:38,749
Apologizing for
such a trivial thing.

851
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,100
She says this dog
has never bitten anyone

852
00:55:48,169 --> 00:55:50,103
It was totally unexpected

853
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:52,105
It's ok. It hardly bit me.

854
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:54,641
Just a scratch here
and a minor peck there.

855
00:55:57,178 --> 00:55:59,612
Don't worry about me. Am
perfectly all right actually.

856
00:56:06,187 --> 00:56:07,313
She says your house..

857
00:56:07,388 --> 00:56:08,787
My house is very beautiful, right?

858
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:12,589
Thank you. First
time you have come home.

859
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,321
Coffee.. coffee.

860
00:56:14,395 --> 00:56:16,420
No, we are late for school.

861
00:56:16,497 --> 00:56:19,295
You should come another
day for Coffee definitely.

862
00:56:21,268 --> 00:56:22,462
Okay.
- Okay bye.

863
00:56:25,172 --> 00:56:28,573
Get well soon.
- Oh! Thank you. Bye bye.

864
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:39,611
I have a question.

865
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:43,384
Archana said something
and Sheela explained it.

866
00:56:43,457 --> 00:56:46,426
Then you replied
and Sheela explained.

867
00:56:46,493 --> 00:56:47,858
I have a small doubt.

868
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:50,288
Does this mean Sheela
will be with you forever?

869
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:54,663
Nobody else can think from
such a strange perspective.

870
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,101
But you are correct. I
will learn that as well.

871
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,797
Learn what ?

872
00:56:58,505 --> 00:56:59,597
Sign language.

873
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,835
A
- A

874
00:57:04,178 --> 00:57:07,636

00:57:20,527 --> 00:57:22,654
G
- G

880
00:57:29,236 --> 00:57:31,295
Viji.. Viji.

881
00:57:31,372 --> 00:57:32,430
What is it?

882
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:39,703
Why are you pestering me?
What is your problem?

883
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,611
I said your name is Viji

884
00:57:41,682 --> 00:57:43,115
Did I say, my name is Padayappa?

885
00:57:43,183 --> 00:57:44,309
I was practicing.

886
00:57:44,385 --> 00:57:45,443
Don't act so irresponsibly.

887
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:47,248
Good Morning.
- Good morning.

888
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:50,449
Good evening.
- Good evening.

889
00:57:50,524 --> 00:57:54,517
Good Night.
- Good Night.

890
00:57:55,396 --> 00:57:56,590
Thank you.

891
00:57:56,697 --> 00:57:58,289
Thank you.

892
00:58:00,234 --> 00:58:01,462
Just a minute.

893
00:58:04,171 --> 00:58:06,105
Don't misunderstand..

894
00:58:06,173 --> 00:58:07,299
..but how does one say 'I love you!'

895
00:58:11,245 --> 00:58:12,507
Viji.
- What?

896
00:58:14,682 --> 00:58:17,276
Arrested the Producer? Who
the hell is going to Pay us?

897
00:58:20,387 --> 00:58:22,855
Feeling cold? Why didn't you say so?

898
00:58:23,257 --> 00:58:24,622
I said 'I Love you'.

899
00:58:24,692 --> 00:58:26,125
I am just the person
who should hear that!

900
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:30,491
Who is this?

901
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:34,495
Grandma

902
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:37,562
Grandpa?

903
00:58:38,372 --> 00:58:39,532
Grandpa

904
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:44,303
Who is this?

905
00:58:51,585 --> 00:58:52,677
Means?

906
00:58:54,621 --> 00:58:55,815
My husband

907
00:59:13,374 --> 00:59:14,500
Are you serious?

908
00:59:15,743 --> 00:59:20,180
Yes. Died within a year of
their marriage in an accident.

909
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:23,579
Was shocked when I heard it

910
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,121
Everyone seems to have a sad past
- the Professor..

911
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:34,718
..Archana and now Sheela.
I guess that's how Life is.

912
00:59:35,696 --> 00:59:37,095
The other day at the hospital..

913
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:40,098
..Archana explained
her condition to me..

914
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:42,465
.. with so much
dignity and self respect.

915
00:59:42,503 --> 00:59:48,271
I could see her belief in
Life, beyond her handicap.

916
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:52,108
Today I saw the
same thing in Sheela.

917
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:53,806
Its true.

918
00:59:54,181 --> 01:00:00,279
They are younger than us, but we
have so much to learn from them!

919
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:04,282
Hey.. just pass it.

920
01:00:10,597 --> 01:00:11,655
Good Morning.

921
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:22,101
My name is Karthik..

922
01:00:22,176 --> 01:00:24,406
Karthik.

923
01:00:27,448 --> 01:00:35,116
Your name is Archana..

924
01:00:35,189 --> 01:00:38,488
Archana.

925
01:00:41,428 --> 01:00:43,589
That is a Dog.

926
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:45,698
Angry Dog.

927
01:00:49,236 --> 01:00:50,430
Sorry sir.

928
01:00:50,504 --> 01:00:52,267
No.. no.. no. It's okay.

929
01:00:54,174 --> 01:00:55,835
Be there it self. Be there.

930
01:01:06,253 --> 01:01:07,515
Okay.. okay.

931
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,655

language Words become redundant''

966
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,091
''If we understand
the heart's language ..

967
01:05:49,169 --> 01:05:52,798
..Language itself becomes redundant''

968
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:58,678
The wind's language..

969
01:05:59,379 --> 01:06:04,248
Is it sound.. or music?''

970
01:06:05,585 --> 01:06:10,318
''The flower's language..

971
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:15,327
Is it colour.. or scent?''

972
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:25,731
Good Morning.
- Good Morning, Babu.

973
01:06:25,806 --> 01:06:27,831
Today is my birthday!

974
01:06:29,509 --> 01:06:31,568
Bless me, sir.
- Babu.

975
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:47,426
Here take this book.

976
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:49,789
Thank you, sir.

977
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,561
This book will be
very useful to you.

978
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:54,089
In fifteen years time..

979
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,158
..the world will
depend on Computers.

980
01:06:56,236 --> 01:06:59,637
Writer Sujata has
also written about this.

981
01:06:59,706 --> 01:07:02,300
Nobody listens, when I tell them.

982
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,808
Read this book..

983
01:07:04,177 --> 01:07:06,304
..and any doubts, you ask me!

984
01:07:06,379 --> 01:07:07,846
Anytime, okay?

985
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:13,110
What's your Star sign?

986
01:07:13,186 --> 01:07:14,312
Chitirai

987
01:07:14,387 --> 01:07:16,287
That is Virgo.
- Right

988
01:07:16,356 --> 01:07:18,449
Am going to the temple. I'll
make an offering in your name.

989
01:07:18,525 --> 01:07:20,117
Krishnan, dispose this
Omni at the earliest..

990
01:07:20,193 --> 01:07:23,788
..and there is a model
called Maruti 1000. Buy that.

991
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:26,458
Very good mileage. Good pick up.

992
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:41,443
Good Morning.
- Oh! That. It's my birthday today.

993
01:07:42,515 --> 01:07:43,607
Thank you.

994
01:07:44,784 --> 01:07:46,843
My mom called. I was talking to her.

995
01:07:47,587 --> 01:07:48,781
That's why late!

996
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,822
Professor gave me this as
birthday gift. Yes.. yes.

997
01:07:55,295 --> 01:07:57,490
But nobody understands him here.

998
01:08:01,301 --> 01:08:02,461
What else to do.

999
01:08:02,502 --> 01:08:05,528
As usual. With friends..
party and hotel.

1000
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:13,437
Something useful? Like what?

1001
01:08:34,234 --> 01:08:36,293
I have never seen you here before.

1002
01:08:36,369 --> 01:08:40,772
Thanks for volunteering
such a generous donation.

1003
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,831
Thank you so much.
- No mother.

1004
01:08:43,243 --> 01:08:46,303
You're doing so much good.
Its only a donation.

1005
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:49,746
God bless you. Many happy returns.
- Thank you, Mother.

1006
01:08:58,591 --> 01:08:59,853
Where is Archana?

1007
01:09:18,712 --> 01:09:22,842
They're clapping for you!
Wishing you for your birthday

1008
01:09:39,499 --> 01:09:40,761
This is for your donation!

1009
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:56,709
I've celebrated many birthdays.
This one will be unforgettable.

1010
01:10:02,255 --> 01:10:03,381
Home?

1011
01:10:06,393 --> 01:10:07,519
Come in son

1012
01:10:10,397 --> 01:10:12,092
Is it? Happy Birthday!

1013
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,682
You drew this?

1014
01:10:41,227 --> 01:10:42,455
The Moon.

1015
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:48,258
Oh. The Moon.

1016
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:52,264
The moon reminds me of this story..

1017
01:10:52,338 --> 01:10:54,272
..my mother used to tell me

1018
01:10:56,409 --> 01:10:58,468
Tale.. Story!

1019
01:11:01,714 --> 01:11:03,113
If we miss someone a lot..

1020
01:11:03,183 --> 01:11:06,118
..then think of them
and look at the moon,

1021
01:11:06,186 --> 01:11:08,313
you will see their face in it.

1022
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:11,652
I used to love my grand mom.

1023
01:11:11,724 --> 01:11:14,124
Whenever I missed her,..

1024
01:11:14,194 --> 01:11:18,756
..I used to see the moon
and I could see her face.

1025
01:11:24,237 --> 01:11:26,296
Your mom never told you stories?

1026
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:35,741
Do you miss anybody?

1027
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:41,243
You don't miss anybody?

1028
01:12:08,114 --> 01:12:09,274
Soap!

1029
01:12:11,451 --> 01:12:14,318
You made this? Wow!

1030
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:20,718
For me?

1031
01:12:24,497 --> 01:12:29,560
Gift. Thank you.

1032
01:12:47,253 --> 01:12:49,118
Here you are. Shall we start?

1033
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:51,123
Ok. Your first lesson.
Is this a keyboard?

1034
01:12:51,191 --> 01:12:52,317
Yes, Uncle.

1035
01:12:52,392 --> 01:12:58,194
A Keyboard should not be
used as a dining table! Ok?

1036
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:00,791
Ok, Uncle.
- You are already half Rehman!

1037
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:03,628
No. Wait. First I will teach you.

1038
01:13:03,703 --> 01:13:06,501
You play, and then eat one pakoda.
- Okay, Uncle.

1039
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,107
Keep your fingers here and..

1040
01:13:09,175 --> 01:13:14,511
Cdef.. Gapc.

1041
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:16,811
You are teaching me A B
C D in the wrong order?

1042
01:13:17,183 --> 01:13:20,641
Oh my little genius you! See this..

1043
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:25,419
sa ri ga ma pa da ni sa.

1044
01:13:28,194 --> 01:13:30,685
sa ri ga ma pa da ni sa.

1045
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:36,100
You seem to be doing
only one thing right!

1046
01:13:36,169 --> 01:13:37,295
Keep at it.

1047
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:39,600
Keep practicing, I'll be right back

1048
01:13:43,343 --> 01:13:46,335
Hey that boy..
What the hell is this?

1049
01:13:46,412 --> 01:13:49,108
There is music in a violin.
Can a Violin become Music?

1050
01:13:49,182 --> 01:13:51,514
That fatso is better off..

1051
01:13:52,252 --> 01:13:55,710
Isn't Archana also
like that? What happened?

1052
01:13:56,189 --> 01:13:58,123
I was thinking
- what if like Archana,

1053
01:13:58,191 --> 01:14:00,557
I could also not
hear your nutty laments

1054
01:14:00,627 --> 01:14:02,595
Correct. I was thinking jus that.

1055
01:14:02,662 --> 01:14:05,460
I want to know what
her world is like.

1056
01:14:05,498 --> 01:14:07,398
Great! Do one thing.

1057
01:14:07,467 --> 01:14:09,094
Like Gandhari in Mahabharath..

1058
01:14:09,168 --> 01:14:11,102
..going blind after marriage..

1059
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:13,104
..to see her husband's
world; you also shut your ears..

1060
01:14:13,172 --> 01:14:14,730
- Brilliant idea.

1061
01:14:16,242 --> 01:14:18,369
Hey! Are you nuts?

1062
01:14:19,345 --> 01:14:20,505
Please, Viji.

1063
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:34,591
I have already stuffed 2
rolls of cotton into your ears.

1064
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:36,458
If I have to stuff
more I need Cement.

1065
01:14:37,697 --> 01:14:38,789
Can't you hear me?

1066
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:40,597
Is that so? Ok

1067
01:14:47,751 --> 01:14:48,843
Am leaving now

1068
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:50,479
Am so proud of you man

1069
01:14:50,554 --> 01:14:51,714
No. Don't have to come with me.

1070
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,983
Poor child! Seems to
have finally lost it

1071
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,285
Don't be a fool to think
that she'll love you..

1072
01:16:31,355 --> 01:16:33,619
..if you do such stupid things

1073
01:16:35,593 --> 01:16:38,289
Remember, you
watch planes fly high..

1074
01:16:38,362 --> 01:16:41,559
..while we fly in those very planes.

1075
01:16:41,632 --> 01:16:46,899
Understand this and back
off. I am warning you.

1076
01:16:55,346 --> 01:16:56,836
Okay, break.

1077
01:17:00,751 --> 01:17:01,979
Did you hear that female's voice?

1078
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:03,886
Doesn't that Sound like
the director dubbed for her?

1079
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:06,951
Hey what is it?

1080
01:17:07,858 --> 01:17:09,018
No, Viji..

1081
01:17:10,694 --> 01:17:12,889
If Archana had a voice,
how would it sound?

1082
01:17:12,963 --> 01:17:14,760
It could sound like
that scary lady's voice

1083
01:17:14,832 --> 01:17:17,426
It'll sound like
Lata Mangeshkar's voice.

1084
01:17:17,501 --> 01:17:18,968
Have you heard her talking?

1085
01:17:19,303 --> 01:17:20,497
No

1086
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:22,300
Some people who sing well,
sound awful talking.

1087
01:17:22,373 --> 01:17:23,840
Haven't you heard that?

1088
01:17:24,642 --> 01:17:26,940
Archana's voice will sound perfect

1089
01:17:27,344 --> 01:17:28,641
Have it your way!

1090
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:32,342
I never thought of this!
- What?

1091
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:34,680
No, Viji. Think about it.

1092
01:17:34,752 --> 01:17:36,686
Archana talks to
me in sign language.

1093
01:17:36,754 --> 01:17:38,278
What if I imagine a
voice for her when she does.

1094
01:17:38,355 --> 01:17:39,686
I don't understand

1095
01:17:40,457 --> 01:17:42,288
Whenever she talks to me..

1096
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:44,486
..I will hear a beautiful
voice that I will imagine.

1097
01:17:45,696 --> 01:17:46,822
Like a dubbed film?!

1098
01:17:48,799 --> 01:17:50,460
Waste of time talking to you!

1099
01:17:50,534 --> 01:17:51,626
Where are you going?

1100
01:17:51,702 --> 01:17:53,533
Am going to listen to her voice.

1101
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:56,767
She'll be thrilled to know
she has a beautiful voice.

1102
01:17:56,874 --> 01:17:59,035
You keep plucking on your chords.

1103
01:17:59,643 --> 01:18:02,271
We have heard of 1330 Tirukkurals..

1104
01:18:02,346 --> 01:18:05,281
..but he has set out
to hear one extra one

1105
01:18:05,349 --> 01:18:06,611
Tamilnadu's new discovery!

1106
01:18:28,772 --> 01:18:30,262
I came to see you.

1107
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:33,637
Tell me your name

1108
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:36,805
Tell me your name

1109
01:18:38,749 --> 01:18:41,479
Archana. Archana.

1110
01:18:43,454 --> 01:18:44,751
Tell me my name now

1111
01:18:45,355 --> 01:18:46,481
Why?

1112
01:18:46,557 --> 01:18:48,616
I will tell you.
First tell me my name

1113
01:18:50,594 --> 01:18:53,563
Karthik.. Karthik.

1114
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:54,756
Beautiful.

1115
01:18:54,832 --> 01:18:58,461
What are you doing here?
- We have come on a picnic

1116
01:18:58,535 --> 01:19:00,298
Yes.
- Wait.

1117
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:03,771
What's all this?
- Your voice is beautiful.

1118
01:19:05,642 --> 01:19:06,734
My Voice?

1119
01:19:07,845 --> 01:19:11,337
Yes Archana. When you talk I
am imagining a voice for you.

1120
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:15,350
And do you know.. it
sounds so beautiful!

1121
01:19:15,419 --> 01:19:17,284
Why do I need a Voice?

1122
01:19:17,354 --> 01:19:19,948
When I talk with you
it'll be easier for me.

1123
01:19:20,357 --> 01:19:22,825
So you are finding it tough now?

1124
01:19:22,893 --> 01:19:25,293
Not tough. But just that
we can get more fluent..

1125
01:19:25,362 --> 01:19:26,556
Enough.

1126
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:31,360
If talking to me is so tough,
then don't bother.

1127
01:19:34,738 --> 01:19:37,036
No.. Archana, it's not that.
I didn't mean that.

1128
01:19:39,676 --> 01:19:41,268
You can hear the
voice you have imagined..

1129
01:19:41,345 --> 01:19:43,404
..but I won't because that's not Me.

1130
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,742
So when you talk with me..

1131
01:19:44,815 --> 01:19:47,283
..will you be talking
to this other person?

1132
01:19:47,351 --> 01:19:51,651
Is the real ME so
difficult for you to handle?

1133
01:19:52,856 --> 01:19:57,623
I am happy dealing with people
who accept me for what I am.

1134
01:19:58,695 --> 01:19:59,787
Why do I need..?

1135
01:20:01,532 --> 01:20:06,629
Stop it. Stop imagining a
voice for me. I don't want it

1136
01:20:31,695 --> 01:20:34,493
Archana.. Archana. I am sorry.

1137
01:20:34,565 --> 01:20:35,725
I didn't mean it that way.

1138
01:20:35,799 --> 01:20:36,959
I only meant it in good humour.

1139
01:20:46,877 --> 01:20:48,742
What happened?

1140
01:20:48,846 --> 01:20:51,747
I didn't understand
what she said last.

1141
01:20:54,618 --> 01:20:56,415
I don't have a voice.

1142
01:20:58,589 --> 01:20:59,681
Don't need one either

1143
01:21:04,695 --> 01:21:06,856
I have nothing to say to this world.

1144
01:21:08,432 --> 01:21:09,626
What happened?

1145
01:21:15,706 --> 01:21:17,537
I'll speak to you later.

1146
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,421
You could've just shut up

1147
01:21:38,495 --> 01:21:40,690
Why discover something imaginary

1148
01:21:40,764 --> 01:21:43,426
Now just imagine your love life!

1149
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,558
I didn't know she'll react this way!

1150
01:21:44,635 --> 01:21:45,693
If you want to discover..

1151
01:21:45,769 --> 01:21:46,827
..why not something more useful!

1152
01:21:46,904 --> 01:21:47,962
Herbal Petrol, Tsunami detectors?

1153
01:21:48,038 --> 01:21:50,871
Discovering imaginary voices!

1154
01:21:50,974 --> 01:21:52,271
I thought she'd like it

1155
01:21:52,376 --> 01:21:53,866
Sure
- Now what do I do?

1156
01:21:53,944 --> 01:21:55,536
Sit by yourself and discover

1157
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:57,410
Why are you fighting?

1158
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:59,278
Is this what we struggled for?

1159
01:21:59,349 --> 01:22:01,283
What did I do wrong?

1160
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:02,841
Think about it.

1161
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,285
So far, you have accepted her..

1162
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:07,448
.. for what she is and
she has got used to that.

1163
01:22:07,524 --> 01:22:09,287
Bringing up her voice now..

1164
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:11,657
..only points out
you feel she is flawed.

1165
01:22:11,728 --> 01:22:14,561
Her being upset is justified.

1166
01:22:14,631 --> 01:22:15,689
What if I..

1167
01:22:15,766 --> 01:22:17,290
..told you to imagine
yourself as being beautiful..

1168
01:22:17,367 --> 01:22:18,891
Won't it upset you?!
- Hello.

1169
01:22:18,969 --> 01:22:20,402
This was a joke!

1170
01:22:20,504 --> 01:22:22,563
Please don't stop talking to me.

1171
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,631
I realize I have goofed up.

1172
01:22:25,676 --> 01:22:27,268
Even when she was telling me off..

1173
01:22:27,344 --> 01:22:28,470
..I continued
imagining a voice for her.

1174
01:22:28,545 --> 01:22:29,876
I will apologize

1175
01:22:29,947 --> 01:22:33,713
Be sure what you are going
to tell her when you meet.

1176
01:22:47,364 --> 01:22:52,301
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''

1177
01:22:52,369 --> 01:22:56,533
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''

1178
01:22:56,606 --> 01:23:00,269
''Oh pure moon Will you forgive me?''

1179
01:23:00,344 --> 01:23:06,749
''By mistake I made a
mistake Will you forgive me?''

1180
01:23:06,817 --> 01:23:12,414
''Please listen to my plea..
Why are you so angry?''

1181
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:15,287
''Look at me with
your mysterious eyes ..

1182
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:17,691
''..And withdraw your
curses completely..''

1183
01:23:17,761 --> 01:23:22,562
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''

1184
01:23:22,632 --> 01:23:27,831
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''

1185
01:23:55,432 --> 01:24:05,398
''The moon does not
talk That is not a flaw''

1186
01:24:07,444 --> 01:24:12,541
''If a flaw is considered beautiful..

1187
01:24:12,616 --> 01:24:14,550
..Even life becomes ideal''

1188
01:24:14,618 --> 01:24:20,557
''Oh woman I have understood
You being yourself is beauty''

1189
01:24:20,624 --> 01:24:26,494
''I will not paint a flower
And draw on it a moustache''

1190
01:24:26,563 --> 01:24:31,523
''When you speak with your silence
I will not draw sound from it''

1191
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:34,695
''When the dark
night holds a crescent

1192
01:24:34,771 --> 01:24:36,671
Why force a full moon from it''

1193
01:24:36,773 --> 01:24:41,836
''My life seems
listless My heart is bitter''

1194
01:24:41,878 --> 01:24:46,679
''Gesture that you forgive me
Withdraw your curses completely''

1195
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:52,279
Oh! I'm Sorry.. I'm
sorry.. I'm sorry.

1196
01:24:52,355 --> 01:24:58,453
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry..
I'm sorry.. I'm sorry.

1197
01:24:58,528 --> 01:25:01,964
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''

1198
01:25:02,032 --> 01:25:06,935
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''

1199
01:25:39,636 --> 01:25:43,003
''The smile that you wore,

1200
01:25:44,407 --> 01:25:48,639
The mischief that you showed,''

1201
01:25:50,347 --> 01:25:53,714
''Where did they go?''

1202
01:25:54,451 --> 01:25:56,282
''Your eyes holding
the deep blue sea ..

1203
01:25:56,353 --> 01:25:59,754
..Of a storm they
seem to be warning me''

1204
01:25:59,823 --> 01:26:05,625
''You don't have to cajole
me Just a shrug will do''

1205
01:26:05,695 --> 01:26:08,687
''You don't have to be over friendly

1206
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:10,699
Just a half smile will do''

1207
01:26:10,767 --> 01:26:15,830
''I don't want an angry
glare Just a glance will do''

1208
01:26:15,906 --> 01:26:21,401
''I don't want open doors
Just a window will do''

1209
01:26:21,478 --> 01:26:26,814
''My life passes me Days pass me''

1210
01:26:26,883 --> 01:26:31,547
''Use your mesmerizing eyes
And give me back my life''

1211
01:26:31,621 --> 01:26:37,287
Oh! I'm Sorry.. I'm
sorry.. I'm sorry.

1212
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:42,889
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry..
I'm sorry.. I'm sorry.

1213
01:26:42,966 --> 01:26:46,800
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''

1214
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:51,830
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''

1215
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:57,677
''Oh pure moon Will you forgive me?''

1216
01:26:57,747 --> 01:27:02,582
''By mistake I made a
mistake Will you forgive me?''

1217
01:27:02,652 --> 01:27:07,817
''Please listen to my plea..
Why are you so angry?''

1218
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:13,454
''Look at me with
your mysterious eyes ..

1219
01:27:19,703 --> 01:27:21,637
And withdraw your curses completely.

1220
01:27:21,705 --> 01:27:24,674
I didn't do it on purpose.

1221
01:27:29,446 --> 01:27:30,708
Babu, Please listen.

1222
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,338
Babu, stay there. Archana, go home.

1223
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:34,508
Go home.

1224
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:35,642
What is this, Babu?

1225
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:36,879
Walking around
casually at such a time.

1226
01:27:36,953 --> 01:27:38,614
What happened?

1227
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:41,515
Indira Gandhi has been assassinated.

1228
01:27:42,859 --> 01:27:46,420
She was shot by her own body
guards. 36 bullets, you know.

1229
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:47,622
There are riots in Delhi.

1230
01:27:47,697 --> 01:27:49,028
They are killing all Sikhs.

1231
01:27:49,366 --> 01:27:51,300
There could be unrest here.

1232
01:27:51,368 --> 01:27:54,360
I have locked the front
gate so nobody leaves.

1233
01:27:54,404 --> 01:27:55,962
Come here

1234
01:27:56,039 --> 01:27:57,267
No point depending
on that secretary.

1235
01:27:57,374 --> 01:27:58,841
He is an
irresponsible idiot, you know.

1236
01:28:05,348 --> 01:28:06,713
Why don't you buy me
a pair of slippers!

1237
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:12,615
MGR doesn't know this yet.

1238
01:28:12,689 --> 01:28:14,884
About your torn slippers?
- Stupid, Hey?

1239
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:17,449
Am talking about Mrs.
Gandhi's death.

1240
01:28:17,527 --> 01:28:20,291
MGR is in hospital, how
is he going to bear this.

1241
01:28:20,363 --> 01:28:21,796
Yeah it'll be tough

1242
01:28:21,865 --> 01:28:23,298
If a Prime Minister
herself is not safe..

1243
01:28:23,366 --> 01:28:24,628
Where is this country going to?

1244
01:28:31,574 --> 01:28:34,543
I knew you would be
leaving at this time

1245
01:28:34,644 --> 01:28:38,273
What you don't know is,
that I have been waiting

1246
01:28:38,348 --> 01:28:39,610
What do you want?

1247
01:28:46,623 --> 01:28:50,354
I feel shy looking into
your eyes and talking.

1248
01:28:52,929 --> 01:28:56,296
Sachin, Shahrukh may
drive women crazy,..

1249
01:28:56,366 --> 01:28:59,563
..but you drive all women crazy.

1250
01:28:59,636 --> 01:29:00,967
Please don't go.

1251
01:29:02,739 --> 01:29:06,937
If there is any beauty in this
apartment, it's because of you.

1252
01:29:08,411 --> 01:29:10,743
I may be younger than you..

1253
01:29:10,814 --> 01:29:16,753
..but I lost my heart
the moment I saw you

1254
01:29:18,355 --> 01:29:19,481
Your Hairstyle..

1255
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:21,918
.. your eyes ..

1256
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,688
..that smile ..

1257
01:29:26,429 --> 01:29:28,727
.. so many things about you!

1258
01:29:28,798 --> 01:29:29,992
But..

1259
01:29:49,352 --> 01:29:54,949
''My dear, will you hear my song?'

1260
01:29:55,358 --> 01:29:59,021
'Dear one, are you sad?''

1261
01:30:00,864 --> 01:30:04,459
What is this racket
late in the night?

1262
01:30:04,534 --> 01:30:07,901
I am talking to you.
Can you hear me?

1263
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:09,633
What happened?

1264
01:30:09,706 --> 01:30:12,266
Just as an object comes
crashing down when you drop it..

1265
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:14,275
..from the third to
the ground floor..

1266
01:30:14,344 --> 01:30:17,677
.. my age has too, from
45 years to a mere 28.

1267
01:30:17,747 --> 01:30:21,274
Something's wrong with
you. Since that day..

1268
01:30:21,351 --> 01:30:22,477
Which day?

1269
01:30:22,552 --> 01:30:25,350
Since that day you saw
something and got frightened!

1270
01:30:25,422 --> 01:30:28,448
Why did you have to
remind me of that?!

1271
01:30:28,525 --> 01:30:30,857
Be quiet. The Child will wake up

1272
01:30:30,927 --> 01:30:33,361
Stuff him with chips if he does.

1273
01:30:34,764 --> 01:30:38,495
''What do I tell you? My
heart can't bear this.''

1274
01:30:38,568 --> 01:30:42,470
How do I bear this? I
don't get sleep too.

1275
01:30:42,539 --> 01:30:50,412
Who doesn't have to face this pain?

1276
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:57,852
There is no one above
you in this village.

1277
01:30:58,955 --> 01:31:02,686
I just revealed my sorrow
through singing my song.

1278
01:31:05,562 --> 01:31:10,932
My dear prince, your
sorrow is the one..''

1279
01:31:24,347 --> 01:31:26,781
Did something massive fall down?

1280
01:31:27,617 --> 01:31:28,675
Viji.

1281
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,425
Why is he wearing a blouse?!

1282
01:31:42,932 --> 01:31:47,596
Why are you all staring at me
like an odd exhibit. Help me

1283
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,297
Don't worry sir. He is all right.

1284
01:31:49,372 --> 01:31:51,363
How do you say that?

1285
01:31:51,407 --> 01:31:53,272
Even as he was falling..

1286
01:31:53,343 --> 01:31:56,744
..he was telling me to
switch the motor off.

1287
01:31:56,813 --> 01:31:58,280
Does Aunty know yet?
- Don't ask!

1288
01:31:58,348 --> 01:32:00,282
I called them to inform.

1289
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,284
Told his son about him.

1290
01:32:02,352 --> 01:32:04,286
He told me to get him some Chips!

1291
01:32:04,354 --> 01:32:06,481
Is he a son or a Grinder?

1292
01:32:06,556 --> 01:32:07,648
How did he fall?

1293
01:32:08,758 --> 01:32:10,623
You won't believe me..

1294
01:32:13,463 --> 01:32:14,521
I hope he didn't get hurt.

1295
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:16,355
You too, Viji.

1296
01:32:16,466 --> 01:32:18,331
While falling down he
caught the cable TV wire..

1297
01:32:18,401 --> 01:32:20,335
..telephone cable, etc..

1298
01:32:20,436 --> 01:32:22,336
..and hanging on it, he
landed safely like Spider Man.

1299
01:32:23,339 --> 01:32:25,364
They took him to the hospital.

1300
01:32:30,346 --> 01:32:31,938
But Viji, this is a
very good opportunity.

1301
01:32:32,015 --> 01:32:33,505
To finish him off completely?

1302
01:32:34,384 --> 01:32:35,749
Tomorrow morning, I am
going to meet him to enquire..

1303
01:32:35,818 --> 01:32:37,615
..about his health
with a banquet and..

1304
01:32:37,687 --> 01:32:39,621
..the sacred
vermillion of Goddess Kali.

1305
01:32:39,789 --> 01:32:41,518
I will join you too.

1306
01:32:41,624 --> 01:32:42,784
No, Viji.. you will
spoil the mood if you come.

1307
01:32:42,992 --> 01:32:46,928
I won't speak even a single word.

1308
01:32:46,996 --> 01:32:48,258
I will ask with my
eyes only whether..

1309
01:32:48,331 --> 01:32:49,423
..he is fine just like
Thillana Mohanambal.

1310
01:32:49,499 --> 01:32:50,591
Hey, you may play with me alone.

1311
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:54,330
Don't play tricks on my life. Okay?

1312
01:33:02,512 --> 01:33:03,638
Viji!

1313
01:33:04,347 --> 01:33:05,712
Oh! Please come.. come.

1314
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:23,527
Congratulations! Sorry sir,
it was a slip of the tongue.

1315
01:33:26,336 --> 01:33:27,394
In the morning..

1316
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:28,528
..I had gone to the Thiruverkkadu..

1317
01:33:28,605 --> 01:33:29,663
..temple to do a Kumbabhishekam
(Temple's foundation day )..

1318
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:30,797
I mean, we performed
a floral offering..

1319
01:33:30,873 --> 01:33:31,931
..on sir's name to the goddess.

1320
01:33:32,008 --> 01:33:33,669
As soon as sir recovers..

1321
01:33:33,743 --> 01:33:35,677
..I have prayed to shave off
the head and lift a kavadi.

1322
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:38,772
Hey, shaving off the head
is not for me. But, for sir.

1323
01:33:39,349 --> 01:33:43,342
Won't sir lift a kavadi and all?

1324
01:33:43,453 --> 01:33:44,943
This is very much required
for the work he has done.

1325
01:33:45,021 --> 01:33:46,386
I am not able to face people.

1326
01:33:46,656 --> 01:33:48,817
Aunty, poor man.- Then what? Will a
nyone fear of a dead cockroach?

1327
01:33:48,891 --> 01:33:50,882
That didn't die.
- Oh! Is it alive?

1328
01:33:50,994 --> 01:33:52,689
Where have they admitted it?

1329
01:33:56,966 --> 01:33:59,332
Sir, hope you didn't get much hurt.

1330
01:33:59,402 --> 01:34:01,336
Any way, it would be
better to exercise..

1331
01:34:01,471 --> 01:34:02,529
Hey, keep quiet. Sir, I
need to ask you a small doubt.

1332
01:34:02,672 --> 01:34:04,902
What is it?

1333
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:07,602
Sir, did you fall down while hitt
ing the cockroach or..

1334
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,473
.. after hitting the cockroach?

1335
01:34:09,612 --> 01:34:13,378
Are these details
required now it self?

1336
01:34:13,483 --> 01:34:17,783
Many people have many
doubts even at our flat.

1337
01:34:18,354 --> 01:34:19,446
The watchman is the
only person who says..

1338
01:34:19,522 --> 01:34:21,422
..that you hit the cockroach.

1339
01:34:22,992 --> 01:34:26,291
Rest, every one is saying
that you bit the cockroach, sir.

1340
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:28,263
Will you please get out?

1341
01:34:38,408 --> 01:34:39,466
Sorry.

1342
01:34:42,478 --> 01:34:43,536
Sorry.

1343
01:34:47,417 --> 01:34:48,475
Sorry. Hey.

1344
01:35:07,603 --> 01:35:08,661
Hey, Karthik..

1345
01:35:36,599 --> 01:35:38,692
Still.. still, you
shouldn't have done that.

1346
01:35:38,835 --> 01:35:40,325
I was controlling myself a lot.

1347
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:42,335
He was the one who
started about that cockroach.

1348
01:35:42,505 --> 01:35:44,803
Who, me? That is the reason why I
asked you not to come along.

1349
01:35:44,874 --> 01:35:46,933
Was it possible to control the
laughter on seeing his state?

1350
01:35:55,351 --> 01:35:56,443
I am sorry, Archana.

1351
01:36:12,335 --> 01:36:14,599
Yes. Open it and see.

1352
01:36:29,352 --> 01:36:32,446
A music is coming from inside.

1353
01:36:34,524 --> 01:36:35,616
Thank you.

1354
01:36:36,325 --> 01:36:38,418
Sir, excuse me.
- Thank you.

1355
01:36:39,328 --> 01:36:42,320
Archana.. hope you
won't misunderstand..

1356
01:36:42,398 --> 01:36:44,332
..if I ask you one thing.

1357
01:36:47,336 --> 01:36:50,669
What is music according to you?

1358
01:36:52,341 --> 01:36:56,368
What is music
according to you? What is it?

1359
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,578
Okay.
- Sorry.

1360
01:37:07,323 --> 01:37:08,415
For all of you, music means joy.

1361
01:37:10,893 --> 01:37:13,657
For me, Music is another language.

1362
01:37:15,498 --> 01:37:18,763
I don't know Hindi.

1363
01:37:19,335 --> 01:37:21,895
Don't know Chinese.

1364
01:37:24,507 --> 01:37:28,671
In the same way, I
don't know music also.

1365
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:35,442
But, a language that I know, none
of you know. Silence!

1366
01:37:39,388 --> 01:37:47,420
''Silence.. that silence
is the beauty in you.''

1367
01:37:48,664 --> 01:37:56,833
''The vision is enough. Try
to speak the words with it.''

1368
01:37:58,441 --> 01:38:02,468
''Silence.. that silence
is the beauty in you.''

1369
01:38:02,612 --> 01:38:06,571
''The vision is enough. Try
to speak the words with it.''

1370
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:12,453
''In the words which are
spoken and finished..''

1371
01:38:12,588 --> 01:38:16,524
''..there remains a meaning.''

1372
01:38:22,465 --> 01:38:26,697
''..there remains
crores of meanings.''

1373
01:38:27,003 --> 01:38:31,770
This is my gift to you.

1374
01:38:31,874 --> 01:38:36,334
Bye.

1375
01:39:30,499 --> 01:39:33,332
On that day, the reason why
you stood turning your back..

1376
01:39:33,469 --> 01:39:35,437
..I could understand it now
only when I looked at your face.

1377
01:39:37,773 --> 01:39:39,741
When I look at you, a
thousand butterflies crave..

1378
01:39:39,809 --> 01:39:42,004
..without getting a
place to sit in my heart.

1379
01:39:42,345 --> 01:39:45,280
On seeing you, my age is
hanging on the foot board..

1380
01:39:45,348 --> 01:39:46,645
..just like a college student.

1381
01:39:46,782 --> 01:39:49,910
A kite which had forgotten to fly..

1382
01:39:49,986 --> 01:39:53,786
..after being
stuck on an apple tree.

1383
01:39:54,323 --> 01:39:56,382
I never expected that
it would fly once again.

1384
01:40:00,496 --> 01:40:02,259
Why are you staring like that?

1385
01:40:02,331 --> 01:40:04,561
Can't you understand that
I was waiting for you only?

1386
01:40:05,534 --> 01:40:08,332
Don't go away. I can
understand your confusion.

1387
01:40:09,338 --> 01:40:12,899
I might have scolded you
with love in this apartment.

1388
01:40:12,975 --> 01:40:17,344
You need not tell any thing.
I have the right for it.

1389
01:40:18,681 --> 01:40:20,273
The way I suffer
without getting proper..

1390
01:40:20,349 --> 01:40:21,543
..sleep after having met you..

1391
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:25,383
..it is totally a new experience.

1392
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:31,820
But, would this society accept us?

1393
01:40:31,994 --> 01:40:33,359
Are we residing at America?

1394
01:40:34,497 --> 01:40:37,728
They shall never
accept it, sir. Never.

1395
01:40:37,867 --> 01:40:40,335
When did you come?

1396
01:40:40,436 --> 01:40:42,734
What is this, sir? I thought
that you have changed your mind..

1397
01:40:42,805 --> 01:40:44,329
..but, you are changed
as a man it self, sir.

1398
01:40:44,473 --> 01:40:45,531
Don't touch me, please sir.

1399
01:40:45,608 --> 01:40:46,666
How shameful and
embarrassing it would be..

1400
01:40:46,742 --> 01:40:47,800
..if your wife learns about this?

1401
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:49,878
A bachelor's virginity has
become very unsecured, sir.

1402
01:40:49,945 --> 01:40:51,276
When did you..?
- Don't touch me, sir. Please.

1403
01:40:51,347 --> 01:40:53,110
I didn't expect this from you, sir.

1404
01:40:53,449 --> 01:40:54,848
Hey, brother.. brother.. listen..

1405
01:40:55,317 --> 01:40:56,443
..I was watching the
register of the office. Hey, Viji.

1406
01:40:57,787 --> 01:40:59,618
Are you working at a boy's hostel?

1407
01:40:59,688 --> 01:41:01,622
I shall leave not only this
apartment, but this state also.

1408
01:41:03,292 --> 01:41:05,419
Viji.. Viji.. Viji..- I'm not of
that type, sir. Please leave me.

1409
01:41:07,363 --> 01:41:08,421
At least tell me when you
came before you go. Sorry.

1410
01:41:08,764 --> 01:41:09,856
I never thought that you
will get so much corrupted..

1411
01:41:09,932 --> 01:41:11,263
..on seeing my puppy
shame just for once.

1412
01:41:16,338 --> 01:41:18,363
Come, son. Come inside.

1413
01:41:18,507 --> 01:41:22,568
.Babu.. come.. come.. come.

1414
01:41:24,346 --> 01:41:29,010
What is it, babu? Oh! Chapels!

1415
01:41:44,333 --> 01:41:46,426
Is it all right, sir?

1416
01:41:46,535 --> 01:41:48,696
Fits me like a glove. Good, Babu.

1417
01:41:55,678 --> 01:41:58,340
He has never asked for anything
to anyone like this ever before.

1418
01:41:58,914 --> 01:42:02,350
He asked me very rightfully.

1419
01:42:02,485 --> 01:42:04,646
If I say truly, I am very
happy that he asked me like this.

1420
01:42:05,354 --> 01:42:07,515
I did it just as I would
for my father. That's all.

1421
01:42:07,623 --> 01:42:09,523
I take your leave, mother.

1422
01:42:36,685 --> 01:42:37,743
So that's the end of the film?

1423
01:42:37,987 --> 01:42:39,386
That's the hero introduction.

1424
01:42:39,522 --> 01:42:41,615
How do you make music for this?

1425
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:42,814
That's our fate!

1426
01:42:42,925 --> 01:42:46,793
Please sit down. Hasn't Aunty come?

1427
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:53,700
We know him well. We're his
favourites. Especially Viji

1428
01:42:53,836 --> 01:42:57,328
Okay, fine. Archana..
- Will you eat something? - No

1429
01:42:57,473 --> 01:42:59,600
Cool drinks.
- no. Pepsi - No.

1430
01:42:59,675 --> 01:43:02,439
Coke?
- No. Sir, at least, tea?

1431
01:43:02,511 --> 01:43:03,603
Coffee? - No. Atleast, Bonda? -
No. - Sir, cake? - No. - Chips?

1432
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:04,737
No.
- You can take it for Arjun, sir.

1433
01:43:04,813 --> 01:43:07,338
I said 'no thanks'!

1434
01:43:07,483 --> 01:43:09,383
I have to speak to Archana.
Will you keep quiet?

1435
01:43:09,985 --> 01:43:11,418
Okay, okay.
- Sir, popcorn is very nice..

1436
01:43:12,988 --> 01:43:14,512
Archana, what are you doing here?

1437
01:43:17,326 --> 01:43:19,385
We came shopping.

1438
01:43:19,428 --> 01:43:21,555
Shopping? Why with these fellows?

1439
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,399
She says we are all friends.

1440
01:43:26,535 --> 01:43:28,901
Do you need friends like them?

1441
01:43:29,338 --> 01:43:31,272
Go shopping with Sheela or grandma.

1442
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:33,399
Why with these fellows?

1443
01:43:40,382 --> 01:43:43,510
She says she knows what
kind of friends to choose.

1444
01:43:43,652 --> 01:43:45,347
You don't have to say anything.

1445
01:43:45,487 --> 01:43:46,545
I should not say anything?

1446
01:43:46,689 --> 01:43:48,316
I am your guardian, mind it.

1447
01:43:54,597 --> 01:43:58,260
She says, stop
behaving like a Nutcase..

1448
01:43:58,334 --> 01:44:00,427
.. and to mind your own business.

1449
01:44:00,536 --> 01:44:02,333
Who are you calling a nutcase?

1450
01:44:02,471 --> 01:44:04,530
You. There is no doubt about that

1451
01:44:06,342 --> 01:44:08,367
Okay, I'll see.

1452
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:09,568
You don't know about them.

1453
01:44:10,346 --> 01:44:11,472
Wait till I..

1454
01:44:17,353 --> 01:44:20,584
Why are you saying sorry?
He is like this.

1455
01:44:24,693 --> 01:44:29,494
He told us to vacate, I
told him I won't. That's why

1456
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,434
Karthik is not married yet.

1457
01:44:33,502 --> 01:44:36,335
They don't rent out the space
to bachelors in your apartments

1458
01:44:40,776 --> 01:44:43,677
I said the same thing.
He refuses to get married.

1459
01:44:47,349 --> 01:44:50,341
She's asking you to
find a girl for him

1460
01:44:50,486 --> 01:44:51,544
I can..

1461
01:44:51,787 --> 01:44:56,588
But he has an image
of a girl in his mind.

1462
01:45:00,329 --> 01:45:01,421
Tell her straight

1463
01:45:04,466 --> 01:45:05,524
She should be well read.

1464
01:45:06,769 --> 01:45:11,604
She should be brave.
Independent thinking.

1465
01:45:13,342 --> 01:45:15,276
If she was all that
I just described..

1466
01:45:15,344 --> 01:45:16,902
..she'll be beautiful to me

1467
01:45:24,353 --> 01:45:25,411
What

1468
01:45:31,493 --> 01:45:32,790
What is she saying?

1469
01:45:32,995 --> 01:45:36,328
She is asking if that
girl should know music

1470
01:45:39,335 --> 01:45:40,393
Not necessary

1471
01:45:41,503 --> 01:45:43,334
If I find the girl I want,

1472
01:45:43,472 --> 01:45:46,999
the life I lead with
her will be happy.

1473
01:45:48,677 --> 01:45:51,339
That happiness will
give me good music.

1474
01:45:52,514 --> 01:45:55,574
She only needs to be an
inspiration for my music.

1475
01:45:57,786 --> 01:46:01,722
If she understands me, she
will understand my music as well.

1476
01:46:03,525 --> 01:46:05,425
You might as well
have told her straight

1477
01:46:26,348 --> 01:46:27,406
Hey, Archana..

1478
01:46:27,483 --> 01:46:28,541
Come in

1479
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:32,478
Sit down.

1480
01:46:36,792 --> 01:46:37,816
Cake.

1481
01:46:38,494 --> 01:46:39,586
You made it?

1482
01:47:00,449 --> 01:47:01,541
It's like Music.

1483
01:47:05,354 --> 01:47:06,480
What is music like?

1484
01:47:08,624 --> 01:47:10,387
Like this cake!

1485
01:47:19,334 --> 01:47:20,392
Come here

1486
01:47:33,348 --> 01:47:35,373
Place you palms on these speakers.

1487
01:47:35,517 --> 01:47:37,678
Your palms, on these speakers.

1488
01:47:40,689 --> 01:47:44,318
Now there will be music.
I composed it.

1489
01:47:44,493 --> 01:47:46,586
Watch my hands carefully.

1490
01:47:46,662 --> 01:47:52,498
Okay? 1.. 2.. 3.

1491
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,428
Yes!

1492
01:49:38,674 --> 01:49:39,732
That's it, Archana.

1493
01:49:45,347 --> 01:49:48,339
I know it Archana. I
know you can feel music.

1494
01:49:49,351 --> 01:49:54,516
The Music in the air, you could
see right? Understand it right?

1495
01:49:55,324 --> 01:49:58,316
The same way, you
will understand my mind.

1496
01:50:01,496 --> 01:50:04,590
I want to marry you

1497
01:50:08,337 --> 01:50:09,463
Will you marry me?

1498
01:50:13,508 --> 01:50:14,634
Tell me Archana

1499
01:50:23,485 --> 01:50:24,577
Archana.

1500
01:50:27,322 --> 01:50:29,517
Yes, I am your friend.

1501
01:50:29,925 --> 01:50:32,792
Even after we are married, I
will be a good friend to you.

1502
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:36,388
Why can't you?

1503
01:50:40,902 --> 01:50:43,666
Your world is different..
Don't say that Archana!

1504
01:50:43,772 --> 01:50:47,606
Take me into your world.
We'll live happily. Trust me..

1505
01:51:42,497 --> 01:51:43,623
What else did she say?

1506
01:51:43,765 --> 01:51:46,791
'I can't marry anyone.
My world is different.

1507
01:51:46,968 --> 01:51:48,868
Nobody else can belong there',
is what she said.

1508
01:51:50,338 --> 01:51:53,273
She said that she
could not hear my music..

1509
01:51:53,341 --> 01:51:55,502
.. and she would not either.

1510
01:51:55,644 --> 01:51:56,668
This is what I said

1511
01:51:56,778 --> 01:51:57,836
Why do you need this?

1512
01:51:57,913 --> 01:52:00,609
No. She asked me
what music was like.

1513
01:52:01,483 --> 01:52:02,780
She really understood my music.

1514
01:52:03,452 --> 01:52:05,352
Even when I
stopped moving my hands..

1515
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:07,320
..she still followed the music.

1516
01:52:08,690 --> 01:52:12,421
So I felt like
telling her and I did.

1517
01:52:12,594 --> 01:52:14,255
Am not saying it was wrong..

1518
01:52:14,329 --> 01:52:17,423
..but she seems to hate marriage.

1519
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,568
She fears it. Even I
can't understand why.

1520
01:52:20,702 --> 01:52:21,760
Merely speaking about it angers her.

1521
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:23,895
Archana is a nice girl.

1522
01:52:23,972 --> 01:52:25,530
But anger isn't good for a home.

1523
01:52:25,607 --> 01:52:26,665
Listen..

1524
01:52:26,742 --> 01:52:28,334
.. let this be..

1525
01:52:28,477 --> 01:52:30,672
..there is so much
more to do in life!

1526
01:52:31,513 --> 01:52:32,639
What Viji says is right.

1527
01:52:32,781 --> 01:52:35,545
Forgiving you last time
was itself a big thing.

1528
01:52:35,684 --> 01:52:37,345
I don't think it'll happen again.

1529
01:52:37,486 --> 01:52:38,544
I can't leave it like that

1530
01:52:38,687 --> 01:52:39,779
You'll apologize again?

1531
01:52:39,888 --> 01:52:42,322
Why should I? What did I do wrong?

1532
01:52:42,491 --> 01:52:43,515
Listen!
- I can't!

1533
01:52:44,493 --> 01:52:45,619
Sorry!

1534
01:53:09,985 --> 01:53:11,509
Its ok. Please be here

1535
01:53:13,321 --> 01:53:14,413
What did I do wrong?

1536
01:53:14,623 --> 01:53:16,318
I said I wanted to marry you.

1537
01:53:16,424 --> 01:53:17,482
Why are you so angry about that?

1538
01:53:18,326 --> 01:53:19,418
No, talk to me

1539
01:53:21,496 --> 01:53:22,588
Say something, Archana

1540
01:53:30,505 --> 01:53:31,631
I don't understand

1541
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:39,613
I've already told you everything.

1542
01:53:40,348 --> 01:53:41,440
I will tell you again..

1543
01:53:44,519 --> 01:53:46,714
.. I don't want to see you.

1544
01:53:49,491 --> 01:53:50,583
Get out of my life!

1545
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:29,661
Have you gone mad?

1546
01:54:29,731 --> 01:54:31,358
You are going overboard.

1547
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,000
Is it wrong to propose to you?

1548
01:54:35,503 --> 01:54:37,630
So what if he asks you?

1549
01:54:42,544 --> 01:54:44,375
Is this a reason?

1550
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:46,606
Karthik doesn't
expect you to know music.

1551
01:54:50,352 --> 01:54:51,478
Why won't you get married?
Give me reason

1552
01:54:57,592 --> 01:54:59,526
Karthik doesn't
think of you as a burden.

1553
01:54:59,694 --> 01:55:00,718
He has so much affection for you.

1554
01:55:03,331 --> 01:55:04,423
He won't change

1555
01:55:09,337 --> 01:55:12,568
Just because your father changed
doesn't mean everyone else will.

1556
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:17,510
Ok I don't understand.
So please explain.

1557
01:55:17,979 --> 01:55:19,810
Is this how you want to be
for the rest of your life?

1558
01:55:22,784 --> 01:55:23,910
Why?

1559
01:55:40,502 --> 01:55:41,764
Why are you saying that?

1560
01:55:42,337 --> 01:55:45,966
Why do you think the child
you've will also be like you?

1561
01:55:49,344 --> 01:55:53,542
But that was two generations back..

1562
01:55:53,615 --> 01:55:54,673
..that doesn't mean..

1563
01:55:56,351 --> 01:55:58,376
If it does happen..

1564
01:56:14,336 --> 01:56:15,428
What Archana?

1565
01:56:26,681 --> 01:56:27,739
What help?

1566
01:56:31,486 --> 01:56:32,544
Tell Karthik?

1567
01:56:34,322 --> 01:56:35,414
What?

1568
01:56:46,601 --> 01:56:49,536
Karthik can like anybody and
marry anybody if he wants.

1569
01:56:51,339 --> 01:56:54,968
But I have neither the
intention nor the need for it.

1570
01:57:11,393 --> 01:57:14,487
He doesn't have to see me,
or wait for me either.

1571
01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:18,766
Tell him to marry
someone else and be happy.

1572
01:57:38,353 --> 01:57:42,687
I have never seen her
cry in all these years.

1573
01:57:44,492 --> 01:57:47,586
This was the first time
I saw tears in her eyes

1574
01:57:50,331 --> 01:57:54,665
Okay, Sheela. If that's what
she wants, I have to respect it

1575
01:57:55,403 --> 01:57:58,634
That doesn't mean I'll
forget her and marry someone else.

1576
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:00,773
I just won't disturb her.

1577
01:58:02,343 --> 01:58:03,503
I won't come in her way.

1578
01:58:21,329 --> 01:58:28,599
''Oh silent one The
portrait with talking eyes''

1579
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:36,609
''The child woman My darling chaos''

1580
01:58:36,778 --> 01:58:40,339
''I plucked the heart like a flower''

1581
01:58:40,482 --> 01:58:44,919
''And used my nerves to make a bower''

1582
01:58:44,986 --> 01:58:48,319
''I handed them
over to you, dear one''

1583
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:52,324
And, you stamped over it, girl.

1584
01:58:52,927 --> 01:59:01,426
''Oh silent one The
portrait with talking eyes''

1585
01:59:24,926 --> 01:59:29,329
The rainbow started crying as
soon as it finished filling..

1586
01:59:29,397 --> 01:59:32,730
..the seven colors in it.

1587
01:59:33,268 --> 01:59:36,863
Will you be able to see it again?

1588
01:59:41,009 --> 01:59:48,745
In the mind of the girl,
your life ended up in confusion.

1589
01:59:49,417 --> 01:59:52,750
The sky is shocked
in half dizziness.

1590
01:59:53,488 --> 01:59:56,980
I cried calling for my love.

1591
01:59:57,492 --> 02:00:01,656
You are shaken up
thinking that life is revenge.

1592
02:00:01,729 --> 02:00:05,324
I had plucked the
flowers for your worship.

1593
02:00:05,466 --> 02:00:08,993
You are frightened it
is killing the flowers.

1594
02:00:09,337 --> 02:00:16,869
I loved you with my words. You
killed me with your illusions.

1595
02:00:17,278 --> 02:00:24,810
I just asked for the rain, you
gave me thunders and lightening.

1596
02:00:25,353 --> 02:00:32,725
''Oh silent one The
portrait with talking eyes''

1597
02:01:05,293 --> 02:01:13,257
''The fire is also a beauty in
the forest of bamboo shoots.''

1598
02:01:13,534 --> 02:01:17,402
But, I never enjoyed them.

1599
02:01:21,342 --> 02:01:29,408
My heart just can't bear this.
In your anger, you are a beauty.

1600
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:37,389
But, I can't enjoy it. Dear one,
my heart can't tolerate this.

1601
02:01:37,492 --> 02:01:41,326
''Seeing your state, my heart
is beating outside my body.''

1602
02:01:41,596 --> 02:01:43,461
''As your heart has
torn into two pieces..

1603
02:01:43,531 --> 02:01:45,465
..my heart has torn
into four pieces.''

1604
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:49,331
''If the seed is broken,
a plant is grown.. ''

1605
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:57,002
''If the heart is broken,
grass only will grow.''

1606
02:01:57,345 --> 02:02:04,808
''What is a punishment in
comparison to your silence?''

1607
02:02:06,821 --> 02:02:09,688
Shall we eat something?
- I am not hungry

1608
02:02:09,724 --> 02:02:11,692
Then you eat, I just
want some Coffee..

1609
02:02:12,894 --> 02:02:14,327
HI.
- HI. Viji..

1610
02:02:15,463 --> 02:02:16,521
I'll be upstairs

1611
02:02:19,334 --> 02:02:22,861
He's like that only. Okay, carry on.

1612
02:02:22,937 --> 02:02:24,404
Bye.
- Bye.

1613
02:02:31,813 --> 02:02:33,804
What is this? You just left abruptly

1614
02:02:34,349 --> 02:02:35,475
What else should I have done?

1615
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:36,949
You could have said Hello

1616
02:02:37,552 --> 02:02:38,746
Why? Didn't she clearly state..

1617
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:41,015
..that I should not
see her or talk to her

1618
02:02:41,522 --> 02:02:43,319
Look here. She may have just
said that in anger.. - No.

1619
02:02:44,292 --> 02:02:45,384
Remember the happiness in her eyes..

1620
02:02:45,893 --> 02:02:47,861
when she saw that
locket at the restaurant.

1621
02:02:48,596 --> 02:02:49,927
I gave it to her without her asking.

1622
02:02:51,999 --> 02:02:59,929
Today she has asked for this.
Its better I give this to her

1623
02:03:59,534 --> 02:04:02,264
What? What did you want to tell me?

1624
02:04:02,336 --> 02:04:03,598
Am feeling shy..

1625
02:04:04,405 --> 02:04:05,463
What is it?

1626
02:04:06,274 --> 02:04:08,936
Its nothing. You
shouldn't laugh at me..

1627
02:04:09,944 --> 02:04:11,002
Ok, tell me

1628
02:04:12,613 --> 02:04:17,812
The bulb glowed for me as
well.. even the bell rang.

1629
02:04:22,890 --> 02:04:24,380
See you're laughing

1630
02:04:24,492 --> 02:04:26,858
Ok. Who is it?

1631
02:04:28,596 --> 02:04:29,654
Sheela.

1632
02:04:31,265 --> 02:04:32,323
Sheela?

1633
02:04:33,868 --> 02:04:34,994
When did this happen?

1634
02:04:37,004 --> 02:04:40,337
Yesterday, in the shopping mall

1635
02:04:41,342 --> 02:04:45,802
..I thought about it
at first, then I decided

1636
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:46,938
Decided what?

1637
02:04:47,815 --> 02:04:48,941
To marry her

1638
02:04:53,621 --> 02:04:56,419
I am so happy. You
have such large heart

1639
02:04:57,892 --> 02:04:58,984
Nothing of that sort.

1640
02:04:59,594 --> 02:05:00,652
I am not giving her a life..

1641
02:05:00,728 --> 02:05:01,990
..just sharing mine
with her, like you said

1642
02:05:04,932 --> 02:05:08,925
Ok let's get to work. We
should first tell Sheela this

1643
02:05:10,471 --> 02:05:14,339
I know you feel awkward about it.
Don't worry -I will speak to her

1644
02:05:14,408 --> 02:05:18,606
Hey Viji, You think I
won't do this for you?

1645
02:05:19,413 --> 02:05:21,347
Not that. I already spoke to her.

1646
02:05:22,817 --> 02:05:23,943
When?

1647
02:05:24,552 --> 02:05:25,746
This morning at the church

1648
02:05:29,290 --> 02:05:30,780
Hold on! License check

1649
02:05:30,892 --> 02:05:31,916
It's you!

1650
02:05:32,593 --> 02:05:33,651
Coming from the church?

1651
02:05:33,728 --> 02:05:35,252
Wow what gave it away?

1652
02:05:35,329 --> 02:05:36,591
You have started talking like me

1653
02:05:37,265 --> 02:05:39,859
It's infectious. How
come you are here?

1654
02:05:40,401 --> 02:05:41,925
Just that I had no
recordings today. Felt bored.

1655
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:44,932
So I thought I will meet
you and ask you to marry me!

1656
02:05:46,274 --> 02:05:47,400
Why are you so shocked?

1657
02:05:47,808 --> 02:05:50,936
Ok let me get right to the
point. I wish to marry you.

1658
02:05:51,445 --> 02:05:53,606
You know about me. I play
the keyboard, earn well.

1659
02:05:53,681 --> 02:05:55,774
Have already gotten
my sister married.

1660
02:05:55,850 --> 02:05:57,613
So it's only me and
my mom. I am free.

1661
02:05:57,885 --> 02:05:59,284
Other than that I've an
occasional beer on Beethoven..

1662
02:05:59,353 --> 02:06:01,878
..or Michael Jackson's
birthday? Any problem?

1663
02:06:06,327 --> 02:06:11,390
So suddenly. You
know about me, right?..

1664
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:13,658
I know. What about it?

1665
02:06:13,868 --> 02:06:16,393
I am not concerned about your past.

1666
02:06:16,470 --> 02:06:18,404
It could happen to anyone.

1667
02:06:18,472 --> 02:06:20,872
Even I could not walk for
around a year and a half!

1668
02:06:21,275 --> 02:06:22,537
People had to carry me around.

1669
02:06:22,877 --> 02:06:24,811
Yes. But I was a baby then

1670
02:06:28,282 --> 02:06:29,874
Okay, jokes apart.

1671
02:06:29,951 --> 02:06:32,749
I've told you what I needed
to say, now it's your turn.

1672
02:06:36,624 --> 02:06:38,592
Is this how you really spoke?
- Yes.

1673
02:06:38,693 --> 02:06:39,717
So what did she say?

1674
02:06:39,794 --> 02:06:41,261
First she was scared,
stared around a bit,..

1675
02:06:41,329 --> 02:06:44,787
..then asked me to
speak to her parents

1676
02:06:45,399 --> 02:06:50,268
Great. But please don't
speak to her parents like this.

1677
02:06:50,338 --> 02:06:51,532
I already spoke to them too.

1678
02:06:52,273 --> 02:06:53,399
When did this happen?

1679
02:06:54,275 --> 02:06:56,869
I went straight to her house
- What did they say?

1680
02:07:00,948 --> 02:07:04,008
What is this? Is this is a
general family reaction?

1681
02:07:05,019 --> 02:07:08,887
It's totally unexpected.
We don't know what to say

1682
02:07:09,523 --> 02:07:10,683
Don't misunderstand my asking.

1683
02:07:10,891 --> 02:07:13,325
Do you've issues
with her marrying again?

1684
02:07:14,261 --> 02:07:15,592
Nothing of that sort.

1685
02:07:15,663 --> 02:07:18,928
I pray everyday that
something like this should happen.

1686
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,729
Do let me know.

1687
02:07:21,535 --> 02:07:22,593
I won't press you to
tell me tomorrow..

1688
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:24,001
..you can even tell me today

1689
02:07:25,272 --> 02:07:26,534
Are you married already or ..

1690
02:07:26,607 --> 02:07:28,006
Not yet!

1691
02:07:28,476 --> 02:07:30,273
They asked me if they
can have a church wedding.

1692
02:07:30,344 --> 02:07:33,279
People get married in
all sorts of places..

1693
02:07:33,347 --> 02:07:35,542
.. a church is
perfectly fine for me!

1694
02:07:35,816 --> 02:07:37,283
I'll tell you something beautiful..

1695
02:07:37,351 --> 02:07:40,616
..I told my mother yesterday.

1696
02:07:41,622 --> 02:07:43,522
I was wondering how she would react.

1697
02:07:43,724 --> 02:07:44,884
Do you know what she did

1698
02:07:45,593 --> 02:07:48,790
She looked at me for a bit and
then kissed me on my forehead.

1699
02:07:50,464 --> 02:07:53,865
She used to kiss me on my
forehead before going to school.

1700
02:07:54,802 --> 02:07:57,794
After all those years,
only now.. I got goose bumps.

1701
02:07:58,939 --> 02:08:01,271
Having lost her
husband early in her life..

1702
02:08:01,342 --> 02:08:03,333
..she could understand Sheela well.

1703
02:08:03,611 --> 02:08:05,272
It was so touching.

1704
02:08:08,416 --> 02:08:09,474
So when is the wedding?

1705
02:08:10,818 --> 02:08:11,944
Lets see.

1706
02:08:13,888 --> 02:08:15,617
What?

1707
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:17,282
So we can fix it anytime,..

1708
02:08:17,324 --> 02:08:19,884
..but I asked it to be
put off by a bit. - Why?

1709
02:08:21,595 --> 02:08:23,460
Let things sort themselves out
with you, when can have it then

1710
02:08:25,332 --> 02:08:26,731
I know what you're talking about

1711
02:08:27,268 --> 02:08:29,395
That's a closed chapter.
It's my problem.

1712
02:08:29,470 --> 02:08:30,994
Life doesn't end here.

1713
02:08:31,806 --> 02:08:34,274
Moreover if you get married now..

1714
02:08:34,341 --> 02:08:36,275
..it'll be a
welcome diversion for me.

1715
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:38,009
Do that for me at least

1716
02:08:38,345 --> 02:08:39,403
No, Karthik.

1717
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:40,811
Hey, Viji.. please.

1718
02:08:43,551 --> 02:08:44,609
Okay.

1719
02:09:07,541 --> 02:09:08,599
What did she say?

1720
02:09:08,809 --> 02:09:11,277
She is talking about the
way you proposed to me

1721
02:09:11,345 --> 02:09:14,405
Even I am shocked.

1722
02:09:14,615 --> 02:09:16,606
Got to know the
result within the day's..

1723
02:09:16,684 --> 02:09:18,618
..play like in a One Day match

1724
02:09:21,288 --> 02:09:23,279
People all around have
been waiting for years,..

1725
02:09:23,324 --> 02:09:25,292
..having changed names,
identities, cities..

1726
02:09:25,326 --> 02:09:26,657
..and even languages just for this!

1727
02:09:30,664 --> 02:09:31,858
Did I say so something wrong?

1728
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:41,340
Yeah she is a great girl.

1729
02:09:41,408 --> 02:09:43,467
But ask for her license,
and she gets angry.

1730
02:09:47,548 --> 02:09:50,415
Me? Thank you. But Archana,

1731
02:09:50,618 --> 02:09:52,882
Karthik is much nicer than me.

1732
02:09:56,590 --> 02:10:00,253
When your friend finds herself
a life, aren't you so joyous;..

1733
02:10:00,327 --> 02:10:03,262
..in the same way,
won't I be ..joyous..

1734
02:10:03,330 --> 02:10:07,266
..if the same
happened with my friend

1735
02:10:08,602 --> 02:10:11,537
We would all be overjoyed

1736
02:10:24,819 --> 02:10:28,311
Tried a serious role for a change
- not working at all!

1737
02:10:36,797 --> 02:10:37,923
I don't understand

1738
02:10:38,599 --> 02:10:39,657
What don't you understand?

1739
02:10:40,668 --> 02:10:42,795
Archana and Karthik
are getting married

1740
02:10:43,404 --> 02:10:46,931
No that's what we want. We
will make sure it comes true

1741
02:10:47,274 --> 02:10:48,332
Yes

1742
02:10:48,609 --> 02:10:51,874
But they've fought and are
not talking to each other?!

1743
02:10:51,946 --> 02:10:53,277
Yes!

1744
02:10:54,014 --> 02:10:55,345
Are you drunk?

1745
02:10:56,016 --> 02:10:57,278
What do you mean?

1746
02:10:57,551 --> 02:10:59,348
If Archana has to get married,
won't I find her a boy?

1747
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:00,478
Who? You?

1748
02:11:00,521 --> 02:11:01,613
The last time you found a boy,..

1749
02:11:01,689 --> 02:11:03,281
..even his own
mother didn't like him.

1750
02:11:03,324 --> 02:11:05,884
If Archana had seen him,
she would've chased him away.

1751
02:11:06,293 --> 02:11:08,386
So, you'll get her
married to Karthik?

1752
02:11:08,462 --> 02:11:09,861
Why, what's wrong with that?

1753
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:11,397
Do you know he is a drunkard?

1754
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:13,260
Who is a drunkard?
Maybe one day he may have..

1755
02:11:13,334 --> 02:11:14,528
You keep quiet.

1756
02:11:15,269 --> 02:11:16,327
You also drank.

1757
02:11:16,537 --> 02:11:18,266
At Jayaram's wedding,
you were drunk..

1758
02:11:18,339 --> 02:11:19,465
..and lying sprawled in the kitchen!

1759
02:11:19,540 --> 02:11:20,598
When did this happen?

1760
02:11:20,674 --> 02:11:21,732
Didn't you know?!

1761
02:11:24,278 --> 02:11:25,745
You are talking unnecessarily.

1762
02:11:26,614 --> 02:11:27,876
Didn't you find any other place?

1763
02:11:27,948 --> 02:11:29,609
In the kitchen!!

1764
02:11:30,284 --> 02:11:32,684
Okay, control your self Janu.
Now what do you both want?

1765
02:11:33,721 --> 02:11:34,881
Look here..

1766
02:11:35,422 --> 02:11:37,890
I'm not asking you to
conduct this wedding

1767
02:11:37,925 --> 02:11:39,893
I believe it'll happen for sure.

1768
02:11:39,927 --> 02:11:42,259
But when it does, and I
see you interfering,..

1769
02:11:42,329 --> 02:11:45,321
..I'll end your life
with my bare hands.

1770
02:12:42,623 --> 02:12:44,887
Go give this locket to that aunty.?

1771
02:12:44,925 --> 02:12:45,983
Okay, Uncle.

1772
02:12:55,669 --> 02:12:56,931
That uncle told me to give it to you

1773
02:13:14,521 --> 02:13:15,613
Don't want!

1774
02:13:31,805 --> 02:13:35,002
Your Mother.. Where? Your Father?

1775
02:13:47,921 --> 02:13:49,013
School?

1776
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:57,317
Babu can you come to
the hospital with me

1777
02:14:58,292 --> 02:14:59,316
What happened sir?

1778
02:14:59,593 --> 02:15:02,994
My son has met with accident.

1779
02:15:05,265 --> 02:15:06,527
I just got a call.

1780
02:15:07,868 --> 02:15:12,328
He always wears a helmet. He
seems to have forgotten today.

1781
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:14,931
The Corporation lorry
crashed straight into him it seems.

1782
02:15:16,877 --> 02:15:20,608
My wife doesn't know yet.
She wont be able to bear it.

1783
02:15:21,281 --> 02:15:24,409
Was preparing for
the IIT entrance exam.

1784
02:15:25,752 --> 02:15:29,313
Even now he had gone to a
Friend's house to pick up notes.

1785
02:15:29,623 --> 02:15:32,319
I even told him, not
to go out so late..

1786
02:15:32,392 --> 02:15:34,326
..to wait till the morning.

1787
02:15:34,595 --> 02:15:38,258
He had said that the exam
was very important to him,..

1788
02:15:38,332 --> 02:15:42,860
..and he wanted to get
good marks and a good rank.

1789
02:15:45,005 --> 02:15:46,336
Very ambitious boy.

1790
02:15:49,276 --> 02:15:50,675
They say it's a head injury.

1791
02:15:51,812 --> 02:15:53,006
Body seems unhurt.

1792
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:56,807
Can you come with me to
the hospital, Babu? Please.

1793
02:16:00,287 --> 02:16:02,881
Your son met with an accident
and died on the Spot damn it!

1794
02:16:03,991 --> 02:16:07,984
He died in the year 1984,
it's been 20 years since!

1795
02:16:08,262 --> 02:16:10,321
We are in 2007 now. MGR is dead,

1796
02:16:10,397 --> 02:16:13,332
Indira Gandhi is
dead and so is your son!

1797
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,265
You Bloody Fool! Are
you not educated?!

1798
02:16:15,335 --> 02:16:18,270
Your Azharuddin,
Computers are all ancient now.

1799
02:16:19,273 --> 02:16:20,331
Look there.

1800
02:16:20,407 --> 02:16:22,534
Your wife! Do you
know why she is crying?

1801
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:26,005
She's not crying for your dead son.

1802
02:16:26,413 --> 02:16:27,471
She's crying for you, damn it..

1803
02:16:27,548 --> 02:16:28,879
.. she doesn't even know if
her husband's normal or insane.

1804
02:16:28,949 --> 02:16:32,544
Your babu is dead!
Damn it. He is dead.

1805
02:16:32,619 --> 02:16:34,712
If you want, take me as your son.

1806
02:16:34,821 --> 02:16:39,724
Cry. Cry your heart out!

1807
02:16:39,793 --> 02:16:46,926
Cry, man.. cry. Cry.. cry.. cry.

1808
02:17:20,334 --> 02:17:21,392
I am sorry.

1809
02:17:22,869 --> 02:17:23,927
Why sir?

1810
02:17:24,605 --> 02:17:25,731
For all that happened!

1811
02:17:29,276 --> 02:17:31,676
Some things take
some time to understand.

1812
02:17:32,813 --> 02:17:33,939
I have understood only now!

1813
02:17:35,882 --> 02:17:37,406
Archana will also understand.

1814
02:17:38,752 --> 02:17:39,810
She will.

1815
02:17:40,821 --> 02:17:42,311
Just felt like telling you

1816
02:17:43,890 --> 02:17:45,585
Hello there. One minute

1817
02:17:49,429 --> 02:17:51,659
Congratulations!
- Thank you, sir.

1818
02:17:52,599 --> 02:17:54,931
After marriage he
wants to move in here.

1819
02:17:55,002 --> 02:17:57,800
Oh! Excellent. You are most welcome.

1820
02:17:58,772 --> 02:17:59,830
Will you call me for the wedding?

1821
02:17:59,906 --> 02:18:01,464
The first invite will be yours

1822
02:18:01,541 --> 02:18:02,599
Okay.. okay.

1823
02:18:08,815 --> 02:18:10,282
Hey come..

1824
02:18:14,288 --> 02:18:15,414
How come suddenly?

1825
02:18:17,324 --> 02:18:18,382
What are you looking at?

1826
02:18:25,332 --> 02:18:26,390
What is this?

1827
02:18:35,609 --> 02:18:36,667
What is all this?

1828
02:18:38,278 --> 02:18:39,336
A gift?

1829
02:18:42,883 --> 02:18:44,282
Why are you giving it now?

1830
02:18:44,418 --> 02:18:45,544
Come to the wedding
and give it yourself

1831
02:18:59,499 --> 02:19:01,990
Hey? What's happened to you?

1832
02:19:10,677 --> 02:19:12,736
You wont come for the wedding? Why?

1833
02:19:18,552 --> 02:19:19,814
Of course everybody will be there

1834
02:19:24,491 --> 02:19:25,719
Is this because
Karthik will be there?

1835
02:19:30,797 --> 02:19:33,527
What are you talking about?
What can Karthik do to you?

1836
02:19:33,734 --> 02:19:35,463
There is nothing
between you guys, right?

1837
02:19:39,773 --> 02:19:40,865
Why can't you see him?

1838
02:19:46,613 --> 02:19:47,671
What do you mean Understand?

1839
02:19:47,748 --> 02:19:49,272
You may have a hundred problems,..

1840
02:19:49,349 --> 02:19:51,340
..that doesn't mean you
don't come for my wedding.

1841
02:19:57,791 --> 02:19:59,486
Here. Keep this.

1842
02:19:59,893 --> 02:20:02,259
If you want to give it to
me. Give it at the wedding

1843
02:20:05,265 --> 02:20:07,256
Listen. If you don't
come for my wedding,..

1844
02:20:07,334 --> 02:20:09,859
..I don't want to
see you ever again.

1845
02:20:24,284 --> 02:20:26,548
What do you mean by just
walking out? Is that all?

1846
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:28,017
Are you coming for
the wedding or not?

1847
02:21:06,393 --> 02:21:08,258
If this remains with me,
it won't be a violin..

1848
02:21:08,328 --> 02:21:09,386
..it'll just be a piece of soap.

1849
02:21:11,598 --> 02:21:14,260
Apparently you said you won't
come for Sheela's wedding. Why?

1850
02:21:16,603 --> 02:21:17,661
Why?

1851
02:21:25,545 --> 02:21:26,603
Just because I will be there?

1852
02:21:27,614 --> 02:21:29,878
Have I disturbed you
even once since that day?

1853
02:21:30,417 --> 02:21:33,318
I stayed away thinking, even
seeing me could cause you pain.

1854
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:35,711
You have made me seem
like a cheap Roadside Rogue.

1855
02:21:37,591 --> 02:21:39,718
You not coming to the
wedding because of me is a LIE.

1856
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:41,784
You are afraid of yourself.

1857
02:21:41,928 --> 02:21:44,863
But you pretend you're not.
That's the biggest problem.

1858
02:21:46,933 --> 02:21:49,993
All are affectionate with you.
It's you who doesn't understand.

1859
02:21:50,804 --> 02:21:53,329
Many people hate life
and kill themselves.

1860
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:55,605
You're the only one who has
killed Life and continues living.

1861
02:22:01,014 --> 02:22:07,886
How are you able to pretend
being dumb to your own self? Sorry..

1862
02:22:09,523 --> 02:22:10,581
I am telling you for the last time.

1863
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:12,521
You won't face any
problems because of me.

1864
02:22:12,792 --> 02:22:14,919
If you trust yourself, then come..!

1865
02:22:16,763 --> 02:22:18,856
If in spite of this you
don't turn up ..then..

1866
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:51,794
I can see the desire to Live
in your eyes. Why deny yourself?

1867
02:22:54,401 --> 02:22:55,459
Why won't you give Life a chance?

1868
02:22:56,403 --> 02:22:57,597
Trust me, you won't lose.

1869
02:22:59,673 --> 02:23:00,799
What is your fear, Archana?

1870
02:23:01,975 --> 02:23:03,806
That you will have a child
and it'll turn out like you.

1871
02:23:03,877 --> 02:23:05,606
Is that all?

1872
02:23:07,447 --> 02:23:10,883
If such a thing happens I will
not run away like your father did.

1873
02:23:12,819 --> 02:23:14,480
I will bring my child
up like my own life.

1874
02:23:16,923 --> 02:23:19,721
Some things in life you have
to trust, without questioning.

1875
02:23:22,762 --> 02:23:25,253
Someday you will
realize you were wrong,..

1876
02:23:25,332 --> 02:23:28,267
..but it may be too
late to set it right!

1877
02:23:31,671 --> 02:23:36,938
I loved your silence as
much as I loved my music.

1878
02:23:43,617 --> 02:23:45,016
But it's you..
- ..it's you who made me cry!

1879
02:25:11,938 --> 02:25:16,272
My dear Bride and Groom

1880
02:25:16,543 --> 02:25:21,674
In the August presence of the
holy fathers and invited guests

1881
02:25:21,781 --> 02:25:23,749
You're here to seek
the blessings of god

1882
02:25:23,817 --> 02:25:25,751
Jesus is
wholeheartedly blessing your love

1883
02:25:25,819 --> 02:25:29,721
He has already blessed
you after your baptism

1884
02:25:29,823 --> 02:25:32,690
Now through the
divine path of marriage

1885
02:25:32,726 --> 02:25:37,254
He's encouraging you to untidily..

1886
02:25:37,330 --> 02:25:42,324
..shoulder the
responsibility of life

1887
02:25:42,402 --> 02:25:46,600
Now I ask your consent
in this divine place

1888
02:25:47,273 --> 02:25:50,265
Have you both come here
to marry wholeheartedly..

1889
02:25:50,343 --> 02:25:52,277
..without anyone's compulsion?

1890
02:25:52,345 --> 02:25:54,336
Hasn't Archana come?
- Don't know

1891
02:25:55,548 --> 02:25:58,278
Are you ready to love each
other for the entire life time..

1892
02:25:58,351 --> 02:26:01,912
..forgetting all
your woes and defects?

1893
02:26:02,021 --> 02:26:07,721
Karthik, look there.

1894
02:26:07,794 --> 02:26:09,261
Will you grow the bonding and..

1895
02:26:09,329 --> 02:26:12,321
..love for the common people
accepting The Christ's orders?

1896
02:26:12,398 --> 02:26:13,797
Yes, we shall.

1897
02:26:13,867 --> 02:26:14,993
- Your wedding..

1898
