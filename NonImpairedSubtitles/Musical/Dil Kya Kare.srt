1
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,502
Well, Papa? Have you
forgotten the keys again

2
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,768
Have you found the keys?

3
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,671
What happened?
- Not the car. Stop whistling!

4
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,701
You really scared me.

5
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:12,304
Are you leaving this evening?
- Yes. Got to earn a living.

6
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,803
To Mumbai. For a day.

7
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,703
l'm building a 5-star hotel there.
- And then?

8
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,569
And then to Bhopal.
- What for?

9
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:27,202
l've got to address a meeting
of architects there.

10
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:30,402
And then?
- Two days in Lucknow.

11
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,234
To finalise a site
for the TV-station.

12
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,434
...that's four days.

13
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:43,070
You're scared of flying. So how
much time will the trains take?

14
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,535
That makes it three days more.

15
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:52,004
l days?! Don't you know l have
my inter-school contest?!

16
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:55,002
That's only six days away.
- And so?

17
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:58,202
Don't wory. l'll wrap up my
work in Lucknow in just a day.

18
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:01,766
l won't dance if
you don't return...

19
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:07,869
and then, the showjust
can't be held.

20
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,471
Just watch! l'll be applauding
you from the first row!

21
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,568
Do return soon, Papa!

22
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:27,667
Look at this, sir.

23
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,237
And look at the layout
ofthe cover-page.

24
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,671
This isn't the picture on it, sir.
It needs a dreamy expression.

25
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,868
We've issued a print order
of 10,OOO copies.

26
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,902
We'll come out with the second
edition once it gains popularity.

27
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:48,737
Look at the fonts we've used...
isn't it really class?

28
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:53,571
You couldn't have had a better title
than ''What does the heart do''

29
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,835
The title's okay.
But take my name offthe cover.

30
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,536
l see! Poems by the
anonymous poet?!

31
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,234
lsn't that class?

32
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,468
l've made a design
for the book, sir.

33
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:14,134
Where've you been, Somu?

34
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:20,137
l'm so worked up! Anand is away.
And Ram Dulare's taken the day off.

35
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,334
Who'll pick up Neha from school
if l'm delayed?

36
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,869
One moment, Kavita...
- Damn your one moment!

37
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,336
A packet ofturmeric...
the other one.

38
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:31,267
A packet of red pepper, too.

39
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,270
What picture on the cover, sir?
- Red pepper, of course.

40
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,367
Red pepper and poety!

41
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,834
Somu?! You, too?

42
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:50,704
Strange man!
A rich man and a poet!

43
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,868
''l kiss those rays
with your lips.._'

44
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:08,037
''rays that have travelled
the darkness to touch these bars''

45
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,701
''l touch those winds
with your hands.._'

46
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:14,502
''that blows throug.h my cell
in prison'

47
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,635
WonderFul! Winds in prison!

48
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:18,033
By the way, what were
you imprisoned for?

49
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:28,206
How much of sugar in your coffee?
- Don't you know?

50
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:33,804
Sure, l do. But all that poety
must have leR a bitter taste.

51
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,667
Three and half spoons for him!

52
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:38,733
Go on, Somu.

53
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,669
''Your ears hear my heart-beat...''

54
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,801
''as if it were a chain
unshackled...''

55
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:48,871
''or one that separated me

56
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,469
''The shackles forget...
l'm already one with you''

57
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,600
''l'm away from these cells''

58
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,034
''For, l have been released''

59
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:02,003
May l look for my release now?
- All right. Go ahead.

60
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:15,470
l can't figure out how a clown like
you can write such nice poety.

61
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,167
l can't either!

62
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:25,069
You've called so late.
l've been waiting.

63
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,269
How are you?
- First class. What are you doing?

64
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,634
Listening to Somu's
new set of poety.

65
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:34,570
Really? Let me talk to him.
- Yes, just a moment.

66
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:39,933
Well, punk? What are you doing
at my place at this hour?

67
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:48,337
l'm playing watchman.
You have a young and beautiful wife.

68
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,438
l'd be blamed, if she were kidnapped.
So l'm keeping watch.

69
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:56,201
Keep watch, all right. But what's
all the poety for?

70
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,902
lt's part ofthe new book
l've written.

71
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,168
Really? Recite some for me.

72
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:05,570
l recite poety over the telephone
only for girls!

73
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,867
What's my daughter doing?

74
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:12,469
Neha? She's asleep.
- l haven't yet slept, papa!

75
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:18,703
How can Uncle Somu's poety
ever put someone to sleep?

76
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,369
Where are you today, papa?
- l'm in Bhopal, dear.

77
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,636
When are you returning?
- l'm leaving this place tomorrow.

78
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,634
l'll spend a day in Lucknow
and join you aRer that.

79
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,934
Promise. Go to sleep now.

80
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,436
We can't find a better site than this
for a TV station in Lucknow.

81
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:42,533
What do you think, Mr Anand?
- Give it a serious thought.

82
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,605
Won't a 300-feet iron tower ruin
the beauty ofthis historical site?

83
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:55,437
This site falls in the minister's
constituency. He himself chose it.

84
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,569
ln that case, it must never
be built. l refuse permission.

85
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,670
There's another site behind the hill.
That might hide the tower.

86
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,668
Sory, it's time for my train.

87
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,235
lt has to do with the minister.
We might lose ourjobs.

88
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:15,636
We can go straight to the station

89
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:19,402
Well, let's go.

90
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,102
You reached safely, l hope?
You didn't take ill, did you?

91
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:37,001
How's the hotel?
- Evemhing is all right.

92
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,801
Why were you so late in
picking up the phone?

93
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:42,868
l was in the bath.
- Have you dressed?

94
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,201
Not yet.
- And how are you looking?

95
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,868
You'll get a beating, Anand!

96
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:57,003
l might spend 3 days more.
- Why? You went there for a day!

97
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,469
There are some changes in the design
and l've called Kailash here.

98
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,300
All right.

99
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,601
Where's Neha?
- She's playing outside. Wait...

100
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,901
What is it, mom?

101
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,334
lt's papa calling.

102
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:37,004
Don't get me that big
bunny rabbit l asked you for.

103
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:40,202
Auntie gave it to me just now.

104
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,534
l see. Which auntie is that?

105
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:48,371
She's a nice lady. She said she'd
get me many more toys.

106
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,401
Come back soon, papa.

107
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,970
Bye. l'm going to teach
Monu some cycling.

108
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:01,369
Who was it?
- l couldn't see her.

109
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:05,870
l just saw a car leaving.
Must've been Mrs Malhotra.

110
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:09,769
She's been distributing toys
ever since she's lost her child.

111
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:13,069
Tell Neha not to accept toys

112
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:18,769
Anything else?
- Say ''l love you''.

113
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:30,869
Don't be scared. l'll help you.

114
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,703
Didn't Mrs Malhotra
give you this, dear?

115
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,001
No.
- Then who did?

116
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:45,271
l didn't ask her name.
- Was she a friend of mine?

117
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,803
How would l know?
You have so many friends.

118
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:53,503
Have you seen her earlier?
- You talk so much, don't you?

119
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,501
l've got to teach Monu cycling.

120
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:29,337
You're late, dear. Where were you?
- l was showing Junmun my doll.

121
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,068
lt's such a cute doll.
It even talks..

122
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,103
l see. Whose is it?
- Mine. Auntie gave it to me.

123
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,837
Which auntie?
- The one who gave me the bunny.

124
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:45,203
Does she even come to the school?
- Yes. Evey day.

125
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:53,633
How are you, Mrs Kishore?

126
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:58,735
Neha says a woman comes
to meet her at school.

127
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,668
You mean Nandita Roy, don't you?
Isn't she your relative?

128
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,835
Nandita Roy? l don't even
know of such a person!

129
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:13,170
But Neha appears to like her.
- Neha is a kid!

130
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,202
How can you allow her to
meet any stranger?

131
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:20,236
Let's go, mom. l've got to change
and leave for my dance-classes!

132
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:25,036
Please don't let Neha meet
anyone without my permission.

133
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,200
Look, dear. You mustn't ever
accept toys from a stranger.

134
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,869
But l know her!
- Do you?

135
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:33,735
How's she to look at?
- Vey nice.

136
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:39,104
How does she arrive?
- In a car. She has a big white car.

137
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:45,036
Does she bring toys for eveyone?
Or is it only for you?

138
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,836
She's my aunt! Why must she
bring toys for the other kids?

139
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,602
What does she talk about?
- Evemhing.

140
00:17:55,733 --> 00:18:01,205
She talks about my friends,
about what my papa does,...

141
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:06,537
about who helps me with my homework
and Ram Dulare's antics, too.

142
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,636
Want a chocolate, little doll?

143
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,067
What are you cying for?

144
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:27,270
Stop cying, dear.
- l didn't do any mischief, papa...

145
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,537
and yet, Mom scolded me
and broke my doll.

146
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,270
Mom is terrible! l'm not
going to talk to her!

147
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:40,870
You're a big girl now...
and you cy! What a shame!

148
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:45,437
Give your mom the telephone.
l'll scold her, too.

149
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,935
Make sure it's a nice scolding!

150
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:51,903
Ask her to take me to
my dance classes.

151
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:58,437
Of course l'll take you, dear.
Go and get ready.

152
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,801
What happened, love?
She sounded vey upset.

153
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,635
Do you know of any Nandita Roy?

154
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,870
l surely must.
If she's young and beautiful.

155
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,834
Do you know her?

156
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,702
Who is she?
- l don't know.

157
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,702
But she keeps meeting Neha,
and buys her expensive toys.

158
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:27,502
The principal took her for a friend
of mine and allowed them to meet.

159
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,504
Remember the lady who gave Neha
a toy when you were away in Calcutta?

160
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,703
l thought it was Mrs Malhotra.
But it was this woman!

161
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:41,436
Who could it be?
And why is she aRer my child?

162
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:42,166
Nothing to wory about, dear.
You're simply over-reacting.

163
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:50,369
Maybe it's an old friend
who's tying to surprise us.

164
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:53,135
We'll soon know.
Don't wory.

165
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,268
When are you returning?
- The day aRer.

166
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,435
Deciding on the site
is taking up my time.

167
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,069
What's up?
- My book is out in the market.

168
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,002
l must get the sales started.
- So go ahead.

169
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:41,304
How can l start the sales
till you buy the first book?

170
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:45,270
All right. l'll come over tomorrow.
- The book store is nearby.

171
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,002
We can return in 15 minutes.
- But how about Neha?

172
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,334
We'll return before
her class is over.

173
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,402
All right. Ask the watchman
to look aRer Neha.

174
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,001
You write vey well.

175
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,568
This is for you.

176
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,871
We're getting late, Somu.
You can get back for this.

177
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:52,202
l can't understand
why women chase poets.

178
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,237
You're wrong! My experience
has been quite the opposite!

179
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,136
l've always chased a woman...
but l couldn't get hold of her.

180
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,835
Why don't you find a nice girl
and mary her?

181
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:06,468
Really? You should have
told me that earlier.

182
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:10,599
Will you mary me?
- What?!

183
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,602
l'd be grateful to you...
please mary me!

184
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,969
Are you mad?
- No. l'm a poet.

185
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:21,134
l've even had a book published!

186
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:25,835
C'mon. Or Neha will be all alone.

187
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:37,702
l told you we'd be late.
Neha must be so worried.

188
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,035
Where are the kids?
- They've leR.

189
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,968
How about Neha?
- She has leR too.

190
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,134
Her aunt was here to collect her.

191
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:52,968
ldiot! l told you not to
Iet her go with anyone!

192
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:59,636
Have you seen a little girl pass by?
- No. We haven't.

193
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,634
He's in Room 405.

194
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,468
Call him out ofthe
conference room!

195
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,702
Relax, Kavita! Have you gone mad?
Here... talk to Anand.

196
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:06,769
lt's my mistake, Anand...
l've lost Neha!

197
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:12,336
l'll call the DCP right away.
Yes, immediately!

198
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:24,634
When's the next flight to Delhi?
- At l in the morning.

199
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,067
Please have a ticket
booked for me.

200
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,135
Alert the airport, the railway
stations and other exits.

201
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:34,335
There's this 5-year old kid, Neha,
and a woman...

202
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:40,003
Where could she have taken Neha?
- Nowhere, Neha. Just relax!

203
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:42,935
l'd die if something
happened to Neha!

204
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,268
We want Neha's pictures
for television.

205
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:57,734
We'll send copies
at evey station.

206
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:02,636
Please come with me, Mr Somdutt.
Let's meet Neha's principal.

207
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,567
She can describe the woman.

208
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,967
My child!

209
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,235
Let me go, mom...
My horse'll escape!

210
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,502
Where had you been, dear?
- Nowhere.

211
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:44,303
Then how did you get home?
- There was this lady in the car.

212
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:46,201
That nice aunt dropped me!

213
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,268
Where is she?
- She went away.

214
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:54,071
l tried to stop her and offered
her a cup oftea. She refused.

215
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:00,769
She said she didn't like tea.
l said that was no problem!

216
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:02,633
l'll take it.

217
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,233
Are you okay, dear?

218
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,469
One moment, sir.
l'll call your wife.

219
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,002
She has returned.
- Where did you find her?

220
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:22,066
She was here at home.
That woman dropped her.

221
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:27,802
l can't understand why she's
doing all this!

222
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,502
Strange... is Neha okay?
- Yes.

223
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:33,301
Give her the phone.
- Talk to your papa.

224
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:38,168
How's my little girl?
- l'm absolutely all right!

225
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:44,237
You mustn't accept giRs or go
away with strangers, my dear.

226
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:49,404
But l went nowhere! It was mom
who went out with Uncle Somu!

227
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,271
Aunt brought me home aRer
my classes were over.

228
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,170
You should've waited for mom.
- l did.

229
00:26:58,666 --> 00:26:58,666
Even aRer all the kids had leR!

230
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:06,137
Now listen; you will not go with
Nandita auntie again, okay?

231
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:12,504
What if she comes with me?
- Well... give your mom the phone.

232
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,167
Neha seems to be all right.

233
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,736
Could l stay here for another day?
l could deal with all my work.

234
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,237
What does this woman want?
Why's she ruining our lives?

235
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:44,403
How can you say such things, darling?
She can't do a thing, you know.

236
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,803
We have set the cops aRer her.
She'll be exposed soon.

237
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:53,901
You and Neha mean the world to me.

238
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,434
You mean the world to me, too.

239
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,134
No one can ever break our love.

240
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,769
Not that car, Kavita!
The brakes aren't working!

241
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,101
Listen...!

242
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,437
l'm sory, Mr Anand Kishore.
We couldn't save the baby.

243
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:26,738
Have you had a nightmare, mom?
- Yes, dear!

244
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:33,967
Go to sleep, dear.

245
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,471
l can't understand why she brought
Neha home, if she had kidnapped her.

246
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:43,601
Don't wory.

247
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:47,303
The principal and Ram Dulare
have given us a description.

248
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:49,901
We have alerted all the
police stations.

249
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,236
We could even have a guard on duty
to keep a watch on Neha.

250
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,770
Let me go to school, mom!
l'm bored stiff!

251
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,137
Play here today, my dear.
- Whom will l play with?

252
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,036
All my friends have gone to school!
- Don't be stubborn, dear.

253
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,401
Why're you so scared?
Let her go to school.

254
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:13,768
l'm waiting for Anand to return.

255
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:16,268
Go on, dear. Playwith Ram Dulare.

256
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,204
Looks like you have no faith
in the police force.

257
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:33,537
That's not true. It's just
that Anand is not around and...

258
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,633
l understand.

259
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:43,236
Please don't wory.
Nothing will happen to Neha.

260
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,536
lt's you she went to.
She must be in her room.

261
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,136
But she isn't in her room.
- What are you talking about?!

262
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:04,267
Stop the Commissioner!

263
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,401
Wait, Mr Commissioner!

264
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,601
My child!

265
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:42,967
l'm here!

266
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,037
Who are you? Why do you
keep meeting my daughter?

267
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:25,067
Why do you give her the toys?
Why do you go to her school?

268
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:32,572
You have made our lives miserable!
Do you want to kidnap her?

269
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:43,802
Nandita Rai...
isn't that your name?

270
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,502
Who the hell are you?

271
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:52,367
l'm her mother.

272
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,168
Neha is my daughter.

273
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,269
Your daughter...?!
- Yes.

274
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:16,204
l have borne the child
you are mother to.

275
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,601
Give it another thought, Kavita.

276
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:45,669
l don't really need a child.
l can live with your support.

277
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:51,671
l know. l've drawn strength from
your love to take this decision.

278
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,968
When will she start walking?

279
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,471
She's just a week old.
- My friend's in a hury.

280
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:17,870
You'd better give the baby the
car-keys. She'll drive us home!

281
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:35,507
l haven't come to take Neha back.
She belongs to you. And always will.

282
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,070
lt's just that l came to
take a look at her.

283
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:48,702
l'm sory. l've caused you
a lot of inconvenience.

284
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:52,302
How am l to believe that you
are indeed Neha's mother?

285
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:58,536
l have no evidence to prove it.

286
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:00,734
But... Iook into my eyes!

287
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:05,670
Don't believe me,
if my eyes seem to be lying.

288
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:13,238
Why've you been meeting her secretly?
Why didn't you come out in the open?

289
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:22,237
l was scared that you
might misunderstand me.

290
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:28,604
l had planned on going back
aRer having met her once.

291
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,136
l don't know what stopped me.

292
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:39,570
Perhaps it was my feeling of
motherhood, perhaps selfishness.

293
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,001
Or the sense of belonging.

294
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:50,537
Do not wory. l will go away
as suddenly as l came.

295
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:02,901
When Neha grows up,...

296
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,270
she might not even remember
having met someone like me.

297
00:42:10,566 --> 00:42:12,034
You mustn't tell her either.

298
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,038
l know, l have caused you a
Iot of harassment.

299
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,669
And believe me, l'd never have
come to your house.

300
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:27,235
But l'm returning tomorrow.

301
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:33,004
And l wanted to see Neha
one last time.

302
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:42,435
l've been so rude to you.

303
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:47,535
l liked whatever you said.

304
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:53,236
Neha's lucky to have found
a mother like you.

305
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:58,135
But she loves her papa more.

306
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:02,002
He must be better than you then.
- l think so too.

307
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:05,266
Let's take auntie home.
l'll show her all my toys!

308
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:13,671
You invite her, dear.
- Some other day, okay?

309
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:17,735
No! Come with us right now!
We live close-by.

310
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,871
Do come. You leR without even
a cup oftea the other day.

311
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,267
Commissioner! Wait...

312
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,601
Ramu?
- The kid has disappeared!

313
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:45,034
Where's Neha?
- We've found her.

314
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:46,935
lt's okay. She was playing
in the park nearby.

315
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,436
There! She was here and l was
Iooking for her all over!

316
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,134
l spilt all the milk running aRer
the commissioner!

317
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:54,868
l'll fetch some more.
- Get some tea and biscuits too.

318
00:43:56,633 --> 00:43:59,402
How did it all happen?
- You won't believe it.

319
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:04,737
This is Kittu. A dim doll.
She soils all her clothes!

320
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:11,469
Papa got this for me.
Her name is Barbara.

321
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,903
How could you believe her?
You don't know these gangsters!

322
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,102
She can never deceive my eyes.
Look at them.

323
00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:23,170
This is a nice doll!
- Like your Papa, eh?

324
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:29,104
That isn't Papa. Papa's away making
a huge building in Bangalore.

325
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:32,436
So who's that?
- Somu Uncle!

326
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:35,466
Now here's your milk... have it.
l'll play donkey for you.

327
00:44:39,766 --> 00:44:42,034
No thank you! l hate milk!

328
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:42,533
Do you like chocolate then?
- Vey much!

329
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,637
So my little darling will
have chocolate today!

330
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:56,671
Don't you have a daughter?
- l do. She's just like you.

331
00:44:57,966 --> 00:44:57,966
And where is she?
- Here. In my lap.

332
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:05,703
But my name is Neha!
- My daughter's name is Neha too.

333
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:10,304
Really? But why are you cying?

334
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,171
Caught you! My mom cries sometimes
when she's hugging me too.

335
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,837
You're a sweet girl.
- l like you too.

336
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,969
Tea is served, madam.
Anything else?

337
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:40,671
l'll see you in the evening tomorrow.
It's my day off, you know.

338
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:47,767
What will you have?
- Black coffee.

339
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:53,537
l forgot to introduce you to Somu.
- l already know him.

340
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:58,704
Do you really know me?
- Yes. Neha told me evemhing.

341
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,135
But there's something
l didn't tell you.

342
00:46:03,733 --> 00:46:06,902
l just can't understand
his poety!

343
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:11,535
Where are you put up, Nandita?
- At the Radisson.

344
00:46:13,966 --> 00:46:16,702
Offer me some!
- Help yourself, dear!

345
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:22,835
l have a request, Kavita.
- Yes?

346
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,601
My train leaves tomorrow morning.

347
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:31,070
lf it isn't a problem,
could Neha and l spend...

348
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,037
l won't send her to the hotel.
But you can stay here tonight.

349
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:40,969
Anand's arriving tomorrow.
You can meet him too.

350
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:48,503
l'll sleep with you tonight!
You must tell me a stoy!

351
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:49,666
Why don't you call the hotel.

352
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:54,735
Somu'll pick up your luggage. And
you can go straight to the station.

353
00:46:56,966 --> 00:46:56,966
Let's play a computer game, auntie!

354
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,567
- Sure.

355
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:10,904
lsn't it strange?
Neha hardly knows Nandita...

356
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,635
but she's so comfortable

357
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:20,935
She's her mother, Somu.

358
00:47:22,866 --> 00:47:25,201
The two ofyou have
gone crazy!

359
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,770
She couldn't have known who
has adopted her daughter!

360
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:30,701
We have vey strict
adoption laws!

361
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:34,036
l wouldn't know about all that.
Ask her whatever you want to.

362
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:49,202
l'll be back soon.
- Where are you going?

363
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,468
To the Raddisson.
To pick up Nandita's luggage.

364
00:47:52,466 --> 00:47:56,002
ls she here then?
- Yes. They're waiting for you.

365
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,569
What was Somu talking about?
Why did you allow her to stay here?

366
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:12,402
Why don't you meet her, Anand?
- Why must l?

367
00:48:12,466 --> 00:48:15,735
How do you know what she wants?
l think she's an impostor!

368
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,234
Where is she?
And where is Neha?

369
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:30,104
Wash your hands, dim girl!
Hury up!

370
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:19,701
Help!

371
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,134
Leave her alone!

372
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,167
Rip him apart!

373
00:53:02,633 --> 00:53:05,168
Let me make your plaits!
- No!

374
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:10,866
Sit down! Or l'll have
your hair cut short!

375
00:53:13,766 --> 00:53:18,036
No way! Auntie says
l have vey nice hair.

376
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,269
Here l am.
Your check-out is over.

377
00:53:26,366 --> 00:53:29,969
Could l now have 20 rupees and
15 paise for my services? Cash!

378
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,036
All right. l'll forget the 20 Rupees
for your beautiful smile.

379
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,534
But give me 15 paise!

380
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,803
Watch it, Somu. You need a
chance to start flirting.

381
00:53:41,066 --> 00:53:44,402
Drop Neha at school, will you?
- No! l'll go with Papa!

382
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,770
You must come along too, Auntie!
- She's going to the station, Neha.

383
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,102
When will you come again?
- Some time again.

384
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,969
Good! We'll visit the zoo then!

385
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:11,404
Papa will now say
''l've forgotten the keys...''

386
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:17,271
He'll go and give mom a kiss
and return with the keys.

387
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:28,102
You've forgotten the keys, right?

388
00:54:32,766 --> 00:54:33,666
No, dear.

389
00:54:50,066 --> 00:54:53,903
Neha's a lucky girl.
Anand is a nice person.

390
00:55:01,266 --> 00:55:04,602
What's up, papa?
You're forgetting evemhing!

391
00:55:07,866 --> 00:55:13,404
Know what, Papa? Auntie has
a Neha just like me!

392
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,471
Really? Who else does she have?
- l didn't ask.

393
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,004
Do you like auntie?
- Vey much!

394
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,904
The first edition is sold out.
The second one is now in print.

395
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:36,166
That's just how lucky l am.
You haven't worked any wonders.

396
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:42,569
Know what the title
of my new book is?

397
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:44,834
What is it?
- ''Mother''.

398
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,267
The project papers
have arrived, sir.

399
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:02,039
Cancel my meeting for this morning.
l'll be late in reaching the office.

400
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:08,135
Could you find out ifthe train
to Banaras is on time, Anand?

401
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:13,204
lf it's late, l'm afraid Somu will
drive Nandita crazy with his poety!

402
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:15,033
Do you have an allergy to poety?

403
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:15,934
Not at all.

404
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:21,667
ls the train to Banaras on time?

405
00:56:35,866 --> 00:56:37,334
lt's late by mo hours.

406
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,436
l will recite my new poems then.
- Let her finish her breakfast!

407
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:55,635
What's up?
- Nothing at all.

408
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,901
Don't lie. You get caught.

409
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,569
You haven't even looked at me
since you've arrived.

410
00:57:06,866 --> 00:57:09,835
Were you taken aback
to see Nandita here?

411
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:16,838
Strange ironies of life.
l wonder how she feels.

412
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:25,137
Has she given you her address?
- She doesn't want to.

413
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,970
She said she's happy to see Neha
here and won't come back again.

414
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:35,869
You're attending the meeting
with Mr Bansal, aren't you, sir?

415
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:37,934
l told you l'd be late.

416
00:57:38,466 --> 00:57:40,734
Ask them to leave,
ifthey can't wait!

417
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:53,003
What's wrong?
You're okay, aren't you?

418
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,834
Tired?

419
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:04,069
You didn't like my allowing
her to stay here, did you?

420
00:58:04,766 --> 00:58:08,369
She's leaving, Anand.
And l wanted you to meet her once.

421
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:14,002
All right. l'll dress up
and come downstairs.

422
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:20,002
l could drop her at the station
on my way to the office.

423
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:24,302
Okay. But don't ask her
awkward questions.

424
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:27,035
l don't know what she's
is going through.

425
00:58:29,366 --> 00:58:33,036
You stay away for so many days...
don't you ever miss me?

426
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:36,267
Liar!

427
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:52,236
That's the number.
Make an enquiy again.

428
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:55,168
Once the train is delayed, there's
no saying when it'll leave.

429
00:58:55,266 --> 00:58:58,002
ln that case, you'll have to
drop her at the station, Somu.

430
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,804
lt leR at 1 1 .05 a.m.
- Wasn't it late by 2 hours?

431
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:12,804
No, ma'am. It was right on time.
And it has leR.

432
00:59:16,866 --> 00:59:18,968
lt's delayed by mo more hours.

433
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,835
And perhaps...
- It might even be cancelled!

434
00:59:23,566 --> 00:59:26,235
l suggest you cancel your trip today.

435
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:31,036
Somu's right. Why don't you
stay back today?

436
00:59:32,766 --> 00:59:36,102
Don't be formal!
You're not leaving today.

437
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:40,770
l'll show you the city and we'll have
a pam at my place this evening.

438
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:44,769
That's enough, prince. Won't you
ask Nandita what she wants?

439
00:59:45,866 --> 00:59:50,203
l know the city. But l might as
well buy some books, since l'm here.

440
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:52,935
Vey well. l'll take you
to the Popular book house.

441
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,402
You'll find my book there!

442
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,534
l'm leaving for the office.

443
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:07,767
Aren't you forgetting something?

444
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:25,470
What a coincidence! l gave Kavita
the first copy ofthis edition...

445
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,969
and l'm giRing to you
the last copy!

446
01:00:29,566 --> 01:00:31,467
We have another copy, sir.

447
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,301
For you.

448
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:40,968
When is your next book arriving?
- Soon.

449
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,771
Have you read ''Dil Kya Kare'' ?
- Sure. Your love-poems are great.

450
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:17,433
You?

451
01:01:19,033 --> 01:01:26,373
Sory... did l startle you?
- No. l expected to meet you here.

452
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,134
Please sit down.

453
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:50,669
Without sugar.
- The same for me.

454
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:00,966
l don't know...

455
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,501
where to begin from.

456
01:02:09,466 --> 01:02:13,870
Forgive me for lying
about the train.

457
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:19,004
l had so many questions to ask,
when l saw you again.

458
01:02:19,766 --> 01:02:21,601
l wanted to talk to you too.

459
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:31,673
This kid... Neha...?
- You're right. She's our child.

460
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,103
But you never did...
Didn't you...

461
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:47,770
No. l didn't get married.

462
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,569
Anand! What are you doing here?

463
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:57,137
l thought l'd buy your book
and encourage you.

464
01:02:57,666 --> 01:03:01,202
l happened to meet her here.
- Don't fib! You? And books?

465
01:03:01,266 --> 01:03:05,036
lf l didn't know you so well,
l'd have suspected something fishy!

466
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:08,235
l think something is fishy

467
01:03:08,466 --> 01:03:13,437
Excuse me... will someone ask me
if something is indeed fishy?

468
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,734
Look, sir.
- Show me the original plan.

469
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:28,070
You have just 4 elevators in such
a huge building. l had planned 6.

470
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:32,169
The beam width is narrow and you have
altered the site's elevation too.

471
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:36,233
This won't do.

472
01:03:40,366 --> 01:03:41,133
l had warned you.

473
01:03:45,866 --> 01:03:49,102
Tomorrow's flight is confirmed, sir.
- Flight? Where to?

474
01:03:50,366 --> 01:03:52,134
To Calcutta. You have a meeting
with the Bansal's, sir.

475
01:03:52,266 --> 01:03:57,237
Cancel the meeting.
- But you said it was important.

476
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:02,003
Fix it up for next week instead.
- Vey well, sir.

477
01:04:46,366 --> 01:04:48,201
ldiot! Why must you call
and not speak?

478
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:09,435
Could you take the call, please?

479
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:22,302
l'm waiting for you
at the old fort.

480
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:54,269
Why have you stopped?
- l'm scared.

481
01:05:55,466 --> 01:05:56,733
But why?
- l don't know.

482
01:10:44,966 --> 01:10:46,367
Are they all here?
- Yes, sir.

483
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,501
''Only fools and asses
work on Sundays''

484
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,301
C'mon, asses. To the boardroom.

485
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,168
At least spare us on Sundays!

486
01:11:00,266 --> 01:11:03,936
Sure l would. Ifyou worked
the rest ofthe days.

487
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:04,766
l've just been married. At this
rate, my wife will divorce me.

488
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:11,802
l'll have you married again.
Give Kunal the report.

489
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:13,001
l've got to complete
the summay.

490
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,602
Complete it now.
l must ship it this evening.

491
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:25,136
l'm at the market... who else
is coming to Somu's place?

492
01:11:25,899 --> 01:11:30,070
The lab. area ought to be here.
Their fax says it must be over here.

493
01:11:30,566 --> 01:11:32,034
l'm listening.

494
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:32,133
l'm cooking some veg. fare.
Do you want some non-veg. too?

495
01:11:34,699 --> 01:11:38,470
Let's have something attractive
in such a beautiful building!

496
01:11:40,066 --> 01:11:42,401
Know what? Ask Somu.

497
01:11:45,466 --> 01:11:47,367
And you guys think something
for the wings.

498
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:50,001
Think ofwhat?
- Who's that?

499
01:11:50,366 --> 01:11:54,970
Ram Dulare here, sir! l'm shopping
for the pam at Mr Somu's!

500
01:11:55,233 --> 01:12:00,471
Do we use a concrete slab here?
- The chickens here are not good.

501
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:05,203
Let's use stones instead.
- But how will l fy the stones?

502
01:12:05,733 --> 01:12:08,469
This will take all day!
My wife's gonna leave me!

503
01:12:09,566 --> 01:12:11,301
A call from your house, sir.

504
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:15,034
What dress must l wear
this evening, papa?

505
01:12:15,133 --> 01:12:17,101
This marble at the reception
doesn't go well, Anand.

506
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,768
Wear that pink dress, dear.

507
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:24,037
Limestone would be a good choice.
- l have 4 pink dresses...

508
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,368
which one do l wear?
Tell me, papa!

509
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:33,171
Well? Marble or limestone?
- Mutton or chicken, sir?

510
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,835
Tell me what dress
l must wear, papa!

511
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:37,368
We're wasting so much oftime...
my divorce is a certainty.

512
01:12:40,466 --> 01:12:43,502
Taka ofJapan is waiting for
my report in Bangalore...

513
01:12:44,233 --> 01:12:45,767
and here l am!
Busywith chicken and mutton!

514
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:49,701
No! l'm not going to eat!

515
01:12:54,899 --> 01:13:00,639
You're right. You're happy as long
as you're single and independent.

516
01:13:01,466 --> 01:13:04,435
Sour grapes, mister. You'll know
when you get married.

517
01:13:05,233 --> 01:13:08,269
May l ask you something if
it's not too personal?

518
01:13:09,366 --> 01:13:11,401
Why didn't you get married?

519
01:13:14,966 --> 01:13:20,504
Well... it was my circumstances
and destiny, l guess.

520
01:13:22,266 --> 01:13:24,101
lt isn't easy for a woman
to live like this.

521
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:30,171
Didn't you ever ty?
- l did.

522
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:34,170
But someone's memories always
stopped me from going ahead.

523
01:13:36,766 --> 01:13:38,667
l think you're hiding something.

524
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,835
She must have her constraints.

525
01:13:43,133 --> 01:13:46,803
That's the problem. Constraints
are only for women.

526
01:13:47,133 --> 01:13:50,803
As ifthe man would consider
what Nandita has gone through.

527
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:57,237
Didn't you ever meet that chap?
- l did.

528
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,903
What did he have to say?
- l didn't ask.

529
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,467
Why not?

530
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:08,170
He has a beautiful world of his own.
And he's happy too.

531
01:14:08,766 --> 01:14:12,669
And there's no place for you
in that world, right?

532
01:14:15,933 --> 01:14:19,836
lt's the same old stoy.
- Men! They are irresponsible!

533
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:25,202
The man must perhaps
have blundered...

534
01:14:25,666 --> 01:14:27,768
and never got the opportunity
to make up for it.

535
01:14:27,866 --> 01:14:29,968
He wouldn't, even if he
had the opportunity!

536
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:35,037
What would you do if a woman
turns up with a 5-year old kid...

537
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,236
and says it's the offspring
ofyour relations?

538
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:40,435
Will you throw out your wife
and kid, and invite her in?

539
01:14:40,533 --> 01:14:44,370
Maintaining relations is difficult.
Forging them isn't.

540
01:14:45,866 --> 01:14:48,835
But l have nothing against him.

541
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:49,666
lt all happened in
the spur ofthe moment.

542
01:14:52,233 --> 01:14:54,335
You can't have a baby in the
spur ofthe moment, Nandita.

543
01:14:56,466 --> 01:15:00,069
You're magnanimous. But l could
never forgive such a man.

544
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:03,702
Okay, don't forgive him.
But what ice-cream will you have?

545
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,336
l'll have dad's share!
- Sure.

546
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:14,637
You haven't shown Nandita your
collection of paintings, Somu.

547
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:17,569
l would, ifyou allowed me to.

548
01:15:23,066 --> 01:15:24,834
This is a 200-hundred
year old painting.

549
01:15:29,633 --> 01:15:34,604
Look at the texture...
the smile, the eyes...

550
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:38,069
The pain l see in her eyes,
l see in your eyes, too.

551
01:15:38,766 --> 01:15:40,667
Do l look 200 years old to you?

552
01:15:42,066 --> 01:15:45,969
l mean... an_ay, what do
you think of my poems?

553
01:15:47,966 --> 01:15:51,569
They're vey good.
Anand is a lucky man.

554
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:54,435
Let's go out, papa.
l want to see the stars.

555
01:16:00,766 --> 01:16:05,737
Which stars do you want to see?
- Those red, green...

556
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,269
What happened?
- Well, she saw my paintings...

557
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,068
And?
- And read my poety.

558
01:16:13,566 --> 01:16:16,902
And what else?
- And? Well...

559
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:19,201
l understand!
You can't do anything!

560
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,069
No matter how much l help,
you'll remain an idiot, Somu!

561
01:16:25,533 --> 01:16:29,870
You're being funny!
What do you want me to do?

562
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,202
Grab her hand and
pop the question?

563
01:16:34,666 --> 01:16:37,335
Such a nice girl is
not foryou, Somu.

564
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,501
l've set a record in
missing out on nice girls.

565
01:16:42,866 --> 01:16:44,100
l haven't been joking!

566
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,402
Look how happy Neha is.

567
01:16:48,933 --> 01:16:51,535
Mary Nandita.
You'll be a happy man.

568
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:02,201
C'mon in, dear!
You'll catch a cold.

569
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:06,735
Hury up... C'mon!

570
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:14,969
l'm thinking of returning by
tomorrow morning's train.

571
01:17:19,066 --> 01:17:21,902
Can't you stay for
a few more days?

572
01:17:23,866 --> 01:17:27,636
The more l stay, the more difficult
it will be to go away.

573
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:33,536
Will going away make
things easier?

574
01:17:37,566 --> 01:17:39,467
You went away without
a word last time.

575
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:44,367
Do not make haste now.

576
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:10,168
Have you seen these
new drawings, Anand?

577
01:23:11,433 --> 01:23:14,068
Why? What's wrong?

578
01:23:16,966 --> 01:23:16,966
You must study the
American building.

579
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,070
You're looking at the VCD plant
which is half complete.

580
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:28,803
My mind was elsewhere.
- l can see that.

581
01:23:28,899 --> 01:23:33,004
An_ay, go through the designs.
The Ambani's are expected at four.

582
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,068
Can't we cancel the meeting?
- Why? What's wrong?

583
01:23:38,566 --> 01:23:39,800
Nothing much...

584
01:23:43,533 --> 01:23:46,502
Send Nandita in...
- Nandita?

585
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,771
No, Neha... not me!
l'll tell you a stoy!

586
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,102
l can hear you, Neha!

587
01:24:29,366 --> 01:24:32,135
But l wasn't even playing with you.
- But you've been caught!

588
01:24:41,866 --> 01:24:46,036
You folks are still playing here!
Aren't we going to the pam?

589
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:49,502
What pam?
- Have you forgotten?

590
01:24:50,133 --> 01:24:51,567
lt's the annual bash at
the Jodhpur palace.

591
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,834
Which dress do l wear, uncle?

592
01:24:54,899 --> 01:24:57,435
You can't go there, dear.
It's only for grown-ups.

593
01:24:59,033 --> 01:25:02,202
Such spoil-sports! Why don't
they call kids too?

594
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:06,668
Go ahead, all ofyou.
l'll stay back with Neha.

595
01:25:07,466 --> 01:25:10,502
Yes! We'll play carrom-board!
- All right. l won't go either.

596
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,202
Why not?
- It's a party for couples.

597
01:25:13,733 --> 01:25:17,069
Go ahead with Kavita.
l'll stay back for a game of carrom.

598
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,469
Take Kavita with you...
l have a headache.

599
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,667
So why didn't you tell me?

600
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:29,136
Oh God! No one will go
to the pam now!

601
01:25:31,066 --> 01:25:32,967
Don't do that, please...

602
01:25:33,066 --> 01:25:36,803
All right. l'm game. Let's see
what parties you have here.

603
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:49,236
Welcome... you're late!

604
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,068
This won't do!
Join them all!

605
01:28:42,933 --> 01:28:47,904
Well? You were certainly
in the mood to dance today!

606
01:28:50,233 --> 01:28:53,269
Remember when you first
danced like that?

607
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,869
ln Bangkok. When we were
on our honeymoon.

608
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,703
Nandita dances well.
l was only accompanying her.

609
01:29:06,666 --> 01:29:09,769
She can't be better than me.
- Really?

610
01:30:43,866 --> 01:30:48,837
What are you up to? l have
my karate classes in the morning!

611
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,967
Tired?

612
01:31:31,266 --> 01:31:34,235
That's what comes out of
dancing with mo girls.

613
01:31:41,466 --> 01:31:42,733
Nandita is a nice girl.

614
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,569
Somu's interested in her...
what do you think?

615
01:31:52,066 --> 01:31:53,467
l could talk to her.

616
01:33:11,366 --> 01:33:12,467
lt's vey cold, isn't it?

617
01:33:19,133 --> 01:33:21,235
Why do you keep
running away from me?

618
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,971
l haven't forgiven myself
for what happened that night.

619
01:33:32,633 --> 01:33:35,102
l must've been out of my senses

620
01:33:36,699 --> 01:33:41,671
l felt so guilty. l had
protected you. And yet...

621
01:33:42,933 --> 01:33:44,167
Please don't say such things.

622
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:48,336
l'm equally responsible
for what happened.

623
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,268
Whenever l have passed the
station of Mogulsarai...

624
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,403
l've looked for you in the
crowds on the platForm.

625
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:06,171
Why did you go away without
saying anything?

626
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:13,468
Had l known this is what
would have happened...

627
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:17,567
l'd never have leR
without talking to you.

628
01:34:21,133 --> 01:34:25,537
l felt that night as if
l had lived many lives.

629
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,037
l'm still not sure whether
that was a dream... or for real.

630
01:34:33,566 --> 01:34:38,103
l felt like waking you up
and talking to you.

631
01:34:38,733 --> 01:34:42,336
But l was afraid, it would
shatter my dream.

632
01:34:42,733 --> 01:34:47,571
l got offthe train at the station
with your memories in my heart.

633
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,568
l was going back home
aRer a year.

634
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,270
My father was vey happy. l had
stood first in the University.

635
01:34:54,966 --> 01:34:57,368
We had a flourishing business
in Banarasi zari.

636
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,568
My daughter is one in a million!

637
01:34:59,899 --> 01:35:02,736
l've been both father
and mother to her.

638
01:35:03,166 --> 01:35:07,203
Fortunate will be the one
who marries her.

639
01:35:07,899 --> 01:35:11,236
There's no hitch in the horoscopes.
- Rahul is returning from London.

640
01:35:11,933 --> 01:35:13,901
So let's fix a date
for the wedding.

641
01:35:14,166 --> 01:35:16,134
The Panchami is an auspicious date.

642
01:36:06,699 --> 01:36:08,868
l felt the ground
slip under my feet.

643
01:36:10,533 --> 01:36:15,504
l felt like leaving evemhing
and go looking for you.

644
01:36:17,033 --> 01:36:18,801
But l couldn't muster
the courage.

645
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:25,137
But l was also afraid
ofwhat l'd say to you...

646
01:36:26,699 --> 01:36:28,968
what ifyou had not
believed me?

647
01:36:29,733 --> 01:36:33,736
How have l lacked in bringing
you up that you are punishing me?

648
01:36:34,766 --> 01:36:37,502
Tell me! Who is responsible
for this sin?

649
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:43,304
l'll fall at his feet and
ask him to mary you! So tell me!

650
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:52,171
l don't know. l really don't!

651
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:56,136
l can't face anyone anymore.

652
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:02,904
When you don't even know him,
why give birth to the baby?

653
01:37:03,566 --> 01:37:07,536
You have a long life ahead.
So let bygones be bygones!

654
01:37:07,899 --> 01:37:08,934
Think ofyour future.

655
01:37:16,466 --> 01:37:19,135
l can't give you the permission
for an abortion.

656
01:37:19,566 --> 01:37:22,535
Nobody would take the risk
aRer all the tests we've done.

657
01:37:30,899 --> 01:37:33,936
l can't give birth to
this baby, doctor...

658
01:37:35,633 --> 01:37:38,969
Only God can prevent its birth.
l can do nothing.

659
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,936
We have only one way now.

660
01:37:53,466 --> 01:37:58,437
lt was a strange predicament.
With Neha in my womb...

661
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:04,437
l kept thinking ofyou.
Evey moment.

662
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:11,470
Where were you? Why weren't

663
01:38:14,066 --> 01:38:17,235
l don't know why,
but l always thought...

664
01:38:20,633 --> 01:38:24,236
that you'd suddenly turn up

665
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:48,171
Now, dear... be brave.

666
01:39:01,966 --> 01:39:05,936
lt's a baby-girl.
- Let me see...

667
01:39:07,366 --> 01:39:09,334
How's she to look at?
- No!

668
01:39:12,166 --> 01:39:15,202
She had promised not to
Iook at the baby!

669
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:27,136
The car is waiting for you.
Come straight to Banaras from Delhi.

670
01:39:30,566 --> 01:39:32,334
l couldn't even see
the baby l had borne.

671
01:39:34,066 --> 01:39:36,535
My father tried to get me
married again.

672
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:42,137
My alliance was even fixed with
a father ofmo in America.

673
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,935
But l couldn't bring myself
about to agree to it.

674
01:39:45,566 --> 01:39:50,537
l joined a University in Australia
and spent 5 years there.

675
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:56,471
l returned when l suddenly
got word of my father's death.

676
01:39:59,066 --> 01:40:04,037
My aunt gave me the address of
the orphanage she had leR Neha in.

677
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:11,337
l had a tough time winning over
the clerk at the orphanage...

678
01:40:12,866 --> 01:40:14,901
and it was she who gave me
your address.

679
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,135
You bore it all alone...?

680
01:40:20,533 --> 01:40:24,003
l was never alone.
You have always been with me.

681
01:40:24,966 --> 01:40:27,234
And look at the games
God plays.

682
01:40:27,966 --> 01:40:31,703
l was separated from Neha...
but she found you.

683
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:40,005
You have gone through a lot.
l have given you nothing.

684
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:48,005
What can l even ask for?
l can return peacefully now.

685
01:40:58,466 --> 01:41:02,336
l want to tell Kavita evemhing.
- Please don't do that.

686
01:41:04,366 --> 01:41:07,035
No one can understand
our relationship.

687
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,068
No woman can ever share
her husband.

688
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:15,771
l don't want to hurt Kavita.
She's a good mother and a wife.

689
01:41:21,833 --> 01:41:26,804
But l... l've been able to
do nothing for you.

690
01:41:29,466 --> 01:41:33,870
But this can't continue...
you must get your due.

691
01:42:15,966 --> 01:42:19,936
What the hell is going on here?

692
01:42:22,833 --> 01:42:25,368
l'll explain evemhing...
- Explain what?!

693
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,901
What were you doing
with that woman?!

694
01:42:29,066 --> 01:42:30,033
Hear me out, Kavita... please.

695
01:42:31,133 --> 01:42:34,035
You can't even imagine what
sorrows Nandita has faced.

696
01:42:35,266 --> 01:42:38,736
So you were wiping her tears
with her in your arms, eh?

697
01:42:38,899 --> 01:42:41,669
l was doing nothing ofthe sort.
Why don't you...

698
01:42:41,833 --> 01:42:45,303
l was a fool not to have
noticed it all these days!

699
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:49,167
''She's a great dancer indeed''

700
01:42:49,633 --> 01:42:52,235
And there you were with her,
before the world...!

701
01:42:56,033 --> 01:42:59,870
l'll deal with you later!
l'll first throw that woman out!

702
01:43:03,666 --> 01:43:07,936
Nandita will certainly leave...
but not like this.

703
01:43:08,466 --> 01:43:09,934
How else then?

704
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:16,303
With due respect.
- Only because she's Neha's mother?

705
01:43:19,966 --> 01:43:24,136
And also because...
l'm Neha's real father.

706
01:43:32,266 --> 01:43:35,736
You've been having an affair
with this woman for six years!

707
01:43:36,966 --> 01:43:39,635
Believe me, Kavita...
we never even met.

708
01:43:39,966 --> 01:43:44,937
l've had enough!
l can't take this anymore!

709
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:54,969
How dare you come
into my bedroom?

710
01:44:00,433 --> 01:44:04,036
l've had a nightmare, mom...
May l sleep with you?

711
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:12,471
Please let me, mom...
l'm terribly scared!

712
01:44:20,666 --> 01:44:23,935
l've had a nightmare, mom...
May l sleep with you?

713
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:43,337
Not anymore! She won't go away...
So l'm walking out!

714
01:44:47,166 --> 01:44:51,570
What are you doing, Kavita?
Please ty to understand!

715
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:53,834
lt was a mistake l made!

716
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,034
Please listen to me...

717
01:45:12,433 --> 01:45:14,668
Anand? What's up?

718
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,335
Let's go, Somu...
- What's all this about?!

719
01:45:18,366 --> 01:45:22,403
Wait, Kavita...
At least listen to me!

720
01:45:23,866 --> 01:45:25,500
What happened?

721
01:45:57,399 --> 01:45:58,567
What a betrayal!

722
01:45:58,899 --> 01:46:02,436
l was a fool to believe
him all these years!

723
01:46:03,533 --> 01:46:09,005
What haven't l done for him?
And what did l get?

724
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:14,169
Get a hold on yourself...
- Why, oh why?!

725
01:46:14,266 --> 01:46:16,434
Was it only because l
couldn't give him a child?!

726
01:46:18,566 --> 01:46:21,402
What a conspiracy
they hatched, Somu!

727
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:25,036
They had a rollicking time
for six years...

728
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:28,603
had a baby and sent it away
to the orphanage!

729
01:46:28,766 --> 01:46:31,735
And l, like an idiot,
had faith in him!

730
01:46:32,766 --> 01:46:35,735
l gave up evemhing for him!

731
01:46:36,066 --> 01:46:39,302
And he snatched evemhing
away from me!

732
01:46:39,899 --> 01:46:43,003
l've loved Neha more than a
mother would. He snatched her too!

733
01:46:50,066 --> 01:46:53,836
He was romancing with that woman,
right under my nose!

734
01:46:54,766 --> 01:46:57,368
And l... it's all my mistake!

735
01:46:57,466 --> 01:47:02,437
But l won't make this mistake again!
l'll leave that man!

736
01:47:02,933 --> 01:47:07,904
l'll never return to that house!
Let him live with that bitch!

737
01:47:18,966 --> 01:47:20,934
Anand? Right now she is...

738
01:47:24,266 --> 01:47:25,800
Give her the phone. Please.

739
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:32,569
At least talk to him.
- My lawyer will talk to him!

740
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:39,204
What more can l do for you?!
- l'm your culprit...

741
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,636
l've made a mistake.
Punish me as you will...

742
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,702
Cut out the dramatics.
You've fooled me enough!

743
01:47:48,033 --> 01:47:53,004
You're vey angy.
But think of Neha.

744
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:54,567
She can't live without you.

745
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:58,169
So you want me to play
the maid in that house?!

746
01:47:58,666 --> 01:48:01,835
What are you talking about?
- l don't want to talk to you!

747
01:48:33,266 --> 01:48:34,300
Do you want to leave?

748
01:48:39,866 --> 01:48:41,968
Staying here hasn't
helped matters.

749
01:48:49,033 --> 01:48:50,934
Don't take offense
at what Kavita said.

750
01:48:52,466 --> 01:48:57,437
ln her shoes, perhaps
l'd also have...

751
01:49:02,466 --> 01:49:03,567
Call her back soon.

752
01:49:11,433 --> 01:49:13,468
What are you talking about?
Are you sure he's the same man?

753
01:49:14,566 --> 01:49:15,967
How can l ever forget him?

754
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:20,470
And how about Neha?
How's she to look at?

755
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:22,868
She's vey sweet.

756
01:49:24,766 --> 01:49:28,669
l remember. She had eyes
just like yours.

757
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,168
Evemhing else
is like Anand's.

758
01:49:35,066 --> 01:49:40,037
l've found happiness of a lifetime
in these few days, auntie.

759
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,671
When l wanted to leave
this morning... my feet froze.

760
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:48,202
l didn't have
the courage to awaken her.

761
01:49:48,899 --> 01:49:53,871
l longed to embrace her
and kiss her one last time.

762
01:49:56,166 --> 01:50:00,403
But what could l have told her?

763
01:50:05,966 --> 01:50:09,202
So l just had an eye-full
and leR.

764
01:50:10,966 --> 01:50:15,136
Didn't Anand ty to stop you?
Had he nothing to say?

765
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:21,770
What would he say?
l can't bear to see his grief.

766
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:25,636
How about your own sorrows?
- What sorrows?

767
01:50:27,233 --> 01:50:31,136
l've found evemhing.
A sweet little daughter...

768
01:50:32,333 --> 01:50:37,304
an angel-like man...
They are vey happy.

769
01:50:37,399 --> 01:50:41,737
Whom are you tying to fool?
What did you get in the end?

770
01:50:43,699 --> 01:50:48,237
Now that you are there...
don't give up evemhing.

771
01:50:48,466 --> 01:50:51,068
You won't get this
opportunity again.

772
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:53,602
Neither will you get your
daughter... nor your man.

773
01:50:53,766 --> 01:50:55,234
How can you say such things, aunt?

774
01:50:56,766 --> 01:51:00,035
l've caused strife in
their happy family.

775
01:51:02,066 --> 01:51:03,801
What ifthat woman doesn't return?

776
01:51:04,399 --> 01:51:06,802
And what if she doesn't
Iove Neha anymore?

777
01:51:07,566 --> 01:51:10,735
Our child will be orphaned.
How will Anand manage on his own?

778
01:51:11,766 --> 01:51:15,002
l'm returning by this
evening's train.

779
01:51:19,699 --> 01:51:24,671
lt's all my mistake.
Hadn't l given in to your father...

780
01:51:25,833 --> 01:51:28,101
Neha would have been
with you today.

781
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:31,468
l have sinned!

782
01:51:32,899 --> 01:51:37,871
Do not curse yourself, aunt...
perhaps it's all in my destiny.

783
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:43,469
l wish l could see Neha once.

784
01:51:59,966 --> 01:52:02,802
Get Mummy!

785
01:52:02,899 --> 01:52:04,668
Do you want anything, sir?
- Nothing.

786
01:52:05,966 --> 01:52:10,937
l'll help Neha dress up today.
- And who'll help you?

787
01:52:11,666 --> 01:52:11,666
l'll dress up on my own.

788
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:17,070
l see... but do you even know
where your socks are?

789
01:52:17,166 --> 01:52:18,133
l know evemhing.

790
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:19,199
What is this?
- Your uniform.

791
01:52:21,466 --> 01:52:21,466
What day is it today?
- Tuesday.

792
01:52:24,399 --> 01:52:26,668
lt's a day for my
physical training!

793
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:28,334
Want any help, sir?

794
01:52:29,266 --> 01:52:32,435
Help the kid dress up...
l'll prepare the breakfast.

795
01:52:43,533 --> 01:52:47,136
l like my milk cold, Papa!

796
01:52:48,333 --> 01:52:50,601
Don'tjust stand around there!
Help me out!

797
01:52:51,533 --> 01:52:54,636
Problem, sir... you've worn
mo different socks.

798
01:52:56,600 --> 01:53:00,337
Take my advise. Call Mummy!
You don't know a thing!

799
01:53:00,666 --> 01:53:02,434
Yes, call madam back.

800
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:14,167
Whistle with me!

801
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:19,604
Mom fought with you, didn't she?
- Not at all.

802
01:53:20,566 --> 01:53:23,602
Don't lie, Papa!
You always get caught!

803
01:53:24,266 --> 01:53:27,102
Okay... she was vey angy.

804
01:53:28,066 --> 01:53:29,734
Didn't you say ''sory'' ?

805
01:53:30,966 --> 01:53:33,001
She went away before
l could say that, dear.

806
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:39,737
But why was she angy?
- You won't understand, dear.

807
01:53:40,266 --> 01:53:42,668
Of course l will, Papa.
Ty explaining.

808
01:53:48,133 --> 01:53:52,537
Mummy got to know that
Nandita auntie is your mummy.

809
01:53:53,566 --> 01:53:57,836
Auntie? My mummy?
Isn't mummy my mummy then?

810
01:53:58,633 --> 01:54:02,370
Mummy's your second mummy.
- And auntie's my first mummy?

811
01:54:03,233 --> 01:54:08,204
So why has auntie leR?
- l don't know, dear.

812
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,668
She will come back,
won't she?

813
01:54:40,433 --> 01:54:41,901
Call for you, madam.

814
01:54:48,433 --> 01:54:50,101
l have nothing to
discuss with you!

815
01:54:50,366 --> 01:54:52,134
Listen...

816
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:11,470
Chhotu! Hury up and
get me a cup oftea!

817
01:55:16,899 --> 01:55:20,236
We have sunshine aRer ages today.
So let's go out somewhere.

818
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:27,335
l just came over to
your place like this.

819
01:55:28,533 --> 01:55:34,005
l don't want to be a burden or
inconvenience you in any way...

820
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:37,069
Have you had your say?
Or is there anything else?

821
01:55:39,966 --> 01:55:42,301
l want a promise from you, lady.

822
01:55:42,833 --> 01:55:47,637
You will have faith in me and
ty to be vey happy, okay?

823
01:55:48,699 --> 01:55:52,437
l have always been waiting
for you to need me...

824
01:55:52,899 --> 01:55:56,303
so l could make you happy.

825
01:55:59,966 --> 01:56:03,235
l want another promise.
You will not cy anymore.

826
01:56:05,033 --> 01:56:08,136
Come to think of it, those tears
in your eyes do make them beautiful.

827
01:56:10,233 --> 01:56:10,967
All that pain...

828
01:56:13,533 --> 01:56:14,767
There goes the poet
in me again!

829
01:56:15,033 --> 01:56:17,568
But l can't help it.
That's how you are.

830
01:56:21,233 --> 01:56:24,569
l'm going to my press for a while.
We'll go out aRer that. Okay?

831
01:56:46,866 --> 01:56:51,837
This is Ram Dulare Sinha!
There's no one here!

832
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:55,334
How are you, Ram Dulare?

833
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:01,970
Madam! l have a problem!
And a confusion!

834
01:57:02,533 --> 01:57:02,533
Boss has taken over evemhing
since you've leR.

835
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,068
He doesn't let me help at all!
- What does that mean?

836
01:57:08,166 --> 01:57:08,166
He dresses up Neha on his own.
He prepares the breakfast...

837
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:14,068
and makes me stand
outside the kitchen!

838
01:57:14,366 --> 01:57:17,635
Why? Doesn't Nandita help?

839
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:18,100
She has leR!
- LeR?

840
01:57:21,399 --> 01:57:24,436
With bag and baggage!
l brought her the cab!

841
01:57:26,066 --> 01:57:29,302
Don't tell you boss l had called.

842
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:33,569
Could l tell Neha at least?
- l'll talk to her myself.

843
01:57:47,766 --> 01:57:52,737
Rubbish! How could anyone
have mo mummies?

844
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:55,468
My father never lies!

845
01:57:56,199 --> 01:57:59,736
He said my first mummy
is actually my second...

846
01:57:59,833 --> 01:58:03,002
and my second mother
is actually my first!

847
01:58:03,166 --> 01:58:05,268
Because he didn't find my
first mummy first...

848
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:10,304
he met my second mummy.
So she's my first mummy!

849
01:58:10,399 --> 01:58:11,234
Understand?
- No.

850
01:58:13,633 --> 01:58:15,167
Stupid!

851
01:58:17,266 --> 01:58:20,435
l haven't even got the drawings.
How'll l prepare the estimates?

852
01:58:20,533 --> 01:58:23,435
C'mon, Balsara.
You have all the details here.

853
01:58:28,533 --> 01:58:29,433
l'm leaving.

854
01:58:30,899 --> 01:58:33,869
l hope you're returning. We must
send the estimates this evening.

855
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:37,300
l'm on duty with my daughter
aRer 4 p.m.

856
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:44,705
Hury up, Somu... it's time
for Neha's school break.

857
01:58:45,633 --> 01:58:48,168
l can't say ifAnand
will remember.

858
01:58:48,366 --> 01:58:51,836
Neha might wait at the school.
So let's hury.

859
01:59:15,733 --> 01:59:18,902
My train is late by 3 hours.
l thought l'd bid Neha good-bye.

860
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:21,368
l leR when she was
asleep this morning.

861
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:28,271
You did a good thing by coming.
- l hope you don't mind?

862
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:32,637
Don't say such things.
She's your daughter.

863
01:59:32,866 --> 01:59:37,337
You may meet her any time you wish.
- And you?

864
01:59:46,466 --> 01:59:51,938
ls she your second mummy?
- God! She's my first mummy!

865
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:55,169
My second mummy's away
at Uncle Somu's!

866
01:59:56,766 --> 01:59:58,501
Have you told Neha evemhing?

867
02:00:00,666 --> 02:00:04,002
l hide a truth...
and my wife leR me!

868
02:00:04,766 --> 02:00:07,535
l don't want to hide another truth
and lose my daughter, too.

869
02:00:08,466 --> 02:00:12,303
Where were you, auntie mummy?
- l was around, dear...

870
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:15,769
So let's go home!
- It's time for her train, dear.

871
02:00:15,899 --> 02:00:20,871
But you had promised
that we'd visit the zoo!

872
02:00:22,466 --> 02:00:24,067
Actually, l...

873
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:28,002
l'll take you there.

874
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:31,569
Where's she going away,
Ieaving me behind?

875
02:00:31,666 --> 02:00:35,836
You mustn't be obstinate, Neha.
- You mustn't break a promise.

876
02:00:39,033 --> 02:00:42,870
Stay back, ifyou can.
You may leave tomorrow.

877
02:01:28,033 --> 02:01:31,503
What Anand is doing isn't right.
l'll have a word with him.

878
02:01:31,666 --> 02:01:32,566
That isn't necessay.

879
02:01:36,899 --> 02:01:39,135
l'm only tying to help...
- l've told you.

880
02:01:40,399 --> 02:01:42,502
l don't want any pity.

881
02:02:45,766 --> 02:02:49,035
Sory. l was held up.
- Yes. You're busy nowadays.

882
02:02:49,766 --> 02:02:51,534
Well? What is it?

883
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,834
How's Kavita?

884
02:03:02,899 --> 02:03:05,068
l can't even talk to her...
she doesn't take my calls!

885
02:03:05,399 --> 02:03:07,135
Maybe she doesn't want to
talk to you at all.

886
02:03:07,699 --> 02:03:10,302
Please make her see reason.
Neha's missing her vey much.

887
02:03:10,699 --> 02:03:15,037
Why don't you send Neha to her?
- And how will l live?

888
02:03:15,166 --> 02:03:20,137
Why not? You have...
- What do you mean?

889
02:03:21,133 --> 02:03:22,968
How many pies will you
have your fingers in?

890
02:03:24,533 --> 02:03:26,268
Now don't you talk like
this about Nandita...

891
02:03:26,333 --> 02:03:28,168
The whole world is talking
about the two ofyou.

892
02:03:29,833 --> 02:03:34,804
She's young and beautiful.
She has borne you a daughter.

893
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:40,103
Okay. l'll talk to Kavita.
But l don't think that will help.

894
02:03:42,699 --> 02:03:45,436
l'm sory. Kavita must be
waiting for me.

895
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:53,136
You take ages to pick up
the phone, mom!

896
02:08:53,233 --> 02:08:55,969
Sory, dear.
l was in the garden.

897
02:08:56,166 --> 02:09:01,137
Why aren't you coming home?
- It's just that...

898
02:09:01,366 --> 02:09:06,337
Are you still angy with Papa?
Hasn't he said sory to you?

899
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:11,068
Didn't you go to school today?
- l did.

900
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:14,069
But Papa made me wear
the wrong dress again.

901
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:17,436
Who brought you back from school?
- Ramu did.

902
02:09:17,866 --> 02:09:21,769
Know what, mummy?
We had been to the zoo.

903
02:09:22,266 --> 02:09:27,237
We had a nice time!
We had rides and ice-creams.

904
02:09:41,933 --> 02:09:46,270
Papa says Nandita auntie
is my first mummy.

905
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,836
But l'm your daughter...
isn't that right?

906
02:09:51,566 --> 02:09:54,835
Yes. You're my daughter.

907
02:09:55,300 --> 02:10:00,271
So why don't you come to me?
- l will, dear. l sure will.

908
02:10:00,699 --> 02:10:04,537
l'll come over with Ramu,
ifyou don't.

909
02:10:04,633 --> 02:10:06,368
Don't do that... l'll come over.

910
02:10:06,433 --> 02:10:06,433
We'll go to zoo again
and have lots of fun.

911
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:11,667
Sure.

912
02:10:18,366 --> 02:10:20,634
Come soon, mom...
- Of course, dear.

913
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,901
Don't wory, Mr Somdutt.

914
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,670
l'm a divorce-specialist.
This is my hundredth case.

915
02:10:40,766 --> 02:10:44,102
l've had ninety nine couples
split already.

916
02:10:46,933 --> 02:10:48,968
This is how you must
appear in court.

917
02:10:49,133 --> 02:10:51,735
One look at you and the judge
will issue a decree in your favour.

918
02:10:52,699 --> 02:10:56,804
Court? l don't understand.
- This is a lawyer. Mr Meghani.

919
02:10:57,066 --> 02:10:57,066
He has all the documents ready.
- What papers?

920
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:06,172
We have pressed charges of mental
torture, infidelity and...

921
02:11:06,266 --> 02:11:10,370
illicit relations with a woman.
You'll get a divorce immediately.

922
02:11:10,566 --> 02:11:12,801
A divorce?
- Of course!

923
02:11:13,733 --> 02:11:16,102
l'll make life miserable
for Mr Anand!

924
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:19,536
He has filed a claim for
Neha's custody on your behalf.

925
02:11:19,699 --> 02:11:22,969
She'll now live with you.
- Now wait a moment...

926
02:11:23,066 --> 02:11:27,737
What's going on, Somu?
How can l decide like this?

927
02:11:27,833 --> 02:11:31,102
Well! We seem to be
keener than she is!

928
02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:35,435
You saw it all yesterday, Kavita!

929
02:11:36,699 --> 02:11:40,737
You spoke of leaving Anand!
- l did.

930
02:11:41,333 --> 02:11:45,303
But l need some time
to think it over.

931
02:11:45,466 --> 02:11:47,367
What will you think about?

932
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:52,171
Do you expect Anand to call
you back as his wife again?

933
02:11:52,666 --> 02:11:55,902
Where is your self-respect?
How much more will you bear?!

934
02:12:05,266 --> 02:12:07,534
Leave the papers here,
Mr Meghani.

935
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:27,570
Did Mummy say sory to you?
- No.

936
02:12:28,566 --> 02:12:33,537
Did you call her?
Or talk to her?

937
02:12:34,433 --> 02:12:37,469
How will l talk to her, dear?
She doesn't take my calls.

938
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,267
l'll make her talk to you!

939
02:12:49,366 --> 02:12:52,702
This is Miss Neha Kishore here!

940
02:12:54,333 --> 02:12:58,236
Why don't you come home?
- Ask your papa that question.

941
02:12:59,199 --> 02:13:02,736
Will you return if Papa
says sory to you?

942
02:13:02,899 --> 02:13:06,803
He won't say that, dear.
- Of course, he will.

943
02:13:07,266 --> 02:13:08,800
Talk to her, dad.

944
02:13:10,266 --> 02:13:12,001
Don't refuse him, mummy!

945
02:13:16,266 --> 02:13:18,034
Speak up, papa!

946
02:13:21,266 --> 02:13:23,301
l have nothing to talk
to you about.

947
02:13:27,366 --> 02:13:29,267
Did she hang up?

948
02:13:30,433 --> 02:13:35,838
She's getting to be terrible!
- No. l'm the one who's terrible.

949
02:13:37,366 --> 02:13:39,468
l'll personally go and
apologise to her.

950
02:13:58,899 --> 02:14:02,069
ls madam Kavita in?
- Yes. One moment.

951
02:14:38,399 --> 02:14:41,369
What is this?
- Just what you see.

952
02:14:43,466 --> 02:14:45,234
Who gave Kavita the idea?

953
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,971
Kavita is no kid, Anand.
She can think for herself.

954
02:14:52,266 --> 02:14:57,070
And she's right too.
How much will she tolerate you?

955
02:15:01,399 --> 02:15:06,738
So it was your advise. l wish
l knew what a friend you are.

956
02:15:07,899 --> 02:15:10,435
You should've been tending
to her wounds...

957
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:12,935
and you were instead
rubbing salt on them.

958
02:15:14,199 --> 02:15:19,171
l couldn't imagine
you'd fall so much!

959
02:15:19,333 --> 02:15:24,304
Who are you calling a fallen man?
You're the one who has stooped!

960
02:15:26,266 --> 02:15:28,601
No matter what happens bemeen
Kavita and me. You will..

961
02:15:35,266 --> 02:15:39,003
My wife... remember that!
- What wife?!

962
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:42,768
Have you leR me worthy
of being called that?

963
02:15:42,966 --> 02:15:45,134
l've made a mistake, all right!

964
02:15:45,199 --> 02:15:49,037
So what do l do?
Kill myself? Hang to death?!

965
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:49,199
ls this the punishment
you will give me?

966
02:15:51,833 --> 02:15:51,833
Will putting your signature
on this give you any peace?

967
02:15:53,566 --> 02:15:53,566
You have found peace in what
you have done, haven't you?

968
02:15:56,333 --> 02:15:56,333
You have a lover, a wife,
a kid... evemhing!

969
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,471
What are you talking about?!
- Skip the drama, Anand Kishore!

970
02:16:03,866 --> 02:16:07,836
ARer what you've done to Kavita,
what did you expect?

971
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,902
A bouquet from her?
With a thank-you note?

972
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:16,971
lt's all your doing.
You have instigated her!

973
02:16:17,766 --> 02:16:21,936
You could never stomach the fact
that she had leR you for me.

974
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,235
And now that you have
the opportunity...

975
02:16:26,133 --> 02:16:31,104
But remember... Kavita is my wife.
And l'll never give her a divorce!

976
02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:35,736
l'll see what you're going to do.
- Somu will do nothing.

977
02:16:35,966 --> 02:16:37,434
lt's l who will do it!

978
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:06,969
She wants a divorce... as if
marriage were a child's play!

979
02:17:08,966 --> 02:17:12,569
We have taken the
sacred vows together...

980
02:17:13,733 --> 02:17:16,836
and what is more,
we have loved each other.

981
02:17:21,433 --> 02:17:24,836
Does one mistake render
evemhing to dust?

982
02:17:27,066 --> 02:17:30,235
We have built this relationship
bit by evey bit!

983
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,602
We have lived for each other

984
02:17:33,866 --> 02:17:35,634
Will all that be overjust...

985
02:17:48,533 --> 02:17:52,203
How can she think or even
talk of living without me?!

986
02:17:54,266 --> 02:17:58,503
l will never leave her... She
hasn't sacrificed any less for me.

987
02:17:58,966 --> 02:18:01,735
She gave up her dreams,
her aspirations and her father too!

988
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:07,671
Will all these sacrifices be
finished forjust one mistake?

989
02:18:19,033 --> 02:18:20,367
You won't understand, Nandita.

990
02:18:21,966 --> 02:18:23,934
When you have someone
to love you...

991
02:18:25,166 --> 02:18:27,401
it changes the meaning
ofyour life.

992
02:18:29,866 --> 02:18:34,036
One always looks for ways
to keep the other happy.

993
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:42,836
l'd find myself all alone
without Kavita.

994
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:47,970
My life would be meaningless.
Whom would l live for?

995
02:18:48,299 --> 02:18:52,470
And she too...
it can't happen!

996
02:19:06,666 --> 02:19:07,767
C'mon, Kavita.

997
02:19:08,399 --> 02:19:10,635
You're late. It's time
for the hearing.

998
02:19:13,033 --> 02:19:14,200
C'mon.

999
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:27,067
Just a minute, Kavita.

1000
02:19:34,466 --> 02:19:37,135
What are you up to, Kavita?
Please don't do this!

1001
02:19:37,266 --> 02:19:41,737
Let go of my hand, Anand.
- Please hear me out!

1002
02:19:41,833 --> 02:19:43,801
Say evemhing to the judge.
C'mon, Kavita.

1003
02:19:46,266 --> 02:19:49,435
Please don't disturb my client.
Or else...

1004
02:19:57,566 --> 02:19:59,601
l want your signatures
on this.

1005
02:20:22,866 --> 02:20:25,635
What is it?
l am your layer Please sign it.

1006
02:20:54,033 --> 02:20:55,768
Do you want a divorce

1007
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:06,870
Your lawyer claims that Mr Anand
Kishore has betrayed you...

1008
02:21:06,966 --> 02:21:06,966
he has tortured you and has
inflicted atrocities on you.

1009
02:21:11,033 --> 02:21:13,301
He had illicit relations
with another woman.

1010
02:21:13,399 --> 02:21:15,068
That he brought one
Mrs Nandita Rai home...

1011
02:21:15,166 --> 02:21:17,935
and threw you out in
the middle ofthe night.

1012
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:20,701
That's a lie, Your Honour.

1013
02:21:23,533 --> 02:21:24,700
Let's not...

1014
02:21:24,833 --> 02:21:28,436
One moment, Mr Anand.
l'll record your statement later.

1015
02:21:30,166 --> 02:21:32,334
Please ask her to talk to me,
Your Honour.

1016
02:21:32,666 --> 02:21:36,136
lf not for me, she must at least
think of our daughter!

1017
02:21:36,666 --> 02:21:38,401
Daughter? In whose custody is she?

1018
02:21:38,833 --> 02:21:42,803
She's in Mr Anand's custody.
He has forcibly taken possession

1019
02:21:43,033 --> 02:21:45,135
We have filed a claim
for her custody.

1020
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:46,534
That's a lie, Your Honour.

1021
02:21:46,899 --> 02:21:50,570
Mrs Kavita herselfwalked out
on her daughter...

1022
02:21:51,399 --> 02:21:53,168
l beg ofyou, sir...
Please stop it!

1023
02:22:01,666 --> 02:22:04,001
The next hearing will be
on the 15th of October.

1024
02:22:08,266 --> 02:22:12,603
Come to my chamber, Mr Somdutt.
l'll have the affidavit ready.

1025
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:26,471
Did you see all the dim
linen being washed in public..

1026
02:22:26,566 --> 02:22:29,302
when we take family matters
to the courts?

1027
02:22:31,299 --> 02:22:36,271
We still have time.
Have faith in me. Let's go home.

1028
02:22:36,866 --> 02:22:42,204
We have a world of our own...
with you, me and Neha.

1029
02:22:43,233 --> 02:22:45,201
There can be no one else!

1030
02:22:47,399 --> 02:22:50,669
Are you sure there won't
be anyone else?

1031
02:22:50,966 --> 02:22:55,070
No one.
- So why is she here?

1032
02:23:02,433 --> 02:23:07,938
Why are you here Miss Nandita Rai?
Or shall l say Mrs Nandita Kishore?

1033
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:15,071
l know l have hurt you, Kavita.

1034
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:19,636
But believe me. Before l came
to your house...

1035
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:20,200
l didn't know it was
Anand's house too.

1036
02:23:21,966 --> 02:23:26,937
You bore his child! And you didn't
even know where he stayed!

1037
02:23:28,299 --> 02:23:32,470
l'm speaking the truth.
l didn't even know his name.

1038
02:23:33,299 --> 02:23:36,970
Don't you know what
we call women...

1039
02:23:37,066 --> 02:23:38,600
who don't even their children's
father's name?

1040
02:23:38,666 --> 02:23:42,703
Please don't say that! Neha is
as much your child as she is mine.

1041
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:46,269
Please trust me...
- Trust?! What trust?

1042
02:23:46,466 --> 02:23:51,003
Do you even know
what that means?

1043
02:23:51,233 --> 02:23:53,335
lt was out oftrust that
l gave you place in my house.

1044
02:23:53,399 --> 02:23:53,399
lt was out oftrust that l
shared Neha's love with you.

1045
02:23:55,799 --> 02:23:58,402
But you have always
betrayed my trust!

1046
02:23:58,666 --> 02:24:00,701
l am homeless because ofyou.

1047
02:24:00,833 --> 02:24:05,804
l've lost my husband and my child!
And l must trust you?!

1048
02:24:06,033 --> 02:24:09,136
Believe me, l did
nothing deliberately.

1049
02:24:12,833 --> 02:24:15,302
Maybe l have lost your trust.

1050
02:24:15,899 --> 02:24:18,669
But l come in the hope that...

1051
02:24:19,799 --> 02:24:25,539
since you are a woman and a
mother, you will forgive me.

1052
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:31,601
l will not lie.

1053
02:24:33,899 --> 02:24:38,304
l was over-whelmed to
see Neha in your house.

1054
02:24:39,799 --> 02:24:44,771
l was happy that she had
found a better mother than me.

1055
02:24:46,466 --> 02:24:48,100
l wanted to go away.

1056
02:24:49,299 --> 02:24:54,271
But l couldn't control myself
when l found Anand there.

1057
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:01,936
l didn't ever want to
break your home.

1058
02:25:03,700 --> 02:25:08,671
But when you walked out,
...l started getting hopes.

1059
02:25:13,766 --> 02:25:18,737
l thought this was perhaps
God's way ofjustice...

1060
02:25:19,333 --> 02:25:23,570
You've had your share ofjoy.
And it was my turn now.

1061
02:25:27,766 --> 02:25:29,434
But nothing ever belonged to me.

1062
02:25:36,433 --> 02:25:42,238
Anand could have done anything to me,
aRer you had leR.

1063
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:46,001
Anything!

1064
02:25:47,466 --> 02:25:49,701
And l'd have happily consented.

1065
02:25:51,399 --> 02:25:57,506
But no... he respected me for
being the mother of his child.

1066
02:25:59,433 --> 02:26:00,400
That is all.

1067
02:26:04,833 --> 02:26:08,870
You might call our physical
relationship a sin...

1068
02:26:09,133 --> 02:26:12,803
but you can't imagine what
an ordeal we had gone through.

1069
02:26:15,133 --> 02:26:20,104
Swinging bemeen life and death...
we did stagger that moment.

1070
02:26:27,366 --> 02:26:34,039
Anand loves only you, Kavita.
There's nothing lacking in his love.

1071
02:26:34,366 --> 02:26:36,468
He loves only you.

1072
02:26:36,633 --> 02:26:40,536
More than anything else in the world.
More than himself.

1073
02:26:43,399 --> 02:26:46,002
That's the truth.

1074
02:26:50,899 --> 02:26:52,801
And nobody knows it better than me.

1075
02:26:55,566 --> 02:26:58,602
When you know so much,
why are you staying in my house?

1076
02:26:58,666 --> 02:27:02,636
Why don't you go away?
- l will.

1077
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:05,768
l came here to go away.

1078
02:27:07,733 --> 02:27:11,570
But there's something
l must ask for.

1079
02:27:12,899 --> 02:27:17,070
Give it to me in charity.
- Now what do you want?

1080
02:27:21,666 --> 02:27:22,933
What?!

1081
02:27:23,233 --> 02:27:26,903
Give me Neha.
l'll live on her support!

1082
02:27:27,366 --> 02:27:32,337
Have you gone mad?!
- What are you saying, Nandita?

1083
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:37,104
We can't even think of parting
with our daughter...

1084
02:27:37,233 --> 02:27:40,135
Please, Anand! You have Kavita
and evemhing else in life!

1085
02:27:41,066 --> 02:27:43,802
But in Neha, l will find
a daughter and you too!

1086
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:46,001
l'll have found a reason to live!

1087
02:27:46,366 --> 02:27:49,902
Believe me, l will love her
more than my life!

1088
02:27:50,799 --> 02:27:52,535
l will always hold her
close to my heart...!

1089
02:27:52,733 --> 02:27:54,701
Please give Neha to me...

1090
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:58,470
l promise never to
show you my face again!

1091
02:28:01,066 --> 02:28:02,534
Why don't you answer her, Anand!

1092
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:06,337
Kavita is mine!
l'll never part with her!

1093
02:28:06,566 --> 02:28:09,235
Don't say that, Kavita.
You have Anand.

1094
02:28:09,366 --> 02:28:12,035
You can have all the
happiness in your life!

1095
02:28:12,933 --> 02:28:17,904
But l have nothing...
l'm all alone!

1096
02:28:19,866 --> 02:28:21,067
l'm vey lonely...!

1097
02:28:26,066 --> 02:28:31,037
No, Anand! You can't do this!

1098
02:28:32,299 --> 02:28:33,768
l beg ofyou!

1099
02:28:51,866 --> 02:28:57,538
My love... l'm here for you.
- l want Neha too.

1100
02:29:00,700 --> 02:29:05,671
Do you trust me?
- l can't live without Neha.

1101
02:29:08,033 --> 02:29:10,335
And l can't live with you.

1102
02:29:11,366 --> 02:29:16,337
You mean the world to me...
We are, because you are.

1103
02:29:18,966 --> 02:29:24,304
No! l've lost her once...
l won't lose my child again!

1104
02:29:25,166 --> 02:29:30,137
How can l give my daughter away?
How will l live without her?

1105
02:29:30,333 --> 02:29:31,801
We will live with
each other's support.

1106
02:29:33,733 --> 02:29:37,703
Let her take Neha away.
- No, Anand!

1107
02:29:38,366 --> 02:29:43,337
No, Nandita! Please!
Don't let her take Neha away!

1108
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:47,070
Go on, Nandita. Take her away.
- No!

1109
02:29:51,666 --> 02:29:54,568
No! You have no right
to give Neha away!

1110
02:29:55,733 --> 02:29:59,136
Go away! For God's sake!

1111
02:30:07,166 --> 02:30:12,137
No! Leave me alone...
l can't give my Neha away!

1112
02:30:12,666 --> 02:30:17,637
Anand, l...
- Stop her, Anand! Please!

1113
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:28,670
Mr Anand had called.
You can take Neha away.

1114
02:31:29,766 --> 02:31:31,734
l can't live without Neha...

1115
02:31:54,266 --> 02:31:57,335
No... how will l live
in this house without her?

1116
02:32:28,166 --> 02:32:31,135
Do you know, mom?
Today's my real birthday!

1117
02:32:31,733 --> 02:32:35,636
What?
- Auntie mummy told me!

1118
02:32:40,433 --> 02:32:42,168
Let's go in.

1119
02:32:58,399 --> 02:33:01,369
Where is your auntie mummy, dear?
- It was time for her train.

1120
02:33:01,466 --> 02:33:05,002
She has leR. But she has leR
word for you in this tape.

1121
02:33:06,533 --> 02:33:08,368
Have you seen my
birthday cake, papa?

1122
02:33:28,566 --> 02:33:33,103
''Anand once complained that
l had leR without a word''

1123
02:33:34,066 --> 02:33:36,334
''So l want to have my say
this time, before l leave''

1124
02:33:37,799 --> 02:33:40,769
''l seek forgiveness from you,
to begin with''

1125
02:33:41,299 --> 02:33:43,969
''l have hurt you vey much.
Please forgive me''

1126
02:33:44,066 --> 02:33:49,037
''lt's a welcome co-incidence.
It's Neha's real birthday...''

1127
02:33:49,166 --> 02:33:55,338
''and l'm leaving behind my
father's and my estate for her''

1128
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:59,136
''Evemhing belongs to her.
She must have it all''

1129
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:08,737
''l understand the anguish of a mother
whose child is snatched from her''

1130
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:12,469
''And no mother can cause
this agony to another mother''

1131
02:34:12,833 --> 02:34:17,804
''l must have borne her.
But she is your daughter''

1132
02:34:19,466 --> 02:34:22,202
''She asked for you,
the moment l met her''

1133
02:34:22,899 --> 02:34:25,502
''Anand had returned
my child to me''

1134
02:34:26,166 --> 02:34:28,701
''And l am returning
your Neha to you''

1135
02:34:30,266 --> 02:34:34,036
''l was blinded by selfishness.
l wanted my daughter back''

1136
02:34:34,399 --> 02:34:39,371
''l forgot, l had decreed
the orphanage for her''

1137
02:34:39,933 --> 02:34:43,670
''lt's you and Anand who have
given her a real life''

1138
02:34:45,066 --> 02:34:48,035
''l must apologise to Anand
before l leave, too''

1139
02:34:48,866 --> 02:34:52,970
''Rarely do you find a father,
a husband, a human-being like him''

1140
02:34:54,366 --> 02:34:59,337
''The one unexpected moment of love
l got from him, is enough for me''

1141
02:35:00,133 --> 02:35:02,401
''l now have yours and
Neha's memories linked with them''

1142
02:35:03,299 --> 02:35:06,069
''So l'm not alone anymore''

1143
02:35:07,266 --> 02:35:10,102
''l'm going away forever...''

1144
02:35:10,433 --> 02:35:13,269
''but you will forever
remain with me''

1145
02:35:36,166 --> 02:35:37,133
ls that the Banaras express?

1146
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:37,733
lts about to leave
