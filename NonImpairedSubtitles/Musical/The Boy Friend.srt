1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,700
I could be happy with you

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,415
If you could be happy with me

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,100
I'd be contented

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,253
Here, Pol.

6
00:00:22,800-> 00:00:23,724
Here.

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,192
What about my money?

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,461
-Where's my baby?
-She's over there!

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,190
Put it on the slate!

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,900
I'll get the sack
if they're late again.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,300
Hurry up, then.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,200
Just along there.

11
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,649
Good afternoon,
Mr. and Mrs. Parkhill.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,600
Good afternoon, Len.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,160
All for Mrs. P,
I'm afraid.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,754
-Must be bills, then.
-Thank you, darling.

15
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,456
My man sent me
maintenance order, Len?

16
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,658
I'll have a look now.

17
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,328
Old gin, old pals
and jolly good company

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,296
Disgusting!

19
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,665
For you, dear.

20
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,900
Are you selling by post now, love?

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,667
__

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,060
Hi there, gorgeous.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,860
I suppose I should be thankful
for small mercies.

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,760
-Anything?
-Nothing for you this morning.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
They are all in yet, Len?

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,200
All in except Rita and Tommy.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,200
Oh, he won't be long.
You can hear him coming a mile off.

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,760
Practising, practising.
Don't you ever stop dancing?

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,400
Hey, toots. I'm in training
for my second big break.

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
You're kidding.
What was the first?

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,822
Didn't you ever hear
of the baby toast of Broadway?

32
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,824
Tiny Tom, the tapping tot?

33
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,200
Grew up, didn't you?

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,699
Overnight.

35
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,060
And who can use a Tiny Tod
who's 10 feet tall?

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,437
How about Barnum and Bailey?

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,560
They already had one
and he was a bearded lady.

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,900
So I booked a one-way ticket
on a cattle boat to merry old England.

39
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,160
Blimey!
From Broadway to Portsmouth?

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,300
-There's a comedown in it.
-A stepping-stone, toots.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,087
A mere stepping-stone to stardom.

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Not bad!

43
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,400
-Here's your stuff, love.
-Ta.

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
Cheese and chutney, right?

45
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,600
Thanks, Pol. Put it on the slate.

46
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,000
All right.

47
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,141
Ta.

48
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,447
Who sent me the flowers?

49
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,119
I forget.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
I bought one apple too many.
Would you like it?

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,891
No, thanks.

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,800
I've had one already.

53
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,936
Pol,

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,571
I'll have it if it's going begging.

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,000
All right, love.
You have it.

56
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,900
Ta.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,510
Five minutes, everyone.

58
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,789
Afternoon. Here is your gin.

59
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,900
Don't you knock when
you enter the star's dressing room?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,660
Sorry.

61
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,094
They didn't have smoked salmon
so I got salmon shrimp, all right?

62
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:17,160
Paste? Sure you don't expect
Mrs. P. to eat paste, do you?

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm sorry, but it was
the nearest they had.

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Nearest they had! Look at that!
Take them away.

65
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,060
Never mind, Polly. I just need
something to settle me before I go on.

66
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,560
Anything will do.

67
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,243
But it was the best I had, Mrs. P.

68
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,900
Ship them by appointment.
They have it at Buckingham Palace.

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,160
When they're entertaining
their Cockney Highnesses.

70
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,360
The pearly King
and Queen, I suppose.

71
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,300
-How long we've got?
-Five minutes.

72
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,353
And my change?

73
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,290
I owe you 2 and 11 pence
with 3 farthings.

74
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,500
If I give you a farthing
you can give me 3 bob.

75
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,700
Polly!

76
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,600
Ta, Mrs. P.
You shouldn't.

77
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,600
The way you encourage her!

78
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,100
Overture and beginners, please.

79
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,060
My hatbox came undone last day, Polly.

80
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,114
It won't happen again, Ms. Maisie.

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,900
Help me with my hooks.

82
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,160
I do love my feather duster
on the upside of my dismal, Polly.

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,656
Do try and remember.

84
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,600
Got a fag, Pol?

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,700
Only a Woodbine.

86
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,166
Ain't he lovely?

87
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,800
Polly, don't whistle
in the dressing room.

88
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,773
-Why not?
-Because it's unlucky.

89
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,800
Now go outside, turn around three times
and knock on the door.

90
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,882
-What do nursing mothers need?
-Virol.

91
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Come in.

92
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,000
-Now swear.
-Damn.

93
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,900
-Where is that lazy lady?
-She'll turn up, don't worry.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
She'll be late
to her own funeral, that one.

95
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,500
Where is Rita?

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,700
Isn't she here yet?
I don't expect she'll be missed.

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,700
She is the star of the show.

98
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,170
Do you really think so?

99
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,600
She'll be fined again
if she ain't careful.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,100
They're all called, Mr. Max.
Except Rita. She ain't here yet.

101
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,900
Not here?
Put her down for a fine.

102
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,600
If you fine her again
she will owe you money.

103
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
With this house I need it.

104
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,500
Why must these wretched garden fêtes
always coincide with our matinees?

105
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,260
And not a cloud in the sky.
Let me know the minute she arrives.

106
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,169
Yes, Mr. Max

107
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,800
Blimey! There's more on stage
than in the blooming audience.

108
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,730
Down there.

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,000
Is that Gaston, the costumier?

110
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,900
It is Madame Dubonnet's maid.

111
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,101
Dubonnet.

112
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,278
Mme Dubonnet de Villa Caprice.

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,300
Accent!

114
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Accent!

115
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,400
The school for young ladies.

116
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,760
I wish to know if you have ready
the costume for Ms. Polly Browne.

117
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,133
Accent.

118
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,604
She wishes it for
the carnival ball "ce soir".

119
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,476
You do not comprehend?
Then get me Monsieur Gaston himself.

120
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,560
She's no more French than I am.

121
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,060
-Rita here?
-No, Mr. Max. Naughty!

122
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,191
Nobody asked for your opinion.

123
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:14,160
She was out having an ice tea
with a sailor around lunch time.

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,096
Opening time, dear.
Let's be honest.

125
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,330
Fine publicity.

126
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,833
-She's never missed an entrance yet.
-Mind your hatbox, Dulcie.

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,260
She's never been sane
since I turned her into a star.
It went to her head totally.

128
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,200
-Telephone, Mr. Max.
-Tell them to ring again.

129
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,360
How can you expect me to speak
at a time like this!

130
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,300
They must speak to you
personally!

131
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,900
It's not C. B. Cochrane
from London, is it?

132
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,184
No. It's the hospital.

133
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,122
Then you deliver it right away?

134
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,200
Have you forgotten who you are?

135
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,667
Forgotten who we are?

136
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,900
Of course not!

137
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,660
We are perfect
young ladies

138
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,780
preparing to take
our places among the noblesse

139
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,260
We are perfect young ladies
Preparing to make

140
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,954
the most of the charm
we possess

141
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,525
You're being finished
And your families' wealth

142
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,560
may be diminished

143
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,532
But at least you all
have perfect health

144
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,900
And making the grade
is our duty, you see

145
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,260
For perfect young ladies are we

146
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,660
We are perfect young ladies

147
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,447
We hope to attract
a husband whose credit is good

148
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,560
You're maybe young ladies

149
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,660
But why don't you act

150
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,600
The way that a young lady should?

151
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,560
-I've often told you
-Please don't tell us again

152
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,460
-I ought to scold you
-But

153
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,560
you know it would be
quite in vain

154
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,260
For being our maid is
your duty, you see

155
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,900
For perfect young ladies are we

156
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,690
Terrible, terrible.

157
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,559
Not Rita.

158
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,263
Trapped her high heel
in the tram line. A foot.

159
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,564
It ain't off?

160
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,160
Of course not. Mild fracture.
But she's laid up just the same.

161
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,560
We're ruined.

162
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,472
No, we're not.
You will have to go on.

163
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,473
Get ready.

164
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,760
What, me?
But I'm only the A. S. M.

165
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,160
I can't go on.

166
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,440
It's the assistant stage manager's job
to understudy everybody's part.

167
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,160
Now, I told you that
when I took you on.

168
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,700
Now, hurry up
and don't argue.

169
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,700
You've got exactly 5 minutes.

170
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,900
I do not feel funny.

171
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,133
I want the best seat
in the house.

172
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,568
Let me see.

173
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,800
You could have the royal box.

174
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,140
I'll take it.

175
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:27,347
Except that it's permanently reserved
for the princess Arthur of Connaught.

176
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,349
We often stay with her.

177
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, really!

178
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,356
How about the stage box?

179
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,057
How much?

180
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,127
One pound, please.

181
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,362
That's a small box.

182
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,132
-How many are you?
-We are one.

183
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,167
Any further orders, Mr. De Thrill?

184
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,169
Just wait outside.

185
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,100
On no account is Mr De Thrill
to be disturbed, woman. Get it?

186
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,378
Really!

187
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,053
Why does she have such
blinking big plates of meat, Alf?

188
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,788
Stop worrying
and try that for size.

189
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,300
Rosemary and Mr. __,
they know well.

190
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,500
-It fits!
-Yes?

191
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,528
Oh, we'll find the other one
and you're ready for the ball.

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,134
You're going on?

193
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:23,803
All the best.

194
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,575
You're not wearing those, are you?

195
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,226
But you are beautiful.

196
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,241
Good luck.

197
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,982
All this in one day is too much.

198
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,700
Come on, Cinderella.

199
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,221
You're on.

200
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,859
How perfectly ripping!

201
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,295
Our very first carnival ball.

202
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,298
"En français", of course.

203
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,266
I can't wait for this evening!

204
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,569
My frock is a dream.

205
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,971
So is mine.
And rather daring too.

206
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,941
I'm sure Mme. Dubonnet
will be furious.

207
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,476
Not she!

208
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:40,900
I bet she'll turn up in something
frightfully shocking.

209
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Not De Thrill,
the famous movie director?

210
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,400
How do I know what
sort of a thrill he is?

211
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,300
Look for yourself.
He is in the stage box.

212
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,800
Why didn't you say so?

213
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,566
Yes, it's him.

214
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,603
Word's got about.
My reputation will be made!

215
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,000
No. Will be ruined.
That girl!

216
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,000
That girl. She can't go on.
We must stop her.

217
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,600
He don't think I'm any good.
I can't go on now.

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,300
Bring down the curtain.
We'll send the audience home.

219
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,219
Then I'll go and refund the money.

220
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,400
Wait. Let me think.
__

221
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,900
Here comes Polly Browne
across the tennis courts.

222
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,700
-Polly Browne?
-Yes.

223
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
And she's carrying a letter.

224
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,268
Hello, Polly.

225
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,541
Oh, Polly! Just think!

226
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,810
London's great theatre land
waiting for you!

227
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,614
His Majesty, the Prince of Wales,
the Duchess, the Royalty,

228
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,960
the Duke of York, the Queen…

229
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,300
That's a nice ring.
Hold your tongue, woman.

230
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,500
It's Hollywood calling,
not the Palace.

231
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,324
Listen to me.

232
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,560
The careers and lives

233
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,000
of all these boys and girls
are depending on you.

234
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,800
I'm not asking for myself.
But do it for them.

235
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,300
Polly, listen to me!

236
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,671
You are going out there
as a youngster.

237
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,500
You've got to
come back a star.

238
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,800
Now get out there
and do your damnedest.

239
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
-Hello, Polly!
-Hello, everyone!

240
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,200
Where is Rita?

241
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,960
She got her foot
caught in the tram line.

242
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,300
She's in the hospital.

243
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,594
Hello, everyone.

244
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,062
Where have you been?

245
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,000
Hello, everyone.

246
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,700
Where have you been?

247
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,006
We dashed into town this morning
to collect our costumes for the carnival ball.

248
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,700
We couldn't wait
until Monsieur Gaston delivered them.

249
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,260
You must see mine, Polly.
You'll adore it.

250
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,713
Or mine!

251
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,182
-You'll be green with envy.
-Envy!

252
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,400
You know we'll all be jealous
of Polly when she gets hers.

253
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,122
What are you going as, Polly?

254
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,727
I'm going as Pierrette.

255
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,030
Pierrette! How divine!

256
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,432
Now do tell us your secret, Polly.

257
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,135
What secret?

258
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,400
If you are going
as Pierrette,

259
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,200
who is going

260
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,777
as Pierrot?

261
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,949
I still want it to be a secret.

262
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,400
I've had another letter

263
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,123
from Paris.

264
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,659
From Paris! How marvellous!

265
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,400
And what does he say?

266
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
He says he's

267
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,678
motoring down overnight.

268
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,000
In fact

269
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,600
he should be here
any moment now.

270
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,123
How thrilling!

271
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,159
And how does he sign himself?

272
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,300
Does he say

273
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,962
"Passionately yours"?

274
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:20,166
Or "yours adoringly"?

275
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,270
Or does he just say
"With all my love"?

276
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,273
Do tell us about him, Polly.

277
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,710
There ain't very much to tell, really.

278
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,013
I expect you know how I feel
as well as I do.

279
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,260
Any girl who's reached the age

280
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,157
of seventeen or thereabouts

281
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:50,730
has but one desire in view

282
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,764
Eyes and teeth.

283
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,460
She knows she has reached the stage

284
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,660
of needing one to care about

285
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,510
Nothing else would really do

286
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,560
Childhood games are left behind

287
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,460
And her heart takes wing

288
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,860
Hoping that it soon will find

289
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,228
Just one thing

290
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,332
We've got to have

291
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,768
We plot to have

292
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,660
For it's so dreary
not to have

293
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,809
that certain thing called

294
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,278
"the boy friend"

295
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,660
We scheme about
and dream about

296
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,860
And we've been known
to scream about

297
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,500
that certain thing called
"the boy friend"

298
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,460
He is really a necessity

299
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,400
If you want to get on

300
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,660
And we might as well confess it
He is a "sine qua non"

301
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,800
We sigh for him
and cry for him

302
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,900
and we would gladly
die for him

303
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,475
that certain thing called
"the boy friend"

304
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,100
A piano and drums.
What must De Thrill think?

305
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,200
If only we had money
what a spectacle I'd show them.

306
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,000
A royal command
performance.

307
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,000
We plead to have

308
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,518
We need to have

309
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,360
In fact our poor hearts
bleed to have

310
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,459
That certain thing called
"the boy friend"

311
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,972
We'd save for him

312
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,774
and slave for him

313
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,800
We'd even
misbehave for him

314
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,200
That certain thing called

315
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,957
"the boy friend"

316
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,660
Life without us is impossible

317
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,800
And devoid of all charms

318
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,660
No amount of idle gossip'll

319
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,600
Keep them out of our arms

320
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,860
We're blue without

321
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,260
Can't do without

322
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,100
Our dreams just won't come true without

323
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,800
That certain thing called

324
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,824
"the boy friend"

325
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,294
Polly, the spirit of ecstasy?
Ridiculous!

326
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Oh, no!
She's forgotten the steps!

327
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,235
Do a "Ruby Keeler".

328
00:24:37,300--> 00:24:38,210
Go on.

329
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,660
-She is doing all right.
-All right for Pygmalion.

330
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,395
She is supposed to come
from Westminster, not Wa Ping.

331
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,800
Boys, you know you are not allowed
on the privacies. You must leave at once.

332
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,238
-See you on the plage.
-Do not be late.

333
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,108
Goodbye!

334
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,378
But you still haven't told us
much about him, Polly.

335
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,900
Not even his christian name.

336
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,616
What is it, Polly?

337
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,500
Girls!
Here comes Mme. Dubonnet!

338
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,580
This is no way to behave.

339
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,717
All of you to your classrooms

340
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,960
where Mlle. Alice
is waiting to instruct you

341
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,258
in "petit point".

342
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,866
Rita, Rita.

343
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,935
Play it like Rita.

344
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,600
I wish to have a little word
with you, "ma petite".

345
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,047
Promenade with me
into "le jardin".

346
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,783
You can help me
gather some hollyhocks.

347
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,060
Do not be frightened,
"ma chère",

348
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,500
you have done
nothing wrong.

349
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,326
I merely wished to ask
if you are coming to the ball tonight.

350
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,696
Yes, of course.
I've ordered my frock.

351
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,865
I'm going as Pierrette.

352
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,868
So you have a friend
to take you?

353
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I had a letter today.
He's arriving by car from Paris.

354
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,473
From Paris.

355
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,343
Yes. From Paris.

356
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,483
Onion. You've got to cry.

357
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,823
So why is this letter
postmarked form Nice?

358
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,331
Never mind, my little Polly.

359
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,560
Your secret is safe with me.

360
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,400
"Soyez gaie" and trust me

361
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,106
Dry your eyes.

362
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,741
Change your tunic.

363
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,410
You're dancing à la grecque.

364
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,881
No! I won't do it!

365
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:34,152
A West End artist
act with an amateur? Never!

366
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,955
We've enough cockneys
in this show as it is.

367
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,260
And with De Thrill up front, too!

368
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,500
He'll think he's watching
a variety act.

369
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,700
You'll be expecting me to sing
"Any old iron" next.

370
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,350
Any old iron

371
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,872
You look neat
Talk about a treat

372
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,660
You look so dapper
from your napper to your feet

373
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,880
Dressed in style,
brand-new tile,

374
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,360
with your father's
old green tie on

375
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
But I wouldn't give you tuppence
for your old watch and chain,

376
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,500
Old iron, old iron

377
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,200
That's it!
You're a Cockney junk dealer.

378
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,360
Made your fortune
in scrap metal after the war.

379
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,760
You want to better yourself
and Polly too.

380
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,660
You're trying to
live down your past.

381
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,728
I'll write it.
We'll save the show yet.

382
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,065
I won't do it.

383
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,335
Anyone got a fountain pen?

384
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,000
I have one, Mr Max.

385
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,300
Emphasis will?

386
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,300
-Paper, paper.
-Here you are.

387
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,660
I want you all to do your best.
Tell the boys I haven't time.

388
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,500
Tell them to dance like Nijinsky.
De Thrill is up front.

389
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,800
Not De Thrill,
the __ deal manager from Cable Street?

390
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,760
No, it must be De Thrill,
the great Hollywood director

391
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,960
talent spotting
for its new, super, colossal,

392
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,760
all-talking,
all-singing, all-dancing

393
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,796
famous musical.

394
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,764
Oh, that one!

395
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:08,480
Hi, toots.

396
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,300
How's Pol doing?

397
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,500
Quite promising, actually.
Care for a puff?

398
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,724
It might stunt my growth.

399
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,967
I say, that's a kicky step.

400
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,900
Who taught you that?

401
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,471
Search me, toots.

402
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,706
As a kid, I was kicked in the head

403
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,442
and when I came to,

404
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,412
amnesia…

405
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,484
How on earth did that happen?

406
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,886
You've heard of the Russian Revolution.

407
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:53,892
And all that jazz.

408
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:54,826
Yes.

409
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:59,698
I'm told I was
on the steps of Odessa

410
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,406
when the Whites went bananas.

411
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:15,046
When I woke up all I could remember
was how to tapdance.

412
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,516
Fascinating.

413
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,286
Plus the name of one step:
the double-trip,

414
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,222
Maxie-Ford,

415
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,500
with a Knickerbocker break.

416
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,235
What happened to your parents?

417
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,137
I don't know.

418
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,807
I never heard from anybody.

419
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,312
I guess they were done in.

420
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,200
Anyway, since I spoke American

421
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,825
I was shipped off to the States
where they put me in an orphanage.

422
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,326
What was that like?

423
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,929
It was crummy.
They wouldn't even let me tapdance.

424
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,099
One dark night

425
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,669
at the ripe old age of six and a half

426
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,805
I ran away to New York,

427
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,400
to Manhattan, to Times Square,

428
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,300
to Broadway!

429
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,316
Where I became a baby star.

430
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,623
I'm tapping down Broadway

431
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,559
Just tapping down Broadway

432
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,663
Because Broadway
Is my tap, slap, happy home

433
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,770
Then I outgrew my short pants

434
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,540
and it was curtains for Tiny Tom.

435
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,211
You wouldn't be pulling
a fellow's leg, would you?

436
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,448
Every word's the truth.

437
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,016
Cub Scout's oath.

438
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
There's our cue.

439
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,321
Ready?

440
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,890
That was marvellous.

441
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,360
But Tommy, could we
take it easy this afternoon?

442
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,862
I've got the most
appalling headache.

443
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,565
Okay, toots.

444
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:15,634
I'll give it
the old matinee soft sale.

445
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,562
Please, could you give this
to the maitre d'?

446
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,564
-Oui, Mademoiselle.
-Thank you.

447
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,175
-Guess who!
-Tommy!

448
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,578
Goodness me!
Where I am?

449
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,947
Gosh! You did make a chap jump.

450
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,616
Fancy meeting you here.

451
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:07,586
I live here. Do you wanna come up
and see my etchings?

452
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,588
I say. Please.

453
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,856
Please! I must leave at once.

454
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,760
I'm just here on an errand

455
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,428
for Mme Dubonnet arrangements
for the carnival ball tonight.

456
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,732
If she were to find out
I'd be asked to leave under a cloud.

457
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,902
I'm not letting you go
until you promise me one thing.

458
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,738
-What is that?
-You know as well as I do.

459
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,260
-Do I?
-Of course, you do.

460
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,160
I want you to promise
that tonight

461
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,500
you're gonna dance
every dance at the ball with me.

462
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,400
Oh, that!
That's out of the question.

463
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,249
Come on, Maisie. Be a sports.

464
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,785
You know there's nobody
I wanna dance with but you.

465
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,020
Really?

466
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,788
I don't believe you.

467
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,900
Listen, baby, to my plea

468
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,900
Won't you come dancing with me?

469
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,071
be my baby and say "yes"

470
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:04,676
Or else I'm done for, I guess

471
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,979
To dance with you is thrilling

472
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:11,282
to my poor ego

473
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,560
So baby, say you're willing

474
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,190
to shake a leg

475
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,360
Won't you Charleston with me

476
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,665
Won't you Charleston with me

477
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,900
And while the band is playing
that old vo-de-o-do

478
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,239
around we will go

479
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,300
together we'll show them

480
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,711
How the Charleston is done

481
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,883
We'll surprise everyone

482
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,785
Just think what heaven

483
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,760
it's gonna be

484
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,691
if you will Charleston with me

485
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:56,500
Will you Charleston with me

486
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:01,533
Will you Charleston with me

487
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,037
And while the band is playing
that old vo-de-o-do

488
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,572
around we will go

489
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,507
together we'll show them

490
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,300
How the Charleston is done

491
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,849
We'll surprise everyone

492
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,853
She's double-crossed.

493
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,956
De Thrill is in the stage box.

494
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,500
He told me when I joined you
he was a Noël Coward poet.

495
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,900
They don't expect Noël
to talk Cockney --do you--
any more than the Queen!

496
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,700
I can act posh.

497
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,300
Act posh? Harken that!

498
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,632
De Thrill wouldn't understand
a word of it.

499
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,836
It's a foreign language
to them Yanks. It's not English.

500
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,860
Do you think I'm a character, man!

501
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,760
You're hardly a Jew,
are you, darling?

502
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,000
Please, keep our memoire a--

503
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,460
The child is not that bad.
She's got a little talent.

504
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,200
Talent? She'll never make the West End
in a million years.

505
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,548
Let's be honest, darling.

506
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,600
The nearest you ever got to the West End
was "Harrow on the Hill"

507
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,160
Unless you count
the twice-nightlies.

508
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,023
Have you forgotten that charity matinee
I gave at Croydon?

509
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,227
I was in that show!
Cockney Capers.

510
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,200
You sang "Henry VIII"

511
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,065
There you are.
Four tickets.

512
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,960
-What about me?
-You talk awfuly refined.

513
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,969
You shouldn't find it too difficult.

514
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:53,872
I won't do it!

515
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,474
Unless I play it straight.

516
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:58,910
It's perfect.

517
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,579
-Have you fixed it up?
-Here, it won't come off.

518
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,914
Just this one as well.

519
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,800
Polly, before
your parents arrive

520
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,860
I want you to tell me
just one thing.

521
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,892
Yes, Madame?

522
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,760
How is it that one
so sweet and charming as you are

523
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,231
acts to pretend to have

524
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,734
--how do you say?--
boyfriend,

525
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,904
and to write yourself love letters?

526
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,239
It's because of my father, Madame.

527
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,274
Your father?

528
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,160
Before Kaiser Wilhelm
and the horrible war
we were terribly poor.

529
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,000
Daddy was a scrap-metal merchant
and I was a little match-girl.

530
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,420
But after the armistice
he made his fortune.

531
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,160
He bought up
all the Allies' arms cheap

532
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,924
and now we are terribly
nouveau rich

533
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,760
and when he dies
I shall be extremely wealthy

534
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,460
and he thinks that every man
who makes advances to me

535
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,064
is just after my millions.

536
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,936
There. He forbids you
to have a boyfriend.

537
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,700
Well. Practically.

538
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,741
So you invent him?

539
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,310
Yes, I'm afraid so.

540
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,212
I see.

541
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,847
Poor little rich girl.

542
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,460
I too had a letter today
from your father.

543
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,154
He is coming here
this morning.

544
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,559
Daddy? Coming here?

545
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:28,166
He is coming from Toulon
on business

546
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,802
and when I see him

547
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,738
I will have a little word with him.

548
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,641
He won't listen.

549
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,900
We shall see.

550
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,779
"Attends", my little Isadoras.

551
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,983
Today we dance "Narcissus"

552
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,173
Bless you, "mes enfants".

553
00:47:56,173 --> 00:48:00,177
May the gods pour libations
of happiness in your houses.

554
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,380
Run along, my Isadoras

555
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,383
Madame wishes to meditate.

556
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,190
Really! Thank you.

557
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,900
Here.

558
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:47,024
How do you do, Madame?

559
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,100
How do you do?

560
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:04,542
Monsieur Browne

561
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,612
Or should I say,
"mon petit Percy"?

562
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,282
I don't follow you, Madame.

563
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,000
Mais oui, mon chère,

564
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,423
Do you not remember
your little Kiki?

565
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:24,028
Good heavens!
This is impossible!

566
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:26,597
Most awkward.

567
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:27,898
How could it be?

568
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,902
After all we have been
to each other.

569
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:38,742
Have  you forgotten
Armistice night?

570
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:42,079
Or when you kissed me on

571
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,284
the Champs Elysees.

572
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,319
Yes, Madam.
I have completely forgotten.

573
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,455
Surely not, cheri.

574
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:29,326
I wore a white dress
and you wore in uniform.

575
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:34,932
Later on, I called you
"my pretty private".

576
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:36,500
Then we drank champagne.

577
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,200
Everyone was happy.

578
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,538
Then, two little love birds

579
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,140
flew over our heads.

580
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,185
So, the kid stepped
into the star shoes.

581
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,822
Gosh, Rita, I'm sorry.

582
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,600
Does it hurt?

583
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,200
Of course it hurts.

584
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,462
When someone else
takes your place.

585
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,698
But I could never act
to be another Rita Monroe.

586
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:43,000
No one could, dear. Ever.

587
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,203
But you might just get by.

588
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,405
One day.

589
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,442
Now you're just

590
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,860
a nervous, skinny kid

591
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,348
overwhelmed of the impossibility
of trying to save the show.

592
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,060
And on top of that
you have to face

593
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,460
the bitter disappointment
of all my fans out there

594
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,925
who screamed and saved their pennies
week after week

595
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,760
to come here this afternoon
to see that special kind of magic

596
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,399
that only their Rita
can give them.

597
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:22,139
Do you know your steps?
Show me the Buck & Wing on your first duet.

598
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:29,913
Sorry, Rita.

599
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,400
Fake it. That's what I always did
whenever I was ill.

600
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,955
Chances are they'll never notice.

601
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:41,191
There is that tricky obbligato
in the Pierrette number.

602
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,813
That Parkhill woman is sure
to be singing flat.

603
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,414
They'll never notice.

604
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:07,684
If you do forget your lines,
"ad lib".

605
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,654
It'll destroy the rest of the cast
but at least you won't dry.

606
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,126
Pull yourself together
and don't worry.

607
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,195
We'll find a replacement tomorrow.

608
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:21,100
Now get out there

609
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,200
and be so great

610
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,271
you'll make me hate you.

611
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:29,406
Thank you, Rita
you're really too kind.

612
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:33,677
Sweet.

613
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:39,700
I could be happy with you

614
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:47,658
if you could be happy with me

615
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:01,360
Then, from a little cafe

616
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,575
came the strands of a waltz.

617
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:08,545
How did it go?

618
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:28,532
I still recall so tenderly

619
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:31,068
the night when first we met

620
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:34,660
The memory's so dear to me

621
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,942
So how can you forget?

622
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:47,217
Fancy forgetting

623
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:50,087
the love that we knew

624
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:54,057
When we were fancy free

625
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,528
Fancy forgetting

626
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,265
What I said to you

627
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,902
And what you said to me

628
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:11,475
Though the years go by

629
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:14,444
and our youth is gone

630
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,581
Memories don't die

631
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:22,319
like a song, they linger on

632
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,223
So just when I thought

633
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:30,627
you'd remember it too

634
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,900
Fancy, just fancy you

635
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,772
forgetting

636
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:51,848
I told you I'd play it straight.

637
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,151
Hear him!

638
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,755
I'm really scared now.
I can't remember a thing.

639
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,457
Don't worry.

640
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:06,096
And Pol, don't try
to copy the others.

641
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,732
If you really mean
what you say on the stage

642
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,701
you can't get it wrong.

643
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:13,270
Now depart, dear.

644
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:51,541
Class dismissed.

645
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:57,047
Girls, I know.

646
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,884
Let's go and try on our costumes
before lunch.

647
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,486
Yes!

648
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:04,821
Are you coming too, Polly?

649
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:08,700
I think I'll just stay here.
I'm expecting Daddy any moment.

650
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,495
And aren't you expecting him?

651
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,063
Him?

652
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:14,865
Yes, of course.

653
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,370
Let's leave her, girls.
She wants to be alone.

654
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:22,806
Goodbye.

655
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,000
Excusez-moi!

656
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:33,884
You startled me.

657
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,788
I'm sorry, Miss.
I'm afraid I came in the wrong way.

658
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:41,758
It's the Villa Caprice, isn't it?

659
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:42,759
Yes.

660
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,300
I have a package here
for Miss Polly Browne.

661
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,397
Really? How funny.

662
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,699
Funny? Why?

663
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,469
Because I'm Polly Browne.

664
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,472
It's a very pretty name.

665
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:57,641
Thank you.

666
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,900
And you live up to it.

667
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,360
I'm sorry, Miss.
I'm afraid I'm forgetting myself.

668
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,400
Here is your package.

669
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,821
Oh, thank you.

670
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:15,400
Don't they make a lovely couple?

671
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,400
Sorry.

672
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,200
I packed it myself.

673
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,000
If you don't mind my saying so,
it is a very pretty dress.

674
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,700
Yes, it is, isn't it?

675
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:38,482
I'm sure that you'll...

676
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:42,000
I mean, it will be
the prettiest of the ball.

677
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,821
Oh. I don't expect so, really.

678
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,958
I do. In fact, I know it.

679
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,500
Perhaps I'd better be going.

680
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,500
Yes. Perhaps you had.

681
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,500
Accent! Accent!

682
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:11,500
I say,

683
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,253
You are English, aren't you?

684
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,000
Yes. As a matter of fact I am.

685
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,500
You don't seem like
a messenger boy somehow.

686
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:27,597
To tell you the truth,
I don't usually do this sort of thing

687
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,034
but just at the moment
I'm afraid I'm rather on my beam ends.

688
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:34,004
What a shame.

689
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:45,649
And at carnival time too?

690
00:59:45,649 --> 00:59:47,350
Yes. It's a pity, isn't it?

691
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,800
I was hoping I'd be able
to go to the ball tonight.

692
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,855
I'll be watching.

693
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:52,822
Will you?

694
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,500
Yes, of course.

695
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,300
Why don't you came too?

696
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,100
Me? Come to the ball?

697
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,201
Yes, why not?
I've got an extra ticket…

698
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,539
Oh, dear. You must think me
terribly forward.

699
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,760
No, I don't!

700
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,600
I think you're
terribly, terribly…

701
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,791
I don't claim that I am psychic

702
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:30,527
But one look at you and I kick

703
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:32,896
Away every scruple

704
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:36,933
I learnt as a pupil
In school my dear

705
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:41,238
I'm not one
to make predictions

706
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:44,140
But I've thrown off all restrictions

707
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,000
And don't mind confessing
I think it's a blessing

708
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,500
That you are here

709
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,900
Now  I'm prepared
To find I'm wrong

710
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:05,262
I've got a funny feeling
we belong together

711
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:11,500
I could be happy with you

712
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,073
If you could be happy with me

713
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:24,780
I'd be contented
to live anywhere

714
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,400
What would I care

715
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,520
as long as you are there

716
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:38,360
Skies may not always be blue

717
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:43,333
But one thing is clear as can be

718
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:50,960
I know that I could be happy
with you, my darling

719
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,900
if you could be happy with…

720
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,316
Then you will come
to the ball?

721
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,151
Well, I'll try.

722
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,920
I'll have to see about a costume.

723
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,000
There is a Pierrot's costume
at Gaston's.

724
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,258
Couldn't you borrow it?

725
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:10,193
I'll see.

726
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,129
How can I let you know?

727
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,400
Let me think.

728
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,635
I'll be on the plage
at 3 o'clock this afternoon,

729
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:21,037
on the Crazy Golf coast.

730
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,172
Goodbye until then.

731
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,879
And I don't even know his name.

732
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,160
Polly, I have a visitor for you.

733
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,760
Daddy, I'm so happy!

734
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,700
Are you, my dear?
I'm glad to hear it.

735
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,960
Has he arrived yet, Polly?

736
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,323
Yes, he's arrived.

737
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,300
He's really arrived.

738
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,300
We're blue without

739
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,000
Can't do without

740
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:56,700
Our dreams just won't
come true without

741
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,877
That certain thing called

742
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:04,700
"the boy friend"

743
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:22,278
In my imagination

744
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,048
I search the star-lit sky so bright

745
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:28,951
In my imagination

746
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:33,122
there I saw you in the night

747
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:36,893
And then one day I found you

748
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,930
How could I help but realise

749
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:44,033
My lucky star was smiling

750
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:49,438
right there before my very eyes

751
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:55,611
You are my lucky star

752
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:57,679
I saw you from afar

753
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:07,290
Two lovely eyes,
 at me they were gleamin',

754
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,626
beamin'

755
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,997
I was star-struck

756
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:20,436
You're all my lucky charms

757
01:12:21,404 --> 01:12:26,609
I'm lucky in your arms

758
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,460
You've opened heaven's portal

759
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,200
Here on earth for this poor mortal

760
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:40,400
You are my lucky star

761
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,200
Je suis vraiment enchanté, Mademoiselle.

762
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,200
Vous étes charmante.

763
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,297
He says you are lovely, darling.

764
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,966
You speak French?

765
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,100
Mais évidemment, Monsieur

766
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,500
J'ai été éduquée au college
de Brighton.

767
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,800
En français, naturellement.

768
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,300
Charmant.

769
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:03,600
Monsieur Max et les autres
vous attendent dans votre loge.

770
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,400
Au revoir, Mademoiselle.

771
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,655
That means
"Good bye, Miss".

772
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,559
She's only an understudy,
not a real actress.

773
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,420
I have a few photographs here
about past successes

774
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,142
that might interest you, Mr. De Thrill.

775
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,378
That's me in the Chinese Bungalow.

776
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:37,146
What have you here?

777
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,815
That's me as Hamlet,
a tragedy.

778
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:42,351
Me in "Luck Of The Navy".

779
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,279
That champagne costs money.

780
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,081
We should be safe in here.

781
01:14:49,385 --> 01:14:50,986
We thought you were with the others.

782
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:56,158
Sorry. Excuse us.

783
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:57,893
Come on, Dulcie.

784
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,300
What a lovely day
What a lovely day

785
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,400
For a dip in the sea

786
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,900
Oh, what fun it will be

787
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,891
Won't you come
and have a swim with me?

788
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,960
But whatever you do
When I'm swimming with you

789
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,364
Please remember not to go too far

790
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,967
Though you may look cute
in your bathing suit

791
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,600
we don't know who you are

792
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,542
There's no knowing
Who you are going to meet

793
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,378
sur la plage

794
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,714
You may run up against a rajah

795
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,750
Or maybe your man

796
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,060
will be a poor man

797
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,160
Sal or Susie,
cannot be choosey

798
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,224
For here love's
a guessing game

799
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,360
sur la plage
sur la plage

800
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,430
Everyone looks the same

801
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:45,534
Hubert! Hubert, what are you doing?

802
01:16:46,402 --> 01:16:48,404
Nothing, my dear,
just admiring the view.

803
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:50,506
So different from Bongor, isn't it?

804
01:16:50,873 --> 01:16:53,375
Much prettier.
I feel 20 years younger.

805
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,078
And behaving accordingly, I notice.

806
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,600
How can you
after our loss?

807
01:17:01,684 --> 01:17:04,920
Hilda, do not dramatise
Tommy isn't dead.

808
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,760
He was off to Nice.

809
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,824
But he hasn't any money.
We must find him.

810
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,659
Do something, Hubert.

811
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:11,760
Very well, my dear.

812
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,869
How dare you?

813
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,400
Stop it.

814
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,647
Sur la plage
Sur la plage

815
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,717
Everyone looks the same

816
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,019
There's no saying
Who may be playing with you

817
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,100
Sur la plage

818
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,325
A knight who's left behind his charger

819
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,093
May call you "ducky"

820
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:20,129
Won't you be lucky?

821
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,760
In the ocean
You'll find emotion

822
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,035
May play you a funny game

823
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:29,900
Sur la plage
sur la plage

824
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,300
Everyone looks the…
Everyone looks the…

825
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,612
Everyone looks the same

826
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,998
What are you wearing that for?
To keep warm in bed?

827
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:58,000
So my own wife
won't recognise me.

828
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,006
There you are!

829
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,742
Did you think I wasn't coming?

830
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,745
Well, I wasn't sure.

831
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:12,400
Where were you ought to have been?

832
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,918
I've seen Monsieur Gaston
about the costume and it's all right.

833
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:19,260
Now I shall really enjoy
the carnival ball.

834
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,600
So shall I.

835
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,060
By Jove!

836
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,200
I never thought I should be going
to it with anyone like you.

837
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,000
Makes me feel rather nervous really.

838
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,101
Nervous. Why?

839
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,400
Me, just a messenger boy and

840
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,900
you, a rich young lady
from The Villa Caprice.

841
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,400
Rich?

842
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,200
I ain't rich.

843
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:46,081
I thought you could tell that
by my accent.

844
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,017
I just work there as

845
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,488
Mme. Dubonnet's secretary.

846
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:55,924
Do you honestly?

847
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,464
Then we're not
so different after all.

848
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,700
I'm so glad.

849
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:14,576
I thought you'd only like
the grand life.

850
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:18,580
You know, big cars,
diamonds and champagne.

851
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,485
I'm quite content
with simple things.

852
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:26,321
How ripping.

853
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,657
So am I.

854
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,803
A life of wealth
Does not appeal to me at all

855
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:42,304
Do you agree at all?

856
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,200
I do.

857
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,800
The mere idea of living in a palace is

858
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,260
So full of fallacies

859
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,080
That's true

860
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:55,918
I've got a very different
sort of scheme in mind

861
01:20:57,019 --> 01:21:00,823
It's just a dream designed for two

862
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:06,495
Would you care to hear about it, dear?

863
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,298
Would I care to?

864
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,669
Can you doubt it, dear?

865
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:17,940
All I want is a room

866
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,109
In Bloomsbury

867
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,047
Just a room that will do

868
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:28,851
For you and me

869
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:33,760
One room's enough for us

870
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,200
Though it's on the top floor

871
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,863
Life may be rough for us

872
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,500
But its troubles we'll ignore

873
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:48,236
While I'm reading a book

874
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:52,508
I'll cook a stew

875
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,600
Then I'll bake a plum duff

876
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,414
Enough for two

877
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,683
You'll be sitting

878
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:03,685
And you'll be knitting

879
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:07,300
And so contented we'll be

880
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:12,160
In our dear little room
in Bloomsbury

881
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:54,643
All we want is a room
in Bloomsbury

882
01:26:55,177 --> 01:26:58,160
Just a room that will do

883
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,760
For you and me

884
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,600
I'll sew the covers for

885
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:08,290
Two old cosy armchairs

886
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,660
Neighbours will love us for

887
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:15,230
We shall laugh at all our cares

888
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,800
From the heavens above

889
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,404
our love will rain

890
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:28,400
such a bundle of joy
our hearts will see

891
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:31,046
Life's so jolly

892
01:27:31,046 --> 01:27:32,700
For me and Polly

893
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:36,184
A happy family are we

894
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,300
All we want is a room
in Bloomsbury

895
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:04,546
Mlle. Browne!

896
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,450
What would Mme. Dubonnet say
if she saw you getting on with a messenger boy?

897
01:28:08,917 --> 01:28:10,886
Please, don't tell her, Hortense.

898
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:13,188
Madame, please.

899
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:15,690
Well. All right.

900
01:28:16,298 --> 01:28:19,928
After all, it is Carnival time!

901
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,300
Hortense!
Was that Mlle. Browne with a boy?

902
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,671
I have no idea.

903
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:33,200
Oh yes, you have.
Go on, Hortense. Do tell.

904
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,800
Is he terribly sleek and handsome?

905
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,680
I do not know
what you are talking about.

906
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,300
Isn't she mean?

907
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,800
If you tell me how he's like
I'll give you that handkerchiefs tasche.

908
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,460
And I'll give you
those crochet flowers.

909
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,500
And we'll give you
a ride in his car.

910
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,800
Taisez-vous, mes enfants!

911
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,360
It is not seemly to be curious
about a young man.

912
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,600
Why not?

913
01:28:57,933 --> 01:29:00,769
Haven't you ever been curious,
Hortense?

914
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:03,939
Hortense, do tell!

915
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,210
Hortense is not so prim
as she pretends.

916
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:12,514
Of course, she isn't.

917
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,417
After all, she is French.

918
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,419
Yes, I am.

919
01:29:17,419 --> 01:29:20,221
How do you say it?
"Not dumb."

920
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:21,289
My wife.

921
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:34,636
And like every good French woman,
I have a past.

922
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:38,373
Do tell us about it, Hortense.

923
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,351
-You're not on in this number.
-I am now, my wife is after me.

924
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,157
I'm often asked
if I would like to travel

925
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,028
And visit other lands
across the sea

926
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,564
but though it might be pleasant

927
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:05,867
I think that for the present

928
01:30:06,368 --> 01:30:09,304
this is the place where I prefer to be

929
01:30:10,305 --> 01:30:14,709
Let others go to Sweden or Siam

930
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:19,881
I think I'll stay exactly where I am

931
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,300
They say it's lovely when a
young lady's in Vienna

932
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,625
but it's nicer, much nicer in Nice

933
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,560
in Amsterdam or Brussels
the men have great big muscles

934
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,898
but they're nicer,
much nicer in Nice

935
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,567
I've heard that the Italians

936
01:30:40,035 --> 01:30:41,669
are very fond of dalliance

937
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:44,706
and they're also keen on it in Greece

938
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:48,200
But whatever they may say
this is where I want to stay

939
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,845
For it's so much nicer in Nice

940
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:53,214
She says it's nicer,
much nicer in Nice

941
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,551
She says it's nicer,
much nicer in Nice

942
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:07,095
Some people's one desire is
to go to Buenos Aires

943
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,000
But it's nicer,
much nicer in Nice

944
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:14,200
The laws are rather vague in
the town of Copenhagen

945
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,571
but they're nicer,
much nicer in Nice

946
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:21,076
And some may like a flutter
in Bombay or Calcutta

947
01:31:21,076 --> 01:31:24,360
But they might have trouble
with the police

948
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,000
O la la!

949
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:28,083
Other places may be fun

950
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:31,719
but when all is said and done

951
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:34,823
it is so much nicer in Nice

952
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:48,103
Do something!

953
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,643
But they might have trouble
with the police

954
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,700
Oh, Mon Dieu

955
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:01,660
Tho' I know a love affair
is delicious anywhere

956
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,700
It is so much nicer in Nice

957
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:46,995
And now I really must go.

958
01:32:47,529 --> 01:32:49,931
Polly, would you kiss me goodbye?

959
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,800
Yes, if you want me to.

960
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,700
Is that all right?

961
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:59,607
Yes, we are perfect.
This is Hollywood after this.

962
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,600
If I just get through the show
it'd be enough for me.

963
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:06,581
It was nice of you
to rehearse with me, Alf. Thanks.

964
01:33:07,215 --> 01:33:09,417
That's alright.
I wish I was playing Tony.

965
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:13,555
I'm glad I couldn't find him.

966
01:33:14,822 --> 01:33:16,257
He seems to avoid me off-stage.

967
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:18,760
Yet he is very kind.

968
01:33:20,562 --> 01:33:21,996
I suppose I'm just not his type.

969
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:25,867
I wonder who he'd really go for.

970
01:33:25,867 --> 01:33:28,603
It seems, believe it or not,
someone like Dulcie.

971
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:37,445
Toots, you're quite a hopper.

972
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:40,100
I have to teach you the double-trip,

973
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,900
Maxie-Ford

974
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,700
with a Knickerbocker break.

975
01:33:47,255 --> 01:33:49,000
That is good!
Where did you learn that?

976
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:52,400
Search me, toots.
As a kid I was kicked in the head.

977
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,396
And what I came to? Amnesia.

978
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:24,900
Percy, Percy,
please, have mercy

979
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,496
Why must you always
be so sad and gloomy?

980
01:34:29,464 --> 01:34:32,700
Why can't you be
a little nicer to me?

981
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:36,900
Cheri, Cheri
please, be merry

982
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,275
When I am trying to be bright
and jolly

983
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:44,812
it isn't nice
to be so melancholy

984
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,700
Oh, dear

985
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,200
I've got the
you-don't-want-to-play-with-me blues

986
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,488
Don't-want-to-play-with-me blues

987
01:34:54,622 --> 01:34:56,190
It's clear

988
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:59,861
I've got the
you-don't-want-to-stay-with-me blues

989
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,163
Don't want to stay with me blues

990
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,535
I am so good

991
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,471
At spreading mirth and joy

992
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:15,476
But it's no good

993
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,680
With such a sulky boy

994
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,860
I try

995
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,400
To play the game
the other fellows all choose

996
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,600
The other fellows all choose

997
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,625
I sigh

998
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,528
Because you always refuse

999
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:39,900
What is a girl to do

1000
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,538
With such a boy as you?

1001
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:47,060
I've got those dreary

1002
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:48,700
weary

1003
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:51,879
You-don't-want-to-play-with-me blues

1004
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,760
She told me she had a headache
before the Charleston

1005
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,300
but she didn't at all.

1006
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,400
I think there's gonna be trouble
with the chums.

1007
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:08,300
Maybe some people don't like
being double-crossed.

1008
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,958
Well, we've got to
look after ourselves.

1009
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:28,910
Maisie!

1010
01:37:31,813 --> 01:37:32,980
Here you are at last.

1011
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:35,283
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1012
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,686
Have you? I've been
for a bathe with Fay.

1013
01:37:39,287 --> 01:37:41,500
Are you sure there wasn't
anybody else with you?

1014
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:42,723
What if there was?

1015
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,861
I can go bathing
with whom I choose.

1016
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,329
I wished you choose me.

1017
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:52,567
You are just a boy.
Maybe I want someone more mature.

1018
01:37:53,768 --> 01:37:55,169
Say your right lines
or shut up.

1019
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:57,839
But Maisie, why?

1020
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,800
Because I want to have
a good time while I'm young.

1021
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:05,880
After all I'm only 17.

1022
01:38:07,515 --> 01:38:09,016
But I can show you a good time.

1023
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:11,552
It's not as if I hadn't got
plenty of cash.

1024
01:38:11,986 --> 01:38:13,154
Money isn't everything

1025
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:15,400
though it certainly helps.

1026
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,800
One more "ad lib" like that, toots,
and you're getting a knuckle sandwich.

1027
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,830
But Maisie, when are you
going to come and see my yacht again?

1028
01:38:23,798 --> 01:38:25,132
You liked that, didn't you?

1029
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:27,702
Yes, it's a very dinky yacht.

1030
01:38:28,703 --> 01:38:30,071
I like yachts.

1031
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,039
Mademoiselle Maisie.

1032
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,600
Alphonse.

1033
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:37,545
You look "ravissant".

1034
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:39,580
Behave yourself or
I'll belt you.

1035
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,182
Just try it,
you little twerp.

1036
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:44,886
Do not forget tonight
she will dance the tango with me.

1037
01:38:44,886 --> 01:38:46,521
Of course not.

1038
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,860
-Maisie!
-Michael!

1039
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:52,800
You look enchanting.
Tonight you and I will dance the two-step.

1040
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:55,700
I can hardly wait.

1041
01:38:56,564 --> 01:38:57,765
Pack it in,
you old cow.

1042
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,834
Droop off,
you faded pansy.

1043
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,760
I too want to dance
with you at the ball.

1044
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:04,960
You beat-up old bag.

1045
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And so you shall.
You bald-headed old lech.

1046
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,579
Maisie, listen to me!

1047
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:12,914
Listen to all of us!

1048
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,260
You are so fascinating.

1049
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:20,160
But it's aggravating

1050
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,360
That you keep us waiting to hear

1051
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,159
which one will be

1052
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:28,763
your favourite he

1053
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,698
You're so very taking

1054
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,660
That our hearts are breaking

1055
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:36,003
So you should be making it clear

1056
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,760
Which one of us

1057
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,611
You rate Alpha plus

1058
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:46,247
Now, listen, boys

1059
01:39:47,882 --> 01:39:50,484
you should recall

1060
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,489
I've often said

1061
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:00,900
I love you all

1062
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:05,300
You love us all?

1063
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:08,202
Yes! I love you all!

1064
01:40:09,904 --> 01:40:12,440
It's time you learnt

1065
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:15,776
That I'm no fool

1066
01:40:16,611 --> 01:40:20,600
Where love's concerned

1067
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:26,300
I stick to this rule

1068
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:36,631
There's safety in numbers

1069
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:39,900
That's what I believe

1070
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:43,300
a girl who's cute
and making loot

1071
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,273
Is never likely to grieve

1072
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:50,144
The lady who slumbers

1073
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:53,114
Is left high and dry

1074
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,900
But I admit
an honest pot

1075
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:00,200
I always bet
on lady luck

1076
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:03,660
There's safety in numbers

1077
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:06,994
And the more the merrier, say I

1078
01:41:08,663 --> 01:41:12,733
You, me, Hollywood.

1079
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,900
Vous avez perdu, Mademoiselle.

1080
01:44:16,517 --> 01:44:17,685
Can you speak French?

1081
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,554
French!

1082
01:44:28,796 --> 01:44:31,165
I think perhaps I'd better
be getting back to the villa.

1083
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:33,667
I have some letters to type.

1084
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:35,569
Do you really
have to go so soon?

1085
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:38,072
Yes, I'm afraid I must.

1086
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,300
But I'll see you tonight, won't I?

1087
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,000
I should jolly well think so.

1088
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:44,178
Where shall I meet you?

1089
01:44:44,178 --> 01:44:45,746
I don't know. You say.

1090
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:49,550
How about the ball at 9 o'clock.

1091
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,319
Lovely. I shall be waiting.

1092
01:44:53,888 --> 01:44:54,760
Oh, dear.

1093
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,900
Tonight seems
a very long time away.

1094
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:59,760
It's not really.
Just a few hours.

1095
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:04,064
And it's gonna be a wonderful evening,
isn't it, Polly?

1096
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,634
Yes, I'm sure it is, Tony.

1097
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,338
But it's just the first
of lots of wonderful evenings.

1098
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:14,975
Yes. At least I expect so.

1099
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:17,611
But why shouldn't it be?

1100
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,614
I meant what I said this morning.

1101
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:22,560
What did you say?

1102
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:27,900
I could be happy with you

1103
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:34,428
if you could be happy with me

1104
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:40,160
I'd be contented

1105
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,703
to live anywhere

1106
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:46,106
What would I care

1107
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:50,511
As long as you are there?

1108
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:56,800
Skies may not always be blue

1109
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:03,522
but one thing is clear
as can be

1110
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:14,400
I know that I could be happy with you,
my darling

1111
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:20,031
if you could be happy with…

1112
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:22,600
No, Tony. I really must go.

1113
01:46:25,546 --> 01:46:26,714
Would you...

1114
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:30,600
-Will you kiss me goodbye?
-Yes. If you want me to.

1115
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,026
Have you decided?

1116
01:46:40,027 --> 01:46:42,329
I love you.

1117
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:44,565
Good.

1118
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:47,501
Gosh!

1119
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:49,570
Look! It's Tony!

1120
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:51,160
I've got to hop it. Quickly.

1121
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,300
But what's the matter?

1122
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,707
Stop him.

1123
01:46:53,707 --> 01:46:55,509
You there! Gendarme!

1124
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:58,500
Gendarme! Stop him!

1125
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:01,348
The police? Surely not.

1126
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:04,900
Alphonse, tell me quickly.
Who are that lady and gentleman?

1127
01:47:05,152 --> 01:47:08,889
The rich Milord Brockhurst and his wife.
They seem to be chasing a thief.

1128
01:47:09,656 --> 01:47:11,500
A thief? Oh, no!

1129
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:13,500
It couldn't be.

1130
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:17,831
And yet they are rich
and he is penniless.

1131
01:47:18,832 --> 01:47:20,300
He told me so himself.

1132
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,169
Oh, dear.

1133
01:47:22,936 --> 01:47:25,773
He must have known all along
that I'm not a working girl

1134
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:28,275
but a millionaire's daughter.

1135
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:30,411
Oh, dear.

1136
01:47:35,082 --> 01:47:36,550
He's just like all the rest.

1137
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:40,354
Did he steal something from you?

1138
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:41,900
Yes, he did.

1139
01:47:43,157 --> 01:47:45,325
Not your gold bangle!

1140
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:48,262
No. Not my gold bangle.

1141
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,398
Something much more precious.

1142
01:47:51,398 --> 01:47:55,069
What is it, ma petite?
You look like pale.

1143
01:47:55,436 --> 01:47:58,272
I can explain, Madame.
That man was Monsieur...

1144
01:47:58,272 --> 01:47:59,473
No, Hortense!

1145
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,308
-What is it?
-You promised.

1146
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:03,810
It's nothing, Madame.

1147
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:07,200
I'm just a little
disappointed, that's all.

1148
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:12,600
I shan't be going
to the carnival ball after all.

1149
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:26,500
I could be happy with you

1150
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:34,100
if you could be happy with me

1151
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:43,900
I'd be contented
to live anywhere

1152
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:48,000
What would I care

1153
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,700
as long as you are there

1154
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:59,800
Skies may not always be blue

1155
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:04,200
But one thing is clear as can be

1156
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:09,300
I know that I could be happy
with you, my darling

1157
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:14,200
if you could be happy with me

1158
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:49,883
Just slip down to the Cadena Cafe
and get me the Ivy Perkins Trio.

1159
01:49:49,883 --> 01:49:51,860
It's nearly teatime, Mr. Max,
they may be playing.

1160
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:53,500
Then get me the best musicians
in the town.

1161
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,000
There are no good musicians
in this town.

1162
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:56,957
Then get me anybody!

1163
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:06,207
Voulez vous filmer avec moi?
Oh, Hollywood!

1164
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,900
-No. "Ollywood".
-"Ollywood"?

1165
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:13,207
They jump the "H" in France.

1166
01:50:14,208 --> 01:50:18,160
-What's the matter, Pol?
-Nothing.

1167
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,800
I got something in my eye,
that's all.

1168
01:50:20,047 --> 01:50:22,382
Don't worry, Polly.
It weren't that bad.

1169
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:27,621
The dog, in life
man's firmest friend

1170
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:33,160
is woman's consolation
in the end.

1171
01:50:33,927 --> 01:50:34,561
Very nice.

1172
01:50:36,096 --> 01:50:36,797
Where is he?

1173
01:50:37,564 --> 01:50:38,265
Who?

1174
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,500
De Thrill! I invited him
round of drinks in the green room.

1175
01:50:42,035 --> 01:50:43,403
Perhaps he is colour-blind.

1176
01:50:44,271 --> 01:50:45,906
Very funny.
You should be on the stage.

1177
01:50:47,241 --> 01:50:49,700
You are supposed
to be an old man.

1178
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,980
So why do you keep
dying your white hair black?

1179
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:56,149
My public wouldn't recognize me
from my photograph in the feuillet.

1180
01:50:56,516 --> 01:50:57,618
No, I suppose they wouldn't.

1181
01:50:58,986 --> 01:51:00,500
It's so yellow with age.

1182
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,756
You'll have to make up
as Chinese!

1183
01:51:02,756 --> 01:51:04,691
Jealousy will get you nowhere.

1184
01:51:05,459 --> 01:51:06,860
Is that my Melba spray

1185
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,595
you are using
on the wretched dog?

1186
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:09,900
She is not a dog!

1187
01:51:10,797 --> 01:51:12,900
She is a King Charles!

1188
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,502
Name dropping again.
Help me with my spats, woman.

1189
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,640
"Sharp point"

1190
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,100
He is thinking of turning the show
into a film.

1191
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:26,513
Hurry up!

1192
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,600
"Sharp point, heap bath, lamp oil"

1193
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,288
Did you blanch them?

1194
01:51:35,322 --> 01:51:36,456
Of course.

1195
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:18,031
When every day begins,

1196
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:23,003
when every day is done,

1197
01:52:24,971 --> 01:52:27,100
here in my heart

1198
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:29,876
never to part

1199
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,900
you’ll always be the one

1200
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:40,721
All I do the whole night through

1201
01:52:41,655 --> 01:52:43,724
is dream of you

1202
01:52:45,359 --> 01:52:48,528
with the dawn I still go on

1203
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,964
and dream of you

1204
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:55,802
you're every thought
you're every thing

1205
01:52:55,802 --> 01:52:59,840
you're every song
I ever sing

1206
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:03,700
summer, winter

1207
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:06,300
autumn, and spring

1208
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:10,960
And were there more
than twenty-four

1209
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,553
hours a day

1210
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:18,860
they’d be spent in sweet content

1211
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:21,228
dreaming away

1212
01:53:22,429 --> 01:53:25,799
when skies are grey
when skies are blue

1213
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,703
morning, noon, and nighttime too

1214
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:33,300
all I do the whole day through

1215
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:37,210
is dream of you

1216
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:42,282
This way, gentlemen.

1217
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:47,700
What's this?
Frank Connaugh's army?

1218
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:49,700
Where is the Ivy Perkins Trio?

1219
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,100
But you did say "get anyone".

1220
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:53,500
And I was thrown out of the Cadena Cafe
for soliciting.

1221
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,730
They mustn't be seen.
They'll have to play in a recumbent position.

1222
01:53:57,364 --> 01:53:59,300
Let's pray for an upstage wind.

1223
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:01,334
Nothing must distract De Thrill
from my performance.

1224
01:54:01,468 --> 01:54:04,800
That goes to you too, Miss.
You just sit still and give me my cues.

1225
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:07,000
And I might take you
to Hollywood with me.

1226
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,900
Bonsoir, ma petite.

1227
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,053
You startled me.

1228
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:23,200
You are English!
I thought you were French.

1229
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,900
Did you honestly?

1230
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,200
Well, I'm not.

1231
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,200
I didn't mean to be rude.

1232
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:33,200
That's all right. It's just that

1233
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:35,368
I'm rather fed up with France.

1234
01:54:36,102 --> 01:54:38,360
I can't imagine
a pretty little thing like you

1235
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,000
be fed up with anything.

1236
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:41,575
Well, I am.

1237
01:54:41,575 --> 01:54:44,811
And not just with France.

1238
01:54:44,811 --> 01:54:46,513
I also had enough of boys.

1239
01:54:47,514 --> 01:54:48,515
Boys?

1240
01:54:48,515 --> 01:54:51,284
Why not try
something older?

1241
01:54:52,219 --> 01:54:54,354
Something older?

1242
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,760
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1243
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:08,100
You are supposed
to be a nurse, not a tart.

1244
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:12,506
Something older
like me for instance.

1245
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,600
I may be too old to run a mile

1246
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:18,600
-Run a mile?
-Yes, run a mile

1247
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:22,300
But there's one thing
I still do very well

1248
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,920
I may be too old to climb a stile

1249
01:55:27,721 --> 01:55:30,590
-Climb a stile?
-Yes, climb a stile.

1250
01:55:31,358 --> 01:55:35,195
But there's one thing
at which I still excel

1251
01:55:37,063 --> 01:55:40,267
Although my hair is turning grey

1252
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,537
Yes, it's rather grey!

1253
01:55:44,704 --> 01:55:48,375
I still believe it when I say

1254
01:55:48,909 --> 01:55:53,179
Well, what do you say?

1255
01:55:54,714 --> 01:55:57,300
It's never too late to have a fling

1256
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:00,300
For Autumn is just as nice as Spring

1257
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:03,823
And it's never too late to fall in love

1258
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:06,100
Boop-a-Doop, Boop-a-Doop, Boop-a-Doop

1259
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:09,429
It's never too late to wink an eye

1260
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:12,360
I'll do it until the day I die

1261
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,960
And it's never too late to fall in love

1262
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,200
Boop-a-Doop, Boop-a-Doop, Boop-a-Doop

1263
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,000
If they say I'm too old for you

1264
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:23,743
Then I shall answer "Why, sir,

1265
01:56:23,743 --> 01:56:26,813
One never drinks the wine that's new

1266
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,783
The old wine tastes much nicer"

1267
01:56:30,617 --> 01:56:32,586
A gentleman never feels too weak

1268
01:56:32,586 --> 01:56:35,822
To pat a pink arm or pinch a cheek

1269
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:39,392
And it's never too late
to fall in love

1270
01:56:39,392 --> 01:56:40,594
Sez who? Sez me

1271
01:56:41,161 --> 01:56:42,395
Sez you? Sez we.

1272
01:56:42,395 --> 01:56:44,598
Sez both of us together

1273
01:56:45,298 --> 01:56:47,634
It's never too late to whisper words

1274
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,470
Concerning the ways of bees and birds

1275
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:54,060
And it's never too late to fall in love

1276
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:56,300
-Whack-a-do, Whack-a-do, Whack-a-do
-Push me back!

1277
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:58,979
It's never too late to flirt and spoon

1278
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:02,382
A fiddle that's old is more in tune

1279
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:05,560
And it's never too late to fall in love

1280
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:08,300
Whack-a-do, Whack-a-do, Whack-a-do

1281
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:11,358
The modern artists of today

1282
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,560
May paint their pictures faster

1283
01:57:14,127 --> 01:57:17,000
But when it comes to skill, I say

1284
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:19,299
You can't beat an old master

1285
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:22,902
It's never too late to bill and coo

1286
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:25,472
At any age one and one make two

1287
01:57:25,805 --> 01:57:28,000
And it's never too late to fall in

1288
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,900
Never too late to fall in

1289
01:57:31,878 --> 01:57:36,650
Never too late to fall in
Love

1290
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:52,532
Ladies and gentlemen

1291
01:57:53,366 --> 01:57:55,100
I proudly present

1292
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:58,200
my latest
cinematographic fantasy

1293
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,573
for the cinema screen
entitled:

1294
01:58:01,207 --> 01:58:03,543
"Beauty and the wheelchair"

1295
01:58:51,891 --> 01:58:53,660
It's never too late to blow a kiss

1296
01:58:54,527 --> 01:58:55,762
Especially at a time like this

1297
01:58:56,196 --> 01:58:59,065
And it's never too late to fall in love

1298
01:59:01,601 --> 01:59:04,170
It's never too late for fun and larks

1299
01:59:05,071 --> 01:59:07,006
A jolly old flame has lots of sparks

1300
01:59:07,807 --> 01:59:10,343
It's never too late
to fall in love

1301
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:13,200
Vo-de-o, Vo-de-o, Vo-de-o

1302
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:15,648
The modern buildings that you see

1303
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:18,651
Are often most alarming

1304
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:21,454
But I am sure that you'll agree

1305
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:24,357
-A ruin
-can be charming

1306
01:59:24,357 --> 01:59:26,626
There's dog's dirt
all over your spat, Sir.

1307
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:57,090
Forgive the outrage, Mr. De Thrill.
The girl has lost her senses.

1308
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:59,360
She is dismissed.

1309
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,661
She can pack her bags
and leave at the end of the week.

1310
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:02,700
She's fired.

1311
02:00:03,062 --> 02:00:04,664
You've had your chance
and you've lost it.

1312
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:19,600
So she came to the ball
after all.

1313
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:23,016
Poor child.
How sad she looks.

1314
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:26,186
Let me talk to her, mon vieux.

1315
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:28,888
I know how she is feeling.

1316
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:31,858
We all missed you like mad.

1317
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:33,560
Didn't we, chaps?

1318
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:35,295
Yes, we did, Polly.

1319
02:00:36,696 --> 02:00:38,331
Polly. You'll never guess
what's happened to us.

1320
02:00:39,699 --> 02:00:42,135
We've all been proposed to.

1321
02:00:42,502 --> 02:00:44,304
But we haven't been accepted yet.

1322
02:00:44,304 --> 02:00:48,107
We are letting them know at midnight.

1323
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:52,400
Polly, what a shame.
Your fellow turned out to be a…

1324
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:54,781
A rotter and a cad.

1325
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:00,119
You do not wish to dance, Polly?

1326
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:04,490
Until I dance with him, Madame,
I will never dance again.

1327
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:06,059
Never mind.

1328
02:01:07,393 --> 02:01:09,329
The night is still young.

1329
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:14,901
You know, Polly,

1330
02:01:16,169 --> 02:01:18,705
when I look at you
in that sweet costume

1331
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:21,608
you remind me

1332
02:01:22,742 --> 02:01:24,744
of a song I once knew.

1333
02:01:25,178 --> 02:01:25,879
Do I, madam?

1334
02:01:27,046 --> 02:01:28,114
Can you sing it?

1335
02:01:28,915 --> 02:01:29,883
Yes, I think so.

1336
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,989
There is an old French legend

1337
02:01:36,789 --> 02:01:38,691
that's set to an old French tune.

1338
02:01:39,726 --> 02:01:41,628
It tells how Pierrot
loved Pierrette

1339
02:01:42,528 --> 02:01:44,230
under the summer moon

1340
02:01:45,465 --> 02:01:47,734
Every night the lovers meet

1341
02:01:47,734 --> 02:01:49,936
just as the clock strikes nine

1342
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:54,107
Then he gives her kisses sweet

1343
02:01:54,107 --> 02:01:58,912
As vintage wine

1344
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,283
But alas, one fateful night

1345
02:02:04,617 --> 02:02:06,719
Pierrette is forsworn

1346
02:02:08,087 --> 02:02:10,290
There she stand, forlorn

1347
02:02:10,957 --> 02:02:13,493
till the cold grey dawn

1348
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:17,430
Poor little Pierrette

1349
02:02:18,598 --> 02:02:19,933
Where's your Pierrot?

1350
02:02:21,434 --> 02:02:24,270
Why are you all alone?

1351
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:30,276
You should be so fancy-free

1352
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:33,646
Your heart should be high

1353
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,849
But instead
You hang your head

1354
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,886
And try not to cry

1355
02:02:42,088 --> 02:02:44,457
Poor little Pierrette

1356
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:47,026
You must not show

1357
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:52,565
Your dream of love has flown

1358
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:57,370
Just keep on dancing

1359
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,707
Till the dawn, and then

1360
02:03:02,275 --> 02:03:06,045
He may come back again

1361
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:11,400
Poor little Pierrette

1362
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:14,000
Where's your Pierrot?

1363
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:19,800
Why are you all alone?

1364
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:22,900
You should be so fancy-free

1365
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:26,200
Your heart should be high

1366
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:29,400
But instead
You hang your head

1367
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:33,400
And try not to cry

1368
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:36,700
Poor little Pierrette

1369
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:39,800
You must not show

1370
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:45,700
Your dream of love has flown

1371
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:49,000
Just keep on dancing

1372
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:53,200
Till the dawn, and then

1373
02:03:53,240 --> 02:04:03,500
He may come back again

1374
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:08,574
May I have this dance?

1375
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:11,778
I'm afraid I can't dance
with a stranger.

1376
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:13,813
But I am Pierrot.

1377
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:16,082
You are Pierrette.

1378
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:18,451
Surely we are not strangers.

1379
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:20,153
But I don't know who you are.

1380
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:23,156
Maybe this will remind you.

1381
02:04:26,392 --> 02:04:28,294
It isn't. It can't be.

1382
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:29,829
Yes, it's me!

1383
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:31,000
Tony!

1384
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34,534
Polly!

1385
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:43,042
Dulcie and I made it between us
during the show.

1386
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:46,700
"Happy first night"

1387
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:49,549
"I love you. Tony"

1388
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,087
Blow it out.

1389
02:04:57,657 --> 02:04:58,691
Thank you.

1390
02:05:03,196 --> 02:05:04,297
Hubert, it's Tony!

1391
02:05:05,331 --> 02:05:06,699
We find him at last!

1392
02:05:08,334 --> 02:05:09,202
My son!

1393
02:05:09,202 --> 02:05:10,002
Mother!

1394
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:14,207
Father!

1395
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:18,344
And whom, may I ask,
is this young man?

1396
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,900
This, Sir, is my son,
the honourable Tony Brockhurst.

1397
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:26,519
The honourable Tony Brockhurst?

1398
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:32,425
I'm afraid I'm not
a messenger boy after all.

1399
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:34,994
Can you forgive me?

1400
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:37,063
Yes, of course.

1401
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:41,000
And who, may I ask,
is this young woman?

1402
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:44,871
That, Madame, is my daughter.

1403
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,341
And I am Percival Browne.

1404
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:51,844
Not Percival Browne
the millionaire.

1405
02:05:52,979 --> 02:05:54,747
I'm afraid I deceived you too.

1406
02:05:55,615 --> 02:05:57,083
I'm not secretary after all.

1407
02:05:58,518 --> 02:05:59,685
Can you forgive me?

1408
02:06:00,853 --> 02:06:02,855
Of course, my darling.

1409
02:06:04,924 --> 02:06:07,727
It seems that love
is in the air tonight.

1410
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:09,228
It is indeed.

1411
02:06:10,096 --> 02:06:12,732
I too, Polly, have some news.

1412
02:06:12,732 --> 02:06:14,901
Have you, Daddy? How thrilling.

1413
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:17,270
May I tell her, Kiki?

1414
02:06:17,937 --> 02:06:21,374
Of course.
She should be the first to know.

1415
02:06:22,742 --> 02:06:23,342
Very well, then. Polly,

1416
02:06:24,243 --> 02:06:26,612
Mme Dubonnet has consented

1417
02:06:27,446 --> 02:06:29,782
to become my wife.

1418
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:35,087
Maisie, it's midnight.
Have you thought it over?

1419
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:36,756
-And you?
-And you?

1420
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:40,092
After due consideration

1421
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:43,160
we have come to the conclusion

1422
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:46,599
that the answer is unanimously

1423
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,100
Yes!

1424
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:50,500
Swell!

1425
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,800
Where should we go for the honeymoon?

1426
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,400
The Riviera.

1427
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:56,709
Whenever you want,
Mr. De Thrill.

1428
02:06:57,500 --> 02:06:58,900
Background action!

1429
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:00,300
Stand behind!

1430
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:03,860
Wriggle your hips and kick up your heels
you'll be surprised how lovely it feels

1431
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:06,586
Everybody's doing the Riviera

1432
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:11,090
Wiggle your fingers, wiggle your toes
Just how it started nobody knows

1433
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:13,726
Everybody's doing the Riviera

1434
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:18,100
Multi Millionaires
and their little pets do it

1435
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,766
Even maiden ladies
who wear lorgnettes

1436
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:22,460
have taken to it

1437
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:26,160
Tell everyone to give out the news
this is the way to shake off the blues

1438
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:28,800
Everybody's doing the Riviera

1439
02:07:30,643 --> 02:07:31,978
Wait on the set, everybody!

1440
02:07:35,915 --> 02:07:38,150
Get on the dance floor

1441
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:41,420
get in the swing

1442
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:43,489
this is the time for

1443
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:45,992
having a fling

1444
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:52,500
Everybody's doing the Riviera

1445
02:07:54,634 --> 02:07:57,700
Clap-a your hands
and slap on your thighs

1446
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:00,400
Grin like a goon
and roll up your eyes

1447
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:04,577
Everybody's doing the Riviera

1448
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:10,200
All the bright young things
and their bright young beaux do it

1449
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:14,900
Even duchesses and their gigolos
have taken to it

1450
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:17,300
Ain't it terrific? Ain't it the top?

1451
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:19,892
You gotta dance right on till you drop

1452
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,728
Everybody's doing the Riviera

1453
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:23,560
I know that I could be happy

1454
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:27,093
with you, my darling

1455
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:46,545
If you could be happy

1456
02:09:46,545 --> 02:09:51,000
with me

1457
02:10:53,045 --> 02:10:55,047
Well done. You saved the show.

1458
02:10:55,047 --> 02:10:56,482
A star is born.

1459
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:59,000
You're welcome to be the star
of a crummy show like this.

1460
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:01,620
You can understudy
my part tonight, deary.

1461
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:04,560
The public liked you,
De Thrill liked you. I liked you.

1462
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:05,960
You can stay on
for another week.

1463
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,100
-At double salary, of course.
-We'll discuss that later.

1464
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:11,931
We'll discuss the young lady now
if you don't mind.

1465
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:15,100
She is a Jonah.
I've never known of a force like it!

1466
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:18,500
Ad-libing at stage,
a family row on stage!

1467
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:21,807
Cakes and __.

1468
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:25,400
My professional career
in tatters!

1469
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:28,800
A hard-earned reputation
ruined!

1470
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:30,900
And it all started with her!

1471
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:33,419
Either she goes
or I go.

1472
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:34,860
That's easily settled.

1473
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:37,656
I've been thinking for some time
of taking over your part.

1474
02:11:37,656 --> 02:11:41,200
I'm really miscast as
Lord Brockhurst. Far too young.

1475
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:44,263
Pay no attention to him, Mr. Max.
He is rather overwrought this afternoon.

1476
02:11:44,263 --> 02:11:47,166
Don't bother me now.
De Thrill and I have things…

1477
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:54,000
Bonjour, Monsieur.
Voulez vous filmer avec moi?

1478
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:58,400
Das ist für Fräulein Polly.

1479
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:01,800
For Polly.
Can't you speak German?

1480
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:03,883
German?

1481
02:12:08,087 --> 02:12:09,688
I think I will make

1482
02:12:12,291 --> 02:12:13,726
"Singin' in the rain"

1483
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:22,500
I'll send you a postcard
from Hollywood, chaps.

1484
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:31,400
That'll make you a
lovely smelling lady in Christendom.

1485
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:39,645
Just rehearsing.

1486
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:13,000
Wait. Wait. Look!

1487
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,900
You know the double-trip Maxie Ford
with a Knickerbocker break!

1488
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:29,000
Well, I taught it to you.

1489
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:30,800
-I thought you were dead!
-I thought you were dead!

1490
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:32,865
-No, I lost my memory.
-No, I was interned.

1491
02:14:32,865 --> 02:14:35,200
-Pop?
-My son!

1492
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:39,238
I can't believe it.

1493
02:14:40,906 --> 02:14:41,740
Mr. De Thrill…

1494
02:14:42,608 --> 02:14:44,510
It's all a game.
Goodbye, Miss.

1495
02:14:45,411 --> 02:14:47,079
I hope your headache gets better!

1496
02:14:56,388 --> 02:14:57,456
Goodbye!

1497
02:15:11,637 --> 02:15:13,005
From De thrill.

1498
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:17,042
What does he say?

1499
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:19,500
Nothing.

1500
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:21,780
Come on. Let me look.

1501
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:24,300
Gosh!

1502
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:26,200
He wants you to go to Hollywood.

1503
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,200
Should I help you pack?

1504
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,393
No. Let's go find
that room in Bloomsbury.

1505
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:39,400
I think I'll take the cloth.

1506
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:43,140
Like to bet on your first customers?
