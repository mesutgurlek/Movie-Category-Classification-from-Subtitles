I'm bored.

16
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,240
Ladi, I am at a loss.

17
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,158
Brittany, please remind me

18
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:10,477
of how I single-handedly
put cheerleading on the map.

19
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,313
In 1979, you directed
a made-for-TV movie

20
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,082
about the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders

21
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,134
<i>called The Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.</i>

22
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,318
That is correct.

23
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,320
And in the meantime, what's changed?

24
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,988
Personal grooming habits?

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,708
What's changed is I have
completely lost interest.

26
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,511
And ladies, I blame you.

27
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:28,896
Becky- more
silicone falsies.

28
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,931
Got it, Coach.

29
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:32,432
You will each enhance your
bust with an additional

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,550
pair of chicken cutlets,

31
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,219
in an attempt to add some jiggle

32
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:39,323
to what is the most boring
routine I have ever witnessed.

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,342
But Coach Sylvester, this
is the most elaborate routine

34
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,427
the Cheerios! have ever done.

35
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:44,895
We're shoo-ins at Regionals next week,

36
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,630
and we're the favorite
to win at Nationals.

37
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:50,450
And yet I am still so very bored.

38
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:54,738
Even things I used to
think were hilarious...

39
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,323
Case in point.

40
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:59,042
Sandbags, slap yourself
with a chicken cutlet.

41
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,963
Now slap Brittany.

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,048
See? Not even a chuckle.

43
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,667
The problem is you keep trying

44
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:07,751
to make a bigger and bigger spectacle.

45
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,837
No matter how hard we try,

46
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,705
we can't make a routine
work unless you find a way

47
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,307
to make it interesting for you.

48
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:15,492
You have to find a way to top yourself.

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,011
Q, you just may have a point.

50
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:22,499
But to be sure, slap yourself
with a chicken cutlet.

52
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:35,562
All right, I just want to take a minute

53
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,915
to tell you guys how proud of you I am.

54
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,900
We didn't even have to win this game

55
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,586
to go to championship next
week, but nobody took it off.

56
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,038
When we take a knee, we're
gonna finish first in conference

57
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,373
for the first time in McKinley history.

58
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:48,091
Football is back, bitches!

59
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,745
Maybe we should all break
out into a song after we win.

60
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,747
Hey, shut it, Karofsky. No fricking way.

61
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,849
I figure if I stay on
you, you'll run away

62
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:56,850
like your little butt buddy Hummel.

63
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:58,268
That's funny, Karofsky,

64
00:02:58,353 --> 00:02:59,920
how you're calling
everybody gay all the time,

65
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,438
but you never seem to have a girlfriend.

66
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:06,310
It's okay. It's okay.

67
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,945
I really hope that linebacker
doesn't get the jump on me.

68
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:11,097
I bet it would hurt like
hell to get sacked by him.

69
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,153
Break! TEAM: Break!

70
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:19,623
All right.

71
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,708
Slow left on one.

72
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:23,493
Ready? Break! TEAM: Break!

73
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,212
Come on, boys. Let's go.

74
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,174
Down!

75
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,291
Set!

76
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,594
Whoo!

77
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,098
(growlin

78
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:46,600
Hut!

79
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:58,812
Nice hands.

80
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,451
What a joke.

81
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:06,003
What the hell happened?!

82
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:07,621
Finn, you're the captain, talk!

83
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,155
Karofsky sucks, that's what happened!

84
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,258
That's crap! Hudson's a frickin' girl

85
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,460
and couldn't take a joke
about his precious Glee Club.

86
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:15,462
Because I'm sick of you guys
getting down on us for it.

87
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:17,330
We're in Glee Club. What's the big deal?

88
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,499
It's embarrassing! We're dudes!

89
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,817
Getting all hot and bothered

90
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,670
about singing a Ke$ha
song? It's freakin' weird.

91
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,855
Yeah? Well, maybe
you'll think it's cooler

92
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,139
when I go all TiK ToK on your face.

93
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,274
Bring it, Puckerman.

94
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,179
That's enough! That's enough!

95
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,116
Championship game or not,
I am not blocking for him.

96
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:38,402
Get the hell out of here!

97
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,486
Fine! Go!

98
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:41,154
Good! Bunch of babies!

99
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:48,095
<i>Dear Journal, I am in crisis.</i>

100
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,880
<i>Not even the can't-lose combination</i>

101
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:52,699
<i>of boobs and fire can
get me going anymore.</i>

102
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,302
<i>Is it the raccoon hormones
my new doctor gave me?</i>

103
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,887
<i>Maybe.</i>

104
00:04:56,971 --> 00:05:00,223
<i>Here I am, 31, and already a legend.</i>

105
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:03,226
<i>What do I do as a second act?</i>

106
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,762
<i>I'm simply at a loss. Last week,</i>

107
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,849
<i>I even took to modifying
my own flawless form</i>

108
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,901
<i>just to feel something. Wait.</i>

109
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:14,821
It's Syv-lester,
right? Sue Syv-lester?

110
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,556
<i>How do I make things interesting again?</i>

111
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,659
<i>How do I get those juices flowing?</i>

112
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,204
That's it.

113
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:41,765
This here is the A950.

114
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:44,434
You say this could shoot
someone across a football field?

115
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,271
Several football fields, if
you pack in enough explosives.

116
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:52,192
Of course, that would
be incredibly unsafe.

117
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,095
See, if you want to go for
more than, say, 50 yards,

118
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,598
you're looking about a 70% chance

119
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,817
of catastrophic failure.

120
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:05,038
Which is a 30% chance
of catastrophic success.

121
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:06,873
This is the button,
right? No, no, no, no!

122
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,470
You know, I try to make it a habit

123
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:23,173
of not touching carny folk, but fella...

124
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,391
I'll take it.

125
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,842
You got a smaller one?

126
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,844
I'll check stock.

127
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,964
I'm back.

128
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,349
So I was going through my bucket list

129
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,850
and I noticed you were
the only Glee loser

130
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,735
that I haven't slushied yet.

131
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:36,903
Damn near broke his heart.

132
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,271
Well, what about the moral implications

133
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,639
of abusing a kid in a wheelchair?

134
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,857
I say, equal opportunity for all.

135
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,534
This stuff between the
jocks and the Glee Club

136
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,702
has been going on since I
started running the club.

137
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,504
Maybe.

138
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,790
It just seems like it's
so much worse right now.

139
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:59,960
I've won division championships
at three different schools.

140
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:02,546
You have to understand
what winning means

141
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,680
to a community. Grades go up,

142
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:06,833
the streets are
cleaner, crime goes down.

143
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,186
It's a sense of pride, of unity.

144
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,138
And this school deserves that.

145
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:12,806
And you are going to get it for us.

146
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,841
I mean, you won almost
every game this year.

147
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,226
Winning conference was easy.

148
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,812
The team we're up
against for championship-

149
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:20,197
they're much better than us.

150
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:23,016
If you don't have thtalent,
you re on the chemistry.

151
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,451
They don't have to like each other,

152
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,369
but they have to respect each other.

153
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:28,004
This whole thing is just so weird.

154
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,956
I mean, half of your
starters are in my Glee Club.

155
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,441
I just don't know what to do.

156
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,094
Do you trust me?

157
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:36,062
You're not going to try
and kiss me again, are you?

158
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,181
If you trust me,

159
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:41,518
I think I know a way to
get your team united again.

160
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:42,519
Really fast.

161
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:44,321
Oh, my
God- Artie!

162
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:47,107
It was awful.

163
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:48,191
That's it! Screw rehearsal!

164
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,443
This ends here and now.

165
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:52,829
We're gonna go all
Thunderdome on those guys.

166
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:56,533
So this is what the ladies
lounge looks like on the inside.

167
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:57,951
This is the choir room.
Now, put up your fists

168
00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:58,952
because you and I are
going to do some dancing.

169
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:01,004
No, I got this, Sam.

170
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:02,756
Coach Beiste told us
to come. Where is she?

171
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:05,491
Watch it. Everyone, have a seat.

172
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:06,626
You, too, guys.

173
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,494
All right, New Directions!,

174
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:11,131
let's give a warm welcome to
the newest members of Glee Club.

175
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,050
Oh, hell to the no, Mr. Shue.

176
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:15,936
Hey! Come on!

177
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:17,470
Guys! Hey!

178
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:18,855
Are you serious? These are the
guys that made Kurt transfer.

179
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,640
And there's no way that
I'm sharing the choir room

180
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,025
with a known homophobe.

181
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:23,894
I don't disagree with you guys.

182
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,362
But I talked to Coach Beiste about it,

183
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:27,981
and she and I both agreed
that the kind of bullying

184
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:29,449
that David does is
born out of ignorance.

185
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,452
Having him in here, as
difficult as it may be for us,

186
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,739
is an opportunity to show
him and the rest of the guys

187
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,040
that being in Glee
Club is kind of cool-

188
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:40,043
find some common ground.

189
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:41,527
All of you are going to be in
this Glee Club for one week,

190
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,046
no exceptions.

191
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,465
She's bluffing- next week
is the championship game.

192
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:46,666
Without us, shhas no team.

193
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,251
With you, I have no team!

194
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:50,670
You guys have gotta find
a way to come together

195
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,555
or we're going to get
our asses kicked from here

196
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,507
until Tuesday finds a
saddlebag full of buckwheat.

197
00:08:57,261 --> 00:08:59,379
If I have to stay, I'm
not singing no show tunes.

198
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,981
That is the music of my oppressors.

199
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:02,933
Do you even have any
idea what we do in here?

200
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,768
No. None of them do.

201
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:06,653
We have to show them.

202
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,355
Rachel, Puck, haven't you
guys been working on something?

203
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:09,823
Why don't you give it a whirl?

204
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,409
Fine. As offended as I
am by their presence here,

205
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,494
I won't let anything get
in the way of a performance.

The girl with the mohawk
had a really nice voice.

231
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,718
Funny. Yeah, man. That's good.

232
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,021
Hey!

233
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:56,656
Hey, get back.

234
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,276
Great first day, right?

235
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:01,428
Awesome.

236
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:02,395
Let me at that guy!

237
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,874
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,960
We used to be best friends...

239
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:13,694
before I got your girlfriend pregnant,

240
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:15,997
and then made out with
your other girlfriend and...

241
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:17,532
Yeah.

242
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,168
Anyways... I gotta be honest.

243
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,387
I really want to win this game,
and I figure it's the only way

244
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:25,223
us Glee studs are ever gonna
get any respect around here.

245
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:26,558
What's your point?

246
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,943
My point is that none
of that's gonna happen

247
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:31,396
unless you and I become
allies again, like

248
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,314
<i>Maverick and Iceman
at the end of Top Gun.</i>

249
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:36,551
So why'd youing that duet with Rachel?

250
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:40,655
I need you to do this number
with me to make Finn jealous.

251
00:12:40,723 --> 00:12:43,024
Nothing like that
will ever happen again.

252
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,159
You lead, and I got your back.

253
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:47,245
We need to win this
championship and become legends.

254
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,236
Ladies, my "Sue-clear" Weapon.

255
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:56,671
Becky.

256
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,594
Brittany...

257
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:03,911
Climb on up.

258
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,346
Congratulations.

259
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:08,550
You're doing this stunt
for the big competition.

260
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:12,103
I don't want to die yet.

261
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:14,022
<i>At least not until One
Tree Hill gets cancelled.</i>

262
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:15,890
Fine.

263
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:19,527
To put your toddler, fist-sized
mind at ease, we'll do one

264
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:21,112
final test run.

265
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:37,945
Any of you take German?

266
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,780
I may have to read

267
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:42,133
the owner's manual.

268
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,788
Don't worry, I'll talk to Mr.
Shue and take care of this.

269
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:50,975
Sue, what the hell were you thinking?

270
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,962
You cannot perform a
stunt that dangerous!

271
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:56,431
Our insurance premium is
through the roof as it is!

272
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,016
Cheerleading is a sport.

273
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,734
There are dangers involved.

274
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,436
The same as when a quarterback

275
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,237
is sacked, or a hockey player is

276
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:04,572
slammed up against the boards.

277
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,107
Enough, Sue.

278
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:08,142
There is no excuse for putting
a student's life at risk.

279
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,295
I'm a tastemaker, Will.

280
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:11,913
I know what an audience wants.

281
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,931
You are not going to
take this away from me.

282
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,533
I need this.

283
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:19,087
This level of risk and danger
makes me feel alive again.

284
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:20,922
But the risk and danger isn't to you!

285
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:22,323
That's the best part.

286
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:24,425
Enough! It's decided.

287
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:26,344
You are not allowed to fire yone

288
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,162
out of that cannon
without their consent!

289
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:36,504
Huh.

290
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:47,732
It's coming out of

291
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:49,567
your paycheck-
every penny of it!

292
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,043
Oh, God! It's a lawsuit.

293
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:01,028
I'm telling you, I wish
you could have seen it.

294
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:10,705
Sort of like that.

295
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,553
What the hell are you doing?

296
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:28,055
I'm seing a message.

297
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,907
Sue Sylvester's done playing nice.

298
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:34,278
I just got off the phone with
the Ohio Cheerleading Board,

299
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:37,615
and they accepted my
request to move my regional

300
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,067
to the same night as
your championship game.

301
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,753
Congratulations.

302
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,289
You just lost your halftime
show and the cheerleaders.

303
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,544
Sue!

304
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:55,916
What the crap are we gonna do now?

305
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:02,923
I got it.

306
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,392
No frickin' way! WILL:
We don't have a choice.

307
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,527
Sue pulled the Cheerios! from the game,

308
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:08,696
so if we don't do it,
there's no halftime show.

309
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:10,114
And this is a problem because?

310
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,266
It's not a problem. It's an opportunity.

311
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:14,268
Opportunity to humiliate
ourselves. BEISTE: Hey!

312
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,288
the whole point of this week
was to bring you guys together;

313
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:18,939
to bring the school together.
Wait- so you want us

314
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:21,826
to play the first half,
change into some "sequeen"

315
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,661
ball gowns, and then

316
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:26,748
go out and do the halftime show
at our own championship game?

317
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,168
Yes. It's the championship game!

318
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:31,753
This is a crazy town. Crazy.

319
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,454
This is crazy! What about
the Cheerios! in Glee Club?

320
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,889
They have a choice.

321
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:36,758
Us, or the Cheerios! competition.

322
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,977
Well, obviously, Quinn is gonna
choose the Cheerios! I mean...

323
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:42,180
Well, that's not fair. You
don't know what she's goa.

324
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:43,464
I think the
cheerleading competition

325
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:45,149
is gonna be a lot of fun, but if you go,

326
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,601
you're gonna miss out

327
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:49,303
on us doing the most
iconic song of all time.

328
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:52,306
The Super Bowl
of pop anthems-

329
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:54,141
"Thriller. "

330
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,077
Yeah!

331
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:58,112
Yeah, remember a few years ago.

332
00:16:58,163 --> 00:16:59,797
when that Philippine prison did that

333
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,799
mega performance of "Thriller"
and put it on YouTube?

334
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,252
In the four months it took
to rehearse that number,

335
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,337
prisoner-on-prisoner
crime dropped

336
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:07,839
80%.

337
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:10,708
Doing that, together, as a team,

338
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,211
created a unity within that prison.

339
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:15,346
And that's what I'm looking to do here.

340
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,681
I mean, don't get
me wrong, you know-

341
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:18,182
I'm big on Michael
and everything-

342
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,501
but isn't that kind of what
they're expecting us to do

343
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,220
Which is why we're
gonna mash it together

344
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,171
with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs'
equally spooky single

345
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,190
"Heads Will Roll. "

346
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:29,610
Who's Yeah Yeah Yeah?

347
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:30,945
All right, New Directions!, Titans,

348
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,681
we're going to Zombie Camp.

349
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,804
Uh, five, six, seven, eight.

350
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:48,363
Time out.

351
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,065
Time out. Time out.
Hey. Hey.

352
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,149
Knock it off!

353
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Okay, guys.

354
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:53,368
It's good, but let's...

355
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:54,569
put a little life into it.

356
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:55,954
But we're dead.

357
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:58,040
Then put some afterlife into it.

358
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:00,792
t out of your heads and get
into your aracters, all right?

359
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,194
Very creative. I like that.

360
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,034
Five, six, seven, eight.

361
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:17,759
All right! Nice progress, guys.

362
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,261
Now let's take a
breather, and I'll see you

363
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:20,479
in the choir room in five minutes,

364
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:21,763
for a lesson in zombie makeup.

365
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:23,482
Makeup?!? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

366
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:24,816
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

367
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:26,234
Yes, yes, yes. Hey, Dave.

368
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,270
Talk to you for a second?

369
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:29,771
Look, I know I'm bad.

370
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,657
Can you just spare me, so
can we get through this?

371
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:35,027
That's not what I was
going to say at all.

372
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:36,227
You're actually really good.

373
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,829
If you took that energy

374
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:40,231
you used bullying people
and put it into this,

375
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:42,501
you'd be one of most
talented guys in the school.

376
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:45,570
Just think about it.

377
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,378
...makeup artist.

378
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,847
I am brilliant.

379
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:57,248
It's actually decent.

380
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,267
It's all right.

381
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:05,440
I took a makeup class.

382
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,359
Hey, I need to talk to you.

383
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:08,660
Can we not fight for just one day?

384
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:10,095
Man, it's already hard enough

385
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:12,064
not to kick you in the
nuts every time I see you.

386
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:14,483
You think maybe we should do
a warm-up number or something

387
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,903
before we do that big
"Thriller" thing at halftime?

388
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:20,539
You know, I figure the only way
I'm gonna keep any street cred

389
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,157
around here after dancing
around like an idiot

390
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:24,709
in front of the whole school
is if we kick ass at it.

391
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,711
Uh...

392
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:28,713
yeah... couldn't agree more.

393
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:35,303
Zombie camp was funner than I expected.

394
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:37,389
And the glee club together
with the football team-

395
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:39,391
it's like a double rainbow.

396
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,892
A zombie double rainbow.

397
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,177
What the hell are we gonna do?

398
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:43,145
If we go to our
cheerleading competition,

399
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:45,013
then we miss the halftime show,

400
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:46,515
and we're out of Glee Club.

401
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,066
I'm torn.

402
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:50,235
Oh, I'm not. I'm
Brittany.

403
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:53,138
Couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

404
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:54,573
What were you doing in there?

405
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,458
Enjoying the eavesdropping afforded me

406
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,443
by the Swiss-timepiece regularity

407
00:19:58,494 --> 00:19:59,644
and utter silence

408
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:03,248
of my 2:00 p. m. ninja poops.

409
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:06,651
Well, I typed these up for you ladies,

410
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,703
requiring your signature,

411
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:11,506
tendering your resignation
from the Glee Club.

412
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:14,759
Oh, and Brittany, here's a note for you,

413
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:17,462
handwritten and in crayon
from the Human Cannon,

414
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:19,664
saying how much it misses you.

415
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:21,183
Coach, that cannon is going
to get Brittany killed.

416
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,434
Is that really worth it

417
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,803
just to win a stupid
national champiohip?

418
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:28,173
Seventh consecutive stupid
national championship.

419
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:30,659
This is ridiculous. You had
quite a year last year, Q.

420
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:32,861
And as I recall, you
didn't have such a good time

421
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:35,346
out of that Cheerios! uniform.

422
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:37,399
Ladies, I am giving you
the chance, right now,

423
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:41,236
to choose once and for all
where your true loyalties lie.

424
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,821
Choose the Cheerios!,

425
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:46,391
or choose the Glee Club.

426
00:20:57,203 --> 00:20:58,887
How the hell could you do this?

427
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,256
Oh, don't get all up in my face, Finn.

428
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,924
What were we supposed to do?

429
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:04,476
Uh, quit Cheerios!

430
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,311
Coach Sylvester is awful to you guys.

431
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:08,396
And don't forget who was there for you

432
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:11,933
the last time she dumped you
on your ass- us, Glee Club.

433
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:14,853
And you don't think that
I feel awful about that?

434
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:16,554
You don't need to be
a Cheerio! to be cool.

435
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:18,106
Oh, you are so naive.

436
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:19,557
This whole school is about labels.

437
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,194
Wow. I never realized
you were sfreakin' weak.

438
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:24,446
Oh. I... What did you say?

439
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,914
All the Cheerios! quit Glee
Club. So why are you yelling

440
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:27,115
at my girlfriend about it?

441
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,116
I'm yelling at her because

442
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:29,367
I'm the leader of this team.

443
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:30,902
Well, maybe it's time
for a chge at the top.

444
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:33,088
What's that supposed to mean?
This is kind of hot, actually.

445
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:34,673
It means that maybe the reason

446
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,209
everyone hates us is because
we need some new leadership.

447
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,544
Face it, you've had your feet
in both worlds for a year,

448
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,263
and never been able
to bring them together.

449
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:42,547
Maybe someone else could.

450
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:44,516
What, as in maybe you? As in yes.

451
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,884
Well, maybe we should
settle this right now.

452
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:48,220
Bring it. Brung.

453
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,556
Want some more of that? Huh? Yeah.

454
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,058
You like that? Huh?
Really, guys? Really.

455
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:55,644
Hey, hey! How many fights do
I have to break up this week?

456
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,779
Now calm down...

457
00:21:57,863 --> 00:21:59,231
and get back to Glee Club.

458
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:01,032
Come on.

459
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:04,703

All you football players
nailing that Zombies classic

on the first time out.

I am impressed.

494

Appropriate outfits.

495
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:11,996
They represent the death

496

of your guyses' reign at this school.

497

put you puckheads in your place

football rules this school?

Maybe, but not after you
make dancing fools of yourself

500
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:22,707
at that halftime show.

501
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:24,092
You know it,

502
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,127
we know it, the whole school knows it.

503
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:27,578
They'll think different
after they see it.

504
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,963
It's going to be awesome.

505
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:30,682

508
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:36,971
It's Independence Day.

509
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:39,557
Oh, my eyes!

510
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:40,925
It's burning!

511
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:43,111
Just relax; it stops
after a couple hours

512
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,596
No frickin' way I'm
letting that happen again.

513
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:48,066
He's in the first stage
of loserdom: denial.

514
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:50,235
No! I am not a loser.

515
00:24:50,286 --> 00:24:52,036
And I don't sing and dance.

516
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:55,290
I walk tall d carra big stick.

517

Dude, relax... this is gonna be fine.

518
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,445
Yeah, of course it is.

519
00:25:00,496 --> 00:25:01,746
'Cause I'm quitting Glee Club.

520
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:03,748
No, you're not. Fact is,

521
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,750
covered in ice and red dye number seven,

522
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:07,385
you guys look more like a team

523
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:08,720
than you ever have out on the field.

524
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:09,921
I don't care. I'm out.

525
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:11,256
Then you're off the team.

526
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:13,391
No way. Yeah.

527
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:16,311
If we all quit, you barely have
enough guys to play next week.

528
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:18,012
It's the championship game.

529
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:19,130
You're not going to throw it away.

530
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:21,683
Try me. FINN: Don't do this.

531
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,318
If we stand together,

532
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:25,186
and we do the halftime
show, we can win this game

533
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:26,271
and be kings in this place.

534
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:32,160
Good luck with that.

00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:20,860
Medium drip. BLAINE:
Me. Thank you very much.

607
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:24,196
Now, I don't want to
sound cocky or anything,

608
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:26,699
but you guys better be pulling
out all the stops for Regionals,

609
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,219
because the number we just
rehearsed is so off-the-hook,

610
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:30,386
it's dangerous.

611

when they're watching it.

613

Guys, we're kidding.

614
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:37,260
Yeah, well, it's just
hard to laugh right now

615
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:38,428

616
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:39,746

the stars of two rival show choirs

618
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:43,433
sitting down to coffee-
our school is so messed up,

619
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:45,068
we can't even keep our
own football team together.

620
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:46,436
It's so sad, you guys.

621
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,820
Coach Beiste and Mr. Shue were so close

622
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:49,388
to getting everyone
at the school together.

623
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,057

me anything about this?

624
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:52,408
I mean, we live together.

625
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,444
mean, I bring him a glass
of warm milk every night,

626
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:55,828
just in the hopes that we'll
have a little lady-chat.

627
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:57,080
Warm milk? Really?

628
00:28:57,164 --> 00:28:58,164
It's delicious.

629
00:28:58,231 --> 00:28:59,899
Finn's too proud to complain.

630
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,734
He feels like he has to
be strong for everyone,

631
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,336
but I know it's just killing him inside.

632
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:04,587
I hope he realizes

633
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:06,339
that, you know, if he
and I were still together,

634
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:07,840
I could make him feel
a lot better, you know.

635
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:09,208
Let it go, Rachel.

636
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,094
I...

637
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:13,930
I just wish thathere was
a way that we could help.

638
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:15,298
That's all. Yeah.

639
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:16,349
And the worst part is
how bummed the guys are.

640
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,467
I mean, they already suffer

641
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,469
enough abuse just being in Glee.

642
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:21,087
I really think winning
the game could have eased

643
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:22,639
some of the pressure, at
least for a little while.

644
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,274
Wait, so the whole team quit?

645
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:25,758
Everybody not in Glee.

646
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:27,259
I mean, you can't play
football with five guys.

647
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:29,028
And one of them is in a wheelchair.

648
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:30,262
Yeah, Coach Beiste
put up a sign-up sheet

649
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:31,197
for people to join. I think they'll take

650
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,231
anyone at this point.

651
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:33,533
Well, the good news is,

652
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,784
you actually only need four more guys.

653
00:29:34,868 --> 00:29:37,020
High school regulations actually let you

654
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:39,405
play a couple guys
short, if you want to.

655
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,108
But if they figure out
a way to make it work,

656
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,409
you can bet that we'll
definitely be there

657
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,961
to cheer them on. Totally.

658
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:47,130
Blaine and I love football.

659
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:48,798
Well, Blaine loves
football. I love scarves.

660
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,454
I cut 30 guys when we had tryouts

661
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:57,173
at the beginning of the season.

662
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:59,892
You're telling me not one
of those guys wants to play?

663
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,728
It's like crossing a picket line.

664
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:03,563
Nobody wants to be a scab.

665
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,765
I guess we should go break it to them.

666
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:07,633
Why can't we just let them

667
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:08,935
back on the team, just for this game?

668
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:10,970
No. We carry this thing through,

669
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:13,239
even if it means having
to forfeit the game.

670
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:14,357
I can't believe this is it.

671
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,164
Maybe it isn't.

672
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:27,420
We want to join the team.

673
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:29,622
"We," who?

674
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:31,007
All us Glee girls.

675
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,843
We want to join the football team,

676
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:35,545
and we want to play in the championship.

677
00:30:35,612 --> 00:30:36,662
Come on, guys. Stop screwing around.

678
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:37,930
It's not cool.

679
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:39,465
What's not cool is you guys

680
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:40,833
not respecting women enough to realize

681
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,685
we're perfectly capable
of playing football.

682
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:43,970
And don't forget who the state champ

683
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:45,171
in Greco-Roman wrestling is.

684
00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:47,640
I've got offers from three different

685
00:30:47,691 --> 00:30:48,941
professional wrestling organizations

686
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:50,943
for after I graduate, so...

687
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:53,229
Rachel, have you actually
seen a tackle football game?

688
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:55,031
When they tackle you, it hurts.

689
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:56,649
Yeah. And not in the
good, Mellencamp way.

690
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,867
We thought about that. But the truth is,

691
00:30:57,951 --> 00:30:59,769
is that you guys don't
really need us to play.

692
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:00,853
You just need enough players

693
00:31:00,904 --> 00:31:02,321
out there to field a regulation team.

694
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:03,523
So when they snap the ball,

695
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,657
we're just going to
lie down on the ground.

696
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,691
We're just going to lie there.

697
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,210
Well, I'm not.

698
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:08,461
I'm going to bring the pain.

699
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:11,831
I guess they won't get
hurt if you stay down.

700
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:14,217
Okay, what do your
parents have to say about this?

701
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,135
We all have signed
permission slips from them.

702
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,421
It took some convincing,
but they understood

703
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:19,806
what it means to all of us.

704
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:22,341
What do you think, Coach?

705
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:23,543
I think...

706
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,880
Welcome to the football team.

707
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:29,015
Yes!

708
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:32,602
Football team, football team.

709
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:33,853
High five, teammate.

710
00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:35,888
I just don't want to die.

711
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:37,389
You don't climb in that cannon,

712
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:40,276
and that routine will be all
"boom boom," and no "pow. "

713
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,747
And that, Brittany, is so 2000 and late.

714
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:47,166
Here's your consent form.

715
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:49,252
And as you ponder your decision,

716
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:51,788
I ask that you remember that that cannon

717
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:54,073
has two little baby
twin cannons at home,

718
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:56,092
and one more on the way.

719
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:58,911
And if you refuse to sign this,

720
00:31:58,962 --> 00:32:02,799
well, those little baby
cannons might just go hungry.

721
00:32:02,883 --> 00:32:05,551
Baby cannons?

722
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,837
And the mama cannon has fibromyalgia,

723
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:08,855
so she can't work.

724
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:13,526
Do you want us to win, or don't you?

725
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:22,685
How many M's are there
in the letter "R"?

726
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:23,903
Make an "X."

727
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:38,445
It's not too late.

728
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,698
To commit social suicide?

729
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:42,783
How the hell you going to
play with five guys, huh?

730
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:51,792
You have got to be kidding me.

731
00:32:51,877 --> 00:32:53,511
What the hell are they doing?

732
00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:58,549
What you don't have the balls to do.

733
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,886
Stupid.

734
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,430
Are you ready for this?

735
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:14,615
Let's kick some ass!

736
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:22,406
Punch and Judy on one. Ready? Break!

737
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:23,958
Break. MERCEDES: Who's Judy?

738
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:24,875
Let's go!

739
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,378
Where do I go?

740
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:28,579
Stand right there.

741
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,580
What do I do?

742
00:33:36,588 --> 00:33:37,838
You're gonna die.

743
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:40,224
Blue 42!

744
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,476
Blue 42! Down!

745
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:43,677
Set! Hike!

746
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:56,273
Damn it.

747
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,231
What happened? What
happened? Is it over?

748
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:12,423
All right. How's everyone doing?

749
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,658
Kill me now, I'm gonna die.

750
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:16,827
Is anyone else tired of
lying down all the time?

751
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:18,161
I want to play.

752
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:19,930
Just don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

753
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:21,966
Ready? Break.

754
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:23,384
All right, guys. Let's go!

755
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:26,937
Down!

756
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,005
Blitz. Blitz. Watch.

757
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:29,056
Set!

758
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,190
Hike!

759
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:35,813
Get the ball!

760
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:40,183
Get the ball! Get the ball!

761
00:34:40,235 --> 00:34:41,285
Come on! Get it! Get it!

762
00:34:43,354 --> 00:34:45,372
Go, go, go, go!

763
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,127
Go, go! Go! Go, go, go!

764
00:34:58,753 --> 00:34:59,720
Go!

765
00:34:59,804 --> 00:35:02,089
Tina?

766
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:04,475
Oh, no.

767
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:09,763
Is she breathing?

768
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:17,621
Did we win?

769
00:35:31,402 --> 00:35:32,870
We're still in this.

770
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:35,005
Give it up, Finn. Our
only shot at redemption

771
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:36,757
right now is to kick
butt at the halftime show.

772
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:38,876
Sam!

773
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:41,912
Come here.

774
00:35:41,963 --> 00:35:43,931
I need you to play quarterback
for the rest of the half.

775
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:45,132
Okay.

776
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:46,684
Puck, when the half ends,

777
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:48,085
you gotta go convince Karofsky
and the rest of the guys

778
00:35:48,153 --> 00:35:49,303
to do the halftime show with us.

779
00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:51,605
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

780
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,856
Figure it out.

781
00:35:52,924 --> 00:35:54,725
You're my wingman, right?

782
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:56,694
I got tone, Mav.

783
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,962
Where are you going?

784
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,564
Can't have a halftime
show without cheerleaders.

785
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,109
I'm gonna die.

786
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,211
It'll be worth it.

787
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:15,996
Hey!

788
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:18,882
What are you doing here?

789
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,367
Stopping you from going to
Sue's Regionals competition.

790
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:22,169
You guys got to come
to the game with me.

791
00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:24,254
Haven't you been payingttention?

792
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:26,123
If we're not Cheerios!, we're nothing.

793
00:36:26,174 --> 00:36:27,341
You think that, but it's not true.

794
00:36:27,425 --> 00:36:30,227
You joined Cheerios! to be popular,

795
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:32,479
but you joined Glee Club
because you loved it.

796
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:34,832
Sue doesn't care about you guys.

797
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:36,400
She's fine killing Brittany.

798
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:37,851
Tell me honestly.

799
00:36:37,936 --> 00:36:39,970
If you didn't think it
would hurt your reputation,

800
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:41,138
which would you choose?

801
00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:42,523
Glee Club.

802
00:36:44,692 --> 00:36:46,744
I know you,

803
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:48,695
and you don't think you are,

804
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,198
but you're strong enough to do this.

805
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:55,318
Okay.

806
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,921
Okay?

807
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,173
Okay.

808
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:01,125
What about you, Santana?

809
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:04,261
Screw her- she put me on
the bottom of the pyramid.

810
00:37:04,328 --> 00:37:05,462
Come on, we've oy got a few minutes.

811
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:07,347
No time for a foursome, ladies.

812
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:09,349
Bus leaves in five.

813
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,718
We quit Cheerios!

814
00:37:11,803 --> 00:37:13,020
You can't quit Cheerios!

815
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:14,721
It's blood in, blood out.

816
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:17,024
Now get your sweet
little cans on that bus.

817
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:18,859
We still quit.

818
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:21,278
You're my stars.

819
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:24,031
If you leave, I have no performance!

820
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:25,983
Sucks for you.

821
00:37:35,326 --> 00:37:37,244
Looking good out there, Puck.

822
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:39,163
You know what? I don't
want to hear it, Karofsky.

823
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:40,964
I don't want to hear it from any of you.

824
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:42,332
You're all a bunch of cowards.

825
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:43,750
Coward losers.

826
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:45,869
Yeah, you're the only
loser losing this game.

827
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,921
You know, this is it.

828
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:50,057
This is the moment of our lives.

829
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:52,375
This is the one we
can actually look back

830
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:53,710
and tell our children about.

831
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:56,546
This is our moment to
actually win something,

832
00:37:56,598 --> 00:37:58,899
and you guys are sitting
in the damn stands!

833
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:01,768
I mean, you're so afraid

834
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:03,520
of being called geeks or losers or gay,

835
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:06,556
that you settle for being nothing.

836
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:09,576
Well, we still have
a whole half to play.

837
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,394
And wean win this, guys, I know it.

838
00:38:11,446 --> 00:38:12,646
What's the point, man?

839
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:14,364
Beiste isn't going to let us play.

840
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:19,569
She will if you come out and
perform at the halftime show.

841
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:21,404
I'm in.

842
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:23,340
Me, too.

843
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:25,792
No way. Come on, man, I
really want to win this game.

844
00:38:25,877 --> 00:38:27,678
It would mean so much to my dad, man.

845
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:29,680
Forget it, okay? Glee Club sucks.

846
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,081
Fine, Karofsky's out. Whatever.

847
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:33,050
But the rest of you need
to get in your zombie makeup

848
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:34,935
and hit the field toot sweet.

849
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:36,637
Come on, let's go!

850
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:38,222
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on! Let's do this!

Thank you.

00:41:40,596 --> 00:41:43,497
Hey! What are
you guys doing in here?

900
00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:45,166
Oh, we were gonna take
our zombie makeup off

901
00:41:45,217 --> 00:41:46,935
for the second half-
it's kind of itchy.

902
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:48,553
No. Leave it on.

903
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,521
Maybe we'll freak out the
other guys a little bit,

904
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:53,024
and we need all the help
we can get right now.

905
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:54,642
Well, get out there. All of us?

906
00:41:57,846 --> 00:41:59,513
Yeah. All of us.

907
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:05,620
Yeah!

908
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:08,189
Welcome back, boy.

909
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,458
Get out there.

910
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:25,757
Yeah!

911
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:41,222
Set! Hut-hut!

912
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:55,119
Someone bit me!

913
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:56,955
One of those zombies bit me!

914
00:42:58,257 --> 00:43:00,625
Good boy!

915
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:05,964
Down! Set! One-one!

916
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,601
Block 59! Get on 59!

917
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,981
That was awesome. Nice block.

918
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:25,066
Nice throw. Bam!

919
00:43:27,602 --> 00:43:28,369
Time out!

920
00:43:33,826 --> 00:43:34,942
It was a good run.

921
00:43:34,994 --> 00:43:36,160
We almost had it.

922
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:37,962
Hey, this game isn't over.

923
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:39,780
There's, like, ten
seconds left- it's over.

924
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:45,169
Not if the quarterback fumbs the snap.

925
00:43:47,973 --> 00:43:50,124
Here's what we're gonna do.

926
00:43:50,175 --> 00:43:51,459
Ready? Break! TEAM: Break!

927

brains... brains... brains...

940
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:03,131
So, tell me, Sue, how
are you holding up?

941
00:45:03,198 --> 00:45:05,133
I'm hanging in there, thank you.

942
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,835
I know it's painful, but...

943
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:11,756
can you take me back to
the moment when you knew

944
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,707
you had lost what would have been

945
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:16,978
a record seventh consecutive
national championship,

946
00:45:17,045 --> 00:45:20,714
landing you this interview
as "Loser of the Year"?

947
00:45:20,766 --> 00:45:22,617
I thought this was the
"Ten Most Fascinating. "

948
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:24,018
That's Barbara Walters.

949
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:27,321
In the voting, you beat
out the following losers:

950
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:28,773
the economy,

951
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:30,024
Mel Gibson,

952
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:31,892
the housing market,

953
00:45:31,944 --> 00:45:33,945
Dina Lohan, Wall Street,

954
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:36,998
Tiger Woods, the Dallas Cowboys,

955
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:39,233
Brett Favre's cell phone,

956
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:41,235
nine percent unemployment,

957
00:45:41,286 --> 00:45:42,870
and Sparky Lohan,

958
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:47,175
who is Dina Lohan's dog and
apparently, also a loser.

959
00:45:47,242 --> 00:45:48,793
How do you cope with that?

960
00:45:48,877 --> 00:45:50,578
I've been drinking a lot of bleach.

961
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:52,130
Do you regret the choice

962
00:45:52,214 --> 00:45:55,349
of attempting to fire a
student out of a cannon?

963
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:58,453
Other than attracting headlines

964
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,939
and launching a national debate
on the safety of athletes,

965
00:46:02,024 --> 00:46:03,741
was it really worth it?

966
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:07,261
Honestly, I was just
trying to feel something.

967
00:46:07,312 --> 00:46:09,697
And how do you feel
now that the remainder

968
00:46:09,764 --> 00:46:11,516
of the annual Cheerios! budget

969
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,985
is going to the Glee Club?

970
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:15,903
I'm sorry? Let's take a look.

971
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,342
Whoops, sorry.

972
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,027
COURIC After
a little song and dance

973
00:46:23,095 --> 00:46:24,629
toupport the arts,

974
00:46:24,713 --> 00:46:26,780
I sat down with McKinley
Glee Club director

975
00:46:26,832 --> 00:46:27,965
Will Schuester.

976
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,467
I have to say, I'm thrilled.

977
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:31,302
Sue got what was coming to her,

978
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:35,556
and now we don't have to hold a bake
sale to pay for the bus to Regionals.

979
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:39,293
Thoughts?

980
00:46:41,613 --> 00:46:44,182
I hate you, Diane Sawyer.

981
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:48,069
Hey. Hey.

982
00:46:48,136 --> 00:46:49,303
Congrats on the MVP.

983
00:46:49,354 --> 00:46:50,404
Oh, thanks.

984
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:52,139
It was a team effort.

985
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:54,158
So, listen, uh,

986
00:46:54,243 --> 00:46:56,777
there's no way the Glee Club's
gonna let you join permanently,

987
00:46:56,828 --> 00:46:58,613
until you clean things up with Kurt.

988
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:02,983
So I was thinking maybe we cou go
together to Dalton and apologize...

989
00:47:03,035 --> 00:47:05,503
Who said I want to join
the Glee Club permanently?

990
00:47:05,587 --> 00:47:07,488
I just thought after
this week and-and...

991
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:10,258
the way we won the game and the way you
came out to dance... What do you think?

992
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:12,476
We all dance around together
and win a football game

993
00:47:12,544 --> 00:47:13,844
and everything's gonna change?

994
00:47:13,912 --> 00:47:17,215
Glee Club's gonna be cool
and we're all gonna sing

995
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:18,716
hippie peace songs every morning?

996
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,635
Maybe. I-I don't know. It's a start.

997
00:47:20,686 --> 00:47:22,303
No, dude, it's a finish.

998
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:24,071
Okay? This is high school.

999
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:26,307
People's memories for good
stuff lasts about as long

1000
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:29,443
as their Facebook status. But we've got
a chance to really change things here.

1001
00:47:29,511 --> 00:47:31,896
I just won the conference championship.

1002
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,731
I'm on top.

1003
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:37,451
Why would I want to change things?

1004
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:43,491
Hey.

1005
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:44,909
Hi.

1006
00:47:44,993 --> 00:47:47,128
I never got a chance to thank you.

1007
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,864
For helping me do the right thing.

1008
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,834
Aw, you would've come to
it on your own soon enough.

1009
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:56,036
So, how does it feel being
out of the uniform? Weird.

1010
00:47:56,088 --> 00:47:58,806
Did turn a couple of heads.

1011
00:47:58,874 --> 00:48:00,874
You were amazing this week.

1012
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:04,645
<i>On the field and off.</i>

1013
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:07,148
Reminded me of why I loved you.

1014
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,300
