They'll stick their noses in here, get
one little sniff of the music and go home.

Maybe that's the wages of sin.

If she'd found Him last,
she wouldn't have come through.

97
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:00,905
She must have lost Him
again between then and now

00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:04,005
cos she come down that aisle
tonight hollering in tongues.

Wash up the dishes before you go.

00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:05,895
- What I need is for you
to go get friendly with Luther,

476
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,089
then I just happen in.

477
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,419
We can't just ask Mr Skinner?

478
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,632
Mr Skinner don't want nothing
from coloured folk,

479
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,911
but they buy his goods and shine his shoes.

480
00:38:13,946 --> 00:38:15,470
You go on ahead now.

How you been keeping, Tyrone?

493
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,875
Well, just...

00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,173
trying to hold it together.

495
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:32,747
- You've got your beautiful young
daughter with you this morning.

496
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:34,186
Don't you be studying her.

497
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:40,394
I heard tell you gonna put
on a guitar man out at your place.

498
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:41,890
Where you hear that?

499
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:44,452
Oh... The breeze.

500
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:49,850
Well, this time the breeze know
what it's blowing about.

501
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:53,633
You'd better be careful, Tyrone.

502
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:56,827
Cos you know what them
guitar players are like.

503
00:39:58,346 --> 00:39:59,996

and the bill is passed due.

You know Mr Roosevelt would've
done it already, only he died.

512

They don't listen to Miss Eleanor
no more but Mr Truman,

513
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:41,027
he's starting a band, especially now
that we got this war heated up.

514
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:42,871
Brother Randolph says...

515
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:47,469
- Here it comes! The gospel
according to Randolph

516
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:53,022
Tyrone! How you doing, man?
- Oh, got my nose above the waterline.

517
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:57,341
Here's my baby. What's up, Ty?
How your mama doing, China Doll?

518
00:40:57,376 --> 00:40:59,305
She doing fine, Uncle Shack.

519
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,303
I'm just telling the boys here
about how Brother Randolph

520
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:05,697
pushing this deal how boys are gonna
be a full part of the service.

00:41:05,732 --> 00:41:07,401
I carried a rifle in the Great War.

Boys get in the middle of this Korea mess,

00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,740
they ain't gonna thank you
for your efforts.

524

If we want our full due in this
country, we've got to go whole hog!

00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:19,401
Black folk shooting yellow folk
to keep white folks happy?

526
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,005
We need to move on
from that kind of thinking.

527
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,318
Move right on, Shack. Then come back
and tell the rest of us how it is.

That's a hard headed man.

530
00:41:34,255 --> 00:41:36,998
I'd have to ask Mr Skinner.
- Of course you would.

531
00:41:37,983 --> 00:41:41,382
While you're at it, remind him how one
of the reasons coloured folks come here

532
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,521
is to get the low-down
on what's happening.

533
00:41:43,856 --> 00:41:45,104
China doll!

534
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:47,504
You gonna let us put up these posters,
ain't ya, Luther?

535
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,343
Oh, I don't think there'll be
any problem at all.

536
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:54,336
That's awful nice of you, Luther.
- You're looking special today.

537
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,020
That's sweet of you to say.

538
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,179
Maceo, you go with the man here,

539
00:41:58,214 --> 00:42:00,358
he'll show you where to put these up.

Darling, we've got a lot
of more places to go.

541
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:05,951
Nice to see you, Luther!

00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:17,806
You've got that boy
eating out of your hand!

Luther is the only one didn't pull my hair,

544
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,609
he sat behind me in Sunday school.

545
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:24,593
I hope you got a little
of that sugar left, cos

00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:26,542
we got to spare some on
Miss Bertha Mae Spivey.

547
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,898
You gonna ask her to come sing again?
- No. I'm gonna ask her for money.

548
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:32,919
Word is, she got a whole pile
of it squirrelled away.

549

Hey, come on, girl.

Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:47,693
Yeah.

555
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:53,256
So why Miss Spivey gonna give you money,

556
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:55,350
you don't let her sing at the club no more?

557
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:58,409
I'm gonna make her partner.
- Partner in what?

558
00:42:58,444 --> 00:42:59,893
The Honeydripper.

559
00:43:00,428 --> 00:43:04,246
But all you ever say, it's just
a hole you pour good money into.

560
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,885
It don't matter.
I'm gonna make her proprietor.

561
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,163
'Tress'. Like waiter and waitress.

562
00:43:11,682 --> 00:43:13,527
Proprietress.

563
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:15,961
She got to like the sound of that.

564
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,763
Lovely ladies out to make a purchase.

565
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:25,157
Is that the same Guitar Sam
that's on the radio?

566
00:43:25,198 --> 00:43:26,157
The very one.

567
00:43:26,392 --> 00:43:27,501
What's he look like?

568
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:32,614
Fine looking man,
a real lady killer from what I hear.

569
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:35,138
Got that New Orleans style to him.

570
00:43:35,473 --> 00:43:36,947
Well, you ought to have a picture up there.

571
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:39,671
We'll be getting some of those
when he come in on the train.

572
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:43,548
Main thing is, the man is electrifying

573
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:46,027
and you know what that means.

574
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:47,997
OK.

575
00:43:50,946 --> 00:43:55,109
Make like we just come by
to see how how she keeping.

576
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:59,502
Then I'll kind of mention I'd been
thinking of bringing her on as a partner.

577
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:03,061
Left the door open.

578
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,695
She gone.

579
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:23,871
Oh. When she going to be back?

580
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:27,370
She's gone.

581
00:44:32,528 --> 00:44:34,047
Woke up beside her.

582
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,919
Oh, damn.

584
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:59,441
China doll, go find your mama.

585
00:44:59,876 --> 00:45:01,635
She'll know how to fix up the body.

586
00:45:07,113 --> 00:45:09,272
Laugh and all but...

587
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:13,510
.. I've been with that woman
24 years.

588
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,628
She gave me the only home I ever had.

589
00:45:22,627 --> 00:45:24,066
What am I gonna do now?

590
00:45:50,555 --> 00:45:52,094
What's your hurry, boy?

591
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:55,213
No hurry.

592
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,091
Take your hat off.

593
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,549
Where you headed?

594
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:03,774
I'm looking for work.

595
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:05,728
You're not from around here?

596
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,612
No, sir.

597
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:11,785
Stranger wandering around, no job,

598
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,024
that would make you a vagrant.

599
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:16,363
But I'm looking.

600
00:46:18,602 --> 00:46:20,801
I got a job for you.
Get in the back.

601
00:46:44,032 --> 00:46:46,036
I can always use another hand.

602
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:51,328
Well, I caught this young fella in
flagrant violation of the statutes...

603
00:46:51,363 --> 00:46:53,487
gawkery, with intent to mope.

604
00:46:55,006 --> 00:46:56,571
What's he going to run me?

605
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,190
3 a day, plus you feed him lunch.

606
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:03,623
The sentence, that all depends on how
long you're gonna need the help?

607
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:05,367
I don't get any trial?

608
00:47:05,802 --> 00:47:08,961
Sure you do, boy, and a speedy
one at that. Meet the judge.

609
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:10,897
Judge Gatlin.

610
00:47:10,932 --> 00:47:12,799
Grab a sack.

611
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:21,596
Oh dear, I believe it's about that time.

612
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:26,353
Would you care to join me?
- No, thank you.

613
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:31,991
Of course you won't join me,
you don't partake.

614
00:47:32,026 --> 00:47:34,439
That was thoughtless of me.

615
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:36,789
No, that's all right.

616
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:45,945
So, you don't take spirits
and what else in your church?

617
00:47:47,384 --> 00:47:51,667
I'm sort of between churches
- Oh.

618
00:47:53,702 --> 00:47:56,440
I've been thinking about
changing over to the Holiness,

619
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:59,859
but I haven't been sanctified yet.

620
00:47:59,994 --> 00:48:01,278
Oh.

621
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:09,254
There's been a minister in this week.

622
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,813
The tent over by the fairgrounds?

623
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:18,431
The church I was raised in,
we were Pentecostals.

624
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:26,588
They wouldn't have anything but
the human voice inside the church.

625
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:30,346
Dancing, any kind of dancing,

626
00:48:30,381 --> 00:48:32,203
music, card-playing.

627
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:34,025
It was very strict.

628
00:48:37,443 --> 00:48:39,001
They took up serpents.

629
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:40,706
I heard of that.

630
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:45,299
I tell Floyd these stories,
and he's... He's horrified.

631
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:49,542
They have always been Methodists,
Floyd's family.

632
00:48:49,577 --> 00:48:53,316
It can be a trial, married folks
differ in their religion.

633
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:55,795
And your husband is a...?

634
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:00,778
Unaffiliated.

635
00:49:01,113 --> 00:49:03,632
Unaffiliated, I see.

636
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:08,874
But he has his social club.

637
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:12,468
The Honeydripper?
- That is such a colourful name.

638
00:49:12,503 --> 00:49:13,986
Yes.

639
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:21,903
He must devote a great deal
of his energy to it.

640
00:49:21,938 --> 00:49:24,427
It's just him and Maceo Green runs it,

641
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:27,705
I go over and cook some
after I get off here.

642
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:34,198
Well, that's very supportive of you,
considering the sort of environment.

643
00:49:34,243 --> 00:49:37,177
I've been in those bar rooms
most of my life, Miss Amanda.

644
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:41,785
I see.

645
00:49:49,302 --> 00:49:50,840
I was a singer.

646
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,978
I met Tyrone in the Paradise,
down in Treefork.

647
00:49:56,313 --> 00:49:57,938
China doll was only two.

648
00:49:59,757 --> 00:50:02,001
And I was just...

649
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,394
living alone, you know,

650
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:07,973
drinking more than I ought,

651
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:10,393
and then Tyrone...

652
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:15,006
.. Like a light, come into my life.

653
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:18,809
People think things cos he owns the lounge,

654
00:50:19,214 --> 00:50:21,258
but they don't know him.

655
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:26,056
Small minds are never in short supply.

656
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:31,094
People in this town...

657
00:50:36,971 --> 00:50:42,429
I suppose they expected that Floyd,
being from a prominent family,

658
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:47,507
as prominent as is possible
here in Harmony,

659
00:50:47,642 --> 00:50:51,085
would have chosen somebody more...

660
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:59,282
In school, if you didn't have shoes...

661
00:51:05,818 --> 00:51:08,017
Oh, I forgot!

662
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:26,310
I was going through some of Emily's
old things the other day.

663
00:51:26,745 --> 00:51:29,709
I thought this would look
just darling on your China Doll.

664
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:34,687
Oh, I don't think that would
near fit her, Miss Amanda.

665
00:51:35,122 --> 00:51:37,485
Why, how old is she, now?

666
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,005
17...

667
00:51:41,363 --> 00:51:42,843
Oh, my...

668
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,520
I must have lost track
somewhere along the line.

669
00:51:48,555 --> 00:51:50,164
17?

670
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:52,878
It was a very nice thought.

671
00:51:54,938 --> 00:51:57,277
- Mama, mama, they need you at...

672
00:51:59,196 --> 00:52:00,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

673
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:04,998
Miss Amanda, I didn't know...
- China Doll!

674
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:09,612
We were just recalling
how you used to play right here,

675
00:52:09,947 --> 00:52:10,971
under this table.

676
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,488
There's not any cash money that I know of.

677
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:19,452
She sold a good deal of the furniture,

678
00:52:19,487 --> 00:52:23,165
but there's still a nice looking
couch in the parlour.

679
00:52:24,885 --> 00:52:28,328
Didn't care about too much,

680
00:52:28,363 --> 00:52:31,802
other than singing at the Pine Top's place.

681
00:52:32,437 --> 00:52:33,768
You're welcome to look around the house,

682
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:35,765
if there's anything your missus might like.

683
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,279
As long as it's not something
personal to me and Bertha Mae.

684
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:42,007
It's just...

685
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:45,066
She's got to go out in style.

686
00:53:32,535 --> 00:53:35,934
You ain't never done this job before?
- Can't say I have.

687
00:53:37,453 --> 00:53:43,001
You want to set your pins out wide,
bend over at the hip.

688
00:53:43,206 --> 00:53:46,469
Don't be bobbing up and down all the time.

689
00:53:46,704 --> 00:53:48,494
When you're up, be up.

690
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,728
When you're on the roll, stay down.

691
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:53,851
But most important,

692
00:53:55,286 --> 00:53:57,610
you got to get a rhythm.

693
00:53:57,645 --> 00:54:02,603
Everything in life got a rhythm,
even pulling cotton off the plant.

694
00:54:02,638 --> 00:54:06,566
Lay it out for me.
- Not my rhythm, your rhythm.

695
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:10,079
That's between you and the day
and the work you got before you.

696
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:14,157
Once you get it, don't let nothing
or nobody push you off it.

697
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:17,121
I'm going so slow.

698
00:54:18,056 --> 00:54:20,495
Are you getting paid
by the pound or by the hour?

699
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,031
I ain't getting paid at all,
none of us are.

700
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:26,098
I suggest you work that
into your rhythm too.

701
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:29,151
Let's see more picking and
less talking over there.

702
00:54:29,326 --> 00:54:30,951
Getting right to it, boss.

703
00:54:50,942 --> 00:54:52,621
Them boys frying over there.

704
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,465
That's Judge Gatlin's gang.

705
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,504
He works them people from can
until can't, every damn day.

706
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:01,117
When the fields get picked,
he bid 'em out to the neighbours.

707
00:55:01,252 --> 00:55:02,942
Harvest time come around here,

708
00:55:02,977 --> 00:55:05,335
you'd better sign with somebody
fast, or get out of sight.

709
00:55:08,494 --> 00:55:10,193
I ate a peck of dust today.

710
00:55:10,228 --> 00:55:11,858
Why don't you get some water?

711
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:14,537
The only thing that wash out
the dust is whisky.

712
00:55:14,572 --> 00:55:18,050
Ain't enough whisky in this world to
wash out what I swallowed in my life.

713
00:55:19,885 --> 00:55:22,048
What are we playing for?
- Two bits a hand.

714
00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:24,452
Woo! That's awful steep, ain't it?

715
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:27,971
Well... I remember playing
this game one night,

716
00:55:28,006 --> 00:55:31,284
Memphis's boss Crump's town, folks
is gambling before they can walk,

717
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:32,949
caught me a winning streak

718
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:36,142
that cleaned out half
the sportin' men on Beale Street.

719
00:55:36,577 --> 00:55:40,400
Got up from that table,
my money was long as train smoke.

720
00:55:41,435 --> 00:55:42,700
What happened to it?

721
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,028
Spent it all on fine-looking women.

722
00:55:53,505 --> 00:55:56,763
Yo, Mississippi!
- His name's Hamilton.

723
00:55:56,955 --> 00:55:58,063
Hambone!

724
00:56:00,462 --> 00:56:02,001
You want in on this?

725
00:56:02,336 --> 00:56:04,337
Settle up on pay day.

726
00:56:04,372 --> 00:56:06,339
That your deck of cards?

727
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:08,983
What if it is?

728
00:56:09,518 --> 00:56:12,121
I stay clear of it then.

729
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:17,195
Are you insinuating?
- I'm just saying I don't wanna play,

730
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:30,968
Looks like dinner.

731
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:34,032
A rabbit is a rodent.

732
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:36,586
A man eat a rabbit,
might as well eat a rat.

733
00:56:37,521 --> 00:56:38,830
Simple country nigger,

734
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:41,944
afraid to sit down and lose
a little handful of change.

735
00:56:41,979 --> 00:56:43,743
He awful big to mess with.

736
00:56:44,578 --> 00:56:46,307
Don't scare me none.

737
00:56:46,842 --> 00:56:50,800
I'm a stepping razor, man.
I'm trouble on two legs.

738
00:56:52,999 --> 00:56:56,198
Your draw, Junebug. Don't be
dripping no sweat on my cards.

739
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:58,802
[ CAR HONKING ]

740
00:56:58,837 --> 00:57:00,356
Excuse me folks!

741
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:05,239
Look here!

742
00:57:05,674 --> 00:57:10,591
Y'all heard about the show
we puttin' on at the Honeydripper.

743
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:11,987
Saturday night.

744
00:57:12,522 --> 00:57:14,649
We got Guitar Sam!

745
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:22,312
I expect there'll be a nice turnout
for Bertha Mae tomorrow.

746
00:57:22,547 --> 00:57:26,585
Yes, folks who wouldn't have nothin'
to do with her when she was alive.

747
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,389
Some of them, maybe.

748
00:57:28,724 --> 00:57:30,743
Still got to pay your respects.

749
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:35,661
That Slick is gonna have
to find him a new ride.

750
00:57:35,996 --> 00:57:37,925
That's a terrible thing to say.

751
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,884
That's how the man gets over, is all.

752
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:44,797
Always sugaring up to some woman
who's got a job or a bankroll.

753
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:46,737
That's no way to live.

754
00:57:48,455 --> 00:57:50,094
Society is in whirl, baby.

755
00:57:51,294 --> 00:57:54,812
A man's gotta walk through the gates
of hell to get a piece of cheese.

756
00:57:57,911 --> 00:57:59,711
Not so young any more...

757
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:03,334
.. Lose hold of what little he's got.

758
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:06,448
If you lose the club,
I'm sure you'll find something else.

759
00:58:07,393 --> 00:58:09,491
In this town? Like what?

760
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:14,664
You know, any time you want,
I could get Miss Amanda to ask...

761
00:58:14,899 --> 00:58:16,701
"Watch your feet, Mr Mayor!

762
00:58:16,736 --> 00:58:18,828
I just done mopped the flo!"

763
00:58:19,103 --> 00:58:22,560
Ty, you work so hard at the lodge,
but what you bring in is...

764
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:26,618
Not even as much as you make
polishing that white lady's silver.

765
00:58:36,835 --> 00:58:38,174
I didn't say that.

766
00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:40,013
You didn't have to.

767
00:58:42,472 --> 00:58:44,631
It'll just have to work out, then.

768
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,949
Meeting gonna start and I'm not there.

769
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:57,546
Your soul's not the one needs saving, baby.

770
00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:16,013
It's all gonna be fine, Daddy.

771
00:59:16,248 --> 00:59:19,606
Everybody in town talkin' about
Guitar Sam coming to Harmony.

772
00:59:21,885 --> 00:59:28,123
♫ As I walked all along this highway

773
00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:33,240
♫ I was seeking

774
00:59:33,275 --> 00:59:35,996
♫ My Lord each day

775
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:39,913
♫ She left me standing

776
00:59:39,948 --> 00:59:43,760
♫ Out on this highway

777
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:51,795
♫ Oh, just wondering which way I must go

778
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:55,708
♫ She left me standing

779
00:59:55,743 --> 00:59:58,914
♫ Out on this highway

780
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:06,949
♫ Oh, just wondering
which way I must go. ♫

781
01:00:13,124 --> 01:00:16,822
Amen! Amen! Sing on, choir!

782
01:00:18,057 --> 01:00:21,720
Amen! Let the church say Amen.

783
01:00:21,755 --> 01:00:23,764
Amen!

784
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:26,598
Let the church say Amen! Amen!

785
01:00:27,277 --> 01:00:28,397
Amen!

786
01:00:30,676 --> 01:00:31,955
Amen!

787
01:00:32,735 --> 01:00:37,003
She left him standing out on the highway,

788
01:00:37,188 --> 01:00:39,952
wondering which way to go.

789
01:00:39,987 --> 01:00:41,356
Yeah.

1103
01:25:28,956 --> 01:25:30,325
How come?

1104
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:32,799
You like dragging that cotton sack?

1105
01:25:33,434 --> 01:25:36,337
No.
- Then don't ask questions.

1106
01:25:55,789 --> 01:25:59,272
♫ Why don't you do right

1107
01:25:59,307 --> 01:26:02,706
♫ Like some other men do... ♫

1108
01:26:03,341 --> 01:26:04,630
This size, right...

1109
01:26:05,915 --> 01:26:07,919
but it's got to shine.

1110
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:10,398
And when you need this?
- Tonight.

1111
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:14,116
That's a tall order.
- It's got to happen.

1112
01:26:14,551 --> 01:26:20,868
You know, I do my best work,
my fastest work,

1113
01:26:21,503 --> 01:26:23,353
when I'm happy.

1114
01:26:25,238 --> 01:26:28,596
Yeah, I suppose you do.

1115
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:33,073
You gonna make me happy, baby?

1116
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:35,632
Uh...

1117
01:26:36,812 --> 01:26:39,775
You come down by the club tonight.

1118
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:44,088
We having a special show.
Tell 'em at the door, you my guest.

1119
01:26:44,323 --> 01:26:48,467
Food ain't the only thing a
woman needs three times a day.

1120
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:50,967
[ Mutters ] Wouldn't hurt
you to skip a few meals.

1121
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:53,110
What's that, baby?

1122
01:26:53,145 --> 01:26:58,442
Um, that boy gonna need time, try
this jacket on, see how he feels.

1123
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:00,702
Later, Nadine.

1124
01:27:19,593 --> 01:27:21,977
You got to do something
to this boy's hair, darling.

1125
01:27:22,912 --> 01:27:26,370
They may not know what the real Sam
looked like, but it ain't this.

1126
01:27:26,505 --> 01:27:28,014
I can try.

1127
01:27:28,749 --> 01:27:30,404
What exactly am I supposed to do?

1128
01:27:30,569 --> 01:27:33,227
You're gonna stand up there
with that contraption you got,

1129
01:27:33,262 --> 01:27:35,324
and play Guitar Sam's numbers.

1130
01:27:36,059 --> 01:27:37,651
I can do that with my eyes closed.

1131
01:27:37,706 --> 01:27:40,544
If we can get the audience to
close theirs, we'll be better off.

1132
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:43,302
- Ty! I tracked Mr Trenier down.

1133
01:27:45,022 --> 01:27:46,001
Let's hit it.

1134
01:27:48,236 --> 01:27:49,080
Bye, Daddy.

1135
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:07,512
You know what you're doing?

1136
01:28:08,947 --> 01:28:10,996
I fix Mama's hair all the time.

1137
01:28:12,531 --> 01:28:14,451
But you ain't been to that school yet.

1138
01:28:15,465 --> 01:28:17,829
You go to school to learn your guitar?

1139
01:28:19,948 --> 01:28:20,692
No.

1140
01:28:21,467 --> 01:28:23,505
I might pick up
some things at beauty school,

1141
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:25,381
but mostly it's for my certificate.

1142
01:28:25,616 --> 01:28:28,519
"And that is a ticket to adventure."

1143
01:28:28,654 --> 01:28:30,788
That's what it says in the brochure.

1144
01:28:30,823 --> 01:28:33,007
People looking for beauty
all over the world.

1145
01:28:34,482 --> 01:28:36,620
You ought to watch out for
them wires sticking down.

1146
01:28:36,655 --> 01:28:37,745
That don't look safe.

1147
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,939
Yeah, power's always going out.

1148
01:28:39,974 --> 01:28:42,098
People getting shocks and whatnot.

1149
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:44,182
Somebody ought to fix it.

1150
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:48,575
"Career and beauty
is like money in the bank."

1151
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:50,751
Says that in the brochure too.

1152
01:28:51,486 --> 01:28:53,558
Plus it isn't physically taxin'.

1153
01:28:53,893 --> 01:28:57,511
Yeah, can't see no pretty thing
like you behind a plough.

1154
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:04,358
I had the rheumatic fever
when I was little.

1155
01:29:04,663 --> 01:29:06,427
It left me with a weak heart.

1156
01:29:07,562 --> 01:29:08,451
Oh.

1157
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:11,685
Mine been acting kind of funny too.

1158
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,684
About since I laid eyes on you.

1159
01:29:20,202 --> 01:29:23,920
What's that?
- Just some old moonshine they keep around.

1160
01:29:25,615 --> 01:29:28,099
What are you gonna do with it?

1161
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:31,407
They joke about how this stuff
will straighten your hair right out.

1162
01:29:33,596 --> 01:29:35,834
I'll just make yours relax a little.

1163
01:29:51,348 --> 01:29:53,192
Mr Time Trenier.

1164
01:29:54,727 --> 01:29:56,591
Has a name to be reckoned with.

1165
01:29:57,526 --> 01:30:00,204
The story goes you used
to play with Buddy Bolan.

1166
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,209
- I played with them all down there.

1167
01:30:02,244 --> 01:30:03,432
And King Oliver.

1168
01:30:03,644 --> 01:30:06,802
One band falls apart,
you find yourself another.

1169
01:30:06,997 --> 01:30:10,279
There's never a shortage in bands
down in New Orleans.

1170
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,798
I didn't know you were giving lessons.

1171
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:14,997
It pays the rent, almost.

1172
01:30:16,197 --> 01:30:18,141
You interested in a playing job?

1173
01:30:18,676 --> 01:30:22,075
If you can pay, I can play.
- You got to dress sharp.

1174
01:30:24,114 --> 01:30:25,838
It ain't like an all-night thing.

1175
01:30:25,873 --> 01:30:30,831
You just got to start out, and
then there's gonna be an accident.

1176
01:30:30,866 --> 01:30:31,955
An accident?

1177
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:35,389
Yeah, a sudden loss of power.

1178
01:30:35,524 --> 01:30:36,749
Lights out.

1179
01:30:38,128 --> 01:30:39,728
It's your gig, man.

1180
01:30:40,163 --> 01:30:41,772
8 o'clock.

1181
01:30:41,807 --> 01:30:44,126
This ain't no coloured people's time.

1182
01:30:44,161 --> 01:30:45,722
And sure ain't New Orleans time.

1183
01:30:46,057 --> 01:30:48,148
I mean, 8 o'clock on the money.

1184
01:30:48,883 --> 01:30:51,242
If you got the green, I'm on the scene.

1185
01:30:51,277 --> 01:30:52,998
Then that's a deal.

1186
01:30:53,033 --> 01:30:54,685
You know any drummers?

1187
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,279
I bring you one.
- And nothing fancy.

1188
01:30:58,314 --> 01:31:00,358
Just as long as he keep time.

1189
01:31:01,203 --> 01:31:03,037
Time is my name.

1191
01:31:18,296 --> 01:31:20,160
Make your mark here, please.

1192
01:31:21,195 --> 01:31:22,359
You owe me 30.

1193
01:31:24,698 --> 01:31:26,082
The book says 28.

1194
01:31:26,997 --> 01:31:30,755
1.50 every 100lb, and I picked...

1195
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:33,009
2 deducted for stones.

1196
01:31:33,934 --> 01:31:36,258
But there was no stones in the sack.

1197
01:31:37,293 --> 01:31:40,011
We mill the cotton, son.
There's always stones.

1198
01:31:40,346 --> 01:31:42,850
But there weren't none in my sack.

1199
01:31:46,149 --> 01:31:50,227
We take off 2 a week for stones.
That's the way it's always been.

1200
01:31:52,686 --> 01:31:54,310
Ain't that right, Junebug?

1201
01:31:55,005 --> 01:31:57,944
Yes, sir.
Been that way my whole life.

1202
01:31:59,463 --> 01:32:02,921
You gonna take your pay, son,
or you gonna give it up to charity?

1203
01:32:20,624 --> 01:32:22,423
Wouldn't let nobody mess
with my money like that.

He took the same 2 off yours.

1205
01:32:24,342 --> 01:32:27,661
Yeah, but you could pave a highway
with the rocks I threw in that mess.

1206

You country nigros
let the crackers run you like dogs.

1207

If the sheriff wasn't here
I'd snap your neck, boy.

1208
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:35,861
Don't let me stop you.

1209

But first, you're gonna sign
that ledger like you're s'pose to.

How could you do that?
- I'm gonna put it back.

You don't go gambling with my baby's money.

1214

If I don't pay him,
the man don't come, ain't playing.

1215

I don't care what you took it for.

1216
01:33:29,409 --> 01:33:31,199
I save for China Doll

and you ain't got not business
putting your fingers on it.

There's got to be some line
you won't cross, Ty.

1221
01:33:41,544 --> 01:33:43,746
There's got to be something you won't do.

1222

The world start throwing me a break woman,

maybe I'll catch religion
and walk the straight and narrow

1224
01:33:47,647 --> 01:33:50,944
like those Bible thumpers you
sit up with. But until that day...

I appreciate the opportunity.

Right.

1232

I know every one of Guitar Sam's songs.

I know the chords, I know the words.

1234

China Doll was saying
how you was famous once.

1235

I was known,

1236

but never what you call famous.

the name of Joe Dudlow.

1241
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:36,650
He'd had a stroke on one side.

1242
01:35:37,849 --> 01:35:40,207
Curled him all up.

1243
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:43,366
Kept on plugging.

1244
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:51,043
I used to come out and
play his left hand for him.

1245

This one night,

1246
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:55,821
he was going hot and heavy.

01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:00,159
Joe just passed,

01:36:00,194 --> 01:36:01,864
right at the piano,

middle of Black Bottom Stomp.

1250

They propped him up at the bar,

1251
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:11,615
stuck a drink in his hand...

1252
01:36:13,174 --> 01:36:18,331
Told me to keep pounding those ivories.

1253
01:36:19,891 --> 01:36:24,249
There was a meanness
hanging over them juke joints.

There was murder in the air.

This is you.

1259
01:36:41,342 --> 01:36:43,606
Big band days on the road.

1260
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:48,579
Reginald Erskine.
I don't believe I've heard of him.

1261
01:36:48,914 --> 01:36:51,997
Big, tall, light skin fella outta Carolina.

1262
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:55,775
Said he was part Cherokee.

1263
01:36:56,934 --> 01:36:58,719
Couldn't play nothing,

1264
01:36:58,754 --> 01:37:02,732
but he'd wave his little stick
and he had this long greasy hair

1265
01:37:02,767 --> 01:37:05,351
he'd through around like Cab Calloway.

1266
01:37:06,386 --> 01:37:08,055
And you were the piano man?

1267
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:12,003
Piano man, arranger, you name it.

1268
01:37:12,428 --> 01:37:15,227
That must have been something,
travelling the country first class.

1269
01:37:15,262 --> 01:37:19,725
I don't know about first class,
but I seen the country.

1270
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:22,544
How come you stopped?

1271
01:37:25,703 --> 01:37:29,166
I got tired of carrying
another man's water.

1272
01:37:29,501 --> 01:37:33,779
Didn't want to die in no
coloured hotel some night

1273
01:37:33,814 --> 01:37:35,918
in who knows where Arkansas.

1274
01:37:39,616 --> 01:37:41,060
Met Delilah.

1275
01:37:42,495 --> 01:37:44,294
Wanted something of my own.

1276
01:37:48,893 --> 01:37:51,611
You don't have nothing
to worry about, Mr Pine Top.

Good evening, welcome to the

She won't let you down, Ty.
- This ain't going to work, is it?

01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:52,658
You just got to play it out and see.
- Guitar Sam!

1316
01:40:52,993 --> 01:40:55,152
See if you can push another round
of drinks while I stall 'em.

1317
01:40:55,487 --> 01:40:56,257
Then you going to bring him out?

1318
01:40:56,292 --> 01:40:59,790
Hey! We come here to hear
the guitar man play!

Be on the wires.

Give them three bars, then you pull it.
- Guitar Sam!

Look, I got a baseball bat under the
counter but you out here all alone.

Just get the liquor moving, Mace.

where you can run with it.

The Lord don't want nobody
to sit back and suffer.

He want you to rise up.

1329

and come down to the merciful arms
of his eternal salvation.

Anybody out there tonight
want to answer his call?

Anybody out there tonight, is gonna
step forward and be saved?

1334
01:41:52,542 --> 01:41:55,251
Ain't no time to hesitate.

1335
01:41:55,286 --> 01:41:58,485
Got to come on down
and offer yourself to the Lord.

1336
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,049
Come on. Come on, come on, sister.

1337
01:42:02,384 --> 01:42:05,582
I believe you hear the
Lord's voice talking to you sister.

1338
01:42:05,617 --> 01:42:08,401
That's the Lord's voice
and I believe you hear it.

1339
01:42:09,136 --> 01:42:10,325
I do believe you hear it.

1340
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,458
Come on down.
Bring it on down to his salvation.

1341
01:42:14,893 --> 01:42:17,062
Feel the Lord at your back.

1342
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:21,935
You got to leave them sinners behind.
Come on down.

1343
01:42:23,494 --> 01:42:25,938
Come on down.

1344
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,097
I see you sister, coming.

1345
01:42:28,132 --> 01:42:30,571
I see the Lord is talking to you.

1346
01:42:30,606 --> 01:42:33,467
I hear the Lord is talking to you.

1347
01:42:33,902 --> 01:42:36,494
I believe you hear him, sister.

1348
01:42:36,829 --> 01:42:41,307
Come on down,
you hear the voice of the Lord?

1349
01:42:41,342 --> 01:42:43,523
You hear the voice of the Lord.

1350
01:42:43,558 --> 01:42:45,670
That voice is trying to tell you

1351
01:42:45,705 --> 01:42:48,543
where you need to be right now, sister.

1352

by that front door

you just step out and walk away
from the club, you hear?

1362
01:43:22,384 --> 01:43:23,788
What's gonna go wrong?

You know that, right?

1371
01:43:49,889 --> 01:43:51,192
I know that, Daddy.

Go on, now.

1373

Well, you look like something
that would come out of New Orleans.

1374

My what?

1376

Your hook-up, where your
electricity comes in. It was all...

1377
01:44:13,443 --> 01:44:16,570
Ty, we've got a situation out there.

1378

You don't think I know that?
- Got the law in the house.

Didn't think we'd be seeing you so soon.

You got a real nice crowd

We got ourselves
this special attraction. See...

01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:45,189
Chicken.
- Huh?

1384
01:44:45,524 --> 01:44:47,703
Them ribs outside smell real good,

1385
01:44:47,838 --> 01:44:49,027
but I'm afraid my heart's set

1386
01:44:49,062 --> 01:44:51,580
on some of your wife Delilah's
fried chicken.

1387
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,204
Right.

1388

Eufala and he ate all the drumsticks.

Maybe, if you would come back here
a little bit later.

1394

Regular or spicy?

1395
01:45:21,808 --> 01:45:24,407
They both take the same time to
fix up. I just got to know which.

1396
01:45:28,484 --> 01:45:31,663
I have to make mine regular,
I'm afraid, ma'am.

1397
01:45:31,798 --> 01:45:33,167
Spicy's just fine,

to nip at me later.
