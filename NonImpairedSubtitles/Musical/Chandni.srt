1
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:11,557
l love you.

2
00:00:14,404 --> 00:00:16,735
l love you.

3
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:20,105
These two simple words...

4
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:25,041
Who knows who were
the first to use them?

5
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,915
Whom did he say them to?

6
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:31,513
Whenever these words of love...

7
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,348
... were uttered by anyone...

8
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:39,857
The beautiful, innocent were
attracted like crazy magnets.

9
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:34,751
Work fast or you'll
never complete in time!

10
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,293
- The stage isn't ready as yet!
- lt will be.

11
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:43,531
We'll have flowers there
and chandeliers in the center.

12
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,238
Don't ruin the flowers.
What are you doing?

13
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,106
You take the flowers
and give this to me.

14
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,785
Brother is coming today.
Has somebody gone to the station?

15
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,287
l've sent Anand.

16
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,794
Guess who this is.

17
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:20,306
One who can't be seen
in the daylight.

18
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,344
My moon like daughter.

19
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:25,641
The Chandni (moonlight)!

20
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:28,643
Why did you have to guess so easily?

21
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:36,190
Till the daughter is at home,
she is recognized.

22
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:40,929
But when she gets married
and belongs to somebody else..

23
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,330
Every relation ends.

24
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:49,240
l've come for Neelu's wedding
but you're getting me married off!

25
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:53,604
- l'm not getting married...
- After putting the frills...

26
00:02:56,784 --> 00:03:01,484
- How are you aunt?
- l am fine.

27
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,191
But why are you so impatient?

28
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:06,755
Why have got applied this paste?

29
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:09,356
Should we get you also married?

30
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,896
My foot will get married!

31
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,965
- How are you dear?
- Very well.

32
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,968
- Where is Neelu?
- Upstairs in her room.

33
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:27,774
Couldn't you come earlier?

34
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:29,983
There was so much work at home.

35
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:33,521
- He should get leave.
- Some excuse always.

36
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:39,829
- You've come like a guest.
- Let go!

37
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:42,431
- Just 2 days before the wedding!
- l'll answer when you leave me.

38
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:45,936
You're hugging the dust and
grime of the journey and my clothes!

39
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:49,734
Does the moonlight ever
get dirty because of dust?

40
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:58,714
Good God! What was that blast?

41
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:04,049
- That's his style of coming home.
- Who is it who comes like a bomb?

42
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,488
He's Anand's best friend, Rohit.

43
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,457
Who has put rags
in place of canopy?

44
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,658
- That was me sir.
- You?

45
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,567
This darned and sheet put up for
Rohit Gupta's sister's wedding!

46
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:19,538
Sir, now you won't
see them anywhere.

47
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,335
Remove them fast! Quick!

48
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,013
Have the flowers arrived?

49
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:41,623
Check if my bags have come up.
And give me a dress to wear.

50
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:44,831
We didn't meet for a year and
you've learnt yours and mine!

51
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:46,834
All my clothes are yours.

52
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,308
- Where is Chandni?
- Must be loafing somewhere.

53
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,681
l was feeling cold.
Want to warm up my hands.

54
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,357
Warming up your eyes or your hands?

55
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:37,792
Come on. Go away.

56
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:44,669
Do you know why it turned dark?

57
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:50,374
So that it would only be
bright enough for me to see you.

58
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:53,474
And you see only me.

59
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:00,385
When the Maker must have made you..

60
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:05,151
Even he must have been
swayed at least once.

61
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,957
Maybe you don't know
how beautiful you are.

62
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:16,439
So beautiful that the word
beautiful falls short.

63
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:20,043
People have a tendency
to beat around the bush.

64
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,610
But l speak the truth
and to the point.

65
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:28,884
l love you as much as nobody
must have ever loved another!

66
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,917
By now maybe you
too love me that much.

67
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,989
Yes or no?

68
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:43,769
Let me tell you another thing.

69
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:48,941
We Delhites can rule the
country as well as the heart!

70
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:52,304
We will win the heart!

71
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,960
Nobody ever spoke to me
like this in Shahjahanpur.

72
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,559
l was only my mother's daughter.

73
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,062
My heart would beat there too.

74
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:20,908
But in Delhi l can hear
my heart beat!

75
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:42,661
l came from the village.

76
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:48,366
When the time came to leave,
l started howling.

77
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:52,610
l kept crying and held my
grandmother and said..

78
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:55,783
l know nothing.

79
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,178
What will happen? l know nothing!

80
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:05,827
Come dear. You too
listen to this story.

81
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:10,796
No teacher can teach you this.

82
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:13,002
Come and sit with brother.

83
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:23,080
Aunt you were telling us
about your honeymoon.

84
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:26,681
ln our days, we had
a room of cow dung.

85
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:30,512
l fell asleep waiting.

86
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:33,485
Only then did your uncle come in.

87
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:38,663
Now only he and l were in the room.

88
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:47,539
Seeing me asleep,
he pinched me hard!

89
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,241
What's wrong with you?
l was pinched 55 years ago.

90
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:55,177
And you're feeling the hurt today?

91
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,778
Nothing aunt.

92
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,413
The romance has just begun.

93
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:08,088
Then slowly your uncle
caught my hand.

94
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,227
- Let go of me!
- That's just what l said.

95
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:15,404
- Then what happened?
- What would happen?

96
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:19,439
- Then he lifted me up.
- Then? Answer..

97
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:21,940
l know you are very impatient.

98
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:25,275
But nothing happened.

99
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:30,212
He turned that way and slept off
and l turned the other!

100
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,684
Does that mean that...
nothing happened?

101
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:38,260
For 6 years we did nothing.

102
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:45,233
The deed was done when
l turned 16 and he was 18.

103
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:47,698
These days everything is hurried.

104
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:49,805
Everything is instant.

105
00:14:54,617 --> 00:14:56,608
What do you say?

106
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:59,147
lncidentally everything is instant.

107
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:02,389
But when an accident takes place...

108
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:07,820
We say, seasons keep changing
but spring has just arrived.

109
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:09,498
Yes or no?

110
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:15,838
You've got the right note.

111
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:17,973
Hopefully the tune will be good.

112
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:29,346
Yes or no?

113
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:34,350
Come on answer, yes or no?

114
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:38,022
- Will you serve or just ask?
- Serving!

115
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:08,261
Henna is being applied to my palms
but the color is on your cheeks?

116
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:11,395
This color is like a rainbow.

117
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:15,638
lt is seen but can't be caught.

118
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:22,571
lf the bride to be places her
hennaed hand in a spinster's hands...

119
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,250
She'll get engaged
and married right away.

120
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,985
But if a boy holds a girl's hand...?

121
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,621
Then they fall in love. lsn't it?

122
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:26,181
Why are you pouncing on them?

123
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,920
The bride has gone but the
photographs aren't running away.

124
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:33,991
Your wife is running away. She
insists on leaving by evening.

125
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:39,399
Are you all leaving today?

126
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,637
- lt's a matter of my job.
- Dad, wedding photographs.

127
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,673
Chandni has leave. Neelu has
gone to her husband's house.

128
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:51,512
lf she stayed back,
she'd share our loneliness.

129
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:56,547
Has the goddess of wealth and
a daughter ever stayed in one place?

130
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:58,379
She may stay if she feels like it.

131
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:02,056
At least now come and help me pack.

132
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,352
Yelling won't help pack. Here.

133
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:24,047
Will you stay?

134
00:19:27,587 --> 00:19:30,318
- Yes aunt.
- Are you happy?

135
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,923
Yes l'm very happy.

136
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:39,129
You're my favorite. That's why
l'm keeping you back to love you more.

137
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:42,232
Does she only know how to
take love or even give?

138
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:45,736
lf there's a tiny bit
of place in her heart...

139
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,806
l'll send in an application.

140
00:19:48,077 --> 00:19:51,640
When you fool around, you don't
care if there are grown ups around!

141
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:53,371
Coming.

142
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:58,221
Don't the people in
Delhi have any shame?

143
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:03,918
lf l feel shame, l'll be waving
a flag atop Qutub Minar all my life!

144
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:08,198
Only if l be shameless
will l climb astride the horse.

145
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:11,664
- Yes or no?
- You clicked even the horse.

146
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:13,996
But kept flashing lights at me!

147
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,808
- There's no picture of me!
- First answer yes or no.

148
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:21,375
- lf l say no?
- l won't come on a horse.

149
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:23,979
Will you sit on a donkey then?

150
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:26,547
l will...

151
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:45,698
No! l'm frightened!

152
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:49,878
l'm with you!

153
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:57,119
- l will die! - l won't
let you die before you answer!

154
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:01,755
- l will fall off!
- Then come closer.

155
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:06,231
- l am scared.
- Then hold me tight!

156
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,964
Yes or no?

157
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,968
- Yes or no?
- Yes!

158
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,311
- Louder, l can't hear.
- Yes! Yes!

159
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:11,737
When will you come again?

160
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:16,066
-When you call me.
- Give me your address. l'll write.

161
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:20,714
- lf mother finds out...
- l'll write at some friend's address.

162
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:31,191
Letter! A letter from your lover!

163
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:36,332
Give it to me! Don't trouble me!

164
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:39,631
First l'll read it.

165
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:41,804
lt came to my address.
l have a right to read it.

166
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:48,045
According to our deal, l will
read it and you will hear.

167
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:55,477
- Just hold this.
- Cheat!

168
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:59,654
l'll show you when
the next letter comes!

169
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:16,837
Should l call you the
breeze or the desire of time?

170
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:20,837
The beat of my heart or
the fragrance of my breath?

171
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,779
Flowers bloom when l think of you.

172
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:30,592
When dawn breaks it feels as if
you are tossing your hair in dew.

173
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:34,058
And l'm kissing your eyes.

174
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:38,764
The golden afternoon feels as if
the moonlight has come to earth.

175
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:44,369
The setting sun adorns you
with orange blossoms.

176
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:47,838
And your fragrance reaches me.

177
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,449
When night spreads
her cloak of darkness...

178
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:56,154
l swear l miss you a lot!

179
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:03,491
The full moon stops in its'
orbit to admire your beauty.

180
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:09,529
l shut my eyes and
Chandni enters my heart.

181
00:29:10,337 --> 00:29:12,863
Yours and only yours.

182
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:27,287
What do l write?
Time has come to a standstill.

183
00:29:28,023 --> 00:29:33,724
Time, night, breeze, fragrance,
everything holds its' breath and...

184
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,626
Waits for me to write something.

185
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:38,357
But how can the feelings
of the heart form words?

186
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:42,298
All your favorite things are present.

187
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:47,738
Jasmine flowers, a smiling flame
and your Chandni.

188
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:51,148
l wish you were here.

189
00:29:51,783 --> 00:29:54,013
But how can you be here?

190
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:56,783
But you are here.

191
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,592
ln my heart and its' beats.

192
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:06,863
Soon our hearts will beat like one.

193
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,930
My parents will return tomorrow.
l'll talk to them about our wedding.

194
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:15,935
You want to marry a girl
you saw in that crowd?

195
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,179
A girl who is not of our standing,
who is not from our community!

196
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,072
You want to make her the
daughter-in-law of our family?

197
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:23,784
What are you talking about?

198
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:26,988
l'm not the first man to do this.

199
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,420
When we buy furniture we first
check if it matches in our house.

200
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:37,326
The girl l love is
furniture for you?

201
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:42,069
This word, love has been used
so often that it has lost meaning!

202
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,471
Why do you forget that she
will get married and come here?

203
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,645
- We'll have to adjust with her!
- Understand one thing mother.

204
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,542
l'm not marrying her for you.

205
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,275
Neither do l believe in caste,
community and society norms.

206
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:56,682
l haven't come to ask you
nor to take your permission.

207
00:30:56,889 --> 00:31:00,484
But only to inform you that
l am marrying her.

208
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:03,491
You only have to decide whether
you will bless us or not!

209
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:11,028
Stop him. lf she comes to
this house as a bride...

210
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:13,068
What face will l have in society?

211
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,842
Which society are you talking about?

212
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:19,112
Where your bank balance
decides your reputation?

213
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:21,439
That girl won't come to our house!

214
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:23,652
You can't darn silk with rags!

215
00:31:23,886 --> 00:31:27,151
That was done the day l came
to this house as a son-in-law.

216
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,516
And how will you stop him?

217
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,328
He's a man of today, your only son.

218
00:31:32,562 --> 00:31:35,861
Someday he'll leave everything
and walk off. Think about it.

219
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:41,128
Try to understand, weddings
are between people of same standing.

220
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:42,738
We have to live in this society.

221
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:47,344
The society that has accepted me
will accept her tomorrow.

222
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:51,877
Actually he knows he is our only son.

223
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:55,415
We can't go against his wishes.

224
00:31:56,855 --> 00:31:58,551
He's exploiting this fact.

225
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:04,659
- Talk to Shivsagar..
- What are you...?

226
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:06,991
But remember one thing.

227
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:11,032
The wedding should be
worthy of our position.

228
00:36:26,256 --> 00:36:29,191
They treated us very well!
This boy has dishonored us!

229
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:32,395
The daughter-in-law is the honor
and shame of the family, the house.

230
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:35,064
She remains behind curtains
and maintains her distance.

231
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,063
With her around we'll have a ball.

232
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:45,400
We'll see dances everyday.
The neighbors too won't get bored.

233
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,235
l still say break the relation.
lt's not too late!

234
00:36:49,783 --> 00:36:55,312
She didn't want to dance or sing.
Your darling son forced her into it.

235
00:36:55,689 --> 00:37:00,559
ln saving your reputation,
you may end up losing your son!

236
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:05,592
They will come tomorrow.
Rearrange your facial expressions.

237
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:07,634
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

238
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:20,875
Congratulations!
Happiness and joy!

239
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:22,642
Take our picture.

240
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:28,883
Mother you are forgetting
the bride-to-be.

241
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:42,297
- Live long son. - Today is also
the girl's day. Bless her also.

242
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:44,972
Always be happy.

243
00:37:56,957 --> 00:38:01,326
Our love and blessings are in
this ring. Be happy son.

244
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:11,167
The beauty of the ornament lies
in the wearer and love has no value.

245
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:14,541
The beauty also lies with
the person putting it on.

246
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:17,810
- Here put it on her finger.
- Yes.

247
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:27,683
Won't you give her any gift?

248
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:31,254
How can l forget my
future sister-in-law?

249
00:38:31,796 --> 00:38:36,791
l thought she's very fond of dancing
so what could be better than this?

250
00:38:39,304 --> 00:38:41,067
l am fond of dancing but..

251
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:46,873
On this auspicious occasion
only you could give such a gift!

252
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:54,577
The brother will always remember
this gift of his sister!

253
00:38:56,757 --> 00:39:00,285
What's the matter?
Why are you upset?

254
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:05,396
l'm thinking of the future. Chandni
will be stifled in that house!

255
00:39:05,768 --> 00:39:10,705
l didn't know they
would behave like this.

256
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:13,473
What do they think of themselves!

257
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,541
They belong to a rich family.
lt's the arrogance of money!

258
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,678
We didn't go begging to them!

259
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,952
- We are happy as we are!
- What's the fight about?

260
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:26,752
Think about Chandni
and her happiness

261
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:31,656
l am confident Rohit
will look after her.

262
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:36,795
And l know nobody can be angry
with my daughter for very long.

263
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:40,400
Once they get married,
she'll win everybody's hearts.

264
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:42,706
l hope this happens.

265
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:00,187
Are you mad?

266
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:03,163
Did you get frightened?

267
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,802
Close your eyes.

268
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,736
What will you do to me
with my eyes closed?

269
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:14,132
What can a poor girl do to you?

270
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:18,277
- How can l trust you?
- Oh! Can't trust me now?

271
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,278
Today l'm going to get raped!

272
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,210
- Will you shut your eyes?
- But why?

273
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,451
Open your mouth.

274
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,497
Taste this and identify it.

275
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:39,663
This is barfi from Ghantewala.

276
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:43,000
Now let's see. What is this?

277
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:58,822
What is this? Laddu.

278
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:05,061
Now let me see.
Don't open your eyes.

279
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:14,200
Chilli !

280
00:41:14,878 --> 00:41:15,936
You didn't say what it is.

281
00:41:18,249 --> 00:41:20,308
Can't you eat one
single chilli for me?

282
00:41:20,618 --> 00:41:24,850
l can consume poison for you.
What did she get!

283
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:31,793
Chandni! Where are you running?
Come and sit here.

284
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:46,843
We won't stay here for
one day after we get married.

285
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:51,047
Because your family, my relatives...

286
00:41:54,188 --> 00:41:59,058
They will bore us! Call us for
meals and ruin our nights!

287
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,919
So what do you want?

288
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:06,224
l want to take you away from here.

289
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,971
Where there is nobody
but you and me!

290
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:18,838
We'll have our
honeymoon in Switzerland.

291
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:25,718
What's wrong? Where are you?

292
00:42:56,958 --> 00:43:00,155
l can spend my whole
life with your love.

293
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:08,433
- Come here.
- Why?

294
00:43:08,905 --> 00:43:11,568
Come on. l feel like kissing you.

295
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:16,175
- l couldn't hear.
- Don't ruin my romance!

296
00:43:17,114 --> 00:43:22,143
An old joke. A fat man wants
to make love to a pretty girl.

297
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,956
The girl says, if you can
catch me, you can love me.

298
00:43:38,538 --> 00:43:41,632
So fat man, won't you kiss me?

299
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:44,442
l am dead. l can't answer you.

300
00:43:44,711 --> 00:43:46,839
l will bring you back to life.

301
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:58,921
Move and l shoot!

302
00:43:59,227 --> 00:44:03,722
Please don't. l'm the only husband
of my wife. What will happen to her?

303
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,595
Give me all the cash in your pocket!

304
00:44:10,006 --> 00:44:15,035
- Fast! Don't try to run.
- Just a minute. Absolutely.

305
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:18,079
l have just 3 francs left over.
You can have them.

306
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:20,513
Comes to Switzerland
and carries only 3 francs!

307
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:22,811
l don't know anything.
l want to go shopping!

308
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,716
Aren't you tired of shopping?
l'm carrying these bags like an ass!

309
00:44:26,592 --> 00:44:28,456
Let's go to the hotel and romance.

310
00:44:29,895 --> 00:44:31,192
All the valuables!

311
00:44:31,464 --> 00:44:33,955
Come to the hotel.
l'll give you everything.

312
00:44:36,535 --> 00:44:38,766
Okay. Hold this.

313
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:44,736
- Let this be.
- For ice cream.

314
00:44:47,715 --> 00:44:51,378
Get lost! Wants real stuff
for threatening with a toy gun!

315
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:10,639
May l taste it?

316
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:24,880
- May l ...?
- No way!

317
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:27,758
Had half of mine and
won't give hers!

318
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:35,832
Dropped my ice cream!
Give me a bite!

319
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:41,307
Tonight... yes or no?

320
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:45,340
- No, no.
- Come on, say yes or no.

321
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,548
- No mischief in this cold.
- What else can we do in the cold?

322
00:45:50,852 --> 00:45:53,116
lt's very cold today.

323
00:45:53,455 --> 00:45:57,688
We'll do one thing, go to
the hotel, l'll give you cognac.

324
00:46:00,463 --> 00:46:03,728
Cognac is brandy. Meaning liquor.

325
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:06,401
No. Cognac is not wine.

326
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:11,540
- Cognac is not liquor?
- No, cognac is not liquor.

327
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:34,865
- Good heavens! Cognac...
- ls not liquor.

328
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:36,592
What else is it?

329
00:46:36,936 --> 00:46:41,840
Romance, love.

330
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:47,208
Youth. lntoxication. Wow!

331
00:46:47,415 --> 00:46:54,412
Romance, love, youth,
intoxication, wow!

332
00:46:57,792 --> 00:46:59,784
Cognac is not liquor.

333
00:47:04,935 --> 00:47:07,369
We'll have a ball tonight!

334
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:11,665
We'll stay awake all night.
Talk of love.

335
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,210
While talking of love,
we will make love.

336
00:47:16,648 --> 00:47:20,880
Making love again we'll make love!

337
00:47:24,156 --> 00:47:27,216
Cognac is not liquor!

338
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:02,925
She is finished!

339
00:48:13,712 --> 00:48:23,588
Cognac is not liquor!

340
00:48:31,265 --> 00:48:34,200
Cognac is liquor!

341
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:24,755
- What are you doing?
- l was sleeping.

342
00:54:25,325 --> 00:54:29,990
- Give me a kiss.
- l'm sleeping now.

343
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:35,736
No, l won't give.

344
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:40,802
You woke me from a dream.

345
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,072
Fast give me a kiss.

346
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:56,787
Aunt has come!

347
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:00,689
From where do these aunts land up!

348
00:55:36,204 --> 00:55:38,400
Where were you? You took
ages to come to the phone!

349
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,632
- l was in the bathroom.
- What were you doing?

350
00:55:43,312 --> 00:55:47,340
- Please tell me.
- Having a bath! What else!

351
00:55:51,555 --> 00:55:53,283
What's the matter?

352
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:59,555
l'm dripping with water!

353
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:25,588
- What are you doing?
- Talking to you.

354
00:56:26,026 --> 00:56:28,085
What were you doing before that?

355
00:56:30,331 --> 00:56:33,425
Looking in the mirror.

356
00:56:33,902 --> 00:56:36,200
How did you find my Chandni?

357
00:56:37,138 --> 00:56:43,135
- l love myself today.
- And not me?

358
00:56:44,847 --> 00:56:48,375
Why don't you understand?
l love you.

359
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,212
That is why l like myself.

360
00:56:57,228 --> 00:56:59,958
When you call me yours...

361
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:03,759
l feel proud of myself.

362
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,423
Now what is it?

363
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:30,891
l want to meet you this evening.

364
00:57:33,568 --> 00:57:36,333
- But where?
- On the terrace of your house.

365
00:57:37,906 --> 00:57:40,535
- Our terrace?
- l'll wait for you.

366
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:48,217
- All right. l'll come.
- But as my Chandni.

367
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:54,589
- What do you mean?
- ln milky white clothes.

368
00:57:55,259 --> 00:57:56,625
From head to toe.

369
00:58:37,573 --> 00:58:38,630
Up here!

370
00:58:47,684 --> 00:58:48,742
You are mad!

371
00:59:00,365 --> 00:59:03,061
What are you doing? Are you mad?

372
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,034
This is my style.

373
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,302
Careful.

374
00:59:17,284 --> 00:59:18,581
Come back please!

375
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,584
Ramesh here.
Rohit met with an accident.

376
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:53,949
While landing. He's in the hospital.

377
01:00:09,308 --> 01:00:10,640
What happened?

378
01:00:11,144 --> 01:00:14,137
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

379
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:16,574
- Where is he? Can l see him?
- Not yet.

380
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,111
Not now? What do the doctors say?

381
01:00:19,387 --> 01:00:21,616
- Nothing can be said.
- What?

382
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:26,758
- ls he very serious?
- He's being operated upon.

383
01:00:41,677 --> 01:00:44,943
Do you know how this
accident occurred?

384
01:00:45,282 --> 01:00:47,512
- How?
- Because of her!

385
01:00:48,485 --> 01:00:50,419
She is very fond of flowers.

386
01:00:50,921 --> 01:00:55,518
To pamper her Rohit bought
flowers from all over town.

387
01:00:55,927 --> 01:00:58,294
He was showering her with flowers
when this accident took place!

388
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:02,396
This happened because of you!
What do you want from us?

389
01:01:02,668 --> 01:01:03,828
Why don't you go away from here?

390
01:01:05,504 --> 01:01:11,068
l can't leave before meeting
Rohit, without seeing him.

391
01:01:11,344 --> 01:01:15,873
No! You won't meet him or
see him! Go away from here!

392
01:01:16,383 --> 01:01:21,150
Just once mother.
Let me see him just once.

393
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:25,550
Then l'll do as you say.

394
01:01:26,293 --> 01:01:29,024
Let me meet him just once.

395
01:01:29,798 --> 01:01:31,163
Rohit has gained consciousness!

396
01:01:48,118 --> 01:01:51,247
You looked gorgeous from that height.

397
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,670
What's the matter?

398
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:17,147
What's wrong? Tell me.

399
01:02:18,052 --> 01:02:21,351
My right arm and leg aren't moving.

400
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:32,367
- What's wrong with me?
- Your right side is paralyzed.

401
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:40,038
Will l be able to walk?

402
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:43,739
Will l ever get well?

403
01:02:44,781 --> 01:02:50,584
Of course you will but you have to
use your determination and will power.

404
01:02:59,164 --> 01:03:00,860
You have to get well.

405
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:04,628
God has saved you for me.

406
01:03:06,206 --> 01:03:10,142
Now your life is
a trust meant for me.

407
01:03:19,653 --> 01:03:23,954
Welcome home smiling face, dark hair.

408
01:03:25,995 --> 01:03:29,021
Take me to my room.

409
01:03:48,953 --> 01:03:52,481
One thing is for sure,
Rohit brought joy home.

410
01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:58,458
Tell you something? The nurses
in the hospital were very pretty.

411
01:03:58,898 --> 01:04:00,728
Had l stayed longer,
l would've had an affair.

412
01:04:01,501 --> 01:04:03,969
l was in a hurry to get back.

413
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,807
Why did you become silent?

414
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:45,912
Hearing voices from the past l feel..

415
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:47,851
Time has stood still.

416
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:52,522
Don't hold back time. Let it go on.

417
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:57,626
Will those days ever return?

418
01:04:58,697 --> 01:05:01,427
Yes, those days will return.

419
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:03,300
l have full faith.

420
01:05:05,505 --> 01:05:07,302
Your faith is my life.

421
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:14,108
And your life is my life.

422
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:19,620
Today if l ask you for something,
promise you won't turn me down.

423
01:05:21,056 --> 01:05:22,921
Do you expect me to refuse?

424
01:05:23,692 --> 01:05:25,684
Every word of yours is my promise.

425
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:35,337
From now onwards whenever l open
my eyes, l should see you before me.

426
01:05:38,342 --> 01:05:41,834
Today onwards my morning
will begin with your smile.

427
01:05:44,948 --> 01:05:49,682
And night will set under
the darkness of your lashes.

428
01:06:00,934 --> 01:06:02,161
What are you doing here?

429
01:06:03,002 --> 01:06:07,099
Can't you see mummy?
She's making breakfast for Rohit.

430
01:06:07,374 --> 01:06:10,276
Are we no more that you will
make breakfast for my son?

431
01:06:12,413 --> 01:06:14,574
She's establishing her
rights before marriage.

432
01:06:15,149 --> 01:06:17,845
She comes here every morning.
She's really shameless!

433
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,653
Not shameless, very clever.

434
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:25,889
She thinks if she can win Rohit's
heart, all the wealth will be hers!

435
01:06:26,228 --> 01:06:27,560
Are you listening to us?

436
01:06:29,097 --> 01:06:33,194
She thinks she can pull us away
from Rohit by doing all this.

437
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:38,873
The world will laugh, not yet
married but always around my son!

438
01:06:39,276 --> 01:06:43,337
Do whatever you want, you cannot
become the mistress of this house!

439
01:06:43,581 --> 01:06:44,844
Go away from here!

440
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:48,346
Keep the tray back.

441
01:06:51,389 --> 01:06:53,449
Don't you dare step
in my kitchen again!

442
01:07:08,408 --> 01:07:10,809
Don't cry for every little thing.

443
01:07:11,212 --> 01:07:15,672
Your tears will dry up but
they won't appreciate them.

444
01:07:17,252 --> 01:07:20,689
You've lost so soon.
You have major battles to win.

445
01:07:21,623 --> 01:07:26,618
What do l do? Mother gets
angry at every thing.

446
01:07:27,596 --> 01:07:31,829
And Pooja always hated me.

447
01:07:33,103 --> 01:07:36,266
Actually they want you
to get fed up and leave.

448
01:07:38,142 --> 01:07:40,076
Don't they want Rohit to be happy?

449
01:07:40,478 --> 01:07:46,213
They do but they want him
to be happy in their choice.

450
01:07:46,785 --> 01:07:48,980
And you're not their choice.

451
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:56,625
lf Rohit sees tears in
your eyes, he will break down.

452
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:01,858
So bear everything, put up with it.

453
01:08:02,836 --> 01:08:05,828
Take everything with a smile.

454
01:08:07,207 --> 01:08:12,077
For Rohit if not yourself.
For his happiness.

455
01:08:13,181 --> 01:08:15,615
You are right.

456
01:12:49,689 --> 01:12:51,452
She dropped brother! Come fast!

457
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:54,318
Good God! What happened to my son?

458
01:12:54,761 --> 01:12:57,822
What do you want to do? Kill him?

459
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:03,933
- Nothing happened. - Of course,
you fell because of her carelessness!

460
01:13:04,372 --> 01:13:08,672
She's always dancing and singing!
Why don't you find another house?

461
01:13:09,645 --> 01:13:11,408
- Do you know what you're saying?
- She is right.

462
01:13:11,748 --> 01:13:16,514
Since the time she stepped into
my house, my son has been ruined!

463
01:13:16,919 --> 01:13:19,650
- She's cast a spell on him!
- What are you saying?

464
01:13:20,023 --> 01:13:23,425
- Listen to what l have to say.
- Son, you are unwell.

465
01:13:23,761 --> 01:13:26,730
- You need complete rest.
- Pooja has accused Chandni..

466
01:13:26,964 --> 01:13:28,829
l want peace in this house!

467
01:13:29,033 --> 01:13:31,524
-But what's her fault?
- You keep... - Daddy...!

468
01:13:33,171 --> 01:13:34,159
Unnecessarily Pooja...

469
01:13:34,371 --> 01:13:37,273
You must rest son.
Pooja take him in.

470
01:13:38,044 --> 01:13:40,204
No need. l'll go on my own.

471
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:52,850
Listen to one thing carefully.
Rohit is my only son.

472
01:13:53,293 --> 01:13:55,785
l don't want to lose him
because of you.

473
01:13:57,431 --> 01:14:00,594
Very shameless girl! Standing here
after listening to all this!

474
01:14:00,834 --> 01:14:04,397
Please be quiet. This is enough!

475
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:12,575
Now go home.
They won't let you live.

476
01:15:09,145 --> 01:15:11,978
Are you angry with me?

477
01:15:13,182 --> 01:15:14,480
No.

478
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:27,863
l've brought something for you.
Shut your eyes.

479
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,528
l'll put it in your mouth
and you must identify it.

480
01:15:31,035 --> 01:15:35,769
- Why shut my eyes?
- l won't give you chilies!

481
01:15:37,943 --> 01:15:39,035
Feed me like this.

482
01:15:42,648 --> 01:15:45,947
Don't you trust me?

483
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,245
l don't trust myself.

484
01:15:51,224 --> 01:15:55,025
- You did till yesterday.
- There's a lot of difference today.

485
01:15:56,664 --> 01:16:00,725
- What difference?
- Yesterday was a dream.

486
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,028
Today is real.

487
01:16:04,873 --> 01:16:08,206
Real, dream, yesterday, today...
l don't understand...

488
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:11,880
Why don't you understand?
l'm not the man you loved!

489
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,478
With whom you sang and danced!

490
01:16:15,051 --> 01:16:17,747
How long will l amuse myself
with memories of the past?

491
01:16:18,355 --> 01:16:21,552
Why are you being so emotional?

492
01:16:22,292 --> 01:16:26,228
Emotions are all l have now.

493
01:16:26,396 --> 01:16:30,731
Everything else is...
All the dreams have crashed.

494
01:16:32,972 --> 01:16:38,308
They haven't crashed.
Our dreams will come true.

495
01:16:38,777 --> 01:16:42,441
How? With this handicapped,
cripple, helpless Rohit?

496
01:16:43,949 --> 01:16:47,010
You can't use these words to
describe yourself when l'm here!

497
01:16:47,888 --> 01:16:52,086
lf you could revolt against your
parents and society for me...

498
01:16:52,459 --> 01:16:56,920
Then can't l become your legs?

499
01:17:00,668 --> 01:17:02,899
l'll be your better half in
the true sense of the word.

500
01:17:03,405 --> 01:17:07,705
l'll be your hope, your strength.

501
01:17:08,611 --> 01:17:09,941
Your belief.

502
01:17:10,546 --> 01:17:12,014
Why don't you try to understand?

503
01:23:10,314 --> 01:23:13,875
Who did all this?

504
01:23:14,918 --> 01:23:16,352
l did it.

505
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:21,252
- You?
- Yes.

506
01:23:23,194 --> 01:23:27,427
l don't need the
memories attached to them.

507
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:33,701
Don't say that. Our love is
tied by very delicate threads.

508
01:23:34,007 --> 01:23:36,999
That is pity not love.

509
01:23:37,877 --> 01:23:40,345
And l don't want to
live with anyone's pity.

510
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:47,685
What is wrong with you?
What made you change in one night?

511
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:52,088
There is no place for
your love in my life.

512
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:59,559
lt's not so easy to erase love.

513
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:03,906
l'm not lifeless
like these pictures!

514
01:24:04,474 --> 01:24:06,237
l'm a living girl.

515
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:09,175
ln whose chest beats a heart.

516
01:24:09,747 --> 01:24:12,648
l have feelings, a brain that thinks!

517
01:24:15,019 --> 01:24:18,012
By removing the pictures,
the symbol of our love...

518
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:24,324
You've white washed the walls but
put the color of hatred on our love!

519
01:24:24,963 --> 01:24:28,297
Those pictures reminded me of
the moments that l can't forget!

520
01:24:28,801 --> 01:24:31,635
Your beauty, your smile,
your youth makes fun of me!

521
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,264
Your singing to
please me stinks of pity!

522
01:24:35,108 --> 01:24:36,803
You want me to be dependant on you.

523
01:24:37,177 --> 01:24:39,202
No! lt's better to die
than live like that!

524
01:24:43,317 --> 01:24:47,151
Don't say that.

525
01:24:49,324 --> 01:24:53,590
Your life is more precious to me
than anything in this world.

526
01:24:54,630 --> 01:25:01,901
l know today your heart is
filled with hatred not love.

527
01:25:04,507 --> 01:25:06,135
Yet l ask you one question.

528
01:25:07,078 --> 01:25:13,574
lf l was in your place and you
in mine, what would you have done?

529
01:25:29,836 --> 01:25:33,966
l would have left you much earlier.

530
01:25:57,433 --> 01:26:01,393
l feel sorry for your pettiness.

531
01:26:02,472 --> 01:26:06,169
You don't know the meaning of love.

532
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:11,477
Love is a gift of God not charity!

533
01:26:12,383 --> 01:26:19,552
You're talking of the girl who
was your heartbeat, your breath!

534
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:25,723
- Your love!
- What has that love given me?

535
01:26:26,999 --> 01:26:28,934
You got everything!

536
01:26:30,036 --> 01:26:31,731
Family, name, wealth!

537
01:26:32,038 --> 01:26:34,166
And l have got venom!

538
01:26:34,675 --> 01:26:36,643
Defamation! Restlessness!

539
01:26:37,378 --> 01:26:39,073
lt snatched away
the peace of my life!

540
01:26:39,347 --> 01:26:43,681
The girl you talk of made me a
cripple instead of giving me life!

541
01:26:45,353 --> 01:26:48,380
What? You too accuse me?

542
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:52,085
l made you a cripple?

543
01:26:52,295 --> 01:26:55,162
Yes! Till yesterday only my
family and the world said this.

544
01:26:55,464 --> 01:26:59,195
But today even l say you
crippled me! ln body and spirit!

545
01:27:03,106 --> 01:27:09,137
All right. lf like your family
and the world, you too believe..

546
01:27:09,914 --> 01:27:13,611
That l crippled you.

547
01:27:15,153 --> 01:27:17,588
l have no right to live in this house.

548
01:27:17,923 --> 01:27:19,948
Nor any right on you.

549
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:24,026
l'm taking your gift of love with me.

550
01:27:25,497 --> 01:27:29,059
You may live with hatred.

551
01:27:30,103 --> 01:27:33,470
l will live with my love.
