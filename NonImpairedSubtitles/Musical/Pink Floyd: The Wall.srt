1
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:08,345
Christmas comes but once a year

2
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:12,791
For every girl and boy

00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:16,952

And goodness knows

12
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:34,552
He didn't want a lot

13
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:39,822
He sent a note to Santa

14
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:44,823
For some soldiers and a drum

15
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:48,304
lt broke his little heart

16
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:53,673
When he found Santa hadn't come

17
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:56,427
ln the street he envies

All those lucky boys

19
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,271
Easy. Be careful.

20
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,670
- What?
- Will you put me on there?

21
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:56,712
- Well, where's your mother then?
- She's gone to the shops.

22
00:14:57,474 --> 00:14:58,873
Yes, all right.

23
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:03,553
How's that then? Enjoying it?

24
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:10,869
Lovely, lovely.

25
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,751
Now off you go.
Go on.

26
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:28,784
Now what have l told you about this?
What have l told you?

27
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:32,708
Go on, go on now. Sling your hook.
Go on. Sling your hook.

28
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:17,985
Wait for me, Pinky,
you rotten bleeder.

29
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:21,066
- They're my bullets, ain't they?
- I don't know.

30
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,590
Come on, Tubs.
lt's great down in the tunnel.

31
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,909
Don't you think
it'd be dangerous, Pinky?

32
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,828
No. Don't be daft.

33
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:43,108
- You all right, Tubs?
- Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit.

34
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:53,264
- Come on.
- Na. lt's too dangerous.

35
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,788
- We'll wait for the train.
- Give me the torch.

36
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:08,468
Pinky! Here comes the train!

37
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:10,988
Get off the line,
you bloody idiot! Here it comes!

38
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:15,113
Pinky, get off the line!

39
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:38,426
You!

40
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:45,023
You! Yes, you!

41
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,911
Stand still, laddie!

42
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:35,068
What have we here. laddie?

43
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:38,385
Mysterious scribblings?
A secret code?

44
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:41,949
No. Poems, no less.

45
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,229
Poems, everybody!

46
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:46,424
The lad here reckons himself
a poet.

47
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:50,672
''Money, get back.
l'm all right, Jack.

48
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:53,911
Keep your hands
off my stack.

49
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:57,270
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream.

50
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:00,505
Think l'll buy me
a football team.''

51
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:03,193
Absolute rubbish, laddie!

52
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:06,590
Get on with your work.

53
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:08,232
Repeat after me:

54
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:11,511
An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

55
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:13,903
whose length is one furlong...

56
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,673
and whose width is one chain.

57
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:41,224
Wrong! Do it again!

58
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,792
lf you don't eat your meat,
you can't have any pudding!

59
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:04,027
How can you have any pudding
if you don't eat your meat?

60
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:09,948
You! Yes, you, laddie!

61
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:13,310
Poems, everybody.
The lad here reckons himself a poet.

62
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:04,831
Again. An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

63
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:07,149
whose length is one furlong...

64
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:09,987
and whose width is one chain.

65
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:55,706
Hello. Hello.

Will you accept the charge
from the United States?

71
00:36:01,554 --> 00:36:03,943

72
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,064

73
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:12,149

74
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:14,304

00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:42,745
Oh, my God.

78
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:51,746
- Are all these your guitars?

79
00:44:06,594 --> 00:44:08,585
- God.

80
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:11,512
This place is bigger
than our whole apartment.

81
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,309
- You like the tube, huh?

82
00:44:30,354 --> 00:44:33,346
Can I get a drink of water?

83
00:44:36,554 --> 00:44:40,149
- Can l get you a drink of water?

84
00:44:55,914 --> 00:44:59,509
- Oh, wow, look at this tub!

00:44:59,554 --> 00:45:01,988
Wanna take a bath?

86

87
00:45:22,194 --> 00:45:24,947

He's gone completely round
the bleedin' twist.

94
01:06:24,434 --> 01:06:27,312
You vicious bastard,
you never did like me, did you?

95
01:06:56,914 --> 01:07:00,907
- The boy's an asthmatic.

He's coming around!
There, you see!
