2
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,981
No...Searching!

3
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,961
-What happened?
-Nothing.

4
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,968
One of my clients has
a criminal network in Mattancherry.

5
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,263
Goondas will not work out.

6
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,800
Right! As Vasanth Comrade has
intervened, such things won't work.

7
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,774
-Vasanthetta had called up.
-Come inside and talk.

8
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,949
Vasanthetta called me sometime back.

9
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,853
He said that he's proceeding
towards the traced route and cut the line...

10
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,999
Good Lord! We're finished! Pappettan!

11
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,867
Convening a meeting at home after
your daughter eloped with somebody?

12
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,802
Come inside, we can talk.

13
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,808
Long ago, when l'd told that
she'd the tendency to elope,

14
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,813
his wife rebuked me for
talking ill of her daughter!

15
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,182
l'll give you a whack!
Take off your hand!

16
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,287
-Call the Police!-Sit down here.

17
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:25,956
Did you come here to tarnish our name?

18
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,850
ls what l'm saying tarnishing?!

19
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,116
Please talk softly

20
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,293
lt wouldn't matter if he was a
good and handsome guy!

21
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,892
He neither has education nor money!

22
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,193
So dark is his colour and
so ugly is his face!

23
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,295
Oh God! May You protect
our girl from any physical abuse!

24
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,178
You've framed and kept his photo!!

25
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,384
Only if she doesn't elope,
it's a wonder!

26
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,413
Seeing this rascal only,
she's learning it - Bloody love!!

27
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,851
Don't gape...Pick up the call.

28
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,297
Tell me, Vasantha!

29
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:08,793
Really?

30
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,965
Thank you, thank you, Vasantha!

31
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,108
He found her!
On seeing Vasanthan, he fled away.

32
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,784
Why don't we take her to a doctor?

33
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,716
As she nearly spent 5 - 8 hrs
with that boy!

34
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,793
Will you just shut up?

35
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,238
Don't ask her anything.
Let her rest for a while.

36
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,240
Go....You also go.

37
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,450
Let's take her to a psychologist!

38
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,986
Counselling will be good!

39
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:12,324
Yes, definitely!
Her mind must be totally disturbed!

40
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,299
Counselling will be a better solution.

41
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,398
l'm not mad.

42
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,804
Who told you falling in love is madness?

43
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:22,700
Then?

44
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,967
lt's just a counselling, dear!

45
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,076
Then, you carry on, doctor!
l'm ready.

46
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,812
We shall talk about love then!

47
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,441
Have you fallen in love, doctor?

48
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,983
l had such feelings towards a few,
but nothing worked out.

49
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,989
So you bought the ticket
but not watched the show, right?

50
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,498
As l've no experience, l ask you.

51
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,767
What's the actual feel of it?

52
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,764
Leaving your parents who raised you
with love and care for about 20 years,

53
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,405
for the sake of an intense love
that too with a stranger...

54
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,176
l don't understand why is that...

55
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,972
The average lifespan of a human
is around 60 years, right?

56
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,879
So, this same stranger whom you said has to
live with us, till our death, for about 35 yrs.

57
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:13,218
-So, in that aspect l took a decision,
why they needlessly get tensed? - Right!

58
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,488
And if l could actually describe its feel..

59
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,387
then you would've discovered a
drug for that long back!

60
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,862
Have you read Romeo and Juliet?

61
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,334
Khalil Gibran's ''Broken Wings''?

62
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,866
Salman ikka's Pranayam?

63
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,334
-You have not read, is it? - No.

64
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,038
She reads lots of books, right?

65
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,601
Yes, her main hobbies are books and movies!

66
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,503
One of the books she'd read or a
cinema she'd watched...

67
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,244
...a passionate love story..

68
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:14,245
That story orthe characters in that story
must have obsessed deeply in her mind.

69
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,320
Well said! Tell them, Doctor.

70
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,217
l keep warning them from the beginning.

71
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:19,983
What?

72
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,456
lt's exactly a story! A fantastic story!

73
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,255
But it's not from any cinema or novel!

74
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,260
-But a true biography! - Pappettan....

75
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,090
Let me explain.

76
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,994
She has got an uncle! A Vagabond!

77
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,194
Her younger brother had a
reputed job in the Navy.

78
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,134
Loved a North lndian girl!

79
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,502
His brother-in-law was just 25 yrs old then!

80
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,470
That girl walked out on him!

81
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:45,242
But this fellow... since last many years,
keeps wandering with pangs of sorrow!

82
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,913
A national voyage!

83
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,321
His story is really an Epic Mahabharatham!
He's the real Valmiki (saint)!

84
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,891
Wow! A real love story
which is so inspiring...!

85
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:57,993
Where is he now?

86
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:03,330
After traversing through all the soil in lndia,
he's landing into Lakshadweep now.

87
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:29,455

Excuse me! Have you learnt music?

119
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,351
No! Did you feel so?

120
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,881
No...that's why l asked.

121
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,244
Get down carefully.....

122
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:53,955
Come on, jump, sir!

123
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,185
What a trouble!
Won't this ship anchor atjetty?

124
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,490
Leaving us stranded in the middle of the
sea after taking huge money?

125
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,395
You climb down...l will hold you.

How much!

130
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,402
That means  kilometer

131
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:14,942
Climb down, sir.

132
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:17,915
Good Lord, hold him!

133
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:19,643
Don't push me..Okay?

134
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,650
Sit there...

135
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:25,890
Come on, move fast.

136
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,394
Untie the rope

137
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,530
Doctor, Muthukoya said you will be
returning only next week.

138
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,969
He was right! As the marriage got over,
l left immediately.

139
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,412
-Whose marriage, Doctor?-My dad's!

140

Hello! Only those who have got
Lakshadweep administration's permit

Hey, come here. Permit....show it there.

143
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:49,873
Just a minute, please.

144

149
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,624
Trying to fool police!

150
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:13,989
Search completely.

151
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:14,728
What happened, Jamal?

152
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,696
He is a Navy man!

153
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,836
Oh God! That was my old lD card!

154
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,834
-Sir, seeing my lD...
- Don't utter a word

155
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,100
Search his bag.

156
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:23,973
ls he actor Suresh Gopi!

157
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,502
lsn't this a part of lndia?
Police nabbing a navy man!

158
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,644
-Sir, there are many CDs in this!
-What are they?

159
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,712
These are a few episodes
of the reality show l participated!

160
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,112
Reality show?! Fantastic!

161
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,584
-Search completely!

162
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,553
Aren't you Shantanu, sir?

163
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:45,987
Leave him..

164
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,990
He has come here on
deputation for sports!

165
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,698
-New diving instructor!
- Diving lnstructor?

166
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:52,800
Yes, sir.

167
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,063
-Sorry -lt's okay.

168
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,532
This is a Ship's permit!

169
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,674
Ship permit?!

170
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,709
-l'm Sports secretary Attukoya!
- Hello!

171
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,416
Who authorized a Ship Welfare Officer
to issue a permit?

172
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,114
Search his bag!

173
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,412
Hey, don't leave him....
Catch him.

174
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:13,948
Sir..

175
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:18,993
Catch him..l say catch him.

176
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,977
No matter if your uniform gets wet!
Catch him..

177
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,102
Which idiot jumped?

178
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:07,843
Move aside.

179
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:26,197
Team DrC

180
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,444
Pull him.

181
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,709
Give your hand.

182
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,851
Anyway, thank you, sir!

183
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,720
This was a security exercise!
l mean mock drill!

184
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,064
Oh! As you were holding Navy's lD card,
l doubted you.

185
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,702
That was my old lD card!

186
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,865
lt's almost 11 yrs after being
discharged from the Navy!

187
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,971
-Welcome to Kavaratti!
- Thank you.

188
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:22,844
Let's move, sir!

189
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:28,126
-My shoes..-Thank you.

190
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,561
lt happens twice a year!
This security exercise is called as Gemini!

191
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,130
24 hours of programme!

192
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,593
Terrorists role is given to
Navy people or Coast guards!

193
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,701
They have to plant the dummy bombs in the
already decided spots within the stipulated
time,

194
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,135
and the Police will
prevent them from planting it.

195
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,203
One whom you had caught
now was a Navy man!

196
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:49,275
Have you arrived early?

197
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,740
- Yes, how was yourjourney?
-Good! Thank you.

198
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,250
Please hold this, sir.

199
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,588
Hello instructor!

200
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,855
You are a multifaceted personality!

201
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:02,790
Likely to get a Bharat award.
What an acting - shivering with fright!!

202
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,693
Whatever skill one may possess,
we ought to fear the sea.

203
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,861
But Doctor doesn't have
any fear of the Sea!!

204
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:13,127
She crossed 90 channel easily through a tiny
fishing boat and reached an island!

205
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,863
She's the Medical Superintendent here!
Dr. Sherin!

206
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:18,866
Come on, sir!

207
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,111
l need to change my wet dress!

208
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,279
Don't worry, we're going to the cottage!

209
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,678
ls it close by?

210
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,143
Here all places are very close by, sir!

211
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,980
The entire area would only take 30 mins in bike!
That's the size of this Kavaratti island!

212
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:32,646
Team DrC

213
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,793
Fasten the banner on top!

214
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,626
Where were you?
ls the work not yet complete?

215
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,164
No....got some more work.

216
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,131
What about the work you'd gone for?

217
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,963
Everything ok!

218
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,693
Please come and get acquainted
with these people.

219
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,628
They are Pushpa's children!

220
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,871
-Pushpa..?
- Pushpa is the name of a club here.

221
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,367
He's Shantanu sir! New Diving instructor!

222
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,575
Sir, did you jump from the ship
and swam across?

223
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,907
Actually, it was a blunder l made .
This Navy..

224
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,017
As soon as he arrived, he laid his head
before Gemini and dived into the sea,

225
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,685
And caught hold of a Navy man!

226
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,284
-He's Hussain!
- Sravu(Shark) Hussain!

227
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,180
Sravu is your dad!

228
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,850
He is working as a Fisheries officer!

229
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,955
He is Mohsin - a Panchayat member!

230
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,961
Moideen, Zakhariah, Akbar...
These guys do fishing and Politics!

231
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:17,892
Please come!

232
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,105
Hejoined on a Deputation for sports.

233
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,207
-How good is his voice?
- Not bad!! Bill up for 1000 Rs!

234
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,141
He's a Programme Director in All lndia Radio.

235
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,280
He raises the invoices in our names
on behalf of the announcers on contract basis.

236
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,276
At last, he himself imitates the
voice and usurps the money.

237
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,752
As if l bought 4 ships
with that usurped money!

238
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:37,345
Hi, l am Rajeev!

239
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,119
Shantanu! People call me Chandu!

240
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,860
Wow! Good voice!

241
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,290
l'll give you work frequently!

242
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,889
l will happily accept it.

243
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,630
Settle him in a room and come back.

244
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,742
Everybody is
Chettuva Shahjahan's fans here, right?

245
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,105
Yesudas is out ,
Chettuva Shahjahan is leading now.

246
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,218
What's your programme today?

247
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,281
l shall also come with you..okay.

248
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,023
Language here is nice to hear!

249
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,863
Language is Malayalam only

250
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,226
But when the inhabitants of the island
converse,
this is the slang!

251
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:27,067
A mix of Tamil, Malayalam and a
little bit of Arabic -called as Jeseri!

252
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,298
People living on shores find it hard
to live here in this island

253
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,405
lf an emergency comes,
they'll be in trouble!

254
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,479
Ship's arrival and departure depends
on the Almighty's schedule!

255
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,941
Why were you interested in coming here?

256
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,176
Believe this also as Almighty's schedule!
What do you say?

257
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,456
''Laksha''dweep (1 lakh lslands)
was falsely named by someone long ago!

258
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,315
Totally there are only 10-30 islands!

259
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,125
And only 10 islands have been inhabited!

260
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,160
But the distance from one island to another
is a ship's travel!

261
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,193
-When Cheraman Perumal converted his
religion..
- Who?

262
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,868
-You've not heard of Cheraman Perumal?
-No.

263
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,806
Erstwhile King of Kerala!

264
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,301
Oh, that Perumal...

265
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,003
Yeah, it's the 1000 yr old story!!

266
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,209
When Perumal converted to lslam
and had gone to Mecca,

267
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,850
Some loyal people in Malabar went
in search of him to bring him back!

268
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,155
After being stranded in the Sea, they
ultimately got landed up in some island here.

269
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,758
This is one of the stories how the
people began inhabit here.

270
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,156
May be due to Perumal's
religion conversion,

271
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,022
-All the inhabitants here are lslamics!
-l see!

272
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,166
What is this girl distributing?

273
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,162
ls it Cinema notice!

274
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:33,428
Cinema?
For Cinema, we've to travel 300 kms...

275
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,430
Upto Kochi!

276
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,936
Here all of us watch cinemas on T.V

277
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,816
This is Sir's cottage.
How is the location?

278
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,549
Breathtaking!

279
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,058
What about yourfamily?

280
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,160
-We're living separately!
- Why? What happened, sir?.

281
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,322
Nothing happened!

282
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,927
Only after marriage,
we can live together, right?

283
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,499
Oh you meant that!
Well, where is she living now? Hometown?

284
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,941
Yes...in some place!

285
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,445
-Have you distributed the notice?
-Yes.

286
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,316
My little sister, Duva!

287
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,284
Shantanu sir! New Diving lnstructor!

288
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,043
Greetings!

289
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:24,789
Wait, l shall also come along.

290
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,285
No...l need to go for tuition,

291
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,192
and give the injection.

292
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,397
Wait for 5 mins,
l'll get him settled and be back.

293
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,063
Nurse?

294
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,231
She was studying for MBBS in
Kozhikode Medical College.

295
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,801
After three years,
she discontinued her studies.

296
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,006
Oh no! Why?

297
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,806
Was forced to discontinue because of illness.

298
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:49,904
Please come, sir!

299
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,628
House looks very unsafe!

300
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,620
Will my things be safe here?

301
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,992
Oh sir! Many things that are
Outside, are not here!

302
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,500
Like robbery, Dog, alcohol,
Snake and Suicide!

303
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:14,336
That's great!

304
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,096
And l've already told you about Cinema!

305
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,064
l'm leaving the bike here...

306
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,106
lt belongs to Sport Council!

307
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,974
Don't l need a helmet?

308
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,043
5 feet wide roads and
maximum speed of 15 kmph!

309
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,578
-No one wears a helmet here, Sir!
-Then ok!

310
00:26:47,806 --> 00:27:02,779
Team DrC

311
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:28,603
SUBJAlL -KAVARATTl

312
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,483
Good morning, doctor!

313
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,183
-Going for sightseeing?!
-Just like that!

314
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,517
Why the jail is left in this condition?

315
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,460
People winded it up.

316
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:48,223
Do the people here create so much trouble?!

317
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,666
Only if anyone creates problem
they can be put inside, right?

318
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,036
No crimes at all.

319
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,438
Right!

320
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,044
Which is the way to Naval base?

321
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,509
Going for a drink, aren't you?

322
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:07,351
When it's military, one can drink
a good stuff with trust!

323
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,214
l see! ln that case,
you'll vacate from here soon!

324
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,080
Why?

325
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,349
The whole of Lakshadweep is a dry land.

326
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,219
You won't even get a drop!

327
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,419
Oh my Gosh! What an adversity!

328
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,588
Whenever l'm back from the hometown,

329
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,228
l carry 2-3 bottles along with me.

330
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,033
Nobody searches my bag.

331
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,036
You're really great, doctor!

332
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,105
For today's quota, l'll give.
But don't make it a habit.

333
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,073
Okay.

334
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,473
So...the day l start to drink
l will surely visit your quarters.

335
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:46,215
l'm fit since my birth!
So l neverfelt like drinking till now.

336
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,055
Doctor, way to the Naval base?

337
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,424
Ask someone and go!

338
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:11,648
What do you want?

339
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,483
-ls Zakhariah there?
-Gone to his hometown!

340
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,778
Will return only after a month.

341
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,512
When did he leave?

342
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,793
Yesterday! lt was some
emergency call from home!

343
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:46,110
Team DrC

344
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,087
My dearfolks and friends, greetings!

345
00:29:51,689 --> 00:30:05,660
Mansoor Jilani and Wahida ties
wedlock on 2015 August 14

346
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:15,270
Thus, l warmly welcome
inhabitants here and outside.

347
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,095
Hello!! Have you finished seeing the island?

348
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,700
Almost! lt's just a few days since l arrived!

349
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,367
When you feel bored, come to the station
and learn recording.

350
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,369
You need to announce, right?

351
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,350
Okay! Anyhow, give me a call.

352
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,546
lt's from hospital.
No further evacuation orders.

353
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,554
My brother had come..
There's no ship for next 4 days.

354
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,456
lf any evacuation order is passed,
l could board him in a Helicopterto Kochi.

355
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,728
ls there any chopper service
when there's no ship?

356
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,229
There is no such service from here.

357
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,368
As there is limited facility
in the hospital here,

358
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,901
ln case if any emergency arises, they
would be referred to the hospital in Kochi.

359
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,503
Unless and until Medical Superintendent
certifies the graveness of illness,

360
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,142
they will not be sent to
Kochi by a helicopter.

361
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,504
ln such a situation, others can pay
and occupy the vacant seats.

362
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,712
Medical Superintendent will not
certify that easily.

363
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,781
After reaching Kochi, if it's found
that illness is not grave,

364
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:28,884
Superintendent will lose his job

365
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,619
And the patient will be slammed with
a penalty of lakhs of rupees!

366
00:31:55,747 --> 00:32:01,379
Nitrogen Narcosis or Rapture of the
deep or the Martini effect!

367
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,882
-You might've heard any one of
these 3 names. -No Sir!

368
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,191
-Didn't you? - No.

369
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,227
Okay, then!
Have any one of you drunk alcohol?

370
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:22,638
Couple of drinks without
anyone's notice at least

371
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,703
Sir, are you searching
someone for a company?

372
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,373
You kids are not enough for my company.

373
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,882
Tell me, has anyone of you?

374
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,646
He had drunk before.

375
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,351
Oh, sir! Only once!

376
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,522
lf it's known,
l'll be thrown out of the house!

377
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,656
No one will know!

378
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,994
Okay, then you tell me, what
do you feel after getting drunk?

379
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,501
Like going on a boat,
when there's a storm!

380
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,997
We will feel weightless
and lose our balance at times!

381
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,400
And become more courageous!

382
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,335
Heard this, guys?

383
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,875
This feel that you get after drinking alcohol,

384
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,378
can be felt by a diver even
without drinking alcohol!

385
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:04,544
When?

386
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,043
while diving in the open sea
at more than 30m depth!

387
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,819
This state is called Nitrogen Narcosis!

388
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,557
-Has anyone of you crossed 30m?
- No, sir.

389
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:20,691
Okay, then we will be crossing 30m today.

390
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,667
-Ready? - Ready, sir.

391
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,534
Replace these four cylinders.

392
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,967
Carbon-monoxide is mixed in it!

393
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,304
Will it be a risk?

394
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,872
lt's poisonous gas!

395
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,704
lf inhaled, one may be alive
for a maximum of 4 hours only!

396
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,676
-Who did this?
- Nobody has done it.

397
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,949
Lubricating oil in the
compressor has leaked out.

398
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,552
When Hydrocarbon gets mixed,
Carbon monoxide is formed!

399
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,519
Good morning, sir!

400
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,892
l'm sorry, l flouted your mission that day.

401
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,062
No, that's okay!

402
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,994
l am Deeraj Nayyar,
Sub-lieutenant!

403
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,731
l'm on shore patrol duty today.

404
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,398
-How do you speak Malayalam?
-l had my training in Kochi.

405
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,405
You hold a record in Deep sea diving, right?

406
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,746
l didn't dive for a record!

407
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,411
Oh, was that a rescue mission then?

408
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,775
l did it for my photo and name to be
published in the newspapers!

409
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:23,984
One of my close friends is
missing for a long time. No contact!

410
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:29,096
After seeing my photo in the paper,
l hoped they would contact me.

411
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,096
Right? l'll see you around, then.

412
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:51,118
Okay, guys! Hold for
3 mins at 10m depth!

413
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,580
l shall join you then!

414
00:34:53,191 --> 00:35:12,738
Team DrC

415
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,980
-Hi Muthumani-Hi Chandu uncle,
Have you met Zakariah?

416
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,150
No, dear! He's gone to his hometown.

417
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,812
l'm intensely searching the friends request
and also searching the name.

418
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,580
But there is no Nadira!

419
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,982
What does your lover say?

420
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,485
He's very much happy!

421
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,389
l got a call. Let me go then.

422
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,998
-To where?
- To the bottom of the sea, bye!

423
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:15,058
Team DrC

424
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,135
Hello...No...then?

425
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:32,248
Hey, Zakhariah!

426
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:37,784
Hey, it's me, dude!

427
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,261
Hey, rascal!

428
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,679
lt's me, Shantanu! Stop the bike.

429
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,846
Dude, lt's me, Shantanu!

430
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,009
Hey, stop!

431
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,212
The one behind is our instructor!

432
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,883
And the one in front is
Zakhariah sir of the light house!

433
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,081
Something wrong!

434
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,254
Ever since he came,
he has been asking for the lighthouse.

435
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,585
Hold this.

436
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:24,954
What do you want?

437
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,220
-Where's Zakhariah?
-He's not here.

438
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,431
-Where did he go?
-l don't know.

439
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,433
-When will he return?
-l don't know.

440
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,229
-What's your name?
-l don't know.

441
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,432
My name is Kunjikoya!

442
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,741
Move aside!

443
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,449
You can't climb up there today.

444
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,114
-Why?-Today is Friday!

445
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,232
l called you several times!

446
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,778
When you knew it was me,
you cut the phone.

447
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,210
Since then, you never attended
my call even once.

448
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:56,012
-ls that why you came here?
- Yes

449
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,184
lf l'd known that you would come here,
then surely l would've attended your call!

450
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,015
So you were hiding from
my sight for these many days!

451
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,895
No! l thought you would go back
after loitering here for two days.

452
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,198
Going back will not be immediate!

453
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:15,398
l've joined here on sports deputation
as Diving lnstructor!

454
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,137
Oh Jesus!

455
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:29,043
l need to gather some more
information from here. You must help me.

456
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,149
What's it?

457
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:39,919
One Nazeeb lmam - Sub Lieutenant
in the Naval base,

458
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:49,766
From his name and age,
l doubt he's Nadira's brother!!

459
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:50,303
lf so?

460
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:57,770
lt's the last chance of finding
more information about her.

461
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,455
lf l go there directly,
he may identify me.

462
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,058
And that will be the end of everything!

463
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,055
l can't take any chance in this!

464
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,995
-So, please...-Shut up, you bloody!

465
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,592
Jump from here and die! Rascal!!

466
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,599
You're almost 40 years
Shameless fellow!

467
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:24,040
Still hanging around aimlessly
for his bloody old love!!

468
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,245
For supporting you in this matter in the past,
my life turned upside down!

469
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,810
That's called FATE, dude!

470
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,208
lt's not FATE but SNOBBlSHNESS
- Merely Snobbishness!

471
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,048
Bloody friend.....and hell with his love!!

472
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,585
Now, l'm not 25 years old.

473
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,582
But l'm still 25!

474
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:44,926
l will give you a whack..

475
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,268
When Captain Zakhariah was
coming home on holidays,

476
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,836
Eagerly waiting for a bottle from his son
's quota....was the Retired officer Varunni ...

477
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,836
...My dad!!

478
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,474
But l went home with my luggage
having lost my job - all because of you!

479
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,473
Since l lost the job, the girl,
who was supposed to marry me,

480
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,074
and her parents whizzed away
after saluting me.

481
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,080
Who's the loser, then? Me only!

482
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,984
Later, l got a job in this lighthouse,

483
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:15,420
and when my hairturned grey
and l almost got fixed to another girl,

484
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,890
But the day before the betrothal,
she eloped with someone else.

485
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,493
-As usual what happened to me?
- You lost again!

486
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,897
ls marriage the biggest thing in life?

487
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:24,964
For me, it's YES!

488
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,164
l shall perform your third marriage, then!

489
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,474
And l'll get as many bottles
as your dad needs!

490
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,202
But you got to help me with this, please.

491
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,106
No, Zakhariah, sir! Leave him!

492
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,047
Rascal!! lt's 10 yrs
since my dad expired.

493
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,014
Leave me...Leave me l say.

494
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,185
Leave him, Koya!
Let him hit me!

495
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,618
Come on, you hit me

496
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:57,857
Team DrC

497
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,194
l have been hearing such jibes
since so many years!

498
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:07,208
lf anyone in the family loved
or eloped with someone,

499
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,241
they will heap the blame upon me finally
saying they are learning from me.

500
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,146
lt was only a PRANK at the age of 25!

501
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:23,626
But l didn't expect this will
haunt me throughout my life.

502
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,635
l've gone crazy after losing my composure!

503
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,331
Let's get some news about it
and then put the shutter..

Salim continued living as Jehangir.

But still the world remember

No...somebody has deliberately switched it off

574
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,127
Switched it off? Hold this!

575
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,631
Which bloody switched it off?

576
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,932
Who the hell switched off while singing?

577
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:19,699
Who the hell switched it off?.

578
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:21,633
l'll give you a smack and disfigure you.

Zakhariah...Jaffar sir!

00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:25,573
What the hell are you doing?

581
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,977
Okay, congratulations...Keep it up.

582
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,051

Stop it and come quickly, you fool!

00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,636
Sub Lieutenant Shantanu! Kochi!

00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:03,544
13 disciplinary violations in the academy.

586
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,749
-And 3 at the base. - Yes, sir.

587
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:13,487
Lieutenant Zakhariah! Son of Varuni!
Chief Navy Officer.

588
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:18,663
Was disciplined, obedient, and
well behaved workmanship ln the academy.

589
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:23,936
And no disciplinary violations
at the base so far!

590
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:31,908
Sub Lieutenant Shantanu!
You sing well and you dance well.

591
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,644
But this is not the place for it.

592
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,512
This is the place of discipline.

593
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:41,115
And you seem more inclined
towards civilian life.

594
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:47,219
lndian Navy is meant
to be a place for MEN OF ARMS

595
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:52,964
So, if l say you're wrong recruit,
l'm sure you will agree.

596
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,831
Sir, l disagree.

597
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,673
Aren't all the arms we
need for hugging each other?

598
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,239
Shut up, you disrespectful rascal!

599
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:02,502
Get out!

600
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,682
And you, Lieutenant Zakhariah!

601
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,916
You will get your 1st red mark
on your record.

602
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,656
Thanks to your friend.
Now get out.

603
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,722
Sir, please..

604
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,223
l said, get out.

605
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:33,868
Are you happy, rascal?

606
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,142
What is my fault for you
creating ruckus on the stage?

607
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,877
Did l say that l want to
sing on the stage?

608
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:39,748
l only told you to sing,
not to woo his daughter!

609
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,078
Manly people will naturally woo!
No point in envying!

610
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,253
Excuse me

611
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:49,515
Rascal!

612
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,025
That's for me!

613
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,089
-You, get lost Rascal!
-What?

614
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,130
lt's for him!

615
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:17,517
Good morning!

616
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,634
lt's a common courtesy.
when one wishes you Good morning,

617
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,303
you have to wish them back!

618
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:43,939
That's...when we talk...
in front of everyone

619
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,273
-Will trigger problems!- Why?

620
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:55,688
There's a talk,
we are in love with each other.

621
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,790
Oh my God! Really?

622
00:54:59,195 --> 00:54:59,752
Really!

623
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,695
Not sure whether your dad knows about it!

624
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,767
But there is no such thing between us!

625
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,275
Nothing....

626
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:18,007
Sorry..l thought..

627
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,982
Jeez! l needlessly..

628
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,016
Doesn't matter...leave it..

629
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:27,848
Sorry.

630
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:35,255

ls kissing such a big offence?

707
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,284
He's trying to threaten us!

708
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:25,784
Not a threat!! He has initiated
for Court martial proceedings...Look..

709
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,621
My name also appears in this list!
What did l do?

710
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,451
Did l interlock your lips?

711
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:33,920
At least you enjoyed the pleasure.

712
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,820
What did l gain? l got into a fix now.

You may read the charge.

Charge against the 1st accused.

You, Shantanu P - Sub lieutenant

ls shejust 15 yrs?

719
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,791
How do you plead,
guilty or not guilty?

720
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:42,660
Sir....that girl....

721
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,495
l didn't know that girl was
just 15 yrs old.

722
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:47,691
Let him speak in English or Hindi.

723
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,063
Not in regional language.

724
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,704
l didn't know she was
just 15 yrs old, sir.

725
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,434
That means he is pleading guilty.

726
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,645
Mr.Prosecutor, please sit down.

727
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:05,278
Mr.Shantanu, your answer
should either be a YES or a NO

728
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:14,728
No, sir!

729
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,062
Okay, let's proceed with the next charge.

730
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,063
Charge against the 2nd accused.

731
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:27,064
Zakhariah K V - Lieutenant signal officer

732
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,937
has abetted and hereby
supported the 1st accused

733
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:33,547
in committing molestation of
Ms.Nadira lmam D/o Jaffar lmam,

734
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:36,718
15 yrs on the 15th of April at 2.p.m.

735
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,725
How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

736
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:44,755
Not guilty, sir.

737
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,692
This case is posted for trial
on the17th of August.

738
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:12,086
Sorry l'm helpless!
No defence can be taken here.

739
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,651
She is just 15 yrs old.

740
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,984
lf she is below 16 yrs and
even if it's with herfull consent.

741
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,086
That's an offence.

742
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:20,825
She doesn't appear like a 15 yr old girl.

743
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,724
Who knows she will be fed
with junk foods to misdirect us.

744
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,400
Well, What have l done to
frame abetting charges against me?

745
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,964
Did l ask you to kiss her?.

746
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:31,733
The allegation against you is
guarding outside the shower room,

747
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,567
preventing others from entering

748
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,741
That girl's dad , the RearAdmiral Jaffar lmam
is the eyewitness.

749
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:38,571
lsn't that enough?

750
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,581
Maximum, what will happen?

751
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,810
lf proven guilty, under moral turpitude,
dismissal is sure.

752
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:50,091
lf the girl's answer is YES to the
question whether she was kissed,

753
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:54,519
Oh my heavens!

754
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,600
Ms.Nadira, Yes or No!

755
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:13,807
Yes or No?

756
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:20,848
Oh Jesus!

757
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:26,827
Yes!

758
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,864
That may be recorded, sir.
l've no more questions.

759
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,734
The guilty against the accused
is proved beyond doubt!

760
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,074
No!

761
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:46,515
What do you mean?

762
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,910
He's not guilty, sir.

763
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,453
We're in love.

764
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,098
l love him.

765
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,167
l really love him.

766
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,951
See, Nadira, it's absolutely irrelevant
whether you love him or not!

767
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:26,919
The issue in question is..

768
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:29,647
Mr.Prosecutor, stop counselling her.

769
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,029
The Court will be in recession for one hour.

770
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:45,562
Team DrC

771
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,140
lf the judgement is pronounced,
you will be terminated from the service.

772
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,516
Sir, but what is my offence?

773
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:02,752
Many heartless people have queued up
to give witness against you!

774
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,122
There is only one option left.

775
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,026
Take voluntary discharge and leave!

776
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:14,166
lf so, you can seek a job
in the coast guard or Sports department.

777
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:18,966
lf it is a termination,

778
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:23,100
Then, criminal proceedings,
Jail...You know all that

779
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,847
Only God can help you

780
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:43,795
l'm ready, sir.

781
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:39,449
Team DrC

782
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:41,947
We don't need any valid reason
to fall in love!

783
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,120
But to feel a deep love,
there should be some valid reason.

784
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,059
What really happened for you
to pine for her?

785
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,133
There is really nothing
in what l'd said so far!

786
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:56,068
But that happened ...only later.

787
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:21,760
Yes, come in.

788
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,909
lt's your childish prank that
has spoiled this man's career and life.

789
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,272
No, uncle...You're wrong.

790
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:44,980
l'm serious about this.

791
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:50,884
l'm serious about him.

792
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,130
Serious? You are only 15!

793
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,800
You're not matured enough
to take a serious decision about this.

794
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,203
That's what the law says.

795
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:06,202
Her age is such that,
she cannot even realize herself!

796
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:07,805
Serious it seems!!

797
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,174
lf we ask her about this after 5 yrs,

798
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:13,381
She herself will start laughing.

799
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,044
Do you think so?

800
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:28,388
Five years!

801
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,993
Okay! After 5 yrs, l'll show you

802
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,462
l'll convince you....

803
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,466
...all of you..

804
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,980
An obstinate challenge of a 15 yr old girl

805
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,190
l only thought that much.

806
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:01,453
But unexpected hopes were
lying somewhere else.

807
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:16,467
Then?

808
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:23,150
Did she respond to you after five years?

809
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,448
Yes!

810
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:27,487
How?

811
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:34,392
She erupted like... a bomb blast!

812
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,228
Muthaapi is serious.

813
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:42,026
He is being evacuated
through the helicopter!

814
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,239
Poorfellow! He has been
bedridden for long.

815
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:45,462
Pray to God!

816
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:47,575
You continue

817
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:49,209
What is it?

818
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:50,878
Bro! Duva is also going along with him.

819
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,944
Duva! What a deceit!

820
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:54,614
Move...Let's rush..
We must not let her go.

821
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,050
She will go definitely this time

822
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:57,214
What's the problem, Koya?

823
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,319
All such problems are
triggered by people like you!!

824
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:03,224
-What's it? -You take the bike!

825
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:12,460
Duva, Koya's sister is
exactly yourfemale version!

826
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,163
She fell in love with a guy
in Medical College.

827
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,371
Knowing about that, Koya
didn't send her back afterthe vacation.

828
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:19,641
2 years have passed.

829
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,236
She boarded the ship couple
of times after evading from Koya's sight.

830
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:26,213
Some rascals like him, will inform Koya,

831
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:27,415
and he will bring her back.

832
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,480
Why? lsn't that guy a Muslim?

833
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,210
That's not the issue here.

834
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,181
lf she goes, Attakoya will be left alone.

835
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:35,489
lf it's a guy from this island....

836
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,082
That is Koya's tension.

837
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,585
How can she forsake her love?

838
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:41,588
Oh! Sailing in the same boat?!

839
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:46,160
Shall l go fast and stop Koya from going?

840
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,428
l'll kick you to pulp, damn it!

841
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,433
Do you want to intervene and
get me beaten up by people?

842
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,637
lf she is destined then she will go

843
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:54,005
-Poor thing !-Who?

844
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,106
You only.

845
01:16:59,281 --> 01:16:59,940
Please move.

846
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:04,350
See you then.

847
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:13,483
May the Lord protect him!

848
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:42,920
Why the hell is it not flying!

849
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:46,090
You did a good thing, doctor!

850
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:51,221
Uniting lovers....whether in a story or real life.
Everybody likes it!

851
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:55,536
Ask him to fly soon before that fellow arrives.

852
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:07,407
Hello, why the delay? Can't you fly?

853
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,174
A Navy staff is also going to Kochi!!
He'll be coming now.

854
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,587
See, this is an air ambulance.
l'm the Medical Superintendent.

855
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:13,955
And l certified the evacuation.

856
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,019
Patient can't wait for any Navy people

857
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,488
Don't worry, ma'am.
lt's only a matter of 5 mins.

858
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:21,052
-We'll make it up in plan..
- How dare you say..

859
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,598
Who the hell is coming now?

860
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:29,232
Doctor, l can feel the spark of a love
affair behind you in this!

861
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,768
Yes of course! Who doesn't have?

862
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,108
Don't worry, l will come.

863
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:36,403
Move aside....

864
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:43,413
Bro...there, she's!.

865
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:49,347
-Dear Duva!-Oh Jesus

866
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,063
Please come back, dear!

867
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:03,265
Come back l say! lt'll not work out!

868
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,238
Please come back.

869
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:10,110
l will not be alive if you go.

870
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:12,241
Why do you talk like this, brother?

871
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,448
Come back.

872
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:16,347
Come back, dear.

873
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,267
Come, let's go

874
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,501
Saeed, you go and assist!

875
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:45,810
Doctor, do l have to take any medicines?

876
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:49,681
Yes! This medicine is for you.

877
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:51,041
Give way.

878
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,448
Doctor is really smart.

879
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,385
-She is not like what you see!
-Much more than this??

880
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:05,694
-Who's that? - Navy man! Deeraj!

881
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:11,370
l'm getting close to him
to find the whereabouts about Nazeeb!

882
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:14,307
That guy was gathering details
about you from Attakoya!

883
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:15,510
-Really?
- Hmm

884
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:34,519
Team DrC

885
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,271
What's the name of that
Navy man in the passenger list?

886
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:30,615
NAZEEB lMAM

887
01:21:56,044 --> 01:22:20,028
Team DrC

888
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:29,671
That was my last and final chance
to find some information about her!

889
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:31,506
That hope is also shattered!

890
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:35,279
The very person from whose sight
l wanted to hide...

891
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:38,383
There l jumped straight onto him
on the very 1st day!

892
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:40,487
He came to know the facts and...

893
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:41,915
fled from here!

894
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,917
How can you be so sure
that he's Nadira's brother?.

895
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:45,259
Don't moan needlessly!

896
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,361
Then, why did he lie to me
that his name was Deeraj?

897
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:50,828
...and why did he collect
my details from Attakoya?

898
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:51,822
That must be of..

899
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,629
That boy went on 10 days leave

900
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:55,927
He didn't quit the job and go!

901
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,932
But one thing is confirmed.
His dad's name is Jaffar lmam.

902
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:06,812
So, you can relax for 10 days until his return!

903
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:11,809
Forthe time being...
didn't you say that she put a bomb after 5 yrs?

904
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,014
Tell us about that incident.

905
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:20,825
He again started!

906
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:25,792
Five years must've passed!

907
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:29,932
lt was when l was working
in Alapuzha sports division,

908
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:31,932
did that bomb explode!

909
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:35,667
Who is that? Joseph?

910
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:50,080
Who are you?

911
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:53,657
Leave me.

912
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:57,431
Lock him up!

913
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,739
Ahmed Kutty! DYSP of Police!

914
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:10,736
Sir, You are a Policeman?

915
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,580
Sorry! You didn't appear so! Leave me..

916
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:17,812
No need of a gun! l'm not a troublesome guy.

917
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:20,116
Where is Nadira?

918
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:22,816
Who?

919
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,113
Nadira lmam!

920
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:34,593
Answer me.

921
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:56,956
Dad, l'm no more 15 year old girl.

922
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:00,594
You can't punish Shanthanu for this,

923
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:02,758
that l love him,

924
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:05,394
or that he loves me!

925
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:08,124
l'm going away with Shantanu.

926
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,598
Don't even try to bring me back.

927
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:25,381
Officer!

928
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,753
Nadira, where are you?

929
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:36,561
ls Shantanu there or not?

930
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:38,397
First tell me, where you are?

931
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,126
Give the phone to Shantanu.

932
01:25:41,870 --> 01:26:00,051
Team DrC

933
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:05,957
Did they hurt you?

934
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:07,654
No!

935
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:10,687
lt was very difficult to find you,

936
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,523
but, not for my dad!

937
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,764
So, l had to choose this route!

938
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,137
lt's okay

939
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,707
l'm sure he would've made you
listen to a CD.

940
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:21,675
Yes!

941
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,568
Even after 5 years,

942
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:25,702
without changing a word,

943
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:29,972
whatever l wish to say, is recorded on that CD.

944
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:34,546
But the condition of your heart is also like
mine,

945
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:37,953
l'll wait for you.

946
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,553
Should l or not?

947
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:44,123
You should!

948
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:45,557
Stop it, Nadira!

949
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,965
Dad, l haven't gone missing

950
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:53,462
l went to visit Ajmer Sheriff
and am back home now.

951
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:03,549
l'm so sorry.

952
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:06,551
He showed us only the

954
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:23,263
''The sky reclines, the shore swings,''

955
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:32,639
''The time hums, the star listens.''

956
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:42,006
''Like waves, she spun in me,
a net of dream''

957
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:46,117
''At this time when eyes close''

958
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:50,787
''And the darkness flows''

959
01:28:51,626 --> 01:29:00,000
''Will the mirage of dark cloud
disappear or change?''

960
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:10,000
''The sky reclines, the shore swings,''

961
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:19,017
''The time hums, the star listens.''

962
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:49,408
You?

963
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:56,216
Are you here to take Nadira away?

964
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:00,457
ln the last 6 years,
not even once l have come to your house, Sir!

965
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:06,765
She troubled even you forthis
and after taking so much pain, she found me!

966
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:11,438
So, isn't it my responsibility to come here?!

967
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:15,738
After all, are we all not men of honour, sir?

968
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:18,445
Oh! So that's your answer!

969
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:25,111
You can't go with him without my permission

970
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:28,153
You can go,

971
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,317
...but after my death!.

972
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:47,998
Your word ''l WlLL WAlT''
is what made me come here!

973
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:14,998
l told you, right? ...
if you want to go, then go after my death!

974
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:19,165
lf you really want to go urgently now,

975
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:23,207
then, l'm ready to die before my time.

976
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:31,918
No, dad! l'll not go without your permission!

977
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:34,921
Even after your death!

978
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:38,423
lt's my promise to you!

979
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:53,768
l will wait for your permission.

980
01:31:56,077 --> 01:32:00,411
But, till then, you shouldn't
question my wait!

981
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:04,415
The number of days Nadira will wait for you,

982
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:08,048
hatred for you will increase equivalently

983
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,555
Some day your idea will change, sir.

984
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,030
The day you understand who l am!

985
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:30,234
Team DrC

986
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:37,209
l'm sorry.

987
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:40,277
l can't do anything more than this for now.

988
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:42,484
lt's a question of Royal blood!

989
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,213
Will take time, right?

990
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:46,820
l can understand.

991
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:49,428
One fine day father will accept.

992
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:52,293
But l don't know when that day will come!...

993
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:58,437
l don't have any right
to force you to wait till then.

994
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:06,909
But yes...l'll surely wait.

995
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:18,650
Me too!

996
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:07,234
This is not called WAlTlNG
but WAlT FOREVER!

997
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:13,039
You are aiming for an impossible thing!

998
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:16,345
Her dad is mad.

999
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:18,207
and his daughter is even more mad than him!

1000
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:20,910
Trying to put your life amidst that as fixed
deposit

1001
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:21,516
You are totally mad!

1002
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:24,456
You're a moron! What else can l call you!

1003
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,018
Suppose during sleep, that Hamam....

1004
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:28,956
lmam, right?

1005
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:33,029
Yes, lmam! Suppose he
dies of heart attack during sleep

1006
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:34,029
Then your condition will be like...

1007
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:35,528
What's that flower called...

1008
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:36,934
Anthurium?

1009
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:38,705
Exactly! Anthurium! That will be your condition.

1010
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:43,334
or assume that old man
agrees on the verge of his death,

1011
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:48,672
What's the point? Even
she will turn grey like you.

1012
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:53,251
Do people love only for that reason?

1013
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:55,045
No, to kneel down and worship.

1014
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:58,315
According to my knowledge,
there is only one meaning for UNlTlNG

1015
01:34:58,492 --> 01:35:00,392
l'm not sure whether it has
other meaning in Hindi.

1016
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:03,063
-Assume there's! - Yes.

1017
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:05,761
Didn't she put any other bomb?

1018
01:35:07,501 --> 01:35:09,401
To put bombs, is she a native of Kannur?

1019
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:14,074
l didn't mean that.
Didn't she try to contact you afterthat?

1020
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:16,768
She was contacting me
over the phone for three years.

1021
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:22,447
l'd also been to Lucknow
couple of times to meet her.

1022
01:35:23,284 --> 01:35:26,515
She was studying in the
Sufi center overthere.

1023
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:43,334
Team DrC

1024
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:02,255
Quite often, she sends CDs to me.

1025
01:36:03,624 --> 01:36:06,354
Few Sufi songs in her own voice,

1026
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:15,260
and some love quotes in Sufism
which makes me crazy!

1027
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:26,241
''When a heart burns a heart,
when heart is in love, God is merciful...''

1028
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:36,379
''One who sacrifices life for love...
one who stakes life wins love...''

1029
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:43,057
But in the CD that came at last,

1030
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:46,327
lt was not her voice.

1031
01:36:52,573 --> 01:36:54,541
l'm Jaffer lmam here.

1032
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:59,674
lf you hadn't interfered in
Nadira's life from distance,

1033
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:05,511
yourfake love would fly away
like dust in a gust of wind.

1034
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:08,814
That's why you seek reasons
to keep herthinking about you.

1035
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:14,884
That Nadira keeps remembering you.

1036
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:19,889
Hereafter you'll never
listen Nadira's voice.

1037
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:23,836
You'll die...waiting for her.

1038
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:25,667
What does it mean?

1039
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:31,900
lt's 2 years on.....there is no contact.

1040
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:35,245
Her mobile phone is switched off.

1041
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:38,612
l enquired all possible ways.

1042
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:42,252
And only came to know
they have shifted from Lucknow.

1043
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:45,883
At such a dead end situation,

1044
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:50,727
l did an adventurous thing!

1045
01:37:51,298 --> 01:38:05,770
Team DrC

1046
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:08,708
l broke the record in the Deep sea free diving!

1047
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:12,582
Risking my life and limb!

1048
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:17,823
lf this becomes a news,
l thought she might contact me.

1049
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:25,463
lt became news but nothing happened.

1050
01:38:25,966 --> 01:38:27,934
As he said that you'll not hear
her voice any longer,

1051
01:38:28,602 --> 01:38:30,502
Would that ruthless fellow
have harmed her?

1052
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:36,932
That Nazeeb was my last and
final chance of finding her.

1053
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,413
Would she have got married?

1054
01:38:42,249 --> 01:38:43,477
Forthat, she has to die!

1055
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:48,915
-Or if she had died...-Shut up, you!

1056
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:55,928
That's why l say l'll shutter
after knowing the facts!

1057
01:38:57,464 --> 01:38:58,362
What all these

1058
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:06,667
-Nothing... l just thought... - Leave it..

1059
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:11,476
lt's just a matter of 10 days

1060
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:12,508
Let that boy return!

1061
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:14,504
l'll somehow make him disclose the truth.

1062
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,280
Greetings!! We've a sad news.

1063
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:28,922
Muthukoya, 73 yrs old,
died at Medical Trust, Kochi!

1064
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:36,426
His funeral will be held tomorrow
10 am at Mattanchery Juma Masjid

1065
01:39:42,576 --> 01:39:45,807
Won't his body be brought back here?

1066
01:39:47,548 --> 01:39:49,448
That's the fate of the
inhabitants of this island

1067
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:52,717
lf someone dies outside the island,
burial also will be done there itself.

1068
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:55,422
There is no way to bring back the body,

1069
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:59,926
and the relatives can never see the body.

1070
01:40:03,597 --> 01:40:04,256
See you, then.

1071
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:09,866
Are you coming with me or going to quarters

1072
01:40:10,971 --> 01:40:11,494
l'll drop you.

be conducted at Panchayat stage tonight at 7
p.m.

- l need to collect a parcel. - Get it!

1102
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,778
Would the music fest begins on time?

1103
01:45:28,188 --> 01:45:28,779
Why? Do l've to delay it?

-l shall settle him up and come back - Okay.

1107
01:45:38,031 --> 01:45:41,159
Take him away from the junction and hit him

1108
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:42,259
lf people come to know...

1109
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:44,333
Whatever may be, it's the case of LOVE!!

1110
01:45:45,038 --> 01:45:46,369
Hitting whom?

1111
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:50,767
You only said you will hit Nazeeb
to disclose the truth.

1112
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:53,007
Better go and look out for Shahjahan!

1113
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:54,779
This is the problem with the
people living outside!

1114
01:45:55,148 --> 01:45:57,013
Only knows to brag but do nothing!

1115
01:45:58,051 --> 01:45:59,018
Don't prompt me to say..

1116
01:45:59,786 --> 01:46:00,718
lt's Shahjahan, sir!

1117
01:46:01,154 --> 01:46:03,884
Sir, We're waiting in the Jetty.

1118
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:04,986
What happened?

1119
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:09,719
Why needlessly shoot up your BP?

1120
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:10,988
Can't l shoot up my BP?

1121
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:13,996
-Let me go to Jetty - Yes, you move.

1122
01:46:14,234 --> 01:46:14,996
What for?

1123
01:46:15,669 --> 01:46:16,795
We just want to know whether
he's back or not!

1124
01:46:17,304 --> 01:46:18,999
Do you have any objection
if he knows it first?

1125
01:46:19,239 --> 01:46:19,728
You go.

1126
01:46:21,074 --> 01:46:29,880
Team DrC

1127
01:46:32,018 --> 01:46:33,417
He is not in this boat! l checked.

1128
01:46:37,023 --> 01:46:40,720
Hello...No...Next boat has come.
Let me check.

1129
01:46:53,373 --> 01:46:54,340
Here comes Shahjahan sir!!

1130
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:58,171
Give way....Give way, please.

1131
01:46:58,512 --> 01:47:00,377
Greetings

1132
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:03,282
Hold this! Greetings!

1133
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:07,884
Hello Koya!

1134
01:47:19,032 --> 01:47:20,727
-S.l Jamal-Greetings!

1135
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:27,734
Stand aside.

1136
01:47:29,242 --> 01:47:31,710
People are so excited

1137
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:33,812
lt's the same wherever l go!

1138
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:53,331
Greetings!

1139
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:58,330
l understood! From his scorn l made out,
that he's an outsider!

1140
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:03,770
He's not in this boat also.

1141
01:48:06,046 --> 01:48:08,207
Shucks! Only one more boat is left.

1142
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:16,752
Won't he come..

1143
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:25,021
lf there's something that he's scared
to tell me, then he won't come!

1144
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:43,575
So that is also confirmed!

1145
01:48:47,053 --> 01:48:48,179
What happened? Did he come?

1146
01:48:51,258 --> 01:48:52,020
What happened?

1147
01:48:53,059 --> 01:48:56,028
Nothing happened, Koya. He didn't come.

1148
01:48:57,063 --> 01:48:59,429
He didn't go to come back!

1149
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:03,435
Shucks! l needlessly disturbed all of you..

1150
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:08,231
Forget it, dude! See you, then.

1151
01:50:46,406 --> 01:50:47,498
Have you cooled down?

1152
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:54,647
Were you weeping in the Sea?

1153
01:50:55,248 --> 01:50:56,237
Shut up!

1154
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:57,640
l'll give you a whack..

1155
01:51:00,086 --> 01:51:02,486
You unnecessary waste your time for a mere
word

1156
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:03,681
lt's zero now.

1157
01:51:05,225 --> 01:51:06,556
Not only in love...in anything

1158
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,518
No man should be 100 %% honest!

1159
01:51:09,062 --> 01:51:11,030
That's why the world exists like this!

1160
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:11,526
Got it!!

1161
01:51:12,565 --> 01:51:15,033
My life wouldn't have been
given that importance.

1162
01:51:16,403 --> 01:51:18,030
Forget it! lt's over!

1163
01:51:22,542 --> 01:51:23,566
What's the use of waiting?

1164
01:51:24,277 --> 01:51:25,175
What's the use of going?

1165
01:51:28,548 --> 01:51:31,039
Anyhow l'm not Ramanan to commit suicide!

1166
01:51:32,085 --> 01:51:34,952
l want to live somehow for the sake of life

1167
01:51:36,222 --> 01:51:37,211
Don't waste time

1168
01:51:38,258 --> 01:51:40,453
There's a good idea for passing our time!

1169
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:41,524
-Did you get it? - Yes

1170
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:45,263
Alcohol is the best medicine
for the disturbed mind

1171
01:51:46,099 --> 01:51:47,066
Today is the right day to begin.

1172
01:51:47,434 --> 01:51:50,403
Why don't you take a couple of drinks?
You must. Come.

1173
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:52,696
You're already drenched!

1174
01:51:52,906 --> 01:51:54,100
When you're drenched, and take drinks,

1175
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:15,923
Team DrC

1176
01:52:35,215 --> 01:52:36,546
Aaoruthi Avaloruthi song, please

1177
01:52:41,454 --> 01:52:43,256
Will you be able to sing this song?

1178
01:52:43,256 --> 01:52:43,823
What?

1179
01:52:43,823 --> 01:52:47,589
-You sing well, don't you?
-No...no..it will not look nice!

1180
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:53,900
Dear Music-lovers of this island, the moment
for which you were eagerly waiting has come..

1181
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:58,599
The song... Aa Oruthi Avaloruthi
- will be sung ...

1182
01:52:58,972 --> 01:53:02,430
...by Chettuva Shahjahan Sahib now.

1183
01:53:08,114 --> 01:53:09,843
My dear music lovers!

1184
01:53:10,817 --> 01:53:18,553
Just like you all, this is my most
favourite song Aaoruthi Avaloruthi..

1185
01:53:18,758 --> 01:53:19,747
My first song!

1186
01:53:22,195 --> 01:53:24,857
Actually, l didn't write the
lyrics of this song,

1187
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:32,466
but it came flowing into me!
Same is the case with its tune!

1188
01:53:33,406 --> 01:53:41,575
l've a new singer on the stage to sing
along with me.

1189
01:53:41,815 --> 01:53:45,012
But quite a familiar face for you people.

1190
01:53:46,219 --> 01:53:55,855
l warmly welcome Duva Mian Koya
to this musical stage.

1191
01:54:05,305 --> 01:54:06,704
You have to sing along with the Orchestra.

1192
01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:09,868
Doctor's prank l suppose!!

1193
01:54:10,210 --> 01:54:11,575
Does she sing?

1194
01:54:11,811 --> 01:54:13,039
Let's see how she sings

1195

1196
01:54:28,494 --> 01:54:34,262
''That girl, with the smell of milk''

1197

''That girl, with the smell of milk''

1198
01:54:39,672 --> 01:54:45,542
''When that girl left me,
all the leaves which fell were faded ones''

1199
01:54:45,645 --> 01:54:51,174
''By weeping, all my dreams
were dark as black clouds''

1200

there were colourful lotuses''

1204
01:55:19,812 --> 01:55:25,182
''This night is not a night
This breeze's hum is not a hum''

1205
01:55:25,318 --> 01:55:28,288
''This wave is not one which lashed now''

1206

''She's not there in any of these''

1207

One day when shyness left us''

''You scratched this way and that way''

1212

''Do you remember?''

1213
01:56:28,548 --> 01:56:31,073
''Try to remember''

''When the youthful age passes,
will this be over?''

1217

-You really rocked! - Really?

1231
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:08,977
-Your song was splendid!
- Thank you.

1232
01:58:09,215 --> 01:58:10,583
-Really?-Rocking

1233
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:12,312
What's your problem?

1234
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:17,723
l've many problems! What did you intend?

1235
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:19,485
Don't prompt me to intend more.

1236
01:58:22,228 --> 01:58:23,525
Please go, brother.

1237
01:58:23,696 --> 01:58:26,028
-Don't insult her!
-You be quiet, Jamal

1238
01:58:26,632 --> 01:58:28,361
l'll decide what l have to do!

1239
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:31,028
You just mind your business, doctor!
Don't act smart!

1240
01:58:31,571 --> 01:58:34,140
l know you are not behind
all those cheers and fuss!

1241
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:35,107
l'm not a fool.

1242
01:58:35,575 --> 01:58:37,440
Leave it Koya, Don't mess up things

1243
01:58:37,777 --> 01:58:41,235
Certainly! lt was the support of
people who are aware of her likings!!

1244
01:58:41,314 --> 01:58:43,111
ls it you who's deciding about her
likes and dislikes?

1245
01:58:43,182 --> 01:58:44,444
Let's move, sister! Come..

1246
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:46,950
Leave it, Koya! Why creating a
ruckus for a silly thing?

1247
01:58:47,086 --> 01:58:49,577
First, learn about LOVE and AFFECTlON!

1248
01:58:50,423 --> 01:58:53,119
lf he doesn't know,
somebody teach him please.

1249
01:58:53,326 --> 01:58:56,124
Just a minute...Only for a minute, please.

1250
01:58:56,696 --> 01:58:57,720
Then go and mess up!

1251
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:01,556
Actually, who are you?

1252
01:59:01,868 --> 01:59:05,167
Doctor or a Teacher, to preach about LOVE?

1253
01:59:05,404 --> 01:59:08,840
Going on and on about affection
and love for a long time!

1254
01:59:09,142 --> 01:59:10,939
What bullshit is that!

1255
01:59:11,144 --> 01:59:12,975
By the by, who the hell are you
to lecture about this?

1256
01:59:13,045 --> 01:59:15,013
Were you a master in 16008 LOVES?

1257
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:17,680
Hey, mind your words!

1258
01:59:18,351 --> 01:59:20,342
Don't dare point your finger and talk!
Mind you!

1259
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:21,787
What's the problem here?

1260
01:59:22,255 --> 01:59:23,688
Nothing, we're learning about LOVE!

1261
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:25,221
You go and compose your next song.

1262
01:59:29,228 --> 01:59:36,100
The LOVE you mean is trampling over
someone's life for an act in a left out moment!

1263
01:59:37,303 --> 01:59:38,463
lt's only 2 years since she has been in love!

1264
01:59:39,205 --> 01:59:42,008
l know those being in the
waiting room for 10-14 yrs,

1265
01:59:42,008 --> 01:59:45,000
and at last become insane realising that
their life has gone up in smoke.

1266
01:59:46,279 --> 01:59:49,180
By then life almost gets vaporized!

1267
01:59:49,282 --> 01:59:50,510
-Water vapour...-Yes Water vapour!

1268
01:59:52,084 --> 01:59:54,678
Let me ask you something!

1269
01:59:55,288 --> 01:59:59,088
Do you think your life will go waste
if you don't succeed in your love?

1270
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:01,490
ls there a huge scarcity
for men and women here?

1271
02:00:02,361 --> 02:00:05,330
-ls it? - That's enough!

1272
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:10,733
lf you again harp on this topic...

1273
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:13,703
Zakhariah, she doesn't know my nature.

1274
02:00:14,607 --> 02:00:18,634
-Shoe....My shoe!
-What shoo on this issue? Come!

1275
02:00:19,111 --> 02:00:21,807
-Did l talk less?
-Not at all!

1276
02:00:21,914 --> 02:00:24,712
Only you and Duva are the right ones
to talk about love!

1277
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:36,322
Yeah! So you recognized me!!

1278
02:00:38,497 --> 02:00:39,521
l heard your speech as well.

1279
02:00:41,701 --> 02:00:47,333
So, only that much, is it? Okay!

1280
02:00:53,879 --> 02:01:02,344
Team DrC

1281
02:01:23,909 --> 02:01:25,877
We told him about
your yesterday's depression.

1282
02:01:51,637 --> 02:01:52,535
Dad!

1283
02:01:56,275 --> 02:02:02,305
lt's not about a Nawabian hangover
for giving value to one's words!!

1284
02:02:03,749 --> 02:02:06,877
But Cunning! Cent percent Cunning!!

1285
02:02:39,785 --> 02:02:40,683
With Love Nadira!

1286
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,227
What's this?

1287
02:02:51,564 --> 02:02:55,728
Nadira when you said you will wait,

1288
02:02:56,135 --> 02:02:57,534
l did not have a worry with that,

1289
02:02:58,471 --> 02:03:04,899
l knew with time your love will
evaporate in thin air,

1290
02:03:06,178 --> 02:03:08,669
and he knows this as well!

1291
02:03:09,982 --> 02:03:13,008
That's the reason why he has
started sending Dvds.

1292
02:03:13,652 --> 02:03:15,017
That is what you think father!

1293
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:18,324
Even if we meet or not,

1294
02:03:18,324 --> 02:03:20,724
whether we hear each
other's voice or not....

1295
02:03:21,694 --> 02:03:24,254
our love will always live forever.

1296
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:28,601
l don't trust that! Do you believe in it?

1297
02:03:28,601 --> 02:03:29,431
Beyond the limit!

1298
02:03:30,136 --> 02:03:31,296
Do it and show

1299
02:03:57,763 --> 02:03:58,730
What else do you need?

1300
02:04:00,166 --> 02:04:01,793
Just one more thing.

1301
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:15,179
l'm Jaffar lmam speaking!

1302
02:04:33,766 --> 02:04:36,633
Give this to him on my behalf.

1303
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:57,213
l've not asked you this so far!

1304
02:04:57,823 --> 02:04:59,757
Dad, l never asked you
why are you so much against us,

1305
02:05:01,093 --> 02:05:02,685
just because he's a Hindu?

1306
02:05:02,895 --> 02:05:03,554
You're wrong.

1307
02:05:04,797 --> 02:05:08,028
On my Naval base, my junior officer,

1308
02:05:08,667 --> 02:05:12,159
do such a thing with my
15 year old daughter?

1309
02:05:12,771 --> 02:05:14,204
l will never forgive that.

1310
02:05:14,773 --> 02:05:18,766
When you got married,
even mom wasjust 15 years old.

1311
02:05:19,812 --> 02:05:23,270
Did you wait to kiss hertill
she became 18 years?

1312
02:05:23,382 --> 02:05:24,007
Stop this nonsense!

1313
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:27,618
That was in old times!

1314
02:05:29,955 --> 02:05:31,320
Pack your suitcase!

1315
02:05:32,224 --> 02:05:33,782
We are leaving tomorrow.

1316
02:05:55,147 --> 02:05:56,136
Why did you call a taxi?

1317
02:05:56,749 --> 02:05:58,617
l would have dropped you at the airport.

1318
02:05:58,617 --> 02:06:00,380
-No...l..- l called the Taxi

1319
02:06:03,956 --> 02:06:05,423
You don't need to worry!

1320
02:06:06,625 --> 02:06:08,217
l'm not going to Kerala,
l am going to Ajmer!

1321
02:06:09,795 --> 02:06:12,161
l have got a teacher's job in
Sufi center!

1322
02:06:12,665 --> 02:06:13,290
What do you mean?

1323
02:06:14,133 --> 02:06:17,364
if your decision changes, you
can come and meet me.

1324
02:06:18,504 --> 02:06:19,095
Sister!

1325
02:06:20,573 --> 02:06:22,063
The same applies to you as well!

1326
02:06:31,483 --> 02:06:34,077
When l saw you and learnt about you,

1327
02:06:36,455 --> 02:06:38,855
l immediately rushed to see my dad.

1328
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:43,322
Before l make any decision
l thought l would let you know.

1329
02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:46,894
l'm taking Shantanu to Ajmer.

1330
02:06:50,102 --> 02:06:51,626
l'll get them married

1331
02:06:53,238 --> 02:06:54,000
Marriage?

1332
02:06:55,608 --> 02:06:57,906
Who are you to get them married?

1333
02:06:58,944 --> 02:07:00,206
l'm Nadira lmam's brother.

1334
02:07:04,083 --> 02:07:05,414
When dad is not alive,

1335
02:07:06,285 --> 02:07:08,913
Then, it's the responsibility of a brother
to take care of his sister.

1336
02:07:10,055 --> 02:07:17,120
Team DrC

1337
02:07:19,965 --> 02:07:20,989
Good thing,

1338
02:07:24,103 --> 02:07:29,063
l'm glad that you have more
affection towards your sister!

1339
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,338
Now you can leave!

1340
02:07:44,089 --> 02:07:47,024
Now, it's enough if l alone decide.

1341
02:07:47,393 --> 02:07:49,361
When shall we go to Ajmer?

1342
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:55,066
You will only lose in this, Naseeb.

1343
02:07:56,068 --> 02:08:01,563
lnfact Nawabian blood hangover
is not for your dad, Jaffar lmam,

1344
02:08:01,774 --> 02:08:02,570
but for your sister!

1345
02:08:03,776 --> 02:08:06,506
Her word.....the value she gives for it,

1346
02:08:08,247 --> 02:08:09,509
even her love towards me,

1347
02:08:09,782 --> 02:08:11,306
is the value of her word in the past!

1348
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:14,219
lmagine, l come along with you

1349
02:08:14,787 --> 02:08:18,655
Valuing the word she'd given her dad,
she'll not even bother to see me!

1350
02:08:19,792 --> 02:08:23,694
Anyhow, thanks for the kindness
you showed to me.

1351
02:08:25,597 --> 02:08:26,564
l will wait.

1352
02:08:28,734 --> 02:08:29,564
We will wait.

1353
02:08:32,271 --> 02:08:34,034
Whatever it is,
l don't have to shutterfor sure!

1354
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,336
That's enough.

1355
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:41,342
ln any case, let me give it a shot!

1356
02:08:43,615 --> 02:08:44,206
Bye!

1357
02:08:55,794 --> 02:08:57,352
What happened? What did that boy say?

1358
02:08:57,796 --> 02:09:00,026
Seems she is fine there.

1359
02:09:00,632 --> 02:09:02,327
Thank heavens!

1360
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:04,598
l had come here to tell you
something else also.

1361
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:07,595
Before that.. Sweet Kiss for you....

1362
02:09:08,307 --> 02:09:09,604
Why all this ?

1363
02:09:09,808 --> 02:09:10,172
There's a reason!

1364
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:12,070
Your dialogue yesterday was inspiring!

1365
02:09:12,311 --> 02:09:15,075
After hearing that,
Duva's mind has changed a bit!

1366
02:09:15,347 --> 02:09:18,339
Didn't l tell you
about an Engineer's proposal for her..

1367
02:09:18,617 --> 02:09:20,084
She's now agreed.

1368
02:09:20,619 --> 02:09:23,087
You sinner! What a mess!

1369
02:09:23,322 --> 02:09:26,291
O Koya! l blurted out in depression!

1370
02:09:27,059 --> 02:09:28,026
l want to meet Duva now.

1371
02:09:28,627 --> 02:09:29,252
Yes, What is up?

1372
02:09:30,629 --> 02:09:31,493
Do you know...

1373
02:09:31,630 --> 02:09:34,463
No boats will go to sea till tomorrow noon.

1374
02:09:34,633 --> 02:09:36,328
Some security problem, it seems!

1375
02:09:36,568 --> 02:09:38,160
ln the pretext of inspection,

1376
02:09:38,403 --> 02:09:39,597
Navy people took away
two boats that belonged to Sports!

1377
02:09:40,205 --> 02:09:41,832
''Manju'' that is scheduled to
leave Kozhikode tonight,

1378
02:09:42,274 --> 02:09:43,639
has been ordered to leave
only tomorrow afternoon.

1379
02:09:47,546 --> 02:09:56,113
Team DrC

1380
02:10:01,493 --> 02:10:03,085
-May l? - Yes.

1381
02:10:03,829 --> 02:10:07,094
Good evening, Doctor!
l'm Captain Rajan Jose!

1382
02:10:08,133 --> 02:10:12,092
lf there is any medical evacuation
for the next 48 hrs, you should inform us.

1383
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:15,231
What's the problem, sir?

1384
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:17,374
Sorry, l can't disclose to you.

1385
02:10:18,644 --> 02:10:19,372
Thank you.

1386
02:10:25,918 --> 02:10:27,647
4 cups of tea, please

1387
02:10:29,621 --> 02:10:31,521
Let me go and check the ship's schedule.

1388
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:43,358
Are they rushing on getting
any Tsunami information!

1389
02:10:43,802 --> 02:10:46,600
Only if the Tsunami arrival is kept a secret,
will the people get killed, right?

1390
02:10:53,278 --> 02:10:56,179
There are no ships for four days.

1391
02:10:56,615 --> 02:10:58,446
Oh Mother Mary! Do l've
to tolerate him forfour more days?

1392
02:11:06,625 --> 02:11:07,216
NADlRA

1393
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:15,766
What are you doing?

1394
02:11:16,301 --> 02:11:17,268
lsn't Nadira in Ajmer now?

1395
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:19,801
Her SlM is with her dad, right?

1396
02:11:20,973 --> 02:11:23,601
This is not Nadira but Jaffar lmam!

1397
02:11:26,979 --> 02:11:27,843
Wait, don't take it now..

1398
02:11:28,647 --> 02:11:29,909
For the ruckus created by his son,

1399
02:11:30,282 --> 02:11:31,579
lt might be a plan to hook you, l suppose!

1400
02:11:31,783 --> 02:11:33,375
Let it be anything, attend the phone
before it gets cut.

1401
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:35,382
Put it on the speaker.

1402
02:11:42,794 --> 02:11:44,523
l'm Jaffar lmam speaking.

1403
02:11:45,631 --> 02:11:47,394
my daughter has a wrong belief

1404
02:11:47,633 --> 02:11:50,261
that l will accept you before l die

1405
02:11:50,969 --> 02:11:52,596
that must be some other fathers

1406
02:11:52,971 --> 02:11:55,371
who might change their opinion as they die

1407
02:11:55,841 --> 02:11:57,468
l am not one of them,

1408
02:11:58,644 --> 02:12:00,703
My son also on your side...

1409
02:12:02,247 --> 02:12:03,874
for him l am dead long back,

1410
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:09,278
The situation is such that
l can't wait any longer,

1411
02:12:10,822 --> 02:12:14,781
Forthe sake of all,
l've to take up a decision .

1412
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:18,956
Now l will give you a chance.

1413
02:12:20,332 --> 02:12:21,356
Come to Kochi.

1414
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,627
Nadira and me are at Kochi

1415
02:12:24,236 --> 02:12:25,965
But only for the next 24 hours.

1416
02:12:27,339 --> 02:12:27,805
When?

1417
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:28,965
Tomorrow.

1418
02:12:31,343 --> 02:12:32,367
l will come.

1419
02:12:32,811 --> 02:12:33,869
You will not come.

1420
02:12:34,846 --> 02:12:35,608
l'll come.

1421
02:12:35,814 --> 02:12:36,781
How will you come?

1422
02:12:37,916 --> 02:12:38,678
Swimming?

1423
02:12:39,985 --> 02:12:42,385
Do you know the distance
between Kochi to Kavaratti?

1424
02:12:43,355 --> 02:12:46,290
218 nautical miles!

1425
02:12:47,659 --> 02:12:51,618
And for the next 4 days there are
no flights on hire,

1426
02:12:51,997 --> 02:12:53,624
and even if you leave immediately by boat,

1427
02:12:53,865 --> 02:12:58,529
it will still take you 48 hours.

1428
02:12:58,937 --> 02:13:02,304
l am waiting eagerly for you.

1429
02:13:03,342 --> 02:13:06,641
Even if l die, l will still come.

1430
02:13:07,012 --> 02:13:12,006
Promise me this talk will be
only between you and me,

1431
02:13:13,318 --> 02:13:15,479
it should not reach my kids.

1432
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:18,016
Do you agree with that?

1433
02:13:26,832 --> 02:13:27,730
l agree!

1434
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,401
l will wait for you ...eagerly!

1435
02:13:38,677 --> 02:13:40,872
Oh! All this commotion is
solely to block you!

1436
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:43,607
Let's not stand here anymore.

1437
02:13:43,815 --> 02:13:44,941
What's the problem?
What did he say?

1438
02:13:45,317 --> 02:13:47,478
l'll tell you! Come to the Lighthouse!

1439
02:13:50,222 --> 02:13:57,185
Team DrC

1440
02:13:59,898 --> 02:14:02,093
-Don't allow anybody to the lighthouse.
-Okay, sir.

1441
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:07,797
What a disaster is this!
Hell with his Challenge!!

1442
02:14:08,006 --> 02:14:09,496
Bloody 24 hrs time!
What bullshit is this!

1443
02:14:10,342 --> 02:14:11,934
He knows that even if he
blocks all the outlets,

1444
02:14:12,411 --> 02:14:14,038
you will do some adventures in the Sea.

1445
02:14:14,446 --> 02:14:16,038
At least in that way,
he wants you to be killed!

1446
02:14:16,648 --> 02:14:18,479
What adventure can he do in the Sea? Swim?

1447
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:20,417
Talk practically!

1448
02:14:20,652 --> 02:14:22,085
He has also hampered the boat service.

1449
02:14:22,988 --> 02:14:25,081
Even if boat-travel is possible,
based on his nature...

1450
02:14:25,457 --> 02:14:26,947
When you cross from the
territorial sea to the Open sea,

1451
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:28,621
...he is sure to have engaged
goondas to kill you!

1452
02:14:28,894 --> 02:14:30,384
Hardly would there be any
evidence left behind!

1453
02:14:30,996 --> 02:14:33,988
You will not go tomorrow!
What the hell will happen?

1454
02:14:34,366 --> 02:14:35,765
Dad and daughter will
go back the way they came!.

1455
02:14:36,001 --> 02:14:38,435
Just because you didn't go there,
she is not going to marry somebody else!

1456
02:14:38,637 --> 02:14:40,468
Moreover, she is not aware
of all these happenings.

1457
02:14:40,839 --> 02:14:42,397
Whatever it is, rather than drowning and dying,

1458
02:14:43,675 --> 02:14:44,801
Waiting will be much better.

1459
02:14:45,177 --> 02:14:46,974
Let them run around and
sweat profusely for 24 hrs.

1460
02:14:52,818 --> 02:14:55,946
Nothing will happen if l don't go.

1461
02:14:57,155 --> 02:14:58,782
Nobody's life will be at risk!

1462
02:15:00,092 --> 02:15:04,426
As you said, she will go back
without being aware of the happenings.

1463
02:15:05,097 --> 02:15:08,965
But...in case l am able to go..

1464
02:15:12,671 --> 02:15:14,571
..This waiting will end tomorrow.

1465
02:15:17,876 --> 02:15:21,744
That's why l promised to reach
there tomorrow risking my life.

1466
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:25,641
And it's not to prove my manliness
l am accepting his challenge!

1467
02:15:27,686 --> 02:15:28,812
lf l happen to die, let me die.

1468
02:15:29,688 --> 02:15:31,121
Only for this, l..

1469
02:15:36,428 --> 02:15:37,395
l must go

1470
02:15:43,802 --> 02:15:44,166
What happened?

1471
02:15:44,603 --> 02:15:46,070
A captain from the Navy has come...

1472
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:48,063
to inspect the Lighthouse right away.

1473
02:15:50,242 --> 02:15:53,211
You lift him up nicely and show him.
Let him inspect and go.

1474
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:57,041
-lf you let him inside, l'll kill you, mind it.
-Ask him to come tomorrow.

1475
02:15:58,083 --> 02:15:59,141
Planning to trap us from every side!

1476
02:15:59,784 --> 02:16:01,046
Seems the captain wants to inspect now.

1477
02:16:03,788 --> 02:16:04,812
So, you want to go.

1478
02:16:06,024 --> 02:16:07,821
Whatever you said, is right! You must go.

1479
02:16:09,194 --> 02:16:11,594
Koya! Suggest some way!

1480
02:16:12,697 --> 02:16:13,664
Suggest something!

1481
02:16:16,034 --> 02:16:18,662
There is a fisheries boat..in the Yard.

1482
02:16:19,037 --> 02:16:20,129
Work is almost completed!

1483
02:16:21,106 --> 02:16:22,733
lf you drive in full throttle,

1484
02:16:22,941 --> 02:16:25,239
You can reach there by tomorrow night.

1485
02:16:26,278 --> 02:16:29,736
But evading their sight, how
can l take the boat from Yard?

1486
02:16:29,948 --> 02:16:30,812
That's the second thing.

1487
02:16:31,016 --> 02:16:31,983
First is Hussain!

1488
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:34,013
Come...Come l say!

1489
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:36,244
Don't hang around, Come Koya!

1490
02:16:36,788 --> 02:16:42,420
Team DrC

1491
02:16:42,727 --> 02:16:44,092
Here comes Shantanu sir!

1492
02:16:45,163 --> 02:16:46,562
Come! Come!
Oh! All of you are here!

1493
02:16:50,235 --> 02:16:50,894
-ls Hussain there in the Qawwali?
-He'll be there!

1494
02:17:05,217 --> 02:17:07,185
Sir...that will not work out..
Let's move.

1495
02:17:07,919 --> 02:17:09,079
-What happened?
-Propeller is ...

1496
02:17:09,221 --> 02:17:10,119
Won't it be enough if we bring it here?

1497
02:17:10,322 --> 02:17:11,755
Will your dad go and bring it from Kochi

1498
02:17:12,724 --> 02:17:13,691
He was calling me SlR so far,

1499
02:17:14,059 --> 02:17:15,026
and calling me names now?

1500
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:28,831
Both of them are over the
phone for a long time.

1501
02:17:29,140 --> 02:17:30,107
Do you think it will work out?

1502
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:32,305
What happened?

1503
02:17:32,877 --> 02:17:34,572
l called up Sherin!
l didn't disclose anything!!

1504
02:17:34,713 --> 02:17:36,271
l can't reveal your name to her

1505
02:17:36,715 --> 02:17:38,273
There are no possibilities for
Evacuation tomorrow.

1506
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:40,845
Or if it is for today,
then someone must get heart attack!!

1507
02:17:41,052 --> 02:17:41,848
Most probably it would be me!!

1508
02:17:43,154 --> 02:17:44,280
Navy people had gone there also!

1509
02:17:45,056 --> 02:17:47,752
Any Evacuation order can be done
only after informing them!

1510
02:17:48,226 --> 02:17:49,193
So, that idea is also ruled out.

1511
02:17:59,304 --> 02:18:00,669
Will you stop this bloody laughing?

1512
02:18:04,142 --> 02:18:05,268
We'll surely win, sir!

1513
02:18:06,711 --> 02:18:11,307
My friend's friend Farid, has a yacht!

1514
02:18:11,683 --> 02:18:12,843
He is an avid racertoo!

1515
02:18:13,051 --> 02:18:15,144
l only told them that it is for a bet
to reach Kochi tomorrow!

1516
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:16,812
He demanded 2.5 lakhs!

1517
02:18:17,055 --> 02:18:17,714
And l fixed it for 2 lakhs!

1518
02:18:17,922 --> 02:18:20,823
-Any problem?
-What problem? Tell me the rest.

1519
02:18:21,726 --> 02:18:24,854
At early morning, 5 am he will
come to the 2nd buoy next to the Reef!

1520
02:18:25,063 --> 02:18:26,826
To go there, we have to row the fibre boat

1521
02:18:27,232 --> 02:18:29,826
He has promised to reach
Kochi by tomorrow evening 5' 0 clock.

1522
02:18:33,071 --> 02:18:35,869
To reach yard at 5 am,
we must leave at least by 2 a.m.

1523
02:18:36,074 --> 02:18:38,042
l'll also come with you as there will be
a rapid flow of water during that time.

1524
02:18:43,048 --> 02:18:46,017
Surely you will win! lf not you, who else?

1525
02:18:47,018 --> 02:18:50,010
lmmediately bring your fibre boat
and fasten it there.

1526
02:18:52,157 --> 02:18:53,886
lt's necessary!

1527
02:18:56,728 --> 02:18:58,389
lsn't there a bulb glowing
on that corner post?

1528
02:18:58,897 --> 02:18:59,955
Hit and break it!

1529
02:19:00,732 --> 02:19:01,699
Koya! Those people are there.

1530
02:19:02,934 --> 02:19:04,026
They are after us only.

1531
02:19:43,742 --> 02:19:44,333
Hold this.

1532
02:19:45,744 --> 02:19:47,041
We don't have to wait until
it is 1'O' clock

1533
02:19:47,445 --> 02:19:49,106
Any moment those people may come in.

1534
02:19:49,914 --> 02:19:51,677
Yes! Come, let's move.

1535
02:19:53,284 --> 02:19:54,216
Come quickly.

1536
02:19:55,887 --> 02:19:57,752
They don't patrol because of rain

1537
02:19:59,958 --> 02:20:01,118
Call me immediately, while boarding the yacht.

1538
02:20:14,105 --> 02:20:14,901
Gosh! Was it you?

1539
02:20:15,306 --> 02:20:17,069
-What happened?
- Here they go.

1540
02:20:34,759 --> 02:20:35,726
What do you feel, dude?

1541
02:20:36,094 --> 02:20:36,958
Feel like sleeping!

1542
02:20:37,162 --> 02:20:37,992
lt's 4'0 clock!

1543
02:20:38,196 --> 02:20:39,128
Wait for one more hour.

1544
02:20:39,364 --> 02:20:40,194
Let him call.

1545
02:20:41,099 --> 02:20:42,430
Wake me up when he calls.

1546
02:20:50,008 --> 02:20:53,171
Hello! Jeez!

1547
02:20:59,250 --> 02:20:59,944
Shucks!

1548
02:21:01,085 --> 02:21:01,517
What happened?

1549
02:21:02,086 --> 02:21:02,711
Come.

1550
02:21:22,574 --> 02:21:24,132
Navy people seized the Yacht!

1551
02:21:24,576 --> 02:21:27,136
They will let it off only tomorrow after
checking the papers and permit.

1552
02:21:27,345 --> 02:21:30,178
When we were half the way,
Farid had called so we returned.

1553
02:21:34,252 --> 02:21:39,485
Let her.....Ler her go back, dude.

1554
02:21:41,926 --> 02:21:42,893
What you said was right.

1555
02:21:44,329 --> 02:21:47,924
Even if l don't go, nothing will happen

1556
02:21:51,069 --> 02:21:56,200
But...For me, nothing more can happen!

1557
02:21:59,110 --> 02:22:00,077
But you..

1558
02:22:01,246 --> 02:22:02,907
Koya, why did you inform them now?

1559
02:22:03,248 --> 02:22:04,340
Couldn't you tell them in the morning?

1560
02:22:06,851 --> 02:22:10,309
lt's almost dawn. All of you go.

1561
02:22:14,259 --> 02:22:17,490
l want to lie down. l'm very tired.

1562
02:22:18,963 --> 02:22:20,828
Shall l also sleep with him today?

1563
02:22:21,366 --> 02:22:23,231
No...l'll sleep.

1564
02:22:26,938 --> 02:22:28,064
-Shall l? - No, leave.

1565
02:22:34,979 --> 02:22:46,447
Team DrC

1566
02:22:58,336 --> 02:22:59,303
Have you decided not to go?

1567
02:23:01,105 --> 02:23:01,901
l must go.

1568
02:23:03,942 --> 02:23:04,431
How?

1569
02:23:06,477 --> 02:23:09,640
Need to use a bag of tricks like earlier days!

1570
02:23:11,182 --> 02:23:12,149
As l intended!

1571
02:23:13,985 --> 02:23:15,043
Evacuation!

1572
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:20,450
The patient is..

1573
02:23:20,692 --> 02:23:21,351
You or me?

1574
02:23:22,627 --> 02:23:23,457
Me only.

1575
02:23:25,129 --> 02:23:27,461
But, what is your illness?

1576
02:23:33,137 --> 02:23:36,231
Not illness! But suicide attempt!

1577
02:23:37,642 --> 02:23:39,109
Reason - Love failure!

1578
02:23:42,046 --> 02:23:42,978
Will it work?

1579
02:23:44,616 --> 02:23:48,347
But that devil Sherin...
You've odds with her now..

1580
02:23:49,621 --> 02:23:50,883
l can tackle her.

1581
02:23:51,623 --> 02:23:53,022
..but l need your support as well.

1582
02:23:54,626 --> 02:23:58,221
We two only, No one else.

1583
02:23:59,631 --> 02:24:01,258
Even Rajeev and Koya
should not know about this.

1584
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:05,260
Only then they will be
able to react naturally.

1585
02:24:17,415 --> 02:24:29,225
Team DrC

1586
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:35,028
Shantanu ditched us. Rush up.

1587
02:24:44,275 --> 02:24:50,236
Oh Rajeev! My God! Shantanu
ditched us. Come quickly.

1588

We need to inform the Police.
Come quickly.

1589
02:24:59,123 --> 02:25:01,353
Oh God! Please help......Please help...

02:25:02,627 --> 02:25:04,060

1591
02:25:07,999 --> 02:25:10,365
Oh my God! Who is here to hear?.

1592
02:25:14,439 --> 02:25:18,398
Please help....Help, please.

1593
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:33,386
Oh my bro! Shantanu sir ditched us!

1594
02:25:33,825 --> 02:25:35,383
Save him at any cost.

1595
02:25:35,827 --> 02:25:38,455
Call the people quickly.
Rush....Call the people.

1596
02:25:44,135 --> 02:25:46,399
Shantanu sir inhaled something!

1597
02:25:47,638 --> 02:25:49,765
Oh my God! Give some first aid to him.
Go quickly.

1598
02:25:52,110 --> 02:25:54,078
My hands and legs are trembling!
Oh God!

1599
02:25:54,645 --> 02:25:57,011
Sir! lt's Poison!

1600
02:25:57,215 --> 02:25:58,182
l know that, you fool!

1601
02:25:59,317 --> 02:26:00,784
Are you kneading Paratha on his chest?

1602
02:26:01,252 --> 02:26:03,186
Sir, call the ambulance quickly.

1603
02:26:04,822 --> 02:26:06,380
Hey, no range for BSNL here!

1604
02:26:11,362 --> 02:26:12,522
l don't get anybody overthe phone...
Oh my God!

1605
02:26:12,830 --> 02:26:13,797
What on earth will l do now?

1606
02:26:16,334 --> 02:26:17,392
Give him some first aid.

1607
02:26:17,835 --> 02:26:21,168
Whom shall l call now?
-Call the Police!

1608
02:26:26,144 --> 02:26:28,806
Shantanu sir inhaled poisonous gas!
What will l do now?

1609
02:26:29,313 --> 02:26:30,245
Run quickly.

1610
02:26:30,815 --> 02:26:31,679
Let me call somebody for help.

1611
02:26:38,156 --> 02:26:39,123
Wasn't that you who announced
n the mike that day?

1612
02:26:39,323 --> 02:26:40,051
Go and announce quickly

1613
02:26:40,424 --> 02:26:41,118
ls he dead, then?

1614
02:26:41,325 --> 02:26:42,292
l'll give you a smack! Go and announce.

1615
02:26:45,329 --> 02:26:46,296
lnform the Pilot immediately.

1616
02:26:46,664 --> 02:26:49,531
-Pilot?-Go and call quickly, Rascal

1617
02:26:52,170 --> 02:26:54,138
Don't waste time and risk his life.

1618
02:26:56,374 --> 02:26:58,501
Oh my God! Atta has come!

1619
02:27:00,178 --> 02:27:02,271
Oh my Atta! Look what Shantanu has done!

1620
02:27:02,647 --> 02:27:04,114
ls there any need for him to do this?

1621
02:27:05,316 --> 02:27:06,476
Can't he at least tell me once?

1622
02:27:07,318 --> 02:27:09,081
What the hell you were doing here, then?

1623
02:27:09,387 --> 02:27:10,877
Had he given me any hint,
l would've stayed awake!

1624
02:27:12,390 --> 02:27:16,622
He only told me it's a poisonous gas.

1625
02:27:16,828 --> 02:27:17,795
Why did he do this knowingly?

1626
02:27:19,397 --> 02:27:21,388
No point in pressing!
Give him artificial breathing through mouth!

1627
02:27:21,632 --> 02:27:21,893
Me?

1628
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:23,389
Oh no! Get aside.

1629
02:27:24,335 --> 02:27:24,858
Give me the phone.

1630
02:27:29,874 --> 02:27:30,772
Here the Police has arrived

1631
02:27:31,142 --> 02:27:33,872
Hello Sherin, Where are you?
Quarters?

1632
02:27:35,146 --> 02:27:36,408
Carry him soon!

1633
02:27:40,651 --> 02:27:41,208
Move...move

1634
02:27:41,652 --> 02:27:43,119
Yes, it's Carbon-mono-oxide!

1635
02:27:43,821 --> 02:27:44,753
l'm not sure of that.

1636
02:27:45,323 --> 02:27:46,381
Keep the cylinder in the vehicle.

1637
02:27:47,758 --> 02:27:51,216
Ask the doctor not to treat him here...

1638
02:27:51,429 --> 02:27:52,794
Send him to Kochi as early as possible.

1639
02:27:56,667 --> 02:27:57,497
Zakhariah, get in.

1640
02:27:57,869 --> 02:27:59,234
Keep the cylinder inside.
Doctor has to get in.

1641
02:28:01,806 --> 02:28:02,500
l will feel suffocated there..

1642
02:28:08,312 --> 02:28:09,279
Move quickly.

1643
02:28:11,382 --> 02:28:13,680
Somebody call the doctor and
ask her to keep everything ready.

1644
02:28:14,652 --> 02:28:15,676
Speed up, you rascal!

1645
02:28:16,821 --> 02:28:17,685
Don't take away his life!

1646
02:28:29,667 --> 02:28:31,897
He has inhaled Carbon monoxide!
lt's poisonous!

1647
02:28:32,303 --> 02:28:34,294
He himself told me that one who inhales,
will not survive more than 4 hrs

1648
02:28:34,672 --> 02:28:36,572
Not sure what time
he has taken this in the morning.

1649
02:28:37,675 --> 02:28:38,642
So it was deliberate!

1650
02:28:39,010 --> 02:28:40,238
Will anyone do it for fun?

1651
02:28:43,247 --> 02:28:43,872
Doctor, just a minute.

1652
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:50,612
Planning to take away his life,
keeping him here?

1653
02:28:50,955 --> 02:28:52,445
Calm down.. Let me talk to the Doctor.

1654
02:28:56,661 --> 02:28:58,561
What's this, Rajeev?
What is his problem?

1655
02:28:58,863 --> 02:29:00,558
From the beginning,
l felt some abnormality in him

1656
02:29:01,265 --> 02:29:02,789
He doesn't have any
consistency as a whole.

1657
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:03,898
l shall brief you!

1658
02:29:04,268 --> 02:29:06,930
But don't keep the last day incident
in your mind and be prejudiced!

1659
02:29:07,338 --> 02:29:08,202
Rajeev, you tell me.

1660
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:10,432
lt was a Suicide attempt.

1661
02:29:11,375 --> 02:29:12,603
His situation was so bad.

1662
02:29:14,345 --> 02:29:16,313
lt is an 11 yr old love affair!

1663
02:29:21,252 --> 02:29:41,629
Team DrC

1664
02:29:55,019 --> 02:29:56,316
Please move...Move....

1665
02:29:56,554 --> 02:29:58,920
Don'tjust stand and lecture,
please try to save him.

1666
02:30:07,698 --> 02:30:09,666
What? What happened?

1667
02:30:14,705 --> 02:30:15,797
How will l endure this?

1668
02:30:17,041 --> 02:30:19,532
Without even a hint...he inhaled..

1669
02:30:20,044 --> 02:30:22,035
Let's ask the Doctor...Ask the doctor.

1670
02:30:23,681 --> 02:30:24,648
Call the helicopter, please.

1671
02:30:25,349 --> 02:30:26,407
Sir..Calm down...sit there.

1672
02:30:26,851 --> 02:30:28,045
How am l going to bear this?

1673
02:30:38,763 --> 02:30:41,288
So, it was not to die!
But taken a chance!!

1674
02:30:41,699 --> 02:30:43,064
lf destined to reach,
he will reach, isn't it?

1675
02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:48,429
Ready to take any risk forfriend's love!

1676
02:30:48,606 --> 02:30:50,073
But not for your own sister!

1677
02:30:51,675 --> 02:30:53,643
l hate seeing this fellow.
Get away.

1678
02:30:56,414 --> 02:30:58,541
Pass on the information to the Helipad.

1679
02:30:58,916 --> 02:30:59,940
l'm going to orderfor evacuation.

1680
02:31:01,952 --> 02:31:02,509
Please move.

1681
02:31:09,693 --> 02:31:12,423
lf you are ready to sacrifice life for love,
you will find many girls in your hometown!

1682
02:31:12,696 --> 02:31:14,425
What is the need for you to go up to Lucknow?

1683
02:31:15,366 --> 02:31:17,800
Oh, sorry! l am not suppose to
talk a word about LOVE!

1684
02:31:22,673 --> 02:31:23,571
Please move.

1685
02:31:26,677 --> 02:31:27,644
What's happening here?

1686
02:31:27,912 --> 02:31:30,073
This is Casualty! Wait outside.

1687
02:31:30,481 --> 02:31:31,641
Okay...Wait outside.

1688
02:31:32,683 --> 02:31:34,412
Tell me what happened to the patient.

1689
02:31:34,685 --> 02:31:35,652
Who are you to ask that?

1690
02:31:37,688 --> 02:31:38,985
Jamal, here is the evacuation order.

1691
02:31:39,890 --> 02:31:42,051
No, doctor. lt's a fake case.

1692
02:31:42,693 --> 02:31:43,660
What nonsense is he talking?

1693
02:31:43,861 --> 02:31:44,953
lt's not you who should decide it.

1694
02:31:45,196 --> 02:31:46,424
You're not a doctor, are you?

1695
02:31:46,664 --> 02:31:48,859
l'm not a doctor, but l've
got a Navy doctor with me.

1696
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:49,828
Let him examine him.

1697
02:31:50,034 --> 02:31:51,524
Who the hell are you to order me?

1698
02:31:51,702 --> 02:31:52,964
l'm the Medical Superintendent.

1699
02:31:53,170 --> 02:31:54,660
lt's not Navy that pays me the salary.

1700
02:31:55,206 --> 02:31:57,800
And it's my discretion,
to certify the evacuation.

1701
02:31:58,008 --> 02:31:58,997
Evacuation is your...

1702
02:31:59,210 --> 02:32:01,405
Let the Navy doctor attend
only Navy people, clear?

1703
02:32:01,679 --> 02:32:02,646
Get out.

1704
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:05,644
Doctor, Evacuation you can decide.

1705
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:08,512
But l should decide whether
the helicopter should fly or not!

1706
02:32:08,853 --> 02:32:10,081
You don't have to decide about that,

1707
02:32:10,488 --> 02:32:11,147
that'll fly by itself.

1708
02:32:11,689 --> 02:32:13,589
Moreover Helicopter doesn't
belong to the Navy.

1709
02:32:13,691 --> 02:32:16,091
lt's the Air ambulance of
Lakshwadeep Administration.

1710
02:32:16,861 --> 02:32:19,955
Jamal, call the collector before
they plan up for something else.

1711
02:32:20,164 --> 02:32:22,155
-Pilot?-Go and call quickly, Rascal

1712
02:32:26,570 --> 02:32:28,663
Listen, doctor! ls he really serious?

1713
02:32:28,873 --> 02:32:30,807
Yes! Cent percent sure.

1714
02:32:44,722 --> 02:32:49,853
No, sir! Till now, l've been
obeying your orders as a Junior officer.

1715
02:32:50,261 --> 02:32:51,853
Now l refuse to do it.

1716
02:32:52,129 --> 02:32:54,097
And also would like to inform you that

1717
02:32:54,732 --> 02:32:57,166
lndian Navy is not an
organization to dance,

1718
02:32:57,568 --> 02:32:59,035
according to somebody's whims
and fancies, sir.

1719
02:32:59,737 --> 02:33:00,669
Hail lndia!

1720
02:33:02,039 --> 02:33:04,530
Get the ambulance quickly.

1721
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:08,001
-How does he feel now?
-Quite critical!

1722
02:33:08,712 --> 02:33:09,679
What about the evacuation?

1723
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:11,006
Order will be passed right now.

1724
02:33:11,215 --> 02:33:14,241
Thank heavens! l'm relieved!
Tomorrow l've a programme.

1725
02:33:14,585 --> 02:33:16,849
So, l can also join them in the
helicopter, right?

1726
02:33:18,722 --> 02:33:21,589
You bloody bitch! Hell with his programme!

1727
02:33:21,959 --> 02:33:23,085
l'll kick you down!

1728
02:33:24,061 --> 02:33:25,085
Even if there is a vacant seat,

1729
02:33:25,296 --> 02:33:26,888
l'm ready to occupy a donkey but not you.

1730
02:33:27,998 --> 02:33:29,056
Don't you understand the situation, sir!

1731
02:33:29,733 --> 02:33:32,463
l just asked him whether
l could go with them.

1732
02:33:37,741 --> 02:33:39,709
No no this is fraud ,

1733
02:33:41,912 --> 02:33:43,004
You cannot do this ,

1734
02:33:45,716 --> 02:33:47,547
He is making a fool of everyone!

1735
02:33:51,722 --> 02:33:52,086
Okay!

1736
02:33:53,724 --> 02:33:54,281
Let the scoundrel come!

1737
02:33:57,061 --> 02:33:59,029
As he comes he will go behind bars,
bloody Madrasi!

1738
02:34:10,074 --> 02:34:11,939
What is this new drama, dad?

1739
02:34:13,210 --> 02:34:15,178
You bought me here saying that

1740
02:34:15,713 --> 02:34:18,841
you will talk to Shantanu
and find a way out.

1741
02:34:20,217 --> 02:34:22,082
But l don't see anything of that sort,

1742
02:34:23,153 --> 02:34:26,088
l can't talk to a traitor.

1743
02:34:37,234 --> 02:34:38,132
Hello!

1744
02:34:41,071 --> 02:34:52,915
Team DrC

1745
02:34:58,289 --> 02:34:59,187
Dad!

1746
02:35:00,157 --> 02:35:01,681
Whatever he did is wrong!

1747
02:35:02,059 --> 02:35:02,650
He betrayed us

1748
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:03,890
Fraud!

1749
02:35:05,029 --> 02:35:06,792
He did not keep his word,

1750
02:35:06,997 --> 02:35:08,123
broke a promise!

1751
02:35:08,399 --> 02:35:10,026
Promise, trust...?

1752
02:35:10,734 --> 02:35:11,962
Stop playing this game!

1753
02:35:13,604 --> 02:35:15,037
You are the one who cheated us, dad!

1754
02:35:26,717 --> 02:35:28,378
Listen to me very carefully.

1755
02:35:28,886 --> 02:35:33,118
Shantanu has to reach here unharmed,

1756
02:35:34,892 --> 02:35:36,883
at any cost, before me ...!

1757
02:35:40,164 --> 02:35:42,132
lf he doesn't come before me alive..

1758
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:06,679
Move all of you.

1759
02:36:06,924 --> 02:36:08,983
Move...Bring him quickly.

1760
02:36:09,993 --> 02:36:10,322
Make it fast.

1761
02:36:14,932 --> 02:36:15,330
You get in first.

1762
02:36:19,937 --> 02:36:20,335
Lift him.

1763
02:36:38,288 --> 02:36:39,448
My dear...Come..

1764
02:36:40,991 --> 02:36:43,186
-Come dear - Go..

1765
02:36:48,932 --> 02:36:49,762
You go..

1766
02:37:02,179 --> 02:37:02,668
Come...get inside.

1767
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:03,876
Come..

1768
02:37:21,265 --> 02:37:21,924
Close!

1769
02:37:50,227 --> 02:37:59,693
Team DrC

1770
02:38:20,591 --> 02:38:23,185
What happened to her dad's 24 hrs!!
Finished?

1771
02:38:25,195 --> 02:38:27,356
He is perfectly alright!
Just acting!

1772
02:38:30,934 --> 02:38:31,298
Oh my God!

1773
02:38:33,971 --> 02:38:36,235
Because of our ploys,
your love blossomed!

1774
02:38:36,607 --> 02:38:38,438
Let's go there and see
if his love will blossom or not!

1775
02:38:41,245 --> 02:38:42,906
Look how shocked this fool is!

1776
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:46,206
lt's not fair!
You could've at least told me...

1777
02:38:46,583 --> 02:38:48,050
lf l'd told you, then you will
collapse everything by your act.

1778
02:38:48,318 --> 02:38:50,115
See! l'm travelling to Kochi in dhothi!

1779
02:38:52,089 --> 02:38:52,885
Enough of acting!

1780
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:54,557
They are not going to
land the helicopter here.

1781
02:39:00,597 --> 02:39:02,428
You rascal! Have you cheated me?

1782
02:39:03,267 --> 02:39:04,996
Thinking it was a game only
l supported you.

1783
02:39:05,602 --> 02:39:06,569
ls this a game?

1784
02:39:07,971 --> 02:39:08,995
Hurry up, please.

1785
02:39:10,607 --> 02:39:12,575
Do you want to risk your life by fooling me?

1786
02:39:18,015 --> 02:39:19,312
l can't take any chance in this anymore.

1787
02:39:20,284 --> 02:39:25,221
By this...if it ends also, l'll be happy.

1788
02:39:25,622 --> 02:39:26,589
Oh my Jesus!

1789
02:39:29,192 --> 02:39:30,159
Don't worry, dude!!

1790
02:39:34,298 --> 02:39:35,162
Hurry up...

1791
02:39:38,635 --> 02:39:39,602
Put him the mask.

1792
02:40:15,505 --> 02:40:19,202
Team DrC

1793
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:24,338
He's a fraud! Arrest that man.

1794
02:40:25,349 --> 02:40:26,077
lt's all drama!

1795
02:40:26,350 --> 02:40:27,908
Will you please shut up? He is dying

1796
02:40:40,130 --> 02:40:41,097
Come...Come on...fast.

1797
02:40:42,299 --> 02:40:42,958
Come on..

1798
02:41:46,096 --> 02:41:48,394
l just prayed to God that
you won't have to cry.

1799
02:43:15,218 --> 02:43:22,021
Team DrC

1800
02:43:42,212 --> 02:43:45,181
A saint in a Sufi centre said that as a joke,

1801
02:43:46,149 --> 02:43:49,346
about the coincidence hidden
behind our names!

1802
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:53,455
lt seems Anarkali's real name was Nadira,

1803
02:43:54,391 --> 02:43:58,623
and Salim refers to Shantanu(PEACE)

1804
02:44:00,797 --> 02:44:02,628
Anarkali and Salim!

1805
02:44:05,735 --> 02:44:11,435
Anyhow, thanks to God
for rescuing me from death!

1806
02:44:12,742 --> 02:44:15,609
LOVE - is also as strong as DEATH!
