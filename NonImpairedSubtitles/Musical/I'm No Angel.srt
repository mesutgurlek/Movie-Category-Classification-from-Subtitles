"Take all you can get

Come on, let's go out tonight.
I'll ditch the crowd.

- I told you I have a previous engagement.
- Break it.

- You'll never regret it.
- No.

I'd love to, but I've got to meet my aunt.

These relatives are a nuisance at times.

What about tomorrow?
For breakfast, lunch, dinner, anything.

We'll make it supper tomorrow night.

That's a date, then we'll go out.

That man sure is crazy about you, ain't he?

00:48:07,465 --> 00:48:09,820
The whole trouble with you,
you got nervous fingers.

765
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:11,657
SLICK: I'm all washed up with that.

766
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:13,895
What are you figuring on doing for a living?

767
00:48:13,985 --> 00:48:17,978
I don't know. I'm sort of up against it.
I thought maybe you might...

768
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,703
Pulling the sob on me?

769
00:48:19,785 --> 00:48:20,774
No, I...

770
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,093
I'll do something for you...

771
00:48:22,185 --> 00:48:24,653
if you promise to keep your hands
in your own pockets.

772
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:27,259
- Baby, I'd promise you anything.
- But would you keep it?

773
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:30,178
- Do you want me to swear?
- Never mind, I can do that myself.

774
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:34,053
Listen, go see Barton. Tell him I said
to find something for you to do over there.

775
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:37,262
And here, take this.
But don't make a habit of it.

776
00:48:37,345 --> 00:48:40,064
Get yourself some clothes
so you start looking normal again.

777
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:41,578
Say, you're a pal.

778
00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:45,097
- You know there never was a dame like you.
- Forget that.

779
00:48:45,185 --> 00:48:48,416
Okay, but I just want you to know
I'm still warm for you, baby.

780
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:51,815
- Maybe I'll be seeing you.
- Make it soon, will you?

781
00:48:52,025 --> 00:48:53,538
Get going.

782
00:48:55,905 --> 00:48:58,135
That guy would show up now.

783
00:48:59,945 --> 00:49:01,173
Excuse me.

784
00:49:03,465 --> 00:49:04,659
[Doorbell buzzing]

785
00:49:08,585 --> 00:49:10,576
- Miss Tira's apartment?
- Yes, sir.

786
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:14,135
Just say if she can spare the time,
Mr. Clayton would like to see her.

787
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:17,541
BEULAH: I will if I can remember it,
if not, I'll just say he's here.

788
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:19,378
Perhaps that will do as well.

789
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:23,219
TIRA: Take the gentleman's hat and coat.
JACK: Thanks.

790
00:49:23,305 --> 00:49:24,897
I hope I haven't disturbed you.

791
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:26,179
Not so far.

792
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:30,576
Anything I can do for you?

793
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:33,305
Yes, there is,
but first I better introduce myself.

794
00:49:33,385 --> 00:49:36,138
That's not necessary, I know who you are.

795
00:49:36,345 --> 00:49:38,256
I've heard Kirk speak of you.

796
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:40,017
Good, that simplifies matters.

797
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:42,221
It's on Kirk's account I'm here.

798
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:44,023
I see.

799
00:49:46,585 --> 00:49:49,338
Let's sit down and be comfortable about it.

800
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:55,420
I hope I can come right to the point.

801
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,741
About this situation between you and Kirk...

802
00:49:57,825 --> 00:50:00,259
he's neglecting important business
on your account.

803
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:03,303
And there's Miss Hatton, his fiance,
to be considered.

804
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:05,376
TIRA: She's a novel twist.

805
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:08,534
Of course, I know you have no liking
for Miss Hatton.

806
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:11,458
She came in here, got nasty,
I had to put her in her place.

807
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:14,977
Yes, I heard you had
some slight misunderstanding.

808
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:17,823
Do you mind if I get personal?

809
00:50:17,985 --> 00:50:20,783
Go right ahead.
I don't mind if you get familiar.

810
00:50:21,505 --> 00:50:23,063
It's all in the family.

811
00:50:23,745 --> 00:50:27,624
Well, then, do you really care for Kirk?
I mean, do you love him?

812
00:50:28,145 --> 00:50:30,978
I don't know. See, my horoscope says so.

813
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:32,977
I'm afraid I don't understand.

814
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:35,659
I'm afraid
I don't understand it myself sometimes.

815
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:39,775
You see, it describes a guy,
I mean, a man like Kirk.

816
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:42,017
Surely you're not being serious.

817
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:45,859
Why, I certainly am.
My whole life is ruled by astrology.

818
00:50:46,905 --> 00:50:47,974
JACK: Well...

819
00:50:49,985 --> 00:50:51,816
What colour eyes have you got?

820
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:54,978
I don't know.

821
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:57,894
Fine.

822
00:50:58,145 --> 00:51:00,420
Well, as you were saying...

823
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,218
You're telling me simply because Kirk fits
some description in your horoscope...

824
00:51:06,305 --> 00:51:09,422
that you'd deliberately break up things
between him and Miss Hatton?

825
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:11,655
Maybe it would be a good break for him.

826
00:51:11,745 --> 00:51:15,021
Surely you wouldn't let personal dislike
destroy their engagement.

827
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,380
Unless, of course,
you have serious intentions.

828
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:19,023
What if I have?

829
00:51:19,865 --> 00:51:21,662
I'm afraid that's impossible.

830
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:25,101
Listen, with me nothing is impossible.

831
00:51:26,025 --> 00:51:27,253
That may be.

832
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:31,657
But I'm here to tell you, if you're thinking
of marrying Kirk, you better not count on it.

833
00:51:31,745 --> 00:51:35,181
TIRA: Kirk sent you up here with that line?
JACK: He doesn't know I'm here.

834
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:39,259
I get it. You figure the family honour
needs protecting.

835
00:51:39,825 --> 00:51:43,374
A circus dame would be sort of
a red leaf on the family tree, is that it?

836
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:45,979
Please understand
that it's been difficult for me...

837
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:50,024
to come here and talk to you about what you
no doubt consider is none of my business.

838
00:51:50,105 --> 00:51:51,777
That's all right, I don't care.

839
00:51:51,865 --> 00:51:55,096
If someone's got something on their mind,
I like them to get it off.

840
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:59,174
- You're an unusual sort of person.
- I've been accused of that.

841
00:51:59,465 --> 00:52:03,344
As a matter of fact, I'd much rather have
met you under pleasanter circumstances.

842
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:05,097
Same here, there's no hard feelings.

843
00:52:05,185 --> 00:52:08,336
Of course not. I shouldn't want you
to feel unfriendly toward me.

844
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,781
I shouldn't want you to get the impression
that I'm just an adventuress.

845
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,095
- I didn't think that.
- What did you think?

846
00:52:14,185 --> 00:52:17,063
I had no definite idea
what you would be like.

847
00:52:17,225 --> 00:52:18,863
I've seen newspaper pictures of you.

848
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:21,379
Yeah? Ever seen this one here?

849
00:52:21,825 --> 00:52:23,577
There's one of my favourites.

850
00:52:25,585 --> 00:52:28,577
- It looks just like you.
- It should, I posed for it.

851
00:52:30,145 --> 00:52:31,703
- You like it?
- Yes.

852
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:32,979
You can have it.

853
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:35,861
No, thanks, I wouldn't want to deprive you...

854
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:39,142
It's all right, I get them by the hundreds,
frame and all.

855
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:40,983
Well, in that case...

856
00:52:41,065 --> 00:52:43,101
Won't you stay? I'll ring for tea.

857
00:52:43,185 --> 00:52:46,575
No, thanks, really, I must be going.
You've been wonderful.

858
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:49,694
You've been kind of wonderful yourself.

859
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:51,414
Thank you.

860
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:02,976
Now you'll consider all I've said
and try and bring Kirk to his senses.

861
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:05,983
I can't promise anything right now, but...

862
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:09,537
you have started a new train of thought
in my mind.

863
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:12,378
I'll think it over and let you know
what I decide.

864
00:53:12,465 --> 00:53:15,537
- You'd be doing a fine thing.
- Yeah? Fine for who?

865
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:17,094
For all of us.

866
00:53:17,905 --> 00:53:20,021
You're kind of unusual yourself.

867
00:53:20,225 --> 00:53:22,216
I've been accused of that.

868
00:53:24,545 --> 00:53:26,661
Now you can reach me there at any time.

869
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,339
And I want to thank you
for the way you received me.

870
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:31,859
And you can reach me there at any time.

871
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:35,620
You'll hear from me.

872
00:53:37,665 --> 00:53:39,178

873
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:43,823

I've been thinking over
everything you said and...

880
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:19,253
I've made my decision.

881
00:54:19,385 --> 00:54:21,421
Good. I'm glad you made up
your mind quickly.

I'm very quick in a slow way.

It's got a lot of angles to it.

885
00:54:30,545 --> 00:54:32,581
You better come up and see me.

886
00:54:33,025 --> 00:54:34,424
I'll be glad to.

if it's convenient for you.

- Good evening, Miss Tira.

01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:26,334
BENNY: How are you?
You look so marvellous.

1073
01:05:26,425 --> 01:05:30,657
Come right in, sit right down
and make yourself at home.

1074
01:05:31,945 --> 01:05:34,778
BENNY: Let me look
at that beautiful smile of yours.

1075
01:05:34,865 --> 01:05:38,141
TIRA: You know about me getting married?
BENNY: Sure. Congratulations.

1076
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,374
Too late. It's all off.

1077
01:05:39,465 --> 01:05:42,502
TIRA: Sue the guy for breach of promise.
BENNY: Certainly.

1078
01:05:42,665 --> 01:05:44,940
- The lowlife.
- No, he ain't, Benny.

1079
01:05:45,425 --> 01:05:47,143
The first guy I ever really loved.

1080
01:05:47,305 --> 01:05:50,103
- I thought he loved me, too.
- What a tragedy.

1081
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:53,298
We start proceedings immediately.

1082
01:05:53,385 --> 01:05:55,296
BENNY: How much is he worth?
TIRA: Millions.

1083
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:57,899
Millions? We sue him for damages.

1084
01:05:58,185 --> 01:05:59,413
I ain't damaged.

1085
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:03,024
I just want you to sue him
for breach of promise.

1086
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:07,457
I got all the proof you want, letters, wires,
newspaper stories, even my trousseau.

1087
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:10,013
For that trousseau alone we collect plenty.

1088
01:06:10,105 --> 01:06:12,858
It's a cinch.
When do you want the case tried?

1089
01:06:13,225 --> 01:06:14,419
Let me see.

1090
01:06:14,665 --> 01:06:16,542
I go on the road with the show and...

1091
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:18,458
I'll be back in a few months.

1092
01:06:18,785 --> 01:06:21,697
- Better start then.
- Easy. Got the case.

1093
01:06:21,785 --> 01:06:25,460
Darling, you give me a few details
and I'll serve him with papers right away.

1094
01:06:25,545 --> 01:06:28,218
Okay. First, I'll tell you how I met the guy.

1095
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:32,101
But remember in anything I say
I ain't got any real animosity for him.

1096
01:06:32,185 --> 01:06:33,538
Of course.

1097
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:39,817
- If I was a home girl, I'd be heartbroken.
- Yes.

1098
01:06:43,705 --> 01:06:47,334
Miss Tira, I understand you've had
a rather colourful past.

1099
01:06:48,665 --> 01:06:52,260
I gotta admit I've been the love interest
in more than one guy's life.

1100
01:06:52,345 --> 01:06:53,539
[Jurors laughing]

1101
01:06:53,665 --> 01:06:57,101
I don't see what my past
has got to do with my present.

1102
01:06:57,425 --> 01:07:00,383
We shall show that
to the satisfaction of the court, I believe.

1103
01:07:00,945 --> 01:07:03,140
Nevertheless, the fact remains
that you've been on...

1104
01:07:03,225 --> 01:07:04,863
friendly terms with several men.

1105
01:07:05,065 --> 01:07:07,784
All right, I'm a sweetheart of Sphigma Psi,
so what?

1106
01:07:16,585 --> 01:07:18,815
You must answer questions directly, please.

1107
01:07:20,385 --> 01:07:21,784
Pardon me, Judge.

1108
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:29,300
Proceed.

1109
01:07:29,385 --> 01:07:31,421
Do you know a man named Wiley...

1110
01:07:31,665 --> 01:07:33,496
generally called Slick?

1111
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:35,621
TIRA: Yes, I know the... The gentleman.

1112
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:38,458
And you recall the man you see there?

1113
01:07:40,385 --> 01:07:43,297
If I'm not mistaken,
you mean that Dallas man.

1114
01:07:44,025 --> 01:07:47,495
BOB: And you are also acquainted,
aren't you, with Mr. Kirk Lawrence?

1115
01:07:48,425 --> 01:07:50,222
Yes, I had the pleasure.

1116
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:53,344
And no doubt you recall
those five gentlemen...

1117
01:07:53,425 --> 01:07:56,144
seated in the first row
right inside the railing?

1118
01:07:56,225 --> 01:07:59,535
<i>Mr. Blake, Mr. Larson, Mr. Willard...</i>

1119
01:08:00,425 --> 01:08:03,815
Mr. Foster, Mr. Harris.

1120
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:08,899
I do recall their faces
but them ain't the names they gave me.

1121
01:08:16,985 --> 01:08:18,338
Pardon me again, Judge.

1122
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:20,253
It's all right.

1123
01:08:20,865 --> 01:08:22,184
That's all, Miss Tira.

1124
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:25,018
JUDGE: Does the plaintiff's attorney
wish any further questions?

1125
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:27,824
I would like to request recess
for about 10 minutes.

1126
01:08:27,905 --> 01:08:30,294
JUDGE: Is that agreeable to the defence?
BOB: Perfectly.

1127
01:08:30,505 --> 01:08:32,416
This court's adjourned for 10 minutes.

1128
01:08:41,265 --> 01:08:43,495
BENNY: Why did you admit
that you knew all these men?

1129
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,974
I do know them.
You don't want me to commit perjury?

1130
01:08:46,065 --> 01:08:48,977
Yes, why didn't you tell me
there was so many men in your life?

1131
01:08:49,065 --> 01:08:50,498
Why shouldn't I know guys?

1132
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:53,019
I've been around. I travel from coast to coast.

1133
01:08:53,105 --> 01:08:57,223
A dame like me can't make trips like that
without meeting any of the male population.

1134
01:08:57,305 --> 01:09:00,695
Listen to me, Tira.
You know me, I'm a smart lawyer.

1135
01:09:00,985 --> 01:09:03,818
Give me that much loophole
and I'm through it like an eel.

1136
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:06,624
With what all those guys,
all those riffraffs, pardon me...

1137
01:09:06,705 --> 01:09:09,856
going up to the judge and telling
all they know about you and them.

1138
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,175
- It's curtains for us.
- You mean we're finished?

1139
01:09:12,265 --> 01:09:13,823
Yeah, sure, drop it.

1140
01:09:13,985 --> 01:09:15,100
You had enough publicity.

1141
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:18,814
What those guys are gonna tell the judge
won't read so nice in the newspapers.

1142
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,133
I ain't gonna drop it.

1143
01:09:20,225 --> 01:09:22,944
Listen, Benny, have I a right
to question witnesses myself?

1144
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,140
Yeah, sure but...

1145
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:26,261
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- You don't mean it.

1146
01:09:26,825 --> 01:09:30,704
Now Mr. Brown, just tell the jury
in your words, what took place.

1147
01:09:31,785 --> 01:09:34,583
I was watching her dance
and I seen her looking at me.

1148
01:09:35,065 --> 01:09:38,819
I kind of looked back
and she flirted and made a date with me.

1149
01:09:39,865 --> 01:09:42,095
So, I took her out for a ride in my car...

1150
01:09:42,225 --> 01:09:45,058
and she asked me up to her hotel room
where she was living.

1151
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:46,783
We had a couple of drinks...

1152
01:09:46,905 --> 01:09:49,658
and she put on a phonograph record
and we danced.

1153
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,055
And while we was dancing, she kissed me.

1154
01:09:55,945 --> 01:09:59,096
And how long were you
with Miss Tira in her hotel room?

1155
01:09:59,345 --> 01:10:02,781
- Close to a couple hours, I should say.
- That's all, Mr. Brown.

1156
01:10:02,905 --> 01:10:03,974
Cross-examine.

1157
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:06,775
BENNY: My client begs
the permission of the court...

1158
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:08,742
to question the defence witness herself.

1159
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:12,815
It's a little unusual,
but quite within the plaintiff's right.

1160
01:10:12,985 --> 01:10:15,863
JUDGE: She may question the witnesses.
BOB: If you please...

1161
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,220
the court should warn
the jury not to be swayed...

1162
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:20,296
by any theatricalism by the plaintiff.

1163
01:10:20,385 --> 01:10:24,219
JUDGE: The jury in weighing the evidence
will bear in mind the defence's warning.

1164
01:10:24,425 --> 01:10:25,494
<i>Proceed.</i>

1165
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:32,104
Lovely tie.

1166
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:35,464
Mr. Brown, aren't you the man
that had the five wives?

1167
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,254
Yeah.

1168
01:10:37,345 --> 01:10:40,178
And you was married to one
when you were with me, wasn't you?

1169
01:10:40,265 --> 01:10:41,983
- Yes.
- Cheating.

1170
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:44,819
You made it sound nasty
the way you spoke about us two...

1171
01:10:44,905 --> 01:10:46,657
being alone together in my place.

1172
01:10:46,745 --> 01:10:50,420
And you know nothing happened that
you couldn't tell your grandchildren about.

1173
01:10:50,505 --> 01:10:51,540
Well, I...

1174
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:54,941
In other words, it was just
a harmless little social date, wasn't it?

1175
01:10:55,145 --> 01:10:56,976
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm through with you.

1176
01:10:57,065 --> 01:10:58,054
[All laughing]

1177
01:10:58,145 --> 01:10:59,260
How am I doing?

1178
01:11:02,145 --> 01:11:03,544
Any further questions?

1179
01:11:04,985 --> 01:11:07,135
You're excused, Mr. Brown. Next witness.

1180
01:11:07,545 --> 01:11:08,614
Mr. Kirk Lawrence.

1181
01:11:08,705 --> 01:11:10,616
BAILIFF: Mr. Kirk Lawrence, take the stand.

1182
01:11:10,705 --> 01:11:12,457
OFFICER: Quiet, please.

1183
01:11:18,905 --> 01:11:21,544
BAILIFF: Do you solemnly swear
to tell the whole truth...

1184
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:23,422
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1185
01:11:23,505 --> 01:11:25,063
KIRK: I do.
BAILIFF: Take the stand.

1186
01:11:25,145 --> 01:11:27,864
BOB: Aren't you well-acquainted
with the plaintiff?

1187
01:11:27,945 --> 01:11:30,505
- Yes.
- In fact, you were intimate friends.

1188
01:11:30,985 --> 01:11:31,974
Yes.

1189
01:11:32,065 --> 01:11:35,694
Isn't it true that you once seriously
contemplated asking her to marry you?

1190
01:11:36,145 --> 01:11:37,134
Yes.

1191
01:11:37,265 --> 01:11:39,938
Now, I understand
that after knowing you only a week...

1192
01:11:40,025 --> 01:11:43,574
the plaintiff accepted several thousand
dollars worth of gifts from you.

1193
01:11:43,665 --> 01:11:45,542
Such as a diamond bracelet...

1194
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:47,695
BOB: Gowns, a fur coat...
KIRK: That's correct.

1195
01:11:47,785 --> 01:11:50,345
BOB: And almost immediately
after accepting these gifts...

1196
01:11:50,425 --> 01:11:52,734
she became engaged to Mr. Clayton,
isn't that so?

1197
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:54,294
Yes.

1198
01:11:54,385 --> 01:11:58,060
And after becoming engaged she refused
to talk to you, even on the telephone.

1199
01:11:58,225 --> 01:11:59,214
Yes.

1200
01:11:59,425 --> 01:12:01,985
Mr. Clayton has more money
than you have, hasn't he?

1201
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:03,134
That's true.

1202
01:12:03,425 --> 01:12:06,622
What construction did you place upon
this woman's treatment of you?

1203
01:12:07,065 --> 01:12:10,262
In plain words, I felt she simply
played me for a good thing.

1204
01:12:10,385 --> 01:12:11,704
BOB: Thank you, Mr. Lawrence.

1205
01:12:15,225 --> 01:12:16,340
Your witness.

1206
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:27,581
You're not looking to get
those presents back, are you, Mr. Lawrence?

1207
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:28,859
No, of course not.

1208
01:12:29,105 --> 01:12:32,381
- I don't expect you to return them, anyway.
- You're right, I wouldn't.

1209
01:12:33,705 --> 01:12:37,823
You gave me those presents
because you liked me a little, didn't you?

1210
01:12:37,905 --> 01:12:39,099
Yes.

1211
01:12:39,225 --> 01:12:40,897
I didn't ask you for them, did I?

1212
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:43,783
I don't regret giving them to you,
if that's what you mean.

1213
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:45,935
Thanks, I didn't think you did.

1214
01:12:46,065 --> 01:12:48,340
Now, you was engaged to marry a girl...

1215
01:12:48,425 --> 01:12:51,383
just at the time you started
running around with me, wasn't you?

1216
01:12:51,465 --> 01:12:52,500
Yes.

1217
01:12:52,585 --> 01:12:55,019
And you know your fiance
came up to me to see me...

1218
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:57,141
to ask me to break it off with you, don't you?

1219
01:12:57,225 --> 01:12:58,214
I heard so.

1220
01:12:58,305 --> 01:13:00,865
All right, I broke it off.
So what are you crying about?

1221
01:13:04,265 --> 01:13:07,063
Your Honour, this sort of questioning
is most irregular.

1222
01:13:07,145 --> 01:13:09,978
The plaintiff, not being
a practicing attorney...

1223
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:12,181
may put her questions as best she can.

1224
01:13:12,265 --> 01:13:13,698
Thanks, Judge, you're regular.

1225
01:13:13,785 --> 01:13:15,855
I'm doing my best to be legitimate.

1226
01:13:15,945 --> 01:13:16,980
That's all with you.

1227
01:13:20,345 --> 01:13:21,619
JUDGE: Any further questions?

1228
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:24,219
BOB: Defence is ready for the next witness.
JUDGE: Excused.

1229
01:13:24,305 --> 01:13:26,296
JUDGE: Proceed.
BOB: Miss Beulah Thorndyke.

1230
01:13:28,305 --> 01:13:31,502
They had nerve enough
to call my own maid to squeal on me?

1231
01:13:31,585 --> 01:13:33,735
BOB: You are Miss Tira's personal maid,
aren't you?

1232
01:13:33,825 --> 01:13:36,419
I was, but I ain't sure now.

1233
01:13:36,665 --> 01:13:39,941
BOB: As her personal maid, it was your duty
to answer telephone calls...

1234
01:13:40,025 --> 01:13:41,743
and admit visitors to the apartment?

1235
01:13:41,825 --> 01:13:43,463
Yes, ma'am... Yes, sir.

1236
01:13:44,065 --> 01:13:46,863
BOB: Miss Tira often had
gentlemen callers, didn't she?

1237
01:13:46,985 --> 01:13:47,974
Quite some.

1238
01:13:48,065 --> 01:13:50,898
BOB: During the time Miss Tira
and Mr. Clayton were engaged...

1239
01:13:50,985 --> 01:13:52,543
did she have other men visitors?

1240
01:13:54,345 --> 01:13:55,539
Not that I recall.

1241
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:58,141
You have a very convenient memory.

1242
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:00,023
That's all. Cross-examine.

1243
01:14:03,665 --> 01:14:06,816
TIRA: Shadow, what are you doing here?
BEULAH: I don't know.

1244
01:14:07,105 --> 01:14:09,175
They done subpoenaed me.

1245
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,613
- Beulah, tell the boys the truth.
- Yes, ma'am.

1246
01:14:12,705 --> 01:14:14,582
After Mr. Clayton and me became engaged...

1247
01:14:14,665 --> 01:14:16,815
did you ever hear me talk
about any other man...

1248
01:14:16,905 --> 01:14:18,941
or did you ever see me with any other man...

1249
01:14:19,025 --> 01:14:21,175
- outside of my manager, Mr. Barton?
- No, ma'am.

1250
01:14:21,265 --> 01:14:24,143
Did you ever hear me make any cracks
about Mr. Clayton's money?

1251
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:26,944
- No, ma'am.
- Did you hear me talk about Mr. Clayton?

1252
01:14:27,025 --> 01:14:28,174
Oh, yes, ma'am.

1253
01:14:29,185 --> 01:14:30,413
What did you hear me say?

1254
01:14:30,505 --> 01:14:32,302
- You said...
- Just a minute.

1255
01:14:35,145 --> 01:14:36,294
Tell the jury.

1256
01:14:36,385 --> 01:14:38,694
- Is that all right with you, Judge?
- Yes.

1257
01:14:39,145 --> 01:14:40,339
Proceed.

1258
01:14:40,585 --> 01:14:44,464
You said that you never knew
you could love a man like you love him.

1259
01:14:46,345 --> 01:14:47,778
I kind of forgot I said that.

1260
01:14:47,865 --> 01:14:50,982
And you said you had fallen
so hard for him that it hurt.

1261
01:14:51,065 --> 01:14:52,544
Wait a minute.

1262
01:14:53,345 --> 01:14:55,017
Answer one question at a time.

1263
01:14:55,105 --> 01:14:57,414
I just telling the truth like you told me to.

1264
01:14:57,505 --> 01:14:59,416
Yes, but you're telling too much of it.

1265
01:14:59,945 --> 01:15:02,903
I ain't never seen nobody
so brokenhearted as you was...

1266
01:15:02,985 --> 01:15:04,976
when you and Mr. Clayton done bust up.

1267
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:08,139
That's enough, Beulah.
You're ruining my character.

1268
01:15:08,665 --> 01:15:12,055
BOB: I object, Your Honour.
This witness' testimony is entirely irrelevant.

1269
01:15:12,145 --> 01:15:13,498
I move to strike it from record.

1270
01:15:13,585 --> 01:15:14,574
JUDGE: Motion denied.

1271
01:15:14,665 --> 01:15:16,223
JUDGE: Any more questions?
BOB: No.

1272
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:18,421
JUDGE: You're excused. Next witness.

1273
01:15:18,545 --> 01:15:20,297
Call Mr. Slick Wiley to the stand.

1274
01:15:20,465 --> 01:15:22,933
BAILIFF: Mr. Wiley, Mr. Slick Wiley,
please take the stand.

1275
01:15:25,745 --> 01:15:28,578
- Bob, do you have to question this man?
- Of course, Jack.

1276
01:15:28,665 --> 01:15:31,259
He'll win our case for us.
She can't laugh him off.

1277
01:15:31,345 --> 01:15:33,984
Don't mention the night
I found him at her apartment.

1278
01:15:34,065 --> 01:15:35,862
I've got to ask him about that.

1279
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:39,221
BOB: That's what I'm depending on.
JACK: I don't want you to mention it.

1280
01:15:39,305 --> 01:15:41,899
All right, I'll keep it as clean as I can.

1281
01:15:44,705 --> 01:15:47,299
When he gets through with Slick,
we haven't got a chance.

1282
01:15:47,385 --> 01:15:50,934
Mr. Wiley, you know the plaintiff,
Miss Tira, very well, do you not?

1283
01:15:51,225 --> 01:15:54,023
Sure, we've been like that.

1284
01:15:54,665 --> 01:15:56,337
During the time...

1285
01:15:56,545 --> 01:15:59,343
the plaintiff was engaged
to the defendant, Mr. Clayton...

1286
01:15:59,425 --> 01:16:00,778
were you friendly with her?

1287
01:16:01,465 --> 01:16:03,023
Never better.

1288
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:07,462
Isn't it true the plaintiff used to give you
sums of money at times for your own use?

1289
01:16:07,545 --> 01:16:11,174
Yeah, sure. She was always a good
for anywhere from $10 to a C-note.

1290
01:16:11,265 --> 01:16:12,414
Isn't it also a fact...

1291
01:16:12,505 --> 01:16:15,577
that you kept personal belongings
in the plaintiff's apartment?

1292
01:16:15,665 --> 01:16:19,578
<i>And that on at least once you were seen</i>
<i>in her apartment only partly dressed?</i>

1293
01:16:19,665 --> 01:16:21,383
SLICK: You mean in pyjamas?
BOB: Yes.

1294
01:16:21,465 --> 01:16:23,979
Yeah, I always kept two pair there.

1295
01:16:24,145 --> 01:16:25,373
Silk ones.

1296
01:16:25,465 --> 01:16:27,695
One green and one purple
with yellow stripes.

1297
01:16:27,785 --> 01:16:28,979
[All laughing]

1298
01:16:29,065 --> 01:16:30,544
[Judge knocks gavel]

1299
01:16:31,345 --> 01:16:33,779
Mr. Wiley,
did the plaintiff ever suggest to you...

1300
01:16:33,865 --> 01:16:37,096
her interest in the defendant
was principally because of his wealth?

1301
01:16:37,185 --> 01:16:38,334
Yeah, sure.

1302
01:16:38,425 --> 01:16:41,258
SLICK: She always looked to hook
some guy with a lot of dough.

1303
01:16:41,425 --> 01:16:44,064
That's all, Mr. Wiley. Cross-examine.

1304
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,420
TIRA: Where were you
on the night of June 7?

1305
01:16:53,225 --> 01:16:54,658
I don't remember.

1306
01:16:54,745 --> 01:16:59,057
All right, I'll give you a choice, where were
you any night last June, July, or August?

1307
01:17:00,145 --> 01:17:02,181
Come on, make up your mind.

1308
01:17:02,745 --> 01:17:03,814
In stir.

1309
01:17:03,905 --> 01:17:06,100
That's it, speak up so they can hear you.

1310
01:17:06,185 --> 01:17:07,459
He was in stir.

1311
01:17:07,545 --> 01:17:11,379
That means, in other words,
gentlemen of the jury, he was in jail.

1312
01:17:12,105 --> 01:17:16,098
Tell the gentlemen how many other jails
you been in the last 10 years.

1313
01:17:17,105 --> 01:17:18,697
I don't remember.

1314
01:17:19,505 --> 01:17:20,494
TIRA: He can't remember.

1315
01:17:20,585 --> 01:17:22,860
<i>And what's this</i>
<i>about you owning silk pyjamas?</i>

1316
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:24,379
<i>You know it's a lie.</i>

1317
01:17:24,585 --> 01:17:26,303
You forgot to tell these good people...

1318
01:17:26,385 --> 01:17:29,218
the only time I gave you money
was when you got out of jail...

1319
01:17:29,305 --> 01:17:31,102
you were broke, and walking on your heels.

1320
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:32,300
You heel.

1321
01:17:33,585 --> 01:17:36,053
As for you sitting in my apartment
in silk pyjamas...

1322
01:17:36,145 --> 01:17:38,454
you never sat around my apartment
in nothing.

1323
01:17:38,545 --> 01:17:39,773
And you know it.

1324
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:42,777
Answer me, did you?

1325
01:17:43,585 --> 01:17:44,938
Sure, I did.

1326
01:17:45,185 --> 01:17:47,824
- And I was seen there, too.
- Why you...

1327
01:17:48,385 --> 01:17:49,454
You perjurer.

1328
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:51,775
I object to the witness
being harassed this way.

1329
01:17:51,865 --> 01:17:53,617
Who's harassing who?

1330
01:17:54,985 --> 01:17:57,180
I'm just asking for a square deal, that's all.

1331
01:17:57,265 --> 01:17:59,984
I'm asking good, honest,
and intelligent people not to take...

1332
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:03,296
the word of an ex-convict
against a good, honest and innocent woman.

1333
01:18:03,385 --> 01:18:05,023
I object, Your Honour.

1334
01:18:05,145 --> 01:18:07,420
JUDGE: Objection overruled.
TIRA: You're right, Judge.

1335
01:18:07,505 --> 01:18:09,496
[All laughing]

1336
01:18:12,505 --> 01:18:13,654
There you are.

1337
01:18:13,745 --> 01:18:15,815
She's got the jury and the judge
under her arm.

1338
01:18:15,905 --> 01:18:17,941
They'll hand her the case on a silver platter.

1339
01:18:18,025 --> 01:18:19,902
- Don't be unfair.
- Unfair?

1340
01:18:19,985 --> 01:18:22,658
You've got so much money,
you don't mind losing this case.

1341
01:18:22,745 --> 01:18:24,622
But my reputation means something to me.

1342
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:26,935
If ever there was a case I wanted to win,
this is it.

1343
01:18:27,025 --> 01:18:29,778
I told you not to put the man on the stand
in the first place.

1344
01:18:29,865 --> 01:18:32,015
You'll have to take stand and tell your story.

1345
01:18:32,105 --> 01:18:33,857
I'll do nothing of the kind.

1346
01:18:33,945 --> 01:18:37,142
If you feel that way about it,
why did you contest the case at all?

1347
01:18:39,545 --> 01:18:41,376
I'm sorry I did.

1348
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:46,219
If any right-thinking man will believe
what a crook and a jailbird will say...

1349
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:49,422
then there's nothing I could say
that'll make any difference.

1350
01:18:49,545 --> 01:18:51,183
I'm through with this guy, Judge.

1351
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:53,616
Do you wish to question the witness further?

1352
01:18:53,705 --> 01:18:56,822
Yes. I have a few questions
I should like to ask.

1353
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:59,140
- Mr. Wiley...
- Stop. Sit down.

1354
01:19:00,465 --> 01:19:02,535
That's enough. Call it off.

1355
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:06,061
- I'll settle for the amount asked.
- You're absolutely mad.

1356
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:09,465
I don't want it to go any further,
do you understand?

1357
01:19:10,025 --> 01:19:11,743
All right, have it your own way.

1358
01:19:11,865 --> 01:19:15,221
If you want to make a fool of yourself
over this woman, I can't stop you.

1359
01:19:15,305 --> 01:19:16,579
Don't try to.

1360
01:19:17,665 --> 01:19:18,700
BOB: Your Honour...

1361
01:19:18,825 --> 01:19:21,862
my client has requested me,
for some peculiar reason of his own...

1362
01:19:21,945 --> 01:19:23,458
to cease contest of this suit.

1363
01:19:23,545 --> 01:19:26,013
He's prepared to settle
for the full amount of the case.

1364
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:28,300
JUDGE: How extraordinary.
BOB: I'll say it is.

1365
01:19:28,385 --> 01:19:31,661
- What is this, Benny?
- Don't ask me, I'm paralysed.

1366
01:19:31,825 --> 01:19:33,144
Sounds like a trick.

1367
01:19:33,225 --> 01:19:36,820
Does the plaintiff accept this motion
as satisfaction of this suit?

1368
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,021
Okay, the plaintiff accepts it with pleasure.

1369
01:19:39,105 --> 01:19:41,335
JUDGE: In view of the agreement
between the parties...

1370
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:43,780
the jury is discharged with thanks.

1371
01:19:44,465 --> 01:19:46,979
Case dismissed. Court's adjourned.

1372
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,576
JUROR 1: I'm glad you won your case,
Miss Tira.

1373
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:54,104
JUROR 2: That's our pleasure.

1374
01:19:54,945 --> 01:19:58,062
Wait a minute. Boys, now, take it easy.

1375
01:19:58,145 --> 01:20:00,784
I'll give you all the breaks in the world
but don't crowd.

1376
01:20:00,865 --> 01:20:02,059
Pictures first.

1377
01:20:03,505 --> 01:20:05,496
PHOTOGRAPHER 1: Miss Tira,
would you stand up?

1378
01:20:05,585 --> 01:20:07,303
Of course, if it'll make you happy.

1379
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:09,296
PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Look this way, please.

1380
01:20:09,385 --> 01:20:11,580
Wait a minute boys, one at a time.
I'm not twins.

1381
01:20:11,665 --> 01:20:12,859
[All laughing]

1382
01:20:12,945 --> 01:20:14,663
PHOTOGRAPHER 3: Hold that pose, please.

1383
01:20:14,785 --> 01:20:16,457
PHOTOGRAPHER 3: That's it. All right.

1384
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,137
PHOTOGRAPHER 4: Hold for me, please.

1385
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:19,578
PHOTOGRAPHER 4: Thank you.

1386
01:20:21,225 --> 01:20:23,580
- Will you answer a few questions, Miss Tira?
- Of course.

1387
01:20:23,705 --> 01:20:25,696
You've won the case.
What do you intend to do?

1388
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:27,457
Carry on the same as before.

1389
01:20:27,545 --> 01:20:30,105
Why did you admit knowing
so many men in your life?

1390
01:20:30,505 --> 01:20:33,941
It's not the men in your life that counts,
it's the life in your men.

1391
01:20:34,345 --> 01:20:36,336
REPORTER: Do you feel you've done right?

1392
01:20:36,425 --> 01:20:38,097
TIRA: Show me a woman who can do better.

1393
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:43,143
You were right, Judge.

1394
01:20:44,825 --> 01:20:47,100
- It was nice of you to come up.
- Thank you.

1395
01:20:47,185 --> 01:20:49,938
You've been charming, my dear.
Very charming.

1396
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:52,459
- I'm glad you found that out.
- Of course.

1397
01:20:52,545 --> 01:20:54,297
Well, goodbye.

1398
01:20:55,105 --> 01:20:57,221
I see you've that hand trouble, too, huh?

1399
01:20:58,705 --> 01:21:01,139
- Goodbye again.
- Goodbye.

1400
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:04,304
[Telephone ringing]

1401
01:21:07,345 --> 01:21:08,414
Hello?

1402
01:21:09,945 --> 01:21:11,742
Juror Number 4.

1403
01:21:12,425 --> 01:21:14,256
Yes, I remember you.

1404
01:21:14,465 --> 01:21:16,774
You were the one with the nice, kind face.

1405
01:21:18,345 --> 01:21:20,097
I know you were for me.

1406
01:21:24,545 --> 01:21:26,740
I wanna thank you
for those beautiful flowers.

1407
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:28,060
They were lovely.

1408
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:31,424
And don't forget,
come up and see me sometime.

1409
01:21:32,505 --> 01:21:34,416
BEULAH: Mr. Clayton, how is you?

1410
01:21:36,265 --> 01:21:37,744
Yes.

1411
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:41,543
All right, goodbye.

1412
01:21:44,705 --> 01:21:48,618
You said things in the courtroom
that led me to believe you loved me.

1413
01:21:48,785 --> 01:21:50,935
That you still love me. Did you mean them?

1414
01:21:51,425 --> 01:21:55,054
- What difference does it make now?
- All the difference in the world.

1415
01:21:55,225 --> 01:21:56,453
You didn't believe me before.

1416
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:59,582
Because I didn't understand
about Slick being up here that night.

1417
01:22:00,825 --> 01:22:02,417
So that's it.

1418
01:22:02,905 --> 01:22:06,420
I didn't understand it myself
till I found out it was all a big frame-up.

1419
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:08,097
To keep me from leaving the show.

1420
01:22:08,185 --> 01:22:10,904
Then let's forget the whole thing
and go on together.

1421
01:22:11,065 --> 01:22:13,943
- You sure you want it that way?
- You know I do.

1422
01:22:14,025 --> 01:22:15,219
Sit down.

1423
01:22:16,505 --> 01:22:18,302
You're everything to me.

1424
01:22:20,265 --> 01:22:21,698
TIRA: Beulah.
BEULAH: Yes, ma'am.

1425
01:22:21,785 --> 01:22:23,662
Bring me my jewel case.

1426
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:27,734
- You're more fascinating than ever.
- I get better as I go along.

1427
01:22:27,865 --> 01:22:29,093
BEULAH: Here, Miss Tira.

1428
01:22:29,185 --> 01:22:30,743
Got something for you.

1429
01:22:32,105 --> 01:22:34,573
I'm glad to know
it wasn't the money you wanted.

1430
01:22:34,665 --> 01:22:37,816
You got a lot of other things
it takes to make a woman happy.

1431
01:22:38,105 --> 01:22:39,697

01:22:39,785 --> 01:22:41,298
JACK: I'm crazy about you.

1433
01:22:41,385 --> 01:22:43,535
I did my best to make you that way.

1434
01:22:43,785 --> 01:22:46,458
Look, darling, you need a rest, and so do I.

1435
01:22:46,665 --> 01:22:49,975
- Let me take you away somewhere.
- Would you call that a rest?

1436
01:22:51,785 --> 01:22:54,743
- What are you thinking about?
- The same thing you are.

1437
