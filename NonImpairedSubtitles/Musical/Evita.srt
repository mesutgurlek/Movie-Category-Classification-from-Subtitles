1
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,200
It is my sad duty to inform you

2
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,600
that Eva Perón, spiritual leader
of the nation, entered immortality

3
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,500
at 8:25

4
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,700
this evening.

5
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,300
- You are not welcome here.
- He was the father of my children too.

6
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
They have a right to see him,
to pay their last respects.

7
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,900
You are not his wife.
Your children are bastards.

8
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
No, no! He's my papa!

9
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,900
Oh what a circus

10
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,500
Oh what a show

11
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Argentina has gone to town

12
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,900
Over the death of an actress

13
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
Called Eva Perón

14
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,800
We've all gone crazy

15
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Mourning all day and mourning all night

16
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,300
Falling over ourselves to get all

17
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,900
Of the misery right

18
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,600
Oh what an exit

19
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,000
That's how to go

20
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,600
When they're ringing your curtain down

21
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,700
Demand to be buried

22
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,500
Like Eva Perón

23
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,500
It's quite a sunset

24
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,800
And good for the country
ln a roundabout way

25
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,700
We've made the front page of all

26
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,500
The world's papers today

27
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,200
But who is this Santa Evita?

28
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?

29
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,600
What kind of goddess has lived among us?

30
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,700
How will we ever get by without her?

31
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,100
She had her moments
She had some style

32
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,300
The best show in town was the crowd

33
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Outside the Casa Rosada

34
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,400
Crying, "Eva Perón"

35
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,400
But that's all gone now

36
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,100
As soon as the smoke
from the funeral clears

37
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,000
We're all gonna see, and how

38
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,400
She did nothing for years

39
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,100
You let down your people, Evita

40
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,800
You were supposed to have been immortal

41
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,500
That's all they wanted

42
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,500
Not much to ask for

43
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,300
But in the end you

44
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,300
Could not deliver

45
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Sing, you fools, but you got it wrong

46
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,500
Enjoy your prayers
because you haven't got long

47
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
Your queen is dead
Your king is through

48
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,100
She's not coming back to you

49
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
Show business kept us all alive

50
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,900
Since 1 7 October 1 945

51
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,800
But the star has gone
The glamour's worn thin

52
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,500
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

53
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,200
Instead of government, we had a stage

54
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage

55
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,700
Instead of help, we were given a crowd

56
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,000
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

57
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,200
Don't cry for me, Argentina

58
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,200
For I am ordinary

59
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,600
Unimportant

60
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,100
And undeserving

61
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,800
Of such attention

62
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,600
Unless we all are

63
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,200
I think we all are

64
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,000
So share my glory

65
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,300
So share my coffin

66
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,800
It's our funeral too

67
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,200
Senor Magaldi?

68
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,900
It's seven o' clock. You'll be late.

69
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,100
Now, Eva Perón

70
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,000
Had every disadvantage

71
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,700
You need if you're going to succeed

72
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,500
No money, no cash

73
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,400
No father, no bright lights

74
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,300
There was nowhere she'd been

75
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,000
At the age of 1 5

76
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,200
As this tango singer found out

77
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,900
Agustin Magaldi

78
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,200
Who has the distinction of being the first

79
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,500
Man to be of use

80
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,200
To Eva Duarte

81
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,700
On this night of 1 000 stars

82
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Let me take you to heaven's door

83
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,000
Where the music of love's guitars

84
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,500
Plays forever more

85
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,600
In the glow of those twinkling lights

86
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,200
We shall love through eternity

87
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,600
On this night in a million nights

88
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,400
Fly away with me

89
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,100
I never dreamed that a kiss
could be as sweet as this

90
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Now I know that it can

91
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I used to wander alone
without a love of my own

92
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,200
I was a desperate man

93
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,200
But all my grief disappeared

94
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,400
And all the sorrow I'd feared
wasn't there any more

95
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:02,200
On that magical day
When you first came my way, miamor

96
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,500
To think that a man
as famous as you are

97
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,400
Could love a poor little nothing like me

98
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,500
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

99
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,600
Just listen to that

100
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,000
They're onto you, Magaldi

101
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,000
I'd get out while you can

102
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,100
It's happened at last

103
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,100
I'm starting to get started

104
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm moving out with my man

105
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,500
Now, Eva, don't get carried away

106
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,300
Monotony passed, suburbia departed

107
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,500
Who could ever be fond
of the back of beyond

108
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't hear words that I didn't say

109
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,600
What's that?

110
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,400
You desert the girl you love?

111
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,900
The girl I love?

112
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
What are you talking about?

113
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,800
She really brightened up
your out of town engagement

114
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,400
She gave you all she had
She wasn't in your contract

115
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
You must be quite relieved

116
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,100
That no one's told the papers

117
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,500
So far

118
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,200
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

119
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,700
Would I have done

120
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,600
What I did

121
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,600
If I hadn't thought

122
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,900
If I hadn't known

123
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,800
We would stay together?

124
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Seems to me there's no point in resisting

125
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,000
She's made up her mind,
you've no choice

126
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,100
Why don't you be the man
who discovered her?

127
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,100
You'll never be remembered for your voice

128
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,600
The city can be paradise

129
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,500
For those who have the cash

130
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,000
The class and the connections

131
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,400
What you need to make a splash

132
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,300
The likes of you get swept up

133
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,700
In the morning with the trash

134
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,500
If you were rich or middle class...

135
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,200
Screw the middle classes

136
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,300
I will never accept them

137
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,900
My father's other family were middle class

138
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,600
And we were kept out of sight

139
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,700
Hidden from view at his funeral

140
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,600
Do all your one night stands

141
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,500
Give you this trouble?

142
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,400
Eva, beware of the city

143
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
It's hungry and cold

144
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Can't be controlled

145
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,700
It is mad

146
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,900
Those who are fools
are swallowed up whole

147
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,200
And those who are not become

148
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
What they should not become

149
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,500
Changed, in short they go bad

150
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,400
Bad is good for me

151
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,400
I'm bored, so clean and so ignored

152
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,200
I've only been predictable, respectable

153
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,500
Birds fly out of here
So why, oh why, oh why the hell can't l?

154
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,600
I only want variety of society

155
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,100
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

156
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,400
Five years from now I shall come back

157
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,800
And finally say
You have your way

158
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,400
Come to town

159
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,400
But you'll look at me
with a foreigner's eyes

160
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,300
The magical city

161
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,300
A younger girl's city

162
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,200
A fantasy long since put down

163
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
All you've done to me
Was that a young girl's fantasy?

164
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
I played your city games all right, didn't l?

165
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,800
I already know what cooks

166
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,500
How the dirty city feels and looks

167
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,500
I tasted it last night, didn't l?

168
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,800
Eva, beware your ambition

169
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,900
It's hungry and cold

170
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,100
Can't be controlled, will run wild

171
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,700
This in a man is danger enough

172
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,800
But you are a woman

173
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,700
Not even a woman

174
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,500
Not very much more than a child

175
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,800
And whatever you say
I'll not steal you away

176
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,800
What's new, Buenos Aires?

177
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,400
I'm new
I want to say I'm just a little stuck on you

178
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,100
You'll be on me too

179
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,400
I get out here, Buenos Aires

180
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,300
Stand back

181
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,300
You oughta know
What you're gonna get in me

182
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,900
Just a little touch of star quality

183
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,300
Fill me up with your heat
With your noise, with your dirt, overdo me

184
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,600
Let me dance to your beat
Make it loud, let it hurt, run it through me

185
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,300
Don't hold back
You are certain to impress

186
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,900
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying

187
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,500
Get this! Just look at me
Dressed up somewhere to go

188
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,700
We'll put on a show

189
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,500
Take me in at your flood, give me speed
Give me lights, set me humming

190
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,600
Shoot me up with your blood
Wine me up with your nights

191
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,900
Watch me coming

192
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,500
All I want is a whole lot of excess

193
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,600
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing

194
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,300
Stand back, Buenos Aires

195
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,700
Because you oughta know
What you're gonna get in me

196
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,400
Just a little touch of star quality

197
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,800
And

198
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,600
If ever I go to far

199
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,900
It's because of the things you are

200
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,700
Beautiful town

201
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,900
I love you

202
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And

203
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,300
If I need a moment's rest

204
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,100
Give your lover the very best

205
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,900
Real eiderdown

206
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,000
And silence

207
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,000
You're a tramp, you're a treat
You will shine to the death

208
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,400
You are shoddy

209
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,700
But you're flesh, you are meat
You shall have every breath in my body

210
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,500
Put me down for a lifetime of success

211
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,200
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying

212
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,900
Rio de la Plata

213
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,200
Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio

214
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,500
All I want to know

215
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,600
I don't expect my love affairs

216
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,500
To last for long

217
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,900
Never fool myself

218
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,900
That my dreams will come true

219
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,100
Being used to trouble

220
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,400
I anticipate it

221
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,700
But all the same I hate it

222
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,100
Wouldn't you?

223
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,100
So what happens now?

224
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,800
Another suitcase in another hall

225
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,300
Take your picture off another wall

226
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,800
- Where am I going to?
- You'll get by, you always have before

227
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,500
Time and time again

228
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,300
I've said that

229
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,300
I don't care

230
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,400
That I'm immune to gloom

231
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,000
That I'm hard through and through

232
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,000
But every time it matters

233
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,500
All my words desert me

234
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,900
So anyone can hurt me

235
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,100
And they do

236
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,800
So what happens now?

237
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,300
Another suitcase in another hall

238
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,900
Take your picture off another wall

239
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,100
You'll get by you always have before

240
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Where am I going to?

241
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,500
Call in three months time

242
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,200
And I'll be fine

243
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,100
I know

244
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,400
Well, maybe not that fine

245
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,300
But I'll survive anyhow

246
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,700
I won't recall the names and places

247
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,200
Of each sad occasion

248
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,200
But that's no consolation

249
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,700
Here and now

250
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,700
Where am I going to?

251
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,500
Don't ask any more

252
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,600
Good night and thank you, whoever

253
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,000
She's in every magazine
Been photographed, seen

254
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,900
She is known

255
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,100
We don't like to rush
but your case has been packed

256
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,200
If she's missed anything
you could give her a ring

257
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,800
But she won't always answer the phone

258
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,800
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies

259
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,300
But we have pretended enough

260
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,500
It's best that we both
stop fooling ourselves

261
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,900
Which means...!

262
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,800
There is no one, no one at all

263
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:39,200
Never has been and never will be a lover,
male or female

264
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,300
Who hasn't an eye on

265
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,800
In fact they rely on tricks
they can try on their partner

266
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,500
They're hoping their lover
will help them or keep them

267
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,100
Support them, promote them

268
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,700
Don't blame them
You're the same

269
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,700
Good night and thank you, Emilio

270
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,300
You've completed your task

271
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,000
What more can we ask of you now?

272
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,100
Please sign the book
on the way out the door

273
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,300
And that will be all
lf she needs you, she'll call

274
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,500
But I don't think that's likely somehow

275
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,300
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies

276
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,600
But when we were hot
we were hot

277
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,500
I know you'll look back
on the good times we shared

278
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,000
Which means...!

279
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,400
There is no one, no one at all

280
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,300
Never has been
and never will be a lover

281
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,400
Male or female

282
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,300
Who hasn't an eye on
ln fact they rely on

283
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,000
Tricks they can try on their partner

284
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,300
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them

285
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,900
Support them, promote them

286
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,600
Don't blame her
You're the same

287
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,400
There is no soap
No soap like Zaz

288
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,500
No detergent, lotion or oil
With such power

289
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,000
In the shower

290
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,800
It's the mother and father

291
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,800
Of luxury lather

292
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,900
The talk of the bath
The great ointment

293
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,700
One little frolic
With new Zaz carbolic

294
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,000
You're scented

295
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,700
You'll be sent

296
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,700
Good night and thank you, Senor Jabón

297
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,600
We are grateful

298
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,800
You found her a spot on the sound radio

299
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,300
We'll think of you
every time she's on the air

300
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,500
We'd love you to stay
but you'd be in the way

301
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,800
So do up your trousers and go

302
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,500
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies

303
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,600
The decline into silence and doubt

304
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,000
Our passion was just too intense to survive

305
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,300
Which means...!

306
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,200
This is a club I should never have joined

307
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,300
Someone has made us look fools

308
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,700
Argentine men call the sexual shots

309
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,600
Someone has altered the rules

310
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,500
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes

311
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,800
Is all very well, but every girl knows

312
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,000
She needs a man she can monopolise

313
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,400
With fingers in dozens of different pies

314
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,400
In June of '43

315
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,500
There was a military coup

316
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,400
Behind it was a gang called

317
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,900
The G.O.U.

318
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Who did not feel

319
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,200
The need to be elected

320
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,200
They had themselves a party
at the point of a gun

321
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,700
They were slightly to the right
of Attila the Hun

322
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,800
A bomb or two
And very few objected

323
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,500
Just one shell

324
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,500
And governments fall like flies

325
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,900
Ka-pow, die
They stumble and fall

326
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Bye-bye
Backs to the wall

327
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,500
Aim high
We're having a ball

328
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,200
The tank and bullet ruled
As democracy died

329
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,800
The lady's got potential
She was setting her sights

330
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,400
On making it in movies
with her name in lights

331
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,500
The greatest social climber
since Cinderella

332
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,500
OK, she couldn't act
But she had the right friends

333
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
And we all know
a career depends

334
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,000
On knowing the right fella

335
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,100
To be stellar

336
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,300
Just one shell
And governments lose their nerve

337
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:04,300
That's how we get
The government we deserve

338
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,500
Now, the man behind the president
calling the shots

339
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,400
Involved so discreetly
in a lot of their plots

340
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,700
Was Colonel Juan Perón

341
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,000
Would-be dictator

342
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,400
He began in the army out in ltaly so

343
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,200
Saw Mussolini's rise
from the very front row

344
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,800
And reckoned he'd do likewise

345
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Sooner or later

346
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,500
Just one blast
And the tear gas falls like rain

347
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,100
They haven't a chance

348
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,700
The terrorists advance

349
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,900
But one guy doesn't dirty his hands

350
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,700
Perón was biding time out

351
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,400
In the slow lane

352
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,900
Suddenly an earthquake hit

353
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,600
The town of San Juan

354
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,400
They stumble and fall

355
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,800
Keep away from the wall

356
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,400
But one guy

357
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,200
Was having a ball

358
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,000
The tragedy a golden chance for Perón

359
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,800
He organised a concert
With incredible flair

360
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,800
In aid of all the victims
Such a grand affair

361
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,900
Politicians, actors
Stars of every flavour

362
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,000
It was January 22, 1 944

363
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,500
A night to remember, that's for sure

364
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,700
For that's the night
That Perón first met Eva

365
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,900
On this night

366
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,100
On this night

367
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,800
On this night of 1 000 stars

368
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,400
Let me take you to heaven's door

369
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,100
Where the music of love's guitars

370
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,500
Plays for evermore

371
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,500
Your act hasn't changed much

372
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,500
Neither has yours

373
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,200
I stand here
as a servant of the people

374
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,400
As we come together
for a marvellous cause

375
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,700
You've shown by your presence

376
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,500
Your deeds and applause

377
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,000
What the people can do

378
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,400
True power is yours
Not the government's

379
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,500
Unless it represents

380
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
The people

381
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,800
One always picks

382
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,700
The easy fight

383
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,400
One praises fools

384
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,600
One smothers light

385
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,000
One shifts

386
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,800
From left to right

387
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,900
Politics

388
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,500
The art of the possible

389
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,200
I've heard so much about you

390
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,300
I'm amazed

391
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,400
- For I'm only an actress
- For I'm only a soldier

392
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,500
- Nothing to shout about
- One of the thousands

393
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,400
- Only a girl on the air
- Defending the country he loves

394
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,500
But when you act

395
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,800
The things you do affect us all

396
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,500
But when you act

397
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:21,100
You take us away
from the squalor of the real world

398
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,300
- Are you here on your own?
- Yes. Oh yes

399
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,600
So am I

400
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,500
What a fortunate coincidence

401
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,900
Maybe you're my reward

402
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,000
For my efforts here tonight

403
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,700
It seems crazy

404
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,800
But you must believe

405
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,300
There's nothing calculated

406
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,900
Nothing planned

407
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,600
Please forgive me

408
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,600
If I seem naive

409
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,600
I would never want to force your hand

410
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,900
But please understand I'd be good for you

411
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,500
I don't always rush in like this

412
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,400
20 seconds after saying hello

413
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:20,100
Telling strangers I'm too good to miss

414
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,000
If I'm wrong I hope you'll tell me so

415
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,100
But you really should know
I'd be good for you

416
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,800
I'd be surprisingly good for you

417
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,500
I won't go on if I'm boring you

418
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,700
But do you understand my point of view

419
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,100
Do you like what you hear
What you see

420
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,400
And would you be

421
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,600
Good for me too?

422
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,400
I'm not talking of a hurried night

423
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:14,500
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye

424
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,000
Creeping home before it gets too light

425
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,300
That's not the reason
that I caught your eye

426
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:28,700
Which has to imply I'd be good for you

427
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,600
Please go on. You enthral me

428
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,100
I can understand you perfectly

429
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,200
And I like what I hear, what I see

430
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,000
And knowing me

431
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:21,300
I would be good for you too

432
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,200
I'm not talking

433
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,900
Of a hurried night

434
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,800
A frantic tumble

435
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,700
Then a shy goodbye

436
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,400
Creeping home before it gets too light

437
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,600
That's not the reason
That I caught your eye

438
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,600
Which has to imply I'd be good for you

439
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,500
There is no one, no one at all

440
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,000
Never has been, and never will be a lover

441
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,000
Male or female

442
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,300
Who hasn't an eye on
ln fact they rely on

443
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
Tricks they can try on their partner

444
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,800
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them

445
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,100
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them, you're the same

446
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,300
Hello and goodbye

447
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,100
I've just unemployed you

448
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,900
You can go back to school

449
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,700
You've had a good run

450
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,100
I'm sure he enjoyed you

451
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,600
Don't act sad or surprised
Let's be friends, civilised

452
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,000
Come on, little one
Don't sit there like a dummy

453
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,500
The day you knew would arrive is here

454
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,200
You'll survive

455
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,900
So move, funny face

456
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,800
I like your conversation

457
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,700
You've a catchy turn of phrase

458
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:45,600
You're obviously going through
Some adolescent phase

459
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,400
So what happens now?

460
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,700
Where am I going to?

461
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,400
You'll get by, you always have before

462
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,400
Don't ask any more

463
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,700
At the watering-holes

464
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,000
Of the well-to-do

465
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,000
I detect a resistance to

466
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,200
Precisely

467
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,300
Our heroine's style

468
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,600
We're glad you noticed

469
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,600
The shooting sticks

470
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,600
Of the upper class

471
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,900
Give her an inch...

472
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,000
Aren't supporting a single ass

473
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,500
That would rise for the girl

474
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,300
...She'll take a mile

475
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,000
Such a shame she wandered

476
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,900
Into our enclosure

477
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,000
How unfortunate this person

478
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,800
Has forced us to be blunt

479
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,200
No, we wouldn't mind

480
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,700
Seeing her at Harrods

481
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,700
But behind the jewellery counter

482
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,400
Not in front

483
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,200
Could there be

484
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,700
In our fighting corps

485
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,300
A lack of enthusiasm for

486
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Perón's latest flame?

487
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,900
You said it, brother

488
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,700
Should you wish

489
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,900
To cause great distress

490
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,700
In the tidiest officer's mess

491
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,100
Just mention her name

492
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,000
That isn't funny

493
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,700
Perón is a fool, breaking every taboo

494
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,200
Installing the girl in the army H.Q.

495
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,900
And she's an actress, the last straw

496
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,700
Her only good parts
Are between her thighs

497
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,200
She should stare at the ceiling
Not reach for the skies

498
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,200
Or she could be his last whore

499
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,900
The evidence suggests

500
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,300
She has other interests

501
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,900
If it's her that's using him

502
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,500
He's exceptionally dim

503
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,900
Dangerous Jade

504
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,300
We have allowed ourselves to slip

505
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,900
We have completely lost our grip

506
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,100
We have declined to an all-time low

507
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,000
Tarts have become the set to know

508
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,600
I'm only a radio star
with just one weekly show

509
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,600
But speaking as one of the people

510
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,200
I want you to know

511
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,300
We are tired of

512
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,000
The decline of Argentina

513
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,700
With no sign of

514
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,000
A government
able to give us the things we deserve

515
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,000
It's no crime for officers
to do as they please

516
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,600
As long as they're discreet
and keep clear of disease

517
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,500
We ignore, we disregard

518
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,000
But once they allow a bit on the side

519
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,500
To move to the centre
where she's not qualified

520
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,300
We are forced to mark his card

521
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,200
She should get into her head

522
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,500
She should not get out of bed

523
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,800
She should know that she's not paid

524
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,500
To be loud, but to be laid

525
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,700
Slut

526
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,900
Dangerous Jade

527
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,700
This has really been your year
Miss Duarte

528
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,900
Tell us where you go from here
Miss Duarte

529
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,900
Which are the roles that you yearn to play?

530
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,000
Whom did you sleep...dine with
yesterday?

531
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,300
Acting is limiting
The lines not mine

532
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,600
That's no help to the Argentine

533
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,700
Can we assume then that you'll quit?

534
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,900
Is this because of your involvement

535
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,900
With Colonel Perón?

536
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,600
She won't be kept happy
by her nights on the tiles

537
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,400
She says it's his body

538
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,100
But she's after his files

539
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,600
So get back onto the street

540
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,600
She should get into her head

541
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,500
She should not get out of bed

542
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,000
She should know that she's not paid

543
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,000
To be loud, but to be laid

544
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,000
The evidence suggests

545
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,400
She has other interests

546
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,000
If it's her that's using him

547
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,800
He's exceptionally dim

548
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,300
Things have reached a pretty pass

549
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,400
When someone pretty lower class

550
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,100
Graceless and vulgar, uninspired

551
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,000
Can be accepted and admired

552
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,500
Dice are rolling
The knives are out

553
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,600
Would-be presidents are all around

554
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:40,300
I don't say they mean harm
But they'd each give an arm

555
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,500
To see us six feet underground

556
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,400
It doesn't matter

557
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,500
What those morons say

558
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,800
Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew

559
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:01,400
There's only 20 of them anyway

560
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,400
What is 20 next to millions who

561
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,300
Are looking to you?

562
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,000
All you have to do is sit and wait

563
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,400
Keeping out of everybody's way

564
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,500
We'll... You'll be handed power

565
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,600
On a plate

566
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,100
When the ones who matter
Have their say

567
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,600
And with chaos installed

568
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,200
You can reluctantly agree

569
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,100
To be called

570
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,200
There again we could be foolish

571
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,500
Not to quit while we're ahead

572
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,000
For distance lends enchantment

573
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,100
And that is why

574
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,900
All exiles

575
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,200
Are distinguished

576
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,900
More important, they're not dead

577
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,500
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay

578
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,600
This is crazy defeatist talk

579
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,200
Why commit political suicide

580
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,200
There's no risk
There's no call for any action at all

581
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,300
When you have unions on your side

582
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,300
A new Argentina

583
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,100
The chains of the masses untied

584
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,700
The voice of the people

585
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,800
Cannot be denied

586
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,900
There is only one man
who can lead any workers' regime

587
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:47,000
He lives for your problems
He shares your ideals and your dream

588
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,400
He supports you, for he loves you

589
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,800
Understands you, is one of you

590
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,200
If not

591
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,800
How could he love me?

592
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,100
A new Argentina

593
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:10,000
The workers' battle song

594
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,400
The voice of the people

595
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:23,400
Rings out loud and long

596
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,400
Now, I am a worker

597
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,800
I've suffered the way that you do

598
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:35,500
I've been unemployed
And I've starved, and I've hated it too

599
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,800
But I found my salvation in Perón

600
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,300
May the nation let him save them

601
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,800
As he saved me

602
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,600
A new age about to begin

603
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,300
We face the world together

604
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:09,500
And no dissent within

605
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,500
There again we could be foolish

606
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,600
Not to quit while we're ahead

607
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,900
I can see us many miles away, inactive

608
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,800
Sipping cocktails on a terrace

609
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,800
Taking breakfast in bed

610
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,100
Sleeping easy, doing nothing

611
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,100
It's attractive

612
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,800
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too

613
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,300
They always take some swallowing

614
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,100
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep
Momentum, if it's you that you are following

615
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,900
Don't close doors
Keep an escape clause

616
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,400
Because we might lose

617
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,800
The Big Apple

618
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,000
But would I have done what I did

619
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,500
If I hadn't thought

620
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,200
If I hadn't known

621
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,500
We would take the country?

622
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,100
Perón has resigned from the army
and this we avow

623
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:36,100
The descamisados are those
he is marching with now

624
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,900
He supports you, for he loves you

625
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,500
Understands you, is one of you

626
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,500
If not

627
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,500
How could he love me?

628
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,300
Release him.

629
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,300
How annoying
that they have to fight elections

630
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,000
For their cause

631
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,400
The inconvenience

632
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,100
Having to get a majority

633
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,000
If normal methods of persuasion

634
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,300
Fail to win them applause

635
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:55,800
There are other ways
of establishing authority
