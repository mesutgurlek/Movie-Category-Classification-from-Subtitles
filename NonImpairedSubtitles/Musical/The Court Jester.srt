1
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:17,705
This is the story of how the destiny
of a nation was changed by a birthmark.

2
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,387
A royal birthmark on the royal
posterior of a royal infant child.

3
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:27,384
Here returning to his castle is King Roderick.

4
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,582
Roderick the tyrant, who some
months before seized the throne

5
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,587
by a massacre of the entire royal family.

6
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:40,431
But uneasy lies Roderick's crown,
for rumor hath it that an infant,

7
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:43,147
the rightful heir to the thrown
had survived the massacre.

8
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:47,908
And even now is being cared
for by a group in the forest.

9
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:52,510
A group led by an elusive dashing
outlaw known only as..

10
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,973
the Black Fox!

11
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:10,022
The child lives! Death to
the tyrant! The Black Fox.

12
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:12,663
The Black Fox again!
To the castle, quick!

13
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:28,038
My kingdom seething with revolt,
cutthroats and assassins in every tree!

14
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,684
Why must I be surrounded by fools?
Ravenhurst! Ravenhurst!

15
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:33,785
Sire!

16
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:36,814
Could you have been so
incompetent, bungled so horribly,

17
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,463
as to have permitted
that child to live?

18
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,910
Sire, there is no child.

19
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:42,968
My men assure me that none
of the royal family escaped alive.

20
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,872
Believe me, sire,
this is nonsense.

21
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:47,616
Nonsense? You call it nonsense, Ravenhurst!

22
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:50,203
Is it nonsense that I cannot
ride my own domain,

23
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:52,412
without being
murderously attacked.

24
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:55,143
My child, I came
within an inch of my life.

25
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:56,719
Oh, father.

26
00:04:57,303 --> 00:05:01,046
Each day, some new insurrection.
Who is this Black Fox?

27
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:04,350
Oh just some ridiculous adventurer
with a handful of rabble.

28
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:06,111
Rabble today but
an army tomorrow!

29
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:08,100
We need help to wipe
them out. Men and arms!

30
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:10,648
Aye, an alliance with our good
friend Griswold of the North!

31
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:14,320
Aye, alliance, and quickly! He arrives
tomorrow for the great tournament.

32
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,414
Alliance with Griswold...

33
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,158
Sire, this rabble
can be crushed.

34
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:19,234
Griswold has men and arms.

35
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,550
We need no uncouth
interloper from the north.

36
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:24,543
Uncouth, yes, but
Griswold is strong.

37
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,008
Perhaps too strong.

38
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,615
Perhaps our friend
Ravenhurst fears an alliance

39
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:31,333
would put Griswold and not
himself at the king's right hand!

40
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:32,551
You shall die for this!

41
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:33,898
One of us will!

42
00:05:34,142 --> 00:05:37,058
Stop! Stop! Stop, I say!

43
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:39,465
Put up your
sword, you fool.

44
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,979
Sire! -Silence!  -But sire! -Silence!
-Your pardon, sire.

45
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:48,154
And you, too. Must we
quarrel amongst ourselves?

46
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:50,678
Do you think I
could make alliance?

47
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:54,553
Griswold is rich.
What could I offer him?

48
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:58,219
That which he desires most
in the world. Marriage, sire.

49
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,276
With your daughter,
the fair Gwendolyn.

50
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:03,183
Marriage with
Griswold? Never!

51
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:04,539
What's that you say?

52
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,046
He's a brute and a lout!

53
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,830
Brute or not, lout or not, if I
so decide, you'll marry Griswold.

54
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:11,025
I will not.

55
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:14,639
I am the king. If it pleases me,
you will marry Griswold.

56
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:17,950
If it pleases you so much,
you marry Griswold.

57
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,690
When I marry,
I marry for love.

58
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,854
Someone dashing
and romantic,

59
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,053
who will carry me off as a
princess should be carried off!

60
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:27,801
Who fills your head with
this childish fiddle faddle.

61
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:30,814
Ah, I know... Griselda.

62
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,903
She of the evil eye. Take
the witch out and burn her!

63
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:39,643
Harm one hair of her head and I
throw myself from the highest turret.

64
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:40,980
Gwendolyn, you go too far!

65
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:49,879
Dire news, sire! I've just come
from the forest. The child lives!

66
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,611
The child lives?!

67
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,266
Aye, sire.

68
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:58,226
How know you that this is the royal
child and not some outrageous impostor?

69
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:01,347
Because sire, disguised as a
member of their group, I saw him.

70
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:03,737
And I can assure you that
like his royal ancestors,

71
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:06,807
and on the same spot
as his royal ancestors,

72
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,223
he bears the royal birthmark.

73
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:13,141
The... purple pimpernel?

74
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,041
The purple pimpernel.

75
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:21,738
Oh... Then why stand you here,
you incompetent Jackalings?

76
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,339
To  horse! To the forest!

77
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:24,808
Cut them down!

78
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:28,597
Kill the infamous child who
claims to be the rightful king.

79
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:34,888
And destroy forever this traitorous
fiend who calls himself the Black Fox!

80
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:28,750
Hawkins! Hawkins! Come here!

81
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,637
Hawkins, you hurted yourself ?

82
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:36,392
Are you all right, Hawkins?

83
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,533
Come here!

84
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,391
Sir.

85
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:43,810
Hawkins, how many times have
I told you to stay out of my clothes?

86
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,001
And who are
these little people?

87
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,647
Oh, these are
my friends, sir.

88
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:48,281
They used to work
with me at the carnival.

89
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:51,383
They're the finest troupe of
acrobats and tumblers in all of England.

90
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:53,012
But why did you
bring them here?

91
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:55,277
Well they too would be
part of our group, sir.

92
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,039
They feel strongly as we
do about the tyranny,

93
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,357
and would join in
our worthy cause.

94
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:07,010
Sir.

95
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:08,161
Well, captain?

96
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:09,700
The new recruits
are arriving, sir.

97
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,312
Good. Hawkins,

98
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:13,652
I don't mean to be disparaging
to your little friends,

99
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:14,661
but weapons
are limited and...

100
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:17,207
Oh oh, I didn't intend
for them to fight, sir, I..

101
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:20,576
I merely thought that they would take
over my chores of entertaining the men.

102
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:24,100
Then perhaps I'd be free
to bear arms myself,sir,

103
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:25,872
and come to grips
with the enemy.

104
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:30,998
Face to face and steel to
steel. Fist to fist, sir.

105
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,367
Hmph.

106
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:35,516
Little friends, I'm sorry,

107
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,406
but food and weapons are
limited so you see, uh...

108
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:40,902
We'll do anything for Hawkins,
sir. He always was our friend.

109
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:42,930
I'm sorry, there's no
time to discuss it.

110
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:45,010
Please go quickly
and without detection.

111
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:47,542
Well, if you ever
need us, call us!

112
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,696
Thank you, I shall.

113
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:50,301
Bye Hawkins!

114
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:54,081
Hawkins! The recruits will be
here in a moment. Get the child.

115
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,491
Child... er...

116
00:11:56,536 --> 00:11:58,243
I hate to keep
mentioning this, sir...

117
00:11:58,278 --> 00:11:59,779
Just get the child!

118
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,999
Well, sir, you know I'd do
anything for his majesty, but,

119
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,580
don't you think it look
better if a woman were...

120
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:06,519
Tend to your duty!
And get out of my clothes!

121
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:07,762
Yes sir.

122
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:27,382
Majesty!

123
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,572
Your majesty.

124
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,487
Your majesty.

125
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,517
Your majesty.

126
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:39,755
Sir.

127
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,473
Don't you think it
really would, look better

128
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,006
if this kind of thing
were done by a woman?

129
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:47,834
I've told you repeatedly, Hawkins.
Each one serves as best he can.

130
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,977
I know, sir, but when I ran away from
the carnival, sir, and joined your group,

131
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,941
I thought I'd be in the thick of it.
Robbing the rich and giving to the poor.

132
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,391
Sir!

133
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:01,754
Our presence is known.
The king's men are on their way!

134
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,795
We must disperse!
Maid Jean. - Yes, sir.

135
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:06,596
You will see that the child is
transported to the abbey in Dover.

136
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,519
The usual method?

137
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:08,542
- The usual method.

138
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,406
Come, Hawkins.
- Yes, captain.

139
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,686
The rest of you disperse!

140
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:14,592
Hawkins, hurry!

141
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:16,845
I'm putting the last
touches on, right now.

142
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,542
Don't just stand there,
man! Make haste!

143
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:21,070
There.

144
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:26,423
Why do you stare?

145
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:30,580
I... Beg pardon,
captain, but, I'm...

146
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:33,794
I'm sorry, captain, but
I didn't mean to stare.

147
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,289
Each time I see
you as a woman, sir,

148
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:38,761
I mean with your
flowing hair...

149
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:41,287
Conceal the child! Quickly!

150
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,416
Yes, captain.

151
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:07,007
The king's men.

152
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:09,930
You know what
to do, Hawkins.

153
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,636
Yes, captain. I'll try.

154
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:16,178
Ho there! Hold I say!

155
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:21,812
Come down old man, we would
talk to you. You too, wench.

156
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:22,715
What's that?

157
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:24,980
Hurry along, this
is king's business!

158
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,516
What's the meaning of this?
- Come on!

159
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:32,941
W...what's the meaning of this?
What do you want of us?

160
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,688
Where go you, ancient one?
Who are you?

161
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:37,208
- What's that?
- Who are you?

162
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,000
What's... what's that?
- Who ARE YOU?

163
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:41,025
Fine, thank you.
- No! No, no. WHO?

164
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,063
Who! -Who, -who. -Who. -who.

165
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,729
I am Foltzingdale
uh the wine merchant,

166
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:50,658
and this is my
little granddaughter.

167
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:52,307
Uh poor child,
she's a mute,

168
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:56,138
she neither speaks nor hears
except through my fingers.

169
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:59,674
Child, the... No,
no, here child,

170
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,054
these, these are the king's
men. Men of the king!

171
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:09,860
Eh.. she says long live
the king and down with his..

172
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,619
long live the kind
and down with his..

173
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,837
Long..

174
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,609
little harder, dear.

175
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:23,657
long live the king
and down with his..

176
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:29,646
not quite so hard... long live the
king and down with his enemies.

177
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:30,725
Enough!

178
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:32,786
Have you seen a group
in the forest with a child?

179
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,583
Uh what's that? What? What?
- A child! A child!

180
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,881
A child. Child. Oh! Lovely child,
pretty little creature, isn't it?

181
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,879
But you stay
away from her!

182
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:43,579
No, no no no, a child! So big!
Uh with a little mark on...

183
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,638
You do and I'll break
every bone in your body!

184
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,566
Ask the... Ask the girl if she's
seen a group in the forest.

185
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:53,600
Uh what's that? what?

186
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,714
Ask the girl if she's seen
a group in the forest.

187
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,387
Eh why didn't I what?

188
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:59,607
Ask the girl if she's seen
a group in the forest!

189
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:02,840
No need to holler, sir,
I hear very well indeed!

190
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:04,704
Well ask her!
- Ask her what?

191
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,140
If she's seen a
group in the forest?

192
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,666
Uh y-yes... child, have you
seen a group in the forest?

193
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,306
Eh she says no.

194
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,295
What took her so long?

195
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:26,423
Stutters.

196
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:29,936
Tah, we waste time with these dolts.
On your way. Off with you!

197
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,537
Oh, he's quite all right.

198
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:57,824
You were excellent,
Hawkins.

199
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:02,800
You too, captain. We played our
parts extremely well, I thought.

200
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:07,533
You know, we should spend a lot more
time together. Uh, for rehearsal, I mean.

201
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:13,206
There's a storm brewing. We'll
spend the night in the woodman's hut.

202
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:14,791
Yes, captain.

203
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:32,917
I'll take you dreaming
through the rainy night

204
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:43,409
to a place behind the raindrops
where the stars are bright.

205
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:52,010
you may not find gold or
silver but a richer prize

206
00:17:57,927 --> 00:18:02,692
waits for you behind the
raindrops if you'll close your eyes.

207
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:14,992
tonight, tonight when
all the world's asleep.

208
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:24,585
we will tip toe home with a wondrous
star, a star you can always keep.

209
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,649
and years from now when you
go dreaming when you're very old,

210
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:49,078
though your crown be rich with
rubies, diamonds set in gold.

211
00:18:55,445 --> 00:19:00,926
none will shine as bright
as the star we'll find

212
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,028
tonight.

213
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:42,349
tonight, tonight when
all the world's asleep,

214
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:52,919
we will find a star that
you can always keep.

215
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:09,453
His majesty's asleep, now.

216
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:13,214
You better get some sleep, too.

217
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:15,905
Over there.

218
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,692
Uh, there's only room for one...
I... I think you'd better take it.

219
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,057
We can both lie there.

220
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:27,891
If you get wet and ill, you'll be
no use to his majesty at all.

221
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,333
Lie down.

222
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:33,768
Yes, captain.

223
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,262
Wet.

224
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,444
Very.

225
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:57,145
There'd be more room if
you raised your arm.

226
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,277
The other one.

227
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:03,750
Sorry.

228
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:13,946
Hawkins.

229
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:15,534
Yes, captain.

230
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,936
I'm sorry I... I spoke
in the manner I did.

231
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:23,431
I was wrong.

232
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:25,639
Y-yes, captain?

233
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:28,292
There's something
else I'd like to say.

234
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:30,477
Yes?

235
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:33,750
I am a woman.

236
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:37,007
And I do have feelings.

237
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:42,685
I... I find it hard
to believe that..

238
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:47,580
the captain could ever be fond
of a man who isn't a fighter.

239
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:58,042
Sometimes tenderness and
kindness can also make a man.

240
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,660
A very rare man.

241
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,351
Could the captain...

242
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:12,986
Could the captain ever entertain
thoughts of marriage with such a man?

243
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,541
Yes, Hawkins.

244
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:23,127
I think she could, and would.

245
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:28,432
If things were different.

246
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:31,823
How di-different?

247
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,479
The infant on the throne and...
Our fight for freedom won.

248
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:44,226
Why does such a little girl
have to do such a big job?

249
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,303
It's the way I
was brought up.

250
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:53,819
My father's influence. You see,
my father made me everything I am.

251
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:56,644
He does beautiful work.

252
00:22:58,562 --> 00:23:02,928
He taught me how to love
freedom and hate injustice.

253
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:09,722
The use of weapons
and how to fight.

254
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:14,693
In fact, I think he...

255
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:18,273
he really wanted
me to be a boy.

256
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,677
Too bad. You'd've made
a wonderful girl.

257
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:33,599
No! We daren't think of
ourselves until our fight is won.

258
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:35,535
Yes, but that could take
twenty years or more.

259
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:39,153
Or twenty hours. If only we could
put our plan into operation.

260
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:40,660
Plan? Do we
have a p-plan?

261
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:44,413
A handful of men could overthrow
the castle in a matter of hours.

262
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,277
Yes.

263
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:48,459
You see, there's a secret
passage that starts in the forest,

264
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:51,090
and tunnels underneath
the walls of the castle.

265
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:52,045
Secret passage.

266
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,338
But it's locked at both ends and
the key is in the king's possession.

267
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:56,691
The king's possession, yeah.

268
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:59,759
If only we could have
someone inside the castle;

269
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:03,110
an intimate of the king,
with access to his chambers.

270
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,865
Mm-hmm, with access to his
chambers. But, but that's impossible.

271
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,671
Ah, good evening! A thousand
apologies for this uh intrusion,

272
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:20,868
but may I beg shelter and warmth
from this miserable storm?

273
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,168
Who are you?

274
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:25,862
A stranger in this land,
young woman, but not for long.

275
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:29,604
I'm Giacomo of the continent,
the king's new jester.

276
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,686
The court jester.

277
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:32,592
Giacomo?

278
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:37,151
Giacomo the incomparable!
King of jesters, and jester of kings.

279
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:38,995
Well where are you from?

280
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:41,002
Most recently the Italian court.

281
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:43,539
But I have entertained in
all the courts of Europe,

282
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:45,957
and speak a ready wit
in their every tongue.

283
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:51,566
Hawkins, we are indeed honored
that our humble hut will shelter one,

284
00:24:51,638 --> 00:24:53,947
will tomorrow be an
intimate of the king.

285
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:56,019
With access to his chambers.

286
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:57,934
But how will they know you?

287
00:24:57,985 --> 00:25:01,513
Are you sure that no one in the
castle has ever seen your face?

288
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,734
Not yet! But I assure you,

289
00:25:03,775 --> 00:25:05,195
ere another sun has set,

290
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,094
the entire court of England
will succumb to the charm,

291
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:13,092
wit, and song of the incomparable
Giacomo, king of jesters..

292
00:25:15,498 --> 00:25:18,060
...And jester to the king!

293
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:19,578
I'll take the child
to the abbey.

294
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,575
You must go to the castle at once.
Quickly, into his clothes!

295
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:25,010
W-what are we going
to do about him?

296
00:25:25,063 --> 00:25:27,313
I'll notify the fox,
he'll be taken care of.

297
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:31,810
Now listen, listen carefully.
Once inside the castle,

298
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:35,296
you must get to the king's chamber,
and find the key to the secret passage.

299
00:25:35,328 --> 00:25:36,328
Key to the passage. Right.

300
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,481
Then you must give it to the one man
inside the castle who's our confederate.

301
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,652
- Confederate.

302
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,819
You mean we already have somebody
inside the castle? One of our own people?

303
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,433
You will contact him by
whistling our secret call.

304
00:25:47,975 --> 00:25:49,646
Whistle it, hum it, sing it.

305
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:51,207
But I don't understand,

306
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:54,360
if we already have somebody inside
the castle, why doesn't he get the key?

307
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:58,824
You'll understand when you see him.
Now, he'll hear that and identify himself.

308
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,484
Why can't you just
tell me his name?

309
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:03,011
Should they discover you, they
might force you to reveal his identity.

310
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,027
Okay, I'd like to ask
you one question.

311
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:07,211
After months of pleading
for just this kind of action,

312
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,098
what makes you think that anybody ..anybody
could force me reveal the identity of my confederate?

313
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:14,696
Because they'd put you on the rack,
crack your every bone, scald you with hot oil,

314
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:17,772
and remove the nails off your
fingers with flaming hot pincers.

315
00:26:18,372 --> 00:26:20,185
I'd... Like to withdraw the question.

316
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:25,077
Hawkins, the future of England
depends on this; you cannot fail.

317
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:26,158
I will not.

318
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:27,859
Oh heaven help you.

319
00:26:30,217 --> 00:26:32,672
Now remember from this moment on,

320
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,908
you're no longer Hubert
Hawkins the carnival entertainer;

321
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:41,460
You're the incomparable Giacomo,
king of jesters and jester to the king.

322
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:45,890
Jester to the king.
Jester to the king.

323
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:47,501
To the king!?

324
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:52,640
The child escapes. You hear that,
Ravenhurst? The child escapes.

325
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:55,299
Gwendolyn, dear, do
stop picking that thing.

326
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:57,151
The revolt spreads.

327
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,040
Brockhurst here says
alliance with Griswold,

328
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,844
Finsdale says alliance,
Pertwee says alliance,

329
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,230
and yet you, Ravenhurst,
you of all my ministers...

330
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,085
Sire. If my lords Brockhurst, Finsdale,
and Pertwee plead so strongly for alliance,

331
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,613
then by all means let us have such alliance.

332
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,978
A marriage between Sir Griswold
and the princess Gwendolyn.

333
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:16,500
You are quite right.

334
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,922
Never! Never marriage with Griswold!

335
00:27:18,963 --> 00:27:20,355
Be sensible. - Sensible!

336
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:26,449
I've seen this monster, and it's not for nothing
he's called the grim and gruesome grisly Griswold.

337
00:27:26,488 --> 00:27:29,189
Grim, grisly or gruesome,
you'll marry Griswold!

338
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,570
I'll die first.

339
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:32,630
Go to your chambers!

340
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:34,706
Good, it is done.

341
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:36,893
Arrange for the wedding
directly after the tournament.

342
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:38,358
We'll make a show of this.

343
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:41,255
You there! Go hence.
Scour the countryside.

344
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,246
Bring in the fairest
wenches in the land.

345
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,760
Mind you see that
they are the fairest.

346
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,320
Wenches, laughter, song,
that's what this court needs!

347
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:49,937
Indeed, sire! And the good
Giacomo will provide it.

348
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:51,465
Giacomo? Who is Giacomo?

349
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,315
He's the new
jester I've sent for.

350
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,920
By reputation the gayest and
wittiest entertainer in Europe.

351
00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:58,614
Splendid! Ha ha! What
a festival this will be.

352
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:01,675
Jousting by our boldest knights.
Wenches at our beck and call.

353
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:05,071
My daughter married to Griswold,
who will take her to a castle up north.

354
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:10,122
Way up north! But gentle
lords, you make me very happy.

355
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:15,687
They have won.

356
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:19,400
For the moment, yes. The king is
guided by the last voice he hears,

357
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:22,801
and that voice shall be mine.
Giacomo will see to that.

358
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,929
Giacomo? A mere jester?

359
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,796
With one special talent for which
my agent has bargained dearly.

360
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,701
In addition to his brilliance
as an entertainer,

361
00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:35,130
the jester Giacomo also happens
to be the world's most skillful,

362
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:39,359
devious, and subtle master
of the art of assassination.

363
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:50,084
So as Hawkins becomes the incomparable
Giacomo and heads for the castle,

364
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:54,032
while the maid Jean with the infant
king still hidden in the wine cask,

365
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:58,800
journeys towards the abbey
and safety for the child.

366
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,577
Their plan seems simple enough,

367
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:05,103
but the simplest plans so often go a miss.

368
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:08,522
For at the very moment
Hawkins was delayed on the road,

369
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:11,317
the maid Jean was to run
afoul of the king's men,

370
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,770
who were scouring the countryside
for the fairest wenches in the land.

371
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,593
And so Jean and
the precious wine cart,

372
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:29,825
were taken to the castle before Hawkins
had even finished repairing his wheel.

373
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:36,058
Ho there!

374
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,008
What's that?

375
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,453
Welcome Giacomo! We have come
to escort you to the castle, w..

376
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:47,187
Haven't we met before?

377
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,795
Ah... it's not very likely,
my good man, you see,

378
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:52,328
I'm on my way back
from the Italian court.

379
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,147
How speak you the king's
English with no trace of accent?

380
00:29:56,225 --> 00:30:00,353
Ah my dear sir, Giacomo is a master
of many many tongues indeed.

381
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,462
French: Je le parle le fleur
ce magnifique, le romantique..

382
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:11,453
Italian:

383
00:30:17,785 --> 00:30:22,795
German: Was haben Sie ausgehšbn
in das Kneibinbabn? Das Schmerz...

384
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:35,267
which means in any language,
why tarry? Let us off to the castle!

385
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:37,659
Off to the castle!
- Off to the castle!

386
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,348
To the castle.

387
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:09,910
Quick! The infant!

388
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:11,724
The infant? Where?

389
00:31:11,774 --> 00:31:13,208
Off of the main!
Off of the main!

390
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:15,746
The child is in the cask.

391
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:17,190
In the cask?

392
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:18,703
You must take him to the jester.

393
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:20,508
But the jester
hasn't arrived, yet.

394
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,109
Something must
have gone wrong.

395
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,194
You look after the child,
I'll have to get the key myself.

396
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:26,415
But how? - I don't...

397
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:28,407
Come along there, wench!

398
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:45,421
My heart knows a lovely song...

399
00:31:50,663 --> 00:31:55,891
So this is the incomparable Giacomo.
He looks not at all like what I expected.

400
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,433
And this singing peacock will
still the voices of Brockhurst,

401
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:00,944
Finsdale, and Pertwee?

402
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:03,982
Before midnight, if
he fulfills his bargain.

403
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,660
You sent for me, my lady?

404
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,392
Lock it.

405
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,576
What is it, child?
Something wrong, my lady?

406
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:23,460
Drink! A brew of
your own concocting.

407
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,745
Before I marry Griswold, I
will die, and so will you. Drink!

408
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:30,735
No! Don't despair, child.
You will not marry Griswold.

409
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:32,776
I've told you. It was
written in the stars.

410
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:35,090
Your true love will come
yet, I promise you!

411
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,654
Drink! You lie.

412
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,073
Would I lie to you, child? Your own
Griselda? Look at me! Look in my eyes!

413
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:43,246
Try not your wiles on me, Witch!

414
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:46,747
Too often have I seen people look in
those eyes and fall under your evil spell.

415
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,715
You will die for your deceit!

416
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,228
Filling my head with fairy
stories of a romantic lover.

417
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,436
A lover who would carry me away
from this monstrous castle!

418
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:58,285
And so he shall! He
comes, even now!

419
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,419
You lie!

420
00:32:59,486 --> 00:33:01,207
No, I swear it,
your highness, look!

421
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,160
If this be another
one of your tricks...

422
00:33:03,195 --> 00:33:06,401
Trust me, look. Look,
near the drawbridge.

423
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:17,551
King of jesters, jester of kings.

424
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:19,906
He is most fair of countenance.

425
00:33:19,953 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh yes he is!

426
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:24,387
Handsome of bearing. -Like Apollo of
the Greeks! -A figure of romance.

427
00:33:24,424 --> 00:33:26,448
Sent by the gods,
and for you alone!

428
00:33:26,594 --> 00:33:28,789
Now mark this, creature of evil.

429
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,290
If this be not my true love,

430
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:33,259
and I am faced with
marriage to Griswold,

431
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:36,274
you will die, and by my hand.

432
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:40,084
Fear not, m'lady, your lover will
be here, in this room, within the hour.

433
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:43,549
And he will prove that
his is a mission of love.

434
00:33:44,294 --> 00:33:47,775
For your sake, dear
Griselda, he had better.

435
00:33:56,801 --> 00:34:02,718
I am Giacomo, Giacomo,
my fame before me rings,

436
00:34:03,495 --> 00:34:08,084
a king of jesters, and jester of kings!

437
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:17,988
my heart knows a
lovely song.. heh heh..

438
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:27,985
it whistles it all day long

439
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:36,443
Giacomo is my nom de plume,

440
00:34:36,504 --> 00:34:40,086
I whistle and hum
but I hum to whom?

441
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:45,826
To whom do I hum, to whom?

442
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:57,171
My song of love let
the whole world hear

443
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,020
until that sweet moment,

444
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:04,977
that moment when you appear,

445
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:11,851
I'll whisper it in your ear,

446
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:42,789
I bid you welcome!
I am Ravenhurst.

447
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:47,388
Ravenhurst Ravenhurst?
Uh the real Ravenhurst?

448
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,350
What?

449
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:51,400
Does the king know? I mean does the king
know about your being the real Ravenhurst?

450
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:52,708
Keep your jests for the king.

451
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:54,229
Don't stand there gaping!

452
00:35:54,307 --> 00:35:56,606
You, Fergus and the others,
get the jester's bags!

453
00:35:57,897 --> 00:35:59,215
You arrived not a
moment too soon.

454
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:00,954
When do we start?
- Tonight.

455
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:04,000
Good. I'd like to get in, get on with it,
get it over with, and get out. Get it?

456
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:06,009
Got it. - Good.

457
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,440
That was an interesting
song you sing.

458
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:10,000
Thank you, I'm glad
you liked it, old man.

459
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,430
Did it go like this?

460
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:14,043
Ostle about your business!

461
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:16,979
What is the first step?

462
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:19,302
Get me to the king's chambers.

463
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:21,057
The king's chambers?
- Yes...

464
00:36:21,104 --> 00:36:22,156
Very well, if you say so.

465
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:24,242
It may be the Key to
the whole plan, get it?

466
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:25,680
Got it. - Good.

467
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,566
Yes, yes, I'll take
Griswold's emissaries,

468
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:29,198
but for the moment there
are other matters...

469
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:32,291
I understand the wenches have
arrived. Where are they?

470
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,235
What have we here?

471
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,372
Uh, Sire, may I present
the incomparable Giacomo.

472
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:38,269
Uh, king of jesters,
and jester of kings.

473
00:36:38,302 --> 00:36:40,672
Oh, yes! From Italy. I haven't
been there for years.

474
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,904
Tell me, how go things
at the Italian court?

475
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:44,012
Ah very well indeed, sire.

476
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:47,489
Splendid, splendid. what about
all those stories we've heard?

477
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:49,705
Wasn't it awful about
the Duchess of Urber ?

478
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:51,689
Oh, just. Uh, just awful, sire.

479
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:53,779
I ask you, how could a
thing like that happen?

480
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:57,978
Well, sire, you know the Italian court;
what better place to court Italians?

481
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,162
Italian court? Court Italians!

482
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,002
Ah, Ravenhurst, the fellow
has wit! Ah, I must say,

483
00:37:05,037 --> 00:37:08,350
I was shocked to hear about the
Duchess. What did the Duke do?

484
00:37:09,821 --> 00:37:10,907
Pardon?

485
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:12,535
The Duke. What did
the Duke do?

486
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:13,922
Eh... the Duke do?

487
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:15,405
Yes. And what
about the Douge ?

488
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,137
Oh, the Douge!

489
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,909
Eh. Well what did
the Douge do?

490
00:37:19,466 --> 00:37:21,478
The Douge do?
- Yes, the Douge do.

491
00:37:21,562 --> 00:37:24,057
Well, uh, the Douge did what
the Douge does. Eh, uh,

492
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:26,429
Oh, when the Douge does his
duty to the Duke, that is.

493
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:27,403
What? What's that?

494
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,665
Oh, it's very simple, sire.

495
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:30,702
When the Douge did his
duty and the Duke didn't,

496
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:33,315
that's when the Duchess did the
dirt to the Duke with the Douge.

497
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:34,350
Who did what to what?

498
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,505
Oh, they all did, sire. There
they were in the dark;

499
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:39,434
The Duke with his dagger, the Douge
with his dart, Duchess with her dirk.

500
00:37:39,478 --> 00:37:40,816
Duchess with her dirk?
- Yes!

501
00:37:40,836 --> 00:37:43,462
The Duchess dove at the Duke just
when the Duke dove at the Douge.

502
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:45,902
Now the Duke ducked, the Douge
dodged, and the Duchess didn't.

503
00:37:45,937 --> 00:37:49,318
So the Duke got the Duchess, the Duchess
got the Douge, and the Douge got the Duke!

504
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:53,401
Curious. I... I... hm?
What? What's that?

505
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:56,975
All I heard was that the Duchess had a
siege of rheumatism. She's 83, you know.

506
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:58,000
Oh, come next summer, sire.

507
00:37:58,036 --> 00:37:59,488
So's the Duke.
- So's the Duke.

508
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:02,055
Remarkable, those Italians, what?

509
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:09,010
Made the whole thing
up, didn't you? Ho ha.

510
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:11,573
Very witty, very clever.
Just what this court needs

511
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:16,257
Laughter, gaiety, songs,
wenches... oh, yes. Wenches.

512
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,474
I'm just on my way to
inspect the lot of them.

513
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:20,594
Who knows, I may
find some luscious...

514
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:21,776
Oh, sire.

515
00:38:22,202 --> 00:38:24,733
If I may suggest, it ill befits the
propriety of your high office

516
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,035
to be seen with these
unkempt wenches. - Wha...?

517
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:31,441
It is said the incomparable Giacomo
has a discerning eye for beauty.

518
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:35,324
Eh, why not let him select a
suitable companion for your majesty?

519
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:36,903
Excellent! Excellent!

520
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:42,192
I trust the jester's reputation is based
on many years of accomplishment?

521
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,774
Why do you think they call
me incomparable, sire? Get it?

522
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:47,614
Got it. - Good.

523
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:51,347
Bring her to my chambers.
Within the hour?

524
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:52,924
Within the hour.

525
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:55,804
Finish with the king and
come to my chambers.

526
00:38:55,846 --> 00:38:57,093
Within the hour.

527
00:38:57,406 --> 00:38:59,078
Eh, about that song, sir...

528
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,560
Some other time, my good man.

529
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,401
Yes, Fergus, get on
with your work!

530
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:05,810
The good captain will escort you
to your quarters. - Very well.

531
00:39:06,321 --> 00:39:08,597
Are you sure we
haven't met before?

532
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:10,299
Quite sure.

533
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:12,324
Within the hour.

534
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:18,562
Your Giacomo seems more
the fool than the assassin.

535
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:21,520
Or perchance a brilliant
combination of both.

536
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:22,959
We shall see.

537
00:39:26,343 --> 00:39:31,798
I'm Giacomo, Giacomo,
my fame before me rings,

538
00:39:32,105 --> 00:39:36,914
king of jesters,
and jester of kings!

539
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,687
What are you doing here?

540
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:40,162
I'm Fergus, the Ostler.

541
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:41,640
Whobis the whatsler?

542
00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:45,417
Fergus the Ostler. It is I, not
Ravenhurst who is your friend.

543
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:48,103
Look, my good man, you pick
your friends and I shall pick mine.

544
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:50,450
At the moment, I have a very
important mission with the king.

545
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:54,285
After all, I'm the incomparable Giacomo,
king of jesters and jester of kings.

546
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:56,409
I have entertained in
all the courts of Europe

547
00:39:56,449 --> 00:39:59,605
and speak a ready wit in their
every tongue. Uh who are you?

548
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,940
I am Griselda.

549
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:02,001
Gruhwhoolda?

550
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:04,587
Griselda. I bring you a
message from the princess.

551
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,814
Uh, the royal princess?

552
00:40:05,857 --> 00:40:08,166
She finds you most attractive
and would like to meet you.

553
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:09,302
M-m-me? - Yes.

554
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:11,434
She finds you passing
fair, passing graceful.

555
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:14,471
Oh, uh, tell her thank you very
much but I'm just passing through.

556
00:40:14,524 --> 00:40:17,187
One does not ordinarily
refuse princesses...

557
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,126
Well, one doesn't
ordinarily, but you see...

558
00:40:19,174 --> 00:40:21,421
Is it possible there's someone
else of whom you are fond?

559
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:23,608
Uh y-yes, as a matter
of fact there is.

560
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:25,466
Giacomo, would you
look in my eye?

561
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:27,220
Eye?

562
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:28,407
Yes, it's been troubling me,

563
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,621
and I thought that the great Giacomo
would have a knowledge of science.

564
00:40:31,756 --> 00:40:32,960
Eh s-science. Well, yes,

565
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:35,420
as a matter of fact I have a
great deal of scientific knowledge.

566
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,811
We have b-b-which eye?

567
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:39,201
Both. Look at them both.

568
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:43,090
Closer, closer. Deeper,

569
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,400
deeper. Deeper, deeper.

570
00:40:47,438 --> 00:40:50,084
Tails of lizards, ears of swine,

571
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,031
chicken gizzards soaked in brine,

572
00:40:52,055 --> 00:40:55,178
now thine eyes and mine
entwine, thy will is broken,

573
00:40:55,242 --> 00:40:57,423
thou are mine!

574
00:40:57,801 --> 00:41:00,595
Repeat after me. I am
craven and thou art my master!

575
00:41:00,622 --> 00:41:02,049
I am craven and
thou art my master!

576
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:03,272
Stand there, fool.
- Stand there, fool.

577
00:41:04,304 --> 00:41:05,401
Silence! - Silence!

578
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:07,617
You are in my power and
will obey my every command.

579
00:41:07,658 --> 00:41:08,658
Every command...

580
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:10,043
And remember,
any time I choose,

581
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,288
a mere snap of my fingers can
bring you out of the spell like this!

582
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,838
And back like that!

583
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,300
Do you understand, fool?

584
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:19,473
Yes, master. You can snap
me in and snap me out.

585
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:21,008
Now, listen closely.

586
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,845
First and foremost, you must
convince the girl that this is a miracle,

587
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,563
that you have been
sent here by the gods.

588
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,075
To do that, you must go
to her room and make love!

589
00:41:30,128 --> 00:41:31,933
Go and make love
to the princess!

590
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:33,023
The princess...

591
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:35,374
At once! Wait!
Not like that!

592
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,913
You are a figure of romance;

593
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:40,544
of spirit and action, but at the
same time humble and tender.

594
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:43,737
You are a man of iron
with the soul of a poet.

595
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,780
You are adventurous, gay, but
with a lovers brooding melancholy,

596
00:41:47,914 --> 00:41:49,785
and above all, you
must show passion!

597
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:51,307
Show passion!

598
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:54,586
Not me, you fool!
Now go. Make love.

599
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:59,375
Climb the vine to the tower
where your love awaits you! Stop!

600
00:41:59,632 --> 00:42:02,422
Above all, remember you
must be cavalier, dashing!

601
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:04,067
Fear not, master!

602
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:07,932
Once I'm up the thorny vine,
the regal maiden shall be mine.

603
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:10,589
Fear not, master!

604
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:45,101
Hawkins!

605
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:48,848
You got here!

606
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:52,120
Well of course I got
here, my silly little goose!

607
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:53,258
Thank heaven.

608
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:56,290
Ah-cha-cha, you'll have to
wait your turn like the others!

609
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:57,857
Good, good, you're doing it well.

610
00:42:57,887 --> 00:43:00,177
But have you heard the
change of plan? Here, take this.

611
00:43:00,212 --> 00:43:02,763
I just told you, dear, you'll
just have to wait your turn.

612
00:43:02,774 --> 00:43:05,342
Now don't overdo it.
Fergus will bring you the infant.

613
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:06,338
Huh?

614
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:08,750
Well, well, Giacomo.

615
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:10,936
Successful so soon?

616
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:14,005
Truly as dainty a dish as
ever was set before a king.

617
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,502
About your business, I would
have a word with the maid.

618
00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:18,090
Your majesty.

619
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:23,663
What is your name, child?

620
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,729
Jean, sire.

621
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:27,411
Jean. Lovely name.

622
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:29,160
For a lovely face.

623
00:43:29,488 --> 00:43:31,310
See that she is
jeweled and gowned.

624
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:33,665
She shall sit next to me
at the banquet, tonight.

625
00:43:58,648 --> 00:44:01,232
You! You've come!

626
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,550
At your service, my lady.

627
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:09,047
So this is Giacomo!

628
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,531
King of jesters
and jester of kings.

629
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,083
Not today, m'lady.

630
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:16,060
Today I am Giacomo,
a lover of beauty,

631
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:18,448
and a beauty of a lover.

632
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:21,506
Can this be true?
Or is it merely a dream?

633
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:23,795
Dream? Is this a dream?

634
00:44:23,854 --> 00:44:25,983
Or this? Or this? Or this?

635
00:44:26,018 --> 00:44:27,699
Or this? Or this?

636
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:29,874
No, no, no, we are
strangers, hardly met.

637
00:44:30,282 --> 00:44:32,363
What manner of man
are you, Giacomo?

638
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,527
What manner of man
is Giacomo? Ha ha!

639
00:44:35,654 --> 00:44:37,599
I shall tell you what
manner of man is he.

640
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:40,100
He lives for a sigh,
he dies for a kiss,

641
00:44:40,142 --> 00:44:42,073
he lusts for the laugh, ha!

642
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:44,850
He never walks
when he can leap!

643
00:44:47,527 --> 00:44:49,571
he never flees
when he can fight.

644
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:54,101
He swoons at the
beauty of a rose.

645
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:56,619
And I offer myself
to you, all of me.

646
00:44:56,689 --> 00:45:00,028
My heart. My lips.
My legs. My calves.

647
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:02,262
Do what you will..
my love endures.

648
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:07,198
Beat me. Kick me.

649
00:45:08,835 --> 00:45:10,019
I am yours.

650
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:12,929
Oh, Giacomo,
you are so ardent!

651
00:45:13,034 --> 00:45:14,745
With your permission, my lady,

652
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,249
I'd like to go 'round again.

653
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:19,233
Oh, no, Giacomo,
we must be discreet.

654
00:45:19,345 --> 00:45:22,755
Ha! Discretion is for
fools and simpletons!

655
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:28,620
This cannot be! Miracles
are things of fancy,

656
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,578
and lovers are not
sent by the gods.

657
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:32,814
Speak not too
lightly, my love.

658
00:45:33,555 --> 00:45:36,192
Who are we to say
nay to miracles?

659
00:45:36,226 --> 00:45:39,013
But one doesn't find love
in one moment, one kiss..

660
00:45:39,732 --> 00:45:41,461
that key? Where
did you find it?

661
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:43,002
Key? - It is a miracle!

662
00:45:43,037 --> 00:45:46,298
The gods who sent you have also
provided a means for our escape.

663
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:47,789
This is the key to the
secret passageway.

664
00:45:48,144 --> 00:45:50,096
Grand. We leave at
midnight. Get it?

665
00:45:50,132 --> 00:45:51,548
Got it. - Good.

666
00:45:51,803 --> 00:45:53,076
Very good.

667
00:45:53,102 --> 00:45:55,589
Oh no, my precious,
I'll keep it next to my heart;

668
00:45:55,624 --> 00:45:57,333
a sweet symbol of your love.

669
00:45:57,376 --> 00:46:00,003
And take this, a
sweet symbol of mine.

670
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,216
I'll wear it always
next to my heart.

671
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,757
Gwendolyn?

672
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,094
Are you there? I would
have words with you?

673
00:46:07,202 --> 00:46:09,084
My father. You must hide!

674
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,315
Hide? Giacomo
hides for no man!

675
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,708
But you must! He'd kill any
man found in my chambers.

676
00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:17,167
Ah, be he king or peasant,
my ready blade will find its mark!

677
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,687
I'll... I'll..

678
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:22,191
I..I live for a sigh, I die for a
laugh, I lust for a laugh, ha ha!

679
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:23,505
Please! - What?

680
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,227
Or our lives aren't
worth that!

681
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:26,488
What? Eh, eh? Eh?

682
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:34,268
Are you alone, my dear?
I thought I heard voices.

683
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:36,265
Yes, I'm quite alone, father.

684
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:38,260
The king!

685
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,862
Listen, my child. I've just
met Griswold's emissary,

686
00:46:39,899 --> 00:46:41,171
and the marriage is approved.

687
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:42,607
You know very well, father,

688
00:46:42,642 --> 00:46:45,256
that when I marry,
I marry only for love.

689
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,164
Heh, heh, I knew you'd say that.
Now, Gwendolyn, do be reasonable.

690
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:50,833
Don't you realize that without
this alliance, our prestige,

691
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:53,281
our power, our position
could go like that!

692
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:55,405
Well, then let it go like that!

693
00:46:55,483 --> 00:46:57,019
I wish you to marry Griswold.

694
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:59,106
And suppose I do not
wish to marry Griswold?

695
00:46:59,141 --> 00:47:00,500
I don't give a fig
for your wishes!

696
00:47:00,593 --> 00:47:02,424
And I don't give
a fig for yours!

697
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,065
No one snaps at the king!
Don't you dare snap at me!

698
00:47:05,104 --> 00:47:06,243
I'll snap if I choose!

699
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,076
Don't snap at me!
- I will snap!

700
00:47:08,102 --> 00:47:10,412
You won't! Now
understand this, my child.

701
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:12,834
This castle has walls
high and strong,

702
00:47:13,035 --> 00:47:15,635
with massive gates
under lock and key.

703
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:18,656
Whilst you remain within
those walls and I am king,

704
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:20,946
you will obey my command.

705
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:25,923
Very well, father. Perhaps I have
been selfish and thoughtless.

706
00:47:25,962 --> 00:47:29,987
Oh, my child. I knew I
could depend upon you.

707
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:31,918
Because you are a princess.

708
00:47:31,954 --> 00:47:35,070
A true princess.
Loyal to the crown.

709
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:38,403
Sympathetic.
Sensitive. Faithful.

710
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:43,903
The key to the
secret passage!

711
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:44,815
Father, let me have it...

712
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,679
So, run away, would you!
Well, you trick me not.

713
00:47:46,715 --> 00:47:48,065
This key will never
leave my person.

714
00:47:48,406 --> 00:47:49,898
You will marry Griswold
upon the morrow,

715
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,552
and I promise you, daughter
or not, princess or not,

716
00:47:52,732 --> 00:47:57,154
one move,  one false move,
and your neck will snap like a twig!

717
00:47:57,631 --> 00:47:59,711
Where is he? Giacomo
hides not behind drapes!

718
00:47:59,732 --> 00:48:00,904
No no no, you must go!

719
00:48:00,937 --> 00:48:02,131
I'll cut him to ribbons.

720
00:48:02,158 --> 00:48:03,942
No, we'll escape tonight
after the banquet.

721
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:07,320
Very well, my sweet.
Until tonight. Very good.

722
00:48:07,821 --> 00:48:09,695
Do be cautious,
sweet Giacomo!

723
00:48:09,738 --> 00:48:12,729
Ha! Caution is for
popinjays and cockatoos

724
00:48:13,084 --> 00:48:15,460
Begging your pardon.
Until tonight, my sweet.

725
00:48:15,495 --> 00:48:16,628
But you heard what
my father said.

726
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:19,382
If caught, our necks
will snap like twigs!

727
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:23,802
Uh... like what?
- Twigs!

728
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,035
Twigs? Speak not of twigs
when you look at an oak!

729
00:48:27,077 --> 00:48:28,995
Until tonight,
my little sapling.

730
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:36,007
If Giacomo says he will
be here within the hour,

731
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:39,171
he will be here...
eh, within the hour!

732
00:48:41,688 --> 00:48:42,728
At your service, m'lord!

733
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:46,859
Your arrival, good Giacomo,
shows imagination and brilliance.

734
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:48,202
Did you expect less?

735
00:48:48,229 --> 00:48:51,067
Are you now prepared to fulfill
the bargain arranged by my agent,

736
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:53,044
Sir Burton of Allenburg?
- Quite.

737
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:55,201
Very well, then.
There are two plans.

738
00:48:55,252 --> 00:48:56,815
Two plans.
- Plan one.

739
00:48:56,905 --> 00:49:01,233
The untimely demise of my lords
Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee.

740
00:49:01,347 --> 00:49:02,651
These three
will die tonight.

741
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:04,444
Three for tonight. Proceed.

742
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:08,861
The method I leave to you.
But die they must.

743
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,051
Heh! They shall
drop like flies.

744
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:13,169
Precisely. Like flies.

745
00:49:13,506 --> 00:49:15,311
Do you have some
sort of twitch?

746
00:49:15,426 --> 00:49:17,998
Twitch? I twitch
only for action.

747
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:20,200
I live for a sigh,
I die for a kiss.

748
00:49:20,235 --> 00:49:21,413
I like that very much.
- Thank you.

749
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,061
I lust for a laugh. Ha ha!

750
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:25,853
I never leap when I can walk,
I never flee when I can fight!

751
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:26,853
Yes, but, but...
- I... pardon?

752
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:30,430
Listen carefully! If plan one fails,
you must execute plan two.

753
00:49:30,477 --> 00:49:31,243
Plan two?

754
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:34,250
Take the princess from the
castle before midnight.

755
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:35,913
By whatever means
you may devise.

756
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:38,158
For murder or abduction,
I'm your man.

757
00:49:38,189 --> 00:49:40,047
You've paid the price;
name your plan.

758
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:41,473
First, plan one.

759
00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:45,510
Are you sure you can dispose of my
lords Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee?

760
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:46,691
Are they married?

761
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,770
Yes...

762
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:49,935
Order flowers for
the widows. Get it?

763
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,541
Got it. - Good.

764
00:49:53,755 --> 00:49:55,794
Tally ho! Ho ho!

765
00:50:01,786 --> 00:50:03,158
Master, I am Back
- Well?

766
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:08,177
I have climbed the thorny vine,
and the regal maiden is mine.

767
00:50:08,491 --> 00:50:09,771
Good.

768
00:50:10,212 --> 00:50:12,052
Now, when I release
you from the spell,

769
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:14,908
you will fall into a deep sleep
and remember nothing.

770
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:15,805
Nothing...

771
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:19,805
Look into my eye.
Deeper, deeper.

772
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:26,760
Ah, my lords.
I understand the marriage

773
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:29,939
of the princess Gwendolyn to Sir
Griswold will be announced tonight.

774
00:50:30,398 --> 00:50:32,088
My congratulations.

775
00:50:35,043 --> 00:50:38,961
There is something afoot.
He is far too confident.

776
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:41,255
If this alliance
fails, we are lost.

777
00:50:41,293 --> 00:50:44,399
It must not fail. Let us solemnly
pledge that we will permit nothing,

778
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:47,431
to interfere with the marriage of
Griswold to the princess Gwendolyn.

779
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:49,307
I so pledge.
- And I.

780
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,317
Though it cost
our very lives!

781
00:50:51,354 --> 00:50:52,718
Our very lives.

782
00:51:04,313 --> 00:51:06,860
Please, stop your picking and
fussing! I must breathe some air!

783
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:07,705
But madam!

784
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:10,267
All afternoon without
a moment's peace!

785
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,432
I just learned of your
whereabouts. What happened...

786
00:51:16,467 --> 00:51:19,151
Never mind that. You must
take the child to the jester.

787
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:20,114
To the jester!

788
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:21,410
Immediately. He has the key.

789
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:22,562
But he's under
the spell of the...

790
00:51:22,598 --> 00:51:24,479
Silence! Give him the child
at once! It is my command.

791
00:51:29,577 --> 00:51:32,196
The jester! Where is the jester?
Summon him immediately!

792
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:33,755
Very good, sire!

793
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:40,225
Jester!
- Coming!

794
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:42,632
Come quickly, man!
The king is waiting!

795
00:51:42,676 --> 00:51:44,242
Yes, uh, ha ha, have you
seen Ravenhurst about?

796
00:51:44,278 --> 00:51:45,821
He's somewhere about, yes.

797
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:48,512
Well, I was supposed to see Ravenhurst
on some rather urgent business,

798
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:51,299
but I fell asleep... I don't
quite remember what I...

799
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:56,106
Ahh, Giacomo. A striking costume,
indeed. From the Italian court, I presume.

800
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:59,480
Yes, sire, Italian court. Ah, uh,
what better place to, uh...

801
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:01,159
...court Italians.

802
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:03,820
Ah, this will be
a festive evening.

803
00:52:03,856 --> 00:52:06,646
Noble knights to joust at
my tournament. Come along.

804
00:52:06,727 --> 00:52:08,856
And by my side a
lovely little wench,

805
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,322
who I'm sure will fulfill every
promise of your discerning eye.

806
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:14,949
Ah, look at her!

807
00:52:16,187 --> 00:52:19,909
Charming. Charming,
Giacomo, charming.

808
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:22,238
A tribute to you,
my dear Giacomo.

809
00:52:23,863 --> 00:52:26,840
Come here, my child.
Come.

810
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,442
Your majesty.

811
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:38,342
Was there ever more beauty?
More radiant? Rise, child.

812
00:52:39,482 --> 00:52:43,044
The sweetness of your smile
outshines the elegance of your gown.

813
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:45,034
Thank you, sire.

814
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,743
Would you attend me?

815
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:50,053
You are most gracious, sire.

816
00:52:57,152 --> 00:52:58,890
Quickly. Use the key.

817
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,022
Key?

818
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,680
Remember, plan one
Brockhurst, Finsdale, Pertwee.

819
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:04,922
Brockhurst, Finsdale, Pertwee.

820
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,810
Midnight. Horses
at the north gate.

821
00:53:07,845 --> 00:53:09,391
Horses at the north gate...

822
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,637
Summon the jester!

823
00:53:16,189 --> 00:53:18,273
Where are you going?
Didn't you hear the king?

824
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,130
Ah, beh, beh...

825
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,430
Cover your head!
Now get in there!

826
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,831
Come, come, Giacomo, let us
be gay! I would have a song.

827
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:36,842
Eh. Song.
- Has the cat your tongue?

828
00:53:36,886 --> 00:53:38,164
Uh, no, I...

829
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:40,144
What do you carry
there? Why the basket?

830
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,273
Beh, basket?
What basket, sire?

831
00:53:44,682 --> 00:53:46,696
What basket, indeed!

832
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,611
Come, boy, come, show me
what you have in the basket.

833
00:53:49,677 --> 00:53:50,917
Wuh, I can... eh...

834
00:53:50,954 --> 00:53:52,911
Yes, come on, show me what
you have in the basket.

835
00:53:52,946 --> 00:53:53,811
Eh, beh basket? It-it's...

836
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:55,533
Yes, and what about that song?

837
00:53:55,577 --> 00:53:57,657
S-s-song, sire? Eh beh s-song.

838
00:53:58,511 --> 00:54:00,159
If your majesty doth ask it,

839
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:04,191
I will tell about the basket with a
willo willo wailey and a nonny nonny

840
00:54:07,296 --> 00:54:08,591
What's that?
With a what?

841
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,641
Uh with a willo willo wailey and
a nonny nonny loo loo loo

842
00:54:12,689 --> 00:54:14,870
I'll loo loo loo loo...

843
00:54:17,832 --> 00:54:19,428
What are you
loo-loo-looing about?

844
00:54:19,478 --> 00:54:22,824
Oh, I'm not loo-loo-looing,
sire, I'm willo willo wailing.

845
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,290
All right, all right,
willo away, willo away.

846
00:54:25,783 --> 00:54:28,807
We will willo it away...

847
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:32,679
we'll willo willo willo
we will willo it away!

848
00:54:32,734 --> 00:54:35,707
with a willo willo wailey,
we will sing about it gaily,

849
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:40,232
with a willo willo wailey
and a hey! nonny... no!

850
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:42,921
Come back here!
What have you there?

851
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:44,626
What have you
in the basket?

852
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:47,240
Eh beh basket? Oh,
b- sire, it's nothing, sire.

853
00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:51,036
Merely a jester's
bag of tricks, sire.

854
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,237
It's a secret, sire.

855
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,554
Y-yes, a deep,
dark secret - beh -

856
00:54:56,174 --> 00:55:00,814
which has never before been
revealed to anybody in the world, sire.

857
00:55:00,856 --> 00:55:02,477
But I...

858
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,620
I am prepared
to make a statement.

859
00:55:07,014 --> 00:55:10,501
I was a lad, I was gloomy and sad as
I was from the day I was born!

860
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,183
When other babes giggled and gurgled
and wiggled I proudly was loudly forlorn!

861
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:17,950
My friends and my family looked at me
clammily, thought there was something amiss!

862
00:55:17,991 --> 00:55:21,375
When others found various antics
hilarious, all I could manage was this!

863
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:22,473
or this!

864
00:55:22,594 --> 00:55:23,445
or this!

865
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,669
or this!

866
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:27,165
My father, he shouted
He needs to be clouted.

867
00:55:27,201 --> 00:55:28,880
His teeth on a
wreath I'll hand him!

868
00:55:28,915 --> 00:55:30,695
My mother she cried as
she rushed to my side.

869
00:55:30,743 --> 00:55:32,435
You're a brute! and you
don't understand him!

870
00:55:32,482 --> 00:55:34,291
So they sent for a witch
with a terrible twitch

871
00:55:34,352 --> 00:55:36,171
to ask how my
future impressed her.

872
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:38,939
She took one look
at me and cried he...

873
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:42,637
hee hee hee.. he?

874
00:55:42,698 --> 00:55:44,567
What else could he
be but a jester?

875
00:55:44,736 --> 00:55:48,746
A jester? A jester?
A funny idear a jester!

876
00:55:48,871 --> 00:55:50,883
No butcher, no baker,
no candlestick maker

877
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:54,075
and me with the look of a fine
undertaker impressed her...

878
00:55:54,653 --> 00:55:56,258
as a jester?

879
00:55:56,403 --> 00:56:00,065
But where could I learn any comical
turn that was not in a book on the shelf?

880
00:56:00,104 --> 00:56:03,618
No teacher to take me to mold me
and make me a merry mad fool or an elf!

881
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:06,581
But I'm proud to recall that in no
time at all with no other recourses

882
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:10,748
but my own resources with firm
application and determination...

883
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:13,598
I made a fool of myself!

884
00:56:18,323 --> 00:56:20,278
I found a bow and arrow
and I learned to shoot.

885
00:56:20,306 --> 00:56:21,629
I found a little horn
and I learned to too.

886
00:56:21,652 --> 00:56:24,069
Now I can shoot and
too, ain't I cute?

887
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,652
(no end of song)

888
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,368
Tend to your duties!
Serve your drinks!

889
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:19,095
Hold it with that basket.
Let's have a look!

890
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:24,705
A toast! A toast!

891
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:27,193
A toast to his most
royal highness!

892
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:31,442
To Roderick the first, for all that he
has done for this great England of ours,

893
00:58:31,737 --> 00:58:35,324
may providence provide
a true and just reward!

894
00:58:35,588 --> 00:58:38,153
To the king!

895
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,171
Brockhurst!

896
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:51,452
Brilliant.

897
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:55,570
Finsdale!

898
00:58:56,646 --> 00:58:57,876
Magnificent!

899
00:58:59,732 --> 00:59:01,001
Pertwee!

900
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,681
Fantastic!

901
00:59:03,766 --> 00:59:06,124
Brockhurst, Finsdale, Pertwee...

902
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:08,237
They are all dead, sire!

903
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:10,740
As you said, flowers
for the widows.

904
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:12,935
Dead. Murdered.

905
00:59:12,975 --> 00:59:15,881
And by whose hand?
And who may be next?

906
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:20,753
Sir Griswold of Mackalwane
is approaching the castle!

907
00:59:20,785 --> 00:59:23,635
And just in time. He comes
not a moment too soon.

908
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,220
Bid Sir Griswold enter!

909
00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:26,450
Plan two.

910
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:31,075
Plan two?

911
00:59:33,432 --> 00:59:34,696
Plan two.

912
00:59:37,203 --> 00:59:39,093
Get those bodies out of here!

913
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:50,593
Quick, take him to safety.

914
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,244
...And get those goblets away.

915
00:59:53,398 --> 00:59:54,955
And... no! Not you, jester, not you.

916
00:59:55,022 --> 00:59:56,767
Come here, come here,
boy, come here.

917
01:00:00,689 --> 01:00:03,192
Sir Griswold of Mackalwane!

918
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,690
Approach, Sir Griswold.

919
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,087
Lighten the mood,
jester, a note of...

920
01:00:13,654 --> 01:00:14,773
My liege lord.

921
01:00:14,982 --> 01:00:18,097
Sir Griswold of Mackalwane,
I bid thee welcome.

922
01:00:18,901 --> 01:00:22,327
Ehh, a-welcome, Sir Griswold,
your beard is full of hair,

923
01:00:22,364 --> 01:00:26,024
but do I say welcome
or do I say mehh!

924
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:30,598
Sire. My emissary did report.

925
01:00:30,812 --> 01:00:33,485
And I proudly
accept your terms.

926
01:00:33,984 --> 01:00:36,246
Eh... th-the terms! the terms!

927
01:00:36,288 --> 01:00:39,578
He doth accept the terms.
He looks not smart, but in...

928
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:42,321
Excellent, excellent!
Members of the court,

929
01:00:42,354 --> 01:00:45,849
know you that the crown would
make a most felicitous announcement,

930
01:00:45,862 --> 01:00:48,905
concerning the defense and
security of our great kingdom,

931
01:00:49,242 --> 01:00:52,678
I would have you know that
today was an alliance consummated,

932
01:00:52,892 --> 01:00:55,937
between the crown and our
honored and valiant Baron,

933
01:00:56,002 --> 01:00:58,038
Sir Griswold of Mackalwane.

934
01:00:58,245 --> 01:01:00,101
Uh, the terms! the terms!

935
01:01:00,137 --> 01:01:01,473
We've already had the terms.

936
01:01:01,514 --> 01:01:02,521
Sorry.

937
01:01:03,447 --> 01:01:04,361
To cement this alliance,

938
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:05,954
I have decreed a royal marriage,

939
01:01:05,993 --> 01:01:09,422
between Sir Griswold of Mackalwane,
and Gwendolyn the Fair.

940
01:01:10,229 --> 01:01:13,945
Eh, eh rejoice! rejoice!
Although his brain is brief,

941
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,339
for when the larder's empty,
she'll have her ton of beef!

942
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:20,736
Would you like to try
the other side, sire?

943
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,978
Thank you, sire.

944
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:23,626
What say our gallant Griswold?

945
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:27,132
Sire. Princess fair.
From this moment on,

946
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:30,028
this hand, this steel, this heart,

947
01:01:30,073 --> 01:01:32,834
will exist for naught
but the love of the lady...

948
01:01:32,836 --> 01:01:37,050
Save your breath, Griswold!
There will be no alliance and no marriage.

949
01:01:37,484 --> 01:01:38,557
What's that?

950
01:01:38,816 --> 01:01:42,154
I cannot marry Griswold,
father. I love another.

951
01:01:42,192 --> 01:01:42,959
Another?

952
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:45,160
Another, another...

953
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:47,694
What is this nonsense?
What do you mean you love another?

954
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:52,134
Simply that, father. A miracle has
occurred to fulfill my every dream.

955
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:55,338
I have found my love,
father. My true love.

956
01:01:55,472 --> 01:01:56,538
Who is this man?

957
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:59,198
One to whom I have given
my heart and my hand.

958
01:01:59,247 --> 01:02:03,099
He who even now wears my silken
handkerchief next to his heart.

959
01:02:03,144 --> 01:02:04,410
What's that?
- What's that?

960
01:02:04,547 --> 01:02:08,233
Ah.. Her heart, her hand,
she holds for joy or grief,

961
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:11,747
but he who holds her hand
holds her heart kerchief.

962
01:02:11,796 --> 01:02:14,687
eh handkerchief,
eh hand kerheart,

963
01:02:14,729 --> 01:02:16,484
heart ke he
che ha- hah,

964
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:18,081
Who is this man? His name!

965
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:21,388
The man I love is a simple
man, but noble of heart.

966
01:02:21,485 --> 01:02:23,703
My beloved Giacomo!
- What?!

967
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:27,180
Uh. His name, his name,
and now his blood must flow.

968
01:02:27,238 --> 01:02:32,978
Light up the oil, this man must boil,
this man named Giaco- mo? oh! No!

969
01:02:33,171 --> 01:02:34,929
Seize this wretch and search him!

970
01:02:34,986 --> 01:02:36,593
Eh... I- I'm- Th-th-this
is a little mistake, sire.

971
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:39,568
I don't have  her heartkerchief,
uh, handkerheart. I don't have th..

972
01:02:40,608 --> 01:02:41,896
A handkerchief!

973
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,830
G! Gwendolyn!

974
01:02:43,865 --> 01:02:46,098
Uh, n-n-no, sire.
Geh-Gee G-G-Giacomo!

975
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:48,920
Shield me not, sweet Giacomo!
Our love makes me strong.

976
01:02:48,955 --> 01:02:51,511
Love for a common jester.
Take the swine out and hang him!

977
01:02:51,551 --> 01:02:55,735
Harm one hair of that majestic head and
I throw myself from the highest turret!

978
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,785
Enough of this!

979
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,595
How much insult must
I endure? Come, men.

980
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:01,835
Hold, Sir Griswold, your
honor will be avenged.

981
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:02,875
How?

982
01:03:02,938 --> 01:03:06,385
Were that wretch of noble rank,
I would challenge him to combat mortal!

983
01:03:06,422 --> 01:03:10,712
But I would not deign to soil my
blade with his miserable common blood!

984
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:13,365
H-he's right, you know, sire.
Rules of chivalry, you know.

985
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,800
Rules of chivalry be
hanged! And so will you.

986
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:16,882
She'll jump...!

987
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:18,041
Come, men.

988
01:03:18,084 --> 01:03:21,054
Hold, Sir Griswold. You will stay
until the morrow. It is my command.

989
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:24,001
'till the morrow, sire.
- You, Gwendolyn, to your chambers.

990
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:25,962
Be brave, sweet Giacomo.

991
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:27,999
Throw this blackguard in chains!

992
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:29,347
Is he not fabulous?

993
01:03:29,427 --> 01:03:32,184
Go from plan one to plan
two without a moment's pause.

994
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,636
The man is pure genius.

995
01:03:41,072 --> 01:03:43,383
Sir Griswold will never
tolerate this insult.

996
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:46,478
M'lords, to your chambers.
Ponder this problem.

997
01:03:46,513 --> 01:03:49,110
A solution must be found ere
we meet in council, tomorrow.

998
01:03:49,163 --> 01:03:50,379
Sire.

999
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:56,656
Welcome, Sir Burton!
You saw the jester's performance?

1000
01:03:57,341 --> 01:03:59,250
When I sent you to
negotiate for Giacomo,

1001
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:02,295
I never expected results
like this! Was he not brilliant?

1002
01:04:02,495 --> 01:04:03,558
Indeed.

1003
01:04:04,472 --> 01:04:06,149
With one slight discrepancy.

1004
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,729
This man is not Giacomo!

1005
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:09,408
What?!

1006
01:04:09,441 --> 01:04:11,058
I know not this pretender,
but I assure you

1007
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:14,038
he is not the Giacomo I met
and negotiated with in Europe!

1008
01:04:14,073 --> 01:04:17,091
I tell you I've seen this man
before, and somehow that maid!

1009
01:04:17,135 --> 01:04:19,772
Did I tell you?
What plan now?

1010
01:04:21,485 --> 01:04:23,107
To my chambers, immediately!

1011
01:04:24,362 --> 01:04:28,461
But if he's not Giacomo, who could
he be, and what does he want?

1012
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,052
Why would he do
our every bidding?

1013
01:04:30,088 --> 01:04:31,829
Why would he work to
destroy the alliance?

1014
01:04:31,876 --> 01:04:34,045
Why would he murder
with the cunning of a fox?

1015
01:04:34,712 --> 01:04:35,879
A fox.

1016
01:04:36,344 --> 01:04:39,175
But of course, a fox!
A Black Fox!

1017
01:04:39,806 --> 01:04:40,783
But you don't think that...

1018
01:04:40,819 --> 01:04:43,119
Why not? Who else
would oppose Griswold

1019
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,933
and want the alliance destroyed
but that rabble in the forest?

1020
01:04:45,995 --> 01:04:48,364
The forest. That's
where I saw him.

1021
01:04:48,399 --> 01:04:50,110
Dressed as an old man,
riding out of the forest,

1022
01:04:50,146 --> 01:04:52,411
with the very wench who
sat beside the king, tonight!

1023
01:04:52,446 --> 01:04:55,875
My lords... what a prize!
The Black Fox, himself!

1024
01:04:55,903 --> 01:04:56,980
Expose him! You'll
get all the credit!

1025
01:04:57,015 --> 01:04:58,625
Not so fast.

1026
01:05:00,078 --> 01:05:02,912
Not until the Fox pays
us one more service.

1027
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:05,434
He'll rid us forever of
the barbaric Griswold!

1028
01:05:05,598 --> 01:05:07,129
Kill Griswold? But how?

1029
01:05:07,192 --> 01:05:08,914
Whose is the deadliest
blade in England?

1030
01:05:08,998 --> 01:05:11,565
Who is the only man alive who
can best Griswold in mortal combat?

1031
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:12,464
Only the Black Fox!

1032
01:05:12,503 --> 01:05:14,764
But the Fox is a commoner
and cannot fight in tournament.

1033
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:15,920
We shall see.

1034
01:05:17,324 --> 01:05:19,013
No, Ravenhurst,
I do not understand.

1035
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,607
What do you mean Griswold
himself suggested a solution?

1036
01:05:21,646 --> 01:05:23,072
You yourself heard him, sire.

1037
01:05:23,105 --> 01:05:24,464
He said were the
jester of noble rank,

1038
01:05:24,506 --> 01:05:25,949
he would challenge
him to mortal combat.

1039
01:05:25,983 --> 01:05:28,656
But the jester cannot fight in
tournament! He's a commoner.

1040
01:05:28,698 --> 01:05:30,843
Then, sire,
knight the jester.

1041
01:05:31,683 --> 01:05:32,882
Knight the jester?!

1042
01:05:32,923 --> 01:05:35,424
Griswold can then challenge him for
the hand of the princess Gwendolyn,

1043
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:39,439
and by the rules of chivalry,
she must wed the victor!

1044
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:43,861
Knight the jester.
Sir Griswold will challenge him.

1045
01:05:43,926 --> 01:05:45,986
He dare not refuse.

1046
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:47,876
They meet at the
tournament, tomorrow,

1047
01:05:48,457 --> 01:05:51,218
Sir Griswold's  lance
runs the jester through,

1048
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:53,630
and the marriage and
the alliance proceed.

1049
01:05:53,665 --> 01:05:56,582
Yea? Hm. Ha!
Ha! Magnificent!

1050
01:05:56,622 --> 01:05:57,425
Thank you, sire.

1051
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,400
But your majesty,
knighthood is an arduous ritual!

1052
01:06:00,435 --> 01:06:02,664
It will take three years
to knight the jester.

1053
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:04,255
Three years? Nonsense!

1054
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,285
Ravenhurst,
take that nincompoop,

1055
01:06:06,328 --> 01:06:08,999
and knight that nincompoop
by noon tomorrow!

1056
01:06:09,036 --> 01:06:10,363
Sire.

1057
01:06:12,495 --> 01:06:13,829
By order of his
sovereign majesty,

1058
01:06:13,864 --> 01:06:16,602
the jester Giacomo shall enter
upon a series of tests of manhood,

1059
01:06:16,638 --> 01:06:19,941
skill, and courage requisite to
his becoming a knight of the realm.

1060
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:21,625
M-me a knight? But why?

1061
01:06:21,664 --> 01:06:23,953
To make you eligible for the
hand of the princess Gwendolyn.

1062
01:06:24,218 --> 01:06:25,825
M-marry the princess? W-when?

1063
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,480
Upon your passing
each and every test.

1064
01:06:27,515 --> 01:06:28,687
Oh! Well that's different.

1065
01:06:28,722 --> 01:06:31,100
It takes four or five years
to become a knight, doesn't it?

1066
01:06:31,135 --> 01:06:32,900
We shall see.
Let the tests begin!

1067
01:06:33,184 --> 01:06:35,768
Uh, w-wait! What's
the hurry? I- b- ch-

1068
01:06:37,268 --> 01:06:40,112
He must scale a stone
wall in full armor!

1069
01:06:45,996 --> 01:06:47,570
Candidate passes!

1070
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:49,565
Uh, b- buh... I didn't...!

1071
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,968
With long bow, he must
slay a hawk in full flight!

1072
01:06:56,636 --> 01:06:57,548
He passes!

1073
01:06:57,593 --> 01:06:58,763
But I didn't even shoot...

1074
01:06:58,792 --> 01:06:59,964
The candidate passes!

1075
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:02,295
But I didn't even shoot
the arrow! The arrow...

1076
01:07:02,302 --> 01:07:03,621
I- I didn't pass...!

1077
01:07:04,682 --> 01:07:08,136
The candidate must conquer
a wild boar with his bare hands!

1078
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:09,877
Release the boar!

1079
01:07:18,385 --> 01:07:19,775
He passes!

1080
01:07:26,602 --> 01:07:28,057
No one enters by
the king's command!

1081
01:07:29,163 --> 01:07:31,502
But this is the
king's command.

1082
01:07:40,508 --> 01:07:44,525
Ah, maid Jean. Welcome.
What brings you here at this hour?

1083
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,113
Concern for you, sire. - Mm?

1084
01:07:47,148 --> 01:07:49,527
You were so distressed last evening,

1085
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,600
that I thought perhaps
I could comfort you,

1086
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,393
ease the burdens of state.

1087
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:58,782
Eh, don't tug it, idiot! Well that's
very considerate of you, my dear.

1088
01:07:58,796 --> 01:08:00,959
I shall take advantage
of your delightful offer...

1089
01:08:01,072 --> 01:08:02,634
perhaps this evening?

1090
01:08:02,684 --> 01:08:03,838
Why tarry, sire?

1091
01:08:03,981 --> 01:08:06,955
I am most accomplished
on matters of appearance,

1092
01:08:07,189 --> 01:08:12,612
and would gladly free these young men
for more important chores, elsewhere.

1093
01:08:12,704 --> 01:08:15,232
Well that's very
kind of you, but...

1094
01:08:18,024 --> 01:08:19,970
oh, yes. Pages,

1095
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:23,831
I'm sure you have some very
important business to attend.

1096
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:29,165
Now, then, sire, we have to
get you ready for the ceremony!

1097
01:08:29,202 --> 01:08:31,153
Ah, but my dear...
- Now there.

1098
01:08:31,545 --> 01:08:34,319
You can't imagine my feelings,

1099
01:08:34,366 --> 01:08:39,107
when I touch the head of a man
who calles himself the king of England.

1100
01:08:39,497 --> 01:08:43,908
Who IS the King of England!
And very handsome, too, sire.

1101
01:08:44,074 --> 01:08:47,982
On the day of your first
tournament. There you are.

1102
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,270
Where?

1103
01:08:49,308 --> 01:08:50,318
Now I must go, sire.

1104
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:51,305
Oh, now wait, dear, wait.

1105
01:08:51,345 --> 01:08:53,148
Oh, no, you have to
get to your ceremony!

1106
01:08:53,187 --> 01:08:56,642
But there's no hurry. We can't
start until the jester's been made ready.

1107
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:57,700
The jester?!

1108
01:08:57,735 --> 01:08:59,700
Yes, haven't you heard?
We're knighting the poor fool.

1109
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:01,110
Knighting the jester!

1110
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:02,604
Yes, you'd
never guess why.

1111
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:04,195
So that he can
marry the princess.

1112
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:06,574
Well, that's the fool thinks,
but the moment I dub him knight,

1113
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,740
Griswold will challenge him
for the hand of my daughter.

1114
01:09:08,785 --> 01:09:09,743
Mortal combat.

1115
01:09:09,785 --> 01:09:12,499
Yes, isn't it delicious?
He dare not refuse,

1116
01:09:12,535 --> 01:09:16,108
they meet at lists, and Sir Griswold's
lance runs the jester through,

1117
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:18,516
as a fitting climax
to a glorious day.

1118
01:09:18,598 --> 01:09:21,657
Oh, my dear, you are a
delicate, lovely creature.

1119
01:09:21,927 --> 01:09:25,098
Tell me, does it bother you that I
may be a few years your senior?

1120
01:09:25,148 --> 01:09:27,046
Oh, no, sire, not really.

1121
01:09:27,154 --> 01:09:31,899
In fact, you remind me so much of my
dear and recently departed father.

1122
01:09:31,944 --> 01:09:32,848
Oh, your father, yes.

1123
01:09:32,883 --> 01:09:35,100
Well, was he a handsome figure
of a man? Dashing, effective...

1124
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:38,872
Oh, yes, sire, 'till the scourge
brought about his untimely end.

1125
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:40,897
Eh, come here, my dear.
- What a horrible death!

1126
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:41,959
A little closer...

1127
01:09:41,999 --> 01:09:45,203
I can see him now, writhing
on the floor in agony,

1128
01:09:45,242 --> 01:09:48,880
like so many of his brothers and
cousins and uncles and aunts...

1129
01:09:48,921 --> 01:09:50,533
Yes. Would you grant
the king a little kiss?

1130
01:09:50,577 --> 01:09:54,708
Oh, certainly, sire, and don't
worry. They say it isn't catching.

1131
01:09:54,749 --> 01:09:57,302
Oh, you are a little...

1132
01:09:58,176 --> 01:09:59,176
catching?

1133
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:03,523
Just because it runs in the family
doesn't mean that everyone has it.

1134
01:10:03,564 --> 01:10:04,528
Kiss me sire!

1135
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:06,133
Has it? Has what?

1136
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,439
Don't I please you, sire?

1137
01:10:07,474 --> 01:10:10,602
Oh, yes, yes, but, eh, these
brothers and cousins and uncles...

1138
01:10:10,637 --> 01:10:15,075
And aunts. Let us not talk about
their swollen, twisted, pain ridden bodies.

1139
01:10:15,112 --> 01:10:17,930
Hold me, take me in your
arms, tell me I am yours!

1140
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:19,875
But this, this uh
writhing on the floor...

1141
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:21,103
In agony.

1142
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,344
Yes, wh-what's... how
does one catch this thing?

1143
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,569
Oh, the touch of a hand,
the brush of a lip...

1144
01:10:25,603 --> 01:10:29,541
but let us not spoil this moment,
sire! Hold me, hold me close!

1145
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,360
W-what's this
monstrous thing called?

1146
01:10:31,404 --> 01:10:32,931
Breckenridge's scourge.

1147
01:10:33,303 --> 01:10:34,676
Who's Breckenridge?

1148
01:10:34,792 --> 01:10:36,081
My father.

1149
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:41,241
Excuse me, dear, I'm
feeling rather poorly.

1150
01:10:41,496 --> 01:10:42,996
Sire, the ceremony is ready.

1151
01:10:43,088 --> 01:10:47,254
Oh, very well. Ah, I must go, now,
my dear, and so must- so must you.

1152
01:10:47,303 --> 01:10:48,743
Quickly.

1153
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,978
Dear... don't touch me.

1154
01:11:08,065 --> 01:11:09,022
Where's the jester?

1155
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:10,683
Did you get the key?
- Yes, here it is.

1156
01:11:10,718 --> 01:11:12,737
It must be sent by pigeon
to the Black Fox at once!

1157
01:11:12,775 --> 01:11:15,495
Let the jester take it and
escape. They plan to kill him.

1158
01:11:15,532 --> 01:11:19,173
It'd never there in time.
The bird's our only chance.

1159
01:11:47,395 --> 01:11:53,337
He who approacheth, deem you
him worthy of noble knighthood?

1160
01:11:53,733 --> 01:11:56,947
Yea, verily, yea!

1161
01:11:58,104 --> 01:11:59,505
How many more
before the jester?

1162
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:00,690
Just this one, sire.

1163
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:06,502
...Fealty, loyalty, moisten his
lips with the vigorous wine.

1164
01:12:06,831 --> 01:12:12,732
Yea, verily, yea!

1165
01:12:15,509 --> 01:12:19,558
Now as the symbol
of honor and dignity,

1166
01:12:19,733 --> 01:12:24,166
let us beplume him
and helmet his brow.

1167
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:27,475
Yea, verily, yea!

1168
01:12:29,252 --> 01:12:31,532
Sire, this storm bodes ill.

1169
01:12:31,569 --> 01:12:33,660
It might drench the field
and delay the tournament.

1170
01:12:33,693 --> 01:12:36,511
Fetch the jester and run him through
the ritual as quickly as possible.

1171
01:12:36,546 --> 01:12:37,594
But sire, custom...

1172
01:12:37,633 --> 01:12:40,471
Custom be hanged! Fetch
him and run him through!

1173
01:12:44,844 --> 01:12:48,088
A message for the
jester. From the king.

1174
01:12:58,187 --> 01:13:00,429
He requests you
do this at once.

1175
01:13:00,472 --> 01:13:02,220
At w-once.

1176
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:37,989
He who approacheth, deem you
him ready for noble knighthood.

1177
01:13:38,405 --> 01:13:40,126
Yea! - Y-yea.

1178
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:44,501
Hath he passed all test of valor?

1179
01:13:45,059 --> 01:13:47,965
Yea, verily, yea!

1180
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:52,381
Now doth he flower with true nobility?

1181
01:13:52,906 --> 01:13:56,036
Yea, verily, yea!

1182
01:13:56,693 --> 01:13:59,946
Reveal him now to his sovereign liege.

1183
01:14:00,628 --> 01:14:04,180
Yea, verily, yea! Yea?

1184
01:14:04,217 --> 01:14:05,754
Faster. - Faster.
- Faster.

1185
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:10,696
B-but I!

1186
01:14:10,749 --> 01:14:13,188
...Fealty, loyalty, moisten his
lips with the vigorous wine.

1187
01:14:15,301 --> 01:14:17,168
Now  will he pledge to his
fealty, loyalty, courage,

1188
01:14:17,211 --> 01:14:19,010
and vigor and valor
and strength! - Yea!

1189
01:14:19,203 --> 01:14:22,226
Now as the symbol of honor and dignity,
let us beplume him and helmet his brow.

1190
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:24,994
Yea, verily, yea!
Yea, verily, yea!

1191
01:14:25,218 --> 01:14:27,041
He who is girded and
plumed and helmeted,

1192
01:14:27,077 --> 01:14:28,894
Let him prepare...

1193
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:08,500
Considering the virtuous
fidelity you have shown,

1194
01:16:08,535 --> 01:16:10,587
and the honorable exploits
that you have done,

1195
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:13,937
having given proof of that honor,
having given proof of that honor...

1196
01:16:14,148 --> 01:16:16,853
as always as is the part of
a good and faithful subject,

1197
01:16:16,889 --> 01:16:19,404
I hereby dub thee
knight of the realm,

1198
01:16:19,549 --> 01:16:21,792
defender of the soil,
protector of the crown,

1199
01:16:21,848 --> 01:16:24,893
and a fit consort for the
princess Gwendolyn the fair.

1200
01:16:24,929 --> 01:16:26,965
Arise, Sir Giacomo.

1201
01:16:27,919 --> 01:16:31,310
Now, if  any knight present
objects to this marriage,

1202
01:16:31,346 --> 01:16:35,205
let him now step forward
or forever hold his tongue.

1203
01:16:37,095 --> 01:16:38,370
I.

1204
01:16:39,193 --> 01:16:41,615
I, Griswold of Mackalwane
do so object.

1205
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:42,610
Very good,
'dya hear that, sire?

1206
01:16:42,645 --> 01:16:44,853
I too love the princess and
would fight for her heart.

1207
01:16:44,898 --> 01:16:47,139
I hereby challenge in
mortal combat Giacomo!

1208
01:16:47,173 --> 01:16:51,834
Giacomo! Knight of the
realm! Defender of the soil!

1209
01:16:51,863 --> 01:16:53,787
And protector of the crown!

1210
01:16:53,821 --> 01:16:54,975
Woo!

1211
01:16:58,084 --> 01:17:00,137
You won't have to fight,
I'll send a message,

1212
01:17:00,194 --> 01:17:02,049
the Black Fox will come
and fight in your place!

1213
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,022
The Black Fox?

1214
01:17:03,075 --> 01:17:05,378
Get up, accept
the challenge!

1215
01:17:09,316 --> 01:17:12,700
Uh... Black Fox,
huh? Eh...

1216
01:17:12,735 --> 01:17:15,068
he'll come and fight
in my place? - Yes.

1217
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:17,963
You're sure he'll come?

1218
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,717
Well, if it's mortal combat you want,
then mortal combat you shall have,

1219
01:17:23,758 --> 01:17:27,100
and at the hands of Giacomo,
knight of the realm,

1220
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:29,714
defender of the soil,
protector of the crown...

1221
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:32,342
protector of the crown!

1222
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:33,540
Oo, oh.

1223
01:17:35,045 --> 01:17:38,752
Good stock.
Good battle. Good bye!

1224
01:17:41,652 --> 01:17:44,457
Your escorts to see
you safely to the lists.

1225
01:17:45,421 --> 01:17:46,768
The the lists?

1226
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,187
Very clever, father.

1227
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:55,083
Well, chivalry is
chivalry, you know.

1228
01:17:55,235 --> 01:17:56,602
Yes, I know.

1229
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:58,112
May the best man win.

1230
01:18:02,579 --> 01:18:06,267
Remember this..
if he dies, you die.

1231
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:15,937
To the Fox, at once!

1232
01:18:26,824 --> 01:18:28,826
We have bigger game.

1233
01:18:33,528 --> 01:18:34,910
Get him!

1234
01:18:40,941 --> 01:18:43,095
Griswold has challenged the
jester to mortal combat.

1235
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,059
The jester! - Yes

1236
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:46,909
The maid Jean requests that
you come and fight in his stead.

1237
01:18:49,473 --> 01:18:51,945
The timbers have fallen and
great rocks block the passage!

1238
01:18:52,005 --> 01:18:53,700
Can it be cleared?
- Impossible!

1239
01:18:53,737 --> 01:18:55,672
With no passage, we
can make no diversion,

1240
01:18:55,715 --> 01:18:57,664
and with no
diversion, no attack!

1241
01:18:57,722 --> 01:18:59,124
Is there any opening?

1242
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:01,807
No more than that, sir.
Barely enough for a child!

1243
01:19:01,828 --> 01:19:04,131
A child, a child...

1244
01:19:04,168 --> 01:19:06,863
or perhaps...! My horse!

1245
01:19:06,869 --> 01:19:08,096
Where go you?
To save Hawkins?

1246
01:19:08,129 --> 01:19:09,441
No, to save England!

1247
01:19:09,485 --> 01:19:10,565
Then Hawkins must die!

1248
01:19:10,609 --> 01:19:12,465
Yes. But if my plan succeeds,

1249
01:19:12,466 --> 01:19:15,863
I assure you, Hubert Hawkins
will not have died in vain!

1250
01:19:31,723 --> 01:19:35,169
By order of his sovereign lord
highness, King Roderick the First,

1251
01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:39,008
this royal tournament
is officially begun!

1252
01:19:39,282 --> 01:19:40,864
Where's the Black Fox
What's delayed him?

1253
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:43,740
There's rain in the hills,
perhaps the river is swollen.

1254
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:46,762
He'll be taking the coast road.
You better have a look.

1255
01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:52,997
Good stock.

1256
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:57,335
The first contest will be
a battle to the death

1257
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,375
for the hand of
the fair Gwendolyn.

1258
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,986
It will be fought by Sir Griswold of
Mackalwane and Sir Giacomo of Italy.

1259
01:20:04,568 --> 01:20:07,483
These two bold knights
will choose weapons,

1260
01:20:07,484 --> 01:20:09,402
and enter upon
the field of honor,

1261
01:20:09,544 --> 01:20:14,043
and fight in mortal combat
until one of them lies dead.

1262
01:20:14,082 --> 01:20:15,369
Run for your life.

1263
01:20:15,568 --> 01:20:18,445
No, they'd... they'd only
catch me and kill me.

1264
01:20:18,589 --> 01:20:20,091
Can you ever forgive me?

1265
01:20:20,304 --> 01:20:22,054
There's nothing to forgive.

1266
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:24,100
Dear Hawkins.

1267
01:20:24,135 --> 01:20:26,307
Sir Giacomo! You
should be in armor!

1268
01:20:26,377 --> 01:20:28,350
And you, maid
Jean, in the stands.

1269
01:20:28,473 --> 01:20:31,354
If I die, just pray
that I die bravely.

1270
01:20:31,389 --> 01:20:33,517
You'll not die, you'll
not have to fight him.

1271
01:20:33,518 --> 01:20:35,397
Griswold dies as
he drinks the toast.

1272
01:20:35,432 --> 01:20:36,479
What?

1273
01:20:36,524 --> 01:20:39,264
Listen. I have put a pellet of
poison in one of the vessels.

1274
01:20:39,299 --> 01:20:41,460
Which one? - The one with
the figure of a pestle.

1275
01:20:41,495 --> 01:20:42,801
The vessel with
the pestle? - Yes.

1276
01:20:42,866 --> 01:20:44,400
But you don't want the
vessel with the pestle,

1277
01:20:44,435 --> 01:20:46,060
you want the chalice
from the palace!

1278
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:47,300
I-I don't want the
vessel with the pestle,

1279
01:20:47,335 --> 01:20:48,383
I want the chalice
from the what?

1280
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:49,600
The chalice from the palace!

1281
01:20:49,635 --> 01:20:51,912
It's a little crystal chalice
with a figure of a palace.

1282
01:20:51,952 --> 01:20:53,600
Th-the chalice from the palace
have the pellet with the poison?

1283
01:20:53,635 --> 01:20:55,412
No, the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle.

1284
01:20:55,452 --> 01:20:56,450
Oh, oh, the pestle
with the vessel.

1285
01:20:56,486 --> 01:20:57,501
The vessel with the pestle.

1286
01:20:57,536 --> 01:20:58,698
What about the palace
from the chalice?

1287
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:01,300
Not the palace from the chalice!
The chalice from the palace!

1288
01:21:01,335 --> 01:21:02,381
Where's the pellet
with the poison?

1289
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:03,567
In the vessel with the pestle!

1290
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,283
Don't you see? The pellet with the
poison's in the vessel with the pestle.

1291
01:21:06,318 --> 01:21:08,428
The chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true!

1292
01:21:08,467 --> 01:21:09,647
It's so easy, I can say it!

1293
01:21:09,688 --> 01:21:10,710
Well then you fight him!

1294
01:21:10,752 --> 01:21:12,064
Listen carefully.

1295
01:21:12,224 --> 01:21:14,212
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1296
01:21:14,255 --> 01:21:16,539
the chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.

1297
01:21:16,578 --> 01:21:18,711
Where the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1298
01:21:18,746 --> 01:21:20,546
the chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.

1299
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:22,340
Good man!
- Just remember that.

1300
01:21:22,436 --> 01:21:23,693
Sir Giacomo!

1301
01:21:23,707 --> 01:21:25,276
Sir Giacomo, into your armor!

1302
01:21:25,311 --> 01:21:26,898
And you, to your
place in the pavilion.

1303
01:21:30,961 --> 01:21:32,222
The pellet with the poison...

1304
01:21:32,819 --> 01:21:34,663
the pellet with the poison is
in the vessel with the pestle,

1305
01:21:34,699 --> 01:21:36,660
the chalice from the palace
has the true that is brew. Eh...

1306
01:21:37,735 --> 01:21:39,064
brew that is tru-

1307
01:21:39,655 --> 01:21:42,031
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1308
01:21:42,193 --> 01:21:44,974
the chalice from the palace
has the true that is brew.

1309
01:21:45,099 --> 01:21:46,813
Eh, brew that is true. Eh.

1310
01:21:46,849 --> 01:21:49,353
The chestle with the pal- eh,
eh, palace with the...

1311
01:21:49,389 --> 01:21:50,585
Look out!

1312
01:21:56,805 --> 01:21:59,041
Hurry, now, get
into your armor!

1313
01:21:59,971 --> 01:22:01,197
The pestle with t...

1314
01:22:01,521 --> 01:22:03,830
the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1315
01:22:03,892 --> 01:22:06,116
the palace from the chalice
has the brew that is blue.

1316
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:07,510
Eh, no...

1317
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:10,535
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle.

1318
01:22:10,861 --> 01:22:14,005
The cha- eh, the
pellet with the plip...

1319
01:22:14,169 --> 01:22:16,868
the pellet with the poisle's in
the vessel with the plazzle.

1320
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:19,381
Eh, the plazzle with the
vlessle. Eh, the the bless...

1321
01:22:20,456 --> 01:22:22,809
The vessel with the plozle
is the plazzle with the...

1322
01:22:22,844 --> 01:22:24,345
Come along, Sir Giacomo.
His majesty is waiting.

1323
01:22:24,381 --> 01:22:25,786
The pestle with the poilet...

1324
01:22:25,809 --> 01:22:27,804
And take your helmet!

1325
01:22:28,675 --> 01:22:30,005
Thank you.

1326
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:36,040
The pellet with the poisley's
from chalice with the pazley.

1327
01:22:39,442 --> 01:22:41,523
Oh, hello, my dear,
it's nice to see y-

1328
01:22:48,114 --> 01:22:50,459
I've got it!
I've got it.

1329
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:52,125
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1330
01:22:52,161 --> 01:22:54,256
the chalice from the palace has
the brew that is true, right?

1331
01:22:54,301 --> 01:22:56,251
Right. But there's
been a change.

1332
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:58,199
They broke the chalice
from the palace.

1333
01:22:58,298 --> 01:23:00,213
They broke the chalice
from the palace?

1334
01:23:00,253 --> 01:23:01,523
And replaced it with a flagon.

1335
01:23:01,568 --> 01:23:03,208
Flagon.
- With a figure of a dragon.

1336
01:23:03,215 --> 01:23:04,547
Flagon with a
dragon. - Right.

1337
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:07,135
Did you put the pellet with the
poison in the vessel with the pestle?

1338
01:23:07,177 --> 01:23:09,830
No! The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon,

1339
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:11,934
the vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true!

1340
01:23:11,976 --> 01:23:13,620
The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon,

1341
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:15,241
the vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true.

1342
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,219
Just remember that.

1343
01:23:16,266 --> 01:23:18,891
Yes, thank you very much.
The pellet with the chasley,

1344
01:23:19,043 --> 01:23:22,165
eh... the pellet with the poison is
in the pasley with the chazzle.

1345
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:23,966
Eh, just remember that.

1346
01:23:25,067 --> 01:23:27,732
Beware of the drinks.
One of them is poisoned.

1347
01:23:27,768 --> 01:23:29,000
Poisoned! Are you sure?

1348
01:23:29,035 --> 01:23:30,094
I heard the witch.

1349
01:23:30,134 --> 01:23:32,303
The poisel with the
plesley is the chaz... eh...

1350
01:23:32,338 --> 01:23:34,702
The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon,

1351
01:23:34,737 --> 01:23:35,982
the pestle with the pizzle...

1352
01:23:36,035 --> 01:23:38,300
the pizzle with the f- the,
the, the viss... - No, no, no...

1353
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:41,639
The pellet with the poisley
is the chalice with the... he he

1354
01:23:43,182 --> 01:23:44,252
...Vessel with the pestle.

1355
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,745
The vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true.

1356
01:23:46,811 --> 01:23:48,340
Right. Don't forget it.

1357
01:23:48,567 --> 01:23:50,891
The palace with the
dragon... no, no, no.

1358
01:23:51,147 --> 01:23:53,185
The knights will
approach each other!

1359
01:23:56,987 --> 01:23:59,980
The pellet with the poisle is
in the flaggle with the chalice.

1360
01:24:00,015 --> 01:24:02,139
The poison's in the
dragon with the pestle.

1361
01:24:02,183 --> 01:24:06,378
Eh, ah, the chazzle is in the poisley
with the plellice with the plan- eh, plaglice.

1362
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,643
The pellet with the dragon's
in the pestle with the poi-

1363
01:24:08,679 --> 01:24:09,876
The pezley with the poisle is...

1364
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:11,888
The dragon with the
poisle's in the pestle...

1365
01:24:11,924 --> 01:24:12,936
Pazzle with the fleegle...

1366
01:24:12,984 --> 01:24:14,974
The poisley with the plazzle
is the plazzle with the ploizle

1367
01:24:15,012 --> 01:24:17,252
The chalice with the pa...
the flagon with the cha...

1368
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,809
the floizle with the flagon is
the chalice with the poison.

1369
01:24:19,882 --> 01:24:22,301
The knights will face the king!

1370
01:24:29,933 --> 01:24:32,518
They will approach
the royal pavilion!

1371
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:43,613
The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon!

1372
01:24:43,659 --> 01:24:47,131
The vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true!

1373
01:24:47,192 --> 01:24:49,015
Oh, no, pglk, you've
got the wrong one!

1374
01:24:49,524 --> 01:24:51,974
Stop this mockery!
There will be no toast!

1375
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:55,196
Put them to horse, let them
choose weapons, and fight!

1376
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,283
This is the Black Fox?

1377
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,576
And still playing the fool.

1378
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:14,925
Sir Griswold! Declare
a choice of weapon!

1379
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:16,582
Mace and chain!

1380
01:25:16,621 --> 01:25:19,878
Sir Giacomo! Declare
a choice of weapon.

1381
01:25:22,054 --> 01:25:24,404
I'll take one of those,
one of those,

1382
01:25:24,507 --> 01:25:26,783
eh, a couple of
those.. and..

1383
01:25:28,535 --> 01:25:30,293
I better take them all.

1384
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:33,277
Mace and chain
for him, too!

1385
01:25:34,674 --> 01:25:36,223
Charge!

1386
01:25:48,334 --> 01:25:51,656
Take that horse and put
it back under that idiot!

1387
01:25:52,715 --> 01:25:54,240
Unfasten that perch!

1388
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:56,930
Charge!

1389
01:27:26,993 --> 01:27:29,857
All right, Sir Griswold,
prepare to die!

1390
01:27:29,895 --> 01:27:34,709
Go ahead, sir knight. Slay me!
You won in fair combat. Strike!

1391
01:27:34,751 --> 01:27:39,481
Let rivers of blood wash away
the stain of my disgrace! Go on!

1392
01:27:39,537 --> 01:27:42,280
Spew the field with
my dishonored guts!

1393
01:27:43,751 --> 01:27:44,968
No!

1394
01:27:46,435 --> 01:27:49,006
No, I cannot slay a
man whose only crime,

1395
01:27:49,037 --> 01:27:52,274
is that he loved not
too wisely but too well.

1396
01:27:52,374 --> 01:27:56,134
I grant your life!
Take your men, and go!

1397
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:03,767
Fergus is dead.

1398
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:05,401
Did he talk?

1399
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:08,783
The child?
In the castle?

1400
01:28:09,923 --> 01:28:12,095
Now listen carefully,
there's little time...

1401
01:28:27,784 --> 01:28:31,568
Sir Giacomo, I declare
you winner of this combat,

1402
01:28:33,647 --> 01:28:36,327
and I hereby decree that you
shall marry the Princess Gwendolyn.

1403
01:28:36,367 --> 01:28:38,887
Hold, sire!
Seize this traitor!

1404
01:28:38,924 --> 01:28:41,087
Traitor? What's this?
How say you, Ravenhurst?

1405
01:28:41,127 --> 01:28:42,662
I say traitor, sire!

1406
01:28:42,699 --> 01:28:45,100
And I shall prove to you that
this man who stands before us,

1407
01:28:45,136 --> 01:28:47,945
is neither Giacomo nor jester,
but your deadly enemy,

1408
01:28:47,984 --> 01:28:50,349
the leader of the rabble who
have sworn to have your head,

1409
01:28:50,412 --> 01:28:51,557
the Black Fox himself!

1410
01:28:51,615 --> 01:28:53,036
The Black Fox?

1411
01:28:53,099 --> 01:28:57,015
And this demure maid
his foul accomplice!

1412
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:59,856
Ravenhurst, are you mad? Have
you proof of this foul treachery?

1413
01:28:59,892 --> 01:29:00,864
I have, sire.

1414
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,212
Then repair to the court!
Summon the judges!

1415
01:29:03,253 --> 01:29:04,651
If what you say be true,

1416
01:29:04,702 --> 01:29:08,347
the headsman's axe will not only
rid us of this jabbering popinjay,

1417
01:29:08,632 --> 01:29:11,004
but will sever this
lovely little head,

1418
01:29:11,712 --> 01:29:13,697
from this delicate little neck..

1419
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:15,999
oh. To the castle!

1420
01:29:21,455 --> 01:29:23,380
Hurry along, little friends.

1421
01:29:24,173 --> 01:29:26,789
Hurry along!
Keep your heads down.

1422
01:29:27,856 --> 01:29:30,121
Come along, there,
men! All of you!

1423
01:29:30,178 --> 01:29:33,522
We'll take the coast road,
but stay close to the trees!

1424
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:39,879
And I say again,
sire! Never, sire,

1425
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:41,974
never was there
such infamous treason.

1426
01:29:42,185 --> 01:29:44,265
Not only is this
man the Black Fox,

1427
01:29:44,353 --> 01:29:48,584
but he and his despicable accomplice,
have the shameful effrontery,

1428
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:51,552
to shelter in this castle,
the miserable child,

1429
01:29:51,592 --> 01:29:53,632
they would put on
your very throne!

1430
01:29:53,669 --> 01:29:56,030
What's this?
What say you, Ravenhurst?

1431
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:59,317
I repeat, sire. The child they
would put on your throne.

1432
01:29:59,405 --> 01:30:01,371
The child...

1433
01:30:01,702 --> 01:30:03,110
with the purple pimpernel?

1434
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:06,648
The very same, sire.
Bring forth the basket!

1435
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,114
Let me see this
fraud, this charlatan.

1436
01:30:09,776 --> 01:30:12,287
Hurry up, hurry up,
bring it here.

1437
01:30:12,381 --> 01:30:13,536
In a moment, sire.

1438
01:30:13,571 --> 01:30:17,739
But first let me hear you pronounce
sentence on this unholy pair.

1439
01:30:17,983 --> 01:30:22,411
I know how anxious you are to
dispose of this villainous scum,

1440
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:25,310
so that you may proceed
with the feast and the revelry.

1441
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:27,820
Sire, I accuse these impostors

1442
01:30:27,862 --> 01:30:30,937
of the foulest and most loathsome
crime against the crown,

1443
01:30:30,975 --> 01:30:32,503
and I demand,

1444
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:35,224
that they be given the full
measure of your righteous wrath,

1445
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:38,594
and shall be disposed of
before another hour is past.

1446
01:30:38,948 --> 01:30:44,060
I tell you, sire, the headsman's axe is
too kind a fate for these foul traitors.

1447
01:30:44,192 --> 01:30:47,607
They should be put on a spit,
and roasted like yon boar!

1448
01:30:47,654 --> 01:30:49,793
Yes, yes, death
to both of them.

1449
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:52,354
Father, I say
Ravenhurst lies.

1450
01:30:52,395 --> 01:30:55,909
This is Giacomo, king of jesters,
and never the Black Fox.

1451
01:30:56,156 --> 01:30:59,560
Nay, fair lady. For once,
Ravenhurst is right.

1452
01:30:59,608 --> 01:31:02,553
I am. I am the
Black Fox!

1453
01:31:15,627 --> 01:31:17,268
Seize that traitor!

1454
01:31:31,184 --> 01:31:34,645
Ravenhurst! Ravenhurst!
Do something! Do something!

1455
01:31:39,802 --> 01:31:42,298
Quickly, fetch Griswold!
Bring him back!

1456
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:24,889
Take him to safety!

1457
01:32:56,183 --> 01:32:58,518
Arm him. I must
raise the gate!

1458
01:33:29,138 --> 01:33:30,802
Quick, Lower the gate!

1459
01:33:30,837 --> 01:33:33,622
The gate is lowered!
- No it isn't! Look!

1460
01:34:42,894 --> 01:34:45,491
If he dies, you die.

1461
01:34:56,403 --> 01:34:59,842
Tails of lizards, ears of swine,
chicken gizzard soaked in brine,

1462
01:34:59,884 --> 01:35:04,149
on your feet, be not afraid,
you're the greatest with a blade!

1463
01:35:22,171 --> 01:35:24,052
Heh heh.

1464
01:35:26,573 --> 01:35:27,885
Hey!

1465
01:35:43,234 --> 01:35:45,639
Play games with the
Black Fox, will you?

1466
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:47,834
At this very moment,
my dear Ravenhurst,

1467
01:35:47,879 --> 01:35:52,450
your life isn't worth that!

1468
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:09,137
Now my gallant fox, we'll see
whose life isn't worth that!

1469
01:36:10,122 --> 01:36:12,016
We shall, indeed! Hey ya!

1470
01:36:28,313 --> 01:36:30,112
With your permission?

1471
01:36:30,148 --> 01:36:32,493
Why you swine...

1472
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:37,983
Your health.

1473
01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:40,257
Oo, you...

1474
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:47,221
And now, Ravenhurst,
you rat catcher!

1475
01:37:12,811 --> 01:37:15,953
Well, my dear Ravenhurst,
our little game draws to an end.

1476
01:37:16,097 --> 01:37:20,014
I have toyed with you
long enough. You shall die.

1477
01:37:20,218 --> 01:37:22,833
And die like that! Ehh!

1478
01:38:11,783 --> 01:38:14,028
Hurry! Help the Fox!

1479
01:38:15,273 --> 01:38:17,733
Jean. - Oh! Hawkins,
are you all right?

1480
01:38:17,769 --> 01:38:19,144
Never mind me.
Where's the child?

1481
01:38:19,188 --> 01:38:20,826
Safe. -Good.

1482
01:38:20,971 --> 01:38:22,824
You've been wonderful.

1483
01:38:23,405 --> 01:38:26,587
How convenient.
The Fox and his mate!

1484
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:30,148
So my friends, the tables
have turned yet again.

1485
01:38:30,183 --> 01:38:32,088
But this time for
the last time,

1486
01:38:32,259 --> 01:38:36,956
and not only for one, but
for two! What a prize!

1487
01:38:51,053 --> 01:38:52,835
Griswold!

1488
01:38:53,997 --> 01:38:56,604
They'll cut us to
ribbons. We've lost.

1489
01:38:56,841 --> 01:38:58,806
Hold there! Hold!

1490
01:38:59,175 --> 01:39:03,491
Let no more English blood
be spilled! Victory is ours!

1491
01:39:04,956 --> 01:39:09,183
Not so fast! Unhand
the king, and surrender!

1492
01:39:09,291 --> 01:39:13,324
Never! - Then die as
traitors to the crown!

1493
01:39:14,872 --> 01:39:18,687
Hold, Sir Griswold!
Hold your men!

1494
01:39:22,794 --> 01:39:26,038
Sir Griswold, I speak to
you as knight to knight.

1495
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:28,022
When you were dubbed,
you pledged your hand,

1496
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:31,662
your heart and your sword to
defend the true king of England.

1497
01:39:32,057 --> 01:39:33,859
Is that right? - Well?

1498
01:39:34,346 --> 01:39:35,921
This man is not
the true king.

1499
01:39:36,065 --> 01:39:38,741
He has usurped the throne
from the legitimate heir.

1500
01:39:38,785 --> 01:39:40,389
Heir? What heir?

1501
01:39:40,415 --> 01:39:42,752
He who bears the mark
of the royal bloodline.

1502
01:39:42,921 --> 01:39:44,400
The purple pimpernel!

1503
01:39:44,435 --> 01:39:45,775
- The purple pimpernel?

1504
01:39:45,801 --> 01:39:49,745
That's balderdash.
No such person exists!

1505
01:40:10,263 --> 01:40:12,014
Your majesty!

1506
01:40:17,036 --> 01:40:18,786
Your majesty!

1507
01:40:22,819 --> 01:40:24,621
Your majesty!

1508
01:40:25,871 --> 01:40:28,099
Your majesty!

1509
01:40:33,443 --> 01:40:38,881
The real king is on the throne,
Jean is my very own,

1510
01:40:40,253 --> 01:40:42,563
and life couldn't possibly,

1511
01:40:42,866 --> 01:40:45,264
not even probably,

1512
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:51,828
life couldn't possibly better

1513
01:40:52,165 --> 01:40:54,723
be!
