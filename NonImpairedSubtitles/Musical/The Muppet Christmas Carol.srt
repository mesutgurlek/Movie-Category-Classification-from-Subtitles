Hello. Welcome to
the Muppet Christmas Carol.

00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,978
I am here to tell the story.

29
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,814
And I am here for the food.

30
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:02,683
My name is Charles Dickens.

31
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,746
And my name is Rizzo the Rat.

32
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,520
Wait a second,
you're not Charles Dickens.

33

I am, too.

34
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:11,886
A blue furry Charles Dickens
who hangs out with a rat?

35
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:13,090
Absolutely.

36
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:15,963
Charles Dickens
was a 19th century novelist.

37
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:17,263
A genius.

38
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:19,133
You are too kind.

39
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:21,105
Why should I believe you?

40
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:24,768
Because I know the story of <i>A Christmas</i>
<i>Carol like the back of my hand.</i>

41
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:27,039
- Prove it.
- All right.

42
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:29,479
There's a little mole on my thumb.

43
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:33,040
And a scar on my wrist
from when I fell off my bicycle...

44
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:36,054
No, don't tell us your hand,
tell us the story.

00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,215
Oh, thank you. Yes.

46
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,418
The Marleys were dead,
to begin with.

47

The... Pardon me?

48
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,491
That's how the story begins,

49
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:46,963
"The Marleys were dead,
to begin with."

50
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:49,466
As dead as a doornail.

51
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,936
It's a good beginning.
It's creepy and kind of... spooky.

- Thank you, Rizzo.
- You're welcome, Mr. Dickens.

53
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:58,539
In life, the Marleys had been
business partners

54
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:03,014
with a shrewd moneylender
named Ebenezer Scrooge.

55
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:06,176
You will meet him
as he comes around that corner.

56
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,549
- Where?
- There.

57
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,713
- When?
- Now.

58
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:15,115
[Dickens] There he is,
Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:21,494
The bookkeeping staff would like to have
an extra shovel of coal for the fire.

161
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,593
- We can't do the bookkeeping.
- Our pens are like ink-cicles.

162
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,501
Our assets are frozen.

163
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:30,372
How would the bookkeepers
like to be suddenly unemployed?

164
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:32,273
[All] Heat wave!

165
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:35,802
[All sing]
This is my island in the sun!

166
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:39,214
I, I believe you've convinced them
once again, Mr. Scrooge.

167
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:45,219
At that moment,
who should arrive at the door

168
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,386
but Scrooge's nephew, Fred.
His only living relative.

169
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:51,952
- Nephew Fred? I don't see him.
- Trust me.

170
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,592
Hello? Uncle?

171
00:10:57,803 --> 00:10:58,792
Rizzo?

172
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:01,305
You're very good at that, Mr. Dickens.

173
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:04,638
A merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge.
God save you.

174
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,302
Merry Christmas?

175
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:08,642
Bah. Humbug!

176
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,705
Quick, it'll be warmer in there.

177
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:18,550
Christmas a humbug, Uncle?
You don't mean that, surely.

178
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:20,649
Actually, I think it's colder in here.

179
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:23,627
Merry Christmas, you say?
What right have you to be merry?

180
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:25,185
You're poor enough.

181
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:27,425
And you to be dismal?
You're rich enough.

182
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,660
He's got him.
The old boy's speechless.

183
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,794
If I could work my will,

184
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,033
every idiot who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips

185
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,938
would be cooked with his own turkey

186
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,069
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.

187
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:41,976
Well, not quite speechless.

188
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:43,537
- Uncle...
- Nephew.

189
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:47,483
You keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.

190
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:51,489
Christmas is a loving,
honest and charitable time.

191
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:55,084
And though it's never put
a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket,

192
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,890
I believe Christmas has done me good
and will do me good,

193
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,624
and I say, God bless it.

194
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,495
[Workers cheer]

195
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:05,401
And how does one celebrate Christmas
on the unemployment line?

196
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:10,642
Now, in these times,
it was customary on Christmas Eve

197
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,405
for well-meaning gentlemen
to call upon businesses,

198
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:17,175
collecting donations
for the poor and homeless.

199
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,874
Mr. Scrooge, I presume?

200
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,385
[High-pitched squeak]

201
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:23,581
Who are you?

202
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:27,352
We're from the Order of Victoria
Charity Foundation.

203
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:30,224
We'd like to speak to you
about a donation.

204
00:12:30,295 --> 00:12:32,229
Ah! Welcome!

205
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:34,891
This jolly old gentleman here
is Mr. Scrooge.

206
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,333
He's very generous to charities.

207
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:38,926
My dear nephew!

208
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:42,064
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge,

209
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,440
many of us feel we must
take care of our poor and homeless.

210
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:49,071
Are there no prisons?
No poor houses?

211
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:51,411
Oh, plenty of those, sir.

212
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,144
Oh. Excellent.

213
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:55,015
For a moment, I was worried.

214
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:59,353
Some of us are endeavoring to raise
a fund for the poor and homeless.

215
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:01,824
What might I put you down for?

216
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:02,917
Nothing.

217
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:07,056
- You wish to remain anonymous?
- I wish to be left alone.

218
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:09,191
I do not make merry myself
for Christmas.

219
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:10,360
That certainly is true.

220
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:12,470
I cannot afford
to make idle people merry.

221
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:14,095
That is certainly not true.

222
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,800
Don't you have other things to do
this afternoon?

223
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,333
Sadly, I do, Uncle.
So I shall make my donation.

224
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:23,040
And leave you to make yours.

225
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:24,844
Thank you so very much.

226
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:29,080
Oh, Uncle, come and have Christmas
dinner with me and Clara tomorrow.

227
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:30,985
Why ever did you get married?

228
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:33,081
Why? Because I fell in love.

229
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,183
[Laughs]

230
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,525
That's the only thing in the world
sillier than a merry Christmas.

231
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:41,464
It's no use, I shall keep
my Christmas humor to the last.

232
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,969
A merry Christmas to you.
And a happy New Year.

233
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,437
- Merry Christmas, Fred.
- Merry Christmas, Bob.

234
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:48,837
Humbug!

235
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:51,838
[Softly] Ahem.

236
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,310
[Clock ticks]

237
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:03,083
Now, then, sir, about the...

238
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:04,850
donation.

239
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:07,422
Well, now.

240
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:09,221
Let's see.

241
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:13,454
I know how to treat the poor.

242
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:16,968
My taxes go to pay for the prisons
and the poorhouses.

243
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:19,799
- The homeless must go there.
- But some would rather die.

244
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:22,465
If they'd rather die,
then they'd better do it,

245
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,532
and decrease the surplus population.

246
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:27,271
- [Squeaks]
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

247
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:31,248
This is the door, you may use it.

248
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:33,181
All right, Beaker, come along.

249
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:37,187
I think we've taken enough
of Mr. Scrooge's time.

250
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:40,156
- [Beaker squeaks]
- Oh, dear. Dear, dear.

[clears throat] Excuse me, Mr. Scrooge,
but it appears to be closing time.

263
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:38,076
Very well. I'll see you
at eight tomorrow morning.

Um... Tomorrow's Christmas.

00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,919
- 8:30, then.
- [Workers sigh]

267
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,389
If you please, sir,

268
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,359
half an hour off hardly seems customary
for Christmas Day.

269
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:52,363
- [Worker] No.
- [Worker 2] Hardly customary.

270
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:55,195
How much time off is customary,
Mr. Cratchit?

Um... Why, um, the, er, whole day.

- Yeah, that's right.
- The whole day.

The entire day?

- No.
- That's the frog's idea.

275
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:07,503
If you please,
why open the office tomorrow?

276
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:11,071
Other businesses will be closed.
You'll have no one to do business with.

277
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:14,607
It'll waste a lot of expensive coal
for the fire.

278
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:17,849
- That's definitely a point.
- That's a point.

- Missed.
- [Growls]

475
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:16,187
Wait a second.
I forgot my jelly beans.

476
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,318
Um...

477
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:26,261
What?

478
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:28,168
You can fit through those bars?

479
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,763
Yeah.

480
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,239
You are such an idiot.

481
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,243
What, what? Hey, what?

482
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:35,039
What?

483
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:36,636
[Rizzo whispers] What?

484
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:43,987
[Scrooge breathes heavily]

485
00:30:45,523 --> 00:30:47,286
[Ticking]

486
00:30:50,494 --> 00:30:52,086
[Rizzo] Oh, dear.

487
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:56,532
Scrooge slipped into the empty silence
of a dreamless sleep.

488
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,058
You know, a guy could break his tail
falling out of this tree.

489
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:02,128
Want to see what's going on, don't you?

490
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:04,333
- Yes.
- There's Scrooge's window.

491
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:06,205
Oh, yeah.

492
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:08,108
[Clock ticks]

493
00:31:08,913 --> 00:31:11,074
[Clock whirs, chimes]

494
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:19,254
[Ding]

495
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:30,426
Expect the first ghost
when the bell tolls one!

496
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:34,966
Wow! Ouch.

497
00:31:56,427 --> 00:31:59,726
Are you the spirit
whose coming was foretold to me?

498
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:01,025
I am.

499
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:05,592
But... you're just a child.

500
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:08,832
I can remember nearly 1,900 years.

501
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:12,069
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

502
00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:13,906
What business has brought you here?

503
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:16,674
- Your welfare.
- Huh.

504
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:19,409
A night's unbroken rest
might aid my welfare.

505
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:21,678
Your salvation, then.

506
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:24,448
Take heed. Come.

507
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:33,228
I beg you, spirit, I am mortal.
I'm liable to fall.

508
00:32:33,297 --> 00:32:36,630
A touch of my hand, and you shall fly.

509
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,533
- What are we doing?
- Nothing.

510
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,237
- What?
- Just hold on.

511
00:32:48,312 --> 00:32:50,405
[Rizzo screams]

512
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:55,477
- Watch out, Rizzo.
- What? Oh!

513
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:58,579
[Dickens laughs] Whee!

514
00:32:59,256 --> 00:33:01,053
Hello, London!

515
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,150
[Rizzo] Goodbye, lunch!

516
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:06,855
[Pants] Spirit?

517
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:08,757
Yes?

518
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,528
Nothing.

519
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:14,634
- Look, Rizzo.
- I don't want to look.

520
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:17,503
Spirit? What is that light?

521
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:20,941
It cannot be dawn.

522
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:23,309
[Spirit] It is the past.

523
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,078
Look, it's beautiful, Rizzo.

524
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:31,451
[Rizzo] Mommy!

525
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:40,587
Hey, we're going down.

526
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:43,632
Hang on, Rizzo.

527
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,397
- [Woman screams]
- [Dickens] Sorry, madam.

528
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,404
- [Man grunts]
- [Rizzo] Pardon me, sir.

529
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:50,303
[Dickens] Look out, Rizzo.

530
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,503
Rizzo, this is Louise.

531
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,570
Yeah, we've met.

532
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:11,353
And so they arrived
in Ebenezer Scrooge's childhood.

533
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:13,828
That was the worst trip of my life.

534
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:15,263
It's over now.

535
00:34:15,332 --> 00:34:18,392
- Yeah, safe at last.
- [Meows]

536
00:34:19,236 --> 00:34:20,225
No.

537
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:23,406
No. No! Oh, no!

538
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:24,873
Nice kitty, nice kitty.

539
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:26,967
Ow! I'm from New Jersey.

540
00:34:27,044 --> 00:34:28,739
[Cat meows, kids shout]

541
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,271
It was the afternoon of Christmas Eve,

542
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:35,648
and Scrooge was conscious
of a thousand odors.

543
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:40,816
Each one connected with a thousand
thoughts, hopes, joys and cares,

544
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:43,052
long, long forgotten.

545
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:47,220
It's my old school.

546
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:49,792
I was a boy here.

547
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:53,429
That's Henry.

548
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:55,768
And Edmund, my best friend.

549
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,467
Hello, boys. Hello.

550
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:01,306
These are but shadows
of your past, Ebenezer.

551
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:04,006
They can neither see nor hear you.

552
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:06,413
Come, let us go inside.

553
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:10,777
Rizzo, stop playing with the cat.

554
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:13,550
- Save me, save me!
- [Cat meows viciously]

555
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:35,578
And what a flood of memories
came back to him,

556
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:38,774
as Scrooge beheld his old classroom.

557
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:41,944
I know it all so well, spirit.

558
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,649
The desks.

559
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:47,915
The smell of the chalk.

560
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:52,522
I chose my profession in this room.

561
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:55,326
And is he, too, familiar?

562
00:35:58,302 --> 00:36:01,965
[Dickens] Scrooge beheld a small boy,
a boy he knew,

563
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,507
oh, very well indeed.

564
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:10,038
Good heavens.

565
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:11,672
It's me.

566
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:14,183
Come Ebenezer,
the last coach is leaving.

567
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:16,549
Come on,
he never goes home for Christmas.

568
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,952
Who cares about stupid old Christmas?

569
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:23,085
I was often alone.

570
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:27,923
More time for reading... and study.

571
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:31,934
The Christmas holiday was a chance
to get some extra work done.

572
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,834
A time for... solitude.

573
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:41,342
Rats don't understand these things.

574
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,539
You were never a lonely child?

575
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:47,050
I had 1,274 brothers and sisters.

576
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:51,110
Sheesh.
Rats don't understand these things.

577
00:36:51,188 --> 00:36:54,715
Let us see another Christmas
in this place.

578
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,953
They were all very much the same.

579
00:36:59,396 --> 00:37:01,159
Nothing ever changed.

580
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:03,324
You changed.

581
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:26,817
[Dickens] The years performed
their terrible dance.

582
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,054
And in a moment, Scrooge had seen
his entire childhood pass.

583
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:35,292
He saw his old school room
age and decay.

584
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:37,196
What the... Hey!

585
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,256
Agh!

586
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:42,203
So, Master Scrooge, graduation day!

587
00:37:43,307 --> 00:37:46,470
That's my old headmaster.

588
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:48,738
This man taught me my greatest lesson.

589
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:52,270
Stand up. Build your life
as this school was built.

590
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:53,407
Push!

591
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:55,475
[Strains] My ear, my ear, my ear.

592
00:37:57,488 --> 00:38:02,585
Yes, work hard, work long,
and be constructive.

593
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:05,594
Ebenezer, life is a golden opportunity.

594
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:08,597
Today you go forth into the real world.

595
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:11,566
You must keep your nose
to the grindstone.

596
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:13,899
Work hard, lad. And one day,

597
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:16,963
your life will be as solid
as this very building.

598
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:21,469
Hmm. I've been meaning
to fix that shelf.

599
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:22,773
Yes, headmaster.

600
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:27,909
Young man, you have been apprenticed
to a fine company in London.

601
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:31,944
Today, you become a man of business.

602
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:34,013
I'm looking forward to it, headmaster.

603
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:36,525
You will love business.

604
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:38,857
It is the American way.

605
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:39,918
Sam?

606
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:42,465
- Mmm?
- [Whispers]

607
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:46,095
Oh. It is the British way.

608
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,159
Good.

609
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,102
Yes, headmaster.

610
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:55,375
[Headmaster]
Oh, here is your coach, Ebenezer.

611
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:58,778
Come, Scrooge, there is much to see.

612
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:02,475
Remember, don't tip the driver.

613
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:15,157
A moment later, Scrooge found himself
standing on a city street,

614
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:19,328
looking at a building
he had not seen in years.

615
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:22,566
Tell me, Ebenezer Scrooge,
do you know this place?

616
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,131
Know it? My first job was here.

617
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,872
This is Fozziwig's
old rubber chicken factory.

618
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,743
Once again, it was Christmas Eve,

619
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:35,877
night was falling, and the lamplighters
were plying their trade.

620
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:39,411
Hey, light the lamp, not the rat.
Light the lamp, not the rat!

621
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:41,252
- My apologies.
- What are you doing?

622
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:43,555
Put me out, put me out!

623
00:39:43,627 --> 00:39:46,061
- Rizzo!
- What?

624
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:48,029
[Screams]

625
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:49,429
[Gurgling]

626
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:52,696
[Shivers]
Oh, oh, Th-th-th-thank you.

627
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:54,498
You're welcome.

628
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:59,604
There he is, old Fozziwig himself.

629
00:39:59,676 --> 00:40:03,339
Look my lads, dusk has fallen,
and the lamplighters are at work.

630
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:05,643
It's Christmas Eve for certain.

631
00:40:05,716 --> 00:40:07,684
What an employer he was.

632
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:11,118
As hard and as ruthless
as a rose petal.

633
00:40:11,188 --> 00:40:13,452
It's time for the party to begin.

634
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:16,151
It's the Fozziwig Christmas party.

635
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:17,921
Rizzo, come on.

636
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:21,160
Rizzo, just grab hold of the stick.

Can we have some quiet, please?

641

Whoa!

642
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,946
I suppose I should be grateful for that.

643

You're welcome.

644

can I have your attention for a moment?

00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:02,736
Quiet!

651
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:06,173
Thank you.

652
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:07,870
That's better.

653
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:11,244
Welcome to Fozziwig and Mom's
annual Christmas party.

654
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:13,180
At this time in the proceedings,

655
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,083
it is a tradition
for me to make a little speech.

656
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:18,883
And it's a tradition for us
to take a little nap.

657
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:21,220
[They laugh]

658
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,418
Uh, pay no attention to them.

659
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:26,519
My speech,
here is my Christmas speech.

660
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:30,157
"Thank you all
and merry Christmas."

661
00:41:30,233 --> 00:41:32,326
- That was the speech?
- That was dumb.

662
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,131
- It was obvious.
- It was pointless.

663
00:41:34,204 --> 00:41:36,365
It was short.

664
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,965
[Both] I loved it! [both laugh]

665
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:43,308
I'm bored with speeches.
Let's dance, Son!

666
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,848
Here's Mrs. Fozziwig to start the party.

667
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:48,441
- Way to go, Ma!
- Hit it, boys!

668
00:41:48,518 --> 00:41:50,179
[Grunts]

669
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:53,548
Hello.

670
00:41:55,158 --> 00:41:57,922
Look, there's a buffet over here.
I'm kind of hungry.

671
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:01,487
[Sings nonsensically to <i>Deck The Halls]</i>

672

<i>La-la la la</i>

673
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:10,139
Forget it. Mother always taught me,
never eat singing food.

674
00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:14,943
[Fozziwig] A pleasure having you here.

675
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:17,606
I'm very pleased,
and please enjoy yourself.

676
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:20,206
Excuse me, Mr. Fozziwig?

677
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:22,342
Sir, I've been going over the accounts.

678
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:25,445
Do you know how much the firm
is spending for this party?

679
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:28,821
Master Scrooge, this is Christmas.

680
00:42:28,892 --> 00:42:30,985
It's a time for generosity.

681
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:36,556
Stop working, enjoy yourself.
Go meet some people, go ahead.

682
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:37,759
Hello.

683

You dancing fool!

687
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:03,491
I love these annual Christmas parties.

688
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,994
I love them so much,
I think we'll do it twice a year.

689
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:07,360
Excuse me.

690
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:10,229
- [Fozziwig] Master Scrooge.
- Excuse me.

691
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,360
Belle, I'd like to introduce you
to Ebenezer Scrooge,

692
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:15,837
the finest young financial mind
in the city.

693
00:43:15,906 --> 00:43:18,306
Ebenezer, this is Belle,

694
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:20,366
a friend of the Fozziwig family.

695
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:22,435
I'm pleased to meet you.

696
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,211
Well, I'm glad you two finally met.

697
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:29,650
[Spirit] Do you remember this meeting?

698
00:43:30,987 --> 00:43:32,716
Remember?

699
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:35,814
Yes.

700
00:43:36,626 --> 00:43:38,651
I remember.

701
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:42,789
There was, of course, another
Christmas Eve with this young woman,

702
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:45,198
some years later.

703
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:49,466
Oh, please,
do not show me that Christmas.

704
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:05,578
[Birdsong]

705
00:44:10,427 --> 00:44:13,089
Another year
before our wedding, Ebenezer.

706
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:15,222
It can't be helped, Belle.

707
00:44:16,399 --> 00:44:20,529
How could we marry now? There's
not even enough for a decent home.

708
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:22,868
The investments haven't grown
as they should.

709
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:24,930
So you said last year.

710
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:27,704
Business continues to be poor.

711
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:32,074
You're a partner in your own firm now.

712
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,547
Barely clearing expenses.

713
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:39,020
- You said the partnership was the goal.
- This is for you.

714
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,881
I love you, Belle.

715
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:46,826
You did, once.

716
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:54,126
[Sobs]

717
00:44:54,971 --> 00:44:56,700
Oh, Rizzo.

718
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:03,312
Spirit, show me no more.

719
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:06,647
Why do you delight in torturing me?

720
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:11,244
I told you, these are the shadows
of the things that have been.

721
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:15,018
That they are what they are,
do not blame me.

722
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:17,082
Leave me.

723
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:42,647
Scrooge was left alone and exhausted
in his bedchamber.

724
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,679
And thus he remained, until the
nearby clock began to strike the hour.

725
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:49,791
[Grunts] Oh.

726
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:52,885
- Oh. Oh, what was that?
- Two o'clock.

727
00:45:52,963 --> 00:45:55,397
- Is it too early for breakfast?
- Yes.

728
00:45:55,465 --> 00:45:57,899
Oh, good, supper time.

[Dickens] Scrooge knew
the second of the ghosts was due.

732
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:10,174
Yet now,
as the clock finished striking...

733
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:13,272
Nothing.

Come in, and know me better, man.

737
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,337
- Did I already say that?
- You did.

738
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:42,207
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

739
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:46,682
This is the night before the dawn
before the day of Christmas.

740
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,686
Did I tell you that I am
the Ghost of Christmas Present?

741
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:55,521
- You did.
- Come in, know me better, man.

742
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:57,753
You're a little absent-minded, spirit.

743
00:46:57,827 --> 00:47:02,264
No, I'm a large
absent-minded spirit. [chuckles]

744
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,535
My mind is filled
with the here and now.

745
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:10,437
And the now is Christmas. [laughs]

746
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:14,238
[Scrooge laughs] I don't believe I've
ever met anybody like you before, sir.

747
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:18,645
Really? Over 1,800 of my brothers
have come before me.

748
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:22,048
1,800? Lmagine the grocery bills.

[Both laugh]

750
00:47:27,524 --> 00:47:31,824
Have you ever noticed that everything
seems wonderful at Christmas?

751
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:38,197
Uh, in all honesty, spirit, no.

752
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:42,604
Perhaps I've never understood
about Christmas.

753
00:47:42,672 --> 00:47:46,699
Before this day is done,
you will understand.

00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,744
Oh. [laughs]

755

Oh, no! Oh, no!

756
00:47:53,016 --> 00:47:56,281
We shall go out into the world.

757
00:47:59,155 --> 00:48:01,555
I suppose you enjoyed that?

758
00:48:01,624 --> 00:48:03,148
Of course.

759
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:12,793

to Christmas morning?

Spirit, I had no idea.

800
00:50:52,862 --> 00:50:56,889
I wish to see friends, kin.
Show me family.

801
00:50:59,068 --> 00:51:03,027
It's Fred. My dear nephew Fred
and his wife, Clara.

802
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:05,040
Having Christmas with friends.

803
00:51:06,075 --> 00:51:07,565
Hey, look. Fruit.

804
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:10,738
Well, now, we've had the plum pudding
and sung the carols.

805
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:12,804
- What now, my lovelies?
- A game, Fred.

806
00:51:12,882 --> 00:51:15,043
Yeah, we must have a game at Christmas.

807
00:51:15,118 --> 00:51:18,610
- Do people play games at Christmas?
- I love games.

808
00:51:18,688 --> 00:51:21,350
Say, do you know that fruit is wax?

809
00:51:21,424 --> 00:51:24,860
Oh, yeah,
I wondered about the texture. Yeuch!

810
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:28,056
- Let's play "Yes and No."
- Oh, wonderful game.

811
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:31,191
Yah! That's a great game. I'll be it.

812
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:34,031
Yes, let Fred be it.
He always thinks of good things.

813
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:36,503
I do have a good one, Clara. Guess.

814
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:38,564
Is it vegetable?

815
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:40,165
- [Fred] No.
- [Clara] Mineral?

816
00:51:40,243 --> 00:51:41,642
- No.
- Animal, then?

817
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:43,611
- What else?
- What else, indeed.

818
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,910
- Is it found on a farm?
- Never.

819
00:51:45,982 --> 00:51:47,677
- In the city?
- Usually.

820
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,980
Does it pull a hansom cab?

821
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,577
Certainly not.

822
00:51:51,654 --> 00:51:53,383
How about a dog?

823
00:51:53,456 --> 00:51:54,445
No.

824
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:55,650
- A cat?
- A cat?

825
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:59,058
- I said it first.
- No.

826
00:51:59,128 --> 00:52:01,688
Wait, is this an unwanted creature?

827
00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:03,959
- Often.
- A mouse?

828
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:05,261
- No.
- A rat?

829
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:07,428
- You called?
- A cockroach.

830

No.

831

- A leech?
- It's too wonderful.

832
00:52:10,173 --> 00:52:13,165
Wait, I know.
An unwanted creature,

833
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:15,710
but not a rat, a leech,
or a cockroach?

834
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:16,836
Then what?

835
00:52:16,913 --> 00:52:19,245
- What?
- It's Ebenezer Scrooge.

836
00:52:19,315 --> 00:52:20,304
Yes.

837
00:52:20,383 --> 00:52:22,647
- [All laugh]
- Wonderful.

838
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,416
[Female friend] That's a killer.

839
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,632
Come, there is much to see.

840
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:39,668
No more. I wish to see no more.

841

Here.

00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,840
Why have we come
to this odd corner of the town?

843
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:51,573
It's Christmas here, too, you know.

844
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:54,344
That's Bob Cratchit's house.

845
00:52:54,417 --> 00:52:57,147
Perhaps it was the spirit's
own generous nature,

846
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,347
and his sympathy for all poor men,

847
00:52:59,422 --> 00:53:03,688
that led them straight to the home
of Scrooge's faithful clerk.

Hey, don't be sweeping
the chimney now.

- How do you know that?

854
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:23,670
You just told me.

Peter, do not stop turning that spit.

862
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:47,564
That is the whole secret
of a properly roasted goose.

863
00:53:47,637 --> 00:53:52,040
- It smells so good, Mother.
- It does, doesn't it?

864
00:53:52,108 --> 00:53:55,373
[Sniffs] Oh. That smells wonderful.

865
00:53:56,479 --> 00:53:57,912
Oh, good grief.

866
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,107
Hey, I'm stuck, get me out of here.

867
00:54:00,183 --> 00:54:02,310
I knew you weren't suited
for literature.

[Rizzo screams]

869

Oh, at least I landed
on something soft.

Mother, Mother, Mother!

873

You said we couldn't eat the chestnuts
until Father and Tiny Tim get home.

874
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:23,864
I wasn't eating them,

875
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,535
I was merely checking them
to see if they were not burnt.

I fell down the chimney

Oh, no, now, son,

You go sit in your chair a moment.
Rest a moment.

- How was he at church?
- As good as gold and better.

He said he hoped the people
saw him in church

to remember upon Christmas Day

and blind men see.

the Cratchits came to what was surely

the happiest single moment
in all the livelong year.

915

- Such a meager feast.
- But very much appreciated.

916

I pay Bob such a small amount.

- Bob.

Bob Cratchit?

919

It only seems right that
I should lift a glass to my employer.

I give you Mr. Scrooge,
the founder of the feast.

The founder of the feast, indeed. Huh!

922

If I had him here, I would give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

even though he is odious,
stingy, wicked,

and unfeeling, and badly dressed...

Mr. Scrooge.

956
00:59:05,354 --> 00:59:10,690
<i>Let us hear the voice of reason</i>

957
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,786
<i>Singing in the night</i>

958
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:19,634
<i>Let us run from anger</i>

959
00:59:21,604 --> 00:59:25,631
<i>And catch us when we fall</i>

960
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:32,641
<i>Teach us in our dreams</i>
<i>And please, yes, please,</i>

961
00:59:32,715 --> 00:59:36,048
<i>Bless us, one and all</i>

962
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,683
<i>Bless us all</i>

963
00:59:41,757 --> 00:59:44,225
<i>With playful years</i>

964
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:49,822
<i>With noisy games and joyful tears</i>

965
00:59:49,899 --> 00:59:52,800
<i>We reach for you</i>

966
00:59:52,868 --> 00:59:55,837
<i>And we stand tall</i>

967
00:59:55,905 --> 01:00:01,468
<i>And in our prayers and dreams</i>
<i>We ask you, bless us all</i>

968
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:04,206

969
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,080

01:00:12,655 --> 01:00:16,682

972
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:18,624
[coughs]

973
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:26,423
[Emmy] Let's all take our seats now.
Let's have dinner.

974
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:30,666
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

975
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:32,798
That is the future.

976
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:34,866
My realm is the present.

977
01:00:34,944 --> 01:00:40,314
However, I see a vacant seat
by the chimney corner.

978
01:00:40,382 --> 01:00:42,714
And a crutch without an owner.

979
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:48,280
If these shadows remain unaltered,
I believe the child will die.

980
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:51,815
But then, if he's going to die,
he'd better do it,

981
01:00:51,894 --> 01:00:55,159
and decrease the surplus population.

982
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:56,630
Oh, spirit.

983
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:59,827
[Dickens] As the Cratchit family
vanished into the darkness,

984
01:00:59,902 --> 01:01:04,168
Scrooge kept his eyes upon Tiny Tim,
until the last.

985
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,801
Come. My time grows short.

986
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:09,868
[Wind whistles]

987
01:01:14,683 --> 01:01:16,617
Spirit, do you grow old?

988
01:01:16,685 --> 01:01:19,245
I do. [chuckles]

989
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,754
Are spirits' lives so short?

990
01:01:23,826 --> 01:01:26,818
My time upon this globe is very brief.

991
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:33,131
I believe it will end
upon the stroke of 12.

992
01:01:33,202 --> 01:01:35,067
- [Ding]
- [Rizzo] One.

993
01:01:35,137 --> 01:01:39,904
Now? But spirit,
I have learned so much from you.

994
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:42,807
Nothing Scrooge could do or say
could stop

995
01:01:42,878 --> 01:01:46,075
the relentless march
of those terrible bells.

996
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:48,139
[Rizzo] Five!

997
01:01:48,217 --> 01:01:50,549
Oh, spirit, do not leave me.

998
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:53,417
I think I must, in fact.

999
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:56,582
You have meant so much to me.
You have changed me.

1000
01:01:56,692 --> 01:02:02,028
And now I leave you with
the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

1001
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:05,498
- You mean, the future?
- Mm.

1002
01:02:05,568 --> 01:02:06,626
Must I?

1003
01:02:06,702 --> 01:02:12,470
Go forth, and know him better, man.
[Laughs]

1004
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:58,944
Am I in the presence of the
Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?

1005
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:09,219
Spirit, I fear you more
than any specter I have yet met.

1006
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:13,796
This is too scary.
I don't think I want to see any more.

1007
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:17,134
When you're right, you're right.
You're on your own, folks.

1008
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:21,040
- We'll meet you at the finale.
- Yeah.

1009
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:26,643
I am prepared to follow and to learn,
with a thankful heart.

1010
01:03:29,985 --> 01:03:32,453
Will you not speak to me?

1011
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:40,820
Oh, yes, the night is waning fast.

1012
01:03:40,896 --> 01:03:42,887
Lead on, spirit.

1013
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,951
No, I don't know much about it,
either way.

1014
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:11,720
I only know he's dead.

1015
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:14,957
- When?
- Last night, I believe.

1016
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:18,329
Wonder what he died of.
I thought he'd never go.

1017
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,765
[All laugh]

1018
01:04:19,835 --> 01:04:22,030
I don't know or care why he's gone.

1019
01:04:22,104 --> 01:04:24,538
I'd just like to know
what he's done with his money.

1020
01:04:24,606 --> 01:04:26,130
Wouldn't we all?

1021
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:27,971
He didn't give it to me.

1022
01:04:29,345 --> 01:04:31,939
It's likely to be a cheap funeral.

1023
01:04:32,014 --> 01:04:34,847
I don't know a single soul
who would go to it.

1024
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:37,249
- I wouldn't mind going.
- Eh?

1025
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,549
If lunch is provided.

1026
01:04:39,621 --> 01:04:41,748
[All snort and laugh]

1027
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:44,156
- Speaking of lunch...
- Oh, yes.

1028
01:04:47,496 --> 01:04:50,294
I know some of those gentlemen, spirit.

1029
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:53,392
Of what poor wretch do they speak?

1030
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:12,878
So, back from the house of sadness,
I see.

1031
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:16,482
Sad that he didn't die years ago,
the old skinflint.

1032
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:18,685
- Hear, hear.
- Let me see.

1033
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:21,059
What have you got for old Joe?

1034
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,930
What have you got for me
to remember him by?

1035
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,797
Joe, get off.

1036
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:30,862
Well, I got these collar buttons
from his dresser.

1037
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:34,170
Mother of pearl.

1038
01:05:34,243 --> 01:05:37,007
No, I got his bed curtains.

1039
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:40,139
Very fine damask. [laughs]

1040
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:44,015
Very cheap damask.
But worth a few coins.

1041
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:46,316
I've got his blankets.

1042
01:05:46,388 --> 01:05:51,917
His blankets?
Why, Mrs. Dilber, they're still warm.

1043
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:55,589
I don't pay extra for the warmth,
you know.

1044
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:58,690
You should.
It's the only warmth he ever had.

1045
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:00,359
[All laugh]

1046
01:06:06,074 --> 01:06:07,701
I understand, spirit.

1047
01:06:07,776 --> 01:06:11,143
The case of this unhappy man
might be my own.

1048
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:13,875
My life turns that way now.

1049
01:06:13,949 --> 01:06:15,940
Merciful heavens.

1050
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:20,446
Let me see some tenderness
connected with this world,

1051
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:23,889
or I'll be haunted
by that terrible conversation forever.

1052
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,333
It's Bob Cratchit's house.

1053
01:06:34,403 --> 01:06:36,837
Oh, yes, spirit.

1054
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:38,896
A place of joy and laughter.

1055
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:42,367
Thank you for bringing me here.

1056
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:50,214
It's so quiet.

1057
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:54,954
Why is it so quiet, spirit?

1058
01:07:07,302 --> 01:07:09,202
[Sniffing]

1059
01:07:12,007 --> 01:07:13,838
Mother, you're crying again.

1060
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:17,345
It's just the lamplight,
that hurts my eyes.

1061
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:23,875
Not Tiny Tim?

1062
01:07:25,354 --> 01:07:29,757
There, now.
My eyes get weak in the dim light.

1063
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:33,192
I would not want to show
weak eyes to your father,

1064
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,526
when he gets home,
for anything in the world.

1065
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:38,430
He should be back now.

1066
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:43,335
I think he's walked a little slower
these past two evenings.

1067
01:07:44,406 --> 01:07:46,533
Hello, my dears.

1068
01:07:46,608 --> 01:07:47,734
Daddy.

1069
01:07:50,178 --> 01:07:51,941
Hello, girls.

1070
01:07:52,014 --> 01:07:53,072
Hello, Peter.

1071
01:07:53,148 --> 01:07:56,481
Children, please go set the table.

1072
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:58,417
Thank you.

1073
01:07:58,487 --> 01:08:00,079
How was the churchyard?

1074
01:08:00,155 --> 01:08:01,747
It will be lovely, Emily.

1075
01:08:01,823 --> 01:08:05,919
It would have done you good
to see how green the place is.

1076
01:08:05,994 --> 01:08:10,829
I picked a spot for Tim
where he can see...

1077
01:08:10,899 --> 01:08:13,732
It's, it's a spot on the hill.

1078
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,270
You can see the ducks on the river.

1079
01:08:16,338 --> 01:08:17,566
Tiny Tim...

1080
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:21,439
Tiny Tim always loved
watching the ducks on the river.

1081
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:30,016
Spirit, must there be a Christmas
that brings this awful scene?

1082
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:33,978
How can we endure it?

1083
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:39,089
It's all right, children.

1084
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:42,661
Life is made up
of meetings and partings.

1085
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:44,562
That is the way of it.

1086
01:08:45,734 --> 01:08:48,862
I am sure we shall never forget
Tiny Tim.

1087
01:08:48,937 --> 01:08:51,735
Or this first parting
that there was among us.

1088
01:08:57,579 --> 01:08:59,740
[Quiet sniffing]

1089
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,471
Must we return to this place?

1090
01:09:34,016 --> 01:09:36,177
There is something else
that I must know?

1091
01:09:36,251 --> 01:09:38,776
Is that not true?

1092
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:43,722
Spirit, I know what I must ask.

1093
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:46,226
I fear to, but I must.

1094
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:49,190
Who was the wretched man

1095
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:52,131
whose death brought
so much glee and happiness to others?

1096
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,114
Answer me one more question.

1097
01:10:07,182 --> 01:10:09,650
Are these the shadows
of things that will be?

1098
01:10:09,718 --> 01:10:12,380
Or are they the shadows
of things that may be, only?

1099
01:10:21,863 --> 01:10:24,195
These events can be changed.

1100
01:10:36,545 --> 01:10:38,877
A life can be made right.

1101
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:01,895
Ebenezer Scrooge.

1102
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:04,803
Oh, please, spirit, no.

1103
01:11:04,873 --> 01:11:07,398
Hear me, I'm not the man I was.

1104
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:12,510
Why would you show me this
if I was past all hope?

1105
01:11:14,182 --> 01:11:18,118
I will honor Christmas,
and try to keep it all the year.

1106
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:25,092
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1107
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,926
I will not shut out the lessons
the spirits have taught me.

1108
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:32,330
Tell me that I may sponge out
the writing on this stone.

1109
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:37,766
Spirit, please speak to me.

1110
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:43,541
[Clock ticks]

1111
01:11:56,825 --> 01:11:58,486
I'm home.

01:12:02,063 --> 01:12:04,088
[Dickens]
Yes, the bedposts were his own.

1113
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:07,465
The bed was his own.
The room was his own.

1114
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:09,766
Hi, guys, we're back.

1115
01:12:09,838 --> 01:12:11,806
We promised we would be.

1116
01:12:11,873 --> 01:12:14,364
But the thing that made Scrooge
happiest of all

1117
01:12:14,442 --> 01:12:16,433
was that his life lay before him.

1118
01:12:16,511 --> 01:12:18,604
And it could be changed.

1119
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,116
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1120
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:24,709
Oh, Jacob and Robert Marley.

1121
01:12:24,786 --> 01:12:27,380
Heaven in the Christmas time
be praised for this day.

1122
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:29,616
I say it on my knees,
Jacob and Robert.

1123
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:30,953
On my knees.

1124
01:12:31,026 --> 01:12:34,553
Oh, they're not torn down.
They're here.

1125
01:12:34,629 --> 01:12:37,257
And I'm here. It's a miracle.

1126
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:44,998
I don't know what to do.
I'm as light as a feather.

1127
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:48,406
I'm as happy as an angel,
I'm as merry as a schoolboy.

1128
01:12:48,476 --> 01:12:51,206
Do you think it's safe
for us to be up here?

1129
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:53,304
Scrooge is saved,
what can happen now?

1130
01:12:53,381 --> 01:12:54,541
Yeah.

1131
01:12:58,286 --> 01:13:00,186
You there, boy.

1132
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:01,779
What, me?

1133
01:13:02,824 --> 01:13:05,156
Uh, that is, "What, me, sir?"

1134
01:13:05,227 --> 01:13:07,559
- What's today?
- Pardon?

1135
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:09,688
What's today, my fine fellow?

1136
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:12,460
Today? Today is Christmas Day.

1137
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:14,058
It's Christmas Day?

1138
01:13:14,135 --> 01:13:17,366
I haven't missed it.
The spirits did it all in one night.

1139
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,499
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can.

1140
01:13:20,575 --> 01:13:23,043
- Of course they can.
- Of course they can.

1141
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,942
Know the poultry shop nearby?

1142
01:13:25,013 --> 01:13:27,379
- Yes, sir, I do.
- An intelligent lad.

1143
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:29,940
A remarkable lad.

1144
01:13:30,018 --> 01:13:33,112
Do you know whether the prize turkey
has been sold in the window?

1145
01:13:33,188 --> 01:13:36,282
The one twice as big as me?
It's still there.

1146
01:13:36,358 --> 01:13:38,417
It's a pleasure talking with you, lad.

1147
01:13:38,493 --> 01:13:40,927
- Go and buy it.
- Be serious.

1148
01:13:40,996 --> 01:13:44,090
I am serious. Buy it for me
and I'll give you a shilling.

1149
01:13:44,165 --> 01:13:46,497
No, I'll give you five shillings.

1150
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,698
Wow!

1151
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:52,569
And so the boy was off like a shot.
So even...

1152
01:13:54,209 --> 01:13:56,006
Um... Sorry.

1153
01:13:57,178 --> 01:13:59,305
I'll bring it to Bob Cratchit's house.

1154
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:03,249
What a surprise it'll be.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

1155
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:06,719
And a few moments later,
dressed in his finest,

1156
01:14:06,788 --> 01:14:09,348
Scrooge appeared
on the streets of the city

1157
01:14:09,424 --> 01:14:13,224
to wish Merry Christmas
to all the world.

1158
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:15,388
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1159
01:14:15,463 --> 01:14:17,397
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1160
01:14:17,465 --> 01:14:19,763
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1161
01:14:21,636 --> 01:14:23,433
Gee, thanks.

1162
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:27,100
Everyone was out and about
this fine morning.

1163
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:30,542
And soon he encountered
two familiar faces.

1164
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:32,102
- [Yelps]
- [Gasps]

1165
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,738
Mr. Scrooge.

1166
01:14:33,815 --> 01:14:36,409
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but about the charity donation

1167
01:14:36,484 --> 01:14:38,281
you asked me for yesterday?

1168
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:39,911
Put me down for...

1169
01:14:42,257 --> 01:14:43,383
That much?

1170
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:45,289
Not a penny less.

1171
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,352
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

1172
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:51,263
My goodness,
I don't know what to say.

1173
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:54,325
I just wish there was something
we could give you.

1174
01:14:59,641 --> 01:15:01,836
A gift?

1175
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:04,003
A gift for me?

1176
01:15:11,619 --> 01:15:13,143
Thank you.

1177
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:15,049
Thank you.

1178
01:15:15,123 --> 01:15:19,321
- 50 times! And a Merry Christmas.
- Here's your turkey, Mr. Scrooge.

1179
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,385
Follow me, lad.

1180
01:15:23,031 --> 01:15:25,522
<i>With a thankful heart,</i>
<i>with an endless joy</i>

1181
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,068
<i>With a growing family</i>
<i>Every girl and boy</i>

1182
01:15:28,136 --> 01:15:30,604
<i>Will be nephew and niece to me</i>

1183
01:15:30,672 --> 01:15:32,867
<i>Nephew and niece to me</i>

1184
01:15:32,941 --> 01:15:35,808
<i>Will bring love, hope,</i>
<i>and peace to me</i>

1185
01:15:35,877 --> 01:15:38,004
<i>Love, hope, and peace to me</i>

1186
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:40,274
<i>Yes, and every night will end</i>

1187
01:15:40,348 --> 01:15:42,646
<i>And every day will start</i>

1188
01:15:42,717 --> 01:15:47,654
<i>With a grateful prayer</i>
<i>and a thankful heart</i>

1189
01:15:47,722 --> 01:15:50,213
<i>With an open smile</i>
<i>and with open doors</i>

1190
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:52,725
<i>I will bid you welcome</i>
<i>What is mine is yours</i>

1191
01:15:52,794 --> 01:15:55,228
<i>With a glass raised</i>
<i>to toast your health</i>

1192
01:15:55,296 --> 01:15:57,821
<i>With a glass raised</i>
<i>to toast your health</i>

1193
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:00,333
<i>And a promise to share the wealth</i>

1194
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:02,666
<i>A promise to share the wealth</i>

1195
01:16:02,737 --> 01:16:04,898
<i>I will sail a friendly course</i>

1196
01:16:04,973 --> 01:16:07,271
<i>Follow a friendly chart</i>

1197
01:16:07,342 --> 01:16:11,676
<i>On a sea of love</i>
<i>and a thankful heart</i>

1198
01:16:11,746 --> 01:16:14,146
<i>Life is like a journey</i>

1199
01:16:16,317 --> 01:16:18,683
<i>Who knows when it ends?</i>

1200
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:24,581
<i>Yes, and if you need to know</i>

1201
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:27,093
<i>The measure of a man</i>

1202
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:31,292
<i>You simply count his friends</i>

1203
01:16:31,366 --> 01:16:34,733
<i>Stop and look around you</i>

1204
01:16:35,904 --> 01:16:39,567
<i>The glory that you see</i>

1205
01:16:42,043 --> 01:16:46,776
<i>Is born again each day</i>
<i>Don't let it slip away</i>

1206
01:16:46,848 --> 01:16:50,682
<i>How precious life can be</i>

1207
01:17:36,731 --> 01:17:39,222
<i>With a thankful heart</i>
<i>that is wide awake</i>

1208
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,700
<i>I do make this promise,</i>
<i>every breath I take</i>

1209
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:44,499
<i>Will be used now to sing your praise</i>

1210
01:17:44,572 --> 01:17:46,767
<i>Used now to sing your praise</i>

1211
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:49,401
<i>And to beg you to share my days</i>

1212
01:17:49,477 --> 01:17:51,775
<i>Beg you to share my days</i>

1213
01:17:51,846 --> 01:17:54,041
<i>With a loving guarantee</i>

1214
01:17:54,115 --> 01:17:56,481
<i>That even if we part</i>

1215
01:17:56,551 --> 01:18:00,078
<i>I will hold you close</i>
<i>in a thankful heart</i>

1216
01:18:01,456 --> 01:18:06,792
<i>I will hold you close</i>
<i>in a thankful heart</i>

1217
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:31,710
Bob Cratchit?

1218
01:18:34,422 --> 01:18:35,787
So, here you are.

1219
01:18:35,857 --> 01:18:37,882
M-M-M-Mr. Scrooge.

1220
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:41,456
You, sir, were not at work this morning
as we had discussed.

1221
01:18:41,529 --> 01:18:44,327
But, Mr. Scrooge, sir,
we did discuss it.

1222
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:46,663
It's Christmas Day.
You gave me the day off.

1223
01:18:46,734 --> 01:18:47,826
I?

1224
01:18:47,902 --> 01:18:50,370
I, Ebenezer Scrooge?

1225
01:18:50,438 --> 01:18:52,303
- Would I do a thing like that?
- No.

1226
01:18:52,373 --> 01:18:54,136
I mean, yes, but you did.

1227
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:56,177
Bob Cratchit, I've had my fill of this.

1228
01:18:56,244 --> 01:18:59,008
And I have had my fill of you,
Mr. Scrooge.

1229
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,638
And therefore, Bob Cratchit...

1230
01:19:00,715 --> 01:19:03,115
And therefore,
you can leave this house at once.

1231
01:19:03,184 --> 01:19:05,550
And therefore,
I'm about to raise your salary.

1232
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:09,454
And I am about to raise you
right off the pavement...

1233
01:19:09,524 --> 01:19:10,616
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

1234
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:12,159
Yes, Bob.

1235
01:19:12,227 --> 01:19:13,888
Raise your salary.

1236
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:16,897
And pay your mortgage
on this house.

1237
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:20,633
Please, sir, come inside.

1238
01:19:20,702 --> 01:19:21,964
Yes, yes.

1239
01:19:22,036 --> 01:19:25,369
Bob Cratchit, would you and your family
care to join us

1240
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,069
for a little turkey dinner
on this fine Christmas Day?

1241
01:19:29,143 --> 01:19:31,134
Merry Christmas.

1242
01:19:41,256 --> 01:19:43,690
[Dickens] And Scrooge
was better than his word.

1243
01:19:43,758 --> 01:19:46,488
He did it all, and infinitely more.

1244
01:19:46,561 --> 01:19:48,461
And, er, Tiny Tim?

1245
01:19:48,529 --> 01:19:50,087
And Tiny Tim,

1246
01:19:50,164 --> 01:19:51,791
who did not die...

1247
01:19:51,866 --> 01:19:53,390
Isn't that swell?

1248
01:19:53,468 --> 01:19:56,733
To Tiny Tim,
Scrooge became a second father.

1249
01:19:56,804 --> 01:19:59,466
He became as good a friend,
as good a master,

1250
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:03,306
and as good a man
as the good old city ever had.

1251
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:06,438
It was always said of him that
he knew how to keep Christmas well,

1252
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:08,880
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

1253
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:13,182
May that truly be said of us
and all of us.

1254
01:20:13,254 --> 01:20:15,779
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

1255
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:18,826
- God bless us.
- God bless us.

1256
01:20:18,893 --> 01:20:20,622
Every one.

1257
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:25,495
<i>The love we found</i>

1258
01:20:25,566 --> 01:20:29,127
<i>The love we found</i>

1259
01:20:29,203 --> 01:20:31,728
<i>We carry with us</i>

1260
01:20:31,806 --> 01:20:35,902
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

1261
01:20:36,911 --> 01:20:40,506
<i>The love we found</i>

1262
01:20:40,581 --> 01:20:43,482
<i>The love we found</i>

1263
01:20:44,485 --> 01:20:47,181
<i>The sweetest dream</i>

1264
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:51,555
<i>That we have ever known</i>

1265
01:20:51,626 --> 01:20:54,527
Hey, say goodbye!

1266
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:58,631
<i>The love we found</i>

1267

01:21:21,622 --> 01:21:24,113
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1275
01:21:24,192 --> 01:21:26,888
<i>A cup of kindness</i>
<i>that we share with another</i>

1276
01:21:26,961 --> 01:21:29,691
<i>A sweet reunion</i>

Oh, Yes! Make it last all year.

1286
01:22:04,565 --> 01:22:06,533
<i>It's in the giving of a gift</i>

<i>in December</i>

1292
01:22:20,615 --> 01:22:23,812
