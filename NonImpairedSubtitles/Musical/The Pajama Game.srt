1
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,799
Come in.

2
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,196
All right, girls,
mind your P's and Q's.

3
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,830
Efficiency, that's what I'm here for.

4
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,436
<i>The pajama game is the game I'm in</i>

5
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,192
<i>And I'm proud to be</i>

6
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,430
<i>In the pajama game
I love it</i>

7
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,559
<i>I can hardly wait
To wake and get to work at 8</i>

8
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,838
<i>Nothing's quite the same
As the pajama game</i>

9
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,114
<i>The pajama game
Is the game we're in</i>

10
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,032
<i>And we're proud to be</i>

11
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,509
<i>In the pajama game
We love it</i>

12
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,434
<i>We can hardly wait
To wake and get to work at 8</i>

13
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,199
<i>Nothing's quite the same
As the pajama game</i>

14
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,351
If you're so all-fired efficient, how come
you're out here looking for a job?

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,830
I consider Sleeptite pajamas
a quality product, Mr. Hasler...

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,991
<i>...something I'd be proud
to be connected with.</i>

17
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,436
You would, huh?
Well, might as well give you a trial.

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,797
I've tried the old ones,
I might as well try the young ones.

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,951
Gladys.

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,717
- It isn't easy, I'm warning you.
- I'm not looking for an easy job.

21
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,030
- Seven and a half cents.
- I beg your pardon?

22
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,475
Seven and a half cents.
That's what they want now.

23
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,993
I know what's going on here.

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,073
I've just written the board of directors.
It's absolutely unnecessary.

25
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,514
- Gladys.
- Yes, Mr. Hasler?

26
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,558
This is Mr. Sorokin.

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,997
The new superintendent.

28
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,549
- Get him started.
- Certainly. Will you come this way?

29
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,276
Miss Hotchkiss.

30
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,598
Well, Gladys, I suppose you're starting
something with him now.

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,352
Vernon, what are you talking about?

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,112
You put your hand on him. Flirting.

33
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,840
Oh, you make me sick.

34
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,915
Get to work.
I'm an executive, I'm a time-study man.

35
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,832
I've got my stopwatch on you.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,195
can't waste time.

37
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,237
Hurry up. Hurry up.

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,879
<i>Hurry up</i>

39
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,519
<i>Hurry up</i>

40
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,113
<i>- Hurry up
- Can't waste time</i>

41
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,599
<i>- Hurry up
- Can't waste time</i>

42
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,638
<i>When you're racing with the clock
When you're racing with the clock</i>

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,233
<i>And the second hand
Doesn't understand</i>

44
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,833
<i>That your back may break
And your fingers ache</i>

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,151
<i>And your constitution
Isn't made of rock</i>

46

<i>It's a losing race

<i>Racing, racing, racing with the clock</i>

<i>Racing, racing, racing with the clock</i>

50
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,515
Hurry up, girls, hurry up.
Seconds are ticking.

51
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,557
can't waste time. can't waste time.

52
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,358
<i>When will old man Hasler break down</i>

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,959
<i>And come up with our
7- and-a-half-cent raise?</i>

54
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,190
<i>I can't even buy me a wreck</i>

55
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,275
<i>Of a secondhand car
On that salary he pays</i>

56
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,076
<i>What do you think
Of the new superintendent?</i>

57
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,959
- He's cute.
- He'll never last.

58
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,317
<i>He's kind of fresh
For a new superintendent</i>

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,553
- I like a man with spunk.
- You like a man, period.

60
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,119
All right, cut the laughing.

61
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,829
Cut out the laughing, hurry up.
Tempus fugit, tempus fugit.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,070
Waste, waste, waste.

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,229
Hurry up.

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,435
<i>Hurry up</i>

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,999

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,718
<i>Can't waste time</i>

75
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,796
<i>Racing with the clock</i>

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,193
- Here's some tape.
- Thanks.

77
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,318
- A Chicago guy.
- He don't belong in this town.

78
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,879
"I'll fix it," he says.

79
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,715
Oh, give him a chance, boys.

80
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,599
He's only been here two days.

81
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,877
- Sid?
- Yeah? Pull me out.

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,519
- Mr. Hasler wants you.
- Again?

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,478
Give me a screwdriver.
I'm nearly done.

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,791
- I'll tell him you're awfuI busy.
- Thanks.

85
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,394
You know how much they're paying
at the packing plant?

86
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,597
- A dollar three up.
- Screwdriver.

87
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,113
You know something else?

88
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,396
They're paying $ 1. 14
up at the casket company.

89
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,791
My gosh, you'd be a sensation
up at the casket company.

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,916
You could get a job up there
as a tester...

91
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,877
...and just lie in coffins
all day long.

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,314
- Now hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

93
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,596
- Well, hurry faster.
- Hey.

94
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,832
- Hey, you can't do that to me.
- I can't? I just did.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,309
Well, I'll fix you.

96
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,075
- I'm getting the grievance committee.
- Go. It'll give you something to do.

97
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,435
I don't have to take
that stuff off nobody.

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,556
Go away, boy. You bother me.

99
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,517
I'll show you.

100
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,478
And on my weak arm too.

101
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,392
That grievance committee
can start quite a rhubarb.

102
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,312
This whole town is a rhubarb.

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,392
- Oh, you'll get used to it.
- I sure intend to.

104
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,236
Hey, you. Go down to the storeroom,
get me a switch and a piece of cable.

105
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,155
Move.

106
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,712
Oh, Mr. Sorokin,
I told you to be carefuI.

107
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,075
When I heard about you
beating up that boy-

108
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,992
I didn't beat him up.

109
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,232
Well, he's dangling his arm
like it hurt something terrible.

110
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,393
- Here comes Babe Williams.
- Be delighted to talk to him.

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,437
All right, mister, here's Babe Williams.

112
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,193
So this is the committee.

113
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,553
That's right, Mr. Sorokin.
This is the committee.

114
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,870
Charlie, this grievance committee
is different.

115
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,998
- Never mind the snow job.
- Oh, sorry.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,118
All right, I shoved the kid.
What's the next move?

117
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,953
- He says you hit him.
- No, I just-

118
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,190
- Look, Miss Wilson, I've got-
- Miss Williams.

119
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,112
- What's the difference?
- I'm sorry.

120
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,352
- He ought to know the right name.
- Mae, will you take it easy.

121
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,478
Mr. Sorokin, I've got quite a few
problems of my own right now.

122
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,438
- This helper says you socked him.
- He does?

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,034
Let's say I shoved him.
It sounds more refined.

124
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,714
You are not supposed
to strike an employee.

125
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,199
We have rules about that.

126
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,669
For both sides, I hope.

127
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,990
Listen, miss,
I'll spread it on the table.

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,515
This young man
needs vocational guidance.

129
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,716
- Think so?
- He wants to be a bank president.

130
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,314
I don't see what all this
has to do with it.

131
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,393
You don't seem to have made a good
impression on the new superintendent.

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,917
He ain't got no right to shove me
around, especially on my weak arm.

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,675
Listen, miss, I've gotta get
this factory going.

134
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,832
- can't we take this up later?
- Of course we can, Mr. Sorokin.

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,798
That's in the rulebook too.

136
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,955
Have the nurse check you
and send me a report.

137
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,396
can't shove me around.
It was broke once already.

138
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,839
Thanks for your cooperation,
Miss Williams.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,639
- It's all in the rulebook.
- I must read that sometime.

140
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,358
You certainly should.

141
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,433
AII I have to say is, you're the cutest
committee I've ever had to deal with.

142
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,273
- Oh, that's what I want.
- What's going on now?

143
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,237
come on, girls, let's pull together.

144
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,355
This is a crisis. The tops
are 15 minutes behind the bottoms.

145
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,114
can't waste time. Hurry up. Hurry up.

146
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,998
<i>When you're racing with the clock</i>

147
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,718
<i>When you're racing with the clock</i>

148
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,154
<i>And the second hand
Doesn't understand</i>

149
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,594
<i>That your back may break
And your fingers ache</i>

150
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,479
<i>And your constitution
Isn't made of rock</i>

151
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,517
<i>It's a losing race
When you're racing...</i>

152
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,717
I never know what to wear
to a picnic.

153
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,950
If you got the style, it don't matter.

154
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,793
You elected me president.
You gotta have confidence in me.

155
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,999
- AII I says is that we were wasting-
- No time to talk ultimatums and strikes.

156
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,469
- But that 7 and a half cents.
- Wait a minute.

157
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,598
No question we're gonna get
that 7-and-a-half-cent raise.

158
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,069
Other companies are paying it
and we're entitled.

159
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,673
But we gotta be smart.

160
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,231
Wait till Hasler's got so many orders in
he can't afford to close the factory.

161
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,516
Then we got him.

162
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,999
What about that helper yesterday?
Says the super socked him.

163
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,072
- I didn't get no report on that.
- Oh, that's one for the birds.

164
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,470
- Why, he hasn't even got a bruise.
- No?

165
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,437
No. The nurse says he's a faker.

166
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,953
I guess maybe that's right.

167
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,680
- Sure, he's a phony.
- Okay.

168
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,549
Why, if that Sorokin guy had
really hit him, he'd break him in two.

169
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,838
Mr. Sorokin is so strong.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,309
He's so wonderfuI.

171
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,436
- What's this?
- The new super.

172
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,831
<i>I think he's simply... don't you?</i>

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,752
- I didn't notice.
- I noticed.

174
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,831
I thought Babe was noticing too.

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,592
She lit up.

176
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,239
You know, you girls are really-

177
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,278
Love comes at last to Babe Williams.

178
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,996
Will you get off it?

179
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,957
I hardly looked at the man.

180
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,270
I'm the grievance committee.

181
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,749
Love? Are you nuts?

182
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,356
Some people can't tell
when it hits them.

183
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,637
<i>All you gotta do is say hello to a man</i>

184
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,268
<i>And they've got you
Whispering in his ear</i>

185
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,797
<i>All you gotta do it seems
Is work for him</i>

186
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,952
<i>And they've got you goin '
Berserk for him</i>

187
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,199
<i>If there's a guy
You merely have a beer with</i>

188
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,473
<i>They've got you
Setting the wedding date</i>

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,719
<i>It seems they've just
Gotta have some dirt</i>

190
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,194
<i>To bend your ear with</i>

191
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,032
<i>So before you start</i>

192
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,714
<i>I herewith state</i>

193
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,116
<i>I'm not at all in love
Not at all in love, not I</i>

194
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,679
<i>Not a bit</i>

195
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,114
<i>Not a mite</i>

196
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,432
<i>Though I'll admit
He's quite a hunk of guy</i>

197
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,470
<i>He's not my cup of tea
Not my cup of tea, not he</i>

198
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,119
<i>Not an ounce</i>

199
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,554
<i>Not a pinch</i>

200
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,272
<i>He's just an inch
Too sure of himself for me</i>

201
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,877
<i>Well, of course, you've noticed
His manly physique</i>

202
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,679
<i>And that look in his eye</i>

203
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,919
<i>Say, I'm sure he can cut
Most any man down to size</i>

204
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,313
<i>He must be as fierce as a tiger
When he's mad</i>

205
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,675
<i>And I'll bet he cries like a little boy
When he's sad</i>

206
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,435
<i>But I'm not at all in love
Not at all in love, not I</i>

207
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,079
<i>Not a straw</i>

208
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,753
<i>Not a hair</i>

209
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,629
<i>I don't care
If he's as strong as a lion</i>

210
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,315
<i>Or if he has the rest of you sighin '</i>

211
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,596
<i>You may be sold</i>

212
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,278
<i>But this girl ain't buyin '</i>

213
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,079
<i>I'm not at all in love</i>

214
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,236
<i>She's not at all in love
Not at all in love, oh, no</i>

215
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,913
<i>Not a pin</i>

216
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,433
<i>Not a crumb</i>

217
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,149
<i>Must be the summer heat
That gives her that glow</i>

218
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,634
<i>'Cause she's not at all in love
Not at all in love, she cries</i>

219
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,313
<i>Not a snip</i>

220
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,879
<i>Not a bite</i>

221
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,156
<i>Must be the light from the ceiling</i>

222
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,030
<i>Shining there in her eyes</i>

223
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,228
<i>He's young and handsome and smart
And we can't get over it</i>

224
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,151
<i>But this lady's heart
He doesn't affect a bit</i>

225
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,712
<i>It's easy to see that her daffy grin</i>

226
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,317
<i>Is the grin she always wears</i>

227
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,516
<i>And she's breathless
Because she ran up a flight of stairs</i>

228
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,238
<i>- Obviously
- Naturally</i>

229
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,674
<i>Definitely</i>

230
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,069
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

231
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,917
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,512
- Obviously.
- Naturally.

233
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,238
Definitely.

234
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:21,270
<i>She's not at all in love
Not at all in love, not she</i>

235
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,919
<i>No, I'm not</i>

236
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,559
<i>Not a dot</i>

237
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,199
<i>Not a touch</i>

238
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,952
<i>No, not much</i>

239
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,669
<i>When I fall in love
There'll be no doubt about it</i>

240
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,355
<i>'Cause you will know
From the way that I shout it</i>

241
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,957
You're shouting.

242
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,557
<i>I haven't fallen</i>

243
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,871
<i>She hasn't fallen</i>

244
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:59,278
<i>- I'm not at all in love
- She's not at all in love</i>

245
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,078
Superintendent's office.

246
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,152
Come in. Oh, yes, Sid.

247
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,632
Dolores Paradisso, that's her name.

248
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,394
Well, she's supposed
to be very elegant.

249
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,073
She can sew a button on a fly...

250
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,516
...like she was pouring tea
for the Queen of England.

251
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,389
Oh, yeah. She can pull hair all right.

252
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,030
- Them girls had another fight.
- Wanna buy a ticket for the picnic?

253
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,111
Might as well and get it over with.

254
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,191
One dollar and all the beer
you can guzzle.

255
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,918
No beer for me.

256
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,036
Gives me heartburn something awfuI.

257
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,316
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, you.

258
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,833
- Here.
- Thanks.

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,831
You gonna do your
knife-throwing act?

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,560
I suppose so. There always
seems to be a demand for it.

261
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,109
Was you honest on the real stage?

262
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,191
That's where I first met him, Poopsie.

263
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,477
He was throwing knives at a woman
at the Majestic Theater.

264
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,235
It's gonna be some picnic.

265
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,315
I saw you.
Leaving him a note, huh?

266
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,313
- Carrying on with Sorokin.
- Oh, Vernon.

267
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,277
I saw you put that note
on his desk.

268
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,953
I'm not blind.

269
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,192
And that's why you wore that
low-necked dress to work today.

270
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,316
You make me scream, Vernon.

271
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,153
- You just make me scream.
- Okay, then what's in it?

272
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,030
- I dare you to tell me what's in it.
- Read it, then go cut your throat.

273
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,231
"Okay payroll. $ 7502.01. "

274
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,551
That means "I love you"
in the Morse code.

275
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,188
Ain't you ashamed of yourself,
Hinesie?

276
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,191
<i>Now that we've got that all settled...</i>

277
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,557
...do you think you could trust
me as far as the ladies' room?

278
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,030
I'll never be jealous again, Gladys.
I promise.

279
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,875
Maybe I'll give you cause someday.

280
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,079
Hinesie.

281
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,358
Hinesie.

282
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,229
I've learnt my lesson.
I'll never be jealous again.

283
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,312
- You stick to that now.
- Absolutely.

284
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,630
<i>That's easier said than done</i>

285
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,232
<i>- I can do it
- I knew it</i>

286
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,394
<i>But let's take an example
Just for fun</i>

287
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,797
<i>Picture this</i>

288
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,349
<i>You're waiting three hours
For her to come home from a date</i>

289
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,638
<i>There I am, I'm waiting three hours
For her to come home from a date</i>

290
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,553
<i>Here she comes
Her lipstick is smeared</i>

291
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,153
<i>And she can't seem to walk
Very straight</i>

292
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,959
<i>Here she comes
Her lipstick is smeared</i>

293
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,473
<i>And she can't seem to walk
Very straight</i>

294
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,553
<i>Then she drops a bottle of rye
And not battin ' an eye</i>

295
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,508
<i>Says a train wreck made her late</i>

296
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,231
Well, Hinesie,
what would you do then?

297
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,515
<i>I would trust her</i>

298
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,875
<i>I would trust her</i>

299
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,113
<i>By George, I swear I would trust her</i>

300
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,354
<i>No, I'll never be jealous again</i>

301
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,476
- Nice work.
- I know what I'm doing, Mabel.

302
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,632
- Now let's take another example.
- Sure, Mabel.

303
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,717
<i>Picture this, you've nothin ' to do
So you drop in to chat for a while</i>

304
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,873
<i>There I am with nothin ' to do
So I drop in to chat for a while</i>

305
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,318
<i>Something's up, the window is open
And Gladys is forcin ' a smile</i>

306
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,678
<i>Somethin's up, the window is open
And Gladys is forcin ' a smile</i>

307
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,752
<i>Then you see a hat and a tie</i>

308
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,631
<i>And a pair of socks
In a nice, neat little pile</i>

309
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,113
Well, Hinesie?

310
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,871
<i>I would trust her
I would trust her</i>

311
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,079
<i>By George, I swear I would trust her</i>

312
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,233
<i>No, I'll never be jealous</i>

313
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,517
<i>I'll never, never, never, never, never
Never be jealous again</i>

314
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,830
That's the stuff,
you're practically cured.

315
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,597
<i>There will be no more
Nightmares to sleep through</i>

316
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,753
<i>No more keyholes to peep through</i>

317
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,959
<i>No more bushes to creep through</i>

318
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,872
<i>That's my plan</i>

319
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,315
<i>Well, now that you're a new man</i>

320
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,357
<i>Picture this</i>

321
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,795
<i>You go to your sweetie's apartment
You borrowed the keys</i>

322
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,598
<i>There I am</i>

323
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,035
<i>I go to my sweetie's apartment
I borrowed the keys</i>

324
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,918
<i>There she is</i>

325
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,389
<i>She's giving a sailor
A very affectionate squeeze</i>

326
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,198
<i>There she is</i>

327
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,590
<i>She's giving a sailor
A very affectionate squeeze</i>

328
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,557
<i>Then to boot</i>

329
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,836
<i>She tells you
She was in the arms of her cousin</i>

330
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,468
<i>Who's back from overseas</i>

331
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,551
Her cousin.
You expect me to believe that?

332
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,039
Hinesie.

333
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,079
<i>I would trust her
I would trust her</i>

334
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,233
<i>By George, I swear I would trust her</i>

335
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,234
<i>No, I'll never be jealous</i>

336
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,029
<i>I'll never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never, never</i>

337
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,555
<i>- Never be jealous again
- Good.</i>

338
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,915
Hinesie. Hinesie, stop it.

339
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,399
Stop it. Hinesie, stop it.

340
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,279
What will Mr. Hasler say?
Have you gone crazy?

341
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,317
Hinesie, stop it. Hinesie, stop it.

342
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,232
This is terrible.

343
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,555
Memo: Cutting foreman. Too many
rejects on rayon crepe numbers.

344
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,714
What right has the union to run their
Pepsi-Cola machine with our electricity?

345
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,154
Well, what's this?

346
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,912
This shouldn't be Iying around.

347
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,354
- Gladys.
- Yes?

348
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,671
- This book.
- Oh, you scared the life out of me.

349
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,070
It's all right.
I've got the key around my neck.

350
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,232
I don't want it left Iying around.

351
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,676
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Mr. Hasler.

352
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,398
If I can't trust Gladys,
who can I trust?

353
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,358
What was my book
doing up here anyhow?

354
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,273
The old man's got a bad case
of "bookitis," hasn't he?

355
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,079
<i>- Yes.
- I wonder if he's got...</i>

356
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,708
...a skeleton locked in there.

357
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,279
Say, Mabel, tell me something.

358
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,715
What kind of a girI
is this Babe Williams?

359
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,155
- She's peppy.
- I can see that.

360
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,390
Full of life.

361
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,949
<i>- Give me Ladies' Pants.
- Yes, Mr. Sorokin.</i>

362
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,270
<i>- Hello?
- Prez? Sorokin speaking.</i>

363
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,914
Whatever happened
to that complaint from the helper?

364
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,355
I'd like to get it settled.

365
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,080
Would you send the grievance
committee up to my office?

366
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,479
<i>- No, right away.
- Okay, Sid.</i>

367
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,278
Thanks.

368
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,908
I heard you had an eye for her.

369
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,435
You hear things easy
around this place.

370
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,478
First thing you know
they'll be talking about us.

371
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,791
Don't think it hasn't been mentioned.

372
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,474
Memo: Head cutter-

373
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,918
Come in. Have a seat.

374
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,958
Yes, Mr. Hasler, I'll be right there.

375
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,554
The last six lots
went over the estimate.

376
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,553
Better check with your markers.

377
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,117
I wanted to talk to you about
that assault and battery case.

378
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,356
- Well, we thought we would forget that.
- That's a relief.

379
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,590
The committee decided
just to drop the matter.

380
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,398
Well, I wanted to get it straight.

381
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,677
For a while there I thought
that you and I'd have to fight a duel.

382
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,432
Seems that won't be necessary.

383
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,910
As a matter of fact,
we have been fighting a duel.

384
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,959
Every time I come on your floor I try to
get you to look at me, but I always lose.

385
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,111
Never a look.

386
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,675
Perhaps I'm just very
interested in my work.

387
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,197
Perhaps.

388
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,869
But as far as that helper is concerned,
we know that you had provocation.

389
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,237
What I had to go through to get him
to kick across with a screwdriver.

390
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,914
I'd have been justified
if I had socked him.

391
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,957
Well, we won't go into that.

392
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,238
But anyhow, we have it down
in our books as a slight nudge.

393
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,157
I think a little physical punishment
is good for people once in a while.

394
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,073
Oh, you do, Captain Bligh?

395
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,549
No, not exactly.

396
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,631
Sit down for a second, will you?

397
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,836
I wanna talk to you.

398
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,672
- How about a date?
- What?

399
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,070
How about going out to dinner
some night?

400
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,318
<i>Well, I don't know, I...</i>

401
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,119
Maybe check up on some
of the local hot spots?

402
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,037
Thank you very much, Mr. Sorokin,
but I don't think so.

403
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,152
What is this strange power
I have over women?

404
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,833
But it wouldn't work, not at all.

405
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,592
Looks like I struck out that time.

406
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,115
Well, it's nothing personal.

407
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,515
But you see, you're the superintendent,
and I'm the grievance committee.

408
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,674
Memo: Timekeeper. Be sure all girls fill
out credit cards properly and check...

409
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,995
Memo: To Sid Sorokin.

410
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,675
<i>Hey, there</i>

411
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,994
<i>You with the stars in your eyes</i>

412
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,950
<i>Love never made a fool of you</i>

413
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,593
<i>You used to be too wise</i>

414
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,111
<i>Hey, there</i>

415
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,354
<i>You on that high-flyin ' cloud</i>

416
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,071
<i>Though she won't throw
A crumb to you</i>

417
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,509
<i>You think someday
She'll come to you</i>

418
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,310
<i>Better forget her</i>

419
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,315
<i>Her with her nose in the air</i>

420
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,395
<i>She has you dancin ' on a string</i>

421
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:49,556
<i>Break it and she won't care</i>

422
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,352
<i>Will you take this advice
I hand you</i>

423
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,350
<i>Like a brother?</i>

424
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:06,550
<i>Or are you not seein ' things
Too clear?</i>

425
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,195
<i>Are you just too far gone to hear?</i>

426
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,432
<i>Is it all goin ' in one ear</i>

427
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,196
<i>And out the other?</i>

428
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,875
<i>Hey, there</i>

429
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,239
<i>You with the stars in your eyes
Who, me?</i>

430
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,190
<i>Love never made a fool of you
Not untiI now.</i>

431
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,311
<i>You used to be too wise
Yeah, I was. Once.</i>

432
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,596
<i>Hey, there
I hear you.</i>

433
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,595
<i>You on that high flyin ' cloud</i>

434
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,469
<i>Though she won't throw
A crumb to you</i>

435
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,039
Don't rub it in.

436
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,909
<i>You think someday
She'll come to you</i>

437
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,559
Oh, shut up.

438
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,676
<i>Better forget her</i>

439
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,159
<i>Forget her</i>

440
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,629
<i>Her with her nose in the air</i>

441
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,634
<i>Her with her nose in the air</i>

442
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,997
<i>She has you dancing on a string
A puppet on a string</i>

443
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,709
<i>Break it and she won't care</i>

444
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,839
<i>She won't care for me</i>

445
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,437
<i>Will you take this advice
I hand you</i>

446
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,679
<i>Like a brother?</i>

447
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,949
<i>Or are you not seein ' things
Too clear?</i>

448
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,148
<i>Are you too much in love to hear?</i>

449
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:51,429
<i>Is it all goin ' in one ear</i>

450
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,951
<i>And out the other?</i>

451
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,796
- What a day, eh, Prez?
- Yeah, solid gold.

452
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,713
I love these picnics.

453
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,836
Always come back
from the road for them.

454
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,629
Say, on this last trip I sold a lot
of Sleeptite pajamas, believe me.

455
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,633
- Oh, you did, eh?
- I knocked them for a loop in Masalon...

456
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,597
...Chilicarty, Van Worth, Napoleon.

457
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,996
Finest season I ever had, girls.

458
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,630
<i>I'll have to announce that there
ain't gonna be enough baked beans...</i>

459
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,597
<i>...but there's plenty of potato salad.</i>

460
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,390
So them that don't care for beans can
go heavy on the salad and vice versa.

461
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,079
I can never remember a time
when competition was so ruthless...

462
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,233
...dealers so cantankerous,
costs outrageous...

463
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,439
...and profit margins sunk so low.

464
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,629
My good friends,
pajamas are at the crossroads.

465
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,829
Well,
if it isn't the grievance committee.

466
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,468
- Should've run faster.
- I have a grievance.

467
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,551
There's a new fella here
named Sid Sorokin.

468
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,235
Knocking himself out to be a dandy
fellow but he can't make a score.

469
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:53,077
Well, you just tell Mr. Sorokin that Miss
Williams is a very cold, hard-boiled doll.

470
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,878
He wouldn't like her at all.

471
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,554
This way for the knife throwing.

472
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,314
Oh, there's the knife throwing.
This I gotta see.

473
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,916
This way for the great
knife-throwing exhibition.

474
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,435
- What happened to you?
- Stay out in the open.

475
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,319
- Don't get down in them woods.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

476
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,550
Make way for the old professor.

477
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,392
Let me place my knives.

478
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,235
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
for a riot of thrills.

479
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:23,794
Introducing Professor Vernon Hines,
master of the flying blades...

480
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,468
...in his sensational demonstration
of iron nerve and skill.

481
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,200
- Is the trained nurse in attendance?
- The nurse is here.

482
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,476
I'm ready.

483
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,872
I beg your forbearance.

484
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,031
I'm out of practice.

485
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,035
One, two...

486
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,915
Hey, Hinesie, put one here.

487
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,310
- Look out.
- That's a crazy girI.

488
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,351
Now if some young lady
from the audience...

489
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,272
...will stand in front of the board...

490
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,158
<i>...I'll show the act as it should be.</i>

491
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,558
- My mother loves me.
- Come on, Mae, you do it.

492
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,188
- No, don't.
- You're so big he can't miss.

493
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,669
Now cut that out. Behave yourself.

494
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,229
Eleven years
and never drew a drop of blood.

495
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,516
- I'll do it.
- Don't get foolish.

496
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,596
I'll do it.

497
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,550
Can you knock the apple
off my head, Hinesie?

498
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,756
That's the spirit, Babe.
You show them, kid.

499
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,434
- I don't think she should.
- Please, Babe, don't.

500
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,919
One, two...

501
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,395
- Where's my apple?
- I think that's enough.

502
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,198
Give it to me.

503
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,271
Hinesie,
you're making us all frightened.

504
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,510
You frightened,
how do you think I feel?

505
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,797
Come on, Hinesie. Shoot.

506
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,110
Well, now will you just
hold perfectly still?

507
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,953
- Oh, no.
- She's shaking. Goodness, she's shaking.

508
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,953
- Something awfuI's gonna happen.
- You better not, Babe.

509
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,554
All right, everybody,
will you hold still?

510
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,915
One, two...

511
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,237
Is it over?

512
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,750
Now break it up. Get that stuff
out of here now. Break it up.

513
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,912
Hey, that's an insult. My skill
has never been questioned before.

514
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,516
Go drown yourself.
Break it up, all of you, break it up.

515
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,478
My, but you're an impetuous girI.

516
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,638
Where you going, Mae?

517
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,791
No place special.

518
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,359
I tell you I'm not jealous.

519
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,954
I didn't say you were jealous,
I said you were drunk.

520
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,917
Well, you can't have everything.

521
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,471
That defiant policy is gonna get you
in trouble some day, Catherine Williams.

522
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,790
It's been working out so far.

523
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,636
Look, I've got a new policy in mind
for both you and me.

524
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,516
Let's quit fighting.

525
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,955
What fight?

526
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,112
Come here, Catherine.
The new policy.

527
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,871
Gee, Babe, you're terrific.

528
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,948
You're not so bad yourself.

529
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,477
For a superintendent.

530
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,478
Listen, I'm not the superintendent.

531
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,868
What did you do, resign?

532
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,033
Today I'm just Sid, you're just Babe.
A guy and his girI.

533
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,192
Sid, just because I kissed you,
does that make me your girI?

534
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,669
Well, anyway, the feud is over.

535
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,355
This picnic is going to be okay.

536
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,712
- Can you polka?
- Of course not.

537
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,518
Come on.

538
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,909
Don't you wanna be my girI?

539
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,355
- Why don't you answer my question?
- Do I have to?

540
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,229
Absolutely.
Now is the historic moment.

541
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,311
How about it? Do you like me?

542
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,311
Of course I do, you silly thing.

543
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,553
You do? Holy smoke, what a picnic.
What a girI. What a day.

544
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,948
Put me down.

545
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,591
<i>This is my once a year day
Once a year day</i>

546
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,318
<i>Felt the mornin ' sun
I knew that</i>

547
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,076
<i>This was my once a year day
Once a year day</i>

548
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,468
<i>Even got a kiss from you</i>

549
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,916
<i>I feel like hoppin ' up and down
Like a kangaroo</i>

550
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,152
<i>Jumpin ' fences, climbin ' trees
What pleases me is what I'll do</i>

551
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,911
<i>'Cause this is our once a year day
Once a year day</i>

552
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,991
<i>Everyone's entitled to be wild</i>

553
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,799
<i>Be a child, be a goof
Raise the roof</i>

554
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,111
<i>Once a year</i>

555
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,757
<i>This is our once a year day
Once a year day</i>

556
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,433
<i>Once a year we're jumpin ' fences</i>

557
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,151
<i>This is our once a year day
Once a year day</i>

558
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,833
<i>Once a year we lose our senses</i>

559
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,952
<i>Look at Charlie by the barn
Kissin ' Katie's ear</i>

560
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,553
<i>Charlie's wife is fightin ' mad</i>

561
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,153
<i>I'm glad it's only once a year</i>

562
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,471
<i>Look at Papa Halterbush
Claims he's 93</i>

563
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,914
<i>Actin ' like he's 22</i>

564
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,433
<i>He's chasin ' Sadie up a tree</i>

565
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,355
<i>'Cause this is his once a year day
Once a year day</i>

566
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,431
<i>Everyone's entitled to be wild</i>

567
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,273
<i>Be a child, be a goof
Raise the roof</i>

568
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,671
<i>Once a year</i>

569
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,437
No.

570
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,950
<i>This is our once a year day
Once a year day</i>

571
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,236
<i>Everyone's entitled to be wild</i>

572
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,594
When you first come here after
that picnic last week, Katie says to me:

573
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,116
"Don't be a pest.
Don't talk too darn much. "

574
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,748
Might be a lot worse
if I didn't talk at all, eh, Sid?

575
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,909
You're right.

576
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,436
I always says a railroad man can't
be too much of a doggone pest...

577
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,079
<i>...because he ain't home enough.</i>

578
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,155
- You go on your run tonight, don't you?
- Yes, off to Milwaukee, doggone it.

579
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,677
Say, Sid, here's something
you don't see every day.

580
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,077
- What is it?
- A petrified bat.

581
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,951
Oh, Pop. Sid is not interested
in petrified bats.

582
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,190
What the heck, dear,
I didn't say he was.

583
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,793
Yeah, I know you.

584
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,996
The tyranny of women.

585
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,473
Well, I'm gonna get my things.
Old number 15 waits for no man.

586
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,832
Pop belt your ears off?

587
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,596
He's a great guy. I like him.
But I like you better.

588
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,671
No, no, no.

589
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,313
Wait till Pop goes out.

590
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,798
- Say, Sid, do you like stamps?
- Oh, Pop.

591
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,633
Even if he don't, that's something
that'd interest anyone.

592
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,677
Two sets of mint Columbians.

593
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,356
Late blocks on every issue since 1919.
Good night, Katie.

594
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,875
- Night, Pop.
- Come around anytime, Sid.

595
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,837
I'd like to.

596
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,070
Say, he has got a full set
of mint Columbians.

597
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,676
Sure, he has.
That's why I work at Sleeptite.

598
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,558
I feel good, Babe. Feel like home.

599
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,394
- Wonder if we've got any onions.
- Onions?

600
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,869
Gonna make a western.
You want one?

601
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,715
That's my baby boy,
she wants a western.

602
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,312
No, honey. I do not want a western.

603
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,233
Food is not uppermost
in my thoughts at the moment.

604
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,318
- I suppose you want some coffee too.
- No, it'll keep me awake.

605
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,118
Now cut that out.

606
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,316
What's the matter, lover?

607
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,832
<i>I don't wanna talk small talk</i>

608
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,952
<i>Now that I'm alone with you</i>

<i>I don't wanna talk small talk</i>

610
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,076
<i>We've got bigger things to do</i>

611
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,917
<i>Let's not talk of the weather</i>

612
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,395
<i>Or the fashions for the fall</i>

613
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,554
<i>Why don't you stop
All this small talk?</i>

614
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,829
<i>I've got somethin ' better
For your lips to do</i>

615
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:09,710
<i>And that takes no talk</i>

616
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,916
<i>At all</i>

617
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,231
<i>I gotta buy me a dressy dress
The one that I have is such a mess</i>

618
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,674
<i>Small talk</i>

619
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,357
<i>Who will you vote for next election?
How do you like the stamp collection?</i>

620
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,589
<i>Small talk</i>

621
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,598
<i>Read in a book the other day
That halibut spawn in early May</i>

622
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,991
<i>And horses whinny and donkeys bray
And furthermore</i>

623
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,432
<i>The Pygmy tribes in Africa
May have a war</i>

624
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,716
- No?
- Yes.

625
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,031
<i>I don't wanna talk small talk</i>

626
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,509
<i>What do you think
They charge for fruit now?</i>

627
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,433
<i>Now that I'm alone with you</i>

628
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,034
<i>Got so a buck ain't worth a hoot now</i>

629
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,829
<i>- I don't wanna talk small talk
- Read where the winters</i>

630
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,513
<i>Are getting milder</i>

631
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,993
<i>- We've got bigger things to do
- And that the teenage kids are wilder</i>

632
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,393
<i>- Let's not talk of the weather
- One of these days I'll paint the kitchen</i>

633
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,839
<i>- Or the fashions for the fall
- Get Pop to put a new light switch in</i>

634
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,116
<i>Why don't you stop</i>

635
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,755
<i>All this small talk?</i>

636
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,909
<i>- Like I was saying...
- I've got something better</i>

637
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,719
<i>- What I mean is...
- For you lips</i>

638
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,519
<i>- I was only...
- To do</i>

639
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,312
- Look out, I'm cooking.
- You sure are.

640
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,589
Babe...

641
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,070
...I love you.

642
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,870
- Darling.
- Sid...

643
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,474
<i>...there's something
we've got to talk about.</i>

644
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,315
- What?
- I think you're wonderfuI, and I love you.

645
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,072
But we're in for a lot of trouble.

646
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,639
No, baby, why should we be?

647
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,360
Because something's going
to come between us.

648
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,193
- Who?
- It's not any "who. "

649
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,952
Seven and a half cents.

650
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,519
Oh, that.

651
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,150
That contract, lover, that's important.
Maybe we should face that-

652
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,392
- Don't talk such nonsense.
- Sid, you mustn't treat me like a baby.

653
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,949
- I'm not, darling.
- Then you've got to listen to me.

654
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,271
I don't know why the union
is so important to me, but it is.

655
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,715
I guess you just gotta be on a team.

656
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,075
<i>So that's why, no matter
what's with us, Sid...</i>

657
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,800
<i>...I'm gonna be fighting
for my side and fighting hard.</i>

658
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,952
All right.

659
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,195
How do you feel about me, Babe?

660
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,148
I love you terribly.

661
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,517
If we both feel the same way
about each other, isn't that enough?

662
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,908
Oh, you don't know me.

663
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,992
Babe, I love you.

664
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,669
If you can take it I can.

665
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:01,679
<i>I don't wanna talk small talk</i>

666

667
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,033

668
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:22,230
<i>And that takes no talk</i>

669
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,479
<i>- At all
- At all</i>

670
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,719
Babe, are you happy?

671
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,551
I'm not even touching the ground.

672
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,075
It's good, isn't it?

673
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,073
So good I can hardly believe it.

674
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,753
Tell me.

675
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,309
- Again?
- Tell me.

676
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,755
- I love you.
- Tell me.

677
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,835
I love you more than all the heroes
in all the history books in the world.

678
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,468
- Tell me.
- What a woman. I'll tell you.

679
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,960
<i>There once was a man
Who loved a woman</i>

680
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,916
<i>She was the one he slew a dragon for</i>

681
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,433
<i>They say that nobody ever
Loved as much as he</i>

682
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,878
<i>But me, I love you more</i>

683
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,589
<i>- Tell me.
- And there once was a man</i>

684
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,672
<i>Who loved a woman</i>

685
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,355
<i>She was the one
He gave his kingdom for</i>

686

<i>They say that nobody ever
Loved as much as he</i>

687
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,079
<i>But me, I love you more</i>

688
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,634
<i>My love is a giant, fierce and defiant
But how can I prove it to you?</i>

689
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,110
<i>Ain't got no kingdom, no dragon
To back up my braggin '</i>

690
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,918
<i>How can I show what I would do?</i>

691
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:13,996
<i>I only know there once was a man
Who loved a woman</i>

692
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,869
<i>She was the one he ate that apple for</i>

<i>But me, I love you more</i>

695
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,148
Tell me.

696
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,598
<i>There once was a woman
Who loved a man</i>

697
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,792
<i>He was the one

698

<i>They say that nobody ever

Who loved a man</i>

701
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,316
<i>He was the one
She swam the channel for</i>

702
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,798
<i>They say that nobody ever
Loved as much as she</i>

703
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,159
<i>But me, I love you more</i>

704
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,279
<i>My love's meteoric
It's merely historic</i>

705
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,795
<i>A whirlwind, a cyclone on wheels</i>

706
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,111
<i>It rocks the whole solar plexus
It's bigger 'n Texas</i>

707
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,872
<i>I just can't tell you how it feels</i>

708
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,592
<i>I only know there once was a woman
Who loved a man</i>

709
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,517
<i>Loved him enough
To cause the Trojan War</i>

710

<i>They say that nobody ever
Loved as much as she</i>

711
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,632
<i>But me, I love you more
An ' more, an ' more, an ' more</i>

712
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,712
<i>- More than a hangman loves his rope
- More than a dope fiend loves his dope</i>

713
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,589
<i>- More than an Injun loves his scalps
- More than a yodeler loves his Alps</i>

714
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,988
- More.
- More.

715
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,230
<i>- There once was a man
- There once was a woman</i>

716
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,517
<i>- Who loved a woman
- Who loved a man</i>

717
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,468
<i>- She was the one he slew the dragon for
- He was the one that she took poison for</i>

718
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,474
<i>- They say nobody loved as much as she

<i>- But me, I love you more
- But me, I love you more</i>

720
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,790
<i>- But me
- But me</i>

721
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,034
<i>- I love you more
- I love you more</i>

722
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,755
I wanna be fair.
That's what I keep telling you.

723
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,638
That's my whole principle
of business.

724
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,429
I want my relations with the union
to be as pleasant as possible.

725
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,830
The committee's in there
talking to Mr. Hasler.

726
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,672
Well, I'm steering clear of that.

727
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,638
- I'll go get my lunch.
- We ate already.

728
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,072
Let's not adjourn
with any hard feelings.

729
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,118
We must preserve
that fine Sleeptite spirit.

730
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,192
That's easy to say, Mr. Hasler,
but we're not getting anyplace.

731
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,750
- We're going backwards.
- I didn't say no. I said, not now.

732
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,117
Look, Mr. Hasler, this thing has been
dragging on for months.

733
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,078
The help are getting jumpy.
Their patience is about wore out.

734
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,468
I wanna be fair.

735
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,790
I'm gonna tell you
the plain truth, Mr. Hasler.

736
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,269
We know the company's doing
one heck of a business.

737
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,829
We don't have no education,
but we got eyes and ears.

738
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,231
Everybody in the industry has had a
7- and-a-half-cent raise but us.

739
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,393
As I said, I wanna be fair.
That's always been my policy.

740
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,632
So I don't give you a yes
and I don't give you a no.

741
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,076
I say that we have to examine it
and I have to talk to the board.

742
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,276
That's just the way
we're gonna leave it.

743
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,159
Sure. Come on.

744
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,238
I told you we wouldn't get no place.

745
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,915
- Looks like another run around, Prez.
- He's a fighter, he says. What a line.

746
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,435
Well, what do we do now?

747
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,318
- Slowdown.
- Attaboy, this is it.

748
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,993
You know what to do.

749
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,476
Slowdown.

750
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,235
Slowdown.

751
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,508
Slowdown.

752
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,432
You're in charge of this room, Babe.

753
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,750
- I got you.
- Go to it.

754
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,115
Go to your places.

755
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,952
Steam room.

756
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,428
Something's wrong here.
What's the matter?

757
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,719
I guess I'm just overworked
or something, Mr. Hines.

758
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,713
Ever since lunch I just
can't get the hang of it.

759
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,472
Well, I think I get the hang of it.

760
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,677
I'm gonna see the superintendent
on what's going on around here.

761
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,993
<i>Hurry up</i>

762
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,514
<i>Hurry up</i>

763
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,269
<i>- Hurry up
- Can't waste time</i>

764
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,749
<i>- Hurry up
- Can't waste time</i>

765
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,354
<i>- When you're racing with the clock
- Can't waste time</i>

766
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,988
<i>- When you're racing with the clock
- Hurry up</i>

767
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,993
<i>- And the second hand
- Hurry up</i>

768
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,914
<i>- Doesn't understand
- Hurry up</i>

769
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:16,200
<i>That your back may break</i>

770
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:21,957
<i>And your fingers ache</i>

771
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:28,639
<i>And your constitution</i>

772
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,469
<i>Isn't made of-</i>

773
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,996
All right, just a minute.
Now listen to me.

774
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,072
This is a nice show you're
putting on here, but I don't like it.

775
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,550
My job's to turn out goods
and that's what we're gonna do.

776
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,474
You have a contract.
I didn't make it but it's there.

777
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,029
I want a day's work for a day's pay.

778
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,998
I can still hire and fire
around here, you know.

779
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,912
Now let's go.

780
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,072
Somebody jammed the line.

781
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,878
Who did that?

782
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,512
I did.

783
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,191
You're fired.

784
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,791
I am?

785
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,119
Yes.

786
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,871
Well, that's just fine.

787
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,837
I haven't had
a vacation in three years.

788
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,479
I need one.

789
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,751
So long, girls.

790
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,918
Get Charlie.

791
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,358
We'll be operating again in 15 minutes.
Now clear out till I call you back.

792
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,790
I have a fuse and a switch.

793
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,598
Boy, look out.

794
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,991
Did you get burned?

795
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,353
Yeah.

796
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,953
Twice.

797
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,555
What's going on down at the plant,
you all know as good as I.

798
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,952
And any members of the type I run into
from time to time who say:

799
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,556
"What good is a union?
Why should I pay my dues?"

800
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,075
Why, they could get
a mighty good object lesson...

801
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,119
...from where would they be now
in this battle for the 7 and a half cents...

802
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,669
<i>...that they wouldn't get
if it wasn't for the union.</i>

803
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,512
What's sure as shooting
gonna get it.

804
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,072
So leave us all remember...

805
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,631
...that our union should be first
and foremost in our minds...

806
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,999
...next only to our loved ones
and the tiny tots and kiddies.

807
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,677
Now before we break up, we're
gonna have a little entertainment...

808
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,798
<i>...and I hope you're gonna show
a special courtesy tonight.</i>

809
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,748
A couple of the cutting room boys is
got up an act with Gladys Hotchkiss...

810
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,478
...who is from the front office.

811
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:18,270
And if these good folk is good enough to
come down here and do this act for us...

812
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,319
...why, the least you can do is not
to sneak out the back way like last time.

813
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,549
<i>The little number they got worked up
is something that's right on the nose...</i>

814
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,553
<i>...because it's about getting hot.
And fellow union members...</i>

815
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,314
<i>...that's what we're doing.
Getting hot.</i>

816
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,991
Where'd you get the hat?

817
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,794
Quiet. Quiet. Shut up, everybody.

818
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,874
<i>Yeah</i>

819
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,271
<i>I got steam heat</i>

820
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,750
<i>I got steam heat</i>

821
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,117
<i>I got steam heat</i>

822
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,477
<i>But I need your love
To keep away the cold</i>

823
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,791
<i>I got steam heat</i>

824
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,236
<i>I got steam heat</i>

825
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,710
<i>I got steam heat</i>

826
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,509
<i>But I can't get warm
Without your hand to hold</i>

827
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,877
<i>The radiator's hissin '
Still I need your kissin '</i>

828
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,349
<i>To keep me from freezin ' each night</i>

829
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:36,239
<i>I got a hot water bottle
But nothin ' I got'll take the place of you</i>

830
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,958
<i>Holdin ' me tight</i>

831
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,430
<i>I got steam heat</i>

832
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,831
<i>I got steam heat</i>

833
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,470
<i>I got steam heat</i>

834
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,916
<i>But I need your love
To keep away the cold</i>

835
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,789
<i>They told me to shovel more coal
In the boiler</i>

836
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,034
<i>They told me to shovel more coal
In the boiler</i>

837
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,273
<i>They told me to shovel more coal
In the boiler</i>

838
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,760
<i>But that don't do no good</i>

839
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,233
<i>They told me to pour some more oil
In the burner</i>

840
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,519
<i>They told me to pour some more oil
In the burner</i>

841
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,793
<i>They told me to pour some more oil
In the burner</i>

842
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,676
<i>But that don't do no good</i>

843
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,911
<i>- Coal in the boiler
- No good</i>

844
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,592
<i>- Oil in the burner
- No good</i>

845
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,829
<i>- Cold?
- No</i>

846
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,989
<i>- Hot?
- Yes</i>

847
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,320
<i>Yes, yes, yes
Come on, union, get hot</i>

848
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,719
<i>But I need your love
To keep away the cold</i>

849
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,916
<i>I need your love</i>

850
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,515
<i>To keep away</i>

851
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,270
<i>The cold</i>

852
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,117
Yeah.

853
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:54,469
Listen, Mae, pay attention to the meeting
and quit guzzling all that free beer.

854
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,108
I ain't guzzling,
I'm just being sociable.

855
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,236
Sure, Mae's got to
keep her strength up.

856
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,551
We can't just sit around here and
do nothing. We gotta make plans.

857
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,312
Hasler ain't gonna give in easy.

858
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,597
- We got the slowdown.
- I mean other things.

859
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,954
More like, for instance...

860
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,078
...like, why, this suggestion
I got here from Jake Fondermeyer.

861
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,152
He says when he was working
at the Ironclad Overall Company...

862
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,198
...and they was having trouble,
why, they spit tobacco juice...

863
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,430
...in the back hip pockets
of the overalls.

864
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,636
I draw the line at chewing tobacco.

865
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,711
I wasn't suggesting that.

866
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,314
How about if the packers
put the size large bottoms...

867
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,436
...with the size small tops?
And like that?

868
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,798
Sure. Now, that's what I mean.
That's constructive.

869
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,633
- Excuse me.
- That's clear thinking.

870
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,392
Hello.

871
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,554
Sure. Sure, I recognize your voice.

872
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,518
- But that won't take effect soon enough.
- No, I suppose not.

873
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,908
Yes, I am.

874
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,354
Let's be practical.

875
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,069
<i>No, I can't talk now.
I've been away three days and...</i>

876
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,996
I'm gonna break down
and have another beer.

877
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,078
Look, I have several people here.

878
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,995
It wouldn't do any good anyway.
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

879
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,479
Babe.

880
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,119
They were saying...

881
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,714
Well, look, I don't
wanna get Babe into trouble.

882
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,269
What trouble can you get me into?
I'm fired already.

883
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,874
Well, the union ought to do
something about that too.

884
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,873
If she hadn't stood right up
and said she did it, we could've.

885
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,476
But if somebody up and admits they
been busting the company property...

886
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,474
Listen, here's a confidence
just inside the committee.

887
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,598
Some of the buttons
ain't being sewed on so good.

888
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,194
Wait till the salesmen
come screaming back to Hasler.

889
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,555
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Williams.

890
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,948
Oh, big meeting, huh?

891
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,348
- Hiya, honey.
- Hiya, Pop.

892
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,748
Don't let me interrupt.

893
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,433
Well, that's about it, anyhow.

894
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,828
- Sure.
- Okay.

895
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,309
And let's be thinking of new ways
to jam things up.

896
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,708
All right.

897
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,311
Let me take you home, huh, Mae?

898
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,471
I don't mind.

899
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,676
Well, I gotta step on it.

900
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,831
- Can you give me a lift?
- Sure, come on.

901
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,711
You can drop me off at the drugstore.

902
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,108
- Night, Babe.
- Night.

903
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,236
- And thanks for the beer.
- Okay.

904
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,960
Oh, don't be so nervous.

905
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,109
That's what I like about picnics.
They bring people together.

906
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,679
They sure do.

907
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,116
I never thought you was aware
I was alive, untiI that day.

908
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,793
How could I miss you?

909
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,475
You're the kind that stands out
in a crowd. Know what I mean?

910
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,357
- I thought I told-
- Have you really been away?

911
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,308
Sure. I went to Chicago
to visit the Lincoln Park Zoo.

912
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,199
Just because we're on different
sides, is that any reason...

913
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,477
- ... for you and me to get all balled up?
- Looks like it, doesn't it?

914
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,710
Not to me, it doesn't.

915
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,394
What kind of a queen
are you anyway?

916
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,198
Haven't you heard?

917
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,476
<i>I'm the sweetheart of Local 343...</i>

918
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,633
...Amalgamated Shirt and Pajama
Workers of America.

919
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:19,396
My gosh, Sid, I warned you.
I told you. You know?

920
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,755
You knew all about how I felt.

921
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,959
I happen to think there are certain things
a person has to stand for in this life.

922
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,918
But I guess you forgot about that.

923
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,152
I forget nothing.
They pay me to run a factory.

924
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:37,348
So run the factory. You stick
to your side and I'll stick to mine.

925
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,838
Listen, Miss Williams.

926
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,710
I love you.

927
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,518
corny, ain't it?

928
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,628
Did you hear me?

929
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:52,116
Babe, can't you see my side of it?
I can't faiI at this.

930
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,794
I was a foreman
when I bluffed my way into this job...

931
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,155
<i>...and I'm gonna fight to stay here.</i>

932
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,232
Now that I've got you in my plans
I'm fighting even harder.

933
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,073
Watch those hands, tycoon.

934
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,470
Well, here we are. Oh, hello, Sid.
I thought I heard your voice.

935
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,710
What you got there, Pop,
your stamp album?

936
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,077
Now don't get excited. Sid don't
wanna look at it, he doesn't have to.

937
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,800
There's no law against
my looking at it, is there?

938
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,474
Sid likes stamps, he told me so.

939
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,193
But me, I'm just plain bushed, so if you
don't mind I think I'll slide off to bed.

940
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,032
Run along, honey. Good night, dear.

941
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,317
Good night. Sleep well.

942
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,993
Thanks.

943
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,759
Sid...

944
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:41,109
...suppose we start with the
Pan-American Exposition issue of 1901.

945
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,714
I guess that's as good a place
to start off as any.

946
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,229
<i>Hey, there</i>

947
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:06,234
<i>You with the stars in your eyes</i>

948
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,390
<i>Love never made a fool of you</i>

949
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:20,710
<i>You used to be too wise</i>

950
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,839
<i>Hey, there</i>

951
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:32,150
<i>You on that high-flyin ' cloud</i>

952
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:39,998
<i>Though you've been acting cold
To him</i>

953
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,269
<i>You know your heart</i>

954
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,475
<i>Is sold to him</i>

955
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,880
<i>Get on the ball, girl</i>

956
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,511
<i>Just take it all in your stride</i>

957
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,919
<i>Don't let him make you fall apart</i>

958
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:15,072
<i>You've always had such pride</i>

959
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,878
<i>Won't you take this advice</i>

960
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:30,714
<i>I hand you like a brother</i>

961
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:39,310
<i>Or are you not seein ' things
Too clear?</i>

962
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,796
<i>Are you too much</i>

963
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,793
<i>In love...</i>

964
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,478
Hines, this is an emergency, come on.

965
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,991
The whole country is on the skids.

966
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,550
Here I am right now with employees
openly defiant of top management.

967
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,188
Look, Mr. Hasler, maybe if we
offered a compromise.

968
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,318
Not untiI there's ice
in Hades three feet thick.

969
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,708
I'm a fighter, Sorokin.

970
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,598
We got hundreds of orders to get out.

971
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,957
That's right, Mr. Hasler. Now here's
this letter from Marx and Klein-

972
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,715
Marx and Klein. Wholesalers.
Doggone chain outfit.

973
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,077
Doggone communists.
Want another price cut, I suppose.

974
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:40,038
- I been looking for you, Mr. Hasler.
- Where'd you come from?

975
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,715
- You look like a medium. I need you.
- What on earth is going on around here?

976
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,916
- Take your pants off.
- I'll do no such thing.

977
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,550
Mr. Hasler, this is life and death
to the Sleeptite organization.

978
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,632
- I want him to model these pajamas.
- Hines, take your pants off.

979
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,597
Okay, chief.

980
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,988
- Me? Honest?
- Come on.

981
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,149
- Come on.
- What a day.

982
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,993
I'm a very busy man.
I'm a time-study man, not a model.

983
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,152
- This is all for Sleeptite, mister.
- Hines, put those pajamas on.

984
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,039
Hurry it up. Let's get it
over with. Whatever it is.

985
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,111
Mr. Hasler, I want you
to get the picture.

986
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,999
I'm showing Mr. charley Robertson
of the Robertson Brothers.

987
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,754
I ain't some type salesmen
who believes in half measures.

988
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,753
Whenever I have a sample room,
I do what we got Hinesie doing.

989
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,071
I model the pants myself. I don't-

990
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,710
BeautifuI styling.
What more do you want?

991
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,792
Now wait. Here I am in Peoria,
I'm modeling the pants.

992
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,350
Mr. Robertson and his buyers are
impressed with the line and ready to buy.

993
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,953
- Get the picture?
- Go on, go on.

994
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,997
I hope there's some point to all this.

995
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,435
Hines, take a deep breath.
Stick out your stomach.

996
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,828
This is truly ridiculous.

997
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,595
Bear in mind I got these pajamas
out of stock. Right out of the box.

998
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,194
Go on, Hines, breathe.
Take a big breath.

999
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,636
He said to breathe. Breathe.
Let's get it over with.

1000
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,068
My gosh.

1001
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,639
No, leave them lay.

1002
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,234
- What are you doing? Playing games?
- Let me see those.

1003
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,073
They're all like that. Every one.
Boxes and boxes of them.

1004
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,755
- Well, what's the idea? Who did this?
- Somebody's got a sense of humor.

1005
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,399
What are you talking about?

1006
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,630
- Two threads in every waistband button.
- What?

1007
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,472
They're not sewed on.
Only two threads.

1008
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,598
- Somebody's being very cute.
- Cute? Sabotage. Open rebellion.

1009
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,558
- On the other hand it may be just-
- Oh, put your pants on.

1010
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,676
- Sorry, boss.
- What did you do, Vernon?

1011
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,068
I didn't do anything.

1012
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,356
I'll be the laughing stock
of the pajama game.

1013
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,829
What'd this Robertson do
when your pants fell down?

1014
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,718
He laughed, Mabel.
No sense of humor.

1015
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,599
Hold the orders till we check
the stock. I'll be right down.

1016
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,479
- Come on, Max.
- They think they can lick Myron Hasler...

1017
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,428
...they got another guess coming.
I'll go down and fire the whole factory.

1018
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,116
I'll naiI it up, board it down. And, Hines,
I want an individual time report...

1019
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,669
...on each individual worker.
I don't care if they-

1020
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,389
- I got an individual...
- Oh, no. My vice president.

1021
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,429
Partly your fault. Well, do something.
Rip it. Tear it loose.

1022
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,989
Now, Mr. Hasler, in this letter
from Marx and Klein-

1023
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,879
Don't bother me with letters
from Marx and Klein or anybody.

1024
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,191
Gladys, don't forget the meeting
of the board of directors tomorrow.

1025
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,397
Two threads. That's what I've got
to tell them. Two threads.

1026
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,114
- We gotta recall an awfuI lot of orders.
- How many?

1027
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,998
- They're gonna let us know.
- Sabotage.

1028
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,388
- Mr. Hasler.
- Yeah?

1029
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,838
- I'd like to make a pitch.
- Pitch? All right, pitch ahead.

1030
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,991
Let me make my position clear.

1031
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,913
I'm for the company
first, last and always.

1032
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,039
But labor problems have got to end up
in one way. Compromise.

1033
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:30,796
Sorokin, you've been around here
long enough to learn something.

1034
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,713
But you seem a little slow.

1035
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,348
- I'm a fighter. Keep your dukes up.
- Yes, but-

1036
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,795
Don't waste your breath on me,
keep your dukes up.

1037
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,590
Hey, cheer up.

1038
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,196
- Yeah. "Keep your dukes up. "
- What?

1039
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,909
Mr. Hasler wants me
to take boxing lessons.

1040
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,072
You certainly are a character.

1041
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,469
I'd like to get some information
out of you too.

1042
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,437
What kind?

1043
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,352
Double entry.

1044
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,833
Well, you're not gonna
get any information.

1045
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,956
So there.

1046
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,554
I'm a desperate man. I hate to ask
a cute kid like you to do me a favor.

1047
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,269
Sid, dear, you wouldn't want me to
violate a trust, would you?

1048
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,591
I sure would, if it'd help
unsnarI things around here.

1049
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,159
Why is that so important?

1050
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,952
Because my future depends upon the
titanic struggle for pajama survival.

1051
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,519
You're a scream.

1052
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,752
- And I just feel that if-
- No, no. Not that.

1053
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,356
I wouldn't ask you to show it to me.
Just leave it around.

1054
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,479
No. Besides, it's locked anyhow.

1055
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,950
I know a sexy dame
who'd lend me the key.

1056
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,678
Oh, you think so?

1057
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,990
Well, it'd be fun
trying to persuade her.

1058
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,276
It might be fun to have you try.

1059
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,509
- Well, I gotta go now.
- No. Wait.

1060
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,193
For what?

1061
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,237
Let's go out tonight.

1062
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,868
Well, I hope you're not serious
about that key.

1063
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,918
I don't feel like being serious
about anything.

1064
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,828
You're busy, huh?

1065
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,835
No. I sure would like to.

1066
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,918
Oh, gee, where will you take me?

1067
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,150
Anyplace you say.

1068
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,072
I know a wonderfuI joint.

1069
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,151
<i>I know a dark, secluded place</i>

1070
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,149
<i>A place where no one
Knows your face</i>

1071
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:50,548
<i>A glass of wine
A fast embrace</i>

1072
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,437
<i>It's called Hernando's Hideaway
Ol</i>

1073
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,276
<i>All you see are silhouettes</i>

1074
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,508
<i>And all you hear are castanets</i>

1075
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,119
<i>And no one cares how late it gets</i>

1076
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:12,956
<i>Not at Hernando's Hideaway
Ol</i>

1077
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,395
<i>At the Golden Fingerbowl
Or anyplace you go</i>

1078
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:30,115
<i>You will meet your uncle Max
And everyone you know</i>

1079
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,873
<i>Soon you are sitting close
And making love to me</i>

1080
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,354
<i>You may take my heart
You may take my soul</i>

1081
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,352
<i>But not my key</i>

1082
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,513
<i>Just knock three times
And whisper low</i>

1083
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,832
<i>That you and I were sent by Joe</i>

1084
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,118
<i>Then strike a match
And you will know</i>

1085
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:04,991
<i>You're in Hernando's Hideaway
Ol</i>

1086
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,195
- Fresh.
- Who's that?

1087
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:28,514
Poopsie. Poopsie. Poopsie.

1088
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,989
Hey, buddy, this ain't Poopsie.

1089
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,914
<i>I know a dark secluded place</i>

1090
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,550
<i>A place
Where no one knows your face</i>

1091
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,919
<i>A glass of wine
A fast embrace</i>

1092
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,073
<i>It's called Hernando's Hideaway
Ol</i>

1093
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,556
Joe sent us.

1094
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:00,795
Poopsie. Poopsie.

1095
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,070
<i>At the Golden Fingerbowl
Or anyplace you go</i>

1096
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,917
<i>You'll meet your uncle Max
And everyone you know</i>

1097
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,269
<i>But if you go to the spot
That I am thinkin ' of</i>

1098
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,273
<i>You will be free</i>

1099
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,199
<i>To gaze at me</i>

1100
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,834
<i>And talk of love</i>

1101
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,436
<i>Just knock three times
And whisper low</i>

1102
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,396
<i>That you and I were sent by Joe</i>

1103
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:40,430
<i>Then strike a match
And you will know</i>

1104
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,636
<i>You're in Hernando's Hideaway
Ol</i>

1105
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,637
I wanna ask you
a personal question, Sid.

1106
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,872
- Do you like Scotch?
- No, Gladys, I don't like Scotch.

1107
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,158
Neither do I. Scotch has
a very peculiar taste to it.

1108
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,754
Kind of a Scotch-like taste?

1109
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,390
Yeah, that's it. count me out.

1110
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,438
- Is that gin?
- Yes, ma'am.

1111
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,437
You're right.

1112
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,357
You know, I can't figure you out, Sid.

1113
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,832
I guess when you first came here, you
caught on I thought you were cute.

1114
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,195
But you never gave me
a tumble till tonight.

1115
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,750
I told you what I was up to, didn't I?

1116
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,478
I forget. Tell me again.

1117
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,349
I'm gonna get you fried
and get that key away from you.

1118
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,513
You'll never get my key.
You'll never get my key.

1119
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,511
They'll hear you.

1120
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,713
You think I'm terrible, don't you?

1121
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,399
I'd be glad to take you home.

1122
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,552
No, I don't want you to, Prez.
I just asked you to bring me here.

1123
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,553
- I gotta give someone a message.
- Good evening, Miss Williams.

1124
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,280
- Shall I get you a table?
- No. I'm looking for somebody.

1125
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,475
You're welcome.

1126
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,078
- Hiya, folks.
- Howdy.

1127
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,117
- Hi, Babe.
- Hello, Poopsie.

1128
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,032
I thought
you was out bowling tonight.

1129
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,634
Yeah, I was. I came over
to give somebody a message.

1130
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,158
come on, Sid, let's dance.

1131
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,237
What's the matter, Sid?

1132
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,719
I don't feel so good.

1133
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,270
- You sick, you mean?
- Not sick, just kind of depressed.

1134
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:58,718
Oh, look, don't be repressed.

1135
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,913
Here.

1136
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,393
Look what I'm giving you. See?

1137
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,637
Well, take it.

1138
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,677
It's a lousy trick, Gladys.

1139
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,150
Well, I'll just lend it to you.
And don't tell anybody.

1140
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,390
You gotta give it back in the morning.

1141
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,788
Thanks.

1142
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,837
Hi, Babe.

1143
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,639
- Yes, hello.
- Gladys, I just-

1144
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,791
Sid and I are just old friends.

1145
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,552
- Won't you join us?
- No, thank you.

1146
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,075
I came to tell you that
Hinesie is out for blood.

1147
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,798
He was over at the bowling alley.

1148
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,076
He knows you two are out,
and he's going crazy.

1149
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,468
Oh, Hinesie.

1150
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,198
- And he's got a knife.
- The fooI.

1151
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:40,559
He's always got a knife.
He's living in the past.

1152
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,950
That's not healthy, you think so, Sid?

1153
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,351
<i>Look, I didn't come here to be funny.
And I didn't come here because...</i>

1154
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:51,071
<i>...I'm craving your company or because
I wanna join your party or anything.</i>

1155
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:56,678
- I came to tell you that he's dangerous.
- He talks dangerous, but he isn't.

1156
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,149
I think I'll take a nap.

1157
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,119
Babe.

1158
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,998
Move over.

1159
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:20,036
Prez, pay up for me and
take Gladys home, will you?

1160
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:24,318
Gladys? Sure. Sure, Sid, glad to.

1161
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,074
Got some important
bookkeeping to do.

1162
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,951
Her is the cutest one.

1163
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,518
I remember you.

1164
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,999
I'm gonna take you home.

1165
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,358
All right. But wait a minute,
I gotta take another nap.

1166
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:01,073
Oh, I see you.
You don't need to drop anything.

1167
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,515
You abandoned woman, you hussy.

1168
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:08,959
After the way you behaved? Taking your
pants off in Mr. Hasler's office?

1169
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,476
Don't touch me.

1170
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,473
I'm out with friends.

1171
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,875
And I'm glad I never married you.

1172
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,036
<i>- Hello.
- Hello. This is Sorokin, Mr. Hasler.</i>

1173
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,556
Sorry to get you out so early,
but it's important I talk to you at once.

1174
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,153
<i>Okay, I'll be there right away.</i>

1175
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,191
Thanks, I'll be waiting for you.

1176
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,999
The committee from the union's
outside waiting to see you.

1177
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,991
Yeah, I sent for them.

1178
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,752
Come in.

1179
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,277
<i>I'm sorry to drag you here,
but I know you're having a union rally...</i>

1180
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,829
- ... and I wanna talk to you first.
- That's okay, Sid.

1181
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,878
I think I got ahold of some facts
that may clean up this mess.

1182
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:18,079
It better be quick. Either we get the
7 and a half cents or we vote to strike.

1183
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,119
What I wanna ask is, will you keep the
rally going till I get there and talk to you?

1184
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,032
- What about?
- About solving this thing.

1185
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,077
There ought to be a time limit.

1186
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,470
All right. You're gonna parade first.

1187
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,437
- We sure are.
- That'll give me time.

1188
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,795
Well, that's fair enough.

1189
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,395
Oh, Miss Williams,
can I speak to you?

1190
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,154
- We'll wait for you downstairs, Babe.
- Okay.

1191
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,676
- I know explanations are lousy-
- Oh, no.

1192
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,956
Babe, you've gotta give me
a chance to explain.

1193
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,714
I don't want explanations.
It's humiliating.

1194
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,998
- But you mustn't think that-
- I don't think anything, Sid. I don't care.

1195
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,674
If it's about you and Gladys,
it's none of my business.

1196
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,193
But it is your business.

1197
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,954
Oh, please, I'm talking about
something bigger than that.

1198
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,954
This is just great. can't we even talk
to each other and make sense anymore?

1199
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,793
I don't see how. Not till this is over.

1200
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,396
I've been eating mud long enough.
I've had it.

1201
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,997
Well, then, what do you suggest?

1202
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,998
Meet me after the rally tonight.

1203
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,952
I can't. I have a date.

1204
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,960
Well, that's that.

1205
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,672
I'll break it.

1206
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,791
I saw you.

1207
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,357
Now, Vernon, cut that out.

1208
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:37,238
You're just crazy, that's all.
I'll call the police.

1209
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:47,279
You drove me too far this time.
You'll find out.

1210
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,391
I know you're just trying
to scare me, but...

1211
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,713
Help. Sid, Sid, you gotta do something.
v ernon's not fooling this time.

1212
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,677
- Just calm yourself.
- But he's after me.

1213
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,910
- He's been following me.
- I'll fix everything.

1214
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,470
I'll take him aside
and tell him the whole story.

1215
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,915
In the meantime, here's your key.

1216
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,679
Listen. I thought I heard something.

1217
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,871
You maniac. Hinesie, you idiot.

1218
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,196
I'm sure glad
he got that out of his system.

1219
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,157
But how do you know he has?
How do you-?

1220
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,869
Cut it out, Gladys.
Everything is gonna be all right.

1221
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,195
- You gotta stop him.
- I'll fix that, baby.

1222
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:54,434
Well, all right, I'm here. I hope
this call turns out to be important. Wh-?

1223
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,830
What's going on around here?

1224
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,752
Look.

1225
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,672
Look.

1226
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,708
Now, that's not nice.

1227
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,153
I don't like this.
This is company property, Sorokin.

1228
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,639
I better explain, Mr. Hasler.

1229
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,314
Well, I think somebody
had better explain-

1230
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,228
- They're out to murder me.
- I'll stop that.

1231
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,753
- Call the police.
- Yes, sir.

1232
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,957
It's a plot to murder me. They've
imported gangsters from Chicago.

1233
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,839
- It's the old Al capone mob.
- I don't think so, Mr. Hasler.

1234
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,831
Don't argue with me.
See those knives?

1235
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,833
- That's the work of foreigners.
- But, Mr. Hasler...

1236
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,990
Hines, where you been? On the job, man.
The place is full of gangsters.

1237
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:37,152
- They're out to get me.
- They're not after you, they're after me.

1238
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,709
Why doesn't somebody do something?
Get me the police.

1239
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,950
- You don't wanna arrest Hines, do you?
- Hines?

1240
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,076
- He was trying to kill me.
- He was?

1241
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,673
Hines, suppose you'd succeeded.

1242
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,559
And me in the middle
of labor troubles. Suppose you hit him.

1243
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,439
I could've hit him.
I was just trying to scare them.

1244
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,239
This why you called me to come
down here and risk my life?

1245
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,597
I called because there's gonna be a
strike tomorrow unless you listen.

1246
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,354
- Gladys, have his head patched up.
- All right, Vernon.

1247
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,829
Leave me alone. I'm a fighter,
I am. Dukes up.

1248
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,275
Come on, tiger.

1249
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,272
- Mr. Hasler.
- Yeah?

1250
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,556
I'm going
before the board of directors.

1251
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,598
- You are what?
- If I can't solve this in any other way.

1252
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,797
- Solve what? Sometimes-
- I've been up all night with your ledger.

1253
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,793
<i>- What did you say?
- I apologize. I know you didn't hire me...</i>

1254
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:25,430
...as a safecracker but I had to get
some facts. I been through your books.

1255
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,388
That 7 and a half cents
was added to the cost six months ago.

1256
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:32,996
I can put you in jaiI,
that's what I can do. Put you in jaiI.

1257
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,869
<i>You can't. But you can give that raise.
If you don't, I'll go before the board...</i>

1258
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,271
...and tell them the situation and how
many orders have been cancelled.

1259
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,954
- Not one single-
- There's a dozen cancellations.

1260
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,076
You're costing
the company thousands.

1261
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:48,232
Mabel tried to tell you all day
yesterday about Marx and Klein.

1262
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,517
And if this operation folds up,
I fold with it, and I don't want to.

1263
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,592
So do me a favor.
Sit down and talk to me.

1264
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,638
We're sure to win, ain't we, Prez?

1265
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,998
What kind of question is that?
Sure we are. Babe'll tell you.

1266
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,311
The answer is yes. That's the answer
to everything tonight.

1267
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,994
Babe and me was up half the night
figuring things out.

1268
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:20,232
I got it all written down on paper.

1269
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,594
<i>I figured it out</i>

1270
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,348
<i>I figured it out</i>

1271
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,839
<i>With a pencil and a pad
I figured it out</i>

1272
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,516
<i>Seven and a half cents
Doesn't buy a heck of a lot</i>

1273
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:35,116
<i>Seven and a half cents
Doesn't mean a thing</i>

1274
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,829
<i>But give it to me every hour
Forty hours every week</i>

1275
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,878
<i>That's enough for me to be
Livin ' like a king</i>

<i>Only five years from today</i>

1283
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:11,148
Five years. Now let's see, that's 260
weeks times 40 hours every week.

1284
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,915
And roughly two-and-a-quarter hours
overtime, at time and a half for overtime.

1285
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,910
Comes to exactly $852.74.

1286
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,474
<i>That's enough for me to get
An automatic washing machine</i>

1287

<i>A year's supply of gasoline
Carpeting for the living room</i>

<i>Only 10 years from today</i>

1302
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,917
Ten years.

1303
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,308
Now, let's see.

1304
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,119
That's 520 weeks,
times 40 hours every week.

Comes to exactly $ 1705.48.

1307
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:33,508
<i>That's enough for me to buy

<i>A motor boat and water skis

01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:48,473
Mr. Hasler's here, and he thinks
he can settle this strike.

Okay. Okay, Mr. Hasler.

This strife within our ranks
has disturbed me more than you know.

1347
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:21,949
And I think that you realize

1348
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:25,510
...that there is only one way
out of a thing like this.

1349
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,432
That's to compromise.

01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,589
And Sleeptite
wants to meet you halfway.

1351

We offer a compromise.

1352
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:38,354
We'll give you
7 and a half cents...

1353
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:42,479
...if you give up the claim
to retroactive pay.

1354
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:45,518
- We ain't giving up nothing.
- Wait a minute. Don't you see?

1355
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:46,908
We've won.

1356
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,069
We won.

1357
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,957
We won. We won.

1358
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,072
Sid.

1359
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:13,119
You were so wonderfuI.
I could kiss you.

1360
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:17,312
I don't wanna get kissed
for settling a strike.

1361
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,755
<i>Of course if it's anything personal...</i>

1362
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,150
It's very personal.

1363
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:28,958
And I say to you again
in this hour of decision...

1364
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,351
...that our responsibility
to the garment industry...

1365
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:36,150
...ring like a battle cry
throughout the land.

1366
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:41,155
Production must increase.
Cost must go down.

1367
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:46,030
And, fellow Sleeptiters,
I just want to say...

1368
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,476
...that this demonstration
of harmony in our factory...

1369
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:53,553
...strikes something
deep down inside me.

1370
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:59,113
And I know that this party of yours
is going to be a great success...

1371
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:05,628
...because it stems from that genuine
spirit of Sleeptite solidarity.

1372
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,154
We say okay to that, M.H.

1373
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,437
So on with our tribute
to Sleeptite pajamas.

1374
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,070
And now on with
the Sleeptite fashion parade.

1375
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:24,879
Wear Sleeptite at all social functions.

1376
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,910
<i>Dresses are fine
But Sleeptite's divine</i>

1377
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:44,509
Sleeptite has everything:
Grace, style and comfort.

1378
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,477
- I'm grace.
- I'm style.

1379
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,119
I'm comfort.

1380
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,753
Wear Sleeptite for happy family life.

1381
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:02,872
<i>Now I trust her night and day
That's true love the Sleeptite way</i>

1382
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,193
And another point:
Sleeptite is economical.

1383
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,349
<i>Married life is lots of fun</i>

1384
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,750
<i>Two can sleep as cheap as one</i>

1385
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,471
