1
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:34,770
In the glorious town of Rostov lived a priest who had an only son.

2
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,707
His name was Alyosha, Popovich after his father.

3
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,052
Alyosha grew by leaps and bounds.

4
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,343
Alyosha learnt to read and write but nothing grew out of this.

5
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,440
So decided Alyosha to learn the art of war

6
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,537
-Mu-u!!
-Ohh....

7
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,591
- Look what your Alyoshen'ka has done..! Here!

8
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,340
-Aha...

9
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,254
Oh...Ouch! A-a-a!

10
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,084
Look, what your Alyosha's done!

11
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:37,047
At that time evil forces of Tugarin were trampling on Russian land

12
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,590
and constraining Russian people.

13
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,802
Dark forces came to exact large tribute from people of Rostov.

14
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,669
Well, what we're going to do now, Russian people?

15
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:04,850
- Hey you, people of Rostov, listen to me, Alyosha, son of priest. For how long shall we Russian people

16
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,060
suffer from the evil invaders? Let us rise and protect our wives, and our children, let us fight for the Russian land!

17
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,370
- He talks sense...
- If you want to offer something specific,

18
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,229
then go on and tell us, but if you're just wagging your tongue,
then get down from the barrel! Don't you confuse people.

19
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,697
- Tikhon, my dearest friend... bring our thought written on a paper,
give it to the people's judgment.

20
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,047
- There!
- We'll defeat Tugarin's forces by ruse.

21
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,720
We'll gather the gold tribute, put it in a cave that is under the Bayun-mountain,
and as soon as the forces

22
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,520
of Tugarin enters it, we would close the trap with a huge rock!

23
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,190
- But how are you gonna take the gold back out of the cave?

24
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:58,360
- The gold? But it... well...
- Let's just wait until those foes

25
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,170
die of starvation...
- Oh!

26
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,368
Well...or become weaker!

27
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,070
So that was what they've settled on.

28
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,480
- Thank you, God, that you've granted Alyosha
with a plan of our salvation!

29
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:22,600
So people of Rostov started gathering gold tribute.
All the treasures they had

30
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,991
- they've gathered together.

31
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,899
- Left-right, left-right...

32
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,189
Yeah!!!

33
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,067
-O-o-o! We must go there.

34
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,367
- Here is the mussulmen tribe!

35
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,391
- Evil forces... Not much time is left for them to feast!
We'll feed them with our heroes' rage!

36
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,695
- Push it down...

37
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,576
- Yeah, our heroes' rage?

38
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,237
- Oh my!

39
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,733
- I didn't get it... Was that a plan?

40
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,170
-To impale them!
-Ah?

41
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,010
- The more I look at our people the more I wonder:
where did they get so much hatred?

42
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,900
Whether of starvation or lack of spirituality?

43
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,660
They are so upset because of the gold,
- for sure.

44
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,448
- Yes..., gold corrupts people.

45
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,640
Listen, Tikhon, until I return the gold and clear my name

46
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,519
I have nothing to do in this town. Goodbye, Tikhon.

47
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,450
- But, but, I can't let you go alone, Alyoshenka!.. Your father is gonna kill me!

48
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,220
- You, Tikhon, go back home, and explain everything to mother and father.

49
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,770
Noone but me can fight Tugarin the Snake

50
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:37,858
- Wait... good God, how would you go without a weapon,
and money, and friends?! What the hell!

51
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,938
- He can't be left alone, he'll perish.

52
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,710
- Where are you, dear son?.. And Tikhon is missing.
Probably, he's gone to help Alyosha.

53
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,580
- When I see them again, I'll skin them both...
- Don't you hasten, what if they return as heroes?

54
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,584
- It doesn't matter, I won't give them a quarter.
- Oh... - Just look what they've planned!

55
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,730
- What a rebel! Alone, barehanded will he
stand against Tugarin!

56
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,580
Well, it's ok, I'll waylay him in the forest.

57
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,050
- And I see dreams of this and that. The other day
I dreamed of Alyosha coming back

58
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,328
and sneaking quietly into the upper room.

59
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,710
- Hist... Hear that? Isn't Alyoshen'ka back?

60
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,420
- As if he'd rustle like this...
Must be a bird nestling on the roof.

61
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,130
- Aloysha!
- You're imagining things, it's just the wind blowing.

62
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,513
- About to go far, honey?

63
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,920
- I can't let it go, feel so uneasy,
he'll be lost on his own!

64
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,840
- Why do you care about the good-for-nothing? He'll be fine.
Well, if not, it is no big loss.

65
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,910
I won't let you go!
- What?! Then I'll cut off my hair and retire to a monastery

66
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,619
Male monastery!
- A-a-a, now what do you think you are doing!

67
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,910
They argued for long, but Lyubava put her foot down.
To tell the truth,

68
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,314
grandma didn't let her alone and followed her.

69
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,867
- Bogatyr, buy a steed. Buy it, you won't regret.
It's a bogatyr steed!

70
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:08,070
- Hey you, dark horde, feel the doom coming!
Fear and tremble you, mussulmen

71
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,150
for the Russian bogatyr!

72
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:17,191
- Hey da-nu-da nu da nay, hey da nuda nay!
- Come on, you jade!

73
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,675
- That's it, can't go any more... need to take a short break.

74
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,465
- You, evil foe, take the bogatyr's might.

75
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,896
- Tikhon? How come you are here?

76
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,065
- Do what you want, Alyosha, but I'll come with you.
The way will be easier to go together.

77
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,593
- Sorry, I did not recognize you.

78
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:04,090
But what is with that look?
- I thought, what would a bogatyr do without a horse. So I bought one.

79
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,983
- And why is it muzzled?
- Muzzled? Don't know, maybe it bites... Beastly thing.

80
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:23,574
- We-hee, freedom... finally! Nearly forgot native speech.
What are you looking at?

81
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,750
- A-a-a! Talking horse!
- Obsessed by demons!

82
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,710
- Again... Same reaction every time,
why are you so nervous? Calm down,

83
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,249
take a deep breath... Yes, like this.

84
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:43,042
-Wh..., this is unnecessary!
-You,demon...!

85
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,526
- How d'you like that?!
Look out!

86
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,170
-Heard that?
-Don't you think folks are in trouble?

87
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,174
-Wow..What should we do?
-Let's go help!

88
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,814
Stop, you're a girl, they'll knock you out without being noticed!

89
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,430
-But how?
-Well..First we'll hide, so when they'll need help

90
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,228
we'll be right there.

91
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,157
-Oh, pardon me..

92
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,080
- Ok, let's discuss it. Yes, I'm a talking horse, but that's not a reason to fight, is it?

93
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,000
-Don't listen to him. Cut his head off.
-What's wrong with you: cut his head off? My head

94
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,660
is worth a hundred times yours.
- How come yours is so valuable?

95
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,590
- Well, do you at least know how to read?
- I can alright...

96
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,890
You're literally making my shoes laugh. How many books have you read in your life?

97
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,580
- Look... that's enough. Where do you come from?
- He bought me from the gypsies himself! And he also

98
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,140
gave them a new shirt and boots.
- Who, me?

99
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,090
- Who else, wasn't me for sure! And he also gave them
your bogatyr sword.

100
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:02,610
- Oh my, is it true?
- Well... actually, yes. I... I thought you might need a bogatyr horse.

101
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,100
- Yeah... it will be tough without a sword.
And what's the name

102
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,740
of this bogatyr horse?
- My name is Gaius Julius Caesar, but given

103
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,267
your educational background,
you may call me just Julius.

104
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,550
- What kind of name is that?
- I was named after a great Roman

105
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,750
emperor and army leader. Before the gypsies stole me I'd been living
by the church in Novgorod.

106
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,540
They keep many interesting books there.
- Well, looks like the three of us will have to

107
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:39,200
wend our thorny way together. So, serve me well,
bogatyr horse. Do not leave me

108
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,870
dead nor wounded. Do not leave me to grey wolves to bite me to death, nor to black ravens to lacerate me,

109
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,512
nor to the foes to outrage me. From wherever we go, take me home.

110
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,534
- There is something in the bushes.
- Tikhon, you go have a look.

111
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,010
- Why me? You go yourself...
- You are the oldest here, the wisest,

112
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,901
you've lived your life...
- You go if you want to.

113
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,200
- Hey, who is hiding there in the bushes?
Show yourself and take a straight fight,

114
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,070
feel the bogatyr might.
- We're gonna throw a spear.

115
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,710
- Please don't!

116
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,770
- Lyubava?! What are you doing here?
- We've been following you from Rostov, me and grandma.

117
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,912
Forgive us, Alyoshen'ka, so uneasy my heart feels, I couldn't help it.

118
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:45,570
-Yeah..., so, what should we do now? Seems like I have to take you with me. We have to hurry up,

119
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:52,282
or we'll neither find Tugarin, or turn the money back. Meet my horse, Julius.

120
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,690
- A bogatyr steed!
- Oh!

121
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,138
- What are you staring at?
Like you've never seen a talking horse!

122
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,030
- This is Lyubava... Her grandma.
- And Moses - he is my donkey.

123
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,430
- Is he? I thought he's a pure Arab horse.

124
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,820
- Shut up, Julius.
- Shut up yourself.

125
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:22,544
- Where do we head to now, Alyoshen'ka?
- There they are, evil forces. That is where we go.

126
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:44,510
- Look, is there no other way?
Why go there at all?... Ha?

127
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:57,512
And so they decided to go further together
and to share the misfortunes and miseries of a perilous journey.

128
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:10,547
- Shall we sing a song, Tikhon,
to raise our spirits? Let's sing our, bogatyr song...

129
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:23,783
- Oh-hey e-he-he-he-oh...
- A-a-ay... Ia-a-ay

130
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:29,410
- Wait-wait-wait, guys. We're in low spirits already,
and with that song we'll get totally depressed!

131
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,660
- What's wrong with the song?
- You call that a song? Put me down. Don't make

132
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,826
my horseshoes laugh. It's outdated.
Here, catch the rythm. And one, one, one-two-three...

133
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:46,863
Tum tibi-dum tibidum tum pum.
Tum tibi-dum tibidum tum pum.

134
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:07,533
Dili-dili-dili-dili dum-hum.
Dili-dili-dili-dili dum-hum.

135
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,670
- Eh, what a noise. Left the town penniless, and don't care at all,
go singing songs.

136
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,776
- Come on, granny, that's a nice one!

137
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,982
- Phew!

138
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,096
- Ok. No bridge, no way to cross,
let's go back.

139
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:54,040
- Wait, where d'you go? There is no way back for us.
- Come, I'll show it to you.

140
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,730
- Wait you damn thng! As you're told.
- And why d'you speak up? It's not you

141
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,650
that bogatyr is having a talk to.
- Just how come you are so clever-clever?!

142
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,438
- What's the point arguing, let's think how to get across.

143
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,186
- This is what I suggest.

144
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,321
- A simple mechanism... We'll need several logs...

145
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,602
A calculation... Gravity, accelleration force...

146
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,683
That's it.

147
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,268
Well, can also do it that way.

148
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,353
- A-and... is it reliable?

149
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,360
- It is.
- No, I just mean we should save ourselves

150
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,200
for heroic deeds, it will be stupid to die like this.

151
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,460
- Well... What do you suggest then?
- Let someone who's older

152
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,054
and wiser go first...

153
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,617
- What?! I just care about our campaign to succeed!

154
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,427
- A-a-a!!
- Huh!

155
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,169
- Now where are you people, come here!

156
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,490
- Wait, why are you all so selfish?
- Now what, you nuisance?

157
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,430
- I'm fine, but what about Moses?
- What's wrong with him?

158
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,252
- Seriously, you people are funny. How will he get over the tree-trunk?
He's a donkey!

159
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,895
- I'm also afraid to go over the trunk.

160
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,502
- Heh... Phew!

161
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,465
- A-a!
- Granny...

162
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,040
- Wow, that's what I call a woman!

163
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,945
Listen, Tikhon, give her a closer look. Why not? You'll
be as safe as houses! And so will your household...

164
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,372
- Thank you, Alyoshen'ka.

165
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,321
- Well, Tikhon, now you go. Tikhon... Tikhon.

166
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,860
- I have a fear of heights.

167
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,420
- Come on, hurry up!
- Wait a minute, Tikhon here is afraid of heights.

168
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,560
- When you pass it, don't look down!
- I can't not to look.

169
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,451
- Oh, I know, what to do. Cover your eyes.
- Oh yes, that's right.

170
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,925
- Go on, don't stop, go...

171
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,380
- Come on, Tikhon.
- You can do it!

172
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,793
- Silence, please, only one of us should be in charge.

173
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,870
- Come on, Tikhon, you can do it, go...

174
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,826
- A-a!!!

175
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,360
- No panic, Tikhon, they're going to save you!

176
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,490
- A-a-a-a!!!
- Oh my, Tikhon...

177
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,231
- Why are you looking at me? Will any of you go save him?

178
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,244
- Tikhon!!!
- Alyoshen'ka!!!

179
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,804
- Br-r-r!

180
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,117
- No need to save me... I'm fine.

181
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,999
- That's it. Why should it always be Julius to help!

182
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,880
- Let's go there. We have to find good men to ask the way.

183
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,156
- What if they are not good at all?

184
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,120
- No use guessing, just have to find out.
- Right... We need someone

185
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,748
to go on the scout.

186
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,840
- Why don't you go yourself?
- Alright, but it makes no sense!

187
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,090
- What sense?
- Oh, you ignorant folks, that's simple. Alyosha is a bogatyr

188
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,790
he's the main hero and can't perish, I'm his noble steed,
Lyubava is the hero's fiancee, they

189
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,020
get married and the stuff... Moses won't go because I like him,
so this leaves

190
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,864
either you or grandma.

191
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:24,938
- You fool... - Take that!
- Easy, why d'you get that mad? Ok, let Lyubava go...

192
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,738
- Oh... where's Alyosha?

193
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:38,475
- Come back, or else... I've said, come back!
- What a featherhead!

194
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,411
- Hey, come on, there's no one in here.

195
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,700
- Uncle, isn't it house of Svyatogor himself?

196
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,526
- That's right! It's his house. What a glorious bogatyr he was!

197
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,590
- I wonder if there's anything to eat?

198
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,710
What the...? Nothing at all.
- All you think about is food.

199
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,410
- Don't you tell me what to think about!
- Don't you teach me! Got it?

200
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,382
- Don't you get me with a "got it", got it?
- Calm down, you two... We'll have a rest and go further.

201
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,087
- Oh my God, what happened?! A?
- Are you okay, Alyoshen'ka?

202
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,740
- I read in a book once, that starvation cure only works
after a heavy supper.

203
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,930
And food shortage in a young organism leads to a quick death

204
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,081
of brain cells, in case they are present.

205
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,550
- Seems like no one is listening.
Well of course, I'm just a horse.

206
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,907
- Very well, what do you suggest?
- Oh my goodness, just look at those people!

207
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:33,540
You are a hero after all... Take a bow,
go to the forest, kill an animal. Moses!

208
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,460
- Ah?!!!
- Moses gathers firewood, you light a fire,

209
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,076
and Lyubava with granny cook something.

210
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,700
- I wonder, what will you do meanwhile?

211
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,630
- Yes, that's interesting!
- You people are funny, I'm the hero's horse.

212
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,293
What if we battle tomorrow, I have to be well-rested...

213
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,651
-Svyatogor!
-Who are you? What do you want?

214
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,920
-Please forgive us, noble hero, for our audacity.

215
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,936
We've stopped by your place accidentally, we are from Rostov town.

216
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,339
We're looking for Tugarin's army. They've offended us.

217
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:29,610
- Hmm, Tugarin again...
- Wow, look, why don't you do some fitness? Seriously!

218
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:36,530
- Well, I will help you all I can.
- Look out now, Tugarin! Now we'll show him, with two

219
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,230
bogatyrs!
- What two bogatyrs?

220
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,839
- Here is or hero from Rostov, Alyosha Popovich.
- He-e... A?

221
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:53,460
- Yes... Is he dumb or what?
- No, I... Me... Now we'll give hell to Tugarin

222
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,807
for taking away gold... from our... town...

223
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:18,300
- Yeah... he's got out of hand, that Tugarin the Snake. Unlike in the good old days... I used to

224
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,060
command a warband... or even a troop...

225
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,427
Was a good time we gave hell to tugars!...

226
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,730
And now, as you see, I've grown old and feeble...
- Old... and feeble...

227
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,080
- Wait a minute... Tugarin..., gold... I have seen them...

228
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,330
-Really? Where?

229
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:46,120
- Wait a minute, let me think... Ok, it was like this...
I was standing by the forest, and the tugars

230
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,862
were riding just nearby with the gold.

231
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,670
- Fell asleep.
- Really?

232
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:58,619
- Seriously, look at him. See? Yeah,
he's asleep... Hey, bogatyr!

233
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,070
- What? Where?...
- Every which where.

234
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,090
- Hold on, what happened next?
- What happened? Who are you?

235
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:09,620
- I'm Saint Lucas, and this is Moses the Prophet...
- Stop it, Julius! You were telling us about tugars,

236
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:17,290
remember? About gold.
- Oh yeah. I remember gold. Which year it was I don't know,

237
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:22,820
but we were marching back
and the Knyaz granted us golden ten-roubles... Oh...

238
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,482
I still have them!

239
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,989
-Here!

240
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:37,879
- A-a... It's not what we need... Heh, bad luck!

241
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,680
How do we find Tugarin?
- Tugarin? I'll help you, I've seen his army

242
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,900
recently near by the forest.
And I know the shortcut.

243
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,310
And to make it easier for you - here, take the steel-sword.

244
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:59,009
- Former strength has left my hands,
but it'll fit you just fine.

245
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,270
- O-o-o!
- Hm.

246
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:29,372
- Hee-haw, hee-haw!!
- Thank you, Svyatogor, for your gift.

247
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,721
- Thank you, Russian bogatyr.

248
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,470
Show us the way to Tugarin, please, do us a favor!

249
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:48,010
- Ok, God bless you. Go to this bright star up to the lonely mountain,
go round it and

250
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:52,458
up the hill, and you'll come right to the cave...

251
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:26,335
And the heroes followed the way that the noble bogatyr Svyatogor had showed them.

252
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,605
- There's the cave..

253
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,787
Maybe we should take each other hands?

254
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,684
- Hoo..

255
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,836
- Aaah!!!

256
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:38,868
- Oh..
- It's not too high.

257
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:45,147
- Ah.. Ah..
- Aaaah!!

258
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,620
- This way... Let's take each other hands..

259
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,703
- Maybe we shouldn't Alyoshenka?
- Why?

260
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,424
- Ah, I'm afraid of darkness!!

261
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,603
- Julius, get off me.

262
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,260
- A-ah!!!

263
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,640
- Wow, this must be the place Zmey Gorynych used to dwell in?!

264
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,873
- Move on you, lib... librarianist.
- A chill has crept...

265
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:36,440
- Right... Cemeterial..
- Oh... Look, I told you tugarians

266
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,651
were nearby... Here's their arrow.
- Wow, what an arrow! As big as a spear!

267
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,980
- Oops... I feel bad. I'll go back. You know what -
let's all go back.

268
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,687
- Hold on, Julius, hold on.

269
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,336
- Don't you feel the cave is narrowing down?
- That's right.

270
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,300
- Right, I just want to warn you - I have claustrophobia.

271
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,220
- What?
- It's a fear of closed areas.

272
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,270
- Stop it, Julius, there's no reason to panic.

273
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:13,651
- Panic? No one's going to panic. I said it just in case.

274
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,560
- Well, come on, move it.
- I can't move, I'm pressed down by a stone...

275
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,740
- Hey, looks like he's stuck.
- Wait a minute, d'you want to say,

276
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,680
that I can spend the rest of my days here,
in this dark damp cave?!

277
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,640
- Ok... now I will show you what a real panic is!!

278
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,120
- Don't, we'll try to get you out.

279
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,820
- Help!.. SOS... Somebody save the bogatyr steed!!! I don't want to die!

280
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,320
Moses, my friend, take care of my family...
- Calm down, Julius, you don't have any family.

281
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,303
- Oh my God!! I don't even have a family...
I'm too young to die..!

282
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,507
- A-a-a!!!

283
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,780
- You have to eat less, that's it.
- Oh God, that's so... so mean, to point out

284
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,460
one's weaknesses in a tough situation.

285
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,550
- Hush!! Do you hear that?

286
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,895
VOICES RUMBLE

287
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:39,510
- Tugarin, that's him, for sure. It's their language.
- Well, the hour has struck, now they'll feel

288
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,140
bogatyr might...
- Don't go there, Alyoshen'ka!

289
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,737
- Hey... A-a?

290
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,979
- Wait a minute, isn't it...

291
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,863
- No way!
- Yes, uncle, this is where he saw them.

292
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:29,841
- Right, when they were leaving with the gold.
- Don't be upset, Alyoshen'ka, maybe we can still catch up.

293
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,599
- Can't get it, what's the problem?
Are you back to the start?

294
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,869
- What the bad luck is this cave?!

295
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,416
- Here we are. No other Russian bogatyr will be laughed at because of it.

296
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:06,440
- Look, it's a flat stone with inscriptions.
- Is it? Well, read them out, Tikhon...

297
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:19,470
- Khm. Wh-o-e-v-e-r t-a-k-e-s t-h-e
r-i-g-h-t r-o-a-d...

298
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,980
- What?

299
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:31,550
- Wh-o-e-v-e-r t-a-k-e-s t-h-e r-i-g-h-t...

300
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,300
- Tikhon, take your time, concentrate,
we'll set a camp meanwhile,

301
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,690
by the morning you should be done reading.
- It's just my eyesight... has worsened...

302
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,670
- Oh yeah, right.
- Why don't you read it then?

303
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,010
- That's a piece of cake! Goes like this:
"Whoever goes left will be rich. Whoever goes

304
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,719
right will get married, whoever goes straight ahead
will find his death.

305
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,062
- Straight ahead! That's where we should go! Straight ahead!

306
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,860
- Well, let's go?...

307
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:14,078
- Where... did you take the flat stone, Alyoshen'ka?

308
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,602
- This is the place.

309
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,703
- Come, hurry up, we might lose them.

310
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,700
- What's wrong with you?

311
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,080
- Why are we hiding from our destiny, Alyoshen'ka?
Here it is, our happiness!

312
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,140
Look, it says - "get married".
- And what about Tugarin the Snake?

313
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,740
What about bogatyr glory?
- And what about me? I'm 16 already, and still unwed,

314
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,000
at this rate I'll be left on the shelf.

315
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,242
You're just afraid of serious relations.

316
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,168
-Who, me?!
-Yes, you!

317
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,560
- And what about gold?

318
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,420
- By the way, it says here

319
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,910
"will be rich". Why take risk then?
I heard that

320
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,230
Tugarin is a tough guy, what if I die on battlefield
or get crippled?

321
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,340
Of course, there's honour in taking risks, but
nothing will

322
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,020
add to my honourable looks more than expensive harness and golden shoes.

323
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:15,010
- No, Julius, you don't understand, it's not just about gold, it's about people's faith

324
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,530
in us, see? About gaining their respect.

325
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:23,130
- Ha-ha-ha, don't you make my horseshoes laugh.
One looks much finer with a thick purse,

326
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,070
and faith, respect, even love all come afterwards.

327
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,710
- Those are not the words of a bogatyr steed, but of a bazaar huckster.

328
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,420
- Wait a minute... Everybody has the right to be happy.
- What do you mean?

329
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:41,200
- I mean everybody gets what he wants.
- You are talking nonsense, Julius.

330
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,953
- And you don't respect other people's opinion!

331
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,241
(chumping)

332
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:58,840
- Well... I didn't think our ways would part, but looks like that. Come, Tikhon,

333
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,526
we'll cope with it ourselves.

334
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:14,880
- And don't you look for me, hear that? I'll marry another man,
and I'll have five - no - ten children!

335
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,490
And the household, and a thrifty husband! And he'll love me, and we'll

336
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:26,860
live happily ever after, and die on the same day! No, we'll never die at all! Come,

337
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:32,059
grandma, let's find a good fiance, unlike this one...

338
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,960
- Who ever heard of such a thing, that a
girl tells a man what to do?

339
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,760
- Just you look at her, talking me back!
- That's right.

340
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,630
- I'm afraid of serious relations... Ho-ho, I don't even
smile at my mirror reflection,

341
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,610
because I'm that serious.
- True!

342
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:00,850
- Big deal, I'm gonna find many other brides...!

343
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,530
- Why do you keep agreeing with me?
- I'm not agreeing.

344
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,440
- Go on then, speak up.
- One shouldn't be soft with a girl!

345
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,920
- It's improper to come athwart a man!
- That's right.

346
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,627
- You don't even smile at your reflection in the mirror.

347
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:19,001
- Don't you have your own opinion?
- Why? I do.

348
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,880
- I think, you're a bad match.
- True.

349
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,980
- And who cares, that she's the most beautiful girl in the whole Rostov?

350
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,190
- She is so dear and handy, so what?
- Yes...

351
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,040
- What of it, that you have a crush on her?
- Uhu...

352
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,890
- You'll marry another girl, and you'll be unhappy for the rest of your days. So what?

353
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,882
- You'll be fine, more or less.

354
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:53,086
- Uncle, I miss her so much, can't live without her!... I love her!!

355
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,830
- When I get rich, I'll marry and settle down. Enough of this
heroic stuff! Tired of it.

356
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,516
I'll buy a palace with big stables... Or two palaces?

357
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,600
So... where to next? Erm... could you tell me where the riches are?

358
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,535
- You wish to get rich, traveller?
- Who is there?

359
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:36,117
- Special offer, here and now, the biggest prize -
two halves of a kingdom, take the chance and feel lucky.

360
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,329
- Well... do you want to play?
- Yeah!

361
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:51,189
- Erm... for horseshoes!!
- Fine, let it be horseshoes!

362
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:58,363
Put a horseshoe here and guess a number from one to ten.
That's easy, I think of it, you guess it.

363
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:06,630
And your number is...
- Erm, three.

364
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:12,819
- That's right! And you win 10 points!
Will you try again?!

365
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:18,607
- Of course, that's simple!
- So... Make your bet.

366
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,690
- Hm... a horseshoe again? Ok, accepted. Your number is...
- Five.

367
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:30,260
- Right again!! Yes! 10 more points!
Oh, you lucky dog!

368
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:36,970
- Ha, lucky dog! I have the devil's own luck!
Let's play again.

369
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,872
- Ok, make your bet.
- All in!

370
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,220
- Accepted... And... Number?
- Two!

371
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,270
- I like this guy, he won again!

372
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:59,106
- Guys... it's a bad day for you!

373
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:07,310
- He thinks, I'm a softy?
- Must be so!
- I'm gonna find a hundred boys like this one...

374
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,200
- Easily!

375
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,987
-Even better!
-Exactly!

376
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,880
- I don't take orders from anyone...
- That's true.

377
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,530
- Granny..., why do you keep argeeing with me?
- As if I could object to you!

378
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,930
- Alyoshka is good-for-nothing...
- Right!

379
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,020
- Exactly, granny...
- You'll marry the next man and

380
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:35,185
you'll live with him.
- I will!

381
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:40,150
- And you'll cry all nights long,
thinking of your Alyoshka.

382
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,267
- No I won't!

383
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:50,111
Granny..., I need him, can't live without him!!
I love him!

384
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:06,870
- 40 points, 40 points!!
- It's time to play the final round!

385
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:12,270
And win two halves of a kingdom!!
- Yeah, it's time, come on, come on!

386
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:19,060
- Ok, the stake is 100 points.
- Yes, 100 points... Er... But I have only 40?!!

387
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,326
- Hm... Let me think...

388
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:31,290
- Ok, 40 points and your skin.
- My skin?

389
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,726
- Your two kingdom halves!

390
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:41,150
- Agreed!
- And your number...?

391
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:46,820
- So, we had five, we had three, and also seven and nine,
according to probability theory... eight...

392
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,323
yes, eight, for sure!!

393
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:59,007
- I'm sorry... but you've lost.
Hey, guys, skin him alive...

394
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:06,564
- Wait, I need a grace period... Can I have a loan...
I have connections...

395
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,889
The whole Novgorod is for me!

396
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,230
- Here... the path turns, we'll go right into their way.

397
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,740
- Hurry up, Tikhon, follow me...
- Uh...

398
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,180
- Lyubava?!!!
- Alyoshen'ka!!!

399
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,270
- I have to tell you...
- No, first I have to tell you...

400
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,023
- Don't argue with me...
- And you don't interrupt me...

401
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,920
- Guys, I'm so glad to see you. I can see it now, unity is our power, we must stick together

402
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,504
to reach our noble goal. Friendship is our real treasure!!

403
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:59,300
Fear and tremble you, tugar army, a bogatyr horse
is coming for you...

404
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,810
Well, let's not waste time, or someone else
takes the gold...

405
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:05,970
I mean..., someone else beats Tugarin.

406
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:10,669
Well, let's go, my friends, towards the great deeds...!

407
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:26,038
- Khe-hey!!!
- Khe-kh-hey!

408
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,491
- Hey-hey...

409
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,083
- Hey!...

410
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:18,119
- Peek-a-boo... peek-a-boo...

411
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,335
- Alyoshka is silly!

412
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,480
And our heroes went further along their thorny path,
and after a while, about nightfall

413
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:05,850
they finally found the tugar camp, and started thinking,
how to defeat Tugarin and

414
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,694
to take back the Rostov gold.

415
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,257
- Now is the time for the foes to feel my bogatyr might.

416
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,573
- Wait a bit, dear friend, how can you go without plan?
- That's right! You can't do without a plan!

417
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,460
- I'm surprised at you, have you ever heard of tactics, strategy?

418
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,770
Surveillance and patience are the key points here.

419
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:46,420
- There's nothing to look at and to spy out.
Clear enough as it is.

420
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,151
Surround them from the four sides and...

421
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:56,140
- Hop-pa!!
- Wait a minute, I think, everyone should have

422
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,210
a vote in a situation like this.
- What do you mean?

423
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:06,207
- Me and Moses... me and Moses think, that the best
battle is the one that never happened.

424
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,940
- Hop-pa. What?
- It's all being settled diplomatically nowadays. Maybe

425
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,432
we should talk to these guys, find a way with them,
appeal to their feelings?

426
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:19,880
- Alright, you go then.
- No, in this situation Moses and Tikhon

427
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,782
should go. Moses is less quick-tempered, than me,
and Tikhon is better lost than found.

428
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,390
- Just kidding... but seriously, look at the poor fellow!
Who would even think of hurting him?

429
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:33,780
- Enough of that. We'll sneak into the camp

430
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,307
at night and take the gold. Z-z-z...

431
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:43,559
- I like this, sounds very bogatyr-ish. And you
don't need me at night. Z-z-z...

432
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,754
- Ouch...! Phew!

433
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:31,018
- Yum-yum!
- Psst!

434
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,540
- Hee-haw, what a...
- Hush you, damn thing!

435
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:04,000
- Fine, guys, let me go...
I can control myself...

436
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,180
- Oh... what has he done, that pagan, to the gold?!!
- Anything wrong?

437
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,290
- How shall we give that to people?!
- What's the problem?

438
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:16,830
- As if you could treat someone else's stuff like this!
- Can I finally have an explanation, what's

439
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:20,900
going on here?
- Hm..., same gold as it used to be... Got remelted,

440
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,755
so what?

441
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:30,391
- And how do I find my tooth now?

442
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,544
- Why are being so noisy?!

443
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:08,657
- No, I can't do it like this... are we thieves or something?
We've come for our own stuff!!

444
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:16,650
Wake up you, mussulmen, take a straight fight,
and feel my bogatyr might...!

445
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:19,437
- What a fool...!!

446
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,379
- Ur...?!

447
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:41,290
- Alyoshen'ka...

448
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:44,839
- Have a spare place?
- No. -No. -No!!

449
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:43,523
- Not done yet.
- Done now.

450
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:52,120
- Ooh...!
- Phew, looks like we beat them back.

451
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,140
Help me!

452
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,010
- You'll find me by the old oak.

453
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:04,154
- You bring gold, I give the girl back.

454
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:12,080
- Ok, Tikhon, grandma, you take Moses
and take the gold back to Rostov, and me

455
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,108
and Julius will go save Lyubava.
- No, I'm going with you after Lyubava.

456
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,340
- Don't you see, grandma, you will pull us back,
and we can't lose time.

457
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:27,240
- Wait-wait-wait, you want to say, that we'll
trust the gold to these sly fellows?

458
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,550
- What fellows?
- I'm surprised at you, you are such

459
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:36,810
a bad judge of character. Just look at them closer...
They give me a cold shiver... They are

460
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:42,521
a clique, a criminal gang... The three of them are worse than Tugarin!! They'll take the gold and...

461
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:47,470
- I don't understand!
- C'mon, that's simple... If we take the money

462
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,474
and divide between the five... the four...

463
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:01,042
no... the three of us... Tikhon and grandma will be fine with one share only.

464
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,564
Seriously, they've less time to live!

465
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,740
- And what about people of Rostov?
- Ha-ha, don't make my... hm...

466
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:16,031
What people?! If I'm not mistaken, those people
wanted to impale you!... Ouch-ouch-ouch...

467
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:22,370
- Listen you, if you don't shut up at once,
I'll take you to the slaugtherhouse, and they'll

468
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:25,237
make sausages out of you there...

469
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,671
- A... That's why I like him.
Can't provoke him!

470
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:40,530
- Well, what are you waiting for? Come on, people in Rostov are tired of eating... I mean, waiting!

471
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:46,345
- We shouldn't leave you alone, Alyoshen'ka...
- That's what I say. We should go altogether.

472
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:53,061
- No, we won't risk people's gold this time.
We'll do as I say. Let's go...

473
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:58,640
- Ah, still it was wrong to let them
go...

474
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,498
- Yeah, they're unlikely to cope on their own.
- What shall we do then?

475
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:09,010
- Here's what I think - we'll leave the gold with the Kiev knyaz (king) for safekeeping,
Kiev is close at hand,

476
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:12,161
and return to help Alyosha.

477
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:20,245
- You know, I wanted to ask you something...
About what you said...

478
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:24,710
- What I said?
- You know, about slaughterhouse... You really

479
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,814
could've taken me to slaughterers?

480
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:34,120
- Well, this is...
- Wait a sec, I just want to hear that -

481
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:38,590
yes or no?
- Well... No.

482
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:44,222
- Phew..., you nearly made me believe that,
and that look of yours, t'was so... convincing.

483
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:50,331
- Oh..., oh, listen, could you walk for a while,
I have that pain in my back...

484
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:58,630
- Yeah..., it's a hard job we have to do...
- Not many men would stand.

485
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:03,454
- But that's fine,  on the other hand people of Rostov wil be glad.

486
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,315
- Here we are at last.

487
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,143
- Cut their heads off!

488
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:05,070
- I wonder how Tikhon and Moses are doing,
did they get there or not?

489
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:09,400
- Oh, I'm worrying about it too. Gave them charge over the gold,
and it's people's gold, you know. Well, I'm pretty sure about Moses,

490
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,233
he's a good guy, but Tikhon...

491
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,792
- Remember this once and for all, Julius, I trust Tikhon implicilty.

492
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,934
- And to me he's like a blood brother!

493
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:26,361
It's just that they are so weak and unprotected...

494
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:31,700
- Do not put us to death, knyaz, but let us speak to you.

495
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,737
- Very well, speak out then.

496
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:41,090
- We've come to you on behalf of Rostov people,
great Kiev knyaz.

497
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,820
- And what is it that you want?

498
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:51,970
And Tikhon narrated a story to Kiev knyaz about bogatyrs that
Rus' is still abundant in. And the thing is,

499
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:58,050
that Tikhon has to finish what he started, punish mean
Tugarin and rescue Alyoshka and Lyubava

500
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:05,081
And there’s no one to look after the gold meanwhile,
that favor being what Tikhon is humbly asking for.

501
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,927
- Yeah.., interesting story..

502
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:17,403
- Just look at this thing.

503
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:38,886
- Hm..., yes..., a globe, interesting, I would say,
original.

504
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:41,004
So what did you say was your name?

505
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:52,697
- Could we just..., have a troop of guards, and leave
the gold for safekeeping with you.

506
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:58,038
- I can't give you soldiers, it's bad timing, you see,
each one of them is on account.

507
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:06,220
As for the gold, leave it here, I'll keep it safe as it is.
Who else could one trust if not the Kiev knyaz?!

508
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:09,496
Such a thing needs to be safeguarded at all times.

509
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:15,779
- Well, thank you just the same, knyaz.
- Go in peace.

510
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,351
- How come they have that much gold in Rostov, I wonder?

511
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,370
- Where the mischief is this oak?
- Sorry, can't see it from here, and by the way,

512
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:46,181
are you sure this is a good plan at all?
- No, but it's the only one I have.

513
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:51,770
- So... Tugarin returns Lyubava, and you give him
a sack of gold..., wait, but there's

514
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:55,620
no gold in the sack, there's me in the sack!
And you'll give me to Tugarin?

515
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,860
Wait, stop, let me out!
- It's gonna be ok.

516
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,310
- No, let me out right now, or I'll fall into hysterics!!!

517
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:05,222
- I said I won't leave you alone!

518
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:46,621
- Where is my gold?

519
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:51,408
- The gold? I know where it is, but I'd like to know my share first.

520
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:01,140
- Got him!!
- I know. One shouldn't keep all gold to himself!

521
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,608
- Yeah, and he's talking about gold.

522
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:11,437
- What about... fourty to sixty, what d'you say?

523
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,830
- Ok, fine... fifty-fifty!

524
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:19,333
- Hey, it's our horse!

525
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:50,430
- Lyubava...!
- Alyoshen'ka!!

526
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:56,255
- Alyosha!!

527
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,800
- Sorry, Lyubava, I have to help Julius.

528
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,120
- And who are you? Ha?

529
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,170
- Doesn't matter, this is our horse!

530
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:25,210
- I am Tugarin the Snake..., heard of me?

531
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:29,306
- Well, yes, but still it's our horse, it owes us money.

532
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:40,798
- What?! This is my horse!!! He knows, where my gold is hidden!

533
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:45,138
- Hey, men, it is my horse!

534
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:50,870
- And who are you?
- I am the Rostov bogatyr, Alyosha Popovich,

535
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:53,800
and I've come to keep my promise.

536
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,600
- O-oh! Bogatyr!

537
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,065
- Where is my gold?
- It is not yours!

538
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:16,315
- Right, it's our gold!
- Alyosha...

539
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:09,058
- Alyoshen'ka!
- Not done yet.

540
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:14,095
- A-ah?
- Huh!

541
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:28,703
- Done now.

542
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:43,589
- Alyoshen'ka!
A-a... Argh... O-oh...

543
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:51,417
- Did I do it to him?
- Yes, you did, Alyoshen'ka!

544
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:58,140
- Don't remember a thing...
- No wonder...

545
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:04,350
- Tikhon... gra-gra..., grandma, and what are you
doing... here?

546
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:07,870
- Don't worry, Alyoshen'ka, we did all as you said.

547
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:12,320
We left the gold with the Kiev knyaz for safekeeping,
and decided to help you.

548
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:16,336
- Were right in time.
- Huh...

549
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,440
- We have to tie him while he's unconscious.

550
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,059
- Conscious...? Ha! It will take him a while!

551
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,452
- Pardon me...!

552
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:34,672
- Well... are you ok?
- A-ah?

553
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:43,690
- And now we'll get our gold back and head to Rostov.

554
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:49,469
- And leave Tugarin in Kiev for people to gape at.
- Uh-huh!

555
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:21,100
- Ouch.
- Hee-haw... hee-haw...

556
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,671
- Live long, Kiev knyaz!

557
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:31,320
- Ah... Ah... Huh... Greetings to you,
Rostov bogatyr!

558
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:37,250
Come in, sit down... be my guest!...
A welcome guest!

559
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:41,300
- Please forgive my incivility, lightbringing knyaz,
but I have no time to feast,

560
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:47,011
people of Rostov are waiting for me, and for
their belongings, which were taken away by mean Tugarin.

561
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,733
- A-a...

562
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:54,190
- Well, do as you like...

563
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:55,900
- Go in peace.

564
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,336
- So what did you say happened next?

565
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:06,380
- Do not get angry at me, great knyaz, but you seem to have forgotten about Rostov gold, that was left with you

566
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,599
for safekeeping?

567
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:16,680
- Ha? O-oh!! Yes, I recall...

568
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:20,161
- Hey, you..., bring the bogatyr's gold...

569
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:31,482
-À-à-à!!

570
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:48,840
- You shouldn't make fun of ordinary people, knyaz...!
- Did I offend you indeed?

571
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,502
Just took a storage commission.

572
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:57,460
Well, princeling, for me that's enough being your amusement ..

573
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:02,932
Now it's my turn to have fun, here, try my bogatyr might.

574
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:08,535
-Ha! Hold on, hero, don't get too excited..

575
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:13,432
I see how quick-tempered you are..., by the way I need this kind of men!

576
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:19,288
Stay here, Alyosha, on full allowance and with my highest blessing!

577
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:23,760
- Do not get angry, Kiev knyaz, but there are people waiting for us at home, in Rostov,

578
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,048
and there is no way back for us without the gold.

579
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,740
And so it was settled. As for the gold, knyaz returned it,

580
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:38,730
and Alyosha gave Tugarin to Prince of Kiev as a present, whom prince

581
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:45,101
put into a cage, to entertain people of Kiev, as people always liked to.

582
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,791
- You know, I wonder if we deserve a share of gold for our deeds?

583
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,450
Or some noble rank?

584
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:14,003
-Well, live long, father-Rostov!
Finally, we took back good people's gold!

585
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:50,691
- A-ah!! The Lord has heard us!

586
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:07,549
- Oh, look?! That good-for-nothing is back!!

587
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,200
-Yeah, you got the respect!

588
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,370
- Oh, look here, it's my ring!
- Not your, it's ours!

589
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:18,200
-You did not have any gold ever!

590
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,182
- Let the priest in, let me in!
- We did well, didn't we!

591
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:27,040
Well, I helped you out, now your turn to help..

592
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,407
There's a tree, that owes me four horseshoes.

593
01:12:30,417 --> 01:12:35,417
