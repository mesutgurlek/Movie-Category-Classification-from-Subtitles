1
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:36,469
- Boy, I'm sure glad this show is closing.
- Me, too.

2
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:38,737
You have another gig lined up after this?

3
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:42,975
No, but I know I don't want
to do another chorus line.

4
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:04,701
Well, Kelly, now that you've left
your life in the theater...

5
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:08,106
maybe you'd reconsider
my offer of four years at Princeton.

6
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:11,007
I haven't quit, Dad. I'm just taking a break.

7
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:13,807
I've told you a million times,
dance is my life.

8
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,574
I don't understand.

9
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:19,880
With your intelligence
and the opportunities that I could provide...

10
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:22,284
What about your young friend, that lawyer?

11
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:23,879
What's his name? Derek?

12
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:26,720
He wanted to marry you.
Why did you break up with him?

13
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:30,319
Derek is a nerd.
And you're the one that liked him, not me.

14
00:03:30,396 --> 00:03:34,093
At least she's not spending time
with those street people anymore, darling.

15
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,693
Look, I come home to relax with you guys,
not argue.

16
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,829
But we are relaxing, dear.

17
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:42,203
I'm not arguing with you, Kelly.

18
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:43,901
I'm telling you.

19
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:46,144
I don't like the life you're leading.

20
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:48,040
It's my life, Dad.

21
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:35,088
We don't clean up
for any of the other girls like this.

22
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:38,187
This place is a mess.
It needs cleaning anyway.

23
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,093
You just now realized that?

24
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,192
The mere sound of Kelly's voice
on the phone drives the funk...

25
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:45,362
from your dingy socks away.

26
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,972
You should have more respect
for our dance partner.

27
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:50,704
Hey, look who's here!

28
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,170
Kelly!

29
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:55,036
Hey, Kelly!

30
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:58,116
Turbo! Ozone!

31
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:02,049
- Hey, Turbo, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

32
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,448
- Look at that rod.
- Hi.

33
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:07,788
I really missed you.

34
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:10,390
That's a sharp car.

35
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:16,357
Looks like show business
is treating you good.

36
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,903
Actually, I'm pretty burned out.

37
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:22,237
Yeah, I've been hustling for pennies.

38
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:25,141
Doesn't it seem like dancing
is just the same old tune?

39
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,841
Yeah, I know.
All those auditions and cattle calls.

40
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:31,880
"We'll call you next week."

41
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,112
Hey, look who's here! It's Kelly!

42
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:37,348
Special K!

43
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:40,153
Hey, Special K, look what Ozone taught us!

44
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:43,588
All right! Kelly's back!

45
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,860
So you're teaching class?

46
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,731
Yeah, I'm teaching class now.

47
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,794
<i>Hey, Kelly K, won't you come this way?</i>

48
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:55,432
<i>We're gonna take you to the place</i>
<i>where we all stayed</i>

49
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:57,942
<i>We're gonna take you to the place</i>
<i>where we all go</i>

50
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,103
<i>And we call this place the Miracle</i>

51
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:05,048
<i>Where my mellow Ozone and Turbo teach</i>
<i>They're a combination that can't be beat</i>!

52
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:07,244
<i>So come on, everybody</i>
<i>Everybody, come along</i>

53
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,810
<i>We can teach you all, too</i>
<i>because we know what to do</i>

54
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,050
<i>We're gonna take a walk on the avenue</i>

55
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:18,657
<i>Electric Boogaloo</i>

56
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,738
<i>Girl, I was runnin' low</i>

57
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,474
<i>My heart was over-drained</i>

58
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:37,812
<i>I've seen the world before you used me</i>

59
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:39,544
<i>She was really cold</i>

60
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,112
<i>Left without a word</i>

61
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:46,317
<i>Didn't even care how she abused me</i>

62
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:48,186
<i>I like the flashing lights</i>

63
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,922
<i>going through the night, baby</i>

64
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:55,122
<i>You revived my love-drained heart</i>

65
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,895
<i>Electrifying touch</i>

66
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:59,699
<i>I love the way you say it</i>

67
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:04,002
<i>Girl, you sparked a brand-new star</i>

68
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:06,101
<i>I want to hold you</i>

69
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:12,947
<i>It feels so right to connect into your love</i>

70
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:14,813
<i>You turn me on, baby</i>

71
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,479
<i>Electric Boogaloo</i>

72
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:21,117
<i>I like the way you turn me on</i>
<i>with just a single kiss</i>

73
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:23,184
<i>You turn me on, baby</i>

74
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:25,127
<i>Electric Boogaloo</i>

75
00:07:25,197 --> 00:07:30,032
<i>You stimulate in such a way</i>
<i>that you can hardly miss</i>

76
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,162
<i>Your force is strong, grows more every day</i>

77
00:07:34,506 --> 00:07:38,943
<i>Love the way your love is going through me</i>

78
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:42,811
<i>It's the way you talk</i>
<i>You're eating out my mind</i>

79
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:47,016
<i>Girl, the way you walk, it just enthuses me</i>

80
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:49,180
<i>Girl, you're such a joy</i>

81
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:52,155
<i>going through my heart, baby</i>

82
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:55,716
<i>Girl you sparked a brand-new star</i>

83
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:58,388
<i>You're never darkness</i>

84
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:06,126
<i>Feels so right to connect into your love</i>

85
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,693
Hey, man, come on.

86
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:13,194
Forget her, she's just a tease. Come on.

87
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:15,635
Turbo's in love.

88
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,172
Let's jam!

89
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:21,503
<i>I'd like to hold you</i>

90
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:28,751
<i>It feels so right to connect into your love</i>

91
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:32,252
<i>Electric Boogaloo</i>

92
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:40,225
Miracles?

93
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,624
Yeah, it's our Community Center.

94
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:44,726
Turbo and I help out here sometimes.

95
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:46,794
Really, and this is where you teach?

96
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:51,443
Magician, show us around.

97
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:05,479
Are these guys professionals?
They're really good.

98
00:10:05,557 --> 00:10:06,751
No, they're kids.

99
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:09,020
They're from the neighborhood. The ghetto.

100
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:30,280
I'm telling you, this place is fresh.

101
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:31,839
This is great!

102
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:36,349
This place is great for the kids, Kelly. Look.

103
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:38,713
Man, you have mirrors. This is great.

104
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,988
- Wait till you meet Byron.
- Where is he?

105
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,051
What's happening, champ?

106
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:46,293
- How are you?
- All right.

107
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:47,889
Good to see you.

108
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,560
Hey, hot stuff! What's going on?

109
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:52,366
How they doing anyway?

110
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:54,928
They're doing all right. Not deadly...

111
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:56,907
but they're determined.

112
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:58,908
What's this?

113
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:02,636
Who's the new talent?

114
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:04,875
This is Kelly. She's our dance partner.

115
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,544
Kelly, this is Byron,
the dude that runs this place.

116
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:09,177
- Good to meet you.
- Hey.

117
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:12,815
It's a pleasure. You must be the one
who danced with these two turkeys.

118
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:16,520
Yeah. It looks like you're doing a great job
with these kids here.

119
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:19,792
We try. If you have any spare time,
drop around.

120
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:21,730
We can always use help around here.

121
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:25,600
All right. I'll talk to you later.
Got to get back to work now.

122
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,933
- Come on, I want you to meet my kids.
- Okay.

123
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:31,603
These kids got a lot of talent.

124
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:33,267
Michael! Get off!

125
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:38,882
Look at those girls. They get off!

126
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:43,917
Come on, you guys,
I want you to meet Kelly.

127
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:45,388
How're you doing?

128
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:49,223
Michael, why don't you get out here
and show us what you got?

129
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:53,228
That's fresh! Try it like this.

130
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,343
Hey, come on. Let's turn the music up!

131
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:55,551
Got to get somebody down here
with a couple of flatbeds.

132
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:56,950
I don't know.

133
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:59,622
How long will it be before
we can start this project?

134
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:02,360
Not long. It'll come down soon.

135
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:05,396
Should pass through channels
in about three weeks.

136
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,030
Randall, I want this building.

137
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:09,764
This is the perfect site.

138
00:13:12,878 --> 00:13:15,244
So how did you wind up here, anyway?

139
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:17,782
When Byron found it, it was a dump, Kelly.

140
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:20,340
- Yeah?
- We all got together and fixed it up.

141
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:23,654
It looks fantastic. You guys did a great job.

142
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:26,524
Yeah, well.

143
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:29,459
The kids really mean a lot to you?

144
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:32,155
It's like a second home to all of us.

145
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,596
This place is great. I love being here.

146
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:40,494
- You're between jobs, aren't you?
- Yeah.

147
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:42,164
You could teach.

148
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,571
You think it'd be okay?

149
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:46,270
You heard what Byron said, didn't you?

150
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:49,780
"We need all the help we can get."

151
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:54,308
I tell you, I would love working here.

152
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:55,683
Well, all right!

153
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:58,117
I want to build that shopping center.

154
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,489
I want to build it on the site
that we talked about.

155
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,455
The property values in that area
are just going to take off.

156
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,760
And that building that the kids are in...

157
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,630
that has got to go.

158
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,002
I'm working on it, but you know...

159
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,506
Commissioner Snyder is soft on these
so-called "community projects."

160
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:18,008
Randall, I want...

161
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:20,067
Zoning's cooperation.

162
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,168
<i>I'm counting on you to get it for me.</i>

163
00:16:31,243 --> 00:16:34,076
Wait a minute, isn't this a city building?

164
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,840
Yes, the city loaned it
to some kind of local group...

165
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:38,815
for a community center.

166
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:41,542
They call it something...

167
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:43,449
"Miracles," that's it.

168
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:46,656
Miracles. What an inspiring name.

169
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,324
What do they do here?

170
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:51,054
It's just designed to keep kids off the street.

171
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:54,189
They have classes in art and dancing,
that kind of thing.

172
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,756
These ventures come and go.

173
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:59,201
The key thing though is that
our current engineering reports show...

174
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:02,172
that that building is structurally unsound.

175
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:04,742
It would be more cost effective
at this point to...

176
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,573
tear the building down,
and offer the property for sale.

177
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:12,310
And I don't think it would be bad
if we took this area...

178
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:15,113
and put in a shopping center here.

179
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:19,289
- But where will all those kids go?
- They've got their club, Radiotron.

180
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:21,882
- Well, Mr. Randall, you might be right.
- Good.

181
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:39,803
<i>They come to jam from every side of town</i>

182
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:42,073
<i>Funk, rave, electro-freaks</i>

183
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:43,637
<i>Just shopping around</i>

184
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:48,277
<i>Music divine, really made for going down</i>

185
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:52,153
<i>There's no excuse</i>
<i>You've got to move your body</i>

186
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:56,058
<i>This is your night to shine</i>

187
00:17:57,162 --> 00:18:00,154
<i>No need for hesitation</i>

188
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:04,931
<i>So bring your heart to the dance floor</i>

189
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:09,139
<i>You've got to Radiotron</i>

190
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:10,931
<i>That's where it's at</i>

191
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:13,035
<i>The Radiotron</i>

192
00:18:13,612 --> 00:18:16,945
<i>Keep on dancing, the Radiotron</i>

193
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:18,844
<i>That's where it's at</i>

194
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:21,252
<i>The Radiotron</i>

195
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,287
<i>Keep on dancing</i>

196
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:27,152
<i>You feel the DJ scratching out your soul</i>

197
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,195
Look who's here, girls.

198
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:37,230
<i>And what you wear</i>

199
00:18:37,302 --> 00:18:40,635
<i>nobody really cares</i>

200
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:43,868
<i>This is your night to shine</i>

201
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:47,042
<i>No need for hesitation</i>

202
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:50,571
<i>So bring your heart</i>

203
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:53,550
<i>to the dance floor</i>

204
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:56,519
<i>Come on down to the Radiotron</i>

205
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:58,453
<i>That's where it's at</i>

206
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,381
<i>The Radiotron</i>

207
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,825
Electros rule the dance floor now, sucker!

208
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:09,797
Why don't you get back to your social club
and go play with the babies?

209
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:13,866
Come on, you guys,
let's turn these fools out!

210
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,175
Did you bring your mama along
to wipe your nose?

211
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:19,471
Be cool!

212
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:23,612
Look it, we're not gonna waste
any of our moves.

213
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:26,649
And we're sure not gonna dance
for you punks!

214
00:19:29,054 --> 00:19:31,215
<i>Come, get on up</i>

215
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:35,726
<i>And dance</i>

216
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:39,121
<i>Just get on up</i>

217
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,924
<i>And dance</i>

218
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:48,305
Ozone, look at this jive letter
they sent me this morning from City Hall.

219
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:52,843
What's this baloney?

220
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:55,675
It says our building is
going to be condemned...

221
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:58,910
unless somebody comes up
with $200,000 to fix it.

222
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:03,654
And I don't think the city is gonna
come up with that kind of bread.

223
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:06,855
- Let's raise the money.
- $200,000?

224
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:09,853
It's a whole lot of nickels and dimes.

225
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:13,159
We gotta try, champ.

226
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,592
Ms. Snyder, we received this letter
saying that you people...

227
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,695
plan to tear our building down.

228
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:24,367
Yes, Mr. Smith. I know about that letter.

229
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,677
What can we do to save Miracles?

230
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:30,443
Listen, kids, I really am on your side.

231
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:34,444
But the best that I'm able to do
is get you a 30-day grace period...

232
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,352
so that you can raise some money
to renovate that building.

233
00:20:37,422 --> 00:20:40,255
We appreciate your 30-day grace period...

234
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:44,351
but do you really think that's long enough
to raise that kind of money?

235
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,663
I don't know.

236
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,494
But I do know this is your only chance.

237
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:51,960
At least we have a chance.

238
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:57,772
<i>You may think we're funny</i>
<i>But we got to have the money</i>

239
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:07,674
<i>Got to have the money</i>
<i>if you want to get the honey</i>

240
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:12,788
<i>Got to have the jam to pay Uncle Sam</i>

241
00:21:15,894 --> 00:21:18,658
<i>Talking about in the ditch and you're all that</i>

242
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,665
<i>You can't have nothin' if you're busted flat</i>

243
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:24,493
<i>Get it now while the getting's good</i>

244
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:28,061
<i>Enjoy your life, like you know you should</i>

245
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:31,670
- Thank you.
- Here, look!

246
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:35,179
<i>Oh, they say money won't buy happiness</i>

247
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:37,679
<i>But I'd like a chance to see</i>

248
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:41,210
<i>'Cause I can buy what I want</i>
<i>and go where I please</i>

249
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:43,781
<i>And that's good enough for me</i>

250
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:46,454
<i>Money</i>!

251
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,477
<i>Got to have the money</i>
<i>if you want to get the honey</i>

252
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:20,217
Here's $100.

253
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:25,054
$7,000.

254
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:31,992
Not looking too good, is it?

255
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,396
Come on, you guys, it's a start.

256
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:37,532
But we don't have too much time
before the end.

257
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:42,303
$7,000 is not going to impress
the Zoning Committee at all.

258
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,348
Why don't we just put on a show?

259
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:47,111
Like those big ones
with the dancing and juggling.

260
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:48,914
We could have it in the streets.

261
00:22:48,987 --> 00:22:50,420
Like a street festival.

262
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:51,853
I'll dance!

263
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:54,522
I could choreograph.

264
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:55,786
I'll run rehearsals.

265
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,157
And of course...

266
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:01,494
I could be the star.

267
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:06,993
So they called you about me?

268
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:10,001
Yes, they're considering you for the lead.

269
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:12,169
It opens in Paris.

270
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:14,444
In Paris? You're kidding.

271
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:16,673
Stanley! That's great!

272
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:19,349
Relax. You still have to audition.

273
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:21,416
I'll call you when they set a date...

274
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:22,851
if I can find you.

275
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:24,912
You've been hard to reach lately.

276
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:27,219
I've been teaching
at this Community Center.

277
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:30,227
It's very noble,
but don't let it interfere with your career.

278
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:32,729
I have had a lot of time on my hands lately.

279
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:35,129
Don't worry, that'll all change.

280
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,197
Okay, I'm going to hold you to that.

281
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:48,041
Nice to be working with you again, Ozone.

282
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:49,545
Yeah, it is.

283
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:55,847
- Here, help me carry this.
- Sure.

284
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:58,921
Okay. Back it up.

285
00:23:59,157 --> 00:24:02,456
- Hi! Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Kelly.

286
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,167
Guess what? Stanley got me an audition.

287
00:24:12,236 --> 00:24:14,796
I might be the lead in a show
that's going to Paris.

288
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:16,965
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

289
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:20,801
But what about this show?

290
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:25,106
You guys got a lot done.

291
00:24:25,183 --> 00:24:27,515
You gonna stick with us or what?

292
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:30,414
Electro Rock!

293
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,020
Hey, let's take these suckers!

294
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:36,858
Later, sucker.

295
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:38,460
I'll get that guy!

296
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:14,958
Ozone.

297
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,833
You been off the street too long, blood.

298
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:20,832
You got lazy. You lost your edge.

299
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:22,805
You're the loser, punk.

300
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:27,767
Try me.

301
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:33,577
<i>Combat</i>!

302
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:38,412
<i>Attention, you have just entered</i>
<i>a battle zone</i>

303
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:44,052
<i>It's time for us to find out</i>
<i>who's really the best with the freshest crew</i>

304
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:47,859
<i>No time for work, we're through with that</i>
<i>All that's left is real combat</i>

305
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,830
<i>Combat</i>! <i>Combat</i>!

306
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,173
<i>Now we're all here, both of the crews</i>
<i>Someone will win, someone will lose</i>

307
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,742
<i>But we must battle to decide</i>
<i>who keeps his honor and pride</i>

308
00:26:09,821 --> 00:26:13,587
<i>We've got the moves, you've got the beat</i>
<i>We got the power that you need</i>

309
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:17,492
<i>Experience, we'll give you that</i>
<i>but let's test this combat</i>

310
00:26:18,663 --> 00:26:21,325
<i>Combat</i>! <i>Combat</i>!

311
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:35,768
<i>Now this is it, no time to choke</i>
<i>This is a battle, not a joke</i>

312
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:39,647
<i>To win, you must be hard, not soft</i>
<i>When you get on the floor, you got to go off</i>

313
00:26:39,717 --> 00:26:43,346
<i>Use every move you've learned in life</i>
<i>Dance is your weapon, not a knife</i>

314
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:47,255
<i>Pull all the tricks out of your hat</i>
<i>This is no game, this is combat</i>!

315
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,025
<i>Combat</i>! <i>Combat</i>!

316
00:26:57,735 --> 00:27:01,831
<i>Now I seen battles in my time</i>
<i>that move so fast they make you blind</i>

317
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:05,569
<i>And with the talent they possess,</i>
<i>it made it hard to pick the best</i>

318
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:09,306
<i>So we will take them from this scene</i>
<i>to find whichever was the cream</i>

319
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:13,247
<i>The only way this could be done</i>
<i>was separate, go one on one</i>

320
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:24,455
<i>Combat</i>! <i>Combat</i>!

321
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:40,841
<i>So when you battle, show no shame</i>
<i>Make other crews respect your name</i>

322
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:44,507
<i>Be fresh and hard, give them no break</i>
<i>and make them pay for their mistakes</i>

323
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:48,313
<i>Give them no slack, always attack</i>
<i>and never hit while steppin' back</i>

324
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:52,152
<i>Be merciless, so when you're done</i>
<i>there'll be no question of who won</i>

325
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,589
<i>Combat</i>! <i>Combat</i>!

326
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:10,869
<i>TKO</i>!

327
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,883
Hey, kid, get out of the way, all right?

328
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:30,325
What are you doing?
What kind of camera is that?

329
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:34,023
Look, you'll have to get out of here, sonny,
we've got some work to do.

330
00:28:34,098 --> 00:28:36,589
Doing a movie? Can I be in it?

331
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:38,635
No, we're surveying the land.

332
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:42,070
Mr. Douglas here
is going to build a nice new supermarket.

333
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:45,100
- You mean here? At Miracles?
- That's right.

334
00:28:45,176 --> 00:28:47,474
You get back to work, and you, kid...

335
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:49,308
you get out of here.

336
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:54,642
Look, let's pack up.
We've got enough for now to go on.

337
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,947
Over there!

338
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,421
Hey, hold on, buddy, what's going on here?

339
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:07,019
What are you fellows doing here
with that equipment?

340
00:29:07,198 --> 00:29:11,931
Well, we're making a preliminary survey
of potential construction sites.

341
00:29:12,003 --> 00:29:13,868
The name is Douglas.

342
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:18,368
Whoever you are, you got no business
coming around here with that equipment.

343
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:22,173
We haven't had a hearing yet.
And you don't own this property yet.

344
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,943
I'm very aware of the fact
that the city owns it.

345
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:28,278
Are you, perhaps, a city official?

346
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:30,684
No, we're the legal tenants here.

347
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:33,724
That's a situation I don't think
will last very long.

348
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,622
Yeah, well, look here, hot shot...

349
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:39,184
you can forget your plans, man,
'cause we're going to stop you.

350
00:29:39,263 --> 00:29:41,288
We're going to stop you cold.

351
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:45,859
I doubt if an arrogant bunch of street kids
have the power to...

352
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:51,040
You don't how much power we really have,
do you?

353
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:55,337
We'll go to the press,
and we'll fight this thing all the way.

354
00:29:55,513 --> 00:29:57,538
Well, it's your time.

355
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,750
Waste it if you want to.

356
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:06,219
Is that man going to take away Miracles?

357
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,119
No, we're not gonna let him.

358
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,274
Yo, Turbo. Hey, man, you know,
we should work on some new moves, man.

359
00:30:31,782 --> 00:30:33,647
Somethin' fresher than fresh, man.

360
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:36,515
Somethin' funkier than funky.
You know what I mean?

361
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,020
Yeah, man, let's put on...

362
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:41,923
- Let's put on some OIlie and Jerry.
- Yeah, that'd be cool.

363
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:45,428
Hi, Ozone.

364
00:30:47,331 --> 00:30:49,322
Ozone, I'd like to talk to you.

365
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,731
What do you want to talk about?

366
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:57,768
- Hi.
- Bye.

367
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:06,206
Are you going with that Kelly now?

368
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,410
Oh, girl, what difference does that make?

369
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:10,750
- It makes a difference to me.
- It shouldn't.

370
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:13,688
Look, that thing between us, baby,
was over a long time ago.

371
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:15,692
Well, I still love you, Ozone.

372
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:18,353
- Look, Rhonda, I'm sorry.
- Forget it!

373
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:20,863
I don't need your sympathy, Ozone!

374
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:22,729
What do you want?

375
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,601
You know what I want?
I want you to stay away from that girl!

376
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:32,867
Girls are whacked.

377
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,365
Come on.

378
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:49,513
Hey, man, what did she say?

379
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:51,919
She thinks you're sexy.
She wants to dance with you.

380
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:53,786
Go on, man, I think she likes you.

381
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:16,344
Yo, Ozone, you think I look like a stud?

382
00:33:24,822 --> 00:33:26,153
Did you say something?

383
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:28,955
You think I got sex appeal, dude?

384
00:33:29,026 --> 00:33:30,391
Gimme a break.

385
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:32,889
You're acting weird.

386
00:33:33,864 --> 00:33:37,163
Dude, I need some advice.

387
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:38,394
What advice?

388
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:42,199
I wanna know
how to start off with a girl, dude.

389
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:49,009
Yeah? You mean, you're askin' me
how to get it on with a girl?

390
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,107
Well, something like that.

391
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:52,649
All right.

392
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:56,748
If that's the case...

393
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:02,619
I'll show you a few tricks of the old master.

394
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:04,354
There's two phases to this.

395
00:34:04,428 --> 00:34:07,522
There's phase number one.
You got to get the girl interested.

396
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:11,432
Then there's phase number two,
the old tactical maneuver.

397
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:14,530
First, you've got to get the girl
to come to you.

398
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:18,371
After that, you've got to play it cool.
You walk by like this.

399
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:20,375
Real close.

400
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:24,073
Then you look at her.
Only, she doesn't know you're looking.

401
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:25,772
Now you try it.

402
00:34:31,722 --> 00:34:32,711
Go ahead.

403
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:36,593
Okay, suppose she knows I'm there.
What do I do next?

404
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,318
- Tell her I love her?
- No, if you tell her that...

405
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,023
She doesn't even know you yet.

406
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:42,865
- Can I kiss her?
- No.

407
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,366
Do that, and she'll punch your lights out.

408
00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:46,767
Then what do I do?

409
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:51,468
You do like I do.
You just stand there and you smile.

410
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,636
Smile? Like this?

411
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:56,937
No, matter of fact, don't smile at all.

412
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:58,675
Well then, can I kiss her now?

413
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:00,678
No, you whisper in her ear.

414
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:02,111
Whisper what?

415
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:05,786
You know, softly, like,
"Hey, baby, you look fine.

416
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:10,086
"I like you. Hey, check this out."
Butter up to her. Try it.

417
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,593
Here, try it.

418
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:16,192
Go ahead.

419
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:20,634
You have the nicest...

420
00:35:21,905 --> 00:35:22,997
teeth.

421
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,300
No, man, she's not a horse.
Tell her about her eyes.

422
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,213
Your eyes are so...

423
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:39,149
- brown.
- No.

424
00:35:39,823 --> 00:35:43,953
Move over. Let's start from scratch.
Let me show you how you do it.

425
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:50,132
Here we go.

426
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:07,669
Everybody. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

427
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:09,797
Every one of you did a fine job.

428
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:13,308
I'll contact your agents about the part
next week. Thank you very much.

429
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:18,339
Now I know this director.
Your chances with him are excellent.

430
00:38:18,415 --> 00:38:20,883
Man, I wish I could know right now.

431
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:23,715
I don't know what
I'm going to tell Ozone, though.

432
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:27,883
All you used to talk about was your work,
now all I hear is Ozone, Ozone.

433
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:30,484
Are you in love with the guy?

434
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,552
Come on, Stanley.

435
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:34,694
I just like the way he dances.

436
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:45,431
What's this Stanley tells me about
our daughter dancing in Paris?

437
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,669
Darling, she doesn't have the job yet.

438
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:51,578
I also understand that she's been
back in the streets with that...

439
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:54,615
Bozo or Turbine
or whatever the hell their names are.

440
00:38:54,718 --> 00:38:57,949
She isn't in the streets, she's volunteering.
It's charity work.

441
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:01,354
She's helping all those
poor, little, underprivileged children.

442
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:04,189
Yeah, I'm going to do something about
all this nonsense.

443
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:07,856
I don't know what you can do. Kelly's
old enough to make her own decisions.

444
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,798
- I'm going to find a way. Call her up.
- Yes, dear.

445
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:13,029
- Get her over here for dinner.
- Yes, dear.

446
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:15,731
- I want to talk to that girl.
- Yes, dear.

447
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,640
You know, maybe my father could help.

448
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:31,078
I'm invited over for dinner tomorrow night.
Why don't you guys come over?

449
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:32,587
That's a whacked idea.

450
00:39:32,656 --> 00:39:34,624
Why? He's an intelligent man.

451
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:36,921
He can help us out or give us good advice.

452
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:38,621
I don't beg from rich people.

453
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:40,590
I work for what I get.

454
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:46,401
- I thought you'd do anything for those kids.
- Well, it's not that.

455
00:39:47,337 --> 00:39:48,998
I don't want to use you, Kelly.

456
00:39:54,378 --> 00:39:55,970
That's okay.

457
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:00,713
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

458
00:40:15,052 --> 00:40:16,952
Wow, this is some layout.

459
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:20,249
When you said money,
I wasn't expecting all this.

460
00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:23,783
Come on, Ozone, they're just people.

461
00:40:24,028 --> 00:40:25,427
Rich people.

462
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:29,056
Very rich people.

463
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,259
They're also my family.

464
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:34,001
- So are we.
- I know. Come on.

465
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,539
Hi, Rosa.

466
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:44,213
I'd like you to meet my friends.

467
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:46,212
This is Ozone and Turbo.

468
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:54,723
Hi, Mom.

469
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:57,986
- Hello, dear.
- Good to see you.

470
00:40:58,162 --> 00:40:59,595
How you been doing?

471
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:04,957
So you must be Turbo and Ozone.

472
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:09,604
You certainly have original names.

473
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:13,134
Unique flair for fashion...

474
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:16,709
which apparently is rubbing off
on my daughter.

475
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,179
Thank you.

476
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,774
That must be Dad.

477
00:41:22,353 --> 00:41:24,287
- Thank you.
- Derek?

478
00:41:24,455 --> 00:41:26,980
Hello, Evelyn. You look lovely as always.

479
00:41:27,057 --> 00:41:29,491
I'm so happy
you could accept our invitation.

480
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,959
Thank you very much.

481
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:32,860
Hello, Kelly.

482
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:34,755
Hi.

483
00:41:34,832 --> 00:41:38,461
Boys, this is Derek Sloane, Kelly's fiancé.

484
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:40,561
- Hi.
- What's up?

485
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:42,528
Hello.

486
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,400
Mother.

487
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,404
What's he doing here?
You know I can't stand him.

488
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,675
Don't blame me, I didn't know.

489
00:41:52,316 --> 00:41:55,513
Well, your father thought
it would be a good idea.

490
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,387
Sharp outfit.

491
00:41:58,088 --> 00:41:59,316
We know.

492
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:01,652
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

493
00:42:01,725 --> 00:42:03,852
I want you to meet my friends.

494
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,728
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Very good.

495
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,767
How's your law practice coming along?

496
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:14,600
Very well. Fortunately, in Hollywood,
everybody sues everybody.

497
00:42:20,578 --> 00:42:22,068
Shall we dine?

498
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:39,021
Bon appétit.

499
00:42:48,772 --> 00:42:51,036
So, what do you think?

500
00:42:52,142 --> 00:42:53,803
Good?

501
00:42:58,482 --> 00:42:59,813
See, Mrs. B...

502
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:02,108
everyone loves your cooking.

503
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:07,246
They should. After all, you spent a fortune
sending me to Cordon Bleu.

504
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,689
- It was well worth it.
- But I do enjoy it.

505
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,818
It's pretty good.

506
00:43:10,894 --> 00:43:15,263
This is the first time I've tried this dish,
but I'm really rather pleased.

507
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:20,033
Wonderful.

508
00:43:20,537 --> 00:43:21,936
Yes, it is good.

509
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:25,464
You know, I think I'm going to have
just a little bit more, if I may.

510
00:43:27,778 --> 00:43:30,542
Well, boys,
how are things going down at your club?

511
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:33,879
Kelly tells me you've been doing
wonderful things for these...

512
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:36,044
poor, little deprived children.

513
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,748
Actually,
Miracles is having some trouble, Dad.

514
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:41,552
Those people can't stay out of trouble,
no matter what.

515
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:44,116
You're looking at one of "those people."

516
00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:46,856
Derek didn't mean to be rude.

517
00:43:46,964 --> 00:43:48,522
Did you, Derek?

518
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:51,663
Derek always means to be rude.

519
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,198
Well, what kind of trouble are you in?

520
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:58,969
We're not in trouble, our building is.

521
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,971
They want to tear it down
and build a stupid shopping center there.

522
00:44:03,047 --> 00:44:05,572
But they're giving us a chance
to save the building.

523
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:08,440
Oh, I see.

524
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:12,656
You're here for money.

525
00:44:12,756 --> 00:44:15,816
I know what you people do with money.
You mismanage it.

526
00:44:15,893 --> 00:44:20,489
You spend it on drugs
and fancy clothes and cars.

527
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:21,955
Dad!

528
00:44:22,032 --> 00:44:25,058
I don't see any point
in throwing good money after bad.

529
00:44:25,235 --> 00:44:26,566
Come on, Turbo.

530
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:31,335
Look, we don't need your help.
We can take care of our own.

531
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:34,135
And thanks for the dinner, Mrs. Bennett.

532
00:44:34,211 --> 00:44:36,577
Yes, we loved your cooking.

533
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,674
Could we have a roll?

534
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,887
Arrogant riffraff.

535
00:44:50,928 --> 00:44:53,692
Sorry about the other night.
I should have known better.

536
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:56,096
My parents live in a world all their own.

537
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:58,862
That's okay. I kinda liked your cat.

538
00:45:00,471 --> 00:45:02,632
Ozone was really mad, though.

539
00:45:02,706 --> 00:45:05,539
He was mad, but he wasn't mad at you.
It was just...

540
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,938
Don't worry about it. He'll cool off.

541
00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:11,645
Kelly, listen to this situation.

542
00:45:12,616 --> 00:45:15,676
I've got this friend. He likes this girl.

543
00:45:15,753 --> 00:45:17,448
Does she like him?

544
00:45:18,155 --> 00:45:19,144
Yeah.

545
00:45:19,456 --> 00:45:20,787
Then what's the problem?

546
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:24,487
Well, it's just that he gets so confused...

547
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:28,993
because he's such a cool dude,
and he's never had these feelings before.

548
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:31,967
- This must be a good friend of yours, Turbo.
- Yeah.

549
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:37,568
Don't worry about it so much.
I've seen her looking at you.

550
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:41,544
It's just that I don't know what to say or do.

551
00:45:41,612 --> 00:45:42,977
Just say yes.

552
00:45:43,046 --> 00:45:44,673
- "Yes"?
- Yes.

553
00:45:45,082 --> 00:45:46,174
Yes!

554
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:06,065
<i>You look so good to me</i>
<i>like living in a fantasy</i>

555
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:09,597
<i>Turn it up, yeah</i>

556
00:46:09,673 --> 00:46:13,541
<i>You look so good to me</i>
<i>Oh, baby, it's heavenly</i>

557
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,011
<i>I'm so excited</i>

558
00:46:20,951 --> 00:46:23,579
<i>I thought I'd never fall in love with you</i>

559
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:25,622
<i>I tried to fight it</i>

560
00:46:28,225 --> 00:46:30,557
<i>I thought it was a game</i>

561
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:32,786
<i>My body's trembling</i>

562
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:38,600
<i>at the sight of your sweet face</i>

563
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:40,364
<i>and not to mention</i>

564
00:46:42,973 --> 00:46:45,669
<i>you turn my tears to joy</i>

565
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,840
<i>Now that I've found you</i>
<i>Girl, it's love so true</i>

566
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:58,281
<i>All I want to do is be loved by you</i>

567
00:47:01,558 --> 00:47:05,460
<i>Girl, this must be love,</i>
<i>'cause it feels so right</i>

568
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:07,887
<i>So right</i>

569
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:12,993
<i>Say you'll always stay,</i>
<i>your love takes me high</i>

570
00:47:16,406 --> 00:47:20,137
<i>You look so good to me</i>
<i>like living in a fantasy</i>

571
00:47:21,178 --> 00:47:23,612
<i>I don't want to come down, no</i>

572
00:47:23,814 --> 00:47:27,580
<i>You look so good to me</i>
<i>Oh, baby, it's heavenly</i>

573
00:47:28,552 --> 00:47:31,020
<i>I don't want to come down</i>

574
00:47:31,188 --> 00:47:34,919
<i>You look so good to me</i>
<i>like living in a fantasy</i>

575
00:47:36,026 --> 00:47:37,926
<i>I don't want to come down</i>

576
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:42,360
<i>You look so good to me</i>
<i>Oh, baby, it's heavenly</i>

577
00:47:44,968 --> 00:47:46,765
<i>Now that I got ya</i>

578
00:47:49,506 --> 00:47:52,339
<i>I thought I'd never let you get away</i>

579
00:47:52,476 --> 00:47:54,273
<i>Somethin' about you</i>

580
00:47:56,947 --> 00:47:59,177
<i>You make me feel this way</i>

581
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:01,675
<i>Now we're united</i>

582
00:48:04,788 --> 00:48:07,382
<i>Oh, baby, it's such a view</i>

583
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:11,791
<i>If I can take, I'll take your love</i>
<i>Only you can fix me up</i>

584
00:48:11,995 --> 00:48:14,828
<i>It doesn't seem real</i>

585
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,593
<i>Now that I've found you,</i>
<i>you're the love so true</i>

586
00:48:23,073 --> 00:48:28,033
<i>All I want to do is be loved by you</i>

587
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,876
<i>Girl, this must be love</i>
<i>'cause it feels so right</i>

588
00:48:36,086 --> 00:48:37,644
<i>So right</i>

589
00:48:37,821 --> 00:48:42,554
<i>Say you'll always be</i>
<i>Your love takes me high</i>

590
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:01,133
<i>Baby</i>

591
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:18,654
<i>You look so good to me</i>
<i>like living in a fantasy</i>

592
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,324
<i>I don't want to come down</i>

593
00:49:22,399 --> 00:49:26,130
<i>You look so good to me</i>
<i>like living in a fantasy</i>

594
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,764
<i>I don't want to come down</i>

595
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:34,409
<i>Party people, this the place to be</i>

596
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:38,807
<i>Check what you paid your money to see</i>

597
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:43,152
<i>On the wheels of steel, the L-O-V-E</i>

598
00:49:45,455 --> 00:49:48,185
<i>And the prince of darkness</i>
<i>will cut his swath</i>

599
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,829
<i>Now he's the beast from the east</i>
<i>and the best from the west</i>

600
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:55,262
<i>So when they go up and down</i>
<i>it tastes like this</i>

601
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:23,086
<i>Come on</i>

602
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,720
<i>The word's going up, I'll tell you what it be</i>

603
00:50:25,796 --> 00:50:28,321
<i>Believe it and you'll freak it</i>
<i>Let your mind feel free</i>

604
00:50:28,398 --> 00:50:30,366
<i>Shuffle, shake,</i>
<i>and then rock to the beat</i>

605
00:50:30,434 --> 00:50:32,732
<i>Go off in your artistic insanity</i>

606
00:50:40,143 --> 00:50:41,474
<i>Go off</i>

607
00:50:56,927 --> 00:50:59,088
Yo! Strobe!

608
00:51:07,737 --> 00:51:10,535
Get away from me, man.
I ain't got nothin' to say to you.

609
00:51:10,607 --> 00:51:14,043
Look, man, I want to call a truce, all right?

610
00:51:14,578 --> 00:51:16,011
We want you with us.

611
00:51:16,246 --> 00:51:19,215
Look, if they tear down Miracles,
that's our neighborhood.

612
00:51:19,282 --> 00:51:22,149
Don't you see, man?
They'll redevelop us out of existence.

613
00:51:22,853 --> 00:51:26,118
We need your juice, Strobe.
We need to be united, man.

614
00:51:28,425 --> 00:51:31,758
Ozone, don't lay the jive on me, man.

615
00:51:32,963 --> 00:51:34,430
I don't need it.

616
00:51:58,955 --> 00:52:01,651
Ozone, guess what?

617
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:04,853
They offered me the part.
I can go to Paris if I want to.

618
00:52:04,928 --> 00:52:06,361
Are you going or not?

619
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:08,897
I don't know. I have to decide tonight.

620
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:11,024
It's what you want. Take it.

621
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:14,297
It used to be what I wanted.
I don't even know anymore.

622
00:52:14,371 --> 00:52:16,339
Hey, look, baby, I can't decide for you.

623
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:19,239
I thought you wanted me
to stay and help with the show.

624
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:21,607
It's your life and your career, isn't it?

625
00:52:21,678 --> 00:52:24,511
Why don't you ask your fiancé, Derek?

626
00:52:24,581 --> 00:52:27,880
Maybe he can help you decide,
because I can't hang, baby, you dig?

627
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:57,544
What's the matter, honey?
Did Ozone break your little heart?

628
00:52:59,816 --> 00:53:01,443
He's not your type, girl.

629
00:53:01,518 --> 00:53:04,146
I really don't want to talk about it
right now, okay?

630
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:06,086
I suggest you stay away from him.

631
00:53:06,156 --> 00:53:07,384
Just leave me alone.

632
00:53:07,457 --> 00:53:11,587
You don't belong with Ozone.
You don't belong in this neighborhood.

633
00:53:11,728 --> 00:53:15,289
Honey, you just keep showing your
pretty little face around here...

634
00:53:15,365 --> 00:53:18,129
and it's not going to stay pretty
much longer.

635
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:38,081
Stanley, hi, this is Kelly.

636
00:53:40,023 --> 00:53:41,854
I've decided to take the job.

637
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:44,149
Yeah, when do we leave?

638
00:53:47,564 --> 00:53:49,031
Yeah, I'll be ready.

639
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,193
Why don't you call me
when you get all the details?

640
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:58,265
Kelly, you are so lucky to be going to Paris.

641
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:03,078
Do you know when your father and I
honeymooned there, it was so romantic?

642
00:54:03,146 --> 00:54:06,172
All those wonderful little cafés.

643
00:54:06,249 --> 00:54:10,845
I loved it. It was so beautiful.
We had such fun.

644
00:54:12,122 --> 00:54:16,024
Your father looked so handsome
in his white linen suit.

645
00:54:22,966 --> 00:54:24,433
Darling.

646
00:54:26,703 --> 00:54:30,867
You'll forget all about this
once you get to Paris, really you will.

647
00:54:31,608 --> 00:54:33,439
Let's go, okay, Mom?

648
00:54:48,992 --> 00:54:51,222
<i>Electric Boogaloo</i>

649
00:56:08,638 --> 00:56:12,165
<i>Power, you give me power</i>

650
00:56:14,544 --> 00:56:16,705
<i>Baby, Electric Boogaloo</i>

651
00:56:17,647 --> 00:56:19,808
<i>You turn me on</i>

652
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,374
<i>I've got to hold you</i>

653
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:57,348
<i>It feels so right to connect up with your love</i>

654
00:57:15,572 --> 00:57:20,407
<i>I like the way you turn me on</i>
<i>with just a single kiss</i>

655
00:57:23,813 --> 00:57:26,441
<i>You stimulate in such a way</i>

656
00:57:26,516 --> 00:57:29,314
<i>that you can hardly miss</i>

657
00:57:35,792 --> 00:57:38,317
<i>Commissioner Snyder,</i>
<i>since no one has come forward...</i>

658
00:57:38,394 --> 00:57:41,420
<i>with funds in the amount required</i>
<i>to save this building...</i>

659
00:57:41,498 --> 00:57:44,160
<i>our office feels it would be</i>
<i>to the city's advantage...</i>

660
00:57:44,234 --> 00:57:46,930
<i>to tear it down</i>
<i>and put the property up for sale.</i>

661
00:57:47,003 --> 00:57:51,133
<i>This would not only upgrade the entire area,</i>
<i>but make it commercially viable.</i>

662
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:53,199
Viable for who?

663
00:57:58,548 --> 00:58:02,348
<i>The chair, at this time, does not recognize</i>
<i>comments from the floor.</i>

664
00:58:02,418 --> 00:58:06,616
And the floor recognizes this panel's
trying to push us out of our neighborhood.

665
00:58:06,689 --> 00:58:08,987
<i>I object to this outrageous interruption</i>!

666
00:58:09,058 --> 00:58:12,516
<i>Mr. Randall, this is a public meeting.</i>

667
00:58:13,062 --> 00:58:14,324
Right.

668
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:18,897
And the public says that Miracles is more
than just a piece of property.

669
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:24,006
It's people.

670
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:29,037
Miracles is the lifeline of our kids.

671
00:58:29,746 --> 00:58:32,806
Now, we know what kids can do
with pistols, knives and needles.

672
00:58:32,882 --> 00:58:35,316
Miracles makes them
feel good about themselves.

673
00:58:35,385 --> 00:58:40,049
Gives them something to look forward to.
Gives them a sense of achievement.

674
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:42,591
And it's not by stepping on people.

675
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:45,787
It's by working hard and working together.

676
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,574
<i>Those are certainly admirable goals, sir...</i>

677
00:58:59,642 --> 00:59:02,668
<i>and the city greatly appreciates your efforts.</i>

678
00:59:02,745 --> 00:59:06,112
<i>But the fact is that</i>
<i>the building that houses Miracles...</i>

679
00:59:06,182 --> 00:59:08,309
<i>has been considered unsafe.</i>

680
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:11,382
It's not unsafe.

681
00:59:11,454 --> 00:59:15,948
<i>And, unfortunately, you just haven't</i>
<i>come forward with enough funds to save it.</i>

682
00:59:16,426 --> 00:59:19,589
But we're working on a show.
We'll make lots of money.

683
00:59:20,797 --> 00:59:22,458
<i>Commissioner...</i>

684
00:59:22,532 --> 00:59:25,330
<i>it's clear that</i>
<i>it's beyond these people's resources...</i>

685
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:28,234
<i>to provide the necessary improvements</i>
<i>for this building.</i>

686
00:59:28,304 --> 00:59:29,794
<i>In light of the fact...</i>

687
00:59:29,872 --> 00:59:33,399
<i>that the city has already received</i>
<i>a healthy bid from Mr. Douglas...</i>

688
00:59:33,476 --> 00:59:36,445
<i>the Planning Office recommends</i>
<i>to the Zoning Board...</i>

689
00:59:36,512 --> 00:59:40,209
<i>that we approve the development plan</i>
<i>for this proposed shopping center.</i>

690
00:59:40,283 --> 00:59:42,274
- You're crazy.
- Crazy?

691
00:59:42,518 --> 00:59:43,712
<i>Order</i>!

692
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:45,552
<i>Order here</i>!

693
00:59:52,462 --> 00:59:55,556
<i>I'm afraid that the Zoning Committee</i>
<i>has no choice...</i>

694
00:59:55,632 --> 00:59:57,691
<i>but to accept the development bid...</i>

695
00:59:57,767 --> 01:00:00,292
<i>on the property currently occupied</i>
<i>by Miracles.</i>

696
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:02,600
- What?
- You're crazy.

697
01:00:02,672 --> 01:00:04,264
- You can't do that.
- Come on.

698
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,399
You guys are whacked, man.

699
01:00:07,577 --> 01:00:08,805
Whacked?

700
01:00:08,878 --> 01:00:10,106
Who...

701
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:15,110
<i>And the building will have to be vacated</i>
<i>within the next two weeks.</i>

702
01:00:15,184 --> 01:00:16,617
Wait a minute.

703
01:00:16,686 --> 01:00:18,745
<i>This hearing is adjourned.</i>

704
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:24,325
Yo, Douglas.

705
01:00:25,828 --> 01:00:27,625
You haven't won yet.

706
01:00:27,697 --> 01:00:31,189
You may have the city dancing
to your music, but you don't have us.

707
01:00:31,267 --> 01:00:32,757
Get out of my way.

708
01:00:34,871 --> 01:00:38,500
Hey, man, we're going to stop you,
commission or no commission.

709
01:00:38,574 --> 01:00:40,565
Listen, if you cause me more trouble...

710
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:44,340
I'll finish you, your friends,
and your whole damned neighborhood.

711
01:00:45,214 --> 01:00:46,909
Listen, sucker!

712
01:00:51,087 --> 01:00:52,884
What are we going to do now?

713
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:55,822
Well, if there's one thing
I'm sure we're going to do...

714
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:58,122
- it's not give up, right?
- Yeah!

715
01:00:58,795 --> 01:01:00,285
That's right.

716
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:07,101
Bobby, set that on the corner post.

717
01:01:18,214 --> 01:01:19,647
Hey, man.

718
01:01:19,716 --> 01:01:21,843
- Take my picture!
- Get out of here, okay?

719
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:31,455
What seems to be the problem?

720
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:33,893
Come on, kid, beat it, will you?

721
01:01:33,963 --> 01:01:35,658
Yo, man, what's up?

722
01:01:39,669 --> 01:01:42,968
- I got your lunch!
- Hey, right now. Come on.

723
01:02:42,098 --> 01:02:43,690
See? I'm ready.

724
01:02:46,102 --> 01:02:48,263
Who's that? Can you get it?

725
01:02:51,174 --> 01:02:54,234
- Ozone.
- Kelly, Turbo's been hurt real bad.

726
01:02:54,343 --> 01:02:58,177
- Where is he? What's happened?
- He's in the hospital. Come on.

727
01:02:58,247 --> 01:03:02,445
Kelly, you can't miss this plane.
You're expected in Paris tomorrow.

728
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:05,384
Paris is going to have to wait.

729
01:03:05,454 --> 01:03:08,389
They won't wait. They'll hire someone else.

730
01:03:10,026 --> 01:03:14,463
Well, let them hire someone else,
or get me another ticket or something.

731
01:03:19,602 --> 01:03:20,694
Yes?

732
01:03:30,746 --> 01:03:34,113
Turbo, why don't you wake up,
you suck-off?

733
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,511
Yeah, man. Come on, wake up.

734
01:03:36,819 --> 01:03:38,719
What're you doing in there?

735
01:03:38,788 --> 01:03:42,724
- I don't know. What's she doing in there?
- Maybe she lives in there.

736
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:55,964
He's talking!

737
01:03:57,406 --> 01:03:59,772
- He's okay!
- I don't believe it.

738
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:04,475
- Hey, man, don't leave now.
- Hey, man, wake up.

739
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:12,286
Man, I am hungry. Get me some food!

740
01:04:12,355 --> 01:04:14,482
He's hungry! Turbo's hungry.

741
01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:18,283
Come on, he's okay!

742
01:04:18,361 --> 01:04:19,988
<i>Now jam the box</i>

743
01:04:27,603 --> 01:04:29,332
<i>Emergency</i>

744
01:04:33,342 --> 01:04:34,866

01:04:51,127 --> 01:04:54,460

01:04:58,401 --> 01:05:01,461
<i>I get this burning feeling</i>

01:05:02,271 --> 01:05:05,866
<i>And my fever reappears</i>

751
01:05:11,013 --> 01:05:13,811
<i>I lose control</i>

01:05:13,883 --> 01:05:15,874
<i>My heart skips a beat</i>

753
01:05:15,952 --> 01:05:20,218
<i>Your love is building me up</i>

754
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:23,315
<i>while wearing me down</i>

755
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,818
<i>It's critical</i>

756
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:31,093
<i>When I see you, I get so intensive</i>

757
01:05:32,134 --> 01:05:34,125

<i>When I see you, I get so intensive</i>

759
01:05:42,178 --> 01:05:44,305
<i>Condition's not getting better</i>

760
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:47,144
Now you two, get on with you.
This is my floor.

761
01:05:49,418 --> 01:05:52,819
<i>You got me living on the razor's edge</i>

762

01:05:56,292 --> 01:05:59,853
<i>Love me down, baby</i>

01:06:01,564 --> 01:06:04,089

01:06:08,804 --> 01:06:12,797

No, we're losing him!

He's flatlining, Doctor.
There's nothing I can do.

773

It's too late. We lost him.

<i>Call the orderly</i>

779
01:07:05,294 --> 01:07:07,228
<i>I need a drink</i>

780
01:07:09,632 --> 01:07:12,430
<i>Call the hospital orderly</i>

781
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,363
<i>I think I'm gonna freak</i>

782
01:07:20,743 --> 01:07:25,339
<i>When I see you, I get so intensive</i>

783
01:07:28,384 --> 01:07:32,548
<i>When I see you, I get so intensive</i>

784
01:08:00,015 --> 01:08:01,505
What happened?

785
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:21,027
Dad?

786
01:08:21,604 --> 01:08:23,868
I find this hard to believe...

787
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:27,102
but Stanley tells me that
you backed out of that Paris deal...

788
01:08:27,176 --> 01:08:29,940
in order to run off with that...

789
01:08:30,012 --> 01:08:31,775
street dancer.

790
01:08:32,381 --> 01:08:34,178
Well, may I come in?

791
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:40,083
Oh, boy.

792
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:44,224
I've got an offer for you, Kelly.

793
01:08:44,493 --> 01:08:47,951
I'll bail out Miracles,
pay the cost of renovation...

794
01:08:48,097 --> 01:08:49,860
on the condition...

795
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:53,997
that you stay out of that neighborhood,
and go to Princeton.

796
01:08:55,404 --> 01:08:57,872
I really do want to help Miracles.

797
01:08:59,175 --> 01:09:00,699
Maybe I should do it.

798
01:09:00,776 --> 01:09:02,744
A very sensible decision.

799
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:04,335
No, you won't.

800
01:09:04,547 --> 01:09:06,538
I can't let you do that.

801
01:09:07,082 --> 01:09:09,607
That's not what you want.

802
01:09:09,852 --> 01:09:11,786
That's not what you are.

803
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:15,849
Why don't you just stay out of this?

804
01:09:15,925 --> 01:09:18,792
I told you, we can take care of ourselves.

805
01:09:18,861 --> 01:09:20,886
We don't need your money.

806
01:09:21,297 --> 01:09:23,026
But we do need you.

807
01:09:25,434 --> 01:09:26,924
You really mean that.

808
01:09:27,836 --> 01:09:29,098
Wise up.

809
01:09:29,738 --> 01:09:32,798
Your pride can't afford to turn down
an offer like this.

810
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:35,309
And what do you know about pride?

811
01:09:36,178 --> 01:09:39,636
Pride's more important to our kids
than your money will ever be.

812
01:09:39,715 --> 01:09:43,014
Nobody is going to tell me
when to lay down my pride.

813
01:09:43,085 --> 01:09:47,215
Let me tell you something.
That theatre, or whatever it is, of yours...

814
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:50,884
that's just another public project
that takes good money...

815
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,928
and throws it down the toilet.

816
01:09:52,995 --> 01:09:55,520
Why are you always
so negative about everything?

817
01:09:55,598 --> 01:09:59,830
Everything that I have ever wanted to do,
you have always been against it.

818
01:09:59,902 --> 01:10:01,028
Dad, I'm staying.

819
01:10:01,103 --> 01:10:03,537
You're making a big mistake, Kelly.

820
01:10:03,606 --> 01:10:04,834
I've got to get out of here.

821
01:10:04,907 --> 01:10:08,035
I've got to get back to Miracles
and help with the show.

822
01:10:08,143 --> 01:10:10,805
I can't be laying up in this traction.

823
01:10:11,413 --> 01:10:13,005
You don't understand.

824
01:10:13,082 --> 01:10:14,242
You...

825
01:10:15,117 --> 01:10:17,244
must help me get out of here.

826
01:10:20,222 --> 01:10:23,555
It's very important for me to get out of here.
I can't lie in bed...

827
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:24,684
Look.

828
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,627
This belongs on stage, not in no hospital.

829
01:11:01,864 --> 01:11:03,161
Come on.

830
01:11:40,836 --> 01:11:41,894
Are you new here?

831
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:44,768
You have to take linens down
in the service elevator.

832
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,535
Me no English.

833
01:11:46,608 --> 01:11:50,374
When are they going to hire some help
that speaks the language?

834
01:11:52,848 --> 01:11:54,213
Guess who?

835
01:12:00,155 --> 01:12:02,555
Hey, you guys ready for the show?

836
01:12:04,827 --> 01:12:07,159
Tear this show up, right on.

837
01:12:23,011 --> 01:12:24,911
What's she doing here?

838
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:31,351
I thought I told you to stay away from here.

839
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:34,617
- I didn't take your advice.
- I can see that.

840
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:38,786
Kelly, I'm only going to tell you this
one more time. Leave.

841
01:12:38,861 --> 01:12:41,352
You're not going to tell me what to do
or where to go.

842
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:45,457
I liked it a lot better here with you gone,
and I want it to stay that way.

843
01:12:45,534 --> 01:12:50,198
You think you're so tough, don't you?
Well, you don't have your bodyguards.

844
01:12:50,272 --> 01:12:53,298
You know, I turned down
a good job in Paris to stay here...

845
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:56,173
and not you or anybody
is going to tell me when to leave.

846
01:12:56,245 --> 01:12:57,644
I'm staying!

847
01:13:10,392 --> 01:13:12,292
What are we going to do, Ozone?

848
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:15,558
I know what we're going to do.
Turn on the music.

849
01:14:23,532 --> 01:14:26,262
Get out of here! Move away!

850
01:14:26,502 --> 01:14:28,333
Get off that machine!

851
01:14:29,137 --> 01:14:31,435
- What's going on here?
- Look at this.

852
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:35,307
Never mind that.
I said to get this thing moving.

853
01:14:35,377 --> 01:14:37,004
Now get it moving!

854
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:40,014
- Okay, you're right.
- Damn right, I'm right.

855
01:14:57,165 --> 01:14:58,962
Hey, what's going on?

856
01:14:59,835 --> 01:15:01,803
Hey, that's Turbo.

857
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,701
Come on now, move it!

858
01:15:04,206 --> 01:15:05,935
Get out of the way.

859
01:15:06,008 --> 01:15:08,306
Get out of here, man, what's up?

860
01:15:12,147 --> 01:15:14,172
Get away from there, kid.

861
01:15:15,117 --> 01:15:17,608
You going to run me over
with the bulldozer?

862
01:15:17,686 --> 01:15:22,385
You going to try break down the building?
You'll have to get past me, sucker.

863
01:15:25,861 --> 01:15:27,522
Man, I said stop!

864
01:15:28,564 --> 01:15:30,361
- Why did you stop?
- The kid...

865
01:15:30,432 --> 01:15:33,128
I don't care about the kid.
Knock that stage down now!

866
01:15:33,201 --> 01:15:35,431
- No way.
- What do you mean, "No way"?

867
01:15:35,504 --> 01:15:38,496
- You paid for a job, not to kill kids.
- Who're you working for?

868
01:15:38,574 --> 01:15:40,337
- We're going home.
- No, you're not.

869
01:15:40,409 --> 01:15:42,877
You wait here.
I'll get that kid out of the way.

870
01:15:42,945 --> 01:15:46,881
- I'm staying right here, man.
- Let's go, let's get out of here.

871
01:15:53,121 --> 01:15:56,352
Where are you going?
Bring that machine back here!

872
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:01,953
You'll not work again for me!
Bring that machine back!

873
01:16:30,692 --> 01:16:33,024
We'll be right here,
we'll get the background, okay?

874
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,600
Good afternoon.
This is Howard Howard, Channel 3 News.

875
01:16:40,669 --> 01:16:43,934
Today, the little guys
are going to take on the big guys.

876
01:16:44,006 --> 01:16:46,770
Right behind me here
you see a bunch of spunky kids...

877
01:16:46,842 --> 01:16:49,709
who are getting ready
to fight City Hall in their own way.

878
01:16:49,778 --> 01:16:52,542
Why? Because they don't want
this Community Center...

879
01:16:52,614 --> 01:16:54,946
torn down for a shopping center.

880
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:57,678
There's a gentleman here I'd like to bring in.

881
01:16:57,753 --> 01:17:00,517
This is Mr. Ken Randall,
from the City Planning Office.

882
01:17:00,589 --> 01:17:04,286
Howard Howard, Channel 3 News.
I've got a quick question for you.

883
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:07,419
Will the city let these kids
lose their Community Center?

884
01:17:07,496 --> 01:17:10,158
No, the city is here for the people.

885
01:17:10,365 --> 01:17:13,562
And there's obviously been some kind
of a snafu here.

886
01:17:13,635 --> 01:17:16,968
These things happen,
even in the best of cities.

887
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:18,472
But I can assure you...

888
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:21,100
that we will do everything
to straighten this out...

889
01:17:21,176 --> 01:17:23,906
for the benefit
of those deserving youngsters.

890
01:17:23,979 --> 01:17:25,776
And that's good news.

891
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:29,749
The gentleman coming here is Mr. Douglas,
Douglas Construction.

892
01:17:30,452 --> 01:17:33,853
Mr. Douglas is head of the firm
that wants to tear down this site.

893
01:17:33,922 --> 01:17:37,358
Howard, may I take Randall?
It's important. I need some information.

894
01:17:37,426 --> 01:17:39,223
Certainly.

895
01:17:39,294 --> 01:17:42,229
- What did you say to that guy?
- I said it was a snafu.

896
01:17:42,297 --> 01:17:43,889
What do you mean, "snafu"?

897
01:17:43,965 --> 01:17:46,593
The mayor doesn't need bad publicity
in an election year.

898
01:17:46,668 --> 01:17:50,798
Are you telling me that you and the city
are going to pull out of this?

899
01:17:50,872 --> 01:17:51,964
Yes.

900
01:17:52,107 --> 01:17:55,474
Mr. Douglas. Question, sir.

901
01:17:55,577 --> 01:17:59,980
What action do you plan to take
against these kids blocking your project?

902
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:03,848
Oh, well. We're not going to take any action.

903
01:18:03,952 --> 01:18:06,648
We of the
Douglas Construction Company feel...

904
01:18:06,722 --> 01:18:10,818
we won't disrupt the community,
we will withdraw from the project.

905
01:18:13,995 --> 01:18:16,463
This is a new
and dramatic development, here.

906
01:18:16,531 --> 01:18:20,865
I would like to get a little reaction
and comment from Mr. Byron Smith.

907
01:18:20,936 --> 01:18:24,702
Well, you just heard Mr. Douglas
change his mind on the whole affair.

908
01:18:24,773 --> 01:18:29,733
And I'm sure that Mr. Douglas
will make a nice, sizeable contribution...

909
01:18:29,811 --> 01:18:32,439
to help us pay our loan just fine.

910
01:18:32,514 --> 01:18:35,813
- That right, Mr. Douglas?
- A contribution, yes.

911
01:18:35,884 --> 01:18:39,684
It was suggested that $3,000...

912
01:18:39,755 --> 01:18:42,315
That was suggested by Mr. Randall.

913
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:46,317
But we, of course,
of the Douglas Corporation...

914
01:18:46,394 --> 01:18:48,862
feel that $6,000...

915
01:18:49,364 --> 01:18:51,924
really isn't enough for this project.

916
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,433
Therefore...

917
01:18:53,735 --> 01:18:56,602
In fact, we're going to make a donation...

918
01:18:56,671 --> 01:18:58,935
of $10,000!

919
01:19:04,146 --> 01:19:07,582
As you can see,
there's a lot of excitement here today.

920
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:10,140
Finally the little guys
are coming out on top...

921
01:19:10,218 --> 01:19:13,984
and I think that victory
deserves a lot of applause from all of us.

922
01:19:19,561 --> 01:19:22,359
Ozone, quick question!
Howard Howard, Channel 3 News.

923
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:24,955
You really danced your way to victory today.

924
01:19:25,033 --> 01:19:28,730
Well, it's not over yet.
We need a miracle to save Miracles.

925
01:19:28,804 --> 01:19:31,102
We're $150,000 short.

926
01:19:31,173 --> 01:19:33,198
Why don't you tell them about it?

927
01:19:33,275 --> 01:19:37,678
We're having a show today, right here,
to raise money to save Miracles.

928
01:19:37,746 --> 01:19:40,442
There will be dancing, juggling,
the whole works.

929
01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:43,279
So come down,
enjoy yourself and celebrate with us.

930
01:19:43,351 --> 01:19:44,841
I'd like to see you there.

931
01:21:11,072 --> 01:21:12,767
My God, it's Kelly!

932
01:21:14,142 --> 01:21:17,111
I do wish
she'd do something about that hair.

933
01:21:58,887 --> 01:22:01,219
<i>How about it for the Miracles dancers?</i>

934
01:22:01,289 --> 01:22:04,349
<i>Put your hands together for them</i>
<i>one more time.</i>

935
01:22:04,426 --> 01:22:06,986
<i>Now we'd like to bring,</i>
<i>for your appreciation...</i>

936
01:22:07,062 --> 01:22:11,522
<i>put your hands together and welcome,</i>
<i>if you will, Mr. Ice T and Hot Tot</i>!

937
01:22:14,736 --> 01:22:18,900
<i>Yeah, party people in the place to be</i>!
<i>First thing I want you to do is...</i>

938
01:22:18,974 --> 01:22:20,498
<i>clap your hands.</i>

939
01:22:20,575 --> 01:22:22,634
<i>Everybody, clap your hands.</i>

940
01:22:23,478 --> 01:22:25,469
<i>We're here for one reason,</i>
<i>you know it's true</i>

941
01:22:25,547 --> 01:22:27,947
<i>Got to raise a lot of money</i>
<i>before the day is through</i>

942
01:22:28,016 --> 01:22:29,813
<i>This is not a party, but a demonstration</i>

943
01:22:29,884 --> 01:22:32,250
<i>To try to counteract</i>
<i>the city council's legislation</i>

944
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,552
<i>We must save the Miracles, the time is now</i>
<i>All together, we can do it somehow</i>

945
01:22:36,624 --> 01:22:40,856
<i>So reach to your pocket and give us a sign</i>
<i>A quarter, a nickel or even a dime</i>

946
01:22:40,929 --> 01:22:44,956
<i>Everybody in the place sing along with me</i>
<i>Everybody in the place, G-l-V-E</i>

947
01:22:45,033 --> 01:22:46,796
<i>- Say "give"</i>!
- Give!

948
01:22:47,869 --> 01:22:50,599
<i>Give for Miracles to live, say "give"</i>!

949
01:22:52,207 --> 01:22:54,573
<i>Give, so Miracles can live</i>

950
01:22:57,145 --> 01:22:58,806
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

951
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,976
<i>as we check out the scoreboard,</i>
<i>we have $70,000, and we need $200,000.</i>

952
01:23:03,051 --> 01:23:08,045
<i>So please, reach into your pockets.</i>
<i>Right now, welcome, if you will, Little Lee</i>!

953
01:23:50,398 --> 01:23:53,094
These kids have put together
such a show here today...

954
01:23:53,168 --> 01:23:58,071
and single-handedly have raised
over $150,000, which is some feat.

955
01:23:58,139 --> 01:24:00,539
But it's not enough. They have more to go.

956
01:24:00,608 --> 01:24:04,305
They have to raise at least $200,000.
Are they going to make it?

957
01:24:04,379 --> 01:24:06,370
We're going to support them.

958
01:24:06,448 --> 01:24:10,475
You've got to hand it to those kids.
They really fight for what they believe in.

959
01:24:10,552 --> 01:24:13,612
Darling, that's what
we always taught Kelly to do.

960
01:24:13,688 --> 01:24:15,053
Didn't we?

961
01:24:15,723 --> 01:24:19,124
You know, Mrs. B, I think you're right.

962
01:24:19,394 --> 01:24:20,691
Let's go.

963
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:25,366
<i>Right now, once again, here they are,</i>
<i>the fabulous Miracles dancers.</i>

964
01:26:35,496 --> 01:26:37,794
Dad, what are you doing here?
I thought you...

965
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:39,662
I've been thinking.

966
01:26:39,734 --> 01:26:43,898
I guess we all have to live our lives
the best way we possibly can.

967
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:47,539
You kids have done a great job here today.

968
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:50,033
I'm proud of you, Kelly.

969
01:26:50,144 --> 01:26:51,509
All of you.

970
01:26:51,579 --> 01:26:53,513
Even without Princeton?

971
01:26:54,215 --> 01:26:56,877
Yeah, even without Princeton.

972
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:05,054
Thank you, Dad!

973
01:27:13,901 --> 01:27:15,266
All right!

974
01:27:18,873 --> 01:27:20,465
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

975
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:24,978
<i>I'm holding in my hand, thanks to</i>
<i>the generosity of Mr. And Mrs. Bennett...</i>

976
01:27:25,046 --> 01:27:28,072
<i>a check for $50,000</i>!

977
01:27:28,316 --> 01:27:31,376
<i>We made it</i>! <i>We saved Miracles</i>!

978
01:27:31,452 --> 01:27:33,750
<i>Thank you</i>!

979
01:27:34,155 --> 01:27:37,556
<i>We made it, we made $200,000</i>!

980
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:44,828
<i>And all my doubts and fears</i>

981
01:27:44,899 --> 01:27:47,868
<i>Fly away and disappear</i>

982
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:51,132
<i>As I close my eyes and dream</i>

983
01:27:51,205 --> 01:27:53,935
<i>These dreams of mine</i>

984
01:27:54,876 --> 01:27:57,071
<i>I believe in the beat</i>

985
01:27:58,012 --> 01:28:00,810
<i>I believe in the way I feel</i>

986
01:28:02,183 --> 01:28:07,177
<i>When I'm dancing it seems like</i>
<i>everything's all right</i>

987
01:28:09,157 --> 01:28:10,988
<i>I believe in the beat</i>

988
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:15,486
<i>Nothing can keep me down</i>

989
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:21,224
<i>Just as long as I hear</i>
<i>that sound coming through the night</i>

990
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,114
<i>Harder</i>

991
01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:52,265
