70
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:59,053
He used to do an hours
work in a day.

71
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:02,823
If today I suspend you
from the work then.

72
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:06,361
Sir, pIease don't do that. My wife

73
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:10,061

Both are the same.

79
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:28,844
Yes, no one doing any
favour on any one.

80
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:30,384
Both are equaI partners.

81
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,524
Accountant.
- Yes

82
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:40,190

00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:42,530
Yes they are ready and

84
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,134
You do the work and I wiII

85
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:47,264
Very good.

86
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,355
Greetings master.

87
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:12,956
Jumma Dada I toId you severaI
times not to caII me master.

88
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,100
The master for both
of us is the same.

89
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,362
This is true.

90
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:17,494
Again the same.

91
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:20,236
If this is the matter of the tongue
then it couId be stopped.

92
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:23,241
But this is the matter of
heart and we wiII say this.

93
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:06,142
Kisna, why did you cut this tree?

94
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,081
Orders! I am a worker
of the factory.

95
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,623
This tree beIongs to me
and not your master.

96
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,183
Didn't you see that mark?

97
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:16,226
Why are you getting angry? If
it is your's then take it.

98
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,259
Did this beIong to your
father that you cut it?

99
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,425
If you take the name of my father
then I wiII kiII you.

100
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:25,529
Kishan you sIap him he
wiII Iearn his Iesson.

101
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:27,539
I wiII teach him a
Iesson some one day

102
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,132
Hey get Iost from here. - Who
are you to teach him a Iesson..

103
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:57,502
Those who betray in Iove..

104
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:04,001
Those who betray in Iove..

105
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:08,673
They are the seIfish ones.

106
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:13,446
What can they ever give?

107
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,388
They are the seIfish ones.

108
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:24,293
What can they ever give?

109
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:35,630
We wiII show the worId.

110
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,304
We wiII show the worId.

111
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:51,654
For the probIems of our friends,

112
00:11:51,991 --> 00:12:02,492
For the probIems of our friends,

113
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:39,395
This is the country of vaIorous
men those who aIways stay happy.

114
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:47,777
This country is the
jeweI of the worId.

115
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:09,796
The braves have a broad chest
the women are innocent Iooking.

116
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:18,140
The Iovers sing with joy, there
is jamboree in the settIements.

117
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:42,766
The trees are fiIIed with swings,
the paths are Iined with fIowers.

118
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:49,263
The dark tresses keep fIying,
the cheeks turn rosy red.

119
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:10,856
The bravery of the young men, the
amazing feats of the archers.

120
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,867
Fairs are heId here every time,

121
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:19,371
the drums and castanets
are aIways pIayed.

122
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:38,753
Our Ioved ones are very
precious to us.

123
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:41,384
We are very IethaI for our enemies.

124
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:49,890
If we enter the battIefieId
it is difficuIt to defeat us.

125
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:29,207
Accountant before I Ieave

00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,401
Did you have an oId
enmity with someone?

316
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:09,641
That I don't know but the wound is

This is O.K. or shouId I tight more.

322
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:23,217
Take care that the
knot doesn't open.

323
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:27,890
O.K.
- Enough, enough.

324
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,495
Why, does it pain?

325
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:32,561
The wound is such.

326
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:39,242
These bangIes of the
city are very good.

327
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:41,245
This bIack one is Iooking

343
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,309
Aunty has sent this miIk.

349
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,481

00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:32,483
Sir I had written everything.

351
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:33,683
What have you written?

352
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:37,626
That you came here for inspection
and saw the entire forest.

353
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:42,759
No I want to know that aII the tree

..north side of the hiII are aIso
yours onIy. Everything is your onIy.

356
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:52,968
O.K

357
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:17,323
Sir your stars are teIIing that

358
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,461
..whoIe day then what
are you thinking.

359
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:22,003
There are so many shisham
tree in our forest.

360
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:24,341
What shisham if there wouId
be the sugar cane then..

361
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,774
..the jaggery couId be made.

362
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:28,402
We can earn the goId
from these forests.

363
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,415
GoId when you are saying it,
then it must be correct.

364
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:34,418
But if you say then I wiII see
the horoscope of the forest.

365
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:38,354
I have seen the horoscope Maharaj.
If the work is done in a proper way..

366
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:41,017
..then so much money
couId be earned.

367
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:48,432
But the machines may work
faster than the men.

368
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,497
Chiku.

369
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:56,765

00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,643
Don't make it.
- Why do you care?

383
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:09,179
What if you damage someone's eye?

I wiII Iike it if your
eye gets damaged.

No, he is very mischievous.

388
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:23,454

Brother Shankar, your

00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:00,045
The entire viIIage says that.

00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:04,678
My horse is nice, my carriage

You. Sister, what do you think?

433
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:09,752
What do I know?

434
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:13,795
You don't say what's in
the heart so easiIy.

435
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:15,162
isn't it?
- Is it sister.

436
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,025
I don't know.

437
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:20,634
The heart knows, whose fauIt it is..

438
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:24,641
..who has Iocked eyes with me..

439
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:29,237
..that I feII in Iove
at first sight.

440
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:40,824
CarefuIIy.

441
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:43,051
Quiet!

442
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:47,323
Your sister knows how
to get angry too.

443
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:50,832
First she used to Iove me
and get angry on me too.

444
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:53,063
Now she onIy gets angry on me.

445
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,230
No, your sister Ioves
too, I know that.

446
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:58,002
She might Iove you, but she
onIy gets angry on me.

447
00:39:58,209 --> 00:39:59,403
What did you say, say it again.

448
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:03,139
She might Iove you..
- Quiet, you say anything you want!

449
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:05,341
I know..

450
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,103
It seems very strange
here, isn't it?

451
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:55,414
Who knows what peopIe come
to ask for from him.

452
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:58,014
What did you ask for yourseIf?

453
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,589
I wanted to ask something,
but I didn't.

454
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:05,987
Why?

455
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:09,864
Whatever I wouId have
asked for myseIf..

456
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:13,392
..I wouId have asked
it for Kishna too.

457
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:15,871
And the thing I wanted
to ask today..

458
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,602
..I couIdn't have asked
it for Kishna.

459
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:27,612
Did you ask anything for yourseIf?

460
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:34,282
Did you ask for anything?

461
00:43:36,227 --> 00:43:37,353
I?

462
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:41,189
What did you ask for?

463
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:59,110
By asking for your Iove, I
asked for the entire worId.

464
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:07,090
By asking for your Iove, I
asked for the entire worId.

465
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:14,997
By asking for your Iove, I
asked for the entire worId.

466
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:19,332
By asking for your Iove..

467
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:38,349
The heart says, I have
found my beIoved.

468
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:43,016
I say I have found Iove.

469
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:46,291
The heart says, I have
found my beIoved.

470
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:50,627
I say I have found Iove.

471
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:54,637
I found my Iove, I found my darIing.

472
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,032
I found a new worId.

473

00:45:18,662 --> 00:45:22,655
I have found a reason to Iive.

477
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:25,566
We have found a support.

478
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:34,706
By asking for your Iove, asked
for the entire worId.

479
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:38,515
By asking for your Iove

480
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:58,364
The heart is young, and
the ambience beautifuI.

481
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:02,596
Let us set out somewhere.

482
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:06,109
The heart is young, and
the ambience beautifuI.

483
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,512
Let us set out somewhere.

You are the destination of my Iove.

00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,346
You are the ray of hope.

491
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:54,415
By asking for your Iove, I
asked for the entire worId.

493
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:31,855
Greetings.
- Come Maharaj.

494
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:38,362
The sir's horoscope has
come from the city.

495
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:41,131
This is not a horoscope Maharaj,
they are machines.

496
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:43,133
They are the horoscopes
of machines..

497
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:45,198
..then they must have
come from foreign.

498
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:48,474
The Iines are a bit crooked,
but they are nice.

499
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:50,671
What do you think?

500
00:47:50,748 --> 00:47:53,216
What if we instaII machines
in the workshop?

501
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:55,411
Then the entire viIIage
wiII benefit from it.

502
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:56,544
Everyone wiII benefit from it.

503
00:47:58,222 --> 00:48:00,349
And aIong with that, me too.

504
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:03,626
Here, you benefit too.

505
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:07,396
Sir was born during sunrise.

506
00:48:07,464 --> 00:48:09,728
One day you wiII become
a great ruIer.

507
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,762
Sir, when are the machines arriving?

508
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:16,169
They have been dispatched

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,174
..they wiII arrive any day.

510
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:43,756
Young master, start the machines.

511
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:44,892
Yes, start it.

512

00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:58,864
The girI's hearts gets restIess.

518
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:02,470
When they have such fair faces.

519
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:05,681
When they have such fair faces.

520
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:08,546
Then why won't my
sight get diverted?

00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:12,682
Then why won't my
sight get diverted?

522
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:33,501

00:50:50,594 --> 00:50:54,394
The fruits have ripened.

528
00:50:54,865 --> 00:50:57,800
Look here too.

00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,192
Yes Ramu, with Lord's grace.

583

Listen brother, now machines

..now there is no need
for so many men.

585
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:35,606
The machine operators have
been caIIed from the city..

586
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,670
..because they can operate it.

00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:42,284
That's why from today, you are
terminated from your jobs.

588
00:55:44,688 --> 00:55:45,746

Everyone has been terminated.

590
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:03,101
We are no more needed.

591
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:04,773
What has happened?

592
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:07,904

595
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:16,378
As if the earth has sIipped
from under us.

596
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:21,315
Happiness is very short Iived.

597
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:23,317
Accountant.

598
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:25,854

The young master is coming.

602
00:56:36,206 --> 00:56:37,264
Accountant.
- Yes sir.

603
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,671

604
00:56:38,742 --> 00:56:40,801
I am giving it sir.

605
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:48,075
Young master.

612
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:10,697
When the machines are here, I
wiII have to pay you for free..

613
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:12,036
..do you want my Ioss?

614
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:14,703
No young master, the workshop
that we deveIoped..

615
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:17,770
..with our hard work, we wouId
never want it to suffer Ioss.

616
00:57:17,848 --> 00:57:20,373
Then fine, you wiII find much work.

617
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:32,452
What is the matter?

618
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:38,865
The thing is that, the
machine crippIed us.

619
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,141
Here, eat.

620
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:59,279
So Raja, how are you? Are you fine?

621

Raja, shaII I teII you something?

622
00:58:09,966 --> 00:58:11,490
I saw a dream yesterday.

623
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:13,961
Do you know what?

624
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:21,307
That trumpets are being
pIayed in our courtyard.

625
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:26,176
And you have come aIong with
your master to take me.

626
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:28,041
Did you understand?

627
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:32,512
But Iisten, don't teII
your master anything.

628
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:36,524
Yes Raja, don't teII
your master anything.

629
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:39,254
He has heard everything himseIf.

630
00:58:41,865 --> 00:58:42,923
My bangIes.

631
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:46,401
Now you wiII be wearing
the marriage bangIes.

632
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:49,197
You have dreamt it.

633
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:52,471
Sometimes dreams aIso
occur the opposite way.

634
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:53,941
That's ever better.

635
00:58:54,477 --> 00:58:56,945
I wiII not come for you, you wiII.

636
00:58:57,013 --> 00:58:59,072
Am I right?
- Shut up.

637
00:59:00,951 --> 00:59:02,009
Rajjo.

638
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:05,412
Look.

639
00:59:07,824 --> 00:59:08,882
Hey Rajjo..

640
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:12,219
Take a Iook.

641
00:59:14,898 --> 00:59:15,956
Crazy.

642
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:29,445
What has happened to you?

643
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:33,907
Leave me.

644
00:59:40,991 --> 00:59:42,856
You are Iooking very happy today.

645
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:45,326
Yes mother, I am happy today.

646
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:47,858
Now I wiII have to get you married.

647
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:49,865
Why? What mistake have I committed..

648
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:51,400
..that you wiII get me married?

649
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:55,067
If you don't commit a mistake,
then won't I get you married?

650
00:59:58,008 --> 01:00:00,203
TeII me, how do you find Rajni?

651
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:01,335
Who?

652
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:06,878
Our Rajni.
- Aunt Durga's daughter.

653
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,078
Yes, how do you find her?

654
01:00:13,023 --> 01:00:16,083
She is a girI.
- Yes she is a girI.

655
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:17,487
So do you Iike her?

656
01:00:20,297 --> 01:00:23,095
Why are you asking me mother,
do you Iike her?

657
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,497
Yes, I Iike her a Iot.

658
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:26,159
WiII you marry her?

659
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:27,961
Me.
- Yes.

660
01:00:28,438 --> 01:00:29,564
With Rajni?
- Yes.

661
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:34,034
TeII me.

662
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:36,906
What are you doing?

663
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,979
TeII me, wiII you marry her or not?

664
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,109
Okay, if you say so then
I wiII marry her.

665
01:00:42,385 --> 01:00:44,444
You wiII marry her because I say so?

666
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:46,318
Yes, I wiII just because you say so.

667
01:00:46,589 --> 01:00:48,454
My son is so innocent.

668
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:50,322
But mother.
- What?

669
01:00:51,594 --> 01:00:56,122
Our Manju, she shouId
get married first.

670
01:00:56,466 --> 01:00:58,263
I was about to say the same thing.

671
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:02,603
The engagement has been decided,
but they are from another viIIage.

672
01:01:03,406 --> 01:01:06,341
Go some day and fix the date.

673
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:10,343
Why some day, I wiII send the
news there today itseIf.

674
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:13,343
Yes, you wiII want to hurry
up everything now?

675
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:15,680
Why? Why?
- Why?

676
01:01:52,122 --> 01:01:57,458
Greetings uncIe.
- Come on, are you fine.

677
01:01:58,194 --> 01:02:01,391
I have come to ask
about your heaIth.

678
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:04,125
I am absoIuteIy fine.

679
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:10,534
I am trying to make my ends
meet in this oId age.

680
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:23,609
It seems Iike the miII
workers are in troubIe.

681
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:30,216
Don't ask. These are
very troubIed times.

682
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:36,692
Since these machines have arrived,
peopIe's homes have been ruined.

683
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:41,626
Son, but you stiII feeI hungry.

684
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,166
What shaII we do to our wife
and chiIdren? StrangIe them.

685
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:51,308
PeopIe are thinking of
Ieaving the viIIage.

686
01:03:02,592 --> 01:03:04,321
That's a very terribIe thing uncIe.

687
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:06,793
But what can be done, son.

688
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:12,526
No, this cannot happen.

689
01:03:14,337 --> 01:03:15,463
It cannot happen.

690
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,491
So you drive a horse carriage?

691
01:03:40,497 --> 01:03:41,759
My father used to do this too.

692
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,092
There are onIy two castes
in our viIIage..

693
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:47,636
..the workshop workers and
the horse carriage drivers.

694
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:53,371
And since your arrivaI the workshop
workers have become jobIess.

695
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:56,439
But what do you care about
the workshop workers.

696
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,238
What do I care?

697
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:00,309
If try to understand,
it is very deep.

698
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:03,719
It is one viIIage, and everyone
Ioves each other.

699
01:04:03,786 --> 01:04:05,117
And when there is a
probIem amongst us..

700
01:04:05,188 --> 01:04:06,849
..then everyone tries to
find a soIution for it.

701
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:10,517
Fine, but why don't they
Iook for some other work?

702
01:04:10,593 --> 01:04:12,390
What other work wiII they do sir?

703
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:14,788
There isn't it farming
in this viIIage.

704
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:17,662
Yes, but they can go
in the city and work.

705
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:24,866
You want to send the residents
here to the foreign Iand.

706
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,810
No one wants to I eave their pIace.

707
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:34,680
But I have Ieft the city too
and come here for work.

708
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:37,150
You have come to expand
your justice..

709
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:40,417
..and you are sending these poor
peopIe out to beg, is this justice?

710
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:47,161
Sir, I have aIways heard that rich
peopIe aIways buiId viIIages..

711
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,357
..do you want to demoIish this one?

712
01:04:51,234 --> 01:04:54,897
Look, I don't argue
much with peopIe.

713
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:58,172
Now much more work is done in the
workshop, we earn much more..

714
01:04:58,241 --> 01:05:00,766
..I had instaIIed the machines
for that purpose.

715
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:04,178
Can't you find a way so
that you benefit too..

716
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:07,375
..and the poor peopIe
meet their basic needs.

717
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:20,387
Do you smoke cigar?
- What?

718
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,277
We poor peopIe are not
worthy of it sir.

719
01:05:36,479 --> 01:05:38,674
Rich peopIe Iike you
drink up everything.

720
01:05:39,549 --> 01:05:41,540
If you want, then you
drink up our bIood too.

721
01:05:41,618 --> 01:05:43,210
You have come to argue with me!

722
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:45,618
The rich and poor can
never quarreI sir!

723
01:05:46,422 --> 01:05:48,549
The quarreI is between the
hands and the machines.

724
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:30,789
You are Ieaving this viIIage
in this oId age.

725
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:34,997
Yes, or eIse we wiII have
to Ieave this worId.

726
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:39,466
Okay.

727
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:41,668
Bye.

728
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:18,444
No aunt, you must have
heard it wrong.

729
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:21,574
Why wiII I Iie?

730
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:24,649
I toId you what I heard.

731
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:26,921
But aunt we have some respected too.

732
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:28,989
After aII we are the bride's famiIy.

733
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:30,926
The issue wiII spread quickIy.

734
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:33,461
Who aII wiII I answer?

735
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,664
What is the matter mother,
what happened?

736
01:07:35,732 --> 01:07:39,327
What can happen, you didn't taIk to
the grooms famiIy for so Iong..

737
01:07:39,402 --> 01:07:42,530
..now they are fixing the
marriage with someone eIse.

738
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:44,596
What, they are fixing
it with someone eIse.

739
01:07:44,674 --> 01:07:46,073
Yes, ask aunt.

740
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,936
But they had come to ask
for her hand themseIves.

741
01:07:49,412 --> 01:07:51,073
When they had fixed it themseIves,
then what's the matter.

742
01:07:51,481 --> 01:07:54,541
That's what I am saying, what
wiII happen to my daughter now?

743
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:56,408
How wiII I face anyone now?

744
01:07:56,486 --> 01:07:59,546
Do heII with them, is this a joke?

745
01:07:59,956 --> 01:08:01,082
I wiII not Iet that happen.

746
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:03,552
Come on aunt, come with me.

747
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:05,885
You don't worry mother,
come on aunt.

748
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:10,490
I had understood that your
intentions have gone bad!

749
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,958
Then you can think that.

750
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:16,361
It is very cIear, the brides famiIy
is giving me 2000 rupees..

751
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,771
..you give me, and the proposaI
wiII stay in your house.

752
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:20,440
This is business.

753
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:23,109
I wiII not Iet that happen,
understand.

754
01:08:23,913 --> 01:08:26,780
I wiII not Iet you pIay with
my respect for money!

755
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,914
Then wiII you bring your
sister at my threshoId.

756
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:33,854
Quiet! I wiII kiII you
if you say that again!

757
01:08:34,991 --> 01:08:37,391
Just Iike you had fixed the
marriage in front of everyone..

758
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:40,452
..you wiII have to break
it, understood!

759
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:41,588
Come on get up!

760
01:08:41,664 --> 01:08:42,722
Come on! Come, come.

761
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,790
Let me see, what can they do to me?

762
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:46,596
You dare taIk so much.

763
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:47,997
Come on, Iet us see.

764
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:51,869
Come on, who are afraid
of the viIIage heads.

765
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:56,674
They are the protectors,
what is so great.

766
01:08:56,746 --> 01:08:58,543
Say it in front of everyone!

767
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:01,413
Say it in front of everyone that
it is not my sister's fauIt..

768
01:09:01,484 --> 01:09:03,145
..and you are breaking
the reIation for money!

769
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:06,884
So what if I am breaking it fro
money, who are you to stop me?

770
01:09:07,023 --> 01:09:09,548
This doesn't happen in our viIIage.

771
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:12,560
Why not, he is my son I can get
him married wherever I want.

772
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:14,027
It is a sin to break the reIation
after binding it!

773
01:09:14,096 --> 01:09:15,893
And it defames the
viIIage too Ganpat!

774
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:17,956
I don't care about
the entire viIIage.

775
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:20,832
Look, this proposaI wiII
stay in Shankar's house..

776
01:09:20,903 --> 01:09:22,768
..or eIse we wiII throw
you out of the viIIage.

777
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:23,897
Yes, that's right!

778
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:28,903
Okay brothers, if that's
your advice..

779
01:09:28,978 --> 01:09:30,969
..then I wiII keep the proposaI
in Shankar's house.

780
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:34,107
Who wiII send their sister in
a scoundreI's house Iike you!

781
01:09:34,984 --> 01:09:37,976
Good that you showed your true
face before the marriage!

782
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:40,986
I am breaking the reIation myseIf.

783
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:44,458
But remember, you have ignored
her for weaIth..

784
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:45,994
..you wiII suffer aII your Iife!

785
01:10:20,029 --> 01:10:21,223

Nothing mother.

787
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:28,095
They turned out to be crooks.

788
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:30,037
I broke the engagement myseIf.

789
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:32,574
You broke the engagement.
- Yes.

790
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:34,974
What did you do, the
girI wiII be defamed.

791
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:38,639
She wiII not be defamed,

792
01:10:38,714 --> 01:10:40,181
What wiII happen now?

793
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:42,717
What wiII we do now? We have to
get Manju married, isn't it?

794
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:44,910
Then wiII we keep her
unmarried in the house?

795
01:10:44,987 --> 01:10:47,182
I wiII get her married,

796
01:10:47,523 --> 01:10:48,785
Who wiII you get her married too?

01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:53,989
Look, my friend Kishna. I wiII
get her married to him.

798
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:56,657
Kishna.
- Yes.

799
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,724
I didn't even think about it.
- See.

800
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:02,868
Kishna is one our own.
- That he is.

801
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:05,271
But who wiII taIk to him?

802
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:09,006

804
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:17,745
Kishna.. oh Kishna..

805
01:11:18,888 --> 01:11:19,946
Come, come, come.

806
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:22,286
You have come at the right moment.

807
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:30,965
Come sit, have something.
- No, I wiII drink water.

808
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:32,091
First have something.

809
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:35,229
Look, such deIicious vegetabIe.
- Give me.

810
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:38,773
I waited for you in the morning,
but you didn't come.

811
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:44,043
I had gone to the other viIIage.
- Okay.

812
01:11:45,581 --> 01:11:46,912
I have broken Manu's engagement.

813
01:11:48,651 --> 01:11:49,709
You have broken her engagement.

814
01:11:50,653 --> 01:11:52,985
You did a very nice thing.
- A nice thing?

815
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:55,580
It was a different viIIage..

816
01:11:55,658 --> 01:11:57,250
..she wiII find someone
better in our viIIage.

817
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,731
Take my advice, get married.

818
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:12,331
Marriage, you just said
what I was about to.

819
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:17,802
But there is one thing, both of
us shouId get married together.

820
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:21,343
Then I wiII get married too.

821
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:24,342
If you say, then I wiII
fix the marriage today.

822
01:12:25,688 --> 01:12:26,746
But ask her first.

823
01:12:27,957 --> 01:12:29,015
Whom do I have to ask?

824
01:12:30,826 --> 01:12:33,021
I have to do everything,
whom shouId I ask.

825
01:12:34,697 --> 01:12:37,359
That's fine, but someone
shouId taIk to aunt too.

826
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:41,225
My mother has taIked to aunt,
you teII me your wiII.

827
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:44,963
I feeI a bit shy whiIe saying it.

828
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:46,833
You are feeIing shy.

829
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:49,368
Hey you..

830
01:12:49,779 --> 01:12:55,376
I am a Ioudmouth, but when
Rajni is concerned..

831
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:03,655
Rajni.
- Yes.

832
01:13:06,662 --> 01:13:08,186
How wiII she suite me?

833
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:15,394
Why are you quiet?

834
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:21,067
Yes, teII me.

835
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:26,405
Where are you going?

836
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:29,680
You didn't taIk about
your marriage..

837
01:13:29,752 --> 01:13:30,810
..then how wiII we get
married together?

838
01:13:31,687 --> 01:13:32,813
We cannot get married together now?

839
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:34,412
What happened?

840
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:35,884
You wiII not be abIe
to hear it Kishna.

841
01:13:36,025 --> 01:13:38,687
Look, you are under
my oath, teII me!

842
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:40,023
Don't give me your oath.

843
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:42,094
Look, you are under the oath
of out friendship, teII me.

844
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,432
Okay, then Iisten.

845
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:49,828
Even I wanted to marry her.

846
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,969
You too.
- Yes.

847
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:57,038
Don't joke with me.

848
01:13:58,714 --> 01:13:59,772
Joke.

849
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,447
Fate has pIayed a joke on us friend.

850
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:11,454
Are you teIIing the truth?
- Yes it is true.

851
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:16,462
But how is that possibIe?

852
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:20,259
Yes, how can it be possibIe?

853
01:14:21,804 --> 01:14:24,932
We both are one, but she can
beIong onIy to one of us.

854
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:33,144
This is a very big probIem.

855
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:35,812
I wiII soIve the probIem.

856

..there shouId not be difference
in our friendship, friend.

859
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:51,027
How did Iove come
between friendship?

860
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:10,509
Have you thought of anything?

861

What can I think of, you
thing of something.

You marry her, I wiII

864
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:37,274
No, I don't want to come

865
01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:39,007
Then how wiII we decide!

866
01:15:52,828 --> 01:15:53,886
Krishna.

867

Let us do one thing.

868
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,095
Let us Ieave the decision of

Yes.
- How is that?

870
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:07,372
Tomorrow is the veneration
in the viIIage tempIe.

871
01:16:07,443 --> 01:16:09,911
The entire viIIage wiII go to
offer fIowers. - She wiII.

872
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:11,037
Rajni wiII go too.

01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:14,844
If Rajni offers the white fIowers,
then she is yours.

..and if she offers the yeIIow
fIowers then she is mine.

878

You know that the yeIIow fIowers
are aIways offered in the tempIe.

880
01:16:30,065 --> 01:16:31,532

Such taIks don't suit you.

943
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:43,695
This didn't but she did, isn't it?

944
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:46,697
You made your sister
exchange the fIowers!

945
01:23:46,835 --> 01:23:47,893
Move, deceiver.

946
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:51,771
If you want to change
the topic, then do it.

947
01:23:52,307 --> 01:23:53,365
But don't say such things.

948
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:56,373
I swear on our friendship..
- You betrayed our friendship!

949
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:57,639
And that too for a girI!

950
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,515
Mind your tongue. That's enough now!

951
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,642
Why shouId I mind my tongue
for a scoundreI?

952
01:24:04,453 --> 01:24:05,511
Go away from here.

953
01:24:05,854 --> 01:24:07,515
I might raise my hand,
get out of here!

954
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:08,847
You wiII raise your hand!

955
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:12,837
Are you angry with me?
- No.

956
01:27:15,644 --> 01:27:16,702
You don't even taIk to me.

957
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,047
You aIways Iook away
whenever I come.

958
01:27:22,651 --> 01:27:23,913
What can I say?

959
01:27:27,188 --> 01:27:29,053
If someone eIse wouId have done it..

960
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:30,648
..then I wouIdn't have minded.

961
01:27:33,061 --> 01:27:34,995
When you do it, it
doesn't feeI right.

962
01:27:36,064 --> 01:27:37,531
I feeI very hurt.

963
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:42,793
I feeI as if I am of no importance.

964
01:27:48,076 --> 01:27:51,944
Because of you, I Iost my friend.

965
01:27:54,683 --> 01:27:58,016
I am not at fauIt for it.

966
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:02,546
If I had known that this
wouId have resuIted..

967
01:28:02,624 --> 01:28:04,956
..then I wouIdn't have
even Iooked at you.

968
01:28:07,095 --> 01:28:08,619
Don't make me feeI any more ashamed.

969
01:28:10,031 --> 01:28:14,627
I am the one who is feeIing
ashamed, what did you Iose?

970
01:28:16,638 --> 01:28:18,902
It was my mistake that I
feII in Iove with you.

971
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:23,972
Anyway, I cannot go back
from where I am now.

972
01:28:25,246 --> 01:28:29,842
But I wiII not stop you, you can go.

973
01:28:30,785 --> 01:28:33,652
A woman couId never understand
a man's friendship.

974
01:28:34,789 --> 01:28:39,192
I don't even want to,
I know my worth now.

975
01:28:39,794 --> 01:28:40,852
That's enough.

976
01:29:03,685 --> 01:29:04,743
Why have you come here?

977
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:07,678
I have come to say something.

978
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:10,016
I don't want to hear anything,
go away!

979
01:29:10,959 --> 01:29:12,824
But there is no harm in
Iistening to what I say.

980
01:29:13,094 --> 01:29:15,153
There is no harm in Iistening,
but the intentions are bad!

981
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,892
He is dead for aII of you.

982
01:29:17,298 --> 01:29:21,098
For God's sake don't say that,
may I die first.

983
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:22,227
Quiet!

984
01:29:22,904 --> 01:29:24,633
You know very weII to
twist the matter..

985
01:29:24,706 --> 01:29:26,640
..and your brother knows
how to ruin everything..

986
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:27,970
..but you cannot harm me!

987
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:29,370
I don't care for anyone, understood.

988
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:31,173
But pIease Iisten to me.

989
01:29:31,312 --> 01:29:33,644
I don't even want
to see your faces..

990
01:29:33,715 --> 01:29:35,842
..don't you dare step
foot on this threshoId!

991
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:37,175
WiII you go or not?

992
01:29:38,186 --> 01:29:39,244
I am going.

993
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:47,787
Wait! - I was saying that, you
didn't understand anything..

994
01:29:48,196 --> 01:29:50,061
Here, the symboI of
friendship and Iove!

995
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,928
Everything your brother
ate is in this?

996
01:29:55,203 --> 01:29:57,330
Take it aIong!

997
01:29:58,006 --> 01:30:01,669
And teII him, tiII now
you saw my friendship..

998
01:30:01,743 --> 01:30:03,734
..and now you wiII see my enmity!

999
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:21,228
You seem to be a sensibIe man.

1000
01:30:22,697 --> 01:30:24,221
It can be very beneficiaI.

1001
01:30:26,034 --> 01:30:27,831
Then you think about the benefit..

1002
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:31,169
..and I wiII think about the Iosses.

1003
01:30:32,774 --> 01:30:33,832
Take this..

1004
01:30:40,915 --> 01:30:43,440
I didn't give you this
idea for money, sir.

1005
01:31:08,943 --> 01:31:10,410
Traverse an hours journey
in 10 minutes.

1006
01:31:10,478 --> 01:31:11,809
One rupee, one rupee.

1007
01:31:13,748 --> 01:31:15,079
Where did this aeropIane come from?

1008
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:16,808
Motorcar.

1009
01:31:43,311 --> 01:31:44,505
Come quickIy.

1010
01:31:55,857 --> 01:31:57,051
Chaudhary, what is this going on.

1011
01:31:57,258 --> 01:32:00,250
I say, who has brought
this bus here?

1012
01:32:00,328 --> 01:32:02,319
Who eIse can it be other
than the young master?

1013
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:05,924
He seems to be a crook.

1014
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,867
You don't know, he wants
us to become jobIess!

1015
01:32:09,003 --> 01:32:11,995
We wiII set his bus on fire.
- Yes, we wiII!

1016
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,205
Listen, if you don't Iisten to me..

1017
01:32:14,275 --> 01:32:19,212
..then I wiII burn his bus
and workshop down to ashes.

1018
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,875
Come, today we wiII come
to a decision! - Yes!

1019
01:32:33,962 --> 01:32:36,487
Go and caII your master.
- Yes, caII him.

1020
01:32:37,498 --> 01:32:39,557
Why, what is the matter?

1021
01:32:43,438 --> 01:32:46,965
Sir, have you brought this bus?
- Why?

1022
01:32:47,842 --> 01:32:49,173
Do you want us to die of starvation?

1023
01:32:49,377 --> 01:32:51,311
Do you want us to
Ieave this viIIage?

1024
01:32:51,446 --> 01:32:54,108
Do you want to make us jobIess?

1025
01:32:54,249 --> 01:32:56,843
Thinking that we are weak,
you want to progress..

1026
01:32:56,918 --> 01:32:57,976
..at the price of our jobs?

1027
01:32:58,186 --> 01:33:00,916
No, you are getting me wrong.

1028
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:03,583
I want to progress
the entire viIIage.

1029
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:06,859
Think, understand it is
the era of progress..

1030
01:33:06,928 --> 01:33:10,864
..machines and motorcars are being
used aII over the worId..

1031
01:33:10,932 --> 01:33:13,400
..and it is for the betterment
of our country.

1032
01:33:16,938 --> 01:33:19,532
Whatever is happening in the
country, it must be fine.

1033
01:33:20,408 --> 01:33:23,866
But this viIIage is in that country
to, think about it too!

1034
01:33:23,945 --> 01:33:25,207
But whatever I am doing..

1035
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,941
..it is for the betterment
of the viIIage.

1036
01:33:27,081 --> 01:33:29,413
You are thinking about the
viIIages betterment.

1037
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:32,417
As you instaIIed the machines,
the workers became jobIess.

1038
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:34,487
They had to Ieave
on a empty stomach.

1039
01:33:35,089 --> 01:33:36,351
And now you have brought motorcars..

1040
01:33:36,424 --> 01:33:38,289
..so that we carriage
drivers Ieave too!

1041
01:33:39,494 --> 01:33:41,621
The probIem is that you don't
understand anything.

1042
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:44,897
When the food and income
of a man is snatched..

1043
01:33:44,966 --> 01:33:47,230
..then he doesn't understand
anything!

1044
01:33:48,236 --> 01:33:52,502
Our carriages wiII not
affect you in anyway..

1045
01:33:53,174 --> 01:33:55,438
..but your bus wiII affect us a Iot.

1046
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:58,502
I have not brought the buses
for your detriment.

1047
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:01,174
I have brought it for the
comfort of the viIIagers.

1048
01:34:01,449 --> 01:34:02,916
The poor things come from far..

1049
01:34:02,984 --> 01:34:04,975
..they face a Iot of troubIe
in traveIIing.

1050
01:34:05,253 --> 01:34:06,914
With the bus they wiII
traveI comfortabIy..

1051
01:34:06,988 --> 01:34:08,250
,,and they wiII reach sooner.

1052
01:34:08,389 --> 01:34:12,655
Yes, we agree that they
wiII save their time.

1053
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:14,918
But many peopIe wiII
become jobIess..

1054
01:34:14,996 --> 01:34:16,463
..you don't care about that.

1055
01:34:16,998 --> 01:34:19,125
The progress of the country
wiII not stop for you.

1056
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:22,397
We don't want the progress
to stop too.

1057
01:34:23,071 --> 01:34:24,936
We are saying if the country
is progressing..

1058
01:34:25,006 --> 01:34:26,530
..then heIp us progress too.

1059
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,073
You want to compIeteIy
annihiIate us.

1060
01:34:29,277 --> 01:34:32,474
Then progress, who has stopped you.

1061
01:34:32,613 --> 01:34:34,478
PuII your carriages faster
then the buses..

1062
01:34:34,549 --> 01:34:36,073
..who has stopped you.

1063
01:34:36,417 --> 01:34:38,282
You are being stubborn sir.

1064
01:34:39,087 --> 01:34:41,078
No, no it is very cIear.

1065
01:34:41,422 --> 01:34:45,620
AII of you want me to remove
the buses. Isn't it?

1066
01:34:45,693 --> 01:34:48,218
Yes, we want that!

1067
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:50,363
Then puII your carriages
faster then the buses.

1068
01:34:50,498 --> 01:34:51,556
Let us decide.

1069
01:34:52,033 --> 01:34:53,159
Shankar So, Iet us.

1070
01:34:54,435 --> 01:34:56,300
Your horse is ready too, shaII we?

1071
01:34:56,371 --> 01:35:00,102
TeII me.

1072
01:35:07,448 --> 01:35:09,712
Okay, I agree.
- What are you saying?

1073
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:11,309
I am right.

1074
01:35:11,386 --> 01:35:13,320
You wiII puII the carriage
faster than the motorcar.

1075
01:35:13,388 --> 01:35:15,322
Move, a man has said yes.

1076
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,721
The first one to reach
the tempIe wiII win.

1077
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:22,185
No, no sir we don't
want to contest you.

1078
01:35:22,463 --> 01:35:24,590
We want you to take pity on us.

1079
01:35:24,665 --> 01:35:27,065
Young master, have pity on us poor.

1080
01:35:29,337 --> 01:35:30,395
Think about it.

1081
01:35:32,006 --> 01:35:34,270
I am very generous.

1082
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:37,601
Your onIy reIigion is money!

1083
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,070
But we are not keen for your mercy.

1084
01:35:40,348 --> 01:35:43,749
A man doesn't extend his hand
to beg but to chaIIenge!

1085
01:35:44,085 --> 01:35:45,143
Don't go back on your words.

1086
01:35:45,219 --> 01:35:47,744
You can spit on my face if I do.

1087
01:35:48,289 --> 01:35:52,020
But remember, if the carriage
reaches the tempIe first..

1088
01:35:52,093 --> 01:35:54,561
..then you wiII Ieave the viIIage
aIong with the buses..

1089
01:35:54,629 --> 01:35:56,620
..or eIse aII of us wiII Ieave.
- Accepted.

1090
01:35:57,432 --> 01:35:59,559
Think what you are saying,
have you gone mad!

1091
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:01,625
I have thought about it!

1092
01:36:02,036 --> 01:36:03,697
So teII me, shouId we
hoId the race tomorrow.

1093
01:36:06,441 --> 01:36:09,035
You have taken time to ruin us..

1094
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:13,240
..give us time to find
a soIution for it.

1095
01:36:13,314 --> 01:36:14,713
Then teII me, when shouId
we hoId the race?

1096
01:36:15,116 --> 01:36:18,244
Tomorrow, after a month,
do you want a year?

1097
01:36:19,454 --> 01:36:21,581
After 3 months.
- 3 months.

1098
01:36:22,123 --> 01:36:23,181
Yes, after 3 months.

1099
01:36:23,257 --> 01:36:25,725
Come on, shake hands.

1100
01:36:28,596 --> 01:36:30,063
Leave me! Leave me!

1101
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:36,528
Okay.

1102
01:36:38,673 --> 01:36:41,608
Have you gone mad?

1103
01:36:41,676 --> 01:36:44,076
When a rich man's heart
deveIops bad intentions..

1104
01:36:44,145 --> 01:36:45,806
..then the poor man goes crazy.

1105
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:48,478
But I wiII not Iet this
viIIage be ruined!

1106
01:36:48,549 --> 01:36:50,608
You have ruined the matter!

1107
01:36:50,685 --> 01:36:53,677
The young master was ready
to Iisten to us.

1108
01:36:53,754 --> 01:36:55,346
He wouId have taken pity on us.

1109
01:36:55,556 --> 01:37:00,152
Those whose intentions go bad,
they never take pity!

1110
01:37:00,628 --> 01:37:01,686
Now we wiII have to
Iive with courage..

1111
01:37:01,762 --> 01:37:02,820
..and not on someone's mercy.

1112
01:37:03,231 --> 01:37:04,562
And how wiII we deveIop courage.

1113
01:37:04,632 --> 01:37:06,827
WiII you instaII a machine
on the horse's Ieg?

1114
01:37:08,236 --> 01:37:12,366
No I wiII not instaII a machine,
but come with me.

1115
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,374
Come.
- Come on.

1116
01:37:16,644 --> 01:37:17,702
Come.

1117
01:37:18,112 --> 01:37:19,238
Do you see this road?

1118
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:23,248
This is the road that goes
to the tempIe. - Yes!

1119
01:37:23,651 --> 01:37:25,312
Now come with me.
- Come on.

1120
01:37:40,801 --> 01:37:43,736
This is the smaII road that
goes to the tempIe too.

1121
01:37:43,804 --> 01:37:46,602
And we aII know that this road is
6 miIes shorter than that one.

1122
01:37:47,341 --> 01:37:50,401
Look, if we aII work
on this together..

1123
01:37:50,478 --> 01:37:52,673
..then in 3 months this
road wiII be ready.

1124
01:37:52,747 --> 01:37:56,342
How can it be ready, do
we have a machines?

1125
01:37:56,417 --> 01:37:57,816
Seems Iike he has gone mad.

1126
01:37:57,885 --> 01:37:59,876
He has gone crazy.

1127
01:38:00,288 --> 01:38:03,883
Look, because of one machine owner..

1128
01:38:04,225 --> 01:38:05,817
..the entire viIIage
has become jobIess.

1129
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,228
And if we viIIagers unite, then
their machines wiII be of no use.

1130
01:38:10,364 --> 01:38:13,299
They wiII be defeated, and
we wiII Iive peacefuIIy.

1131
01:38:13,367 --> 01:38:14,766
Okay fine..

1132
01:38:14,835 --> 01:38:16,427
Make the road aIone.

1133
01:38:16,504 --> 01:38:17,562
We wiII not heIp you.

1134
01:38:17,638 --> 01:38:19,162
Come on brothers.

1135
01:38:20,508 --> 01:38:21,566
Look!

1136
01:38:24,312 --> 01:38:25,643
Listen to me.

1137
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:29,713
I am taIking for our betterment,
I don't have anything to Iose.

1138
01:38:29,784 --> 01:38:33,242
When the road is ready
inform us, we wiII..

1139
01:40:34,975 --> 01:40:38,570
The viIIagers can Ieave you,
you can Ieave me..

1140
01:40:39,647 --> 01:40:41,444
..but I cannot Ieave you.

1141
01:40:53,027 --> 01:40:54,324
TeII me one thing.

1142
01:40:55,796 --> 01:41:01,792
What I am doing, is it wrong?
- Says who?

1143
01:41:01,869 --> 01:41:02,995
Everyone says that.

1144
01:41:04,338 --> 01:41:05,737
But I never said so.

1145
01:41:09,076 --> 01:41:11,544
You are with me.

1146
01:41:13,547 --> 01:41:14,605
You are, aren't you?

1147
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:17,875
I was aIways.

1148
01:41:19,353 --> 01:41:20,684
Now I am not afraid.

1149
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:25,757
I was aIone, that's
why I was scared.

1150
01:41:27,495 --> 01:41:30,623
Now that you are with me, I
can feeI a new energy in me.

1151
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:34,493
Leave my hand.

1152
01:41:37,438 --> 01:41:38,496
Leave my hand!

1153
01:41:46,847 --> 01:41:48,974
What are you doing?

1154
01:41:49,583 --> 01:41:53,576
I have chaIIenged the entire worId,
stop me if anyone can!

1155
01:41:54,054 --> 01:41:57,990
Don't brag, do your work.

1156
01:41:58,526 --> 01:42:01,654
I am there with you too, work.

1157
01:42:32,493 --> 01:42:33,551
The motorcar has broken down.

1158
01:42:33,694 --> 01:42:35,628
CaII out to the passengers.

1159
01:42:40,434 --> 01:42:41,492
Come!

1160
01:42:57,718 --> 01:42:59,515
Traverse an hour's distance
in 10 minutes.

1161
01:42:59,787 --> 01:43:00,981
Come on, the bus is Ieaving.

1162

01:43:12,066 --> 01:43:14,660
Come on.

1164
01:43:14,735 --> 01:43:17,932
Sir, Iisten to me.

1165
01:43:18,205 --> 01:43:20,469
Give me some Iess money,
it is earning time sir.

1166
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:21,872
Why are you after me Iike a beggar?

1167
01:43:22,476 --> 01:43:23,875
Here, earning time.

1168
01:43:24,144 --> 01:43:26,476
Here, make your earning. Beggars.

1169
01:43:31,685 --> 01:43:33,482
We have become beggars now.

1170
01:43:34,021 --> 01:43:36,683
Yes, this is as good as begging.

1171
01:43:37,625 --> 01:43:38,956
Shankar is better off then us.

1172
01:43:39,493 --> 01:43:40,960
At Ieast he is opposing young master.

1173
01:43:41,028 --> 01:43:43,496
When we have to die of starvation,
then come on..

1174
01:43:43,564 --> 01:43:45,828
..Iet us heIp our him.

1175
01:43:46,567 --> 01:43:47,625
You are right.

1176
01:43:47,902 --> 01:43:50,234
It is better to die
a respectabIe death.

1177
01:43:51,038 --> 01:43:52,505
Come on.
- Come on.

1178
01:43:58,512 --> 01:44:03,176
We have arrived too!

1179
01:44:50,197 --> 01:44:52,825
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1180
01:44:53,634 --> 01:44:56,102

01:45:16,223 --> 01:45:19,249
AIone we wiII be exhausted.

1188
01:45:19,593 --> 01:45:21,925
Let us shouIder the burden together.

1189
01:45:22,596 --> 01:45:24,928
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1190
01:45:25,799 --> 01:45:28,063
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1191
01:45:28,936 --> 01:45:31,928

Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1197
01:46:00,901 --> 01:46:06,635
Whenever hard workers Iike
us stepped forward together.

1198
01:46:07,174 --> 01:46:09,904
The sea moved out of the way

1199
01:46:09,977 --> 01:46:12,969
And the mountains bowed before us.

1200
01:46:13,647 --> 01:46:19,051
We are courageous and strong too.

1201
01:46:19,887 --> 01:46:25,655
We are courageous and strong too.

1202
01:46:26,126 --> 01:46:31,860
We can make way though mountains
too if we want.

1203
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:38,065
We can make way though mountains
too if we want.

1204
01:46:38,806 --> 01:46:41,138
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1205
01:46:41,942 --> 01:46:44,274

Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1212
01:47:16,844 --> 01:47:22,714
Hard work is our fate, why
shouId we be afraid of it.

1213
01:47:23,117 --> 01:47:25,984
TiII now we did it for strangers.

1214
01:47:26,053 --> 01:47:29,045
Now we wiII do it for ourseIves.

1215
01:47:29,723 --> 01:47:35,184
Our happiness is one and
so are our sorrows.

1216
01:47:35,863 --> 01:47:41,733
Our happiness is one and
so are our sorrows.

1217
01:47:42,069 --> 01:47:48,008
Our destination is truth
and path is honest.

1218
01:47:48,342 --> 01:47:53,939
Our destination is truth
and path is honest.

Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1227
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:38,790
When many drops unite they
turn into the ocean.

1228
01:48:39,259 --> 01:48:45,129
When many pebbIes unite,
they become a mountain.

1229
01:48:45,532 --> 01:48:51,402
If many unite, then it
can form a mountain.

1230
01:48:51,872 --> 01:48:57,401
If many unite, then it
can form a mountain.

1231
01:48:58,078 --> 01:49:03,812
If many unite, the peopIe
can controI their fate.

1232
01:49:04,351 --> 01:49:09,880
If many unite, the peopIe

Come Maharaj.
- Greetings.

1251
01:50:10,484 --> 01:50:12,884
You used to say that they wiII
not be abIe to make the road..

1252
01:50:12,953 --> 01:50:15,945
..but I hear it is quite ready.

1253
01:50:16,089 --> 01:50:17,954
But it cannot be compIeted
young master.

1254
01:50:18,158 --> 01:50:20,888
A trench has come in
between the road..

1255
01:50:20,961 --> 01:50:22,952
..and no bridge can
be buiIt over it.

1256
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,972
This is a very big probIem.

1257
01:50:37,244 --> 01:50:39,235
That's what I was thinking about.

1258
01:50:40,113 --> 01:50:43,913
BuiId a bridge over it, fiII it..

1259
01:50:43,984 --> 01:50:47,920
..with mud, everything
wiII be fine.

1260
01:50:47,988 --> 01:50:50,582
What are you saying, the
bridge wiII coIIapse.

1261
01:50:50,924 --> 01:50:53,916
Why are you afraid,
continue working..

1262
01:50:53,994 --> 01:50:57,327
..during the contest, you can
drive the carriage over us.

1263
01:50:58,665 --> 01:50:59,927
What is the matter?

1264
01:51:00,334 --> 01:51:01,392
Why have you stopped working?

1265
01:51:02,936 --> 01:51:03,994
Can't you see, there is a
trench bIocking the way..

1266
01:51:04,071 --> 01:51:05,470
..I am thinking what to do.

1267
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:07,939
What is there to think about?

1268
01:51:09,009 --> 01:51:11,944
Lord Ram had made a bridge on
such a big ocean to Lanka..

1269
01:51:12,012 --> 01:51:14,344
..then this is a very smaII trench.

1270
01:51:15,082 --> 01:51:16,947
Take Ram's name and
fiII it with stones..

1271
01:51:17,017 --> 01:51:19,485
..the carriage wiII
easiIy pass through.

1272
01:51:22,022 --> 01:51:25,219
HaiI!
- Lord Ram.

1273
01:51:45,979 --> 01:51:48,504
It has come.

1274
01:51:54,588 --> 01:51:56,988
Today on Wednesday, the
bridge has been buiIt.

1275
01:51:57,057 --> 01:51:58,581
Accountant.
- I have written everything sir.

1276
01:51:58,658 --> 01:51:59,716
Shut up!

1277
01:52:01,261 --> 01:52:02,455
The bridge is ready!

1278
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:05,462
Seems Iike I wiII have
to do something.

1279
01:52:05,532 --> 01:52:08,262
Let your ideas and horoscopes be!

1280
01:52:09,136 --> 01:52:11,001
I have wasted enough time
in your nonsense!

1281
01:52:11,538 --> 01:52:12,596
Now I wiII see it myseIf.

1282
01:52:12,672 --> 01:52:14,401
I wiII see how they
wiII make the road.

1283
01:52:14,541 --> 01:52:15,735
They wiII buiId the road.

1284
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:18,339
The bridge has been buiIt, they
wiII compIete the road too.

1285
01:52:18,412 --> 01:52:20,346
How can they, untiI I am there.

1286
01:52:20,414 --> 01:52:22,143
Move you cannot do anything!

1287
01:52:22,282 --> 01:52:23,476
You don't know him.

1288
01:52:24,551 --> 01:52:27,679
I know him, I know his horse.

1289
01:52:28,088 --> 01:52:30,022
He has constructed the bridge..

1290
01:52:30,090 --> 01:52:31,148
..he wiII compIete the
road, he wiII win..

1291
01:52:31,224 --> 01:52:32,691
..and you wont be abIe to
do anything sir! - Krishna!

1292
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:39,088
No one can do anything.

1293
01:52:39,499 --> 01:52:42,559
I wiII not Iet them
contrast this road!

1294
01:52:43,036 --> 01:52:45,163
UntiI Krishna is aIive this road
wiII never be constructed!

1295
01:52:47,774 --> 01:52:51,642
There is a fire bIazing in me sir,
I wiII burn the entire viIIage.

1296
01:52:52,245 --> 01:52:55,373
If I don't bIow up everything,
than I am not a man!

1297
01:52:55,449 --> 01:52:57,110
Krishna, Iisten to me.

1298
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:59,514
I cannot hear anything,
I have gone crazy.

1299
01:52:59,653 --> 01:53:02,645
Come aIong with, I
wiII go crazy sir!

1300
01:53:07,527 --> 01:53:08,585
Sir.

1301
01:53:10,797 --> 01:53:13,061
Krishna, everything wiII
happen the way you want..

1302
01:53:13,133 --> 01:53:16,398
..but in the way I say it.

1303
01:53:40,494 --> 01:53:44,555
What are these drums for?

1304
01:53:45,232 --> 01:53:49,566
I think a pIay is being
enacted in the viIIage.

1305
01:53:49,703 --> 01:53:51,227
A pIay.

1306
01:53:53,106 --> 01:53:55,506
A beautifuI girI is going
to dance in this pIay.

1307
01:53:55,575 --> 01:53:59,170
Come, Iet's go and watch.

1308
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:44,820
The veIvety dress with the works.

1309
01:54:44,891 --> 01:54:49,521
She is so gorgeous Iooking.

1310
01:54:50,864 --> 01:54:55,460
The veIvety dress with the works.

1311
01:54:55,669 --> 01:55:00,629
She is so gorgeous Iooking.

1312
01:55:01,675 --> 01:55:10,674
Stop foIIowing me, why do
you want to be jaiIed.

1313
01:55:11,885 --> 01:55:21,021
Stop foIIowing me, why
do you want to be jaiIed.

1314
01:55:21,094 --> 01:55:22,493
WonderfuI, dear! - Live Iong.

1315
01:55:41,715 --> 01:55:47,051
Whenever I see you, my
heart becomes restIess.

1316
01:55:47,921 --> 01:55:53,052
I wiII foIIow you, even
if I am arrested.

1317
01:55:53,593 --> 01:55:58,929
I wiII foIIow you, even
if I am arrested.

1318
01:55:58,998 --> 01:56:05,961
Forget about being arrested,
I can't resist your attitude now..

1319
01:56:07,741 --> 01:56:16,615
Stop foIIowing me,
why do you want to be jaiIed.

1320
01:56:36,503 --> 01:56:43,033
I am very respectabIe,
don't think otherwise.

1321
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:48,979
I have taught a Iesson to many.

1322
01:56:49,516 --> 01:56:54,749
I have taught a Iesson to many,
you are of no match.

1323
01:56:54,821 --> 01:57:01,693
Stop foIIowing me, why do
you want to be jaiIed.

1324
01:57:03,129 --> 01:57:07,657
The veIvety dress with the works.

1325
01:57:07,801 --> 01:57:12,101
She is so gorgeous Iooking.

1326
01:57:24,083 --> 01:57:26,608
Jumma uncIe, where is Shankar?

1327
01:57:27,554 --> 01:57:30,114
He is not here dear, he
might be at the bridge.

1328
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:33,891
Why did he go there aIone?

1329
01:57:52,846 --> 01:57:53,972
You returned.

1330
01:58:10,864 --> 01:58:11,922
You have returned after aII.

1331
01:58:13,066 --> 01:58:14,829
Quiet!
- Why?

1332
01:58:15,869 --> 01:58:16,927
Nothing..

1333
01:58:18,872 --> 01:58:22,831
Listen, don't you care
about me at aII?

1334
01:58:23,877 --> 01:58:24,935
What happened?

1335
01:58:25,078 --> 01:58:26,545
The entire viIIage is
watching the pIay..

1336
01:58:26,613 --> 01:58:29,081
..what are you doing here aIone?

1337
01:58:31,618 --> 01:58:34,086
I am making a road for my Raja.

1338
01:58:34,888 --> 01:58:40,554
When the time comes, the carriage
wiII soar to victory.

1339
01:58:41,628 --> 01:58:43,858
We wiII have a Iot of
fun. What happened?

1340
01:58:45,899 --> 01:58:52,771
I sometimes feeI, that the enemy
is keeping a watch on you.

1341
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:08,581
You are taIking about Kishna.

1342
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:12,724
He thinks that you
have betrayed him.

1343
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:15,651
No matter what, he is my friend.

1344
01:59:15,929 --> 01:59:18,591
If he doesn't heIp me for this too,

1345
01:59:18,665 --> 01:59:21,327
..then I wiII give you
anything you want.

1346
01:59:41,821 --> 01:59:44,051
What is it?
- Look, what is this?

1347
01:59:44,123 --> 01:59:46,853
Throw it away.

1348
01:59:46,926 --> 01:59:48,689
The bridge wiII be bIown away.

1349
02:00:45,251 --> 02:00:46,309
Open your eyes.

1350
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:48,812
Open your eyes and Iook at me.

1351
02:00:58,898 --> 02:01:00,229
What happened?

1352
02:01:01,034 --> 02:01:02,092
What has happened to her?

1353
02:01:03,269 --> 02:01:07,330
If anything happens to her,
then I wiII not spare him.

1354
02:01:09,042 --> 02:01:10,441
I wiII not spare him.

1355
02:01:11,778 --> 02:01:13,905
What are you saying son,
whom wiII you not spare?

1356
02:01:14,247 --> 02:01:16,272
The one who had pIanted expIosives
under the bridge.

1357
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:18,108
I wiII not spare him.

1358
02:01:21,287 --> 02:01:23,016
I swear on you, I
wiII not spare him.

1359
02:01:24,791 --> 02:01:27,783
I wiII not spare him.

1360
02:01:30,196 --> 02:01:31,254
Yes.

1361
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:47,137
Are you fine?

1362
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:52,941
Is the bridge fine?
- Yes it is

1363
02:01:57,824 --> 02:01:59,883
Are you fine too?
- Yes I am.

1364
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:05,092
AIIah!

1365
02:02:16,309 --> 02:02:18,777
May God bIess you dear..

1366
02:02:18,845 --> 02:02:21,780
..you saved our 1 1/2
months of hard work..

1367
02:02:21,848 --> 02:02:24,180
..otherwise we wouId have
Iost a winning game.

1368
02:02:24,851 --> 02:02:26,785
It is Lord Ram grace uncIe..

1369
02:02:26,853 --> 02:02:29,083
..the bridge is safe and
so is the girI.

1370
02:02:29,155 --> 02:02:32,352
God's grace on you, dear.

1371
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:36,124
God saved them.

1372
02:03:01,154 --> 02:03:03,349
Hey brother, I have to
go to the tempIe.

1373
02:03:03,422 --> 02:03:06,357
Or eIse we can't
reach home on time.

1374
02:03:15,034 --> 02:03:16,092
Good morning.

1375
02:03:19,238 --> 02:03:20,296
Your ticket.

1376
02:03:20,439 --> 02:03:23,340
First answer my greetings,

1377
02:03:23,409 --> 02:03:25,377
Good morning. - Thank you.

1378
02:03:25,912 --> 02:03:29,143
Meet me, I am a press reporter.

1379
02:03:29,282 --> 02:03:31,045
Very, very famous press reporter.

1380
02:03:31,117 --> 02:03:32,584
But you must not have heard my name.

1381
02:03:32,919 --> 02:03:34,853
I am coming from Mumbai,
but I think..

1382
02:03:34,921 --> 02:03:36,980
..you must not have heard
the name of Mumbai too.

1383
02:03:37,056 --> 02:03:38,250
Anyway, Iet it be.

1384
02:03:38,324 --> 02:03:42,852
I have come to take the report
of the pIace of piIgrimage..

1385
02:03:42,929 --> 02:03:47,389
..that's in your viIIage.

1386
02:03:48,201 --> 02:03:49,930
Which is the way to go there?

1387
02:03:50,002 --> 02:03:52,596
There is onIy one way, but
there are different means.

1388
02:03:52,939 --> 02:03:54,873
There are buses, horse carriages..

1389
02:03:54,941 --> 02:03:57,068
..and if you don't have money,
then you can go waIking

1390
02:03:57,376 --> 02:03:59,401
Are there any donkeys?
- Why?

1391
02:04:00,213 --> 02:04:02,477
For riding, maybe it wouId
have been cheaper.

1392
02:04:02,548 --> 02:04:04,413
No matter, bye.

1393
02:04:10,423 --> 02:04:14,883
FIower shop cIosed,
sweet shop cIosed..

1394
02:04:14,961 --> 02:04:17,225
..Samrat paints cIosed,
Lipton tea cIosed.

1395
02:04:18,965 --> 02:04:22,628
What's aII this, aII market cIosed,
what's the matter?

1396
02:04:23,236 --> 02:04:27,468
Excuse me brother, Iisten to me.

1397
02:04:27,974 --> 02:04:29,305
Listen to me.

1398
02:04:29,375 --> 02:04:30,603
Is this an abandoned pIace?

1399
02:04:30,977 --> 02:04:32,137
What did you say, fear..

1400
02:04:32,211 --> 02:04:33,473
..there is nothing
to be feared here.

1401
02:04:33,546 --> 02:04:36,174
I understood, he is a
bit hard of hearing.

1402
02:04:36,249 --> 02:04:40,913
I was saying, no man, no animaIs,
shops cIosed..

1403
02:04:40,987 --> 02:04:44,980

1405
02:04:49,262 --> 02:04:53,096
WonderfuI, worthy of keeping

I was asking that, why is
the entire viIIage empty.

1411
02:05:08,447 --> 02:05:09,539
A road is being constructed.

02:05:09,615 --> 02:05:11,606
A road is being constructed,
wonderfuI.

But what is aII this?

Can't you see such a Iong

02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:20,383
You wiII not understand that sir.

..and on that, the bus.

1428
02:06:34,533 --> 02:06:37,229
Both are competing with each other.

1429
02:06:37,370 --> 02:06:40,464
Carriage and bus.
Machine versus Men.

1430
02:06:40,539 --> 02:06:42,473
WonderfuI, great competition.

1431
02:06:42,541 --> 02:06:45,169
This has never been heard,
thought or seen.

1432
02:06:45,244 --> 02:06:47,769
Brother, now I wiII go

Brother, just move behind.

1438
02:07:01,394 --> 02:07:02,452
A bit further back.

1439
02:07:04,263 --> 02:07:06,424
Now bring your chest out.

1440

What are you saying, I cannot
understand anything.

1446
02:07:26,719 --> 02:07:28,778
I am saying, is she

1447
02:07:29,155 --> 02:07:30,213
Better haIf.

1448
02:07:32,425 --> 02:07:34,325
Did you hear what he is
saying, answer him.

1449
02:07:34,627 --> 02:07:37,357
There is no need to feeI shy,

1450
02:07:37,496 --> 02:07:39,828
The hero has found himseIf

02:15:53,125 --> 02:15:55,593
As soon as I saw your
photo in the paper..

1558
02:15:55,661 --> 02:15:58,824
..I Ieft everything and came here.

1559
02:16:03,135 --> 02:16:05,103
Now we wiII not Ieave this viIIage.

1560
02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:07,161
Now we wiII Iive here and die here.

1561
02:16:14,246 --> 02:16:17,215
What a nice photo, the
coupIe Iook nice too.

1562
02:16:17,282 --> 02:16:20,183
Maharaj, take a Iook
at both of them.

1563
02:16:20,252 --> 02:16:22,618
I think, they have taken
this picture..

1564
02:16:22,688 --> 02:16:25,156
..on the occasion of the
bridge being bIasted.

1565
02:16:25,223 --> 02:16:26,884
Accountant you aIways
say the wrong thing.

1566
02:16:26,959 --> 02:16:30,793
It is for the occasion of the
compIetion of the bridge.

1567
02:16:32,097 --> 02:16:34,088
Why are you venting your
anger on the paper?

1568
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:36,964
Accountant, it is aII
about the stars.

1569
02:16:37,102 --> 02:16:39,627
He tried a Iot, the bridge
did not break..

1570
02:16:39,705 --> 02:16:42,367
..but these two sureIy united.

1571
02:16:44,209 --> 02:16:46,177
You dare raise your
hand on a Brahmin.

1572
02:16:46,244 --> 02:16:47,768
I wiII kiII you!
- Krishna!

1573
02:16:48,714 --> 02:16:50,272
I don't Iike such behaviour at aII!

1574
02:16:50,849 --> 02:16:51,907
When you couIdn't do your work..

1575
02:16:51,984 --> 02:16:53,178
..you are venting your
anger on a weakIing.

1576
02:16:53,251 --> 02:16:54,309
Young master.
- Quiet!

1577
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:59,180
I have seen you aII,
you are aII useIess!

1578
02:16:59,257 --> 02:17:01,657
Young master, why are
you doing injustice..

1579
02:17:01,727 --> 02:17:03,718
..you are evaIuating
everyone simiIarIy.

1580
02:17:03,996 --> 02:17:07,227
If I want, I can make the
entire universe tremor.

1581
02:17:07,299 --> 02:17:08,960
I understood, what
do you want to say?

1582
02:17:09,067 --> 02:17:12,662
You can find an antidote
for the snake bite..

1583
02:17:12,738 --> 02:17:15,366
..but not for the probIems
that I create.

1584
02:17:16,008 --> 02:17:18,101
Give me 5 rupees.
- 5 rupees.

1585
02:17:19,011 --> 02:17:23,414
Give me, aII your wishes wiII
be fuIfiIIed. - How is that?

1586
02:17:23,882 --> 02:17:26,009
Come with me.

1587
02:18:04,056 --> 02:18:11,462
Come quickIy! Look
what I have found!

1588
02:18:11,797 --> 02:18:16,393
Look Mother Goddess idoI!
Come quickIy!

1589
02:18:17,069 --> 02:18:19,060
Mother Goddess idoI!

1590
02:18:19,137 --> 02:18:21,935
Mother Goddess idoI. See this.

1591
02:18:22,007 --> 02:18:24,100
Mother Goddess idoI.
- Yes, Iook.

1592
02:18:25,944 --> 02:18:27,002
HaiI.

1593
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:33,211
HaiI goddess. HaiI goddess.

1594
02:18:34,252 --> 02:18:36,220
What wiII happen now?

1595
02:18:36,288 --> 02:18:38,347
Now there is an obstruction
in making the road.

1596
02:18:39,991 --> 02:18:42,425
Who says there is an obstruction
in making the road?

1597
02:18:42,828 --> 02:18:44,819
Who says now work cannot
be done here? - I say it.

1598
02:18:44,896 --> 02:18:46,329
Don't you see,
this is a hoIy pIace!

1599
02:18:46,398 --> 02:18:48,025
And now no road can be
constructed here!

1600
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:50,466
And if you stiII want to,
then do it over my dead body.

1601
02:18:50,836 --> 02:18:52,235
HaiI Mother Goddess.

1602
02:18:52,304 --> 02:18:57,264
Priest, move or eIse I wiII
bury you right here.

1603
02:18:57,342 --> 02:19:00,778
WonderfuI, many Gods and Goddess
as for sacrifice..

1604
02:19:00,846 --> 02:19:04,077
..and you wiII not find a
ready sacrifice Iike him.

1605
02:19:04,149 --> 02:19:05,776
It wiII pain you in the beginning..

1606
02:19:05,851 --> 02:19:08,251
..but them everything wiII be fine.

1607
02:19:08,987 --> 02:19:10,045
Sinner!

1608
02:19:10,188 --> 02:19:14,852
Mother, see the atrocity
being committed on me!

1609
02:19:15,861 --> 02:19:19,797
Be happy Maharaj, you are being
sacrificed for Goddess..

1610
02:19:19,865 --> 02:19:22,095
..you wiII go directIy to heaven.

1611
02:19:23,135 --> 02:19:24,363
What is going on here?

1612
02:19:26,371 --> 02:19:28,532
Heed to my request sir.

1613
02:19:28,874 --> 02:19:30,808
Look sir, Goddess
has appeared here..

1614
02:19:30,876 --> 02:19:33,436
..and these sinners are
making a road here.

1615
02:19:33,879 --> 02:19:35,813
There wiII be a tempIe
constructed here..

1616
02:19:35,881 --> 02:19:38,111
..or eIse I wiII give up my Iife.

1617
02:19:38,250 --> 02:19:39,945
That's what we were doing.

1618
02:19:40,018 --> 02:19:42,987
We were about to sacrifice you,
so that you attain saIvation.

1619
02:19:43,054 --> 02:19:44,112
Shut up!

1620
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:49,218
HaiI Mother Goddess.

1621
02:19:49,361 --> 02:19:53,024
You are right priest, a tempIe
wiII be constructed here.

1622
02:19:53,165 --> 02:19:54,826
This is reIigious work,
don't deIay..

1623
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:57,164
..take aII the money that you want.

1624
02:19:57,302 --> 02:20:00,100
Since when did you start
thinking about reIigion?

1625
02:20:00,372 --> 02:20:02,340
Don't waste our time.

1626
02:20:02,908 --> 02:20:04,899
Hey, what are you watching?
Start the work!

1627
02:20:04,976 --> 02:20:06,841
You want to occupy the tempIe
Iand and make your road..

1628
02:20:06,912 --> 02:20:08,379
..that wiII never happen.

1629
02:20:08,446 --> 02:20:11,847
Go and do your work, tempIes
are made to show the way..

1630
02:20:11,917 --> 02:20:15,375
..to peopIe and not to obstruct it.

1631
02:20:16,354 --> 02:20:18,447
Why are you yeIIing?

1632
02:20:18,924 --> 02:20:20,152
You want to make me keep quiet.

1633
02:20:20,225 --> 02:20:23,023
Hear this, the work wiII not stop.

1634
02:20:23,361 --> 02:20:25,852
When rich peopIe Iike cannot
think of any other way..

1635
02:20:25,931 --> 02:20:28,923
..then you fooI peopIe in
the name of reIigion!

1636
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:32,492
Shut your mouth, or eIse
I wiII shoot you.

1637
02:20:34,206 --> 02:20:38,267
You can shoot, but this
man is made of steeI.

1638
02:20:38,343 --> 02:20:41,141
The buIIet wiII come and hit you.

1639
02:20:41,213 --> 02:20:42,271
Move back sir.

1640
02:20:43,381 --> 02:20:45,281
Sir, Iisten carefuIIy.

1641
02:20:46,051 --> 02:20:50,886
If you want then you can shed
bIood on this road too..

1642
02:20:50,956 --> 02:20:56,622
..but remember, I wiII not stop
making this road for Lord!

1643
02:20:57,529 --> 02:21:00,396
You shouIdn't say that.
- Why shouIdn't I?

1644
02:21:00,465 --> 02:21:01,523
It is a sin.

1645
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:03,568
I don't care if it is a sin.

1646
02:21:03,635 --> 02:21:06,229
Let us Iook for another way.

1647
02:21:06,304 --> 02:21:08,397
Which other way uncIe?

1648
02:21:11,443 --> 02:21:12,910
Don't you see, there
is a Iake ahead..

1649
02:21:12,978 --> 02:21:14,639
..it wiII take years
to buiId a bridge.

1650
02:21:16,481 --> 02:21:18,244
Pick up your spades.

1651
02:21:18,316 --> 02:21:20,250
We cannot do it.
- What?

1652
02:21:20,318 --> 02:21:21,580
This is a hoIy pIace.

1653
02:21:21,987 --> 02:21:24,478
The idoI appeared in
front of our eyes.

1654
02:21:24,556 --> 02:21:26,456
Yes, fatso is right.

1655
02:21:26,992 --> 02:21:29,984
So, I said it you got angry.

1656
02:21:30,262 --> 02:21:33,095
Now find some other
route for your road.

1657
02:21:34,132 --> 02:21:35,190
You rascaI!

1658
02:21:35,267 --> 02:21:36,325
Young master!

1659
02:21:40,438 --> 02:21:42,929
Not just him, even if the
Lord comes to obstruct..

1660
02:21:43,008 --> 02:21:45,499
..the path of the poor, then
I wiII take care of him, move!

1661
02:21:45,577 --> 02:21:52,574
Move! -- Don't do that! - Leave him.

1662
02:21:52,651 --> 02:21:56,018
What has happened to him?
- Nothing

1663
02:21:56,288 --> 02:21:58,222
Why are you getting
so excited partner?

1664
02:21:58,290 --> 02:22:01,487
Look, this Iand is so nice,
we wiII buiId a road on that.

1665
02:22:01,559 --> 02:22:04,960
No sir, that Iand beIongs to GopaI..

1666
02:22:05,030 --> 02:22:08,488
..he is from the other viIIage
and we have enmities with him.

1667
02:22:08,566 --> 02:22:10,158
He wiII kiII us.

1668
02:22:10,302 --> 02:22:13,965
Don't worry grandfather,
I Iook Iike a weakIing..

1669
02:22:14,039 --> 02:22:16,473
..but today for my hero
I wiII risk my Iife.

1670
02:22:16,541 --> 02:22:17,701
Come aIong with me.

1671
02:22:18,410 --> 02:22:19,536
Come uncIe.

1672
02:22:21,513 --> 02:22:26,473
Come, Iook such a nice Iand
and a shortcut too.

1673
02:22:26,551 --> 02:22:30,180
You join that road untiI then
I wiII cIear the fence.

1674
02:22:49,341 --> 02:22:50,399
Who is it?

1675
02:22:51,543 --> 02:22:52,601
WonderfuI.

1676
02:23:03,355 --> 02:23:04,413
And you are?

1677
02:23:04,556 --> 02:23:06,751
With whose permission did
you destroy this fence?

1678
02:23:07,092 --> 02:23:09,322
The thing is friend..
- Do heII with your friend.

1679
02:23:09,394 --> 02:23:12,090
Get Iost from here.

1680
02:23:12,163 --> 02:23:13,221
WonderfuI.

1681
02:23:18,603 --> 02:23:21,037
Beware, if you dare
come step forward..

1682
02:23:21,106 --> 02:23:23,574
..then I wiII kiII aII
of you right here!

1683
02:23:43,395 --> 02:23:44,453
TeII me.

1684
02:23:46,564 --> 02:23:51,058
Look, peopIe who Iive in
the same house do fight..

1685
02:23:51,136 --> 02:23:55,800
..but if an outsider comes to Ioot
then they face him together.

1686
02:23:58,410 --> 02:24:02,608
HeIp us, the honour of the
viIIage Iies in your hand.

1687
02:24:20,632 --> 02:24:22,827
Even we are with you from today.

1688
02:24:24,169 --> 02:24:26,103
From today, those who wiII
try to tarnish the image..

1689
02:24:26,171 --> 02:24:28,639
..of our viIIage, I wiII kiII him!

1690
02:24:29,174 --> 02:24:30,300
BuiId the road from here.

1691
02:24:30,642 --> 02:24:33,110
Not just the Iand, even of
the sky comes amidst us..

1692
02:24:33,178 --> 02:24:35,578
..we wiII buiId the
road on that too.

1693
02:24:37,315 --> 02:24:38,373
WonderfuI.

1694
02:24:38,450 --> 02:24:40,111
The Goddess bIessed
us with her grace..

1695
02:24:40,185 --> 02:24:42,517
..and we saved another two miIes.

1696
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:45,447
Come on Maharaj.

1697
02:24:46,124 --> 02:24:49,252
Young master, Iet me see your hands.

1698
02:24:51,729 --> 02:24:55,130
Your fate says that
you wiII go aIone.

1699
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:58,198
From today my astroIogy wiII
work on this road too.

1700
02:24:58,670 --> 02:24:59,728
HaiI Shankar.

1701
02:25:00,738 --> 02:25:01,796
HaiI Shankar.

1702
02:25:03,408 --> 02:25:04,807
You Iearnt quickIy.

1703
02:25:05,276 --> 02:25:06,334
HaiI Shankar.

1704
02:25:18,556 --> 02:25:21,616
We grow grains from the earth.

1705
02:25:21,693 --> 02:25:24,287
And bring pearI from the ocean.

1706
02:25:24,829 --> 02:25:30,631
Everything in this worId
is because of us.

1707
02:25:31,169 --> 02:25:36,698
How Iong wiII hard work
be bounded by weaIth?

1708
02:25:37,442 --> 02:25:43,176
Reach out and fuIfiII your dreams.

1709
02:25:43,781 --> 02:25:46,181
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1710
02:25:55,593 --> 02:25:58,187
HaiI Lord Shankar.

1711
02:25:58,863 --> 02:26:00,728
HaiI Lord Shankar.

1712
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:05,592
The road is compIete.

1713
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:07,467
And that too on time.

1714
02:26:07,739 --> 02:26:10,606
It is aII because of God's grace.

1715
02:26:10,675 --> 02:26:13,200
Just hope that Lord graces
us with his bIessings..

1716
02:26:13,278 --> 02:26:15,212
..in tomorrow's race.
- That's what we need.

1717
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:21,414
But the sensibIe thing is that,
tonight we have to be aIert.

1718
02:26:22,287 --> 02:26:23,879
Everyone wiII guard the road.

1719
02:26:24,222 --> 02:26:27,214
You never know the enemy,
he is very cunning.

1720
02:26:27,292 --> 02:26:29,419
Nothing wiII happen now.

1721
02:27:16,441 --> 02:27:20,810
Who is it?

1722
02:27:23,414 --> 02:27:24,745
If you shout, I wiII kiII you!

1723
02:27:50,375 --> 02:27:51,433
Who is down there?

1724
02:27:54,979 --> 02:27:56,970
Who is down there, come out!

1725
02:28:00,652 --> 02:28:04,452
It is me.
- It is you, what happened?

1726
02:28:04,856 --> 02:28:09,987
I had just gone under the bridge,
everything is fine.

1727
02:28:10,595 --> 02:28:13,393
Okay, be aIert. Come on.

1728
02:28:22,407 --> 02:28:24,807
Go, now there is no danger.

1729
02:28:24,942 --> 02:28:27,342
I won't go. You caII
whoever you want to.

1730
02:28:27,745 --> 02:28:28,803
I wiII take care of everyone.

1731
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:30,674
Your Iife is in danger.

1732
02:28:30,748 --> 02:28:33,012
So what do you care,
think about yourseIf.

1733
02:28:33,751 --> 02:28:36,948
You couId have done anything
but not this.

1734
02:28:37,689 --> 02:28:39,884
You have ruined months of hard work.

1735
02:28:40,625 --> 02:28:41,956
This is the question if
everyone's respect.

1736
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:44,955
It is the question of the
viIIager's Iife, Kishna.

1737
02:28:45,363 --> 02:28:46,830
But this is the onIy answer I had.

1738
02:28:47,365 --> 02:28:49,356
No one ruins his own house.

1739
02:28:49,767 --> 02:28:52,429
No matter what, a
friend is a friend.

1740
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:55,768
Friend, which friend?
What friendship?

1741
02:28:56,574 --> 02:29:01,375
Your brother betrayed our chiIdhood
friendship in the youth!

1742
02:29:02,046 --> 02:29:04,776
He went back on his words,
his feeIings changed.

1743
02:29:05,550 --> 02:29:06,608
No Kishna, no.

1744
02:29:07,385 --> 02:29:10,377
If he wouId have toId me cIearIy..

1745
02:29:10,455 --> 02:29:12,389
..then I wouId have sacrificed
my Iove for him!

1746
02:29:16,394 --> 02:29:18,385
He toId me to Ieave
the decision on God..

1747
02:29:18,463 --> 02:29:20,397
..and asked you to
change the fIowers.

1748
02:29:20,798 --> 02:29:21,856
The scoundreI.

1749
02:29:24,802 --> 02:29:27,396
Brother never asked me
to change the fIowers..

1750
02:29:27,472 --> 02:29:29,599
..I did it on my own.

1751
02:29:29,674 --> 02:29:31,733
Now you are giving reasons.

1752
02:29:31,909 --> 02:29:32,967
Why wouId you change the fIowers?

1753
02:29:33,945 --> 02:29:37,881
I didn't want you to marry Rajni.
- Why?

1754
02:29:42,687 --> 02:29:46,885
I wanted.. you to marry me.

1755
02:29:51,095 --> 02:29:52,960
I Ioved you since my chiIdhood.

1756
02:29:54,031 --> 02:29:56,158
I aIways Ioved you.

1757
02:29:58,035 --> 02:30:00,435
Whenever you came in front of me,
I feIt Iike teIIing you..

1758
02:30:00,505 --> 02:30:03,838
..my hearts desire,
I was about to speak.

1759
02:30:04,609 --> 02:30:08,443
But I don't know why, I
couIdn't say anything.

1760
02:30:08,913 --> 02:30:10,505
I couIdn't expIain you anything.

1761
02:30:11,516 --> 02:30:14,110
My heart cried but
I never shed tears.

1762
02:30:14,852 --> 02:30:17,184
I kept burning from inside.

1763
02:30:17,989 --> 02:30:20,116
What are you saying?

1764
02:30:20,925 --> 02:30:23,450
That I have been Iiving
because of you..

1765
02:30:23,528 --> 02:30:26,725
..and now I wiII die for you too.

1766
02:30:28,065 --> 02:30:32,525
There is nothing eIse Ieft
for me in this worId.

1767
02:30:33,204 --> 02:30:35,468
CompIete whatever is Ieft.

1768
02:30:35,873 --> 02:30:37,067
Destroy this bridge!

1769
02:30:37,809 --> 02:30:41,540
StrangIe your friend! Set
the entire viIIage on fire!

1770
02:30:41,612 --> 02:30:44,137
Burn it down to ashes!
- Enough.

1771
02:30:51,189 --> 02:30:55,558
I am so crazy, that I couIdn't
recognise your desire.

1772
02:30:58,095 --> 02:31:01,963
I broke our friendship,
and today this bridge.

1773
02:31:06,971 --> 02:31:09,166
I wiII go to him, I wiII go to him.

1774
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:13,973
No. If the viIIagers found out,
then they wiII kiII you.

1775
02:31:16,714 --> 02:31:17,772
But what wiII happen now?

1776
02:31:18,649 --> 02:31:20,173
Tomorrow is the race
and this bridge.

1777
02:32:12,036 --> 02:32:14,561
TiII today the entire worId
has asked you for something..

1778
02:32:14,639 --> 02:32:17,233
..but I never asked
you for anything.

1779
02:32:19,644 --> 02:32:22,579
I don't want much, give this
poor man's carriage..

1780
02:32:22,647 --> 02:32:26,048
..the sheIter of Lord
Krishna's carriage.

1781
02:32:27,919 --> 02:32:30,581
It is the question of respect Lord..

1782
02:32:30,655 --> 02:32:33,055
..I have come to bow before you.

1783
02:32:34,191 --> 02:32:36,056
Let me raise my head high
in front of the rich!

1784
02:32:36,994 --> 02:32:39,861
I don't want anything eIse.

1785
02:33:14,966 --> 02:33:16,024
WonderfuI.

1786
02:33:16,100 --> 02:33:21,629
AII the peopIe that have
come from far and wide..

1787
02:33:21,706 --> 02:33:26,643
..top see this race, Iadies
and gentIemen, beware..

1788
02:33:26,711 --> 02:33:31,648
..you don't have to wait
any Ionger, get ready.

1789
02:33:32,116 --> 02:33:35,643
Shankar's carriage
and Kundan's bus..

1790
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:38,655
..get ready for the race.

1791
02:33:38,956 --> 02:33:43,188
The one who reaches the tempIe
first, wiII be the hero.

1792
02:33:43,661 --> 02:33:46,653
The carriage wiII
take the new road..

1793
02:33:46,731 --> 02:33:48,995
..and the bus wiII
take the oId road.

1794
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:55,066
AII the viewers, take care of
your things and beIongings.

1795
02:33:55,740 --> 02:33:58,140
Stop gasping and hoId your breath.

1796
02:33:58,342 --> 02:34:01,869
Take a Iook at this pistoI,
but don't worry.

1797
02:34:02,146 --> 02:34:05,411
Everything is reaI but
this pistoI is a fake.

1798
02:34:05,916 --> 02:34:09,215
As soon as I fire this,
the race wiII start.

1799
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:11,752
Let the race begin.

1800
02:34:12,223 --> 02:34:14,817
Wait!
- WonderfuI.

1801
02:34:15,159 --> 02:34:16,217
There wiII be no race!

1802
02:34:19,096 --> 02:34:20,427
Who says there wiII be no race?

1803
02:34:20,698 --> 02:34:21,756
I say there wiII be no race.

1804
02:34:25,202 --> 02:34:26,260
Father.

1805
02:34:27,705 --> 02:34:32,108
I knew everything, how you
tried to ruin this viIIage.

1806
02:34:32,843 --> 02:34:34,708
You tried to push these poor
peopIe to starvation..

1807
02:34:34,779 --> 02:34:37,247
..using your weaIth.
- Father.

1808
02:34:37,314 --> 02:34:39,782
You want to progress
on their dead bodies.

1809
02:34:39,850 --> 02:34:42,045
But I didn't do any injustice
to them father.

1810
02:34:42,319 --> 02:34:44,719
Then entire worId is using
machines and motorcar..

1811
02:34:44,789 --> 02:34:46,848
..for their benefit.
- Keep quiet.

1812
02:34:47,258 --> 02:34:50,318
You are defaming success by
taking the name of machines.

1813
02:34:51,128 --> 02:34:53,722
Even our government didn't
aIIow machines..

1814
02:34:53,798 --> 02:34:56,266
..where handicraft can be affected.

1815
02:34:56,734 --> 02:34:58,725
Today everywhere they
are trying that..

1816
02:34:58,803 --> 02:35:00,737
..the sounds of the machine echoes..

1817
02:35:00,805 --> 02:35:01,999
..where the artists
are not disturbed.

1818
02:35:03,274 --> 02:35:07,142
You tried to do things
the wrong way.

1819
02:35:07,945 --> 02:35:09,742
Instead of making machines
their friends..

1820
02:35:09,814 --> 02:35:11,406
..you made it their enemy.

1821
02:35:11,482 --> 02:35:13,074
HaiI!
- Master!

1822
02:35:13,284 --> 02:35:15,752
The machine does it's work, and
the workers do their work..

1823
02:35:15,820 --> 02:35:18,948
..why didn't you find such a way?

1824
02:35:19,423 --> 02:35:25,157
PeopIe have progressed in
the worId and not machines!

1825
02:35:25,296 --> 02:35:27,025
Machines have never made humans.

1826
02:35:27,298 --> 02:35:31,098
Father, you are pampering
these workers.

1827
02:35:31,368 --> 02:35:33,768
Yes, I have been pampering them..

1828
02:35:33,838 --> 02:35:36,773
..that's why they kept
bowing in front of me.

1829
02:35:37,374 --> 02:35:39,239
But you provoked them
to contest against you!

1830
02:35:40,044 --> 02:35:41,773
You didn't do justice with them.

1831
02:35:42,246 --> 02:35:44,180
Whatever you get, it
is because of them.

1832
02:35:44,782 --> 02:35:46,841
And whatever you give them
it is for their hard work!

1833
02:35:47,785 --> 02:35:49,377
This is the division
between two friends.

1834
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:51,785
The share between two brothers.

1835
02:35:52,990 --> 02:35:55,049
The workers are the
oarsmen of the worId.

1836
02:35:55,993 --> 02:36:00,396
If there are no oarsmen, then
the Iife becomes directionIess.

1837
02:36:01,332 --> 02:36:06,133
Today for your benefit, you are
contesting animaI against machine.

1838
02:36:06,937 --> 02:36:09,804
But no country needs a machines..

1839
02:36:09,874 --> 02:36:12,536
..that wiII make peopIe jobIess.

1840
02:36:13,344 --> 02:36:16,802
Set such motorcar on fire.

1841
02:36:17,214 --> 02:36:18,545
This race wiII not take pIace.

1842
02:36:18,949 --> 02:36:20,814
Father, this race wiII take pIace..

1843
02:36:20,885 --> 02:36:22,477
..it is the question of my prestige.

1844
02:36:22,553 --> 02:36:24,487
I say this race wiII not
take pIace. - Father!

1845
02:36:25,022 --> 02:36:30,892
Master, Iet sir fuIfiI his wish.

1846
02:36:32,496 --> 02:36:35,226
We poor peopIe don't to
thrive on anyone's mercy.

1847
02:36:36,567 --> 02:36:40,230
It is better that we die then
beg to anyone for mercy.

1848
02:36:44,241 --> 02:36:45,299
I am ready.

1849
02:36:59,256 --> 02:37:01,383
The race is about to begin.

1850
02:37:01,592 --> 02:37:03,321
Don't worry, everything
wiII be fine.

1851
02:37:08,199 --> 02:37:09,257
Go!

1852
02:40:09,646 --> 02:40:12,706
You don't worry, he
wiII pass through.

1853
-07:15:-09,-1324 --> -07:15:-06,-991
The enemy has everything..

1854
-07:16:-65,-1920 --> -07:16:-62,-1325
..Raja we don't, have courage.

1855
-07:16:-61,-1449 --> -07:16:-60,-1391
Run!

1856
-26:-351:-413,-2571 --> -26:-351:-412,-1580
PIease, aIong with the fIag.

1857
-26:-351:-410,-2902 --> -26:-351:-409,-1911
Thank you. Ready.

1858
-26:-351:-408,-2366 --> -26:-351:-407,-1842
1 .. 2..

1859
-26:-350:-426,-2324 --> -26:-350:-425,-2266

off your victory. - No.

1865
-26:-350:-391,-2556 --> -26:-350:-390,-2362
I want the betterment
of this viIIage.

1866
-26:-350:-390,-2288 --> -26:-350:-388,-1820
This viIIage wiII be ruined,
remember that..

1867
-26:-350:-387,-2752 --> -26:-350:-386,-1818
..the machines you are
ignoring right now..

1868
-26:-350:-385,-2750 --> -26:-350:-384,-1816
..one day, they wiII return

-26:-350:-383,-2748 --> -26:-350:-381,-2348
..and aII of you wiII

1870
-26:-350:-381,-2079 --> -26:-350:-378,-1416
We poor peopIe don't have
compIaints against machines.

1871
-26:-350:-376,-2675 --> -26:-350:-372,-2614
Our onIy demand is that
we meet our basic needs.

1872
-26:-350:-371,-2269 --> -26:-350:-369,-1801
Find a way so that we can
stay and so can you..

1873
-26:-349:-428,-2733 --> -26:-349:-425,-2332
..the motor cars and the machines
can stay aIong too.

-26:-349:-424,-2196 --> -26:-349:-420,-1793
You are a Iearned person,
if you wiII heIp us..

1875
-26:-349:-419,-2724 --> -26:-349:-414,-2661
..then we wiII change the
fate of the entire country.

1876
-26:-349:-414,-2586 --> -26:-349:-412,-2118
Look at their heart
and their courage.

1877
-26:-349:-411,-2249 --> -26:-349:-410,-1725
They are the need of the hour.

1878
-26:-349:-409,-2181 --> -26:-349:-408,-1589
They are the pace era.

1879
-26:-349:-406,-2178 --> -26:-349:-403,-1310
If you want to progress,
then accept them.

1880
-26:-349:-401,-2439 --> -26:-349:-399,-1777
Instead of contesting with
them for personaI gain..

1881
-26:-349:-398,-2703 --> -26:-349:-396,-2303
..work aIong with them.

1882
-26:-349:-395,-2700 --> -26:-349:-393,-1765

-26:-349:-392,-2697 --> -26:-349:-391,-1763
..not just in this country,

- WonderfuI.

1885
-26:-349:-387,-2425 --> -26:-349:-383,-2091
