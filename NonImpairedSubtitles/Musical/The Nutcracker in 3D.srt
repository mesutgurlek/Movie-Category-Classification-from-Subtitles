There's no privacy,
it's two in the morning,

any noise after 11 o'clock.

for my terrible behaviour.

334
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:47,089
But, in my defence, I was getting
one of my migraines at the time,

335
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,926
and I was reduced to this.

Yes, I do. What we need to do is...

but I have to say one thing.

All of a sudden,
it's his most valuable possession.

I've rarely heard of anything
more cynical.

criticise Uncle Albert like that?!

347
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:25,269

us to his charming companion?

348

What? Oh, sorry, yes. Allow me
to present our new owner, Mary.

- An honour.

Right. The plan is this.

354

but quite blatantly lying is another.

644
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,252
Now...

645
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:24,491
give me that doll.

646
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,835
You can't have him.

647
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,474
Ever.

648
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,668
And I'm not lying. I never do.

649
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,451
Joseph, listen. Do you remember
what Doctor Freud told us

650
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,883
about child psychology and dreams?

651
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,545
Please, can I have one morning

652
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,487
without that quack
being dragged into everything?

653
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,367
Where are you going?

654
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,674
I don't want you to see me cry.

655
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,875
Nobody's listening.

656
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,851
Not even trying.

657
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,751
# They simply say

658
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,757
# Come what may

659
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,328
# I'm lying

660
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,059
# But on reflection

661
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,693
# I'm simply different

662
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:39,234
# One of a kind, I don't mind

663
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,401
# I'm happy here

664
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,239
# Here with my secrets

665
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,914
# Here with my passion

666
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:57,755
# Dreams become real
And I feel I'm wanted

667
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:02,024
# Here I am braver

668
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,124
# I won't surrender

669
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,405
# Safe in my world

670
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,805
# And it's all I need #

671
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,153
You know,
I have the strangest feeling

672
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,493
that something is wrong
at Mary's house.

673
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,429
I'd better check.

674
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,335
(DOORBELL)

675
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,339
I didn't do anything! I swear!

676
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,110
Thank God you're here.
He won't admit to anything.

677
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:59,449
I want to talk to you.
Please help me.

678
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,956
(ALL TALK AT ONCE)

679
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,821
Quiet!

680
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,129
Happy Christmas, Joseph.

681
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:13,292
- Is everything all right?
- Uncle, a quiet word in my study.

682
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,131
Of course.

683
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,863
(ALL TALK AT ONCE)

684
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,133
Alone.
