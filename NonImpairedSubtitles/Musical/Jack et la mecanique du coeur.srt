1
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,833
JACK
AND MECHANICAL HEART

2
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:59,743
If I could, I would keep here in my belly,
hidden forever.

3
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:19,735
# They say I was born
the world's coldest day. #

4
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:24,344
# They say I was born with a frozen heart. #

5
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:29,777
# Even it can be said, that led me
Belly force ... #

6
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:34,738
# Top of the hill,
overlooking the city ... #

7
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:38,142
# And its bell tower. #

8
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:49,456
# There, living in a strange house ... #

9
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:54,845
# A midwife, all
considered crazy. #

10
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,845
Holds a dead bird in the hair.

11
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:46,055
There is another bird in this cage, right?
Do not worry, I'll take care of it.

12
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:48,556
Want something hot?
? Tea, coffee, whiskey?

13
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:54,295
You have to eat something. I made crepes.
The best of all time!

14
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:56,632
You can not give birth
on an empty stomach.

15
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:21,219
Ah, your heart is very hard.

16
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:25,045
- Your heart is frozen.
- Cute, you mean?

17
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,980
No, ice cream, like ice cream.

18
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:00,600
That is more robust,
have a good heart with this watch.

19
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,238
It will combine well with your head
Bird feet long.

20
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:11,733
Alcohol <i> tears. </ i>

21
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:13,849
With a bit of mint and chocolate,
is of course better.

22
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:28,497
William, the window, please.

23
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:35,057
Listen, my child.

24
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:38,323
Not to be back to a
Ice Cube forever ...

25
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,468
have to follow three rules.

26
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:48,901
# First, do not touch your hands. #

27
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:53,673
# Second,
you have to control your anger. #

28
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:59,235
# And above all never forget,
whatever happens ... #

29
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:04,179
# You never have
to fall in love. #

30
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,047
# Sino forever
the clock of your heart ... #

31
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:14,143
# The big hour hand,
will pass through your skin ... #

32
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:19,158
# Watch it explode
and your bones will suffer implosion. #

33
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,524
Mechanical heart # ... #

34
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,342
# Will be broken again. #

35
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:11,297
No, my ice cube
I'm not your mother.

36
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:13,795
Although I would.

37
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:22,884
It looks like a large snowflake
with needles protruding.

38
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:25,712
So it will be very easy to find
if there is a snowstorm.

39
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:42,226
I am sure she will be
much better mother than me.

40
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,032
Come on, come on!
! The ground floor of the mountain!

41
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:22,985
The Great Escape
the catacombs of heaven!

42
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:26,599
Today, no honey.
I have a lot of work, you know?

43
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,000
Again Arthur went to walk under
rain. His column is all rusty.

44
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,965
Oh, no! Today is my birthday.
You promised.

45
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,099
Have you cleaned your teeth?
You gave rope at your watch?

46
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,846
Yes, I cleaned my clock
rope and gave him my teeth.

47
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:38,514
Ten years ago
I'm stuck here.

48
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:39,414
Listen to me.

49
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:43,299
Just finished with Anna and Luna,
I take. I will fulfill my promise.

50
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:46,603
Every year it's the same.
I always spend after work.

51
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:49,612
But look! Anna and Luna again believe
storks. What can we do?

52
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,137
Where's storks?

53
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:55,826
Can you stay with Arthur,
while the oil permeates his column?

54
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:58,519
And please, do not make that face
embalmed bird!

55
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:28,899
Go! Everything happens in life. It can be
cure all, even if it takes time.

56
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:31,183
Look at me.
I got kicked out of my job ...

57
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,537
and when I told my wife,
she also gave me.

58
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:37,981
- Why do you have all these eggs?
- Because they are full of memories.

59
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:42,074
- My wife's cooking as well.
- You Achieve cook like her?

60
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:46,583
No. And when I prepare them myself,
I seem to be back with her.

61
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:50,473
Take one if you want.
It is your birthday.

62
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:54,304
- I will not take away a souvenir.
- Do not worry, I have too.

63
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:58,841
Someday, I will like to open your bag and
find a good childhood memory.

64
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:00,606
Thank you.

65
00:10:04,383 --> 00:10:07,338
Come on, Christopher Columbus.
Ready for discovery?

66
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,513
I'm going to wear!
Come on!

67
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:15,130
Wait a while.
Already dress.

68
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:18,716
We will go but first I have to
tell you something very important.

69
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:22,982
I wanted your heart is
stronger before I let you go outside.

70
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:26,842
- Every beat of your heart is a little miracle.
This thing is fragile. - I know.

71
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:31,609
- There are three rules you must not forget.
- "Do not touch my needles," I know.

72
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:34,326
- Yes, but ...
- "Controlling my anger."

73
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:38,123
And there is a third that will never commented.
It is the most important.

74
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:41,588
You should never,
never ever ...

75
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:45,636
fall in love. That is why I am so afraid
to take you into town.

76
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:46,504
Anything else??

77
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:51,384
Would die soon. You can not hold
emotional and physical burden of love.

78
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:54,449
I know. My heart is like a toy
but do not play with it.

79
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:57,956
- I'm not kidding, Jack.
- But how can I fall in love?

80
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,564
Not know what love is.

81
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:11,441
Look, there!

82
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:24,665
Slower.

83
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,105
- Look!
- Jack, calm down!

84
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:37,481
Is he my father?

85
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,778
No, it's not your father.

86
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,996
Wait!

87
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:50,528
- A cloud to eat it!
- Are you talking about me?

88
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:51,845
No, what you're eating.

89
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,915
What is this cute ...?
Does that sound there?

90
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,099
It is an organ of Barbary,
it's cute, right?

91
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:06,020
It works a bit like your heart.
Must be why I like it so much.

92
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,901
It is mechanical, with emotions inside.

93
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:17,517
Excuse me to come that way,
but can you give me the time?

94
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:21,422
- Son 18hrs, gentleman..
- The 18hrs!

95
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:26,788
The 18h01!Oh, no!
I knew it, I knew it!

96
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,932
She does not come.

97
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:32,434
Poor guy.
Wait, I have what you need.

98
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:42,141
Permission, I can?

99
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:45,604
Did you know that men cry
much better than women?

100
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,411
- No.
- Yes, with larger tears twice.

101
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:53,902
Jack? Jack?
Jack!

102
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:14,936
# I lost my glasses ... #

103
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:19,721
# Rather, I did not want them,
rarely do I see ... #

104
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:23,308
# With a face of calls ...
lenses. #

105
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:32,700
# Little phosphorus
is dangerous to be flirty ... #

106
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:37,946
# And do what you fancy,
You could even burn your eyes. #

107
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:42,022
# I do not care blurry ... #

108
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:46,934
# Do not need glasses,
to kiss and sing ... #

109
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:49,985
# I prefer to keep my eyes closed. #

110
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:55,446
# Oh, my little fire,
let me nibble your clothes ... #

111
00:13:55,718 --> 00:14:00,958
# Crumble wanting
and spit it out like confetti ... #

112
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:06,184
# To kiss under a rain ... #

113
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:07,732
# Did confetti? #

114
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:10,645
# Yes, we will. #

115
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:15,841
# I see pure fire.
In a few steps ... #

116
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:20,715
# I can get lost in the distance,
so far in my street. #

117
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:25,362
# Now I dare not look at the sun ... #

118
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:30,310
# Or look at the sky,
right in the eye. #

119
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:32,504
# I see pure fire. #

120
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:41,507
# I will guide you out of your head. #

121
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:47,013
# I'll be your prescription,
you will be my match. #

122
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:50,952
# I have a confession to make ... #

123
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:55,648
# I understand but never
I can recognize ... #

124
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:58,262
# Even if you were sitting
between two old. #

125
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:02,698
# We will rub,
my being against yours ... #

126
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:07,230
# Until burn our skeletons
and watch my heart ... #

127
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:11,101
# At midnight on the dot,
we will burn ... #

128
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,736
# Without even opening his eyes. #

129
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:37,097
# I see pure fire.
In a few steps ... #

130
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:42,192
# I can get lost in the distance,
so far in my street. #

131
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:46,651
# Now I dare not look at the sun ... #

132
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:51,772
# Or look at the sky,
right in the eye. #

133
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:54,960
# I see pure fire. #

134
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:08,310
Do you transform followed
Italian ice cream?

135
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,867
Only when I eat spaghetti
after midnight.

136
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:15,589
- What is this little sound?
- Nothing. P. .. rain.

137
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:19,739
- Do you like it?
- Rain, no. But their sound, yes.

138
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:26,164
- What's that sound, what was it?
- Lightning.

139
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,048
Jack!
No, why not!

140
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:42,030
What did you do?

141
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,222
You could be dead.The third rule!
Have you forgotten?

142
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,747
Do you hurt the gears when you cough?

143
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:57,633
It is a ridiculous suffering
next to it can cause love.

144
00:16:57,634 --> 00:17:01,673
More love stronger, more intense the pain.
Know what is surprising.

145
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:07,121
Cravings of jealousy, misunderstanding,
rejection, injustice ...

146
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:09,366
The mechanics of your heart will explode!

147
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,654
I like that watch transplanted,
Know your limits very well.

148
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:15,548
<i> a kiss, even mild,
You can destroy you ... </ i>

149
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:18,127
<i> straight, clack!,
six feet under. </ i>

150
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:18,490
You know why I saved your life?

151
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:20,917
You are the son I could ever have.

152
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:24,937
- How can that be?
- It is.

153
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:29,196
Sometimes nature is capricious,
you know it, right?

154
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:34,664
I cried a lot before.
But eventually, I got used.

155
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:40,219
Then arrived. As a godsend,
a consolation prize.

156
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,367
Think you can lose
fills me with sadness.

157
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:46,871
Is that why you started
tears to drink alcohol?

158
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:48,812
Yes, among other reasons.

159
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:54,976
How are you?Neither had time
to celebrate your birthday yesterday!

160
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:58,737
You seemed glued to the "ground floor
Mountain, "as you say.

161
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:03,986
Y. ..?? How about that great trip
in the city center?

162
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:06,978
I work down.
I leave.

163
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:13,208
- Y. ..?
- It was fa-bu-lo-so!

164
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:15,043
What did you see it so great?

165
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,560
A singer with glasses,
you never want to put them on.

166
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,141
- What does this mean?
- It's wonderful! P. .. like a bird!

167
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:25,505
In equilibrium in their tacos.
Have something fragile and strong at the same time.

168
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:27,369
Looks like a twig.

169
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:31,041
And when he sings, is equal
a bird, but with words.

170
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:33,561
And his nose!
Perfectly drawn.

171
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:36,134
So girl I do not know
how you can breathe it.

172
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,069
I think it's just for show.
It's too much girl!

173
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:40,408
So not wearing his glasses.

174
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:43,496
And with the slightest cold,
must snoring like a locomotive!

175
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:46,625
No, a nose and can only
produce a flute.

176
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,806
- You're not up to something, you?
- Yes, you.

177
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,628
- You know you are being banned.
- Pro-hi-bi-do!

178
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:58,265
- I know. - It's a bad for a good, you know?
If I could do without the love ...

179
00:19:58,266 --> 00:19:59,494
We know what we mean.

180
00:19:59,495 --> 00:20:02,834
Do you know?? I fall in love every time
that I have a regular patient.

181
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:05,892
And every time, they end up bored.

182
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,745
How about those flowers?
The chose to.

183
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,256
Some went shopping
the cemetery ...

184
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:15,510
The take on the grave of a dead
very rich and very dear.

185
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:19,026
- Nor was his burial place.
- Just cleaned it. Nothing more.

186
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:23,174
Now it looks better, thanks to us.
Neither looked his name, poor thing!

187
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:24,808
Not so "poor".

188
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:29,444
- And I brought a little surprise.
- For real?

189
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,479
Thank you.

190
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:35,248
- Where did you find this skirt, Luna?
- Do not like?

191
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:38,277
For in the cemetery,
As flowers.

192
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:42,410
It is a relic of my adolescence.
The modernized a bit.

193
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:45,085
It was the uniform that had
to carry on Calton Hill School.

194
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:48,313
- Does the school?
- I was a little girl well then.

195
00:20:56,551 --> 00:20:59,775
Madeleine, eh ...
I thought well in the three rules.

196
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:01,429
- That makes me happy.
- Good.

197
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:04,130
- And I think I found the solution.
- "The solution"?

198
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:09,399
I have to go to school. To ... eh ...
learn and understand the rules.

199
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,251
And apply them in real life.

200
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:14,646
Do not want to start studying
with your Board, here?

201
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:17,774
To work seriously,
I have to go to school.

202
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,801
What school?
You'll be bored there.

203
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:22,792
- Not at all.
- Of course I'll be bored!

204
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,910
You'll have to read books that are not going to
like here when you choose what you want.

205
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,642
You'll have to just sit
many hours without moving.

206
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:31,253
You can not talk or make noise ...

207
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,121
Even to dream,
have to wait for recess!

208
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,153
I know you,
You're going to hate that.

209
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:40,548
Everyone will make fun of you, with your watch.
You'll be treated like a monster.

210
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,456
All the world's children go to school.
You always have a job.

211
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:47,219
I feel lonely. be discovered
the world now, do you understand?

212
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:50,341
"Discovering the World" ... at school!

213
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:55,806
Well, I think there is a portfolio
school in the attic. Go for it.

214
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:58,715
Oh, Madeleine, is the best gift
World's Birthday!

215
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:40,335
Hi there. Do you know a little girl singer
that hits everywhere?

216
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:47,938
Hello there!
Have you seen a cant ...?

217
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:54,193
# Now go several years that I'm
as at home in this school. #

218
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:58,089
# It is true that in the playground,
often I am the law. #

219
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,131
# All students respect me.
Surely many fear me. #

220
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:05,777
# I have my brands, my habits,
my certainties that kingdom. #

221
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:10,182
# It's true, I do not like change.
For me, life is stability. #

222
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:14,000
# I want to delete everything you can
threaten my authority. #

223
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:14,804
Hi there.

224
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:18,167
# Long time do you need
and I have no more rivals around. #

225
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:22,182
# But at school, I do not like,
recently got a new guy. #

226
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:29,061
- Looking for something?
- Yes, a singer. Tiny.

227
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:31,252
What do you want that little singer?

228
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:35,016
A few days ago, I saw her singing and banging
everywhere. I want to give her ...

229
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,151
A pair of glasses!

230
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:41,507
It's called ...
called Miss Acacia.

231
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:44,698
- Miss Acacia ...
- And no one can talk about it ...

232
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:47,009
not even pronounce his name.
Except me!

233
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:50,433
- But ... eh ...
- No one! Did you hear? You got that midget?

234
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:52,011
Forget.

235
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:57,031
How do you make that ticking sound?
Is your heart that makes so much noise?

236
00:23:57,032 --> 00:23:58,155
Yes.

237
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:01,692
- Do not tell me you
you fell for it? - A little.

238
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,562
Too bad for you. He is no longer here.
Sure has left town.

239
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:19,489
I can not even hear you thinking, or destruction
the clock to serve you heart!

240
00:24:19,695 --> 00:24:23,334
I'll break so strong,
you never can love!

241
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:32,769
# Here you are, with a cat face ... #

242
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:38,440
# Funambuleando ceilings ... #

243
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:43,103
# With the moon as a watchman. #

244
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:46,574
Y.? .. How was school?

245
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:51,325
Hey! Vi move to a goblin with portfolio
came to school and did not kiss me.

246
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:15,405
Next time, it's your heart
I break your skull!

247
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:28,733
Come see "Big Ben"
haganlo and operated.

248
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:31,193
Come in.
One by one.

249
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:52,157
# Where I go,
there is a gate called "Joe". #

250
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:56,247
# I have to find a key
to free. #

251
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:01,043
That was my best customer.
So good, that he died doing ...

252
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:05,936
A champion rodeo was believed this.

253
00:26:29,077 --> 00:26:32,456
Now, enough.
We're going to have some fun today.

254
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:37,131
14, must be celebrated!
In my country, you'd be an adult.

255
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:42,320
Arthur, Anna, Madeleine, to celebrate!
Come on!To have some fun! Yup??

256
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,642
Arthur!

257
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:51,294
# Happy Birthday ... #

258
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:56,273
# We wish you ... #

259
00:26:56,691 --> 00:27:02,019
Happy birthday, Joe. #

260
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:07,490
# Happy Birthday. #

261
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:33,092
<i> Happy Birthday. Miss Acacia.
J. .. Edinburgh, Scotland. </ I>

262
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:36,564
- Give me that postcard soon!
- No, it's my birthday, for me!

263
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:39,164
"Happy Birthday" with signature
Miss Acacia.It's for me!

264
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:42,334
Today is my birthday.
You're late, Big Ben!

265
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:32,893
- Did you do well in school today?
- No.

266
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:37,147
What happened?
You went back to see the singer?

267
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,693
I killed Joe.
I killed her eye with the cuckoo.

268
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:43,579
Madeleine, police
are going up the hill.

269
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,985
I have to go.
Come and get me through the eye of Joe.

270
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:51,168
Anna, Luna, with Jack to the station.
You have to leave the city urgent.

271
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,761
- We take care.
- I'm staying for the police.

272
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:56,150
I prepare some things
and go out the back.

273
00:28:56,249 --> 00:29:00,315
- What will you say? - Do not come back
In a few days I'll tell you disappeared.

274
00:29:00,316 --> 00:29:04,651
Over time, you will be considered dead
Arthur and help me dig your grave.

275
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:08,573
- What will the coffin? - Nothing
Coffin, only an epitaph on the tree.

276
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:12,590
The police will not check. It is the advantage
be considered a witch.

277
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:14,470
They will not pry into my grave.

278
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:21,878
Watch your key, Jack.

279
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:26,523
And do not forget, just get settled,
go see a watchmaker.

280
00:29:26,524 --> 00:29:28,311
- You mean: a doctor?
- Not at all!

281
00:29:28,347 --> 00:29:30,706
Never consult a doctor
by a heart problem.

282
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:33,369
You'll have to find a watchmaker.

283
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:41,271
You're going to hurt the clock
If we tighten too strong.

284
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:46,917
You have to go now.
I do not want to get caught.

285
00:29:52,064 --> 00:29:53,935
We will.
It is time to leave.

286
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:58,625
I still have not gone,
but since I have cold.

287
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:32,381
# Now, I played like a bell ... #

288
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:37,194
# Abandoned in a desert of blue smoke. #

289
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:42,968
# As the fear go, go,
and the vicissitudes of the twists and turns ... #

290
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:46,060
# Cause me problems. #

291
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:50,080
# That I will learn to avoid other
opportunity, but now see ... #

292
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,423
# Popcorn that I have
in the heart begin to explode. #

293
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:59,081
# Is mechanical panic of my heart. #

294
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:04,061
# Loco, loco, locomotive,
steam locomotive. #

295
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,755
# Poor me without you
if you do not you wait in the station. #

296
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:23,759
# My heart is heavy,
not float or in the peaceful ocean. #

297
00:31:23,864 --> 00:31:27,148
# It will pique
Itchy a heart, I know ... #

298
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:30,991
# Is not very rich in love. #

299
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:44,827
# Come mists. Drop your
delighted trains at that hour ... #

300
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:48,774
# I can make them
Ghosts of sublime women. #

301
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:52,084
# Blondes or brunettes,
cut directly into the fog. #

302
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:57,042
# I destriparlas,
without even shoo ... #

303
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,917
# And signed: "your humble servant,
Jack ... The Ripper. "#

304
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:05,643
# Do not be afraid, little one! #

305
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:11,003
# You will learn quick scare
to exist. #

306
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:16,643
# Do not be afraid, little one!
You will learn fast to scare ... #

307
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:21,683
# Is mechanical panic of my heart. #

308
00:32:21,684 --> 00:32:26,320
# Loco, loco, locomotive,
steam locomotive. #

309
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:29,240
# Mechanical panic of my heart. #

310
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:34,587
# Loco, loco, locomotive,
steam locomotive. #

311
00:33:18,494 --> 00:33:21,216
Damn machine that does not work!

312
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:24,994
Excuse my behavior,
my friend ...

313
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:27,711
but it is extremely important to me,
jump-start my invention.

314
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:31,338
And as you see, is disarmed
very easily. Do you understand?

315
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:33,256
Yes, I think I understand.

316
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,417
What is this thing?

317
00:33:38,922 --> 00:33:41,959
What a lovely volcanic mechanics has here.

318
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,299
I need a watchmaker to repair me.
Do you know any?

319
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:50,505
I'm not a watchmaker, but I'm a handyman
I would try and fix this.

320
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,980
Would you like to scale
in my small workshop in Paris ...

321
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:57,505
to fix?

322
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,667
It's extraordinary!

323
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:11,249
That Dr. Madeleine is a genius.
The way you set this up ...

324
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,197
It is full of love,
even in the smallest detail.

325
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:17,883
That's my problem, love.
It is very dangerous for me, says Madeleine.

326
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,742
- Is very damaged?
- No, everything works fine.

327
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:27,008
And it gives me an idea for my camera.
If I put the same piece on the reel ...

328
00:34:27,009 --> 00:34:29,532
I put on the pulleys
Timing of your arteries ...

329
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:33,286
I think that making machine dreams
should work again!

330
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:35,262
Exactly like yours,
my friend.

331
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:39,069
- Lord ...
- Call me Georges, Georges Méliès!

332
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,170
Mr. Méliès,
I met a little singer ...

333
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:43,817
Well, they are things that happen.

334
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:47,664
Yes, but when I saw her, I felt
like an earthquake in my watch.

335
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:50,361
The gears creaking,
the ticking accelerated ...

336
00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:52,859
I began to suffocate, to confuse,
to entangle my needles!

337
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,070
- Do you like it?
- I loved it.

338
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:58,785
- So what?
- I fear that Madeleine was right.

339
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:00,237
That love is killing me.

340
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:03,608
If you're afraid to hurt you,
you increase the likelihood of harm you!

341
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:08,530
Watch the tightrope walkers. Do you think
to fall when walking on the wire?

342
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:13,546
Do not!They enjoy risk
to face danger!

343
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:17,117
If you spend your life not break fijándote
nothing, you'll be bored a lot, believe me!

344
00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:21,074
Want to live the great adventure
with that girl?

345
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:23,729
If I ever find it.
I think it is in Granada.

346
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,870
There is nothing more fun
that recklessness!

347
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:30,076
If at age 14 you decide to go
Return to Europe to see a girl ...

348
00:35:30,112 --> 00:35:33,892
is that you have the gene for recklessness
well developed, right?

349
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:39,298
See, it works.The machine works
exactly as your heart!

350
00:35:39,395 --> 00:35:42,705
Como vac feelings ..!
You could make a movie about ...

351
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:45,490
the mechanics of your heart, now that
I know all their gear.

352
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:47,312
Why not??
It would be nice.

353
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:51,544
Do you know?? When I was in love,
tucos kept inventing.

354
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:55,174
Cheats, tips and tricks always,
to amuse my girlfriend.

355
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:58,347
I think eventually
she got bored with my tricks.

356
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:05,085
Look, one day,
I took two tablets of their shelves ...

357
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:08,856
casters and added them I recovered
in a shopping hospital.

358
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:13,513
And we both slipped under the moon.
He never wanted to get on top.

359
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,892
And I had to repair the shelves.
It is not always easy to love, my friend.

360
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:21,680
Then come with me to Andalusia
Mr. Méliès.Anything can happen there!

361
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:25,353
Would you accept a conjurer
the brink of depression ...

362
00:36:25,354 --> 00:36:26,967
as partner
for your loving pilgrimage?

363
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:29,683
I love to travel with a magician,
Even depressed!

364
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:34,112
That's me! Let me put some
tricks in my bag, and go!

365
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:06,922
# I'm just a human trick
who wants to become a man. #

366
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:11,089
# No trick,
at my age, it would be perfect ... #

367
00:37:11,193 --> 00:37:13,727
# Not be considered as a man ... #

368
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:18,628
# Uno real big
a human being my age. #

369
00:37:18,629 --> 00:37:21,874
# A human without fakery. #

370
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:34,923
# I'm just a human trick
who wants to become a man. #

371
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:38,609
# No trick,
at my age, it would be perfect ... #

372
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,539
# Not be considered as a man ... #

373
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:47,037
# Uno real big
a man my age. #

374
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:25,882
I think we've arrived.

375
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:34,426
What do you think?

376
00:38:37,803 --> 00:38:39,463
It is different from Edinburgh.

377
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:50,741
My head is spinning!

378
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,273
Extraordinary!

379
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:10,327
<i> Come, see a man
laying eggs ... </ i>

380
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:13,978
<i> two monsters love ... </ i>

381
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:17,762
<i> a man transformed into a bird ... </ i>

382
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:49,315
Looking for a job, shorty?
I needed to espantador.

383
00:39:49,316 --> 00:39:52,332
No, I'm looking for a tiny, extraordinary
flamenco singer.

384
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:55,268
You here??It's like looking for a snowflake
snow in a sandstorm!

385
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:58,444
She has ankles chick
and often bump into things.

386
00:39:58,445 --> 00:40:02,304
And for me, I give a fuck your singer!
You want the job or not?

387
00:40:02,977 --> 00:40:05,163
<i> The girl-chocolate in person! </ i>

388
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:09,202
<i> says he can catch,
only to light a night without stars. </ i>

389
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:12,482
<i> Ladies and gentlemen, before long,
on the bandstand ... </ i>

390
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:15,727
<i> flamenco Miss Acacia! </ i>

391
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:18,109
- Miss Acacia?
- Now, do you mind?

392
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,026
I'll think.

393
00:40:20,027 --> 00:40:22,093
Mr. Méliès!
Mr. Méliès!

394
00:40:22,198 --> 00:40:25,281
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
in a short time ... </ i>

395
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:27,573
You have to act like a poker player.

396
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:30,229
Never show or your fear or your questions.

397
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:33,090
Have a master card
in your game: the heart!

398
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:37,509
Well, do not play as Valet, act
as King and you have to Lady.

399
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:40,893
- Yes, but I can not play cards.
- You're different, Jack ...

400
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:43,929
and think it's a weakness.
But it's the opposite!

401
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:49,131
Your difference is your strength!
This fragility, that clock-heart ...

402
00:40:49,132 --> 00:40:51,865
make you special
and so lovely.

403
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,704
- Accept your difference!
- Does my disability as a weapon of seduction?

404
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:57,579
- Do you really believe?
- Of course!

405
00:40:57,683 --> 00:41:01,217
Does your little singer
not seduced you ...

406
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:04,258
with his way of hitting
everywhere?

407
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:05,848
Maybe.

408
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:13,605
The door to his dressing room is
open and no one.Run!

409
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:32,982
<i> to a light kiss can destroy you.
I'm not kidding, Jack. </ I>

410
00:43:32,984 --> 00:43:35,310
<i> Suddenly, clack!, six feet underground. </ i>

411
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:47,172
# I lost my glasses,
rather I did not wear them ... #

412
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:51,753
# Make me look weird,
with a side flame ... #

413
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,408
What do you do here?

414
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:56,742
<i> height of seduction
is that she has the illusion ... </ i>

415
00:43:56,743 --> 00:43:59,416
<i> you're not trying to seduce her. </ i>

416
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,471
Hey!

417
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,873
I leaned against the door
and ended on the sofa.

418
00:44:04,874 --> 00:44:08,416
Does it happen often end up in the dressing room
a girl who is going to change?

419
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:11,351
- No, not often.
- So where usually ends?

420
00:44:11,352 --> 00:44:14,251
- Directly under the bed or does the shower?
- I'm sorry.

421
00:44:14,636 --> 00:44:17,826
Have we not met before?
I seem to recognize.

422
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,474
- Recognize me?
- Well, what do you want from me?

423
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:23,236
I want to get her something.

424
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,203
- What?
- A bunch of lenses!

425
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:30,446
They are my favorite flowers.

426
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:35,114
I never wear my glasses.
In my head, I look like a fly.

427
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:36,810
To me, that's fine.

428
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,868
Can we meet again?
With or without glasses.

429
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,429
Maybe.

430
00:44:52,325 --> 00:44:56,390
- You're not from here, right?
- Yeah, no, I work on the Ghost Train.

431
00:44:56,391 --> 00:44:59,198
Very well. So,
You're the new espantador?

432
00:44:59,302 --> 00:45:02,867
Right. The new espantripador,
It's me!

433
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:06,949
- Can I come to see you perform?
- Of course, where?

434
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:10,190
- Well, on the Ghost Train!
- Yes, of course.

435
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:12,884
- Tomorrow? How 16hrs.?
- May.

436
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:20,065
Y.? .. How did it go?

437
00:45:20,607 --> 00:45:23,057
Excellent!
I said maybe!

438
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:28,240
- Georges, you want to stay
coffee? - How about some tea?

439
00:45:28,556 --> 00:45:29,648
Both!

440
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,952
Is the position still vacant?

441
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:40,630
- Whenever you go running to think?
- Yes, and I thought long and ...

442
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,325
I would love to have the job!

443
00:45:42,602 --> 00:45:44,730
What can you do to scare?

444
00:45:55,873 --> 00:45:58,198
We will not make millions
with this, but ...

445
00:45:58,235 --> 00:46:01,058
I have no one and at least you,
trains will leave on time.

446
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,082
You can count on me for that.

447
00:46:04,874 --> 00:46:07,924
Stay in your place, scares people
and all will be well. Do you understand?

448
00:46:08,103 --> 00:46:10,101
- All right, lady.
- Miss.

449
00:46:23,502 --> 00:46:26,129
- Good Morning!
- You scared me.

450
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,858
- I have a sensitive heart.
- Me too.

451
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:46,360
# When working on the Ghost Train ... #

452
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:48,463
# I met this older girl,
called "Brigitte Heim". #

453
00:46:48,464 --> 00:46:50,481
# I'm the boss ... Ghost Train #

454
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:52,705
# And ground tombs steal skulls ... #

455
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:56,565
# To make cute decorations,
on the Ghost Train. #

456
00:46:56,802 --> 00:46:58,494
# Elle was awful
the Ghost Train ... #

457
00:46:58,495 --> 00:47:04,319
# And wanted me shooing people,
Poor me! #

458
00:47:05,454 --> 00:47:07,322
# "If you walk through the skulls ... #

459
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:11,182
# And break something,
You pay! "#

460
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:16,248
# But I was king of the Ghost Train ... #

461
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:20,563
# Because everyone wanted
see my heart bleed. #

462
00:47:20,852 --> 00:47:22,840
# He was the king of the Ghost Train ... #

463
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:27,493
# Until the day the little girl on fire
came to visit. #

464
00:47:29,737 --> 00:47:33,980
# I do not mind the awful lady
with full house vacuum. #

465
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:43,660
# I do not mind the awful lady
with full house vacuum. #

466
00:47:46,987 --> 00:47:50,230
# Because the little girl on fire
dream ... #

467
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:53,701
# Sleeping in my arms now! #

468
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,581
# Now in my arms! #

469
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:02,590
# Now in my arms! #

470
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:07,067
# Now in my arms!
I'm the King of the Ghost Train. #

471
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:12,707
# You are alone with your pretty skull
What a cute ornament ... #

472
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:15,361
# For the Ghost Train! #

473
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:18,901
# "If you give me headache,
Pay! "#

474
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:23,774
# "If you do not frighten people,
Pay! "#

475
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:28,728
# Pay, pay, pay,
always pay! #

476
00:48:28,937 --> 00:48:30,825
# Pay, pay, pay!
Always pay ... #

477
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:33,653
# Your ghost mouth
smoky. #

478
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:44,245
Not freaked anyone. Terrible.
I have a reputation to maintain.

479
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,671
Ah, yes. To me it gave me much fright.

480
00:48:46,976 --> 00:48:50,370
Of course,
She does not see anything!

481
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:57,074
It was very good. I saw nothing,
but it looked fun. Congratulations.

482
00:48:57,075 --> 00:49:01,826
- Thank you. Did you try the glasses?
- Yes, but they are bent or broken.

483
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:05,473
The purposely chose well, for you to use
without fear of damaging them.

484
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:08,699
I have this strange feeling ...

485
00:49:08,804 --> 00:49:13,136
as we had already
lived or dreamed this time.

486
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,844
- Oh yeah?
- I really think I know you.

487
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:21,598
- Can we dance?
- So, in silence?

488
00:49:21,702 --> 00:49:23,941
Yes, we have no problem of pace.

489
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:25,738
Right.

490
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:39,602
<i> Ghost Train. </ i>

491
00:49:46,212 --> 00:49:50,071
- What is that little sound?
- Rain. Do you like it??

492
00:49:50,342 --> 00:49:54,161
Rain, no.
But their sound, yes.

493
00:49:54,377 --> 00:49:56,735
And I heard it somewhere.

494
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,373
- It's my heart.
- Your what?

495
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:02,757
My heart.
I produced it the day I was born.

496
00:50:02,758 --> 00:50:05,910
They say he was born on the coldest day of the world
and my heart froze.

497
00:50:05,911 --> 00:50:08,287
It is full of Arreglito
but it works.

498
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:11,514
Want to try?
There is to wind.

499
00:50:11,515 --> 00:50:14,032
And here, to open.

500
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:18,520
Do you do all the girls that come to you
to see that the wooden heart?

501
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:22,025
- No, it's the first time.
- So, thank you.

502
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:23,190
You're welcome.

503
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,650
No, I can not.

504
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:30,496
Yes I am a magnet that grows
in my belly and draws me to you, but ...

505
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:36,557
I'm in love with another
and long.

506
00:50:36,593 --> 00:50:39,810
Yesterday, when I saw my dressing room,
you remind me a little.

507
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:43,384
And I confess that I liked.
But ...

508
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,702
start a new adventure
you would be dishonest.

509
00:50:47,156 --> 00:50:49,098
I can not, sorry.

510
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,902
- So ...?
- She's in love with another.

511
00:51:05,758 --> 00:51:09,034
I went through half of Europe for her,
For nothing!

512
00:51:09,035 --> 00:51:12,194
- Did you tell her you loved her, too?
- For what? His heart is full.

513
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:13,746
A heart does not empty
as a sink.

514
00:51:13,747 --> 00:51:15,516
- You recognized, at least?
- No.

515
00:51:15,552 --> 00:51:19,098
But I prefer not to recognize me,
to another without loving me.

516
00:51:19,707 --> 00:51:22,778
She is like a spark.
How to tame a spark?

517
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:27,069
Sparks is not tame, my friend!
They are like stars ...

518
00:51:27,173 --> 00:51:28,713
are always fleeting.

519
00:51:29,474 --> 00:51:33,475
I was never so sad ...
and so happy at the same time.

520
00:51:33,477 --> 00:51:38,235
Two incredible feelings by only one,
're lucky, small.

521
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:42,331
If only she believed in my heart.
He thinks it's an accessory, do you realize?

522
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:46,218
Girls are like wild animals as well,
freedom gives them their beauty.

523
00:51:46,351 --> 00:51:49,854
Do not try to tame it, because,
even if Miss Acacia loves you someday ...

524
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:52,067
You can never control something.

525
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:54,680
Tell me. Least
You know who loves her?

526
00:51:56,986 --> 00:52:00,373
- I just want to know ...
- What are you doing back here?

527
00:52:00,478 --> 00:52:02,036
- Do I know you?
- To whom?

528
00:52:02,082 --> 00:52:04,668
The boy who you're ... in love.

529
00:52:05,132 --> 00:52:07,297
- No.
- "No", you're not in love?

530
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:11,250
No, you do not.
Long time ago I have not seen.

531
00:52:11,644 --> 00:52:16,376
It was in Edinburgh.
That giant city her so well.

532
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:20,723
The tops of the towers
acute in the twilight ...

533
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:25,658
it was a little scary, but it seemed
reassuring with its strange shape.

534
00:52:27,974 --> 00:52:30,555
To do this with your watch!
Besides, it's dangerous!

535
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:33,678
It will end hurting someone.
You could take it off occasionally.

536
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:36,126
But I can not!
It is not an accessory, it's my heart!

537
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:39,941
I am sorry.

538
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:43,674
Look, I would much
that we might really friends.

539
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:46,590
Tomorrow, we may be on the stand
of extraordinary stories.

540
00:52:46,591 --> 00:52:49,848
They say there's a new thing for
storytelling. They call it "film."

541
00:52:50,018 --> 00:52:52,459
I'd love to go with you.

542
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,116
Maybe.

543
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:58,082
Ladies and gentlemen,
and above all, ladies ...

544
00:52:58,186 --> 00:53:01,528
Today, you will see the great number
Pink witchcraft in the world ...

545
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,518
even more than in the world,
In the galaxy!

546
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:07,417
You see, for years I
sewing dreams to reality ...

547
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:11,068
to form a single tissue of lies.
How exciting!

548
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:14,709
I started by sticking photographs
but I missed the most important ...

549
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:15,842
! movement!

550
00:53:15,843 --> 00:53:18,866
Film art is shamanic!
You can straighten shadows ...

551
00:53:18,911 --> 00:53:21,152
You summon,
Everything becomes possible!

552
00:53:21,153 --> 00:53:23,762
Soon we will relive
the dead with this tool!

553
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:26,989
! It is the best remedy
melancholy in this world!

554
00:53:27,399 --> 00:53:31,046
Ladies, ladies and ladies!

555
00:53:31,552 --> 00:53:34,084
You will see the first movie
engraved with a cinematographer.

556
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:38,250
And you could only try to love story
greatest of all time!

557
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,808
So, I must thank the man
that burned in me the last spark ...

558
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:46,241
to jump-start the machine
moving images.

559
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:50,699
I present to my left:
Jack, the man-watch!

560
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,373
Fifty kilos of bones
and crisp gear ...

561
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:56,169
covered by a thin
sweet skin and freckles ...

562
00:53:56,206 --> 00:53:58,917
More succulent than the other one!

563
00:53:59,022 --> 00:54:03,352
And a heart, ladies and ladies
Big as a watch!

564
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:06,804
In fact, I was trying to fix it
moving their gear ...

565
00:54:06,805 --> 00:54:10,203
finally,
I understood how to end my invention!

566
00:54:10,768 --> 00:54:12,552
Now what have good projection.

567
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:34,906
<i> </ i> is love.

568
00:54:57,971 --> 00:55:00,012
<i> But their love is impossible ... </ i>

569
00:55:00,013 --> 00:55:02,365

572
00:55:44,098 --> 00:55:47,134
Congratulations!

573
00:55:51,343 --> 00:55:55,092
- It was cute, huh?
- Oh, yes, very nice.

574
00:55:55,794 --> 00:55:58,358
- You, you cried.
- Not at all.

575
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:10,091
- I know your Romeo.
- Do not start again!

576
00:56:10,092 --> 00:56:14,075
This guy is bad. He has done everything.
I brutalized, left me a fool ...

577
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,858
humbled me, every day,
Against all!

578
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:18,321
It? If I had never done
hurt a fly.

579
00:56:18,322 --> 00:56:19,969
Maybe not a fly,
but to me, yeah.

580
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:24,628
- Why did not you defend yourself?
- It was much bigger and stronger than me.

581
00:56:24,629 --> 00:56:28,714
Do not! You must be wrong,
I measured him as no more.

582
00:56:28,715 --> 00:56:29,757
Much more!

583
00:56:30,243 --> 00:56:34,937
I only saw him once but
I remember like it was yesterday.

584
00:56:34,938 --> 00:56:38,542
I think of this memory every day
and every night to sleep.

585
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:43,984
- Are you jealous?
- Not at all. Not the problem.

586
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,247
I saw only without glasses
because he was singing.

587
00:56:47,456 --> 00:56:50,402
Not know if you recognize the view,
but ...

588
00:56:50,701 --> 00:56:54,206
I'm sure it's not the
monster which you speak.

589
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:58,604
- How did you meet?
- That day, it was raining in Edinburgh.

590
00:56:58,825 --> 00:57:01,936
The sound of rain is my music
preferred since.

591
00:57:01,937 --> 00:57:04,391
It was just before
denounce my parents.

592
00:57:04,496 --> 00:57:06,806
- Can you stop doing this?
- What?

593
00:57:06,807 --> 00:57:10,025
- That thing.
- No, I do not think.

594
00:57:10,419 --> 00:57:14,341
- No matter continue.
- I heard a voice and sang with me.

595
00:57:14,342 --> 00:57:17,844
Bailamos ...
rather, we hit and ...

596
00:57:17,845 --> 00:57:22,371
as we were in a bubble.
Sorry, should save the details.

597
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:26,123
No, no, continue.
On the contrary, do me good.

598
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:29,904
I do not know how he did it
but almost tore my dress.

599
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:33,232
- Do not!
- Yes, and I stepped on my glasses.

600
00:57:33,234 --> 00:57:36,667
- Do not tell me.
- Had that indescribable feeling ...

601
00:57:36,668 --> 00:57:41,085
like everything could happen.
I was confident it was fine.

602
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:43,940
So good!

603
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,305
I have ...
I have something to ...

604
00:57:54,493 --> 00:57:56,135
I have something to tell you!

605
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:02,824
- You wanted to tell me something?
- Yes, yes ... I ...

606
00:58:04,177 --> 00:58:06,917
- Then give.
- I would like ...

607
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:10,455
- See you again tomorrow.
- Okay. Where?

608
00:58:10,492 --> 00:58:12,677
Eh ... do not know ... uh ...

609
00:58:12,796 --> 00:58:15,681
- In the cinema, you think?
- Oh, yes.

610
00:58:16,716 --> 00:58:21,069
- Is that all you wanted to say?
- Yeah, yeah ... uh ... I think.

611
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:25,004
What's wrong now?
- Nothing, it's the movie, I ...

612
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:27,606
me ... I shook the gears.

613
00:58:29,027 --> 00:58:31,947
- Oh, Georges!
- How exciting is your movie!

614
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,545
- I wanna be your Juliet.
- Me too!

615
00:58:36,695 --> 00:58:38,157
He is in love with me.

616
00:58:38,507 --> 00:58:43,333
There it is, ladies and ladies:
Jack, the tamer of sparks!

617
00:58:43,334 --> 00:58:46,484
Yes, but there is a problem.
He is in love with another ...

618
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:47,527
Edinburgh him.

619
00:58:47,578 --> 00:58:51,335
That's not a problem.
The "other you" is you like.

620
00:58:51,336 --> 00:58:55,115
Now you can connect to both:
Dream and reality!

621
00:58:55,220 --> 00:59:00,626
- But I know not how to tell.
- Please! "I, Jack, Edinburgh ...

622
00:59:00,627 --> 00:59:03,372
"I traveled half of Europe
for you, my love ...

623
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,814
"And now, I want to climb to heaven
hand with you. "

624
00:59:05,815 --> 00:59:09,185
Never make it. I tried but
the words are in my throat.

625
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,447
He still afraid to explode
your heart, right?

626
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,841
Yes, I think Madeleine
and their efforts to keep it alive.

627
00:59:15,922 --> 00:59:19,867
Do not be afraid.
I thought you wanted to live, to be loved.

628
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:23,483
"To be considered a man,
one true, great, a human being ...

629
00:59:23,484 --> 00:59:27,145
your age, without a human trick. "

630
00:59:32,946 --> 00:59:36,283
I had to have told him who I was before.
You have to help me with a trick.

631
00:59:36,718 --> 00:59:40,272
One trick I do not know.
But an idea can be.

632
00:59:43,555 --> 00:59:45,707
Jack?
Jack?

633
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:51,410
- This way, miss.
- Yeah, over here!

634
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,170
Stay there.
Do not move.

635
01:00:03,285 --> 01:00:06,895
We are in Edinburgh,
the April 16, 1884.

636
01:00:07,209 --> 01:00:11,284
A typically British rain
moistens the city center.

637
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:16,278
# Dance like a bird, in balance
on their little tacos ... #

638
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:21,585
# Your feet start to tangle,
her cute nose to collapse comes ... #

639
01:00:22,584 --> 01:00:24,193
# Against the pavement. #

640
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:31,044
# I'm beating my head against
trees and blue leaves ... #

641
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:34,124
# That seem to be stuck in Heaven. #

642
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,392
- What is that little sound?
- It is true, what is it?

643
01:00:36,497 --> 01:00:37,996
It is raining.
Do you like it??

644
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:40,500
A Miss Acacia, loved the rain
but ...

645
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:45,447
still did not know that they were actually
Man beats his life.

646
01:00:46,213 --> 01:00:49,344
If that day, I would have said
whence came the sound of rain ...

647
01:00:49,497 --> 01:00:53,446
when the same Jack
toured half of Europe ...

648
01:00:53,447 --> 01:00:56,445
such a Don Quixote with wheels,
to conquer the impossible dream ...

649
01:00:56,446 --> 01:00:58,091
she would have recognized,
even without glasses ...

650
01:00:58,092 --> 01:01:00,819
for trusting your heart
and finally ...

651
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:05,182
could experience the unique magic
and intimate, it is to mix the dream ...

652
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,032
with reality.

653
01:01:34,948 --> 01:01:36,771
But go!

654
01:02:17,221 --> 01:02:18,857
What are you doing here?

655
01:02:18,961 --> 01:02:21,533
Eh ... I'm rehearsing kiss,
while you sleep.

656
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,997
If you're the guy from my dream
Edinburgh ...

657
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:28,398
Why do not you tell me then?

658
01:02:28,646 --> 01:02:31,902
- Fear not you remembered.
- I can hardly believe it.

659
01:02:32,475 --> 01:02:35,233
Also, my mother always told me
rely only on what he saw.

660
01:02:35,234 --> 01:02:36,380
Well, put your lenses.

661
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:41,852
To my parents, so deceived,
and I never saw them again.

662
01:02:42,212 --> 01:02:45,804
So I had to run away from Edinburgh.
They trusted.

663
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:47,146
Too bad.

664
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:51,829
<i> lived clandestinely in Scotland.
Neither I nor my mother had documents. </ I>

665
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:54,831
<i> One day, a neighbor promised
I was going to get us some. </ i>

666
01:02:54,832 --> 01:02:57,772
<i> And the next day,
It came with two policemen. </ i>

667
01:03:01,598 --> 01:03:05,761
<i> I stayed so long in the snow
my feet froze. </ i>

668
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:07,893
<i> My eyes also froze
in parts. </ i>

669
01:03:08,102 --> 01:03:10,512
<i> cried tears of ice. </ i>

670
01:03:11,508 --> 01:03:14,712
<i> not see much before but since
that time, even with glasses ... </ i>

671
01:03:14,713 --> 01:03:16,273
<i> I see almost nothing. </ i>

672
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,638
That key gives wind my watch.
Without it, I'd sleep forever.

673
01:03:32,054 --> 01:03:35,237
You can open, winding,
Do whatever you want.

674
01:03:37,736 --> 01:03:40,986
- Do not I hurt you, there?
- Not exactly.

675
01:03:43,314 --> 01:03:47,313
- Is this normal?
- Yes, it's okay, just ...

676
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:49,340
long ago
I'm in love with you.

677
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:51,759
Trust me.
Follow.

678
01:03:56,817 --> 01:04:00,421
# You are the key
I fully opens. #

679
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:04,248
* You can visit my body. #

680
01:04:04,979 --> 01:04:08,917
# From the inside,
squeeze my heart ... #

681
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,806
# To make me mourn. #

682
01:04:13,191 --> 01:04:17,197
# Even your tongue sometimes shines. #

683
01:04:17,406 --> 01:04:22,462
# Oh, flag!, I flagger.
I came back to strike. #

684
01:04:24,471 --> 01:04:27,185
Miss # key. #

685
01:04:28,388 --> 01:04:31,154
# Miss key! #

686
01:04:31,364 --> 01:04:35,624
# I know where to tighten
make you laugh, even frying. #

687
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:39,409
# Put birds around your bones ... #

688
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:43,712
# To give you the feeling of flying! #

689
01:04:43,817 --> 01:04:47,812
# Fly and fly,
sound your tacos. #

690
01:04:47,813 --> 01:04:50,491
# I would stop time
to last ... #

691
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:53,818
# A little more. #

692
01:04:57,518 --> 01:05:00,965
For a while I'm like,
Dwarf!Do not you! What do you do with it?

693
01:05:00,966 --> 01:05:02,821
Waste of time.
All are waiting at the kiosk.

694
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,411
You go on stage in 5 minutes!

695
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:10,926
Here, I have to go.

696
01:05:12,025 --> 01:05:16,328
- No, keep it. - But is the key
your heart, Jack. It's yours.

697
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:19,663
No, now it's yours.
Let's go??

698
01:05:19,768 --> 01:05:22,174
- How do you mean?
- Both. After your concert ...

699
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,731
them up like lightning.

700
01:05:23,885 --> 01:05:26,511
- You mean "like horses"?
- Exactly, yes.

701
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:30,543
- To go where?
- I do not know, but I'd like to say yes.

702
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,166
Watch out!
If parts of my skull, the pay.

703
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:11,616
I do that labor.

704
01:06:11,617 --> 01:06:13,534
And what will you do now
old assembly?

705
01:06:13,628 --> 01:06:16,817
Will you serve in a decorative clock ...
or a cemetery?

706
01:06:16,857 --> 01:06:19,543
The cemetery is a good idea.
Also, since I have a grave.

707
01:06:19,788 --> 01:06:21,127
Get out of here!

708
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:45,122
- Y. ..?
- Yes, what happened?

709
01:06:45,361 --> 01:06:47,968
- Love the real me.
- Congratulations, young man!

710
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:49,813
I'm happy for you both.

711
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,915
The way to look after the concert,
and we sneaked us into English.

712
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:55,591
- You mean, "the French"?
- Yes, well, "the French".

713
01:06:55,695 --> 01:06:58,791
Thank you very much for everything.
I would never have done it without you.

714
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:01,480
- We will miss you.
- Feedback from time to time.

715
01:07:47,432 --> 01:07:49,859
Jack?
Your watch is fast.

716
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:56,405
Joe?
What are you doing here?

717
01:07:56,441 --> 01:07:59,831
I always dreamed of knowing Andalusia
You know?

718
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:05,462
And as I kept birthday cards
you sent me ...

719
01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:09,349
I thought:
"I'm going to visit me Miss Acacia."

720
01:08:09,546 --> 01:08:13,163
- Hopefully, I will listen sing.
- How kind.

721
01:08:13,949 --> 01:08:15,460
- Would you go again?
- Yes

722
01:08:15,564 --> 01:08:19,690
I went to see my childhood sweetheart:
Jack. We leave tonight.

723
01:08:19,841 --> 01:08:22,637
Are you going with him?
Congratulations.

724
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:24,250
I did not recognize at first.

725
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:27,217
At the same time, it's like
if he had always known it was him.

726
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:31,519
Strange, I, I turn to find
enemy of my youth.

727
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,882
The haunting sound of your heart
night from my school.

728
01:08:34,883 --> 01:08:39,229
Since then, I can not stand
the slightest noise clock.

729
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:40,588
And it is, I'm ready!

730
01:08:40,785 --> 01:08:45,033
Oh, at that time, that little Jack,
with its air of sad bird ...

731
01:08:45,138 --> 01:08:48,091
I did not realize
how it was dangerous.

732
01:08:48,092 --> 01:08:49,419
What do you mean dangerous?

733
01:08:49,524 --> 01:08:53,720
- Are you sure you've seen that has
a normal heart? - Yes, I noticed.

734
01:08:53,721 --> 01:08:56,250
That thing, shaped clock ...

735
01:08:56,459 --> 01:09:00,726
then, is not a heart, is a Granada,
What a time bomb!

736
01:09:00,727 --> 01:09:03,269
I know what I mean,
I suffered the consequences.

737
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:07,351
Jack may be a done this.
Not hurt a fly.

738
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:12,620
Except when you lose control of your heart
and fails to respect the three rules.

739
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:15,040
What rules?

740
01:09:16,887 --> 01:09:21,588
# First, do not touch your hands. #

741
01:09:22,002 --> 01:09:26,693
# Second,
you have to control your anger. #

742
01:09:27,005 --> 01:09:32,089
# And above all never forget,
whatever happens ... #

743
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:36,976
# You never have
to fall in love. #

744
01:09:36,977 --> 01:09:39,134
You could have become
a killer!

745
01:09:39,135 --> 01:09:41,408
- What are you talking about?
- Joe told me everything!

746
01:09:41,445 --> 01:09:43,734
I know all three rules,
busted eye, everything!

747
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:47,112
- Joe?
- Yes, I do not lie more.

748
01:09:47,113 --> 01:09:50,103
- Joe is here?
- How could you hide things so serious?

749
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:51,379
Who are you?

750
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:54,684
Who I am, or rather
was it love?

751
01:09:54,685 --> 01:09:57,661
I could have killed you.
No I love you more.

752
01:09:57,662 --> 01:10:00,054
Would you have turned into a killer.

753
01:10:00,354 --> 01:10:03,493
This is not love.
Selfish!

754
01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:06,376
- But it is not so!
- Did not you popped his eye?

755
01:10:06,377 --> 01:10:09,713
Yes, but it was an accident.
I never wanted to get that but ...

756
01:10:10,234 --> 01:10:13,126
He did not tell me you did
endure for years!

757
01:10:13,232 --> 01:10:16,192
- Deserved to reventaras an eye?
- No, of course but ...

758
01:10:16,349 --> 01:10:19,655
Why do you think I told you
and came here for that?

759
01:10:19,766 --> 01:10:23,307
- Try to get away from you!
- Try to protect you.

760
01:10:23,343 --> 01:10:27,320
It has never protected anyone!
Sowed terror in school!

761
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:29,996
And continues to do so today, look how
we are acting because of him!

762
01:10:29,997 --> 01:10:32,383
- More over, you're angry.
- Listen to me.

763
01:10:32,384 --> 01:10:33,833
Do not touch me.

764
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:36,762
For this!

765
01:10:44,676 --> 01:10:47,919
- You scare me.
- I ... I'm sorry.

766
01:10:51,678 --> 01:10:55,465
- It's raining.
- Let me now.

767
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:07,251
I have a strange way of loving
weird but my heart ...

768
01:11:07,904 --> 01:11:09,086
I really love you.

769
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:12,184
It is true, Madeleine
I fall in love ... banned

770
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:14,307
no clutch, I put my life in your hands.

771
01:11:14,412 --> 01:11:18,053
Because since I saw you sing
and we crashed ...

772
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:21,782
I think only see you again.
I can face it all for you.

773
01:11:22,372 --> 01:11:24,015
I can do anything for you.

774
01:11:24,016 --> 01:11:27,974
With this, I agree!
You do anything!

775
01:11:27,975 --> 01:11:30,534
Yes I know. I do everything backwards.
It makes me angry.

776
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:33,227
Well, I'd rather be with rabies
until you're dead.

777
01:11:33,662 --> 01:11:37,095
Now go.
Go, please.

778
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,578
# Years and years of thinking,
in brooding ... #

779
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,654
# But it is impossible to accept
that relationship is over. #

780
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:11,834
# Miss Acacia haunts my mind,
please do. #

781
01:12:12,072 --> 01:12:15,449
# I'm going to meet her
and with it he busted my eye. #

782
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:19,736
# So I'm back
and I come to change history. #

783
01:12:20,006 --> 01:12:23,876
# I will not stay in Edinburgh,
rotting in despair. #

784
01:12:23,877 --> 01:12:27,603
# It is not enough to see it
only in my dreams. #

785
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:31,713
# I came to retrieve it.
If I try, I die. #

786
01:12:31,818 --> 01:12:35,655
# I'll also see my worst enemy,
that dwarf, that "Little Jack". #

787
01:12:35,882 --> 01:12:39,533
# And approaching him,
then I heard the famous tic-tac. #

788
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,738
# I looked at my one eye
and increase the tension felt. #

789
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:47,478
# I saw hatred in the eyes of Jack,
we had to talk. #

790
01:12:47,712 --> 01:12:51,532
# I told him it was not the same
to be one-eyed and had changed me. #

791
01:12:51,752 --> 01:12:55,507
# I too have suffered for being different
and did not come to revenge. #

792
01:12:55,796 --> 01:12:59,555
# What mistreated in the past and he blew me
the eye. I think we're on par. #

793
01:12:59,765 --> 01:13:03,618
# If back is only for one thing:
Miss Acacia has to stop. #

794
01:13:03,884 --> 01:13:07,673
# Jack understand that hate me,
for years I was the cause of their misfortunes. #

795
01:13:07,945 --> 01:13:11,410
# The humiliated, chased him,
I made all the pain. #

796
01:13:11,669 --> 01:13:15,340
# But it was his fault. The first day
class, I had the bad idea ... #

797
01:13:15,549 --> 01:13:19,398
# Talk to me Miss Acacia,
that was his death sentence. #

798
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:23,583
# We have a common point,
both would do anything for her. #

799
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:27,502
# We are adults, so far,
no fights child. #

800
01:13:27,759 --> 01:13:31,622
# I want to head back to Edinburgh
up, along with Miss Acacia. #

801
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:36,132
# Now, I propose a duel Jack
fair and the best man win. #

802
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:40,894
You lost yourself,
I did not have to do anything.

803
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,774
I thought I would address
a tougher opponent.

804
01:13:44,775 --> 01:13:46,511
I really do not deserve it.

805
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:51,231
Back when I went to see her,
immediately snuggled in my arms.

806
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,555
- I hate you!
- No, Jack!

807
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,511
Do not!

808
01:13:57,108 --> 01:13:58,948
Stop, no!

809
01:14:01,434 --> 01:14:04,048
Do not stay here
is in crisis.

810
01:14:38,347 --> 01:14:40,048
- Broken is whole.
- Broken is whole.

811
01:14:40,153 --> 01:14:42,641
I want to change the heart.
Modifícame, I beg you.

812
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:46,294
I'm sick that screwed all the time.
Madeleine was right.

813
01:14:46,295 --> 01:14:49,771
I have some spare parts for my
camera, but I can try to fix ...

814
01:14:49,772 --> 01:14:53,162
I'm sick to remake me,
I want something solid, something new!

815
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:56,984
Your problem seems to me to be more
deeper than the wood of your watch.

816
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,913
I want you to install a new heart
and start again from scratch.

817
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:04,016
Do not ever want to fall in love.

818
01:15:04,017 --> 01:15:08,074
I understand, my friend,
need time, nothing more.

819
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:11,500
But I no longer remains,
I gave my key to Miss Acacia.

820
01:15:11,605 --> 01:15:14,828
Do you give the key to your heart
and a spark?

821
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:17,885
- Where is he now?
- He's gone. With Joe.

822
01:15:17,886 --> 01:15:20,936
That key was your life!
You knew the risks!

823
01:15:21,457 --> 01:15:23,715
- I know. - You have to go back
to see quick Madeleine.

824
01:15:23,924 --> 01:15:27,664
Only she can save.
When did you last rope?

825
01:15:27,858 --> 01:15:29,627
- I do not know.
- Have to hurry.

826
01:15:37,923 --> 01:15:41,823
Better stay here.
He knew the risks as you said.

827
01:15:42,402 --> 01:15:45,731
I have to bear them alone.
In addition ...

828
01:15:45,987 --> 01:15:48,786
you're having success with
your "Journey to the Moon."

829
01:15:48,787 --> 01:15:51,335
One love "two for one"
It is a formula that suits you.

830
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:56,300
- Courage, my friend, value.
- It is the value that I need.

831
01:16:19,085 --> 01:16:21,049
Do you think Jack will be fine?

832
01:16:21,894 --> 01:16:26,062
You think back to Edinburgh?
His whole family is there.

833
01:16:26,098 --> 01:16:29,083
I do not know, but if you decide to return ...

834
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,418
is to find
a very bad surprise.

835
01:16:31,419 --> 01:16:32,430
Why?

836
01:16:32,507 --> 01:16:36,583
Just after the departure of Jack, that witch
Madeleine ended up in jail.

837
01:16:37,067 --> 01:16:39,078
I was not ...

838
01:16:40,311 --> 01:16:42,816
I'm sorry,
a front wheel is broken.

839
01:16:42,922 --> 01:16:46,289
- I was not what?
- Not very happy to be in jail.

840
01:16:46,613 --> 01:16:50,255
But he did not stay there long,
died a few days later.

841
01:16:50,374 --> 01:16:51,888
<i> "A witch is imprisoned." </ i>

842
01:16:57,775 --> 01:17:00,788
They say he died of sadness
because of Jack.

843
01:17:01,536 --> 01:17:03,978
You mean:
because of the way Jack.

844
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:07,913
Yes, that should be. That guy planting
misfortune wherever I go.

845
01:17:16,728 --> 01:17:17,857
What is it??

846
01:17:18,031 --> 01:17:21,260
Jack had given me his key before
leaving, I have to go back there!

847
01:17:46,363 --> 01:17:48,651
Excuse me.
Do you know where is Jack?

848
01:17:48,652 --> 01:17:50,698
Eh ... returned to Edinburgh.

849
01:17:50,777 --> 01:17:54,372
It is what I feared.
I have his key.

850
01:17:54,409 --> 01:17:57,783
Do not worry. That Dr. Madeleine
you saved the day he was born ...

851
01:17:57,819 --> 01:18:01,131
know how to fix it,
even if everything comes unarmed.

852
01:18:01,167 --> 01:18:02,545
Is she dead!

853
01:18:03,114 --> 01:18:05,696
What? You have to catch up fast,
Save it!

854
01:18:05,697 --> 01:18:07,187
That's all he wants,
Salves you what!

855
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:12,031
It's in a car for Valencia. with
Hopefully, you'll get before you board the train.

856
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:15,940
Wait, just a second!
It is the diary that I am writing ...

857
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:19,956
since I met Jack. have something
to read for that long trip.

858
01:18:26,575 --> 01:18:27,791

You still look like
a muscular shrimp, eh?

874
01:21:17,845 --> 01:21:21,377
I think Jack caught a bad cold.

875
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,066
quiet,
quiet.

876
01:21:25,764 --> 01:21:28,373
Hello, Arthur.

877
01:21:29,236 --> 01:21:33,349
Rust invades your spine.
Squeaks any movement.

878
01:21:33,442 --> 01:21:36,719
He began to fear the cold
and rain since ...

879
01:21:39,429 --> 01:21:40,572
Where is Madeleine?

880
01:21:43,374 --> 01:21:45,260
Jack, listen.

881
01:21:45,365 --> 01:21:48,291
I'll have to pronounce
heavy words.

882
01:21:48,396 --> 01:21:52,870
So heavy that may remain
stuck in my throat.

883
01:21:53,899 --> 01:21:57,061
- The day you went away ...
- After accompany the train ...

884
01:21:57,062 --> 01:22:01,242
- Anna and I returned here.
- The door was open.

885
01:22:01,388 --> 01:22:04,324
- No one.
- The workshop was broken.

886
01:22:04,325 --> 01:22:06,341
It seemed like a hurricane had passed.

887
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:08,438
All boxes Madeleine
were open.

888
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:10,130
Even the cat was gone.

889
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:12,610
With Arthur, went to look for her.

890
01:22:12,611 --> 01:22:16,653
And finally, we find ...
in the prison of San Calford.

891
01:22:16,654 --> 01:22:18,329
- In jail?
- Yes

892
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:20,872
The police arrested her after
our departure.

893
01:22:20,873 --> 01:22:23,404
It was not the first time
that the imprisoned.

894
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:24,996
We thought everything
was going to fix.

895
01:22:25,032 --> 01:22:28,790
- I want to see it now.
- I would tell you ... they released.

896
01:22:28,826 --> 01:22:31,843
- That kitchen with a hand ...
- Make someone other ...

897
01:22:31,879 --> 01:22:34,854
and although you have missed,
she's fine.

898
01:22:35,978 --> 01:22:37,636
But ...

899
01:22:38,942 --> 01:22:40,596
Madeleine is gone.

900
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,079
He left his body in prison.

01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:47,721
I know you'll be very sad ...

902
01:22:47,722 --> 01:22:50,966
but never forget that you gave him the
joy of being a real mother!

903
01:22:51,844 --> 01:22:54,627
It was the biggest dream of his life.

904
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,852
For her, you were a small and fragile thing ...

905
01:23:08,076 --> 01:23:10,095
to be protected at all costs ...

906
01:23:10,482 --> 01:23:13,673
linked to it by the cord
clock-shaped.

907
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:18,143
He feared the day that you would become
an adult.

908
01:24:15,135 --> 01:24:18,524
I stand here. And I advise
do the same, miss.

909
01:24:19,067 --> 01:24:20,813
This site up there,
is happy.

910
01:24:36,919 --> 01:24:37,974
Jack!

911
01:24:38,993 --> 01:24:40,945
Here I am.

912
01:24:42,566 --> 01:24:44,335
Jack?

913
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,520
It's not too late.
I can still save you.

914
01:24:59,521 --> 01:25:02,313
- You just did.
- No, let me.

915
01:25:02,618 --> 01:25:04,997
I have to give you rope.

916
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:10,490
You came here for me.
It is the most extraordinary thing you can do.

917
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:15,362
- Thank you.
- Do not!

918
01:25:17,037 --> 01:25:20,910
Now, if something happens to me,
I will be solely responsible.

919
01:25:22,545 --> 01:25:24,668
Now, you can kiss me.
