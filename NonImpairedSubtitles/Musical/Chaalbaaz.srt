1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:07,796
This is the story
of 2 girls- Anju and Manju,...

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:13,802
..who were born in this palatial
mansion but never enjoyed it.

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,808
When Manju was 6 months old,
her maid kidnapped her.

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,823
It is rumoured that
the maid was mentally unstable.

5
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,879
- Master! Master! -The owners
took this loss to heart...

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,383
... and called Tribhuvan
from the village...

7
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,351
... to look after the property.

8
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,888
As soon as Tribhuvan arrived...

9
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,857
... plots started
floating around the mansion...

10
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,851
...cause he wanted his brother's
immeasurable wealth for himself.

11
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,866
When Anju was ten...

12
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,871
... her parents died
in a car accident.

13
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,864
But people say that accident
had been caused to happen.

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,915
But nothing was proved. After
Tribhuvan's wife's death...

15
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,375
... his sister-in-law,
Amba came to leave his son.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,389
Amba came but never went back.

17
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,892
It's said that Tribhuvan
and Amba had an affair.

18
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,887
One day Tribhuvan
tried to kill Anju too.

19
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,435
But the cunning Amba stopped him.

20
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,404
As the property would
then have gone to the trust.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,443
Tribhuvan swallowed his anger...

22
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,402
... and poor Anju
had to pay the price.

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,420
No! I don't want it.

24
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:47,887
Mr.India and WWW.LAPACHE.INFO
PRESENT :

25
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:59,992
CHAALBAAZ

26
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,087
- Why are you late? - Today is
her parents' death anniversary...

27
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,554
... so she was shedding tears.

28
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,092
Today is my brother and
his wife's death anniversary...

29
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,593
... and no-one told me!

30
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:26,099
This is disloyalty that the
brother who looked after me...

31
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,067
... I forgot
his death anniversary!

32
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,605
I' m not worthy of pardon. I
should be punished for my crime.

33
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:37,065
- Anju, what's my punishment?
- What are you saying, Uncle?

34
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,116
I... was crying
because of my helplessness...

35
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,576
Who made you helpless?
Did you, Amba?

36
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,080
How could I dare do that?
I' m a guest in this house.

37
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,127
Anju is the
mistress of this house.

38
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,585
Yes, her
wish will come true now.

39
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,090
Anju, what do you want?
Tell me, my child.

40
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:14,103
I' ll offer flowers worth Rs.5/-
to the temple in their name.

41
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:20,608
Only worth Rs.5? For my
honourable brother and his wife?

42
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,657
Absolutely not! Buy all
the flowers from all the shops.

43
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,161
10-ay Anju, in memory of
her parents, will distribute...

44
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:33,121
... clothes and
sweets to poor children.

45
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,171
- Really? - Yes, child.
- But the money?

46
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:43,676
Don't you dare talk of money.
Here dear, keep this money.

47
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:48,136
- Distribute it. - No.
- Take it, my dear.

48
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,156
You must be crazy
to think I'd give you money.

49
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:06,155
One only sheds tears for the
dead. Come on, to the bank.

50
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,208
Come on and no excuses at the
bank. I' m fed up of your tears.

51
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,176
Keep this. Go.

52
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,171
- Miss Anju, here's your money.
- Give it to me.

53
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,220
Times are bad these days.

54
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,189
Carrying money
is quite dangerous.

55
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,192
We' re in a hurry.
We take leave.

56
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,228
What's the hurry?

57
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:41,734
- Have a cup of tea.
- Today is my brother's death...

58
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,693
...anniversary. Anju has to dole
out clothes & sweets to the poor.

59
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,241
We have lots of work.
So we must take leave.

60
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,701
- You' re forgetting something.
- No, I've taken the money.

61
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,706
- Anju has forgotting to sign.
- Oh!

62
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,719
Take.

63
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,727
Cap!

64
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,738
Sign.

65
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:32,741
- Who gave this money?
- To buy flowers, Dadu gave it.

66
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,756
Dayal, come here.

67
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,765
Dayal take off my shoes.

68
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:55,263
Your fingers have grown
old serving this family, Dayal.

69
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,776
I' m proud of this fact, master.

70
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:04,817
Who does this much to
earn one's livelihood?

71
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,786
I' m slave to
your command, master.

72
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,290
Why did you give Anju
money against my wishes?

73
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,301
- Want money?
- Don't beat Dadu.

74
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,839
Want to
celebrate their anniversary?

75
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:33,346
- Only five rupees. - What?
- He only gave me five rupees.

76
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,813
How dare you speak back!

77
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,309
It's very important for you
to obey me Dayal. - Yes sir.

78
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,817
Hold this! Hold. Hold it.

79
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,824
Celebrate their
anniversary go on!

80
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,839
Have you gone mad? If she dies
we' ll be on the road. - But...

81
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:07,380
Can't you wait?
Spoiling matters.

82
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,382
Still standing here!

83
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:15,343
Go do your work
It's only a little blood!

84
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,351
Sister, if something happens
to you, what' ll I do?

85
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:31,359
Yes Raju, I have to
live. For you, I must.

86
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,863
I have nobody else but you!

87
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,382
All this should be clean by the
time we return, understand?

88
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,876
Or l' ll make you wash
the floor with your tears.

89
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,891
She's putting on weight!
Cut out one meal from her diet.

90
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,895
Everything should be clean,
understand...

91
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,388
Stop crying and smile for me.

92
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:07,440
Please sister.
Okay whom shall I imitate?

93
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,907
Shall I mimic Papa?

94
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,402
She's put on weight,
Cut out one meal from her diet.

95
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,925
Sis, I want to get married.

96
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,930
Strange, you' re not at all
interested in my personal life.

97
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,436
Friend, sis doesn't want
to hear, so l' ll tell you.

98
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,476
If I get married,
she' ll get some respite.

99
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,445
I've seen a girl also.
She studies in my class.

100
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,439
She's unmarried so far. She
helped me with my spellings once.

101
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,987
But her nose is always running!

102
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,946
She' ll bring lots of
chocolates in her dowry.

103
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,451
I would've refused but its a
matter of all those chocolates.

104
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:08,456
- Sis, talk to her folks.
- Crazy guy, stop it!

105
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,461
I haven't seen
you dance for ages.

106
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,474
No.

107
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,012
You know what' ll happen
if they catch me dancing.

108
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,470
Your face glows with
happiness when you dance.

109
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,983
No.

110
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:33,601
- We did hear some music here.
- Even I heard it.

111
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,653
- Yes, sir.
- Who was dancing here?

112
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:46,659
Dancing? God knows.
Anju was cleaning this place.

113
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:52,665
Raju must the playing somewhere
and at my age, I can't dance.

114
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,634
- Answer to the point, go.
- Alright.

115
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,637
I've called important
people for my birthday.

116
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,140
Keep an eye on Anju.

117
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,142
You've said it
and Amba has heard it.

118
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,646
- You relax. - Aren't you
forgetting something?

119
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,649
- What?
- Nothing.

120
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,643
Oh! Many happy
returns of the day.

121
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,658
By the way,
how old one you today?

122
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,661
Have I ever asked you your age?

123
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,205
Happy birthday. So how many
winters have you seen go by?

124
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,709
- l' m a little boy still.
- Where's Anju? I don't see her.

125
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,711
She must be busy.

126
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,715
I keep telling her there's
no need for her to work.

127
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,720
But she loves to
do everything herself.

128
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,725
- And where's Suraj?
- I don't understand him at all.

129
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,685
All kids return home by 10 but
his night begins only after 10.

130
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,736
Have you planned for some
dance or its just cake and out?

131
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,705
Wait a minute and watch,
Mr.Vishwanath.

132
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,701
Friends, thank you for
joining me in my joy.

133
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:19,251
You've always abused
me for my miserliness.

134
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:25,713
But today your abuses will be
drowned by applause. Clap!

135
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,242
Anju, what' re you doing
here alone. Come, join in, come.

136
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,912
How dare she slap
you before other's Tribhuvan!

137
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:54,967
You must take charge or
things will go out of hand.

138
00:18:54,967 --> 00:19:01,930
I won't spare her,my whip hasn't
tasted her blood for some time.

139
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,950
Dance! Let me see
how much you' ll dance today.

140
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,965
Today l' ll make you dance
to your hearts content.

141
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,482
No! Don't beat me.

142
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,520
Get up!

143
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,489
Beat me!
Yopu will beat me?

144
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,992
Dance! You love to dance!

145
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:59,486
I' ll show you such a dance that
you' ll forget your own dance.

146
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:07,494
You've danced to music, now
dance to the tune of my whip.

147
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,049
If I let go of you,
you' ll fall and become lame.

148
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,052
And you won't be able to
dance anymore! Shall I let go?

149
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,011
- No.
- No, okay I won't let you fall.

150
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,036
Got hurt? Broke your leg?

151
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:47,535
Now we' ll make dear Anju stand &
check whether her leg is broken.

152
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,049
It hasn't broken. Then
now it' ll break!

153
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,091
You' ll hit me!
On my birthday!

154
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:04,096
You will humiliate me in
everyone's presence?

155
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,065
Master! Stop it! Have mercy!

156
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:14,562
Forgive Anju, sir!
She' ll never dance.

157
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,111
Explain to, her that if she ever
dances again,...

158
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,569
... she wont have feet left!

159
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,083
She won't dance again.

160
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,583
Get up child.

161
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:45,093
Get me poison, Dadu.
I want to die, Dadu.

162
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,106
Why doesn't death come to me?

163
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,099
I cannot take this anymore.

164
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:59,106
Have patience child
and trust in God.

165
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,119
Remember my child.

166
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:08,660
Whoever gave that whip in
Tribhuvan's hand, also gave...

167
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,620
... somebody else the
power to snatch it from him.

168
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,137
Manju is my name, what?

169
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:39,191
- Sorry, Manju bai.
- Me, bai, a courtesan.

170
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,193
You called me a super stage
artiste, a courtesan?

171
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,161
I didn't, my boss did.

172
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,199
Will you pay me or not.

173
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:53,205
I danced and performed
a whole show for you.

174
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,673
Didn't you tell her what I said?

175
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,212
What did he say?

176
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,670
He said you should come for
dinner to claim your money.

177
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,191
Take care of this girl.

178
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:24,191
Brother, you?
I...I was simply joking!

179
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:33,201
Doesn't matter, l' ll take
my money later. Bye, Tata.

180
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,750
Jaggu, things are
beyond my control now.

181
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,218
I won't get involved
in your problems.

182
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,269
Sir, you banged into my car.
Please pay up for the damage.

183
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,237
You want money, here take this.

184
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,347
Jaggu, sir.
I was just paying up.

185
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,358
Take it. Rs 60/- for taxi damage.

186
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,360
You keep the rest.
He dented my cab.

187
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,358
- What?
- Dirty, dirty, chhee!

188
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,406
You speak as if it's yours.
Come on, put down the meter.

189
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,409
- This cab is booked.
- l' ll pay the full fare.

190
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,413
- You' ll pay?
- Look, don't act smart.

191
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,914
There are plenty of cabs in town.

192
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,916
Then go with somebody else.

193
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,919
If I go elsewhere,
what' ll happen to your meter?

194
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,887
You've a big actress,
come on, sit.

195
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,890
Red Fairy!

196
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,438
- Here take five rupees.
- Five rupees?

197
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,406
But the meter
shows twelve rupees.

198
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:54,446
- We used fuel worth five bucks.
- Is the cab your pop's?

199
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,904
- Don't reach my Dad.
- Okay, okay.

200
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,953
- Keep these five
rupees for your dowry. - Okay.

201
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:07,414
Marry a nice chap. These daily
fights are not meant for you.

202
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:13,420
Soon you' ll see me as
an all lndia star!

203
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,469
Have you ever seen
yourself in a mirror?

204
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,471
Get married before its late.

205
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,973
Or you' ll be left beating
the drums at a brothel.

206
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,431
Or you' ll and up as some one's
mistress.Now get lost l' m going.

207
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:30,437
Stupid girl! Wears rented
clothes and dreams of stardom!

208
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:39,446
My name is Chinchinchu,the night
is moonlight, you and me...

209
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,497
My buffalo has become
thin feeding you her milk.

210
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:49,501
I've got blisters on my hands,
washing your clothes.Pay me now.

211
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,470
You ate my salt and now want
to gulp down our money too.

212
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,467
You found this day to
come to claim your money.

213
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,481
Why Manju? What happened?

214
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:09,521
What is left to happen now?
My mom!

215
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:14,526
- What happened to her? - The
same that happened to Dilip...

216
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,984
... Kumar in Devdas and
Rajesh Khanna in Anand.

217
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,489
- Super hit!
- No, cancer.

218
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:29,996
When my mom is no more,
why should I live?

219
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:35,046
I too will die! Your milk...

220
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:39,050
- Not mine, my buffalo's.
- Whatever, your clothes.

221
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,009
Everything will
be dust in the end.

222
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,058
We came and will
return empty handed.

223
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,526
Be it a king or a beggar,
a Manju or a Bihari.

224
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,030
- Finally what's in your lives?
- What?

225
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:58,525
Nothing but a coffin and
2 feet of earth.

226
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,538
There's nothing in
this game, nothing.

227
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,531
It's a two day game with income
tax problems in between.

228
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,581
When the heart is
broken, why live?

229
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,550
I am leaving.
Where's my house? Where?

230
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,088
Don't Manju! Are we dead?
In bad times we' ll help you.

231
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:23,049
No brother I've bothered
you enough already. No more now.

232
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,097
At the most people' ll
say she could pay...

233
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:30,557
... neither milk
nor clothes bill..

234
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,104
-... and what was your's?
- Salt.

235
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:37,108
And I couldn't even
pay for my mom's treatment.

236
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,611
Don't cry Manju.
Take this from me.

237
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,612
How can l?

238
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,571
- I have only twenty. Take them.
- Will do.

239
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,620
I too am a father.
Take this from my side.

240
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:55,126
It's okay.
How will I ever repay you?

241
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,593
Slowly, slowly.

242
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,633
Leave me alone with
my sorrows, please.

243
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,600
Let's go.

244
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,607
The night is moonlight,
you and me...

245
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,164
We' re very sorry to inform
you that your mother...

246
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:38,670
..who is admitted to the mental
hospital is suffering from fits.

247
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,629
Hence you are informed to
come and meet her immediately.

248
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,156
- How's my mother?
- Come, l' ll take you to her.

249
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:15,161
- Mom!
- No, don't touch me.

250
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:22,714
I' m a serpent. I' ll bite
you,run away, you unfortunate!

251
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:27,174
- Don't say that, mom.
- Go, run away, go!

252
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,188
I' ll bite you.

253
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,203
Open, sesame.

254
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,720
Brothers, you appear
very troubled.

255
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,258
If you don't mind,
may I help you?

256
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,762
The car's got locked. What' ll
you help? Get lost.

257
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,731
Incidently l' m a car expert.

258
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,733
Nobody knows a car better than me.

259
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,272
I can look at a car and
tell what's wrong with it.

260
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,776
There's another way
to start a car.

261
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,778
- How?
- With the key.

262
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,280
- How do you have the key?
- When Dad gave me this car,...

263
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,248
... would he keep the
key with himself?

264
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:37,288
I hope while leaving home
you all told your mothers...

265
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:42,749
... that you'd be late or
might not return at all.

266
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,880
You've returned, Suraj?
But it's only 4 a.m.!

267
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,348
The whole day is left.
How did you return so early?

268
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,384
It seems as
if you haven't slept.

269
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:18,344
The world rises with the
sun and l' m only your father.

270
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,852
I've told you often not to
spoil your sleep for me.

271
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,400
If his son comes home
breaking panes,...

272
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,402
... then the father can't sleep.

273
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,361
- Who told you that? - Somebody.
- Who? - The police.

274
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,411
They mustn't have told you that
I caught a car-stealing gang.

275
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,879
- Caught them? - Yes Dad.
- Very good!

276
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:48,875
But there are other things
that a man has to do.

277
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,890
Look Dad, I understand your
point, you too see my point.

278
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,891
I work with you in the factory
throughout the day.

279
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,431
Then I get a little time
so I go to the disco.

280
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,433
- And break window panes.
- Yes, I do.

281
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,937
- And I apprehend thieves.
- All that is fine but...

282
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,440
... at least select one girl
from the snaps I've shown you.

283
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,399
All the photos are good but none
of the girls is suitable.

284
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,947
Then what girl
do I bring for you?

285
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,914
Beautiful, dad!

286
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:25,957
When I return from work she
should take care of me & say...

287
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,458
One beer please.

288
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,461
Forget about beer! I won't
give you even a glass of water.

289
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,965
I' ll pay up your bill next week.
Why are you losing your sleep?

290
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,968
And you too have one chilled
beer on my account.

291
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,970
I' m hearing this for the
past one year.

292
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,929
I won't die
without paying your bill!

293
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,942
- After all what's my age?
- Thirty two.

294
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,446
Take these 32 rupees and give
me 2 bottles of beer.

295
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,993
- Want some?
- I drink with my own money.

296
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,961
And money is what she never has!

297
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,966
Give me one bottle for free.

298
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,007
This time it's on me next time
you pay for me.

299
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:21,512
No, no. I don't want it but if
you insist, l' ll have to accept.

300
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,980
- But only 2 bottles?
- How many will you drink?

301
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,982
As much as you can buy me.

302
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,978
- Doesn't anybody stop her?
- l' m not married as yet!

303
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,492
- I too am a bachelor!
- Then shall we?

304
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,533
Phokat, give us one beer please.

305
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,536
- There no more beer!
- Then get the bill.

306
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,996
-l' ll clear everthing next week.
-l' ll pay it.

307
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,015
Where do you live?
..House?

308
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,010
My house is very big-really big!

309
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,559
It takes so long to go from
one room to another that...

310
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,026
I' m thinking of buying a cycle.

311
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:18,024
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Sunita, Salma or Suzie.

312
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,573
How does it matter?
I' m only a woman...

313
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,031
... wanting to live in this
man's world on her own...

314
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,081
... terms.
- Yes, terms.

315
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,549
- And wants to drink others'
beer. - Shut-up!

316
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:41,047
It' s going to pour heavily.
I must go home. Okay.

317
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:48,099
- l' ll give you a lift.
- I neither take nor give lifts!

318
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,066
I' m going.

319
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,575
Where's my house?
It's this way.

320
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,731
" Wonder where she has come from"

321
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,234
" Wonder where she will go"

322
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:07,193
"This girl will make me go crazy"

323
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,242
" It is a short meeting"

324
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,211
" But it's very sad"

325
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,705
"This girl won't
be wooed by anyone"

326
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:05,751
" Your wet body will
set my body on fire"

327
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,304
" When the dark shadow of my
tresses falls on you"

328
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,772
" It will make you go crazy"

329
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,316
" You will miss me
all day and night"

330
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,285
" But it's very sad"

331
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,286
"This girl won't
be wooed by anyone"

332
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:20,326
"This wet girl, has she run
away from home and come"

333
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,878
"This is not a girl,
she is a serpent"

334
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,346
" Who has awakened
from sleep and come"

335
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,391
"Give your hand into mine"

336
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,859
" But it's very sad"

337
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,353
"This girl won't
be wooed by anyone"

338
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:32,898
"Sit comfortably besides me,
you need not fear"

339
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:42,408
" My state is not so bad
for me to fall in love with you"

340
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,463
" You will miss me
all day and night"

341
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,431
" But it's very sad"

342
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,426
"This boy won't be wooed by you"

343
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:11,497
Son, as far as I recall, you
have 6-7 umbrellas...

344
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,045
... 10-1 2 rain coats and
quite a few cars...

345
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,047
... that' ll the useful in this
rainy season.

346
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:22,508
- But if I wanted to get wet?
- Accepted.

347
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,056
But why are you ruining
the family reputation...

348
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,523
... wearing a girl's hat.

349
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:35,566
You've had enough tea, etc with
girls in the beer bars.

350
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,535
Now look at this snap of a
good girl that I've brought.

351
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,538
- This photo!
- Yes.

352
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,040
I've already promised her
parents.

353
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,545
Where did you find such a
beautiful girl?

354
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,585
- l' m your father.
- You' re truly great.

355
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,087
- Shall I fix things then?
- Let's go rightaway.

356
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,590
Not now, tomorrow.

357
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,092
You want to see Anju?

358
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:06,597
-But you've seen Anju? -I have
but l' m not marrying her!

359
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,599
Suraj is and
he wants to see her.

360
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,567
He's agreed to marry her?

361
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,606
- Who? - Mr. Vishwanath is
coming to see Anju.

362
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,107
- So let him come.
- But, but...

363
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,075
- l' ll manage everthing.
- How?

364
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,578
She hasn't created
a scene for long.

365
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,617
Mr. Viswanath, I don't
recall Anju's parents...

366
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,619
... having spoken of marriage...

367
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,120
... but if you say so,
it must be.

368
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,122
I thought you'd remember.

369
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,580
- That's why I telephoned you.
- Okay. Anju will soon be here.

370
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,127
What will you have?

371
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,595
We've come for a bride
and we' ll only take her.

372
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:46,091
There's dear Anju.
Careful.

373
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,111
Sit down, child, sit.

374
00:46:56,146 --> 00:47:00,105
- Good day, good day.
- Live long dear child.

375
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,619
This is my son, Suraj.

376
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,124
Good day.

377
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,137
Make some tea.

378
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,179
Sugar,... how many spoons?

379
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,647
None, none for me, child.

380
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,643
- Won't you have beer?
- What?

381
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,161
Won't you show me the garden?

382
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:50,200
Yes, yes, my daughter, take him
Show him the garden.

383
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,660
Yes, yes. If you want
to go to the garden, go ahead.

384
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:29,740
Sometimes she gets
these kind of fits.

385
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,198
- Fits?
- Nothing much. Take her up.

386
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,214
Don't be scared. She' ll be fine.

387
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,754
For a while, I thought the
injection was adulterated.

388
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,723
God's justice can be
delayed not denied.

389
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,715
At least we've got relieved
of this problem.

390
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,728
What happened to your nephew?

391
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,765
I've called him;
must be on his way.

392
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,768
- What's his name? - Batuknath.
- What nath?

393
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:01,226
Batuknath Lallan Prasad
Malpani is my name.

394
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:07,233
I' m looking for this address for
2 1/2 hours and can't find it.

395
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:12,738
Brother? Can you guide me
to this address.

396
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:19,790
How can l, brother? I' m blind.
I' m a beggar.

397
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,749
Haven't eaten for 2 days,
not seen a movie for 4 days.

398
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:29,755
Give me 1 rupee and God will
give you 10 lakhs.

399
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,760
You are blind? Look blindy,
I hate 2 things vehemently...

400
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,307
Beggars and dogs!

401
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:41,311
Go home and glance in the mirror
your hatred will vanish!

402
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,778
Give me some money.

403
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:48,318
So you are blind?
Right from birth?

404
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:54,324
- Yes.
- Oh! How sad!

405
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,326
Don't steal it.
It's counterfeit!

406
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,329
How do you know?
You' re blind!

407
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,797
I recognise
Jaunpuri's immediately.

408
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,834
How do you know
l' m from Jaunpur?

409
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,837
This oil on your mousy head...

410
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,304
... gives you away.

411
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,842
- Oh, it's perfume!
- No, it's stench.

412
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:15,345
I' ll give you a
blessing of Bombay...

413
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,348
... that you' ll always remember.

414
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:25,856
Oh God! Get up! Rascal, get up!
Acting smart?

415
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:30,816
- Pick up the luggage. Come.
- Where am I stuck?

416
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,866
- But you were blind! - To
show the world but actually...

417
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,834
... I have 4 eyes. Shall l
show you? - No.

418
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,872
- Take out your cash. - I don't
have any! - Then why the name?

419
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,875
Go and earn some money
take off your chain, quickly.

420
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,843
- What? - Give me your chain!
- Damn!

421
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:52,337
- Watch! Does it work?
- Yes.

422
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,886
- What's in the trunk?
- Vegetables.

423
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,353
Vegetables in the trunk? Show.

424
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:04,394
Quickly I've no time! Says
vegs. and removes clothes!

425
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,896
Shall I cut you up like a
vegetable? - No, no.

426
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:11,902
Keep the tin. You' ll need it.
You' ll remember me a lot now.

427
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,903
Never!

428
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,905
Whenever you miss me write to
me at this address.

429
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:19,910
You wanted to go someplace. Go
straight till the crossroad.

430
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,413
Then, turn at the signal, turn
again.

431
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:29,419
Then turn again and here you' ll
find me again.

432
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,886
And l' ll loot you again.

433
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:47,893
Wow! What a bungalow!

434
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:55,401
I' ll become a millionnaire. This
will all be mine. - Mister!

435
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,956
Good dance. You must have been
dancing on All lndia Radio.

436
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,958
Bless, me uncle.

437
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,461
Alright, but what' re you
doing here? Who are you?

438
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,965
Uncle, l' m your little rephew.
That tiny, cuddly little baby...

439
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,933
... who soiled your
clothes in his childhood.

440
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,944
Looks like he's the household
servant!

441
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:32,983
I' m very tired and my vest
tore due to exhaustion.

442
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,942
Get a chilled glass of water
for me, quickly.

443
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:46,451
What are you doing?
He's our Batuknath.

444
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,456
- Anuty! - Yes?
- Your servant hit me.

445
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,460
- Uncle, you say something.
Tell your servant...

446
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:01,011
- Why did you hit me? - Are you
crazy? He's our servant.

447
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,979
And this is Mr. Tribhuvandas!

448
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:15,025
Forgive me, uncle. I' m a small
little, cuddly, cute baby.

449
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:20,986
- Okay look at your shabby
condition. - I met a beggar.

450
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:25,535
I' m very generous so l
gave him everyhing I had.

451
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,502
Mad chap!

452
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,010
Come Sharma.

453
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:44,009
Sir, sir. If you need a dancer
for your show, then tell me.

454
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,513
Silver jubilee when she sings
golden jubilee when she dances.

455
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,562
Assume that your show is a super
diamond jubilee.

456
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:56,566
If she's so good, why does she
live in this slum?

457
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:02,072
Sir, why does a lotus
bloom in slime?

458
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:06,076
Can you tell me? Why are
diamonds found in coal mines?

459
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:10,080
Can you say?
It's an artiste's wish.

460
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,049
The darling of the masses
wants to stay with them.

461
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,088
Come see the crowd for
her autograph!

462
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,591
-What autograph? We want money...
-No autograph on money,please.

463
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,059
Brother, Manju is not at home.

464
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,563
Trying to pull my leg!
Get lost.

465
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,059
- How unfortunate she's
not at home! - What?

466
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,573
The show will
have to be cancelled!

467
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,077
Who says that l' m not at home?

468
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:53,579
I've brought them so 50-50
after the show, okay?

469
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,127
She's not well. Let's go. Show
cancelled.

470
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,130
Who says l' m not well. I' m
absolutely fine, superb.

471
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,598
If we get a sample to watch,
we' ll be at peace.

472
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:10,095
Shut-up!...No sample.
Straight show.

473
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,130
" My name is Love Street"

474
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,667
" Love Street leaves home"

475
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:41,125
" And visits different streets"

476
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,141
" He called out my name"

477
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,144
" I held on to my heart"

478
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:59,189
" He teased me, I turned away"

479
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,158
" What else could I do"

480
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,160
" He was standing in the street"

481
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,164
" He was after me since very long"

482
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,175
" He was all charged"

483
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,180
" He was standing
in the street..."

484
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,251
" It happened in the
middle of the street"

485
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,254
" And this game began"

486
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,752
"Our eyes met, and people
gathered in the street"

487
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,266
" My heart pounded"

488
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,271
" He said so much"

489
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:00,264
" I sensed danger, I got scared"

490
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,782
" What else could I do"

491
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,285
" He was insistent"

492
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,290
" He was after me since very long"

493
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,344
He tried very hard"

494
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,348
" But I stole away"

495
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:20,344
" Move away, I said!"

496
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,392
" He said, look here"

497
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,360
" I have not come empty handed"

498
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,863
" I have bought you a ring"

499
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,859
" I wouldn't take it otherwise,
I'd have thrown away the ring"

500
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,373
" But a diamond was studded in it"

501
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,377
" But he was after me
since very long"

502
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,925
- You! - My name is Batuknath
Lallan Prasad Malpani.

503
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,440
But people lovingly call me
Balma.

504
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,444
Do you know the meaning on
" Balma"?

505
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,445
I have work to do.

506
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,487
Include me also in your work.

507
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,455
I don't understand
what you' re saying?

508
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:04,949
You didn't understand my
language? Shall I explain again?

509
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,462
Let me go.

510
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,467
Grandfather!

511
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,470
Nobody's in the house,
thanks to God.

512
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:19,463
- I look at her then at the bed!
- Let me go.

513
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,480
- What?
- What's this what?

514
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:28,472
I' m neither your sister nor
your brother-in-law.

515
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,977
Say Balma, say it - Balma!

516
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:40,485
- My Balma (sweetheart).
- My Balma.

517
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:47,036
Now Batuknath Lallan Prasad
Malpani will redeem you!

518
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,503
Your Balma!

519
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:57,502
Where will you escape to? I' m
here only for you!

520
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:04,008
And you've been made only
for me, by God!

521
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:21,025
You wanted to escape by
shutting the door!

522
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:27,577
My body is aching.
Massage me a little.

523
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,044
I' m tired!

524
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,547
Massage me a little.

525
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,075
Stop!

526
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,583
Now l' ll show you your duty!

527
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,088
Where will you escape to?

528
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,609
Moti, bite him!

529
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,174
Hey Manju, what are you doing
in here?

530
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,677
Can't you see? I' m
taking beer bottles.

531
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:13,182
No. I' m fed up of you and
your drinking on credit.

532
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,687
Hey Barman, talk politely, no
more credit, l' ll only pay cash.

533
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:23,148
- How much? - Rs.1 58.70
inclusive of today's 4 bottles.

534
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,161
Here, take Rs.200.

535
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,665
Wow! Great Anju! Today you've
done a miracle.

536
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,201
Who' ll give the change, your pop?

537
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,170
- Not may pop! I' ll give it.
- Then give.

538
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,675
Take and now on our account
as been squared up.

539
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,183
It's very hot. Bye-bye.

540
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:55,240
Tonight was the dog's turn
tomorrow will be Anju's, aunt.

541
01:05:56,285 --> 01:06:00,790
Not so fast, nephew. Let her
become 21 first.

542
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,793
- When will she turn 21?
- Very soon have patience

543
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,261
How will I wait so long?
Auntie?

544
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,798
The fruit of patience is sweet.

545
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,800
But when the
fruit is dangling...

546
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,802
..in front,
it's difficult to wait.

547
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,805
I want Anju!
I want to marry her!

548
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,272
You will get Anju.

549
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:26,270
Rascal! You son of a cab!
Where is he?

550
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,283
Come out.

551
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:35,780
He said," Manju, stop dancing.
Play the drums in a brothel.

552
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:42,287
... I' ll become the mistress of
a grocer! "Come out",.

553
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:48,793
See, All lndia star Manju
Michaeli Jacksoni is here!

554
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:07,311
- He's proud of his cab!
- Don't touch my cab!

555
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,859
Why take drinks
if you cannot handle them?

556
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:18,324
- l' ll buy a brand new Mercedes
cab and employ you as driver!

557
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:26,832
What do you think of yourself?
Come on or l' ll break your cab!

558
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,843
Damn!

559
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:36,340
He's really come!
Take, Drink.

560
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,891
She hit my taxi!
Damn you!

561
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,859
I' ll really beat her!

562
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:49,899
- Leave me.
- Tell me, where's Anju?

563
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:55,905
Enough! Don't touch this child,
master or I might do something.

564
01:07:55,905 --> 01:08:00,365
I' ll cut you to bits, and throw
you into a grave!

565
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,912
This is all your plot, scoundrel.

566
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,915
Master even a bird is not...

567
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,383
..so foolish as to remain in the
cage if her life is in danger.

568
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,887
- She was a human being!
- A human being?

569
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:16,881
You told her she was a human
being? It is your plot?

570
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,893
That is why she
ran away from here.

571
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,432
She didn't run away,
she became free.

572
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:27,436
If I had my way, I'd have opened
her cage years back!

573
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,438
What didn't happen for years,
how did it happen now?

574
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,896
Hwo did she escape these walls,
these guards?

575
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,905
If Suraj sees me, he' ll take
me back there.

576
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,937
Where are you going so late?
Is this stolen stuff?

577
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,929
- It belongs to me.
- Make us too belong to you.

578
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,936
One minute!
Brothers, just a minute.

579
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:17,486
You can do what you want
to her but first...

580
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,944
... Iet me do what l
want to do to you all.

581
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:52,988
Who is it?

582
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,497
Idiot!

583
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,009
- Stupid, you' re here!
- Don't move!

584
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:45,574
- He's got hurt!
- Show! It's a deep gash.

585
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,576
We' ll have to take him to the
hospital. I' ll get my cab.

586
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:54,038
- No, no. - Go quickly. God!
- See, I got hurt.

587
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:05,049
Can you help me? He's got hurt
We need a doctor.

588
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:11,100
So, she's with Suraj!
I' ll show her.

589
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,103
Don't foolishly say anything
in front of Suraj!

590
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,071
I' ll sort her later.

591
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:31,120
Halt! Halt!...Blood?
So, whom have you murdered?

592
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,122
Whom will I murder, sir?

593
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:37,126
Quiet!
Not in uniform and joking?

594
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:40,095
- Okay I won't. - Alright,
how much in your wallet?

595
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,632
Some one is hurt. Let me go.

596
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,635
You' re acting
smart with Sukhi Ram?

597
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:50,139
You must be carrying stolen
stuff so you want to scram.

598
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:54,599
Search the boot we' ll know
right away. Cracking jokes?

599
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:58,113
- Sir, there's a corpse here!
- A corpse?

600
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,114
What are you saying!

601
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,653
- l' m alive, sir.
- So, is she your government?

602
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:08,157
No, sir. she's Manju. She's
slightly crazy. Come out.

603
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,625
Come out,
draped a sari and got in.

604
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:18,122
- What were you doing in there?
- l' m not Manju, sir.

605
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:24,173
I knew it, a girl in the boot,
blood on clothes, no money...

606
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,176
- You were kidnapping her!
- l' m no kidnap...

607
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:31,135
Quiet! Come to the police
station. You also please come.

608
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:44,147
- What's he saying? - He's
saying the patient is sick.

609
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:48,652
He needs rest and must
not be moved at all.

610
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:58,662
- Okay, l' ll take leave.
- Me too.

611
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,676
- Where are you off to?
- To see the doctor out.

612
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,716
Where are you going? We have to
look after you hospitably.

613
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,685
- Hospitably?
- Yes, who' ll look after me?

614
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:16,180
You look after them while I take
care of the doctor outside.

615
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:18,693
I' ll be back soon.

616
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,202
Where are you going?

617
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,206
Where are you going?

618
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,211
- Do you have any problem?
- l' ll show you problem!

619
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,213
See!

620
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,754
- Stupid!
- No, child, no!

621
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:50,714
- I won't spare you! - Madam,
I apologize on her behalf.

622
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,761
Who does she think she is!

623
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,764
Punish me but don't
say anything to her.

624
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:59,723
- Leave me! - Child,
what' re you doing? Come.

625
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:04,273
- Come.
- I won't spare you!

626
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:08,777
Child, we have enough problems
without you adding to them.

627
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,779
If you hadn't stopped me! I'd
have pound her to bits!

628
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:14,283
Okay, my dear, but shouldn't you
think of the consequences.

629
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,286
- Listen to me child.
- I won't forgive her.

630
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,787
- Listen to me child.
- She beat me!

631
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,289
Will you keep blabbering or let
me also say something?

632
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:23,792
- You spoilt everything! - What?
We have problems as it is!

633
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,794
You are not listening
or understanding anything.

634
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:29,298
Do you know what happened
while you were away?

635
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,801
- They don't know me!
- Do you know about Raju?

636
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,269
- What?
- Yes, do you know how Raju is?

637
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:40,264
You don't.
Come, come. I' ll show you!

638
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:45,269
Raju son, see who's come?
It's your sister.

639
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:51,275
No, don't get up! Now she won't
go anywhere. You won't will you?

640
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,788
- Sister!
- Go, go.

641
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,291
What happened to him?

642
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:03,787
- He's running fever. - He's
cried himself to this state!

643
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,800
And master didn't give him food.

644
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:10,339
Why did they stop his food?

645
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:14,343
Because they thought he
knew where you'd run away.

646
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:15,844
And when he would no longer be
able to bear hunger,...

647
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:17,346
... he'd reveal your whereabouts.

648
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,847
Tortured his own son!

649
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,315
Now don't ever leave me, please.

650
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:27,356
They think you
are somebody else;...

651
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:31,315
... whom they need desperately.

652
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,320
Stay for a few days and watch
the fun see what the matter is.

653
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:41,325
And then you have to settle
scores with that fatso!

654
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:52,381
Alright, I won't go. Where the
father's heart is like stone...

655
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:58,342
... there you need a sister like
me. Now no one will starve you.

656
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,391
How many times do I tell you?
She's just pretending.

657
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,892
I know her, ask her.

658
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:08,852
Don't act smart with me!
Do you know him?

659
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,365
No, sir.

660
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:16,405
- You... You don't know me?
- No sir.

661
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,408
- You don't know me?
- I said once, I don't.

662
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:25,414
I' ll give you one slap. She's
drunk and acting on top of it?

663
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:31,375
- I don't drink liquor.
- lndeed! You....

664
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,924
You raise your hand on a woman!
On a woman!

665
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:40,384
Lock him up in a cell, one night
inside and he' ll gain senses.

666
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:48,392
- And me? - You go
home. I' ll deal with him.

667
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,405
Can't I stay here?

668
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,899
- I told you she's bonkers.
- You keep quiet! Take him away!

669
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:01,905
You've done no wrong so you
can't stay here. You go.

670
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:06,409
- Where will I go?
- To your house - House?

671
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:38,440
What's she doing here?
Using my make-up?

672
01:17:39,486 --> 01:17:42,944
Is this your father's that
you' re dolling up with it?

673
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:49,496
May not be! Maybe its your
father's so what if I use it?

674
01:17:49,496 --> 01:17:53,500
Back answering? Stayed out for
awhile and found your tongue!

675
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:58,178
I' ll show you. So what? I' ll
throw your bones to the dogs!

676
01:17:58,178 --> 01:17:58,460
I' ll show you. So what? I' ll
throw your bones to the dogs!

677
01:17:59,506 --> 01:18:02,475
Did you work
at a butchers earlier?

678
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,978
How dare you, you bitch!

679
01:18:06,513 --> 01:18:12,019
Your lipstick is imported but
your language lndian...

680
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:16,523
...& in our country everyone has
the right to speak his language.

681
01:18:16,523 --> 01:18:20,482
You spoke your tongue
now it's my turn.

682
01:18:26,033 --> 01:18:30,993
- Darling this is a dagger
what's it? - Dagger!

683
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:35,508
If it cuts you, blood oozes out.

684
01:18:36,043 --> 01:18:39,546
You've always done make-up
in your own style...

685
01:18:39,546 --> 01:18:44,506
... today l' ll make over your
face in my own style.

686
01:19:39,106 --> 01:19:41,074
Keep away the evil eye, god!

687
01:19:44,111 --> 01:19:47,080
Now smile and show. Smile.

688
01:19:48,615 --> 01:19:52,574
Smile lovingly now cry and smile.

689
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,587
Laugh loudly. Good.

690
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:01,628
- What happened to Suraj? Is he
fine? -Don't worry Mr.Viswanath.

691
01:20:01,628 --> 01:20:05,132
He's alright. I' ll drop
him home myself tomorrow.

692
01:20:05,132 --> 01:20:07,134
- Tribhuvan? - Yes.
I' m Tribhuvan speaking.

693
01:20:07,134 --> 01:20:09,136
- Listen.
- I am listening.

694
01:20:09,136 --> 01:20:11,104
I know that. you' re
speaking and l' m listening.

695
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:17,610
- What happened to you?
- Nothing. Who is it?

696
01:20:18,145 --> 01:20:21,148
- Amba!
- Amba isn't home, go away.

697
01:20:21,148 --> 01:20:23,650
- Then where has Amba gone?
- Me! I' m Amba!

698
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:27,609
Ghost! no. You' re not a ghost,
Mr.Viswanath. Go wash your face.

699
01:20:28,155 --> 01:20:32,615
You speak of washing my face?
I bathe daily unlike you!

700
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:37,164
I know you've had a bath, I have
not washed my face since morning.

701
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:42,124
- Go, go go. - Tribhuvan,
why are you tongue-tied?

702
01:20:49,676 --> 01:20:50,643
He's gone mad!

703
01:21:05,192 --> 01:21:08,695
- What happened? - l' m in
this house because of you...

704
01:21:08,695 --> 01:21:12,199
... and you disappeared.
See, l' m hurt.

705
01:21:12,199 --> 01:21:15,657
I could need anything and you
don't care one little bit!

706
01:21:16,203 --> 01:21:19,172
What do you want?
....What do you want?

707
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:27,214
- l.. I' m thirsty.
- Leave me!

708
01:21:27,214 --> 01:21:28,681
I' ll get water, leave me.

709
01:21:29,716 --> 01:21:30,683
Leave me.

710
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:33,686
He left me.

711
01:22:41,288 --> 01:22:43,790
" My heart pines for you"

712
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:45,257
" It's difficult
to live without you"

713
01:22:51,298 --> 01:22:53,766
" What do I do?"

714
01:23:04,311 --> 01:23:06,813
" lmmortalise your love"

715
01:23:06,813 --> 01:23:09,316
"Take my name and die"

716
01:23:09,316 --> 01:23:13,776
"That's the only cure for you,
O my crazy lover"

717
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:05,872
" From morn to night"

718
01:24:05,872 --> 01:24:08,375
" My heart chants only your name"

719
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:13,335
" What's so special about me
that's made you so crazy"

720
01:24:26,393 --> 01:24:31,353
" You are so beautiful,
I need you"

721
01:24:31,898 --> 01:24:33,866
" What do I do..."

722
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:35,417
" Your body is fire,
it has singed me"

723
01:25:40,967 --> 01:25:45,927
" Your talks make me swoon"

724
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:53,480
" Do I take that as your refusal,
or your consent"

725
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,948
" What do I do..."

726
01:26:49,035 --> 01:26:51,503
We've come at the right time.
Jaggu has come.

727
01:26:58,545 --> 01:27:01,047
You've come back brother?
Where were you all night?

728
01:27:01,047 --> 01:27:03,015
- In jail.
- Were you getting thrashed?

729
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:06,553
- Where's Manju?
- Don't take her name.

730
01:27:06,553 --> 01:27:09,055
I was in jail because of her.

731
01:27:09,055 --> 01:27:14,060
- l' m fuming at her name.
- What has she done?

732
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:18,019
What an actress!
Says, she doesn't know me!

733
01:27:18,565 --> 01:27:21,534
Has never seen me!
And then sat in my boot.

734
01:27:22,068 --> 01:27:26,027
I am fed up of her! I swear some
day, l' ll chop her to pieces!

735
01:27:27,574 --> 01:27:29,576
- And do you know what she says?
- What?

736
01:27:29,576 --> 01:27:33,079
What's that
liquor... no... wine.

737
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:36,537
She says I don't drink wine, sir.

738
01:27:38,585 --> 01:27:39,552
What's so funny?

739
01:27:41,087 --> 01:27:45,091
She's done one show and
thinks she's a great star!

740
01:27:45,091 --> 01:27:49,596
- l' m fed up of her!
- So now where's she?

741
01:27:49,596 --> 01:27:54,056
How the hell do
I know where she is?

742
01:27:54,601 --> 01:27:59,105
The police is also strange!
Locked me in and released her!

743
01:27:59,105 --> 01:28:02,563
- So, she didn't come with you?
- Yes, thank god...

744
01:28:06,613 --> 01:28:09,081
You! Get out!

745
01:28:10,617 --> 01:28:13,119
- Look Manju.
- My name is Anju.

746
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:16,088
- She's changed her name
overnight. - Oh!

747
01:28:17,123 --> 01:28:21,082
- What else have you changed,
mom? - l' m not your mother?

748
01:28:31,137 --> 01:28:36,097
If you are following me to beg
forgiveness,forget it & get out!

749
01:28:37,644 --> 01:28:42,148
- Where do I go? - That is your
house. Go and die there!

750
01:28:42,148 --> 01:28:47,108
- That's my house?
- Mother, that's your house...

751
01:28:47,654 --> 01:28:51,658
... and that's mine, that's
a tyre and this is Jaggu...

752
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:53,660
This is the earth and
that, the sky.

753
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,662
That's east and this west.

754
01:28:55,662 --> 01:28:59,666
- This is north and that south.
- I know that - What?

755
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:02,134
North, south, east and west.

756
01:29:02,669 --> 01:29:06,127
Will you go or should l
make over your face? Go!

757
01:30:52,779 --> 01:30:59,241
- Mr.Jaggu! - You, here,
at this hour? What do you want?

758
01:30:59,786 --> 01:31:01,788
Can I sleep here?

759
01:31:01,788 --> 01:31:04,256
Why? Are the bed bugs
playing in your house?

760
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:08,249
No,no. But l' m feeling
very scared, all alone.

761
01:31:10,296 --> 01:31:15,301
You are scared? The world is
scared of you!

762
01:31:15,301 --> 01:31:20,306
I won't bother you. I' ll
sleep here quietly.

763
01:31:20,306 --> 01:31:23,275
Okay, how does it bother me?
Go, lie down!

764
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:25,277
Thanks very much!

765
01:32:02,382 --> 01:32:03,906
Where were you the whole day?

766
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:05,540
Do you know what happened
in your absence.

767
01:32:05,785 --> 01:32:11,057
- What troubles have... - Not
so far but if you sit tight..

768
01:32:11,057 --> 01:32:14,356
... then there will be
the devil to pay!

769
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:18,489
Since she's come, she's
made life miserable!

770
01:32:18,798 --> 01:32:22,757
I' ll hit her so hard that
she' ll forget everything.

771
01:32:22,835 --> 01:32:24,029
Bring my hunter.

772
01:32:32,812 --> 01:32:37,772
You ingratiate! Now I know you
instigate Anju against us!

773
01:32:38,217 --> 01:32:40,276
You, old man, you!

774
01:32:45,425 --> 01:32:48,292
Wear it Tribhuvan,
wear this bangle.

775
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,836
The hands that think
its masculinity...

776
01:32:56,836 --> 01:32:59,600
... to beat an old,
helpless man...

777
01:32:59,839 --> 01:33:03,400
-...will look good with
this bangle. - Who are you?

778
01:33:03,843 --> 01:33:07,438
My name Maybe anything;
Sita, Sakina or Suzie..

779
01:33:09,348 --> 01:33:12,146
... Kamla, Vimla or Anju.

780
01:33:12,852 --> 01:33:14,217
How does a name matter?

781
01:33:18,191 --> 01:33:21,127
I' m just a woman who in
this world made by men...

782
01:33:21,127 --> 01:33:22,862
... is standing alone...

783
01:33:22,862 --> 01:33:26,320
... against the cruelty,
torture and bestiality of men.

784
01:33:28,534 --> 01:33:32,630
Till today I had bangles in my
hand while you had the whip.

785
01:33:33,139 --> 01:33:35,300
But today I've thrown those
bangles away.

786
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:37,877
Now they' ll be in your hands...

787
01:33:37,877 --> 01:33:40,846
... and this whip in my hands.

788
01:33:45,885 --> 01:33:49,321
How dare you!
Have you gone mad?

789
01:34:01,901 --> 01:34:03,459
You hit with these very hands
huh?

790
01:34:04,904 --> 01:34:07,338
Scream louder!

791
01:34:08,508 --> 01:34:10,476
Get up!

792
01:34:19,318 --> 01:34:23,152
Scream! Let the walls of this
house hear your screams.

793
01:34:23,422 --> 01:34:26,220
Let the whole country hear you!

794
01:34:26,926 --> 01:34:29,292
Let every man and woman hear.

795
01:34:30,596 --> 01:34:32,932
When a whip comes into the
hands of a woman then...

796
01:34:32,932 --> 01:34:35,935
... the world becomes
insufficient...

797
01:34:35,935 --> 01:34:37,630
... for people like you
to escape!

798
01:34:49,348 --> 01:34:52,715
Wear the bangle!
Wear it!

799
01:34:57,557 --> 01:34:58,524
Run!

800
01:35:13,973 --> 01:35:19,378
As long as l' m here, if I see
this whip,...

801
01:35:19,378 --> 01:35:21,938
... I' ll whip your skin off!

802
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,448
Grandpa, l' m very hungry.
Get me something to eat.

803
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:34,357
Yes, child, l' ll bring it.

804
01:35:42,001 --> 01:35:45,630
Don't come here.
The liquor has gone.

805
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:58,711
- Where are you going so late?
-I was getting house in the fear

806
01:35:59,018 --> 01:36:00,986
... Chhee! I was getting scared
in the house.

807
01:36:01,187 --> 01:36:03,781
I was looking for you only.

808
01:36:04,023 --> 01:36:10,394
- You also get scared Manju?
- l' m not Manju!

809
01:36:11,364 --> 01:36:14,333
- If not Manju, then who' re you?
- l' m Anju.

810
01:36:14,433 --> 01:36:16,264
There she starts again!

811
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:54,538
- Jaggu, what's happening?
- She must've had cheap liquor!

812
01:36:54,674 --> 01:36:57,336
She drinks daily
but never does this!

813
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:02,045
Yes, I too am seeing this
for the first time!

814
01:37:02,682 --> 01:37:06,550
May be, a ghost...

815
01:37:08,087 --> 01:37:11,648
It's possible, quite possible!

816
01:37:12,491 --> 01:37:18,726
- Now what do we do?
- There's only one cure.

817
01:37:19,098 --> 01:37:22,864
- Johny - Who's he, a dancer?
- No, an exorcist.

818
01:37:23,102 --> 01:37:27,471
- He' ll exorcise her ghost
- Yes. - Swear by me - Yes.

819
01:37:27,773 --> 01:37:29,400
Then lets call him.

820
01:37:40,519 --> 01:37:45,081
"O Ghost, leave her"

821
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:53,494
"Just wait"

822
01:37:54,133 --> 01:37:56,431
" I will control you"

823
01:37:58,137 --> 01:38:00,697
" Run away"

824
01:38:16,155 --> 01:38:22,321
"Someone explain to me,
I am confused"

825
01:38:30,503 --> 01:38:32,664
" l' m in trouble"

826
01:38:36,175 --> 01:38:40,737
" Amidst of ghosts
a lone girl like me"

827
01:39:39,238 --> 01:39:40,603
" I left the house..."

828
01:39:42,575 --> 01:39:44,372
"... I lost the way"

829
01:39:46,245 --> 01:39:51,547
" From the frying pan
into the fire"

830
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:07,221
" Now you will have my thrashing"

831
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:15,502
"This is true, I am not a ghost"

832
01:40:15,674 --> 01:40:18,507
" l' m a beautiful maiden"

833
01:40:19,278 --> 01:40:21,246
" l' m in trouble"

834
01:40:21,547 --> 01:40:25,643
" Amidst of ghosts
a lone girl like me"

835
01:41:39,959 --> 01:41:43,588
"The ghost deserves to
be thrashed"

836
01:41:45,364 --> 01:41:50,324
" You all seem like ghosts to me"

837
01:41:55,975 --> 01:41:59,342
"The messengers of death"

838
01:42:03,382 --> 01:42:04,679
" What did you say"

839
01:42:07,386 --> 01:42:10,514
" It's night during the day,
an unusual thing happened"

840
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:13,356
" What has fate done"

841
01:42:14,393 --> 01:42:16,657
" l' m in trouble"

842
01:42:19,398 --> 01:42:24,165
" Amidst of ghosts
a lone girl like me"

843
01:42:42,021 --> 01:42:46,390
"O Ghost, leave her"

844
01:43:11,717 --> 01:43:18,555
" Please forgive me,
Do justice to me"

845
01:43:26,732 --> 01:43:28,597
" I agree to whatever you say"

846
01:43:30,469 --> 01:43:32,437
" I recognize everybody"

847
01:43:34,073 --> 01:43:39,705
" Fate defeated me, I give up"

848
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:43,710
"The ghost has left"

849
01:43:44,483 --> 01:43:48,249
" Now stop this music"

850
01:43:56,495 --> 01:43:57,462
Shut up!

851
01:44:27,526 --> 01:44:32,293
My body is aching.
Press it a little.

852
01:44:36,135 --> 01:44:42,301
Such a long Balma! This manner
of yours drives me insane!

853
01:44:48,547 --> 01:44:52,506
- What else do I say?
- Not say but do.

854
01:44:53,552 --> 01:44:56,521
With these delicate hands
of yours..

855
01:44:57,956 --> 01:45:01,323
... attend to me.

856
01:45:02,561 --> 01:45:08,329
- Attend? - Don't you understand
massage me with oil.

857
01:45:09,568 --> 01:45:12,537
Once I'd told you and you'd
massaged me and that dog...

858
01:45:12,838 --> 01:45:17,707
... massage - I remember.

859
01:45:18,911 --> 01:45:23,814
But what hand do you
prefer soft or hard?

860
01:45:24,917 --> 01:45:28,148
I' m a man - no soft touch
for me. I want a hard massage.

861
01:45:29,588 --> 01:45:33,957
- You want a hard hand.
- Yes. She's trapped!

862
01:45:43,602 --> 01:45:45,900
Why are you closing the door?

863
01:45:46,004 --> 01:45:49,371
- To massage you!
- Massage!

864
01:45:54,613 --> 01:45:57,582
You want a massage?
Then shut your eyes!

865
01:46:00,219 --> 01:46:04,121
This is the hard hand
and this the soft one!

866
01:46:05,023 --> 01:46:09,392
- And now for the really
hard ones. - Help, help!

867
01:46:19,037 --> 01:46:20,004
Help!

868
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:36,019
- Batuk! - Balma - Whose?
- Yours - Not mine!

869
01:46:36,154 --> 01:46:42,093
- Who are you?
- l' m a small little, cute baby.

870
01:46:42,261 --> 01:46:46,891
- Oh! He's our Balma?
- See what Anju has done to him.

871
01:46:47,666 --> 01:46:51,432
Send him back to the village.
He's had it. I' m going.

872
01:46:53,672 --> 01:46:55,799
Mr.Jaggu!

873
01:46:59,278 --> 01:47:05,444
Chhee! How filthy! Everyone
keeps flowers; he; a broom!

874
01:47:18,697 --> 01:47:19,664
Kerosene!

875
01:47:27,706 --> 01:47:29,469
It seems to be some dirty,
stale water.

876
01:47:46,992 --> 01:47:56,025
Today is Sunday. So? It's
the day to drink liquor.

877
01:48:32,371 --> 01:48:35,340
Miss.Manju, what's in this?

878
01:48:36,775 --> 01:48:42,736
There was some horribly stinking
thing in it so I threw it.

879
01:48:43,048 --> 01:48:47,542
Oh! Horribly stinting?
Where did you throw it dear?

880
01:48:48,787 --> 01:48:50,550
- In the drain.
- In the drain?

881
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:53,915
My fifteen rupees worth
of liquor down the drain!

882
01:48:55,794 --> 01:49:00,094
- Then what's in this?
- K...ke...kerosene.

883
01:49:02,401 --> 01:49:06,269
- Did I do right?
- Get out or l' ll hit you hard!

884
01:49:07,806 --> 01:49:12,766
Forgive me please.
Hit me if you wish.

885
01:49:13,078 --> 01:49:19,574
Forgive me. If I knew you'd get
angry, I wouldn't have done it!

886
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:24,254
- What's in this?
- Food.

887
01:49:24,823 --> 01:49:28,782
- Where did you get it from?
- From out! No,l mean I made it.

888
01:49:29,428 --> 01:49:34,593
I thought you'd be
hungry, is it tasty?

889
01:49:34,833 --> 01:49:39,600
Yes but next time ask
me before you do anything.

890
01:49:39,838 --> 01:49:43,604
Okay can I keep this plate down?

891
01:49:43,842 --> 01:49:45,309
No keep holding it in your hand.

892
01:49:49,848 --> 01:49:53,807
- May I leave? - Yes.
- Can I take this? - Yes.

893
01:50:08,166 --> 01:50:09,428
Mr.Mathur?

894
01:50:12,871 --> 01:50:14,304
Good day, Miss.Anju.

895
01:50:17,876 --> 01:50:20,845
Miss.Anju, you' re
looking different today.

896
01:50:23,048 --> 01:50:26,984
And Mr.Tribhuvan, you too
look quite different today!

897
01:50:27,486 --> 01:50:32,446
- I hope you've feeling fine.
- The weather is affecting him.

898
01:50:34,392 --> 01:50:36,161
How strange! People are
affected differently...

899
01:50:36,161 --> 01:50:37,651
... by this change of weather.

900
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,868
Betel leaf. Will you have?

901
01:50:44,903 --> 01:50:46,461
Here.

902
01:50:52,911 --> 01:50:55,471
Here are your papers.
Sign then.

903
01:51:03,522 --> 01:51:06,685
- Where do I sign?
- What happened to your hand?

904
01:51:07,259 --> 01:51:10,490
The tanpura fell on it.
The whole instrument.

905
01:51:11,329 --> 01:51:14,059
Only this got saved-
the thumb, will it do?

906
01:51:14,533 --> 01:51:19,300
Will do. Why not?
I know you since childhood.

907
01:51:24,543 --> 01:51:27,910
- Here's your money.
- l' ll keep it.

908
01:51:32,284 --> 01:51:34,514
- These are mine?
- Of course.

909
01:51:36,955 --> 01:51:39,515
I' ll leave now.
Uncle isn't feeling too good.

910
01:51:44,563 --> 01:51:47,498
Anju, give this money to Amba.
She' ll keep it in the locker.

911
01:51:48,967 --> 01:51:53,927
Yes dear, times are bad
thieves abound all over.

912
01:51:54,973 --> 01:51:58,670
- That I can see. - Give it
here. I' ll keep it safe.

913
01:51:58,977 --> 01:52:03,607
I too can keep it.
Where's the key, Miss.Amba?

914
01:52:03,982 --> 01:52:06,576
- With Tribhuvan. - What?
The key is always with you!

915
01:52:06,985 --> 01:52:09,283
-I gave it to you in the morning
- But I retuned it by evening.

916
01:52:09,588 --> 01:52:12,751
My palm is itching.

917
01:52:12,991 --> 01:52:17,155
If don't get the key soon,
this will start off.

918
01:52:17,395 --> 01:52:19,556
Listen to me,
give her the key.

919
01:52:19,664 --> 01:52:21,564
Then what' ll happen to you?

920
01:52:21,666 --> 01:52:24,567
If you don't give the key, then
what will happen to you?

921
01:52:24,669 --> 01:52:27,638
- Did you think of that?
- This is no time to think Amba!

922
01:52:27,706 --> 01:52:30,140
In any case, what is in one key?

923
01:52:30,342 --> 01:52:35,143
- Everything! - Give up worldly
attachments and give her the key

924
01:52:35,347 --> 01:52:38,248
- Should l? - Yes!
- It's in your pocket.

925
01:52:39,017 --> 01:52:40,780
Here's the bunch of keys, Anju.

926
01:52:41,019 --> 01:52:43,112
Thank you, Tribhuvandas, loafer.

927
01:52:44,356 --> 01:52:45,789
Good that you came on time,
grandpa.

928
01:52:46,024 --> 01:52:48,652
Now on, you' ll keep these keys.

929
01:52:49,027 --> 01:52:51,393
- Keep these in the vault.
- But...

930
01:52:57,035 --> 01:52:58,662
Everything is beyond control.

931
01:52:59,037 --> 01:53:01,267
If we don't do anything,
we' re finished.

932
01:53:01,373 --> 01:53:04,809
I can't think
unless you keep shut.

933
01:53:05,043 --> 01:53:08,206
- Okay, think.
- Got it! - What?

934
01:53:09,047 --> 01:53:11,413
Food in the picnic and
double dose in the food.

935
01:53:15,654 --> 01:53:20,458
Double dose, my foot! I' ll add
something to your food that...

936
01:53:20,458 --> 01:53:23,825
... you' ll be floating
on clouds.

937
01:53:43,081 --> 01:53:46,710
" What had I planned,
and look what has happened"

938
01:53:50,088 --> 01:53:55,856
" Look for me,
I am lost somewhere"

939
01:53:57,095 --> 01:54:00,656
" Even I am lost somewhere"

940
01:54:01,099 --> 01:54:03,067
" We are doomed"

941
01:54:04,102 --> 01:54:05,330
" Doomed!"

942
01:54:10,442 --> 01:54:13,536
" We are doomed,
we are in trouble"

943
01:54:14,446 --> 01:54:17,882
" We are out"

944
01:54:19,517 --> 01:54:22,281
" Hey, control me, here I go"

945
01:54:31,529 --> 01:54:34,896
" Stop me if you can, here I go"

946
01:54:36,134 --> 01:54:39,103
" We are doomed"

947
01:54:40,138 --> 01:54:43,505
"Take your own procession,
here I go"

948
01:54:44,476 --> 01:54:47,502
" Where are you going
Come back"

949
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:49,777
" Wait, silly girl"

950
01:54:50,548 --> 01:54:51,913
"Oh, what a blunder"

951
01:55:01,493 --> 01:55:06,726
" Listen, Oh niece
- What is it, uncle"

952
01:55:08,166 --> 01:55:10,930
" I feel dizzy
- Shall I give a blow"

953
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:15,139
" I will tipsy
- What does your mind say"

954
01:55:16,174 --> 01:55:19,405
"Save my life
- Here, have this"

955
01:55:20,178 --> 01:55:23,636
" What is in this
- You know it"

956
01:55:24,582 --> 01:55:26,743
" Want me to die
- Go ahead"

957
01:55:27,185 --> 01:55:28,482
" And what do I do"

958
01:55:29,187 --> 01:55:32,418
" Pour cold water on my head,
here I go"

959
01:55:33,191 --> 01:55:36,160
"Oh what a blunder"

960
01:55:37,195 --> 01:55:40,562
" Hey, control me, here I go"

961
01:55:54,813 --> 01:55:58,180
"The earth spins,
so does the sky"

962
01:55:58,550 --> 01:56:02,179
"Something is wrong,
we' re getting hiccups"

963
01:56:06,825 --> 01:56:08,588
" We are doomed"

964
01:56:11,229 --> 01:56:13,356
"Show your enthusiasm"

965
01:56:14,833 --> 01:56:16,858
"Come in your senses"

966
01:56:19,237 --> 01:56:23,606
" l' m high,
It proved expensive"

967
01:56:23,708 --> 01:56:25,335
"Call the doctor"

968
01:56:26,244 --> 01:56:28,872
" Do one thing, Balma,
You die"

969
01:56:29,848 --> 01:56:33,215
" Praise the Lord, here I die"

970
01:56:34,252 --> 01:56:37,221
" We are doomed"

971
01:56:38,256 --> 01:56:41,623
" Hey, control me, here I go"

972
01:57:25,303 --> 01:57:28,602
"The flag fell off
- The stick remained"

973
01:57:29,307 --> 01:57:32,868
" Look what this is
- A hen's egg"

974
01:57:33,912 --> 01:57:38,076
"The pony runs, spins like top"

975
01:57:38,316 --> 01:57:41,285
"Classical music
- Deep sorrows"

976
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:45,551
" Evening time
- The bird is alone"

977
01:57:46,324 --> 01:57:49,691
" Your beloved Romeo
- Juliet is dead"

978
01:57:50,328 --> 01:57:53,695
" A maze
- Naughty admirer"

979
01:57:54,666 --> 01:57:57,897
" Your crazy lover
- Excuse me"

980
01:57:59,003 --> 01:58:02,097
" A pack of cards
- Let's go to Kolkatta"

981
01:58:03,341 --> 01:58:06,504
"See this drama, spectators
here I go"

982
01:58:07,345 --> 01:58:10,473
" We are doomed"

983
01:58:11,683 --> 01:58:14,117
Yes, Anju, I too love you
but my dad is in not in favour.

984
01:58:14,352 --> 01:58:19,722
Eloping is not the answer.
Try to understand, Anju.

985
01:58:20,358 --> 01:58:22,627
Okay l' ll talk
to dad once more,...

986
01:58:22,627 --> 01:58:26,586
... if he doesn't agree
we' ll run away.

987
01:58:27,365 --> 01:58:30,823
Son, with whom are you
talking about running away?

988
01:58:33,371 --> 01:58:34,599
With Anju, Daddy.

989
01:58:39,877 --> 01:58:43,335
Son Suraj, you are my only child.

990
01:58:43,982 --> 01:58:49,387
And I want you to be happy. I
had absolutely no idea that...

991
01:58:49,387 --> 01:58:52,754
... you love Anju,
with such fervour.

992
01:58:53,391 --> 01:58:57,760
If you wish, l' ll fix
your wedding with Anju.

993
01:58:57,862 --> 01:59:00,092
- Really Daddy? Then l' ll go
and tell Anju immediately.

994
01:59:00,198 --> 01:59:02,098
No, no, you sit. I' ll
call up and inform her.

995
01:59:07,405 --> 01:59:11,774
- What happened to the phone?
- It's been out of order.

996
01:59:11,909 --> 01:59:14,707
- Then whom were you talking to?
- I was rehearsing.

997
01:59:14,812 --> 01:59:18,839
But don't go back
on your word, Daddy!

998
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:24,185
Just like his father!

999
01:59:43,441 --> 01:59:44,806
Where are you taking me?

1000
01:59:44,909 --> 01:59:49,005
I' m taking you to meet an
important man; my boss!

1001
01:59:55,453 --> 01:59:59,791
Forgive me boss, in this cab
business and heavy traffic...

1002
01:59:59,791 --> 02:00:01,952
... I had no time
to come to see you.

1003
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:06,419
You know the world's problems.
So you know my problems too.

1004
02:00:07,465 --> 02:00:10,229
Wish. Not me, the boss.

1005
02:00:11,069 --> 02:00:15,165
You are my mother, father,
boss, friend, everything...

1006
02:00:15,473 --> 02:00:19,477
... so l' m telling you. I've
decided that next week...

1007
02:00:19,477 --> 02:00:21,240
... I' ll marry Manju.

1008
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:25,040
- I've got the cards printed.
- What are you saying?

1009
02:00:26,084 --> 02:00:27,244
Do you have any objections?

1010
02:00:29,887 --> 02:00:32,253
- But..
- Do I have any bad habits?

1011
02:00:35,493 --> 02:00:37,791
- Do you love somebody else?
- Chhee, Chhhee!

1012
02:00:37,895 --> 02:00:40,659
All over the world, girls are
growing old.

1013
02:00:40,798 --> 02:00:43,301
You won't find a boy like me
in the whole world.

1014
02:00:43,301 --> 02:00:44,666
Later you' ll repent.

1015
02:00:44,769 --> 02:00:46,504
If there's a problem,
and you want to refuse,...

1016
02:00:46,504 --> 02:00:48,802
... say so before boss.
Don't create problems later.

1017
02:00:49,907 --> 02:00:52,137
But I never refused!

1018
02:00:58,516 --> 02:00:59,813
Come!

1019
02:01:25,143 --> 02:01:30,308
How are you?
Fine, I hope.

1020
02:01:34,552 --> 02:01:36,554
You' re enjoying all this;...

1021
02:01:36,554 --> 02:01:39,523
... this house,
it's luxuries, the servants...

1022
02:01:40,558 --> 02:01:44,119
- Who won't enjoy it?
- Yes, who won't?

1023
02:01:45,062 --> 02:01:48,930
Specially when it's not your
own but somebody else's.

1024
02:01:49,967 --> 02:01:53,334
- What do you mean?
- Meaning this is Anju's house.

1025
02:01:54,572 --> 02:01:58,338
This wealth, these luxuries,
servants, everything is Anju's

1026
02:01:59,577 --> 02:02:02,341
And even Suraj!

1027
02:02:03,981 --> 02:02:08,816
No, not Suraj! Suraj!
Suraj is mine!

1028
02:02:09,987 --> 02:02:11,989
He loves you thinking
you are Anju...

1029
02:02:11,989 --> 02:02:15,049
... that too is Anju's debt
to you.

1030
02:02:15,193 --> 02:02:17,595
- What are you saying? - These
are Anju's leftovers that...

1031
02:02:17,595 --> 02:02:19,756
... you are getting
due to good fortune.

1032
02:02:20,198 --> 02:02:23,964
- No, no, no...
- What no, no, no

1033
02:02:24,602 --> 02:02:28,834
At least don't fool yourself.
You are fooling the others!

1034
02:02:30,608 --> 02:02:35,375
I didn't stay here by my own
will. They need me here.

1035
02:02:38,616 --> 02:02:44,384
No, they needed you but no more.
One doesn't wear a mask forever.

1036
02:02:44,956 --> 02:02:46,753
After the show, the
mask is taken off.

1037
02:02:48,626 --> 02:02:50,389
Now your show too is over.

1038
02:02:51,629 --> 02:02:55,588
Your welfare lies in revealing
your true self now.

1039
02:02:56,634 --> 02:03:00,934
Or don't you feel like returning
to the poverty of the slum?

1040
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:07,873
Bit me! Look Manju, if you don't
tell Suraj the truth...

1041
02:03:08,646 --> 02:03:11,342
... then the result
of the deceit will be terrible.

1042
02:03:14,151 --> 02:03:17,154
Look Manju, if you don't
tell Suraj the truth...

1043
02:03:17,154 --> 02:03:20,214
... then the result
of the deceit will be terrible.

1044
02:03:31,168 --> 02:03:33,432
I was coming towards your place.

1045
02:03:34,071 --> 02:03:39,031
- I too was coming to you.
- It was imperative to meet you.

1046
02:03:39,677 --> 02:03:40,803
For me too!

1047
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:46,639
Suraj, I don't want to keep
you in the dark anymore.

1048
02:03:47,018 --> 02:03:49,646
Why you! Nobody can keep
Suraj in the dark!

1049
02:03:52,189 --> 02:03:55,056
I want to tell you
everything truthfully, today.

1050
02:03:55,693 --> 02:03:59,459
Don't take the trouble.
I know the truth.

1051
02:04:01,699 --> 02:04:04,463
- What do you know?
- I didn't expect this from you.

1052
02:04:05,703 --> 02:04:09,332
Suraj! I was helpless!

1053
02:04:09,407 --> 02:04:12,274
At the hands of love?
That love seems very strong.

1054
02:04:14,712 --> 02:04:17,681
But I don't want to
lengthen this drama anymore.

1055
02:04:24,121 --> 02:04:29,423
- l' m very tired! - That happens
when you board 2 boats.

1056
02:04:29,994 --> 02:04:36,160
You are right. Leading 2 lives,
I've forgotten my real life!

1057
02:04:36,734 --> 02:04:39,862
You have probably forgotten
whom you are deceiving.

1058
02:04:40,137 --> 02:04:41,695
- Me, him or yourself?

1059
02:04:43,741 --> 02:04:47,745
- What are you saying? - Maybe
you are amongst those girls...

1060
02:04:47,745 --> 02:04:49,872
...for whom one man
is not quite enough!

1061
02:04:51,248 --> 02:04:56,117
What? You! You!

1062
02:04:56,354 --> 02:04:59,255
- You' re crossing limits!
- What limits have you left?

1063
02:04:59,757 --> 02:05:03,249
Such a dirty thing about me!
How could you even think?

1064
02:05:03,761 --> 02:05:06,457
If you can do dirty things,
can't I think of them?

1065
02:05:06,764 --> 02:05:09,130
What have I done?
What?

1066
02:05:09,266 --> 02:05:13,327
What you've done? What have
you done is unpardonable!

1067
02:05:13,771 --> 02:05:16,899
It's my decency that l' m
talking not killing you!

1068
02:05:18,776 --> 02:05:22,075
Look mister, I don't know
what you saw or didn't.

1069
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:24,782
But after seeing
this face of yours,...

1070
02:05:24,782 --> 02:05:28,741
... I don't want to talk to you.

1071
02:05:29,053 --> 02:05:31,351
- Now the truth is out!
- Yes, it is!

1072
02:06:06,223 --> 02:06:07,781
Give me some liquor!

1073
02:06:08,826 --> 02:06:12,057
- What did you say?
- Liquor! Give, quick!

1074
02:06:12,830 --> 02:06:15,196
- You' ll drink liquor?
- No, l' ll eat it!

1075
02:06:15,433 --> 02:06:18,527
Don't be miserly. Give
me a drink quickly.

1076
02:06:20,237 --> 02:06:23,297
Damn it! Tell me honestly.
What happened to your brain?

1077
02:06:23,441 --> 02:06:25,409
Don't spoil my brain!

1078
02:06:25,843 --> 02:06:27,606
Give me a half, quarter bottle,
whatever...

1079
02:06:28,179 --> 02:06:30,613
But you said drinking
is not good!

1080
02:06:30,848 --> 02:06:33,214
If you want to give me liquor,
give, don't yap needlessly!

1081
02:06:33,517 --> 02:06:37,078
I' m not asking for free.
I' ll pay you, later.

1082
02:06:37,455 --> 02:06:40,151
Why don't I understand
these women?

1083
02:06:41,358 --> 02:06:43,622
Sometimes they are so sweet,
at others so evil!

1084
02:06:44,195 --> 02:06:49,633
I' ll drink lots today.
I' ll die drinking.

1085
02:06:49,867 --> 02:06:52,203
Without drinking you create
a nuisance...

1086
02:06:52,203 --> 02:06:54,171
... if you drink and you' ll die!

1087
02:06:54,271 --> 02:06:57,331
There's nothing to
live for in any case!

1088
02:06:57,875 --> 02:07:00,241
You tell me, will you
give me liquor or not?

1089
02:07:00,377 --> 02:07:04,643
- You won't drink. - I will.
- No. - Yes.

1090
02:07:07,218 --> 02:07:09,015
He refuses!
What cheek!

1091
02:07:14,391 --> 02:07:16,188
- Got some rope?
- Yes, shall I bring it?

1092
02:07:20,498 --> 02:07:22,466
- Here.
- Thanks.

1093
02:07:23,901 --> 02:07:27,462
- What are you doing?
- Suicide!

1094
02:07:30,307 --> 02:07:35,540
You don't let me drink or die!
Then what do I do?

1095
02:07:35,913 --> 02:07:38,381
I don't want to be a
widower before marriage.

1096
02:07:38,916 --> 02:07:41,476
- What do you want?
- Liquor! Just now!

1097
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:54,693
You had given up then how come?

1098
02:07:54,932 --> 02:07:57,901
- How does it matter to you?
- Something is wrong.

1099
02:07:57,968 --> 02:07:59,299
No, it doesn't who' ll drink this?

1100
02:07:59,403 --> 02:08:01,894
I' ll drink, my wife and kids
will drink, what's it to you?

1101
02:08:02,106 --> 02:08:04,301
- Take this money. - I was
just asking. -....What?

1102
02:08:04,542 --> 02:08:07,238
Making inquiries!
Scoundrel.

1103
02:08:07,945 --> 02:08:11,312
It's so late. He hasn't
returned as yet!

1104
02:08:11,448 --> 02:08:13,313
He must be having
a drink himself.

1105
02:08:27,364 --> 02:08:30,925
- Jaggu what's this?
- Not for me, for my fiancee.

1106
02:08:31,969 --> 02:08:33,197
Disgusting!

1107
02:08:37,975 --> 02:08:40,273
Holy cow!
Now she's praying!

1108
02:08:46,984 --> 02:08:48,349
Changed her dress too!

1109
02:08:51,989 --> 02:08:54,116
Take, drink now.

1110
02:08:54,992 --> 02:09:00,157
Why, is it a custom to drink
wine before marriage?

1111
02:09:00,998 --> 02:09:04,957
From liquor, she's come to wine
Drink quickly now.

1112
02:09:05,269 --> 02:09:09,968
- You had given up drinking!
- So had you! - Me?

1113
02:09:10,341 --> 02:09:13,970
I don't touch wine.
You know that.

1114
02:09:17,414 --> 02:09:19,314
- They' ll break!
- Let them!

1115
02:09:19,617 --> 02:09:21,312
What happened to you
all of a sudden?

1116
02:09:21,418 --> 02:09:24,649
- l' m going insane with
happiness. - Then its okay.

1117
02:09:24,722 --> 02:09:27,156
What is? Now do you
want this or not?

1118
02:09:28,025 --> 02:09:31,791
No. Gandhiji said that
in life... - Quiet!

1119
02:09:32,429 --> 02:09:37,799
You' ll drive me mad! I' ll marry
you now before you change again.

1120
02:09:38,435 --> 02:09:40,494
Where are you going?

1121
02:09:41,038 --> 02:09:43,802
Gandhiji said return the bottles!

1122
02:09:45,042 --> 02:09:49,513
- Give me one 420.
- Sir I've heard of 120 and 300.

1123
02:09:49,513 --> 02:09:50,673
... but what is 420?

1124
02:09:50,748 --> 02:09:53,740
- Add the two. Result?
- 420 - Give me the same.

1125
02:09:54,051 --> 02:09:55,279
Hey, make one for him.

1126
02:09:56,053 --> 02:09:57,418
Good grief!

1127
02:10:00,057 --> 02:10:02,617
The best of guys get
floored on seeing her!

1128
02:10:02,726 --> 02:10:05,820
-She's the pride of our colony.
-The pride of your colony?

1129
02:10:06,664 --> 02:10:09,690
- Anju?
- Not Anju, but Manju.

1130
02:10:15,072 --> 02:10:17,370
You may hit me but
she's Manju of our colony.

1131
02:10:20,077 --> 02:10:23,843
- Aunt when did you come out?
- l' m getting better now!

1132
02:10:24,581 --> 02:10:30,315
- Have you seen Manju? - ldiot,
listen Manju is her daughter.

1133
02:10:30,387 --> 02:10:32,321
She's worshiping
Jaggu's taxi, Aunt.

1134
02:10:35,092 --> 02:10:38,653
Why is she worshiping
Jaggu's taxi?

1135
02:10:38,762 --> 02:10:42,562
Don't you know?
They' re going to get married.

1136
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:47,196
Yes Aunt, really, have
a sweet for this good news.

1137
02:10:59,516 --> 02:11:02,119
This glass looks so small...

1138
02:11:02,119 --> 02:11:05,350
... but must have gulped
a lot of bottles.

1139
02:11:06,457 --> 02:11:12,885
And with every bottle,
many sorrows, many unfaithful...

1140
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:14,688
Unfaithfulness?

1141
02:11:18,535 --> 02:11:20,901
One can measure a bottle by
the depth of the glass...

1142
02:11:21,138 --> 02:11:24,835
... but the depth of a woman's
heart can't be measured!

1143
02:11:25,409 --> 02:11:28,708
No one knows how much of
deceit and deception is there!

1144
02:11:29,646 --> 02:11:34,913
Whatever enters a woman's
heart is only to wound her.

1145
02:11:35,152 --> 02:11:38,713
One who doesn't have a
heart can't feel any wounds.

1146
02:11:40,157 --> 02:11:42,921
- l' m Balma speaking.
- Who?

1147
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,128
I' m a small, little, cuddly..

1148
02:11:46,497 --> 02:11:50,934
I've solved the case now I know
how that kitten became a lioness.

1149
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:54,399
- What? - Actually there are
not one but two litters.

1150
02:11:54,505 --> 02:11:55,938
What nonsense? Kittens!

1151
02:11:56,173 --> 02:11:58,539
Anju is standing here,
in a slum before my eyes.

1152
02:11:58,675 --> 02:12:03,476
- But Anju is here!
- She's Manju her twin sister.

1153
02:12:03,781 --> 02:12:05,582
If you don't believe me,...

1154
02:12:05,582 --> 02:12:07,641
... I' ll bring Anju
to the house right now.

1155
02:12:07,785 --> 02:12:09,480
And l' ll bring her mother too.

1156
02:12:09,787 --> 02:12:13,951
Don't do that! Bring
has to the Alibag house.

1157
02:12:14,191 --> 02:12:17,160
Alibag house?
Okay l' ll bring her right away.

1158
02:12:20,197 --> 02:12:21,755
The Alibag house?!

1159
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:26,429
Your to-be husband is in front
of you and you worship a cab?

1160
02:12:27,805 --> 02:12:31,502
Not Jaggu! Say Balma.

1161
02:12:32,543 --> 02:12:34,773
- Say Balma!
- Balma.

1162
02:12:35,212 --> 02:12:39,171
- Say my Balma.
- My Balma. - Yes!

1163
02:12:40,217 --> 02:12:44,984
- Daughter! - There,
the mother too has come.

1164
02:12:45,222 --> 02:12:48,316
- You too come along. Come
- Jaggu.

1165
02:12:51,228 --> 02:12:54,664
Brother, Gandhiji said
to return the bottles.

1166
02:12:55,833 --> 02:12:58,802
Hey John, thank you
very much. I' m getting married.

1167
02:13:02,739 --> 02:13:05,799
- You must come. Don't forget.
- But who's the girl?

1168
02:13:06,243 --> 02:13:09,940
It must be a special
girl who put down my meter.

1169
02:13:10,247 --> 02:13:12,681
Friend, but tell us who it is.

1170
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:15,614
She's a true lndian woman.

1171
02:13:15,853 --> 02:13:21,621
Like Savitri, Sakubai,
Anusuya, Meerabai.

1172
02:13:21,758 --> 02:13:24,022
She's always praying,
all the time.

1173
02:13:31,268 --> 02:13:34,829
Changed clothes again!
What are you doing?

1174
02:13:35,272 --> 02:13:36,830
Can't you see, l' m drinking?

1175
02:13:41,278 --> 02:13:46,045
I can't understand
when you pray & when you drink!

1176
02:13:46,283 --> 02:13:50,242
- l' m feeling dizzy
- Stupid ass!

1177
02:13:50,554 --> 02:13:53,045
I asked for a bottle and
you vanished.

1178
02:13:53,957 --> 02:13:55,424
Bottle, again?

1179
02:13:55,692 --> 02:13:57,250
Forgot what Gandhiji said?

1180
02:13:57,461 --> 02:14:01,591
Look if you want to drink, get
your own bottle.Don't bother me!

1181
02:14:02,299 --> 02:14:05,063
Next week we' re getting married
so don't talk like this!

1182
02:14:06,303 --> 02:14:07,395
Marriage?

1183
02:14:09,306 --> 02:14:11,934
- Whose marriage?
- Mine

1184
02:14:12,976 --> 02:14:15,274
How funny!
You' re getting married?

1185
02:14:18,882 --> 02:14:19,940
To whom?

1186
02:14:22,319 --> 02:14:23,479
You, who else!

1187
02:14:23,921 --> 02:14:28,085
- Me? - Yes.
- Drunk without drink?

1188
02:14:28,725 --> 02:14:33,059
Look, I've tolerated enough
if I get angry... then?

1189
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:35,962
Go, go whom are you threatening?

1190
02:14:36,033 --> 02:14:39,298
Why should I marry you?

1191
02:14:40,337 --> 02:14:44,706
Don't make me angry or l' ll
give you one slap on your face!

1192
02:14:47,344 --> 02:14:50,905
You son of a taxi lay
a finger on me and see!

1193
02:14:51,348 --> 02:14:54,909
- You want to see?
- Yes, I want to!

1194
02:14:58,355 --> 02:15:02,587
- Want to see more?
- Yes!

1195
02:15:03,026 --> 02:15:06,484
I have no one who' ll
save me. Beat me more.

1196
02:15:08,699 --> 02:15:11,133
Now if you raise your hand,
l' ll rip it out.

1197
02:15:12,369 --> 02:15:16,373
I also know one shouldn't
hit women but when the taxi..

1198
02:15:16,373 --> 02:15:20,139
..doesn't start it has to be
pushed. We marry next week.

1199
02:15:20,377 --> 02:15:22,345
... and now she's pretending.
- Again?

1200
02:15:22,546 --> 02:15:25,515
- When did I agree to marry you?
- l' ll show you!

1201
02:15:26,383 --> 02:15:31,013
See! See! You won't marry me?

1202
02:15:31,388 --> 02:15:33,356
Am I mad?

1203
02:15:33,790 --> 02:15:36,850
Bitch! In front of God
you accepted and now you deny!

1204
02:15:36,994 --> 02:15:40,361
She can never
belong to one man.

1205
02:15:40,664 --> 02:15:46,003
- What do you mean?
- You pretend to love me and...

1206
02:15:46,003 --> 02:15:49,530
Pretend to marry him.
- What? Pretending to love you?

1207
02:15:49,740 --> 02:15:52,174
- All false!
- Then what's true, this?

1208
02:15:52,409 --> 02:15:59,781
No, Manju has always loved
you and will only love you!

1209
02:16:00,417 --> 02:16:04,376
- Who is Manju? - She, who else?
what name did she give you?

1210
02:16:04,621 --> 02:16:06,646
Savitri, Anusuya, Sita.

1211
02:16:08,425 --> 02:16:09,983
But she is Anju!

1212
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:16,991
Jaggu, that Balma,
Auntie, kidnap, Manju.

1213
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:19,193
What nonsense is that?
Speak clearly.

1214
02:16:19,836 --> 02:16:23,067
Some Balma has
kidnapped Auntie and Manju.

1215
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:27,069
- But l' m right here.
- But you are Anju!

1216
02:16:27,444 --> 02:16:30,038
- I am Manju!
- One minute, one minute!

1217
02:16:30,113 --> 02:16:35,141
He was saying two kittens,
twins Anju-Manju...

1218
02:16:35,452 --> 02:16:39,411
- Twins?
- Twin sister?

1219
02:16:40,457 --> 02:16:46,828
Take care of this menace.
She's the root of our problems.

1220
02:16:47,464 --> 02:16:50,433
Finish her off! Once she's no
more, we' ll have no problems!

1221
02:16:50,734 --> 02:16:54,431
Uncle, let me go.
I've done nothing!

1222
02:16:54,738 --> 02:16:57,707
You haven't so far,
but now you will.

1223
02:16:58,475 --> 02:17:00,443
Today is your 21 st birthday...

1224
02:17:00,877 --> 02:17:04,881
... and according to
your father's will,...

1225
02:17:04,881 --> 02:17:07,441
... you inherit everything
today.

1226
02:17:08,485 --> 02:17:11,488
- What's written in it? - That
of your own sweet will,...

1227
02:17:11,488 --> 02:17:13,490
... without any compulsions,...

1228
02:17:13,490 --> 02:17:16,857
... you' re willing
the property over to me.

1229
02:17:17,094 --> 02:17:20,689
- You are, aren't you?
- No child, no!

1230
02:17:20,831 --> 02:17:24,130
- Don't sign or they' ll kill
you! - Quiet, old woman!

1231
02:17:25,502 --> 02:17:27,970
- Sign it, dear Anju!
- l' ll sign.

1232
02:17:30,507 --> 02:17:34,068
- Sign!
- Where? - Here.

1233
02:17:40,517 --> 02:17:42,883
Stop Jaggu! He's got
a revolver in his hand.

1234
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:45,488
- Then what do we do? - We' ll
think of some plan. Come.

1235
02:17:50,794 --> 02:17:52,785
Do you know
what's written in this?

1236
02:17:53,530 --> 02:17:57,762
That l' m committing suicide!

1237
02:17:58,535 --> 02:18:00,503
Wait Mr. Tribhuvandas, wait!

1238
02:18:04,941 --> 02:18:07,000
This signature is false,
so is the girl!

1239
02:18:08,545 --> 02:18:12,003
She's not Anju but Manju,
this taxi driver's Manju.

1240
02:18:12,549 --> 02:18:16,086
- Taxi driver's Manju?
- Yes, according to his plan...

1241
02:18:16,086 --> 02:18:17,917
Manju came and started
living in your house.

1242
02:18:19,556 --> 02:18:22,116
And he kidnapped my poor Anju.

1243
02:18:22,559 --> 02:18:26,325
- What nonsense are you talking?
- You' ll know soon. Talk!

1244
02:18:26,563 --> 02:18:31,523
- No.
- Will you talk or not?

1245
02:18:32,969 --> 02:18:34,334
You' re strange!

1246
02:18:34,571 --> 02:18:36,835
Put me in this situation
and watch the fun coolly!

1247
02:18:36,907 --> 02:18:38,807
Tell them
what's our relationship.

1248
02:18:39,576 --> 02:18:45,708
- Your relation with Anju?
- Not her, but her, my Laila...

1249
02:18:46,183 --> 02:18:50,347
... Amba.
- What? Are you bonkers?

1250
02:18:50,587 --> 02:18:53,351
Yes, that's why, in greed,
I listened to you.

1251
02:18:54,591 --> 02:18:57,958
Here, stay here yes,
tell me what did she say?

1252
02:18:58,595 --> 02:18:59,960
I' ll tell you all.

1253
02:19:00,096 --> 02:19:02,866
She saw me once
with Manju and came to me...

1254
02:19:02,866 --> 02:19:05,101
... and said send Manju
to my house...

1255
02:19:05,101 --> 02:19:09,197
... and they'd have murdered you.

1256
02:19:09,272 --> 02:19:11,570
And we' ll he 50-50
partners in the inheritance.

1257
02:19:11,641 --> 02:19:14,303
- Shall I go?
- He's lying!

1258
02:19:14,411 --> 02:19:16,743
- I never saw him before!
- Shameless!

1259
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:20,841
I' ll sort her out later.
First lets check out Anju-Manju.

1260
02:19:21,017 --> 02:19:24,851
- Tell us, who is she?
- She, she...

1261
02:19:25,021 --> 02:19:27,182
She's my daughter, Manju.

1262
02:19:28,625 --> 02:19:29,853
I' m Anju!

1263
02:19:32,629 --> 02:19:35,598
If she's Manju!
Where's Anju?

1264
02:19:36,633 --> 02:19:37,861
I know where she is!

1265
02:19:38,034 --> 02:19:39,399
She's waiting for him,
in the garden outside.

1266
02:19:40,637 --> 02:19:43,606
I'll get her in a jiffy.

1267
02:19:44,641 --> 02:19:46,199
I' m Anju!

1268
02:19:52,249 --> 02:19:59,621
No, no, no... I' ll do
as you say from now on.

1269
02:20:00,991 --> 02:20:04,620
She's genuine!
Then come up with me quickly.

1270
02:20:05,662 --> 02:20:08,290
How can I walk?
First untie my legs.

1271
02:20:08,665 --> 02:20:12,897
They tied me up
and went away Balma!

1272
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:18,630
- I made a mistake in judging
you. - What do you mean?

1273
02:20:20,010 --> 02:20:24,640
Meaning I didn't find
any good person in my life.

1274
02:20:25,682 --> 02:20:30,119
So I couldn't recognise
a good man with you.

1275
02:20:30,687 --> 02:20:34,958
What a sad thing! Both sisters
came together into this world...

1276
02:20:34,958 --> 02:20:38,655
...and will also leave together.

1277
02:20:39,362 --> 02:20:42,456
And with them will be
martyred this taxi driver!

1278
02:20:44,701 --> 02:20:46,259
What are you saying?

1279
02:20:50,106 --> 02:20:51,664
Doesn't matter!
I have another one.

1280
02:20:52,709 --> 02:20:57,408
You belong to me and I to you.

1281
02:21:04,721 --> 02:21:06,484
Deception! Deceit!

1282
02:21:07,724 --> 02:21:12,218
Today l' ll beat you so much that
you' ll never tease anyone again.

1283
02:21:12,329 --> 02:21:15,696
- Uncle!
- He's running away!

1284
02:21:18,735 --> 02:21:21,295
The girl got changed!
They've cheated us!

1285
02:21:21,738 --> 02:21:26,038
- Cheating Tribhuvan!
- I told you, he's a liar!

1286
02:21:26,743 --> 02:21:30,146
They' ll all die, at
my hands but dear Anju...

1287
02:21:30,146 --> 02:21:32,512
... you have to drink poison
according to the suicide note.

1288
02:21:32,749 --> 02:21:34,114
Amba, push it down her throat!

1289
02:21:35,752 --> 02:21:38,983
Jaggu! No, leave me!

1290
02:21:39,756 --> 02:21:41,189
I don't want to die!

1291
02:21:52,168 --> 02:21:55,137
Look after them!
Amba let us go.

1292
02:22:18,795 --> 02:22:21,161
Jaggu poison...

1293
02:25:30,987 --> 02:25:31,954
Sister!

1294
02:25:45,001 --> 02:25:49,700
- l' m very frightened!
- Don't be!

1295
02:25:50,006 --> 02:25:51,564
With me here
no harm will befall you.

1296
02:25:52,008 --> 02:25:58,243
- But they troubled me a lot!
- What?

1297
02:25:59,015 --> 02:26:05,477
They used to whip
me and injections...

1298
02:26:06,623 --> 02:26:10,787
-... and today...poison
- Poison?

1299
02:26:12,028 --> 02:26:14,792
- They forced me to drink
poison! - What!

1300
02:26:16,032 --> 02:26:19,798
- I don't want to die! Save me.
- Yes, sister.

1301
02:26:20,036 --> 02:26:23,802
I've found you after ages,
I won't lose you easily. Come.

1302
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:25,598
Come. I' ll take
you to the hospital!

1303
02:26:27,043 --> 02:26:32,003
You' ll go to the
hospital if I allow you!

1304
02:26:44,060 --> 02:26:45,027
Sister!

1305
02:26:57,073 --> 02:26:59,701
Your sister is almost finished.
Soon you too will be!

1306
02:27:00,076 --> 02:27:03,307
Leave me! Sister!

1307
02:27:13,423 --> 02:27:15,391
Sister! Leave me!

1308
02:27:49,392 --> 02:27:53,886
Jaggu, you take Anju to the
hospital l' ll manage things here

1309
02:28:06,142 --> 02:28:09,111
Manju, you check on
Uncle-Aunt, l' ll remain here.

1310
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:29,598
- Send me to my village.
- Why?

1311
02:28:29,832 --> 02:28:35,134
Because l' m a small,
little, cute, sweet baby.

1312
02:28:45,782 --> 02:28:48,444
I won't let you go. I won't!

1313
02:28:48,785 --> 02:28:49,809
How dare you!

1314
02:29:10,706 --> 02:29:13,971
You brought her just in
time. Soon she' ll be fine!

1315
02:29:39,035 --> 02:29:41,526
Tribhuvan was saved but
the law didn't spare him.

1316
02:29:43,239 --> 02:29:46,697
Jaggu took his boss's
blessings and married Anju.

1317
02:29:48,578 --> 02:29:51,376
And there Manju and
Suraj too set up a house.

1318
02:29:53,749 --> 02:29:57,742
And after exactly one year,
their children were born.

1319
02:29:58,254 --> 02:29:59,812
And that too, twins.

1320
02:30:06,262 --> 02:30:08,389
" He called my name"

1321
02:30:10,266 --> 02:30:12,564
" I held on to my heart"

1322
02:30:18,274 --> 02:30:21,971
" He teased me I turned away"

1323
02:30:22,278 --> 02:30:24,838
" What else could I do"

1324
02:30:26,282 --> 02:30:28,842
" He was standing in the street"

1325
02:30:29,285 --> 02:30:32,049
" He was after me since very long"

1326
02:30:40,696 --> 02:30:43,426
" He seemed very obsessed"
