1
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,440
Treguna, Mekoides

2
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Trecorum Satis Dee

3
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,080
Treguna, Mekoides

4
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,240
Trecorum Satis Dee

5
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,720
Treguna, Mekoides

6
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,880
Trecorum Satis Dee

7
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,400
Treguna, Mekoides

8
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,200
Trecorum Satis Dee

9
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,040
- You, there. Which way to Pepperinge Eye?
- Couldn't say, sir.

10
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,240
It said on the wireless to paint out
the signposts in case the Nazis drop in.

11
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm not a Nazi.
I'm a British officer.

12
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,560
That's what you'd say
if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?

13
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,680
Drive on, Corporal.

14
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
- Sorry to give you so many,
but you do have six bedrooms.
- Oh, no trouble, my dear.

15
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,080
Anything to get the poor things away
from those terrible bombings in London.

16
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,920
Come along, love.
Dear, scoot.

17
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,720
Hey, what about us?

18
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,640
- Oh, yes. What is your name, please?
- Rawlins, ma'am.

19
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,120
Rawlins? Rawlins.
Oh, yes, here we are.

20
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,720
Carrie, Charles,

21
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,640
Paul.

22
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,320
You're for Miss Price.
I'm expectin' her in.

23
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,520
Halt! Who goes there?

24
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,200
I won't be a moment.
Please don't touch anything.

25
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,560
Blast it, fellow!
Put down that ridiculous thing!

26
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,040
Bit of rust comes from
standing in the cellar.

27
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,000
How should I know you is
a British officer?

28
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,640
- Now, what's all this?
- They've just seen Fifth Columns around here.

29
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,280
Claims he's lost,
asking suspicious questions.

30
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,240
Madam, will you tell this man
that I'm Captain Ainsley Greer,

31
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,600
attached to army headquarters
at Tidbury,

32
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,200
and I'm not to be menaced
by that grotesque object!

33
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,640
- Please be calm, Captain.
- I'm exceptionally calm,

34
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,640
if one considers,
as we stand dithering here,

35
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,040
our country is
in the grip of crisis.

36
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,880
There's an immediate
prospect of invasion, however remote,

37
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,080
but dash it, anyway, I choose
this godforsaken part of the country!

38
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,600
Captain, we may have been out of things
for the last few hundred years,

39
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,120
but we pride ourselves on
the history of this village.

40
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,040
May I remind the captain,
during the eighth and ninth centuries,

41
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,200
the marauding Danes frequently
came ashore in this precise area.

42
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,480
Fascinating. Now may I inquire,
who is in charge here?

43
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,440
I am postmistress and chairman
of the War Activities Committee.

44
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,240
Oh, you don't also command
the Home Guard, do you?

45
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,400
I do not. That is
General Sir Brian Tiegler,

46
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,160
late of His Majesty's
Royal Northumberland Fugleliers.

47
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,240
Call out the navy
Call out the ranks

48
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,120
Call out the air force
Call out the tanks

49
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,240
From the Cliffs of Dover
Call up the gulls

50
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,600
And don't forget
the loyal territorials

51
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,640
But who's digging in here
Who will defend

52
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,760
Every inch of England
no matter what they send

53
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard

54
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,000
The soldiers
of the old Home Guard, that's who

55
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,120
The soldiers
of the old Home Guard

56
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,480
For we wrote the story
of the old brigade

57
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,680
We know the glory
of yesterday's parades

58
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,680
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard

59
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,880
The soldiers
of the old Home Guard, that's who

60
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,560
The soldiers
of the old Home Guard

61
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,720
Parade, ready. Halt!

62
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,200
Permission to dismiss
the parade, sir!

63
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,920
Carry on, Sergeant.

64
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,720
Parade, dismissed!

65
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,280
Captain Greer, sir,
from headquarters at Tidbury,

66
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,440
here to check military
preparations in the area.

67
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,280
Tell them Pepperinge Eye
has matters well in hand.

68
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,200
But nevertheless, I...

69
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,640
What on earth is that?

70
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,040
Good morning, General.
I received your message, Mrs. Hobday.

71
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,200
I assume that my parcel
has arrived.

72
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,120
- It's in the office.
- Ah, lovely.

73
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,280
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.

74
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,840
Her late father
served with me at Vimy Ridge.

75
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,240
What does she burn in this thing?
It smells a bit like sulphur.

76
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,480
Ridiculous. One can't make
motor fuel out of sulphur.

77
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,240
Here we are- another object
from Professor Emelius Browne in London.

78
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,160
Thank you.

79
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,440
- Is it what you expected?
- I imagine so.

80
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,440
Professor Browne sent you
a cat last time, did he not?

81
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,360
Yes.

82
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
- Professor Browne is well?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Are we to have the pleasure
of meeting him?

84
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I very much doubt it. I don't know
Professor Browne personally.

85
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,720
- Was there something else?
- As a matter of fact, there is.
Would you come this way?

86
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,320
- Well, I'm very anxious
to get home, you know.
- Come along, please.

87
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,520
Get down, Charlie.
I want to ride!

88
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,040
Stop it this instant!

89
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,680
Children, this is Miss Price.

90
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,400
- Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins
all the way from London.
- How do you do?

91
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,160
- How are you, miss?
- Hello.
- Hi.

92
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
The government are trying to evacuate
as many children as possible into the country.

93
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,680
- Very sensible of them.
- Today they sent us 45.

94
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,520
And I've had to find homes
for all of them at very short notice.

95
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,360
These are the last three. All right,
children, pick up your things.

96
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,800
You're not suggesting that I should
take these children into my house?

97
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,000
- Exactly.
- Oh, I'm sorry, but that's
quite out of the question.

98
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,960
Children and I don't get on.

99
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,360
I believe you, miss.
Come on, back to London.

100
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,320
- Hooray!
- Be quiet!

101
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,760
- Besides, I have work to do.
Very important work.
- Uh, Miss Price.

102
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,080
You do have that
entire house to yourself.

103
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,320
And according to the order of the ministry
of civil defense, you have no choice.

104
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,280
I see. Very well.

105
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,200
If that is the case, I shall take them
into my house with the understanding...

106
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,040
that you find a more suitable home
as soon as possible.

107
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,000
Fine. Come along.

108
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,480
- Uh, good morning, Miss Price.
- Good morning.

109
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,240
There they are! Miss Price,
what a charitable thing you are doing,

110
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,880
taking in these poor unfortunates
from the city.

111
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,040
- Hold this very carefully.
- I wonder, Miss Price,
if I may drop by later this afternoon.

112
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,200
- Why?
- We have their spiritual needs to consider now.

113
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,040
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.

114
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,160
Ooh!

115
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,800
Upon occasion, one does feel
alarm for Miss Price,

116
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,360
alone, unprotected,
living in that desolate lane.

117
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,000
One does admire her
so tremendously.

118
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,880
One also admires
Miss Price's sturdy house,

119
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,360
the four acres of desirable land and
the fine prospect overlooking the sea.

120
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,880
Does one not?

121
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,800
I shall be frank.

122
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,160
One needs an anchor
of domesticity,

123
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,280
a feeling that one has
a cozy place to return to...

124
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,840
as one fares forth
to do heaven's work.

125
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,720
Oh, how is the vicar?

126
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,000
His wound is better, thank you.

127
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Oh, how marvelous for the vicar...

128
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,240
to be struck down not
in his gathering old age,

129
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,520
but on the field of battle,

130
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,120
bringing in the wounded
and the helpless.

131
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,800
Will you be taking his place?
In the army, I mean.

132
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,840
Alas...

133
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,400
if I only could.

134
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,360
My quinsy, you know.

135
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
My parcel, please.

136
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Bring your things inside.

137
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,040
Bit murky, ain't it?

138
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,160
Yeah. Not another house
around here for miles.

139
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,840
Wipe your feet.

140
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,680
Big place, this.
Who else lives here?

141
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,000
I live alone.
It suits my purpose.

142
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,000
All right.
Come along, everybody.

143
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,280
Sorry, miss.
The cat startled us.

144
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,520
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him, that's all.

145
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,560
Yes, scared to death.

146
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,360
You can see that.

147
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,720
- What do you call your cat?
- I don't believe in giving
animals ridiculous names.

148
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,480
I call him Cosmic Creepus,
because that's the name he came with.

149
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,680
You will sleep in here.

150
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,360
This was my father's bedroom, and I want you
to be very careful of everything in it.

151
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,200
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.

152
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,120
- What was your name?
- It's Carrie, miss.

153
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
- Carrie, you sleep on the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.

154
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,760
- Is that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down with frillies.

155
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,920
Travel light, that's us.

156
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,760
Well, I don't think
this arrangement is going to work,

157
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,560
but it seems that
I have no alternative.

158
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,200
- We'll do our best, miss. Really, we will.
- Thank you, Carrie.

159
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,440
The bathroom is along the landing.
Supper is at 6:00.

160
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,560
- You will wash thoroughly-
- Wash?

161
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,160
You will wash yourselves,
otherwise there will be no supper.

162
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,080
Is that clear?

163
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,240
- A house of horror,
that's what we've come to.

164
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,280
I'll get his clothes, okay?
I'll get your clothes.

165
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,200
Please don't bother to whisper.
I am exceptionally keen of hearing.

166
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,520
You are planning
to run back to London.

167
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,600
If you have any more plotting
to do, please do it elsewhere
where I shan't have to listen.

168
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,320
I want you all to sit down after
supper and write to your parents
and tell them that you are well.

169
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,000
- We has no parents, Miss Price.
- Who do you live with then?

170
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,680
Aunt Bessie.
She took care of us.

171
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,440
Still, she wasn't even
a real aunt, was she?

172
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,920
But don't you know anything
about your own parents?

173
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,320
I don't remember anything. Aunt Bessie
knew once, but she don't anymore.

174
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,720
Why is that?

175
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,640
Three nights ago, the bombs
were gettin' a bit close,
so I took Charlie and Paul...

176
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,520
down to the underground
to sleep.

177
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Aunt was working late, and she got home
the same time as one ofJerry's bombs.

178
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,680
I'm sure your aunt
was a very kind woman.

179
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,880
Yes, ma'am, she was.

180
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,600
I'm afraid I don't know much
about what children eat.
You'll have to make do as I do.

181
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,200
Is there anything particular
that you fancy?

182
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,720
Sausage and Mash. Bubble and Squeak.
Toad in the Hole.

183
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,640
Fried fish.
Oh, anything at all.

184
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,800
I'm afraid you won't find
any fried foods in this house.

185
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,040
- No fried food?
- No.

186
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,560
- How do you keep your health?
- What's all that?

187
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,560
Cabbage buds, rose hips,

188
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,040
glyssop seed, elm bark, whortle yeast
and, uh, stewed nettles.

189
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,320
And in the pot there,
mango wuzzle jam.

190
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,280
Mango wuzzle?

191
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,680
Yes, very nourishing.

192
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,600
For what we are about to receive,
let us be truly thankful.

193
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
"Dear madam,
with this shipment,

194
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,840
the Emelius Browne
Correspondence College of Witchcraft...

195
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,720
sends you its heartiest
congratulations on qualifying...

196
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,120
for the first degree
of your chosen calling.

197
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,000
You may now call yourself
'apprentice witch'.

198
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,600
Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne".

199
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,400
My first broom.

200
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,600
Time to go.
Everybody up.

201
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,360
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.

202
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,120
Now, let's see
how we fly this thing.

203
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,080
Here we are.

204
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,120
"Clasp the broom
with both hands".

205
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,040
Yes, of course.

206
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,600
"No, never astride the broom".
Yes, of course.

207
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,520
"Technically a witch
is always a lady,

208
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,440
except when circumstances
dictate otherwise.

209
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,960
Take an easy, graceful,
sideways position".

210
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,880
Of course.
That's much better.

211
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,320
An easy, graceful,
sideways position.

212
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,280
There we are.
How's that?

213
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,160
"Now, to start up the broom,
your basic formula-

214
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,200
Lakipo, Nikrif,
Scrumpet, Leetch!"

215
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,280
I wasn't ready.

216
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,880
"Lakipo, Nikrif, Scrumpet, Leetch".

217
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,120
Now watch this.

218
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,560
Here we go.

219
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,560
Lakipo, Nikrif,
Scrumpet, Leetch!

220
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,200
It's going to be
a little different this time.

221
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,800
All right.
I know it's not ladylike.

222
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,400
Lakipo, Nikrif,
Scrumpet, Leetch!

223
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,760
- Cor!
- What's the matter?

224
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,200
- How does she do that?
- 'Cause she's a witch.

225
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,920
- That's the sort of thing witches do.
- Oh.

226
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,720
She don't fly good, do she?

227
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,360
She's crashed!

228
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,720
Come on!
Now's our chance to hop it.

229
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,120
- Suppose she's hurt?
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.

230
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,400
Look out!

231
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,160
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.

232
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,280
Hang on.
I'm havin' a bit of a think.

233
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,440
A witch she is, says you.

234
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,000
Then let's use
the old loaf, says I.

235
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,520
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.

236
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,920
She don't want anyone
to know she's a witch, does she?

237
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,160
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.

238
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,440
And I intend to
make the most of it. Come on.

239
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,240
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.

240
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,880
Very healthful, I'm sure.

241
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,840
Hurt your foot, Miss Price?

242
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,760
Oh, just twisted my ankle.

243
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,400
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. It's nothing serious.

244
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,400
Lovely weather
for flying last night.

245
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,760
Why did you say that, Charles?

246
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,040
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are.

247
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
I see.

248
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,880
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on ya.

249
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,800
Thank you.

250
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,720
I should be most grateful if you
didn't tell anyone in the village.

251
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,000
Of course, there'll have to be one
or two little changes made around here.

252
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,280
I mean, I'd like to see
an occasional sausage on the table here,

253
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,200
a bit of strawberry jam.

254
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,720
- Charlie!
- Let me handle this.

255
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,720
And another thing, Miss Price.

256
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,760
There'll be no more of this
wash, wash, wash, morning and night.

257
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
Anything else?

258
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,960
Now you mention it,

259
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,200
I could do with
a bit of lolly.

260
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,640
Lolly?

261
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,520
Cash. Cold, hard cash.
You must have buckets of it.

262
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,920
For your information,
the most accomplished of witches...

263
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,840
can't make money
out of thin air.

264
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,520
Have you ever heard
of a rich witch?

265
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,880
Be that as it may,
you don't want us to blab, do you?

266
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,640
Have you considered
what danger you might be in?

267
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,560
I am a witch, you know.

268
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,960
What will you do, turn me into a toad?

269
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,440
Lovely.
A toad with pink eyes.

270
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,760
I might just do that.

271
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,480
- Go on, then. I dare you.
- Very well, Charles.

272
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,560
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.

273
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,680
She can't even ride
a proper broom.

274
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,120
Excuse me, Charles.

275
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,920
"Filigree, Apogee,

276
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Pedigree, Perigee".

277
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Oh, Charlie!

278
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,880
That's better than a toad.
That's a rabbit!

279
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,520
Bother! I never seem
to be able to manage toads.

280
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,440
Stop! Leave him alone!

281
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,760
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- Oh, not to worry.
My spells don't last very long.

282
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,760
I'm just an apprentice witch,
you know.

283
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,680
Look out, Charlie!

284
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,200
You flaming brute!

285
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,120
I'll teach you
to do that to me!

286
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,440
Let Cosmic Creepus alone.
It weren't his fault.

287
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,200
I'm afraid it's my fault. Bad enough
not being able to manage a broom.

288
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,840
I can't perform
a simple, basic spell.

289
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,920
You dared her to do it.
I don't see why we can't all be friends.

290
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,240
- Maybe she's not a wicked witch.
- Of course I'm not.

291
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,760
- See?
- If only I could trust you.

292
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,920
You see, the work I'm doing
is so important to the war effort.

293
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,720
- How do you mean?
- I mean exceptionally important.

294
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,640
Most secret.

295
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,120
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.

296
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,280
Yeah. If someone
made it worth our while.

297
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,960
I don't follow.

298
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,840
Simple-you give us
something valuable to seal the pact.

299
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,400
Oh, Charlie,
don't try to be clever again.

300
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,160
It's for her own
protection, ain't it?

301
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,080
If we broke the pact, we'd have
to give back the valuable object.

302
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,120
I think it's an excellent idea.

303
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,040
I wonder what
I could give you.

304
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,200
Would you settle
for one of my spells?

305
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
Bet that's not worth much.

306
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,080
Come with me.

307
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,080
I like you better
as a rabbit, Charlie.

308
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,000
- Shut up, you.
- Well, I never had a rabbit.

309
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,280
This is my workroom.

310
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,720
No one has ever seen it before.
Come along.

311
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,560
It's all right.

312
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,480
Careful what you touch in here.

313
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,560
Rum sort of place, ain't it?

314
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,400
When I signed for my witchcraft course,
there was a free bonus...

315
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,440
a certain marvelous traveling spell,
if you paid promptly in advance.

316
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,960
- I think I'll give you that one.
- Is it valuable?

317
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,720
Certainly.

318
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,400
Poisoned dragon's liver?

319
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,800
Poisoned dragon liver.

320
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,080
You mean, you poison the dragon
or just the liver?

321
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,600
Well, it comes prepared.
It's part of the school equipment.

322
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,360
Ah, here we are.
The traveling spell.

323
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,160
All right, everybody,
gather around.

324
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,480
All right, now, let's see.

325
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,160
Does any one of you have a bracelet
or a ring or something...

326
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,080
that you can twist?

327
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,080
- No, Miss Price.
- What about you, Paul?

328
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,720
Always carry a few things
around with me.

329
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,080
Never know when they
might come in useful.

330
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,960
Piece of blue glass,
lovely bit of string.

331
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,360
Horseshoe nail.

332
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,760
- What's that?
- Knob come from the bed upstairs.

333
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,680
- It twists, don't it?
- Yeah, it twisted right off.

334
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,080
Yes, I think that
will be all right.

335
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,200
Carrie, turn the light
down a little bit, will you?

336
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,800
Hellebore, Henbane, Aconite.

337
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,360
Glowworm fire, firefly light!

338
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,880
There. Isn't that pretty?

339
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,040
Is that all we get?

340
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,920
This knob will now work
the famous traveling spell.

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,880
And what's the famous
traveling spell?

342
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,960
How does it work?

343
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,560
Well, you take this knob
and put it back on the bed upstairs,

344
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,520
then turn it smartly
a quarter turn to the left.

345
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,240
Then in a firm, clear voice,
tell it where you want to go,
and the bed will take you there.

346
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,560
- Go on!
- Miss Price, will it, really?

347
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,040
Well, I see no reason
to think otherwise.

348
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,560
Oh, thank you
for the lovely gift.

349
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,560
Oh, I'm sorry, but it does belong to Paul.
He's the only one who can work the spell.

350
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,920
- Me?
- Yes.

351
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,000
That's right.
Mine, weren't it?

352
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,400
- That's the way the spell works.
- Nice mess he'll make of things.

353
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,200
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.

354
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,240
But mind you don't try anything
with the bedknob until I get back.

355
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,640
Good morning, Miss Price.

356
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,280
I was just admiring the sound
workmanship of your lovely house.

357
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,440
- Yes?
- I was in the village...

358
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,400
and as I was taking
my morning constitutional,

359
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,360
Mrs. Hobday asked if I might...

360
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,320
deliver this letter to you.

361
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,040
Oh, and I must say I did welcome the opportunity
of having another chat with you.

362
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,000
- I always find them so refreshing.
- Thank you very much.

363
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,400
Dear Madame,
it grieves me to inform you...

364
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,680
that due to the war we have been forced
to close down our college of witchcraft.

365
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,560
This means that we shall not
be sending you the final lesson...

366
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,440
in which you expressed
so much interest.

367
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,600
We were wondering what was keeping you.

368
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,920
- I've had some very bad news.
- Is there anything we can do?

369
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,600
No. No, thank you.

370
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,520
Yes.

371
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,480
- Yes, there is something that Paul can do.
- Me?

372
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,680
Paul, I need the bedknob back.
I must get to London immediately.

373
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,520
No, I want to go
to the jungle.

374
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,920
- Oh, I know, but-
- Wait a moment.

375
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,400
- I'll handle this.
- Charlie, be careful.

376
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,520
What you're saying, Miss Price,
is you now wish to take the object...

377
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
which you gave
to an innocent child...

378
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,240
and get him mixed up
in some kind of witch's hanky-panky.

379
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,120
Well, yes, in a way, but-

380
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,680
Well, a few odd shillings
might fix matters up, as you might say.

381
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,560
No, Charles.
Money has got nothing to do with it...

382
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,360
and, as a matter of fact,
neither have you.

383
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,280
Come with me, Paul.

384
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,760
Now, Paul, ridiculous as it
may seem to have to explain
this to a six-year-old child,

385
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,080
- but I do need your help.
- Go ahead.

386
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,920
I was expecting
a very important spell in the mail...

387
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,160
from my teacher, Professor
Emelius Browne, and it hasn't come.

388
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,600
What's that got to do
with my knob?

389
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,560
I must go to London immediately
and see Professor Browne.

390
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,000
With his help, we may be able
to bring this war to a successful end.

391
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,880
That is why I need the knob.

392
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,280
What is your decision?

393
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,880
Thank you, Paul.

394
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,320
I brought this for your hair, Carrie.
It may be windy.

395
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,640
Thank you.
Oh, it's ever so nice.

396
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,120
Paul, have you been
to the bathroom?

397
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,040
- Twice.
- Good.

398
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,320
Charles, you better put on something
warmer. The bed may travel quite fast.

399
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,600
I'm not going.
I'm staying right here.

400
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,440
But why, Charlie?

401
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,640
All that rubbish about a traveling bed.
It won't work.

402
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,760
- That's why.
- Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.

403
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,120
We don't want to scratch the wall
when we take off, do we?

404
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,400
Now, how's a ruddy big bed
like that gonna get out of this room...

405
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,320
with those little windows?

406
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,680
I don't know, Charles.

407
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,680
There's a great many things
about magic that I don't know.
We'll just have to find out.

408
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,880
Lovely. Just so's
you leave me out of it.

409
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,400
I don't fancy
making a fool of myself.

410
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,400
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun anymore.

411
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,240
Help me to tidy up the bed, Carrie.
We don't want to go to London
with an unmade bed.

412
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,040
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve.

413
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,280
I see. That's what my father used
to call "the age of not believing".

414
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,240
What's that supposed to be?

415
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,000
When you rush around
in hopeless circles

416
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,520
Searching everywhere
for something true

417
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,640
You're at the age
of not believing

418
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,600
When all the make-believe
is through

419
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,160
That's Charlie to a "T."

420
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,520
When you set aside
your childhood heroes

421
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,920
And your dreams are lost
upon a shelf

422
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,520
You're at the age
of not believing

423
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,480
And worst of all
you doubt yourself

424
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,320
Throw that
into the wastebasket.

425
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,760
You're a castaway
where no one hears you

426
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,160
On a barren isle
in a lonely sea

427
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,640
What's that supposed to be,
poetry?

428
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,800
Where did all
the happy endings go

429
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,120
Where can all
the good times be

430
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,040
Everyone on the bed
who's going.

431
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,400
You must face the age
of not believing

432
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,400
Doubting everything you ever knew
The knob, Paul.

433
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,040
Until at last you start believing

434
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,160
There's something wonderful in you

435
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,080
Lovely sentiment,
I'm sure.

436
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,240
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.

437
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,440
Now, when I say go,

438
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,200
tap the knob three times
and turn it a quarter turn to the left.

439
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,920
- Left.
- That's it.

440
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,040
Now, we better hold on tight.

441
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,680
The behavior of the bed
is something I'm not quite sure of.

442
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,400
Here, let me breathe a little.

443
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,600
All right, Paul?
Ready... go.

444
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,320
One, two, three.

445
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,440
Nothing happened.

446
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,080
- That's very odd.
- I told you it wouldn't work.

447
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,560
Of course.
How stupid of me.

448
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,280
We didn't tell the object
where we wanted to go.

449
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,840
Now, Paul, repeat after me.

450
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,720
Take us to Professor
Emelius Browne.

451
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,400
Take us to Professor...

452
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,440
- Emelius Browne.
- Very good.

453
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,400
Headmaster,

454
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,240
Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.

455
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,800
Headmaster,
Correspondence College...

456
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,720
Of Witchcraft, London.

457
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,360
Of Witchcraft, London.

458
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Now, go.

459
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,480
One, two, three.

460
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,000
- Is this London?
- Of course it is.

461
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,480
- Can't you smell that lovely sooty air?
- Marvelous, ain't it?

462
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,440
- Well, Charles, are you convinced by now?
- Not yet, I ain't.

463
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,280
- I don't see no Professor Browne.
- Neither do I, in point of fact.

464
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,600
You children look after the bed
while I make inquiries for Mr. Browne.

465
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,360
I told you this flaming bed
wouldn't work.

466
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,840
- Oh, Charlie, don't start that again.
- It didn't work proper.

467
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,200
- This bed was supposed
to take us to Professor Browne.
- Look!

468
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,920
Professor Browne.

469
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,840
Come on.

470
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,280
Oy, wait a moment.
We can't leave the bed there.

471
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,120
Push.

472
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,960
- Which way did he go?
- I don't know. Let's try this.

473
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,880
- Push!
- Hurry up!

474
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,320
Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round,
please! Ladies and gentlemen!

475
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,640
Please note the name, ladies and
gentlemen- Professor Emelius Browne.

476
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,360
I am here to divert,
to amuse and, yes, even to help you.

477
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,320
How can I enrich your lives?

478
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
My humble talents
are at your command.

479
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,880
Ah, madam,
what have we here?

480
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,120
- You said you were stony broke.
- I don't keep money in me ear.

481
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,960
- It's a trick.
- Yes, madam, a trick.

482
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,080
Or to use a kinder word,
an illusion.

483
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,240
But what isn't,
in these troubled times?

484
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,520
We live in a world
of fakery and false images.

485
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,440
There he is!

486
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,680
It is not what things are.

487
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,160
It is what they seem to be.
Is that not so, madam?

488
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,680
That ain't the kind
of professor I expected.

489
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,520
I'm not sure it's the kind of professor
Miss Price expected either.

490
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,640
You see, it really doesn't matter
what I do, what I do,

491
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,120
as long as I do it...

492
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,320
with a flair.

493
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,640
What effect
a little smoke is.

494
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,720
With a dash of hocus-pocus
and the scent of burning-

495
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,960
And the scent of burning
sulphur in the air.

496
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,960
I'm a fraud, a hoke
a charlatan, a joke

497
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,120
- But they love me everywhere
- Thank you!

498
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,160
Thank you!

499
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,760
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for my next trick,

500
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,360
may I draw your attention to this
solid piece of ordinary window glass...

501
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,400
framed in an ordinary
unprepared frame.

502
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,360
May I also draw your attention
to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.

503
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,280
Now, I shall place
the framed glass...

504
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,920
in this brown, unprepared- unprepared,
mark you, ladies and gentlemen...

505
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,320
unprepared brown paper bag.

506
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,400
I shall now attempt to drive
the steel nail through the glass...

507
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,880
without breaking the glass.

508
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,600
"Impossible,"I can hear you say.
We shall see.

509
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,320
He ain't very good,
even if he is a professor.

510
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,200
And it really doesn't matter
what I say, what I say

511
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,640
As long as I say it
with a flair

512
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,120
First I rattle off
a ready stock

513
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,080
Of gibberish
and poppycock

514
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,160
And fix you with my best
hypnotic stare

515
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,320
With my moans and groans
and soporific tones

516
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,040
They have cheered me
everyone

517
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,000
For it really doesn't matter
what I say, what I say

518
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,400
I sell it when I tell it
with a "seemus alabeem"

519
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,480
The magicians' nursery rhyme

520
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,840
Abra... cadabra!

521
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,720
You succumb- ooh- to it
every time

522
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,360
Wave a stick
And each trick

523
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,600
Will mystify and disarm

524
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,280
In fact, to coin
a fitting phrase

525
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,440
It works

526
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,080
Ooh!

527
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,000
Like a charm

528
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,400
So it really doesn't matter
what I brew, what I brew

529
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,680
As long as I brew it
with a flair

530
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,160
Though I've never
cast a magic spell

531
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,320
I make the motions
very well

532
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,080
My showmanship
is far beyond compare

533
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,640
I'm a rogue, a rake
a mountebank of fake

534
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,800
But I do
whate'er I dare

535
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,040
What a waste of fresh eggs.

536
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,080
They ain't fresh. Smell.

537
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,320
For it really
doesn't matter

538
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,120
What I do, what I do

539
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,920
You buy my charms and poxes
'cause they come in fancy boxes

540
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,960
To improve your ugly daughter
I've a vial of colored water

541
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,200
And my magic incantations
can be framed as decorations

542
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,400
Though there's really nothing to it
and, of course, you all see through it

543
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,000
You love me 'cause I do it

544
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,160
With a flair

545
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,560
Now, friends, I tell you
what I'm going to do.

546
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,120
I'm going to offer you my entire stock
of magic- No, ladies, please don't go.

547
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,600
The prices are so low,
you will never cease to marvel at them.

548
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,320
Don't leave now and regret
lost opportunities later.

549
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,240
You, young sir, would you care
to warble like the storied nightingale?

550
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,560
With this inexpensive device,

551
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,960
you can charm the very birds
down from the trees, like so-

552
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,880
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.

553
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,880
One copper coin of the realm.

554
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,480
Carrie, I'm very surprised at you
wandering off like this.

555
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,080
- We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.

556
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,560
- Don't work. I've been cheated.
- Is that Professor Browne?

557
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,440
It is, indeed, my dear.
How may I serve you?

558
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,160
Would you be interested in the mating
call of the Brazilian Matouacan bird,

559
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,440
known as the bird of love?

560
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,680
Very useful, eh?

561
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,720
You are the headmaster of
the Emelius Browne Correspondence
College of Witchcraft?

562
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,080
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.

563
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,480
Professor Browne,
I am one of your pupils.

564
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,920
My dear lady, you are, indeed,
an ornament to the college.

565
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,840
- Splendid.
- Not at all.

566
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,760
I was shocked and dismayed...

567
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,840
when you closed down the college
without that most important last lesson.

568
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,480
I'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.

569
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,880
But I must have the spell
that comes with the last lesson.

570
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,800
The matter is closed.
I bid you good day.

571
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,280
I have an appointment
at my club for squash rackets.

572
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,240
The matter is not closed.
Don't let him get away.

573
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,080
Righto!

574
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,280
- I got him!
- Leave go of me. Would you mind-

575
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,000
- Would you mind letting go of my leg.
- Flush him out!

576
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,320
Will you get this child off my leg?
Would you get this child-

577
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,880
Filigree, Apogee,
Pedigree, Perigee!

578
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,760
Cor!

579
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,520
Now I trust you'll behave
more like a gentleman.

580
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,040
Look out!

581
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,040
Well, there goes
another rabbit.

582
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,560
- What was that all about?
- I changed you into a rabbit
with one of your own spells.

583
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,640
My spell?
From my school?

584
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,480
Not one of your best spells,
in point of fact.

585
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,920
It doesn't last very long.
Some of your others are much better.

586
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,480
But I don't understand.
My spell?

587
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,000
They were just nonsense words
that I got out of an old book!

588
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,880
Well, they work
perfectly well for me.

589
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,280
They work for you?

590
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,040
Good woman, some kind of destiny
has brought us together.

591
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,360
You got the words for these spells
out of some old book, you say?

592
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,920
Well, more or less.
I changed them around a bit.

593
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,160
I gave them a bit
of my own style, as it were.

594
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,480
The old sorcerers did have
a bit of a tendency to waffle on.

595
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,360
But, dear lady, I never thought
I'd meet somebody like you.

596
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,280
What a treasure.

597
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,520
Mr. Browne, will you please
stick to the point.

598
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,160
I would like to see
this book immediately.

599
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,880
Certainly.
It's at my new townhouse.

600
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,840
Would you care to join me
for luncheon?

601
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,040
We can discuss my ideas
at the same time.

602
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,520
Thank you.
We'd be delighted.

603
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,840
We? Do these three jackals
belong to you?

604
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,520
Well, not exactly.
However, we shall all go together.

605
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,360
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul.

606
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,240
Come along.

607
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,560
You go 'round the other side.
I always travel on the left.

608
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,360
Will you give the address
to Paul, please?

609
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,720
May I ask how we are going
to get there on this bed? Fly?

610
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,200
My dear Professor Browne,
with your own traveling spell,

611
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,840
the one you gave
with the course as a bonus.

612
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,160
My traveling spell?
That works as well?

613
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,000
- Just give the address, please.
- 8 Wynchfield Road.

614
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,840
Bed, take us
to 8 Wynchfield Road.

615
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,760
Madam, is this vehicle safe?

616
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,680
Oh, perfectly safe.

617
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,320
A bit theatrical perhaps,
but then most good spells are.

618
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,360
Well, we're here.
I would never have believed it.

619
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,560
You must have given us the wrong
address. You don't live here, do you?

620
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,640
In point of fact, I do.
Temporarily, at any rate.

621
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,680
I found the front door open,
the house was deserted.

622
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,720
Everyone has left
the neighborhood.

623
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,040
Now, why should they do that?

624
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,720
This probably has
something to do with it.

625
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,240
Merciful heavens!

626
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,240
I should think you'd be terrified
at the very idea of living here.

627
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,240
You'd have thought so. I am, by nature,
well, a little bit of a coward.

628
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,160
But then I pondered,
as I often do.

629
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,920
In the perverse nature of things,
this diabolical object...

630
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,440
is probably the best friend
I've ever had.

631
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,720
It enables me, for the first time
in my life, to live like a king.

632
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,640
Shall we go in?

633
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,800
Rothchild '26-noble,
worldly-wise,

634
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,680
but with a charming touch of innocence,
wouldn't you say?

635
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,000
Mr. Browne, the book-
where is it?

636
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,920
Dear lady,
you are relentless.

637
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,760
The book is in the library,
and we shall proceed there after
finishing our cheese and wine.

638
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,080
Why do you keep
the curtains closed?

639
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,440
So that we may enjoy
the gentle glow of candlelight.

640
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,840
More likely so's a copper don't peek in
and catch you hidin' out here.

641
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,480
Now, why don't you young things
have a look around the house?

642
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,760
- I want to have a chat with Miss Price.
- May we?

643
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,560
Yes, run along, children.
But mind you don't touch anything.

644
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,120
Remember, this house
does not belong to Mr. Browne.

645
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,120
Mr. Browne, where is that book?

646
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,040
I must have that spell
on substitutiary locomotion.

647
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,960
What is it, a toy shop?

648
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,960
No, it's a nursery.
Ain't you ever seen a nursery?

649
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,360
No. And neither have you.

650
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,440
And what is
substitutiary locomotion?

651
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,120
Substitutiary locomotion
is the ancient and mystic art...

652
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,800
of causing objects to take on
a life force of their own.

653
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,320
Why are you
so interested in that?

654
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,400
Because I know that it
can only help the war effort.

655
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,640
- I must see the nature of the spell.
- Precisely, my good woman.

656
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,440
But now you must
hear my ideas.

657
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,040
What are you reading?

658
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,560
Isle of Naboombu.

659
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,320
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.

660
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,200
These pictures prove it, don't it?

661
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,480
Bit weird, though, ain't it?

662
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,160
Animals wearing hats and things.

663
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,960
Oh, I like it.

664
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,600
Uh, would you
hold this, please?

665
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,880
What do you think of that?

666
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,640
Well, I don't know
what to think.

667
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,560
Miss Price, just think
how successful I could be...

668
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,800
with an assistant
who can really do magic!

669
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,160
- Oh?
- Dear lady,

670
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,160
have you ever considered entering
what some of us call "show business"?

671
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
The what business?

672
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,320
The theater! Pantomimes!
Village fairs, the seaside.

673
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,360
Brighton, Blackpool,
Follies on the Prom!

674
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,720
Mr. Browne, I have
very important work to do.

675
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,000
Listen to me.
We could make a package.

676
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,800
Let us strike a bargain
You possess a gift

677
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,720
But I can speak the jargon that will
give your gift the needed lift

678
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,360
- Oh?
- You possess the know-how

679
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,760
And I command
the show-how

680
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,480
Oh, how successful
you could be

681
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,400
With me

682
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,280
- I'm afraid we're wasting valuable time.
- What's your name?

683
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,480
- Miss Price.
- No, no. Your first name, my dear.

684
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,520
- Eglantine.
- Eglantine?

685
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,400
Eglantine
Eglantine

686
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,480
Oh, how you'll shine

687
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,040
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine

688
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,120
Eglantine, Eglantine
Hark to the stars

689
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,400
Destiny calls us
The future is ours

690
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,240
As the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit

691
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,000
All you need to succeed
in your plan

692
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:09,400
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely

693
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,320
And I'm your man

694
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,920
For I have an acumen
that's nigh superhuman

695
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,520
I sell things
that nobody can

696
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,560
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest

697
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,440
I'm your man

698
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,720
- Eglantine, Eglantine, oh, how you'll shine
- Mr. Browne!

699
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,320
- Mr. Browne, will you please stop it?
- Your lot and my lot

700
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,520
- Have got to combine Eglantine, Eglantine
- Mr. Browne!

701
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,320
- Do you hear me?
- Hark to the stars

702
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,480
- Destiny calls us, the future is ours
- Mr. Browne, I'm warning you.

703
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,200
With my expert pantomiming

704
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,120
The proper taste
and timing

705
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,360
I'll introduce you
in the manner grand

706
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,400
I'll whet their appetite
for you

707
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,440
I'll set the scene
so right for you

708
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,440
We'll have the beggars
eating out of your hand

709
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,360
As the words
sell the tune

710
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,800
And the moonbeams
the moon

711
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,760
All you need to succeed
in your plan

712
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,040
Is a champion
reared with a flourish

713
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,120
And a flair

714
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,640
And I'm your man

715
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,360
Do stop prancing about.

716
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,520
There's serious work
to be done.

717
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,200
I have always had a bit
of a knack for witchcraft

718
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,280
Common spells and simple charms
came naturally

719
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,160
So when the war began
I conjured up a plan

720
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,280
To do my bit
in the national emergency

721
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,200
I enrolled in your
Correspondence College of Witchcraft

722
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,280
And I slaved at every lesson
as it came

723
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,240
But the spell I counted on
is the lesson that is gone

724
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,600
It's disappeared
and you're the one to blame

725
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,080
Your suggestions are rash
and your manner is brash

726
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,680
And I've no time to waste
Mr. Browne

727
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,960
If I am to proceed
it's that book that I need

728
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,440
Don't let me down

729
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,760
But if you'll see me through
I'll discuss it with you

730
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,440
Though I've no taste
for playing the clown

731
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,720
If I meet with success
then I might acquiesce

732
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,200
I won't let you down

733
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,800
Eglantine, Eglantine
Oh, how you'll shine

734
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,080
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine

735
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,880
Eglantine, Eglantine
Hark to the stars

736
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,040
Destiny calls us
The future

737
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,520
Mr. Browne, I'm warning you!

738
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,000
I warned you, Mr. Browne.

739
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,040
Now, where is the book?

740
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,960
Well, where is it?

741
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,560
At last, Mr. Browne!

742
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,360
The Spells of Astoroth.
Of course.

743
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,320
Oh, here's the traveling spell.
This is where you got it.

744
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,320
Does one's nose
have to twitch like this?

745
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,960
Oh, you're back,
Mr. Browne.

746
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,360
Miss Price, a word
about your tactics.

747
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,840
I don't mind being changed into
a hawk or a tiger or something
with a bit of dash to it,

748
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,360
but always a fluffy, white rabbit-
it's intolerable!

749
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,680
Ah, here we are.
Substitutiary locomotion.

750
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,440
"The ancient art of..."
etcetera.

751
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,720
"The spell which creates
this force...

752
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,080
is five mystic words.

753
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,720
These words are..."

754
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,080
But the rest of the book
is missing!

755
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,000
Now you see why
I closed down the college.

756
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,280
- But where are the other pages?
- I haven't the foggiest.

757
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,800
- Listen to me, Mr. Browne!
- I'm all ears.

758
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,080
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book?

759
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,000
Oh, I bought it from a chap
in the street market.

760
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,400
There was a bit of unpleasantness,
as a matter of fact.

761
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,040
He claimed that I'd given him
a dud coin, I ask you.

762
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,960
There was a sort of scuffle.

763
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,800
The book tore.
He got one half and I got the other.

764
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,800
- Where's the other half now?
- Oh, it's probably been thrown away.

765
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,480
- But if it still exists, there's
only one place to find it.
- Where is that?

766
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,920
Portobello Road

767
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,400

in the Portobello Road

777
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,680
- Waterford crystal
- Napoleon's pistols

778
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,200

Painted last week
on the banks of the Thames

781
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,080
Very interesting.
But where do they sell books?

782
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,120
There's a little place
around the corner.

783
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,120
Portobello Road, Portobello Road

784
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,800
Street where the riches
of ages are stowed

785
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,040
Anything and everything
a chap can unload

786
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,920
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road

787
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,560
You'll meet all your chums
in the Portobello Road

788
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,680
Lovely to see you.
Good-bye.

789
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,600
What I want is the other
half of this book.

790
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,080
All in good time,
my dear.

791
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,600
There's pure inspiration
in every creation

792

Not here in me store

With garments as such
as was worn by a duchess

794
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,160
Just once at some
royal occasion of yore

795
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,200
You look charming, my dear.

796
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,760
In Portobello Road
Portobello Road

797
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,960
The fancies and fineries
of ages are showed

798
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,240
A lady will always
feel dressed a la mode

799
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,160
In frillies she finds

800
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,400

the other part of this, thank you.

The Unwanted Son

Artifacts to glorify
a regal abode

810

in Portobello Road
- Here!

They're bought and they're sold

816
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,920
Tokens and treasures
Yesterday's pleasures

817
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,680
Cheap imitations
of heirlooms of old

818
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,400
Dented and tarnished
Scarred and unvarnished

819
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,400
- In old Portobello, they're
bought and they're sold
- This good lady is looking...

820
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,520
- for the other half of this book.
- It's called The Spells of Astoroth.

821
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,200
I don't keep no torn
or damaged books here.

822
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,840
What do you think I am,
a ruddy waste paper merchant?

823
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,000
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road

824
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,440
I think, if I'm right, there's
another bookstore along here somewhere.

825
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,960
Grandpa, you don't expect
to sell a piano like that, do you?

826
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,440
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.

827
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:13,240
- Oh!
- Portobello Road, Portobello Road

828
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:17,040
- Yeah! Go on!
- All kinds of things are happening
in Portobello Road

829
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,120
You feel like a ballerina
when you're hopping like a toad

830
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,600
When you kick your heels up
down in Portobello Road

831
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,560
- Come on!
- Oh, yeah!

832
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,040
Go around the drum now. Yeah.

833
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,640
Yes, play the drums.

834
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,720
Come on!

835
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,760
Oh!

836
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,680
You missed me.

837
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,600
Come on, dance.

838
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,000
Come on, girls.

839
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,880
Lovely.

840
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,260
Closing time!

841
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,480
Closing time!

842
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,960
Closing time. Closing time.

843
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,520
Closing time.
Closing time.

844
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,000
Bye.

845
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

846
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,680
Portobello Road

847
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:51,080
Portobello Road

848
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:57,360
Street where the riches
of ages are stowed

849
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:02,520
Anything and everything
a chap can unload

850
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,040
Hey, governor. Oy, tosh. Somethin'
for the lady friend? Nylons?

851
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,960
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?

852
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,200
- Chocs for the little ones?
- No.

853
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,920
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.

854
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,160
- Do be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?

855
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:21,400
Ah. Now you have my undivided attention.
What can I do for you?

856
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,560
You are to get over to the Bookman
straightaway. He wants to see you.

857
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,080
- You too.
- Who is the Bookman...

858
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,480
and what right has he got
to order me about?

859
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,720
Under the circumstances, we better
ask questions later. Excuse me.

860
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,480
Half a mo- Why am I pushing
this here flaming bed?

861
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,320
Because, my friend, this magnificent bed
once belonged to the Duke of Wellington.

862
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,080
- You see?
- I ain't sure I do.

863
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,160
It is extremely valuable, and I wish
to give it to the Bookman as a present.

864
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,200
- All right, all right.
I'll push the blasted thing.
- I thought you would.

865
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,960
- Who is it?
- I brought the woman.

866
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,280
- And him as well.
- Well, send 'em in!

867
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,800
- In you come.
- Right. In we come!

868
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,800
Sorry, gov.
No one told me about the stairs.

869
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,480
Why didn't you just
bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne,

870
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,120
and half the household
cavalry as well?

871
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:39,160
- What's the bed for?
- It's a present for you. That's what he said.

872
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,560
Nothing of the sort!
The bed belongs to me.

873
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,680
Except for this knob,
which is mine.

874
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,760
Be that as it may, Bookman, there's
been bad blood between us long enough.

875
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,000
Let this glittering gift
begin friendship anew.

876
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,720
- Draw the curtains and lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug.

877
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,360
Mr. Browne, isn't that
the section of the manuscript
that we've been looking for?

878
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,840
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price,

879
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,280
a charming young woman
of my acquaintance.

880
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,320
Miss Price, I've been looking
for this other bit a long time.

881
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,840
Mr. Swinburne told me you were
in the market making inquiries.
And here we are.

882
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:16,160
I don't mind saying,
to see it all together at last,
there isn't much I wouldn't do.

883
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,280
Or haven't done, for that matter.
Right, gov?

884
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,120
You'll close your mouth,
Swinburne! Is that clear?

885
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,400
It's all rather like a jolly
detective story or jigsaw puzzle,

886
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,320
isn't it?

887
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,560
We're both after
the same spell.

888
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,480
You have one clue,
I have the other.

889
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,720
Yes. In that case,
the sensible thing seems to be...

890
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,000
for us to cooperate.

891
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,800
Yes. I'd rather cooperate
with a cobra.

892
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,200
Would you prefer
that I ask Swinburne...

893
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,960
to take the book from her?

894
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,560
Here, you.
None of that.

895
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,240
- Bookman.
- Yes.

896
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,520
I assume you're looking
for the same thing I am.

897
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,440
May I?

898
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,080
This is quite a moment
for both of us.

899
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,040
"Substitutiary locomotion,

900
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,840
the lost miracle of the ancients".

901
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,840
And so on and so forth.
Ah! Here we are!

902
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:22,000
"The spell which creates
this force is five mystic words.

903
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,960
These words are-"

904
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,320
"Engraved on the star
that was always worn...

905
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,240
by the sorcerer Astoroth".

906
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,640
But where are the words of the spell?

907
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,640
I assumed they'd be in
your half of the manuscript.

908
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,400
But I thought they'd be in yours!

909
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,880
Once again, a dead end.

910
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,440
I shall never know
the secret.

911
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,560
Isn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.

912
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,960
It's a pity it's so small
you can't read the writing.

913
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,400
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,

914
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,680
Astoroth kept animals in cages
and searched for the spells...

915
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,760
that would make them
more like humans.

916
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,120
The legend is that finally
the animals rebelled at the experiment,

917
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,160
killed Astoroth and stole
many of his powers.

918
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,120
- Including the star with the spell on it.
- Possibly.

919
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:17,320
They found a ship, sailed away
and were never heard of again.

920
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,080
However, there's a final notation
in my half of the book...

921
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,600
saying that
in the 17 th century...

922
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,560
a shipwrecked lascar
was taken from the sea,

923
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,400
half mad with thirst
and exposure to the sun.

924
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:35,160
Before he died, he swore he had seen
an island ruled by animals.

925
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,440
- Where?
- There is, I regret to say,

926
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,360
no such island.

927
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,440
I looked for it
in every chart.

928
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,920
The Isle of Naboombu
does not exist.

929
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,720
Oh, it does too!
Got me own...

930
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,880
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing.

931
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,880
When he don't say nothing,
he mumbles.

932
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,480
I wish the child to speak!

933
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,160
Now you've done it.

934
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,280
There is too such a place.

935
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,160
Got me own book. There.

936
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,360
Real pretty letters, ain't it?

937
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,040
Let me see it.

938
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,120
You're not interested, Bookman.
It's just a simple children's book.

939
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,240
- I'll be the judge of that. Give it to me.
- No.

940
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,200
Please don't annoy me.

941
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,680
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.

942
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,120
Bit of a stalemate,
isn't it?

943
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,880
If it's all the same to you,
I'd rather use me own.

944
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,800
Sentiment, you know.

945
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,760
Come along, Paul.
I believe it's time to go.

946
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,720
Go? How, my dear?
The door is locked.

947
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,000
Observe the fundamental weakness
of the criminal mind.

948
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,080
- You will believe in no one or anything.
- I understand. The knob, Paul.

949
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,880
- Right.
Of course you do, my dear.

950
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:56,280
Do you realize we can
tell them the complete truth?
They will believe nothing!

951
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,160
- He's up to something, you know.
- Bookman!

952
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:04,440
Before your very eyes,
I shall cause this bed and all
the occupants upon it to disappear.

953
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:09,160
Disappear? I should like to see
a cheapjack tenth-rate entertainer...

954
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,360
do a trick like that.

955
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,080
Cheapjack entertainer?
Now, that was naughty.

956
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,080
- All right, Paul.
- Where to?

957
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,200
To the Island of Naboombu.
I'm very curious about that place.

958
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:24,120
Good. Bed, take us
to the Island of Naboombu.

959
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,880
Enough of this nonsense.
Get the book.

960
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,920
Beastly climate.
I never did fancy the sea.

961
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,360
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course.

962
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,240
I ain't never seen no island
like this before.

963
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,400
I'm afraid we may have
fallen into the lagoon.

964
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,840
That's right.
Here we are, on page three.

965
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,960
Hi, Mr. Codfish!

966
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,200
Hello, young fellow.

967
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,440
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.

968
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,360
Now I'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.

969
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,240
Not too bright, is he?

970
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,600
- He's me brother.
- Oh? Sorry.

971
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,800
Mr. Codfish, where is
the Island of Naboombu?

972
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,000
You mean the land part?
Oh, that.

973
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,440
Straight up.
You can't miss it.

974
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:01,760
None of my business, of course,
but I shouldn't go there if I were you.

975
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,400
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?

976
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,520
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.

977
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,080
Well, trouble or not,
we should be getting along.

978
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,880
- I wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush?

979
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,000
It's really rather splendid down here.
For you, my dear.

980
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,920
Oh, thank you.

981
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:30,520
How pleasant-
Bobbing along, bobbing along

982
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:35,680
On the bottom of
the beautiful briny sea

983
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,320
What a chance to get
a better peep

984
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,000
At the plants and
creatures of the deep

985
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,200
We glide

986
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:51,400
Far below the rolling tide

987
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,360
Serene

988
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,680
Through the bubbly
blue and green

989
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:03,840
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along

990
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:09,600
On the bottom of
the beautiful briny sea

991
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,440
What if the octopus,
the flounder and the cod...

992
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,320
think we're rather odd?

993
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,840
It's fun to promenade

994
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,440
Bobbing along
Singing a song

995
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,600
On the bottom of
the beautiful briny sea

996
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,360
Look!

997
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,080
It's lovely
bobbing along

998
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:06,400
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

999
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,280
What a chance
to get a better peep

1000
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,880
At the plants and creatures
of the deep

1001
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,880
It's grand

1002
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,800
When you're dancing
on the sand

1003
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,240
Each glance

1004
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,440
Bubbles over with romance

1005
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,640
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along

1006
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:40,440
Through the water
where we get along swimmingly

1007
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:45,000
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above

1008
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,560
- Two beneath the blue
- Could even fall in love

1009
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,920
Bobbing along
Singing a song

1010
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:58,000
On the bottom of
the beautiful briny sea

1011
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,560
Bobbing along
Singing a song

1012
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,280
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny

1013
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,440
Shimmery, shiny

1014
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,880
Beautiful briny sea

1015
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,600
Bravo! Bravo!

1016
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,560
Most exciting!
Most exciting!

1017
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,320
You've won the Ruddy Cup.

1018
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,320
Help! Help!

1019
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,200
Uh-oh. Oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1020
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,520
This time I really
got a whopper!

1021
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,200
Whew!

1022
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,240
People? People?

1023
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,760
Oh, no!
What scurvy luck!

1024
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,520
- My goodness!
- I'll deal with this, my dear.

1025
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,520
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, Captain.

1026
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,200
I used to be a bit of
a seafaring man myself.

1027
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,600
Many's the time
I've shipped out of Portsmouth.

1028
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,800
Delighted to meet
a fellow mariner.

1029
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:31,200
Oh? Now, stow it, mate!

1030
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:35,080
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read readin'? Huh?

1031
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,760
Uh, it says, um,

1032
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,000
"No peopling allowed".

1033
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,640
No peopling allowed?
Ridiculous.

1034
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,720
Don't antagonize him,
Mr. Browne.

1035
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,160
That means I got to ta- ta- ta-

1036
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:50,680
throw you all back,
that's what it do!

1037
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:54,560
Wait a minute! It says here
that anybody can see the king.

1038
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,440
And that's the law.

1039
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,440
Where do it say that?

1040
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,440
Here, in me book.

1041
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,280
So it do.
What?

1042
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,120
Da- Da- Da- But if you people
know what was good for ya,

1043
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,680
- you'd get yourselves all-
ta- ta- ta-

1044
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,640
throwed back!

1045
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,560
The king don't like people!

1046
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,960
Nonetheless, we must see the king
on an urgent personal matter.

1047
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,880
Please lead the way.

1048
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,880
But just don't say
I didn't warn ya, see?

1049
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,680
Uh, follow me.

1050
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,640
You're all from some clipper
that flies the black ball

1051
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,800
To me, aye-yaye
Blow the man down

1052
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,880
I'm a peace-lovin' sailor
and that sure ain't all

1053
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:42,120
Blow, blow, blow the man down

1054
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,400
Get out of here!

1055
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:05,040
Yes. Yes.
What can I do for you?

1056
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:09,480
I, uh, caught some people
down at the Sea Lagoon.

1057
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,640
They want to see the king!

1058
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:17,080
Really? Well, we can't be bothered
with that sort of thing now, can we?

1059
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,280
I don't know that I fancy this.

1060
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:25,080
His Majesty
is in a frightful rage.

1061
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,000
Excuse me, sir.

1062
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,200
As an all-around entertainer of sorts,
I am considered not without talent.

1063
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,120
Perhaps I can cheer him up.

1064
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:36,480
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

1065
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,240
As everyone knows,

1066
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,680
His Majesty is the world's
greatest soccer player.

1067
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:50,360
But due to a technical problem,

1068
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,560
the Royal Cup match
cannot take place today.

1069
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,120
And His Majesty had so
set his heart on it.

1070
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,000
Throw these...

1071
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,640
oh, creatures
back into the sea.

1072
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,200
Aye, aye, sir.

1073
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,640
Just a moment.
I can help.

1074
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:11,560
Do you really think so?
I'd be most grateful.

1075
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,200
Do you know soccer?

1076
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,640
Do I know anything
about soccer?

1077
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,040
Why, I was captain
of the Totnum Hotspurs for two years,

1078
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,960
three seasons
with Manchester United.

1079
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,280
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You'll do.
- Before that, I...

1080
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,840
Come this way, please.

1081
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,520
Mr. Browne, are you certain
you'll be all right?

1082
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,480
Now what?

1083
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,840
Not an ideal person
in many respects,

1084
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,760
but Mr. Browne
is a very brave man.

1085
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,920
Do you think he's done for?

1086
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:55,840
Do ya think so?

1087
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,160
Ar, can't tell you
how I appreciate this.

1088
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,800
For some reason,
we have great difficulty...

1089
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:11,920
finding referees 'round here.

1090
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,200
If there be one thing we like,

1091
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,640
it's volunteers.

1092
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,560
Eh, birdy?

1093
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,480
Har! Har! Har!

1094
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,760
He's a proper king.
Look at his crown.

1095
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,480
What's he got 'round his neck?

1096
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,760
What a magnificent...
ornament, Sire.

1097
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,720
Ar, yes. Well.

1098
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,600
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.

1099
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,920
The Star of Astoroth.

1100
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,960
You're to sit
in His Majesty's royal box.

1101
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,680
No littering, no chewing, no fruit
or wrappers from boiled sweets, please.

1102
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,840
Rise, please.

1103
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,160
Loyal fans,

1104
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:10,440
this is official!

1105
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:14,560
We have a volunteer referee!

1106
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,880
Let the match begin!

1107
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,960
He's still wearing it.

1108
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,520
Right. Dirty Yellows,
let's have a nice, clean game.

1109
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,800
Right. True Blues,
best foot forward.

1110
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,280
Weird sort of game they play here.

1111
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,520
Hurry up!
Get rid of it!

1112
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,120
Gracious!

1113
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,720
You're doin' fine, matey.

1114
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:37,160
Move it around. Move it around.

1115
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,640
Get on with the match!

1116
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,560
Ya-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1117
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,240
- Foul! Foul!
- They're only animals.

1118
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,640
That's no excuse
for dirty football.

1119
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,760
Ohh!

1120
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,280
Ref, are you blind?

1121
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:34,640
Be quiet, Charles.
Don't forget who the referee is.

1122
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,080
Ooh!

1123
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,160
Don't they have no rules?

1124
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,000
'Course they do. The king
makes them up as he goes along.

1125
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,280
Poor Mr. Browne.
Do you think he's all right?

1126
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,320
Well, he's moving.

1127
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,800
Steady, matey.
Move it around.

1128
01:28:57,160 --> 01:29:00,480
Tsk! Oh, he almost
had it then.

1129
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,960
Looks like he's done for this time.

1130
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:43,160
Don't just stand there!
Hit it in!

1131
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:23,320
Stop... that... ball!

1132
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,840
Goal!

1133
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,680
Ha-ha!
Game's over.

1134
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:06,400
I win!

1135
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,600
Ah, let me give you
a hand, matey.

1136
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:15,480
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.

1137
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,360
Oh, please, let me help you on
with your robe.

1138
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,960
Why, yes. Thank you.
Thank you. Yes.

1139
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,520
Can't have you catching cold,
Sire, can we?

1140
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,440
Why, no, no.

1141
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,920
Have you ever heard of something
called the "gypsy switch"?

1142
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,360
No. Can't say that I have.

1143
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,440
Remind me to tell you
about it sometime.

1144
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,840
I can't tell you
when we've had such a good time.

1145
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,480
We'll carry the memory of Your Majesty
in our hearts for a long while.

1146
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,760
I think it's time to leave.

1147
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,640
Aye. Must you go?

1148
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:47,480
We must be dashing. Marvelous game.
Lovely to see you. Good-bye.

1149
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,440
- Good-bye. Come along, children.
- Good-bye.

1150
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,360
Good-bye.

1151
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,520
Friendly lot.
Hee-hee-hee.

1152
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,920
Don't mind them visitin'.

1153
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,160
Wouldn't want 'em livin' here.

1154
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,600
- Come along, children.
- Come on, children. Hurry up.

1155
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,360
Oh!

1156
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,920
Stop gibberin'!
What's the matter with you?

1157
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,760
Your royal star!

1158
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,640
They've stolen
your royal star!

1159
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:23,920
Har, har, har, har!
Don't be ridiculous.

1160
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,200
What do you think this is?

1161
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,320
Why... didn't you...

1162
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,560
say... so?

1163
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,480
All right, Paul,
put the knob on the bed.

1164
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:47,000
At last, the magic words:

1165
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,680
"Treguna, Mekoides,
Trecorum Satis Dee".

1166
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,400
I'll keep it.
Women always lose things.

1167
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,240
- Hurry, Paul. The knob.
- It's stuck.

1168
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,880
- I suppose I better do something.
- Please, do. Quick.

1169
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,720
Got it.

1170
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,400
Filigree, Apogee, Pedigree-

1171
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:21,840
Oh, bother!
I do hate shoddy work.

1172
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:49,560
I don't suppose I shall ever
get used to this thing.

1173
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,440
Children, will you push
the bed back into place, please?

1174
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,960
I think we could all do
with a nice cup of tea.

1175
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,960
Oh, no time for that. I've gone to
a lot of trouble to find this spell.

1176
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:00,840
I'm going to try it immediately.

1177
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,880
Mr. Browne, kindly let me
have your shoes, please.

1178
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,160
My shoes?
Oh, fine.

1179
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,920
- What's the shoes for?
- Really, Charles,

1180
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:13,240
if you'd been paying attention,
I should think you'd be aware
that substitutiary locomotion...

1181
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:17,640
is the art of causing inanimate objects
to take on a life force of their own.

1182
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:21,520
Obviously, I must have
inanimate objects to experiment with.

1183
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,320
Makes sense, don't it?

1184
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,680
Stand back, everyone.
I need plenty of room.

1185
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,520
I want you all to be
absolutely quiet.

1186
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:39,040
- Mr. Browne, you have
the Star of Astoroth, I believe.
- Oh, yes.

1187
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,440
It's in my nice, clean hanky.

1188
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,760
It's all right, Mr. Browne.

1189
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,280
I should have realized
that it would be quite impossible...

1190
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:55,160
to take an object
from one world into another.

1191
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:02,880
If only I would've had the sense
to remember the words on that star.

1192
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:06,200
- I know the words, Miss Price.
- Don't bother Miss Price. She's thinking.

1193
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:10,040
Charlie, why don't you and I nip down
to the village and get something for supper?

1194
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,480
And I might conceivably
call into the pub for a pint...

1195
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,400
to steady my nerves.

1196
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,320
- Trebonna-
- I do know the words, Miss Price.

1197
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,200
Come along. How can you know
the words when Miss Price doesn't?

1198
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,120
Fre- Frebunna.

1199
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,720
- You wish to put this
on Miss Price's bill?
- That is correct.

1200
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,640
I don't believe we've met.

1201
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:32,080
Oh, allow me
to introduce myself.

1202
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:36,000
I am Miss Price's teacher,
Emelius Browne, from London.

1203
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,720
Professor Browne.
Of course!

1204
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,920
Oh, how many times I've seen your name
on your packages to Miss Price.

1205
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,880
Oh, extremely masculine
handwriting.

1206
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,840
I should have known.
Professor Emelius Browne.

1207
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,800
- The very same.
- I'll confess somethin'.

1208
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,240
Such was the nature and frequency
of your correspondence with Miss Price,

1209
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:59,000
I ventured the hope there was somethin'
of a personal interest between you.

1210
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:02,080
If there only were.

1211
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,320
Miss Price is a fine woman.

1212
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,520
I most heartily agree.
We're very fond of her here.

1213
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,240
- I'm sure.
- In point of fact,

1214
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,640
how many times
I've said to myself,

1215
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,720
"Oh, fortunate is the man
who can secure Miss Price for a wife".

1216
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,840
Well, one could
say that, yes.

1217
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,920
You yourself
are not married?

1218
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,760
Alas, no.

1219
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,200
These are strange and fearful times
in which we live, my good woman.

1220
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,560
Who could ask someone
you cherish...

1221
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:35,400
to share such
an uncertain future?

1222
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:41,080
Very well. Don't say I didn't
warn you, Professor Browne.

1223
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,480
One of these days-you mark my words-

1224
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,160
someone will come riding out of nowhere
to seize and carry off Miss Price...

1225
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:50,960
- before your very eyes.
- I shouldn't be surprised. Charles.

1226
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,400
Good morning.

1227
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,720
And who was that,
may I ask?

1228
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,360
Professor Emelius Browne
from London.

1229
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:10,560
He's come to see Miss Price.
A very good friend, I understand.

1230
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,840
Oh. Indeed.

1231
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:25,160
- That Mrs. Hobday seemed to fancy you.
- Shh, shh, shh!

1232
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:29,000
- I consider her a very dangerous person.
- What, her?

1233
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:32,520
Mrs. Hobday is that most dangerous
of species: a matchmaker.

1234
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:47,120
Troop movements and massing of barges
in French and Dutch channel ports.

1235
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,960
The prime minister has told the nation
to be on the alert...

1236
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:54,040
for signs of a possible invasion.
That was the news-

1237
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:56,760
To think I might have been able
to do something about all this.

1238
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,000
It's out of your hands now, my dear.

1239
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:01,680
If only I could've remembered
those words. It's maddening.

1240
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,960
Why don't someone ask me?

1241
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:08,000
Come off it, Paul.
You can't remember those kind of words.

1242
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:11,280
You mean like
Treguna, Mekoides,

1243
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,120
Trecorum Satis Dee?

1244
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:18,920
Treguna, Mekoides, Trecorum Satis Dee?
How do you know that?

1245
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,840
Easy. Says so
right here in me book.

1246
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:29,560
You mean it was there
in your book all the time?

1247
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:33,160
Yeah. But nobody
ever listens to me.

1248
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:36,240
Treguna, Mekoides,

1249
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,640
Trecorum Satis Dee.

1250
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:44,120
Nothing happened!

1251
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,080
Am I doing something wrong?

1252
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:49,480
Well, to tell you the truth,
it does seem a bit old-fashioned.

1253
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,920
- After all, we are in the 20th century.
- What do you suggest?

1254
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:56,160
Well, it needs rhythm,
tempo, music.

1255
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,600
As I always say,
"Do it with a flair".

1256
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,000
- Do you mind if I have a go?
- Oh, of course not.

1257
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:04,800
Now, come along, you lot.
We need all the help we can get!

1258
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:08,260
Treguna, Mekoides
Trecorum Satis Dee

1259
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:13,080
Treguna, Mekoides
Trecorum Satis Dee

1260
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:16,840
- Treguna, Mekoides and Trecorum Satis Dee
- Substitutiary locomotion

1261
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,280
- Mystic power that's far
- Treguna, Mekoides

1262
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,240
- Beyond the wildest notion
- And Trecorum Satis Dee

1263
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,520
- It's so weird, so feared
- Treguna, Mekoides

1264
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,800
- And yet wonderful to see
- And Trecorum Satis Dee

1265
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,240
- Treguna, Mekoides
- Substitutiary locomotion

1266
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,160
- And Trecorum Satis Dee
- Come to me

1267
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,720
Shh! Now.

1268
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:39,320
Treguna... Mekoides...

1269
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:42,480
Trecorum Satis Dee.

1270
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:48,480
Cor!

1271
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,120
Treguna, Mekoides
and Trecorum Satis Dee

1272
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,640
- I don't want locomotiary
- Treguna, Mekoides

1273
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,800
- Substitution
- And Trecorum Satis Dee

1274
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,000
- Or remote
- Treguna, Mekoides

1275
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:00,920
- Intransitory convolution
- And Trecorum Satis Dee

1276
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,680
- Only one precise
- Treguna, Mekoides

1277
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,000
- Solution is the key
- And Trecorum Satis Dee

1278
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:07,000
- Substitutiary locomotion
- Treguna, Mekoides

1279
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,920
- They must be
- And Trecorum Satis Dee

1280
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Treguna, Mekoides
and Trecorum Satis Dee

1281
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,760
Substitutiary locomotion

1282
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,800
Lovely substitutiary locomotion

1283
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:46,680
You've made
substitutiary history

1284
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:50,340
With Treguna, Mekoides
and a little help from me

1285
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,680
With Treguna, Mekoides

1286
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,520
And Trecorum Satis Dee

1287
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,720
Lumme!

1288
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:12,080
Mr. Browne,
what is going on here?

1289
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,360
I haven't the foggiest.

1290
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:17,680
How do you do?
Oh, shall we?

1291
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:20,760
- That's my nightgown!
- Is it really, my dear?

1292
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:23,000
Yes, and I'm not responsible
for its behavior.

1293
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:26,640
Obviously not, my dear.

1294
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,080
Paul, what on earth
are you doing?

1295
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:32,080
Havin' a jolly good time,
that's what.

1296
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:35,520
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? It's really most agreeable.

1297
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,440
Yes, but we must do something.

1298
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,320
Didn't I give you my all-purpose
cut-off spell? Lesson number eight.

1299
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,320
- Number eight!
- Yes, number eight, I think it was.

1300
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,920
Oy, me Sunday trousers!

1301
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,920
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.

1302
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:07,920
Be careful, Carrie.
Slow down!

1303
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,360
Charles!

1304
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:15,680
Mr. Browne,
will you please control your shoes!

1305
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:20,000
Dear lady, I very much fear
that we have nothing under control.

1306
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:41,560
Do you mind?

1307
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:01,440
Now, who would like some more
of my lovely Sausages and Mash?

1308
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,080
- Oh, no more for me, thank you.
- Oh. Carrie?

1309
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,080
It was very good,
but I've already had two helpings.

1310
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:10,200
- I'm full.
- Me too.

1311
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,600
Well, at least
somebody wants some.

1312
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,440
Cheer up, my dear. This should be
something of a celebration.

1313
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:24,640
I'm sorry. There doesn't seem
to be much to celebrate.

1314
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:27,800
I still haven't mastered
that spell.

1315
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:31,480
Of course you have. You just need
a little more practice, that's all.

1316
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,080
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1317
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:37,560
Meantime, there's nothing to liven the
spirits like a little masterjuggling.

1318
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,720
- Right, Charlie?
- Go on then, gov! Give us some juggling!

1319
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:50,080
Very few better than me at this.

1320
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,600
All you need is 20 years practice
and a touch of genius.

1321
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,040
It's never happened
to me before.

1322
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:10,480
I don't usually juggle
with cats under my feet.

1323
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,680
Look, she's laughing.

1324
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,720
Oh.

1325
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,920
Oh, Mrs. Hobday, do come in.

1326
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,640
I can't stop, my dear. I've just
come by to bring you the good news.

1327
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:40,800
- Good news?
- Yes, yes. Mr. Bissethwaite
who brings the milk, you know?

1328
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,200
Well, he's promised
to take the children in.

1329
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:46,240
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.

1330
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,760
Put a bit of color
back in their cheeks.

1331
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,680
Why, what's the matter?

1332
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:52,600
I thought you'd be pleased.

1333
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,560
You told me yourself that you
were much too busy, you had
no time to take care of children.

1334
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,320
Well, circumstances
have changed somewhat.

1335
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,120
That's right.
We got a dad now.

1336
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:05,280
- Mr. Browne.
- Paul.

1337
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,840
Miss Price, is this true?

1338
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,800
Of course. You do want him to stay
with us, don't you, Miss Price?

1339
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:17,400
I suppose I hadn't
really thought about it.

1340
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:19,920
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr. Browne?

1341
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:23,640
Well, it's all rather sudden.

1342
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:25,760
I don't quite know what to say.

1343
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,480
Oh, then I'll leave
you two to talk it over.

1344
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:32,720
Oh, I'll come back in the mornin'.
Yes, good night.

1345
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:34,800
- Good night.
- Good night.

1346
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:42,640
It is true, Mr. Browne. You are going
to be our father now, aren't you?

1347
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:46,240
Well, uh, we...

1348
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,920
We are rather rushing things,
aren't we?

1349
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:55,080
Perhaps Mr. Browne has other things
besides you children to think about.

1350
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:01,120
Yes, well-well, as a matter of fact,
I should've left ages ago.

1351
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:03,800
I must get a train
back to London tonight.

1352
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,680
It's, uh- it's rather an
important matter, as a matter of fact.

1353
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,560
I'd like to tell you about it,
but it's, uh, a little bit hush-hush.

1354
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,040
You know, sort of a secret.

1355
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,080
Well, uh, if, uh...

1356
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:21,640
If I've been any sort of help
to you, I'm pleased.

1357
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:24,480
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you.

1358
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,560
And I've enjoyed
being with you.

1359
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:30,880
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.
Will you be coming back?

1360
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,040
Someday, my dear.

1361
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:36,920
I, uh, certainly hope that
we shall meet again someday...

1362
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
when all this war business
is over.

1363
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,760
I see.

1364
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,680
And then, perhaps, I shall
realize my fondest dream-

1365
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,280
Eglantine and Emelius,
illusionists extraordinary.

1366
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:50,040
Just think how that'll
look on the poster, huh?

1367
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:52,040
Uh, the children
are going to miss you.

1368
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:57,520
- You really think they will?
- Yes.

1369
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:01,240
Well, I shall miss you-
all of you.

1370
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,240
If I don't go now,
you might never get rid of me.

1371
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,840
Good-bye, Carrie.

1372
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,480
Must you really go?

1373
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,880
Yes, I- I think it's best
for everybody. Good-bye, Paul.

1374
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:19,760
I still think you
should be our father.

1375
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:22,240
Good-bye, Charlie.

1376
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:25,080
- Do you want me to come down
to the station with you?
- No.

1377
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:29,360
No, you stay here
and look after everybody.

1378
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:35,640
- Good-bye, Miss Price.
- Good-bye, Mr. Browne.

1379
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,960
No one to miss
if he's gone too long

1380
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:19,640
No one to comfort
if things go wrong

1381
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:24,440
That's how
I want it to be

1382
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:28,760
Nobody's problems for me

1383
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:33,960
No one who needs me
to ease his pain

1384
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:39,240
No one to call me
his ball and chain

1385
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:45,240
Nobody's problems for me

1386
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:49,680
And that's how
I choose it to be

1387
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:55,960
No troubles and strife
in this life that I lead

1388
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:59,280
No tempers to humor

1389
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:03,160
No hungers to feed

1390
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:08,040
No one to warm
when the winter's cold

1391
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:11,040
No one to pamper

1392
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:14,120
No hand to hold

1393
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:18,480
And that's how
it always will be

1394
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:20,440
No

1395
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:23,720
Nobody's problems

1396
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:27,120
For me

1397
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,600
When is the next train
to London, please?

1398
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:58,000
Lord bless you, sir.
There ain't no train.

1399
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:00,400
Nothin' 'til milk job,
4:00 a. m. tomorrow morning.

1400
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:03,640
- Mind if I waited here?
- You suit yourself. Good night, sir.

1401
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,560
Good night.

1402
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,000
Out you go, Cosmic.

1403
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,880
Hello? Hello!

1404
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,760
Hello!

1405
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,280
Hello?

1406
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:55,360
Emelius Browne, do you know
you could be warm and cozy...

1407
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,920
in that house
at this very moment?

1408
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,080
For once in your useless life,
you really seem to have been needed.

1409
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:05,040
You're a failure, Emelius Browne,

1410
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:08,120
and a coward.

1411
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:12,040
No, fraulein, this is not the invasion.
Just a little exercise.

1412
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:16,040
A minor raid to induce panic
and to spread a little mischief.

1413
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,400
When you English
get it through your head...

1414
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,600
that the German forces can land at will
whenever and wherever we please,

1415
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,880
perhaps you will consider
a reasonable peace.

1416
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:26,760
Not bloody likely!

1417
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:29,480
Go on, Miss Price.
Do it to him.

1418
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:32,200
I must say,
it's very tempting.

1419
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:36,440
Colonel, how would you feel about
being turned into a nice, white rabbit?

1420
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:42,280
I said, how would you feel about being
turned into a nice, white rabbit?

1421
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,360
Be quiet, please!

1422
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:51,280
Filigree, Apogee, Epigee-

1423
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,560
Not again!

1424
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,800
Your memory, Miss Price.

1425
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,400
Charles, would you kindly fetch
my notebook from the workroom, please?

1426
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:03,720
Righto.

1427
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:06,440
Let go of that child this instant!

1428
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,880
Silence!

1429
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,440
Fraulein, we have work to do.

1430
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,080
I am sorry, but I must send
all of you someplace...

1431
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:16,160
where you will no longer
be a nuisance.

1432
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:30,000
As the words sell the tune

1433
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:32,280
And the moonbeams the moon

1434
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:36,760
All I need to succeed
in my plan

1435
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:40,320
Is a champion rare

1436
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:43,360
With a flourish
and a flair

1437
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,880
Oh.

1438
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:19,840
Eglantine.

1439
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:48,880
Where's the spell for rabbits?
Easiest of all, she says.

1440
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,680
Confound it. Can't women ever learn
to file things properly?

1441
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,160
Ah, here it is.

1442
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:04,880
"Filigree, Apogee, Pedigree, Perigee".
That's it.

1443
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:12,080
Filigree...

1444
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:16,120
Apogee, Pedigree, Perigee.

1445
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:23,800
Now, come along, my boy.

1446
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,680
Just for once in your life,
you've got to believe in something.

1447
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,600
That's it.
Good lad.

1448
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:31,920
Filigree, Apogee,

1449
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,200
Pedigree, Perigee.

1450
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:06,360
Now, what's the use of putting the children
and me in that drafty castle?

1451
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,280
It's quite chilly, you know.

1452
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:12,240
Because, fraulein, the colonel believes when
the British female decides to become a nuisance,

1453
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:14,800
she can become
the greatest nuisance in the world.

1454
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,360
And I'm inclined
to agree with him.

1455
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:19,760
You need a lesson in manners, Sergeant.

1456
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,360
If I only had my notebook,
I'd make certain you'd learn a few.

1457
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:39,080
Jumpin'Jehoshaphat! MoreJerries.

1458
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:53,680
- Take it easy, can't you?
- Try holding your breath.

1459
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:55,600
I am holding it.

1460
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:58,840
We could strip him down
and grease him with soap.

1461
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:01,040
No, it's no good.

1462
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,400
He can't do it.

1463
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:06,400
I could've told you that
in the first place.

1464
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:12,720
If we can't get Paul out to give the alarm,
we'll just have to think of something else.

1465
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:16,400
- What about that spell that
makes things move about?
- Oh, but I need weapons.

1466
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:18,880
How 'bout all these things?

1467
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:23,560
I'm afraid they're
a bit ancient.

1468
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:25,520
Where did this come from?

1469
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,680
It's Mr. Browne,
that's who it is.

1470
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:31,200
Oh, he's on his way to London.

1471
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:34,160
Mr. Browne?

1472
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,480
If you are Mr. Browne, would you be
kind enough to get down off my lap?

1473
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:42,280
It is Mr. Browne!

1474
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,680
It is you!

1475
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,960
You didn't think that
I could do that spell, did you?

1476
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:51,880
Oh, I am glad to see you.
But what about all these Germans?

1477
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:55,760
Well, as Charlie says, "What's wrong with the
substitutiary locomotion spell?"

1478
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,240
- That ought to be useful.
- No, but it isn't ready yet.

1479
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:01,280
- You saw what happened this afternoon.
- Well, we have to chance it.

1480
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:04,200
We can't let these so-and-sos get away
with their beastly little raid.

1481
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:07,920
Mr. Browne, won't you get up
off the floor, and we'll go to work.

1482
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:10,680
Herr Oberst!

1483
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:28,360
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you, Emelius.

1484
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:31,600
- Let's hope you haven't
forgotten the spell, Miss Price.
- Oh, not this time, Charlie.

1485
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,520
Found this in the castle.

1486
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,840
Probably not a magic broom, but it
might make you feel more at home.

1487
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:37,840
Well, thank you, Carrie.
That was very thoughtful of you.

1488
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:39,760
Come now, children.
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.

1489
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:50,200
Treguna...

1490
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:52,800
Mekoides...

1491
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:56,400
Trecorum...

1492
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:59,440
Satis Dee.

1493
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:21,720
Look!

1494
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:15,480
Sound the advance!

1495
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:18,600
Just in time for the kickoff.

1496
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:54,000
Steady on the left.

1497
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:57,840
Victory for England
and St. George!

1498
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:01,360
It's like a Lord Mayor's show.

1499
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:03,320
Pikemen, hold your distance!

1500
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:06,800
Treguna, Mekoides

1501
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:10,200
And Trecorum Satis Dee

1502
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:14,760
Treguna, Mekoides

1503
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:18,800
And Trecorum Satis Dee

1504
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:22,480
Treguna, Mekoides
and Trecorum Satis Dee

1505
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:29,680
Fire!

1506
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:38,120
Fire!

1507
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,920
Blimey!

1508
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:17,520
- Where's it coming from, Sergeant?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.

1509
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:20,360
- Come on, lads, after me!
- Come on! Fall in, lads.

1510
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:53,360
Good shooting, bowmen!

1511
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:02,240
Well caught, sir!

1512
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:04,840
Very good!

1513
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:13,360
Knock his block off!
That's it!

1514
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:16,600
Mr. Browne, make those children
take cover this instant!

1515
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:23,320
Are you still there, Colonel?

1516
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:25,520
I thought you'd be
on your way by now.

1517
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:33,480
You see? Things may not
be so easy for you after all.

1518
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,880
Good-bye, Colonel.

1519
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:35,720
Eglantine.
Oh, Eglantine.

1520
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:37,680
Dear Mr. Browne.

1521
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:39,800
Miss Price, we thought
they'd damaged you.

1522
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:42,680
See? No one
can hurt Miss Price.

1523
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:45,600
There they are, lads!

1524
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:47,840
I sensed something was afoot.

1525
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:50,080
All right!
Drive them into the sea!

1526
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:52,480
Firing positions, you fellas.
Both sides.

1527
02:08:58,080 --> 02:09:01,000
All right, men.
Hold your fire.

1528
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:06,760
I think we've taught
the Hun a lesson.

1529
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:10,000
He'll think twice
before coming back here again.

1530
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:14,120
It's tragic.
All your spells, your equipment-

1531
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:16,280
all gone.

1532
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:19,680
Still, I was able to perform
some small service first.

1533
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:22,560
That mean you ain't
going to be a witch no more?

1534
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:24,680
- Never?
- No, Paul.

1535
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:28,040
I realized some time ago
that I could never be a proper witch.

1536
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:31,600
When was that? Was it that first
magic moment when you laid eyes on me?

1537
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:35,280
No. It was the day
my poisoned dragon's liver arrived.

1538
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:37,680
I knew then that anyone...

1539
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:40,600
who felt the way I did
about poisoned dragon's liver...

1540
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:43,080
had no business being a witch.

1541
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:54,040
- You're certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, I think so.

1542
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:56,560
The way things are, it's
much too dangerous being a civilian.

1543
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:59,440
- Take care of yourself, gov.
- I'll do that.

1544
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:02,040
And I'll be back
before you've grown an inch taller.

1545
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:05,560
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort to the station.

1546
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:11,040
Parade, halt!

1547
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:12,960
Well, here we go.

1548
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:35,320
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, Sergeant.

1549
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:40,520
Parade, by the right.
Quick!

1550
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:43,400
March! Left! Left!

1551
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:46,040
Left, right, left!

1552
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:54,000
Suppose that's it.

1553
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:57,200
We ain't gonna have
no fun no more.

1554
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:59,440
Well, still got this,
ain't I?

1555
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:10,720
Call out the navy
Call out the ranks

1556
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:14,760
Call out the air force
Call out the tanks

1557
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:18,800
From the Cliffs of Dover
Call up the gulls

1558
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:22,560
And don't forget
the loyal territorials

1559
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:27,200
But who's digging in here
Who will defend

1560
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:31,320
Every inch of England
No matter what they send

1561
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:35,400
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard

1562
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:39,440
The soldiers of
the old Home Guard, that's who

1563
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:46,220
The soldiers
of the old Home Guard

1564
02:11:57,480 --> 02:12:00,680
I don't mind saying,
to see it all together at last,

1565
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,720
there isn't much I wouldn't do.
