1
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:26,835
JEANNE
AND THE PERFECT GUY

2
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:18,440
Can I take a message?

3
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:21,286
Call back Monday.

4
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:40,040
Jet Tours, hello.

5
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:42,526
Sorry, he just left.

6
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:45,727
You know, Fridays... Of course.

7
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:50,398
I'll tell him. Good-bye.

8
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:58,717
- Seen the runner?
- The messenger, you mean. No.

9
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,006
You're cheerful.

10
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:03,635
I'm bored.
This magazine's dumb.

11
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,275
Try reading a novel instead.

12
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:10,520
I can't read a novel here.
I keep getting interrupted.

13
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:12,245
See what I mean?

14
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:16,045
I'll put you through.

15
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:17,601
Triton, for you.

16
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:19,320
- Are you taking it?
- Not now!

17
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:20,886
They go on for hours.

18
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,482
I'll pass it to Moutier,
he just left.

19
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,517
Don't forget, Sunday at 7.

20
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:28,246
I won't.

21
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,075
Sorry, he's left.

22
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:33,045
Call back Monday...

23
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:36,404
Okay, Mr Frost?

24
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:39,076
Can't complain.
But my name's not Frost.

25
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:42,205
I sell Frost heaters.
But my name's Martin.

26
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:43,163
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:45,204
I don't mind, it suits me.

28
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,880
- What's wrong?
- The usual.

29
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:47,877
Ground floor?

30
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:52,165
- Can't you help, Jean-Baptiste?
- It's not my field.

31
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:53,601
Jean-Baptiste!

32
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,117
Well... I could try.

33
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,877
I'll get to work.
I know the way.

34
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:03,358
Good luck, Mr Frost!

35
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:04,403
Call me

36
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:06,916
when the runner...
I mean the messenger comes.

37
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:15,641
Please hold, I'll put you through.

38
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:33,045
All this is for you.

39
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:34,435
My pleasure...

40
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,279
I'll need you again later...

41
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:48,682
Nothing for you.

42
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,157
No, I leave in 5 minutes.

43
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:53,887
Work overtime if you feel like it.

44
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,759
Of course...

45
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,202
Have a good weekend!

46
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:28,202
<i>For all the workers</i>
<i>It's closing time</i>

47
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,682
<i>Now we come in</i>
<i>To clean the dirt and grime</i>

48
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:42,123
<i>With brooms at the ready</i>
<i>We clean the mess we find</i>

49
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:47,357
<i>We get things spick and span</i>
<i>We work the daily grind</i>

50
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:55,036
<i>And after all this work</i>
<i>This one long ordeal</i>

51
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:58,722
<i>Deportation from France</i>
<i>Sums up the whole raw deal</i>

52
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:02,197
<i>They can't give us papers</i>
<i>Or so they say</i>

53
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:06,679
<i>Even our kids</i>
<i>Will never be French one day</i>

54
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:15,365
<i>We spend our time</i>
<i>Cleaning for the nobs</i>

55
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:18,599
<i>We suffer in our prime</i>
<i>They never hear our sobs</i>

56
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:21,924
<i>We keep our mouths shut</i>
<i>For to toil is our fate</i>

57
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:26,444
<i>We stay here in our rut</i>
<i>We don't give in to hate!</i>

58
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:39,075
Have a good weekend.

59
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:51,759
You're man crazy, little sister.

60
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:54,805
- A new guy every day.
- I'm happy.

61
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:58,721
I should hope so,
the way you collect them.

62
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,956
I don't.
I can't resist, that's all.

63
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:06,882
- Why should I resist?
- To seem less like a slut.

64
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:08,162
Screw that.

65
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,887
- What about Jean-Baptiste?
- He doesn't know.

66
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:14,835
- You lie to them all.
- That's my problem.

67
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,885
- I love them.
- But some expect fidelity.

68
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,083
- I don't tell them.
- Great excuse!

69
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,363
I don't sleep with everyone.

70
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm sure I'll find him one day.

71
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:29,916
<i>I don't know who he is</i>
<i>Nor what he's like</i>

72
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:34,645
<i>He's not in my dreams</i>
<i>I've never seen him</i>

73
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:38,322
<i>I don't know his voice</i>
<i>Nor the colour of his eyes</i>

74
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:40,684
<i>His body's a mystery</i>

75
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:43,322
<i>His hands have no shape</i>

76
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:48,719
- <i>He has ten fingers though?</i>
- <i>He has a prick too!</i>

77
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:51,043
- <i>Him!</i>
- <i>Him!</i>

78
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:53,846
<i>My ideal</i>
<i>But I don't know it yet</i>

79
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,680
<i>He'll be here one day</i>

80
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:59,085
- <i>I'll know him.</i>
- <i>You'll know him.</i>

81
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:02,205
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>I don't know how</i>

82
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,086
<i>My heart will tell me.</i>

83
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:05,839
<i>What will it say?</i>

84
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,486
<i>He's the one!</i>

85
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:11,087
It's not Jean-Baptiste
or the messenger...

86
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:13,477
I'm not sure yet.

87
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:16,525
There's no mistaking the signs.

88
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,279
How do you know?

89
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:21,166
Give me a break. I just know.

90
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,160
If the sex is no good,
it's not love.

91
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:26,636
I can't argue with that!

92
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:03,320
Excuse me, I'm late...

93
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,281
- One for Springtime.
- Sold-out.

94
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:08,485
Excuse me, please...

95
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,156
- I forget your name.
- Jeanne.

96
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,239
- You're Francis.
- François.

97
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:17,604
What're you seeing?

98
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,281
Springtime in Paris
but it's sold-out.

99
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:22,836
Oh, I wanted to see it too.

100
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:24,839
Let's have coffee.

101
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:26,963
- Still a student?
- Come on!

102
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,846
I've moved up in the world.
I teach.

103
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:31,565
Lucky students.

104
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:34,002
With you, I'd have worked harder.

105
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:37,398
- Did you finish school?
- Just about.

106
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,366
I answer phones at Jet Tours now.

107
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:44,805
- Great for romantic weekends...
- I can't really say.

108
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:48,996
- You're married with kids?
- No, I live alone.

109
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:52,125
I haven't got
a guy to go away with.

110
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:55,563
Me neither. And I get no discounts!

111
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:58,366
You had that cute boyfriend...

112
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:00,006
Pierre, was it?

113
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,078
It's years since I saw you.

114
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,484
You couldn't know.

115
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,525
- Sorry, you've split up...
- No, he died.

116
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:10,804
- How? An accident?
- No, Aids.

117
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,878
What else these days?

118
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,959
<i>Life is full of surprises</i>

119
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:18,995
<i>Things you never hope for</i>

120
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:23,840
<i>One day the sun rises</i>
<i>And love's gone out the door</i>

121
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,039
<i>But life can be unfair</i>

122
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:31,085
<i>And bring you down, you see</i>

123
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:35,925
<i>Your happy love affair</i>
<i>Can turn into tragedy</i>

124
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:41,038
<i>You meet a guy who loves you</i>

125
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:44,360
<i>And give him all the love you can</i>

126
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:49,917
<i>You know it'll be tough to do</i>
<i>That it may not last with that man</i>

127
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:53,444
<i>Then Aids steps in the door</i>

128
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,326
<i>And you know he's going to die</i>

129
00:10:57,247 --> 00:11:01,445
<i>So you love him more and more</i>
<i>He suffers, you try and try</i>

130
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:06,198
<i>But love is not a cure</i>

131
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:09,166
<i>For a disease of this kind</i>

132
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:14,364
<i>And love can't reassure</i>
<i>The lover left behind</i>

133
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:18,284
<i>And when he dies, shit, you're sad</i>

134
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:21,559
<i>Your body yearns for his touch</i>

135
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:26,643
<i>But despite the times you've had</i>
<i>Against death, love can't do much</i>

136
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,763
<i>And then his family appears</i>

137
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:33,766
<i>They never really accepted you</i>

138
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:38,805
<i>They scorn your bitter tears</i>
<i>And your love for him too</i>

139
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,527
<i>So you end up all alone</i>

140
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:46,075
<i>Like a poor widowed wife</i>

141
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:51,478
<i>Whose husband's shroud is sewn</i>
<i>And struggles on with her life</i>

142
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:55,604
<i>But at thirty this isn't what you seek</i>

143
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,441
<i>You just can't keep on mourning</i>

144
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:03,844
<i>And taking flowers every week</i>
<i>To his grave on Sunday morning</i>

145
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,001
<i>And so you fall in love again</i>

146
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,685
<i>You believe in love and life</i>

147
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:15,683
<i>But they give you joy and then</i>
<i>They only ever lead to strife</i>

148
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:21,122
<i>Sorrow, mourning and rage</i>

149
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:24,845
<i>Take you to the depths of despair</i>

150
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:28,246
<i>You struggle at every stage</i>

151
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,244
<i>For better days to share</i>

152
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:34,039
<i>Yet you live with the grief</i>

153
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,320
<i>Of all these friends and lovers</i>

154
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:42,922
<i>Living lives so brief</i>
<i>And so mourned by others</i>

155
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:46,564
<i>Our shining dreams are rust</i>

156
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:49,920
<i>The ghosts around us prove it</i>

157
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:56,284
<i>When a faggot bites the dust</i>
<i>No one really gives a shit</i>

158
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:02,918
- Sorry, I brought you down.
- No, it was my fault.

159
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:06,320
- It's horrible. What can we do?
- Nothing.

160
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:10,645
Apart from fight.
I joined Act-Up 4 years ago.

161
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,206
I've seen them on TV.

162
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,846
You should see us for real.

163
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:16,840
Come to the march next Saturday.

164
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:19,005
Sure. I'll try to.

165
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:21,558
You won't find time...

166
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:38,164
I'm sorry,
the driver's so clumsy!

167
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:39,840
It was my pleasure.

168
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,645
I'll call you, Olivier.

169
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,006
You were in a hurry.

170
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,606
An urgent appointment?
Am I prying?

171
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,839
No, I'm always in a hurry.
God knows why.

172
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,078
I'm free all day today.

173
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,486
You're not busy?

174
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:38,636
I am now.

175
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:39,643
What?

176
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:42,486
You're going to offer me a drink...

177
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,637
You should buy me one
to apologize.

178
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:51,157
Haven't I just done that?

179
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,641
I'm running late now.

180
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,965
You were in a hurry.

181
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:51,561
I have Sunday lunch
with my parents.

182
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:56,600
You'll get told off because of me.

183
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:14,155
- Don't keep them waiting.
- Okay, I'm going.

184
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:24,126
Well... See you around...

185
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,601
Bye.

186
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:58,439
Sorry, I just realized
I can't call you.

187
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:01,555
- Got a pen?
- I'll remember.

188
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:05,521
Okay, 42293099...

189
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:11,919
See you...

190
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,680
- What a life you lead.
- Don't start, I'm tired.

191
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,556
That's what worries me.
You wear yourself out

192
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:28,395
...and you don't seem happy.
- I am happy, mom.

193
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,440
No steady boyfriend...

194
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:39,963
It's not that easy
to find someone, you know.

195
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,795
I try but I can't find anyone.

196
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:45,040
Look at your sister.

197
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:46,442
And us.

198
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,235
Sophie and you are exceptions.

199
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:52,844
Love at first sight isn't for me.
I can live with that.

200
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,881
You have to want love to find it.

201
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:59,126
Are you really looking for it?

202
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,242
At least go to bed earlier.

203
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,883
- Shit, give me a break!
- Jeanne!

204
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,283
We never taught you to swear.

205
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:11,086
True, but I left a while ago.

206
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:13,718
Be nice to your mother.

207
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,163
I am being nice.
Try to be more selfish.

208
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,887
Treat yourselves. Go on a trip.

209
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,277
Visit friends in the country.

210
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:25,519
We don't want to.
We're fine here.

211
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,963
Okay, if I keep out of your lives,
keep out of mine.

212
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,285
- Are you never on time?
- I can't help it...

213
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:39,166
- I want to dance.
- I wanted to talk...

214
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,240
- Let's go for a drink.
- No, they're waiting.

215
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:47,715
Cool it, we've got all night.

216
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,126
Good evening...

217
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:02,198
- You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

218
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:04,240
This is Nathalie...

219
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,921
Jeanne... Jean-Baptiste.
Sit down.

220
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:08,956
What'll you have?

221
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:10,276
Same as you.

222
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:11,602
Champagne.

223
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:12,961
Another bottle!

224
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:16,724
- How's the training course?
- Almost over.

225
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:19,243
- Any good?
- I've learnt a lot.

226
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,325
Management isn't easy.

227
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,846
Will it lead to a job?

228
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:25,315
Not with them.

229
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:28,167
But they've given me a few leads.

230
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:30,125
Finding work's tough.

231
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:33,006
Right, we're not in the 80s now.

232
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,886
I mean, we deserve decent pay.

233
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:37,639
We were at business school!

234
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,360
Do you have to?

235
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:41,962
Sorry, we're boring you.

236
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:45,201
Try to understand,
it's a big worry.

237
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,277
Maybe but we're here for fun.

238
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,804
Coming to Cabourg at Whitsun?

239
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,805
You bet, as usual.

240
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:55,720
And Jeanne too?

241
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,758
I can't, it's my birthday.

242
00:19:58,007 --> 00:19:59,963
We'll throw a party for you.

243
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,237
It's my sister's too.

244
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:03,596
Your twin?

245
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:06,082
My older sister.
And my mother's too.

246
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,919
All three the same week.

247
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,725
We celebrate and...

248
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,435
Too bad.
We walk, go out riding...

249
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:13,915
Some other time.

250
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,563
Thanks but I don't like horses.
They scare me.

251
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:20,962
- I won't have time.
- You work a lot?

252
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,003
Too much.

253
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:24,317
Doing what?

254
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:27,156
- I answer...
- She works with me.

255
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,637
Want to dance a tango?

256
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:00,158
<i>There's something not quite right</i>

257
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:03,526
<i>I wonder what it can be</i>

258
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:07,445
<i>Something in the air tonight</i>

259
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:11,365
<i>This isn't right for me</i>

260
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:14,283
<i>Maybe I'm in the wrong place</i>

261
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:19,005
<i>Dancing with the bourgeoisie</i>

262
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:22,999
<i>We're not of the same race</i>

263
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:29,205
<i>This isn't right for me</i>
<i>Now as we dance the tango</i>

264
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:32,405
<i>He holds me so tightly</i>

265
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:39,280
<i>And, maybe, you never know</i>
<i>He might want to marry me</i>

266
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:40,926
<i>Maybe</i>

267
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:43,925
<i>Now what am I to do?</i>

268
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,560
<i>I'm just an employee</i>

269
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:51,479
<i>His love may well be true</i>

270
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:54,841
<i>But this isn't right for me</i>

271
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:59,797
<i>Maybe I'm mistaken</i>

272
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:03,478
<i>Perhaps he doesn't love me</i>

273
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:07,238
<i>Should I wait to be forsaken?</i>

274
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:10,082
<i>Should I run, should I flee?</i>

275
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:15,925
<i>Now as we dance the tango</i>
<i>And he holds me so tightly</i>

276
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:23,404
<i>How come I don't know</i>
<i>If he truly loves me?</i>

277
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,120
<i>How can that be?</i>

278
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,764
<i>So I have the feeling</i>

279
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:47,524
<i>As he dances close to me</i>

280
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,638
<i>That for him I'm nothing</i>

281
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:54,965
<i>Just a girl who's free</i>

282
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,402
<i>I know it's not right</i>

283
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:02,758
<i>Sleeping with a guy's no key</i>

284
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:06,838
<i>For nothing here tonight</i>

285
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:09,961
<i>Will make me join the bourgeoisie</i>

286
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,687
<i>Yes, now I know why</i>

287
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:16,125
<i>He doesn't love me, not he</i>

288
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:20,477
<i>For my perfect guy</i>

289
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,322
<i>Would never bring me here,</i>
<i>you see</i>

290
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,001
<i>Yes, now I know why</i>

291
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:29,684
<i>I don't love him, not me</i>

292
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:33,923
<i>For my perfect guy</i>

293
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:37,045
<i>Would never come here, you see</i>

294
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:40,878
Come on, we're leaving.

295
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:39,165
It'll take three days to mend.

296
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:43,281
The bosses don't care.
They never use that washroom.

297
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:44,926
Theirs is perfect.

298
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:48,443
The selfishness
of the modern world!

299
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:50,080
What can we do?

300
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:51,441
In the meantime...

301
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:53,797
Any trouble, call me

302
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,156
and I'll pop in.

303
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:58,637
Okay? Bye then.

304
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:02,085
- Enjoy your weekend.
- See you soon, I'm afraid.

305
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:05,086
Is Julien still crazy about his car?

306
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:07,602
Yes but it makes a weird noise.

307
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,883
That's bad for a new car.

308
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:13,084
- It's under guarantee.
- I always forget.

309
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,602
New things are like new lovers.

310
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:18,486
If they break down,
you take them back

311
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,478
...and replace them.
- Silly...

312
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:24,126
Duck with Chinese five spice.

313
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:25,044
It's true.

314
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:26,606
Chicken with cashews.

315
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:31,326
When old lovers break down
it's no end of trouble.

316
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:34,160
- But new ones...
- New ones too...

317
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:36,921
You're so happy. A new lover?

318
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:40,440
I'll have to tell you.

319
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,560
Both trays.

320
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:44,162
Any drinks?

321
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,237
Beer?

322
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:47,159
Two Tsing-Tao beers.

323
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:00,846
58 francs as usual?

324
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:07,644
Well? Tell me.

325
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:12,803
<i>I've just met the perfect guy</i>

326
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,879
<i>When I saw him in front of me</i>

327
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:19,084
<i>I felt Cupid's arrow from the sky</i>

328
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:22,199
<i>And love handed me the key</i>

329
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:25,404
<i>Where did you meet him, please?</i>

330
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:28,604
<i>On the subway, I thought I'd die</i>

331
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:31,759
<i>I fell and landed on his knees</i>

332
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:34,885
<i>I felt so dumb, I don't know why</i>

333
00:26:35,047 --> 00:26:37,959
<i>And yet I also felt at ease</i>

334
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:41,244
<i>His first words, I cannot lie,</i>

335
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:44,524
<i>Were coarse, common and gross</i>

336
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,679
<i>Then I caught the look in his eye</i>

337
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:50,156
<i>And my heart melted to be so close</i>

338
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:54,038
<i>He smiled, said some sweet things</i>

339
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:56,596
<i>I couldn't resist his voice</i>

340
00:26:57,287 --> 00:27:00,438
<i>His deep brown eyes</i>
<i>gave me wings</i>

341
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:02,837
<i>I fell for him, I had no choice</i>

342
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,277
<i>What's he like?</i>

343
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:22,396
<i>I can't lie</i>
<i>He's perfect, I wanted him</i>

344
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:28,444
<i>His looks just made me sigh</i>
<i>And now my heart's out on a limb</i>

345
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:32,244
<i>Jeanne, again! You never say die</i>

346
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:35,319
<i>It's love that decides, not me</i>

347
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,479
<i>All these lovers, how d'you get by?</i>

348
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:41,639
<i>Right now, I only have three</i>

349
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:44,879
<i>But this one with this gentle look</i>

350
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:48,119
<i>Has a smile as sweet as any child</i>

351
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:54,004
<i>He's really got me on the hook</i>
<i>With him, I just go wild</i>

352
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:03,918
- <i>How about sex?</i>
- <i>A real high</i>

353
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:07,159
<i>Ardent, violent, an incredible guy</i>

354
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:13,079
<i>He made me scream and sigh</i>
<i>If this isn't love I want to die</i>

355
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:19,278
<i>Our longing was so great</i>
<i>We did it on the subway train</i>

356
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:22,844
<i>On the train? You couldn't wait?</i>

357
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:26,124
<i>It was fun, I'd do it again</i>

358
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,359
<i>Jeanne, this guy sounds sly</i>

359
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:32,320
<i>Not at all, when he's with me</i>

360
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:35,685
<i>In my arms, he seems so shy</i>

361
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,964
<i>As if he really needed me</i>

362
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:54,959
<i>So here's to the perfect guy</i>

363
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:58,199
<i>And the love I feel for him</i>

364
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:02,800
Aids!
End the epidemic, no more tricks!

365
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:15,957
- I'm leaving.
- Already?

366
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,647
It's a great march.
It's important.

367
00:29:19,807 --> 00:29:22,116
- I know...
- You're too much.

368
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,841
You turn up for once
then vanish.

369
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:28,238
You're not like a campaigner,
or a friend.

370
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:29,920
It's important...

371
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:33,443
- More important than this?
- I'm meeting a girl.

372
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:37,043
- You should have brought her.
- It's complicated...

373
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:40,602
Run, rabbit!

374
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:43,235
- We'll have dinner sometime.
- Sure...

375
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:48,565
- I'll call you.
- I'll be waiting, like Penelope.

376
00:29:53,807 --> 00:29:57,356
Aids is war, Act-Up says no more!

377
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:08,078
- What's all this?
- The march I told you about.

378
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:10,283
Act-Up's out on the streets.

379
00:30:10,447 --> 00:30:14,122
You're right. I'm with you,
it can't go on.

380
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:16,676
- Can I cross?
- The riot cops'll stop you.

381
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:18,758
Shit, I'm late! See you.

382
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:19,882
See you!

383
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:22,483
Your place or mine?

384
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:47,719
- Been waiting long?
- You're here now, it's okay.

385
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:52,606
- Have a good week?
- Work as usual.

386
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,486
- Not too tough?
- Can't complain.

387
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,764
As long as I get
weekends and evenings off.

388
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,805
You're so cheerful.

389
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:07,085
- Is that wrong?
- No, it's just rare.

390
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:12,036
I've been thinking of you.
That kept me busy.

391
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,046
Same here.

392
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,721
So what's the conclusion?

393
00:31:17,887 --> 00:31:19,445
Nothing, I like it.

394
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:25,119
- I'm glad I met you.
- Thank you. So am I.

395
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:31,840
What did you do?

396
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:36,315
I didn't feel too good
so I stayed at home.

397
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:40,715
- I went to the march today though.
- That's funny.

398
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:43,641
- Not really.
- I didn't mean that.

399
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:46,116
It's a coincidence.

400
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,879
Never mind...

401
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,120
You go to those marches?

402
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:53,199
Sometimes. I feel concerned.

403
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:56,241
Why? Got HIV-positive friends?

404
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:59,555
I'm HIV-positive.

405
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:06,167
That's okay, we used a condom.

406
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:11,556
- That's a new one.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...

407
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:15,319
<i>When the doctor told me I had</i>

408
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:18,604
<i>This disease, I thought: I'm dead</i>

409
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:21,277
<i>I didn't believe it at first</i>

410
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:25,326
<i>I ignored the voice that said:</i>
<i>"Tomorrow, you'll be dead"</i>

411
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:28,606
<i>I hated the world around me</i>

412
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:31,998
<i>People acted as if I was dead</i>

413
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:35,365
<i>Then I got over it and thought:</i>

414
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:39,520
<i>"Okay, I'm going to die</i>
<i>But I'm not yet dead"</i>

415
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:42,278
You won't die. I love you.

416
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:45,765
- Love never saved anyone.
- I believe it can!

417
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:47,758
- I don't.
- Don't be so hard.

418
00:32:48,487 --> 00:32:51,559
It's not me, it's my disease.

419
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:55,805
Go on, kiss me.

420
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:04,485
- <i>Have you known long?</i>
- <i>Six years, I'd say</i>

421
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:07,639
<i>I did drugs</i>
<i>And used a bad needle one day</i>

422
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,756
<i>D'you know who contaminated you?</i>

423
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,916
<i>Don't ask that, no one's to blame</i>

424
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:22,443
<i>No one set out</i>
<i>With contamination as his aim</i>

425
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:25,362
<i>The ones to blame, I know why</i>

426
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:29,361
<i>Are those who turn away</i>
<i>And let junkies die</i>

427
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:33,158
<i>I blame the government</i>
<i>I blame the jails</i>

428
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:36,763
<i>When a junkie croaks</i>
<i>No one weeps and wails</i>

429
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:40,079
<i>When you use drugs</i>
<i>You fear the cops</i>

430
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:43,796
<i>You're a hunted animal</i>
<i>And it never stops</i>

431
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:46,959
<i>I stayed in my room</i>
<i>Locked behind my door</i>

432
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:50,403
<i>I lost my friends</i>
<i>I was a man no more</i>

433
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:53,520
<i>Then I started living again</i>

434
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:57,521
<i>I have no time before life fades</i>
<i>For now I know</i>

435
00:33:58,087 --> 00:34:00,078
<i>That I'll die of Aids</i>

436
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:03,445
- You had a worried look.
- A bad dream, I guess.

437
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:07,162
- With me here?
- You can't control your dreams.

438
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,847
- I've made breakfast. Hungry?
- Yes.

439
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:14,275
Don't move.

440
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:31,516
<i>We're going to stay in bed all day</i>

441
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:36,042
<i>No one needs us out there</i>

442
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:41,761
<i>We can manage without them</i>
<i>They don't exist</i>

443
00:35:41,927 --> 00:35:44,839
<i>They don't and we don't care</i>

444
00:35:57,527 --> 00:36:01,315
<i>I want to kiss you a thousand times</i>

445
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:06,006
<i>And then a thousand more</i>

446
00:36:06,607 --> 00:36:11,522
<i>I want to lose myself</i>
<i>In your arms</i>

447
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:14,767
<i>Making love for ever more</i>

448
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:29,558
<i>We'll share a thousand kisses</i>

449
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:33,837
<i>Kisses great and small</i>

450
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:38,521
<i>Even the bitterest man on earth</i>

451
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:42,720
<i>Could never count them all</i>

452
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:52,482
<i>Sunday</i>

453
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:54,996
<i>What a glorious day</i>

454
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:59,402
<i>For once you're not in a hurry,</i>
<i>I guess</i>

455
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:10,726
<i>Please send some bread my way</i>

456
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:15,483
<i>You want me to butter it? Yes?</i>

457
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:19,961
<i>Some jam made from plums?</i>

458
00:37:20,327 --> 00:37:23,797
<i>Or honey, if you prefer?</i>

459
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:27,523
<i>I'd rather have it as it comes</i>

460
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:39,115
<i>Pass me the sugar, it's too bitter</i>

461
00:37:41,687 --> 00:37:45,123
<i>Listen to the sounds of the street</i>

462
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:48,763
<i>The hubbub, the stress below</i>

463
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:52,683
<i>Forget all that today, my sweet</i>

464
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:56,317
<i>We're here together, you know</i>

465
00:37:56,847 --> 00:37:59,884
<i>It's nice to listen to the sound</i>

466
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,638
<i>Of cars honking outside</i>

467
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:07,398
<i>When there's no one else around</i>

468
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:11,242
<i>And I'm here with you at my side</i>

469
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:21,879
<i>You've lovely skin without a doubt</i>

470
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:25,882
<i>I love your tender touch</i>

471
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:32,156
- <i>All day long to laze about</i>
- <i>Idling, not doing too much</i>

472
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:35,275
<i>We'll share a thousand kisses</i>

473
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:39,646
<i>Kisses great and small</i>

474
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:43,163
<i>Even the bitterest man on earth</i>

475
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:46,524
<i>Could never count them all</i>

476
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:12,517
I don't believe it.

477
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:16,317
- You're never on time.
- My life's complicated.

478
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:20,840
- It's Sunday. What can we do?
- Let's go up to the Sacré-Coeur.

479
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:24,037
They sell fun stuff there.

480
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:27,358
- Not the Sacré-Coeur!
- Don't start. I have no choice.

481
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:30,921
This black guy sells jewellery there.

482
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:32,725
Perfect for my sister.

483
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:36,596
- Maybe for your mom too?
- It wouldn't suit her.

484
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:39,235
- Why?
- My parents are old.

485
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:41,557
They're both almost 60.

486
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:46,676
- Did they meet late?
- No, they were very young.

487
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:49,407
They got married right away.

488
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,481
They were too happy to have kids?

489
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:54,285
No, it's a sad story.

490
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:57,600
My brother and sister
died in a car crash.

491
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:59,644
Grandad was driving.

492
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:02,958
- Shit, I'm sorry.
- I never knew them.

493
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:07,043
My parents lived alone
for ten unhappy years.

494
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:09,717
Then mom decided
she wanted kids.

495
00:40:09,887 --> 00:40:12,526
The three of us arrived later.

496
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:15,918
- Wasn't it tough?
- No, we were happy.

497
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:19,558
They were so glad,
they really pampered us.

498
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:22,799
- Spoiled me, hasn't it?
- Not that much.

499
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:26,444
That's why birthdays
are so important.

500
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:29,156
- D'you love your parents?
- Of course.

501
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,841
They hassle me to get married

502
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:33,725
but that's normal, huh?

503
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:36,557
Mom wants grandchildren.

504
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:39,799
My sister's not ready
and I'm too young, huh?

505
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:40,877
Of course.

506
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,725
Olivier, what is it?

507
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:48,842
A weak spell.

508
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:51,237
What? Does it happen often?

509
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:55,516
Only when I skip lunch.

510
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,959
That's my fault.

511
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,646
No, it's okay.

512
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:06,282
- I was scared, I thought...
- What did you think?

513
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:11,404
- Nothing, I don't know...
- That I was going to drop dead?

514
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:15,324
- Don't say that!
- I'm sorry.

515
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:18,160
I don't like talking about it,
not with you.

516
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,476
Let's not worry. I'm fine.
I'm just HIV-positive.

517
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,686
There's no need to worry.
Okay?

518
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,605
Let's change the subject.

519
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:33,680
Good idea...

520
00:41:33,847 --> 00:41:35,838
- Shall we go?
- Let's eat first.

521
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,122
Good, isn't it? Really tasty.

522
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:46,362
A photo?

523
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:50,441
- Come on, you're cute.
- I hate photos...

524
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:52,325
You can't refuse her.

525
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:55,160
- You can't refuse.
- If you insist.

526
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:56,516
He can't!

527
00:41:56,687 --> 00:41:57,836
There you go.

528
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:07,405
I like it.

529
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:11,522
- Don't let people see it.
- I'll keep it for myself.

530
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:17,756
Hi!

531
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,800
Hello, sweetheart.

532
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:26,001
Roast lamb...

533
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:27,680
You're here, dear.

534
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:29,957
- With your sister?
- No, by train.

535
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:31,879
I'll go and change.

536
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:46,680
<i>You're here.</i>

537
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:50,157
<i>I didn't hear you.</i>
<i>Are you hiding?</i>

538
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:52,958
<i>I was getting ready. Alone.</i>

539
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:57,598
- <i>I'm disturbing you.</i>
- <i>No, I'm glad to see you.</i>

540
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:00,964
<i>Sit down.</i>
<i>Tell me about life in the army.</i>

541
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:03,476
<i>It'll bore you, believe me.</i>

542
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:07,686
- <i>What about you?</i>
- <i>I kind of like it.</i>

543
00:43:09,847 --> 00:43:11,644
<i>I'm re-enlisting.</i>

544
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:15,082
<i>That's an odd idea.</i>

545
00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:19,365
<i>I can't find a job.</i>
<i>Besides, I like it.</i>

546
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:22,002
<i>I'm not saying you're wrong...</i>

547
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:24,645
<i>But I don't understand.</i>

548
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:31,484
<i>I like sport, I like marching</i>

549
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:34,838
<i>I like nights out with my pals</i>

550
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:38,556
<i>Being in a bar, a glass in my hand</i>

551
00:43:39,087 --> 00:43:40,805
<i>That's the life for me</i>

552
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:43,322
<i>Still, it's an odd life</i>

553
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:49,441
<i>You can't see why I belong</i>
<i>Never thinking all the day</i>

554
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:55,082
<i>Following the guys, marching along</i>

555
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:58,165
<i>Obeying without delay</i>

556
00:43:58,487 --> 00:44:02,196
<i>It's a good life</i>
<i>No stress or strife</i>

557
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:05,757
<i>It shows you the way</i>
<i>To go from day to day</i>

558
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:07,201
<i>Never worry</i>

559
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:09,403
<i>It's all done for you</i>

560
00:44:09,687 --> 00:44:12,599
<i>You obey</i>
<i>And even give orders too</i>

561
00:44:13,247 --> 00:44:15,442
<i>You're weird, brother dear</i>

562
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,920
<i>I'm not bothered, is that clear?</i>

563
00:44:19,087 --> 00:44:22,318
<i>That's how I am but I don't care</i>

564
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:26,082
<i>I never liked school, I think</i>

565
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,444
<i>I don't like work, I love fresh air</i>

566
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:33,803
<i>I like a laugh and a good drink</i>

567
00:44:34,927 --> 00:44:38,203
The army changes a guy
but this is crazy!

568
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:40,085
We're waiting for you.

569
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:42,477
I was just getting ready.

570
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,758
I've been busy all day.

571
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:49,517
- Brought your boyfriend?
- No, it's too soon.

572
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,884
- But I will, I promise.
- Mom was hoping...

573
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:54,400
Are we eating?

574
00:44:55,647 --> 00:44:59,162
- Rémi's re-enlisting.
- That's his problem.

575
00:44:59,327 --> 00:45:00,965
Yes but I mean...

576
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:04,446
Just one more.

577
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:05,881
It's delicious.

578
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:08,038
There, a lovely slice.

579
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:14,564
- Rémi first...
- Rare, please.

580
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:16,399
I'll have that thick one.

581
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:19,559
- What about Jeanne?
- I'll wait for dessert.

582
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:22,801
A kiss first...

583
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:30,080
This one's for Jeanne,
this one for Sophie

584
00:45:31,967 --> 00:45:34,197
and this for mom.

585
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:37,038
Present time!

586
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:41,722
- Hurry up!
- Wait for me!

587
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:44,516
Sit down!

588
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:46,245
- What is it?
- A film.

589
00:45:46,487 --> 00:45:47,363
Okay...

590
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:52,516
<i>A Streetcar Named Desire?</i>

591
00:45:52,687 --> 00:45:53,915
It's too hard.

592
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:55,645
<i>Some Like It Hot?</i>

593
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:57,719
- Not that.
- Backside...

594
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:00,359
Legs...

595
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:02,724
- Thigh...
- Legs Diamond!

596
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:04,445
Legs Diamond, is that it?

597
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:06,046
Another one...

598
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:10,360
Is something wrong between you?

599
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:14,200
No, it's me. She's perfect.

600
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:17,279
She's pretty, intelligent, funny,

601
00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:19,165
and she likes me.

602
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:21,966
So what more do you want?

603
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:24,965
What more? 10 years, 20...
I want a life!

604
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,160
I want time to love and be happy!

605
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:31,166
Why bother loving
if it leads to death?

606
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:34,800
I ought to end it before it's too late.

607
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:38,597
Someone will always suffer
whatever you do.

608
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:40,718
I know, we can't avoid it.

609
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:45,240
- But I'd rather limit the damage.
- Thanks a lot!

610
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:48,001
I just don't want others to suffer.

611
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,126
I wish I didn't care.
I'd have good time and split.

612
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:55,403
But I can't do that.

613
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:58,925
When I'm with her, time stands still.

614
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:00,965
I'm hooked, see.

615
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,401
Don't freak out about it.

616
00:47:05,647 --> 00:47:09,322
Maybe she's not so mad about you.
Maybe she'll leave.

617
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:13,886
You're the one who's ill.
What do you care about others?

618
00:47:14,047 --> 00:47:18,040
- Especially some girl you just met.
- Right, she's a girl...

619
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:22,405
- You goddam faggot!
- You're talking sense at last.

620
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:25,276
Let's go and get smashed.

621
00:47:25,447 --> 00:47:26,926
It'll help.

622
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:30,483
A gay bar, okay?
I can't take straight ones.

623
00:47:33,047 --> 00:47:34,799
I'm putting you to bed.

624
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:08,803
- May I help you?
- Yes.

625
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:11,527
- What are you looking for?
- A novel.

626
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:15,766
We have quite a few.
Can you be more specific?

627
00:48:19,047 --> 00:48:22,039
- Who's it for? Your girl?
- I suppose.

628
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:25,523
- What does she like?
- Romantic stuff, I guess.

629
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:27,643
Sure, don't we all?

630
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:32,597
Not this one... It's a best-seller
but it's no good.

631
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:35,796
If she likes it,
she doesn't deserve you.

632
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:39,406
- She doesn't like that writer.
- Very well...

633
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:42,997
There's Duras
but she's probably read them all.

634
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:47,002
I don't know.
Maybe it's a bit too...

635
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:51,440
- It's for her birthday.
- Right, too intellectual.

636
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:54,361
Something less high-brow...

637
00:48:56,087 --> 00:48:59,079
<i>I live here among all these books</i>

638
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:02,205
<i>I sell to all and sundry</i>

639
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:05,360
<i>To handsome guys with good looks</i>

640
00:49:05,807 --> 00:49:08,605
<i>To women blond and sultry</i>

641
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:11,043
<i>Men come in for romance</i>

642
00:49:12,207 --> 00:49:15,324
<i>Women go for the weepy style</i>

643
00:49:15,607 --> 00:49:18,644
<i>And kids, with just one glance</i>

644
00:49:18,927 --> 00:49:21,885
<i>Find tales set on a magic isle</i>

645
00:49:22,607 --> 00:49:25,804
<i>I sell fiction, I sell dreams</i>

646
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:28,965
<i>True-life tales, best-sellers</i>

647
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:32,439
<i>Even guides to get-rich schemes</i>

648
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:35,559
<i>Long novels and novellas</i>

649
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:38,685
<i>Lovers come to me to find</i>

650
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:41,999
<i>Books for their own lovers</i>

651
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:45,359
<i>Book of the romantic kind</i>

652
00:49:45,647 --> 00:49:49,037
<i>To show there are no others</i>

653
00:49:49,407 --> 00:49:52,399
<i>I live here among these books</i>

654
00:49:52,927 --> 00:49:55,646
<i>I share them all around</i>

655
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:59,039
<i>They pass as easy as looks</i>

656
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:02,160
<i>Spreading love unbound</i>

657

<i>People know the books</i>
<i>they've found</i>

658
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:09,363
<i>Will spread love all around</i>

659
00:50:16,207 --> 00:50:19,563
<i>What about this one here?</i>

660
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:23,843
<i>It's not her style, see</i>

661
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:28,397
<i>Why not this one here?</i>

662
00:50:29,407 --> 00:50:32,922
<i>It's set across the sea</i>

663
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:36,677
- <i>Do you know it?</i>
- <i>Of course I do!</i>

664
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:41,237
- <i>Will she like it?</i>
- <i>I'm sure she will</i>

665
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:45,875
<i>One look at you and I knew</i>

666
00:50:46,407 --> 00:50:50,116
<i>This'll give her such a thrill</i>

667
00:50:51,527 --> 00:50:55,042
<i>How can you be so sure?</i>

668
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,966
<i>Because your smile's so pure</i>

669
00:51:24,527 --> 00:51:26,597
<i>Will you take it then?</i>

670
00:51:44,287 --> 00:51:45,959
Where've you been?

671
00:51:46,287 --> 00:51:47,720
I was away.

672
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:50,805
Too bad,
there was this really wild rave.

673
00:51:50,967 --> 00:51:52,878
I wouldn't have come anyway.

674
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:54,082
What's up?

675
00:51:54,287 --> 00:51:55,766
I didn't want to see you.

676
00:51:58,967 --> 00:52:00,161
It's for you.

677
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:02,887
It's important. Sirène Express.

678
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:06,360
- Wait there.
- Where could I go?

679
00:52:09,687 --> 00:52:11,518
I'm putting you through.

680
00:52:33,927 --> 00:52:35,963
Want to go dancing next weekend?

681
00:52:36,247 --> 00:52:38,238
With Richard and Nathalie?
No thanks!

682
00:52:38,767 --> 00:52:39,995
Some other time.

683
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:43,281
We'll see a movie or a play.

684
00:52:43,687 --> 00:52:46,201
We can go to the sea too.

685
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:49,120
How about the Basque Coast?

686
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:51,198
A weekend package.

687
00:52:51,447 --> 00:52:54,041
- It's summer there already.
- I'm too busy.

688
00:52:55,007 --> 00:52:57,680
- Something simpler...
- No, forget it.

689
00:52:57,847 --> 00:52:59,519
I'm not going out with you.

690
00:52:59,727 --> 00:53:01,479
You want to dump me?

691
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:04,162
Hold the line, please.

692
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:05,959
Come on, let's talk.

693
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:08,362
You'll get me fired!

694
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,365
I'll vouch for you.

695
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:13,963
No, this isn't Radio Nostalgie.

696
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:16,556
Sorry, I don't know their number.

697
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:19,083
You're hurting me!

698
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:22,199
- Let me answer.
- They can wait, I can't.

699
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:24,799
My contract ends soon.

700
00:53:25,007 --> 00:53:28,522
- So? Good riddance.
- It can't end like this.

701
00:53:28,687 --> 00:53:30,917
Cut it out! What are you doing?

702
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:34,683
Cut it out! Let me go!

703
00:53:36,287 --> 00:53:37,686
We can be alone here.

704
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:39,718
Are you out of your mind?

705
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,401
You bastard! Stop or I'll scream!

706
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:54,926
I'm sorry.

707
00:53:55,287 --> 00:53:57,801
Tidy yourself up, you're a mess.

708
00:53:58,367 --> 00:53:59,163
Mr Martin?

709
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:01,039
- Not Mr Frost?
- It's not your name.

710
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:02,202
I liked it.

711
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:03,516
We were checking.

712
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:05,678
- And?
- Clogged again.

713
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:08,003
I called in on my way home.

714
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:10,364
I'll sort it out.

715
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:13,806
It needs a major overhaul.

716
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:16,043
We'll call you. Thanks.

717
00:54:17,927 --> 00:54:18,723
Have a good evening.

718
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,366
You too, Mr Frost.

719
00:54:38,247 --> 00:54:41,125
<i>What do they do in here</i>
<i>To clog it every day?</i>

720
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:44,319
<i>What's down there?</i>
<i>What's in the way?</i>

721
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:47,479
<i>Something's in the spout</i>
<i>I should mend it now</i>

722
00:54:47,647 --> 00:54:48,523
<i>Too bad</i>

723
00:54:48,727 --> 00:54:50,683
<i>The day's over anyhow</i>

724
00:54:50,847 --> 00:54:52,997
<i>Plumber, do your job</i>

725
00:54:57,087 --> 00:55:00,204
<i>Plumber, ply your trade</i>

726
00:55:00,847 --> 00:55:03,805
<i>Why should I care</i>
<i>If it's clogged, see?</i>

727
00:55:04,007 --> 00:55:06,646
<i>It's a lucky break</i>
<i>It means more work for me</i>

728
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:09,760
<i>If I weren't here</i>
<i>lt'd go on and on</i>

729
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:12,162
<i>Without me,</i>
<i>They'd never use the john</i>

730
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:15,317
<i>Plumber, what a great job</i>

731
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,236
<i>Plumber</i>

732
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:24,359
<i>What a great trade</i>

733
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:52,202
Are you okay?

734
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,002
It's just a cold.

735
00:55:56,207 --> 00:55:58,596
I'll get some cough medicine.

736
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:09,046
I always take this.

737
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:12,326
Forget it,
I take enough medicine.

738
00:56:15,087 --> 00:56:16,839
Herb tea and honey then.

739
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:23,045
- I hate herb tea.
- It would do you good.

740
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:31,165
I have to go.

741
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:39,679
You could stay in bed.

742
00:56:39,847 --> 00:56:42,520
Have your tea and you'll feel better.

743
00:56:50,127 --> 00:56:52,083
Take care, okay.

744
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:54,441
Excuse me...

745
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:58,085
- Olivier Lagrange, please.
- Room 19-20.

746
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,562
- Can I see him?
- Yes, he's awake.

747
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:04,476
- He'll be pleased to have a visit.
- Yes, I know.

748
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:09,685
- Okay?
- Yes.

749
00:58:12,847 --> 00:58:13,757
Thanks for coming.

750
00:58:13,967 --> 00:58:15,764
You call, here I am.

751
00:58:16,647 --> 00:58:20,162
I'm just checking on you.
Don't let me tire you.

752
00:58:20,447 --> 00:58:23,245
A good campaigner's just
what I need.

753
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:25,484
Okay?

754
00:58:25,687 --> 00:58:27,643
Act-Up, you mean?

755
00:58:27,887 --> 00:58:30,321
The same as usual.

756
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:35,125
How's the book going?

757
00:58:35,287 --> 00:58:38,723
- What's it about?
- It's my thesis. I've finished.

758
00:58:39,087 --> 00:58:40,839
I defend it next month.

759
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:45,363
- You must be pleased.
- Yes, I'm very happy.

760
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:47,444
You should be. And proud.

761
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,360
- What's it on? Remind me.
- Activism.

762
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,475
I stick with what I know, see.

763
00:58:53,807 --> 00:58:57,322
I write about my own acts,
other people's acts.

764
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:00,280
That's good.

765
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:16,123
What will it get you?

766
00:59:16,407 --> 00:59:17,522
Nothing...

767
00:59:22,647 --> 00:59:24,956
Maybe a university job.

768
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:29,517
That's good for you.
Good work, good pay.

769
00:59:30,727 --> 00:59:32,957
Cute young students...

770
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:34,395
Stupid...

771
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:37,001
It'll be a great life.

772
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,477
Sorry, I have black-outs.

773
00:59:43,807 --> 00:59:45,843
I'm glad you came.

774
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:50,362
I don't feel too good.

775
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:56,438
- I can't stand the medication.
- It helps though.

776
00:59:57,407 --> 01:00:01,878
I'm always tired.
Nothing works anymore.

777
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:08,085
Maybe a new therapy will.

778
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:14,682
- Maybe I don't want to fight.
- Olivier, come on...

779
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:20,317
I don't want to stay here.

780
01:00:22,607 --> 01:00:23,756
I'm afraid.

781
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:36,364
- Fancy meeting you here.
- I come here often.

782
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:39,803
- A second home but no fun.
- I can imagine.

783
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:42,879
Sorry, a friend's in a bad way.

784
01:00:43,327 --> 01:00:45,887
He's had enough,
he wants to give up.

785
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:48,958
- What about you?
- I'm fine!

786
01:00:49,127 --> 01:00:50,321
No, why're you here?

787
01:00:50,487 --> 01:00:52,637
I'm visiting a friend.

788
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:54,886
Nothing serious?

789
01:00:56,527 --> 01:01:00,122
- Something going on?
- You're too curious!

790
01:01:00,967 --> 01:01:03,435
I won't keep you. You're late.

791
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:05,801
Give him my love.

792
01:01:05,967 --> 01:01:07,320
Sure!

793
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:08,722
Jealous too...

794
01:01:28,927 --> 01:01:30,679
I woke you.

795
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:34,005
No, I wasn't asleep. I was thinking.

796
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:38,438
- Flowers... That's sweet.
- I've brought fruit too.

797
01:01:40,607 --> 01:01:44,600
- How was your day?
- Just work, nothing much.

798
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:48,605
Nothing much has happened
since I met you.

799
01:01:48,887 --> 01:01:51,276
- I mean nothing equivalent.
- Jeanne...

800
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:56,837
And you? Do you feel better?

801
01:01:57,607 --> 01:01:59,996
Yes, don't worry. I'll be okay.

802
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:04,762
When you get out,
I'll look after you.

803
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:12,086
I'd rather
you didn't come tomorrow.

804
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:16,844
- Fine but why?
- Because my parents are coming.

805
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:19,800
You don't want me to meet them?

806
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:21,606
It's not that.

807
01:02:21,927 --> 01:02:25,203
This isn't the best place
for an introduction.

808
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:29,561
I'd rather be alone with them.

809
01:02:33,047 --> 01:02:37,086
- D'you mind? You do understand?
- It's a bit stupid but...

810
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:41,001
You can always call me.

811
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:43,926
I couldn't go a day without calling.

812
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:48,084
Surely I can say I love you,
that I'm fond of you...

813
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:57,877
<i>I've had a lot of lovers, you know</i>

814
01:02:59,647 --> 01:03:02,445
<i>So many guys in my life</i>

815
01:03:04,087 --> 01:03:07,477
<i>I've fallen in love so often</i>

816
01:03:08,807 --> 01:03:11,958
<i>But I loved with passion though</i>

817
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:16,165
<i>I was seeking an ideal</i>

818
01:03:17,367 --> 01:03:20,439
<i>From heart to heart, bed to bed</i>

819
01:03:21,687 --> 01:03:24,884
<i>I was always so delighted</i>

820
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:29,357
<i>I loved, it was so real</i>

821
01:03:30,647 --> 01:03:33,844
<i>I loved them</i>

822
01:03:34,647 --> 01:03:37,764
<i>I loved holding them too</i>

823
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:41,920
<i>I loved them</i>

824
01:03:43,527 --> 01:03:46,599
<i>But I never loved them like you</i>

825
01:03:48,207 --> 01:03:51,961
<i>But I was always disappointed</i>

826
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:56,123
<i>I never found Mr Right</i>

827
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,682
<i>And in their arms at night</i>

828
01:04:01,847 --> 01:04:04,919
<i>I could see no point to it</i>

829
01:04:06,127 --> 01:04:09,278
<i>As I searched for my ideal</i>

830
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:13,716
<i>Between nights of love</i>
<i>and gloomy days</i>

831
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:17,798
<i>I found men set in their ways</i>

832
01:04:18,767 --> 01:04:22,362
<i>And others so boringly real</i>

833
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:26,717
<i>Yet I loved</i>

834
01:04:27,487 --> 01:04:31,002
<i>I loved their bodies next to mine</i>

835
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:35,522
<i>Still I loved</i>

836
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:39,483
<i>I hoped, waiting for a sign</i>

837
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,796
<i>One day you appeared</i>
<i>out of the blue</i>

838
01:04:46,287 --> 01:04:49,563
<i>That morning on the subway car</i>

839
01:04:50,727 --> 01:04:54,481
<i>I saw the beauty of what you are</i>

840
01:04:55,487 --> 01:04:58,797
<i>And I offered up my heart to you</i>

841
01:04:59,727 --> 01:05:03,003
<i>Your touch was like a fantasy</i>

842
01:05:03,927 --> 01:05:07,442
<i>My body melted into yours</i>

843
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:11,756
<i>This time I knew the cause</i>

844
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,917
<i>I'm here to share your destiny</i>

845
01:05:16,887 --> 01:05:20,323
<i>You loved me</i>

846
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:24,801
<i>And you held me tight</i>

847
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:28,406
<i>I loved you</i>

848
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:32,837
<i>I need you every single night</i>

849
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:37,117
<i>I've found you</i>

850
01:05:38,247 --> 01:05:42,081
<i>In your arms, our love grew</i>

851
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:47,081
<i>I loved you</i>

852
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:51,962
<i>And I'll love no one but you</i>

853
01:05:58,807 --> 01:06:01,480
<i>What are you telling me?</i>

854
01:06:02,887 --> 01:06:06,163
<i>The story of our love...</i>

855
01:06:06,327 --> 01:06:08,841
<i>Why are you telling me?</i>

856
01:06:09,607 --> 01:06:13,202
<i>I needed to say it</i>

857
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:16,765
<i>It's going to change, you'll see</i>

858
01:06:17,127 --> 01:06:19,846
<i>But will you forgive me?</i>

859
01:06:20,327 --> 01:06:24,240
<i>Forgive you for what?</i>

860
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:30,006
<i>For not loving you enough</i>
<i>For not ending all that stuff</i>

861
01:06:31,927 --> 01:06:35,806
<i>There were others too</i>
<i>Who held me just like you</i>

862
01:06:36,007 --> 01:06:39,397
- <i>It doesn't matter...</i>
- <i>I let others kiss me</i>

863
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:42,605
<i>Just as you had done</i>
<i>Forgive me</i>

864
01:06:42,807 --> 01:06:46,686
<i>Hold me tight now</i>

865
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:52,480
<i>Olivier, I can't live without you</i>
<i>Forgive me</i>

866
01:06:52,687 --> 01:06:55,155
<i>It doesn't matter</i>

867
01:07:18,007 --> 01:07:21,443
<i>It doesn't matter</i>

868
01:07:32,727 --> 01:07:37,403
<i>It doesn't matter anymore</i>

869
01:07:41,607 --> 01:07:44,599
So what?
You saw a guy in a bad way?

870
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:47,727
- You couldn't find the right words?
- No.

871
01:07:47,887 --> 01:07:51,038
There I was, helpless, incapable,
pathetic...

872
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,205
forced to be pathetic.

873
01:07:53,687 --> 01:07:56,247
I don't know
why he wanted to see me.

874
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:01,157
He must have closer friends.

875
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:05,076
- Act-Up makes you a specialist.
- Specialist, my ass!

876
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:07,802
I don't specialize in the dying!

877
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:10,765
- Accept it.
- I went there, didn't I?

878
01:08:11,007 --> 01:08:14,522
But others do "counselling"
better than me.

879
01:08:14,687 --> 01:08:17,326
Why did he want to talk to me?
I was pathetic.

880
01:08:21,367 --> 01:08:24,757
- Perhaps he's in love with you.
- A dying guy, thanks...

881
01:08:25,207 --> 01:08:27,357
He's straight, he's got a girl.

882
01:08:28,127 --> 01:08:31,085
I think so.
He told me all about her.

883
01:08:32,727 --> 01:08:35,639
He wanted to split up
so she wouldn't see him ill.

884
01:08:35,887 --> 01:08:38,481
- It scared him.
- Understandable...

885
01:08:38,927 --> 01:08:41,964
I wonder...
Maybe he has left her.

886
01:08:42,967 --> 01:08:45,356
I never thought to ask him.

887
01:08:45,727 --> 01:08:48,400
I was paralysed.

888
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:52,279
I never mentioned her.
I'm pathetic!

889
01:08:52,927 --> 01:08:55,760
You're a perfect guy.
And I love you.

890
01:09:07,087 --> 01:09:07,963
What d'you want?

891
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:09,879
- Have dinner with me.
- Piss off.

892
01:09:10,127 --> 01:09:13,802
- I want to apologize.
- It's too late, you jerk.

893
01:09:14,327 --> 01:09:17,956
- Why so aggressive?
- Just get off my back!

894
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,839
Don't you get it?

895
01:09:20,047 --> 01:09:21,844
- Is there someone else?
- People are watching!

896
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:24,396
- That bothers you?
- I'm in a hurry.

897
01:09:24,647 --> 01:09:27,923
- I've a right to know.
- Okay, fine.

898
01:09:28,127 --> 01:09:30,322
Yes, I love another guy.

899
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:32,796
But he's not why I left you.

900
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:35,322
You weren't the only one.
Okay, I loved you

901
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:38,479
but it's over.
I'm not sleeping with you.

902
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,082
Asshole!

903
01:09:56,447 --> 01:09:58,881
NO ADMITTANCE
STERILE ENVIRONMENT

904
01:10:05,527 --> 01:10:08,599
- Why all the precautions?
- Against infection.

905
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:13,443
- What? Olivier's fine.
- He left yesterday.

906
01:10:13,607 --> 01:10:17,441
I called three times yesterday,
he never said!

907
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:18,756
That's all I know.

908
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:23,443
- Where did he go?
- Ask admissions or my colleague.

909
01:10:24,167 --> 01:10:25,680
She's on duty at 9:00 p.m.

910
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,519
Why wasn't I told?

911
01:10:27,887 --> 01:10:31,482
Sorry, I'm busy.
We have a lot of patients...

912
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:42,280
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

913
01:10:42,647 --> 01:10:44,478
I had a close friend here.

914
01:10:44,647 --> 01:10:47,559
He's left
and I want to know where he is.

915
01:10:47,847 --> 01:10:51,476
We don't always know
where the patients go.

916
01:10:51,887 --> 01:10:54,355
Couldn't the nurse tell you?

917
01:10:54,567 --> 01:10:58,355
- She wasn't on duty when he left.
- I'll just check.

918
01:11:02,207 --> 01:11:05,165
He was discharged.
I don't know where he went.

919
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:07,166
Excuse me...

920
01:11:07,407 --> 01:11:11,559
- Where's the maternity wing?
- First on your left.

921
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,280
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

922
01:11:14,447 --> 01:11:17,439
- Can I have his parents' address?
- I'm afraid not.

923
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:18,437
Why not?

924
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:22,163
I can't give out
that kind of information.

925
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,244
If he didn't tell you

926
01:11:24,487 --> 01:11:26,523
...he had his reasons.
- No way!

927
01:11:26,687 --> 01:11:28,723
We're in love.
I must find him.

928
01:11:29,287 --> 01:11:31,960
Don't insist, I can't tell you.

929
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:05,644
Excuse me...
What time's that nurse on duty?

930
01:12:06,247 --> 01:12:08,636
- 9:00 p.m.
- Okay, I'll wait.

931
01:12:08,887 --> 01:12:13,802
- She won't be able to help.
- I'll wait. Where else can I look?

932
01:12:14,927 --> 01:12:17,157
You can wait over there.

933
01:12:26,247 --> 01:12:27,999
You wanted to see me?

934
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:32,246
- Tell me where he is.
- His parents took him.

935
01:12:32,447 --> 01:12:35,996
- His parents?
- Yes, he wanted home nursing.

936
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:38,442
- So you know where he is.
- At his parents'.

937
01:12:38,607 --> 01:12:42,043
- Where do they live?
- I don't know.

938
01:12:43,087 --> 01:12:44,918
He must have said.

939
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:48,363
If he's your friend,
you should know.

940
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:51,087
But I don't.
You can't leave me like this.

941
01:12:51,287 --> 01:12:55,724
What can I do? If he didn't tell you,
he had his reasons.

942
01:12:55,887 --> 01:12:58,242
He had no reason. I don't get it.

943
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,405
You must realize...
He's very ill.

944
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:05,398
Many patients return home
at that stage in the disease.

945
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:11,955
If he's very ill, he needs me.
We love each other.

946
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:14,841
He'll be in touch.

947
01:13:15,087 --> 01:13:18,796
- Go home, he'll call you.
- You're right.

948
01:13:19,527 --> 01:13:23,315
Love him well,
he deserves it. He needs it.

949
01:13:24,887 --> 01:13:27,117
Give him our best wishes.

950
01:13:27,687 --> 01:13:29,757
Go on home. Be brave.

951
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,486
Get it the right way up...

952
01:13:53,647 --> 01:13:55,842
Don't you like it like that?

953
01:13:57,447 --> 01:14:00,120
Come on, move it...

954
01:14:12,167 --> 01:14:13,441
It's you!

955
01:14:15,327 --> 01:14:20,037
<i>I can't be content</i>
<i>with only the nights anymore</i>

956
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:25,122
<i>I don't want to be yours</i>
<i>only at night anymore</i>

957
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:29,718
<i>I spend my days outside your door</i>

958
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,445
<i>I want to be with you</i>

959
01:14:31,727 --> 01:14:36,437
<i>Jeanne, after dawn</i>
<i>has replaced the night</i>

960
01:14:37,127 --> 01:14:43,521
<i>Jeanne, I love you,</i>
<i>I feel your might</i>

961
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:47,839
<i>Jeanne, I love you still</i>

962
01:14:48,087 --> 01:14:52,365
<i>I want to see you</i>
<i>For I suffer</i>

963
01:14:52,527 --> 01:14:57,203
<i>In the day without you</i>
<i>I want to share</i>

964
01:14:57,807 --> 01:15:02,517
<i>That time with you too</i>

965
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:08,085
<i>I want to be with you by day</i>
<i>Will you please let me stay?</i>

966
01:15:08,247 --> 01:15:12,604
<i>Let me fall asleep at sunrise</i>
<i>My head resting on your thighs</i>

967
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:18,561
<i>I want your Sundays too</i>
<i>Not just nights alone with you</i>

968
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:22,959
<i>I want midday, I want dawn</i>
<i>And every night until morn</i>

969
01:15:24,127 --> 01:15:27,119
<i>Jeanne, I need it all</i>

970
01:15:28,207 --> 01:15:32,246
<i>Not only when you call</i>
<i>It's not the way</i>

971
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:36,002
<i>Jeanne, I want you night and day</i>

972
01:15:36,767 --> 01:15:41,204
<i>Jeanne, I love you</i>

973
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:50,036
<i>You can give me so much joy</i>
<i>Jeanne, by day too</i>

974
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:55,236
<i>A heart beats in this boy</i>

975
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:59,761
I never promised you anything.

976
01:16:12,687 --> 01:16:14,678
What are you doing here?

977
01:16:16,487 --> 01:16:19,399
- Have you come to join Act-Up?
- Why not...

978
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:22,043
I need to ask a favour.

979
01:16:27,807 --> 01:16:30,162
That friend in hospital...

980
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:32,198
He has Aids and I must find him...

981
01:16:32,407 --> 01:16:33,681
I don't get it.

982
01:16:33,887 --> 01:16:37,197
The hospital won't give me
his parents' address.

983
01:16:37,367 --> 01:16:41,155
- They can't.
- Maybe you could convince them.

984
01:16:41,407 --> 01:16:43,967
- Not if you can't.
- Act-Up can help...

985
01:16:44,207 --> 01:16:46,880
- What d'you mean?
- We could hold a march.

986
01:16:47,127 --> 01:16:49,163
You must be kidding!

987
01:16:49,407 --> 01:16:51,967
- Who is he? Do I know him?
- I doubt it.

988
01:16:52,287 --> 01:16:55,279
- Maybe he's in your files.
- Hold on...

989
01:17:01,007 --> 01:17:02,963
This isn't the CIA!

990
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:07,206
- You won't help?
- Maybe he just wants some peace.

991
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:09,517
Just respect his decision.

992
01:17:09,687 --> 01:17:11,359
Thanks for the lecture!

993
01:17:11,607 --> 01:17:13,837
You're like the hospital!

994
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:16,766
What use is Act-Up
if you can't help people?

995
01:17:18,407 --> 01:17:20,079
Thanks a lot!

996
01:17:23,607 --> 01:17:27,486
- Who's that maniac?
- Some girl I know...

997
01:17:32,207 --> 01:17:33,356
OBITUARIES

998
01:17:38,327 --> 01:17:39,123
Okay?

999
01:17:39,327 --> 01:17:41,079
Yes, no bad news today.

1000
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,760
So it's time for good news?

1001
01:17:42,927 --> 01:17:45,839
Yes, bring me breakfast
while I wait.

1002
01:17:46,247 --> 01:17:47,566
- Coming up.
- Thanks.

1003
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:53,957
<i>Health: Excellent for Gemini.</i>

1004
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:56,123
<i>Money: Try to spend less.</i>

1005
01:17:56,327 --> 01:17:58,636
<i>Love: What's going on?</i>

1006
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:01,401
<i>Why is your love life so uneventful?</i>

1007
01:18:11,447 --> 01:18:14,245
<i>Cheer up, spring's here.</i>

1008
01:18:20,407 --> 01:18:23,638
<i>You're sheer bliss,</i>
<i>pretty miss</i>

1009
01:18:24,527 --> 01:18:26,358
<i>Yes, but I'm running late</i>

1010
01:18:26,647 --> 01:18:28,638
<i>I'm afraid I can't wait</i>

1011
01:18:28,887 --> 01:18:30,923
<i>Don't run off so fast</i>

1012
01:18:31,607 --> 01:18:34,565
<i>Try to make the moment last</i>

1013
01:19:09,847 --> 01:19:13,726
- <i>Can I have more than one glance?</i>
- <i>Yes, you stand a chance</i>

1014
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:16,641
<i>I come this way</i>
<i>Every single day</i>

1015
01:19:18,007 --> 01:19:22,000
- <i>It's you I often see</i>
- <i>Are you after me?</i>

1016
01:19:22,287 --> 01:19:24,755
- <i>You're angry?</i>
- <i>Not at all</i>

1017
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:27,239
<i>See you tomorrow</i>

1018
01:20:20,047 --> 01:20:22,481
- Why didn't you answer?
- I didn't hear you.

1019
01:20:23,487 --> 01:20:26,604
What's wrong?
Why didn't you answer?

1020
01:20:28,847 --> 01:20:30,041
I have to go.

1021
01:20:30,327 --> 01:20:33,000
I have to go home to change,
I'll be late.

1022
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:34,805
I'm rubbing off on you.

1023
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:38,000
- Sure you don't want to come?
- I'm sure.

1024
01:20:39,487 --> 01:20:42,160
You're right, it'll be tedious.

1025
01:20:43,327 --> 01:20:47,115
I don't know anyone there.
I want to be alone tonight.

1026
01:20:47,327 --> 01:20:50,160
- That's not nice...
- See you tomorrow.

1027
01:20:50,807 --> 01:20:52,001
See you...

1028
01:21:02,807 --> 01:21:04,763
What's wrong?

1029
01:21:05,887 --> 01:21:07,081
Come in.

1030
01:21:08,367 --> 01:21:12,645
- We could have done dinner.
- It's okay, I can't stay.

1031
01:21:12,807 --> 01:21:13,478
Julien...

1032
01:21:13,687 --> 01:21:14,517
It's Jeanne.

1033
01:21:18,287 --> 01:21:20,437
- I'm disturbing you.
- Not at all.

1034
01:21:20,647 --> 01:21:23,684
- You were watching TV.
- It's only a video.

1035
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:26,322
- What was it?
- What's it called?

1036
01:21:26,527 --> 01:21:28,836
- A Weekend in San Sebastien.
- I read the book.

1037
01:21:29,007 --> 01:21:31,680
- Don't tell us the end.
- I'm not that mean.

1038
01:21:31,847 --> 01:21:33,758
- Want a drink?
- Please.

1039
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:37,522
Julien, can you do us
a little pick-me-up?

1040
01:21:37,727 --> 01:21:39,285
He's crazy about cocktails.

1041
01:21:39,447 --> 01:21:42,917
- A super-duper-double-whammy?
- Perfect.

1042
01:21:43,127 --> 01:21:44,162
Take your time

1043
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:45,965
so we can talk.

1044
01:21:47,447 --> 01:21:48,562
Throwing me out?

1045
01:21:53,967 --> 01:21:54,763
Go on...

1046
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:56,759
Get in the kitchen.

1047
01:21:59,407 --> 01:22:00,840
What's wrong?

1048
01:22:03,807 --> 01:22:05,479
Still thinking of him?

1049
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:07,400
He left ages ago...

1050
01:22:07,767 --> 01:22:09,519
He's forgotten me?

1051
01:22:10,207 --> 01:22:14,280
I didn't say that...
He's keeping his distance.

1052
01:22:14,967 --> 01:22:17,276
That's his decision, I know.

1053
01:22:18,007 --> 01:22:21,795
I've done everything to find him.
I know I shouldn't have.

1054
01:22:22,487 --> 01:22:25,479
But he had no right
to make me suffer like this.

1055
01:22:28,207 --> 01:22:31,961
I need to see him, Sophie,
to talk to him, to touch him.

1056
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:35,363
We were so happy together.

1057
01:22:35,567 --> 01:22:37,046
I can't forget him.

1058
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:42,277
No one's asking you to forget him.
Be patient.

1059
01:22:43,207 --> 01:22:44,925
Perhaps he'll come back.

1060
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:47,678
No, he won't come back.

1061
01:22:48,887 --> 01:22:49,956
Can I come back?

1062
01:22:50,487 --> 01:22:52,079
She should've let you stay.

1063
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:53,157
Look at those!

1064
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:54,243
Classy, huh?

1065
01:22:54,407 --> 01:22:58,286
- How do you make them?
- He's got this great shaker.

1066
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:01,155
You two are crazy.
More new stuff!

1067
01:23:01,327 --> 01:23:02,760
How do you manage?

1068
01:23:02,967 --> 01:23:05,197
- What's it all for?
- Cocktails.

1069
01:23:05,767 --> 01:23:07,678
Here I am.

1070
01:23:17,687 --> 01:23:20,360

- I'm sorry.
- Just watch out.

1091
01:24:48,967 --> 01:24:51,845
Don't get on
when the buzzer sounds.

1092
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,642
She could have hurt me.
I have a hernia.

1093
01:24:55,127 --> 01:24:57,243
- Young people don't care.
- I'm sorry...

1094
01:24:58,007 --> 01:25:00,567
Apologizing won't make it better.

1095
01:25:00,807 --> 01:25:02,763
Think before you act.

1096
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:47,726
I know you. You were on the subway
with Olivier Lagrange.

1097
01:25:49,047 --> 01:25:51,163
I landed on top of him.

1098
01:25:52,087 --> 01:25:53,645
I was often with Olivier.

1099
01:25:54,047 --> 01:25:56,720
Where can I find him?
I've been looking for him.

1100
01:25:58,127 --> 01:26:00,038
You can keep looking.

01:26:01,687 --> 01:26:04,406
You haven't heard?
He died yesterday.

1102
01:27:15,287 --> 01:27:17,243
Would you please stand...

1103
01:27:29,727 --> 01:27:32,446
It's no use staying.
We don't know anyone.

1104
01:27:32,727 --> 01:27:34,126
Let's go.

1105
01:28:00,727 --> 01:28:03,082
I don't know if he was right.

1106
01:28:03,327 --> 01:28:06,285
- About what?
- Vanishing like that.

1107
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:10,042
Then coming back dead.
Pride, perhaps.

1108
01:28:34,567 --> 01:28:35,966
To hell with it...
