1
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:07,637
We can do anything

2
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:11,598
Just you and me.
Baby. Baby. Baby

3
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:13,794
Wait and see

4
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:19,320
Hold on. Sit tight

5
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:22,481
Are you ready for a crazy ride?

6
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:26,392
You're on your own. It ain't right

7
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:29,163
Something's gotta give tonight

8
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:33,072
So if you want to run.
Run and disappear

9
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:36,355
You and I can bust our way
right out of here

10
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:39,874
- Together we can
- Shoot the moon. Stop the rain

11
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:43,440
Even ride a hurricane
if we wanna

12
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:47,637
- Together we can
- Walk into space. Save the human race

13
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:50,119
Do you think we oughta. Oughta?

14
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:51,916
- Whoa-oh
- Together we can

15
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:54,035
Shoot the moon. Stop the rain

16
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:57,474
Even ride a hurricane
if we wanna

17
00:00:57,604 --> 00:01:01,802
- Together we can
- Walk into space. Save the human race

18
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:04,882
Do you think we oughta. Oughta?

19
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:09,282
- If we take our time. We can have it all
- I don't think we're

20
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,599
- Gonna make it
- On our own

21
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:15,194
- Together we can
- Shoot the moon. Stop the rain.

22
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:19,158
Even ride a hurricane.
If we wanna

23
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:23,197
- Her foot's caught.
- Walk into space. Save the human race

24
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:26,521
Do you think we oughta. Oughta?

25
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:30,196
Walk into space.
Save the human race

26
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,043
Do you think we oughta. Oughta?

27
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:36,122
Together we can

28
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:44,319
Piñata!

29
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:47,197
So we had some technical difficulties.

30
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:51,442
I think it's a sign. Maybe we're not ready
for the talent show audition tomorrow.

31
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:51,684
Chanel, listen to me. You finally hit
that high C in the second chorus.

32
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:55,882
Chanel, listen to me. You finally hit
that high C in the second chorus.

33
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:59,883
Never happened before.
I think that's a sign that we're ready.

34
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:02,243
I did?

35
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:04,440
I did, huh?

36
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:07,681
And we hung in there like pros.
Aqua, barefoot and hungry,

37
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:09,920
you kept our harmonies tight.

38
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:14,242
Well, y'all know how you do it in Texas.
Always ride with your spurs on, girls.

39
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:16,275
And Do-re-mi, you're sore now,

40
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:19,999
but you gave 110 per cent to our fans.
How you feelin'?

41
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:22,877
It was fun. And the bruises -
they're not that bad.

42
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:25,359
Right. Now, if there is
one person who doubts

43
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:29,159
that we can be the first freshmen to win
the Manhattan Magnet School talent show,

44
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,798
speak now, or forever hold your peace.

45
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:41,963
You know what? I take a whackin'
and keep on smackin'.

46
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:44,439
Now, I am gonna be a star.

47
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:48,842
Do I have to be solo, or are you
Cheetahs ready to hit it big time?

48
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:51,273
Cheetahs!

49
00:02:52,844 --> 00:02:55,483
OK, so lights out by 9:30.

50
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:58,072
I have lessons at the Youth Center,
and tons of homework.

51
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:00,877
If I miss this bus, I'm gonna be
officially late for school tomorrow.

52
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:02,596
Lessons? You need to rest those legs.

53
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,919
- But...
- Let the girl take her lessons.

54
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:06,955
Fine. Then I'll email you
what we're gonna wear.

55
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:09,393
No. Because my computer
is still down.

56
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:12,641
Just give it to me tomorrow.
I'll see you guys later.

57
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:15,801
See, I'm still back in action.
See ya later. Bye.

58
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:18,279
That girl is always on the move.

59
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:22,317
Wait, taxi! It's called having a life,
and I've got one, too.

60
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:24,639
My trig class at NYU
starts in ten minutes.

61
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:25,799
Taxi!

62
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:29,519
You've been here for six months and
you're still scared to ride the subway?

63
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:33,000
Look, I told my daddy
I would live in New York.

64
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:35,194
I never said anything about
under New York.

65
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:38,122
It's dark and dirty and there are
mole people down there.

66
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:41,554
Girl, whatever.
Learn this, Einsteinette.

67
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,275
But you do have to get the door yourself,
you know.

68
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:53,552
- Remember me.
- Thank you.

69
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:55,117
Bye-bye.

70
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:57,439
Princess High
of the land of Maintenance.

71
00:03:57,564 --> 00:04:01,716
Hey, she makes me giggle,
and she does have the lungs of life.

72
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:07,273
Girl, it's so hard working with four girls.

73
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:12,080
I mean, it was so much easier when it
was just you and me. Divas in diapers.

74
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,957
But you know, Drinka was right.
We needed that backup, you know?

75
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:19,236
Now that we got Aqua and Do, girl,
we look and sound like a real girl group.

76
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:23,118
But what about tomorrow? I am not trying
to get crunched like corn chips. Believe it.

77
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:25,963
Listen, we have what it takes.
Now all we need is the attitude.

78
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:31,078
And when you get wobbly, think about the
dream. We could be grabbin' Grammys.

79
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,879
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

80
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,962
- I love you in the back row.
- Thank you.

81
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:39,915
We'll be jugglin'
the hottest producers -

82
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:42,638
Rodney Jerkins, Babyface,
Jackal Johnson.

83
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,595
Yeah, and all the hot designers
are callin' us.

84
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:47,636
They're like "Sorry, Dolce, I have
Gabbana on the other line."

85
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:50,562
"Please hold on."
Chuchie, it's Gucci. Get Tom Ford.

86
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:54,279
Oh, no, I wear Prada or nada. Mama.

87
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:55,553
Nada!

88
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:59,597
Please believe it. Girl, you promise me
that when we get rich,

89
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:03,034
we're gonna buy a huge penthouse
apartment, just you and me?

90
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:06,520
- Friends forever?
- Forever.

91
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:08,680
Come on, let's go.

92
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:14,472
Hold up. There's Scherezade.
That's Jackal Johnson's new girl.

93
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:19,075
I love her. That's my video, girl.
She be like...

94
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:21,354
Work it, girl.

95
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:24,598
Come on, girl.

96
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:33,798
Come on.

97
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:38,073
Yeah, come on.

98
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:42,317
That's right.

99
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:49,153
Girlfriend.

100
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,757
- I'll take that.
- Yeah.

101
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:58,840
You know we can work it.

102
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:04,714
Thank you. Thank you.

103
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:09,440
You will be seeing our faces in these
windows very soon, watch out for...

104
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:11,873
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
Toto. I forgot about Toto.

105
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,757
Mom and Dad's gonna kill me.
Come on, let's go.

106
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:18,752
Yeah, Sally, everything's great.
Oh, Sandy, yes.

107
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:23,355
Your ensemble's absolutely fabulous.
You're going to love it.

108
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:28,239
The prodigal daughter has returned. Bye.

109
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:31,162
Mom, I am so sorry I'm late.

110
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:35,599
Oh, don't apologise to me.
I think you should talk to Toto.

111
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:37,555
I can take myself to the bathroom,
thank you.

112
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:40,676
Oh, I'm so sorry, pastamuffin.

113
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:44,080
I promise, it'll never
happen again, OK? Oh.

114
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:47,724
This is the last time
I'm gonna do your chores.

115
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:50,039
Mom, I know I have been really busy,

116
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:52,553
but the talent show's
auditions are tomorrow.

117
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:56,677
- I promise you, it's gonna pay off.
- Pay?

118
00:06:56,804 --> 00:07:00,479
That's exactly what I wanted to
talk to you about. Constellation Jones?

119
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:05,678
When were you going to tell me that
she wanted to reschedule her fitting?

120
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,159
- I didn't tell you about that one?
- No.

121
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:11,640
I thought I wrote it down, Mom.
Wait, let me check in the pad.

122
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,483
Um, yeah.
"Constellation will miss Saturday."

123
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:17,243
"Call her back, she can chat today."

124
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:20,083
Oh. Right.

125
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:25,556
I did this one as the Jamaican vibe
I was feelin' for the girls. Check it, see...

126
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:28,152
Constellation will miss Saturday.

127
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:30,320
Call her back, she can chat today.

128
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:35,154
Bomp-bomp, kitty kitty. Oh, go, mama, go.
Chat-chat, kitty kitty, boop-boop...

129
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:38,356
So that's your excuse?

130
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:41,920
For making me look flaky
in front of one of my best customers?

131
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,433
Comin' up with this,
what, cheetah chatter?

132
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,634
- La donna è mobile...
- Papa!

133
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:50,313
- I need you to help me.
- Help you? I tell you what needs help.

134
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:55,794
My chicken piccata's ready for
the capers I asked you to bring home.

135
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:59,234
Capers... right. My bad.

136
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:04,677
Do me a favour, bring this pretty head
of yours down from the clouds and use it.

137
00:08:04,804 --> 00:08:07,443
I am using my head,
and once my plan jumps off,

138
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:10,442
you'll be swimming
up to your ears in capers.

139
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:13,320
And what plan might that be?

140
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:17,674
You know what?
I think that I better have a seat

141
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:22,514
because this is going to be a very
long story. Don't you think so, Papa?

142
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:28,799
OK. First prize for the talent show -
time in a real recording studio.

143
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:32,800
Where I can make a demo like a pro,
so I can put it in some big willie's hands

144
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:36,394
and it'll be ka-ching, ka-ching,
bling bling bling...

145
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:39,482
I thought it was "bling bling".
Now it's three blings?

146
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:43,800
Fame and fortune just like that, huh?

147
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:48,952
Mom, Monique Twig, Electra Breeze -
all talent show winners, all platinum.

148
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:52,838
And Jackal Johnson. He went to
Manhattan Magnet, way back in the 90s.

149
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:56,479
- Back before the Internet and all that.
- Mom, he's not that old.

150
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:59,880
But listen, the Cheetah Girls
are first in line to win this thing.

151
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:02,757
And when we do, we will be needing
buckets to bring in the ducats

152
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:07,400
when it comes raining down.
And then I will cover you in ice,

153
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:10,675
and we'll have "yes, sir" and "no, sir"
butlers and maids.

154
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:15,275
- How do you like that plan?
- I love your plan, sweetheart.

155
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:20,000
And your plans and your dreams
are very important to us.

156
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:22,957
But before we can get to
maids and butlers and ice,

157
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:27,635
we have to get to some responsibility.
So, here's my plan.

158
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:32,679
That you focus on real life
and real chores, real, real soon.

159
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:42,595
I promise I will get it together. Promise.

160
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:46,038
Come on, Caper.
Daddy needs totos.

161
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,197
Bye.

162
00:09:58,084 --> 00:09:59,517
See ya.

163
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:39,436
What is this?
What's she trying to...

164
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,119
Ma, looking for something?

165
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:51,723
Found it, huh? The bomb top
to wear to dinner tonight.

166
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:55,883
Ma, don't say "bomb". It's out.
Say "tight".

167
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:57,483
Tight. Tight.

168
00:10:57,604 --> 00:11:01,438
As in "That top is too tight
for anybody's mom to wear."

169
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:06,237
It was cold.
But the Cheetah Girls, Ma...

170
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:09,003
- Ooh, now it's working.
...were off the hook.

171
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,677
Ma, what about this?

172
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:16,159
It's cheetahlicious. Yeah.

173
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:22,716
Now this is tight, huh? You're gonna
be my daughter the fashion buyer.

174
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:25,722
No, Ma. I'm gonna be your daughter
the Cheetah Girl, remember?

175
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:27,436
Did you say somethin', mija?

176
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:31,273
Yeah, I said..."So, another date
with that French guy?"

177
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:35,238
Excuse me, but Luc is not just
"that French guy".

178
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:39,197
How would you like it if people called you
"the Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican..."

179
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,476
- They do. That's who I am.
- No.

180
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,437
I taught you that what matters
is what's inside.

181
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:49,362
And deep inside, Luc is...

182
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:51,202
very, very...

183
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,799
rich.

184
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,643
I'm just joking.

185
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:03,599
There he is. OK, my baby,
you're gonna lock up, OK? And let's see.

186
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:07,558
Pucci is staying at your dad's, so you don't
have to worry about him at all. OK? And...

187
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:09,436
I know I'm forgetting something,
I know...

188
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:14,080
- Ma? Ma? You might want that.
- Baby, you are my angel. Come here.

189
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:16,081
- Mommy...
- I'm on celly, jelly.

190
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:18,843
- OK. Mommy, I want to talk to you...
- We'll be back later, OK?

191
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:20,841
- Ma. Ma!
- I'm so late.

192
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:22,841
I love ya.

193
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:30,078
By the way, Ma,

194
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:32,638
I hit a high C today
with the Cheetah Girls.

195
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:36,957
Cheetah Girls

196
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:44,714
Could ever be

197
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:46,675
Made mistakes before

198
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:51,036
But I know I'm not perfect
It's OK cos...

199
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:53,439
- Bueno?
- Hey, Chuchie. Madrina still not home?

200
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:58,035
Nope. I guess Mr Tycoon
flew her to Paris for dinner.

201
00:12:58,164 --> 00:13:00,075
I'm still here for you, Chuchie,
you know that.

202
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:04,083
- Thanks, Bubbles.
- No problem. Hey, girl, listen to this.

203
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:07,321
I made mistakes before

204
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:10,481
But I know I'm not perfect

205
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:12,834
It's OK cos who could...

206
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:16,798
Hey, Toto, do you like that one?
Guess what, Chuchie? Toto likes it.

207
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:20,155
Is it gonna be a hit, Toto?
All right, he thinks it's a hit.

208
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:22,161
Go Cheetahs, go Toto.

209
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:24,593
Win the talent show,
we goin' straight to the top.

210
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:27,636
Yeah, let's get through
the tryouts first, a'ight?

211
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,354
As long as I give my best

212
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:33,793
It don't matter what no one says

213
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:37,280
Cos down in my heart
I got the power to make it all happen...

214
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:44,314
Hey, Chanel, how did that test go?

215
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:48,357
Are you guys sure that the Louisiana
Purchase had nothing to do with gumbo?

216
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:51,920
Chuchie, you can't drop your grades now.
I'm calling a Cheetah study session.

217
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:55,195
It's OK. I'll walk you through
the history of her story

218
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:57,963
and you can walk me
through your closet.

219
00:13:58,084 --> 00:13:58,994
A'ight.

220
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,560
- Cheetah.
- Crikey, Mackerel.

221
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:05,994
We've spotted the wild Cheetah Girls
doin' their secret girl handshake.

222
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:09,082
What would they do if they were, say,
the Elephant Girls?

223
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:14,003
Basta pasta, Derek. You too, Mackerel.
You know, we call ourselves the Cheetahs

224
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:19,323
because the cheetah is the fastest, fiercest
feline in the jungle. Let's bounce, girls.

225
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,520
I'm trying to keep it
Lite FM with you, Derek. OK?

226
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:25,078
I'm saving my energy for
the talent show, remember?

227
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:28,958
Or are you throwing in the towel
cos you know you're gonna lose?

228
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,120
See, that's what I need
to talk to you about.

229
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:34,793
See, your little project
auditions at 3:15, right?

230
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:38,234
We're at 3:30. Can we switch times?

231
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:41,436
Our setup takes time.
We use real instruments.

232
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:44,998
And help you? I don't think so.

233
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:49,276
I have an orthodontist's appointment
and my mom's gonna freak if I'm late.

234
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:54,236
Let 'em take the spot. I have to meet
with Mrs Almanac about my history test.

235
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:56,559
You know what? I'm not very
comfortable with change.

236
00:14:56,684 --> 00:15:00,359
- But how's everybody else?
- It's cutting a little tight for me, but...

237
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:04,443
- Where do you always have to go, Do?
- Nowhere. Don't worry, I'm fine.

238
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:07,362
OK, Hambone. Whatever.

239
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:13,002
Just know that you can audition
five times, but you're still gonna lose.

240
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:17,037
Keep believin', freshman.
I respect that.

241
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:19,837
But you know you're still my boo.

242
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:25,078
She likes you.

243
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,274
He's trying so hard not to like you.

244
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:29,964
And I think now would be
the proper time to point out

245
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,723
that he is extra-specially cheetahlicious.

246
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:36,314
It's a trick, you guys. Every time he bats
those long eyelashes of his,

247
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:41,074
it's just a way to bring down the hammer
on our success. Don't fall for it.

248
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:53,282
He even makes really embarrassing
things look really, really cute.

249
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:57,522
And he wants you to be his boo.

250
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:04,513
He's gonna be cryin' "boohoo"
when we win the talent show.

251
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,283
True.

252
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:09,197
Let's get out of here.

253
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:19,798
May the growl power of all the fabulous
divas who came before us be with us now.

254
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:23,234
May we use our hearts,
our brains and our courage

255
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:25,673
to reach our cheetahlicious potential.

256
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:28,477
Right here, right now.

257
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,239
Ready, girls?

258
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:35,595
- Cheetah!
- Let's do this.

259
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:38,397
OK, here we go.

260
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:41,118
OK. Be quiet.

261
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:43,314
Here, push this one.

262
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,914
When I was just a little girl

263
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:59,275
My mama used to tuck me into bed

264
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:02,680
And she'd read me a story

265
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:06,001
It always was about
a princess in distress

266
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,035
And how a guy would save her

267
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:11,634
And end up with the glory

268
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,994
I'd lie in bed and think about

269
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:16,399
The person that I wanted to be

270
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:18,674
Then one day I realised

271
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,635
The fairy-tale life wasn't for me

272
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:23,232
I don't wanna be like Cinderella

273
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:25,275
Sittin' in a dark. Cold. Dusty cellar

274
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:27,634
Waiting for somebody

275
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:30,153
To come and set me free

276
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,240
I don't wanna be like someone waiting

277
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:34,195
For a handsome prince
to come and save me

278
00:17:34,324 --> 00:17:38,203
Oh. I will survive
I know somebody's on my side

279
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,361
Don't wanna be no. No. No one else

280
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:44,203
I'd rather rescue myself

281
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:56,355
I can slay my own dragons

282
00:17:56,484 --> 00:18:01,160
I can dream my own dreams

283
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:05,562
My knight in shining armour

284
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,039
Is me

285
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:10,678
So I'm gonna set me free

286
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:12,840
I don't wanna be like Cinderella

287
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,239
Sittin' in a dark. Cold. Dusty cellar

288
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:17,434
Waitin' for somebody

289
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,839
To come and set me free

290
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:22,034
I don't wanna be like someone waiting

291
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:24,359
For a handsome prince
to come and save me

292
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:28,716
Oh. I will survive
I know somebody's on my side

293
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:30,994
I don't wanna be like Cinderella

294
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:33,433
Sittin' in a dark. Cold. Dusty cellar

295
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:35,441
Waitin' for somebody

296
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:37,794
To come and set me free

297
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:40,074
I don't wanna be like someone waiting

298
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,001
For a handsome prince
to come and save me

299
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:46,003
Oh. I will survive
I know somebody's on my side

300
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:49,434
Don't wanna be no. No. No one else

301
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:53,034
I'd rather rescue myself

302
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,193
So, Drinka, what do you think?

303
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:04,800
Drinka? Drinka, you still there? Drinka?

304
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:12,795
- Drinka, were we that bad?
- Yeah.

305
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:16,439
- Tell them. They can take it.
- I'm all right.

306
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,875
I will survive.

307
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:23,359
It's just that...

308
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:28,919
when I see you girls,
I see myself.

309
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:35,279
I mean, not now as a lowly high-school art
teacher, but as Drinka Champagne, 1977.

310
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:37,156
I had a hit.

311
00:19:37,604 --> 00:19:41,199
- Champagne bubbles of love
- Sing it, girl.

312
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:45,442
You're the only one
I been dreamin' of...

313
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:50,194
Drinka... You gotta slow down
the disco fever, Drinka.

314
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:55,398
You know what? When I see you girls,
I see, like, little Drinka clones.

315
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:57,719
Galleria, when I look at you,

316
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:00,881
I see a biracial,
hip-hoppin' version of me.

317
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:03,837
And Chanel, when I look at you, honey,

318
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:08,515
I see a hot, Latin, spicy version of me.

319
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:11,477
And Aqua, when I look at you,

320
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:14,801
I see myself as if I was from
the sassy South.

321
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:19,839
And Dorinda, when I see you,
I see you as if I was...

322
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:22,353
If you were what? Go ahead and say it.
Everyone else does.

323
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:25,760
"Dorinda's like me
if I was shrimpy and White."

324
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:28,637
If I was able to dance.

325
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:32,158
Drinka, we just want to know, are we in?

326
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:36,357
Oh, yes, honey. You are in.

327
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:42,203
But, Drinka, like, do we actually
have a chance of winning?

328
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:47,159
Oh. Yes. And I'll work with you,
just like I worked with Electra Breeze.

329
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,593
Or maybe I'll work with 'em.

330
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:52,192
Jackal Johnson? You're here?

331
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:58,402
Jackal Johnson.
My most famous student.

332
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:02,403
Well, how you doin'? You look
fabulous. What are you doin' here?

333
00:21:02,524 --> 00:21:06,403
I see that talent show banner outside,
and I wanna be back walkin' these halls.

334
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:09,641
- I still keep my hand in the community.
- The Jackal keeps it real.

335
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:14,280
And I haven't seen this much talent
on that stage since my graduation.

336
00:21:15,364 --> 00:21:18,834
Well, you know, the Cheetahs,
they're my latest project.

337
00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:21,683
You always could spot talent, Drinka.

338
00:21:21,804 --> 00:21:25,160
And now I'd like to talk to you ladies
about the next step in your career.

339
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,593
- Jackal Johnson wants to work with us.
- You see,

340
00:21:27,724 --> 00:21:30,079
I'm lookin' for the next big thing.

341
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:34,277
And I think that thing
might just have spots.

342
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:36,122
Let's get down there.

343
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:38,155
We have spots. We have spots.

344
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:46,038
Jackal, when you're ready
to talk dollars and cents, my card.

345
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:48,917
- Cheetah Girls' manager, Kid Salsa.
- Pucci!

346
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:51,683
Chanel, get your brother out of here.

347
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:54,800
Hello, Jackal Johnson.
I'm Galleria Garibaldi.

348
00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:58,519
I'm the founder of the Cheetah Girls.
I also wrote "Cinderella",

349
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:02,319
which I hope to record for you
in the near future.

350
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:04,594
Excellent. Excellent.

351
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,874
So let's set something up.
Schedule.

352
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:09,393
Hold on.

353
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:12,880
I am Dorothea Garibaldi, and there must
be some misunderstanding here.

354
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:16,679
You see, singing is just some, like,
fun side thing for our girls.

355
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:20,763
- They're not professionals.
- Mom! Mom. This is Jackal Johnson.

356
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:25,162
He's one of the biggest
record producers of my time, Mother.

357
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:30,037
Let's see, now.

358
00:22:30,164 --> 00:22:35,716
Eight Grammys, $ 20 million label deal,
multi-picture movie deal,

359
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:40,235
four houses, seven cars,
and you're allergic to dogs.

360
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:42,036
- Nice work.
- I read.

361
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:46,237
- Nice to have met you, Mr...
- Jackal Johnson.

362
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,754
Yes, Jackal Johnson.
Yes, of course.

363
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:55,440
Girls, come on. I'm gonna take us all
out to eat, OK? Get your stuff. Come on.

364
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:58,442
Jackal Johnson. But...

365
00:22:58,564 --> 00:23:03,274
Listen. Just in case, there's my card.
Your mom's no joke.

366
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:05,713
No. None. Never.

367
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:08,241
Bye, Mr Johnson.

368
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:25,719
Thanks for droppin' me off.
I just... I live right here.

369
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:29,962
- Oh, good. Watch the cars.
- OK. Bye-bye.

370
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:32,518
Lovely girl.

371
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:44,120
Dorinda seems like a real nice girl.
What are her parents like?

372
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:48,560
The only thing we know
is she has a little sister.

373
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:51,721
Her parents aren't always
up in her thing.

374
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:53,721
They trust her.

375
00:23:55,524 --> 00:23:59,563
You got in the talent show. Don't spoil this
day because you didn't get all you wanted.

376
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:02,676
At this rate, you're headed
straight to your room.

377
00:24:06,724 --> 00:24:10,080
Mama, Jackal liked my song.
That was our big chance.

378
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,638
- Didn't you think we were talented?
- Of course, sweetheart.

379
00:24:12,764 --> 00:24:15,278
You're incredibly talented.
You know I think that.

380
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:17,122
You'll be just as talented after college.

381
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:21,203
Mama, one CD and I can pay for college,
Ma. 50 times over.

382
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:24,634
Then you would not have the time to study,
you wouldn't have the grades to get in,

383
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,959
and that, my dear,
is what you call a paradox.

384
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:30,520
Some colleges don't even look at grades.
Some people don't even go to college.

385
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:33,238
- Franco?
- Galleria, you're not helping yourself here.

386
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:36,037
Papa, tell her I'm not a knucklehead.
Tell her I'm not a pazza.

387
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:38,041
- "Tell her?"
- You're not a pazza.

388
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:41,474
But you know what? You have to
listen to your mother's advice.

389
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:44,801
Now, listen. The bottom line is,
Galleria, you are too young.

390
00:24:44,924 --> 00:24:46,801
Now, I've been there,
and I know what it's like

391
00:24:46,924 --> 00:24:49,484
when a young girl gets under pressure
and cannot handle it.

392
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:52,721
Silly people do silly things, Mom.
I get good grades.

393
00:24:52,844 --> 00:24:54,880
I spend more time on my homework
than I do my hair.

394
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:58,633
I set my mind to something, and I almost
get there, and you just stand in my way.

395
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,279
What's the good of eating your
vegetables if you can't have dessert?

396
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:04,759
Strong bones and teeth.

397
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:17,233
Ma, it's not fair that
we don't get to talk to Jackal.

398
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:20,640
Honey, I think Dorothea's instincts
are right on this one, OK?

399
00:25:20,764 --> 00:25:23,039
I mean, you don't need to be
working with this Jackal.

400
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:25,883
All that platinum and those
heavy chains. It's tacky.

401
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:27,960
Ma, it doesn't matter how he dresses.

402
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:33,363
He's not like the men from Paris.
I mean, Luc... Oh! He is always on...

403
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:38,717
Ma, can you not talk about Luc for one
second? I'm really upset here. Really.

404
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:41,153
And I know what's gonna cheer you up.

405
00:25:41,284 --> 00:25:43,275
You gonna talk to Madrina
and tell her to change her mind?

406
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:45,156
Nope.

407
00:25:45,884 --> 00:25:48,762
Shopping. You and me shopping.

408
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:53,592
- OK. And then you'll talk to Madrina?
- Yes. Yes.

409
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:55,999
- Now, I have to ask you.
- What?

410
00:25:56,124 --> 00:25:59,400
What do you think about Paris?

411
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,833
- What, Luc wants you to visit?
- Mm-hm.

412
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:05,240
To visit and... to live...

413
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,594
Whoa! What?

414
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:15,437
Hello? Hold on, Bubbles.
To live?

415
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:19,079
- Promise me you'll think about it.
- Oh, I'll think about it, all right.

416
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:23,197
Oh, my God, Bubbles,
thank goodness it's you. My life is over.

417
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:25,394
She won't even let me call Jackal.

418
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:29,642
She used every excuse in the book
to ruin our lives. Well, you know what?

419
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:34,201
This isn't over. OK?
I am not dropping all of our hard work.

420
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:36,679
Juanita is trying to move
to Paris with Mr Tycoon.

421
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:40,001
Didn't they see us tonight? Don't they
know that our futures are right here?

422
00:26:40,124 --> 00:26:43,878
- Bella. Let the girl call the producer.
- No.

423
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:53,673
None of those tricks. You bat those
long eyelashes, and I say yes every time.

424
00:26:53,804 --> 00:26:56,637
No, Franco, she's too young.

425
00:26:56,764 --> 00:26:58,641
I have made so many
mistakes in my life,

426
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:01,836
and I'm determined not to have our
daughter make the same mistakes I did.

427
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:05,639
She's not going to make the same
mistakes. She will make her own.

428
00:27:05,764 --> 00:27:08,483
- That's how she'll learn.
- But what if her dreams fall apart?

429
00:27:08,604 --> 00:27:10,754
If she's older, she might be more...

430
00:27:10,884 --> 00:27:14,957
More... ready.

431
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:18,918
Cara. No one is ever ready
for their dreams to fall apart.

432
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:24,801
But when she's older, we're not going to be
there to help her put them back together.

433
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:35,474
It's sick. She dangled a shopping trip
in my face, and then lowered the boom.

434
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:39,153
Well, you know what?
Tell her no chance, no dance.

435
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:42,481
No, wait. Take the shopping trip first,
then tell her.

436
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:44,674
- Galleria?
- Wait a second. Hold on.

437
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:47,034
Your mother and I...

438
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:51,959
Girl, hold on.
Somethin' about to happen. Hold on.

439
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:03,157
Your father thinks that this would be
a good experience for you,

440
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:07,197
so you can go on and call
that record producer person.

441
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:12,082
Thank you, Mom. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

442
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,677
- But there are conditions.
- I'd better sit down for this one.

443
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:19,516
First, I will be going
to the meeting with you.

444
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:23,432
Second, if I don't like what's going on
there, we are out. Number three...

445
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:27,318
And number three,
she promises to keep an open mind.

446
00:28:31,524 --> 00:28:34,243
Chuchie, they're gonna
let me call Jackal.

447
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:36,798
- Dad comes through for me again.
- Wow.

448
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,154
We're gonna have our penthouse soon.

449
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:43,562
Oh, today has been
just so Cheetah-crazy.

450
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:47,313
Yeah. You were definitely
a little loco tonight.

451
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:49,912
Since when are you
the founder of the Cheetah Girls?

452
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:52,114
- What?
- Yeah, that's what you told Jackal.

453
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:57,318
You were all "I wrote the song 'Cinderella'
and I'm the founder of the Cheetah Girls."

454
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,004
- Yadda, yadda, yadda.
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

455
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:02,354
I was just tryin' to get in there
before my mom does.

456
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:05,399
And you know I will do
whatever's clever

457
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:09,199
to keep the Cheetah Girls on the prowl.

458
00:29:10,564 --> 00:29:13,362
Yes. Thank you very much.

459
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:15,440
Yes, we will be awaiting your call.

460
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:18,203
Have a wonderful day. Bye-bye.

461
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:23,239
Well, she's gonna call us back for a time
on Friday so we can meet Jackal Johnson.

462
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:26,754
- Oh, yeah, I knew it.
- Cheetah power.

463
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:31,912
It's all over the school
about your 15 minutes of Jackal fame.

464
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:35,557
Well, you know, we're very fortunate.

465
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:38,721
Yeah, while you guys were
crossing paths with Jackal Johnson,

466
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:42,883
we rushed to a lecture
with the great Wynton Marsalis.

467
00:29:43,004 --> 00:29:46,679
Actually, we couldn't afford tickets, so
we drank mochaccinos across the street.

468
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,556
- Well, I had hot chocolate...
- Wynton came in.

469
00:29:48,684 --> 00:29:51,118
He sat two tables down,
and we exchanged ideas.

470
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:53,838
No, no, no, man.
You handed him a sugar packet.

471
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:56,717
Busted. You didn't even
buy the man a coffee?

472
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:58,243
- Hey, Cheetahs.
- Hey.

473
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,798
Can you guys come by
the newspaper office for an interview?

474
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,676
The Jackal story is front page.

475
00:30:02,804 --> 00:30:05,682
Oh, sure, we are always down
for a photo op.

476
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,843
My man handed Marsalis a sugar packet.
We ain't gonna get no ink?

477
00:30:11,124 --> 00:30:13,433
- Bye.
- He is just so fine.

478
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:14,997
- Are you crazy?
- Huh?

479
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:17,877
You know what? If he can't respect
my art, he can't have my heart.

480
00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:19,437
- Whatever.
- Lurk, Momma.

481
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:21,873
We got front page on the magazine.

482
00:30:24,204 --> 00:30:26,764
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold that down.
- Yeah, Cheetah.

483
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:28,476
- Hey!
- What?

484
00:30:28,604 --> 00:30:31,118
Now that we're stars,
we need to start acting like it.

485
00:30:31,244 --> 00:30:33,394
And how's that?

486
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:36,118
Well, stars don't talk
with their mouth full.

487
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:39,475
And they don't carry bottles of
Hot Papa Sauce in their purses.

488
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,038
Read the label.
Stars that know good food do.

489
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:45,474
I love New York, but y'all don't know
nothin' about spicin' up no food.

490
00:30:45,604 --> 00:30:49,802
I have to take a little bit of Southern
with me everywhere I go.

491
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:52,597
Well, Aqua, I have a problem
with your table manners.

492
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:56,558
You better stash the sauce
next time we see Jackal.

493
00:30:56,684 --> 00:31:00,074
She took my... she...
But she took my hot sauce.

494
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:03,958
You guys, she's right.
Looks do count.

495
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:07,156
- I got something on my face? Where?
- Oh, shoot. A little.

496
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:17,161
"Closed on Saturday"?

497
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:20,435
We rented the space to the Gold Medal
Crew video people for their auditions.

498
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:25,558
But I need credit for those hours.
How am I supposed to pay for my lessons?

499
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:28,039
Help me run the auditions.
I'll credit you for two weeks of lessons.

500
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:29,802
- Really?
- Yeah.

501
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:30,561
Great.

502
00:31:30,684 --> 00:31:32,675
Hands up if you know
that you're a star

503
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:35,398
You better stand up
if you know just who you are

504
00:31:35,524 --> 00:31:38,277
Never give up. Never come too far

505
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:41,123
Girl power. Girl power

506
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:43,200
How do you like that, Toto?

507
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:47,558
I like it, too.

508
00:31:47,684 --> 00:31:49,561
It's going to be our demo.

509
00:31:49,684 --> 00:31:52,960
I'm ready for Jackal.
Hope everybody else is.

510
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:55,359
Hello, Def Duck Records.
May I help you?

511
00:31:57,004 --> 00:32:00,838
- Yo, what time is it?
- A quarter past time to be on time.

512
00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:02,920
Where is she?

513
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:10,274
You know, if Dorinda is sitting there in
the same clothes she wears every day,

514
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:12,634
I think I'm gonna scream.

515
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:17,560
Do you want to walk?

516
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,755
Always wear comfortable shoes and put
the heels in a bag. Slip 'em on before.

517
00:32:22,884 --> 00:32:25,682
- I've always told you that.
- Right, Mom, right.

518
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:28,398
There they are. My Cheetah Girls.

519
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:30,640
Hi.

520
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:34,279
Galleria's running
a little late, Mr Johnson.

521
00:32:34,404 --> 00:32:40,115
Number one - Mr Johnson's
my father. Call me Jackal.

522
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:44,362
If this Jackal guy wants just one penny of
you guys' money, he's not the real thing.

523
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:45,439
Mom, we...

524
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,476
I know these impresario types.
The head of my modelling agency was...

525
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:51,402
We are just lucky to be in
the same room with Jackal, Mom.

526
00:32:51,524 --> 00:32:54,561
Please don't mama to death. Please.

527
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:58,521
Sweetheart...

528
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,363
Let me give you
one more piece of advice.

529
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:04,442
Make the meeting.
Soak your feet later.

530
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:09,679
Mom, wait up.

531
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:13,433
Girls, what do you say we
take a tour of your new home,

532
00:33:13,564 --> 00:33:15,873
while we wait for the other divette
to make her entrance?

533
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:21,201
Mom! Could you please slow down?
I don't want to have sweat.

534
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:24,919
- That's a bad first impression for Jackal.
- It's business, darling.

535
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,797
I know it's business, Mom. Could you
please slow down? I don't want...

536
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:29,357
Excuse me, sir.

537
00:33:29,484 --> 00:33:32,044
Please, Mom, please?

538
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:34,234
I am all about the South.

539
00:33:34,364 --> 00:33:36,320
Spend every summer on my
grandfather's place in Dallas.

540
00:33:36,444 --> 00:33:40,039
- Ooh, there he is.
- Don't mess with Texas.

541
00:33:41,204 --> 00:33:43,764
Jackal Johnson,
I am so sorry that I'm late.

542
00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:47,274
- You should've seen the traffic.
- Yes.

543
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:49,440
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- I'm sure this can wait.

544
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:51,794
This is Jackal Johnson.
I'm sure he's a very busy man.

545
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:54,074
I just hope I haven't missed anything.

546
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:56,843
Nope. Smells like you
brought it with you.

547
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:04,040
That's a good one.

548
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:09,956
Baby.

549
00:34:13,244 --> 00:34:16,202
- It's OK now, Bubbles.
- It's not OK, Chuchie.

550
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:19,202
This is the most spectacular meeting
of our entire career,

551
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,316
and I walk in this room, and I make
fudgey feet all over the floor?

552
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:25,163
He's never gonna work with us now.

553
00:34:25,284 --> 00:34:27,479
Galleria, Cheetah Girls
are four people.

554
00:34:27,604 --> 00:34:31,756
I know, I know. But I got to pull it
together. Enough of this puff'n'stuff.

555
00:34:31,884 --> 00:34:36,241
It's showtime, baby. When it boils down,
that's what being a leader is all about.

556
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:38,832
Thanks for having my back, Chuchie.
You're the one.

557
00:34:47,844 --> 00:34:50,916
Hey, come on over here,
my little poop tracker.

558
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:54,153
You all good again?

559
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:56,479
Yeah, I'm fine.

560
00:34:56,604 --> 00:35:00,119
So I guess now we need to
get down to business.

561
00:35:00,244 --> 00:35:02,838
"Business"?
Well, the deal's done.

562
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:07,913
Aqua here pulled out a bottle of
Hot Papa Hot Sauce, and I was sold.

563
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:12,836
Well, really?
Aqua, what can I say?

564
00:35:12,964 --> 00:35:14,716
Nothing.

565
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:18,393
Well, I brought a CD of our song,

566
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:21,755
and I just want you to listen to it.
My dog Toto says it's a hit.

567
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:25,800
Really? Oh, that's nice.

568
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:30,998
And I've got some contracts here for
the mama Cheetah. Standard agreement.

569
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:43,802
Standard revisions. And then when
I get my lawyer in on this...

570
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:45,562
Mom. Mom. Mom...

571
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:48,960
Well... what? Sorry.

572
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:52,076
Okey-dokey. Well, here's my checklist.

573
00:35:52,204 --> 00:35:55,037
Number one - record a bumping demo.

574
00:35:55,164 --> 00:35:57,962
Number two - have the record people
fall in love with it.

575
00:35:58,084 --> 00:36:00,234
And three - make millions.

576
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:07,034
- So, who's down with that?
- Oh, yeah.

577
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,917
And how long will it take
to make this bumping demo?

578
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:12,114
We don't wanna pull
the girls out of school, right?

579
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:14,075
- You're right.
- So, uh... Schedule.

580
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:16,434
Schedule.

581
00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:19,362
Let me see.
OK, here's what I'm thinking.

582
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:22,362
Learn the song Tuesday. Run it
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday night.

583
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:27,194
Rest up, come back in on Saturday,
lay down some tracks.

584
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:30,316
Less than a week?
These girls need more than one week...

585
00:36:30,444 --> 00:36:33,083
- Mama, no, we don't.
- And then they have to...

586
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:35,877
- They have to tweak it...
- Mom, no.

587
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:40,282
Well, you've got to grab each voice, and
then digitise it in real time. It's a lot to do.

588
00:36:40,404 --> 00:36:43,237
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Down, down, Mama Cheetah.

589
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:47,277
This is just one teensy-weensy little
demo. It's not a soundtrack album.

590
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:52,194
All I need is one clean take, and then
the bells and whistles happen right here.

591
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:55,282
So... Saturday?

592
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:59,682
- Oh! Our school talent show.
- Don't even worry about that.

593
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:02,921
- We'll be here.
- That's what I like to hear.

594
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:06,998
Fresh! Bam!
Off the Cheetah-meter.

595
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,843
Yeah, and now the talent show's
down the drain.

596
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:12,194
Hey, don't worry about it.
Drinka will understand.

597
00:37:12,324 --> 00:37:16,112
I hope you all know you're not singing
a note until my lawyer looks over this.

598
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:18,200
Mom, things were different
back in your day, OK?

599
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:21,077
If Jackal says we're ready,
then we must be ready.

600
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:23,843
My day, your day -
a snake is still a snake.

601
00:37:25,804 --> 00:37:27,524
Where she gettin' them glasses from?

602
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:28,957
Where she gettin' them glasses from?

603
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:32,234
This week has been crazy, Julia.

604
00:37:32,364 --> 00:37:35,834
But I promise you will get your time
with the Cheetah Girls.

605
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:40,594
We trust you'll get our story right, but I will
need photo sign-off. You understand.

606
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:46,473
And I promise you will be short-listed
as soon as the movie deal comes along.

607
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:48,560
- "Movie"?
- And it will.

608
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,640
I'll sign this for you later.

609
00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:58,198
That's what he said. Jackal is...

610
00:37:58,324 --> 00:37:59,677
- Would you sign this?
- Yeah.

611
00:38:02,684 --> 00:38:08,600
He just cracked me up. I know. Jackal
does that all the time. It's so annoying.

612
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:12,323
And the caller ID beeped, and guess...
Where you going? Sit back down.

613
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:13,763
Sit back down. Sit back down.

614
00:38:13,884 --> 00:38:17,763
And the caller ID beeped, and guess
who it was? It was Jackal! It was Jackal!

615
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:23,599
Wait. Come back.
I was telling you... Is it over?

616
00:38:25,524 --> 00:38:27,799
- Yo, what's the story?
- It's not our story.

617
00:38:27,924 --> 00:38:30,996
It's Galleria's. And it's written
all over the walls.

618
00:38:35,204 --> 00:38:37,957
"Sick of Cheetah?
Click on ChompCheetah. Com"?

619
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:40,757
We have a bashing site?

620
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:43,478
Yo, it's really kind of funny
how people are so jealous.

621
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:48,200
Jealous? You don't even get it.
Galleria's over the top.

622
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:53,034
Look, I know she's tough, but she believes
in what we're doing, and you gotta...

623
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,952
Yeah, save it for your book, Chanel.
We live here, and we go to school here.

624
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,281
She's making it really hard
to wear Cheetah spots.

625
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,760
Look, all I'm saying is
someone needs to talk to her.

626
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:07,479
And when I say "somebody"
I mean you.

627
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:11,914
I will.
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to her.

628
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:18,720
When the time is right,
I'll talk to her.

629
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:27,234
...and then I was like "Dude, relax."
And he's all...

630
00:39:28,644 --> 00:39:31,522
And I fed him some worms, is all.
We don't really hang out much any more.

631
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:34,522
Anyway, uh, and before I go,
I just want to say my mother...

632
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:38,796
Rick, you only get three minutes.
Always leave them laughing.

633
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:41,954
All right, girls,
let's get this rehearsal started.

634
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:46,760
Actually, Drinka, I would like to
rehearse our new song first.

635
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:51,594
No. Honey, you got to boogie-oogie-oogie
through the number for your talent show.

636
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:55,160
Oh. Drinka, you know we met
with Jackal on Monday, right?

637
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:57,559
Mm-hm.
I heard it through the grapevine.

638
00:39:57,684 --> 00:40:02,553
Well, he wants us to record
our new song on Saturday.

639
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:07,121
You're not doing the talent show?

640
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:09,439
Well, you know, I'm gonna
try my best to be there.

641
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:13,239
But, hey, you know how
these things go, Drinka.

642
00:40:13,364 --> 00:40:16,117
No, I don't know. Why don't you
tell me how they go?

643
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:19,919
Wait a second. Drinka, I thought
you would be happy for us.

644
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:22,433
I mean, you're the one who
hooked us up in the first place.

645
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:25,032
Jackal is just here, you know,
to get our stuff out.

646
00:40:26,364 --> 00:40:29,959
It's kind of like we already won
the talent show, isn't it? Right?

647
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:36,032
No. Not really.
But you don't know that.

648
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:38,473
Opportunity's knocking, Drinka.

649
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:43,200
And I think you know better than I that
once it's gone, you just can't get it back.

650
00:40:48,324 --> 00:40:51,077
Right, right.

651
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:53,274
You know what?

652
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:56,714
All I have is this school,

653
00:40:56,844 --> 00:41:00,803
you kids, and my word.

654
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:03,996
And, sweetie,
I always keep my word.

655
00:41:06,124 --> 00:41:08,354
Come on, boys, you're up.

656
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:17,195
Yo, Galleria, that was really harsh.

657
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:18,916
Fine. Then you call Jackal.

658
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:22,161
"Jackal, we can't do the tour
because we've got a talent show."

659
00:41:22,284 --> 00:41:25,594
Well, are we going to do it or not?
Because I've got somewhere to be.

660
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:28,477
Then go on, Dorinda.
We're gonna be doing music anyway,

661
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:31,402
so, since you mostly dance...

662
00:41:34,884 --> 00:41:39,833
You know what? You're right.
That is what I mostly do.

663
00:41:40,884 --> 00:41:43,398
Ugh. Whatever.

664
00:41:43,524 --> 00:41:48,439
Oh, girl, wait. I got you something.
Wait a second, Dorinda. Look at this.

665
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:51,078
I got you these cute
little clippings of outfits,

666
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:53,115
which you could probably put together

667
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,883
and hook it up for the next time
we see Jackal.

668
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:00,952
Hey, Do.

669
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:03,882
Take it. Because it's not optional.

670
00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:09,194
And, uh...

671
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:13,681
where exactly are you gonna go get your
personality makeover? Because I forgot...

672
00:42:13,804 --> 00:42:19,322
Hold it down with the whack attack, Do.
We love you. OK?

673
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:23,517
We just don't want you to look torn up
and chanky next time you see Jackal.

674
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:26,033
- Torn up?
- Yeah.

675
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:30,123
How about this for torn up?

676
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:38,034
Whoa. Some people just don't know
how they're coming off to others.

677
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,280
She'll thank me in the long run.

678
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:41,996
Yeah.

679
00:42:46,044 --> 00:42:48,035
Miss Chanel?

680
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:51,201
The time is now.

681
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:56,274
All right, let's take it from the top.
Remember, it's supposed to be fun.

682
00:42:56,404 --> 00:42:59,555
Like a day at the park. So let me see
lots of smiles, lots of energy.

683
00:42:59,684 --> 00:43:02,073
All right. Let me get the first group.
Come on, here we go.

684
00:43:02,284 --> 00:43:05,196
- All right, pick it up.
- Don't lose your spot.

685
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:08,843
That's good.

686
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,795
Come on.

687
00:43:12,484 --> 00:43:14,679
Don't get lost.
Keep up with it.

688
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:15,998
- Ha!
- Ooh, yes.

689
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:19,799
That's what I'm talking about. Keep it
clean, keep it short. Have some fun.

690
00:43:19,924 --> 00:43:23,553
- Hit it.
- That's nice. Harder. Hit it. Hit it.

691
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:29,722
All right. Yeah, there we go.
Watch her. She's got it.

692
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:35,513
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, jump. Get up.

693
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:37,839
Yeah, OK. Next group, come on.

694
00:43:41,004 --> 00:43:42,835
Watch that elbow.

695
00:43:44,764 --> 00:43:46,675
Pick it up. Come on, you guys.
Come on.

696
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:49,443
- What's the name of that dancer?
- That's Dorinda. Yeah.

697
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:52,124
She's pretty good.
I like what I'm seeing. OK.

698
00:43:52,244 --> 00:43:54,599
Pick it up. All right.

699
00:43:57,324 --> 00:44:00,521
That's good. Let's stop a minute.
Cut the music. All right. Everyone stop.

700
00:44:00,644 --> 00:44:02,316
Very nice.
That's good enough for today.

701
00:44:02,444 --> 00:44:05,880
Guys, just hang out for a second.
I'm going to let you go shortly.

702
00:44:07,844 --> 00:44:11,678
All right, all right. Give me a minute,
I gotta talk to someone.

703
00:44:11,804 --> 00:44:15,353
Hey, Dorinda. Hey, you were
working hard out there, you know?

704
00:44:15,484 --> 00:44:19,159
- Good job, good job. You look great.
- I'm glad I could help.

705
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:22,481
Listen. There are a few parts
in this show you'd be perfect for.

706
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:24,674
Think about coming on tour
with us this summer.

707
00:44:24,804 --> 00:44:29,161
- Me, on tour with the Gold Medal Crew?
- That's right. Ten weeks.

708
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:32,321
There are other kids in this show and
it's like summer camp, but you get paid.

709
00:44:32,444 --> 00:44:33,957
Wait. You get paid?

710
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:38,635
Girl, you dance like a pro, you get paid like
a pro. Have your parents take a look at this.

711
00:44:38,764 --> 00:44:43,235
- If they say yes, return it to me.
- My parents? OK, all right.

712
00:44:43,364 --> 00:44:44,797
- Good.
- I'll get back to you.

713
00:44:44,924 --> 00:44:46,721
The following people,
thank you very much.

714
00:44:46,844 --> 00:44:49,802
- We're going to come back to this, OK?
- Oh, man.

715
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:51,516
Ma?

716
00:44:51,684 --> 00:44:52,912
Ma?

717
00:44:53,044 --> 00:44:55,353
I'm feeling shoe shoppy.

718
00:44:58,324 --> 00:45:01,282
I knew it was too good to be true.

719
00:45:02,964 --> 00:45:08,084
"Luc surprised me with tickets to a
Broadway show, so I couldn't say no."

720
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:11,241
"You take my card
and have a good time."

721
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:15,437
"Get something we both can wear
and look tight. Love, Mommy."

722
00:45:18,404 --> 00:45:21,476
"We need to spend more time together."

723
00:45:21,604 --> 00:45:22,923
Yeah, right.

724
00:45:23,044 --> 00:45:25,956
Nobody's home.
Nobody's ever home.

725
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,960
Hey, we're not here. Leave your name
and number after the beep.

726
00:45:31,084 --> 00:45:33,359
Nita, Gail from Moving On Realtors.

727
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:36,044
If you still want to put your
apartment up for sale, give a shout.

728
00:45:36,164 --> 00:45:38,041
We'll do an open house.

729
00:45:38,164 --> 00:45:42,954
Here's a shout. You can send
that one right back, special delivery.

730
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:45,996
No one's moving out.

731
00:45:48,764 --> 00:45:51,801
Oh, yeah. I'll have a good time.

732
00:46:29,764 --> 00:46:32,881
- Hi. The Thomases, please.
- There's no Thomases here.

733
00:46:33,884 --> 00:46:35,875
Really?

734
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:38,916
Dorinda Thomas. About this tall,
always has, like, a dance bag with her?

735
00:46:39,044 --> 00:46:43,640
Oh, her. Take the alley around.
Superintendent's apartment.

736
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:47,832
"Alley"?

737
00:47:13,324 --> 00:47:15,713
Hello?

738
00:47:16,444 --> 00:47:19,004
- I told y'all to stop running in the house.
- Come here.

739
00:47:19,124 --> 00:47:21,843
I'm looking for Dorinda Thomas,
but I must have the wrong...

740
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,683
No, no. She's here. Dorinda?

741
00:47:25,644 --> 00:47:27,521
You got a visitor, honey.

742
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:30,795
- Hey, Chanel.
- Hey.

743
00:47:31,644 --> 00:47:34,681
Mom, this is my friend Chanel. Remember,
I told you about the Cheetah Girls?

744
00:47:34,804 --> 00:47:36,396
Oh, yeah. Hi, honey.

745
00:47:36,524 --> 00:47:38,242
Hi.

746
00:47:39,764 --> 00:47:44,360
What did y'all break this time?
Nice to meet you, honey.

747
00:47:44,484 --> 00:47:47,157
Dorinda, let's go see
somebody get in trouble.

748
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:50,321
You go ahead.
I'll be right there, OK?

749
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:58,561
If I knew you were coming, I'd have been
really rich and lived somewhere else.

750
00:47:58,684 --> 00:47:59,719
What?

751
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:04,964
Now you know why I never invite
you guys over or talk about my family.

752
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:08,759
I'm really surprised at you, Dorinda.
Why'd you try to hide it?

753
00:48:08,884 --> 00:48:13,162
You guys are all... I don't know.
I guess I just didn't think about it.

754
00:48:13,284 --> 00:48:16,082
Wait till I tell Galleria.
I mean, the way you dance,

755
00:48:16,204 --> 00:48:19,480
you had to have some flavour in you
somewhere. But she was all "No"...

756
00:48:19,604 --> 00:48:21,913
We're not talking about
the same thing, Chanel.

757
00:48:22,044 --> 00:48:25,559
So you're half Black.
You've seen Galleria's mom and dad.

758
00:48:25,684 --> 00:48:27,993
And I'm a little bit
of every kind of Spanish pepper, girl.

759
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:30,513
Shoot, Miss America
has ten bloodlines.

760
00:48:30,644 --> 00:48:32,635
No. No!

761
00:48:32,764 --> 00:48:36,154
Yo, we're all mixed up in this jiggy jungle
together. Join the club, girlie.

762
00:48:36,284 --> 00:48:38,593
Can you just wait for a second?

763
00:48:38,724 --> 00:48:40,715
I'm not Black, and I'm not half Black.

764
00:48:40,844 --> 00:48:43,312
I'm not even White.
I don't even know what I am.

765
00:48:43,444 --> 00:48:46,880
I do know that Mrs Bosco isn't my mom.

766
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:49,802
She's the closest thing I've ever had.

767
00:48:51,364 --> 00:48:55,562
My mom, my real mom,
she didn't want me.

768
00:48:55,684 --> 00:49:00,155
And I'm a foster child,
and I live here with ten other kids.

769
00:49:01,884 --> 00:49:06,275
The only reason why we even get to live
here is because Mr Bosco's the super.

770
00:49:07,124 --> 00:49:11,197
But I want to stay here,
and I want to stay here with my friends,

771
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,963
and in school,
and with the Cheetah Girls,

772
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,963
because it's the best I've ever had,
Chanel. And please don't...

773
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:20,757
Don't take it from me.

774
00:49:21,764 --> 00:49:25,916
Girl, you thought we'd pull your card
for lack of parents?

775
00:49:27,084 --> 00:49:29,757
Girl, sometimes that
can be a good thing.

776
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:33,672
Trust me, it's not all
it's cracked up to be.

777
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,876
You should be grateful
that you have a mom.

778
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:43,762
Do, you're a Cheetah Girl because of
who you are, and what's in your heart.

779
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:47,039
And you're pure Cheetah Girl.

780
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:54,595
Look at us.

781
00:49:58,364 --> 00:50:01,162
- You didn't come here to hear my secret.
- Nah.

782
00:50:01,284 --> 00:50:03,559
So why are you here?

783
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:08,396
I felt really bad about
what happened with Galleria.

784
00:50:08,524 --> 00:50:13,279
She gets all testy and touchy cos
she wants everything to be perfect.

785
00:50:13,404 --> 00:50:15,554
I just wanted to make sure you were OK.

786
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,995
- Do, come and eat.
- I'll be there in a second.

787
00:50:22,364 --> 00:50:24,673
I'm all right. I just...

788
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:27,876
I can't look the way she wants me to.

789
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:31,121
I don't have money to buy a new outfit.

790
00:50:31,244 --> 00:50:34,361
Or you could wear this.

791
00:50:34,484 --> 00:50:37,999
I saw it and I thought one of us
had to have it. Check it out.

792
00:50:41,444 --> 00:50:42,877
Wow.

793
00:50:43,004 --> 00:50:44,995
Growl power.

794
00:50:45,124 --> 00:50:47,194
It's hot.

795
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:50,600
Just think of it as a loan
from the Juanita-Chanel collection.

796
00:50:51,204 --> 00:50:53,354
Thanks, girl.

797
00:50:57,524 --> 00:51:00,675
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

798
00:51:00,804 --> 00:51:02,681
- What's wrong? You OK?
- Yeah.

799
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:06,353
I'm great, actually. I mean...

800
00:51:06,484 --> 00:51:10,079
I got an offer from the Gold Medal Crew.
They want me to dance for them.

801
00:51:10,204 --> 00:51:13,833
- They wanna hire me, Chanel.
- Oh, my God. Get out, girl.

802
00:51:13,964 --> 00:51:16,683
I know. But...

803
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:24,876
- What about the Cheetah Girls?
- I don't know.

804
00:51:25,484 --> 00:51:27,918
Chanel, I really need that money.

805
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:30,319
I just... I don't know what to do.

806
00:51:34,164 --> 00:51:36,758
- Come on, now, stay still.
- Hey. Ow.

807
00:51:36,884 --> 00:51:38,795
Sorry. OK, wait. One more.

808
00:51:38,924 --> 00:51:41,757
- OK. Sorry about that.
- Not so much arch, girl.

809
00:51:41,884 --> 00:51:46,400
I don't want to look like "The Mary J Blige
concert tickets are sold out?"

810
00:51:46,524 --> 00:51:49,436
I know, right? Wait, watch out.
Let me do this one.

811
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:53,876
From furry to fierce. Girl, they are
cheetahlicious. Aren't they, Toto?

812
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:57,160
Come in. Hey, Mom.

813
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:59,002
Galleria's Day Spa.

814
00:52:00,124 --> 00:52:03,002
Now, listen, I do not want you all
to stay up all night gabbing.

815
00:52:03,124 --> 00:52:04,842
- OK.
- And, uh...

816
00:52:04,964 --> 00:52:09,242
I made a decision that you all
can go to this rehearsal alone.

817
00:52:10,084 --> 00:52:12,439
Oh, Mom. Thank you so much.

818
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:14,714
I just want to see how
you handle yourselves.

819
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:16,436
- OK.
- I'm trusting you.

820
00:52:16,564 --> 00:52:19,442
- Thanks, Madrina.
- You're welcome.

821
00:52:19,564 --> 00:52:23,352
Toto? Get to bed,
and be an example for these girls.

822
00:52:23,484 --> 00:52:25,122
Good night. Go to sleep.

823
00:52:25,244 --> 00:52:26,962
- OK, OK, OK.
- All right. Love you.

824
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:28,563
- Love ya.
- Love you, too.

825
00:52:28,684 --> 00:52:31,244
- Chanel, I wanted to show you something.
- What?

826
00:52:32,604 --> 00:52:36,563
What do you think about this?

827
00:52:41,044 --> 00:52:43,763
- Don't you think there's something wrong?
- What?

828
00:52:43,884 --> 00:52:49,800
Why is there one person in the middle,
and why is that one person you?

829
00:52:49,924 --> 00:52:52,836
OK, yeah. My picture is bigger
than everybody else's.

830
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:55,478
- But hey, I did write the songs.
- Hold up.

831
00:52:55,604 --> 00:52:59,483
Those were my ideas too, and Aqua
freestyled a lot of the hooks you used.

832
00:52:59,604 --> 00:53:01,720
Those were our songs.

833
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:05,837
Chanel, I take bits and pieces and put
them together, OK? I'm an artist.

834
00:53:05,964 --> 00:53:08,922
And while you're being an artist
and taking your bows, what am I?

835
00:53:09,044 --> 00:53:12,116
- Your sidekick? Your flunky?
- Hey, calm down, Chanel. OK?

836
00:53:12,244 --> 00:53:14,519
Can we just stay focused
on the dream, please?

837
00:53:14,644 --> 00:53:16,635
Bubbles, stop trying to
handle me, all right?

838
00:53:16,764 --> 00:53:20,393
I wasn't born to be wiping your shoes,
to go along with your okey-doke, OK?

839
00:53:20,524 --> 00:53:23,596
I'm not the only one feeling it.
Aqua and Do are feeling it, too.

840
00:53:23,724 --> 00:53:27,319
What? The Cheetah Girls are opening
the box behind my back?

841
00:53:27,444 --> 00:53:30,675
No. You just don't see it when
it's all up in your face, girl.

842
00:53:30,804 --> 00:53:35,355
Look, Bubbles, you're not
that much fun to be around any more.

843
00:53:37,244 --> 00:53:40,520
I know. OK? But I promise, girl.

844
00:53:40,644 --> 00:53:45,081
Everybody will be so happy once we
get this deal tomorrow. Trust me.

845
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:50,555
Yo, Bubbles, I found out why
Do keeps her life on the DL.

846
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:54,996
She's a foster child. Her mom gave her
away when she was just a baby.

847
00:53:55,124 --> 00:53:58,639
- What?
- Yeah.

848
00:53:58,764 --> 00:54:02,074
This is no dream, all right?
This is the real deal for her.

849
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:04,275
I guess she needs this
more than anybody, huh?

850
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:08,761
No, Bubbles. What she needs is friends.
We all do.

851
00:54:11,764 --> 00:54:16,838
Chuchie, friends help friends
make their dream come true, right?

852
00:54:16,964 --> 00:54:21,196
- I guess.
- Then don't worry about it, girl. OK?

853
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:25,715
I'm sure Jackal will have some ideas
about the cover tomorrow. So don't trip.

854
00:54:33,844 --> 00:54:35,800
Cheetah Girls.

855
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:43,080
I have some ideas, and so does
my marketing team. Give a listen.

856
00:54:43,204 --> 00:54:47,755
Our research shows your demographic
responds to the animal theme

857
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:51,763
and your bouncy, up-tempo,
pop-urban sensibility.

858
00:54:51,884 --> 00:54:55,354
Kids love endangered species.
Kids wanna party.

859
00:54:55,484 --> 00:55:00,717
Kids want a band like Global Getdown.

860
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:03,802
The letter "G" is big this year.

861
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:07,963
Galleria stays a cheetah
now and forever.

862
00:55:09,324 --> 00:55:15,320
Dorinda is a sweet panda.
Come on, take it.

863
00:55:15,444 --> 00:55:22,043
Here we have a baby seal for...

864
00:55:22,164 --> 00:55:24,758
Aqua, of course.

865
00:55:24,884 --> 00:55:30,083
And Chanel is a snow leopard
from the frigid north.

866
00:55:31,604 --> 00:55:34,641
- Brr. Ha ha.
- Masks?

867
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:38,803
Our engineering department
wants to create whole new identities.

868
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:42,721
So you guys want us to be, like,
something other than the Cheetah Girls?

869
00:55:42,844 --> 00:55:47,076
Global Getdown
is a worldwide marketing miracle.

870
00:55:47,204 --> 00:55:50,833
I'm seeing dolls, movie tie-ins
with every kind of burger, taco,

871
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:53,398
and anything you can eat
with chopsticks.

872
00:55:53,524 --> 00:55:57,802
Well, how does it look?

873
00:55:57,924 --> 00:55:59,755
- Oh, precious.
- Sweet.

874
00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:04,480
Dorinda, take that thing off.
Jackal, um...

875
00:56:04,604 --> 00:56:07,801
We can't sing in these things.

876
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:11,599
Well, you'll be miked inside.
And the music's on tape, anyway.

877
00:56:11,724 --> 00:56:16,479
- Oh, I'm sorry. We don't lip sync.
- Don't worry.

878
00:56:16,604 --> 00:56:20,882
We'll teach you. Now, let's talk music.

879
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:24,280
Ha, now you're talking.
Cheetahs, "Girl Power".

880
00:56:25,124 --> 00:56:27,479
- Excuse me.
- Bump this.

881
00:56:28,604 --> 00:56:30,879
Let's do this, girls.

882
00:56:32,644 --> 00:56:35,078
Chuck those masks right there, please.

883
00:56:42,404 --> 00:56:44,440
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star

884
00:56:44,564 --> 00:56:47,362
You'd better stand up
if you know just who you are

885
00:56:47,484 --> 00:56:50,078
Never give up. Never say die

886
00:56:50,204 --> 00:56:52,718
Girl power. Girl power

887
00:56:52,844 --> 00:56:54,835
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star

888
00:56:54,964 --> 00:56:57,524
You better stand up
if you know just who you are

889
00:56:57,644 --> 00:57:00,283
Never give up. Never come too far

890
00:57:00,404 --> 00:57:03,202
Girl power. Girl power

891
00:57:03,324 --> 00:57:06,396
I made mistakes before

892
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:09,641
But I know I'm not perfect

893
00:57:09,764 --> 00:57:14,280
It's OK cos who could ever be?

894
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:16,872
As long as I give my best

895
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:19,199
It won't matter what no one says

896
00:57:19,324 --> 00:57:23,237
Cos down in my heart I got
the power to make it all happen. Yeah

897
00:57:23,364 --> 00:57:26,436
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star...

898
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:28,236
All the same thing

899
00:57:28,364 --> 00:57:30,878
Never give up. Never say die

900
00:57:31,004 --> 00:57:33,882
Girl power. Girl power

901
00:57:34,004 --> 00:57:37,519
At times I may just feel like

902
00:57:37,644 --> 00:57:39,635
My back is to the wall

903
00:57:39,764 --> 00:57:41,959
I hold my head up high

904
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:45,076
And keep standing tall

905
00:57:45,204 --> 00:57:47,843
I know that my back is covered

906
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,398
Because we have each other

907
00:57:50,524 --> 00:57:53,721
And we're down for whatever
if you hear me

908
00:57:53,844 --> 00:57:56,199
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star

909
00:57:56,324 --> 00:57:58,679
You'd better stand up
if you know just who you are

910
00:57:58,804 --> 00:58:01,716
Never give up. Never say die

911
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:04,074
Girl power. Girl power

912
00:58:04,204 --> 00:58:08,117
Sometimes life may get you down

913
00:58:08,244 --> 00:58:10,997
But you better hold your ground

914
00:58:11,124 --> 00:58:15,515
Can't nobody live your life but you

915
00:58:15,684 --> 00:58:18,357
Stay true to who you are

916
00:58:18,484 --> 00:58:20,998
And always follow your heart

917
00:58:21,124 --> 00:58:25,515
Your heart. Your heart

918
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:29,358
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star

919
00:58:29,484 --> 00:58:32,078
You better stand up
if you know just who you are

920
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:34,559
Never give up. Never come too far

921
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:37,881
Girl power. Girl power

922
00:58:42,204 --> 00:58:44,718
Excellent. Excellent.

923
00:58:44,844 --> 00:58:48,917
I loved it. That's exactly the flavour
we're looking for.

924
00:58:50,884 --> 00:58:54,479
Now, here's the song we're looking at.

925
00:58:55,084 --> 00:58:57,279
Hit it.

926
00:58:57,404 --> 00:59:00,999
We go all around the world
Where we stop. Nobody knows...

927
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:03,763
All right. Check this out.

928
00:59:03,884 --> 00:59:07,957
Def Duck Records presents
Global Getdown - "All Around the World".

929
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:10,040
This is going to go platinum,
titanium, uranium.

930
00:59:10,164 --> 00:59:13,076
It is animal-friendly, vegetable-friendly,
mineral-friendly.

931
00:59:13,204 --> 00:59:15,240
This is brilliant. I can smell millions.

932
00:59:15,364 --> 00:59:18,959
Oh, yeah. That's it. Ow.
Feel it. Feel it. Come on.

933
00:59:19,084 --> 00:59:22,394
- We go all around the world...
- Oh, yeah. Sing it.

934
00:59:22,524 --> 00:59:25,755
Where we stop. Nobody knows
Cos we don't care just where we go

935
00:59:25,884 --> 00:59:27,158
Pump it.

936
00:59:27,284 --> 00:59:30,754
All around the world
We go all around the world

937
00:59:30,884 --> 00:59:34,081
Where we stop. Nobody knows
but I can't wait to go home

938
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:35,114
Sing it with me.

939
00:59:35,244 --> 00:59:38,475
All around the world
We go all around the world

940
00:59:38,604 --> 00:59:42,802
Where we stop. Nobody knows
We don't care where we go

941
00:59:42,924 --> 00:59:46,633
All around the world
We go all around the world...

942
00:59:50,444 --> 00:59:52,912
No! No! No! No!

943
00:59:53,044 --> 00:59:57,799
- Didn't you like what we just did?
- I loved it. It was great.

944
00:59:57,924 --> 01:00:00,996
But that's not what we sold
the record company.

945
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:04,514
Well, I'm sorry. We can't change
the Cheetah Girls.

946
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:08,239
Well, this is what they're interested in.

947
01:00:08,364 --> 01:00:10,559
And this is what they're paying for.

948
01:00:11,444 --> 01:00:13,912
Well, fine. Then we bounce.

949
01:00:22,124 --> 01:00:25,275
- Could you excuse us for a second?
- Sure. Absolutely.

950
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:28,836
Let's, uh...

951
01:00:28,964 --> 01:00:33,674
Let's give these girls a chance
to think about that world tour. Hm?

952
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:35,681
All right.

953
01:00:41,044 --> 01:00:44,719
- Why didn't you guys back me up?
- You mean rubber-stamp you.

954
01:00:44,844 --> 01:00:47,278
Galleria, you didn't even give us
a chance to think.

955
01:00:47,404 --> 01:00:49,440
Think about what, Do?
They're puppets.

956
01:00:49,564 --> 01:00:51,998
I mean, now at least we could be
down for the talent show.

957
01:00:52,124 --> 01:00:54,558
And if we win,
we can still have our demo.

958
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:58,563
Don't front, Bubbles. Now you're all
gung ho for the talent show?

959
01:00:58,684 --> 01:01:01,960
Maybe we need to do it this way first,
so we can get our shot.

960
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:04,598
He knows the business.
I really think we should consider it.

961
01:01:04,724 --> 01:01:08,683
It's a job singing, dancing, and making
people happy. What's wrong with that?

962
01:01:08,804 --> 01:01:13,161
- It's not our music.
- It's not your song, so you wanna walk.

963
01:01:13,284 --> 01:01:17,118
You didn't handle this.
Now I will.

964
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,280
You're just mad because
he won't do your material, right?

965
01:01:21,404 --> 01:01:27,036
Our material, not that "All Around the
World" nonsense he was playing.

966
01:01:27,164 --> 01:01:30,440
You might be right, babe, but you can't
make decisions for the whole group.

967
01:01:30,564 --> 01:01:33,203
We make our decisions together.

968
01:01:33,324 --> 01:01:35,918
You're just one person,
and you're not the boss of everything.

969
01:01:36,044 --> 01:01:37,796
Well, somebody has to be the boss.

970
01:01:37,924 --> 01:01:40,438
Somebody has to remind you
why we started the Cheetah Girls.

971
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:42,600
To make our dreams come true.

972
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:45,284
Our way, not his.

973
01:01:45,404 --> 01:01:47,918
Why don't you guys
believe in what we have?

974
01:01:48,044 --> 01:01:50,638
I wish I could believe in you,
Galleria, I really do,

975
01:01:50,764 --> 01:01:53,597
but lately you've been all about you.

976
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:58,761
I can't...

977
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,757
We can't trust you any more.

978
01:02:11,044 --> 01:02:13,797
Oh. OK, well...

979
01:02:16,364 --> 01:02:20,073
Problem solved.
I'm taking myself out of the equation.

980
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:22,764
Oh, come on, Galleria.
Will you squash the drama?

981
01:02:22,884 --> 01:02:26,433
No. Really, Do.
This is your shot.

982
01:02:26,564 --> 01:02:32,196
And you need this, so I definitely
do not want to stand in your way.

983
01:02:32,324 --> 01:02:34,884
So you guys are on your own,

984
01:02:35,004 --> 01:02:38,076
and you take the deal.

985
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:56,719
- Did we lose a Cheetah?
- Afraid so.

986
01:02:57,524 --> 01:03:00,482
Happens all the time. Don't worry.

987
01:03:00,604 --> 01:03:02,913
There's more where she came from.

988
01:03:03,044 --> 01:03:06,559
Sure. We can always find another singer.
And then...

989
01:03:06,684 --> 01:03:10,154
move our other lead singer
to centre mike.

990
01:03:10,644 --> 01:03:15,115
How about "Chanel
and the Global Getdown"?

991
01:03:17,404 --> 01:03:19,315
What?

992
01:03:20,844 --> 01:03:24,678
Look, this is too much for one day.

993
01:03:24,804 --> 01:03:27,796
I really think we should
all think about this.

994
01:03:27,924 --> 01:03:33,476
All right. Well, come back
when you're ready for prime time.

995
01:04:11,644 --> 01:04:13,714
Mom...

996
01:04:13,844 --> 01:04:17,314
Could you please not say,
"I told you so"?

997
01:04:18,884 --> 01:04:20,761
Please.

998
01:04:30,844 --> 01:04:34,678
Hey, Dana.
Looks like I'll be going on that tour.

999
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,920
Hey, great.
They picked me too.

1000
01:04:37,044 --> 01:04:39,353
And I got forms for you to fill out.

1001
01:04:39,484 --> 01:04:41,839
You just gotta get
your foster mom to sign them.

1002
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,116
Ma, what's up?

1003
01:05:52,404 --> 01:05:54,474
What's up?

1004
01:05:56,284 --> 01:06:00,755
My credit card balance is up,
that's what's up. I got declined.

1005
01:06:00,884 --> 01:06:03,318
I bought some sandals.
I wanted to wear them out of the store.

1006
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:06,322
The woman snatched them back so fast,
she took the paint off my toes.

1007
01:06:06,444 --> 01:06:10,801
- Why would you do this, huh? Why?
- Ma, I'm sorry.

1008
01:06:13,524 --> 01:06:16,596
Look, I'll give it all back.

1009
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:21,718
I thought we were gonna be rich
after this demo. I'll work. I'll pay you back.

1010
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:25,439
I trusted you. I trusted you,
and you took advantage of me.

1011
01:06:26,724 --> 01:06:30,717
I trusted you.
I trusted you to pay attention, Ma.

1012
01:06:30,844 --> 01:06:33,517
You did this
because I broke a shopping date?

1013
01:06:33,644 --> 01:06:36,363
No, Ma. No.

1014
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:42,602
I did it cos Luc came in the picture, and
it seemed like my dreams didn't matter.

1015
01:06:42,724 --> 01:06:44,760
It seemed like they didn't matter.

1016
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:51,001
But I've seen what it's like
not to have a mom.

1017
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,436
What?

1018
01:06:57,604 --> 01:07:02,120
Calm down, calm down,
calm down. Hey.

1019
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,844
- Who doesn't have a mom?
- I'll tell you later.

1020
01:07:06,884 --> 01:07:12,197
I just wanted to thank you
for always keeping me in your dreams.

1021
01:07:13,324 --> 01:07:18,273
- Oh, baby.
- No matter where they take us.

1022
01:07:18,404 --> 01:07:24,195
Paris, Buenos Aires -
it doesn't matter any more.

1023
01:07:24,324 --> 01:07:30,081
- The Cheetah Girls are over.
- Oh, baby, no, no, no.

1024
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:37,156
I worked on all the songs.
I worked on our look.

1025
01:07:37,284 --> 01:07:41,118
I buckled everything down. I thought that
we were all on the same page.

1026
01:07:41,244 --> 01:07:43,360
I am sure you did what was right.

1027
01:07:43,484 --> 01:07:46,601
But what's right for you
may not be right for someone else.

1028
01:07:46,724 --> 01:07:48,794
And it's not worth
losing a friendship over.

1029
01:07:48,924 --> 01:07:51,677
How could we be friends again?

1030
01:07:51,804 --> 01:07:53,681
I mean, they want fame.

1031
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:57,843
And there are ways...
and then there are ways.

1032
01:07:57,964 --> 01:08:00,717
And I want fame the Cheetah Girls way.

1033
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:03,802
The Cheetah Girls way or your way?

1034
01:08:03,924 --> 01:08:08,361
We worked too hard to give it up.
I have to stand up for what's right.

1035
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:13,000
Oh, sweetheart. I tried so hard to protect
you from getting your dreams crushed.

1036
01:08:13,124 --> 01:08:17,675
But there's no way I could
save you from this heartache.

1037
01:08:17,804 --> 01:08:21,797
You see, sometimes
you just have to let go.

1038
01:08:22,684 --> 01:08:27,121
And let the people you love
make their own choices.

1039
01:08:27,244 --> 01:08:32,318
Even if you don't agree with them.
You see, I'm learning to do that with you.

1040
01:08:33,524 --> 01:08:36,357
And you've gotta learn with your friends.

1041
01:08:38,324 --> 01:08:40,474
What difference does it make?

1042
01:08:40,604 --> 01:08:43,960
You either walk with the devil,
or you don't.

1043
01:08:44,084 --> 01:08:46,917
And I said no.

1044
01:08:47,044 --> 01:08:49,080
And I was right.

1045
01:08:51,364 --> 01:08:54,720
I was... I was right, wasn't I?

1046
01:09:35,608 --> 01:09:39,078
Someone's always

1047
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:42,837
There behind

1048
01:09:42,968 --> 01:09:49,806
To catch us if we fall

1049
01:09:51,088 --> 01:09:55,366
I might be lonely

1050
01:09:56,448 --> 01:10:01,841
But I'm not...

1051
01:10:11,008 --> 01:10:15,081
No, keep going.
It wasn't entirely all that bad.

1052
01:10:15,568 --> 01:10:19,607
It actually sounded like something,
not that pop fluff you're usually working.

1053
01:10:19,728 --> 01:10:22,196
- You liked it?
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:22,328 --> 01:10:24,967
You had somebody write you
a Cheetah jam?

1055
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:28,160
No. I wrote it. And all by myself.

1056
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:33,878
See, this is the kind of music
Jackal Johnson didn't want us to record.

1057
01:10:34,008 --> 01:10:37,887
He had other ideas for us.
Like this. Listen to this.

1058
01:10:38,008 --> 01:10:41,398
We go all around the world
We go all around the world

1059
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:44,565
Where we stop nobody knows
We don't care...

1060
01:10:44,688 --> 01:10:46,644
OK.

1061
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:54,637
It was drama and kaflamma.

1062
01:10:54,768 --> 01:10:56,645
There were masks involved.

1063
01:10:58,368 --> 01:11:01,280
When he asked us to lip sync,

1064
01:11:01,408 --> 01:11:03,603
I walked.

1065
01:11:03,728 --> 01:11:05,923
So it's true, huh?

1066
01:11:06,048 --> 01:11:08,721
No more Cheetahs in the jungle?

1067
01:11:10,488 --> 01:11:14,037
The Cheetahs are extinct.

1068
01:11:14,168 --> 01:11:16,602
Oh, I should not be laughing right now.

1069
01:11:16,728 --> 01:11:19,288
Well, welcome to the world
of a true artist.

1070
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:22,764
You really do have to
walk alone sometimes.

1071
01:11:22,888 --> 01:11:26,198
But you got the talent,
and you can walk it.

1072
01:11:29,408 --> 01:11:32,718
Wait a second. You aren't just saying that
cos now you can win the talent show?

1073
01:11:32,848 --> 01:11:34,884
Yes, I am.

1074
01:11:35,688 --> 01:11:39,044
Well, not completely.

1075
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:57,757
Come on, honey.

1076
01:11:57,888 --> 01:12:02,404
So, I thought we'd spend this evening
cuddled up family-style.

1077
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:05,446
Papa will make a delicious supper.

1078
01:12:05,568 --> 01:12:08,401
Maybe we could
pop in your favourite movie.

1079
01:12:08,528 --> 01:12:12,919
"There's no place like home."
There's no place like home, booby.

1080
01:12:13,048 --> 01:12:17,087
Well, I don't even think
The Wizard of Oz can fix this, Mom.

1081
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:22,566
I was thinking Toto and I could go to the
talent show, show Drinka some support.

1082
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:25,919
- That's wonderful, honey.
- OK.

1083
01:12:26,048 --> 01:12:30,405
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks. See ya.

1084
01:12:31,528 --> 01:12:33,678
Come on.

1085
01:13:01,288 --> 01:13:03,961
They... they went ahead without me.

1086
01:13:04,928 --> 01:13:07,044
Toto, can you believe that?
The Cheetah Girls...

1087
01:13:07,168 --> 01:13:10,877
Toto! Toto, come here. Toto!

1088
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:14,124
Toto, stop!

1089
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:16,443
Toto!

1090
01:13:16,568 --> 01:13:19,924
Wait! Toto! Toto!

1091
01:13:23,008 --> 01:13:24,839
Toto...

1092
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:26,162
Toto?

1093
01:13:26,288 --> 01:13:28,643
Oh, Toto!

1094
01:13:31,368 --> 01:13:35,964
What's going on, Manhattan Magnet?
Yeah! Come on.

1095
01:13:36,088 --> 01:13:39,125
Hey, give yourself a hand. Hello.

1096
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,204
Is everybody ready
to have a good time?

1097
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:46,597
Pick up the phone.
It'll be OK.

1098
01:13:46,728 --> 01:13:48,844
Hey, Mom, Dad.

1099
01:13:48,968 --> 01:13:52,085
Dad, listen to me, please.
Toto is in a hole.

1100
01:13:52,848 --> 01:13:55,646
Oh, Mr Police Officer.
Please. My dog is in a hole.

1101
01:13:55,768 --> 01:14:00,046
- Will you please go and get him?
- Dog in a hole? That's bad.

1102
01:14:02,448 --> 01:14:04,166
- I'm gonna have to call for backup.
- OK.

1103
01:14:04,288 --> 01:14:08,247
Unit 15. I got a dog in a hole
by Manhattan Magnet.

1104
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:10,836
...who calls himself a bird person.
You know, he flips out,

1105
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:15,086
and he starts flapping his wings.
I'm like "Dude, relax." And he's all...

1106
01:14:20,528 --> 01:14:23,645
That's it. Come on. Come on.
A little to the left. Keep going.

1107
01:14:24,288 --> 01:14:27,837
To the left. To the left.
OK, OK, there he is.

1108
01:14:27,968 --> 01:14:30,243
He's got himself wedged in there good.

1109
01:14:30,368 --> 01:14:34,156
It's OK, Toto. They're coming to get you,
OK? Don't worry. Why isn't he barking?

1110
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:37,883
We got some oxygen to him.
He's gonna be OK until we figure this out.

1111
01:14:39,568 --> 01:14:42,036
- Galleria!
- Mom! Dad!

1112
01:14:42,168 --> 01:14:45,604
Excuse me, sir. Those are my parents.
Excuse me. They can come in.

1113
01:14:48,528 --> 01:14:52,237
Three, two, one.
Hal Hartman here

1114
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:54,757
in downtown,
where we're getting to the bottom

1115
01:14:54,888 --> 01:14:57,686
of the traffic jam
that's paralysing midtown.

1116
01:14:57,808 --> 01:15:01,767
Apparently
Toto is not in Kansas any more.

1117
01:15:02,528 --> 01:15:05,201
Ma, look.

1118
01:15:05,328 --> 01:15:08,126
Wait. You look like...

1119
01:15:08,248 --> 01:15:10,478
Don't tell anybody where
you get your hair done.

1120
01:15:10,608 --> 01:15:15,318
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, Sonic Chaos.

1121
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:23,607
- Hey, yo, Max?
- Yeah?

1122
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,958
- I don't think they ready for this.
- No, no.

1123
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,398
C'mon. Yo. All I want is one beat.
One song. One rhyme

1124
01:15:29,528 --> 01:15:31,803
Just one verse with one line. One time

1125
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:33,520
Cos I'm here to spread the word

1126
01:15:33,648 --> 01:15:35,798
It ain't what you see. Yo.
It's what you heard

1127
01:15:35,928 --> 01:15:37,156
- So c'mon
- C'mon

1128
01:15:37,288 --> 01:15:38,323
- C'mon
- C'mon

1129
01:15:38,448 --> 01:15:40,564
It don't matter who you are.
Just c'mon

1130
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:42,201
White. Black. Brown.
Puerto Rican or Haitian

1131
01:15:42,328 --> 01:15:44,319
It don't matter who you are.
We one hip-hop nation

1132
01:15:44,448 --> 01:15:45,961
- So c'mon
- C'mon

1133
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:46,759
- C'mon
- C'mon

1134
01:15:46,888 --> 01:15:48,924
If you're likin' what we're sayin'
then c'mon

1135
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:51,004
We can turn the party out.
Make the people scream and shout

1136
01:15:51,128 --> 01:15:52,880
And then my DJ's gonna do his thing...

1137
01:16:02,528 --> 01:16:04,246
Excuse me.

1138
01:16:04,368 --> 01:16:06,836
Mr and Mrs Garibaldi, how's Toto?

1139
01:16:06,968 --> 01:16:09,766
- How'd you know?
- Well, you're all over the news.

1140
01:16:09,888 --> 01:16:13,437
Well, how did you get down here?
I mean, the streets are totally blocked.

1141
01:16:19,328 --> 01:16:23,321
Aqua, did you take the subway for me?

1142
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:28,042
I took the subway for Toto. I'm from Texas.
We learn from the Rangers.

1143
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:32,161
We never leave a man or a dog behind.
Hang in there, baby boy.

1144
01:16:36,688 --> 01:16:39,521
- Do!
- Hey, is he OK?

1145
01:16:41,008 --> 01:16:42,999
Oh, no, he doesn't look good.

1146
01:16:44,568 --> 01:16:48,243
- Go, go, go!
- Excuse me. Coming through.

1147
01:16:48,368 --> 01:16:50,677
- We need to get through.
- Over there.

1148
01:16:50,808 --> 01:16:52,480
- Chuchie!
- Thank you.

1149
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,168
- Honey, go.
- Oh, thanks for coming.

1150
01:16:55,888 --> 01:16:59,005
How did this happen?
Did you let him off the leash?

1151
01:16:59,128 --> 01:17:02,165
Hold up. We've got one disaster here.
We don't need another one.

1152
01:17:02,288 --> 01:17:05,166
Thank you. Finally,
someone who sticks up for me.

1153
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:09,122
I meant her hair.
Losing track of Toto, I blame you.

1154
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:13,166
- Guys, this isn't my fault.
- Nothing ever is.

1155
01:17:13,288 --> 01:17:15,927
Looks like his head is drooping.
Somebody do something.

1156
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,527
We might have to cut into the street.

1157
01:17:17,648 --> 01:17:21,277
We got the neighbourhood gas turned off
and we're cutting the power off right now.

1158
01:17:21,408 --> 01:17:22,761
Yeah

1159
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:26,763
- C'mon
- C'mon

1160
01:17:26,968 --> 01:17:27,844
- C'mon
- C'mon

1161
01:17:27,968 --> 01:17:29,959
If you're likin' what we're doin'
then c'mon

1162
01:17:30,088 --> 01:17:32,238
We can turn the party out.
Make the people scream and shout

1163
01:17:32,368 --> 01:17:34,598
And then my DJ's gonna do his thing

1164
01:17:34,728 --> 01:17:35,558
- C'mon
- C'mon

1165
01:17:35,768 --> 01:17:36,518
- C'mon
- C'mon

1166
01:17:36,648 --> 01:17:38,604
If you're likin' what we're sayin'
then c'mon

1167
01:17:38,728 --> 01:17:40,639
We can turn the party out.
Make the people scream and shout

1168
01:17:40,768 --> 01:17:43,919
And then my DJ's gonna do his thing...

1169
01:17:45,848 --> 01:17:46,724
Yo, hello?

1170
01:17:46,848 --> 01:17:50,921
Ladies and gentlemen, the generators
will be back on momentarily.

1171
01:17:51,048 --> 01:17:56,998
You know what? This reminds me of
the great Manhattan blackout in 1977.

1172
01:17:57,128 --> 01:18:02,156
I was going to the movies with my friends
the Captain and Tennille, and...

1173
01:18:02,288 --> 01:18:06,281
Oh, the lights are back on.
Anyway, we were so excited...

1174
01:18:06,408 --> 01:18:09,923
Listen, everybody.
He's a Bichon Frise, OK? He's my dog.

1175
01:18:10,048 --> 01:18:12,278
It's not a salad dressing.
People get that mixed up.

1176
01:18:12,408 --> 01:18:14,968
But listen, he's stuck in the hole
and I really want him out.

1177
01:18:15,088 --> 01:18:18,603
- Please? That's all I'm asking for. Thanks.
- Thank you.

1178
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:23,927
Following our story on the crazy gridlock
surrounding Manhattan Magnet school,

1179
01:18:24,048 --> 01:18:26,437
Toto watch continues.

1180
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:28,798
We gotta help. Let's go.

1181
01:18:31,688 --> 01:18:32,803
Come on.

1182
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:36,086
Let's go.

1183
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:42,599
Yo, they've gotta move fast.
They've gotta hurry.

1184
01:18:45,528 --> 01:18:47,166
Galleria...

1185
01:18:47,288 --> 01:18:49,597
Drinka, why is everyone here?
What happened to the talent show?

1186
01:18:49,728 --> 01:18:53,403
The lights went out. It's OK.
Somebody shut down the power.

1187
01:18:56,528 --> 01:19:01,238
I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Everything
is my fault. I mean, I ruined everything.

1188
01:19:01,368 --> 01:19:03,245
I'm so sorry I got such a big head.

1189
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:07,281
It's OK. Yeah, you got a big head.

1190
01:19:07,408 --> 01:19:10,081
But it's filled with big dreams.

1191
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:13,006
And you got a big heart to match it.

1192
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:16,564
But you know what? You need to
watch out about that big mouth.

1193
01:19:19,368 --> 01:19:21,006
It's gonna be all right.

1194
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:23,847
Look, we created a little space for him,
but he's not moving.

1195
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:27,119
You're gonna have to get in here
and call to him.

1196
01:19:27,248 --> 01:19:30,923
Baby... OK, you guys, come help me.
Please, come help me.

1197
01:19:33,488 --> 01:19:35,558
Toto! Toto!

1198
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:38,361
- Come on, Toto. Toto!
- He can't hear you.

1199
01:19:38,488 --> 01:19:40,285
OK, now, come on.
Let him hear you.

1200
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,399
- "Together we can."
- OK.

1201
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:46,157
- Hold on. And sit tight
- Let him hear you.

1202
01:19:46,288 --> 01:19:49,883
Are you ready for a crazy ride?

1203
01:19:50,008 --> 01:19:52,568
- That's it. That's it.
- You're on your own

1204
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:55,361
It ain't right

1205
01:19:55,488 --> 01:20:00,198
- Something's gotta give tonight
- That's it. He's moving. Come on, faster.

1206
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,448
- Come on.
- Together we can

1207
01:20:02,448 --> 01:20:04,200
Shoot the moon. Stop the rain

1208
01:20:04,328 --> 01:20:08,207
Even ride a hurricane
if we wanna

1209
01:20:08,328 --> 01:20:12,401
- Together we can
- Walk into space. Save the human race

1210
01:20:12,528 --> 01:20:14,962
- Do you think we oughta?
- Come on, you guys. Help us out.

1211
01:20:15,088 --> 01:20:16,521
That's it. Faster.

1212
01:20:16,648 --> 01:20:18,604
Shoot the moon. Stop the rain

1213
01:20:18,728 --> 01:20:22,641
- Even ride a hurricane if we wanna
- He's wiggling. He's wiggling.

1214
01:20:22,768 --> 01:20:25,840
Come on, faster, faster.
He's wiggling. He's wiggling.

1215
01:20:25,968 --> 01:20:28,004
Come on. Come on.

1216
01:20:47,728 --> 01:20:51,562
Baby. We're so glad you're OK.

1217
01:20:52,768 --> 01:20:54,884
We're glad he's OK.

1218
01:21:13,008 --> 01:21:16,637
They all came running when you sent up
the Cheetah distress signal.

1219
01:21:16,768 --> 01:21:19,919
No. They came running for Toto.

1220
01:21:22,408 --> 01:21:24,558
The Cheetah Girls, they're actually over.

1221
01:21:26,928 --> 01:21:32,446
You know what? You were right.
I just... I just need to walk alone.

1222
01:21:32,568 --> 01:21:36,083
You know, you were right to
walk away from Jackal's offer.

1223
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:38,961
I know I was. I know.

1224
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:42,483
But now there's only one question.

1225
01:21:42,608 --> 01:21:44,883
Are you right to walk away
from your friends?

1226
01:21:46,008 --> 01:21:47,885
It's your call.

1227
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:56,164
Cheetah!

1228
01:22:34,648 --> 01:22:41,360
There's a time when we all choose

1229
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:47,677
- To either quit
- Or follow through

1230
01:22:47,808 --> 01:22:51,118
To just lose faith

1231
01:22:51,248 --> 01:22:54,524
Or trust your heart

1232
01:22:54,648 --> 01:23:01,121
To somehow lead you
through the dark

1233
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,445
You're not the only one

1234
01:23:04,568 --> 01:23:07,765
Who's dreamin'

1235
01:23:07,888 --> 01:23:13,485
Who needs help to carry on

1236
01:23:13,608 --> 01:23:17,203
We might get lonely

1237
01:23:17,328 --> 01:23:23,517
But we're not alone

1238
01:23:38,488 --> 01:23:40,638
Cos we are sisters

1239
01:23:40,768 --> 01:23:43,407
We stand together

1240
01:23:43,528 --> 01:23:47,203
We make up one big family
though we don't look the same

1241
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:49,603
Our spots are different

1242
01:23:49,728 --> 01:23:52,003
Different colours

1243
01:23:52,128 --> 01:23:56,201
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change

1244
01:23:59,088 --> 01:24:02,717
- We're Cheetah Girls. Cheetah sisters
- Gotta do what we gotta do

1245
01:24:02,848 --> 01:24:04,964
Got the brains. Got the power
and we speak the truth

1246
01:24:05,088 --> 01:24:06,680
We're from everywhere
All around the world

1247
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:09,766
So you best respect the Cheetah Girls

1248
01:24:09,888 --> 01:24:13,767
Dancing. Singing from our birth.
Working hard for what we deserve

1249
01:24:13,888 --> 01:24:17,722
Trying not to break the rules
cos Mama didn't raise no fools

1250
01:24:17,848 --> 01:24:21,921
It may seem we're only dreaming

1251
01:24:22,048 --> 01:24:25,882
And we need help to carry on

1252
01:24:26,008 --> 01:24:30,206
It's good to know we're not alone

1253
01:24:30,328 --> 01:24:32,319
Cos we are sisters

1254
01:24:32,448 --> 01:24:35,042
We stand together

1255
01:24:35,168 --> 01:24:38,877
We make up one big family
though we don't look the same

1256
01:24:39,008 --> 01:24:41,283
Our spots are different

1257
01:24:41,408 --> 01:24:43,797
Different colours

1258
01:24:43,928 --> 01:24:47,443
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change

1259
01:24:47,568 --> 01:24:50,526
Believe it. Mister

1260
01:24:50,648 --> 01:24:56,598
- We're Cheetah Girls. Cheetah sisters
- Someone's always there behind

1261
01:24:56,728 --> 01:25:01,927
To catch us if we fall

1262
01:25:05,008 --> 01:25:06,919
Come on and dance

1263
01:25:13,568 --> 01:25:15,524
Come on and bounce

1264
01:25:26,448 --> 01:25:27,767
All my girls. Bounce

1265
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:35,761
You really blew this one, Jackal.

1266
01:25:35,888 --> 01:25:38,038
Cos we are sisters

1267
01:25:38,168 --> 01:25:40,762
We stand together

1268
01:25:40,888 --> 01:25:44,597
We make up one big family
though we don't look the same

1269
01:25:44,728 --> 01:25:46,923
Our spots are different

1270
01:25:47,048 --> 01:25:49,357
Different colours

1271
01:25:49,488 --> 01:25:53,037
We make each other stronger
That ain't never gonna change

1272
01:25:53,168 --> 01:25:56,080
Believe it. Mister

1273
01:25:56,208 --> 01:26:00,724
We're Cheetah Girls. Cheetah sisters

1274
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:22,768
So we're still friends, even though
the Cheetah Girls are over?

1275
01:26:22,888 --> 01:26:24,162
The Cheetah Girls are over?

1276
01:26:24,288 --> 01:26:26,643
Girl, I can't take no more news flashes.
Come on, now.

1277
01:26:26,768 --> 01:26:29,077
But I saw the Global Getdown sign.
You guys took Jackal's deal.

1278
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:31,039
Girl, we didn't take that deal.

1279
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:34,160
We let some other puppet-heads
do that one. Believe that.

1280
01:26:34,288 --> 01:26:37,041
But, Do, are you all right with money?
What about the Gold Medal Crew?

1281
01:26:37,168 --> 01:26:40,524
I actually took the beginner class
while my instructor went on tour.

1282
01:26:40,648 --> 01:26:43,321
I'm waiting for the real
Cheetah cheddar with my girls.

1283
01:26:44,888 --> 01:26:46,958
Cheetah!

1284
01:26:49,128 --> 01:26:50,447
- Dorinda!
- Dorinda!

1285
01:26:50,568 --> 01:26:52,877
- Oh, hey.
- Honey, you were so good.

1286
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:55,317
Oh, thank you. How are you?

1287
01:26:55,448 --> 01:26:58,520
Dorinda, can I be
a Cheetah Girl this time too?

1288
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:04,121
This is Mrs Bosco. She's my
foster mom. And this is my family.

1289
01:27:04,248 --> 01:27:09,641
Oh, welcome. We need another
mama Cheetah in this jiggy jungle, huh?

1290
01:27:09,768 --> 01:27:12,726
Announcement. Announcement.

1291
01:27:12,848 --> 01:27:16,204
By an overwhelming
and unanimous decision,

1292
01:27:16,328 --> 01:27:21,197
the Manhattan Magnet High School
Talent Show's first prize goes to...

1293
01:27:21,328 --> 01:27:23,603
the Cheetah Girls.

1294
01:27:34,088 --> 01:27:36,602
Hey, Cheetah World, Galleria speaking.

1295
01:27:36,728 --> 01:27:39,117
- Jackal Johnson is calling?
- Oh, no.

1296
01:27:39,248 --> 01:27:44,720
Hello? The Cheetah Girls do not run
with wolves or hang with hyenas.

1297
01:27:44,848 --> 01:27:49,080
You tell him the Cheetah Girls follow their
own dreams and nobody else's, honey.

1298
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:52,439
You know what? Tell Jackal Johnson that
we depend on our family and our friends,

1299
01:27:52,568 --> 01:27:57,483
and the growl power of the cheetahlicious
divas who came before us, to see us home.

1300
01:27:57,608 --> 01:28:00,759
And you tell him we're gonna be stars
our day, our way.

1301
01:28:00,888 --> 01:28:04,244
Tell Jackal Johnson that
the Cheetah Girls are unavailable.

1302
01:28:12,088 --> 01:28:14,682
Cheetah!
