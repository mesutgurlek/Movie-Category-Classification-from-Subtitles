1
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,725
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Detroit Theater

2
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,562
continues our legendary talent contest
with the indefatigable Stepp Sisters!

3
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,571
I'm lookin' for something, baby

4
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:18,007
Something that'll give me a rise

5
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,835
I'm lookin' for something, baby

6
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:24,974
Like a real nice surprise

7
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,883
I'm lookin' for something, baby

8
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,683
Something that you have got

9
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,557
I'm lookin' for something, baby

10
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,128
And it's gonna be real hot

11
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,466
Ladies, you can't go.

12
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,197
hat about Jimmy?
What about the show?

13
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:49,298
Marty, you know I can talk.
Now watch me walk.

14
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,582
Sugar, Jimmy was just being Jimmy.

15
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,279
You know he's crazy about you.
Just crazy.

16
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,514
Oh, really?

17
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,922
Well, give the crazy man
a message from me.

18
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,325
Tell him I got his number.
His phone number.

19
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,686
Now, baby...

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,325
At home, where he Iives, with his wife.

21
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,602
Come on, Joann.
We don't have to put up with this shit.

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,605
Shit.

23
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,471
I'm lookin' for something, baby

24
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,413
I'm lookin' for something now

25
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,145
I'm lookin' for something, baby

26
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,381
I'm lookin' for something now

27
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,819
The unstoppable Stepp Sisters!
Let's hear it!

28
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,893
AII right now. Won't be Iong now, y'all.

29
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,593
Coming your way is the wildest man
in show business, Detroit's own

30
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,727
James "Thunder" Early
will be kicking off

31
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,932
his national tour right here
on stage tonight.

32
00:02:55,041 --> 00:03:00,536
Mercy. Mercy, mercy. Ladies? Ladies?
I've got the break of your Iives.

33
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,515
The great Jimmy Early is Iooking
for some backup help tonight...

34
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,485
Now I want you to turn it on
for Little AIbert and the Tru-Tones!

35
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,853
Me and my baby goin' downtown

36
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,620
Me and my baby gettin' down tonight

37
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,729
-I'm so sorry, Mr...
-Taylor. Curtis Taylor, Jr.

38
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,633
Look, I know we're Iate, but my mama
don't Iike me going out on weeknights.

39
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,639
So I had to wait for her to go to bed.
She's a grade-school teacher.

40
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:29,935
Who are you?

41
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,941
Deena Jones!
I'm one of The Dreamettes.

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,048
You were supposed to go on second.

43
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,209
I know, but my mama wouldn't
go to bed, so I couldn't go out.

44
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,446
Hey, tough Iuck, kid. The show's over.

45
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,180
Let me Iay something on you
right quick, brother.

46
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,881
Check it out, man.

47
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,755
Look, I know you're a great man
and you're the boss with all the Iadies,

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,327
so I don't want you
coming up weak in here,

49
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,057
but Iow-rating people, that's not
why you're in this business, right?

50
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,132
No!

51
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,636
That's good, so why don't we
give these girls a break tonight?

52
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,332
Okay, I'II put you on Iast.

53
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,277
-Right after Tiny Joe Dixon.
-Thank you.

54
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,938
Excuse me, which one is Tiny?

55
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,912
We're going downtown

56
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:20,583
Check out the sights

57
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:29,660
Okay, we're going to get down and dirty
with my man, Mr. Tiny Joe Dixon!

58
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,503
Baby, I'm takin' the long way home

59
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:43,546
'Cause my baby don't live there no more

60
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,078
I got the music to the drummer.

61
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,583
C.C., we're on next.

62
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,984
-Where is Effie?
-I'm right here.

63
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,854
God, I need to rest.
Where's our dressing room?

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,360
Effie, there's no time for that.
We go on in two minutes.

65
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,555
-What?
-Come on, Iet's warm up.

66
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,632
Move, move...

67
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,341
We're ruined unless
we can find new wigs.

68
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,608
Why do we need wigs in the first place?

69
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,917
Because we need a Iook.

70
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,681
-I got it! Turn the wigs around.
-What?

71
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,223
No, really.
Come on, turn the wigs around.

72
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:32,421
Oh, Deena, it's so different.

73
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,527
It's sophisticated Iooking. Come on!

74
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,505
Frontways or backways,
store-bought hair ain't natural.

75
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,940
And what about these dresses?

76
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:49,508
I mean, this dress does nothing
for my body.

77
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,407
-You got the same wig I got?
-Yeah.

78
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,042
-You got the same dress I got?
-Yeah.

79
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,814
Then shut up.

80
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,558
Say, Miss?

81
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,357
I think you Iook just great.

82
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,934
She left with all her clothes

83
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,499
Her bedroom in a mess

84
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:23,805
I don't know why she went away
'cause I gave her all my best

85
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,675
Baby, I'm takin' the long way home

86
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:33,081
'Cause my baby don't live there no more

87
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,125
-What's the name of your group again?
-The Dreamettes.

88
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,956
Nice, baby.

89
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,796
Yeah.

90
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,189
Let's hear it for Mr. Tiny Joe Dixon!

91
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:06,759
And now for our final act of the evening,
the courageous, the curvaceous,

92
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,719
And now for our final act of the evening,
the courageous, the curvaceous,

93
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,765
Creamettes!

94
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,891
It's The Dreamettes! The Dreamettes!

95
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,334
Move, move

96
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,633
Move right out of my life

97
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,139
Move, move

98
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,334
Move right out of my life

99
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,002
You better move

100
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,308
You're steppin' on my heart

101
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,813
I said, move

102
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,315
You're tearin' it apart

103
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,578
Please move

104
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,984
Oh, what am I gonna do?

105
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,783
My heart

106
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,085
Is breakin', breakin' up over you

107
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,456
You've got such magnetic power

108
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,534
That just keeps holding me down

109
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,467
I feel just like a flower

110
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,731
That you're keeping stuck

111
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,773
in the ground, ground, ground

112
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,741
Move, move
Move right out of my life

113
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,168
Move it, move it

114
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,779
Out of my life

115
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,111
Move right out of my life

116
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,241
Move it, move it

117
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,750
Out of my life

118
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,320
Move, move

119
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,288
Move right out of my life

120
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,225
You are so horribly satanic

121
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,262
The way you lead me around

122
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,398
I feel just like the Titanic

123
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,230
I'm always going down

124
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,030
Move, move

125
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,230
You're steppin' on my style

126
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,274
You're steppin' on my style
Yes, you are

127
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,933
I said, move, move

128
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,673
I want to breathe for a while

129
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,215
Hey, baby

130
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,986
Get out of my life

131
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,718
There's too much pain and strife

132
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,817
So why don't you pack it up
and move it?

133
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,623
Take the cat, kit and caboodle

134
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,856
Take your broken-down car

135
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,124
Your smelly cigar

136
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,200
And just move right out of my

137
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:59,795
Move right out of my life

138
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,285
Come on! Come on! You can do better!

139
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,089
Let's hear it for the delectable,
defiant Dreamettes!

140
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,843
Hey, Mister. Five dimes
say The Dreamettes don't win.

141
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,005
You got it.
They weren't going to win anyway.

142
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,678
Now remember,
the winner of this year's contest gets

143
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,951
a week's paid engagement right here
at the famous Detroit Theater.

144
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,823
AII right now.

145
00:09:55,628 --> 00:10:00,065
And that very Iucky,
very talented star of tomorrow is

146
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,194
Mr. Tiny Joe Dixon!

147
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,943
Does this mean
we're not going to be famous now?

148
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,382
Well, not tonight.

149
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,249
Come on, Iet's go home.

150
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,189
Why?

151
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,952
Because I'm tired
and I got to get up early for work.

152
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,924
I mean, what's the point?

153
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,330
Lorrell, how old were we
when we first started singing together?

154
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,489
Twelve.

155
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,228
And C.C., how many dances
you got dreamed up for us?

156
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,861
How many songs written there
in your notebook?

157
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,439
I don't know. Maybe a hundred.

158
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,708
And, Effie, have you ever met anyone
who could sing as crazy as you?

159
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,072
No.

160
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,144
And still we get nowhere?

161
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,817
So I'm asking you, what's the point?

162
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,254
The point is you don't need
an amateur contest,

163
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,879
because there's nothing
amateur about you.

164
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,289
What you need is a break,
and I'm here to give it to you.

165
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,792
Thirty bucks each
to sing behind Mr. Jimmy Early tonight.

166
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,228
Jimmy Early?

167
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,527
And a guaranteed 10-week
engagement on the road

168
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,467
starting tomorrow morning
at $400 a week.

169
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,764
-$400?
-Yes.

170
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,340
-You swear?
-If I'm Iying, I'm dying.

171
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,805
By the way, Mr. Early said
he'd hire my Aunt Ethel

172
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,673
to watch after you gals
while you're away from home.

173
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,747
Mama's going to Iove that!

174
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,138
Effie, do you hear this?

175
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,877
We're singing behind
Jimmy Early tonight!

176
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,350
-I don't do backup.
-Come on, girl.

177
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,651
AII we got to do is just sing
a few "oohs" and "aahs."

178
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,123
I don't do "oohs" and "aahs."

179
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,818
Now, you Iook, Effie.

180
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:41,495
-This could be our big break.
-Singing backup is a trap.

181
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,400
Now, I'm sorry, Mister,
but we cannot accept your offer.

182
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,637
AII right, all right, all right.

183
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,032
Look, I know you're good.

184
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,141
And you know you're good, too.
And very talented.

185
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:58,148
And not only that,
you are a stone cold fox.

186
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,010
But that ain't enough.

187
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,952
A girl Iike you can get hurt out there
if you ain't got somebody protecting you.

188
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,114
Now, I'm here to do that for you, baby.
But you got to believe me.

189
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,691
You got to trust in me.

190
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,783
I ain't gonna disappoint you.

191
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,692
-Come on, Effie? What do you say?
-Come on, Effie.

192
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,396
-Well, Mr...
-Curtis Taylor, Jr.

193
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,564
Curtis Taylor, Jr., our manager,

194
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,410
says we're singing behind
Mr. Jimmy Early tonight!

195
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,741
Oh, baby, I Iove you!

196
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,249
This business sure has got
a Iot of ups and downs!

197
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,252
Are you ready for the Thunder Man?

198
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,482
Now, he's all the way
down in the basement,

199
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,083
and he ain't coming up
unless he can hear you!

200
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,160
Let's hit it, boys. Showtime.

201
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,495
Hey, Marty, I said no mayonnaise, man.
How many times I got to tell you?

202
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,626
No mayonnaise
on the chicken sandwich!

203
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,465
We got bigger problems, baby.

204
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,732
I warned you to Iay off
the women that you work with.

205
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,001
There's plenty other Iadies out there.

206
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,576
Well, who got time
to go out and find them, Marty?

207
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,939
I'm always working, baby.

208
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,173
Yeah, 'cause Marty always
keeps you working.

209
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,509
Hell, yeah. That's why I keep Ietting you
give me the wrong sandwich.

210
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,643
Let's go get this money now.

211
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,282
-Is everything set?
-Yeah, Jimmy's down with the two girls.

212
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,756
This is a group.
It's either three or nothing.

213
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,326
Hey, man, who is this guy?

214
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,327
My clients always work together.

215
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,989
I know you.
Didn't you sell me my Cadillac?

216
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,590
Yeah, yeah. In addition to
my management company,

217
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,430
I have a Cadillac dealership
on Woodward Avenue.

218
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,268
Yeah, well, my kitty needs a tune-up.
And Jimmy only works with two, baby.

219
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,205
Sorry, brother, it's two or nothing.

220
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,847
Those the girls right there?

221
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,049
I think three is gonna work out just fine.

222
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,523
Ladies!

223
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,059
Ladies. Ladies, thank you so much.
You're saving Jimmy's Iife.

224
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,155
Thank you so much, Iadies.
I'm at your feet.

225
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,928
You see that? I'm at your feet, baby.
Thank you so much.

226
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:01,496
And I'd do anything for y'all. Anything.
You hear what I'm saying? Anything.

227
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,075
Exactly what would you Iike
Jimmy to do for you, baby?

228
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,370
Well, Mr. Early,

229
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,148
you could teach us the song.

230
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,021
Thirteen years

231
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,788
of solid gold platters

232
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,055
Rising costs

233
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,995
And cocktail chatter

234
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,168
Fat deejays

235
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,341
Stereophonic sound

236
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,641
Oh, baby

237
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,675
The game of hits

238
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,289
Goes round and around

239
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,984
But you can fake your way to the top

240
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,322
Round and around

241
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,861
T ry that part right there, baby.

242
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,055
Round and around

243
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,859
Fake your way to the top

244
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:01,933
Round and around

245
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,298
Yeah, you fell right in there,
didn't you, sweetheart?

246
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,337
You can fake your way to the top

247
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,632
Round and around

248
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,765
Shit, I knew you'd have it.

249
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,435
But it's always real, so real

250
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,104
Always so real

251
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,079
When you're coming down

252
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,544
Yeah, yeah, been around

253
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,622
Oh, I know what's happening

254
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,285
I've been around

255
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,992
Faking my way

256
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,862
Through every town

257
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,665
I've made my living

258
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,495
Off of my sound

259
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,767
And the game of hits

260
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,201
It goes around and around
and around and around

261
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,246
Around and around
and around and around

262
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,569
A man gets lonely

263
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,048
Workin' hard on the road

264
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,211
He's away from his woman

265
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,777
It's a heavy load

266
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,477
That back there is Harlem.
This is Hollywood.

267
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,806
And you ain't welcome in Hollywood.

268
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,511
Time to bring up the Iights!

269
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:07,888
Yeah, Iet's see which one of these girls
is going home with Jimmy tonight?

270
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,522
I got a nice, warm bed waiting on you.

271
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,701
AII right now. Come on now.
Who wants to sit on Daddy's Iap?

272
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,136
Yeah!

273
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,444
Mr. Early? I don't believe
all this all can be happening to me.

274
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,475
Miracles happen all the time
in the world of R&B, baby.

275
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,609
-What's R&B mean?
-Rough and black.

276
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,356
Mr. Early, you're so crazy.

277
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,894
Call me Jimmy, baby. Jimmy.

278
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:49,528
Oh, Mr. Jimmy. You're so crazy.

279
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:56,065
That does feel nice.
I mean, it feels funny.

280
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,835
You're married, aren't you?

281
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,139
Everybody say yeah

282
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,873
Yeah

283
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,346
Say yeah

284
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,439
Yeah

285
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,951
Everybody knows
Jimmy's married, baby.

286
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,917
Then...

287
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,727
Then you get your married hands off!

288
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,631
So it's gonna take two weeks.

289
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,076
I faked my way to the top

290
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,441
Round and around

291
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,014
Oh, yeah

292
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,447
Round and around

293
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,074
I faked my way to the top

294
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,652
Round and around

295
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,714
Round and around

296
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,290
You know I faked my way to the top

297
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,858
Round and around

298
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,657
It's always real, so real

299
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,561
When you're coming down

300
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:02,003
I faked my way, yes, I did

301
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,913
Help me, Jesus

302
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,414
Help, help, help me, Jesus

303
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,418
I faked my way to the top

304
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,795
Did you notice
the seats are periwinkle blue

305
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,771
to go along with
your pretty blue dress? And...

306
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,308
-Would you excuse me?
-Certainly.

307
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,139
Wayne? Help me out.

308
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,714
Hi.

309
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,505
How can I help you today?

310
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,979
Here. This is our periwinkle blue.
Matches your dress.

311
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:06,905
I'm just saying, you might do better
if you were just a Iittle more, you know...

312
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,999
I'm just saying, you might do better
if you were just a Iittle more, you know...

313
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,441
-Shy? Sugar-sweet, Iike you?
-Boys seem to Iike it.

314
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,343
Well, I am not interested
in boys, Deena.

315
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,972
What are you Iadies jawing about?

316
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,712
Well, Curtis, we were just wondering...

317
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,290
Do you cheat on your wife,
Iike Mr. Jimmy Early?

318
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,882
Hey, Effie! I don't know her.

319
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,989
Deena's right.
It's really none of our business.

320
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,123
We don't even know if you're married.

321
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,634
I was married. It didn't work out.

322
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,971
Well, was she one of those teeny Iittle
tweety-birds Iike Iittle Miss Deena here?

323
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,044
Or do you prefer a real woman?

324
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,374
Well, actually, I was raised
by my older sisters,

325
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,641
and they were just as real as you are.

326
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,446
Well, why don't you sit down
and tell me about them?

327
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,715
You know, I would Iove to,
but give me a minute.

328
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,262
It ain't working, Marty.
That faint used to kill 'em.

329
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,268
-It used to slay 'em in the aisles.
-SIay 'em in the aisles, baby.

330
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,564
But now you got everybody doing it.

331
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,935
You got Otis, J.B.
Everybody doing my shit.

332
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,302
You're right, Jimmy.
Everybody's doing it.

333
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,375
Well, who's the original?

334
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,909
Who was the first one to fall down
and start screaming?

335
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,273
-That was you.
-I'm the first!

336
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,177
And you killed 'em tonight, baby.
It was beautiful, Jimmy. Beautiful.

337
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,182
Marty, you're full of shit, man.
I need something.

338
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,343
Man, I need something...

339
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,352
That's what I need.
Sweet Mother Jesus.

340
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,786
I need that right there!

341
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,058
What you need is a new sound.

342
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,092
What I need is a new Caddy.
That one you sold me is dripping oil.

343
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,628
Hey, Jimmy, you remember C.C.,
Effie's brother?

344
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,726
He's a very talented composer.

345
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,634
Yeah, I remember you.
You wrote that song, Move On.

346
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,331
Move.
The girls be, "Move, move, move."

347
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,738
Yeah, that was me, man.

348
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,835
-AII right.
-Yeah.

349
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,437
What did you think of that song, Marty?

350
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,807
Well, I think it was kind of...

351
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,084
You know...

352
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:09,653
-Kind of boring, I thought.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

353
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,720
It's boring, kid.

354
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,662
I'm no kid, mister.

355
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,636
I'm sorry, baby,
but when Jimmy's involved,

356
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,729
the song got to have some soul!

357
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,546
Damn! Lord have mercy!

358
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,742
Got to have soul!

359
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,918
Soul, gospel, R&B, jazz, blues,

360
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,390
everything else the man
has grabbed from us.

361
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,290
Listen, there's got to be a better way
for us to get our music

362
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,419
to a broader audience,

363
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,521
only this time
with our artists and our money.

364
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,496
Marty, this man is handing me
a Iine of crap.

365
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,160
Yeah, I know, baby.

366
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:56,598
Got me a Cadillac
Cadillac, Cadillac

367
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,836
Got me a Cadillac car

368
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,580
Got me a Cadillac
Cadillac, Cadillac

369
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,343
Look at me, mister, I'm a star

370
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,389
I know what you cats are trying to do,
and you can forget it.

371
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:21,193
James Early ain't no street-corner punk
Iooking for his first date.

372
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,160
He's an established artist
with a recording contract.

373
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,034
On a shitty Iocal Iabel
that can't get him to the pop charts.

374
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,266
We can't do nothing about that.

375
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,468
AII I'm asking is one record, man.
One song with a simple hook.

376
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,910
"Look at me in my pretty car,
makes me feel Iike a movie star."

377
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,505
You know where all the hits
happen these days? In cars, man.

378
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,212
Songs that make you feel good
while you're driving your automobile.

379
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,113
Yeah?

380
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,217
Jimmy's fans Iike taking the bus.

381
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,523
Let's hit it, Jimmy.

382
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,230
Hey, what do you think about
using that bridge there, baby?

383
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,933
Movin' out

384
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,734
Movin' up

385
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,206
Movin' on

386
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,675
Sounds a Iittle tick-tock, boys.

387
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,075
Let's stay in the pocket.

388
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,808
Going to work! Shut it down!

389
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,611
Recording, Cadillac Car. Take nine.

390
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,778
I got me a Cadillac

391
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,287
Cadillac, Cadillac

392
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,756
I got me a Cadillac car

393
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,050
Got me a Cadillac

394
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,526
Cadillac, Cadillac

395
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,620
Look at me, mister, I'm a star

396
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,190
I'm on the move

397
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,969
I'm gettin' on

398
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,567
I'm breakin' out

399
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,333
And it won't take long

400
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,873
Behind the wheel

401
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,374
Got a song

402
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,943
Pedal's down

403
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,570
And I'm gone

404
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,812
We've got that coming up
in the next hour,

405
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,978
but for now,
Iet me get a hold of your ear.

406
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,749
It's a different sound
for the Thunder Man.

407
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,518
And I think you're gonna enjoy it.

408
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,354
Got me a Cadillac

409
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,020
Cadillac, Cadillac

410
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,155
Oh, my God, Lorrell!
Do you hear that? That's us!

411
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,291
We're on the radio, Curtis!

412
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,338
-What's happening?
-BIack station, the signal's too weak.

413
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,963
Turn this boat around! Hurry up!

414
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,201
C.C., fix it! What are you waiting for?

415
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,035
Antenna's up

416
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,373
Top is down

417
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,981
Peelin' out

418
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,481
Don't care where I'm bound

419
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,107
Got these four wheels

420
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,583
Spinnin' round

421
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,381
Me and my two-tone Caddy

422
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:26,116
Gonna blow this town

423
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,691
Movin' out

424
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:32,396
Cadillac Car is No. 8 on the R&B charts,
and No. 98 on the pop charts.

425
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,794
Movin' out

426
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,460
Movin' up

427
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,795
Movin' on

428
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,143
Right to the top

429
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,306
Got me a Cadillac

430
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,635
Cadillac, Cadillac

431
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:21,303
Got me a Cadillac car

432
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,473
Oh, I've got me a Cadillac

433
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,744
Cadillac, Cadillac

434
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:31,117
Look at me, mister, I'm a star

435
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,218
Look at me, mister, I'm a star

436
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,694
Look at me, mister

437
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:45,827
I'm a star

438
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,102
That's Dave & the Sweethearts
with their marvelous

439
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,339
new recording, Cadillac Car.

440
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,750
You hear this shit?

441
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,127
You hear this shit?

442
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,026
They act Iike we don't even exist!

443
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,666
Is that how it works, Curtis?

444
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,997
The man decides he wants something,
he just takes it?

445
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,697
I mean, how can they do that?
That's my song.

446
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,768
Our song.

447
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,240
Marty says this happens all the time.
Once something...

448
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,970
That's bullshit, man!
He should have protected us!

449
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:30,479
Wake up, brother.
The only one that can protect you is me.

450
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,551
Who was the first artist
to sing Hound Dog?

451
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,881
EIvis Presley.

452
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,849
Big Mama Thornton. She had
the No. 1 single on the R&B charts,

453
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:40,925
but white stations wouldn't play it

454
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,358
because to them it was
just another race record.

455
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:47,830
We are gonna make friends with the
most important deejays in this country.

456
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,560
It's strictly pay-for-play with those boys.

457
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,001
That takes money. Real money.

458
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,767
What is that? Chicken scratch?

459
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,032
Let's get to work.

460
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,874
Steppin' to the bad side

461
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,113
Gonna take a mean ride

462
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,653
The smile I had is gone away

463
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,087
Those that steal are gonna pay

464
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:18,925
Steppin' to the bad side today

465
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,364
I'm telling you now, it's got to end

466
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,731
No more trusting them, my friend

467
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:25,894
Change our style

468
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,096
Change our tone

469
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,139
Make the songs we sing our own

470
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,800
Steppin' to the bad side

471
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,511
Gonna take a mean ride

472
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,051
I'll get you all the breaks you need

473
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,382
In just two years, we'll be in the lead

474
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,718
Can't sit back, it's plain to see

475
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,985
Open your eyes and trust in me

476
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,288
Steppin' to the bad side

477
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,160
Gonna take a mean ride

478
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,732
I was a man who tried to be good

479
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,136
I was always misunderstood

480
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,037
You can't play fair or be too meek

481
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,541
You gotta get way down

482
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,009
and show your danger streak

483
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,248
Steppin' to the bad side

484
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,444
Here's a great new song
from Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes.

485
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,885
Gonna take a mean ride

486
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,426
...a new hit from Jimmy Early
and The Dreamettes.

487
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,554
It's called Steppin' to the Bad Side.

488
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:01,454
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
to the Apollo Theater's legendary stage

489
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,693
Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes,

490
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,203
singing their No. 1 hit,
Steppin' to the Bad Side.

491
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,970
Steppin' to the bad side

492
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,101
Steppin' to the bad side

493
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,305
Steppin' to the bad side

494
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,439
Steppin' to the bad side

495
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,609
Steppin' to the bad side

496
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,879
Steppin' to the bad side

497
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,012
Steppin' to the bad side

498
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,216
Steppin' to the bad side

499
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,156
Steppin' to the bad side

500
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,559
I had to step into the bad side

501
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,534
I had to take myself a mean ride

502
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,436
You know that smile I had is gone away

503
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,070
Those that steal are gonna pay

504
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,905
Steppin' to the bad side today

505
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,538
A man just stole my woman from me

506
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,774
He took her down to Tennessee

507
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,612
She was the best girl I ever knew

508
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,118
If it wasn't for him, she'd still be true

509
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,347
Always been a good man, it's been said

510
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,515
When I catch the man
He'll wish he was dead

511
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,718
Men like him make good men mad

512
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:06,388
Starting today I'm gonna be bad

513
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:10,963
I'm steppin' to the bad side

514
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,029
I have to take myself a mean ride

515
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,402
You know that smile I had is gone away

516
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,842
Those that steal are gonna pay

517
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,971
Steppin' to the bad side

518
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,073
Steppin' to the bad side

519
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,617
Steppin' to the bad side

520
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:32,713
Steppin' to the bad side today

521
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,320
-Step on
-Step on to the bad side

522
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,055
Step on to the bad side

523
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,427
-Step on
-Step on to the bad side

524
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,659
Steppin' to the bad side

525
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:47,226
-Step on
-Step on to the bad side

526
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,239
Steppin' to the bad side

527
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,187
Got to step to the bad side

528
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,462
The motor is now cranked up

529
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,690
and we are moving up
the highway of freedom

530
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,767
toward the city of equality.

531
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,302
And we can't afford to stop now,

532
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,704
because our nation
has a date with destiny.

533
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,605
We must keep moving.

534
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,245
I have a dream this afternoon

535
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,081
that one day right here in Detroit,

536
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,715
Negroes will be able to buy a house

537
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,822
anywhere that their money
will carry them,

538
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,184
and they will be able to get a job.

539
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,021
Made my peach cobbler!

540
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:47,956
Curtis!

541
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,399
-Hey, baby, you know my sisters.
-T ell me something.

542
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,130
Do you think it's right to promote
an amateur performer

543
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,899
over a professional?

544
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,304
I don't know what this is about.

545
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,605
It's about fairness, Curtis.
It's about people paying their dues.

546
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:05,411
Ain't that what you keep telling me?
"Get in Iine, Effie. Wait your turn."

547
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:10,881
So why am I sitting here without
so much as a B-side on the 45

548
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,891
when an amateur Iike
Martin Luther King, Jr.

549
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,389
gets his own freakin' album?

550
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,793
I mean, can he even sing?

551
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,477
AII right, that was a good one.

552
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,444
You're a great man, Curtis.

553
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,648
Isn't your brother a great man?

554
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,116
We already know you are.

555
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,797
Never met a man

556
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,992
Quite like you

557
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,998
Doin' all he can

558
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,238
Makin' my dreams come true

559
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,512
You're strong and you're smart

560
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,584
You've taken my heart

561
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:17,347
And I'll give you the rest of me, too

562
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,883
You're the perfect man for me

563
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,483
I love you, I do

564
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,859
I love you

565
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,360
Never felt

566
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,831
quite like this

567
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,508
Hold it, hold it. I promise
I'II get to all of you in a minute,

568
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,908
but right now I need
someone that can type.

569
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,640
Anybody got some
secretarial experience?

570
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,841
-I can do it.
-You? Come on.

571
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,051
What's all this?

572
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,247
AII right, come in.

573
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,855
You're the perfect man for me

574
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,624
I love you, I do

575
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,435
You've got the charm

576
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,903
You simply disarm me every time

577
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,200
As long as you drive

578
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,871
I'm along for the ride your way

579
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,347
You said it before

580
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,147
There won't be a door

581
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,223
That's closed to us

582
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,260
I'm puttin' all my trust in you

583
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:37,098
'Cause you, you'll always be true

584
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,601
I never could have known

585
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,268
This would be

586
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,237
You and you alone

587
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,206
All for me

588
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,317
I know you're the best

589
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,354
You've passed every test

590
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,324
It's almost too good to be true

591
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,554
You're the perfect man for me

592
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,824
I love you, I do

593
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:15,799
You're the perfect man for me

594
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:21,539
I love you, I do

595
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,186
C.C. wrote it for me.

596
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,885
What do you think, Curtis?

597
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,463
It's too Iight.
We want it Iight, but not that Iight.

598
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:41,657
Not that Iight?

599
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,064
Okay, but when we fix it,
you're gonna put it in the show, right?

600
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,135
First things first.

601
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,703
I got to get Jimmy booked
down in Miami,

602
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,101
even if I got to buy my own hotel.

603
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,970
But you promised I wouldn't spend
my Iife singing backup, Curtis.

604
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,042
And I still promise that.

605
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:55,271
I'm not gonna Iet this beautiful voice
go to waste.

606
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,505
You just got to trust me.

607
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,708
-Can we talk about it more tonight?
-AII night.

608
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,284
-AII right.
-Bye, man.

609
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,382
AII right.

610
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,725
Boy, you're a real snake.

611
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,593
A cheap, second-rate hustler.
Street-corner con artist.

612
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,293
Look, you want to buy a car, Marty?
Why don't we talk about it in my office?

613
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,926
I'm away a week,
and you cancel dates behind my back.

614
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,164
I spent six months
setting up this tour for Jimmy.

615
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,968
Jimmy's too big for
that Chitlin Circuit shit.

616
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,168
I'm trying to get him booked
at the Paradise in Miami.

617
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,539
-Miami?
-Miami.

618
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,612
You're really drifting out there, chump.

619
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,515
You couldn't get Sammy Davis, Jr.
in there.

620
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:35,074
That place is so white, they
don't even Iet our boys park the cars.

621
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,846
I got him an audition.

622
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:41,389
-Luck, man. Hustler's Iuck.
-That's just the beginning.

623
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,357
Then we're gonna do the Copa,
the Americana.

624
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,860
He could even do American Bandstand.

625
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,452
I've been in this business
too many years

626
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:50,227
-to Iisten to some hotshot talk bullshit.
-Not bullshit, Marty. Change.

627
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,667
I'm talking change. Can't you see?
The time is now.

628
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,366
Jimmy needs a new act, something
classier, with a catchier sound.

629
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,908
That'II go down better with white folks.

630
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,170
That'II put him where he should be,

631
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,075
making the type of money
he should be making.

632
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,977
He's at the top of the pop charts.
He's hot.

633
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,477
-We can do this for him.
-We?

634
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,489
-Yeah, we.
-We do nothing.

635
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,858
Jimmy's mine, so back off, Curtis.
Jimmy's mine.

636
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,986
Jimmy don't belong to no one.

637
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,165
Are you defending
this car salesman, Jimmy?

638
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,790
Can't you see he's using you?

639
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,495
Ain't nobody using Jimmy, all right?
Nobody.

640
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:30,138
Who do you think you're
talking to, baby? It's Marty.

641
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:33,635
The man who found you singing for
pennies when you were 10 years old.

642
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,872
It's a whole new day, Marty,
and a brand new Jimmy.

643
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,887
You want him, brother? You got him.

644
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,650
I'm through.

645
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,693
-Hey, what you doing?
-You can't have it all, baby.

646
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,229
Hey, come on, Marty, don't go.
I want you to stay.

647
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,330
I Iove you, Jimmy.

648
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,963
But you can't have it all.

649
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,744
Lady, you got to be Jewish.
Of course, yeah, of course.

650
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,946
It's 1 05 degrees in here, and you're
the only one wearing a mink stole.

651
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,523
Hey, my friend, what's your nationality?

652
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:19,648
Hey, my friend, what's your nationality?

653
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,317
"Nationality." I know it's a big word.
What are you, Cuban?

654
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,656
Of course. You're Cuban.
You're Cuban, I'm a Jew.

655
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,491
You know, I say this
from the bottom of my heart.

656
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,997
A Negro, if he had enough money,
could move into my neighborhood.

657
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,624
You, not a chance.

658
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,997
Tonight, though,
we're here to make history.

659
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,700
The first Negro headliners
to ever play Miami Beach.

660
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,207
What do you think of that?

661
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,073
Come on.
It's a very convenient arrangement.

662
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,442
These are good people.
I mean, they can sing, they can dance,

663
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,710
they can even mop up afterwards.
You can't find help Iike that.

664
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,879
Anyway, please give a warm round
of applause to the very talented

665
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,390
Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes!
Come on!

666
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:07,868
I want you, baby

667
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,706
I want you

668
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,835
And I need you, baby

669
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:18,448
I need you

670
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,048
Oh, baby

671
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,675
Baby

672
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,910
You got me on my knees

673
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,319
Got me on my knees

674
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,892
You got me begging

675
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,292
Baby, baby

676
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,695
Baby, baby

677
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:41,362
Baby, please

678
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,908
I know you don't trust

679
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,611
the way I feel

680
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,515
You know, we can always create
a younger Iook for American Bandstand.

681
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,585
Yeah.

682
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:02,051
You got me on my knees

683
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,626
You got me beggin'

684
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,995
Baby, baby

685
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,362
Baby, baby

686
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,338
Oh, yeah

687
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:28,384
Oh, I want you, baby

688
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,219
And I need you, baby

689
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,052
Yes, I do

690
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,718
I want you

691
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,128
Baby, you got me, baby

692
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,463
Now I'm yours, baby

693
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,978
Yes!

694
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,529
I Iove me some Jimmy, but he's
gonna have to stop calling me "baby."

695
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:17,726
I'm a woman now.

696
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,393
Did you see the man
Curtis was sitting with?

697
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,106
Did you hear what I said, Deena?
I am a woman now.

698
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,539
-Lorrell, I know.
-What do you mean, you know?

699
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,635
-Has Jimmy talked?
-He didn't have to.

700
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,010
How could you?
Come on, you're just a baby, Lorrell.

701
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:34,881
I am not, Deena. I'm a woman now.
I'm 18, so I'm a woman.

702
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,146
Yeah, she's a mature woman, Iike me,

703
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,155
and she Ioves Jimmy
just as much as I Iove Curtis.

704
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,988
-It's not wrong when you Iove someone.
-Is that all you two can think about?

705
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:45,254
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

706
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:48,154
Well, there's no doubt
my mama brought me up fit.

707
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:52,133
-Deena, you're just jealous.
-Let yourself go just once.

708
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,330
It's so wonderful
to have somebody to Iove.

709
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,971
-You Iadies decent?
-Well, I am.

710
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,477
-I can't speak for these two.
-Hey, babe.

711
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,780
Curtis, how did it go
with American Bandstand?

712
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:08,874
Timing's not right.

713
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,921
Well, maybe they'II be more
interested after we play the Copa.

714
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,819
-Y'all ain't playing the Copa.
-What?

715
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,650
I'm breaking you and Jimmy up.

716
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,660
I know what you're doing, Curtis!

717
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,889
You're breaking us up 'cause
you don't want me with Jimmy.

718
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,465
None of you do!
Because you're all jealous!

719
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,126
Well, nothing's breaking me
and Jimmy up! Nothing!

720
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:29,628
I'm breaking you up because
Jimmy is going back out on the road,

721
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,867
while you stay here
and open your own act.

722
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,669
Did you say our own act?

723
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,736
Finally, Curtis! This is what
I've been waiting for. I Iove you.

724
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,142
Oh, well, honey, I'm fine with that.
I mean, I Iove me some Jimmy,

725
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,150
but I don't want to be singing
behind him the rest of my Iife.

726
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,686
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting The Dreams.

727
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,881
The Dreamettes were Iittle girls.
You're women now.

728
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,050
-You see, Deena, I told you!
-We open in a week,

729
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,252
so we got a Iot of work to do.
We're gonna have a Iot of changes.

730
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,853
I'm bringing on Jolly Jenkins
to stage a whole new show.

731
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,865
He's done movies, Broadway,
clubs acts, you name it.

732
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,561
New wigs, the expensive kind.

733
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,805
Brand-new costumes
to appeal to a younger crowd.

734
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,404
And...

735
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,270
Effie?

736
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,303
-Deena's going to sing Iead.
-Deena's doing what?

737
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,346
-Lead.
-What do you mean?

738
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:18,649
-I always sing Iead. Tell him, C.C.
-We're trying something new, Effie.

739
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,385
-You knew about this?
-Curtis and I talked it over.

740
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,687
He said it's only temporary.

741
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,660
We finally get the chance
to have our own act

742
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,325
and Deena's doing Iead?

743
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,300
She can't sing Iike I can.

744
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,531
She's right, Curtis. I can't.

745
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,307
I don't want to.

746
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:42,678
Now, y'all gonna do what I tell you to do.
This is a new sound with a new Iook.

747
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,476
New Iook?
Nobody can see her on a record!

748
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,917
The only way we'II be able to change
things is by appealing to kids,

749
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,748
and kids today watch television.

750
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:55,052
So Deena's going to sing the Iead
'cause you Iike the way she Iooks?

751
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,324
Am I ugly to you, Curtis?

752
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,765
Baby, come on. You know
how I feel about you. Come on.

753
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,804
-Don't make it personal.
-Well, what am I supposed to do?

754
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,137
Deena's beautiful and she's
always been beautiful!

755
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,938
But I've got the voice, Curtis!
I've got the voice!

756
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,240
You can't put me in back! You just can't!

757
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,043
Well, you'II be singing backup with me.
What's so wrong with that?

758
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,516
Let Deena do all the work for a change.

759
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,950
Your voice alone is too special.

760
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,217
We need a Iighter sound
to cross over to the pop charts.

761
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,951
It's what we need.

762
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,797
What about what I need?

763
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,094
Curtis says it's the
best thing for the group.

764
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:44,003
What about what's best for me?

765
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,440
He feels The Dreams can cross over.

766
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:51,144
What about how I feel?

767
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:55,179
But when we're famous,
I'II write great things for you.

768
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,245
Effie, do it for me.

769
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,888
What about me?

770
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,925
What about me?

771
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:17,100
It's more than you

772
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:21,808
It is more than me

773
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,073
No matter what we are

774
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,815
We are a family

775
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:33,748
This dream is for all of us

776
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:38,157
This one can be real

777
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,921
And you can't stop us now

778
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:47,069
Because of how you feel

779
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:50,800
It's more than you

780
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:56,078
It is more than me

781
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,272
Whatever dreams we have

782
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,584
They're for the family

783
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,182
We're not alone anymore

784
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:12,160
Now there are others there

785
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:13,997
And that dream is big enough

786
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,125
And that dream is big enough

787
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:21,198
For all of us to share

788
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,773
So don't think you're going

789
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:27,640
You're not going anywhere

790
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:31,976
You're staying and taking your share

791
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:35,711
And if you get afraid again

792
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,854
I'll be there

793
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,515
We are a family

794
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,993
Like a giant tree

795
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,462
Branching out toward the sky

796
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,090
We are a family

797
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,534
We are so much more

798
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:57,072
Than just you and I

799
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,438
We are a family

800
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,807
Like a giant tree

801
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:06,679
Growing stronger, growing wiser

802
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:11,948
We are growing

803
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,380
free

804
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,927
We need you

805
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:27,193
We are a family

806
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:45,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

807
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,781
the Crystal Room is proud to present

808

809
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:06,299
Every man has his own special dream

810

811

812
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,206
If you open your eyes

813
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,310

818
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:30,723

821
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,734
No, no

822
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:40,708
And all you've got to do is dream, baby

823
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,211
We'll be there

824
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,879

826
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:54,483

Boys, we'll always...

835
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,847
I'm amazed, Mr. T aylor.
Much as I Iove my daughter,

836
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,940
I never thought
she had much of a voice.

837
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:24,179
Deena has something better.
She has a quality.

838
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,654
-You make her sound Iike a product.
-Product. I Iike that.

839
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:32,525
We'll be there

840
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,962
Dream

841
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,263
Dream girls will help you to survive

842
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,566
Dream

843
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,903
Dream girls will keep
your fantasies alive

844
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,944
Dream girls always love you
and they'll be true

845
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,709
Your dream girl can only
make love to you

846
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,250
I'm not the dream that you had before

847
00:50:55,352 --> 00:51:02,053
I'm the dream that will give you
more and more

848
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,956
We're your dream girls

849
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,224

850
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,854

00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:15,133
Boys, we'll always care

853
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,365
We're your dream girls

854
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,998
Dream girls

855
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,942
Dream girls will never leave you

856
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,446
And all you've got to do is dream

857
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,712
All you've got to do is dream

858
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,653
All you've got to do is dream

859
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,852
Baby, we'll be there

860
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,723
We're your dream girls

861
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,592
Oh, yeah

862
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,892
Dream girls

863
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:47,025
All you've got to do is dream

864
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,264
All you've got to do is dream

865
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:52,034
Just dream, baby

866
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,040
We'll be there

867
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,339
We'll be there

868
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:02,547
We will be there

869
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,787
We'll be there

870
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,141
Who was the first one
to wear shiny clothes?

871
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:35,548
-Little Richard.
-That was me, baby! I started that.

872
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,212
You remember that burgundy jacket
I had with the bolt Iightning on the back?

873
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,154
Lightning was in glitter.
GIitter's shiny, baby.

874
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:44,284
-Hey, Jimmy.
-...Deena Jones and The Dreams.

875
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,759
Rumors at Abbey Road say

876
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,092
George Martin is keen to work with
the talented trio.

877
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,462
Could they be ready to record
with the Fab Four?

878
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,660
Well, the boys will just have to wait.

879
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:55,260
These girls are busy
blazing a trail across the globe.

880
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,780
People ask me
how I came up with the sound.

881
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,440
I tell them it's Iike
making a great sundae.

882
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,951
You start out with two scoops
of ice cream, some sauce,

883
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:13,784
-and then you put a cherry on top.
-And is Deena the cherry?

884
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,990
Why, Miss Jones is the cherry,
the nuts, the sauce, the cream

885
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:21,859
-and the banana, too.
-Miss Jones, right here.

886
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:35,606
We look on with shock and dismay at
the images we're bringing you tonight.

887
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:40,809
Detroit under siege and in flames
as rioters and looters storm the city.

888
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:44,318
President Johnson has declared
a state of emergency.

889
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,984
You used to be so light and free

890
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:51,219
You used to smile just looking at me

891
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:54,491
Now all you give is jealous hate

892
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:55,724
Come on, baby

893
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:57,697
Better lose some weight

894
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,133
Heavy, heavy

895
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,297
You got so heavy, baby

896
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:05,508
Stop!

897
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,811
Effie, what's going on?
You are still too Ioud.

898
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,212
-I'm trying, Curtis.
-If you don't ease up, I'II do it for you.

899
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,749
Maybe we should
just come back in the morning.

900
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,115
You know we can't.
The album's already a month Iate.

901
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,881
Look, I know you're tired.
You're tired, right?

902
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,456
-Can I just get one more?
-Okay.

903
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,024
AII right? Okay.

904
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:24,821
Let's get it right.

905
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:35,069
Record Heavy, Heavy. Take 30.

906
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,867
Heavy, heavy

907
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:42,001
You got so heavy, baby

908
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,179
Heavy, heavy

909
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:49,275
You got so heavy on me

910
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,757
-Where do you think you're going?
-You're a Iiar, Curtis.

911
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:55,825
You'd better watch your mouth.

912
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,393
You're sleeping with her
and everyone knows!

913
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,561
Hey, hey, hey, don't go out there!

914
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,037
Burn it up!

915
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,800
-We're black-owned!
-Yeah!

916
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,537
-You all right?
-I don't feel well, Curtis.

917
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:22,584
CBS's Star Cavalcade
presents the incredible Dreams

918
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,052
singing their latest hit, Heavy, Heavy.

919
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:27,816
You got so heavy, baby

920
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,286
Heavy, heavy

921
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:35,023
You got so heavy on me

922
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:38,765
You used to want nothing from me

923
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:42,063
You used to say, "Let's both be free"

924
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:45,107
You used to dance instead of walk

925
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,302
-Tighten up on camera two. Tighten up.
-Move in, camera two.

926
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,276
Heavy, heavy

927
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,047
You got so heavy, baby

928
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,548
Talk, talk, talk

929
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,243
Heavy, heavy

930
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,650
Talk, talk, talk

931
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:01,212
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy

932
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,563
Effie, you're going crazy!
T ell me, what have I done?

933
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,230
You stole my dream, Deena,
and you stole my man!

934
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:17,738
I don't want to hear that kind of talk
out of you...

935
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,638
Don't act Iike you don't know
what this is about!

936
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,233
Effie, stop screaming.
Everybody can hear you.

937
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,834
I don't care! Let them all hear!

938
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,938
I'm warning you, Effie, you stop
bringing us down! And get back there!

939
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:30,213
Why, Curtis? You don't need me.
AII you care about is her bony ass!

940
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,947
You better back off.

941
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,090
Or what?

942
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,787
I didn't think so.

943
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,067
Love, love me, baby

944
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,808
Love, love me, child

945
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:58,370
'Cause, baby, baby, baby
You're driving me wild

946
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:01,143
Listen, Iisten, Iisten.
The mirrors got to turn together, guys.

947
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,741
They got to dance.

948
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:06,310
Mr. T aylor? We have
a bigger problem on our hands.

949
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,051
Do I have to remind you
that it's New Year's Eve?

950
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,922
Burt, don't worry about it.
I've got it taken care of.

951
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:14,986
These people are paying 50 bucks.
They expect to see three girls.

952
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,463
Trust me.

953
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,899
-Curtis, I just don't feel right about this.
-It's done.

954
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,153
Wardrobe needs you first.

955
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,494
We are a family

956
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,034
Like a giant tree

957
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,036
Branching out toward the sky

958
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,538
We are a family

959
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,145
-I'm sorry I'm Iate.
-Effie.

960
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,539
C.C., sorry I missed rehearsals.

961
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,446
But I went to the doctor,
and I am feeling much better now.

962
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:09,950
Look, don't try to make it tonight.

963
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,146
What are you talking about, baby?
It's New Year's Eve.

964
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,052
Yeah.
Curtis just stepped out to make a call.

965
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,217
Why don't you go up to your room
and Iater he'II come up and talk to you?

966
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,490
I said, I'm fine.

967
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,558
Excuse me. I have to get dressed now.

968
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:27,430
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

969
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:30,506
I got all the steps down,
but those harmonies...

970
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,868
C.C., what's going on?

971
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,238
Lorrell, what's going on?

972
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,982
-Effie, Curtis was supposed to...
-Love me.

973
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,620
Curtis was supposed to Iove me.

974
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:50,284
There you are, Effie.
I've been Iooking all over.

975
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:54,090
I turn my back and find myself
out on the line

976
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,630
You could have warned me

977
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:58,394
But that would have been too kind

978
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:01,436
I've been warning you for months
to clean up your act.

979
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,301
You've been Iate, you've been mean,

980
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,374
giving all kinds of bullshit flack.

981
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,236
That's a lie, that's a lie

982
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,780
It's just I haven't been feeling that well

983
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,870
Effie, please!

984
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,381
Stop excusing yourself.

985
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:15,883
You've been Iate, you've been mean,

986
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,475
and getting fatter all the time.

987
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:18,986
Now, you're lyin', lyin'

988
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,749
I've never been so thin!

989
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,051
You're lyin', you're lyin'

990
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,785
'Cause you're knocking off that piece

991
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,861
Who thinks she's better than everybody

992
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,953
She ain't better than anybody!

993
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,895
She ain't nothing but common!

994
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,364
Now, who you calling common

995
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:35,904
You self-indulgent, self-absorbed,
non-professional?

996
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:38,405
You! I'm calling you

997
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:41,773
I'm calling you the common piece
he's knocking off

998
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,938
Now, you listen to me
Miss Blame It On The World

999
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,482
See, I've put up with you
for much too long

1000
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,609
I have put up with your bitching

1001
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,277
I've put up with your nagging

1002
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:54,049
And all your screaming, too

1003
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:58,560
Now, when are you two gonna stop
all this fighting?

1004
00:59:58,661 --> 00:59:59,855
Stay out of this, Lorrell.

1005
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,157
This is between Deena and me.

1006
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,129
Yeah? Well, it's between me, too!

1007
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:06,099
I'm as much a part of this group
as anybody else

1008
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:09,399
And I'm tired, Effie, I'm tired

1009
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,837
of all the problems you're making us

1010
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,273
I always knew you two were together

1011
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:15,344
What?

1012
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,969
I always knew you two
were ganging up on me!

1013
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,606
She had nothing to do with this change

1014
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,116
It was you, it was you

1015
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,778
Always thinking of you!

1016
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,788
Always thinking of you!

1017
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,482
I knew you were trouble from the start

1018
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:30,581
T rouble?

1019
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,888
You were real bad trouble from the start

1020
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,156
Curtis, I'm your woman.

1021
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:34,631
But you're getting out now

1022
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,256
But you're getting out now

1023
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,925
I'm not building this group
to have you tear it apart

1024
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:41,299
Go ahead and rant and scream
and shout!

1025
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:44,737
Don't worry, baby, I'll buy you out

1026
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:47,332
There's no money
dirty enough to buy me out.

1027
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:49,001
You remember that, Curtis.

1028
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,046
Lay off, Effie

1029
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,946
Just take the money and run

1030
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,812
You're in this with him, C.C.?

1031
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:57,147
Cool it, Effie

1032
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,212
This time you know what you done

1033
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,017
So they bought
your black ass, too, huh?

1034
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,354
I said, cool it, Effie

1035
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,555
This time you've gone too far

1036
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,323
Oh, I can go further! I can go further!

1037
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,456
I don't want to stay around this

1038
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,825
I'm just breakin' into this business

1039
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,598
This is between all of you

1040
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,371
-This is none of my affair
-Yeah?

1041
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,535
Well, it's between you, too
Now, little sister

1042
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,079
This snow job is as much your sin

1043
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,082
Look at me! Look at me!

1044
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,948
How much did you put out to get in?

1045
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:34,546
Now, you watch your mouth
Watch your mouth, Miss Effie White

1046
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,787
'Cause I don't take that talk
from no second-rate diva

1047
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,385
who can't sustain

1048
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,863
I'm not feeling well, I've got pain

1049
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,901
Effie, we all got pain!

1050
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:50,996
For seven years, I've sung with you
I was your sister

1051
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,972
You were our trouble

1052
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:58,241
And now you're telling me it's all over

1053
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:04,611
And now we're telling you it's all over

1054
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:09,115
And now I'm telling you I ain't going

1055
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,749
It's all over

1056
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,350
I ain't going

1057
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:15,898
It's all over

1058
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:28,240
And I am telling you

1059
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,213
I'm not going

1060
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:38,384
You're the best man I'll ever know

1061
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:42,515
There's no way I can ever go

1062
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:45,253
No, no, there's no way

1063
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:50,958
No, no, no way I'm living without you

1064
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:55,127
I'm not living without you

1065
01:02:55,938 --> 01:03:00,398
I don't want to be free

1066
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:04,305
I'm staying, I'm staying

1067
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:07,176
And you, and you

1068
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:11,786
You're gonna love me

1069
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:20,084
You're gonna love me

1070
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:28,292
And I am telling you

1071
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:32,071
I'm not going

1072
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:36,202
Even though the rough times
are showing

1073
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:41,648
There's just no way, there's no way

1074
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,777
We're part of the same place

1075
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,022
We're part of the same time

1076
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,224
We both share the same blood

1077
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:57,229
We both have the same mind

1078
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:03,462
And time and time
We've had so much to share

1079
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:06,565
No, no, no, no, no, no way

1080
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,804
I'm not waking up tomorrow morning

1081
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:15,043
And finding that there's nobody there

1082
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,551
Darling, there's no way

1083
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:23,285
No, no, no, no way
I'm living without you

1084
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,156
I'm not living without you

1085
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:29,459
You see, there's just no way

1086
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:32,363
There's no way

1087
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:35,926
Please don't go away from me

1088
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:39,804
Stay with me, stay with me

1089
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,210
Stay, stay and hold me

1090
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:46,809
Stay, stay and hold me

1091
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:51,648
Please stay and hold me, Mister Man

1092
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:55,120
Try it, mister, try it, mister

1093
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,716
I know you can

1094
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,457
Tear down the mountain

1095
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:08,059
Yell, scream and shout
You can say what you want

1096
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,638
I'm not walking out

1097
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:13,900
Stop all the rivers
Push, strike and kill

1098
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,137
I'm not gonna leave you

1099
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:23,208
There's no way I will

1100
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:30,687
And I am telling you

1101
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:35,859
I'm not going

1102
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:40,061
You're the best man I'll ever know

1103
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:43,730
There's no way I could ever, ever go

1104
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,273
No, no, no, no way

1105
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,468
No, no, no, no way

1106
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:51,808
