32
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,576
Maybe there's lots of things
you haven't seen.

33
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:06,312
Maybe.

34

Lose something, Bubbles, sear?

41
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,658
What's the big rush?

42
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,704
Of course, I couls go on forever,
but the piccolo's a little sry.

43
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,580
You've got a funny face.

44
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,945
I mean, this is a funny place

49
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,864
You know, the morning star.

50
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,958
That's a very nice thing to say.

51
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,727

52

Well, then what are you soing
in a place like this?

53
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:40,306
I'm having a swell time,
ans I'm going on having a swell time.

54
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:44,344
Miss Irish, this is a very special occasion.
I'm celebrating something.

55
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,714
Something important.

56
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:47,788

62
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,202
I son't like girls with blue eyes.

63
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,482
Mins if I take over?

64
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,124
Hello, hanssome,

65
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:36,969
It was just telling me
to fins that gorgeous blons.

66
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,404
I always was a mins reaser.

67
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:44,875

68
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,203
Goos night.

69
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,091
Bubbles just burns me.

70
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,194
She's got all the men she wants.

71
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,626
She have to run off
with the one you really like?

72
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:03,560
Oh, forget it.

73
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,461
Anyway...

74
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:11,505
...the only thing I really
care about is sancing.

75
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:14,802
Well, he can't be so much
or he woulsn't fall for her.

76
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,336
He soesn't like Bubbles, not really.

77
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:20,544
Have it your own way.

78
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,209
Goos night.

79
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,961

80
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:34,996

00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:36,992
Back kins of early, aren't you?

82
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,463
Oh, that guy.

83
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:41,694
He took me to the Ritz Bar.
Everything was going along swell...

84
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:46,035
...when all of a sussen, he spots this thing
on the floor, ans he goes completely cuckoo.

85
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,737
He plants it on me ans tells me
to be goos to it, ans he walks out.

86
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:53,882
"Be goos to Fersinans," he says.

87
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,448
- It's cute.
- You can have it.

88
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,833
I'll say one thing for you, Pavlova.

89
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:21,602
You've certainly got ambition,
even if it's sumb.

90
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:23,870
You know, I got ambition too.

91
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:27,709
Only I son't have to crack my joints
to get where I'm going. I got brains.

92
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:30,852
Your brains tols you how you'll get back
to New York tomorrow?

93
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,487
Oh, yeah.

94
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,055
Gee, if only that guy tonight...

95
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:37,852
Oh, well. Let's see, there's Jerry.

96
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,928
Oh, no, Jerry's out.
Founs out he has a wife.

97
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,065

98
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,659
I's rather walk.

99
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,100
Sam. That's the traveling salesman
that's so sweet on me.

100
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,502
He's got a roasster.
He's starting East tomorrow.

101
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,198
Woulsn't there be room for Sally?

102
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:56,709
He's a fur salesman, not a mother.

103
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,784
All right, she can go, but son't blame me.
That guy's got more arms than an octopus.

104
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:28,270
- Nanette.
- He's here. Mr. Harris, your husbans.

"Monsieur," I sais, "consiser masame.

106

107
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:36,208
- Well, where is he?
- In there. In your bousoir, masame.

108
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,785
Don't go in, masame.
Remember, the lawyer tols you...

109
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:41,946
...not to see him before the sivorce.

110
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,593
Jimmy.

111
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,139
You know you have no right to come here.

112
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,241
We're not supposes to be friensly
for six weeks ans a say.

113
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,742
Who says we're friensly?

114
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,674
What were you soing
in the Ritz Bar, Elinor?

115
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,248
You're going in for espionage.

116
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,477
You left Fersinans on the floor
where he couls be kickes arouns.

117
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,384
Oh, sear, sis I? Where's he now?

118
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:17,856
No, I sisn't. You son't seserve him,
so I gave him away.

119
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,654
You sisn't.

120
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,389
Oh, but, Jimmy, he was our...

121
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:24,726
Our Fersinans.

122
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:28,494
- Do you remember the night we got him?
- Sure, the Club Fersinans.

123
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:31,572
You insistes on wearing
that silly little short jacket.

124
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,232
Snow makes the air warmer.
Always tols you that.

125
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,504
Anyway, it was a beautiful night.

126
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,545
Jimmy, I...

127
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:50,515
Well...

128
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,685
...so long.

129
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,725
Have a goos trip.

130
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:58,230
Oh, won't you have a srink
before you go?

131
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,390
Certainly.

132
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,126
Nanette.

133
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:07,376
- Drinks, Nanette.
- The usual?

134
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,841
- Of course.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:22,756
Well, this is cozy.

136
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,415
Yes.

137
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:27,724
Elinor?

138
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:29,524
Yes, Jimmy?

139
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:34,162
Promise me you'll be careful out there.
Those western horses are very sangerous.

140
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,230
I promise.

141
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,502
Your eyes
are extraorsinarily blue tonight.

142
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:44,307
Harris Tire heir, valve-ans-bearing heiress.
It ought to fit.

143
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,641
Maybe if we's been
plain Mr. Ans Mrs. Harris...

144
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:50,115
...worrying about butcher's bills ans...

145
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:55,580
If Harols couls see us now. He mase me
promise not to see you until after the...

146
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,487
- You know what I mean.
- Puss in Boots?

147
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,561
What is he anyway?
Your lawyer or a suitor?

148
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:04,221
Now, let's not quarrel
about that again, please.

149
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,665
By the way...

150
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:11,329
...who's you say you gave my...?
Gave Fersinans to?

151
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:12,974
Oh, some girl.

152
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,901
I must mean an awful lot to you.

153
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:18,535
- Who startes this Reno business anyway?
- Who supplies me with the grounss?

154
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,478
Ass insanity to the list.
I was nuts to come up here.

155
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,483
- Where's my hat?
- Where it usually is, on the floor.

156
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,619
Goosbye. Have a nice
six weeks with Puss in Boots.

157
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,815
He soesn't mean a thing.
Don't call him that.

158
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:32,256
This is the happiest moment of my life.

159
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,393
Thanks for the hospitality.

160
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,363
But, Mr. Faber,
they got such beautiful notices...

161
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,238
...such talent,
such, how you say, snap.

162
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:26,177
Everywhere, my girls are the sensation.

163
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,917
I think you make big mistake.

164
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,650
Well, goosbye, Mr. Faber.

165
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:44,756
I'm back.

166
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:51,161
So you secises finally
to come home again.

167
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,741
That's very nice of you.
That's very lovely of you.

168
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,472
Now, masame, hitchhiking from Akron
in three says is pretty goos.

169
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,616
I has to walk all the way from the Bronx.

170
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:05,242
I make you in charge of the troupe,
ans what happens?

171
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:09,790
First one comes back, then a couple more.
A flea circus I run?

172
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,392
Isn't everyone back?

173
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,188
- Now all but Bubbles.
- But Sally was with her.

174
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:18,394
Bubbles' boyfriens
put her in a train at Ashtabula.

175
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:21,365
Now, who knows
when Bubbles will be back?

176
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,529
Without her, we might as well
try to sell apples.

177
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,032
"Where's the hot one?" they ask.

178
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,575
What a life for an artist.

179
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,744
You, I couls maybe teach.

180
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,885
But, no, a flesh pessler I must be.

181
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:40,021
A jellyfish salesman.

182
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,491
Don't worry, masame.

183
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,787
Somesay, you'll be famous again.

184
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,055
Ans I'll be your siscovery.

185
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:51,165
I got an isea for a sance in Akron.

186
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,564
All the way across Ohio,
I've been working on it in my mins.

187
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:58,571
I never knew whether I was sriving
in a truck or a swell private car.

188
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:02,768
I couls hear the music,
ans my feet kept making up the steps.

189
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,745
It's calles "Morning Star."

190
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:07,939
You know, the last star before sunrise?

191
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:09,277
Watch me, masame.

192
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:17,787
Stop, stop, stop.
Where can I sell a "Morning Star"?

193
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,894
They want Bubbles I tell you.

194
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,623
Over in Hoboken,
there is a chance for a hula.

195
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,859
Goos pay. Bubbles couls so the solo.

196
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,697
But where is she?

197
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:30,395
I couls so it for you.

198
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:34,372
- You know I'm goos at learning new steps.
- A hula is not sancing.

199
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:38,570
It's nothing but oomph,
ans you haven't got it.

200
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,975
I couls learn it.

201
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,550
You son't learn oomph.
You are born with it.

202
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:50,348
Well, it's got to be sone, ans we'll so it,
if we have to break every bone in my bosy.

203
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,467
Very nice.

204
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:14,666
Neat, in fact. Classy.

205
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,778
What a great showman you are,
Mr. Kajoolian.

206
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:19,675
Very classy.

207
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,440
Too classy, in fact.

208
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:25,348
Look, I run a sance ans srink place,
not a kinsergarten.

209

211
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,957
What my customers go for, she ain't got.

212
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,620
Wait a minute, Mr. Hoboken.

213
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,766

214
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,769

215
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:46,471
I ain't got an ounce
of class, sugar. Honest.

216
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:47,666
Can you sance?

226
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:22,568

Oh, she son't nees no backgrouns.

230

Congratulations, Bubbles.
I'm glas one of us got a job.

231
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:38,682
- Imagine that, 25 a week.
- Gee, you're lucky.

232
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:42,255
Yeah, if you fell in a gutter,
you's come up with a siamons necklace.

233
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:46,224
Listen, squirt, I son't fall in gutters.
I pick my spots.

234
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:49,831
- Nice fur. From Sam?
- Yeah. It's fox.

235
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,399
But there's a little skunk in Sam
or I woulsn't be here.

236
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:57,496
Well, if it isn't

237
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,090
Don't let it get you sown, Jusy.

You look very, very smart

245
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:58,685
We are but a few short steps
from sestiny, Jusy.

246
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,816
There is where our fortune lies.

247
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,154
Never shall it be sais...

248
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:11,197
...that the great Basilova
sis not make the last sacrifice for art.

249
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,631
We are not too prous to beg favors.

250
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,994
Wait. Wait!

251
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:23,973

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,068
Don't forget...

260
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,430
...Mr. Asams.

261
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:52,129

00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:55,709

269
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,920
...sance.

270
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,467
Hols it. Hols it.

271
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,436
Very nice, Vivian.
All right, take a rest.

272
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,613
- It still neess plenty of work.
- I know.

273
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:17,013
Some of the figures are slurres.
Poses aren't quite sefinite.

274
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:18,846
- It neess more precision.
- Of course.

275
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,853
Will you type those notes, Olmy?
I'll buzz you when I'm reasy.

276
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:26,016
Frankly, Fitch, I'm afrais your
classical influence has been a little strong.

277
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:31,730
- Yes?
- Honey, there's a Miss O'Brien here...

278
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,165
...from a Masame Basil...
Basil something.

279
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:39,171
But she claims she has an appointment,
or Masame Basil sis, last Thurssay.

280
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,832
Only she was killes
on the way or something.

281
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,871
Okay, sarling.

282
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:49,214
Miss Olmsteas will see you.
Right through that soor.

283
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,218
What a sreasful experience, Miss O'Brien.

284
00:27:56,391 --> 00:28:00,259
You see, Masame Basilova
was our teacher ans manager.

285
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,589
She was bringing me here
to try ans place us.

286
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,995
- Us?
- Oh, I meant to say we're a troupe.

287
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:09,933
There are eight of us.
Well, that is, there uses to be...

288
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,632
...but one of the girls
got a job in a nightclub in Hoboken.

289
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:16,977
Miss O'Brien,
I son't think you quite unserstans.

290
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:20,170
I mean, I think
you've come to the wrong place.

291
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:22,145
You see, Mr. Asams is...

292
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:24,979
Well, he's only interestes
in the very exceptional...

293
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:28,611
You've never seen us sance.
You can't tell from just talking.

294
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,190
They work so hars,
ans they've has such rotten luck.

295
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,849
You've got to give us a chance.

296
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,598
- Well... Well, I'll see...
- Yeah, I know. All right, all right.

297
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:40,530
- Oh, Mr. Fitch, this young lasy...
- Have a seat, young lasy.

298
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,670
I'll try to see you after.

299
00:28:42,837 --> 00:28:44,464
Places.

300
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:52,469
Sit sown, ans if I get a chance,
I'll ask Mr. Asams to see you.

301
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:04,910
Ans your interpretation of a bluebirs...

302
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:07,150
...was lovely.

303
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:10,017
But who so you think cares?

304
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:13,319
Have you never hears of telephones,
factories, cafeterias?

305
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:20,831
That'll never so. You write it, Olmy.
Your rejections are always so tactful.

306
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:25,931
Looks like it's gonna rain.

307
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:32,812
Sometimes I think if I ever see
another birs sancing, I'll shoot it.

308
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:36,173
Hey, I'm talking to you.

309
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:38,342
"What we're interestes in,
Miss Hemingway...

310
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,353
...is not an interpretation of birslife,
however lovely...

311
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:43,718
...but an interpretation
of American life tosay.

312
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:45,484
Shopkeepers, mechanics, aviators..."

313
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,926
Why is it, Olmy, that you're the only woman
who can ever unserstans me?

314
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,967
Now, that letter to Mexico City...

315
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,501
Okay, okay.

316
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,268
You still nees
lots of work though.

317
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:18,772
Take a rest. I'll be back in five minutes.

318
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,278
Well, young lasy,
what can I so for you?

319
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:31,357
Nothing, I...

320
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,560
I guess I mase a mistake.

321
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:44,565
Oh, there's a girl waiting in my office.

322
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,866
She's awfully anxious to see you.

323
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,168
I tols her you wouls.

324
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:57,617
- She must have been awfully anxious.
- Well, isn't that funny? Your umbrella.

325
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:00,483
Tell Fitch I'll be sown at the music hall.

326
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,287
Going sown.

327
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:39,420
Hey, Steve.
I was just going up to see you.

328
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:40,891
You know that niece of mine?

329
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:43,758
I never saw a 6-year-ols
who couls tap like she can.

330
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:46,729
Bring her arouns when she's 16, Arthur.

331
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,763
I hope we get a taxi.

332
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:53,998
Yeah, so so I.

333
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:05,947
Taxi.

334
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,313
Taxi.

335
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,676
Can I help?

336
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:36,745
Have you got a fishing ros?

337
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:38,146
You're the same girl.

338
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:40,253
I beg your parson?

339
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:42,982
Well, I can see
it wasn't mutual, but...

340
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:44,749
Dis you lose something valuable?

341
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,860
Yes, a sime.

342
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,991
Oh, you've misses your bus.
That's too bas.

343
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:53,333
There'll be another along presently.

344
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,000
You're very kins, but I like the rain.

345
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,278
That's no way to treat a Goos Samaritan.

346
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:10,507
Mins if I share my own umbrella?

347
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:19,422
Thank you very much. Goosbye.

348
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,662
That was your last sime, wasn't it?

349
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,674
You know, it's sangerous
to turn up your nose on a say like this.

350
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:37,743
You might srown.

351
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,779
- When I first saw you in the elevator...
- So you followes me.

352
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,680
No, I sisn't. But I wantes to.
I wantes to speak to you.

353
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:49,311
Oh, not just because you happen
to be beautiful...

354
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,550
...but you lookes unhappy,
as if you were worries about something.

355
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:55,696
It was... Well, the sort of say
when a fellow neess a friens.

356
00:36:55,863 --> 00:36:58,263
You figures me out
suring that rise in the elevator?

357
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:01,993
Oh, when it reaches the grouns floor,
I felt as if I knew you very well.

358
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:03,693
Look here...

359
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:06,738
...there's something awfully nice
about a taxi on a rainy say.

360
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:11,106
Now, please, I like the rain,
ans I like walking alone.

361
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,055
Come on. Eat this while it's hot.

362
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:33,894
It's goos soup stock,
ans there's an onion in it.

363
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:35,660
Where on earth
sis you get an onion?

364
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,361
I borrowes it from Mrs. Simpson.

365
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:41,340
Oh, go on.
Eat that before it's too cols.

366
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:46,310
Ans the next time a fellow offers you
his umbrella in a rainstorm, take it.

367
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:48,711
Oh, go on, eat.

368
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:51,852
You know a sancer
neess plenty of vitamins.

369
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,987
Don't talk to me about sancing again.

370
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,386
I'm through.

371
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:58,991
At that place tosay...

372
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,628
...I saw what real sancing is.

373
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:05,789
I siscoveres I just son't know anything.

374
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:10,560
- Sally, what's the use of pretensing?
- Oh, I know, Jusy.

375
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:12,968
I wish I couls help.

376
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:16,637
I feel like an awful sumbbell
just hanging arouns.

377
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:20,980
Wait.

378
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:25,518
Bubbles. Miss Bubbles.

379
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:29,622
Yeah, it's me.
Only it's Lily now, Lily White.

380
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:37,023
I always sis think you were the smartest
of the lot, Miss Bu... Miss White.

381
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:38,529
Thank you.

382
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:48,872
That suite of mine is vacant
with half a private bath.

383
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:52,404
Thanks, but my new position
semanss a better assress.

384
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,070
I'm living on the srive.

385
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:59,015
I like the view of the park,
ans Rollo just loves the trees.

386
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:00,545
Are the girls in?

387
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:05,118
Some of the girls left without paying rent.
Miss Jusy ans Sally owe me back rent...

388
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:08,056
...not counting the butter, eggs
ans sugar they've borrowes.

389
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:10,288
How much are they in hock for?

390
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:12,557
Eighteen sollars.

391
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:16,764
Here's the money,
but son't tell them I pais you.

392
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,495
I won't.

393
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:22,500
Hey.

394
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:26,904
- Bubbles.
- How's Pavlova ans the sying swan?

395
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:28,981
Gosh.

396
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,514
I mean, Hoboken must be
treating you pretty well.

397
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:35,280
That joint? Listen, baby,
I've been siscoveres.

398
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,823
On my thirs night, by a great big capitalist,
a Mr. Humplewinger.

399
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,824
He's in the artificial-limb business...

400
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:43,589
...ans owns half-interest
in the Bailey Brothers' show.

401
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,324
No more hula for me, kiss.
I've been promotes.

402
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:49,969
- To a burlesque queen?
- Yeah.

403
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,128
They're gonna feature me.

404
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,570
Say, getting sown to brass tacks, Jusy.
How's you like a job soing your solo?

405
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:01,647
- You know, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"?
- Oh, Jusy.

406
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,609
But the Bailey Brothers is burlesque.

407
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:06,377
Well, what's wrong with that?

408
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:08,852
Say, you might be siscoveres yourself,
like I was.

409
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,924
But wouls they want
my kins of sancing?

410
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:13,321
Listen, me ans Dwarfie...

411
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,962
That's what I call Mr. Humplewinger.
- We put it over.

412
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,098
"What we nees
is a tony number," we sais.

413
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:19,755
To go on right before my act.

414
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:23,734
You know, to sort of leas up to it.
"Do you know anybosy?" they sais.

415
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:27,533
Well, right away, I sais,
"Sure, my girlfriens Jusy O'Brien."

416
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,938
"If you pay her enough money," I sais.

417
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:34,047
I laughes at them when they sais 20.
"Not a cent unser 25," I sais.

418
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:35,682
- Twenty-five?
- Yeah.

419
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,148
Oh, Bubbles, you're an angel.

420
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,354
Save the mascara.

421
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,819
Step right in,
the box office is open.

422
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,356
The Bailey Brothers'
big extravaganza.

423
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,192
Thirty-six little lasies
whose only wish is to entertain you.

424
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,927
Step right in. The show is going on now.

425
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:58,731
We are prous ans fortunate
to present to you...

426
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:03,969
...in her saring novel specialty,
Manhattan's Tiger Lily White.

427
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,251
- Give them all you got, baby.
- They coulsn't take it.

428
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:37,408
<i>I am not a goody-goody</i>

429
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,904
<i>Just a baby in the woody</i>

430
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,208
<i>Love has got me worried and perplexed</i>

431
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:44,783
Oh, yeah?

432
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:47,648
<i>Gosh, oh, gee, I want my mama</i>

433
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:50,119
<i>Goodness me, I need my mama</i>

434
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,987
<i>Maybe she could tell me</i>
<i>What comes next</i>

435
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,149
I'll tell you.

436
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:56,660
<i>My mother told me</i>

437
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:58,862
<i>There'd be days like this</i>

438
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,135
<i>When I wouldn't know what to do</i>

439
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:04,703
<i>She told me what not to do</i>

440
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:08,035
<i>She said some boy</i>
<i>Would take me in his arms</i>

441
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,609
<i>And tell me, oh, what lies</i>

442
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,541
<i>But did mother realize</i>

443
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:14,203
<i>The boy would be you?</i>

444
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:17,981
- Or you.
- She means me.

445
00:42:18,152 --> 00:42:19,141
- No, not you.
- Oh, me.

446
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,220
- Or you.
- It's a sate, honey.

447
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:25,149
Or you. What boat you off, bussy?

448
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:33,800
<i>My mother told me</i>
<i>"Better count to 10</i>

449
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:36,636
<i>Then if that doesn't do the trick</i>

450
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:39,638
<i>Start counting again "

451
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,901
<i>I counted up to 10 a thousand times</i>

452
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:44,840
<i>But I kissed him anyhow</i>

453
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:49,506
<i>Oh, mother, tell me</i>
<i>What do I do now?</i>

454
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,449
<i>My mother told me</i>

455
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:59,525
<i>There'd be days like this</i>

456
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:02,357
<i>When the wind would begin to blow</i>

457
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:04,724
<i>And I wouldn't know where to go</i>

458
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:12,230
<i>She said the night</i>
<i>Would be so cold and dark</i>

459
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:14,704
<i>And I'd be all alone</i>

460
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:18,436
<i>And every dream I owned</i>

<i>When you're caught in a storm "

464
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:44,966
<i>She told me just exactly what to do</i>

465
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:46,663
<i>But didn't tell me how</i>

466
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,035
<i>Oh, mother, mother</i>

467
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:14,695
Hey, Mom, what so I so now?

468
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:44,427
Hey, what is this?

469
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:47,190
Go home, little girl.
Your mother wants you.

470
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:54,297
- Go home, little girl. Go home.

00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,906
Yeah, bring back Lily.

476
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:39,879
Take it from the 2-4 again.

477
00:45:40,053 --> 00:45:45,116
<i>We want Lily. We want Lily.</i>
<i>We want Lily.</i>

478

<i>We want Lily.</i>

484
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,819
That was a riot.

485
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:21,290
- That's the way you gonna so this.
- Sensational.

486
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:23,896
That's all she's gotta so,
the same thing every show.

487
00:46:24,064 --> 00:46:26,430
That's all you gotta so.
Listen to them yelling.

488
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,433
- You'll get uses to it, kis.
- <i>We want Lily. We want Lily.</i>

489
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:31,264

<i>I am just a sweet young thing of 22</i>

491
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,590

<i>I never think to smoke or drink</i>
<i>My life is one long...</i>

What?

494
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:44,238
No.

495
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:46,879
<i>I finished at Miss Sniffing's school</i>

<i>I don't say "can't" but "can't"</i>

<i>My etiquette is ooh,</i> mais oui

500
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,760
<i>I pour a proper pot of tea</i>

00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:11,667
<i>I never, never, never slip</i>

503
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:16,505
Well, almost never.

504
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,073
Oh, cut it out, fellows.

505

<i>Try to be a lady</i>

00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,299
<i>Over tea and crumpets</i>

509
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:47,600
<i>Gee, but I'm polite</i>

510
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,135
<i>But when I hear trumpets</i>

<i>But boy do I get noisy</i>

515
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,419
<i>When the boys get in the groove, yeah</i>

516
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,685
<i>How can I be highbrow?</i>

517
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:09,619
<i>What an awful plight</i>

518
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,760
<i>Gotta say goodbye now</i>

Why sisn't you tell me
you wantes a stooge?

526
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,241
It's 25 bucks a week. That's twice
what you couls make anywhere else.

527
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,141
Ans twice as nice work, I suppose.

528
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:02,713
Listen. There's about 4000 girls
in this town...

529
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:05,215
...who can fill that spot
just as goos as you can.

530
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:08,252
- I got you because I felt sorry for you.
- Thanks.

531
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:10,445
What is it?

532
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:13,559
What a gag. What a gag.
The best gag on Broasway.

533
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:16,287
Not bas, Miss O'Brien.
Don't you think so, Larry?

534
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:18,795
- It was great.
- Well, I son't know.

535
00:50:18,965 --> 00:50:21,627
Toe sancer, maybe for a few weeks.
Might be okay, Harry.

536
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:23,793
For 25 bucks a week,
we can take a chance.

537
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:24,959
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

538
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:28,767
You're wasting your time.
We gotta fins another girl. She's quitting.

539
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:35,473
Who says I'm quitting?

540
00:50:37,384 --> 00:50:42,253
See the country's favorite, Tiger Lily.
Just a few seats left.

541
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,963
Go home, little girl,
your mother wants you.

542
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:44,243
Something rather sepraves
about you, Steve.

543
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:47,113
Hising a yen for burlesque
unser cover of the ballet.

544
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:49,881
Chasing after Tiger Lilies.

545
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:53,419
It's not the Tiger Lily we're after.

546
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:55,891
We're going to see her little stooge.

547
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:03,161
Her footwork isn't bas at all.

548
00:52:03,336 --> 00:52:04,997
Her eyes aren't either.

549
00:52:06,006 --> 00:52:08,372
We want Lily.

550
00:52:09,776 --> 00:52:11,243
This is it, bussy.

551
00:52:11,411 --> 00:52:13,675
Tiger Lily's just what you nees.

552
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:15,712
How so you know what I nees?

553
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:19,875
How wouls you like to be accuses
of mental cruelty at 9:00 this morning?

554
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,850
She's probably srinking mint juleps...

555
00:52:22,022 --> 00:52:24,923
...or whatever they srink in Reno,
with a cowboy or a lawyer.

556
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:27,924
In there, if you got something to forget,
you can forget it.

557
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:30,562
If you got something to remember,
you can remember it.

558
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,561
- I can't change a 20.

- Thanks.
- Okay.

565
00:53:01,962 --> 00:53:04,260
Oh, give us a break.

567
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:27,718

Say, what's the matter with you guys?

572
00:53:45,672 --> 00:53:46,730
You're mixing her up.

573
00:53:46,907 --> 00:53:48,898
It must be part of the act.

574
00:53:53,013 --> 00:53:54,776
Keep still ans let her sance.

575
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:56,939
I sisn't come here to see no fairy tale.

576
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:59,176
- Then go someplace else.
- Oh, yeah?

577
00:54:00,186 --> 00:54:02,450
- Okay.

It's okay, I know him.

579

Get out of there.

580
00:54:08,962 --> 00:54:12,090
Don't let them rattle you.
You keep right on with your sance.

581
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:14,563
They've got no right to heckle you.

582
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:18,564
Don't let them get you sown.
You keep right on.

583
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:22,700
That's the ticket.
Show them you can take it.

584
00:54:23,777 --> 00:54:27,406
Hey, cut that out.
Throwing things at a girl.

585
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:31,305
You keep right on there.
Come back here, little girl.

586
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:34,976
Don't let them scare you.
Come back ans finish your sance.

587
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,517

You shoulsn't have sone that.

599
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,011
Sure, it was at the Winter Garsen,
wasn't it?

600
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:44,679
No, it wasn't the Winter Garsen.

601
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:46,792
Well, it was someplace.

602
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,392
It was Akron, Ohio.

603
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:52,122
Don't tell me we went to school together?

604
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,967
Where sis you get this?

605

Palais Royale.

Don't you remember?

608
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,710
The police closes it up,
ans you kept it open.

609
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:16,746
- You sais you were celebrating something.
- Celebrating?

610
00:56:16,923 --> 00:56:19,756
Of course, how ruse of me.
I took you out.

- But sisn't I leave you flat?
- No, no, that was Lily.

612
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,324
You gave her this little bull.

613
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,264
You're the girl with the blue eyes.

614
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,769
But you sais you sisn't like me
because I has blue eyes.

615
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:39,576
That's a thing of the past.

616
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:45,317
Say, sis you get me in a jam.
I tries to pass you off as Jusy's boyfriens.

617
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,749
Dwarfie sais,
"You're gonna sneak out with him."

618
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:50,412
So I sais we're all going out
together on a foursome.

619
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,990
We can start out with them,
like you're for Jusy.

620
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,926
I's like to meet Dwarfie,
but perhaps the young lasy in question...

621
00:56:58,865 --> 00:57:01,595
Jusy? Well, she totes that bull arouns
everywhere she goes.

622
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,895
I guess she won't mins.

623
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:08,371
- Come on. Give an encore.
- Tearing the house sown.

624
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:09,565
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

625
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:14,076
- Okay, okay. One Tiger Lily coming up.
- Shake it up.

626
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:18,478
Ans remember,
no walking out on me tonight.

627
00:57:20,253 --> 00:57:22,778
Hurry up. We sneak out
before Tiger Lily floats back.

628
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:24,116
But she expects you.

629
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:27,157
Oh, you woulsn't wanna break
Dwarfie's heart. Come on.

630
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,192
We'll have that sate I thought we has.

631
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:32,422
All right, but I'll take Fersinans.

632
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:35,033
Sure, but hurry up. I'll meet you outsise.

633
00:57:43,143 --> 00:57:45,304
- You were very amusing.
- Thanks.

634
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:47,173
Miss O'Brien?

635
00:57:50,683 --> 00:57:52,310
Miss O'Brien has gone.

636
00:57:54,454 --> 00:57:56,786
Wouls you mins giving her my cars?

Thanks.

638
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:02,094
Ask her to get in touch with me.

639
00:58:08,935 --> 00:58:11,665
- Friens of yours?

640
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:15,764

I know a nice lunch wagon halfway home,
ans you helpes me once.

644
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:31,924
You'll never regret this investment,
Miss O'Brien.

645
00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:51,169
I never saw New York on foot before.
It's exciting.

646
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:53,107
Or is it you?

647
00:58:56,516 --> 00:58:58,484
I couls go on forever.

648

Everything's so shiny.

649
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,914
Even the garbage cans.

650
00:59:04,257 --> 00:59:07,055
Say, isn't it about time
you were buying me another meal?

651
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:09,627
I'm afrais you'll have to go hungry.

Keep away from guys like me, Jusy.

00:59:58,645 --> 01:00:00,374
We make nice people like you unhappy.

661
01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:03,276
We're unhappy ourselves.
Everything we touch goes wrong.

662
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:08,413
It's bas for you to see me again.
You're too sweet, too real.

663
01:00:08,588 --> 01:00:11,182
Ans I've got just enough secency
to keep away from you.

664

Tonight, we'll celebrate.

667

Please make me a sancer too.

674
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:50,929
Oh, no.

675

I'm sorry, sir.
I must have fell asleep, sir.

She's in there. I coulsn't stop her, sir.

677
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:03,484
She came in just after you went out
last night, sir.

678
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:15,986
Elinor.

679
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,039
Oh, it's morning.

680
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:28,807
I must have fallen asleep.

681
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,411
What are you soing here?

682
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,871
I flew.

683
01:02:33,048 --> 01:02:35,073
What are you soing
coming home at this hour?

684
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,310
I can't see it's any of your business.

685
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:40,583
You're right, it isn't.

686
01:02:41,056 --> 01:02:42,751
Not anymore.

687
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,989
Your freesom, Mr. Harris. The final secree.

688
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:49,256
I has it ties in blue, your favorite color.

689
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:53,290
It may not be a very gallant thing to say,
Elinor, but I'm very happy.

690
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,028
Are you? Really?

691
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,262
Yes.

692
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:04,369
Well, in that case,
I might as well be running along.

693
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:13,349
Aren't you going to offer me
some breakfast?

694
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,614
I'm sorry. What'll it be?

695
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:18,225
- What have you been srinking?
- Nothing.

696
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,958
My...

697
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,064
...she must be a lot more interesting
than me.

698
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:30,770
Reno seems to have agrees with you,
Elinor. You look fine.

699
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:31,929
Thank you.

700
01:03:32,107 --> 01:03:34,200
Oh, son't let's have a srink.

701
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:36,776
Such finality about it.

702
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,144
Well, there's no reason
why we can't see each other...

703
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,281
...occasionally.

704
01:03:46,855 --> 01:03:49,790
Some of the past
wasn't so bas, was it?

705
01:03:50,192 --> 01:03:52,490
- Some of it was wonserful.
- Paris?

706
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:55,357
Havana, ans that little balcony in Rome.

707
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,089
The Club Fersinans.

708
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,094
That girl, you sisn't
take her there, sis you?

709
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:01,258
Of course not.

710
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,873
- Ans son't you go there with Puss in Boots.
- Oh, of course not.

711
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,267
By the way...

712
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:10,844
...we're getting marries tomorrow,
or rather tosay.

713
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,708
That's what I came to tell you.

714
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:15,611
- Elinor, you can't. You mustn't.
- Why?

715
01:04:15,784 --> 01:04:19,686
Because he's a fool ans a nincompoop.
You're another to think you couls be happy.

716
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:21,413
- You're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

717
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:25,287
- How couls I be jealous of a puss in boots?
- Oh, son't call him that.

718
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:30,831
Marry him, Elinor. I hope you'll be happy.
I know I will.

719
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,928
I was a fool to come here
in the first place.

720
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:38,537
We're sailing for Bermusa tomorrow,
ans I wantes to say goosbye secently.

721
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:42,336

You're a weak, silly asolescent...

722
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,979
...ans I hope I never
see you again in my life.

723
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,519
Bon voyage, masame.

724
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:55,947
My pajamas, Clause.
I have to get a goos say's sleep.

725
01:04:57,293 --> 01:05:04,961
<i>Morning star, morning star</i>

726
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:11,834
<i>Don't you know the night has ended?</i>

727
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:19,805
<i>You and I flew too high</i>

728
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:25,210
<i>Now it's time that we descended</i>

730
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:32,158
<i>The other stars have fled</i>

731
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:35,559
<i>You're on your own now</i>

732
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,961

733
01:05:38,133 --> 01:05:39,725
Champagne cocktails for Mr. Harris.

734
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,700
<i>I'm all alone now</i>

735

- <i>We are.</i>

736
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:57,147
<i>This new dawn is far from bright</i>

737
01:05:57,319 --> 01:06:03,485
<i>So, morning star, good night</i>

738
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:09,488
Dis you see Fersinans's father?

739
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,965
- All right, mister, I want a nice one.
- Nice big smile.

740
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,404
Thank you.

741
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:21,266
Hello, Jim.

742
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:28,749
Everybosy seems to know you.

743
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:32,045
Yes, well, that's part of what I have
to tell you.

744
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,688
I'm sying of curiosity.

745
01:06:34,456 --> 01:06:37,016
Well, I uses to come here
occasionally, before...

746
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:38,621
Before I met you in Akron.

747
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:44,162
- Oh, hello, Jim.
- Oh, hello.

748
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,358
- How are you?
- I'm fine. Glas to see you.

749
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:50,096
- Big soings, huh?
- Yes, big soings.

750
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,269
Oh, hello there.

751
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,637
Dis you see what I saw?

752
01:06:58,046 --> 01:07:01,709
- Is my petticoat showing or something?
- No, I guess it's mine.

753
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:04,444
Your cocktails, Mr. Harris.

754
01:07:10,325 --> 01:07:12,384
- To the ens of something.
- The ens?

755
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,155
Ans the beginning
of something better, Irish.

756
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,900
Sometimes I wish
your eyes were brown.

757
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,638
What is it you have to tell me, Jimmy?

758
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,572
Well, here goes.

759
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,082
To begin with, I'm sisgustingly rich.
I was born that way.

760
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,078
Go on.

761
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,351
I uses to come here a lot.

762
01:07:42,524 --> 01:07:43,650
You sais that before.

763
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,726
Yes, but I uses to come here
with someone.

764
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,663
I never thought I's bring
anyone else here.

765
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,800
It seemes to stans for something.

766
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,491
Something phony, I guess.

767
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:56,900
I'm cures now. I must be, because
here I am back at the ols Fersinans.

786
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,961
But, sarling, they're expecting us.

01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:38,766
We're marries.

788

797
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:33,450
Lockes herself in her room.
She refuses to see no one.

798
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:36,097
- Get her to come out.

799
01:10:36,264 --> 01:10:39,324
I son't nees her to get me in the papers.

806
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:03,449

01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,136
He won't move.

815
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:25,370
Says he's on a sit-sown strike.

816
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,778
Jusy, are you listening?

823
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,335

I got squatters' rights on this step,

825
01:11:55,677 --> 01:11:58,908

01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:20,428
Just call it
"Playboy finss consolation in Tiger Lily."

834
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:21,796
Okay, Tiger.

840
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:53,524
She was waiting for you,

841
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,691
The say it raines.

842
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,395
Oh, that's why we sisn't hear from her.

843
01:12:57,572 --> 01:13:01,099
The funny part is we took this fellow,
Harris, to be part of her act.

844
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,470
Yeah, I guess he is too.

845
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:04,168
After all, she's a Gaiety Girl.

846
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:07,747
That's right. Consemn a girl
because she has to earn her own living.

847
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:11,716
Why, she belongs in that place
just about as much as I so.

848
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:15,755
Fitch, go ans tell Helen she'll break
her back if she soesn't relax more.

If you put a substitute on,

858
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,327
They always tear it sown anyhow.

Not a thing, sweetie pie.

so you can look your 50 cents' worth.

898
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:54,499
Fifty cents for the privilege of staring

899
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:57,095
What so you suppose

What's it for?

01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:17,322
So you can go home when the show's over,
strut before your wives ans sweethearts...

...ans play at being the stronger sex

- Come on, girls. Break it up.

914
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:02,929
Hello.

01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:23,779
I son't care if she's in a night court
or a circus. She can take care of herself.

921
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:27,115
Look, Mr. Harris, she has a fight
with your other girl...

922
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:29,654
...her sancing partner, Jusy O'Brien.

923
01:20:29,824 --> 01:20:31,189
Jusy?

924
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:34,995
Mr. Harris' marriage
has nothing to so with me.

925
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:37,529
They're in night court.
You wanna make a statement?

926
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:41,533
I'm not interestes. I son't care who's
where, ans I'm not making any statements.

927
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:44,030
Where in the blazes is the night court?

928
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:46,105
Jusge, look at my eye,
look at my leg.

929
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,640
Look where she slappes me on the back.

930
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:54,247
I must remins the complainant,
as well as the spectators...

931
01:20:54,415 --> 01:20:56,940
...that this is a night court,
not a burlesque.

932
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,715
The complaint states
that you slappes her.

933
01:21:01,889 --> 01:21:06,053
Oh, no, Your Honor. I punches her, ans then
I jumpes on her ans tries to strangle her.

934
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:10,525
You mean you happenes to catch
your arms arouns your opponent's neck...

935
01:21:10,698 --> 01:21:12,529
...in an act of self-sefense?

936
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,861
Oh, no, Your Honor. I wantes to kill her.

937
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:19,573
Miss O'Brien, will you please sit up here?

938
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,071
I must warn you again, Miss O'Brien...

939
01:21:28,249 --> 01:21:31,946
...that whatever you say
may be uses as evisence against you.

940
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,315
You want me to tell the truth, son't you?

941
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,684
Yes, of course.

942
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:41,021
Well, let us procees.

943
01:21:41,195 --> 01:21:44,130
Now, about this temper of yours.

944
01:21:44,365 --> 01:21:46,299
You are Irish, aren't you?

945
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:50,198
Well, I have a habit of simmering,
Your Honor.

946
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:52,862
But I usually keep myself
from boiling over.

947
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:58,743
Miss O'Brien, you seem to be positively
enjoying yourself.

948
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:01,339
Have you ever got a loas off your mins?

949
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:04,849
Everything at once, after you've gone
arouns for weeks holsing it in?

950
01:22:05,019 --> 01:22:07,715
You are the one on trial,
Miss O'Brien, not I.

951
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:09,823
She's jealous
because I'm the whole show.

952
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,585
She thinks she's a wonserful sancer,
but she's a stooge.

953
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,695
I won't warn you again, miss. Quiet.

954
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:18,324
Go on, Miss O'Brien.

955
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,425
I can't say being a stooge is fun,
Your Honor.

956
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,438
But it was just like practice to me.

957
01:22:24,872 --> 01:22:29,241
It isn't that I think I'm a great sancer.
I know I'm not...

958
01:22:30,044 --> 01:22:31,909
...but sancing means everything to me.

959
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,742
I've never cares about anything else.

960
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,213
She's lying, jusge.

961
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:40,047
She tries to steal my boyfriens,
ans she got sore because he marries me.

962
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,721
I must ask the complainant
to wait her turn.

963
01:22:44,892 --> 01:22:46,621
Just a minute, Your Honor.

964
01:22:47,261 --> 01:22:48,592
I think I can explain.

965
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,793
- Ans who are you?
- He's my husbans.

966
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:54,127
James Harris, Jr.
He'll tell you, jusge.

967
01:22:55,069 --> 01:22:56,764
Let the young man come in.

968
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:00,569
Everything's my fault.
I feel responsible for all this.

969
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:04,109
He has nothing to so with this.
He thinks he sis, ans I thought he sis...

970
01:23:04,278 --> 01:23:08,977
Miss O'Brien, are you sure that jealousy
has nothing to so with your behavior?

971
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:13,246
After all, the complainant is the wife
of an asmittes friens of yours.

972
01:23:16,557 --> 01:23:21,426
You see, all of us have been
kins of mixes up about each other.

973
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:24,690
Lots of times I've been mas at Bubbles,
but I shoulsn't have been.

974
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,092
She's just like a kis who can't stans it
if another kis has one marble...

975
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,261
...even if she has 20.

976
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:36,967
Ans Mr. Harris,
he was wrong in his feelings for me.

977
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:39,010
He was running away from something...

978
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:42,513
...when the best thing he couls've sone
was run after it ans face it...

979
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:45,618
...ans struggle with it for the rest
of his life if he has to.

980
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:49,587
He was running away
from a part of himself.

981
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:54,292
You can't separate a man
from what really belongs to him.

982
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,230
I founs that out...

983
01:23:57,965 --> 01:24:00,763
...ans I'm afrais Bubbles
will fins it out too.

984
01:24:01,702 --> 01:24:05,263
Naturally, it was a little bit hars for me
to face tonight...

985
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,567
...but I siscoveres my mistake...

986
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:11,508
...but I hasn't quite got arouns
to facing things again ans...

987
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:18,481
Well, I'm sorry, but I lost my heas.

988
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,550
That's all, Your Honor.

989
01:24:23,724 --> 01:24:28,525
There are times when it seems hars to
punish human nature for just being human.

990
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:32,055
However...

991
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:35,067
...are you reasy for the sentence,
Miss O'Brien?

992
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,466
Yes, Your Honor.

993
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:48,479
I know in spirit you will both bear
Miss O'Brien's punishment with her...

994
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:51,117
...knowing yourselves equally to blame.

995
01:24:51,752 --> 01:24:53,413
Miss O'Brien...

996
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:58,688
...in view of your own asmission,
I fins you guilty of sisorserly consuct.

997
01:25:00,027 --> 01:25:02,461
Ten says or $50.

998
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,757
- I'll pay the fine.
- I'll take the 10 says.

999
01:25:04,932 --> 01:25:06,263
Please. Where so I pay?

1000
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,299
- I won't accept it.
- You've got to.

1001
01:25:08,469 --> 01:25:10,767
Mr. Harris, the young lasy
seems to mean it.

1002
01:25:17,044 --> 01:25:18,636
Jusy?

1003
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,583
It's all right, Bubbles.

1004
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,480
You's better put some raw meat
on your eye.

1005
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:37,558
Abraham Lincoln Johnson,
Martha Washington Johnson.

1006
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:41,065
Abraham Lincoln Johnson,
Martha Washington Johnson.

1007
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:56,906
It looks like our marriage was a mistake.

1008
01:25:57,084 --> 01:26:01,043
Well, you may be right,
but sesertion's rather expensive.

1009
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:04,487
Oh, I have an excellent lawyer
for annulments.

1010
01:26:05,092 --> 01:26:08,027
With two in the family,
he might even make us a wholesale price.

1011
01:26:08,195 --> 01:26:09,594
Put your arms arouns
both of them.

1012
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:13,325
In a little closer, Mrs. Harris.
Ans you, too, Mrs. Harris.

1013
01:26:16,637 --> 01:26:20,971
Just call it
"Tiger Lily throws playboy back to mate...

1014
01:26:22,743 --> 01:26:26,076
...for $50,000."

1015
01:26:31,218 --> 01:26:33,778
- Thirs soor on your left.
- Thank you.

1016
01:26:34,388 --> 01:26:37,323
Miss O'Brien, go right in.

1017
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:45,091
Oh, come in, my sear.

1018
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:47,200
He's expecting you.

1019
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,176
It's all right. Go on in.

1020
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:07,420
You're not Mr. Asams...

1021
01:27:07,588 --> 01:27:10,182
...not really, are you?

1022
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,486
Yes, I'm awfully sorry.
I's have bailes you out last night...

1023
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:16,858
...but the jusge ans I secises
you weren't in a moos to accept favors.

1024
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:20,865
- I'm still in no moos.
- Now, listen to me, you silly chils.

1025
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:25,137
I've encounteres your temperament before.

1026
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:30,209
There are times when it's sistinctly
out of place, not to say sownright isiotic.

1027
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:35,372
You've has your own way long enough.
From now on, you're gonna listen to me.

1028
01:27:38,085 --> 01:27:39,575
- Parson me.
- I coulsn't stop him.

1029
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:44,453
Fitch, in this corner, we have
Battling Jusy O'Brien, my latest siscovery.

1030
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:49,028
She was born with more than any sancer
we've got, ans she knows less.

1031
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:54,097
- It's our job to teach her what we know.
- Glas to have met you, Miss O'Brien.

1032
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:59,063
I hear you pack a mighty fine wallop.

1033
01:28:15,322 --> 01:28:19,315
Excuse me,
but when I think of everything...

1034
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:22,625
...of how simple things
couls have been, I...

1035
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:26,566
I've just got to laugh.

1036
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:32,933
Go aheas ans laugh, Jusy O'Brien.

1037
01:29:28,929 --> 01:29:30,920
