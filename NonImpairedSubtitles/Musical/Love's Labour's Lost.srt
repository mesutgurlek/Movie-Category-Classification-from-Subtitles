00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,315
<i>(newsreader) September 1 939. Ominous</i>
<i>clouds of war gather over Europe.</i>

2
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,758
<i>But here in Navarre, the King, seen here</i>
<i>returning from military manoeuvres,...</i>

3
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,117
<i>..has announced an audacious plan</i>
<i>for himself and his court.</i>

4
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,309
<i>He and his companions will cast off their</i>
<i>military uniforms, while events allow,...</i>

5
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,109
<i>..and devote themselves to three years'</i>
<i>study. That's right - three years.</i>

6
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,992
<i>They'll sleep little, eat less, and devote</i>
<i>themselves instead to self-improvement:</i>

7
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,276
<i>..a real feast for bookworms.</i>

8
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,116
<i>Boldest is the King's insistence that no</i>
<i>women will be allowed inside the court.</i>

9
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,191
<i>Sorry, ladies, but he is the king.</i>

10
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,399
<i>There is just one exception: Madam</i>
<i>Holofernia, the King's principal tutor.</i>

11
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,235
<i>With Sir Nathaniel taking care of</i>
<i>the men's spiritual health,...</i>

12
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,951
<i>..they'll have all they need to distract</i>
<i>themselves from thoughts of romance.</i>

13
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,428
<i>Whoops! Careful, sir.</i>

14
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,231
<i>lt's a tall order, but this able monarch,</i>
<i>one of Europe's most eligible bachelors,..</i>

15
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,517
<i>..wants to show the world</i>
<i>there's more to life than warfare.</i>

16
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,991
<i>He's an idealist, but we wish him</i>
<i>and his three chums the best.</i>

17
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,276
<i>More news as the adventure unfolds,...</i>

18
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,353
<i>..but for now we wish them</i>
<i>bon voyage and good luck.</i>

19
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,351
You three,...

20
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,510
..Berowne,...

21
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,990
..Dumaine...

22
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,310
..and Longaville,...

23
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,030
..Have sworn for three years' term
to live with me,...

24
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,748
..My fellow-scholars,...

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,358
..and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this... schedule here.

26
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,798
Your oaths are passed,
and now subscribe your names,...

27
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,079
..That his own hand
may strike his honour down...

28
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,676
..That violates the smallest branch herein.

29
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,791
lf you are armed to do as sworn to do,...

30
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,712
..Subscribe to your deep oaths,...

31
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,834
..and keep it too.

32
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,118
l am resolved:

33
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,351
..'tis but a three years' fast.

34
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,198
The mind shall banquet...

35
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,311
..though the body pine.

36
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,635
To love, to wealth, to pomp,
l pine and die,...

37
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,111
..With all these living in philosophy.

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,151
So much, dear liege,
l have already sworn,...

39
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,073
..That is, to live and study
here three years.

40
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,154
But there are other strict observances:

41
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,109
..As not to see a woman in that term,...

42
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,390
..And one day in a week
to touch no food,...

43
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,108
..And but one meal on every day besides.

44
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,074
And then to sleep
but three hours in the night,...

45
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,470
..And not be seen to yawn of all the day.

46
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,119
<i>(laughs)</i>

47
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,273
O,...

48
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,910
..these are barren tasks, too hard to keep:

49
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,676
..Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

50
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,718
Your oath is passed
to pass away from these.

51
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,157
Let me say no, an if you please.
l only swore to study with your grace...

52
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,675
..And stay here in your court
for three years' space.

53
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,071
You swore to that, Berowne,
and to the rest.

54
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,312
By yea and nay, sir, then l swore in jest.

55
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,711
What is the end of study, let me know?

56
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,110
Why, that to know
which else we should not know.

57
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,237
Things hid and barred
from common sense?

58
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,550
Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.

59
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,555
As thus, to study where l well may dine,
When l to feast expressly am forbid;

60
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,678
..Or study where to meet
some mistress fine,...

61
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,229
..When mistresses
from common sense are hid.

62
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,630
These be the stops
that hinder study quite...

63
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,950
..And train our intellects to vain delight.

64
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,350
Why, all delights are vain!

65
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,309
### l've seen for days that you've got
some ways that must be checked

66
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,869
### ln you l never can detect

67
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,270
### The slightest sign of intellect

68
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,519
### You're mad on dances,
think of the chances you neglect

69
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,150
### You never seem inclined
to use your mind

70
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,236
### You're just a fella who
has got his brains in his dancing shoes

71
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,639
### Take a lesson from me

72
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,359
### l'd rather charleston

73
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,953
### Di-di do-do

74
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,679
### Think of what you might be

75
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,433
### l'd rather charleston

76
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,999
### Do-doop di-do

77
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,313
### l'm disappointed in you and your ways

78
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,108
### l'm double-jointed,
there's no sensation like syncopation

79
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,998
### Will you let me know why?

80
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,673
### l'd rather charleston

81
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,114
### Charleston?

82
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,956
### That's the sort of thing
l would never do, so

83
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,909
### Leave it behind and
give your mind to something new

84
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,277
### l'd rather charleston, charleston

85
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,909
### Charleston, charleston

86
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,991
### Charleston with you!

87
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,354
Well, sit you out.

88
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,160
Go home, Berowne: adieu.

89
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,995
No, my good lord,
l have sworn to stay with you.

90
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,553
But there are other strict observances:

91
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,633
''..That no woman
shall come within a mile of my court''?

92
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,110
- Hath this been proclaimed?
- Four days ago.

93
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,793
Let's see the penalty.

94
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,315
''On pain of losing her tongue''!

95
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,120
- Who devised this penalty?
- Marry, that did l.

96
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,588
Sweet lord, and why?

97
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,070
To fright them hence
with the dread penalty.

98
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,151
A dangerous law against gentility.

99
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,109
''ltem. lf any man be seen to talk with
a woman within the term of three years,...

100
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,229
..he shall endure such public shame as
the rest of the court can possible devise.''

101
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,473
This article, my liege, yourself must break
For well you know...

102
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,633
..here comes in embassy the French
King's daughter with yourself to speak -

103
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,836
..A maid of grace and complete majesty -

104
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,755
..About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father.

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,036
Therefore this article is made in vain,...

106
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,669
..Or vainly comes
th'admired Princess hither.

107
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,148
<i>(all gasp)</i>

108
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,960
What say you, lords?
Why, this was quite forgot.

109
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,193
We must of force dispense with
this decree. She must lie here on mere...

110
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,668
..necessity.

111
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,471
Necessity will make us all forsworn
3,000 times within this three years' space;

112
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,314
..For every man with his affects is born,...

113
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,519
..Not by might mastered,
but by special grace.

114
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,470
lf l break faith, this word shall speak for
me: l am forsworn ''on mere necessity''.

115
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,679
So to the laws at large l write my name,...

116
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,754
..And he that breaks them
in the least degree...

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,676
..Stands in attainder of eternal shame.

118
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,037
Suggestions are to others as to me;

119
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,637
..But l believe, although l seem so loath,...

120
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,472
..l am the last...

121
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,518
..that will last break...

122
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,193
..his oath.

123
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,316
Good Boyet,
You are not ignorant all-telling fame...

124
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,030
..Doth noise abroad
Navarre hath made a vow,...

125
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,590
..Till painful study
shall outwear three years,...

126
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,400
..No woman may approach
his silent court.

127
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,279
Therefore to's
it seemeth a needful course,...

128
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,072
..Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure and in that behalf,...

129
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,348
..Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.

130
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,356
<i>(laughs)</i>

131
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,431
Tell him the daughter
of the King of France,...

132
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,558
..On serious business,
craving quick dispatch,...

133
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,076
..lmportunes personal conference
with his grace.

134
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,914
Proud of employment, willingly l go.

135
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,799
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.

136
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,198
Who are the votaries, my maids,...

137
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,715
..That are vow-fellows
with this virtuous Duke?

138
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,188
Lord Longaville is one.

139
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,670
- Know you the man?
- l know him, madam.

140
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,708
At a marriage feast
ln Normandy, saw l this Longaville.

141
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,269
- Who are the rest?
- The young Dumaine.

142
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,470
- l saw him at the Duke Alencon's once.
- <i>(giggling)</i>

143
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,712
Another of these students at that time
Was there with him,...

144
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,110
..if l have heard a truth.

145
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,191
Berowne they call him.

146
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,228
God bless my ladies! Are they all in love?

147
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,277
<i>(all giggle)</i>

148
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,988
- Here comes Boyet.
- What admittance, lord?

149
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,318
Navarre had notice of your fair approach,
And he and his competitors in oath...

150
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,154
..Were all addressed to meet you,
gentle lady, before l came.

151
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,433
Marry, thus much have l learned:

152
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,313
..He rather means to lodge you...
in the field.

153
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,552
Fair Princess,
welcome to the court of Navarre.

154
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,076
''Fair'' l give you back again,
and ''welcome'' l have not yet.

155
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,435
The roof of this court
is too high to be yours,...

156
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,399
..and welcome to the wide fields
too base to be mine.

157
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,917
You shall be welcome, madam,
to my court.

158
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,071
l will be welcome then.
Conduct me thither.

159
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,710
Hear me, dear lady:
l have sworn an oath.

160
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,793
Our Lady help my lord! He'll be forsworn.

161
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,598
Not for the world, by my will.

162
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,389
- Will shall break it; will, and nothing else.
- Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

163
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,029
Were my lord so,
his ignorance were wise.

164
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,716
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.

165
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,677
But pardon me, l am too sudden bold;
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.

166
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,876
Vouchsafe to read the purpose
of my coming...

167
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,671
- ..And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
- Madam, l will, if suddenly l may.

168
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,392
You will the sooner that l were away, for
you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.

169
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,673
Sir,...

170
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,751
..l pray you... a word.

171
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,791
What lady is that same?

172

<i>(Boyet)</i> The heir of Alencon,
Katherine her name.

175

Katherine.

176

l beseech you a word.
What is she in the green?

177
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,033
A woman sometimes,
if by daylight she's seen.

178
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,748
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?

179
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,872
- Her mother's, l have heard.
- God's blessing on your beard!

180
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,510
Good sir, be not offended.
She is an heir of Falconbridge.

181
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,193
Nay,...

182
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,951
..my choler is ended.

Not unlike, sir, that may be.

186
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,789
- What's her name in the cap?
- Rosaline, by good hap.

187

ls she wedded or no?

188

To her will sir, or so.

189
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,911
O, you are welcome, sir.

190

Adieu.

191
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,478
Farewell to me, sir,...

..and welcome to you.

193
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,353
Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of 100,000 crowns,...

194
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,993
..Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.

195
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,792
But say that he or we - as neither have -
Received that sum,...

196
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,713
..yet there remains unpaid
100,000 more.

197
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,474
You do the King my father
too much wrong...

198
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,790
..And wrong the reputation
of your name,...

199
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,192
..ln so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

200
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,475
l never heard of it.

201
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,359
lf you prove it, l'll repay it back
Or yield up Aquitaine.

202
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,477
We arrest your word.

203
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,915
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum.

204
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,195
Satisfy me so.

205

As honour, without breach of honour, may

Tomorrow shall we visit you again.

219

How needless was it then
To ask the question!

220
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,551
### l won't dance
Don't ask me

### And so what, l'm lovely

227

### But, oh, what you do to me

228

### l'm like an ocean wave
that's bumped on the shore

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,710
### l feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

230
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,115
### When you dance
you're charming and you're gentle

231
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,635
### Specially when you do the continental

232
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,076
### But this feeling isn't purely mental

233

### For heaven rest us
l'm not asbestos

234
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,715
### And that's why

235
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,916
### l won't dance
Why should l?

236
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,116
### l won't dance
How could l?

237
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,477
### l won't dance
<i>Merci beaucoup</i>

238
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,952
### l know that music
leads the way to romance

239
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,829
### So if l hold you in my arms

240
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,513

241

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,469
### lt's not that you're attractive

619
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,229
### But oooh
My heart grew active

620
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,192
### When you came in-

621
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,796
- Ah!
- ### ..to view

622
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,871
<i>(door opens)</i>

623
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,556
### l've got a crush on you, sweetie pie

624
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,278
### All the day and night-time
hear me sigh

625
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,196
### l never had the least notion

626
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,276
### That l could fall with so much emotion

627
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,794
### Could you coo

628
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,759
### Could you care

629
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,393
### For a country cottage we could share

630
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,792
### The world will pardon my mush

631
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,955
### Cos l've got a crush, my baby, on you

632
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:53,558
### The world will pardon my mush

633
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,113
### Cos l've got a crush, my baby

634
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,272
### My baby

635
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:08,356
### A crush, my baby, on you

636
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,878
<i>(both)</i> Ugh!

637
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,558
Dumaine,...

638
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,592
..thy love is far from charity,...

639
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,630
..You may look pale,
but l should blush, huh?

640
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,318
l know,
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.

641
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,074
Come, sir, you blush!

642
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,673
As his your case is such.

643
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,070
You chide at him,
offending twice as much.

644
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,278
l have been closely shrouded
in this bush,...

645
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,551
..And marked you both,
and for you both did blush.

646
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,475
l heard your guilty rhymes,
observed your fashion,...

647
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,555
..Saw sighs reek from you,
noted well your... passion.

648
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,914
What will Berowne say
when that he shall hear...

649
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,631
..Faith so infringed
which such zeal did swear?

650
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,429
How will he scorn,
how will he spend his wit!

651
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,389
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!

652
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,391
For all the wealth that ever l did see,...

653
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,108
..l would not have him
know so much by me.

654
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,790
Ah, good my liege,
l pray thee pardon me.

655
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,833
Whoa.

656
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,991
Ah!

657
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,791
Good heart, what grace
hast thou thus to reprove...

658
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,272
..These worms for loving,
that art most in love?

659
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,397
Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view?

660
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,471
Not you to me,...

661
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,231
..but l betrayed by you;

662
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,239
..l that am honest,...

663
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,430
..l that hold it sin...

664
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,309
..To break the vow l am engaged in -

665
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,119
..l am betrayed by keeping company
With men like you,...

666
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,715
..men of inconstancy.

667
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,796
When shall you see me
write a thing in rhyme?

668
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,435
Or groan for Joan?

669
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,516
When shall you hear that l
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,...

670
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:27,956
..A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb -

671
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,750
Soft! Whither away so fast?

672
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,428
God bless the King!

673
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,558
- <i>(King)</i> What present hast thou there?
- Some certain treason.

674
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,994
What makes treason here?

675
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,834
l beseech your grace
let this letter be read.

676
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,674
Our person misdoubts it;
'twas treason, he said.

677
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,876
- Berowne,...
- <i>(giggles nervously)</i>

678
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,234
..read it over.

679
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,518
- Where hadst thou it?
- Of Costard.

680
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,877
- Where hadst thou it?
- Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.

681
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,113
- Don Arbnar, Carbonara... the Don.
- <i>(wails hysterically)</i>

682
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,714
How now, what is in you?
Why dost thou tear it?

683
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,838
A toy, my liege, a toy.
Your grace need not fear it.

684
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,629
lt did move him to passion
and therefore let's hear it.

685
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,869
Ah-ah!

686
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,918
lt is Berowne's writing...
and here is his name.

687
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,869
Ah, you whoreson loggerhead,
you were born to do me shame.

688
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,236
Guilty, my lord, guilty:

689
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,112
..l confess,...

690
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,998
- ..l confess.
- What?

691
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,198
That you three fools lacked me fool
to make up the mess.

692
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,309
He, he and you - and you, my liege - and l
Are pick-purses in love...

693
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,993
..and we deserve to die.

694
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,708
O, dismiss this audience
and l shall tell you more.

695
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,514
- Now the number is even.
- True, true, we are four.

696
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,953
Will these turtles be gone?

697
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,316
Hence, sirs, away!

698
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,791
Walk aside the true folk
and let the traitors stay.

699
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,031
<i>(squeals with delight)</i>

700
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,551
<i>(rhythmically)</i>
Have at you then, affection's men-at-arms.

701
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,796
Consider what you first did swear unto:

702
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,555
..To fast, to study and to see no woman -

703
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,270
..Flat treason 'gainst
the kingly state of youth.

704
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,238
Say, can you fast?

705
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,995
Your stomachs are too young,
And abstinence engenders maladies.

706
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,549
For when would you, my liege,
or you, or you,...

707
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,268
..Have found the ground
of study's excellence...

708
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,076
..Without the beauty of a woman's face?

709
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,197
From women's eyes this doctrine l derive:

710
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,672
..They are the ground,
the books, the academes,...

711
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,310
..From whence doth spring
the true Promethean fire.

712
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,278
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,...

713
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,112
..And in that vow
we have forsworn our books;

714
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,669
..For when would you, my liege,
or you, or you,...

715
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,798
..ln leaden contemplation
have found out...

716
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,713
..Such fiery numbers
as the prompting eyes...

717
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,155
..Of beauty's tutors
have enriched you with?

718
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,756
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain,...

719
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,835
..And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;

720
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:39,916
..But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,...

721
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,639
..Lives not alone immured in the brain
But with the motion of all elements...

722
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,348
..Courses as swift
as thought in every power...

723
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,790
..And gives to every power
a double power,...

724
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,156
..Above their functions and their offices.

725
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,073
lt adds a precious seeing to the eye:

726
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,199
..A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.

727
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,716
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound.

728
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,555
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible...

729
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,793
..Than are the tender horns
of cockled snails.

730
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,828
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus
gross in taste,...

731
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:22,871
..For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?

732
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,113
Subtle as Sphinx, as sweet and musical...

733
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,558
..As bright Apollo's lute,
strung with his hair.

734
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,157
And when Love speaks,...

735
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,109
..the voice of all the gods...

736
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,114
..Make heaven drowsy...

737
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,191

Shall we...

00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,548
..resolve to woo these girls of France?

767
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,193
And win them too!

768
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,479
Therefore let us devise some
entertainment for them in their tents.

First, from the park
let us conduct them thither.

770
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,232
Then homeward every man
attach the hand of his fair mistress.

771
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,756
ln the afternoon we will
with some strange pastime solace them,...

772
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,150
..Such as the shortness
of the time can shape;

773

For all your fair endeavours, and entreat,..

..Out of a new-sad soul,
that you vouchsafe...

1005
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,431
..ln your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits,...

..lf over-boldly we have borne ourselves
ln the converse of breath.

Your gentleness
Was guilty of it.

1008

Farewell, worthy lord!
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.

1009
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,919
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
For your great suit so easily obtained.

1010
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,913
The extreme parts of time
extremely forms...

1011

..All causes to the purpose of his speed
And often at his very loose decides...

1012

..That which long process
could not arbitrate.

1013
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,949
Though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love...

1014
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,555
..The holy suit
which fain it would convince,...

1015
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,952
..yet, since love's argument
was first on foot,...

1016
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,590
..Let not the cloud of sorrow jostle it
From what it purposed.

1017
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:29,469
l understand you not.
My griefs are double.

1018
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,553
Honest plain words
best pierce the ear of grief;

1019
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,836
..And by these badges
understand the King.

1020
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,913
For your fair sakes
have we neglected time,...

1021
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,913
..Played foul play with our oaths.

1022
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,674
Your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deformed us,...

1023
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,037
..fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents;

1024
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:51,671
..And what in us hath seemed ridiculous.

1025
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,755
Those heavenly eyes that look into
those faults, suggested us to make them.

1026
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,276
Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours,...

1027
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,478
..the error that love makes
ls likewise yours.

1028
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:09,317
We have received your letters full of love,
Your favours, the ambassadors of love,...

1029
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,599
..And in our maiden counsel rated them
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,...

1030
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,558
..As bombast and as lining to the time.

1031
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,429
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been;

1032
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,312
..and therefore met your loves
ln their own fashion, like a merriment.

1033
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,030
- Our letters showed much more than jest.
- So did our looks.

1034
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,316
We did not quote them so.

1035
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,798
Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
Grant us your loves.

1036
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:46,876
A time, methinks, too short
To make a world-without-end bargain in.

1037
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,194
No, no, my lord,...

1038
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,670
..your grace is perjured much,...

1039
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,716
..Full of dear guiltiness;

1040
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,995
..and therefore this:

1041
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,836
..lf for my love, as there is no such cause,
You will do aught,...

1042
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,752
..this shall you do for me:

1043
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,833
..Your oath l will not trust,
but go with speed...

1044
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,355
..To some forlorn and naked hermitage.

1045
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:21,310
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.

1046
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:27,396
lf this austere insociable life change not
your offer made in heat of blood;

1047
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:34,074
..Then, at the expiration of the year,
Come challenge me,...

1048
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,631
..challenge me by these deserts,...

1049
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,112
..And, by this virgin palm
now kissing thine, l will be thine.

1050
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,636
And, till that instance, shut
My woeful self up in a mourning house,...

1051
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,237
..Raining the tears of lamentation
for the remembrance of my father's death.

1052
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,113
Hence, hermit then -

1053
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,348
..my heart... is in thy breast.

1054
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,071
What says Maria?

1055
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,550
At the twelvemonth's end...

1056
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,070
..l'll change my black gown
for a faithful friend.

1057
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,788
l'll stay with patience,...

1058
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,070
..but the time is long.

1059
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:47,116
A twelvemonth and a day l'll mark
no words that smooth-faced wooers say.

1060
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,435
Come when the King doth
to my lady come;

1061
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,670
..Then, if l have much love,...

1062

01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,837
..Full of comparisons
and wounding flouts,...

1075
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:52,234
..Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit.

1076
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,429
To weed this wormwood
from your fruitful brain...

1077
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,910
..And therewithal to win me,...

1078
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,513
..if you please -

1079
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,553
..Without the which l am not to be won -

1080
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,951
..You shall this twelvemonth term
from day to day...

1081
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,637
..Visit the speechless sick and
still converse with groaning wretches;

1082
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:21,113
..and your task shall be
With all the fierce endeavour of your wit...

1083
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,758
..To enforce the pained impotent to smile.

1084
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,074
To move wild laughter in the throat
of death? lt cannot be, it is impossible.

1085
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,072
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.

1086
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,993
Why, that's the way
to choke a gibing spirit,...

1087
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,708
..Whose influence is begot
of that loose grace...

1088
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,390
..Which shallow laughing hearers
give to fools.

1089
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:48,873
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it,...

1090
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,351
..never in the tongue
Of him that makes it.

1091
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,238
Then, if sickly ears,...

1092
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,199
..Deafed with the clamour
of their own dear groans,...

1093
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,752
..Will hear your idle scorns,
continue then,...

1094
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,629
..And l will have you and that fault withal;

1095
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,992
..But if they will not,
throw away that spirit,...

1096
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,630
..And l shall find you empty of that fault,...

1097
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,715
..Right joyful of your reformation.

1098
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,431
A twelvemonth?

1099
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,478
Well,...

1100
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,830
..befall what will befall,...

1101
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,397
..l'll jest a twelvemonth...

1102
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,870
..in an hospital.

1103
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:07,435
Ay, sweet my lord, and so l take my leave.

1104
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,558
No, madam,
we will bring you on your way.

1105
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,112
Our wooing doth not end like an old play:
Jack hath not Jill.

1106
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,875
Come, sir,
it wants a twelvemonth and a day,...

1107
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,951
..And then 'twill end.

1108
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,910
That's too long for a play.

1109
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,791
Sir.

1110
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:53,396
### Our romance
won't end on a sorrowful note

1111
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,036
### Though by tomorrow you're gone

1112
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:05,476
### The song is ended,
but as the songwriter wrote

1113
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,796
### The melody lingers on

1114
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:16,348
### They may take you from me

1115
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:21,198
### l'll miss your fond caress

1116
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,790
### But though they take you from me

1117
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,589
### l'll still possess

1118
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,440
### The way you wear your hat

1119
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,038
### The way you sip your tea

1120
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,909
### The memory of all that

1121
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:51,029
### No, no, they can't take that
away from me

1122
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:56,070
### The way your smile just beams

1123
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,950
### The way you sing off key

1124
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:05,398
### The way you haunt my dreams

1125
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:11,633
### No, no, they can't take that
away from me

1126
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,120
### We may never, never meet again

1127
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,558
### On the bumpy road to love

1128
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:28,956
### Still l'll always, always
keep the memory of

1129
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,071
### The way you hold your knife

1130
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,799
### The way we danced till three

1131
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,835
### The way you changed my life

1132
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:52,313
### No, no, they can't take that
away from me

### The way we danced till three

1139
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:17,028

<i>(Berowne) And when Love speaks,...</i>
