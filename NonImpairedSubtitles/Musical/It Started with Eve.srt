1
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,431
<i>Watch it! Wet print!
Copy.</i>

2
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,013
Ain't it pretty?

3
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,985
<i>Well, his inheritance tax oughta
make the country about even.</i>

4
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,490
<i>He was born too late.
200 years ago, he'd have been a pirate.
Captain Kidd himself.</i>

5
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,117
<i>Look at that stomach.
I watched him eat once
at a banquet.</i>

6
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,286
<i>He didn't order a steak,
he ordered a cow.</i>

7
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,422
You have to hand it to him.
He loved to live.

8
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,433
Yeah?

9
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,435
<i>Have you gone crazy?
Let's go to press.!</i>

10
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,494
<i>We've only got 18 minutes
to catch the mail trains.!</i>

11
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,369
I got the greatest first page here
since the Chicago fire!

12
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,535
Old man Reynolds is dyin'
and I'm gonna get the flash
he's dead any minute!

13
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,012
<i>Let him die
in the next edition.!
And let the Herald beat us?</i>

14
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,345
He's gonna die for me,
exclusive! He's mine!

15
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,317
<i>But the mail trains...
He dies for me, not the Herald.</i>

16
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:38,187
<i>But the advertisers...
Tell the advertisers to go
to the Herald.!</i>

17
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,125
What are you standin' around
with your face hangin' out for?

18
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,719
Gimme two columns on Reynolds'
son flying in from Mexico.
Right.

19
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,286
You know, lump-in-the-throat stuff.

20
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,334
"Only son flies to father's deathbed.
Will he make it? Won't he make it?"

21
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,801
Slobber all over the place,
but keep it classy!

22
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,397
And write it both ways,
if he makes it or if he doesn't.

23
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,466
As long as he has to go,
please have him go not later than 9:20.

24
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,674
<i>That dirty Herald's
been gettin' all the breaks.</i>

25
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,239
Yeah? What do you mean,
he isn't dead yet?

26
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,182
Frank, I gotta have some action!

27
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,686
What am I supposed to do,
hit him over the head?

28
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,246
I've been standing in a foot of water
and I caught a cold.

29
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,918
You've got a cold. Reynolds is dying!

30
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,120
At least he's doing it in a nice, warm bed.

31
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,824
<i>I got something. Two ravens
from the national museum...</i>

32
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,332
Are inside the house
waiting to take his death mask.

33
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,268
Seems you gotta do it right away.
No, I didn't get their names.

34
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,738
<i>Wait a minute.
Somebody's coming.</i>

35
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,401
It's a car!
Must be Reynolds' son.

36
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:34,913
How do I know?
'Cause he came up the wrong way
on a one-way street!

37
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,712
Frank, I'm warnin' you,
if Reynolds isn't dead within a half hour,
don't come back here!

38
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,221
Go ahead, threaten me!
I got pneumonia!

39
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,383
He's getting out of the car.
It's the Reynolds kid,
all right!

40
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,484
<i>He's goin'in the house.!
There he goes.</i>

41
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,694
Hello, Roberts.

42
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,995
It's good you got here
in time, sir.

43
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,244
Hello, Johnny.

44
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,303
How is he, Doctor?

45
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,509
Not so good.
There's a chance,
isn't there?

46
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,253
Isn't there?

47
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:20,258
He's had a rich, full life.
A man couldn't ask for more
than he's been given.

48
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,487
No, I guess not.

49
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,496
He'll be glad to see you.

50
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,499
He's been asking for you
all the time.

51
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,778
Hello, Dad.

52
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,092
I leave town for a month
and find you in bed.

53
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,924
Out in the rain
without your rubbers, eh?

54
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,124
Well, you look fine, Dad.
Just fine.

55
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,259
<i>You'll probably be
out ofhere in a week.</i>

56
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,430
Say, the fishing in Mexico,
there's nothing like it.

57
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,304
It's not really fishing,
it's kind of big-game hunting.

58
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,503
They have fish
with teeth and horns.

59
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,512
Throwback to the buffalo.

60
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,549
You go out in a boat
and fish charge at you.
And you...

61
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,586
<i>And you just gotta catch 'em
in self-defense.</i>

62
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,587
<i>You and I
and two machine guns...</i>

63
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,522
<i>are going down there fishing
next month.</i>

64
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,151
No more fishing for me,
Johnny.

65
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,695
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

66
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,493
Why, Dr. Harvey
says...

67
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,329
You all right, Dad?

68
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:42,165
Tell me about her.
About her?

69
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,802
The girl you're going
to marry.
Oh.

70
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,870
Oh, she's wonderful.
I met her at the Williams'.

71
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,576
An old Boston family.
Been in Mexico
a number of years.

72
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,585
We hit it off right away.

73
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,121
I wanted to marry her
the first week, but l...

74
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,953
I thought I'd let you see her first.

75
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,655
Why didn't you bring her?
Well, l... I dropped her
at the hotel.

76
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,664
We brought
her mother along too.

77
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:10,101
I thought you'd be resting.
The excitement.
I want to see her.

78
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,104
Yes, Dad.
First thing in the morning.

79
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,265
Now.

80
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,175
Bring her to me.

81
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,440
Just want to see her,
that's all.

82
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,210
You're going to get better, Dad.

83
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,376
Hurry, Johnny.

84
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:30,684
Go and get her.
Go and get her.

85
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,691
Sure, Dad.

86
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,194
Sure.

87
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,370
He looks awfully bad,
Doctor.

88
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,372
Better get the girl.

89
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,170
But hurry.
It may be a matter of minutes.
Yes.

90
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,248
My hat and coat,
Roberts.
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,528
Miss Pennington, please.
Miss Gloria Pennington.
Yes, sir.

92
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,723
Miss Gloria Pennington,
please.
1220, please.

93
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,232
Good evening,
Mr. Duncan.
Good evening.

94
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,325
Let me talk to her.
Did you order
this weather?

95
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,495
<i>It hasn't been ideal,
has it? Thank you.
No.</i>

96
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,766
I'm sorry, sir.
Miss Pennington
doesn't answer.

97
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,071
She doesn't answer?
When does the Broadway
Limited arrive, please?

98
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,077
Information desk
can tell you, madam.
Thank you.

99
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,306
Maybe she's
in her mother's room.
Would you try Mrs. Pennington?

100
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,542
Yes, of course.
Mrs. Pennington, please.
Thank you.

101
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,847
Please send this
and charge it to my room.
Straight wire or night letter?

102
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,320
Could you wait just a minute?
This call is awfully important.

103
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,790
This telegram is important too.
Send it straight wire.
Thank you.

104
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,919
Yes? I see.
Is she in?

105
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,986
<i>I'm sorry.
She doesn't answer either.</i>

106
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,864
I don't understand it.
I left them here just a minute ago.
Are their keys in the box?

107
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,062
No, but people sometimes
take them with them.

108
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,799
Would you like me to have
Miss Pennington paged?
Oh, yes. Would you, please?

109
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,807
I've got to find her.
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,809
Page
Miss Gloria Pennington.
Hurry, son, please.

111
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,812
Do you have Mr. John Simms
registered here?
Maybe if you call her again?

112
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,745
<i>Just a moment.
Paging Miss Pennington.!</i>

113
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,147
Just have a chair.
We'll do our best to find
Miss Pennington for you.

114
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,652
<i>Thank you.
I'm awfully sorry.
Miss Gloria Pennington.!</i>

115
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,390
<i>Paging Miss Pennington.!</i>

116
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,557
<i>Paging Miss Pennington.!</i>

117
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,790
<i>Miss Gloria Pennington.!</i>

118
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,230
<i>Paging Miss Pennington.!</i>

119
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,772
Check your coat, sir?
Yes? What is it?

120
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,304
Well, your coat, sir.
Oh, no, no. L... l...

121
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,556
<i>Don't you think
I'm right?
'Course you're right.</i>

122
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,353
Thirty-seven and 38.
Thirty-seven and 38.

123
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,359
What's the whole thing
amount to?
$40,000.

124
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,361
Well, say it's $50,000.

125
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,920
For a measly $50,000,
you'd expect me to give up
two weeks of my vacation?

126
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,933
The government gets half
of that anyway.

127
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,935
All you'd be getting
is $25,000...

128
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,937
and sitting in a hot office
for two weeks.

129
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,439
They must think
you're an idiot.

130
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,602
This must be a new
five-dollar coin.

131
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,374
Looks like the same old
dime to me, though.

132
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,678
<i>How's business?
They're dime-ing us
to death.</i>

133
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,777
Still raining?
Buckets.

134
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,846
Ahh! Is your tongue
supposed to be white?

135
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,858
Everybody's wearing it
this season.

136
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,520
I just figured out
why drug stores have
lunch counters.

137
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,996
They lose money on food,
but they make a big profit
on bicarbonate of soda.

138
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,033
Pardon me.

139
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,006
Did you find her?
No, sir.

140
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,838
You didn't?
Did you try everywhere?
The beauty shop too?

141
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,775
Yes, sir.
Isn't there someplace else
you can look?

142
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,679
We'll do the best we can, sir.
I'll call you the moment l...

143
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,224
<i>My dear, he's the handsomest
doctor I've ever had.
How marvelous.!</i>

144
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,158
He's simply priceless!
He found everything
the matter with me!

145
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,525
<i>How perfectly divine.!</i>

146
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,705
<i>Miss.!
I beg your pardon.</i>

147
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,707
Could you do me
a tremendous favor?
Huh?

148
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,709
I'm in a bad spot.
Could you help me?

149
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,541
I've got to have something.
No, I don't mean that!
Yes.

150
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,573
I've got to bring somebody home.
I'll give you $50 if you'll only come!
What?

151
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,915
I know this is improper
to talk to you, but...

152
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,649
My father's dying.
Can you help me?

153
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,624
You don't understand.
I work here.
I only have an hour off.

154
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,287
I'll have you back by then.
I'll explain it to you later.
Please, come. I'll give you anything!

155
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,491
Just get in the car here.
I'll help you with the umbrella.

156
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,071
<i>Here she is, Dad.</i>

157
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,906
This is my father.

158
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,974
Hello.

159
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,647
Can't see her.

160
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,747
Raise the lamp.

161
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,469
<i>Take off your hat.</i>

162
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,993
Pretty.

163
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,922
<i>Sit here, child.</i>

164
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,504
I had to see you.

165
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:56,173
I'd been worried
what kind of a girl he'd marry.

166
00:11:56,248 --> 00:12:00,582
He's... He's had so many wrong 'uns,

167
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,951
but I believe...

168
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,049
<i>he's picked the right one this time.</i>

169
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,856
<i>I think he'll make you happy.</i>

170
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,625
My... MyJohnny's a good boy.

171
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,634
He's a little weak, but honest.

172
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,966
Never told me a lie.

173
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,599
<i>L... I spoiled him, of course.</i>

174
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,041
<i>Don't you spoil him too.</i>

175
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:30,048
Keep an eye on him for me.

176
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,050
Won't you?

177
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,212
<i>You promise me?</i>

178
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,668
We've had some beautiful women
in our family.

179
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,934
You should have seen his mother.

180
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:59,444
<i>You're going to fit in just fine.</i>

181
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,550
My, you're pretty.

182
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:14,625
<i>Oh, don't cry, dear.
There's nothing to be sorry for.</i>

183
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,787
I had a good life.

184
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,355
I didn't miss anything.

185
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,961
And I've never been happier
than I am right now.

186
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,719
Please go now.

187
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,366
He seems
such a wonderful man.
Yes, he is.

188
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,637
You go along for years
and take someone for granted.

189
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,202
It never hits you
that maybe someday...

190
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,444
You can only think that
if you had it to do over again,

191
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,009
how much closer
you could have been.

192
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:19,683
It's a feeling everyone has.
No, I'm sure I could have
been a better son to him.

193
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,692
I'm so sorry.

194
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,354
There's a Miss Pennington
on the phone for you, sir.

195
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,364
Oh, excuse me.

196
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,303
- Hello, Gloria.
- Hello, John. Mother and I
were out buying clothes.

197
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,311
I'm sorry we had to pick
just the time you called.

198
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,313
My father wanted to see you.

199
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,214
No, no, don't bother.
It's a little too late.

200
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,411
John, is he...

201
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,455
Oh, thank heaven!
Don't you want us to come?

202
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,150
No, you try and rest.
I'll call you in the morning.

203
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,217
All right, darling.
Be brave. Good-bye.

204
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,229
He's sinking.

205
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,748
Oh, yes.

206
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,047
I want to thank you
for what you did for me.

207
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,886
That's all right.
I wish I knew
how to repay you.

208
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,026
Well...
Yes?

209
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:35,933
Nothing.
I'm glad I was able to help.

210
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,333
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

211
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,542
Miss!

212
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,704
I offered you money for this,
didn't I?

213
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,544
How much was it?
Well, you said $50.

214
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,881
You'll have to forgive me.
I'm not thinking
very clearly tonight.

215
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,683
I really shouldn't
take money for this.

216
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,950
It just happens I can use it.

217
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,959
I've been wanting
to go back home.

218
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,723
I haven't seen my folks
for two years.

219
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,460
Most of the money I make
goes for my lessons, and...

220
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,162
This'll do it.
I can get the first train
in the morning.

221
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,568
Where are you from?
Shelbyville, Ohio.

222
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,039
I see. It was a very nice thing
you did tonight.

223
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,475
I want to thank you again.
L... I appreciate this too.

224
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,479
Oh, that's all right.

225
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,470
Have you seen him?
What happened? How is he?

226
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,270
<i>I'm from the New York Press.
Is the old man... I mean, Mr. Reynolds...
dead yet?</i>

227
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,210
L... I don't think so.
I don't know. L...

228
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,213
What?

229
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,459
I'm hungry.

230
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,798
Why, Jonathan,
how do you feel?
Hungry.

231
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,842
Good morning, Dad.
Hello, Johnny.

232
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,173
Why, you look just fine.
I want
my breakfast.

233
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,213
Uh, nurse! Nurse!

234
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,646
Make a nice, thin slice
of white toast.

235
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,583
Put it in a bowl with
two inches of lukewarm milk.

236
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,416
<i>Are you feeding
the cat in here?
Now, Jonathan.</i>

237
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,820
I want a steak. And a cigar.

238
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,985
- Don't be hasty.
- Who's hasty? I'm hungry!

239
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,690
<i>- But you're a very sick man.
- Now, you just lie back and rest.</i>

240
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,029
In a minute, you're going to
have a bowl of nice, warm toastie.

241
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,661
I want some nice, hot steakie!

242
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,763
- You can have some
heavier foodsie later.
- Quack.

243
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,072
Where's Gloria?
She's still at the hote...

244
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,009
Oh.

245
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,913
L-l-I don't know...
where... where she...

246
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,644
Well, call her.
She can have breakfast with me.

247
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,016
Breakfast.
No, I don't think so.

248
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:14,151
She's had a pretty long, uh, journey.
She's, uh, probably still in the ba...

249
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,285
Get her on the phone.
I'll talk to her.

250
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:20,457
No, that's not necessary. I'll...
I'll, uh, get her while you're eating.

251
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:26,462
Or maybe you'd rather
see her later.

252
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,634
<i>I want to see her now.
Want to see her now.
Yes.</i>

253
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,145
Don't you think the strain
of having h...

254
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,147
Go and get her!

255
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,241
Jonathan! Too much excitement!
For heaven's sake, why don't you go?

256
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,946
Certainly. I'm going!
Don't get yourself upset, Dad.

257
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,318
Then get her.
I'll get her.

258
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,304
I knew it.
Why haven't you gone?

259
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,209
Where am I going to go?
To the hotel to get your fiancée.

260
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,715
She's not my fiancée.
I never saw her before
in all my life.

261
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,048
You... You never saw her before?

262
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,146
<i>I thought it was
a matter of minutes.
I wanted him to be happy.</i>

263
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,522
<i>Oh, my.
What am I going to do?</i>

264
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,960
I can't think. Let me see. What happened?
I gave her the $50, and she said...

265
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,998
What's a town in Ohio?
Toledo.

266
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,830
No, no. A small town!
Small town! Starts with...
Shh!

267
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,531
Shelbyville! That's it! Thank you!
Does that mean you can find her?

268
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,335
There's a chance.

269
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,842
Roberts, get my hat
and coat, quick!
Yes, sir.

270
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,505
Pardon me, sir.
How is the old gentleman?

271
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,016
Well, he's hungry.
He wants a steak. He's fine.

272
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,244
Fine.

273
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,457
Board! All aboard!

274
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,890
Board!
Well, here goes.

275
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,894
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, Jenny.

276
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,930
Is these all yours?
Uh-huh.
Where's the yellow one?

277
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,124
It's right here.
I couldn't forget that.

278
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,169
High yellow.
That's my favorite color!

279
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,170
<i>Board.!
Good-bye, Jackie.</i>

280
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,401
I'll write you every week.
Thanks for the stationery
from the hotel.

281
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,773
Anne, you can't just
walk out on yourself like this.
She'll be back.

282
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,836
No, I won't. It's not so easy to meet
the Toscaninis and the Stokowskis.

283
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,848
I've been trying for two years.

284
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,578
Why, I couldn't even get to see
the second doorman at the Met.

285
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,677
It's going to be awfully dull
in Shelbyville.

286
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:26,588
There are eight million people
in this city that don't care whether
I ever sing another note in my life.

287
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,094
In Shelbyville, there are only 2,000.
The opposition isn't quite so strong there.

288
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,154
<i>You'd better come along now.
Them seats is gettin'filled up.</i>

289
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,429
<i>I'll be right in.
Good-bye, Jackie, Jennie.
Board.!</i>

290
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,951
Oh! Thank heavens!
I was afraid you'd be gone!

291
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,988
Where are your bags?
Give me the lady's bags!

292
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,989
What do you want? You can't do this!
Leave those bags there.

293
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,423
You've gotta go with me.
It's my father. He's better!
Give me the bags!

294
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:05,623
Leave the bags there. I can't go!
I'm going home! I quit my job!
This ain't no time to arbitrate!

295
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:09,155
I'll give you anything!
Another $50! Ple...
I don't want anything!

296
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,226
Hey, wait! Don't go!
Lady, I can't.
That's out of my compartment.

297
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,898
When the train goes,
I ditto.
Now will you throw 'em?

298
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,567
Yes or no?
Who's winnin'?
All right, throw 'em!

299
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,168
You is the most
untravelin'est traveler
I ever did see!

300
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,270
Let me have 'em.
How many are there?

301
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,281
Uh, three.
Three!
Let me have 'em!

302
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,443
And the big black one!
The big black one!
Throw the big...

303
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,317
Oh! Aah!

304
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,950
I've already sent a telegram home!
Well, come on.
We'll send another one from my house!

305
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,824
<i>He's been asking for you all morning.!
We'll have to hurry.!</i>

306
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,954
Hey! What's going on here?

307
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,966
This is Mr. Reynolds.
How do you do? Come along.
I'll give you another $50!

308
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,867
I didn't know
where to find you!
I remembered Shelbyville...

309
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,307
Well, what do you know?

310
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,971
Don't worry, Jennie. It's platonic.
He wants her for his father.

311
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,641
His fa... fo...

312
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,418
Try not to talk.
That's the important thing.

313
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,320
If you don't say anything,
you can't get tripped up.
Understand?

314
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,018
I won't speak unless I'm spoken to.
That's the ticket.

315
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,028
A Miss Pennington has
telephoned several times
while you were out, sir.

316
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,291
Miss Penni...
Excuse me! Oh!

317
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:17,096
When she calls again,
tell her I'll call her as soon as I can.

318
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,769
Let's go over it once more.
How long have you lived in Mexico?
Five years.

319
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,866
Parents?
Just a mother.
Left for Boston.

320
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,173
To see?
Relatives.

321
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,009
Remember, try not to talk.
I may have to
answer something.

322
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:33,176
If he asks you a question you're
not sure of, just smile... like this.

323
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,617
You can smile your way
out of anything.

324
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,349
That's fine. Ready?
Shoot.

325
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:48,694
Oh. Yes, indeed.

326
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,133
My blessings to you both.

327
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,262
Well, thank you.

328
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,829
Hello, Bishop.
Good morning, son.

329
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,899
This is Bishop Maxwell.
And this is...

330
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,502
How do you do?
How do you do.

331
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,707
Have you had your breakfast?

332
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,977
Yes, she has.
Yes, thank you.

333
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,884
Wouldn't like a nice
little steak sent up here,
would you?

334
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:13,118
- No, thank you.
- You could eat it when everyone's gone.

335
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,955
She said no.
And she wouldn't care
for a nice cigar either...

336
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,120
which she could smoke
when everyone's gone.

337
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,993
It won't do, Jonathan.

338
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,432
Keep an eye on him, Bishop.
I'll be right back.

339
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,733
Wonder if that ol' witch doctor
has a medical diploma. I bet he hasn't.

340
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,273
How did you find Mexico?

341
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:33,141
Wonderful country,
isn't it?
Yes. Yes, it is.

342
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:36,647
Yes, I was there quite a while myself.
Almost two years.

343
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,013
Really?
Charming language.

344
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,850
<i>Se dice que los Espanoles
tienen un proverbio.</i>

345
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,890
<i>El idioma Aleman
es para los caballos,</i>

346
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,687
<i>el Frances para los hombres...</i>

347
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,422
<i>y el Espanol para los mujeres.</i>

348
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,858
<i>Yo digo ques los Espanoles
estan en lo cierto. No es asi?</i>

349
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,029
Now, Bishop.

350
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:04,098
Excuse me, my dear.
That's what they say.

351
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,270
Gloria, I want you
to do something for me.

352
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,074
<i>Go to those columns.
Gloria!</i>

353
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,445
Yes? Ye... Oh. Yes.

354
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:15,577
Uh, do you see
those columns over there?

355
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,889
<i>These?
Go to them.</i>

356
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,949
<i>In the middle there.
Underneath the panel.
What, this?</i>

357
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,155
<i>Yes. Press it with your fingers
as you push it in.</i>

358
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,164
<i>Oh!</i>

359
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:31,293
<i>There's a little silver knob
in the middle there.
This one?</i>

360
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,499
Yes, with the numbers.
Turn it to the left to number 18.

361
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,804
<i>Dad, this is...
Left to 18.</i>

362
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,572
<i>This is hardly the time.
I have 18.</i>

363
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,113
<i>Now 12 to the right.
Twelve to the right.</i>

364
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,115
Dad, this is a family vault.

365
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,447
This is hardly the time
to tell the combination.

366
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,612
<i>Don't be silly.
I'm sorry, l...</i>

367
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,679
<i>I have that.</i>

368
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:56,855
Now take hold of the handle
and push it down.

369
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,528
<i>Pull it open.
Look inside.
Dad.</i>

370
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:05,036
<i>- See a large black box?
- This one?</i>

371
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,595
<i>Now take it out.
Bring it to me.</i>

372
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,148
Dad, I'm serious. I mean it.
I wouldn't do this if I were you.

373
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,149
<i>The familyjewels.
They're so...</i>

374
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,344
If it would put everyone at ease,
I could step outside.

375
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,387
What's the matter with you?

376
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,355
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean you.

377
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,414
I didn't mean you
either, Bishop.

378
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,960
Well!

379
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,627
That woman's been
with Dr. Harvey for years.

380
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,793
Well, you can't be
too careful.

381
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,840
Open it.

382
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:50,581
<i>They were my mother's,
then my wife's.</i>

383
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,141
Now they're yours.

384
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,346
Oh, they're beautiful.

385
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,753
I've never seen
anything like them.

386
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:04,455
<i>You must hand them down
to your daughter or your son's wife.</i>

387
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,793
Do you promise me?

388
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,096
May I take them out?
No. We've all seen them.
Let's put them back in the safe.

389
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:17,005
<i>What are you worried about?
Are you planning to wear them yourself?</i>

390
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,805
Well, I must be going.

391
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,075
I'll be disappointed if I don't see you
in your pew for the Easter services.

392
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,174
I'll be there.
Johnny, see the bishop out.

393
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,448
Johnny!
Yes! Oh.

394
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,989
<i>I hope you don't wait
for a June wedding.</i>

395
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,254
Confidentially,
I like to go camping in June.
Yes, she certainly is.

396
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,057
Doctor, would you mind
keeping an eye on Dad?
Certainly.

397
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,620
There's nothing like
a nice spring wedding.

398
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,429
Marry in spring
and the angels sing.
I always say that too.

399
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,560
- Well, good-bye, young lady.
- Good-bye, Bishop.

400
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,571
What do you want?
Open your mouth.

401
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,403
May I put it on?
Of course you can.

402
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,315
A most attractive young lady, John.
A most attractive young lady.

403
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,648
Yes, she is, isn't she?
I've married a lot of
beautiful women in my day...

404
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,654
speaking professionally,
of course.

405
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,351
But I've never seen a bride
as lovely as she's going to be.
Oh, thank you.

406
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:11,293
What dates have we open
for the church, Henry?
Oh, there isn't any hurry.

407
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:15,322
There's the morning of the 10th
and the afternoon of the 13th.
Perhaps the 13th.

408
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,630
Are you superstitious,
John?
Oh, yes, I certainly am.

409
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:22,071
Your fiancée's on the phone again.
It's rather urgent, sir.

410
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:29,211
Oh. Tell Mr. Fiancee
I'll call him back in a little while.

411
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,214
You didn't understand, sir.

412
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,274
It's Miss Pennington,
your fiancée.
Uh, I'll... I'll be right there.

413
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,820
Very well, sir.

414
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,287
Oh. I can explain this.

415
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,385
Uh, I, uh... It's a long story, but...

416
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,226
You're not obliged
to explain your actions to anyone.

417
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,893
You don't understand.
You see, this isn't my girl. My girl is, uh...

418
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,096
<i>You see, my father was...
Come along, Henry.</i>

419
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,371
<i>Please, Bishop,
I can explain this. L...</i>

420
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,468
Son, I'm disappointed in you.

421
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,556
Gloria.
I wanted to call you back.

422
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,252
I'm sorry, but I couldn't.
I'm sorry.

423
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,817
You don't have to explain.
I understand.

424
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,457
I should be with you
at a time like this.
I'm coming right over.

425
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,467
No! No!
I mean, no.

426
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,469
There's no need.
It's very considerate,

427
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,904
but it'd be more convenient
if I come over to the hotel.

428
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:32,568
Yes, I'll... Right awa... Yes. Fine.

429
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,578
Good-bye.

430
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,877
You might apologize
to the nurse.

431
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,883
I told her you were
a little overwrought.

432
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,910
A little overwrought? I'm going crazy.
You know what the bishop thinks?
He's known me since I was a baby.

433
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,582
Any minute Gloria might pop in
with that girl up there with that necklace.

434
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,059
What happened
to that necklace?
It was put back in the safe.

435
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,562
This is too much.
I can't stand it.

436
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,724
I'm gonna put a stop to it.
I'm gonna make a clean breast of it right now!

437
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,167
You'll do no such thing.
You want your father to live, don't you?

438
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:05,039
<i>I don't know what's kept him going,
but he's not going to have a shock
if I can help it.</i>

439
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,978
Oh, I'm sorry. L... I'll think of
something to tell Gloria. I'll...

440
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,982
<i>Tell her the truth.
What kind of a girl is she?</i>

441
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,042
That's it. That's it.
I'll tell her the truth.

442
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,289
She's a fine girl!

443
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,219
Six.

444
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,900
Seven.

445
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,905
Eight.

446
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,875
That was seven.
That was eight.
I can count just dandy.

447
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,344
Let's not argue about it.
I'll start all over again.

448
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:46,372
<i>Oh, no you don't. We agreed on 10 puffs,
and 10 puffs are all you're going to get.</i>

449
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,385
Are you calling me a liar for one puff?

450
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,287
<i>Yes, I am. And take that cigar out
or I'll count it as a puff.</i>

451
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:57,594
<i>You've got two more puffs coming
and you better hurry up
before the doctor gets back.</i>

452
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,529
I'll make you a proposition.
Instead of the last two puffs,

453
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,862
I'll just keep the cigar
in my mouth.

454
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,868
Not interested.

455
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,870
<i>I won't inhale.
Nope. Nothing doing.</i>

456
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,997
<i>Look, l...</i>

457
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:12,600
Jonathan, these wires are touching,
and from such important people.

458
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,578
<i>Everybody in the world
seems to be concerned
about you.</i>

459
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,775
They've been coming in like this all day.
Thirty-five in the last hour. Think of that.

460
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,944
I'll read them later.
Oh, now you're being modest.
Not every invalid...

461
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,614
How do you do. Not every invalid
gets a wire from the White House.

462
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,783
You ought to have that framed.
Go have it framed,
will you? Now!

463
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,760
Yes, I will. Here's one
from Walter Winchell, the journalist.

464
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,127
And Jascha Heifetz, the musician.

465
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,292
And here's one from...

466
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,733
I smell something.
Do you?

467
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,896
No, I don't think so.
I don't, either.

468
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,635
It's a very distinct odor.

469
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,234
Oh, yes. It's the oil furnace.
The fumes come up from the ventilator.

470
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,576
<i>You should have that corrected.</i>

471
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,979
Run down and tell them
to have it fixed, will you?

472
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,915
I most certainly will.
That's not good for you.

473
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,351
Here's a long wire
from Leopold Stokowski.

474
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:01,791
<i>He'll be in town the day after tomorrow
and wants to visit. We'll see about that.</i>

475
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,888
I wish you'd go out
and have that furnace fixed.
The fumes are killing me.

476
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,025
Is it that bad?
Of course I will. L...

477
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:17,272
What's that?
That's steam.
I've got hot feet.

478
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,742
Very peculiar symptom.

479
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,939
"Fumes from the oil furnace."

480
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,279
How old are you, two years?

481
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,578
You behave like a baby.

482
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,521
No use trying to tell you to do anything.

483
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,685
Hey! That's a two-dollar cigar!

484
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,695
<i>Where did you get it?</i>

485
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,197
Don't look at me.
I smoke a pipe.
Bishop gave it to me.

486
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,292
Very funny.
Fine thing
for a two-dollar cigar.

487
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,998
Where are the rest of them?
I haven't got any. There aren't any more.

488
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,302
Oh.

489
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,401
Trouble with being sick is
you've got to associate with doctors.

490
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:57,039
Thank you very much, my dear.
That fellow goes around behaving that way.

491
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,152
Stokowski's
a friend of yours?
Who?

492
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:07,521
Stokowski.
Oh, I know him.
We don't agree on Brahms.

493
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,084
You talk to him?
Not about Brahms.

494
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,494
And he...
he really comes here?

495
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,761
Oh, yes. He eats here
when he's in town.

496
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:20,361
Two-dollar cigar.
He does?

497
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,736
I'd like to meet him
sometime.

498
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,900
Do you suppose I could?
L...

499
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:28,104
I've always admired him.
My dear,
well, that's simple.

500
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,739
We must ask him here
to dinner some night.

501
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,545
Ask all my friends to dinner
if that cigar thief...

502
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,280
You won't be having anyone over.
You're still too weak.

503
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,618
If you don't start paying
attention to what I say...

504
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,888
Oh, go and smoke my cigars.

505
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:47,022
Could I sing for him?
Who, Stokowski?
Oh, no.

506
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,032
Oh, but I've studied music.

507
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,331
I've no doubt you have, my dear,
but Stokowski comes here for pleasure.

508
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,964
It'd be a pleasure.
You want me to prove it?
I'll take your word for it.

509
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,100
Have you a piano?
No. It needs tuning, anyway.

510
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,111
Where is it?
I don't remember.

511
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,740
Could you hear it from here?
It's much too far. It's downstairs.

512
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,876
Maybe if we leave
the door open.
Uh, please. I am a sick man.

513
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:11,718
L... Please.
Now, don't get excited.

514
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,893
Leave these open, please.

515
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,607
Would you boys mind giving me a hand?

516
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,581
- I beg your pardon?
- I want to move this piano.
It's for Mr. Reynolds.

517
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,679
He must be delirious.

518
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:25,728
Uh, straight ahead.
Right over there, please.

519
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,561
This isn't exactly
our field of endeavor.

520
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,262
I hope the union
doesn't get wind of this.

521
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,531
Just swing that end
around there, please.

522
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,630
I want to be sure
he can hear me.

523
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:40,905
Closer to the stairs.
Uh-huh. That's fine.

524
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,208
The bench is in there.
Would you mind, please?

525
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,909
Would you mind holding this
and this?

526
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,917
Fine. Then I can open the piano.

527
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,681
Are you going to play
something sad?

528
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,848
Oh, no, I'm going to
play something loud.

529
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,858
That's fine, boys.
Thank you.

530
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,022
If I can do anything for you...
Just go ahead
with what you're doing.

531
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,567
<i>- Can you hear me?
- No.!</i>

532
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,566
No.

533
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,754
<i>How was that?
Go ahead.!</i>

534
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,586
<i>Break every chandelier
in the house.!</i>

535
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,260
When I sing

536
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:39,167
The cares of the day are far away

537
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,138
<i>My heart seems</i>

538
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:49,635
<i>As light as the song I hear
from some happy nightingale</i>

539
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,615
<i>When I sing</i>

540
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:57,746
<i>My world is a place
that's bright and gay</i>

541
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,019
<i>Rain turns to sunshine</i>

542
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:05,927
<i>December to may</i>

543
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:24,745
<i>Life is divine</i>

544
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:28,012
<i>When I sing</i>

545
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:46,566
<i>My gray days are gay days</i>

546
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:50,596
<i>When I tra-la-la for a while</i>

547
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:54,839
<i>There's laughter in music</i>

548
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,715
<i>And each little note is a smile</i>

549
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:20,464
The music is part
of the joy in my heart

550
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,993
When I sing

551
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:51,330
The cares of the day are far away

552
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,962
My heart seems

553
00:37:54,038 --> 00:38:01,638
As light as the song I hear
from some happy nightingale

554
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,613
<i>When I sing</i>

555
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:09,642
My world is a place
that's bright and gay

556
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,087
<i>Rain turns to sunshine</i>

557
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:17,924
<i>December to may</i>

558
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,122
Who are they?

559
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:24,634
<i>- When I sing...
- They're from the national museum.</i>

560
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,068
What did they want?

561
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,800
They came to make
the death mask.

562
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,809
Whose?
The old man's.

563
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,243
<i>... Bright as the song
I hear...</i>

564
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,907
Jonathan! What are you do...
How did you get...
Shh!

565
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,577
You... You get right back to bed!
You can't do this to me.

566
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,586
I'm not a young man!
You made her stop.

567
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,248
You get back to bed!
Where are the nurses?
Any nurse.

568
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,259
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean...
I'm sorry, my dear. I apologize.

569
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,592
You can sing to anybody, and you will
just as soon as I'm up and about.
Yes.

570
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,223
<i>Mr. Reynolds!
How did he get out?
Look what he's doing.</i>

571
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,233
Leave me alone!
Get him back to bed.

572
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:01,101
If I ever live through this case,
I'm going to retire. I swear I will.

573
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,603
But who is the girl?
You must know something about her.

574
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,545
I don't even know her name.
I tell you, I found her on the street.

575
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,276
On the street?
And your father thinks that's Gloria?

576
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,184
Please understand,
this is just temporary...
only for a few days.

577
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,721
Suppose he doesn't die
in a few days?

578
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,184
Well, I wasn't thinking about that.

579
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,557
We'll have to wait
until he's stronger.

580
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,893
<i>And when it won't be
too much of a shock,
we'll let him meet Gloria.</i>

581
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,456
Shock? You can hardly
call Gloria a shock!

582
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,435
Oh, of c... I didn...
I wasn't, uh...

583
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,404
Mother, please.
Johnny's doing everything he can.

584
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,873
<i>Yes?
Yes?</i>

585
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,876
Yes?

586
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,617
<i>What's that?
Your mourning clothes, madam.</i>

587
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,884
<i>I hope they're not too late.
Oh, please, take them away.
We don't want them.</i>

588
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:57,485
No one ever wants them.
Fate forces them upon us.

589
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,462
Please take them away.
I'll send you a check.
We don't need them now.

590
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,625
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean I'm happy to hear that.

591
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,795
- Take them away!
We don't want them.
- Certainly.

592
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,032
Confusing, isn't it?
Yes, very.

593
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:15,042
You have our phone number
in case, uh...

594
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:26,456
You see, as soon as father's
up and around, you'll come over,
get acquainted, and we'll...

595
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:30,426
I refuse to let Gloria set foot in your house
until that girl is gone.

596
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,485
Don't worry about that.
I'll get rid of her.

597
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,690
<i>I'll figure out something.
Of course you will.</i>

598
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,700
You're a real darling.
A honey lamb darling.

599
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,275
I've been tampered with.

600
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,778
Look at this.

601
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:27,113
Used to have
the finest waistline in town.

602
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,210
Biggest, anyway.
I've been robbed.

603
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,482
A few steaks will soon fix this up.

604
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,585
A few steaks, medium rare.
Like lamb chops too.

605
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:42,598
Can't do this to me.
Ha! That's incredible!

606
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,188
Oh.

607
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,190
Anybody here?

608
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,229
Nobody here.
It's just the clock.
It scared me.

609
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,493
Silly. It was nothing.

610
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,148
Mr. Reynolds!

611
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,655
<i>Sir, you're downstairs?
Don't scare me
like that, Roberts.</i>

612
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,123
Where's the doctor?
He wasn't feeling well, sir.
A touch of nervous indigestion.

613
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,160
I believe he stopped off
at the doctor's.
Good.

614
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,163
He'll be here any minute.
If I were you, I'd...

615
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,324
Hmm?

616
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,934
Why, Jonathan,
what are you doing here?

617
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,606
How did you get downstairs?
I slid down the bannisters.

618
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,173
You know you shouldn't do...
Where's your nurse?

619
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,778
I've been looking for her all over the place.
Where were you?

620
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,119
I had to stop by.
I've been having
a little trouble.

621
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:17,285
Trouble?
I haven't been
feeling so...

622
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,357
What's this?
What's what?

623
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,265
That's Roberts, my butler.
What's that
he's got in his mouth?

624
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,272
Hmm?

625
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,274
Why, if it isn't a cigar.

626
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,333
What do you mean,
smoking in my presence?

627
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,278
How dare you!
Cut it out! You know he's not smoking
that cigar of his own free will.

628
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,282
Isn't he?

629
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,251
Oh, I'm sorry, Roberts.
I forgot. I asked him to smoke.

630
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,253
I like the, uh, aroma.

631
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:47,347
He smokes 'em, I smell 'em.
Any objections?
No, but...

632
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:51,622
You can go now, Roberts, and remember,
whenever I'm around, you're to smoke.

633
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,686
Very good, sir.

634
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:05,572
Here you are! This isn't exactly
where you told me you were going.

635
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,577
He kept me waiting up there
20 minutes...

636
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,579
before I discovered the
bathroom had another door.

637
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,411
Why, Dad,
it's great to see you up.
Come along now, Jonathan.

638
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,417
Quit shoving!
Where's Gloria?

639
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,545
Uh, Gloria?
I'm gonna pick her up
in a few minutes, Dad.

640
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:21,421
I've never seen anybody so excited
about anything in all my life.

641
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,426
<i>E-E-Excited?
What's she excited about?</i>

642
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,689
I'm giving her a party.

643
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,697
You're giving Gloria
a pa... a party?

644
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,495
She wants to meet
all my musical friends
and sing for 'em.

645
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,501
She's going to,
Saturday night.

646
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,436
You must go back to your room now.
Not yet.
I've got to make a phone call.

647
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,633
That's what you said the last time.

648
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,438
Don't you think Saturday night's
a little too soon?
Yes. Don't you?

649
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,378
Can't call it off.
Everything's been started.
It's too late.

650
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:46,314
Besides, I want New York
to meet the girl you're going to marry.

651
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,908
Wonder where I can
get hold of Heifetz?

652
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,079
This time I'm going with you!

653
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,948
Leave me alone!

654
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,223
Enough's enough.
Too much.

655
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,560
He's seen that girl for the last time.
By Saturday she'll be back in Iowa
or wherever she comes from.

656
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,564
Kentucky.
Ohio.

657
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,726
What's the difference?
I'll pay her off right now.

658
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,066
What are you going to tell him?
You figure out something.

659
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,071
Me?
You're in this as much as I am.

660
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,699
But I'm a sick man.
I'm a very sick man.

661
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:21,574
She sings like a thrush.
From Ireland.

662
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,815
<i>Stop already.!</i>

663
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,254
All night long I am pushing the wagon!
Peanuts! Popcorn!

664
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,350
All day long I'm hearing:
La-la-la-la

665
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,396
Shut up!
Is this a free country?
Then I got to sleep!

666
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,955
If I lay my hands on you,
you'll sleep for a month!
Stop yellin'!

667
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,024
<i>Who's yelling?
Who's yelling?</i>

668
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,127
Everybody she's yelling!

669
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,230
<i>Is anything the matter?</i>

670
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,970
No, dearie, nothing at all.
It's just Mr. Popalardi.

671
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,103
He's drunk again.

672
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:52,148
Drunk? I'm drunk?
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

673
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:56,050
Go back to your practicing.
Remember, Saturday's only
the day after tomorrow.

674
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,180
You wouldn't want those
important people to be
disappointed in your singin'.

675
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,554
Go on with ya now.
All right.

676
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,253
I'll be sendin' ya up
a nice hot cup of coffee
in a minute, dearie.

677
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,660
Thank you.

678
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,928
It's wonderful the way
those people are pulling for me.

679
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,094
They want you to kill 'em
Saturday night, honey.

680
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,606
And you will too.
Just wait 'til they see you
in that new gown.

681
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:21,372
You won't even have to sing good.
When do you get it?
Tomorrow morning.

682
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,538
<i>I'll bet
he'll like it too.
Who?</i>

683
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,812
<i>He isn't exactly blind.
I used to go steady
with an engaged fellow.</i>

684
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:31,685
It was very romantic.
He was awfully nice
to both of us.

685
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:35,919
What are you talking about?
I was just telling you
about the fellow I used to go with.

686
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,326
Turned out he was fickle.
He married his fiancée.

687
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:42,365
<i>Are you out of your mind?
He's engaged.
I know.!</i>

688
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,094
So was this guy.
That's what all the trouble
was about!

689
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,330
Now, look, Jackie...
You don't have to...

690
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,372
<i>Come in.</i>

691
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,374
Hello.

692
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:56,242
Oh, hello. I wasn't expecting you.
You rememberJackie, don't you?

693
00:46:56,313 --> 00:47:01,012
- Of course.
- The station.

694
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,348
Oh, yes, yes, certainly.

695
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,356
Ah, if you'll excuse me,
I'll, uh...

696
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:17,632
Won't you sit down?
Oh, yes, yes, I can only
stay for just a minute.

697
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,794
<i>Whoops!</i>

698
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,800
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant that chair.

699
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,172
Here, let me help you.
I'll get it. Don't worry.

700
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,837
No, just stand still.
I'm sorry. You got it.

701
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,278
Just a second now.
I'll get it.

702
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:35,944
Pull, don't...
You sat in our gymnasium.

703
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,510
Your gymnasium?
See?

704
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:43,885
I read somewhere that a disadvantage
is nothing but an opportunity
for improvement.

705
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,021
And this place is
just full of opportunities.
You have a very nice room.

706
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,725
It's, uh...
It's different.
Uh-huh.

707
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,234
On a clear day you can see
all the way across it.

708
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,770
I'd better get ready now.
The chauffeur usually
picks me up a little later.

709
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:58,137
I can be dressed
in just two minutes.
That's not necessary.

710
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,642
<i>I mean,
to get dressed.
No?</i>

711
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,339
No, that's why I'm here. You don't
have to come to the house anymore.

712
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:06,382
You're free to go home.
Today, if you like.
I brought your check.

713
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,214
You can look it over if you want to.
I think it's all there, though.

714
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,619
I could stay on another few days,
until the end of the week maybe?

715
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:17,524
That's not necessary.
Father's gonna be all right,
thanks to you.

716
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:22,361
I hope this repays you
a little.
This going away is so sudden.

717
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,799
The shock for your father.
I mean, aren't you afraid...
I thought of that.

718
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,429
I have a solution. I'm gonna tell him
that you and I quarreled.

719
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:31,133
You broke our engagement.
I'll tell him tonight.

720
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,540
Then I'll introduce Gloria to him
as a friend of Dr. Harvey's.

721
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,876
He'll get to know her and in time
it'll become more or less, you see...

722
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,473
I see.

723
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,576
Well, I want you to know
how grateful I am and, uh,

724
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,645
thanks again.

725
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:50,393
L...

726
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,520
Thanks.
Look...

727
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,397
H-He was giving me a party Saturday night
so some people could hear me sing.

728
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,561
Would you let me
come to that?
How?

729
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,128
Couldn't you ask Gloria
to wait just a few more days?

730
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,538
And introduce you to
our friends Saturday night
as my fiancée?

731
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,543
You don't really think
that could happen.

732
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,808
They could think I was an entertainer.
I've been planning so much on this party.

733
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,782
I'd really do anything...
Now, now,
let's be more practical.

734
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,684
I'm sure you can get people
with musical connections
to hear you sing.

735
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:21,053
That's not as easy as you think.
I don't know anybody
with musical connections.

736
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:24,355
I know a few.
I could write some letters
if you can really sing.

737
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:29,058
I can sing, all right, but they don't...
If I could hear you sometime,
I might be able to do all I can.

738
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,963
You can hear me now,
if you want to.

739
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,836
Yes, all right.

740
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,839
Is there anything you like especially?

741
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:46,815
Ah, no, just whatever
you have there is all right.

742
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:52,822
Well, here's a little Spanish song.
It's nice... very, very short.

743
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,858
<i>Holy mackerel!</i>

744
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,486
<i>It's almost noon
and I promised to take Gloria
and her mother to lunch.!</i>

745
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,429
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll, uh, write you.

746
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:05,025
We'll get something done.
Thank you very much again.
Good-bye.

747
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,814
It's hard to believe.
It was hard
for me to believe too.

748
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,413
I thought
she was crazy about me.
What a temper! Wow!

749
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:30,051
She seemed such a nice girl,
so mild and gentle.

750
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,618
Mild and gentle!
See this mark?

751
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,563
That's where she hit me
with her handbag
and for nothing too.

752
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:38,931
I'm all broken up, Dad.
All broken up.

753
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,027
I guess it's all for the best.
I'm young.

754
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,265
I'll fall in love again.
Sooner than I think.

755
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,707
Then this will only be
a bitter memory. That's life.

756
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,839
- I say, that's life.
- What?

757
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,475
Oh, yes.

758
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:59,147
I wonder why she didn't call me up
before she left. I thought she liked me.

759
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,885
Dad, you were so anxious
to like a fiancée of mine,

760
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:06,360
that you gave yourself
the wrong impression.

761
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,058
She liked me.

762
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,659
<i>Dad, I didn't want to tell you this,
but do you know what she called you?</i>

763
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,204
What?
You won't think
too badly of her?

764
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,433
What did she call me?
A pompous,
self-indulgent,

765
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,908
overbearing imitation
of a dictator.

766
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:25,573
Did she say that?
And she said
I took after you.

767
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:29,107
She did?

768
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:35,417
Pompous, overbearing.
Tch, tch, tch.

769
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:42,361
Oh, this must be Dr. Harvey.
He's bringing along two friends.

770
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,696
Mother and daughter, old friends.
Wonderful people.

771
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:49,102
I don't want
to meet any people.
But these people are charming, he says.

772
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,448
Oh, forgive me, Johnny,
if you can.

773
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,958
I'm such a silly girl.
I'm spoiled. It's my temper.

774
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:12,927
I don't deserve any happiness.
You shouldn't take me back.

775
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:17,092
- There's no need for tears.
- It'll never happen again.

776
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:22,195
I was just upset. I picked a quarrel
and he acted like a lamb, a perfect lamb.

777
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,002
Oh, Johnny, please say
you'll forgive me. Please!

778
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,303
Well, say something.

779
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,109
All right, I will.
I'll say something. This girl...

780
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:36,414
This girl is not...

781
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:40,115
<i>For heaven's sake,
say you'll forgive her!</i>

782
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,353
Mr. Reynolds!
Your condition!

783
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,485
Dad, don't get excited!
Say it!

784
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,792
All right! I forgive her!
That's better.

785
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:50,355
Dad, you all right?
Yes! Yes, yes, yes.

786
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,664
Don't you think
you'd better lie down?
Go away!

787
00:52:56,206 --> 00:53:00,973
I like a girl with spirit.
To tell you the truth,
I thought you were wishy-washy.

788
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:03,478
Yes, I did.

789
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:07,677
To have the courage
to ask for forgiveness
is a great quali...

790
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:11,915
What was it you called me?
Pompous? Self-indulgent?

791
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:17,051
<i>"Imitation of a dictator."
It's true. It's me all over.</i>

792
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,324
And you'll do well to correct
those faults in yourself, me boy!

793
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,922
<i>If you don't watch out,
you'll grow up to bejust like me.</i>

794
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:26,162
<i>Been meaning to warn you
about that for years.</i>

795
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:33,066
Go on, make it up with him.
Kiss him.

796
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,704
Kiss him?
Of course, you know why
lovers quarrel, don't you?

797
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,876
<i>Simple.
Fun of making it up.</i>

798
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:52,827
Aaah!

799
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,525
<i>Aaah.! Aah.!</i>

800
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,604
Mm.
Ow, my... Aaah!

801
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:07,200
Let me up. Let me go. Aah!

802
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,272
Now, Johnny, let me up.
Now, please... Johnny!
Ha-ha.

803
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,011
<i>Johnny.
Please, don't do that, Johnny.</i>

804
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,076
Do what? This?
Aah! Stop it!

805
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,919
Let me up, Johnny!
Please let me go!
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Don't!

806
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:24,290
<i>Johnny let me go.! Stop it.!
Johnny.! Please.!</i>

807
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,762
<i>Please, let me go.!
Stop it.!</i>

808
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:31,460
<i>Johnny.!
Stop it.!</i>

809
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:35,971
<i>Johnny.!
Please, John...</i>

810
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,803
<i>Please, John...</i>

811
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,475
Cigar?
I'll help you find one.

812
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:46,481
<i>Don't bother, dear.
It's no bother at all.</i>

813
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,382
He said, "Don't bother, dear."
Aaah!

814
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,749
Going around pinching people,
at your age.

815
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:59,488
When I get about three seconds older,
I'm gonna start punching people.

816
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,553
You dirty little... Come here! Hey!

817
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,759
<i>Come here.!
Say.! Hey.! Oh.!</i>

818
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:08,497
Are you hurt?

819
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,438
Let me go!

820
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,538
Oh, no, you don't!
Hey, come here.

821
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,687
I told you I wanted to
sing Saturday night
and I'm going to.

822
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,819
<i>Over my dead body.</i>

823
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,228
<i>I'll tell your father
the truth after Saturday night.</i>

824
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,766
<i>I'd tell him right now
if I wasn't afraid the shock
would kill him.</i>

825
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:41,531
After the party I'll disappear, I promise
and then you can have Gloria for good.

826
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:45,131
<i>That'll be great after you've been
introduced to half of New York
as my fiancée.</i>

827
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,176
<i>All I want
is this one chance.</i>

828
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:49,768
If I could only get my hands on...

829
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:56,882
You hear something snap,
don't turn around.
It'll be your neck.

830
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:00,650
You have to
catch me first.

831
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:28,681
<i>Who's coming Saturday?
Huh?</i>

832
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,982
I said, who'll be here
Saturday night?
Who'll be here?

833
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,579
Oh, everybody,
everybody.
Stokowski?

834
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:37,114
<i>Oh, yes,
yes, of course.
Heifetz too?</i>

835
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:41,493
<i>There's a guest list
in my desk in the library
if you'd care to look it over.</i>

836
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,431
This is the song I'm going to sing.
Wanna hear it?

837
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,833
I'd love to.

838
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:52,930
<i>Clavelitos a quien le doy claveles</i>

839
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:56,775
<i>Clavelitos para los churumbeles</i>

840
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,371
Clavelitos que los doy
con los ojos cerraos

841
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,714
Y los traigo en el cesto
a precio modesto rojos y pintaos

842
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:09,224
<i>Clavelitos de la tierra adorada</i>

843
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:15,322
<i>Clavelitos que vienen de Granada</i>

844
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:18,128
Clavelitos que los traigo
yo aqui para ti

845
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,897
<i>Yque tienen la esencia
presencia y potencia que tienen pa mi</i>

846
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:29,010
<i>Clavelitos</i>

847
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,171
<i>Que los traigo bonitos</i>

848
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,772
Pa mi novio los traigo

849
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,718
<i>Porque tienen pa robar corazones
ole y ensenarles</i>

850
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,688
Esencia presencia y potencia
que ya sabe usted, si tu me quieres

851
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:43,920
<i>Mi nino, carino, yo te dare
un clavelito yo y veras que bien</i>

852
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:47,588
<i>Si estamos juntos en un rinconcito
si tu me quieres sera no del alma</i>

853
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,656
<i>Si te quiero mas a ti
y todos las clavelitos bonitos</i>

854
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:53,566
<i>Todos seran para ti
Todos son para ti</i>

855
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,969
Para ti, para ti, para ti

856
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,714
Jonathan, I want you
to meet two old friends of mine,

857
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,378
Mrs. Smith and her daughter,
Miss Smith.

858
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,388
How do you do?
How do you do?

859
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,920
How do you do?
Won't you sit down, Mrs., uh...

860
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,592
Smith.
Smith.
Won't you sit down?

861
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:28,865
Uh, no, thank you, we just
stopped in to say hello.
Hello.

862
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:32,499
Oh, well, oh, uh, um...

863
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,476
C-Can't you stay
for just a minute?

864
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,275
Oh, no. We're in
a dreadful hurry, really.

865
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:45,146
Oh, l... I beg your pardon.
This is Miss Gloria Pennington,

866
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:47,212
my son's fiancée.

867
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:53,589
How do you do?

868
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,029
Oh, I'm sorry, we can't stay.

869
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,227
We're on our way to...
to, uh...
To a horse show.

870
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:02,100
Horse show at this time of the year?
Where?

871
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,072
Yes. Uh...
Dr. Harvey hasn't told us.
Where is it?

872
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:08,406
Huh? Oh, oh,
it's a private horse show
at a friend's house.

873
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,446
Afraid I couldn't offer you
anything as entertaining as that.

874
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,073
<i>My daughter simply
adores horses.</i>

875
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:17,142
So nice to have seen all of you.
Come, Mother.
Yes, dear.

876
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,350
We've had a nice visit.
At it again, huh? Good-bye.

877
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,949
Excuse me.
I'll see them to their car.

878
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,864
Gloria, I had nothing to do with this.
That girl forced me into it.

879
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,959
Have you a handkerchief?
Handkerchief? Yes.

880
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:37,132
But don't cry, dear.
I won't.

881
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:40,573
Glor...

882
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:44,704
Glo...

883
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,849
Well, good night, my dear.
Good night.

884
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:52,547
Good night.
Think I'll go to bed.

885
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:04,061
Good night, Johnny.
Good night, Dad.

886
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:24,250
Fine, just fine,
the way you handle things.

887
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,553
Your wrap, miss?

888
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,061
Hmm? Oh, please.

889
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,966
<i>Yes, come in.</i>

890
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:52,205
L... I wonder if I could talk to you
for a few minutes.

891
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:55,978
Of course, my dear.
What is it?

892
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:59,715
Well, I, uh...
I'll ring for you
when I need you, Roberts.

893
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:04,226
Very well, sir.
Excuse me.
Sit down, my dear.

894
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:13,333
Is anything troubling you?

895
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:18,363
Well, yes. You see...
I don't know how to begin.

896
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:23,401
<i>Is it as difficult as that?
It's about...</i>

897
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:28,382
Before you start, would you mind
getting me one of those pills?

898
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,614
<i>On the table. Over there.</i>

899
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,591
<i>That's right, the little yellow bottle.</i>

900
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,992
<i>These?
Yes. I'd better take one.</i>

901
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:43,430
- Aren't you feeling well?
- Does bother me a little bit.

902
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:47,492
But I've got to expect it,
though, at my time of life.

903
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:52,406
Would you get me
a glass of water, dear?
Water? Yes.

904
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,103
There's the pitcher.

905
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,074
<i>Must have been those friends
of Dr. Harvey's.</i>

906
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,518
I expect he'd have friends
like that. Thank you.

907
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:14,791
Better?

908
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,526
Oh, oh, yes.
I'm quite all right.

909
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,398
Nothing to worry...

910
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:24,531
It's only the fire.
Huh? Oh, oh.

911
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:29,271
The least excitement
brings it on.

912
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:34,806
I'm always afraid they'll put me back
in that overstuffed straight jacket.

913
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:36,749
You'll be all right,
I'm sure.

914
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:39,720
Few more days with you
and I will be.

915
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:44,582
What are you going to wear
for the party?
The party?

916
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,594
Have you got your dress?
Yes, but...

917
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:51,156
What color is it?
Black.
I think I'd better be going.

918
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:55,227
We'd be the handsomest couple there
if I hadn't lost my waistline.

919
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:59,263
This is ridiculous.

920
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:02,709
Good night, dear.
Good night.

921
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:16,185
<i>Good night.</i>

922
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,989
Good night, my dear.

923
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:41,405
It is my firm conviction
Mrs. Pennington
is a medical freak.

924
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,921
I was watching her,
and no normal person can talk as long
as she does without taking a breath.

925
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,081
For a second I thought you
weren't going to calm them down.

926
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:51,786
You were almost
an ex-fiancée.
Yeah, it was pretty close...

927
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:03,138
<i>Where have you been?
You might go up.
He could be feeling better.</i>

928
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:05,174
You don't mean...
He...

929
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:08,335
What have you
been up to?
I haven't been up to anything.

930
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,538
You did something
up there.
I tried, but I couldn't.

931
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:16,381
What did you try to do?
L... I tried
to tell him the truth.

932
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:21,253
But I didn't have the heart.
Must be some other way.

933
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:28,391
You do admit you put me
in a terrible spot.

934
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,830
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

935
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,735
If I had my life to live over,
I wouldn't have been so selfish.

936
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:38,433
Oh, I can understand
what prompted you.

937
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:43,069
Is, uh... Is everything all right now
between you and Miss Pennington?

938
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:46,740
Yes, she finally forgave me.
She's acting wonderfully.

939
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:50,274
She is...
It's been tough on her.

940
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:54,312
I don't blame her... much.
It's her mother.

941
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,326
Do you think there's anything
to heredity?

942
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,989
L... I wouldn't know
about that.

943
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:05,625
Dr. Harvey says her mother
is a medical freak. I believe him.

944
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:11,735
They haven't been able to prove definitely
that people inherit traits from their parents.

945
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,743
They have with horses.
Yes, I know
about the horses.

946
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:19,907
Oh. Marvelous the way
they do that.
Yes, it is.

947
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,815
This surely has been funny.

948
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:26,150
I bring you here by accident
and my father likes you so much.

949
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,452
We can't tell him
the truth.

950
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,049
<i>He'd have liked anybody you brought.
Oh, no, he wouldn't.</i>

951
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:35,154
<i>You should have seen
the looks he gave some
I brought home.</i>

952
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,756
Did... Did you bring home a great many?

953
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:41,633
I mean, just as friends, you know.

954
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,638
Oh.

955
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:49,008
He certainly does like you.

956
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:53,105
I like him too.
Hmm?

957
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:56,777
Well, we better think up a plan
to get me out of the party.
Oh, yes.

958
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,616
Now, let me see.
Yes.

959
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,481
Let's see, uh...

960
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,477
- Bad.
- Pardon?

961
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,485
<i>Needs more bounce.
Bounce?</i>

962
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:35,855
Bubbles.
Ever listen to champagne?

963
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:38,018
You see?
I see.

964
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:46,200
That's better. Remember
what you're playing at 11:00.
I won't forget.

965
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:48,566
The minute I make
the announcement,
play something loud.

966
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:52,095
Yes, sir.
A couple of my guests
may need reviving.

967
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:58,307
Here you are, sir.
Hmm?

968
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:01,214
Has Dr. Harvey hidden
my cigars from me?
He has, sir.

969
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,376
Have you hidden them
from Dr. Harvey?
I have, sir.

970
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:05,386
Good.

971
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:13,227
What is the matter?

972
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:16,162
Too much paprika.
Too much? This much.

973
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:20,726
<i>I, Armand...
Calmez vous, Armand,
quandje dis trop de paprika.</i>

974
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:25,103
<i>Monsieur Reynolds, insulter mon cuisine
c'est m'insulter moi, Armand.</i>

975
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:30,305
<i>What's that?
Roast beef Napoleon.
Ah! Delicieux.!</i>

976
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:34,543
Not bad.

977
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:38,986
<i>Jonathan?</i>

978
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,216
I thought I'd find you here,
Jonathan.
How do you feel, Dad?

979
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,555
How do I know? Ask him.
I have a very pleasant
surprise for you.

980
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,289
How long will you be gone?

981
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:50,992
No, I mean I have some friends
coming over. Do you remember
the two ladies you met?

982
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,968
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Why, Jonathan,
the two ladies you met...

983
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:55,970
<i>Pardon, you're wanted
on the telephone.
Can't be bothered.</i>

984
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,404
It might be
important, Dad.
Who is it?

985
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:01,966
- Miss Pennington, sir.
- What does she want?

986
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:04,512
<i>I don't know, sir.
Why don't you ask her?</i>

987
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,571
Ah.

988
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,078
Very dependable
young lady.
Very.

989
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:18,756
How are you, Jonathan?
My, it's nice to see you
up and around again.

990
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,160
Hello, Johnny!
Hello, Johnny!

991
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:24,199
Johnny, how are you?
Hello, Johnny.

992
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,369
What's wrong?

993
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:32,567
L... I have a splitting headache.
It came on suddenly.

994
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,802
I'm... very sorry.
I can't come to the party.

995
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:39,075
You can't?
That's not very good news, you know.

996
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:42,379
The party will be no party without you.

997
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:46,387
<i>I could send the car over.
Perhaps in a little while
you'll be feeling better.</i>

998
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,891
Dad, I wouldn't force her
if she, uh... I mean...

999
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,019
What's that? Well, I see.

1000
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,563
Would you like me
to come over there?
Oh, no, no, she doesn't.

1001
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,656
Oh, no, no, don't do that.

1002
01:08:57,733 --> 01:09:00,395
It's not necessary.
I'd rather be alone, really.

1003
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,131
It's only fair.
When I was ill you came to me.

1004
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,799
It's the least I can do.
Jonathan, you know
you can't leave this house.

1005
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,207
Go away.
That was that doctor.

1006
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:12,737
You're at the St. Charles?
What's your room number?
She doesn't...

1007
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,613
My room num...
Oh, I'm not at the hotel.

1008
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,653
I'm with some friends.
They'll see that I'm all right.

1009
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,485
Where do they live?
Dad, really, you shouldn't.
Please, let me...

1010
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,219
Let me alone.
I can be there in 15 minutes.

1011
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,727
Jonathan, I forbid it.
Dad, you're having a party.
The guests are here.

1012
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:29,992
Go away. Get out!
What's that address, dear?

1013
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:33,831
I can be there in five minutes.
Or don't you want to see me?

1014
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:38,567
No, I don't. I don't wanna see you.
I don't ever wanna see you again,
you understand?

1015
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:40,973
I don't ever wanna see you again!
That's all!

1016
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,264
Dad, I'm sure she didn't
mean to be rude. It...

1017
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:12,137
It's just that she isn't feeling well
and she's probably...

1018
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,142
probably more or less a little nervous.

1019
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:19,442
<i>Why, you're the picture ofhealth,
Jonathan.</i>

1020
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:23,110
Awfully nice to see you
around again.
How are you, Mr. Reynolds?

1021
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,983
Positively streamlined.
I wish I knew how you did it.
Look at me!

1022
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,547
<i>Yes, look at him!
How are you, John?</i>

1023
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,616
How are you?
Hello, Johnny?

1024
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:35,323
<i>Penny, how are you?
How are you, dear?</i>

1025
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,594
Darling, how are you?
Oh, Myra. Fine, thank you.

1026
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:41,135
Awfully glad to see you.
Oh, excuse me just a moment.

1027
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:43,137
Hello, John.
Hello, Gloria.
Hello.

1028
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:45,298
Good evening.
It's all set. She just phoned.
She isn't coming.

1029
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,968
Good. At last
I can be Mrs. Pennington.
Where's the rest of the family?

1030
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:49,738
Hello.
He's right in there somewhere.

1031
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:53,077
Well, shall we go in?
Of course, heaven knows
we waited long enough for this.

1032
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,912
You haven't said a word
about how I look.
Oh, you look fine.

1033
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,681
Just beautiful.
New dress, huh?
Well, shall we?

1034
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,949
At first, just talk to him.
Warm him up.

1035
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,719
<i>Hello, Johnny.
Hello there.
Remember the music... Brahms.</i>

1036
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:07,523
He hates it.
There's only one thing
I want to discuss with him.

1037
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,064
Where's Dad?
In the living room,
I think.

1038
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,396
Good evening, Doctor.
Don't forget, we're no longer
the Smiths.

1039
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,436
<i>Where's your father,
John?
Isn't he in there?</i>

1040
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:18,667
No, I just
came from there.
Excuse me. I'll get him.

1041
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:21,175
Looking for someone,
Johnny?
Yes, I was looking for Dad.

1042
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:24,041
Looking for him myself.
Understand he's lost 60 pounds.
Yes, he has.

1043
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,549
How does he feel?
Oh, he feels fine.
Excuse me just a moment.

1044
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,179
Oh, I'll get him. Just a minute.

1045
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:35,247
<i>What's wrong?
I can't find him.</i>

1046
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:38,760
Why, I distinctly saw him
go into the living room.
Maybe he's upstairs.

1047
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:41,125
Is Mr. Reynolds up there,
Simmons?
No, sir, haven't seen him.

1048
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,529
You haven't seen him.
He was in full view
not five minutes ago.

1049
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,591
Where's your father,
Johnny?
Roberts!

1050
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:50,332
I can't find my father.
Where is he?
I have no idea, sir.

1051
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,606
Cocktails, madam?
No, thank you.

1052
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:08,582
Uh, this way?

1053
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,091
Yes, sir.
The first door to your left.

1054
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:22,731
<i>Come in.</i>

1055
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:30,309
Set it down anywhere
and dust it off.
Give it to me.

1056
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:32,347
Oh!

1057
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:35,281
- Dust what off?
- I thought you were the...

1058
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,444
We asked a man downstairs
to bring the trunk up.

1059
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:41,011
May I sit down?

1060
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,792
Yes, of course.

1061
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:49,261
Oh! No!
Not there. That chair bites.

1062
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:52,664
That's our gymnasium.
You can sit here.
This is very comfortable.

1063
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,726
Who are you?
Who are you?

1064
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,862
I'm Jonathan Reynolds.
I'm Jackie Donovan.

1065
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:00,067
How do you do?
How do you do?
Oh!

1066
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:03,509
Jonathan Reynolds?

1067
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:07,242
Well, I have to go to work now.
I'll see ya at the station, Anne...

1068
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:09,910
unless he can talk
some sense into you!

1069
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:22,555
So you never want
to see me again, hmm?

1070
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:29,295
Why did you come?

1071
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:34,468
I was afraid you meant
what you said on the phone.

1072
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:38,673
It seems I was right.
Are you leaving?

1073
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:43,810
Tonight, 11:30.

1074
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:47,845
Well, it isn't a very nice way...

1075
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:51,950
for old friends to part, is it?

1076
01:13:57,566 --> 01:14:01,195
We are old friends, aren't we?

1077
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,705
Yes.

1078
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:09,369
But you were gonna go away
without even saying good-bye.

1079
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:18,753
They'll be missing you at the party.

1080
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:20,982
Don't you think you should go back?

1081
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,259
I'm terribly fond of you, you know.

1082
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:32,300
Terribly fond.

1083
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:35,165
You don't mind my saying that,
do you?

1084
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:40,101
When you're as old as I am,
you haven't got much time left
to waste...

1085
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:44,441
and you just say things
right out.

1086
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:47,346
Anne Terry.

1087
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:50,647
That is your name,
isn't it?

1088
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,246
Anne Terry, Anne Terry.

1089
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:58,384
I like it better.

1090
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,435
How long have you known?

1091
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:11,837
Oh, a few days,
but that's not important now.

1092
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:15,934
Without even saying good-bye.

1093
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,413
Sing that for me.

1094
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,621
I can't now.

1095
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:34,685
Not even that?

1096
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:36,993
What have I done to you?

1097
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:55,982
Goin' home

1098
01:15:56,051 --> 01:16:05,016
I'm a-goin' home

1099
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:09,496
<i>Quiet like</i>

1100
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:14,525
Some still day

1101
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:24,342
<i>I'm just goin'home</i>

1102
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:29,407
It's not far

1103
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:34,547
Just close by

1104
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:39,026
Through an open

1105
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:43,861
<i>Door</i>

1106
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:48,369
<i>Work all done</i>

1107
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:54,034
Care laid by

1108
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:58,409
Goin' to grieve

1109
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:03,884
No more

1110
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:09,686
Mother's there

1111
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:14,422
Expectin' me

1112
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:19,160
Father's waitin'...

1113
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,375
Is this the dress?

1114
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,850
Yes.

1115
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:39,853
Pretty.

1116
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,014
And this little fur?

1117
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:46,151
Well, that... that's not mine.
We borrowed it.

1118
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:49,493
We were to be the handsomest
couple there, remember?

1119
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:56,134
You could catch a train
in the morning.

1120
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:59,571
Oh, no, I can't go to the party.
I promised.

1121
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,871
Oh, no,
I didn't mean the party.

1122
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:06,903
We two should go out together somewhere
and say good-bye properly, hmm?

1123
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:12,712
People would recognize you
and that wouldn't be fair.

1124
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:15,951
I know of a nice quiet place
where no one knows me.

1125
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,994
Where no one knows you?

1126
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:27,866
Good evening, Mr. Reynolds.
How are you, Mr. Reynolds?

1127
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:33,096
Why, Jonathan Reynolds!
Lost a little weight, haven't you?

1128
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:35,666
Yes, this is ridiculous,
isn't it?

1129
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,042
Here's your check,
Mr. Reynolds.
Thank you very much.

1130
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:42,311
Nice quiet place
where no one knows you, hmm?
I've never been here before.

1131
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:45,911
<i>Must have seen my picture
in the paper.
Nice having you with us again.</i>

1132
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:50,321
Right this way,
Mr. Reynolds.
Oh, I forgot.

1133
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,623
Excuse me, please.
Thomas!

1134
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,687
<i>Yes, sir?
I forgot to tell my son
where I was going.</i>

1135
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:58,699
Would you call him, please?
Certainly, sir.

1136
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:02,726
And tell him I mightn't be here long
in case he wants to join me.
Very good, sir.

1137
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:05,204
This way, please.
I am so sorry.

1138
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:08,208
I do apologize. I had to
see that man over there...

1139
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:10,540
<i>Good evening, Jonathan.
How do you do?</i>

1140
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:13,137
That's Jonathan Reynolds.
Is he still alive?

1141
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:17,709
<i>Here we are.
Charles.
Coming.</i>

1142
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:22,687
Your wrap?
No, thank you.

1143
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,352
For Mr. Reynolds,
a Reynolds Special. For madam?
Nothing, thank you.

1144
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:28,021
<i>We'll order
dinner later.
Very good, sir.</i>

1145
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,860
We haven't seen you
in a long time, Mr. Reynolds.

1146
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,696
How nice of you to save
one of those for me.

1147
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,828
<i>Thank you.</i>

1148
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:38,668
<i>Won't you tell me
why you brought me here?</i>

1149
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:43,837
It's a nice place,
music and dancing.
And everyone knows you.

1150
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,846
Well, yes.

1151
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:48,644
People see you here with me,
they tell other people.

1152
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,810
<i>It helps you out.
It helps what?</i>

1153
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:54,982
You want a career, don't you?

1154
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:58,651
There are people here
who can open the doors for you.

1155
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:01,195
<i>Not if you go to them yourself,
of course.</i>

1156
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:04,391
But you're seen with me...
I support the opera.

1157
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,400
Makes a difference.

1158
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,801
Hold it, will ya, Mr. Reynolds?

1159
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:12,101
Thank you.
Thank you.

1160
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:14,369
That helps too, you know.
Tomorrow morning that will be
in the papers...

1161
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:16,740
l... I do wish you wouldn't
let him use that picture.

1162
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,780
Why not?
It's not fair.

1163
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:21,441
To whom?
Well, to, uh...
Please try and stop him.

1164
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:24,485
Don't let him use it.
Tell him to destroy it.
I'll do what I can.

1165
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:27,181
Oh, please try, won't you?
L...
If you'll excuse me...

1166
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,890
<i>Mister?
Oh, yes, Mr. Reynolds.</i>

1167
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:36,260
The young lady with me
is Miss Anne Terry, my son's fiancée.

1168
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,630
Thank you,
Mr. Reynolds.
T-E-R-R-Y.

1169
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:42,295
Thank you,
Mr. Reynolds.

1170
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,361
<i>Oh, Thomas?
Yes, sir?</i>

1171
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:46,703
Did you reach my son?
Yes, sir, he said
he'd be right over.

1172
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:50,006
He seemed
rather upset, sir.
Very good.

1173
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:04,692
He's going to destroy
the picture.
Oh, thank you.

1174
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:08,251
Would you mind asking
for the check now, please?
I don't understand you.

1175
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:11,265
I thought you wanted a career.
This is the least I can do for you.

1176
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:14,496
I know, but l... Would you
bring the check now, please?

1177
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:17,197
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.

1178
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:20,435
What's that?
It's a Reynolds Special.

1179
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:23,500
But you shouldn't be dri...
What's in it?

1180
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:26,308
Oh, it's,
uh, nothing but...

1181
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:29,782
coconut milk
and vegetable juices.

1182
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:32,581
Dr. Harvey orders it for me.
It's...

1183
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,226
It's horrible.
Then why do you drink it?

1184
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:44,959
Because it reminds me of Dr. Harvey
and it makes me hate him...

1185
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:47,866
and when I hate him
I feel good.

1186
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:51,497
There isn't any, um...
Oh, no, no, no.

1187
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,768
Let me taste it.

1188
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:05,311
Oh, that's awful.

1189
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:11,516
<i>Do you order this often?
Always. Have to.</i>

1190
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,527
It's warm in here, isn't it?

1191
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:17,326
<i>I think I'd better take this off.
It's so warm.</i>

1192
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:25,203
Isn't it silly?
It makes my eyes water.

1193
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:33,171
Now, now, now, now.
What's this?

1194
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:41,481
You are in love with my son,
aren't you?

1195
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:51,159
Sorry. May I have
a handkerchief, please?

1196
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:55,430
Yes, of course.

1197
01:22:57,572 --> 01:23:01,030
Oh!

1198
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:06,308
That's... That's a lamb chop
I stole at the party.

1199
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:09,578
Stop laughing at me.

1200
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:14,179
Let me see.

1201
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:24,261
Your check, sir.

1202
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,970
You've forgotten
to charge for the lamb chop.

1203
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:34,998
<i>Pardon me, sir?
The lamb chop.</i>

1204
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,044
I brought you this?

1205
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:40,980
<i>You don't suppose
I brought it myself, do you?
Oh, no, no, Mr. Reynolds.</i>

1206
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:46,784
<i>But I wouldn't serve
a lamb chop in an ashtray.</i>

1207
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:50,916
<i>I was a little surprised myself.
But I assure you...</i>

1208
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:53,893
Now look here,
I intend to pay for everything I get.

1209
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:57,989
So will you please
put this on the bill?
Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. Reynolds.

1210
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:06,797
Shall we... Shall we dance
before the check comes?

1211
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,343
All right.

1212
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:29,822
What's this?
Oh, the conga.

1213
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,628
It's very simple.
Two, three, kick.

1214
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,635
One, two, three, kick.
Come on, try it.

1215
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:38,228
Kick, one,
two, three, kick.

1216
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:41,434
One, two, three, kick.
One, two, three, kick.

1217
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:45,172
Come on. Wonderful.

1218
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:50,047
One, two, three, kick.
One, two, three, kick.

1219
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:53,110
Oh, look at the old man!

1220
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:03,359
And three weeks ago
they gave him up for dead!

1221
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,910
Ooo! Ooo!

1222
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:34,354
Ooo! Ooo!

1223
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:39,498
Ooo! Ooo!

1224
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:51,543
Where is he, Tom?
Well, he, uh...

1225
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:57,416
Dad! Dad!
Dad, stop!

1226
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,249
For heaven sake!
Jonathan, you can't
do this to me.

1227
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:03,449
I'm not a young man.
This is terrible.
Leave me alone. It's wonderful.

1228
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:07,291
How did you get here?

1229
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:09,353
Come on!

1230
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:12,422
Hey! Where are you going?
Jonathan!

1231
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,434
Don't go!
Jonathan,
you're going with me.

1232
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,561
I'm going to put you
to bed.
Oh, go to bed yourself.

1233
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:18,606
Jonathan. Jonathan!

1234
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:23,666
I just want to make sure
you don't do anything else for me.
You've done enough already.

1235
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:25,736
I beg your pardon.
You talk my father
into coming here,

1236
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,281
then you get him out there
acting like a 10-year-old, hmm?

1237
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,408
Then you have
somebody phone me
to break up the party.

1238
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:33,886
All after you promised to fix things up!
You fixed them up all right! Get out...

1239
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:48,227
<i>You come home with me.!</i>

1240
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,965
I'm going to put you
to bed!
Where did she go?

1241
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,406
What did you let her go for?
Jonathan, come along.

1242
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,812
<i>Aboard.!</i>

1243
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,510
<i>Excuse me.
All aboard.!</i>

1244
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,815
<i>Where's the little yellow one?
Hey, wait!</i>

1245
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,481
Anne, listen to me!
You can't go!
Give me those bags.

1246
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,649
Who says I can't go?
Leave those bags there.

1247
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:13,319
Haven't you caused
enough trouble?
It's Father!

1248
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:16,056
It's probably the end this time.
Please, you've got to come.
He needs you!

1249
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,598
Give me the bags!
Give them to him.

1250
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:21,999
Last night was too much
for him. I know it's...

1251
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,630
Oh! The
little yellow one!
The little yellow one!

1252
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:27,174
Hurry up, get the
little yellow one.
Is that all? Which one?

1253
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,234
The black one!

1254
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:34,680
Lady, the next time
you ain't goin' no place,
why don't you try a plane?

1255
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,981
How is he, nurse?
He's very low.

1256
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:45,753
There is a chance, isn't there?
We've given him an injection.

1257
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:48,091
He may pull through.
We'd better go
right on up.

1258
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:51,859
Don't you want to see
your father first?
My father?

1259
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:55,460
Who's up there?
Why, Dr. Harvey.

1260
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:59,404
- Where's Mr. Reynolds?
- I'm here.

1261
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:14,285
We make a very
handsome couple.
Who?

1262
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:17,153
You and I.
Why, you old...
Do you know what...

1263
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:21,355
You should have
seen the doctor when
he found out I was faking.

1264
01:28:21,429 --> 01:28:25,229
He fluttered to the floor
like an autumn leaf.
Wonderful.

1265
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,268
Wonderful.

1266
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,803
<i>You told me
you'd have this picture destroyed.</i>

1267
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:33,307
Destroyed? If I'd done that,
they'd never have seen it!

1268
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:35,865
<i>They?
Oh, you know, those women.</i>

1269
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:39,606
Those bead-twirlers.
They called just before they left.

1270
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:44,118
They've gone...
I mean, they've gone?

1271
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:46,176
They saw that picture
in the paper.

1272
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:49,382
They said they were
taking the first train
back to Mexico City.

1273
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:52,358
I advised them to take a plane.
It's quicker.

1274
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:56,329
What... What are you
trying to do, marry us off?
Good heavens, no.

1275
01:28:56,397 --> 01:28:58,456
You don't even care
for each other, do you?

1276
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:01,229
Certainly not!
Of course not!

1277
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:03,293
I didn't think so.

1278
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:05,839
Any girl who throws drinks
in people's faces in nightclubs...
fine thing.

1279
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:08,842
You deserved it.
I deserved it?

1280
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:11,174
Yes, you deserved it
and you got it.

1281
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:13,645
What about all those insults
you were handing out last night?

1282
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:16,081
Insults? What about the night
you came in here with all that...

1283
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:18,084
<i>"'Forgive me, Johnny'"stuff?</i>

1284
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:20,143
<i>I had to do that
because I wanted to sing.</i>

1285
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:23,190
<i>What about you pinching girls
in front of your own father?
I was forced into it.</i>

1286
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:26,090
<i>I never pinch girls
in front of my own father,
unless I'm forced into it.</i>

1287
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,128
<i>I don't care why you did it,
it hurt.</i>

1288
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:32,530
<i>What do you want me
to do about it?
Well, you can say you're sorry.</i>

1289
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:37,299
What about the drink?
Well, I'm sorry about that.

1290
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,341
All right, I'm sorry
I pinched you then.

1291
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:42,842
Honest?
Mm-hmm.

1292
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:45,538
Never do it again?
Never.

1293
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:47,638
Promise?
Mm-hmm.

1294
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,683
Johnny!
