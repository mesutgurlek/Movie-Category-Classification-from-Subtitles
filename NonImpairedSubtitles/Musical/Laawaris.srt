00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,968
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. What is the problem?

2
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,868
Sir, I went to search
for you upstairs.

3
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,534
I heard that you were here.

4
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,502
Where is Vidya?
- She hasn't come, sir.

5
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:21,901
This means I have to spend
the night with you?

6
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:24,735
No, sir. I am not so fortunate.

7
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:28,102
Sir, Vidya took time to record
a song at the radio station.

8
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,834
She has asked you to wait for her.

9
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,167
Alright, go on.

10
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,669
Sir. Today is your birthday.
- Yes. So what?

11
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,569
Congratulations, sir!
It's your big day.

12
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,169
So what? - Sir, it's very
cold outside. I swear!

13
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:47,901
It's cold. Take this.

14
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,168
Mr. Kumar, you have a telephone
call from Srinagar.

15
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,435
Hello. Who is this?
- Brother, I'm Sheila speaking!

16
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,101
Sheila baby! How are
you, sweetheart?

17
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:59,934
Brother, I am very angry with you.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,468
Why didn't you call me?

19
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,834
Only the ones who are
far away are called.

20
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,868
You are so close to me.
Why should I call you?

21
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,702
Alright, tell me when
you are coming here.

22
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:11,568
I will need five to six months,
Sheila. Five or six.

23
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,368
Listen, for assisting
you in business. .

24
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,669
. .I am going to search
a husband for you.

25
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,535
An old man?
- Not an old man. An. .

26
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,703
It's my sister. A husband for you.

27
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,868
When I come, I'll prepare
for your wedding.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,868
You'll see that I will get
you married with grandeur.

29
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,000
Will you come for the wedding?

30
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,834
Ok, brother. Bye-bye!

31
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:38,568
Mister, did you hear that?

32
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,868
Brother is searching
a husband for me.

33
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:45,503
He doesn't know that I have
already selected my groom.

34
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,002
I'm sorry. I had a recording
today, so I was delayed.

35
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,968
Come on, your fans
are waiting or you.

36
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,702
Yes, go in. Your fans are waiting.

37
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,434
I have had a habit
of waiting for you.

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,535
Ranvir.
- Come in. - I'll meet you later.

39

Ladies and gentlemen and
people who love me.

Today is the 26th of January.
It's a big day.

41

It's very important for me.

42
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:29,571
On this happy day, I'll
sing a new song for you.

43
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:31,467
I have recorded it today.

44

do when people were around.

Listen to me..
- Lie down quietly.

You were born today, so you
will get a special gift.

Is that my gift?

So is that all you are giving me?

That's for now. Before
your next birthday. .

. .I am going to give
you a exquisite gift.

107
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,435
Is that gift being manufactured
in a factory right now?

108
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,067
You may assume that.

109
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,967
Your next birthday will
be celebrated. .

110

. .not just by two but three people.

111

Is someone accompanying us?

112
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,602
Who will come between us two?

113
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,101
The third person isn't an outsider.

114
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:59,970
He is your relative. The
symbol of our love.

115
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,970
Our child.
- Child?

116
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,168
I loved you, you loved me.

117
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,634
How did a child come between us?

118
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,901
When two lovers truly
Iove each other. .

119
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,600
. .this is what happens.

120
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,636
You aren't joking, right?
You are serious.

121
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,335
Yes. I am certainly serious!

122
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,636
Tell me, do you want
a boy or a girl.

123
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,568
My mind tells me that
it will be a boy.

124
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,135
You talk rubbish! Absolute nonsense!

125
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:37,633
A child and kids. .

126
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,902
Our youth is to have fun,
not for turning parents.

127
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:43,367
Understood? Stop this rubbish.

128
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,606
Are you saying this? You!

129
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,105
This means whatever has happened. .

130
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,403
I am pregnant with your child. .

131
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,367
You have many lovers Vidya.

132
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,402
The gift that they have given you,
you are calling it mine. .

133
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:21,535
Why? Did the truth hurt you?

134
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,268
Why are you staring at me?

135
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,534
Today is 26th of January.

136
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,602
Go and climb onto to the
Red Fort's tall walls.

137
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,469
Shout out that you are
pregnant with my child.

138
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,101
If you still don't feel satisfied. .

139
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:39,901
Radio singer, go to the
radio station and. .

140
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,168
. .sing songs that would defame me.

141
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,637
If you still don't feel calmed,
go consult a good doctor.

142
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,268
You wouldn't have to tell them
your child's father's name.

143
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:01,937
Hi! That was Vidya, right?
The famous singer?

144
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:04,034
Do you have an affair with her too?

145
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,968
No! Don't think about all
that. I only love you.

146
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,333
Won't you wish me?
- oh !

147
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,034
Happy birthday, Ranvir.

148
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:15,136
Vidya, when your brother was
dying, I promised him.

149
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,401
I said I would send you from
this house as a bride.

150
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:19,835
I didn't promise him that
you would be pregnant. .

151
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,502
. .without being wedded and
I would nurture him here.

152
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,834
Brother, if my child would cause. .

153
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,836
. .this house to lose its
dignity and you are. .

154
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,503
. .insulted in society,
I'll leave this house.

155
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,934
Yes! Go away!

156
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,368
I can't take over your ill-fame
and your stain over myself.

157
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,334
Not at all!
- What are you saying?

158
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,400
You say anything you wish.

159
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,035
Listen, Vidya. Your sister-in-law
is still alive.

160
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,568
Till I am here, no one can
remove you from this house.

161
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,234
Go in. I'll take care of everything.

162
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,901
Assume if you would have
a sister or a daughter. .

163
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,834
If something like this
would happen with her. .

164
00:11:58,899 --> 00:11:59,900
. .would you remove her too?

165
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,335
I would not just throw her
out, I would kill her!

166
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,136
I would have buried her
alive! Listen to me!

167
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,767
Is this house, everything will
be done as per my wishes.

168
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,768
Do you understand?
- I can't give Vidya's property. .

169
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,867
. .to a fatherless child.

170
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,969
It appears that all the
servants aren't here!

171
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,267
What are you doing here?

172
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:22,836
Doctor, this..
- Mr. Kumar, please come in.

173
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,868
Where is Sheila, doctor?
- Please come in.

174
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,834
I think you got news
about my arrival.

175
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,234
I came so suddenly that. .

176
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,402
Doctor, she.. - She consumed
poison and committed suicide.

177
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,401
Suicide?
- Yes.

178
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:43,468
She loved a boy. She was pregnant.

179
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,868
That boy cheated her and fled.

180
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,268
We found this note near the corpse.

181
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,167
She didn't commit suicide, doctor.

182
00:12:57,866 --> 00:13:01,436
She has suffered punishment
for my sins.

183
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,900
It's for my sins.

184
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,000
Sheila !

185
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,939
Ranvir, true lovers aren't afraid
to give up their lives.

186
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,837
She was truly in love.
My love is true too.

187
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,771
Ranvir, to get something we
have to lose something.

188
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:37,969
You got everything, still
you have lost it.

189
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:42,437
I lost everything but have
still got everything!

190
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:53,069
No. No! I won't let that happen.

191
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,233
I won't let that happen.

192
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:07,234
Its 25000, Gangu.
- Really?

193
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,768
You wanted to go to Mumbai
and drive a taxi, right?

194
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,302
Yes. - This money will
fulfill your desire.

195
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:15,202
Really? - You will take this
fool with you as well.

196
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:19,770
Sir, for this amount, I could
take all the fools in town.

197
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,269
I have been fortunate. It's as
though I have won a lottery.

198
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:26,335
You are my dearest!

199
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,000
Do something.
- Yes.

200
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,133
Take him and run away quickly.

201
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,302
Sir, what do I do after that?

202
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,633
You may nurture him, throw him at. .

203
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,968
. .a dirty spot or put
it on a railway line.

204
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,802
No sir. I won't commit a murder.

205
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:40,367
The police here are very clever.

206
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,634
If I am caught, I'll
reveal everything. .

207
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,768
. .before being tortured. Yes!

208
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,035
Alright! Take this fool
and bring him up.

209
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:54,873
He isn't a fool, sir.
I know his father.

210
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,734
You know him?
- Yes!

211
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,035
Who is he?
- It's useless, sir.

212
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,035
The doctor's certificate
will be proved false.

213
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,068
The police too will
be involved more.

214
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:06,901
The one who had to go has left, sir.

215
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,300
Vidya has gone too.

216
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:11,302
The play is over. The curtain
has been lowered.

217
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,668
Now only he is remaining, sir.

218
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,636
Sir, from today he isn't a fool.

219
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,067
He belongs to Gangu.

220
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:25,304
I love kids a lot. I will
give him enough affection.

221
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:29,570
I'll beat him so much that
he will be hardened.

222
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,601
Ok, ok! You may leave now.

223
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:38,072
You are too late. She has died.

224
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:43,136
I heard that she gave
birth to a dead child.

225
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,669
Kailashrao has gone to cremate her.

226
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,269
His wife has gone to her
parents' place in Mumbai.

227
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,067
Give me any message
that you might have.

228
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:53,733
I'll tell my employer.

229
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,701
Be quiet now. Shut up!

230
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,903
I only have liquor with me.
I don't have milk.

231
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,802
I'll feed you if I get some milk.

232
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,002
I swear by God, I'll feed you.

233
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,034
Sister. Sister!

234
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,068
Give him a little milk.

235
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,967
Alright.

236
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:57,237
''The one who has brought you in
this world will bring you up.''

237
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,502
''He will bring you up.''

238
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,938
''The one who has brought you in
this world will bring you up.''

239
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:11,670
''Everywhere, he will save
us from injustice.''

240
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:16,170
''For his devotees.. ''

241
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:21,504
''He is never separated
from his devotees.''

242
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:28,806
''The one who has no one
has God's company.''

243
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:31,068
''He has God, friends.''

244
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,934
''He has God, friends.''

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,801
Bless you, postman.

246
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:38,836
Keep bringing money for me and
I'll keep drinking liquor.

247
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,067
Here.
- Salutations, sir. - Have fun.

248
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,668
Kailashnath, I praise you.

249
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,901
Father, I'm hungry. Give me bread.

250
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,002
Get lost. You always
keep asking for food.

251
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,102
I don't have enough for drinks.
How will I buy food?

252
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,834
Get lost now!

253
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:11,503
Go and get some food by begging.

254
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,102
Heera, you are better
than my father.

255
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:48,800
You have brought bread for me.

256
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:56,870
''When man's injustice
crosses a limit. ''

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,836
''When it crosses the limit.''

258
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,571
''When man's injustice
crosses a limit. ''

259
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:11,404
''He comes to us in some other form.''

260
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:15,770
''In innumerable forms. .''

261
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:20,937
''In innumerable forms, he
has met us, friends.''

262
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:23,435
''The one who doesn't have anyone. .''

263
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,438
''The one who has no one
has God's company.''

264
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,801
''He has God, friends.''

265
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:35,836
Munni, tell me this. How
many years was Ram exiled?

266
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,669
Well.. for two years.

267
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:42,035
What? How many years did I tell you?

268
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:44,800
Four years.

269
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,467
14 years.

270
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:50,701
Come here. Come.

271
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,502
How did you find out that Ram
was exiled for 14 years?

272
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,737
When you teach her, I listen
to you by hiding here.

273
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,767
Oh! - Forgive me. I won't
listen to you again.

274
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,367
No! Do listen to me.

275
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:10,603
Why do you do this work?
- For food.

276
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,035
Why? Don't you have any relative?

277
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,836
I do. A dog, my father and me.

278
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,534
Our family is restricted to three.

279
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,534
What is your name?
- Heera.

280
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,368
I wasn't named by my father.

281
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:25,402
My dog's name is Heera.
So I named myself as him.

282
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:27,334
Professor, may I tell you something?

283
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:30,302
Yes.
- Heera knows many languages.

284
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,669
Really? Child, from where did
you learn these languages?

285
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,602
I work for varied people.

286
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:39,401
They are Bengali,
Gujarati or Madrasi.

287
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,501
They abuse me in their language.

288
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,801
I understand them. I learnt
it in that way.

289
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:47,836
Alright, child. Read a little
when you get time.

290
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:51,302
I do want to learn but I don't
have money to buy a book.

291
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,835
I'll give you a book,
Heera. Take this.

292
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,769
Take it. I'll tell my grandma
and get another book.

293
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:00,568
Keep it, Heera. I'll
get her another.

294
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,634
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

295
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,868
This is your salary for the month.

296
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,468
I swear! Madam, I have
told you many times.

297
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,735
Don't give him money.
You'll spoil him.

298
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,867
What are you hiding?

299
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:17,335
Are you stealing?
- I didn't steal!

300
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,634
I gave him the book.

301
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,369
Bring the book here.
- I won't give it to you. - Come!

302
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,401
Get a strong Ahmedabad tea!

303
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,302
Sir!
- Greetings. - Sit here.

304
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:28,467
Do you want a Rasgulla
(Indian sweet)?

305
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:29,800
Get a Samosa.
- Samosa (snack)?

306
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,968
Get a Samosa for the Bengali man.

307
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,367
What do you want?

308
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:36,335
A special. Quickly.
- A special! Quickly.

309
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,302
Sir, didn't you get your yoghurt?
- No, it hasn't come.

310
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,668
What's going on? Give
him his yoghurt.

311
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,602
He's getting it. He's getting it.
- A famous song.

312
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:48,635
''You don't have any,,work
in my territory.

00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:19,172
''You don't have any,,work
in my territory.

314
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:22,502
Have you come here for
work or for dancing?

315
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,402
Is the person singing, your mother?

316
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:26,667
I don't know that, sir.

317
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,635
Whenever this song comes on air,
something happens to me.

318
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,767
Something happens to you!

319
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,335
These plates are lying here.
Who will wash them?

320
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:34,833
Pick them up!

321
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,635
Look, sir. I am alone now.

322
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:38,667
Earlier I had my dog, Heera.

323
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,202
I would give him the plates.
He would lick and clean them.

324
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,768
Now he is dead.
- Dead?

325
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,467
Your dog used to clean the plates?

326
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:48,702
What are you saying?
- Sir, don't hurt me.

327
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:51,668
Otherwise I'll pick all these
plates and hit you with them.

328
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,568
What rubbish!
- Leave it.

329
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:56,402
I don't want your job. I
have seen.. - Get lost.

330
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,337
Come here. Write your name.

331
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,233
Your father's name.

332
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:09,201
Will I work or my father?

333
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,500
Why do you want my father's name?

334
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:13,101
You will do the work
but it is required.

335
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:14,234
Father's name is required.

336
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:18,603
Write it.
- Tell me.

337
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:21,369
Gangu Ganpat.

338
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,233
Did you write that?

339
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,434
Why are you talking so arrogantly?

340
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,169
I am not arrogant, it's my style.

341
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:30,101
Really? If you want
to work here be. .

342
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,735
. .a little soft in your
style. Understand?

343
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,102
This is my cool style. If
I behave rudely with you. .

344
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,768
. .you would start shaking.
Understand?

345
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,335
Alright. Come on, sign here.

346
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,369
Sit here. The foreman will tell
you what is to be done.

347
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,368
Heera, wait for five minutes.

348
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:06,401
Do you have cotton in your ears?

349
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,501
Didn't you hear the company's
bell just rang?

350
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:11,135
I am a foreman. You
have to listen to me.

351
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,536
You may be a foreman, a
five-man or a watchman.

352
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:18,435
Once the company's bell rings,
I don't know any man.

353
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,567
Understand?

354
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:24,235
May God cause you to be ruined!

355
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,369
Brother Gaffur. Whom
are you abusing?

356
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,401
Heera, what do I say?

357
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:34,304
I asked this man 2000 rupees
for my daughter's wedding.

358
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:37,402
As an advance. He refused to pay me.

359
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,203
Brother Gaffur, you don't
know how to ask.

360
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,100
How to ask?

361
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:47,670
Son, when I came to this company,
I was as tall as you.

362
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:52,337
Working for 30 years, I have
shrunk to this height.

363
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:56,536
If you work for 30 years, you
will be shorter than me.

364
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,368
You teach me about ways?

365
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:01,669
Brother Gaffur, my style
is different. Look.

366
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:03,967
If you want clarified
butter from a tin. .

367
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:06,535
. .you have to bend you
fingers a little.

368
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,968
If you want to get money
from such a rich man. .

369
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,168
. .you would have to
be a little bent.

370
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:15,269
Son, I am a poor man.
How can I cheat him?

371
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,600
The same old hollow dialogue!

372
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,402
That's the fault in labourers.

373
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:24,070
We call ourselves as poor. We
believe that we are helpless.

374
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,200
Then we move around.

375
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:27,502
Rich people look at
this and exploit us.

376
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,301
Brother Gaffur, wait here.

377
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,201
I'll show you how to
get money from him.

378
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,534
No! Son, I don't like fighting.

379
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,635
I won't fight, brother Gaffur.

380
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:44,105
If our work can be done through
a talk, why fight? Look.. there. .

381
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:47,235
Tell me clearly! What
do you want to say?!

382
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,567
I'm telling you, sir.

383
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,535
One inspector and four
constables came here.

384
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,968
They saw the truck and stopped it.

385
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:56,135
They peeped into the truck
and saw illegal goods.

386
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,901
I escaped from there.
The inspector said. .

387
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:05,503
. .that he confiscates this
truck and the goods inside.

388
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:06,901
You don't pay the tax and get your. .

389
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,534
. .goods out from the exit gate.

390
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:14,602
Sir, you were fortunate.
I was sitting there.

391
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:18,369
Otherwise you wouldn't be sitting
here today but in jail.

392
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,969
You mean, the police
took away our truck?

393
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:26,170
Yes! Have I been telling you
a movie's story till now?

394
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:28,067
When did this take place?

395
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:33,104
Sir, when the sun sets and
before it rises, its night.

396
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,235
I don't have a watch
to tell you the time.

397
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,201
This incident has taken place, sir.

398
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:42,304
Still, I have flattered and
requested to the inspector.

399
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:46,570
Sir, I am your employee. Why would
I have you sent to the jail?

400
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,368
What happened then?
- What then?

401
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:52,169
He doesn't agree with
a few requests.

402
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:56,570
I kept flattering him, he agreed
and we sealed the deal.

403
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,167
Then he said, 5000.

404
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,470
He wants 5000 otherwise your
company will be doomed.

405
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:08,269
Sir, he will send his
constables here.

406
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:12,469
Give them the money
and avoid trouble.

407
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,138
Come here. There he is.

408
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:24,401
Did you see that? He is the
inspector's constable.

409
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:27,935
Go and give him the money.

410
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,367
What did you say your name was?

411
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,334
Heera.
- Yes, Heera.

412
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,472
Yes, sir.
- Take 5000 and get it done.

413
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,968
Sir, why do you bring
me into all this?

414
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,935
I haven't been arrested yet.

415
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,067
My name will enter the police diary.

416
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,200
That would be a problem, sir.

417
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,835
It will be alright. If
there is some problem. .

418
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,168
. .I am here for you. Take this.

419
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:58,304
Sir, I like you a lot. Hence,
I'm doing all this.

420
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:01,202
Otherwise if it were someone else,
I wouldn't even spit. .

421
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:03,835
Sorry sir. I spat a little.

422
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,867
Greetings!

423
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:12,369
May God keep you safe. 1, 2, 3..

424
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,470
Until you don't pay the earlier
debt, you won't get money.

425
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,906
Forget about a debt! My
Heera has come. My son!

426
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:33,371
My dearest boy!
- What is it, father?

427
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,935
How did you change suddenly?

428
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,036
Do you have a little money?
I have to repay a debt.

429
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:42,900
Are you thirsty?

430
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:48,069
You are speaking sweetly
because you want liquor.

431
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,801
From today, you won't have liquor.

432
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,069
You don't know the value of liquor.

433
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,468
You idiot! You have never drunk!

434
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,770
Give me a little money. I'll
die if I don't get liquor.

435
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,035
Drinking liquor everyday would
cause you slow death.

436
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:04,167
Look, father.

437
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:09,203
From my childhood till this day,
you drank from my earnings.

438
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:10,833
From today, you won't get. .

439
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,434
. .anything for liquor, understand?

440
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,304
Pay me quietly. Otherwise
I'll beat you up!

441
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,801
You'll hit me.
- A lot!

442
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,838
Look father. You spent your
entire life as a drunkard.

443
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,702
You may have forgotten that
Heera was smaller. .

444
00:29:31,766 --> 00:29:34,869
. .compared to you earlier but
is now taller than you are.

445
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:37,434
You have hit me and made me strong.

446
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:41,869
Now I'll hit you once
and flatten you!

447
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:45,369
Understand?
- Go away! Are you scaring me?

448
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,868
I brought you up all these years.

449
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,936
Now that I am old, are you
showing me your strength?

450
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:54,935
You idiot! After all you
are someone else's child.

451
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,935
If you were my son, you
wouldn't say this to me.

452
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,868
Other's child?
- That's right!

453
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:06,401
If you were my son, would
you not give me liquor?

454
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:15,138
No, you are lying.
You are my father.

455
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:18,068
You want to take money
from me for drinks.

456
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:19,200
That is why you are lying.

457
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:20,700
Tell me that you are lying.

458
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:23,869
I swear! I don't want your money.

459
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:27,435
I thought you would
grow to support me.

460
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,336
You have become my enemy, you idiot!

461
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,204
Who are my parents, then?

462
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:38,767
You are from the gutter!

463
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:42,102
These people eat food and throw
Ieftovers in the gutter.

464
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,034
You are their leftover.

465
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,235
No! No!

466
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:55,039
Which rich man's leftover
am I? Tell me.

467
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,737
Who gave birth to me and left
me to live in dire straits.

468
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:02,667
Tell me.
- I won't tell you.

469
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:05,335
Tell me. Tell me!

470
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,068
I swear by God! I won't tell you!

471
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:13,906
Tell me or I'll kill you!
Tell me! Tell me!

472
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:17,069
I won't tell you, you
fool! I never will.

473
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:19,935
You didn't give me liquor.

474
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,901
I won't tell you about your father.

475
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,068
I'll die but I will never tell you!

476
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:49,867
Oh Lord! What are you doing?

477
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:51,634
Where is that paper on which my. .

478
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,168
. .father's name has been written?

479
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:55,134
Why do you want it? For what reason?

480
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,202
Don't ask me. Just get that book.

481
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,667
I'll give it. I'll give.

482
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:03,670
Take this.

483
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,901
Here.
- Pen.

484
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,067
Pen !

485
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,867
You cut your father's name?

486
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:22,936
Not just his name. Assume
that I have killed him.

487
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:25,867
My father is dead!

488
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:30,303
I don't have a father!
I don't have anyone!

489
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,635
I am alone. I am without anyone.

490
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:39,004
I am an orphan! An orphan!

491
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,904
''If He so wishes. .''

492
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,938
''If he wishes to, he tests angels.''

493
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:03,837
''He creates us, destroys us
and then creates us again.''

494
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,670
''A man breaks down. .''

495
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:10,635
Stop it! Stop singing!

496
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,501
I have been hearing this
from my childhood. .

497
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:16,635
. .that there is a God.
Where is your God?

498
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:20,501
This is a lie! Everything
that has been. .

499
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,668
. .written in your book is a lie.

500
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,101
The truth is before you!

501
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:31,603
Some people in this world use
us like counters in a game.

502
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:34,568
This is the truth.
- No, son. No!

503
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,769
The one, who is the creator,
knows it.

504
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:43,503
If he has hurt you today,
tomorrow he'll. .

505
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:49,805
. .heal you in such a way that
you won't be hurt ever again.

506
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:55,770
If you don't believe in him
today, you will someday.

507
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:57,867
You certainly will!

508
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:03,037
Oh God! Have mercy on
this child of yours.

509
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,967
Have mercy!

510
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,904
Heera.. are you upset
about something?.

511
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,101
I had been hurt a long
time ago, friend.

512
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,036
Now my heart's fire is more
heated than a fire.

513
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:25,769
Chuttan, why are you crying?

514
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,602
This poor guy's father
died yesterday.

515
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,000
He's drinking since the morning.

516
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,735
Yesterday your father died
and you are still crying.

517
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,170
I have just killed my father.
Am I crying?

518
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,834
They don't care about the
people who are living.

519
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,534
They cry for the ones who have died.

520
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,501
Until when will you cry?

521
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:54,468
Your father has died today.
Tomorrow your uncle will die.

522
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:56,668
Then it will be your grandparents.

523
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:57,834
Will you keep crying for everyone?

524
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:03,736
I'll tell you something.

525
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:08,570
They are all fake relations,
understand?

526
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:13,670
They fulfill their relations for
a while then they leave us.

527
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:18,770
Break it. Break these relations!

528
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:21,802
Live as an orphan the
way I am living.

529
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:26,501
You son of a coffin-stealer!

530
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:28,867
You're crying for your
father's death.

531
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:33,734
You have spoilt my mood.

532
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,867
Why did you stop? Dance!

533
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:42,733
It's because I have come, sir.

534
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:49,371
When I come to a place,
all its doors are shut.

535
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:52,669
Who is he?
- He asks about me!

536
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:53,900
I'll tell you, sir.

537
00:37:53,966 --> 00:37:56,868
I'll tell you, sir.
- What are you doing? What?

538
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:58,234
Firstly, you are broke.
When a rich man. .

539
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:04,502
Why?
- Today, I am not broke, aunt.

540
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:06,467
Look, here. I have brought notes.

541
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:08,301
Oh! Did you win a lottery?

542
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:09,533
I didn't win a lottery, aunt.

543
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:12,568
Today is a big day in my life.

544
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,769
I had a father who died today.
So I am very happy.

545
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:17,867
Today, I'll dance and
make others dance too.

546
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,535
He says he'll dance and sing!

547
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,235
Yes! I'll sing and dance!

548
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,436
I want to give sorrow
to my father's soul.

549
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,234
You will do the same.

550
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,802
The day your father dies,
you will do the same.

551
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:33,167
The only difference will
be that you will first. .

552
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:35,735
. .fake crying before the public.

553
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,501
Then you'll collect
your father's money.

554
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,334
You'll come here secretly.

555
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,436
You will disown your father's
soul. Am I right?

556
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,602
It looks as though you are
going to be killed too.

557
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:47,201
I was close to death many times.

558
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,468
Whenever it came, it
went back defeated.

559
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:51,501
I have left it to the
graveyard many times.

560
00:38:51,566 --> 00:38:54,235
Heera, what are you doing?
Use your presence of mind.

561
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,502
Move back! I'll take care of him.

562
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:57,667
Tell me, will you leave or not?

563
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,269
Friend, I am like the tail of a dog.

564
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:05,834
Even if it is held straight
for 12 years. .

565
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:08,768
Anything would happen but
I won't be straightened.

566
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,568
You can't straighten me!

567
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,501
Isn't that so?
- Look. .

568
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,203
If I use this, you're dead.

569
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:21,435
Your relatives will weep..
your parents. .

570
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,501
I don't care, I have no one.

571
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,234
No one after me or before me.

572
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,169
I don't have anyone
who would cry for me.

573
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,636
Hollow people like you
could die by this gun.

574
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,602
I think that its bullet
is like a peppermint.

575
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,733
Look at this.

576
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,535
''In some way. .''

577
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,834
''Somehow or the other. .''

578
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,101
''In some way. .''

579
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,201
''Somehow or the other. .''

580
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:12,401
''I will spend my life.''

581
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,704
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

582
00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:20,836
''How will you do it?''

583
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,368
''I don't have anyone after me.''

584
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:27,701
''None at all.''

585
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,102
''I don't have anyone after me.''

586
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,167
''None at all.''

587
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:39,104
''No one to cry after I die.''
- ''Neither a man nor a woman.''

588
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:45,205
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

589
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:16,471
''You are the young one
of a human as I am.''

590
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,268
''You are a prayer that
has been heard.''

591
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:23,203
''I am an unwanted favour.''

592
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:32,574
''You are the young one
of a human as I am.''

593
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:37,036
''You are a prayer that
has been heard.''

594
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:41,437
''I am an unwanted favour.''

595
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:50,240
''The world takes me
to be an orphan.''

596
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:57,038
''It is a world that
has been formed. .

597
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,135
. .by cruel people such as you.''

598
00:41:59,366 --> 00:42:01,701
''Your abusive language. .''

599
00:42:03,699 --> 00:42:06,202
''Appears to be a blessing to me.''

600
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,167
''Your abusive language. .''

601
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:12,434
''Appears to be a blessing to me.''

602
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,703
''If I give a blessing it
appears to be an abuse.''

603
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:21,337
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

604
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:25,236
''How will you do it?''

605
00:42:47,266 --> 00:42:55,307
''It is unlikely that there'll ever
be sweat on your forehead.''

606
00:42:56,033 --> 00:43:03,974
''That will be a highly improbable.''

607
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:12,507
''Your sweat is more valuable
than our blood.''

608
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:21,541
''Our blood is deemed
to be worthless.''

609
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:24,035
''My blood is similar to water.''

610
00:43:26,266 --> 00:43:28,401
''It won't make a difference
whether I live or die.''

611
00:43:30,466 --> 00:43:32,501
''My blood is similar to water.''

612
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,634
''It won't make a difference
whether I live or die.''

613
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:39,236
''I know about all the blows
that time may give.''

614
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:43,637
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

615
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:47,336
''How will you do it?''

616
00:43:48,033 --> 00:43:50,135
''In some way. .''

617
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:52,335
''Somehow or the other. .''

618
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:54,401
''In some way. .''

619
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,535
''Somehow or the other. .''

620
00:43:56,633 --> 00:43:58,901
''I will spend my life.''

621
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,170
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

622
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:06,936
''How will you do it?''

623
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,468
''I don't have anyone after me.''

624
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:11,902
''None at all.''

625
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:13,934
''I don't have anyone after me.''

626
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,035
''None at all.''

627
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:20,938
''No one to cry after I die.''
- ''Neither a man nor a woman.''

628
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:27,038
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

629
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:39,436
Wow! You were fantastic! Well
done, mister.. - Heera.

630
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,902
Yes, Mr. Heera. You
are a real jewel.

631
00:44:41,966 --> 00:44:43,033
Why are you here in this town?

632
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:44,568
This place doesn't suit you.

633
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:47,068
Sir, this world doesn't
suit me either.

634
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:48,834
I thought about leaving it but. .

635
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,969
. .I have to find some people.

636
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:56,170
Mr. Heera, my mind tells me
you are sure to succeed.

637
00:44:56,466 --> 00:45:01,103
Sir, my mind tells me that
someday you will be dead.

638
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,834
Alright, I'm leaving.
We'll meet again.

639
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,868
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. Come on.

640
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:11,369
Aunt, I sang a song. Something. .

641
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,167
Sir, what do we do about him?

642
00:45:13,433 --> 00:45:17,203
He is alone. We can
make him do anything.

643
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,902
Pay him some money and get
him to me immediately.

644
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,203
Darling, why are you giving
me beer and spoiling me?

645
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:32,900
Greetings, sister-in-law.

646
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,868
Is she your sister-in-law?

647
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,035
Brother, your wife is
like my sister-in-law.

648
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:40,334
No, Heera. She isn't my wife.

649
00:45:40,766 --> 00:45:43,034
You mean without a license..
- Yes.

650
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:45,467
Ram.
- Yes.

651
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:47,867
Heera, what will you drink?

652
00:45:47,966 --> 00:45:49,334
Nothing, sir. Tell me,
what do you want?

653
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:53,836
What work can you do?
- Any work, sir.

654
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:56,402
Anything other than what
you were doing right now.

655
00:45:57,133 --> 00:46:00,336
If I get money, I can use
my hands or a knife.

656
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:01,901
I can even bash up a few people.

657
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,036
Very good, very good. Will you
accompany me to Kashmir?

658
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,769
Why just Kashmir? I am ready
to go anywhere with you.

659
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,102
Heera, I have a vacant
position of a manager.

660
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:13,768
You may have a position of
a manager or a damager.

661
00:46:13,866 --> 00:46:15,167
It's alright with me, sir, only. .

662
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,301
Yes, you will get that too!

663
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:18,867
Heera, there is one thing.

664
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:22,869
You will have to change
your way of speaking.

665
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,768
Don't worry about my language, sir.

666
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,434
I look at a person
and speak accordingly.

667
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:29,869
There is no language in India
which I can't speak easily.

668
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:33,403
I'll give you an example.

669
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:38,068
Greetings, sir.

670
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:40,702
If you don't mind. .

671
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:49,107
. .I would like to present
some poems to you.

672
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,233
Enough, enough!
- Sir, languages from. .

673
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,335
. .the entire India have
still to be used.

674
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:55,702
Dear, my child.

675
00:46:55,766 --> 00:46:57,033
Can't you shut your mouth and. .

676
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:59,702
That's enough, Heera! I understand.

677
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:01,801
You really are a man
of importance for me.

678
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:04,869
Heera, you will have to change
your attire as well.

679
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:09,637
Sir, these days people may leave
their parents for money.

680
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:11,167
It won't be difficult
to change my attire.

681
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,634
I'll transform to such
an extent that you'll. .

682
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:15,234
. .find it difficult to recognise me.

683
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:17,800
One last thing.

684
00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:23,003
I need a return ticket.
- Return ticket?

685
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,637
Yes. This is because if I
don't like your business. .

686
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:29,168
. .I want to return from there.

687
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:33,269
Heera, I like that. You'll
get a return ticket too.

688
00:47:33,366 --> 00:47:37,002
Here's some money, do
something about your look.

689
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:44,068
Bless you, my dear!

690
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:47,734
'You look amazing! '

691
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:51,702
'Clothes can change man
to a great extent.

692
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,134
A short while ago,
I was called Heera.

693
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:59,102
'Now I really look like a jewel# 

694
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:04,301
Brother, may I tell you something?

695
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:07,635
Mahinder has completely changed you.

696
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:09,201
You have been given a new look.

697
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:11,601
Do you get me?
- Shut up, you fool!

698
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:14,868
Mahinder may have changed me.

699
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,636
You'll see that I will
help him someday.

700
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:18,934
Patil !
- Yes.

701
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,801
Pack the clothes.
- I have done that.

702
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:21,933
What should I do about this?

703
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,234
What is to be done about
this? Throw it away.

704
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:29,738
This will be with me.
- What will we do that?

705
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,901
This is my self-respect.

706
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:36,835
Man should never forget who he is.

707
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,636
Your clothes are all fake.

708
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:43,802
This is a real cloth as
it shows my poverty.

709
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:46,601
It is like skin from my body.

710
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,937
It is my shroud. A black shroud.

711
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:52,734
Do you get me?

712
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,169
Give me something, sir.
Please give me. .

713
00:49:02,233 --> 00:49:04,001
Have you been fooled by my clothes?

714
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,135
I am not a rich man. I belong
to the same stature as you.

715
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,601
Wait, let me see.

716
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,867
Hold this.

717
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,535
I don't have spare change.
Give that.

718
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,601
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

719
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:23,501
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

720
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:25,001
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh! -Come here.

721
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:26,901
Whom are they chanting for?
-Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

722
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:28,701
He is a rich man living here.
-Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

723
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:32,569
Every year he gives lakhs of
rupees to the poor as alms.

724
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:37,570
What are you doing here? Go there.
- Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

725
00:49:37,633 --> 00:49:39,501
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

726
00:49:39,566 --> 00:49:41,234
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

727
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:51,537
Friends, I am not worthy of praise.

728
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:58,171
An orphan and its likes.
Trouble for the society.

729
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,868
I hate such words.

730
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,501
By behaving well with such people. .

731
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:09,504
. .by giving them food, clothing
and shelter to live. .

732
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:13,803
. .people think that they
have done their duty.

733
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:18,970
No. They don't just need
food and clothing.

734
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,636
They are hungry for
Iove and affection.

735
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:29,704
Love them. Move ahead
and embrace them.

736
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,067
Stop!

737
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:35,169
If you are so compassionate,
then embrace me too!

738
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,668
I too will have a father like you.

739
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:41,837
Who are you?
- An orphan! A real orphan!

740
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:45,235
Leave him. - Where
did he come from?

741
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:49,603
Come here, son. Come here
and say what you want to.

742
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:04,636
Come, child. Speak here.

743
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:06,933
What should I say, sir?

744
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:13,504
All I want to say is that in
my childhood, I read a book.

745
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:17,435
At nights, a dacoit would
steal from the people and. .

746
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,537
. .during the day he would return
their stuff back to them.

747
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,902
People would praise him
and touch his feet.

748
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:28,168
I couldn't understand whether
he was a thief or a holy man.

749
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:30,767
I will say another thing.

750
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:34,435
The municipality that creates
a town keeps a. .

751
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:38,436
. .garbage dump everywhere
in the city.

752
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,801
So that the city is clean.

753
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,437
Similarly, these rich people,
for throwing their garbage. .

754
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,501
. .create an orphanage or an ashram.

755
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,701
I didn't mean to say
that for you, sir.

756
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,167
I will say one more thing!

757
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,434
The Creator should
have made a meter. .

758
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,501
. .on everyone's forehead.

759
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,701
. .so that he would have his
father's name on his forehead.

760
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:05,368
The world would know
which rich man. .

761
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,504
. .is this orphan's father.
Now tell me.

762
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:13,368
Old age homes and orphanages
that have been made from. .

763
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:15,501
. .donations from rich people
should imprison which people?

764
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,769
These innocent folk
or those rich people.

765
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:22,469
They have given birth to such
orphans and left them!

766
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,001
That's all, sir. I only
wanted to say that.

767
00:52:28,766 --> 00:52:30,634
Forgive me if I said
something wrong.

768
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:32,968
I am an orphan. I said whatever
came to my mind.

769
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,034
Now, I'm leaving.

770
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:52,600
Greetings.
- Greetings.

771
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:55,034
Do you have something to
eat? I'm very hungry.

772
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:57,402
Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Excuse me, sir.

773
00:52:57,699 --> 00:52:59,568
Hello! Yes, I'm speaking. Yes.

774
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:02,767
A packet of dog biscuits.

775
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:04,633
Will you have it here
or take it home?

776
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:05,767
What did you say?
- No.

777
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:11,636
Here.
- Take this and keep the change.

778
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:13,834
Your father has ample
money to be wasted.

779
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,434
Did you say something to me?

780
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,368
No. I didn't speak to you.

781
00:53:26,566 --> 00:53:28,734
What are you doing, sir?
They're dog biscuits!

782
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:30,767
That's alright, brother.

783
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:33,735
I am more connected to
dogs than to humans.

784
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:36,768
Here's the money and
keep the change.

785
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:42,036
That's strange.
- I forgot my biscuits.

786
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:43,600
Strange man!

787
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:45,300
Today, for the first time
in twenty years someone. .

788
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:51,305
. .said such harsh words which
made all the events. .

789
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:55,703
. .of my past come before
me, one by one.

790
00:53:56,433 --> 00:54:01,371
It was as though someone was
reading a book of my story.

791
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,536
Who said all this? Who was that man?

792
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,235
He was a young man. I was so
Iost in what he was saying..

793
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,302
. .that I didn't even ask
what his name was.

794
00:54:11,866 --> 00:54:14,368
You are lost in the
words of the world.

795
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,771
My son would keep shouting
and I would keep crying. .

796
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:22,635
You just don't care about it.
You don't even look at us.

797
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:23,733
May I come in?

798
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:33,469
You? - It appears I have
got a wrong address.

799
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:36,502
I had come to meet Mr. Mahinder.

800
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:39,335
No! You have come
to the right place.

801
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:41,968
This is where Mahinder
stays. Come in.

802
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,603
Child, he is the same young
man about whom I told you.

803
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,234
He is nothing compared to my son.

804
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:59,303
Kamini, use your presence
of mind before speaking.

805
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:03,534
Call your brother.
- Yes, father.

806
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:05,900
How did you come by?

807
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:10,904
Mahinder called me.
- Mahinder is my son.

808
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:13,701
Your son?
- Yes. Why?

809
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:16,833
What happened?

810
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,370
No, I just.. he called me
here for a job. - Oh I see.

811
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:21,500
He is that. .

812
00:55:25,266 --> 00:55:27,501
That's like Heera! That's good!

813
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:29,167
Mahinder, for the first
time in your life. .

814
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:31,368
. .you have done something right.

815
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,634
You have brought a right
man to a right place.

816
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:34,767
Thank you, father.

817
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,168
Heera, you have come here
on the right day. .

818
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,701
. .and at the right time.

819
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:43,236
Mahinder, time has never
been nice to me.

820
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,335
Still, I am very punctual.

821
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,401
You appear to have had a deep blow.

822
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,167
In twenty-five years,
I have had less food. .

823
00:55:50,233 --> 00:55:51,500
. .and more of wounds, father.

824
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,235
Wow! What a thing to say!

825
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,368
My son, you have spoken well!

826
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:58,434
I remember an ode at this point.

827
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,135
No one cried at my wedding.

828
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:03,435
I am the only one who cried.

829
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,801
Very good, doctor.
- Thank you.

830
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:07,435
This is my friend, Dr. Goyal.

831
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,468
In my past life, I was a cuckoo.

832
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,836
This time, I have been named
as Goyal by my parents.

833
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:16,303
Mister, what is your name?
- Heera.

834
00:56:17,266 --> 00:56:18,567
You have a shining personality.

835
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:22,536
Young man, you are slightly sad.

836
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:25,502
If you eradicate that, your life
will be full of light. - Harzana.

837
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:31,536
For Heera, vacate the doctor's
dispensary's upper room.

838
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:33,434
He will work from tomorrow.

839
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,534
Explain his work to him as well.

840
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:40,169
Listen, Heera. Meet me sometimes.

841
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:43,668
I stay close to you. I work for you.

842
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:45,267
I will keep meeting you.

843
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:50,434
Do you know about any girl?

844
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,468
Stop the vehicle. Stop it!
- Why?

845
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:53,600
Don't you see? That cart is stuck.

846
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:55,701
Why are you going there?
He is a very rotten man.

847
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,100
If you help him today. .

848
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,437
Do you get me?
- I don't care about the future.

849
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:07,337
The present is more important
for me. Understand?

850
00:57:10,133 --> 00:57:11,200
Please move back.

851
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:14,167
Come on.

852
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:21,668
Very good. Very good.

853
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:26,401
Go ahead!
- Very good. Very good!

854
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:32,267
Thanks a lot, sir.

855
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,034
If you wouldn't have helped
me, I couldn't have. .

856
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:36,168
. .reached the market at the
right time to sell my wares.

857
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:39,668
Do you make clay vessels?
- Yes, sir.

858
00:57:40,033 --> 00:57:42,034
God made us from the earth and for. .

859
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:44,134
. .feeding ourselves we
make earthen vessels.

860
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:47,102
Sir, this is my younger
sister Channo.

861
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,500
Greetings.
- My name is Ram Singh.

862
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:51,101
Yes! Alright! Come along,
sir. It's getting late.

863
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:53,401
ok.
- His long dialogue will never end.

864
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:59,368
So sir, we have come to Chandanwadi.

865
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:01,467
This entire plot is ours.

866
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:08,036
Deals worth lakhs are done
here, in Chandanwadi.

867
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:10,267
This is our wood cutting place.

868
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:12,100
All types of wood is shaped here.

869
00:58:14,466 --> 00:58:16,000
Sir, we have reached.

870
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:21,702
This is one store and there
are four such places.

871
00:58:22,033 --> 00:58:23,968
From today, all these
places and people. .

872
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,267
. .will work under your command.

873
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:27,401
Only your word will
be followed here.

874
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:31,069
This is our new manager! Salute him!

875
00:58:34,433 --> 00:58:37,702
You fools! I'll cut your salary!

876
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,101
Raju! Salute him!

877
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:43,201
Go, do your work.

878
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,336
He is our employee, sir.
He really is an idiot.

879
00:58:52,566 --> 00:58:54,134
He never works honestly.

880
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,702
Now that you have come, you will
set him right. I know it.

881
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,335
Here comes another fool.
What do we do about him?

882
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:07,004
He will be dealt with in the
same way as the others.

883
00:59:07,233 --> 00:59:12,204
Come in, sir. Come. This
is our control tower.

884
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:15,268
You can sit here and keep
a watch on everyone.

885
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,235
Such as what work is
being done by whom.

886
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:19,134
From today, this is your office.

887
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,967
Whose pictures are these?

888
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,567
Sir, these are our former managers.

889
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:33,034
They are all dead now.

890
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,335
Do you see him? He was
Sardar (Sikh) Keher Singh.

891
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,201
He liked roaming about.

892
00:59:41,466 --> 00:59:44,502
He went out for a stroll
one day and was killed.

893
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,270
Look at him. He was
a strict manager.

894
00:59:49,433 --> 00:59:50,934
One day, he left for a round.

895
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:52,901
When he left, he was fine but when. .

896
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:57,270
. .he returned he was dead.
Do you get me?

897
00:59:58,133 --> 01:00:00,401
Look at him. He was a good man.

898
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,434
He would never feel bad
about anything I said.

899
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:04,901
One day he felt offended
about something that. .

900
01:00:04,966 --> 01:00:07,068
. .the labourers said. His picture
came into the frame.

901
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,400
Why is this frame empty?

902
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:13,436
Sir, last time, two frames
were made by mistake.

903
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:18,204
Now you have come.. understand?

904
01:00:19,066 --> 01:00:22,035
Come along, I'll show you
how to work here. - Come.

905
01:00:22,366 --> 01:00:24,034
Work, planning and punishment.

906
01:00:24,133 --> 01:00:25,200
Do you see this?

907
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:26,901
If a person does a minute
mistake, he is to. .

908
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:28,534
. .be beaten with a
small blow, a whip.

909
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,901
If a person does a big
mistake, he is to. .

910
01:00:30,966 --> 01:00:32,033
. .be beaten with a big blow, a rod.

911
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:33,901
If you get a man who
is worse than that..

912
01:00:33,966 --> 01:00:35,300
. .a sword has been kept.

913
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:38,135
Sir, even after that if no
one comes under control. .

914
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:39,500
Follow me then.

915
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:47,904
I'll show you now. This
is our last way.

916
01:00:50,633 --> 01:00:54,370
Use them freely, understand?

917
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,436
From today, you will
keep this. Here.

918
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:03,336
The one who spat outside.
- Mukadam?

919
01:01:03,366 --> 01:01:04,467
Yes.
- Ok.

920
01:01:04,533 --> 01:01:05,934
Send him upstairs.
- In a moment.

921
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,567
Mukadam!
- What is it?

922
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,935
Mukadam, you have been called
by the new manager.

923
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,967
Upstairs.

924
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,167
It looks as though he is doomed.

925
01:01:31,866 --> 01:01:33,067
I'll have to get his photograph too.

926
01:01:35,966 --> 01:01:37,133
He had just arrived and
he is going to die.

927
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:39,568
The poor guy will be killed.

928
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,069
I wanted to promote Mukadam
and make him a manager.

929
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:13,968
I wanted to add his photo
to the empty frame.

930
01:02:14,766 --> 01:02:17,135
When he said that he had three
children, I stopped.

931
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:20,902
I thought that those kids
would turn orphans like me.

932
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:24,900
Harzana.
- Yes, sir.

933
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:31,004
Keep this key. I don't need this.

934
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,770
Put this into his pocket and
when he is conscious. .

935
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:38,769
. .explain to him that my way
of working is different.

936
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,003
Understand? Salute him! Everyone.

937
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:48,900
Where is Mr. Mahinder?

938
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:53,503
He must be worshipping
a Goddess at this time.

939
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:04,138
My darling! These soft hands
are like flowers and velvet.

940
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:06,168
They are not to be used
to clean this car.

941
01:03:06,766 --> 01:03:09,201
They are for caressing
my heart. Come on.

942
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:16,738
My dearest, I don't like blue
soap on your fair cheeks.

943
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:19,702
Today, I'll finish cleaning you up.

944
01:03:21,033 --> 01:03:23,735
Accountant, may I say something?

945
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,003
Your car is 100 years old.
You never sat inside.

946
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:30,935
You have removed the engine
and kept it under your bed.

947
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:33,702
Now why are you being cruel to her?

948
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:36,435
I have told you numerous
times to keep a servant.

949
01:03:37,133 --> 01:03:38,834
Mr. Mahinder Bahadur.

950
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:42,435
I am not so fortunate
to employ servants.

951
01:03:42,933 --> 01:03:47,837
I just have a girl. She might
prove to be lucky to me.

952
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,268
She will.
- Yes.

953
01:03:51,966 --> 01:03:55,069
Accountant, may I go in?

954
01:03:55,366 --> 01:03:59,737
Certainly, young man. Go in.
This is like your house.

955
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:03,233
Thank you.

956
01:04:06,699 --> 01:04:09,636
My chess board! You ruined my game!

957
01:04:09,699 --> 01:04:12,235
Accountant, look before
you set up a game.

958
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,635
Otherwise it will be ruined.
- Who are you?

959
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:16,935
Accountant, he is our
new manager, Heera.

960
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:20,169
Ok, forgive me. My play
was stopped so I. .

961
01:04:20,866 --> 01:04:22,634
Treat him well.
- ok.

962
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:24,801
Mahinder! Mahinder!

963
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:28,834
You? Why did you get him here?

964
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,967
Sir, I haven't brought him. .

965
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,667
No, Mahinder! I came here
by my own accord.

966
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:34,735
I saw all your places. I thought
about seeing this place too.

967
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:36,901
If I have to get to
you in a emergency. .

968
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:38,733
Greetings, sister-in-law.

969
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:40,700
You really are weird!
Whoever you see with me. .

970
01:04:40,766 --> 01:04:42,067
. .you address her as sister-in-law!

971
01:04:42,266 --> 01:04:44,668
What? Did he call someone
else sister-in-law too?

972
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:47,067
No, darling. He has
a habit of joking.

973
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:51,636
Listen, I liked you calling
me as sister-in-law.

974
01:04:52,266 --> 01:04:54,334
Always call me sister-in-law
from now on.

975
01:04:54,866 --> 01:04:56,834
Alright, he will call
you sister-in-law.

976
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,302
Now go in. I have some work. Go.

977
01:05:00,633 --> 01:05:02,134
You will..
- Mr. Mahinder!

978
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:05,134
I have seen your jungle,
house and office.

979
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:06,734
Now explain to me what
work is to be done?

980
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,002
Come here. We own
Iand on Kali Tekdi.

981
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:11,868
Some slum dwellers have
usurped that land.

982
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:13,567
You just have to move
them from there.

983
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,568
You mean, the people
who live there. .

984
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:19,201
. .are to be rendered homeless.

985
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,702
I want to make a brilliant
five-star hotel there.

986
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:29,704
Ok! The poor folk will get a
place to stay in that hotel?

987
01:05:31,066 --> 01:05:32,133
Heera, are you insane?

988
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,768
Will slum dwellers reside
in a five-star hotel?

989
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,569
No. I thought that as
the government says. .

990
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:38,900
Eradicate poverty, break down slums.

991
01:05:38,966 --> 01:05:40,567
Make homes and let the poor stay.

992
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:41,933
Perhaps you thought about the same.

993
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,568
No! I don't have such plans.

994
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:46,935
You mean you don't want to
eradicate poverty but the poor.

995
01:05:48,566 --> 01:05:50,634
I'll remove them.
- Listen.

996
01:05:51,566 --> 01:05:53,067
There is a Hanuman temple.

997
01:05:54,966 --> 01:06:01,005
Oh! Along with humans, you
want to throw out Gods too.

998
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,134
I'll do it.
- That's it!

999
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,167
Sir!

1000
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,501
Sir, should I tell you something?

1001
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:24,669
A miracle has taken place.
Heera has cleared the slum!

1002
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:27,668
Very good! Get out of this room!

1003
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:31,503
ok.
- Did you see my likes, darling?

1004
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,501
Something that couldn't
be done all my life. .

1005
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:34,834
.. Heera did it for me.

1006
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:37,568
I think this man is a real jewel.

1007
01:06:37,633 --> 01:06:38,700
Hail Mahinder!

1008
01:06:38,766 --> 01:06:41,835
Hail Mahinder! Hail Mahinder!

1009
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:45,502
Did you hear that?
- People are praising you. - Me?

1010
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:46,633
Hail Mahinder!

1011
01:06:46,699 --> 01:06:47,967
Hail Mahinder!

1012
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:50,234
Hail Mahinder!

1013
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,101
Hail Mahinder!

1014
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:57,502
Young man, you are being
praised outside my house.

1015
01:06:57,766 --> 01:06:59,100
What deed have you done?

1016
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:03,136
I was just.. I have been
in since morning.

1017
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:08,937
Friends, this is the place.
This is Mahinder.

1018
01:07:08,966 --> 01:07:12,602
Touch his feet! For Mahinder. .

1019
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:14,567
Hail Mahinder!

1020
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:15,700
Hail Mahinder! -Shut up!

1021
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,667
What is this
rubbish, Heera?

1022
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:21,434
Rubbish? There has been
no mistake, sir.

1023
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:23,634
These people have come to thank you.

1024
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:26,434
Thank me for what?

1025
01:07:27,066 --> 01:07:29,435
Sir, you had their huts broken down.

1026
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,768
Then you gave them place to stay
in the accountant's house.

1027
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,869
In my house?
- Yes.

1028
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:37,435
You were ousted by Mahinder yet. .

1029
01:07:37,466 --> 01:07:40,068
. .you want to invade my house?

1030
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:44,869
Accountant, just two and
a half people stay here.

1031
01:07:45,433 --> 01:07:48,836
You, your wife and your daughter..
who is dim-witted.

1032
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:50,867
There is one chess board
and a few counters.

1033
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:52,801
There will be loneliness here.

1034
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:54,434
If these people stay here, there. .

1035
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,701
. .would be some noise and activity.

1036
01:07:55,766 --> 01:07:56,800
Isn't that so? Come, brothers!

1037
01:07:57,433 --> 01:07:58,967
Four people are to get
in one room! Come on!

1038
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,634
No one is to go in!

1039
01:08:01,366 --> 01:08:04,502
Heera, don't mess with
me. Get them out!

1040
01:08:04,733 --> 01:08:06,668
Accountant, why do you worry?

1041
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:10,402
r
When I had to clear Kali Tekdi
I used a bulldozer.

1042
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:12,901
If I want to clear this house,
I'll use a bulldozer again.

1043
01:08:13,566 --> 01:08:14,967
Heera, what is this nonsense!
- Mahinder!

1044
01:08:17,566 --> 01:08:18,633
Father.

1045
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:28,637
Mahinder.
- Father, why have you come here?

1046
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:32,370
Who told you to ruin
this settlement?

1047
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:33,834
You made these poor people homeless.

1048
01:08:34,533 --> 01:08:35,867
Father, I..
- Sir.

1049
01:08:37,433 --> 01:08:38,801
Sir, you are scolding
him without a reason.

1050
01:08:39,466 --> 01:08:41,367
You should embrace him today.

1051
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,701
Mahinder has done such
a big favour to you.

1052
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:45,100
You can't estimate that.

1053
01:08:48,366 --> 01:08:50,367
He has cleared these people's
old huts and. .

1054
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:54,036
. .promised to make a better
colony for them.

1055
01:08:54,366 --> 01:08:56,367
Until that time, he has permitted. .

1056
01:08:58,466 --> 01:08:59,533
Isn't that right, Mahinder?

1057
01:09:01,033 --> 01:09:02,934
Mahinder?
- Yes, father.

1058
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,302
This is the second right
thing that you have done.

1059
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:18,302
Come, brothers! Come on in.

1060
01:09:19,933 --> 01:09:23,803
Four people in a room.
Not more than four.

1061
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,602
Very good. Stay here.
- Young man.

1062
01:09:26,933 --> 01:09:29,302
This man that you have
brought from the city. .

1063
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:33,036
. .if kept here, will harass
you all your life.

1064
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:34,467
Do you understand what harassment is?

1065
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:39,302
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1066
01:09:42,366 --> 01:09:43,433
Go on. Heera?

1067
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:48,436
Sir, I was passing by and felt
like seeing you. So I came.

1068
01:09:48,633 --> 01:09:49,700
Come in.

1069
01:09:50,733 --> 01:09:52,734
You have wasted al your bank
balance in donations.

1070
01:09:53,533 --> 01:09:55,301
Will you keep something
for us or not?

1071
01:09:55,433 --> 01:09:57,301
Why? Everything is alright.
What do we need?

1072
01:09:57,633 --> 01:10:00,302
'Alright?' My son, Mahinder,
will have his birthday soon.

1073
01:10:00,466 --> 01:10:02,034
I want to buy a new
Mercedes for him.

1074
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,367
I want six lakh rupees.

1075
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:05,301
Kamini, your son Mahinder isn't. .

1076
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:08,702
. .so young that he
still needs gifts.

1077
01:10:09,366 --> 01:10:11,334
He is old enough to take the
business into his control.

1078
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,401
To give you from his earnings.

1079
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:15,301
Whenever I ask you for something. .

1080
01:10:15,366 --> 01:10:17,701
. .or for my son Mahinder,
you argue with me.

1081
01:10:17,766 --> 01:10:21,336
I am not arguing. I am telling
you to explain to your son.

1082
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,301
The aim of life isn't
just to move about in. .

1083
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,702
. .air-conditioned cars.
It's something else.

1084
01:10:26,733 --> 01:10:28,301
What's your aim in life?

1085
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,536
To spend lakhs and crores of
rupees to earn false praises?

1086
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,602
Lady, sir is right.
- Shut up!

1087
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:38,703
You're an outsider. Don't dare
to intervene! Understand?

1088
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:43,335
Beggars and orphans!
Will they help you?

1089
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,303
In old age, you will shiver
and be stuck to your bed.

1090
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,336
No orphan such as him
will come to help you.

1091
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:52,301
Then you'll remember your son.

1092
01:10:53,366 --> 01:10:55,601
I don't know where these people
come from for alms.

1093
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:00,733
Alright, sir. I'm leaving.

1094
01:11:02,266 --> 01:11:05,369
Heera.
- Yes, sir?

1095
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:06,800
Heera. .

1096
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:12,903
. .why are you crying for me?

1097
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:19,671
My son has never cried for me.
I am so unfortunate!

1098
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,236
I wish you would have been my son!

1099
01:11:24,699 --> 01:11:25,767
May I come in?

1100
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:33,937
Come, doctor.
- What is it? Your eyes are wet.

1101
01:11:35,366 --> 01:11:41,238
Doctor, I saw Heera
crying and wept too.

1102
01:11:41,633 --> 01:11:43,968
It isn't bad to weep, Mr. Kumar.

1103
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:48,670
They are good for the eyes
and bad for the heart.

1104
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:51,235
I remember that when I was born. .

1105
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,468
. .my father wept miserably.

1106
01:11:53,633 --> 01:11:56,736
Kunwar, at that time I
decided not to marry.

1107
01:11:56,899 --> 01:12:00,169
If I were married today,
I would cry for my son. .

1108
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,602
. .just as you are crying.

1109
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:05,168
Uncle, when you start speaking
you don't stop.

1110
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,169
Tell me, when did father
had to cry due to me?

1111
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,868
I wasn't saying that.

1112
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:13,802
I said that you should take
care of your father.

1113
01:12:13,899 --> 01:12:15,668
Now look, medicines have been
required since two days.

1114
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:16,900
Go to town and get them.

1115
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:19,167
You mean, I stay in this
house just because. .

1116
01:12:19,233 --> 01:12:20,901
. .I am to get medicines from town?

1117
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:24,435
Father, aren't there any retainers
who can help you?

1118
01:12:25,366 --> 01:12:27,901
My friends are waiting for me.
I'm going for hunting.

1119
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:32,503
Go. Doctor, is this medicine
very necessary to be taken?

1120
01:12:32,566 --> 01:12:34,167
Yes.
- Give me that, doctor.

1121
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:38,169
Father, till I am here
in this house. .

1122
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:41,369
. .you don't have to worry
about such work.

1123
01:12:41,766 --> 01:12:44,869
I'll get the medicines.
- The city is far away.

1124
01:12:45,466 --> 01:12:47,835
How far, sir? It is in India, right?

1125
01:12:51,766 --> 01:12:53,901
Pardon me, madam. You
can't take the dog in.

1126
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,201
Mind your own business.
He isn't an ordinary dog.

1127
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,101
Madam. Madam! Excuse me, madam.

1128
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,501
You are not allowed to bring
a dog inside this hotel.

1129
01:13:03,566 --> 01:13:05,734
I don't go anywhere without my dog.

1130
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:09,403
That's good! That
is a very warm dog.

1131
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:11,601
I mean, hot dog.

1132
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,302
Look, madam. Our customers
may object to it.

1133
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,835
We can't trust a dog. He
may dirty this place.

1134
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,602
You don't know this dog.
He is my dog!

1135
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:23,736
He's always with me. Understand?

1136
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:27,702
Look, madam. We don't care what
your dog does with you.

1137
01:13:27,766 --> 01:13:30,235
We can't allow your dog to
come inside this hotel.

1138
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:31,700
What if he causes us a loss?

1139
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:34,368
If he causes you a loss,
I'll pay the money.

1140
01:13:34,633 --> 01:13:36,234
It's very spicy!

1141
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,735
The pepper. These mountain
peppers are too hot!

1142
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:44,302
Madam, I have told you.
- I have told you too.

1143
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,801
My dog will eat with me.

1144
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,737
Add his bill to mine. Thank you.

1145
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:54,701
Madam, we don't let a dog in.

1146
01:13:54,766 --> 01:13:56,134
There is no question of feeding him.

1147
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,568
Stupid.
- What did you say?

1148
01:13:58,433 --> 01:14:00,535
I didn't say that to you but my dog.

1149
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:02,033
His name is stupid.

1150
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,668
However, he is cleverer
than you are.

1151
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:10,635
Listen to me, Stupid.
Wait here for me.

1152
01:14:11,033 --> 01:14:12,334
Don't move and don't be naughty.

1153
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:15,769
Are you married?
- Yes. I have 1 1 kids.

1154
01:14:16,033 --> 01:14:17,567
Yes. You may have 11 kids
but are you married?

1155
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,067
Sir, why are you joking?

1156
01:14:22,433 --> 01:14:24,234
Why don't you have a separate
table for dogs?

1157
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:26,767
I wasn't speaking to you.
I spoke to the manager.

1158
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,601
Manager.
- Yes.

1159
01:14:28,766 --> 01:14:31,034
Why don't you have a separate
table for dogs?

1160
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:34,102
Yes! Have a special table made.

1161
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:35,767
Write upon it that
it's a dog's table.

1162
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:38,335
Very funny! Why don't you
mind your own business?

1163
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:39,500
She's speaking to you.

1164
01:14:54,633 --> 01:14:55,667
Puppy!

1165
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:05,368
Hello puppy! Stupid little puppy!

1166
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,067
Come on, doggy.

1167
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:14,069
Yes! Do you know what this is?

1168
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,301
Waiter! Throw out the dog!

1169
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:28,467
Get in!

1170
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,567
Waiter!

1171
01:15:43,033 --> 01:15:44,200
You idiot!

1172
01:15:44,366 --> 01:15:45,967
Very good, go up!

1173
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:50,133
Well done!

1174
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,367
Come on, run.

1175
01:15:53,433 --> 01:15:54,500
Waiter! - Yes, sir.

1176
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,034
Come to me, Stupid.

1177
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,901
Your dog has ruined the whole hotel.

1178
01:15:59,133 --> 01:16:00,400
He harassed all the customers.

1179
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:03,068
How much damage did he do?
- Damage!

1180
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,367
Take this.

1181
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,267
Madam, it's not about the money.

1182
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:09,967
The customers have been
caused an inconvenience.

1183
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:13,236
The hotel will be defamed.
- Take this.

1184
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,400
Why don't you understand?

1185
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,436
If this isn't enough, call at
my home and order a cheque, ok?

1186
01:16:17,966 --> 01:16:23,504
''Just because you got
a little money.''

1187
01:16:23,566 --> 01:16:26,402
''You think that you are God.''

1188
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:36,341
''Only God would know what
will happen to you now.''

1189
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:39,067
''Why are you so arrogant?''

1190
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,471
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''

1191
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:49,103

about your money?''

away from your loved ones.''

''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''

1196
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:05,835
''Why are you so arrogant?''

1197
01:17:14,566 --> 01:17:21,239
''In big houses filled
with gold and silver.''

1198
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:26,070
''There is more pain
and lesser calm.''

1199
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:30,570
''There is more pain
and lesser calm.''

1200

''Rich people of this age. .''

1201

''They have snatched love
and broken hearts. ''

''They have snatched love
and broken hearts. ''

''However, money isn't everything. ''

1205

''Man is man and money is money.''

1206

''It creates problems in a mind.''

1242
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,701
''This money.. ''

1243
01:20:42,766 --> 01:20:47,203
''This money will take you
away from your loved ones.''

1244
01:20:47,366 --> 01:20:48,900
''It will take you away.''

1245
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,304
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''

1246
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:55,768
''Why are you so arrogant?''

1247
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:00,334
Medicines. Here's the spare.

1248
01:21:00,733 --> 01:21:02,801
Give that to father.
- No!

1249
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:05,636
Before money takes me away
from my loved ones. .

1250
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,868
. .I should separate
myself from money.

1251
01:21:08,066 --> 01:21:10,701
What are you saying, brother?
- The matter is such.

1252
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:15,003
Today, as I was moving about,
I saw a girl like thing.

1253
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,201
A girl like thing?
- Yes.

1254
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:19,368
She appeared to be a girl.

1255
01:21:19,866 --> 01:21:22,635
She was always ready to attack.

1256
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:25,736
She was too short-tempered.
She had her father's money.

1257
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:28,301
You may assume her to be
a moving treasure chest.

1258
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,634
Chest? Whom are you talking about?

1259
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:31,767
The same girl like thing.

1260
01:21:32,133 --> 01:21:35,636
However, I showed such
presence of mind. .

1261
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:37,134
. .that you will see it's result.

1262
01:21:37,899 --> 01:21:39,134
When will I see it?
- Your next life.

1263
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:41,101
Next life?
- Yes.

1264
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:47,036
After today, that girl
will pray to God.

1265
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,903
'O God, don't let me be born
in a rich man's house# 

1266
01:21:55,633 --> 01:22:02,806
'O God, don't let me be born in a.# 

1267
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,703
You? How did you come here?

1268
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:13,569
No, Mohini, Madhu. A girl like thing.

1269
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,936
Yes, Madhu. I am that
girl like thing.

1270
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,636
I am filled with arrogance
due to my father's money.

1271
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:24,902
You're strange. You
are so young and. .

1272
01:22:24,966 --> 01:22:27,902
Shut up! Remember this.

1273
01:22:28,566 --> 01:22:29,633
When someone is a 'somebody'. .

1274
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:31,201
. .he assumes himself to be valuable.

1275
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,102
A homeless beggar won't
be proud of his father.

1276
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:35,767
What?
- Yes.

1277
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,702
If your father has money,
show it off!

1278
01:22:38,899 --> 01:22:39,967
Mohini, please!

1279
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,569
Madhu, you don't know what
this man did today.

1280
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:46,737
This incident today will bring
your family, mother, father. .

1281
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,168
Don't speak against my father.

1282
01:22:48,233 --> 01:22:49,801
You spoke against my father first!

1283
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:52,735
My father has respect and
a position in society.

1284
01:22:53,066 --> 01:22:54,734
He has educated me.

1285
01:22:55,566 --> 01:22:57,501
He has made me capable
of living in society.

1286
01:22:57,899 --> 01:22:59,501
What has your father taught you?

1287
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:02,168
To tease and insult girls?

1288
01:23:02,966 --> 01:23:05,501
Only people who don't have
self-respect would do that.

1289
01:23:05,566 --> 01:23:08,068
Enough! Don't say
a word beyond that.

1290
01:23:08,133 --> 01:23:11,603
What will you do? Will you
kill me? What can you do?

1291
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:14,002
Stop it, Mohini.
- How can I let it go, Madhu?

1292
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,169
I am not scared of such
disgraceful orphans!

1293
01:23:17,633 --> 01:23:19,601
Please! For my sake. Let's go.

1294
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:25,633
An orphan.

1295
01:23:28,566 --> 01:23:32,703
Madhu, the creator has
put life into stones.

1296
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:35,936
This is nothing, dear. Come
inside and take a look.

1297
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,502
You would feel as though
statues will. .

1298
01:23:39,566 --> 01:23:41,868
. .come off the walls and talk to us.

1299
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:43,501
Come along. Come, Mohini.

1300
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,801
Go on. I'm coming.
- ok.

1301
01:24:08,733 --> 01:24:11,635
You?
- Yes, it's me.

1302
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,734
Why have you come here?

1303
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:18,836
I have come here to reply to
what you said at the house.

1304
01:24:18,933 --> 01:24:21,035
If you had a reply, you would have
given it to me at that place.

1305
01:24:22,066 --> 01:24:23,167
I could have.

1306
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,470
Here, I thought you are trying
to enjoy these statues.

1307
01:24:28,533 --> 01:24:31,702
So, I thought I'd introduce
you to living people.

1308
01:24:32,066 --> 01:24:33,834
I don't want to listen
to your rubbish.

1309
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,868
You will listen, princess!

1310
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,702
You spoke before Madhu
and I heard it.

1311
01:24:41,766 --> 01:24:43,134
Now I will speak and
you will hear me out.

1312
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:47,169
You called me an orphan.
Do you know what that is?

1313
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:52,868
Madam, an orphan is like
an insect from a gutter.

1314
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:54,467
He can neither live nor die.

1315
01:24:55,066 --> 01:24:58,736
People throw him onto the
footpath as their sins.

1316
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,768
Even death doesn't accept him.

1317
01:25:02,033 --> 01:25:04,969
It leaves him numb for people
like you to hurt him.

1318
01:25:09,033 --> 01:25:10,534
You were born inside a house, right?

1319
01:25:11,933 --> 01:25:13,367
The protection of your
house saved you from. .

1320
01:25:13,433 --> 01:25:16,035
. .the dirt in this world
but think about this.

1321
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:22,071
If you were born near a gutter,
you wouldn't have parents.

1322
01:25:22,766 --> 01:25:23,800
You wouldn't have a family.

1323
01:25:24,466 --> 01:25:26,367
From your childhood, you would get. .

1324
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:28,835
. .leftovers and abuses
from the people.

1325
01:25:29,566 --> 01:25:33,369
When you would grow and
before you turn into. .

1326
01:25:33,433 --> 01:25:36,102
. .a woman, you would
have been made a call girl.

1327
01:25:37,033 --> 01:25:40,102
Orphans like me would
ask about your cost.

1328
01:25:40,966 --> 01:25:42,500
They would play around
with your body.

1329
01:25:42,933 --> 01:25:45,402
They would call you immoral
and a call girl!

1330
01:25:45,533 --> 01:25:49,036
Shut up!
- Now you feel hurt.

1331
01:25:49,899 --> 01:25:52,369
Madam, don't say anything
against anyone. .

1332
01:25:52,433 --> 01:25:55,936
. .without knowing everything
about them.

1333
01:25:57,633 --> 01:26:01,003
God doesn't know who is responsible
for every crime.

1334
01:26:02,633 --> 01:26:06,303
If at this time, in
this dark corner. .

1335
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:08,634
. .I would do something
wrong with you.

1336
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:11,568
The world won't call
me as a criminal.

1337
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:14,301
It will deem that orphan
as a criminal. .

1338
01:26:14,366 --> 01:26:18,970
. .whom you will throw away in
secret, just as I was thrown!

1339
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,469
Before the animal inside
me hurts you, go away.

1340
01:26:25,933 --> 01:26:27,000
Go away!

1341
01:26:27,899 --> 01:26:31,003
Heera, send these papers
to the lawyer.

1342
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:32,834
Tell him that I want the copies
immediately. - Yes, sir.

1343
01:26:34,699 --> 01:26:37,702
Madhu, what is it?
Why are you crying?

1344
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,902
Father, today is a day for
a Rakhi (sacred thread).

1345
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:44,300
Every brother goes
to his sister and. .

1346
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:48,369
. .gets a Rakhi tied. He
blesses his sister.

1347
01:26:49,466 --> 01:26:54,704
My brother hasn't come yet
even though it's afternoon.

1348
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:58,569
Madhu, you act strangely.

1349
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:02,635
You search for cold water
in a scorching desert.

1350
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:06,235
Child, people who value
a Rakhi deem it. .

1351
01:27:06,266 --> 01:27:09,902
. .to be more valuable than
any amount of money.

1352
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:12,234
For people like Mahinder, a Rakhi. .

1353
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,301
. .isn't a bond, it's a thread.

1354
01:27:15,233 --> 01:27:16,467
It isn't Rakhi, just ashes.

1355
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,768
Heera, explain it to Madhu.

1356
01:27:25,233 --> 01:27:26,734
Don't cry, Madhu.
Why are you crying?

1357
01:27:27,433 --> 01:27:30,502
I'll get Mahinder. I know
all his hangouts.

1358
01:27:31,566 --> 01:27:34,635
I am a servant of this house.
I will never let you cry.

1359
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,767
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, I am.

1360
01:27:36,866 --> 01:27:39,235
I swear.
- Whom do you swear by?

1361
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:43,468
Whom should I swear by?
I don't have anyone.

1362
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:47,402
No relatives whom I can swear by.

1363
01:28:00,166 --> 01:28:02,635
What are you doing, Madhu?

1364
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:07,368
I'm tying a Rakhi to my brother.

1365
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:21,169
No, Madhu. I am not worth this.

1366
01:28:22,899 --> 01:28:24,635
You have made me a brother.

1367
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:29,636
I am a man who has been
thrown away and rejected.

1368
01:28:30,733 --> 01:28:32,901
I have never felt any relation
throughout my life.

1369
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:38,370
I am dirty, Madhu. Just
to be kicked around.

1370
01:28:39,266 --> 01:28:41,401
No! You are my brother.

1371
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:45,802
If someone kicks you,
I'll cut his legs!

1372
01:28:46,566 --> 01:28:48,200
I am your sister, right?

1373
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:57,105
Son, till yesterday you
had no one in this world.

1374
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:03,170
Today, you have a sister
and a father.

1375
01:29:06,433 --> 01:29:12,172
Sir, the fires of life had
burned me and wounded me.

1376
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:16,102
Your love has healed my wounds and. .

1377
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:18,802
. .caused me to weep, sir.

1378
01:29:20,199 --> 01:29:22,802
I can't determine whether
this is a dream or reality.

1379
01:29:23,466 --> 01:29:27,403
If it is true, what was that
which I saw till today?

1380
01:29:28,266 --> 01:29:30,101
If it is a dream, may God cause. .

1381
01:29:30,166 --> 01:29:32,434
. .my eyes never to be opened, sir.

1382
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:35,735
Not 'sir#  Call him
as father, brother.

1383
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:38,500
Father!
- Madhu !

1384
01:29:39,266 --> 01:29:42,435
Where are you? Tie a
Rakhi quickly. Hurry!

1385
01:29:44,433 --> 01:29:45,767
Mahinder.
- Yes, father.

1386
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:51,237
These are the bonds of love.
They don't wait.

1387
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,102
The one, who was destined
to have it, got it.

1388
01:30:00,466 --> 01:30:03,268
Father, I don't like all this.

1389
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:08,370
Heera, I called you here for work
not for making relations.

1390
01:30:09,233 --> 01:30:11,635
Don't step into the house
unless you are called.

1391
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,167
Understand?

1392
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:51,335
Greetings, lawyer.
- You?

1393
01:30:51,433 --> 01:30:53,535
I'm Heera. I have been
sent by Mr. Kumar.

1394
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:57,169
Ok! - He has asked for
these papers urgently.

1395
01:31:02,766 --> 01:31:06,603
Well, I may need a hour
or so to prepare them.

1396
01:31:06,666 --> 01:31:07,733
That's alright.

1397
01:31:09,133 --> 01:31:10,701
Go roam around till then.

1398
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:13,034
Where can I go, sir? Your
Iand is so small that. .

1399
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,135
. .in five minutes I
can go around thrice.

1400
01:31:15,633 --> 01:31:18,168
I'll sit here.
- Alright then.

1401
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,735
Ms. Saxena! Read these papers.

1402
01:31:25,566 --> 01:31:30,771
Brother, I apologize. I think
I have met you before.

1403
01:31:32,033 --> 01:31:34,335
Are you fond of green pepper?

1404
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,334
You are upset?

1405
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,669
Oh my! It's my enemy's house!

1406
01:31:50,033 --> 01:31:52,068
Oh my! -Listen!
- Yes.

1407
01:31:53,033 --> 01:31:56,603
Where are you going?
- Well.. I'm leaving.

1408
01:31:56,666 --> 01:31:58,968
What happened? You just
said you would sit.

1409
01:31:59,033 --> 01:32:00,267
Now you say you want
to leave. What is it?

1410
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:01,534
I don't have any problem
in sitting here.

1411
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,969
The problem is that
I had a wrong number.

1412
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:07,069
Wrong number?
- Yes. I'm leaving.

1413
01:32:07,166 --> 01:32:09,601
Listen to me. Tell me
what the matter is.

1414
01:32:09,966 --> 01:32:13,135
What is it? What can it be?

1415
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,136
Actually, she spoke roughly.
I spoke straight away.

1416
01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:17,301
That is why, we had a problem.

1417
01:32:17,366 --> 01:32:19,234
That is why I am leaving.
- Listen!

1418
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,502
She was wrong, you were right.

1419
01:32:21,566 --> 01:32:23,968
Speak properly, why are you
beating around the bush?

1420
01:32:24,033 --> 01:32:26,101
This is it. That's it, lawyer.

1421
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:27,967
I have just found out that
the world is round.

1422
01:32:28,033 --> 01:32:30,502
That is why I am leaving.
- Where to?

1423
01:32:32,133 --> 01:32:33,200
To move around.

1424
01:32:33,266 --> 01:32:35,401
Your papers are getting ready.
Take them along.

1425
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:36,967
Sir, send them anytime.

1426
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,368
Otherwise, I'll see a good
chance and come again.

1427
01:32:38,466 --> 01:32:39,500
For the time being, I'm leaving.

1428
01:32:40,966 --> 01:32:42,033
You?
- You !

1429
01:32:43,033 --> 01:32:45,235
I have explained everything to him.

1430
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,634
That is why, I'm leaving.

1431
01:32:47,633 --> 01:32:49,234
How can you just go away?

1432
01:32:49,366 --> 01:32:50,433
How should I leave then?

1433
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:53,668
I was searching for you.
Come with me.

1434
01:32:54,566 --> 01:32:55,566
Heera, you are doomed.

1435
01:32:59,233 --> 01:33:00,467
What happened? Come.

1436
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:07,269
Your words shook my entire life.

1437
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,870
A big incident, perhaps
the biggest of my life. .

1438
01:33:11,933 --> 01:33:13,601
. .was reminded to me by your words.

1439
01:33:14,533 --> 01:33:15,600
Which incident?

1440
01:33:17,566 --> 01:33:21,937
I was a child. A boy used to
work at my grandma's house.

1441
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:24,901
He would wash our utensils.

1442
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:26,867
He knew many languages.

1443
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,435
Hindi, English, Urdu, Marathi,
Gujarati, Punjabi. .

1444
01:33:30,033 --> 01:33:31,334
He would speak them very easily.

1445
01:33:31,933 --> 01:33:33,100
His father was a drunkard.

1446
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,369
His father would drink
and beat him up.

1447
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,436
Yes. He would even take
away his salary.

1448
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:42,268
One day, my professor asked me.

1449
01:33:42,866 --> 01:33:44,567
How many years was Ram exiled for?

1450
01:33:44,866 --> 01:33:48,302
You couldn't answer. So
the boy said, 14 years.

1451
01:33:48,366 --> 01:33:51,469
Yes. Then, I gave
him a book to read.

1452
01:33:52,033 --> 01:33:53,434
His father took it away.

1453
01:33:54,566 --> 01:33:57,101
He hit him so much that he never
returned to your house.

1454
01:33:57,433 --> 01:34:03,305
Yes! How do you know all this?

1455
01:34:03,866 --> 01:34:05,100
Do you want to meet that boy?

1456
01:34:05,233 --> 01:34:09,303
Do you know him?
- He has been with me since birth.

1457
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,235
Where is here? Take me to him.

1458
01:34:13,433 --> 01:34:17,036
He's very poor. He stays in a hut.

1459
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:21,037
I don't care. Wherever he may
be, please take me to him.

1460
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:23,933
Come along.

1461
01:34:28,466 --> 01:34:31,235
This place is to dark.
I can't see anything.

1462
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,201
I told you that he is very poor.

1463
01:34:34,199 --> 01:34:36,435
Poor people only have darkness
for themselves.

1464
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:38,867
Come along.

1465
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:56,434
Where is he?
- I'll show you.

1466
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,401
Is that him?

1467
01:35:22,366 --> 01:35:27,471
This is the same book
but where is he?

1468
01:35:28,066 --> 01:35:32,270
You recognised the
book that you gave.

1469
01:35:33,266 --> 01:35:34,400
You couldn't recognise the person.

1470
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:42,736
Take it. I'll tell grandma
and order another book.

1471
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:52,270
You!
- Yes.

1472
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:10,804
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1473
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:20,841
''Now we meet each other.''

1474
01:36:21,833 --> 01:36:30,675
''Like a fire burning through. .

1475
01:36:30,733 --> 01:36:37,840
. .a single flame.''

1476
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,603
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1477
01:37:14,666 --> 01:37:21,706
''Now we meet each other.''

1478
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:26,604
''Like the monsoons. .''

1479
01:37:26,933 --> 01:37:37,209
''Like rains that fall
during the monsoons.''

1480
01:37:37,266 --> 01:37:41,203
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1481
01:37:41,266 --> 01:37:47,705
''Now we meet each other.''

1482
01:37:47,766 --> 01:37:52,904
''We were separated for a long time.''

1483
01:38:12,866 --> 01:38:18,004
''After a long time, there
is a fragrance.''

1484
01:38:18,066 --> 01:38:22,870
''The heart beats, the breath flows.''

1485
01:38:23,066 --> 01:38:28,137
''Love has been formed
through thirsty eyes.''

1486
01:38:28,233 --> 01:38:33,071
''From soft lips, there is a fire.''

1487
01:38:39,066 --> 01:38:41,735
''The scented breeze and wind. .''

1488
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,835
''It has made two thirsty
hearts meet.''

1489
01:38:44,133 --> 01:38:46,768
''It has made two thirsty
hearts meet.''

1490
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,138
''Just like intoxication.. ''

1491
01:38:53,533 --> 01:39:03,509
''Just as intoxication enters
a drunk as he stumbles. ''

1492
01:39:03,566 --> 01:39:07,469
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1493
01:39:07,533 --> 01:39:13,772
''Now we meet each other.''

1494
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:18,971
''We were separated for a long time.''

1495
01:39:41,933 --> 01:39:49,106
''The wedding trumpet sings
a song far away. ''

1496
01:39:51,666 --> 01:39:56,570
''It touches the cords
of our hearts. ''

1497
01:39:56,699 --> 01:40:01,771
''It touches the cords
of our hearts. ''

1498
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:09,673
''Flowers of our dreams
blossom here. ''

1499
01:40:09,733 --> 01:40:14,537
''Prayers of the heart
are fulfilled. ''

1500
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:19,638
''Prayers of the heart
are fulfilled. ''

1501
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:27,935
''We were strangers for years.
We were alone. ''

1502
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,402
''Strangers met in such a way.''

1503
01:40:30,533 --> 01:40:33,035
''Strangers met in such a way.''

1504

''As we wished for. .''

1505
01:40:37,033 --> 01:40:39,435
''As we wished for. .''

1506
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:49,643
''As our prayers are fulfilled
after being tested. ''

''We were separated
from a long time. ''

''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1513
01:41:48,633 --> 01:41:51,469
Where are you going, darling?
- To hell! What do you care?

1514
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:55,969
I care just about you.
I will go where you go.

1515
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,568
That day you were talking
about a relation.

1516
01:41:59,633 --> 01:42:02,602
I was in a hurry. Let's have
our relation made today.

1517
01:42:04,399 --> 01:42:05,934
You idiot, leave me!

1518
01:42:06,266 --> 01:42:07,333
Brother!

1519
01:42:09,366 --> 01:42:11,668
Why are you troubling
your brother, beloved?

1520
01:42:11,933 --> 01:42:14,535
I am talking about a relation..
- Brother!

1521
01:42:17,866 --> 01:42:20,268
Save me! Brother!

1522
01:42:20,466 --> 01:42:22,501
Save me! Brother!

1523
01:42:22,933 --> 01:42:25,335
Save me!

1524
01:42:36,433 --> 01:42:37,934
Leave me! Leave me!

1525
01:42:38,666 --> 01:42:40,868
Channo!
- Brother!

1526
01:42:40,933 --> 01:42:44,369
Mahinder!
- Your lousy brother!

1527
01:42:44,433 --> 01:42:45,500
I'll see you someday.

1528
01:42:47,966 --> 01:42:51,969
Brother! Don't let this fool escape!

1529
01:42:52,966 --> 01:42:57,270
Mahinder! I won't spare you today.

1530
01:43:27,566 --> 01:43:28,767
You fool!

1531
01:43:31,333 --> 01:43:33,501
Throw out this dog!

1532
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:40,467
Go there.

1533
01:43:55,399 --> 01:43:59,203
You idiot! Go back otherwise. .

1534
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:04,404
. .you'll be killed mercilessly.

1535
01:44:07,633 --> 01:44:11,536
You slaves of a ruffian!
Bring him to me.

1536
01:44:12,199 --> 01:44:14,235
Otherwise, I will kill you all.

1537
01:44:18,333 --> 01:44:19,400
Get him!

1538
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:45,203
You thugs! If you dare
to move ahead. .

1539
01:44:45,266 --> 01:44:46,467
. .I'll set this wood-house to fire!

1540
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,335
I'll burn down this wood-house!

1541
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,902
Bring Mahinder out!

1542
01:44:52,199 --> 01:44:56,137
Bring Mahinder out
or I will set fire!

1543
01:44:56,766 --> 01:44:59,535
Ram Singh! No, Ram Singh!

1544
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:02,135
Bring Mahinder out here.

1545
01:45:03,133 --> 01:45:04,734
I say, bring him out!
- No, Ram Singh!

1546
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:09,270
Don't do that. What have these
poor people done to you?

I'll get him.

Your brother is still
alive. Sit here.

What happened to my hands?
Where are my hands?!

Return them to me!

What happened to my hands?

1561

Mohini? How did you come
here at this time?

1594
01:51:28,366 --> 01:51:29,767
At least you recognised me.

1595
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,734
I thought for Ram Singh
you would forget. .

rest of the world.

How can I forget you?

Anyone who sees you once
won't forget you.

I see you all the time.

1600
01:51:41,866 --> 01:51:44,835
That's enough! Why didn't
you meet me all this time?

1601
01:51:45,233 --> 01:51:47,435
The world extends beyond Ram Singh.

1602
01:51:47,533 --> 01:51:50,269
It does. It's a beautiful world.

1603
01:51:51,233 --> 01:51:55,270
However, now my world will start
from here and end here.

1604
01:51:56,066 --> 01:51:57,233
What about me?

1605
01:51:58,966 --> 01:52:03,270
We will be there for
each other. Get it?

1606
01:52:03,333 --> 01:52:04,867
No. I didn't understand.

1607
01:52:05,333 --> 01:52:08,869
I knew you wouldn't. You
will find out. Come.

1608
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:10,668
Where?
- We have to buy some things. .

Tell me. I'll get it.

1611
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,068
Ram Singh's house's responsibility
is mine.

1612
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:21,971
That is my duty. A man
should do his duty.

1613

Come.

1614

Sir! You are with a girl again?

I have been searching for
you since many days!

1616
01:52:30,066 --> 01:52:32,368
I didn't find you at the doctor's
house or wood-house.

1617
01:52:32,433 --> 01:52:34,668
I find you here at this
rotten man's house.

1618
01:52:34,733 --> 01:52:37,368
Understand?
- I have understood.

1619
01:52:37,433 --> 01:52:39,201
I think I'll have to
make you understand.

1620
01:52:39,266 --> 01:52:40,333
What do you mean?

1621
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:44,670
I mean that if you ever speak
badly about Ram Singh. .

1622
01:52:44,733 --> 01:52:48,103
. .again, I'll make your
other eye flap too.

1623
01:52:49,066 --> 01:52:51,268
Forget about me. Take
care of yourself.

1624
01:52:51,866 --> 01:52:52,967
Should I tell you a secret?

1625
01:52:53,666 --> 01:52:55,200
Mahinder is very angry with you.

1626
01:52:55,266 --> 01:52:57,001
You haven't come for
work since many days.

1627
01:52:57,066 --> 01:52:58,700
He has called you immediately.
Come with me!

1628
01:53:01,366 --> 01:53:03,201
Listen to me.
- Yes.

1629
01:53:03,899 --> 01:53:06,969
Tell Mahinder that I
have quit his job.

1630
01:53:07,666 --> 01:53:10,668
Also tell him that if
he ever looks at. .

1631
01:53:10,733 --> 01:53:12,668
.. Ram Singh or his sister again. .

1632
01:53:12,733 --> 01:53:17,204
. .I'll make him stand on a
road and burn him to death!

1633
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:18,733
Get lost!

1634
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,067
Tell me!

1635
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:24,101
You dishonest man! Where is Heera?

1636
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:30,036
You still have your old fervor.

1637
01:53:31,666 --> 01:53:36,337
You idiot, you feel
secured due to Heera.

1638
01:53:36,666 --> 01:53:38,701
I asked you where
he is. Where is he?

1639
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:42,303
I won't tell you.
- I will make you tell me.

1640

Tell me!

1641

Get up. Now tell me where Heera is.

1642
01:53:48,966 --> 01:53:50,033
I won't tell you.

1643
01:53:53,833 --> 01:53:58,704
Tell me! You won't tell me? Tell me!

1644
01:54:05,233 --> 01:54:12,139
Now tell me. - Till I remain
alive, I won't speak.

You won't tell me?
- I won't tell you.

You idiots, leave my brother!

1649

You idiots, leave my brother!
- Leave him!

1650

to take revenge. .

do you attack him?

1652
01:54:37,066 --> 01:54:40,836
Bhima, hurt him more.

1653
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,802
Leave my brother. I beg of you!

1654
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:49,170
Don't beg for your brother!

1655

a lair, brother.

I couldn't fulfill
any of my promises.

Doctor, you are still here?

Nothing.
- Whom were you talking to?

1698
01:58:49,466 --> 01:58:52,335
It was the lawyer.
- Why?

1699
01:58:53,566 --> 01:58:57,870
Father, Ram Singh the
potter has been killed.

How? - Our manager Heera
had an affair with. .

1701
01:59:03,333 --> 01:59:05,268
.. Ram Singh's sister Channo.

1702
01:59:05,899 --> 01:59:07,468
She was pregnant with his child.

1703
01:59:07,966 --> 01:59:11,903
When she told Heera to get
married, he refused.

1704
01:59:11,966 --> 01:59:13,701
He's lying, father! He's lying!

1705
01:59:16,633 --> 01:59:17,700
What is this I hear, son?

1706
01:59:17,866 --> 01:59:19,667
You haven't done anything
other than hearing.

1707
01:59:20,366 --> 01:59:21,934
You keep sitting here.

1708
01:59:22,333 --> 01:59:25,369
You have left this devil to play
around with helpless people.

1709
01:59:25,433 --> 01:59:28,569
Speak properly! Who are you
to call my son a devil?

1710
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:29,701
He is not only a devil, mother.

1711
01:59:29,899 --> 01:59:30,967
He's worse than a demon.

1712
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,302
You don't believe because
he is your son, your own.

1713
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:35,734
Come with me. I'll show
you his reality.

1714
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:36,867
Shut up, discourteous man!

1715
01:59:37,433 --> 01:59:39,401
You want to blame your crime
on me and save yourself?

1716
01:59:39,466 --> 01:59:40,533
Mahinder!
- Heera.

1717
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:46,537
I'll see what the truth is and
what is false on my own.

1718
01:59:46,933 --> 01:59:48,000
Then, I will decide.

1719
01:59:48,066 --> 01:59:49,267
Fire! Fire!

1720
02:00:04,433 --> 02:00:06,835
Leave me. Leave me!

1721
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:09,369
Heera, don't pretend.

1722
02:00:09,433 --> 02:00:11,401
You killed them both and
set their house on fire.

1723
02:00:11,466 --> 02:00:13,868
Accountant! You're lying!

1724
02:00:13,933 --> 02:00:16,468
You may say that he's lying.

1725
02:00:16,533 --> 02:00:18,201
How can you say that the
slum dwellers are lying?

1726
02:00:18,266 --> 02:00:20,201
Before them you killed them both. .

1727
02:00:20,266 --> 02:00:21,333
. .and set their house on fire!

1728
02:00:21,399 --> 02:00:25,203
Shut up, you liar!
- Come, inspector. Come.

1729
02:00:25,433 --> 02:00:27,468
Inspector, he's the killer.

1730
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,201
He has killed Ram Singh
and his sister.

1731
02:00:29,266 --> 02:00:31,201
Then he set fire to
their house. Get him.

1732
02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:35,837
You greedy dog! You sell
yourself for money!

1733
02:00:35,899 --> 02:00:38,435
I am not the killer. It's him,
your provider. Mahinder!

1734
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:41,436
Arrest him.
- Hold your tongue.

1735
02:00:42,199 --> 02:00:43,868
Father, did you see?

1736
02:00:44,333 --> 02:00:47,836
I was under control till now,
sir. I really was!

1737
02:00:48,366 --> 02:00:52,536
I saw your fake refinement
and tried to be civilized.

1738
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:54,568
I became a better man.

1739
02:00:54,633 --> 02:00:58,136
You people who are called
civilized are still rotten!

1740
02:00:58,199 --> 02:00:59,267
Shut up, fool!

1741
02:00:59,333 --> 02:01:01,301
You are a fool and
so is your father!

1742
02:01:01,366 --> 02:01:03,134
What are you staring at inspector?
Arrest him.

1743
02:01:20,866 --> 02:01:25,136
Sir, I swear by God.

1744
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:30,136
The day I am released,
I will hurt you. .

1745
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:34,504
..in such a way as
Ram Singh was hurt.

1746
02:01:36,133 --> 02:01:37,300
I swear by God!

1747
02:01:55,133 --> 02:01:59,070
Due to witnesses borne
by doctor Goyal and. .

1748
02:01:59,133 --> 02:02:02,302
.. Ms. Mohini, the court has decided
Mr. Heera is innocent.

1749
02:02:02,566 --> 02:02:06,069
The court releases Mr. Heera
and orders the police. .

1750
02:02:06,133 --> 02:02:11,204
. .to quickly try to and
arrest the real culprits.

1751
02:02:35,666 --> 02:02:38,735
Do you recognise this?
- Yes.

1752
02:02:39,466 --> 02:02:42,502
I gave you this return ticket.

1753
02:02:42,566 --> 02:02:45,769
If you wouldn't like my business
you could return.

1754
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:48,168
Now you should return.

1755
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:53,770
No, Mahinder. There is no way,
I'm going to return.

1756
02:02:54,399 --> 02:02:58,070
I liked the business. I
didn't like a few people.

1757
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,735
I don't take much time to
correct wrong people.

1758
02:03:02,199 --> 02:03:04,602
I'll snap my fingers and
the person is cleared.

1759
02:03:05,666 --> 02:03:11,104
No, this isn't so easy. This
isn't Mumbai. It's my town.

1760
02:03:12,066 --> 02:03:14,535
Even a dog acts like a lion
in his territory, Mahinder.

1761
02:03:15,066 --> 02:03:17,802
Anyway, I have always seen
only dogs that bark.

1762
02:03:18,566 --> 02:03:23,470
Some dogs just bite.
They don't bark.

1763
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:24,667
My name is Heera (a diamond).

1764
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:28,235
If I am embraced
I become jewellery'.

1765
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:35,072
If I am pulled roughly,
I can cut you down.

1766
02:03:41,233 --> 02:03:43,468
That idiot has challenged me.

1767
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:45,434
He will surely come here.

1768
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:48,534
This is the only way to come in.

1769
02:03:49,399 --> 02:03:54,138
Kill him and properly
dispose off his body.

1770
02:03:54,233 --> 02:03:55,534
I'll make you rich.

1771
02:03:56,433 --> 02:03:59,135
Remember that none of
you must be recognised.

1772
02:03:59,699 --> 02:04:03,737
The villagers should think
that he has fled.

1773
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:06,135
Understand? Yes!

1774
02:04:07,366 --> 02:04:09,000
Don't let father know about this.

1775
02:04:09,066 --> 02:04:10,600
He won't know. Don't worry.

1776
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,568
Otherwise I'll kill you too.

1777
02:04:26,133 --> 02:04:27,501
Alright, hurry up!

1778
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:31,336
I'll blow up his brains.

1779
02:04:31,399 --> 02:04:34,002
When you shoot him, take
a small reward from me.

1780
02:04:34,066 --> 02:04:35,167
Go on now! Get lost.

1781
02:05:09,933 --> 02:05:11,134
O God.

1782
02:05:19,133 --> 02:05:20,534
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1783
02:05:25,466 --> 02:05:26,533
Hey you!

1784
02:05:52,199 --> 02:05:55,136
Look at his face. He
was going to kill me.

1785
02:06:04,199 --> 02:06:05,868
Brother, tell me, what
shall I do to you.

1786
02:06:06,166 --> 02:06:07,467
Forgive me, brother.

1787
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:32,271
God, they are the people who
sent me with a bulldozer.

1788
02:07:33,066 --> 02:07:34,400
They told me to destroy the slum.

1789
02:07:34,899 --> 02:07:38,803
Remove the temple. Poor
people stay for free.

1790
02:07:39,033 --> 02:07:41,235
God doesn't pay rent
too. Remove him.

1791
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:46,971
Look at me. You hurt
me many times, son.

1792
02:07:47,033 --> 02:07:48,100
I never complained.

1793
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:51,202
Remember? That day,
I used a bulldozer.

1794
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:52,334
I didn't let you be harmed.

1795
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:54,934
What are you doing? Put that down.

1796
02:07:56,033 --> 02:07:59,102
When two elders speak, you
shouldn't intervene.

1797
02:07:59,333 --> 02:08:00,400
Understand?

1798
02:08:04,433 --> 02:08:06,168
You have made strange models, Lord.

1799
02:08:07,233 --> 02:08:08,334
It's good that their number is few.

1800
02:08:08,899 --> 02:08:11,836
If it were more you would
be completely cleared off!

1801
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:16,901
Look at this. Another model.

1802
02:08:17,266 --> 02:08:19,735
Harzana! Come here, you idiot.

1803
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,971
Yes. - Come here.
- Don't hit me, sir.

1804
02:08:25,333 --> 02:08:27,234
You were hitting the others
but I was getting wounded.

1805
02:08:27,733 --> 02:08:29,734
If you hit me, my sisters
and mother will die.

1806
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:30,867
Do you have sisters and a mother?

1807
02:08:30,933 --> 02:08:32,367
Yes. Two unmarried mothers
and a sister.

1808
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:35,468
No! A mother and two
unmarried sisters.

1809
02:08:35,533 --> 02:08:37,735
Still you wink at girls?

1810
02:08:38,066 --> 02:08:40,735
Sir, if I don't work
for a bad employer. .

1811
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,935
..how will I feed my
sisters and mother?

1812
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:44,334
Look, fool.
- Yes.

1813
02:08:44,733 --> 02:08:46,334
I'll spare you only
on one condition.

1814
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:47,467
Order me, sir.

1815
02:08:47,933 --> 02:08:50,869
After today, you won't wink.
- I'll stop it.

1816
02:08:51,333 --> 02:08:52,801
Wrong deeds..
- Stopped.

1817
02:08:53,233 --> 02:08:54,901
Honestly..
- Stopped.

1818
02:08:56,199 --> 02:08:57,267
I'll be honest!

1819
02:08:57,666 --> 02:08:58,767
Did you get me?
- I did.

1820
02:08:58,800 --> 02:08:59,867
Go! Get lost!

1821
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:02,668
Alright, I'm leaving.
- ok.

1822
02:09:02,866 --> 02:09:04,267
Greetings.
- Greetings. - Bye.

1823
02:09:06,666 --> 02:09:09,402
Greetings, sir.
- Who are you?

1824
02:09:10,966 --> 02:09:13,902
Sir, have you forgotten
Gangu Ganpat?

1825
02:09:16,266 --> 02:09:18,368
It appears you have forgotten
your old story, sir.

1826
02:09:18,433 --> 02:09:19,901
I'll have to narrate
it in its entirety.

1827
02:09:20,333 --> 02:09:21,400
Do you remember, sir?

1828
02:09:21,466 --> 02:09:24,802
You had a friend's sister
at your home, Vidya.

1829
02:09:24,866 --> 02:09:26,934
She had a child.
- Yes! Gangu!

1830
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,769
Yes.
- That's you ! - Yes, me.

1831
02:09:29,899 --> 02:09:31,768
You remembered me only because
I told you the story.

1832
02:09:32,066 --> 02:09:34,034
Alright, do something.
Move sideways.

1833
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:36,068
No, sir. Sit back.

1834
02:09:36,133 --> 02:09:38,802
I am your old driver. I have
taken my former position.

1835
02:09:38,866 --> 02:09:40,834
No, it's alright. I'll
drive. Sit there.

1836
02:09:40,899 --> 02:09:41,967
Come.
- o k.

1837
02:09:50,266 --> 02:09:53,002
Get off.
- Is this your house, sir?

1838
02:09:53,333 --> 02:09:57,970
First get off the car.
- I'm off, sir.

1839
02:09:58,033 --> 02:09:59,100
Shut the door properly.

1840
02:09:59,166 --> 02:10:02,202
Yes.. why did you stop
sending money, sir?

1841
02:10:03,033 --> 02:10:06,903
Take 500 rupees. Get a ticket
and go to Mumbai.

1842
02:10:07,966 --> 02:10:11,602
If I see you again, I'll send
you to jail for so long. .

1843
02:10:11,666 --> 02:10:13,701
. .that you'll go in alive
and come out dead.

1844
02:10:14,166 --> 02:10:15,967
Remember that my name
is Kailashnath.

1845
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:23,869
I remember that your
name is Kailashnath.

1846
02:10:24,733 --> 02:10:27,969
You can't send me to jail, you fool.

1847
02:10:28,733 --> 02:10:30,901
You committed a sin and
I should go to jail?

1848
02:10:31,766 --> 02:10:34,935
You threaten me because I'm old?

1849
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:40,103
I swear, I'll show you, you fool!

1850
02:10:40,733 --> 02:10:42,034
What do you mean?
- Meaning?

1851
02:10:42,199 --> 02:10:44,902
You have borne witness against
Mahinder in the court.

1852
02:10:45,066 --> 02:10:47,001
So, we will decide this.

1853
02:10:47,266 --> 02:10:49,201
Whatever I said in court,
was the truth.

1854
02:10:49,266 --> 02:10:50,600
Is speaking the truth a sin?

1855
02:10:50,666 --> 02:10:52,768
It's not a sin but it is wrong.

1856
02:10:53,333 --> 02:10:54,867
What are you doing?
- Go on.

1857
02:10:54,933 --> 02:10:56,868
Show the doctor around the market.

1858
02:10:56,933 --> 02:10:58,868
So that the others too may see that.

1859
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:22,734
Kumar Ranvir Singh.

1860
02:11:23,899 --> 02:11:24,967
Who are you?

1861
02:11:25,533 --> 02:11:28,135
Kailashnath's old driver, Gangu?

1862
02:11:29,199 --> 02:11:30,267
Gangu?
- Yes.

1863
02:11:31,266 --> 02:11:34,736
Are you Gangu?
- Do you know me?

1864
02:11:35,266 --> 02:11:36,634
You are Heera's father, right?

1865
02:11:36,866 --> 02:11:38,033
You would squander his earnings. .

1866
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:39,234
. .in liquor during his childhood.

1867
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:43,671
Forget it, madam. You know
that liquor ruins a man.

1868
02:11:44,233 --> 02:11:47,703
Heera left me and came here.

1869
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:50,735
Heera says that he has no relative.

1870
02:11:51,166 --> 02:11:53,768
No, madam! He has everything.

1871
02:11:54,466 --> 02:11:56,534
He should be in a big house.

1872
02:11:57,666 --> 02:12:01,169
This lousy Kailashnath!
- Speak carefully.

1873
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:02,867
He is my father.

1874
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:08,002
How was a good girl like
you born at his house?

1875
02:12:08,766 --> 02:12:10,601
Alright! You are his daughter,
aren't you?

1876
02:12:10,666 --> 02:12:14,469
I'll tell you everything.
Your father is very bad.

1877
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,501
He made Heera an orphan.

1878
02:12:17,899 --> 02:12:20,836
Madam, I haven't eaten
anything in two days.

1879
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:24,068
I haven't taken a drink either.
Will I get some money?

1880
02:12:24,766 --> 02:12:27,201
I'll give you as much as you
want. Tell me everything.

1881
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:30,867
Doctor!

1882
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:34,667
Doctor.

1883
02:12:36,633 --> 02:12:39,869
How did all this happen?
- It's nothing, son.

1884
02:12:41,033 --> 02:12:42,100
There was a premonition.

1885
02:12:42,733 --> 02:12:46,603
A storm came and destroyed
everything.

1886
02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:49,769
How did the storm
destroy only your place?

1887
02:12:53,633 --> 02:12:55,034
Oh! I understand.

1888
02:12:56,766 --> 02:12:59,468
From my childhood, day and night. .

1889
02:12:59,533 --> 02:13:02,469
. .I have faced such storms.

1890
02:13:04,033 --> 02:13:07,102
They think that they have
the law under control.

1891
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,837
No, son. No.
- Don't worry, doctor.

1892
02:13:13,466 --> 02:13:16,769
I have been practicing for
this match for twenty-five years.

1893
02:13:17,733 --> 02:13:20,068
The only thing different
are these clothes.

1894
02:13:21,899 --> 02:13:23,801
Now my clothes and speech
have been changed.

1895
02:13:24,566 --> 02:13:25,900
I will have to come back to reality.

1896
02:13:49,533 --> 02:13:50,600
What is this son?

1897
02:13:52,466 --> 02:13:54,401
Doctor, I have played every match. .

1898
02:13:54,433 --> 02:13:55,534
. .of my life wearing this uniform.

1899
02:13:56,399 --> 02:14:00,403
There was a short interval
but the match resumes now.

1900
02:14:03,666 --> 02:14:09,471
Take this, doctor. This is
my shroud. A black shroud.

1901
02:14:10,133 --> 02:14:13,569
If something happens to
me, put it over me.

1902
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:22,469
Now no one will bear witness
against Mahinder.

1903
02:14:28,433 --> 02:14:31,102
What is it? You attacked the doctor.

1904
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,401
I'll beat you up in
such a way that no. .

1905
02:14:33,466 --> 02:14:36,135
. .doctor in this world would
be able to treat you.

1906
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,702
Don't fight, please! Please don't!

1907
02:14:57,333 --> 02:14:59,001
Mahinder!

1908
02:15:06,033 --> 02:15:12,372
You coward! You rule over
your slaves! Come out!

1909
02:15:14,066 --> 02:15:18,336
In your village, in your colony,
before your house. .

1910
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:22,337
.. Heera challenges you! Come out!

1911
02:15:23,333 --> 02:15:24,400
Why is he abusing you?

1912
02:15:24,466 --> 02:15:25,667
Why are you hiding inside?!
- He is a fool, mother.

1913
02:15:25,733 --> 02:15:28,001
Father has pampered him
a lot. Otherwise. .

1914
02:15:28,566 --> 02:15:33,470
Why do you attack an old
weak doctor, you idiot?

1915
02:15:34,333 --> 02:15:36,868
If you've got guts come before me!

1916
02:15:37,833 --> 02:15:42,003
I hurt you with just
one blow, you fool!

1917
02:15:43,966 --> 02:15:48,403
This man and his father
are looting the world.

1918
02:15:51,699 --> 02:15:54,269
The father gives donations,
creates orphanages. .

1919
02:15:54,333 --> 02:15:56,635
. .and tries to fool the public.

1920
02:15:57,766 --> 02:15:59,267
His son. .

1921
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:04,904
He uses his men and acts
harshly against the poor.

1922
02:16:05,633 --> 02:16:06,700
Come out!

1923
02:16:07,666 --> 02:16:11,269
I ask you, if someone
abuses your God. .

1924
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:15,804
r
. .if he is dishonoured
will you be quiet?

1925
02:16:15,866 --> 02:16:17,300
No!

1926
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:22,271
Today that God is being
abused openly by. .

1927
02:16:22,333 --> 02:16:24,668
. .a disgusting man, a betrayer!

1928
02:16:24,766 --> 02:16:29,871
You rich people! Why do
you make fun of us poor?

1929
02:16:31,733 --> 02:16:32,800
Sometimes you treat me as your son.

1930
02:16:32,866 --> 02:16:35,268
Then you make me wear a Rakhi..
and treat me as your brother.

1931
02:16:36,399 --> 02:16:37,768
It's all for your selfishness.

1932
02:16:39,333 --> 02:16:41,401
Otherwise, this Rakhi
is nothing much.

1933
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,269
Even if a steel chain would
exist in it's place. .

1934
02:16:45,299 --> 02:16:49,337
. .you would still cut it with
the sword of your dishonesty.

1935
02:16:53,666 --> 02:16:55,467
Now no one is coming out.

1936
02:16:57,933 --> 02:17:00,302
Have you, father and son got scared?

1937
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:23,236
Heera, speak with caution, or else. .

1938
02:17:23,766 --> 02:17:26,802
What will you do? Shoot me?

1939
02:17:26,866 --> 02:17:28,400
Yes, I will shoot you, Heera.

1940
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:33,471
Here, shoot me. The world will
find the reality of this house.

1941
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:36,535
They should know that
not only the son. .

1942
02:17:37,433 --> 02:17:42,604
Even a generous, religious,
the helper of the poor.

1943
02:17:43,266 --> 02:17:46,202
The provider of the helpless,
an image of God. .

1944
02:17:46,266 --> 02:17:51,504
.. Kunwar Ranvir Singh knows
to pick up a gun and shoot.

1945
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:53,200
Shoot me.

1946
02:17:54,466 --> 02:17:57,202
No! No, father!

1947
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:00,401
Wait, father. What are you doing?

1948
02:18:00,533 --> 02:18:02,868
Move back, Mohini! I'll kill him!

1949
02:18:02,933 --> 02:18:05,669
Don't do that. He has your blood.

1950
02:18:05,733 --> 02:18:06,800
He is your son!

1951
02:18:14,833 --> 02:18:17,135
Gangu, the driver has
told me everything.

1952
02:18:19,633 --> 02:18:20,667
Come in, father.

1953
02:18:21,633 --> 02:18:25,837
Sir! What happened?
Is that all you got?

1954
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,335
Are you chickening out? Shoot me!

1955
02:18:31,133 --> 02:18:34,269
Rich man! Where are you going?

1956
02:18:39,333 --> 02:18:42,135
I swear that if I would
have had the gun now. .

1957
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:43,401
. .I would have killed you already.

1958
02:18:47,533 --> 02:18:50,736
Alright, sir. Today,
Heera is leaving.

1959
02:18:51,733 --> 02:18:56,771
Remember that I won't spare you!

1960
02:18:58,566 --> 02:19:01,802
I'll make you lose your respect!

1961
02:19:03,066 --> 02:19:06,602
Kill him. .

1962
02:19:06,666 --> 02:19:08,300
Don't let Heera live!

1963
02:19:09,566 --> 02:19:12,535
Father, his life has tormented him.

1964
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:15,235
Take him, he is very good.

1965
02:19:15,666 --> 02:19:21,204
I was very sad to hear that
he moves around aimlessly.

1966
02:19:21,733 --> 02:19:23,367
I can't bring him home.

1967
02:19:24,133 --> 02:19:28,504
I can't embrace him; I can't
call him as my son.

1968
02:19:30,766 --> 02:19:37,072
Mohini, I beg of you.

1969
02:19:38,399 --> 02:19:40,668
Don't ever tell my son
that I am his father.

1970
02:19:41,799 --> 02:19:45,069
I am helpless. Due to my
image amongst the people. .

1971
02:19:45,133 --> 02:19:48,436
..I can't call my son as my own.

1972
02:19:49,266 --> 02:19:51,301
I request you, don't tell my son.

1973
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:57,137
Don't tell my son. Don't
say that I am his father.

1974
02:20:27,633 --> 02:20:30,002
There he is! Bash him up!

1975
02:20:32,733 --> 02:20:34,301
Which people?
- I don't know.

1976
02:20:34,333 --> 02:20:37,002
All I know is that Mahinder
was behind the crowd.

1977
02:20:37,399 --> 02:20:38,434
Mahinder.

1978
02:20:40,299 --> 02:20:44,070
Wait! I said stop!

1979
02:20:44,433 --> 02:20:49,137
You have abused our God.
We won't spare you!

1980
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:51,135
Stop! You have been
provoked by Mahinder.

1981
02:20:51,533 --> 02:20:53,234
You have insulted our deity.

1982
02:20:53,466 --> 02:20:55,367
Yes, I have abused your God.

1983
02:20:55,933 --> 02:20:57,601
I have insulted his evil son too.

1984
02:20:58,100 --> 02:20:59,601
Do you want to know his reality?

1985
02:20:59,666 --> 02:21:01,200
He's uttering rubbish!

1986
02:21:01,266 --> 02:21:03,234
Hit him! Hit the idiot!

1987
02:21:15,133 --> 02:21:19,937
Hit him! - Move back! Move back!

1988
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,002
Move back! Move back! Don't hit him!

1989
02:21:23,333 --> 02:21:25,535
Move! Move back! Move back!

1990
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:30,969
Why did you stop? Why? Hit him!

1991
02:21:31,033 --> 02:21:35,337
He is still alive! Kill him!

1992
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,202
This is the rule of this world.

1993
02:21:38,266 --> 02:21:41,369
Bow before the rich
and hurt the poor.

1994
02:21:41,633 --> 02:21:44,235
I ask you, what has he done?

1995
02:21:44,266 --> 02:21:48,403
It is only that he spoke
for a poor man like me.

1996
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:51,936
He spoke against the rich
who enjoy themselves. .

1997
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,868
. .by exploiting the poor.

1998
02:21:54,266 --> 02:21:55,333
What are you staring at?

1999
02:21:55,399 --> 02:21:58,202
Pick up a stone and
crush him. Kill him!

2000
02:21:58,266 --> 02:22:01,035
Hang him! Shut his voice!

2001
02:22:01,266 --> 02:22:03,868
You won't get such a chance again.

2002
02:22:03,933 --> 02:22:07,870
Our blood should be used
for our well-being.

2003
02:22:10,133 --> 02:22:14,170
Get up, son. This world is
not for us. You don't know.

2004
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:17,569
The ones who say the truth
have always been hurt.

2005
02:22:17,666 --> 02:22:18,867
Get up. Come on.

2006
02:22:19,166 --> 02:22:22,135
No, Goyal. He won't go with you.

2007
02:22:22,866 --> 02:22:27,537
He won't go with anyone else.
He will go with me. With me!

2008
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,135
Sir, you?

2009
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,970
How are you know, son? You
were restless all night.

2010
02:22:45,299 --> 02:22:49,070
Sir, what is it now?

2011
02:22:51,066 --> 02:22:52,467
Sometimes you want to kill me.

2012
02:22:53,866 --> 02:22:58,070
Sometimes you make an
effort to save me.

2013
02:23:00,033 --> 02:23:01,300
Yesterday, you had a
gun in your hands.

2014
02:23:01,366 --> 02:23:02,867
Today, there are tears in your eyes.

2015
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:07,003
What is this secret?

2016
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:10,935
What do you want from me, sir? What?

2017
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:14,301
Tell me, sir. What do you want?

2018
02:23:20,266 --> 02:23:22,067
Tell me, why did you
want to kill Heera?

2019
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:25,069
Father!
- Answer me, Mahinder.

2020
02:23:25,566 --> 02:23:28,535
No!
- Why did you lie to me?

2021
02:23:29,533 --> 02:23:31,334
Father! Stop it, father.

2022
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:33,601
I am asking for an answer,
Mahinder. Tell me.

2023
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:36,936
Father.
- Tell me! Why did you lie?

2024
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,101
He's hurt. Don't hit him.

2025
02:23:40,933 --> 02:23:42,868
Stop it. Are you trying to kill him?

2026
02:23:42,933 --> 02:23:44,134
Yes, I am going to kill him.

2027
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:47,402
Today, I can't be patient anymore.

2028
02:23:48,066 --> 02:23:50,935
I won't spare him. I'll hurt him.

2029
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:54,836
I will destroy this sinner!
- No! I won't let you do that!

2030
02:23:54,899 --> 02:23:55,934
Leave me, Kamini!

2031
02:23:56,399 --> 02:23:58,201
You wretched man!
- Father.

2032
02:24:05,899 --> 02:24:08,202
No, father. That's enough.

2033
02:24:09,399 --> 02:24:10,801
What can be done by killing him?

2034
02:24:12,100 --> 02:24:14,869
If you want to kill, destroy
the evil within him.

2035
02:24:15,366 --> 02:24:16,867
Remove it from his heart.

2036
02:24:17,533 --> 02:24:20,435
Hurting a man won't
change him, father.

2037
02:24:21,266 --> 02:24:24,869
Leave him. I apologize
for him. Let him go.

2038
02:24:25,899 --> 02:24:31,839
Well, father. The truth is
that I am very unfortunate.

2039
02:24:33,266 --> 02:24:35,968
Wherever I have gone, I
have spread destruction.

2040
02:24:36,866 --> 02:24:38,801
Whoever I took to be mine became a. .

2041
02:24:38,866 --> 02:24:41,335
. .stranger, an enemy or he died.

2042
02:24:42,266 --> 02:24:49,139
That is why, for this house
to be safe, I'll leave it.

2043
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:52,236
No, Heera! You won't go!

2044
02:24:57,299 --> 02:24:59,769
Mahinder, change the
path of your life.

2045
02:25:01,166 --> 02:25:04,335
Thank your stars that you
have got such a father.

2046
02:25:05,333 --> 02:25:09,370
If he forgives you, you should
consider yourself lucky.

2047
02:25:10,733 --> 02:25:12,734
Come on, apologize to him.

2048
02:25:13,033 --> 02:25:15,068
Say it, son. Say sorry.

2049
02:25:15,466 --> 02:25:17,734
Unless you apologize
to your father for. .

2050
02:25:17,799 --> 02:25:20,035
. .your sins even God
won't forgive you.

2051
02:25:20,266 --> 02:25:23,936
Look, it's a good chance.
Touch his feet, apologize.

2052
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,735
Say sorry to both of them.
It will be alright.

2053
02:25:25,799 --> 02:25:28,869
They are both elder to you.
Come on, hurry. Come on!

2054
02:25:31,733 --> 02:25:34,368
Father, forgive me!

2055
02:25:56,366 --> 02:26:00,169
Heera.
- Yes, father. - Come upstairs.

2056
02:26:17,299 --> 02:26:21,771
Yes, father. - Heera, the tune
that you were whistling. .

2057
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,201
Yes, it's something I remember
from my childhood.

2058
02:26:24,833 --> 02:26:29,070
Whenever, I feel happy I hum
this tune by Ms. Vidya.

2059
02:26:30,666 --> 02:26:33,802
Vidya..
- Wow! Is it about songs?

2060
02:26:34,033 --> 02:26:37,336
I thought there would never
be any singing in this house.

2061
02:26:37,399 --> 02:26:41,203
Why not?
- Father, I have my birthday today.

2062
02:26:41,399 --> 02:26:43,869
There is sadness all over the house.

2063
02:26:44,066 --> 02:26:45,767
That is why I am quiet too.

2064
02:26:45,799 --> 02:26:47,034
Is it your birthday today?

2065
02:26:47,299 --> 02:26:49,669
Enough! You'll see
how your brother. .

2066
02:26:49,733 --> 02:26:52,869
. .breaks through the
silence and sadness.

2067
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:56,770
Today you'll see how I celebrate
her birthday today.

2068
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:00,736
Happy birthday to you.

2069
02:27:00,799 --> 02:27:04,003
Happy birthday to you.

2070

02:33:42,333 --> 02:33:49,673
My throat is parched. If I have
a drink, it will be wet again.

2162
02:33:50,399 --> 02:33:52,401
Then, I will start speaking.

2163
02:33:54,633 --> 02:33:57,702
Tell me clearly, who is my father?

2164
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:02,804
He is a great man. You will be
very happy to hear about him.

2165
02:34:03,333 --> 02:34:06,269
You'll jump with joy if you see him.

2166
02:34:06,333 --> 02:34:07,400
Tell me, who is he?

2167
02:34:07,466 --> 02:34:10,202
How can I tell you so quickly?

2168
02:34:10,266 --> 02:34:13,602
If you meet your father,
I will be doomed.

2169
02:34:15,466 --> 02:34:17,534
I asked you for my father's name.

2170
02:34:17,933 --> 02:34:20,669
He's a famous man.
I swear, he's great!

2171
02:34:20,733 --> 02:34:23,669
You'll be very happy to see him.

2172
02:34:23,733 --> 02:34:25,267
What's the hurry?

2173
02:34:26,333 --> 02:34:29,636
Alright, I'll tell you
your mother's name.

2174
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:34,270
She was Vidya. She was very rich.

2175
02:34:34,333 --> 02:34:36,802
All her money was
usurped by Kailash.

2176
02:34:36,866 --> 02:34:39,401
He is the one who
made you an orphan.

2177
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:42,869
Your father..
- Yes. What is my father's name?

2178
02:34:43,866 --> 02:34:48,870
He is a great man. You will be
very happy to hear about him.

2179
02:34:48,933 --> 02:34:50,200
Yes but what is his name?

2180
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:52,201
You'll be happy.
- What is my father's name?

2181
02:34:52,666 --> 02:34:54,267
He is a great man..

2182
02:35:04,133 --> 02:35:07,336
You?
- Yes, it's me, sir. Me!

2183
02:35:08,733 --> 02:35:12,670
Sometimes, a man leaves
a small part of his sin.

2184
02:35:13,399 --> 02:35:15,135
Destiny makes that small part much. .

2185
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:16,601
. .bigger and brings it before him.

2186
02:35:16,666 --> 02:35:18,401
As I am standing before you today.

2187
02:35:20,733 --> 02:35:24,670
Look at me, lawyer. I
was small at that time.

2188
02:35:25,733 --> 02:35:28,669
I was weak. Helpless and innocent.

2189
02:35:29,333 --> 02:35:32,135
You were young. Today, you are old.

2190
02:35:33,266 --> 02:35:37,770
You are weak and helpless
and I am young.

2191
02:35:38,833 --> 02:35:42,136
Man has to pay for his good
or bad in this world, sir.

2192
02:35:43,533 --> 02:35:47,270
The boy whom you disowned as
an orphan and a disgrace.

2193
02:35:48,133 --> 02:35:52,136
Today, your daughter
Ioves that orphan.

2194
02:35:53,266 --> 02:35:59,672
What? - The same story can
be repeated in your house.

2195
02:36:02,066 --> 02:36:04,468
A boy like me can be born
in your house as well.

2196
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:10,704
Would you have him
sent away? No, sir.

2197
02:36:12,066 --> 02:36:17,538
You won't do that. This time,
the fate is against you.

2198
02:36:18,466 --> 02:36:21,068
You don't believe me, right?
Ask your daughter.

2199
02:36:22,066 --> 02:36:28,605
Child, is this true?
- Yes, father. I love Heera.

2200
02:36:30,466 --> 02:36:34,069
I hate this wealth and
this fake dignity.

2201
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:40,071
You may assume that your child
died as she was born.

2202
02:36:41,299 --> 02:36:44,069
Or that you had her
sent away with Heera.

2203
02:36:45,166 --> 02:36:47,268
Something that has been thrown
shouldn't be picked.

2204
02:36:48,266 --> 02:36:50,067
This is the rule that you have made.

2205
02:36:51,666 --> 02:36:52,666
Come, Heera.

2206
02:37:03,266 --> 02:37:07,069
Mohini, go back to your house.

2207
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,601
What?
- Yes.

2208
02:37:11,133 --> 02:37:13,602
I have taken revenge
from your father.

2209
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:19,671
I brought you before him.
He was helpless.

2210
02:37:20,666 --> 02:37:25,337
That's all. I have avenged
him. Go back home.

2211
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:29,536
I didn't hold your hands and
Ieave home to go back.

2212
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:32,601
I left to be with you forever.

2213
02:37:33,266 --> 02:37:36,335
No, Mohini. I can't be
accompanied by anyone.

2214
02:37:37,466 --> 02:37:40,335
Destiny couldn't be
with me. How can you?

2215
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,001
I am one of those who are born. .

2216
02:37:45,066 --> 02:37:48,335
. .in this world only
with their body.

2217
02:37:48,633 --> 02:37:53,604
Our fate is undecided
and so are our stars.

2218
02:37:54,533 --> 02:37:55,600
The world doesn't need me.

2219
02:37:55,666 --> 02:37:58,335
I am excess baggage for this world.

2220
02:37:58,533 --> 02:38:02,937
No, Heera. You aren't
a derequisition. You. .

2221
02:38:06,399 --> 02:38:08,335
You are the son of a father?

2222
02:38:11,933 --> 02:38:15,202
Me? The son of a great father.

2223
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:18,667
How do you know this?

2224
02:38:19,333 --> 02:38:24,037
I know. I am telling you
this as I am forced to.

2225
02:38:25,033 --> 02:38:27,201
I am breaking the promise
that I made to your father.

2226
02:38:29,933 --> 02:38:32,135
You are Kunwar Ranvir
Singh's son, Heera.

2227
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:45,338
Ranvir Singh? He is my father?

2228
02:38:47,133 --> 02:38:50,936
Does he know that I am his son?

2229
02:38:51,333 --> 02:38:55,103
Yes, he knows but. .

2230
02:38:58,366 --> 02:39:02,336
But he is helpless!

2231
02:39:07,266 --> 02:39:11,336
Yes. He is helpless.

2232
02:39:12,399 --> 02:39:19,607
He can't call me as his son.

2233
02:39:22,933 --> 02:39:24,467
How can he answer the world?

2234
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:32,205
What will people say?
Kunwar Ranvir Singh.

2235
02:39:33,399 --> 02:39:36,136
The one whom the world takes
to be extremely honest.

2236
02:39:36,266 --> 02:39:43,072
He was born out of wedlock.

2237
02:39:50,466 --> 02:39:52,000
His respect is in danger.

2238
02:39:54,799 --> 02:39:57,802
Just like your father,
my father too feels. .

2239
02:39:57,866 --> 02:40:01,035
. .his respect to be endangered
because of me.

2240
02:40:01,133 --> 02:40:02,434
No, Heera.
- Maybe!

2241
02:40:04,233 --> 02:40:08,804
Maybe you know that I am
the son of a rich man. .

2242
02:40:08,866 --> 02:40:13,804
. .and that is why you
accompanied me. .

2243
02:40:13,866 --> 02:40:19,004
. .and left your father's home.

2244
02:40:19,799 --> 02:40:24,271
What? Why did you speak so lowly?

2245
02:40:26,799 --> 02:40:29,402
Today, you have lost
respect before me.

2246
02:40:31,399 --> 02:40:35,504
I don't just love you, I revere you.

2247
02:40:37,233 --> 02:40:38,801
For the first time,
I have seen a man. .

2248
02:40:38,866 --> 02:40:41,468
. .who doesn't care
about his respect.

2249
02:40:42,866 --> 02:40:46,803
That is what I thought
when I left my house.

2250
02:40:48,066 --> 02:40:51,803
However, you have abused me, Heera.

2251
02:40:52,733 --> 02:40:53,800
You have abused me!

2252
02:40:56,066 --> 02:40:59,736
I thought you would be happy. .

2253
02:40:59,799 --> 02:41:03,803
. .to hear that you are his son.

2254
02:41:04,066 --> 02:41:05,467
What should I do about
this happiness?

2255
02:41:06,866 --> 02:41:09,735
What do I do if I am
the son of a man..

2256
02:41:09,766 --> 02:41:10,967
. .who can't call him as his son?

2257
02:41:11,933 --> 02:41:13,801
That man, Gangu, was better.

2258
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,001
At least he called me his
son when he was drunk.

2259
02:41:16,399 --> 02:41:20,337
I could be proud and say
that he is my father.

2260
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:27,738
If it is so, I swear by our
Iove that I will never..

2261
02:41:27,799 --> 02:41:31,803
. .even by mistake mention
that you are his son.

2262
02:41:33,399 --> 02:41:37,804
I bind you to my word
not to say this.

2263
02:41:46,133 --> 02:41:47,334
Forgive me, Mohini.

2264
02:41:50,333 --> 02:41:53,936
I have been cheated so
many times in life. .

2265
02:41:55,266 --> 02:42:01,071
Now I am confused between our
Ioved ones and outsiders.

2266
02:42:05,666 --> 02:42:07,134
Come, I'll take you
to Kumar's house.

2267
02:42:08,266 --> 02:42:11,669
What? - I told you, you
would be surprised.

2268
02:42:11,899 --> 02:42:14,068
Tell me, do you want
a son or a daughter?

2269
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:16,669
Padma, why are you bringing
a boy and girl in between?

2270
02:42:16,700 --> 02:42:19,135
Our youth is to have fun, my dear.

2271
02:42:19,266 --> 02:42:20,333
I'm telling you the truth, Mahinder.

2272
02:42:20,666 --> 02:42:22,334
I am pregnant with your child.

2273
02:42:22,666 --> 02:42:24,868
Padma! The same old rubbish again.

2274
02:42:24,933 --> 02:42:29,203
Every girl I speak to says
that she is pregnant.

2275
02:42:30,133 --> 02:42:34,670
Are you saying this? I am. .

2276
02:42:34,733 --> 02:42:38,069
What? I would come here in the
morning and the evening.

2277
02:42:38,266 --> 02:42:39,667
Who came here in the afternoon. .

2278
02:42:41,666 --> 02:42:43,868
What is it? Is the truth bitter?

2279
02:42:44,799 --> 02:42:46,301
What are you staring at?

2280
02:42:46,799 --> 02:42:49,369
If you want to complain against
me, go to a market.

2281
02:42:49,666 --> 02:42:52,201
Climb onto a temple.
Shout to the world.

2282
02:42:52,266 --> 02:42:53,867
Say that you are pregnant
with my child.

2283
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,669
If it's still useless,
I have a way out.

2284
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,869
I said, 'listen, Padma is pregnant# 

2285
02:42:59,933 --> 02:43:03,269
He said it's alright.
'Get an abortion done# 

2286
02:43:04,266 --> 02:43:07,335
I said, 'what are you saying?'

2287
02:43:07,399 --> 02:43:10,870
Abortion is a big sin!
It's a great sin.

2288
02:43:10,933 --> 02:43:13,935
'Go and climb onto to the
Red Fort's tall walls# 

2289
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:16,869
'Shout out that you are
pregnant with my child# 

2290
02:43:17,333 --> 02:43:19,101
'If you still don't
feel satisfied. # 

2291
02:43:19,666 --> 02:43:21,667
'Radio singer, go to the
radio station and. .

2292
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:23,168
. .sing songs that would defame me# 

2293
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:29,938
You are still quiet? Kunwar, listen.

2294
02:43:30,266 --> 02:43:33,869
You may be quiet but I won't be.

2295
02:43:33,933 --> 02:43:35,934
I will get justice for my daughter.

2296
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,335
Even if I would have to
reply to your deeds. .

2297
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:41,202
. .I won't hesitate.
I will get justice.

2298
02:43:41,799 --> 02:43:43,268
I have come to change my will.

2299
02:43:43,666 --> 02:43:46,802
Why? For Mahinder..
- I don't want to give him anything.

2300
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,067
Why so?

2301
02:43:49,666 --> 02:43:56,906
We feel sad if we
don't have a child.

2302
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:03,004
If we have a child and he
dies, we feel very sad.

2303
02:44:04,733 --> 02:44:10,672
r
If we have a worthless son
we can't bear it.

2304
02:44:14,133 --> 02:44:18,937
Come here. It will be here.
In this drawer.

2305
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:23,134
Father doesn't let anyone
come to this room.

2306
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:32,203
Vidya! How did this photo come here?

2307
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:38,070
This means Vidya loved Kunwar.

2308
02:44:40,266 --> 02:44:42,868
Heera is Kunwar's son.

2309
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:51,270
Mr. Kunwar!
- Wow! This is my son!

2310
02:44:52,733 --> 02:44:54,201
This is my friend, the lawyer.

2311
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:56,868
Did you come to steal my will?

2312
02:44:57,533 --> 02:44:58,867
This is my will, steal it.

2313
02:44:58,933 --> 02:45:00,868
Mr. Kunwar, I am very sorry.

2314
02:45:00,933 --> 02:45:03,735
Now you'll be really disgraced
before your daughter.

2315
02:45:04,133 --> 02:45:05,534
She is sleeping here
in this very house.

2316
02:45:06,666 --> 02:45:10,669
When she finds out about her
father, she will hate you. .

2317
02:45:10,733 --> 02:45:12,534
Mr. Kunwar!
- As much as I hate my son.

2318
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:15,869
Forgive me.
- Father.

2319
02:45:16,133 --> 02:45:18,735
It will be better if
you kill yourself.

2320
02:45:19,133 --> 02:45:20,934
Forgive me, father.
- Go, get lost!

2321
02:45:21,066 --> 02:45:22,600
What are you doing?

2322
02:45:22,666 --> 02:45:24,667
For a small mistake you are
sending away your son?

2323
02:45:24,733 --> 02:45:26,534
I don't want such a son
to stay in my house.

2324
02:45:26,866 --> 02:45:29,935
If you pity your son,
Ieave along with him.

2325
02:45:30,866 --> 02:45:31,933
Go now!

2326
02:45:44,533 --> 02:45:46,668
Heera isn't just your father's heir.

2327
02:45:47,666 --> 02:45:50,201
He is also the heir
to all my property.

2328
02:45:51,799 --> 02:45:53,468
Your property? How's that?

2329
02:45:54,466 --> 02:45:56,868
His mother had kept it all for him.

2330
02:45:57,799 --> 02:46:00,536
Mahinder, with you I
too will be bankrupt.

2331
02:46:00,866 --> 02:46:03,468
If you delay, remember that you. .

2332
02:46:03,533 --> 02:46:05,468
. .would have to beg all your life.

2333
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,769
You will be as Heera was earlier.

2334
02:46:09,766 --> 02:46:12,935
You employed him but he
won't give you a job.

2335
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,067
What should I do?

2336
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,469
Heera is your enemy and mine too.

2337
02:46:20,666 --> 02:46:23,535
Mahinder, your father insulted
me and threw me out.

2338
02:46:24,466 --> 02:46:27,669
We will have to remove them forever.

2339
02:46:28,066 --> 02:46:31,068
They will have to be cleared.
This is the only way for you.

2340
02:46:31,466 --> 02:46:34,068
My father too?
- Look, Mahinder.

2341
02:46:34,666 --> 02:46:37,802
You have to leave all that
and start life afresh.

2342
02:46:59,399 --> 02:47:02,736
Take Kunwar and get to..
- My. .

2343
02:47:03,866 --> 02:47:05,867
Will you kill Heera?

2344
02:47:16,633 --> 02:47:18,601
Kunwar has been taken to Chandanwadi
by some thugs.

2345
02:47:18,666 --> 02:47:21,135
His life is in danger. Go there
quickly. I'll get the police.

2346
02:47:22,399 --> 02:47:23,467
What happened to Heera?

2347
02:47:23,533 --> 02:47:25,601
Mahinder's men are beating him up.

2348
02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:27,667
Where?
- In Chandanwadi.

2349
02:47:39,799 --> 02:47:40,867
No!

2350
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,002
Gangu! What is it? Who is this man?

2351
02:47:57,066 --> 02:48:01,003
He wants to kill Heera
and Ranvir Singh.

2352
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:02,734
Your father has sent him.

2353
02:48:02,933 --> 02:48:04,000
What? !
- Yes.

2354
02:48:04,933 --> 02:48:07,335
Where is Chandanwadi? Chandanwadi!

2355
02:48:07,399 --> 02:48:08,667
Chandanwadi? It's behind
that mountain.

2356
02:48:08,866 --> 02:48:10,067
It's short-cut is from here.

2357
02:48:10,533 --> 02:48:13,335
Go on. I'll take care
of him. Go carefully.

2358
02:48:17,866 --> 02:48:19,867
Mahinder.
- Lawyer!

2359
02:48:20,333 --> 02:48:21,567
Is everything alright?
- Don't worry.

2360
02:48:21,633 --> 02:48:23,334
I have arranged it in
such a way that. .

2361
02:48:23,366 --> 02:48:25,868
. .father and son will be coming
to save each other.

2362
02:48:26,733 --> 02:48:30,870
Father! Father!

2363
02:48:34,333 --> 02:48:37,335
Heera! Heera!

2364
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,067
Heera !

2365
02:48:43,933 --> 02:48:45,000
Father!

2366
02:48:48,466 --> 02:48:49,533
Heera !

2367
02:48:52,666 --> 02:48:53,700
Father!

2368
02:48:57,366 --> 02:48:58,533
Heera !
- Father!

2369
02:49:00,533 --> 02:49:01,600
Father.

2370
02:49:01,666 --> 02:49:03,267
Heera, are you alright?

2371
02:49:03,333 --> 02:49:04,600
Yes, father. Are you fine?

2372
02:49:05,266 --> 02:49:06,600
The lawyer told me that you. .

2373
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:08,667
Something is wrong, father.

2374
02:49:10,933 --> 02:49:13,735
You fool!

2375
02:49:24,266 --> 02:49:26,868
Father! Father! What have you done?

2376
02:49:27,399 --> 02:49:28,667
You hurt yourself for me?

2377
02:49:30,866 --> 02:49:33,868
Father.
- Mahinder, what is going on?

2378
02:49:34,533 --> 02:49:39,337
This is not blood, son.
This is liquor.

2379
02:49:39,866 --> 02:49:44,870
I drank it all my life due to you.

2380
02:49:45,933 --> 02:49:51,872
Son, I have given you so much
sorrow that I will go to hell.

2381
02:49:53,200 --> 02:50:00,607
I swear, that I will go there
with respect. Right?

2382
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:04,235
Father.
- Mahinder!

2383
02:50:04,433 --> 02:50:06,268
What are you staring at? It's
a good chance. Shoot him!

2384
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:08,667
No, Mahinder!

2385
02:50:12,399 --> 02:50:14,201
Father! Father!

2386
02:50:15,333 --> 02:50:18,469
Don't worry about me, Heera.
Catch that fool.

2387
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:23,936
Bhuka! Heera shouldn't
catch Mahinder!

2388
02:50:24,333 --> 02:50:25,600
Don't spare him.

2389
02:50:29,799 --> 02:50:33,537
Kunwar, you insulted me and
removed me from your house.

2390
02:50:34,433 --> 02:50:36,601
I will kill you today.

2391
02:50:38,266 --> 02:50:39,333
Hands up!

2392
02:50:39,399 --> 02:50:42,469
Mahinder has made everyone
here against you.

2393
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:49,870
Heera gave me this key.
It is to a drawer.

2394
02:50:50,200 --> 02:50:51,401
Many weapons have been placed there.

2395
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:55,537
Move on, coward. Move!
- Wait!

2396
02:50:56,133 --> 02:50:59,536
Now tell them to throw
away their weapons.

2397
02:51:00,733 --> 02:51:03,335
Say it!
- Discard your weaponry.

2398
02:51:05,733 --> 02:51:10,571
Good, now give me your
gun and take handcuffs.

2399
02:51:11,133 --> 02:51:16,137
Stop there! Otherwise I'll
put this into your mouth.

2400
02:51:44,133 --> 02:51:46,401
Move on, lawyer. Let's
go to a police station.

2401
02:51:46,466 --> 02:51:47,867
Now you will have to stay in jail.

2402
02:51:48,133 --> 02:51:50,668
Doctor uncle, you did right.

2403
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:55,069
Catch him! Run! Get him.

2404
02:52:14,066 --> 02:52:16,101
Come along, brothers. Come!

2405
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:20,136
This is your holy man!
Look at his true form.

2406
02:52:21,333 --> 02:52:24,069
Kunwar, it has been many
days since you. .

2407
02:52:24,133 --> 02:52:25,534
. .came to ask about my daughter.

2408
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:28,069
I thought you would call
me and say that. .

2409
02:52:28,133 --> 02:52:31,069
. .this girl is yours
and the boy is mine.

2410
02:52:31,133 --> 02:52:33,468
Just think. You have
a young daughter too.

2411
02:52:33,533 --> 02:52:37,069
If this would happen to her,
would you be quiet?

2412
02:52:37,399 --> 02:52:39,735
Your silence has forced me.

2413
02:52:40,066 --> 02:52:42,067
Kunwar, today there will be justice. .

2414
02:52:42,133 --> 02:52:44,335
. .or the matter will be cleared.

2415
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:48,469
He is quiet! Brothers, move on!

2416
02:52:48,500 --> 02:52:49,567
I say stop!

2417
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:53,536
Don't force me to be as
I was 25 years ago.

2418
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:57,670
I didn't value humanity then.
- Brothers. .

2419
02:54:48,666 --> 02:54:49,733
No!

2420
02:54:51,066 --> 02:54:52,934
No, Heera! No!

2421
02:54:53,066 --> 02:54:54,133
No, Heera!

2422
02:54:54,399 --> 02:54:55,934
No Heera, no!

2423
02:54:56,466 --> 02:54:57,934
Mahinder, every man has to suffer. .

2424
02:54:57,966 --> 02:55:00,335
. .punishment for his deeds.

2425
02:55:01,033 --> 02:55:04,936
If he accepts his crime, his
punishment is reduced.

2426
02:55:05,399 --> 02:55:08,336
Come before father and accept
to your crime. - No.

2427
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:11,002
I ask you for justice, accountant.

2428
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:16,938
Selfish people like you have
ruined my son's life.

2429
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:21,403
Tell me, how should I punish
you? Tell me. Speak!

2430
02:55:21,466 --> 02:55:26,671
Father! Here, I have
brought Mahinder.

2431
02:55:29,533 --> 02:55:30,600
Come on, apologise!

2432
02:55:34,566 --> 02:55:37,535
Father, forgive me.

2433
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:44,071
You are not my son. You're not.

2434
02:55:46,266 --> 02:55:52,271
You are evil from my past
that I have to suffer.

2435
02:55:54,133 --> 02:55:58,604
To atone for my sins, I
feel like killing you.

2436
02:55:59,399 --> 02:56:02,269
So that my sin is finished
along with you.

2437
02:56:04,399 --> 02:56:05,467
However, I won't do so.

2438
02:56:06,299 --> 02:56:09,903
Till today, I have fulfilled
your wants, right and wrong.

2439
02:56:11,399 --> 02:56:13,935
Today, I will fulfill
your last wish too.

2440
02:56:14,333 --> 02:56:16,401
You want to kill me, right?
Take this gun and shoot me.

2441
02:56:17,466 --> 02:56:23,338
Father, I am guilty!
Clear your disgrace!

2442
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:27,203
Shoot me!
- Come. Come, inspector.

2443
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:29,067
Come, quickly.

2444
02:56:29,266 --> 02:56:31,067
We caught the lawyer.
He was running.

2445
02:56:31,333 --> 02:56:32,467
The other party is in the jeep.

2446
02:56:32,533 --> 02:56:34,935
The third is our young master.

2447
02:56:37,533 --> 02:56:38,600
Come, Mr. Mahinder.

2448
02:56:40,266 --> 02:56:42,868
Father! Stop them, father.

2449
02:56:43,299 --> 02:56:48,138
If they take Mahinder,
what will I do?

2450
02:56:48,399 --> 02:56:50,201
I will..
- Don't worry, Padma.

2451
02:56:51,399 --> 02:56:54,469
I will take care of your child.
I will accept you.

2452
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,001
Heera! What are you saying?

2453
02:56:57,066 --> 02:57:00,135
Yes, Mohini. You have everything.

2454
02:57:00,466 --> 02:57:02,267
You can forget me and
spend your life.

2455
02:57:02,333 --> 02:57:04,334
However, I know how
this story will end.

2456
02:57:05,066 --> 02:57:06,467
Another orphaned child will be born!

2457
02:57:07,066 --> 02:57:08,400
He will feel lost in the world.

2458
02:57:08,866 --> 02:57:11,802
He will take his poisonous
life and die. .

2459
02:57:11,833 --> 02:57:14,202
. .or he will become like me.
A tree full of thorns.

2460
02:57:15,833 --> 02:57:18,468
Let me take her.
- No, Heera.

2461
02:57:19,799 --> 02:57:21,468
He won't be a tree with thorns.

2462
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:27,270
He won't be an orphan but
Ranvir Singh's grandson.

2463
02:57:28,799 --> 02:57:31,202
Inspector, take him.

2464
02:57:47,033 --> 02:57:48,100
Father.

2465
02:57:49,299 --> 02:57:53,470
What order do you have
for me, father?

2466
02:57:54,733 --> 02:57:55,800
Heera.

2467
02:58:01,333 --> 02:58:02,467
If you. .

2468
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:07,003
Oh! I understand, father.

2469
02:58:09,399 --> 02:58:10,467
I get it.

2470
02:58:12,866 --> 02:58:14,734
I'm leaving, father.
- Where will you go?

2471
02:58:16,399 --> 02:58:18,368
I'll go anywhere, father,
but I won't stay here.

2472
02:58:21,033 --> 02:58:27,205
You may think that a
servant was with you.

2473
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:35,473
He served you and left.
He left! He left!

2474
02:58:35,733 --> 02:58:38,402
Heera! Wait, Heera!

2475
02:58:38,866 --> 02:58:42,803
Heera! For God's sake! Stop, Heera!

2476
02:58:43,799 --> 02:58:46,202
Don't go, Heera! Don't go.

2477
02:58:46,333 --> 02:58:49,135
Wait, Heera! I'm coming with you.

2478
02:58:50,733 --> 02:58:54,903
Stop, Heera! I bind you
to my word, Heera!

2479
02:58:54,966 --> 02:58:56,100
Stop, Heera!

2480
02:58:56,899 --> 02:58:58,001
Heera stop! Heera!

2481
02:58:58,066 --> 02:58:59,133
Heera !

2482
02:59:00,266 --> 02:59:02,067
Stop Heera! For God's
sake! Stop, Heera!

2483
02:59:03,066 --> 02:59:05,334
Don't go, Heera! Don't go.

2484
02:59:05,399 --> 02:59:07,201
Stop, Heera! Heera!

2485
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:09,067
Heera !

2486
02:59:12,933 --> 02:59:16,803
Look, I am an unfortunate father.

2487
02:59:17,799 --> 02:59:19,668
I don't have anyone
to clear my tears.

2488
02:59:21,933 --> 02:59:23,134
Stop, Heera!

2489
02:59:26,799 --> 02:59:30,069
You are not an orphan, I am!

2490
02:59:32,666 --> 02:59:33,800
Stop, my son!

2491
02:59:41,399 --> 02:59:43,668
I can't be assured
about my life, son.

2492
02:59:45,333 --> 02:59:49,804
Only an elder son gives fire
to his father's pyre.

2493
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:53,068
Don't take away my right.

2494
02:59:53,866 --> 02:59:56,201
Don't take away my right, my son.

2495
02:59:57,833 --> 03:00:01,002
Come back, son!
- Father.

2496
03:00:26,600 --> 03:00:29,602
''He may be. .''

2497
03:00:31,133 --> 03:00:35,704
''He may be delayed. .''

2498
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:40,270
''But he will never leave us.''

2499
03:00:40,600 --> 03:00:43,602
''Good deeds.. ''

2500
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:49,804
''Every good deed is rewarded,
friends.''

2501
03:00:49,866 --> 03:00:53,536
''The one who doesn't have
anyone has God, friends.''

2502

''The one who doesn't have
