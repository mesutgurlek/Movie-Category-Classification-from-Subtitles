1
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,332
"You exist in the blue sky"

2
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:44,336
"You exist in soft buds"

3
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:48,749
"You exist in the
movement of the earth"

4
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:52,753
"You exist in
every moment of life"

5
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:58,350
"O God, wonder what
each one's zenith is here"

6
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:06,292
"O God, wonder what
each one's zenith is here"

7
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:13,301
"You are the strength of the heart,
everyone's hope"

8
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:16,305
"You are everyone's companion"

9
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:21,309
"You are the strength of the heart,
everyone's hope"

10
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:23,709
"You are everyone's companion"

11
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,331
"You exist in the heat of the sun"

12
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:49,337
"You exist in the
softness of winds"

13
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:53,748
"You exist in running streams"

14
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:57,343
"You exist in the flight of birds"

15
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:03,292
"Everyone looks for
his zenith here"

16
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:11,290
"O God, wonder what
each one zenith is here"

17
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,298
"O God, you are the true summit
of everyone's path"

18
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,299
"Zenith!"

19
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:38,717
The facility GG Builder gives, no
other builder in Mumbai can give.

20
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:43,324
You are intelligent.
You can verify everything.

21
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:48,736
See for yourself. You have
invested in the right place.

22
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,731
Your money will bring you
rich dividends in the future.

23
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:55,072
Only if this government survives.

24
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,336
The political situation is in chaos.

25
00:03:57,414 --> 00:04:00,679
The moment the government falls,
property prices will crash.

26
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:02,615
How can we invest more
in such a situation?

27
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:06,281
The interest rate GG gives,
no one else in the market does

28
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:08,017
And GG is no ordinary man.

29
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,623
No one had even heard of
him six years ago.

30
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:12,685
Today, he is the
top builder of the city.

31
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:15,289
Mr. GG has come.

32
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,290
Who among you wants
his money back?

33
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:21,303
What to do, sir?
Political crisis is on.

34
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,033
The government can fall any time.

35
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,303
The moment the CM falls,
even property prices will fall.

36
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:31,712
Neither will the CM fall,
nor property rates.

37
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,715
My offer still stands.

38
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,718
Want back your money,
I'll return it.

39
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:42,715
But remember, I will never
take money from you again.

40
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,317
Mr. GG, you are getting angry.

41
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,731
It's simple.
One can either sulk, or smile.

42
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,325
You can't do both together.

43
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,331
But GG,
think about the investors too.

44
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:02,678
One, the government won't fall.

45
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,271
And two, either fly in
the sky with me...

46
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,681
or crawl on ground like worms.

47
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:12,686
Glory to Amrit Patil.

48
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,684
This is great!
All good ministries, you will take.

49
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:22,696
And you expect me to show the
thumb to my party workers?

50
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:27,292
Sorry. Jaihind!

51
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:32,707
Patil, I'll give you
Labour, Water...

52
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:38,303
How will that help?
Tell me... how?

53
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:43,311
Agriculture, Health, Transport will
all stay with you. Even Garments.

54
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,711
You think I am a fool?

55
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:49,314
Stop being immature, Patil.

56
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:53,326
I'm giving you more
than you can digest.

57
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:58,732
Look CM, if I don't get
Rural Development ministry...

58
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:01,269
I'm not joining the government.

59
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:09,678
Great! You have learnt to bargain.

60
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,669
Good.

61
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:17,686
But remember, in the next
two years...

62
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:21,280
you will not make any more demands.

63
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:24,283
And if this condition
is acceptable to you...

64
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:26,694
congratulations for
the new government.

65
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:30,288
To you too.

66
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:35,294
Glory to Amrit Patil!

67
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:39,298
Silence please!

68
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:46,305
Look I only want to say...

69
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:51,710
for the progress of the state, and
for the welfare of the people...

70
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:55,723
our Party will
support this government.

71
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:58,726
But you were against the ruling
government during the election.

72
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:00,990
Isn't this cheating the people?

73
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:05,667
No, in politics, there is no
cheating, only decisions.

74
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:08,260
Sir, is it true that you
are getting Land...

75
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:11,273
and Rural Development ministry,
that is why...

76
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:16,268
Look, who gets what is
a matter of destiny.

77
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,273
It's day somewhere,
and night somewhere.

78
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:24,278
Glory to Amrit Patil!

79
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:33,694
Amrit Patil took the oath...

80
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:36,698
of Land and Rural
Development Minister today.

81
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,291
I, Amrit Patil...

82
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,701
"Why are you smiling so much?"

83
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:54,716
My love, life is
such a beautiful gamble.

84
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:59,311
I had thrown a fib to my investors,
that the government won't fall.

85
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:02,256
And it didn't.
Amrit Patil became king.

86
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,250
He became the
Rural Development Minister.

87
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:08,661
- Did you congratulate him?
- I'll give it to him personally.

88
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:17,262
400 years ago, Mumbai was
a group of seven islands...

89
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,266
where a few fishermen lived.

90
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,678
Which the Portuguese
gifted to the English.

91
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,273
Who had imagined such a
big city will come up here...

92
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:31,685
where business in billions
will be done.

93
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:40,289
Just think, who must have dared to
dream of building such a big city?

94
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:45,700
One man does not see the dream of
building a city.

95
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:49,695
Only one man sees a dream, Natasha.

96
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,676
Dreams cannot be seen in a group.

97
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:56,702
Last night, even I saw a dream.

98
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:00,043
Come to the bedroom,
I'll tell you about it.

99
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:05,654
Natasha, when I am thinking,
let me think.

100
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:24,673
City? Must say GG, you still
have the dream of building a city?

101
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,269
GG, you need thousands of acres
of land for it.

102
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:30,676
And this entire region
belongs to tribals.

103
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,272
It is not easy to buy tribal land.

104
00:09:33,683 --> 00:09:36,277
There are a hundred laws,
thousand hurdles.

105
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:41,020
And you are not talking of
building a colony, but a city.

106
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,282
To build a city,
roads, hospitals, schools...

107
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,623
Shopping malls, multiplexes,
business centers...

108
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:47,686
amusement parks, hotels, clubs.

109
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:54,702
Yes, I am talking of a city.

110
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:56,997
Have you ever been to Las Vegas?

111
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:59,002
That's a place for players
like you.

112
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,300
I'll go if you take me.

113
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:05,704
Las Vegas; there was nothing there,
except a desert.

114
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,308
Not as many people come to
see the Taj Mahal in a year...

115
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:11,319
as many people go to gamble there
everyday.

116
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:13,311
Why?

117
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:18,317
Because just one man saw the dream
of building a city in a desert.

118
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:24,323
Just think, our own city, where we
will have monopoly over everything.

119
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,734
Security, electricity, water,
business, transport, everything!

120
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,330
And if we get permission for
casinos...

121
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:33,342
just think what can be done.

122
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,335
The investment
is of 8-9 hundred million.

123
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,339
And it can become a business of
30-50 thousand millions.

124
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:43,742
I'm not convinced, GG,

125
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:50,349
Mr. Patil, the region is yours,
the government is yours.

126
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,354
The financier is ready,
then what is your problem?

127
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:56,357
We will decide
your share beforehand.

128
00:10:57,367 --> 00:11:04,296
'Let those who are looking
for God, find Him'

129
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,308
- Mukadam.
- Yes sir?

130
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:18,312
GG, he's Mukadam.
He handles all my business here.

131
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,315
Take Mr. GG
around the whole of Songarh.

132
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,715
GG, the dream is wonderful.

133
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:26,659
I've come across a man who dreams
with open eyes for the first time.

134
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,721
But until the dream materializes,
keep your eyes open.

135
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:32,733
They will stay open.

136
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:36,737
Mr. Patil... good night.

137
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:49,344
Mukadam, tell me,
what do these tribals do?

138
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:52,013
They do some farming now.

139
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:54,346
Earlier, there used to be
a drought here every year.

140
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,693
It's barren all around here.
I haven't see a single tree.

141
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:03,688
Show me some place where there
is greenery, there is water.

142
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,699
This area won't do.

143
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:10,705
This area is dry.
There is no water here.

144
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:14,301
Go towards the east,
there is water over there.

145
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:18,712
I heard some Guru has done
water harvesting there.

146
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:21,306
Even a huge lake
has been formed there.

147
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:36,730
What is that?

148
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:41,736
- That is Rishi-Van Ashram (Home).
- Ashram? It's heaven.

149
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:45,332
Know why King Jahangir
called Kashmir heaven?

150
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:48,334
Because he had
not seen this place.

151
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:51,346
Sir, who is King Jahangir?

152
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:56,343
The world's greatest builder,
Shahjahan, who made the Taj Mahal...

153
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:57,750
- his father.
- Oh!

154
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:00,085
Let's go there.

155
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:13,692
- Greetings Swamiji.
- Shubham (good wishes).

156
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,294
Vehicles are not allowed
inside the Ashram.

157
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,699
Sir, we will have
to walk from here.

158
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:27,706
Sir, about 50 years ago,
this Sage Vaidyanath...

159
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:29,307
started this Ashram.

160
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,050
If he is available,
we'll meet him.

161
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,311
No sir, he died 5-6 years ago.

162
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:35,054
They are into medicine business?

163
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:38,054
Not business, they distribute
Ayurvedic medicines...

164
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:39,726
since his times to people
for free.

165
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,729
There is a new Guru
who runs the Ashram now.

166
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:43,730
Their medicines are very effective.

167
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,324
Some years ago,
he even started an orphanage here.

168
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:48,734
He takes care of orphans,
distributes medicines for free.

169
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:50,737
What's his income?

170
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,331
I mean, where does he
get so much money from?

171
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:55,742
I don't know that, sir.
Come.

172
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:04,014
He is Mr. GG,
he wants to meet Guruji.

173
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:10,283
Guruji? Not possible today.
Today is Guruji's inspection day.

174
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:14,286
Wonder where he will be now.

175
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:16,354
It is better you
come some other day.

176
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:23,295
Is this Guru the sort who prays
and gives religious discourses?

177
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,705
No sir, this Ashram has no
connection with any religion.

178
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:29,039
It is said the doors of Rishi-Van
are open to people of all religions.

179
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:35,307
I'm sorry,
but smoking is prohibited here.

180
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:27,291
Hey Guruji!

181
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,301
Guruji, not me... he...

182
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:44,709
Because of the mistake of these
two, Guruji is fasting since 3 days.

183
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:47,312
He has not eaten anything.

184
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:51,316
You two will go to Guruji now
and apologise to him.

185
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:09,668
We will never smoke again.

186
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,683
We will not even fight again.
We made a mistake, Guruji.

187
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:20,687
Please eat, Guruji.

188
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:28,695
- You won't do it again?
- No.

189
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:38,796
Guruji, there is bad news.

190
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:43,301
I've heard Minister Patil's men
are buying land from the villagers.

191
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:52,720
- Ramnath, drink.
- Enough!

192
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:56,723
Drink free liquor and die!

193
00:16:57,326 --> 00:16:58,725
Guruji is coming!

194
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:01,253
They are giving them free liquor
all day and night.

195
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:03,655
What will you talk to them,
Guruji?

196
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:06,666
Forget the Guruji. Drink!

197
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:10,670
Guruji cannot do anything to you.

198
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:15,676
Guruji will suppress you.
He won't let you progress.

199
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:19,270
Don't worry. The Minister has said
everyone will get a room...

200
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:20,679
and a ration card in Mumbai.

201
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,689
What is wrong with you people?

202
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:33,693
I fought for so many years with
the government...

203
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:37,288
and got you this land, and
you are selling it and leaving?

204
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,294
You don't know what you are doing.

205
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:48,299
Listen, tell Minister Patil
what he is doing is not right.

206
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,710
And I will not keep quiet.

207
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:05,659
- What did Talati say? All done?
- Yes.

208
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:10,655
Mukadam, this is Rs.1500000,
for petty expenses.

209
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:13,258
Give me an account
for this separately.

210
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,262
Khhote, whatever land
you are buying...

211
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:20,665
ensure the papers are in order.

212
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:24,678
And all the money should be given
through the Assembly's office.

213
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:29,276
Leave it to me, sir. Everything
will be done in a legal manner.

214
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:39,284
It was surprising.
I thought we'll have to use force.

215
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:43,695
GG, you are very lucky.
People are queuing up to sell land.

216
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:46,700
I am not teaching a minister...

217
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:50,704
but there is no place in the world
where money doesn't talk.

218
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:53,673
- Hello sir.
- Hello.

219
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:55,300
15 acres land. Pandurang Jadhav.

220
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:57,709
Rs.2000 for one acre,
Rs.30000 for 15 acres.

221
00:18:58,314 --> 00:19:02,648
Witness, chief of Usla village.
Take. One, two three. 30000.

222
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:04,651
Put your thumb impression.
...The left hand.

223
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:52,290
People of other states are
coming and taking over Mumbai.

224
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:55,693
When our government is giving
houses for free...

225
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:59,706
then you have the first right
to take advantage of it.

226
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,710
It is my responsibility
to give you electricity and water.

227
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:08,046
A building will come up here
in two years...

228
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:10,308
and you all will get a home in it.

229
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:21,719
Sell hope,
and remain the winning candidate.

230
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:25,325
I've given you a permanent
vote bank for free.

231
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:27,335
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

232
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:33,707
Sir, I took Rs.10000 from each
person for a 10x10 room.

233
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:36,343
That's called killing
three birds with one stone.

234
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,079
Only if the work is done
on a war footing...

235
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:45,343
will we be able to give
infrastructure for a city...

236
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:46,752
at the earliest.

237
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:59,359
Time is money applies most
to construction business.

238
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:02,303
GG city will be such a city...

239
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,705
which the people of India
must not even have dreamt of.

240
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,709
This is Phase I.

241
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:15,309
Amusement park, five star club,
along with a golf course.

242
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,309
The moment it is ready,
people will start coming here.

243
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:20,719
Then with that money,
and money from the club...

244
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:22,313
we will start Phase II.

245
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:23,380
Housing.

246
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:26,319
The plan is very good.

247
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:31,325
But for that, Patil,
I want this Ashram land.

248
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,337
Have patience, GG, When all
the surrounding land is ours...

249
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:38,340
then even the tribals will leave.

250
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:41,073
Then what will the Guruji
sit here alone and do?

251
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,742
Even he will leave.

252
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:49,681
Every green leaf here,
every branch, tree...

253
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:51,743
is the result of Guruji's
hard work and effort.

254
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,345
This land was barren before.

255
00:21:54,757 --> 00:21:56,748
We have to stop Minister Patil.

256
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,089
He will turn this beautiful
jungle to a concrete jungle.

257
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,033
Lawyer, what do we do about Patil?
Have you given it a thought?

258
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,294
Just one straight solution.

259
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,300
We will have to take a
stay order from court...

260
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:15,310
and stop this construction.

261
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:33,718
- Who is your Supervisor?
- What is it?

262
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,722
You will have to stop
construction immediately.

263
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:38,822
Why?

264
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:40,665
This is a copy of
the writ petition.

265
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:42,067
What's in it?

266
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:46,330
Ask your boss to ask his lawyer.

267
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:56,344
The court case will go on.
I own this place.

268
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,749
Have faith in me.

269
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,624
If construction
stops, I will be ruined

270
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:05,683
Millions have gone
into the project.

271
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:09,025
Can't you do anything about
this old Guru?

272
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,701
If you like,
I can get him killed any time.

273
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:16,032
I can make him
disappear like smoke.

274
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:19,706
But before that,
we must check his background.

275
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:24,712
Who he is, what is his goal,
we must know this.

276
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:28,706
- Wait until then.
- Wait?

277
00:23:28,817 --> 00:23:29,806
Yes.

278
00:23:29,918 --> 00:23:31,647
You want me to stop
construction until then?

279
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,712
Keep the construction going,
I'll see what is to be done.

280
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,700
Do you consider a writ petition
notice to be a joke?

281
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:21,792
What happened?

282
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:26,001
Now the Bailiff and government
officers are our witness.

283
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:27,707
Give him the stay order.

284
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,703
You got the notice to stop
construction two weeks ago.

285
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:35,306
And you are still working?

286
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:38,709
Take this stay order seriously.

287
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:43,314
If you continue with the
construction work still...

288
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:45,724
there'll be a
contempt of court case.

289
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:50,662
Lawyer, we are making a park, then
where is the contempt of court?

290
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:53,326
The stay order is on
entire construction.

291
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:57,330
Now you cannot do any work
anywhere in this area.

292
00:24:57,739 --> 00:24:59,730
We will settle this between us.

293
00:25:01,276 --> 00:25:04,677
Sure we'll settle it.
Stop all work!

294
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:21,694
You can wait for the stay order
to be canceled, we cannot.

295
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:23,696
Tell us when you are
returning our money.

296
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,699
What is the current situation?

297
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:33,673
Look, you have supported me so
much, just a little more.

298
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,301
If the work does not
start in three months...

299
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:39,704
you will get back your money.

300
00:25:48,724 --> 00:25:54,720
- What will you do now, GG?
- I'll do something.

301
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:59,732
- Can I do anything for you?
- What will you do?

302
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:14,682
GG, this Guru turned out to
be a big shot. Know who he is?

303
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:17,684
He's Srinath Vardhan, the owner
of Vardhan Industries.

304
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,687
Crossing swords with him
will cost us dear.

305
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,020
We have got a stay order.
And moreover...

306
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:26,693
you and me are nothing
compared to Vardhan Industries.

307
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:30,697
You said it today, Mr. Patil,
don't say it again.

308
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,291
10 years ago,
I didn't have Rs.3000...

309
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:35,302
and in the next three years, I'll
gift wrap Vardhan Industries...

310
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:36,702
and gift it to you.

311
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:39,296
First hear the good news.

312
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:45,303
The Ashram land was given to this
Guru's Guru, Sage Vaidyanath...

313
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,317
on a 50 year lease.
That lease is expiring next year.

314
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:52,649
So what?
He will ask for lease again.

315
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:57,715
He has. 50 years. He has even
made an application to the CM.

316
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:00,659
The CM has not accepted it,
nor will he.

317
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:02,652
Why?

318
00:27:02,864 --> 00:27:07,267
Because I saved this government
from falling.

319
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:09,998
And I only will
save it in the future.

320
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:16,268
GG, just one year. You'll have
to wait until the lease gets over.

321
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:19,677
One year? Are you crazy?

322
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:21,681
If everything stays like
this for a year...

323
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:24,013
my machinery worth millions
will rot away.

324
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:26,277
What do I do with it?
Sell it as scrap?

325
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,016
I'm paying interest
on millions of rupees.

326
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,690
What can we do now, GG?

327
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,286
We'll have to do something.

328
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:37,288
That mad old man must be having
some weakness.

329
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:44,295
Just let me get one loose end and
I'll pull the wool and strip him.

330
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:47,707
Just one weakness!

331
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:21,268
"My heart... my heart..."

332
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:25,678
"These bright rays"

333
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:31,275
"Shined in the mirror of life"

334
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:35,279
"These bright rays"

335
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:37,689
"Shined in the mirror of life"

336
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:40,020
"This fight between sun and shade"

337
00:28:40,295 --> 00:28:42,024
"The heart and body dances
with abandon"

338
00:28:42,297 --> 00:28:44,697
"Everything seems new"

339
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:53,674
"My heart... my heart..."

340
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:57,701
"These bright rays"

341
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:01,646
"Shined in the mirror of life"

342
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:28,268
"In the lap of earth
is that dream valley"

343
00:29:28,343 --> 00:29:32,677
"Where I had left
my childhood friend"

344
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:35,681
"Wonder what will happen next"

345
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:38,014
"The winds feel different"

346
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:42,279
"What I have felt is lovely"

347
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:50,688
"Sometimes I think I'll say this"

348
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,292
"Sometimes I think I'll say that"

349
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:59,296
"Sometimes I think I'll say this"

350
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:02,037
"Sometimes I think I'll say that"

351
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:06,303
"He sometimes seems my very own,
and sometimes a dream"

352
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:08,706
"Everything seems new"

353
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:17,725
"My heart... my heart..."

354
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:45,080
"The peace of day is lost"

355
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:47,685
"The sleep of night is lost"

356
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:51,749
"Someone seems to be
in my memory these days"

357
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:54,752
"If I meet him alone"

358
00:30:55,363 --> 00:30:57,354
"I'll tell him"

359
00:30:57,766 --> 00:31:01,702
"How crazy I am
about this dream lover"

360
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:10,303
"These bright rays"

361
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:14,305
"Shined in the mirror of life"

362
00:31:16,318 --> 00:31:18,309
"These bright rays"

363
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,711
"Shined in the mirror of life"

364
00:31:21,323 --> 00:31:23,314
"This fight between sun and shade"

365
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:26,057
"The heart and body dances
with abandon"

366
00:31:26,328 --> 00:31:28,057
"Everything seems new"

367
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:36,738
"My heart... my heart..."

368
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:42,335
"My heart... my heart..."

369
00:31:42,744 --> 00:31:46,737
"My heart... my heart..."

370
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:51,752
"My heart... my heart..."

371
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:56,347
"My heart... my heart..."

372
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,348
Take.

373
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:02,025
Homi Wadia, careful, it's hot.

374
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:05,027
Forget it.
If you cared so much for me...

375
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,632
you would not come here
and become a recluse.

376
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:11,001
I knew you will take care of
Vardhan Industries well.

377
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,295
Which you have.

378
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:15,699
Now stop buttering me
and listen to me.

379
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,302
You withdrew your son from
a good school...

380
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,711
and gave him an education here.

381
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,645
Did I say anything? No.

382
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:24,708
What will the poor guy do learning
horticulture and tissue culture?

383
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:27,319
Who will run the mill
and industries?

384
00:32:27,422 --> 00:32:31,051
I'll take your son, Jaidev to
Mumbai and teach him business.

385
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:34,727
Homi, even I want that he joins
you...

386
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:37,730
so that you teach him
the ways of business.

387
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:42,726
- Even Jaidev is like your son.
- Come, sit.

388
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:46,034
We have come to take you to Mumbai.

389
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,740
Whatever Baba(father) wishes.

390
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:50,743
He will surely come. Let him
stay with me for a few days.

391
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,337
- He has just come.
- Yes, stay.

392
00:32:53,415 --> 00:32:56,350
But come to Mumbai soon
and manage your father's company.

393
00:32:58,753 --> 00:32:59,742
Thank you.

394
00:32:59,954 --> 00:33:03,685
Jaidev will have to go to Mumbai
and learn business management.

395
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:13,290
Punditji, Madhavi has
completed graduation.

396
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:16,701
I have told you many times
to find a suitable groom for her.

397
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:20,706
There is no need.
I won't leave you and go anywhere.

398
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:23,300
Even I won't leave
you and go anywhere.

399
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:24,367
Let's go, Manasi.

400
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:31,308
You spoke of taking
three people to Singapore.

401
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:32,375
Yes Baba.

402
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:36,720
Then take Kusum, Bajanlal,
and Madhavi.

403
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:39,318
How many days will you have to go?

404
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,055
The training will take 1-2 weeks.

405
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:43,729
I am going to Singapore for taking
equipment for the tissue lab.

406
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:47,733
I thought the three will also get
training on how to operate it.

407
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:52,739
Good idea. Then even if you are in
Mumbai, work will go on here.

408
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:53,808
Yes Baba.

409
00:33:57,345 --> 00:34:01,281
This laboratory, technology,
how will we learn all this?

410
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:06,279
Jaidev is such an idiot!

411
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:09,020
Just keep listening to that
guy who talks in circles.

412
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,283
Mr. Bhajanlal, MA. LLb Allahabad.
Are you coming to Singapore?

413
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:15,693
- Ofcourse.
- Very good.

414
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:18,697
But only if Guruji wishes
and the government permits.

415
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,291
Because as per law,
every Indian...

416
00:34:21,336 --> 00:34:25,295
has a right to live within India
without a passport or visa...

417
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,639
but if you wish to go abroad,
you have to have a passport and...

418
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,703
Enough! Stop your lecture.
I understood.

419
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:41,712
Jaidev was telling me he will make
20 bigger green houses than this.

420
00:34:42,323 --> 00:34:45,724
He will grow 500000 plants,
that too, only in eight months...

421
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:47,055
and before the rains.

422
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:54,666
He also said you, me and Bhajanlal
will have to go to Singapore...

423
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:55,725
for training.

424
00:34:56,337 --> 00:35:01,604
He told you, then you go.
He didn't tell me, I won't go.

425
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:04,668
The one who doesn't want to go,
go and talk to Guruji.

426
00:35:06,281 --> 00:35:09,682
Kusum, tell me, what do you
know about plants and trees?

427
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:14,678
- That trees & plants are green...
- Wow!

428
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,021
Trees and plants are green. And
they are red, yellow and blue too.

429
00:35:19,294 --> 00:35:23,287
Trees? Do you know the different
names of trees? Count.

430
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:31,295
- How many?
- 16. - There are more.

431
00:35:33,308 --> 00:35:35,708
Bhajanlal, the lecture is over.

432
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:47,311
Your going to Mumbai and learning
business is important.

433
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:49,713
Homi has to retire too.

434
00:35:49,824 --> 00:35:51,724
But Baba, what about your dream?

435
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:56,730
- So you remember my dream?
- You have just one dream.

436
00:35:57,332 --> 00:36:00,324
To see this barren land
green and bountiful.

437
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:04,661
Baba, I will plants millions of
trees and fulfil your dream.

438
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:07,673
That's the day I am waiting for.

439
00:36:09,277 --> 00:36:14,271
Today, I want to teach you
my principle of business.

440
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:19,016
Look son, the power to give
something to the world...

441
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:20,618
exists only in goodness.

442
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:24,283
Whereas evil only knows to
snatch and loot.

443
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:28,287
Thieves, bandits, fiends
can only snatch from others.

444
00:36:28,696 --> 00:36:32,291
They cannot give anything,
except sorrow.

445
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:37,304
Whenever you meet someone,
weigh him on this scale.

446
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:41,707
Test whether he is out
to give something to the world...

447
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,699
or to snatch.

448
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:47,304
But Baba, if we only give,
how will we earn?

449
00:36:47,382 --> 00:36:48,713
How will business prosper?

450
00:36:49,317 --> 00:36:54,311
Earn... earn lots. But spend
a big part of your money...

451
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:56,713
for the betterment of society.

452
00:36:57,725 --> 00:37:00,057
Then you will get the real motive
for your earning...

453
00:37:00,328 --> 00:37:02,660
and the love of society.

454
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:07,667
And this love from society
will be your true earning.

455
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,265
Your true wealth.
Understood, son?

456
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,274
Son, I am your father's
greatest critic...

457
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,684
but actually respect him a lot.

458
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:32,282
Which man will leave so much money
today and serve poor tribals?

459
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,704
30 years ago, when your
father started this industry...

460
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:49,299
I owned 25% shares of this company.

461
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:54,304
This is a different world, son.
This is the world of business.

462
00:37:55,316 --> 00:38:00,652
I'll show you how we turn
cotton into money here.

463
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:04,648
Your basic principle of business
should be...

464
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:09,662
that the quality of your goods
should be the best in the market.

465
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:12,664
And its pricing should
also be the best.

466
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:16,668
This is your father's philosophy.

467
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:22,268
And to achieve this, we have put
up the most modern machinery here.

468
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:25,676
So that we can have maximum
cost effective production.

469
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,680
Ultimately, the success of
a business depends on...

470
00:38:29,283 --> 00:38:31,683
how you handle your manpower.

471
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:35,687
To take this company ahead
is your responsibility.

472
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,282
Now this is the annual report.
Please study it.

473
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:47,691
Excellent Mr. Prem. I knew
you were into many businesses.

474
00:38:47,902 --> 00:38:50,700
And the dealership of
Vardhan Industries, that's great.

475
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:56,299
I have a business proposal
with which both of us can benefit.

476
00:38:56,711 --> 00:39:00,647
Can you fix my meeting
with Jaidev Vardhan?

477
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:03,649
I have been selling the cloth
of their mill in my showroom...

478
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:04,979
since the last 20 years...

479
00:39:05,253 --> 00:39:09,656
and you are asking for a meeting?
Assume the meeting is fixed.

480
00:39:10,258 --> 00:39:15,662
By the way, does this Jaidev
have any friend in Mumbai?

481
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:20,257
He has just come to Mumbai.
He has no friends here.

482
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:25,262
If I had his phone number,
I would fix the meeting now.

483
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:30,676
- Mr. Prem, treat this as urgent.
- It will be done, GG,

484
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:38,684
- Some more coffee, Mr. Prem?
- No, I'll be going.

485
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:46,693
GG's idea is great.
It's between you two, you decide.

486
00:39:47,295 --> 00:39:48,694
- All the best to you.
- Thanks Mr. Prem.

487
00:39:48,796 --> 00:39:50,696
Don't mention it. See you.

488
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,693
Jaidev, Vardhan Industries
makes the best cloth in the world.

489
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:00,697
But who knows this?
You don't advertise.

490
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:04,039
You are right.
But whatever cloth we produce...

491
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:08,305
it gets sold without advertising.
Then why spend on advertising?

492
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:11,046
That's what I am telling you.

493
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,310
How much do you sell your
best quality cloth for?

494
00:40:13,387 --> 00:40:15,321
Suppose Rs.1000/mtr.

495
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:17,657
If the same cloth is given
a fashion label...

496
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:19,317
like Armani, YSL...

497
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:22,719
a pant of the same material
will get sold for Rs.10000.

498
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:26,666
Our profit will be ten times more.

499
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:27,723
Mr. GG!

500
00:40:29,337 --> 00:40:31,328
This is Ashwin Raga,
India's topmost designer.

501
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:33,704
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you. Call me Raga.

502
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:37,336
Jaidev Vardhan.
I was telling him...

503
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:40,346
What is there to say? Whatever
GG lays his hands on turns to gold.

504
00:40:40,748 --> 00:40:43,740
Construction, travel,
exports you name it.

505
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:46,343
That's why I want to give
Vardhan textiles a fashion label.

506
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:51,348
All the finance will be mine,
the designs of Raga...

507
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:54,758
and the cloth of Vardhan.
What say?

508
00:40:56,364 --> 00:40:58,355
If you don't mind,
shall I ask you a question?

509
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:01,299
There are other mills who
don't advertise.

510
00:41:01,702 --> 00:41:03,294
Then why did you come to me only?

511
00:41:04,305 --> 00:41:06,705
Every big textile company
has its own fashion label.

512
00:41:07,308 --> 00:41:11,301
And if I join hands with any
company, it won't be news.

513
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:15,713
GG is stepping into fashion
business for the first time. News!

514
00:41:16,317 --> 00:41:18,308
With top designer Raga,
bigger news.

515
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,720
With Vardhan textiles.
Front page headlines!

516
00:41:23,324 --> 00:41:26,725
Jaidev, I only want your material,
that too on credit.

517
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:29,057
I'm giving you one third
partnership...

518
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,731
that too, only in profits.
Losses will be mine. Only mine.

519
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:37,327
Your offer is indeed very good.

520
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:39,339
I'll speak to Uncle Wadia
and let you know.

521
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:44,743
Look Jaidev,
fashion is for young people.

522
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:47,075
Today's generation,
young minds, you see.

523
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:49,339
People like Wadia
won't understand it.

524
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,741
That is why he didn't advertise
until today.

525
00:41:52,353 --> 00:41:55,345
I'd heard your praises,
that is why I contacted you.

526
00:41:56,357 --> 00:41:58,348
I will deal only with you.

527
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,693
And Vardhan Industries belongs
to you people...

528
00:42:03,297 --> 00:42:07,700
- then this Uncle Wadia...?
- He is my father's partner.

529
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:11,695
And your father, Mr. Vardhan?

530
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:13,295
My father?

531
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:17,300
- He doesn't manage business now.
- Oh.

532
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:21,042
Okay, let's have lunch.
The steaks here are good.

533
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:23,715
Sorry, I don't eat non-vegetarian.

534
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:26,047
Even the vegetarian must be good.

535
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,309
Hello!

536
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:34,317
- The super model is here!
- Hi Raga.

537
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,730
- Jaidev Vardhan.
- Industrialist.

538
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:41,065
But you look like a model.

539
00:42:42,336 --> 00:42:43,735
- Hi Jaidev.
- Hi.

540
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:47,333
- Shall I call you Jai?
- Yes, sure.

541
00:42:48,342 --> 00:42:51,334
Nats, GG's fashionable idea.
Fantastic!

542
00:42:51,412 --> 00:42:53,744
Great? So when are you starting?

543
00:42:54,348 --> 00:42:57,749
- Whenever Jaidev says.
- Not Jaidev, Jai.

544
00:43:00,354 --> 00:43:02,686
Sorry, what is this wella?

545
00:43:04,692 --> 00:43:09,686
- Wella means... it means...
- Wella waiter, menu.

546
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:15,701
- Only in profit.
- Yes, I understood.

547
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:19,296
Just think uncle, every textile
company has its own fashion label.

548
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,364
I know.

549
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:22,705
Because of this fashion label,
they sell the same cloth...

550
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:25,301
at double-triple rates,
and make more profits.

551
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:28,712
- I have checked everything.
- Are the people good?

552
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:31,717
- What did Mr. Prem say?
- He said the people are good.

553
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:34,717
Infact, he himself invests
in his construction company.

554
00:43:35,723 --> 00:43:38,715
Son, I have never done
any advertising.

555
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:42,319
You have to
manage this company now.

556
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,722
If you think it is right,
go ahead.

557
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:48,734
We'll have to decide
on a brand name first.

558
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:51,327
Heed me, Manali is a great name.

559
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,331
Is this a fashion label
or a drug den?

560
00:43:54,408 --> 00:43:55,397
Manali works.

561
00:43:57,345 --> 00:44:04,683
Got it! Va for Vardhan and
Ga for Gaurav, and Raga. Vaga!

562
00:44:07,288 --> 00:44:10,018
GG, that's brilliant.
Vaga by Raga!

563
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:12,282
It almost sounds
like Viagra in French.

564
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:15,685
There is just one promise
of fashion, quality.

565
00:44:16,297 --> 00:44:18,288
When there is Raga,
there is quality.

566
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:20,690
And when there is Vardhan Textiles,
there has to be quality.

567
00:44:21,302 --> 00:44:23,031
I think we should sell
something different, don't you?

568
00:44:23,304 --> 00:44:24,703
I think we should sell sex.

569
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:28,036
Vaga fashions should make you
feel sexy and macho, and...

570
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:29,708
Come on, Raga.

571
00:44:30,311 --> 00:44:32,711
In advertisement,
only one thing is said.

572
00:44:33,314 --> 00:44:34,645
Okay, you're right,
we'll say only one thing.

573
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:38,651
- Let's sell sexy.
- No, not sexy, it's very vulgar.

574
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,051
Sexy means beautiful,
attractive, hip.

575
00:44:41,322 --> 00:44:44,723
Whatever, but I think we
should target middle class people.

576
00:44:45,326 --> 00:44:47,658
The middle class doesn't
care for a brand name...

577
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:51,323
only the first of every month,
my Qutub Minar.

578
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:52,730
Yes...

579
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:58,728
Excuse me Raga,
why did he call me Qutub Minar?

580
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,276
Whoever GG likes, he gives him the
name of a great construction.

581
00:45:04,278 --> 00:45:06,269
- What does he call you?
- Guess.

582
00:45:08,282 --> 00:45:09,271
Eiffel Tower?

583
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:16,017
We have to hype Vaga Fashions.

584
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:20,283
Not just with advertising. Parties,
press conferences, ramp shows...

585
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:22,693
- women, wine and money.
- Why GG?

586
00:45:24,298 --> 00:45:26,289
News gets hot only with that.

587
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:30,031
I'll teach you how
to deal with the media.

588
00:45:30,304 --> 00:45:32,295
Right now, you should
have only two goals.

589
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,307
Work hard, party harder.

590
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:37,038
And these two things are done
to the fullest only in youth.

591
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:39,302
But youth is meant for working.

592
00:45:41,315 --> 00:45:44,307
And the real fun of parties
and discos lies in old age?

593
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,314
When I was 16 years old,
Camps Fire Club, Delhi...

594
00:45:49,723 --> 00:45:52,317
My father gave me a beer in hand,
and said...

595
00:45:52,393 --> 00:45:54,327
'Son, never do anything in
hiding from now on'

596
00:45:54,395 --> 00:45:55,726
- Hi guys!
- Hello.

597
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:01,665
- Hi Jai.
- Hi!

598
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:05,670
- You always wear such clothes?
- Yes, why?

599
00:46:06,273 --> 00:46:07,262
Nothing.

600
00:46:09,276 --> 00:46:11,676
Look, we must quickly start
the entire advertising campaign.

601
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,274
It will be an investment
of atleast 15-20 million.

602
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:17,010
But that's too much.

603
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:20,276
Nothing of Vaga Fashions
will be sold less then Rs.1000.

604
00:46:20,354 --> 00:46:22,686
Whether it is a handkerchief,
or socks. Nothing.

605
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:24,279
I don't want repetition.

606
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:29,295
- But a campaign of 15-20 million?
- People think cheap is passe.

607
00:46:29,363 --> 00:46:32,025
It's my money that is being spent
and you are taking tension.

608
00:46:32,299 --> 00:46:33,288
Exactly.

609
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:37,293
Natasha, which ad film maker
will be good?

610
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:40,307
If you want the whole ad campaign,
take Thakkar.

611
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,301
That's it, guys. Baywatch!

612
00:46:45,713 --> 00:46:47,044
The concept should
be clear to everyone.

613
00:46:47,314 --> 00:46:48,713
We have to shoot Baywatch.

614
00:46:49,316 --> 00:46:51,716
Lots of girls are
dancing on the beach.
061810:46:5:1210:46:54:00
Costing. What will be the cost?

615
00:46:55,322 --> 00:46:58,723
7-8 models, one male model,
we'll take John Abraham.

616
00:46:59,326 --> 00:47:01,260
Shooting, Bali or Thailand,
one of those exciting places.

617
00:47:01,462 --> 00:47:04,590
I think, it should not
cost more than 7-8 million.

618
00:47:04,665 --> 00:47:08,260
Why abroad?
We have beaches even in India.

619
00:47:08,302 --> 00:47:10,964
My friend, good advertising
is done like that.

620
00:47:11,272 --> 00:47:13,638
Or you can take two pictures of a
shirt & stick it in the newspaper.

621
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:14,765
Advertising done.

622
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:19,678
Look brother,
the film has to be sexy.

623
00:47:24,285 --> 00:47:25,684
Won't you give me company?

624
00:47:27,288 --> 00:47:28,687
Not in this.

625
00:47:30,691 --> 00:47:32,682
You give company in measures?

626
00:47:35,296 --> 00:47:36,695
What are you doing in the evening?

627
00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:47,696
Come on!

628
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:03,256
- Stupid!
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

629
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:12,664
Know to dance on your hands?
Learn.

630
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:15,664
Because you won't
have your legs tomorrow.

631
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,670
I'm sorry GG,
I didn't know they were with you.

632
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:21,664
- I'm really sorry.
- Tell them.

633
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:23,675
I'm sorry guys, really sorry.

634
00:48:31,285 --> 00:48:33,685
GG, Jai is not coming to Thailand.

635
00:48:34,288 --> 00:48:36,017
- What happened?
- Nothing.

636
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,281
What will I come and do there?

637
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:41,294
The ad campaign is going to begin,
and you are my partner.

638
00:48:42,363 --> 00:48:45,696
Yes, but I told you, I have to go
on urgent work to Singapore.

639
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,293
I found out. Your lab training
is given in Thailand too.

640
00:48:50,337 --> 00:48:53,602
I'll get the lab equipment
imported. Chill.

641
00:48:53,674 --> 00:48:55,699
Leave your programme to me.

642
00:48:58,312 --> 00:49:01,975
Okay. But 2-3 more
people will come with me.

643
00:49:02,249 --> 00:49:03,978
They are not the uncle-aunty types,
are they?

644
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:05,980
No.

645
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:08,645
- Lift the glass, let's toast.
- Why?

646
00:49:09,256 --> 00:49:11,986
Jai, you've made news.
You are on Page 3.

647
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:14,659
We have to celebrate today!
Come on!

648
00:49:20,267 --> 00:49:22,258
- Take.
- I don't drink.

649
00:49:22,303 --> 00:49:24,271
It's just champagne, not whiskey.

650
00:49:24,305 --> 00:49:26,671
No one refuses champagne.
Come on.

651
00:49:28,275 --> 00:49:29,674
He simply feels shy.

652
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:43,688
- Jaidev! Shubham.
- Bhajanlal. Get in.

653
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:48,284
So this is Patil's
construction work.

654
00:49:48,362 --> 00:49:51,695
Not just this,
there is more behind the hill.

655
00:49:52,299 --> 00:49:54,927
- Where? Behind?
- But everything is stalled for now

656
00:49:55,302 --> 00:49:56,701
By the way,
what are you doing here?

657
00:49:57,304 --> 00:50:02,708
I just needed shoes for the trip.
I bought those too today.

658
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,711
- Like them?
- They are very good.

659
00:50:15,723 --> 00:50:17,714
- What's news on Mumbai?
- Everything is fine.

660
00:50:17,825 --> 00:50:18,814
Business is good.

661
00:50:21,328 --> 00:50:25,731
For that green house, we have put
up 8 tanks of 10000 ltrs each.

662
00:50:34,742 --> 00:50:35,731
Greetings Baba.

663
00:50:37,745 --> 00:50:44,344
Son, remembering your elders
is a good tradition.

664
00:50:45,552 --> 00:50:47,747
With time,
man sometimes goes astray.

665
00:50:49,356 --> 00:50:51,347
At such a time,
the blessings of his elders...

666
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:53,757
and his values save him.

667
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:59,355
Jaidev, wherever your mother
will be...

668
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:02,692
she must be blessing
you every moment.

669
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,710
This is a nice way to draw
someone's attention to yourself.

670
00:51:13,313 --> 00:51:15,304
Keep teasing him,
but don't talk to him.

671
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:17,707
Stay away from him,
but be seen too.

672
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:19,717
What else will you do?

673
00:51:24,324 --> 00:51:28,727
Hey bobpin. You are still
the same, like a bobpin.

674
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:31,729
Slim, trim, you'll never change.

675
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:35,327
Stretch, yet you get
back to the same shape.

676
00:51:35,736 --> 00:51:40,730
Top! Even you have not changed.
You are always spinning.

677
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:43,741
You do your work, let me do mine.

678
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:46,744
Why do you have so much attitude?
What is your problem?

679
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:49,739
- Tell me.
- Go away!

680
00:52:14,308 --> 00:52:15,707
Move aside.

681
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:19,302
So Bhajanlal, as I was saying...

682
00:52:19,379 --> 00:52:21,040
Have you lost it going to Mumbai?

683
00:52:21,315 --> 00:52:24,045
Why do you two always
keep fighting.

684
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:27,310
Atleast patch up before
leaving for the trip abroad.

685
00:52:27,387 --> 00:52:30,049
- According to law, cease fire.
- Correct.

686
00:52:30,324 --> 00:52:32,315
One who is a coward
may call for cease fire.

687
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:33,715
Move!

688
00:52:33,827 --> 00:52:35,317
Know what your problem is?

689
00:52:35,395 --> 00:52:37,056
You are not a girl,
you are quarrelsome.

690
00:52:37,331 --> 00:52:40,732
I have decided
I am not taking her to Thailand.

691
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:43,735
Then don't take me,
and tell Guruji too.

692
00:52:47,341 --> 00:52:49,741
You mean we are not
going to Singapore?

693
00:52:49,943 --> 00:52:51,069
No, Thailand.

694
00:52:51,345 --> 00:52:57,079
I've heard.
England, Poland, Holland...

695
00:52:59,353 --> 00:53:01,685
But when are we leaving.

696
00:53:02,289 --> 00:53:05,690
Assume the flight
is ready to take off.

697
00:53:11,298 --> 00:53:12,287
I don't believe this!

698
00:53:12,366 --> 00:53:14,698
Three other Minars
with your friend, Qutub Minar?

699
00:53:15,302 --> 00:53:16,701
That makes them a foursome.

700
00:53:16,803 --> 00:53:18,703
Looks like they are out
on some rights procession.

701
00:53:19,706 --> 00:53:21,697
Why does Qutub Minar look
so worried.

702
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:23,708
I'll talk to him.

703
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,711
There's one problem.
They haven't got their baggage.

704
00:53:27,714 --> 00:53:30,706
- Even my baggage has not arrived.
- Lucky girl.

705
00:53:30,817 --> 00:53:33,308
Indulge in your favourite
hobby, shopping.

706
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:37,313
The ground staff said we will
get the baggage in 1-2 days.

707
00:53:37,391 --> 00:53:40,656
1-2 days!
What will we do until then?

708
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:44,720
We have only what we are wearing.
We lost everything.

709
00:53:45,332 --> 00:53:47,323
- What?
- Everything.

710
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:51,326
Two pairs of clothes, a bottle
of oil, and under garments.

711
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:54,738
- What?
- Underwear.

712
00:53:55,742 --> 00:53:57,334
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

713
00:54:22,636 --> 00:54:25,696
- Has everyone got their room?
- Yes, they have.

714
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:33,712
- Wow! Lobsters!
- Hey, tiger prawns.

715
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:38,045
Eeks! We won't eat this dirty food.

716
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:41,310
- Don't worry, I'll...
- I cannot even see this. Let's go.

717
00:54:41,722 --> 00:54:44,316
What happened?
Full on just seeing the food?

718
00:54:44,391 --> 00:54:47,724
- No, actually...
- We won't eat this.

719
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:51,320
We cannot even touch it.
It is impure, and unholy.

720
00:54:51,398 --> 00:54:52,387
Unholy?

721
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:57,736
We cannot eat what moves, crawls,
swims, flies.

722
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:01,000
Okay, there are fruits over there,
we'll eat fruits.

723
00:55:01,274 --> 00:55:06,678
Fruits?
We are tired of eating fruits.

724
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,273
Please give us something to eat.
Some lentil and bread.

725
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:13,285
Okay, I'll arrange something.

726
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:15,685
- Some vegetable too...
- Yes, I understood.

727
00:55:21,294 --> 00:55:23,694
Bhajanlal, call your friends.

728
00:55:24,297 --> 00:55:26,288
Kusum, Madhavi, come.

729
00:55:28,301 --> 00:55:30,292
- Yes madam?
- You get good clothes here.

730
00:55:30,704 --> 00:55:32,296
Clothes? They are tatters.

731
00:55:33,306 --> 00:55:35,297
You get clothes here,
buy them.

732
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:38,310
These clothes?
How can we wear such clothes?

733
00:55:39,713 --> 00:55:41,305
Won't we get a saree here?

734
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,316
You won't get a saree, blouse,
dhoti, kurta here.

735
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:48,320
In Rome, do as Romans do.
Wear what the others are wearing.

736
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:51,721
- It's just a matter of 3-4 days.
- We don't wear such clothes.

737
00:55:52,325 --> 00:55:54,657
You will have to wear the
clothes available here.

738
00:55:54,728 --> 00:55:56,320
And anyway, who knows you here.

739
00:55:56,396 --> 00:56:01,265
- But dhoti is the best garment.
- How is that?

740
00:56:01,668 --> 00:56:03,659
I'll explain with an example.

741
00:56:04,271 --> 00:56:08,264
Like you have a window at home
for light and air to enter...

742
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:12,277
likewise, you wear a dhoti for
entry of light and air in the body.

743
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:16,274
Vegetarian food is ready for you.
Come.

744
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:23,679
- But Bhajanlal, such clothes?
- That's their culture, nudity.

745
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:30,686
You must have eaten already.

746
00:56:31,698 --> 00:56:34,690
- Who cares whether I have or not.
- I do.

747
00:56:35,302 --> 00:56:37,702
Even I have not eaten.
What we'll do is...

748
00:56:38,305 --> 00:56:40,705
I'll show them the table and come.

749
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:45,300
Come.

750
00:56:47,314 --> 00:56:51,045
Jaidev, everyone's luggage arrived
How come ours didn't arrive?

751
00:56:51,318 --> 00:56:54,310
- According to law...
- Stop your accordion.

752
00:56:54,387 --> 00:56:59,324
Even Natasha's luggage has not
come. She is helping you.

753
00:56:59,392 --> 00:57:02,589
Jai, everyone is making
fun of us here.

754
00:57:02,662 --> 00:57:03,651
- Who?
- And you too.

755
00:57:04,264 --> 00:57:05,663
Me? Fun...

756
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:08,257
Don't take us to be
weak and helpless.

757
00:57:08,668 --> 00:57:11,660
You have got them, that is why
you are treating us like this.

758
00:57:12,272 --> 00:57:14,263
- Me?
- I understand everything.

759
00:57:14,341 --> 00:57:18,277
They laugh behind our back,
and he is supporting them.

760
00:57:21,281 --> 00:57:23,272
Sister, let's go from here.

761
00:57:24,684 --> 00:57:27,278
When you get food,
it should be respected.

762
00:57:27,687 --> 00:57:30,281
I've never seen such a drama
for food till today.

763
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:33,691
- Forget it.
- What is her name? Madhavi.

764
00:57:34,694 --> 00:57:39,028
Explain to her. Man has always been
eating what he found around him.

765
00:57:39,299 --> 00:57:42,029
Will those living in the dessert
eat vegetables everyday?

766
00:57:42,302 --> 00:57:44,293
Why do we Bengalis
eat fish and rice?

767
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:46,305
Because it is available in Bengal.

768
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:49,706
Some people have the habit
to make an issue of everything.

769
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:54,303
Do one thing.
Please explain this to them.

770
00:57:55,315 --> 00:57:56,714
You will have to explain to them.

771
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:59,718
They will have to wear
whatever clothes I buy them.

01:01:42,342 --> 01:01:45,743
Jai, don't you think
Bhajanlal intends to do modeling?

820
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:49,738
Kusum, it is not a sin
to enjoy life.

821
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,750
- When did Guruji say that?
- Not Guruji, Jaidev.

822
01:01:53,353 --> 01:01:56,345
So your new Guru is Jaidev.

823
01:02:04,697 --> 01:02:06,688
- Liar!
- What happened?

824
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,700
Why did you lie that
you don't get a saree here?

825
01:02:08,802 --> 01:02:10,702
What do I know?
Even I am new here.

826
01:02:11,304 --> 01:02:13,295
That Indian woman said there is
a shop close by.

827
01:02:13,339 --> 01:02:15,034
Atleast we wouldn't have
had to wear such clothes.

828
01:02:15,308 --> 01:02:18,038
Why are you fighting with him?
How is he at fault?

829
01:02:18,311 --> 01:02:20,040
How many clothes can we buy?

830
01:02:20,313 --> 01:02:22,713
And then, are your hands made
of camphor that they'll melt...

831
01:02:22,816 --> 01:02:24,306
the moment they are exposed?

832
01:02:24,384 --> 01:02:26,318
Now relax! Come on!

833
01:02:29,322 --> 01:02:32,314
How much you have changed.
You are smoking, drinking...

834
01:02:32,725 --> 01:02:35,319
gambling, roaming with those girls.

835
01:02:35,395 --> 01:02:36,327
Whatever I do, what
difference does it make to you.

836
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:40,331
You are spoiling Jaidev,
and you expect me to keep quiet?

837
01:02:40,366 --> 01:02:43,335
If I spoil,
won't it make a difference to you?

838
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:46,338
If I smoke and drink,
how will you feel?

839
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:49,731
- Won't you stop me?
- Have you come to reform me?

840
01:02:50,343 --> 01:02:54,074
- I am leaving.
- What if Guruji comes to know?

841
01:02:56,349 --> 01:03:02,288
Threatening me? That you'll
tell Guruji? Take, tell him. Take.

842
01:03:16,302 --> 01:03:17,997
Betting today on cricket?

843
01:03:18,304 --> 01:03:21,296
Ofcourse. Only two matches are
left of India and Pakistan.

844
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:24,700
I won Rs.100000 yesterday
and Qutub Minar lost Rs.50000.

845
01:03:24,911 --> 01:03:25,707
Have to make him win today.

846
01:03:27,313 --> 01:03:31,306
Hey guys, hear the visuals.
John Abraham, babes.

847
01:03:31,384 --> 01:03:33,045
John and Natasha, dancing.

848
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:35,310
John and Ria, sensuous.

849
01:03:35,388 --> 01:03:38,721
Last two seconds,
Vaga Fashions, irresistible!

850
01:03:39,726 --> 01:03:42,320
The rest is just oomph... oomph...

851
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:47,723
We are almost set, ready to roll.
Where is John Abraham?

852
01:03:47,834 --> 01:03:49,062
There's a problem.

853
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:51,735
Production said John has
not come out of the airport.

854
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:57,332
- Damn! You didn't talk to him?
- I did in the evening.

855
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,344
He was even going to
leave for the airport.

856
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:03,681
But I don't know. Have a phone?
I'll call up his manager.

857
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:10,688
Hello Bhasker, Natasha here.
Where is John.

858
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:15,022
What!! Bhasker,
you've got to do something.

859
01:04:15,295 --> 01:04:18,696
- What happened?
- John's suffered food poisoning.

860
01:04:19,299 --> 01:04:22,700
He's in hospital. It will
take him 3-4 days to recover.

861
01:04:23,303 --> 01:04:26,704
We have spent so much money on this
trip. What do we do, Thakkar?

862
01:04:27,307 --> 01:04:29,707
It will take atleast 2-3 days for
any model to come from India.

863
01:04:31,311 --> 01:04:34,712
Raga, have you seen any
Indian looking model here?

864
01:04:35,315 --> 01:04:38,716
We have a diamond in hand,
and we are searching the bazaar.

865
01:04:39,319 --> 01:04:41,310
Will you model, Qutub Minar?

866
01:04:42,322 --> 01:04:46,725
Jai? That's a brilliant idea.
You're good, you must try.

867
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:51,730
Yeah, he's very good.
- Me... no... Me, modeling? No.

868
01:04:52,332 --> 01:04:53,731
- Come on.
- Give it a shot.

869
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:58,734
Finished laughing? Now get serious.
Will you do it?

870
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:02,672
GG... l... l... cannot do modeling.
I mean...

871
01:05:03,276 --> 01:05:06,677
For business, I can do anything.
Then what's in modeling?

872
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,681
Yeah, but... seriously GG,
not me...

873
01:05:11,284 --> 01:05:13,275
- Come on!
- Alright, pack up.

874
01:05:14,287 --> 01:05:15,686
Book tickets to go back.

875
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:20,692
Sorry, we suffered a loss
before starting business.

876
01:05:21,294 --> 01:05:24,286
Anyways, the loss is only mine.

How should I explain about acting?
Acting is like betting.

01:09:01,314 --> 01:09:03,646
Jai, who do you think will win?

914
01:09:06,252 --> 01:09:07,651
Don't know, can't say.

915
01:09:07,753 --> 01:09:08,742
Take a guess.

916
01:09:10,656 --> 01:09:14,251
I think India will win.
Raga, what do you think?

917
01:09:15,261 --> 01:09:17,252
I'll tell you at the right time.

918
01:09:18,264 --> 01:09:19,663
This is the right time.

919
01:09:21,667 --> 01:09:23,658
Irfanbhai, what's the rate?

920
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:26,670
One million.

921
01:09:28,274 --> 01:09:31,266
GG, don't play today,
you lost only yesterday.

922
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,270
What's the fun in life
without winning and losing?

923

Oh God!

924
01:09:40,286 --> 01:09:44,689
- What do you think now?
- Now I think India will win.

925
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:47,691
Okay, I'll stake yours on India.

926
01:09:48,294 --> 01:09:51,695
GG, I won't gamble any more.

Damn! You disgrace

- Cool it, GG,

930
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:07,304
Okay GG, even I'll gamble.

931
01:10:10,316 --> 01:10:14,719
- How much do I stake?
- Ten... thousand?

932
01:10:15,721 --> 01:10:17,712
Ten thousand?
Are you gambling or joking?

933
01:10:20,326 --> 01:10:24,319
- GG again. Another one million.
- GG, not so much.

934
01:10:25,331 --> 01:10:27,322
Come on, you are the owner of
Vardhan Industries.

935
01:10:27,733 --> 01:10:29,325
Play that much stakes atleast.

936
01:10:31,337 --> 01:10:34,329
I have not even seen
a million rupees.

937
01:10:34,407 --> 01:10:36,739
I'll take guarantee.
We'll recover from profits.

938
01:10:37,343 --> 01:10:38,332
Come on, Jai.

939
01:10:41,347 --> 01:10:45,750
- Okay, I'll play.
- That's the spirit!

940
01:10:46,352 --> 01:10:49,344
One million. Jai Vardhan.

941
01:10:52,358 --> 01:10:54,758
He's my partner. I take guarantee.

942
01:10:56,762 --> 01:10:59,754
Yes... yes Irfanbhai.

943
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:18,306
It's so peaceful here, isn't it?

944
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,719
Sometimes, even in solitude,
you find peace.

945
01:11:25,324 --> 01:11:29,727
You are so far away from worldly
troubles, yet you are worried?

946
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:34,322
I look worried to you?

947
01:11:35,735 --> 01:11:38,727
You are either thinking about
someone, or are worried.

948
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:41,738
And if you are not worried,
you are thinking of someone.

949
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:47,744
I am neither worried now,
nor ever will be.

950
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:53,750
Those who do wrong worry.

951
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:56,753
It's something to ponder over.

952
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:03,294
Let's sleep with
that thought tonight.

953
01:12:11,303 --> 01:12:12,702
Golden gate City.

954
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:17,299
The estimated cost of this
project is two lakh million.

955
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:21,703
Their own home in India for NRI's.
The whole area only for NRI's.

956
01:12:23,315 --> 01:12:25,306
2/3 bedroom beautiful bungalows.

957
01:12:26,318 --> 01:12:28,309
A totally planned,
fully self sufficient...

958
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:32,323
technologically advanced city,
with five-star facilities.

959
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:39,061
And the cost of each bungalow
from five million to 25 million.

960
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:42,732
All details are in the brochure.

961
01:12:43,335 --> 01:12:46,031
Mr. GG, on what
stage is your project?

962
01:12:46,338 --> 01:12:49,330
The first phase of construction
has begun...

963
01:12:49,408 --> 01:12:51,740
with the amusement park,
club, and golf course.

964
01:12:53,345 --> 01:12:54,744
At a distance of
three hours from Mumbai...

965
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:59,341
we are giving you a dream city
with all comforts and facilities.

966
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:03,016
Because the name of
this place is Songarh...

967
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:06,283
we have named this city,
Golden Gate City.

968
01:13:09,295 --> 01:13:12,696
Now if there are no more questions,
that's it. Thank you, gentlemen.

969
01:13:23,309 --> 01:13:27,302
What are you saying?
You are Guruji's son?

970
01:13:27,379 --> 01:13:28,368
Yes.

971
01:13:29,315 --> 01:13:31,715
The Guruji of
Rishi-Van is your father?

972
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:35,719
- And Vardhan Industries?
- I'll explain.

973
01:13:36,722 --> 01:13:39,316
My father's name is
Srinath Vardhan.

974
01:13:39,725 --> 01:13:41,659
He started Vardhan Industries.

975
01:13:41,727 --> 01:13:44,719
Then, a few years ago,
he went to Rishi-Van Ashram...

976
01:13:45,331 --> 01:13:48,323
and Homi Wadia, who is his partner,
he handles his business.

977
01:13:55,341 --> 01:13:57,741
I wanted to make you my partner
even in this project.

978
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:06,276
So how could I have asked?
I would not ruin you along with me.

979
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:12,280
But God is strange.

980
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:14,690
Look at the coincidence,
he brought us together.

981
01:14:20,299 --> 01:14:22,028
Now this entire project
is in your hands.

982
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:26,601
If you wish, you can save
this project and me.

983
01:14:26,705 --> 01:14:30,300
Tell Guruji to cancel the stay
and become my partner.

984
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:33,701
We both will benefit from this.
Only benefit.

985
01:14:37,316 --> 01:14:38,715
Say something.

986
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,049
It's not the question
of benefit, GG,

987
01:14:43,322 --> 01:14:46,723
If I can help you, I will love it.

988
01:14:48,727 --> 01:14:50,718
- But I have a condition.
- What?

989
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:55,723
While leaving the Ashram,
I had made a promise to Baba...

990
01:14:56,335 --> 01:14:58,735
that I will plant millions
of trees there.

991
01:15:04,276 --> 01:15:05,675
I will surely help you.

992
01:15:09,682 --> 01:15:13,277
Every tree I cut,
I will plant two in it's place.

993
01:15:13,686 --> 01:15:14,675
That's my promise.

994
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:22,283
Thanks.
- What are friends for?

995
01:15:50,656 --> 01:15:55,650
Surprising! I never thought
I will see such a miracle in life.

996
01:15:56,262 --> 01:15:58,253
One plant will give us 100 plants?

997
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:02,590
Was everything okay in
the foreign land?

998
01:16:04,169 --> 01:16:05,158
Yes.

999
01:16:06,171 --> 01:16:10,198
Then where is the effervescence now
that existed while leaving?

1000
01:16:10,276 --> 01:16:12,210
Purohitji, I have a dilemma.

1001
01:16:13,212 --> 01:16:16,204
Tell me,
is it a sin to enjoy life?

1002
01:16:17,216 --> 01:16:19,207
Enjoy? What enjoyment?

1003
01:16:19,418 --> 01:16:22,216
If your enjoyment is hurting
someone else...

1004
01:16:22,288 --> 01:16:25,223
then where is the joy in it?

1005
01:16:26,225 --> 01:16:29,626
- Now what is the dilemma?
- No, now there is no dilemma.

1006
01:16:33,232 --> 01:16:34,221
Did you hear,
the dilemma has been solved.

1007
01:16:40,205 --> 01:16:43,641
Bhajan, even I have a dilemma.

1008
01:16:44,243 --> 01:16:46,643
Who has Jaidev brought
to meet Guruji?

1009
01:16:47,246 --> 01:16:48,975
That's not a dilemma,
he's big trouble.

1010
01:16:49,248 --> 01:16:50,977
He is Jaidev's new partner.

1011
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:54,242
And we came to know abroad
that he is that Patil's builder...

1012
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,651
against whom Guruji
has taken a stay order.

1013
01:16:56,255 --> 01:16:57,244
Okay.

1014
01:16:57,323 --> 01:17:01,589
I have heard you out.
But the matter has become serious.

1015
01:17:02,194 --> 01:17:05,925
Even I want this region to progress
and people to get employment.

1016
01:17:06,198 --> 01:17:08,894
That there is
progress and development.

1017
01:17:09,201 --> 01:17:11,169
But the thousands of tribals
who have left from here...

1018
01:17:11,236 --> 01:17:13,170
it's a question of the lives
of those tribals...

1019
01:17:13,238 --> 01:17:17,197
is connected with this project.
What is their future?

1020
01:17:17,276 --> 01:17:19,938
Baba, GG wants to open
an IT centre here.

1021
01:17:20,212 --> 01:17:22,203
He has promised that all the
tribals who have left...

1022
01:17:22,281 --> 01:17:24,943
will be brought back,
and even employment given to them.

1023
01:17:25,217 --> 01:17:27,617
You only have to
cancel the stay order.

1024
01:17:29,221 --> 01:17:33,555
Son, I understand his problem.
But...

1025
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:39,621
Guruji, I am telling you
all this because you understand.

1026
01:17:40,632 --> 01:17:43,624
I want to make such a city here,
which we don't have in this country

1027
01:17:44,203 --> 01:17:45,932
Where there is not a single hut,
no beggar.

1028
01:17:46,205 --> 01:17:49,231
Where there is no filth anywhere,
no spitting.

1029
01:17:50,242 --> 01:17:53,234
Is there any such city
in this country?

1030
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:57,640
How much I tried to tell you this.

1031
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:01,585
It is my good fortune
that I met Jai.

1032
01:18:02,187 --> 01:18:07,181
You just let me do my work,
and I will do everything you say.

1033
01:18:11,196 --> 01:18:17,567
I have understood your plans.
Just give me time to think.

1034
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:22,939
Let's see what we do then.
Son, drop your friend.

1035
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:26,200
Yes Baba... come GG,

1036
01:18:39,224 --> 01:18:44,218
Sage, my testing time has arrived.

1037
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:50,224
The monster has come as a saint and
my son is unable to recognise him.

1038
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:52,593
He is supporting injustice.

1039
01:18:56,241 --> 01:18:59,642
O God, give me strength.

1040
01:19:02,181 --> 01:19:05,173
Give me strength.

1041
01:19:05,584 --> 01:19:11,580
"Fickle... fickle... fickle"

1042
01:19:34,613 --> 01:19:38,606
"Take it or leave it, this heart"

1043
01:19:39,218 --> 01:19:43,951
"Take it or leave it, this heart"

1044
01:19:44,423 --> 01:19:46,220
"Why lose your heart to someone?"

1045
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:48,616
"Why win someone's heart?"

1046
01:19:49,228 --> 01:19:51,219
"Why unite your
heart with someone?"

1047
01:19:51,263 --> 01:19:53,629
"Why break someone's heart?"

1048
01:19:54,233 --> 01:19:58,192
"Don't fall in love"

1049
01:19:58,604 --> 01:20:03,564
"I'm sorry, O fickle heart"

1050
01:20:03,642 --> 01:20:07,635
"I'm sorry, O fickle heart"

1051
01:20:08,247 --> 01:20:10,238
"Why lose your heart to someone?"

1052
01:20:10,649 --> 01:20:12,640
"Why win someone's heart?"

1053
01:20:13,252 --> 01:20:15,243
"Why unite your
heart with someone?"

1054
01:20:15,654 --> 01:20:17,645
"Why break someone's heart?"

1055
01:20:18,257 --> 01:20:22,250
"Don't fall in love"

1056
01:20:22,661 --> 01:20:27,257
"I'm sorry, O fickle heart"

1057
01:20:27,299 --> 01:20:31,633
"I'm sorry, O fickle heart"

1058
01:20:32,237 --> 01:20:36,674
"Take it or leave it, this heart"

1059
01:20:37,276 --> 01:20:41,679
"Take it or leave it, this heart"

1060
01:20:55,694 --> 01:20:56,044
"Beating heart, excited heart,
tormented heart, yearning heart"

1061
01:20:56,044 --> 01:20:56,287
"Why unite your
heart with someone?"

1062
01:20:56,698 --> 01:20:58,689
"Why break someone's heart?"

1063
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:03,294
"Don't fall in love"

1064
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:08,300
"I'm sorry, O fickle heart"

1065
01:21:08,342 --> 01:21:12,676
"I'm sorry, O fickle heart"

1066
01:21:13,281 --> 01:21:17,717

1067
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:22,723
"Take it or leave it, this heart"

1068

"Beating heart, excited heart,

1069
01:21:34,184 --> 01:21:38,168
"Beating heart, excited heart,
tormented heart, yearning heart"

1070
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:43,741

"Take it or leave it, this heart"

1072

1073
01:21:52,786 --> 01:21:57,382
"Pumping heart, convinced heart,
slipping heart, careful heart"

1074
01:21:57,591 --> 01:21:59,786
"Why is the heart..."

1075
01:22:00,794 --> 01:22:05,788
"Why is the heart such an impostor?"

1076
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:10,393
"I'm sorry, O fickle heart"

1077
01:22:10,804 --> 01:22:14,797

"The heart must be having a heart"

1079
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,412
"Which heart thought of the heart?"

1080
01:22:28,822 --> 01:22:33,815
"This heart, within,
has suppressed sorrow"

1081
01:22:34,828 --> 01:22:38,422
"Take it or leave it, this heart"

1082

"The heart must be having a heart"

1083
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,100
"Which heart thought of the heart?"

1084
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:48,069
"This heart, within,
has suppressed sorrow"

1085
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:50,741
"No one torments so much"

1086
01:22:51,745 --> 01:22:53,372
"No one torments so much"

1087
01:22:53,781 --> 01:22:55,772
"As much as the fickle heart"n

1088
01:22:56,382 --> 01:23:00,786
"O fickle heart"

1089
01:23:01,388 --> 01:23:10,387
"O fickle heart"t

1090
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,800
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1091
01:23:16,403 --> 01:23:19,395
- Tell me, how do I look?
- Lovely.

1092
01:23:19,806 --> 01:23:22,775
- Only lovely?
- Very lovely.

1093
01:23:23,377 --> 01:23:26,813
- Only very lovely?
- Okay, very very lovely!

1094
01:23:31,418 --> 01:23:33,818
- What did your Baba say?
- He hasn't given a reply yet.

1095
01:23:36,422 --> 01:23:38,152
That means it will take time.

1096
01:23:38,425 --> 01:23:40,359
It took two kings to make
Qutub Mlnar.

1097
01:23:40,427 --> 01:23:43,362
It won't take that long, will it?
Cheers!

1098
01:23:45,364 --> 01:23:48,766
Homi, one who is greedy is tricked.

1099
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:52,068
Before getting into
a partnership with GG...

1100
01:23:52,372 --> 01:23:54,067
didn't you find out
about him first?

1101
01:23:54,373 --> 01:23:58,071
Our old dealer, Premji,
he introduced Jaidev to GG,

1102
01:23:58,345 --> 01:24:02,782
He is GG's investor.
And he was offering a good deal.

1103
01:24:03,382 --> 01:24:04,782
Deal.t

1104
01:24:05,385 --> 01:24:09,116
In the greed for a deal,
you got trapped into the net...

1105
01:24:09,389 --> 01:24:11,788
of the conspirator.

1106
01:24:12,391 --> 01:24:16,385
Homi, this deal, partnership,
and friendship is all an act of GG,

1107
01:24:16,462 --> 01:24:19,398
He did all this to reach me.

1108
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:24,803
And this was his game to
get the stay order canceled.

1109
01:24:25,405 --> 01:24:28,101
But he has invested millions
in GG Fashions.

1110
01:24:28,408 --> 01:24:30,774
And his billions are stuck here.

1111
01:24:31,778 --> 01:24:36,408
We must do something
about this GG,

1112
01:24:36,817 --> 01:24:41,345
- What will you do about Jaidev?
- I don't know what to do about him.

1113
01:24:43,357 --> 01:24:49,091
But I have faith Homi, whatever
my son does, he will do right.

1114
01:24:50,364 --> 01:24:51,763
So this is your Rishi-Van Ashram.

1115
01:24:52,366 --> 01:24:55,358
I never thought there will be
such a beautiful place...

1116
01:24:55,402 --> 01:24:58,769
so close to Mumbai city. But
why are you not taking me there?

1117
01:24:59,373 --> 01:25:02,342
You? Like this?y

1118
01:25:03,342 --> 01:25:05,072
Has anyone told you
that you are mad?

1119
01:25:09,783 --> 01:25:13,378
Yes, mad.
GG always calls me mad.

1120
01:25:13,787 --> 01:25:16,381
But he himself is mad, about me.

1121
01:25:18,391 --> 01:25:21,384
- Like this?
- It's nice.e

1122
01:25:21,795 --> 01:25:25,390
It's GG's birthday gift.
Now tell me, who is mad?

1123
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,390
You.

1124
01:25:29,403 --> 01:25:33,396
That I am.
But can you tell me about who?

1125
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:38,367
Know what a girl's
biggest problem is?

1126
01:25:38,745 --> 01:25:39,734
What?

1127
01:25:40,346 --> 01:25:43,748
To know who will be mad
for her for life.

1128
01:25:44,351 --> 01:25:48,754
Who will never cheat her.
And that is very difficult to know.

1129
01:25:51,358 --> 01:25:54,350
But I know that you
will never cheat anyone.

1130
01:25:55,762 --> 01:25:57,753
You will always help everyone.

1131
01:25:58,765 --> 01:26:04,761
Jai, GG is in trouble. He owes
lots of money in the market.

1132
01:26:05,372 --> 01:26:06,771
He is very sad.

1133
01:26:10,344 --> 01:26:14,371
I know. I will
try my best to help him.

1134
01:26:15,382 --> 01:26:21,787
- Really? You will help GG?
- GG means more to me than a friend.

1135
01:26:22,989 --> 01:26:27,393
He has shown me the world.
I will surely help him.

1136
01:26:28,395 --> 01:26:30,795
Jai, you are so nice.

1137
01:26:37,404 --> 01:26:40,339
If he treats me more than a friend,
why doesn't his father...

1138
01:26:40,373 --> 01:26:41,363
cancel the stay order?

1139
01:26:41,742 --> 01:26:43,300
You must not have tried hard, or...

1140
01:26:43,377 --> 01:26:47,746
What do I try?
What do you want me to do?

1141
01:26:51,752 --> 01:26:53,743
I have taken 1000 million
from the market.

1142
01:26:54,354 --> 01:26:56,345
If this job doesn't get done,
you'll lose everything...

1143
01:26:56,757 --> 01:26:58,748
the necklace,
the lipstick, the earring.

1144
01:27:00,092 --> 01:27:01,754
We will be on the streets.

1145
01:27:06,766 --> 01:27:11,761
If you have dreams, hopes,
then even I have them.

1146
01:27:14,373 --> 01:27:16,739
I am waiting to marry you
since two years.

1147
01:27:17,344 --> 01:27:23,772
Every girl dreams to get married
and settle down. That she has kids.

1148
01:27:24,384 --> 01:27:27,784
How long will I wait? How long?

1149
01:27:27,888 --> 01:27:30,789
Hear the last time! I've
begun to hate the word marriage.

1150
01:27:36,396 --> 01:27:39,331
If you cannot do this job for me,
don't. Keep crying.

1151
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:42,324
I'll assume
I am alone in this fight.

1152
01:27:47,741 --> 01:27:50,301
Excellent.
The saplings have grown big.

1153
01:27:50,711 --> 01:27:52,303
You have done a good job.

1154
01:27:52,746 --> 01:27:57,739
Jaidev, plants are ready to be
planted in green house six.

1155
01:27:58,351 --> 01:27:59,340
Very good.t

1156
01:27:59,419 --> 01:28:03,753
My life has found a goal,
a direction...

1157
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,759
- Where is Baba?
- In the factory.

1158
01:28:12,364 --> 01:28:17,769
Kusum, don't you think this job
gives immense mental satisfaction.

1159
01:28:17,871 --> 01:28:19,361
Yes... yes.

1160
01:28:23,744 --> 01:28:24,733
Hey bobpin!

1161
01:28:32,385 --> 01:28:34,784
Listen! Where are you going?

1162
01:28:35,388 --> 01:28:37,117
You have become the same again
on coming back.

1163
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:39,324
The same clothes,
the same fear.

1164
01:28:41,328 --> 01:28:43,728
Wait! Why do you
always run so much?

1165
01:28:45,732 --> 01:28:47,063
What happened?

1166
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:49,734
Jaidev, you must
tell Guruji everything.

1167
01:28:50,337 --> 01:28:52,032
What?t

1168
01:28:52,339 --> 01:28:55,706
- About whatever happened.
- But what happened?

1169
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:59,337
- All that happened in Thailand.
- Meaning?

1170
01:28:59,412 --> 01:29:01,744
Guruji is very worried.

1171
01:29:02,748 --> 01:29:04,739
I fear even to pass close to him.

1172
01:29:06,353 --> 01:29:08,753
Then fear, and live like that only.

1173
01:29:09,355 --> 01:29:10,755
And anyway, what sin have I
committed for which...

1174
01:29:10,857 --> 01:29:14,759
I should fear to go before Baba?
I only smoked and drank.

1175
01:29:16,363 --> 01:29:18,763
And what Baba is doing with GG,
is that right?

1176
01:29:19,366 --> 01:29:21,357
Do you know,
his whole life can be ruined.

1177
01:29:22,369 --> 01:29:24,769
- I will speak to Baba today.
- No Jai.

1178
01:29:26,373 --> 01:29:28,364
Jaidev, you won't tell
all this to Guruji.

1179
01:29:28,408 --> 01:29:29,739
Madhavi, why are
you always so afraid?

1180
01:29:29,943 --> 01:29:32,070
Guruji has not taught
us to live like that.

1181
01:29:32,345 --> 01:29:35,371
Since I have met GG,
I feel everyone here...

1182
01:29:35,448 --> 01:29:37,109
has locked himself in a cage.

1183
01:29:37,384 --> 01:29:38,373
Come here.y

1184
01:29:38,717 --> 01:29:43,712
Look at me. Don't you feel
I have caged myself?

1185
01:29:44,724 --> 01:29:46,055
Even you have become
just like that.

1186
01:29:46,326 --> 01:29:48,726
You always keep yourself caged.r

1187
01:29:49,729 --> 01:29:52,721
And when you leave the Ashram,
you take the cage along.

1188
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,734
I don't understand why
you are always so scared.

1189
01:29:59,339 --> 01:30:02,706
You will understand.
I hope you will understand one day.

1190
01:30:04,711 --> 01:30:07,339
It is so easy
for you to say all this.

1191
01:30:07,414 --> 01:30:10,076
You say anything, do anything.

1192
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:11,748
You are not an orphan.

1193
01:30:13,753 --> 01:30:16,346
And don't even know
what it is to be an orphan.

1194
01:30:38,345 --> 01:30:40,779
Enough Bhajanlal,
don't put more juice in this.

1195
01:30:41,781 --> 01:30:44,375
These medicines are unique.

1196
01:30:44,451 --> 01:30:48,387
Add one ingredient,
and their character changes.

1197
01:30:48,788 --> 01:30:53,782
If added in a little more measure,
the same medicine becomes poison.

1198
01:30:54,394 --> 01:30:58,797
But it's different with humans.
They can take care of themselves.

1199
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:02,129
- Son, how is your work going?
- Very well.

1200
01:31:02,402 --> 01:31:05,394
Baba, I wanted to talk to you
about GG,

1201
01:31:05,505 --> 01:31:09,100
Bhajanlal, keep it on slow flame,
it will take time to get ready.

1202
01:31:10,377 --> 01:31:11,366
Tell me.y

1203
01:31:11,444 --> 01:31:15,403
Did you give a
thought to GG's land?

1204
01:31:16,416 --> 01:31:18,748
Do you know why I
have stalled his work?

1205
01:31:18,818 --> 01:31:22,150
No, but I do know his
project will develop this region.

1206
01:31:22,422 --> 01:31:24,413
Our region will change.

1207
01:31:24,491 --> 01:31:29,428
Yes, like Mahableshwar
(hill station) has changed.

1208
01:31:29,828 --> 01:31:31,421
Where it rains less than half
it used to before.

1209
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:35,832
Like Shimla has changed,
where it has stopped snowing.

1210
01:31:36,836 --> 01:31:39,771
Look son,
I am not against progress.

1211
01:31:40,373 --> 01:31:43,342
If he wants to make a city, he
has the whole Shahyadri mountains.

1212
01:31:43,409 --> 01:31:44,741
Let him go and make his city.

1213
01:31:44,844 --> 01:31:46,105
Why is he insisting on
making it here?

1214
01:31:46,379 --> 01:31:50,782
Because without doing anything, he
is getting water and a green area.

1215
01:31:51,784 --> 01:31:55,778
For his selfish motive,
he wants to ruin my world.

1216
01:31:56,389 --> 01:31:58,721
Baba, you misunderstand GG,
He is not like that.

1217
01:31:58,792 --> 01:32:00,384
Nothing will happen to Rishi- Van.
He has promised me.

1218
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:04,123
Promise? You trust a
builder's promise so much?

1219
01:32:04,397 --> 01:32:07,730
He is bent on destroying my world
and you are defending him?

1220
01:32:07,801 --> 01:32:09,132
I am not defending him.T

1221
01:32:09,402 --> 01:32:11,393
Baba, listen to me. He is my
friend, he has invested money.

1222
01:32:11,438 --> 01:32:12,803
He will be ruined.

1223
01:32:12,906 --> 01:32:15,373
The tribals have been
ruined because of him.

1224
01:32:15,442 --> 01:32:18,809
He grabbed their land and threw
them in dirty huts of Mumbai.

1225
01:32:18,912 --> 01:32:20,402
Go to Tilak Nagar and see.

1226
01:32:20,513 --> 01:32:22,413
They are the same people
who grew up with you.

1227
01:32:26,419 --> 01:32:28,819
The decision the tribals took, they
themselves are responsible for it.

1228
01:32:29,823 --> 01:32:31,415
The tribals are responsible?

1229
01:32:31,824 --> 01:32:33,417
You and me standing alive
here...

1230
01:32:33,493 --> 01:32:35,427
the tribals are responsible
even for that.

1231
01:32:35,828 --> 01:32:39,765
You don't know anything.
You were four years old...

1232
01:32:41,368 --> 01:32:42,357
when after a holiday...

1233
01:32:42,402 --> 01:32:45,371
we were returning from
Mahableshwar to Mumbai.

1234
01:32:46,373 --> 01:32:51,743
We were very happy.
You were your mother's pet.

1235
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:56,781
We didn't know there has
been a landslide ahead.

1236
01:32:58,385 --> 01:33:02,378
The driver could not control the
car, and it fell into the valley.

1237
01:33:47,367 --> 01:33:49,358
The driver had died on the spot.

1238
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:54,069
When I opened my eyes,
a sage, who looked like God...

1239
01:33:54,373 --> 01:33:55,739
stood before me.

1240
01:33:57,744 --> 01:34:00,770
He tried his best
to save your mother.

1241
01:34:03,382 --> 01:34:05,373
But she did not survive.n

1242
01:34:06,386 --> 01:34:11,790
Our world changed in minutes.
I lost everything.

1243
01:34:16,062 --> 01:34:19,395
The cremation fire destroyed
everything in minutes.

1244
01:34:19,799 --> 01:34:21,790
All my wealth was of no use.s

1245
01:34:23,403 --> 01:34:27,806
You are my real wealth,
and I have to live for you.

1246
01:34:32,378 --> 01:34:34,812
That sage worked hard
and gave you a new life.

1247
01:34:39,351 --> 01:34:41,752
Living in the Ashram,
I saw a new life.

1248
01:34:43,355 --> 01:34:46,757
There had been a drought,
and the sage was serving everyone.

1249
01:34:48,361 --> 01:34:51,353
People were craving for
every drop of water.

1250
01:34:52,364 --> 01:34:55,766
The heat of the sun had
fissured the earth.

1251
01:34:58,371 --> 01:35:00,771
Men and animals were dying.

1252
01:35:03,342 --> 01:35:06,779
I felt God sent me here
to see all this.

1253
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:13,377
The people who had saved me,
I could not leave them to die.

1254
01:35:13,786 --> 01:35:17,779
I had to eliminate
hunger and drought.

1255
01:35:19,391 --> 01:35:24,386
Then I reached the decision
that to fight drought and hunger...

1256
01:35:28,801 --> 01:35:30,792
I started planting trees.

1257
01:35:31,404 --> 01:35:35,363
Where it didn't rain for years,
it started raining every year.

1258
01:35:36,376 --> 01:35:39,072
And then, there was
never a drought here.

1259
01:35:39,345 --> 01:35:42,337
And now, you want to change
our victory to defeat?

1260
01:35:42,748 --> 01:35:45,342
You want to call Rishi-Van
GG City?

1261
01:36:07,373 --> 01:36:08,362
What are you doing?

1262
01:36:12,345 --> 01:36:15,781
Do you know, a small spark
can destroy the whole Ashram?

1263
01:36:16,783 --> 01:36:18,774
Why has God given you brains?

1264
01:36:30,396 --> 01:36:35,800
Guruji save us. I made a
mistake in leaving the city.

1265
01:36:38,404 --> 01:36:40,736
I lost my wife.

1266
01:36:41,741 --> 01:36:45,734
Now it is very difficult
to leave them and find work.

1267
01:36:48,348 --> 01:36:50,748
I don't know what to do.r

1268
01:36:54,354 --> 01:36:57,346
Keep these two in your Ashram.

1269
01:36:58,757 --> 01:37:03,752
I had told you many times that
you need money to live in a city.

1270
01:37:04,764 --> 01:37:06,755
How long will you survive on the
money you got...

1271
01:37:06,866 --> 01:37:08,355
from the sale of land?v

1272
01:37:09,369 --> 01:37:11,769
You have left this
heavenly place...

1273
01:37:12,372 --> 01:37:15,341
and are living in dirty huts
of Mumbai is that life?

1274
01:37:17,342 --> 01:37:20,779
What is the point in crying now?
You lost everything.

1275
01:37:22,382 --> 01:37:24,373
Bhajanlal, take the kids.

1276
01:37:29,389 --> 01:37:31,380
You mean to say the tribals
lived in palaces in Songarh?

1277
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:33,382
They live in huts now
because of me?

1278
01:37:33,458 --> 01:37:35,791
- I am not saying that.
- Forget it.

1279
01:37:38,398 --> 01:37:41,060
It is so many days, and instead
of talking about my case...

1280
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:42,733
you are talking about tribals.c

1281
01:37:42,935 --> 01:37:45,335
What are they?
Just a burden on our country.

1282
01:37:45,371 --> 01:37:46,736
They only know to sire kids.

1283
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:49,706
We earn money, we pay taxes,
and they...

1284
01:37:53,346 --> 01:37:56,076
Look, if you don't
want to do my work...

1285
01:37:56,349 --> 01:37:58,340
I'm trying my best, GG,

1286
01:37:58,751 --> 01:38:02,744
And... I won't do modeling
in this fashion show.

1287
01:38:03,756 --> 01:38:08,351
If you don't mind,
shall I speak to your father?

1288
01:38:09,362 --> 01:38:12,092
But, what will you
speak with Baba?

1289
01:38:12,364 --> 01:38:17,359
Leave that to me.
Are you with me?

1290
01:38:22,342 --> 01:38:24,674
Guys, this is not working.
Come on, it's a fashion show.

1291
01:38:24,744 --> 01:38:25,768
What're you looking at?a

1292
01:38:25,878 --> 01:38:29,370
I want you to do it with elegance,
finesse. Do it again please.

1293
01:38:29,449 --> 01:38:32,384
Try it together.
Roll the music.

1294
01:38:42,328 --> 01:38:44,319
- Who is Jaidev Vardhan?
- Me. Yes?

1295
01:38:44,397 --> 01:38:45,728
When are you giving money?

1296
01:38:45,832 --> 01:38:48,062
- What happened?
- We are Irfanbhai's men.

1297
01:38:48,334 --> 01:38:50,734
- We have come to take money.
- Money...

1298
01:38:51,337 --> 01:38:56,297
Wait. You have to pay one million.

1299
01:38:59,746 --> 01:39:06,743
Irfanbhai... your men... you
got my money, you'll get his too.

1300
01:39:06,853 --> 01:39:08,343
I have taken guarantee..

1301
01:39:09,355 --> 01:39:12,756
Yes, 45 million is big money,
but you will get it.

1302
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:17,355
- Yes... you'll talk to him?
- Yes.

1303
01:39:21,768 --> 01:39:24,362
I've spoken to him.
You go, you'll get the money.

1304
01:39:28,373 --> 01:39:30,342
GG, 45 million?

1305
01:39:30,409 --> 01:39:32,708
One million dollars
is 45 million rupees.

1306
01:39:32,779 --> 01:39:35,771
But we didn't play in dollars.

1307
01:39:36,382 --> 01:39:38,373
Tell him whether we played
in dollars or not.

1308
01:39:42,721 --> 01:39:46,715
We will have to pay him.
You pay, or I, it's the same thing.

1309
01:39:47,326 --> 01:39:50,726
But right now,
all my money is stuck in GG City.

1310
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:52,729
You'll have to do something.

1311
01:39:57,737 --> 01:40:00,034
Okay, that's it.
Now turn around, hold it.

1312
01:40:00,339 --> 01:40:01,328
Very good.

1313
01:40:09,348 --> 01:40:11,339
What are you doing? Get down.

1314
01:40:15,354 --> 01:40:17,345
When did you play in dollars?

1315
01:40:20,359 --> 01:40:23,760
What dollars, I'll play every game.

1316
01:40:24,363 --> 01:40:27,764
GG, you are doing wrong to Jaidev.

1317
01:40:32,772 --> 01:40:34,763
And he is doing right with me?

1318
01:40:38,344 --> 01:40:41,370
- You all are alike.
- What are you doing!

1319
01:40:42,381 --> 01:40:45,373
- What is wrong with you?
- Go away from here.

1320
01:40:45,451 --> 01:40:47,385
Before I say something, go.

1321
01:40:47,453 --> 01:40:50,388
Are you mad? Get down!
What are you doing!

1322
01:40:50,456 --> 01:40:52,117
And what are you doing with me?

1323
01:40:52,792 --> 01:40:53,781
Shut-up!

1324
01:40:55,394 --> 01:40:57,794
I am trapped,
and you are supporting him.

1325
01:41:04,804 --> 01:41:06,795
You all are alike.

1326
01:41:07,406 --> 01:41:09,373
You find one rich man,
and you go with him.

1327
01:41:09,774 --> 01:41:14,405
- Go! I don't need you.
- First get down.

1328
01:41:15,414 --> 01:41:17,405
If I get down,
everyone will go down.

1329
01:41:17,483 --> 01:41:20,816
You, that Guru, your
industrialist friend, all of them.

1330
01:41:25,424 --> 01:41:28,825
Go inside and cry,
don't do your act here. Go!

1331
01:41:35,434 --> 01:41:38,426
How do I convince you that I
won't let you build a city here?

1332
01:41:39,372 --> 01:41:42,739
You understand,
I will make huge profits.

1333
01:41:44,343 --> 01:41:46,105
And even you can.

1334
01:41:46,379 --> 01:41:50,782
If I only wanted to make money, why
would I start an orphanage here?

1335
01:41:51,384 --> 01:41:53,375
I would start an expensive
boarding school here...

1336
01:41:53,452 --> 01:41:55,783
and educate children of rich men.

1337
01:41:56,389 --> 01:41:59,381
In Mumbai, there are many cigarette
sellers and barbers...

1338
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:01,790
who earn more money than
renowned doctors.

1339
01:42:02,395 --> 01:42:03,384
It's not the question of money.

1340
01:42:04,397 --> 01:42:08,800
It is how you earn money,
and how society benefits from it.

1341
01:42:10,403 --> 01:42:15,705
You have very good ideals, which
are nice to hear over here...

1342
01:42:15,774 --> 01:42:16,764
away from the real world.

1343
01:42:18,377 --> 01:42:21,403
But perhaps you are not
away that I am a builder...

1344
01:42:22,415 --> 01:42:24,406
and know how to get my work done.

1345
01:42:25,818 --> 01:42:28,810
I know... I know very well.

1346
01:42:29,822 --> 01:42:31,414
That is why you builders
get the maximum number...

1347
01:42:31,524 --> 01:42:34,425
of threatening call for extortion
from goons.

1348
01:42:35,428 --> 01:42:39,762
Have you given a thought why?
How much is a builder worth?

1349
01:42:40,366 --> 01:42:42,766
People are ready to kill
someone for Rs.10000.

1350
01:42:43,369 --> 01:42:45,769
And if I had let those orphans
in the street...

1351
01:42:46,772 --> 01:42:48,739
even Rs.10000 is too much.

1352
01:42:49,342 --> 01:42:52,778
One builder's life would
be worth Rs.500.

1353
01:42:53,379 --> 01:43:01,377
What do I tell you? My millions
are invested. I will make the city.

1354
01:43:02,388 --> 01:43:07,382
Your son is ready to join me.
You have lived your life.

1355
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:10,792
Just bless that my job is done
when you are alive.

1356
01:43:10,896 --> 01:43:12,796
My son will never support you.

1357
01:43:17,403 --> 01:43:20,804
Your son has supported me
at every step. Want to see?

1358
01:43:26,412 --> 01:43:31,816
He is a gambler. He has to
pay 45 million in the market.

1359
01:43:32,417 --> 01:43:34,818
Look... look... look!

1360
01:43:42,361 --> 01:43:44,351
Hey look!

1361
01:43:50,369 --> 01:43:52,360
Jaidev is smoking.

1362
01:44:09,388 --> 01:44:13,381
Dwellers of the Ashram,
when you get this letter...

1363
01:44:14,393 --> 01:44:16,384
I will have left the Ashram.

1364
01:44:16,796 --> 01:44:19,390
I regret that the Ashram which we
all build together...

1365
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:22,390
that Ashram is in trouble today.

1366
01:44:22,435 --> 01:44:27,395
Jaidev is supporting those
who want to destroy the Ashram.

1367
01:44:28,407 --> 01:44:30,773
If this is the
state when I am alive...

1368
01:44:31,777 --> 01:44:33,801
what will become of this Ashram
after I die?

1369
01:44:34,413 --> 01:44:37,814
I cannot live a suffocating
life with this dilemma.

1370
01:44:38,751 --> 01:44:40,742
If this Ashram
has to get destroyed...

1371
01:44:41,754 --> 01:44:45,747
it is better this is done
before I die...

1372
01:44:46,358 --> 01:44:48,349
so that I die in peace.

1373
01:44:49,361 --> 01:44:54,765
I request you not to tell
my son about this letter.

1374
01:44:55,367 --> 01:44:57,358
Nor try to find me.i

1375
01:44:58,370 --> 01:45:02,328
If I have ever unknowingly made
any mistake, forgive me.

1376
01:45:04,343 --> 01:45:07,369
Your well wisher... Good wishes.

1377
01:46:05,371 --> 01:46:06,770
What are you thinking, Mr. Patil?.

1378
01:46:06,872 --> 01:46:12,333
Wish some of my MLA's were like
that, I would stay in the Assembly.

1379
01:46:13,379 --> 01:46:14,778
Why would I come here?

1380
01:46:20,386 --> 01:46:21,375
Come Qutub Minar.a

1381
01:46:22,788 --> 01:46:25,780
Mr. Patil, he's Jai Vardhan.
Minister Amrit Patil.

1382
01:46:27,393 --> 01:46:29,384
- How is Guruji?
- He's fine.

1383
01:46:30,796 --> 01:46:36,792
- Spoke to Baba, GG?
- Yes, but he did not relent.

1384
01:46:37,803 --> 01:46:39,737
Now everything is on you.

1385
01:46:49,348 --> 01:46:51,339
- Where are you going?
- Coming.

1386
01:47:02,361 --> 01:47:03,760
This design is great.

1387
01:47:04,363 --> 01:47:07,355
- Shall I make one for you?
- What's the rate?

1388
01:47:07,766 --> 01:47:10,098
- Rs.35000.
- Rs.35000!g

1389
01:47:10,369 --> 01:47:11,358
Only for you.

1390
01:47:12,371 --> 01:47:13,770
Is this a rate, or a rage?

1391
01:47:25,783 --> 01:47:28,775
Excuse me.
John... John Abraham, right?

1392
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:33,381
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

1393
01:47:34,393 --> 01:47:37,385
- Are you the medical rep?
- No, Jai, Jai Vardhan.

1394
01:47:37,462 --> 01:47:40,728
You had suffered
from food poisoning.

1395
01:47:41,333 --> 01:47:44,325
Food poisoning?
Perhaps you are mistaken.

1396
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:47,737
You were going to model
for Vaga Fashions.

1397
01:47:48,707 --> 01:47:50,698
Vaga? What is that?o

1398
01:47:52,745 --> 01:47:56,738
Do you know GG, Gaurav Gupta?

1399
01:47:57,750 --> 01:48:00,344
GG, Natasha's boyfriend?

1400
01:48:02,354 --> 01:48:06,085
Looks like he made a fool of you.

1401
01:48:15,367 --> 01:48:18,768
Sorry, if you don't mind,
can I ask you for something?

1402
01:48:19,371 --> 01:48:21,771
- What?
- Just your five minutes.

1403
01:48:22,741 --> 01:48:24,504
- Okay.
- Thanks. Follow me.

1404
01:48:34,787 --> 01:48:36,778
What is your motive behind
Vaga Collections?

1405
01:48:36,889 --> 01:48:39,050
Vaga Collection has
only one aim.

1406
01:48:39,325 --> 01:48:41,725
To fulfil the desire
of fashion conscious people.

1407
01:48:42,328 --> 01:48:44,057
Vardhan is our partner...

1408
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:46,730
and they have made special
fabric for Vaga Collections.

1409
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:50,063
But what is so unique
about Vaga Collections?

1410
01:48:50,336 --> 01:48:53,737
That answer will be given by
our designer, Ashwin Raga.

1411
01:48:53,839 --> 01:48:55,306
- Thank you.
- All the best.

1412
01:48:56,709 --> 01:49:00,337
Vara Collections has the latest
international design range.

1413
01:49:00,412 --> 01:49:02,744
It is a new style statement
for the new generation.

1414
01:49:02,948 --> 01:49:04,074
What more do you want?

1415
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:06,078
Let's make today's evening
entertaining.

1416
01:49:06,351 --> 01:49:08,343
Please join us
for cocktails and dinner.

1417
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:15,349
Where were you?

1418
01:49:15,426 --> 01:49:18,760
- GG, John was telling me...
- What will John tell you? I will.

1419
01:49:19,765 --> 01:49:21,357
I wanted to make my
friend a model...

1420
01:49:21,433 --> 01:49:22,764
I took your excuse
and made him one.

1421
01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:26,770
- He was saying that you...
- I am saying it even now.

1422
01:49:27,373 --> 01:49:30,739
If he agrees, I can make
him a super model like you.

1423
01:49:32,344 --> 01:49:34,369
- I don't model anymore.
- Then?

1424
01:49:35,381 --> 01:49:36,780
Don't you read
the paper these days?

1425
01:49:37,382 --> 01:49:39,317
Anyway, all the best.

1426
01:49:57,736 --> 01:50:00,728
You all are liars. All of you.

1427
01:50:04,309 --> 01:50:06,743
Only scare him, don't touch him.

1428
01:50:15,754 --> 01:50:17,745
Jai, just wait.

1429
01:50:23,362 --> 01:50:24,761
Don't say anything.

1430
01:50:27,766 --> 01:50:29,358
What had you said?

1431
01:50:30,369 --> 01:50:32,667
That the most difficult thing for
a girl to decide...

1432
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:34,363
is who will not cheat her.

1433
01:50:36,341 --> 01:50:39,367
The man who is cheating the whole
world, will he not cheat you?

1434
01:50:44,382 --> 01:50:48,376
You are right, Jai.
He has cheated me too.

1435
01:50:50,389 --> 01:50:52,380
Influenced by his talks...

1436
01:50:54,393 --> 01:50:57,385
I was playing with your feelings.

1437
01:51:01,399 --> 01:51:02,389
Forgive me.

1438
01:51:05,404 --> 01:51:09,773
If you have understood this,
I'll only say...

1439
01:51:11,376 --> 01:51:12,364
take care.

1440
01:51:38,437 --> 01:51:40,371
Yes sir.
He has come to Tilak Nagar.

1441
01:51:41,373 --> 01:51:44,739
In the tribal colony.
He must have come to meet someone.

1442
01:51:45,344 --> 01:51:47,369
Why is he not getting off the car?

1443
01:51:54,786 --> 01:51:57,448
He got off.s

1444
01:51:58,790 --> 01:52:03,783
Hey listen. Only threaten him,
don't beat him. Okay?

1445
01:52:03,896 --> 01:52:05,386
- Yes.
- Go!

1446
01:52:15,373 --> 01:52:18,810
When will you give
Irfanbhai's money?

1447
01:52:19,411 --> 01:52:20,399
Turn back..

1448
01:52:21,413 --> 01:52:24,405
- Tell us!
- Don't touch me.

1449
01:52:24,483 --> 01:52:28,419
Don't stare.
When will you give the money?

1450
01:52:28,487 --> 01:52:29,818
Don't stare at us.n

1451
01:52:31,423 --> 01:52:32,822
I told you, don't touch me.

1452
01:53:07,391 --> 01:53:09,382
- Ramnath, Shambhu! Come quickly
- What have you done!

1453
01:53:09,461 --> 01:53:12,396
They are beating up Guruji's son!
Come quickly!

1454
01:53:13,398 --> 01:53:14,387
Let's run!s

1455
01:53:14,466 --> 01:53:24,364
They beat up Guruji's son.
They are mad! Catch them!

1456
01:53:27,412 --> 01:53:28,400
You dogs!

1457
01:54:16,395 --> 01:54:18,123
Okay, I have understood.
Don't tell anyone anything.

1458
01:54:18,397 --> 01:54:19,728
I won't.m

1459
01:54:28,407 --> 01:54:29,373
What happened?

1460
01:54:32,377 --> 01:54:35,403
Madhavi, what happened?n

1461
01:54:36,415 --> 01:54:38,406
Ashram dwellers...

1462
01:54:40,752 --> 01:54:43,346
Madhavi, this is
not the time to cry.

1463
01:54:43,755 --> 01:54:46,747
Go with Chandu,
I'll manage things here.

1464
01:54:47,359 --> 01:54:48,348
Go Madhavi.b

1465
01:54:59,771 --> 01:55:02,069
Are you mad? You will leave me?

1466
01:55:02,341 --> 01:55:04,741
Yes, I was mad,
to be with you for two years.

1467
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:07,369
Leave my hand. Leave!

1468
01:55:07,446 --> 01:55:10,381
This is the first and last time
you are using force on me.

1469
01:55:10,449 --> 01:55:13,384
- Enough now!
- Enough for me too.

1470
01:55:13,784 --> 01:55:14,774
Good.v

1471
01:55:16,388 --> 01:55:19,380
If you step out of here,
don't ever come back.

1472
01:55:20,658 --> 01:55:26,393
Alright. I'm taking only my things.
I've left everything you gave me.

1473
01:55:26,798 --> 01:55:28,789
In a few days anyway,
it's all going to go.

1474
01:55:29,801 --> 01:55:32,395
You will never be
able to win with Jai...

1475
01:55:32,437 --> 01:55:34,803
because you are not
honest with anybody.

1476
01:55:35,373 --> 01:55:36,773
Not even yourself.

1477
01:55:37,376 --> 01:55:38,741
Will you live in the Ashram,
or in Vardhan's bungalow?

1478
01:55:39,344 --> 01:55:41,744
He will fulfil your dreams now?

1479
01:55:44,349 --> 01:55:48,342
Forget my dreams, GG,
Think of your dream GG City.

1480
01:55:49,354 --> 01:55:52,755
A man who could not make one home,
he will make a city?

1481
01:56:50,348 --> 01:56:51,336
Have you come to fight again?

1482
01:56:57,354 --> 01:57:01,757
"Since I treat you as my life"

1483
01:57:04,362 --> 01:57:08,354
"Since I treat you as my life"

1484
01:57:09,367 --> 01:57:13,360
"Life seems to be like life now"

1485
01:57:18,777 --> 01:57:19,765
"Life seems to be like life now".

1486
01:57:28,787 --> 01:57:33,382
"Since I have come into your arms"

1487
01:57:34,391 --> 01:57:38,726
"I feel I have
found my destination"

1488
01:57:40,332 --> 01:57:45,326
"I feel I have
found my destination"

1489
01:58:06,358 --> 01:58:11,762
"There are many desires in the
heart, but also the dilemma..."

1490
01:58:12,363 --> 01:58:18,360
"that this love is killing"a

1491
01:58:19,771 --> 01:58:24,333
"There are many desires in the
heart, but also the dilemma..."

1492
01:58:25,777 --> 01:58:31,773
"that this love is killing"

1493
01:58:32,384 --> 01:58:38,720
"We have come at that turning
point in life"

1494
01:58:39,324 --> 01:58:45,319
"Where I cannot live without
your love"

1495
01:58:45,729 --> 01:58:50,326
"What do I call
this love of yours?"

1496
01:58:52,336 --> 01:58:56,706
"What do I call
this love of yours?"

1497
01:59:04,349 --> 01:59:08,752
"What do I do with
my love for you?"

1498
01:59:48,326 --> 01:59:53,729
"Until yesterday, our life
was a beautiful dream"

1499
01:59:54,332 --> 02:00:00,327
"I saw real life only today"

1500
02:00:01,339 --> 02:00:07,335
"Until yesterday, our life
was a beautiful dream"

1501
02:00:07,412 --> 02:00:13,748
"I saw real life only today"

1502
02:00:14,352 --> 02:00:20,348
"How it fights with
darkness for light"

1503
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:27,354
"At every moment,
every life is fighting"

1504
02:00:27,765 --> 02:00:32,362
"Now I realise what is true,
what is false"

1505
02:00:34,372 --> 02:00:38,774
"Now I realise what is true,
what is false"

1506
02:00:39,377 --> 02:00:43,780
"I will live life my own way now"

1507
02:00:45,783 --> 02:00:50,380
"I will live life my own way now"

1508
02:01:12,810 --> 02:01:17,145
Look, heed me. Come back to
Rishi-Van. Is this life?

1509
02:01:17,415 --> 02:01:20,407
What is over here? You will
not get anything in this hell.

1510
02:01:20,485 --> 02:01:22,146
Don't believe ministers talks.

1511
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:24,149
They are not going
to give you homes.

1512
02:01:24,422 --> 02:01:27,414
- How will we get back our land?
- I will get it back for you.

1513
02:01:27,826 --> 02:01:31,819
But I want a promise
from you all too.

1514
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:34,830
When I call you, you all
will come together with me.

1515
02:01:35,433 --> 02:01:37,833
If you are with me,
raise your hand and say yes.

1516
02:01:41,372 --> 02:01:42,339
Yes!

1517
02:01:51,381 --> 02:01:54,373
I'm sorry, uncle.
I made a grave mistake.

1518
02:01:54,786 --> 02:01:56,777
How many times
will you apologise?

1519
02:01:57,388 --> 02:02:01,791
Now go to the Ashram,
you are needed there.

1520
02:02:02,393 --> 02:02:06,386
I'll go, uncle. But I have
to meet Irfanbhai first.

1521
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:10,798
I have spoken to the Commissioner.
It will be done.

1522
02:02:18,376 --> 02:02:22,745
- Excuse me. Irfanbhai.
- DCP Deshmukh has sent us.

1523
02:02:22,814 --> 02:02:25,408
- Go.
- Thank you. You wait here.

1524
02:02:30,421 --> 02:02:31,819
I'll call you later.

1525
02:02:32,423 --> 02:02:34,823
- What is it?
- I'm Jaidev Vardhan.

1526
02:02:35,426 --> 02:02:38,417
Yes, DCP Deshmukh had called.
What do you want?

1527
02:02:38,763 --> 02:02:41,095
How much betting had GG
done with you in my name?

1528
02:02:41,366 --> 02:02:45,359
- GG? Who GG?
- Gaurav Gupta.

1529
02:02:45,403 --> 02:02:47,371
That builder?
What happened to him?

1530
02:02:47,405 --> 02:02:49,339
He did betting with you, right?

1531
02:02:49,741 --> 02:02:51,732
He used to play before,
he hasn't since many days.

1532
02:02:52,777 --> 02:02:54,768
But I don't understand.
What is the matter?

1533
02:02:56,781 --> 02:03:01,774
Tell me something, Irfanbhai.
Did GG bet with you on my behalf?

1534
02:03:02,387 --> 02:03:05,788
I told you, when he himself did not
play, how will he bet in your name?

1535
02:03:07,792 --> 02:03:08,781
Can't believe this!n

1536
02:03:17,801 --> 02:03:23,104
GG, Jai here. How much money
do I have to give Irfanbhai?

1537
02:03:23,373 --> 02:03:25,103
Where are you, Jai?
Are you alright?

1538
02:03:25,376 --> 02:03:27,400
Irfanbhai's men made
a small mistake.

1539
02:03:27,478 --> 02:03:32,415
A big mistake. And the mistake
was not of Irfanbhai's men.

1540
02:03:32,817 --> 02:03:33,806
It was your men.

1541
02:03:34,419 --> 02:03:37,819
- Jai, Irfanbhai is mad.
- Is it?

1542
02:03:38,423 --> 02:03:40,084
Take, talk to Irfanbhai.

1543
02:03:40,358 --> 02:03:44,351
- What's going on?
- Irfanbhai, how are you?

1544
02:03:44,762 --> 02:03:47,094
I was just teasing my friend.

1545
02:03:47,364 --> 02:03:51,768
Tease, but in your own name.
I do business here.

1546
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:54,361
DCP Deshmukh called here.

1547
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:58,332
And who are you playing
this game with?

1548
02:03:58,443 --> 02:04:02,379
Why are you getting angry? Give
the phone to Jai, I'll explain.

1549
02:04:06,384 --> 02:04:07,372
Hello Jai.e

1550
02:04:09,787 --> 02:04:10,775
Thank you.e

1551
02:04:11,389 --> 02:04:18,386
Why trouble the DCP or police? If
ever you need me, here's my number.

1552
02:04:20,398 --> 02:04:22,389
Call me directly.g

1553
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:25,391
I won't need your number.

1554
02:04:35,813 --> 02:04:39,748
This area is very good.
How far is the Ashram from here?

1555
02:04:40,351 --> 02:04:44,344
- About 40 kms. Want to go?
- Some other time.

1556
02:04:44,756 --> 02:04:49,352
What do we do about Guruji? He is
asking for a 50 year lease again.

1557
02:04:49,426 --> 02:04:53,363
Please don't extend
the lease of the Ashram.

1558
02:04:54,364 --> 02:04:56,094
Because of that Ashram...

1559
02:04:56,367 --> 02:04:58,766
the development of this
entire region is stalled.

1560
02:04:59,370 --> 02:05:01,770
Until that Ashram exists,
Guruji won't allow development.

1561
02:05:02,739 --> 02:05:04,332
Give him some place
outside Songarh.

1562
02:05:05,343 --> 02:05:07,777
Give the land to GG
for development.

1563
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:13,783
That's okay, but how will
we remove the Ashram?

1564
02:05:15,386 --> 02:05:18,378
What is there to remove?
Just 8-10 sheds, and some huts.

1565
02:05:18,790 --> 02:05:22,783
Against this Ashram,
GG will make a new Ashram for them.

1566
02:05:23,394 --> 02:05:25,794
With all facilities.
I'll make a modern Ashram.

1567
02:05:26,397 --> 02:05:28,126
I take the guarantee.

1568
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:34,395
If he's ready to make a new Ashram,
what problem does Guruji have?

1569
02:05:34,439 --> 02:05:36,372
That is what I am saying, sir.

1570
02:05:37,375 --> 02:05:41,744
CM, it is in our interest.

1571
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:49,343
- Okay, I'll look into it.
- Thank you.

1572
02:06:32,397 --> 02:06:34,388
I know you are
somewhere here, Baba.

1573
02:06:46,344 --> 02:06:48,335
I know you can hear me, Baba.

1574
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:56,753
I made a grave mistake, Baba.
Forgive me.

1575
02:07:04,362 --> 02:07:09,355
I have become alone, Baba. I have
realized what it is to be an orphan

1576
02:07:17,341 --> 02:07:19,774
Baba, forgive me.

1577
02:07:23,381 --> 02:07:25,372
Forgive me.

1578
02:07:42,333 --> 02:07:47,327
GG ruined my life.
I will not spare him!

1579
02:07:49,707 --> 02:07:51,299
I will not spare him!

1580
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:22,738
Premji, our relationship
dates 20 years.

1581
02:08:23,341 --> 02:08:25,774
Then why did you introduce
my son to such a man?

1582
02:08:26,377 --> 02:08:28,777
I myself didn't know
he would turn out like this.

1583
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:31,780
And I introduced them
in the interest of both.

1584
02:08:33,783 --> 02:08:35,376
What can be done now?t

1585
02:08:35,786 --> 02:08:39,313
- I'll think, Guruji.
- Think.

1586
02:08:40,324 --> 02:08:45,728
Calm down.

1587
02:08:47,732 --> 02:08:49,324
This notice says...

1588
02:08:49,367 --> 02:08:53,030
the government is not extending
the lease of the Ashram.

1589
02:08:53,336 --> 02:08:55,032
- But sir...
- Let me finish.

1590
02:08:55,306 --> 02:08:57,706
I spoke to their lawyer,
Mr. Khote.

1591
02:08:58,743 --> 02:09:04,738
They are talking of giving us
a new Ashram outside Songarh.

1592
02:09:05,349 --> 02:09:09,342
You have to decide what
we have to do next.

1593
02:09:11,354 --> 02:09:15,689
No sir, if we listen to them,
even we will face the same fate...

1594
02:09:15,860 --> 02:09:16,757
the tribals did.

1595
02:09:17,361 --> 02:09:20,762
Just think, where will we
take all these people and go?

1596
02:09:31,342 --> 02:09:34,778
Tell them we will
not leave the Ashram.

1597
02:09:35,379 --> 02:09:37,779
We will not leave
this land and go anywhere.

1598
02:09:40,318 --> 02:09:41,307
And this year...

1599
02:09:42,319 --> 02:09:45,312
we will surely celebrate
our Ashram's golden jubilee.

1600
02:09:46,324 --> 02:09:47,313
Over here.r

1601
02:09:56,334 --> 02:09:59,735
One seed is broken
and put in a different medium...

1602
02:10:00,337 --> 02:10:02,703
and in a few days,
from one, many plants are grown.

1603
02:10:03,708 --> 02:10:05,733
After keeping them
separate for some time...

1604
02:10:06,344 --> 02:10:10,747
in about 4-5 months, they are
ready to be planted in the ground.

1605
02:10:11,349 --> 02:10:14,750
And this year, the Ashram children
will plant 500000 plants.

1606
02:10:15,853 --> 02:10:19,345
And the man doing this massive
task is Jaidev Vardhan.

1607
02:10:19,756 --> 02:10:22,351
Why are you doing this?

1608
02:10:22,426 --> 02:10:25,759
As per my father's desire, and
with the Collector's permission...

1609
02:10:26,363 --> 02:10:28,764
I want to make the whole
of Songarh green.

1610
02:10:29,367 --> 02:10:31,358
Then what is your hurdle
in this task?

1611
02:10:31,769 --> 02:10:34,363
Just one, builder Gaurav Gupta.

1612
02:10:34,405 --> 02:10:37,067
He wants to grab land
and make a city here.

1613
02:10:37,341 --> 02:10:39,104
And the minister and MLA
here Mr. Amrit Patil...

1614
02:10:39,377 --> 02:10:40,366
is supporting him.

1615
02:10:55,393 --> 02:10:57,792
A big scam has surfaced,
the Rishi-Van scam.

1616
02:10:58,396 --> 02:11:00,796
Where on one hand, the government
is busy demolishing huts...

1617
02:11:01,399 --> 02:11:06,393
Minister Patil has created
a new colony, Tilak Nagar.

1618
02:11:06,437 --> 02:11:09,372
A huge scene was created in
the Assembly over the matter.

1619
02:11:14,412 --> 02:11:17,404
Mr. Patil, you say there
is no scam in the Rishi-Van case.

1620
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:19,813
Look, this is a propaganda
of these people only.

1621
02:11:20,417 --> 02:11:22,408
You'll even say there
was no deluge in Mumbai.

1622
02:11:22,486 --> 02:11:24,420
The truth is you want a deluge,
so that you can take money...

1623
02:11:24,488 --> 02:11:26,479
from the central government
and fill your coffers.

1624
02:11:26,557 --> 02:11:29,150
People like you pray
deluge, drought, earthquakes.

1625
02:11:29,426 --> 02:11:33,830
Look, you are the son of
the very respected Guruji.

1626
02:11:34,432 --> 02:11:39,062
So think, understand,
weigh your words...

1627
02:11:39,370 --> 02:11:40,359
and then speak.

1628
02:11:40,771 --> 02:11:43,331
Every year, before rains, you
proclaim there will be a drought.

1629
02:11:43,407 --> 02:11:46,103
Then beg for 4000-5000 million
from the central government.

1630
02:11:46,377 --> 02:11:48,105
That's what you have been doing
every year for the last 10 years.

1631
02:11:48,379 --> 02:11:52,372
What can anyone do
against natural calamities?

1632
02:11:53,384 --> 02:11:55,113
If you won't, who else will?

1633
02:11:55,386 --> 02:11:57,377
The speed with which trees are
being cut because of you...

1634
02:11:57,455 --> 02:11:59,787
we will either have deluges,
or droughts every year.

1635
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:02,723
You have sent all the people
of your region to Mumbai.

1636
02:12:02,792 --> 02:12:05,125
But have you see in what
state they are living there?

1637
02:12:05,396 --> 02:12:07,125
Your Qutub Minar turned
out to be smart.

1638
02:12:07,398 --> 02:12:10,128
He learnt to manage the media
from you, and is teaching you.

1639
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:11,800
Even hens are not taken
to slaughter houses...

1640
02:12:11,902 --> 02:12:13,699
the way people travel in
trains in Mumbai.

1641
02:12:13,804 --> 02:12:15,362
Now you think, weigh, and speak.

1642
02:12:16,373 --> 02:12:17,773
Part from begging from the
central government for your area...

1643
02:12:17,875 --> 02:12:19,399
what else have you done?p

1644
02:12:23,814 --> 02:12:28,808
Speak... give an answer, Mr. Patil.
Your time is coming to an end.

1645
02:12:29,819 --> 02:12:32,812
Down with the CM!

1646
02:12:33,424 --> 02:12:38,417
The police arrested people who were
protesting the demolition of huts.

1647
02:12:38,496 --> 02:12:42,762
The tribals living in Tilak Nagar
decided to go back to Songarh.

1648
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,364
Our reporters say...c

1649
02:12:48,406 --> 02:12:50,738
like they had found life again.

1650
02:12:51,742 --> 02:12:55,371
The return of these tribals has
been possible due to Jaidev Vardhan.

1651
02:12:56,781 --> 02:12:59,773
Now what decision
the CM takes on this issue...

1652
02:13:00,384 --> 02:13:02,783
the future of the tribals
depends on it.

1653
02:13:05,790 --> 02:13:07,781
In Songarh,
the return of the tribals...

1654
02:13:07,891 --> 02:13:09,381
has put the government in a fix.

1655
02:13:09,460 --> 02:13:12,395
A tense atmosphere has been
created regarding tribal land.

1656
02:13:12,797 --> 02:13:17,393
It is the first time that people
living in huts in any city...

1657
02:13:17,435 --> 02:13:19,095
have returned to their village.

1658
02:13:19,403 --> 02:13:22,770
The Chief Minister spoke to the
media on this explosive issue.

1659
02:13:23,373 --> 02:13:24,363
One by one.

1660
02:13:24,442 --> 02:13:27,809
What are you going to do with the
tribals returning to Songarh?

1661
02:13:28,813 --> 02:13:31,407
I cannot say anything now.

1662
02:13:31,482 --> 02:13:33,416
The land on which millions of
saplings have been planted...

1663
02:13:33,484 --> 02:13:36,419
you are selling it to GG builders
under pressure from Mr. Patil?

1664
02:13:37,421 --> 02:13:42,358
You all know I never work
under pressure.

1665
02:13:42,426 --> 02:13:44,086
Due to fear of the
government falling...

1666
02:13:44,361 --> 02:13:46,090
won't you extend the lease
of Rishi-Van Ashram?

1667
02:13:46,363 --> 02:13:49,354
You will let the Ashram and
the 500000 plants be destroyed...

1668
02:13:49,399 --> 02:13:52,369
and not extend the 50 year
lease of the Ashram?

1669
02:13:52,403 --> 02:13:56,737
Look, I am going for the golden
jubilee celebrations of the Ashram.

1670
02:13:57,341 --> 02:13:59,104
I will myself go and check...

1671
02:13:59,376 --> 02:14:02,368
that if really 500000 saplings
have been planted...

1672
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:06,372
I will decide right
there what I should do.

1673
02:14:07,384 --> 02:14:11,787
Reporters tried to talk to GG, the
builder connected to Rishi-van.

1674
02:14:12,389 --> 02:14:17,382
But annoyed with their questions,
he misbehaved with them.

1675
02:14:17,795 --> 02:14:19,786
He left without replying.s

1676
02:14:20,397 --> 02:14:22,797
A man who can behave like this
with the media...

1677
02:14:23,399 --> 02:14:27,803
how he must have behaved with the
poor tribals can be guessed.

1678
02:14:29,372 --> 02:14:33,139
The GG City that I, CM and Patil
could not complete...

1679
02:14:33,409 --> 02:14:34,809
you will complete it.

1680
02:14:35,412 --> 02:14:40,747
- Who is behind the 500 million?
- What will you know that and do?

1681
02:14:41,352 --> 02:14:43,081
And how much do you know the CM?

1682
02:14:43,354 --> 02:14:46,755
Heed me, in politics,
nobody can be trusted.

1683
02:14:47,358 --> 02:14:51,761
And the CM who says he will
decide at the place itself...

1684
02:14:52,363 --> 02:14:54,354
has decide something already.

1685
02:14:56,766 --> 02:14:59,361
How did you see a golden brick
in this broken home?

1686
02:15:02,339 --> 02:15:04,330
Are you talking business,
or politics?

1687
02:15:04,408 --> 02:15:07,774
If you have understood,
what do you say about my offer?

1688
02:15:08,779 --> 02:15:14,774
Take 500 million and the land and
machinery standing there is mine!

1689
02:15:15,786 --> 02:15:17,378
Or you will be ruined.

1690
02:15:26,397 --> 02:15:28,797
Keep the 500 million
offer with you, Mr. Prem.

1691
02:15:30,801 --> 02:15:34,794
Forget land and machinery,
for 500 million...

1692
02:15:36,372 --> 02:15:38,738
I won't even sell
you GG City's soil.

1693
02:15:41,345 --> 02:15:45,747
If the CM is going to Rishi-Van,
even I will.

1694
02:15:50,354 --> 02:15:53,345
We were standing here
when you asked me to wait a year.

1695
02:15:54,358 --> 02:15:56,757
A year is almost over,
what do you say now?

1696
02:15:57,361 --> 02:16:00,353
The situation was different then,
it is different now.

1697
02:16:00,431 --> 02:16:03,366
That means, you change stance
according to situation.

1698
02:16:03,399 --> 02:16:05,765
GG, even I suffered a loss.

1699
02:16:06,370 --> 02:16:10,328
Only if there are profits.
All the loss is mine.

1700
02:16:11,342 --> 02:16:14,368
Let me remind you,
all the money invested is mine.

1701
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:18,780
I'll be ruined, Patil.

1702
02:16:19,382 --> 02:16:20,782
I'll be ruined!

1703
02:16:24,388 --> 02:16:31,794
GG, Patil is still alive.
We'll do something.

1704
02:16:40,336 --> 02:16:42,305
People have reached here
in thousands.

1705
02:16:42,372 --> 02:16:44,307
The function is about to begin.

1706
02:16:54,351 --> 02:16:58,344
The CM is coming, but
industrialist Homi Wadia right now...

1707
02:16:58,422 --> 02:17:01,357
is welcoming high court
Justice, the honorable Mr. Ahmed.

1708
02:17:35,391 --> 02:17:39,055
"O cloud of the sky,
you bring water from the sea"

1709
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:42,321
"And fall on earth"

1710
02:17:50,506 --> 02:17:54,341
"O cloud of the sky,
you bring water from the sea"

1711
02:17:54,745 --> 02:17:58,737
"And fall on earth"

1712
02:17:59,349 --> 02:18:01,340
"On the green earth..."

1713
02:18:04,754 --> 02:18:08,350
"On the green earth
flash colours of love"

1714
02:18:08,425 --> 02:18:13,761
"Happiness is dancing
with spring today"

1715
02:18:14,765 --> 02:18:17,756
"O cloud of the sky,
you bring water from the sea"

1716
02:18:18,368 --> 02:18:22,326
"And fall on earth"

1717
02:18:22,406 --> 02:18:25,341
"On the green earth..."

1718
02:18:28,378 --> 02:18:31,779
"On the green earth
flash colours of love"

1719
02:18:32,381 --> 02:18:37,376
"Happiness is dancing
with spring today"

1720
02:18:37,788 --> 02:18:43,317
"Happiness is dancing
with spring today"

1721
02:18:56,306 --> 02:18:59,742
"If there are jungles,
there will be life"

1722
02:19:00,343 --> 02:19:03,745
"And the cycle of
life will continue"

1723
02:19:07,351 --> 02:19:10,752
"If there are jungles,
there will be life"

1724
02:19:11,354 --> 02:19:15,348
"And the cycle of
life will continue"

1725
02:19:15,425 --> 02:19:19,087
"We get oxygen for breathing
from trees and plants"

1726
02:19:19,362 --> 02:19:23,093
"Their branches are paths of life"

1727
02:19:23,367 --> 02:19:25,766
"In time..."n

1728
02:19:29,339 --> 02:19:33,104
"Weather changes in the world
in time due to them"

1729
02:19:33,377 --> 02:19:37,780
"Happiness is dancing
with spring today"

1730
02:19:54,730 --> 02:19:58,325
"On the green earth
flash colours of love"

1731
02:19:58,735 --> 02:20:09,339
"Happiness is dancing
with spring today"

1732
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:25,352
Go up and drink liquor!

1733
02:20:41,378 --> 02:20:42,367
Pick him!e

1734
02:20:54,390 --> 02:20:56,381
Let's leave, hurry!

1735
02:21:05,402 --> 02:21:10,361
Over there!
Catch them! Don't spare them!

1736
02:21:55,786 --> 02:21:57,378
My God! There is a fire!

1737
02:21:59,790 --> 02:22:02,782
The Ayurvedic factory of
the Ashram has caught fire.

1738
02:22:03,393 --> 02:22:04,791
There is chaos all around.

1739
02:22:04,895 --> 02:22:08,387
What is worth noting is that
the CM has yet to reach here.

1740
02:22:08,465 --> 02:22:11,399
Police, don't let anyone go
across the bridge.

1741
02:22:11,434 --> 02:22:15,769
Sit down everybody!
Calm down!

1742
02:23:39,022 --> 02:23:42,082
The fire is spreading.
We have to see...

1743
02:23:42,359 --> 02:23:48,764
whether the tanks put up to water
these plants, can save them today.

1744
02:23:56,339 --> 02:24:00,104
This fire was started to destroy
the saplings planted in the Ashram...

1745
02:24:00,377 --> 02:24:03,107
so that when the CM comes,
there are no plants.

1746
02:24:03,379 --> 02:24:05,109
The CM is going to decide
to extend the lease...

1747
02:24:05,381 --> 02:24:06,781
based on the planting of saplings.

1748
02:24:44,354 --> 02:24:45,753
The good news is that
the fire has been doused...

1749
02:24:45,855 --> 02:24:48,346
and even the CM has reached here.

1750
02:25:10,379 --> 02:25:15,783
- Are you involved in this fire?
- Should you always suspect me?

1751
02:25:17,387 --> 02:25:19,787
The whole incident has happened
before Justice Ahmed.

1752
02:25:20,390 --> 02:25:22,119
The main witness in the case has
been saved...

1753
02:25:22,391 --> 02:25:23,380
and he has given his statement.

1754
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:25,791
Jaidev Vardhan is
taking him to the stage.

1755
02:25:35,372 --> 02:25:37,362
Sir, whatever happened today,
you have witnessed it yourself.

1756
02:25:38,742 --> 02:25:40,733
These people tried to burn the
500000 saplings...

1757
02:25:40,843 --> 02:25:44,336
along with the Ashram. And threw
this man in the burning fire.

1758
02:25:46,349 --> 02:25:51,343
I only request you,
please do something.

1759
02:25:57,360 --> 02:26:00,761
Everyone present here, listen.

1760
02:26:08,371 --> 02:26:13,364
Realizing the seriousness of
the act, I order...

1761
02:26:14,377 --> 02:26:19,371
that those involved in
this act, the Minister, Patil...

1762
02:26:20,382 --> 02:26:21,782
and Gaurav Gupta, the builder...

1763
02:26:22,385 --> 02:26:26,788
and their men who were caught
at the place of incident...

1764
02:26:27,390 --> 02:26:29,380
be immediately arrested.

1765
02:26:31,394 --> 02:26:35,387
And they be kept in police
custody until the case is heard.

1766
02:26:36,398 --> 02:26:39,334
I order the police to take
immediate action.

1767
02:26:41,337 --> 02:26:45,741
For the first time, I see a Justice
give verdict on the spot.

1768
02:26:46,343 --> 02:26:47,742
CM, do something.n

1769
02:26:48,745 --> 02:26:52,340
We had decided you won't
ask for anything for two years,

1770
02:26:52,415 --> 02:26:55,350
- You can save me.
- How?

1771
02:26:55,417 --> 02:26:56,407
What do you mean, how?

1772
02:26:56,486 --> 02:26:59,751
I cannot go against
the Justice order.

1773
02:27:00,357 --> 02:27:02,756
And anyway, you always talk
of pulling down the government.

1774
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:04,748
CM...e

1775
02:27:04,861 --> 02:27:07,762
I'll announce elections
on this issue.

1776
02:27:08,364 --> 02:27:11,765
I had told you,
eat only how much you can digest.

1777
02:27:12,369 --> 02:27:14,769
- Look CM...
- Go!

1778
02:27:50,707 --> 02:27:54,734
I told you, in politics,
nobody is your friend.

1779
02:27:55,745 --> 02:27:58,339
Accept my offer
and settle this deal.

1780
02:27:59,349 --> 02:28:01,681
Sign these papers and you will
have 500 million...

1781
02:28:01,751 --> 02:28:03,343
in your account tomorrow.

1782
02:28:04,754 --> 02:28:09,350
Sell the land to us.
Maybe we have the GG tomorrow.

1783
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:12,351
Or you will lose everything.
Everything!

1784
02:28:14,363 --> 02:28:18,357
I trusted you for so many years.
I invested in your company.

1785
02:28:19,369 --> 02:28:23,066
Trust me once. Maybe you are
released from this case too.

1786
02:28:29,379 --> 02:28:32,371
It was a conspiracy! In which, he
was made to drink...

1787
02:28:32,449 --> 02:28:35,782
so that he would
be blamed for the fire.

1788
02:28:36,386 --> 02:28:38,114
But he is fine now. I also fought.

1789
02:28:38,388 --> 02:28:44,054
Now the perpetrators will be
behind bars for six months...

1790
02:28:44,326 --> 02:28:46,318
under a non-bailable warrant.

1791
02:28:47,330 --> 02:28:50,730
If need be, I will myself fight
this case. Bhajalal, MA, LLb.

1792
02:28:51,334 --> 02:28:54,325
Won't you like to know
who is behind this?

1793
02:28:57,707 --> 02:29:03,339
Mr. Prem, GG always plays blind.
I know.

1794
02:29:09,352 --> 02:29:13,083
- What a move, Qutub Minar!
- I learnt it from you...

1795
02:29:13,355 --> 02:29:14,754
leaning tower of Giza.

1796
02:29:18,361 --> 02:29:22,354
You have won this game. Keep
the money too in your account...

1797
02:29:23,399 --> 02:29:24,765
until the next move.

1798
02:29:25,769 --> 02:29:29,330
I have stopped playing, GG,
Perhaps you won't understand.

1799
02:29:31,341 --> 02:29:33,366
But despite losing,
you won this move.

1800
02:29:34,377 --> 02:29:37,778
Because now the land will
go to those who have a right to it.

1801
02:29:40,316 --> 02:29:42,307
You have a right
to say anything today.

1802
02:29:43,319 --> 02:29:44,718
Yet I'll say this.

1803
02:29:45,321 --> 02:29:47,312
Neither was getting
you beaten my aim.

1804
02:29:49,325 --> 02:29:51,725
Nor was this sabotage at my behest.

1805
02:29:52,327 --> 02:29:55,320
You made friends
only for benefit, GG,

1806
02:29:56,332 --> 02:29:59,324
And such friendship
only gives losses.

1807
02:29:59,735 --> 02:30:01,727
If you extend your hand
only for friendship...

1808
02:30:04,306 --> 02:30:06,332
my hand is always available.

1809
02:30:07,744 --> 02:30:10,735
Okay, but only till the next move.

1810
02:30:14,950 --> 02:30:16,350
Thank you Premji. Come.i

1811
02:30:17,753 --> 02:30:20,746
Now the people here are waiting
for the CM's decision.

1812
02:30:21,357 --> 02:30:24,349
The future of thousands of kids
of the Ashram is in his hands.

1813
02:30:25,762 --> 02:30:28,753
I regret all the incidents
that happened in the Ashram.

1814
02:30:29,766 --> 02:30:33,360
And I hold the government
responsible for it...

1815
02:30:34,370 --> 02:30:36,338
and apologise to you for it.

1816
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:39,364
The work the government
should have done...

1817
02:30:39,442 --> 02:30:43,775
Guruji has fulfilled
that responsibility.

1818
02:30:45,782 --> 02:30:51,778
I am proud that such a man,
such an Ashram...

1819
02:30:52,788 --> 02:30:54,380
is in my state.

1820
02:30:55,791 --> 02:31:01,788
So I extend the lease of the
Ashram, not for 50 years...

1821
02:31:01,897 --> 02:31:04,389
but 99 years.

1822
02:31:47,777 --> 02:31:50,769
"You are the strength of the heart,
everyone's hope"

1823
02:31:51,380 --> 02:31:53,372
"You are everyone's companion"

1824
02:31:55,385 --> 02:31:58,377
"You are man's every breath"

1825
02:31:59,389 --> 02:32:02,380
"You are the hope of every moment"

1826
02:32:03,393 --> 02:32:06,794
"Everyone is distant,
you are close"

1827
02:32:07,396 --> 02:32:10,798
"When there is sun,
you are shade"

1828
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:15,770
"How do you recognise your
intangible form?"

1829
02:32:19,409 --> 02:32:23,812
"Everyone here looks
for his own zenith"

1830
02:32:26,415 --> 02:32:30,409
Forgive me, Baba.
I made a mistake, Baba.

1831
02:32:35,425 --> 02:32:40,361
"O God you are the true
zenith of everyone's path.

1832
02:32:46,769 --> 02:32:53,368
