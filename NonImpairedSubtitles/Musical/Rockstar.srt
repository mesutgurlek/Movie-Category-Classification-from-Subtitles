1
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,600
Do you know?

2
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,501
So far away from here,

3
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,972
Across the wrong and right...

4
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,047
there is a ground,

5
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,484
I will meet you over there,

6
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,036
Amazing!

7
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,381
You wanted to become a hero,

8
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,181
You are showing cinema here,
What's the matter?

9
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,421
Come to police station,
I will shoot your song,

10
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,830
Sean Morrison!
What?

11
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,391
He was a great singer,

12
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,832
Girls used to tear up their clothes
to see him,

13
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,066
He went to the crowd,

14
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,173
On the stage,

15
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,474
Showed up his middle finger,
Like this...

16
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,480
And crowd were happy,

17
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,510
People were applauding to him that
he did such a greatjob,

18
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,151
And I am singing a song
here respectfully.

19
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,121
So the people of bus stand could
pass their time,

20
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,363
And they are slapping on my face,
It was really bad,

21
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,429
It means I have no level.

22
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,933
There are so many criminals
in Delhi,

23
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,099
Catch them first,
You are right.

24
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,032
Why only this poor fellow,

25
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,893
It's a dead piece.

26
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,992
And it's a Jumna part of fashion,

27
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,807
Have some style.

28
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,911
You are on stage,

29
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,451
Like this...

30
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,349
Like you are going to screw them all.

31
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,342
What happen?

32
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,481
My days are not going well.

33
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,516
Only your days are bad,

34
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,455
If you didn't stop your music,

35
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,218
then how your entire life
is going to screw up.

36
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,988
You are such a negative person,

37
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,199
Like if he will join his father
business so he will be successful.

38
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,028
I will neverjoin transport line,

39
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,231
So finish your studies and be
a lawyer here for Rs. 30,000.

40
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,904
You can't fly so high,
You mean nobody should even try.

41
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,639
Then he doesn't have any chance,

42
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,434
He already have no chance,

43
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,514
Nobody has become a Rock star like this

44
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,674
But he is playing guitar since childhood.

45
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,177
So why he didn't made it yet,

46
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,055
You mean...
Because he have no abilities.

47
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,081
He is not that damn good.

48
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,960
And what kind of friends you are?

49
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,563
You just want to spend his money
for snacks,

50
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,327
As soon he will understand it
will be good for him,

51
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,038
Take my number,

52
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,072
Give me a call if I will be selected,

53
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,108
Feed it,
You have a visiting card,

54
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,545
If I work more hard then...

55
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,216
Even a donkey works hard,

56
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,951
Then what's missing in me?

57
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,289
Look!

58
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,622
An artist have a heart,

59
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,331
He have a personality,
And I don't have it,

60
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,560
It's not like that,

61
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,129
Your life is not like that,

62
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,005
There is another kind of life who
turned a man into artist,

63
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,308
Which kind of?
You check everyone's life...

64
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:58,515
Like all artists, musician, writer
and painters...

65
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,013
Look at them,

66
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,518
You will find a common thing
amongst them,

67
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,053
What?

68
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,450
You just check by yourself.

69
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,594
Pain! Tears...

70
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,473
Till you don't have pain in your life.

71
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,603
Nobody will become a famous
in life,

72
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,145
And reform your friends,

73
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,473
If you will stay with them so
they will put rubbish in your mind,

74
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,680
They have suffered lot of pain,

75
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,188
They got many wounds...

76
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,488
They trembled with pain,

77
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,663
Lot of pain,

78
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,593
They have suffered tragedy,

79
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,235
And me...

80
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,266
I didn't suffered from anything,

81
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,138
I don't have single pain,

82
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,520
I never felt shortage of food,

83
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,418
I didn't face any problem for house,

84
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,422
My parents are still alive,

85
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,494
Nor I got beaten up in childhood,

86
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,465
Nor somebody molest my
in my life.

87
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,766
I am not even adopted,

88
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,675
I never met a serious accident,

89
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,772
Nor I have deadly disease,

90
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,057
Music comes from only broken heart,

91
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,659
When you heart breaks...

92
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,721
then the tunes comes...

93
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,102
What happened with you?

94
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,637
Did you heart ever broken,

95
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,703
Did you ever felt in love?

96
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,871
If you have to think then
it's not a love,

97
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,715
Love...

98
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:16,482
and...

99
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,523
Where will the music come from?

100
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,154
You tell me,

101
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,662
J. J!

102
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,500
You should come along,
No! I am leaving,

103
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,207
And I don't like dance,

104
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,874
Who is going to watch dance,
We are going to see girls.

105
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,303
You better watch,

106
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,468
What to see?

107
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,841
Till she is here she will
be number 1.

108
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,823
People are right about Kashmir,

109
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,238
If heaven is somewhere in the world,

110
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,274
So it's here...

111
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,469
Creator has used such great material.

112
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,611
Material is same,

113
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,248
but engineering is mind blowing,

114
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,312
Car or Girl?

115
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,819
Both!

116
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,302
It's her last dance,

117
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,865
Why she was in hurry for marriage?

118
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,416
Look at her from distance so
you will be happy.

119
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,557
I must have to try once,

120
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,828
Many people have tried,

121
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,559
but all of them were failed,

122
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,502
It's a heart breaking machine,

123
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,295
Hi!

124
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,535
Janardhan!
J.J. For short.

125
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:26,695
I want to talk to you,

126
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,301
About what?

127
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,802
Actually you...

128
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,978
Iooks so cute to me,
that's what I wanted to say,

129
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,039
And you are really hot,

130
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,752
Amazing combo,
Hot and cute at same time,

131
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,554
I love you,

132
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,416
Be my girlfriend,

133
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,792
Can you see that they are
laughing on you,

134
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,591
I can see you only,

135
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,660
You can see me...

136
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,731
So look at me very carefully
that what I am saying,

137
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,702
We will rock together,

138
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,968
Think about it,
Hey! Are you stupid?

139
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,106
No!
Only crazy for you baby,

140
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,713
One second!
Let me think,

141
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,820
Yes, I am sure you idiot,
Get off from here,

142
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,089
You are breaking my heart,

143
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,055
Don't show me your face again,

144
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,820
Shall I eat 2 samosa in this chatni,

145
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,524
Bring more,

146
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,056
It's funny for you,

147
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,596
I really love her,

148
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,168
What should I tell you?

149
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,038
How did I feel when she said
Burger off!

150
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,545
I don't even know it's meaning,

151
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,510
You are such a cheap person,

152
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,256
If your heart would be broken so you
would having samosa's here,

153
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,856
You would be fighting for Chatni,

154
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,496
You couldn't even pass the bite
from your throat,

155
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,862
You should have desperation
in your love,

156
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:14,995
You should have pain,

157
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,267
It's not love.

158
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,075
It's a drama,

159
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,015
What should I do?
What's the way?

160
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,884
How do I...

161
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:35,984
He must have forgotten,

162
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,762
Really!
But we never forget,

163
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,755
Where you have lost?

164
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,095
Look at him!
He is not listening to his brother,

165
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,764
I am in stress,

166
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,904
Don't yell at me right now,
So when should I scold you?

167
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,574
Give me the appointment,

168
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,802
Tuesday at 11 will be fine,

169
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,652
I have to propose Heer,

170
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,956
It's a true love,

171
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,967
She have no right to leave me and
get marry with someone else

172
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,295
because he is rich,

173
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,033
Give me one chance,

174
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,637
I will work really hard,

175
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,167
I will become rich,

176
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,345
If you will come to me again then
you will see what will I do with you,

177
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:29,705
What will you do?

178
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,145
I will break your legs.

179
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,611
I will restrict your entry in campus,
I will get you finish,

180
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,760
I think you never felt in true love,

181
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,298
It is different,
Pratab! Take him out...

182
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,832
Sooner or later you will understand,

183
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,904
Just spend some quality time
with me,

184
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,274
It's enough!

185
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,378
Now watch how I will fix you.

186
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,104
You can take any action,

187
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,305
Report in police,

188
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,813
True love...

189
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,917
never afraid from the world,

190
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,683
It's not even scared from police,

191
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,988
Ghalib has also said allot,

192
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,862
I don't know at the time but
I will and tell you,

193
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,602
If you won't give me a chance then
how would you find out,

194
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,338
We must have to talk,

195
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,239
Let's talk right now,

196
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,286
What happen?
You wanted to talk to me,

197
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,085
Yes! I...
What?

198
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,855
We should give it a chance,
Let's give it a chance,

199
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,958
Give a chance,

200
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,289
What are you thinking?

201
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,433
Tell me,
I want to know how it is?

202
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,175
I was...

203
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,207
Coming!
What happen?

204
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,844
Can I talk to you for a minute?

205
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:20,475
Coming!

206
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,000
You don't have to be nervous
to see me every time,

207
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,373
I am not angry with you anymore,

208
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,418
I am really sorry,

209
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,219
I don't love you,

210
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,758
Entire campus have a rumor,

211
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,164
that Heer is so cool,
All of my friends,

212
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,029
But personally I don't think that
you are damn hot,

213
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,868
Like I said...

214
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,937
I didn't mean that you so ugly,

215
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:21,910
You are beautiful.

216
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,848
But I...
So why you following me?

217
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,088
I can't tell you it's such
a madness,

218
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,918
Everyone does madness,

219
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,924
But it will be madness for you
to bunk your class,

220
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,357
Or having some snacks,

221
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,992
You must be thinking after that...
Oh my God!

222
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,032
Today I have done crazy enough,

223
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,341
But I am not like that,

224
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,075
What do you think about me?

225
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,953
I didn't meant so wrong

226
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,118
So what you were meant to be?

227
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,096
Nice family,

228
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,104
There is a cinema theatre,

229
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,106
Amar Talkies in old Delhi,

230
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,617
A movie is showing there,

231
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,513
Junglee Jawani,

232
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,414
I am going to watch that movie,

233
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,530
Do you know what kind of movie
you are talking about?

234
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,358
I have seen the posters,

235
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,898
And you will watch that movie,

236
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,135
I have find out the way of hall.

237
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,533
I have made excuses too.

238
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,444
You can't go over there,
I am going,

239
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,978
With who?
Alone!

240
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,110
You are crazy,

241
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:23,994
Run! Run!

242
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,159
Happy!
We should stay more,

243
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,395
If light would be on so you
would be raped over there,

244
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,042
Let's do one more thing today,

245
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,239
By God!
I am scared to hear about that,

246
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,606
Can we get some local beer?

247
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,442
Are you Heer?

248
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,085
Show me your face,
I want to drink it,

249
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,422
Then who is that Stephen Heer?

250
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,650
Don't talk rubbish.
Buy me a beer,

251
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,054
How is that?
It's too bad,

252
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,268
Why you are not drinking?

253
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,669
I am drinking,
Show me,

254
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,644
It's so bitter,
How do people drink it?

255
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,650
You don't drink it,

256
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,517
I just rub some beer on my face,

257
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,581
and I act like I am drunk,

258
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,861
But you are the first person
who caught me,

259
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,223
So you can't act with me,

260
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,224
You will have to actually drink
with me,

261
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,378
I am getting married,

262
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,480
Entire university knew it,

263
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,591
Only two months are left,

264
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,491
I have heard you got a rich husband,

265
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,329
And once if I get married,

266
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,549
So you are fulfilling your bad habits
before marriage,

267
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,649
You are not that stupid like you
looks like,

268
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,415
You don't looks rascal like you are,

269
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,388
Now will you go home or you want
create more mess,

270
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,294
I want to make lot of mess,

271
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,533
I have to do amazing things,

272
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,369
But I don't have time,

273
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,471
We have tomorrow,

274
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,270
You are Genius,

275
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,342
Why did you fail in B.A.

276
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,683
It's a demand of time,
You make the list,

277
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,251
Make a list of all of your insects,

278
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,718
before marriage,

279
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,661
We will kill all of them,

280
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,825
Really?
Yes!

281
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,734
And my image is already ruined
up on your front,

282
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,804
So, I will make a list,

283
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,545
He is such a unique friend of yours,

284
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,581
You shouldn't have complain,

285
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,252
I will bring disprine in 2 minutes,

286
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,860
He is not so poor,

287
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,485
He also enjoy the life,

288
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,021
Why are you cheating?
And what about your shortcut?

289
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,035
You should have invite him in wedding,

290
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,166
He came for wedding shopping so he
will must attend the wedding,

291
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,714
Put it on to your husband,

292
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,322
Remove your hand,

293
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,388
Make it lower and show me,

294
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,262
Make it lower,

295
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,935
Fine?
Mind blowing,

296
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,665
He will be seduced from you,

297
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:46,975
Listen!
I can't come right now,

298
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,481
Khatara Bro has stopped Platinum Music
people in canteen,

299
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,853
You tell him that you didn't meet me,

300
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,550
And don't come here for few days,

301
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,483
I am going out and I have made
some excuses at home,

302
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,806
I was feeling so bore here,

303
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,406
People doesn't have anything to do
in their own wedding,

304
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,612
I have done all the arrangements,

305
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,049
I can't go like this,
I am a bride,

306
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,494
Can you come out?

307
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,560
Who can stop me?

308
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,965
Nobody knows here who actually
you are?

309
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,630
Only you know,

310
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,574
Jordan!
Can you hug me?

311
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:05,868
Now?

312
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,717
You are in hurry?
No!

313
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,585
Hug me properly,
Tight!

314
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:30,324
Is it ok?

315
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,709
I should leave now,
They must be looking for me,

316
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,363
Why you are getting so sentimental?
I am getting married,

317
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,393
If you don't like then don't
get married, So what?

318
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,032
Back door is open,
Run!

319
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:41,237
Let's go,

320
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,937
Tell me one thing,
Don't ask me anything,

321
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:47,904
Otherwise I will tell the truth,

322
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,280
So tell the truth,
Who is scared?

323
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:53,809
Yes!

324
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,087
How am I looks like?

325
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,724
College guys were right,

326
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:04,890
You are looking hot,

327
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,262
Bride is on wedding level or not,

328
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,831
Those guests came to wedding,

329
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,903
They all does bride's fantasy
at night,

330
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,973
You will also do my fantasy,

331
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,808
You are not falling in love with me,

332
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,145
When will you come to meet me?

333
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:32,983
Parag!

334
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,958
I never went to Nepal.

335
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,759
But you will have to come Parag,

336
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,128
So! I am going first,

337
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,267
then you should come,

338
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,426
We will meet in Parag and
create a mess,

339
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,898
This plan is perfect or shall
we escape now,

340
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:24,585
Tell me one thing,

341
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,717
This media is so stupid that he can
make anything news,

342
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,323
You can take anyone to sky,

343
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,253
Who is this Jordan?

344
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,157
What he has done?

345
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:38,325
He is just an artist of Platinum Music,
He is not from Platinum Music,

346
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,503
He just shared few songs in album,

347
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,035
You are making him star,

348
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,199
Believe me I am not his fan,

349
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,538
It's my job that...
But it's not my job

350
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,112
that I should make false praise
for him

351
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,419
That's why find out anything about him,

352
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,543
and print it...

353
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,216
He doesn't live here,

354
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,487
It's been 2 years but still phone
calls are coming,

355
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,059
But can I talk to his family members?

356
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,356
He have no family,

357
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,325
Please don't call here again,

358
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,423
I can't do it,

359
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,697
We need 4 of that kind for
the rising star,

360
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:15,764
every month,

361
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,441
Bury your ego being shameless

362
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:19,701
and find it and print it,

363
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,269
Actually he is not in anyone's touch,

364
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,605
What happened with J. J
after the college

365
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,075
Any lead?

366
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,493
Jordan always liked the music,

367
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,331
and I always appreciated the
artist inside him,

368
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,433
Art was deeply inside him,

369
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,466
He was notjust a good artist but
a nice person as well.

370
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,735
Kids were asking me

371
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,803
that when this show will come on TV,
It will not come on TV,

372
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,644
Why?

373
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:01,112
Because I don't have any material
about this Jordan,

374
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,245
But I have said allot,

375
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,450
But you lied everything,

376
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,082
I am asking you straight questions,

377
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,090
You knew Jordan those days,

378
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,558
Why don't you tell me about him,
You are getting angry,

379
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:15,687
No! I want to know,

380
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,633
Now no camera is here,
Tell me,

381
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,601
After all what is this Jordan?

382
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,500
Few people...

383
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,742
have their mind somewhere else.

384
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,303
Do you understand?
I don't understand,

385
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:38,081
Earlier he could give his life to meet
there peon of Platinum Music,

386
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:41,589
One day I told him by myself,

387
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,259
Musician!

388
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,820
Where are you?

389
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,099
Platinum Music people were
asking about you,

390
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,263
Dilip Menand! Remember?
I will call you later,

391
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:54,800
I will meet you tomorrow,

392
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,439
After 2 weeks Platinum Music people
came to canteen,

393
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,379
in search of him,

394
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,842
I offered them few samosa's and
kept them stopped,

395
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,650
I sent a person on my bike,

396
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,302
Why Kashmir?
I don't know,

397
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,168
But when he came back so
he has been caught.

398
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,767
Brothers beaten him up allot,
Mom started crying,

399
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,239
We work all day long and he
is playing guitar,

400
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,146
Who is this Heer?

401
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,840
What's your affair with her?
Nothing,

402
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,422
Get his guitar,
If you have nothing to do with her

403
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:47,920
then why did you attend her marriage,

404
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,493
How are you?

405
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,561
Where are you?
You quit the college.

406
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,530
And you know it's not so bad here,

407
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:03,934
A. C is here and not to do anything,

408
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,905
I have set the video game on TV,

409
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,839
There is a world inside the game,

410
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,140
But he was saying he will never
join his family business,

411
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,177
And music?
He quit.

412
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,554
Then?
Then one day same thing occurred,

413
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:25,623
Same brother, same mom and
same social drama,

414
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:27,527
Leave my collar,

415
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,757
You accept it that you steal the money
and I will leave your collar,

416
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:38,673
I said I didn't steal the money,

417
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,638
You just wanted to beat me,

418
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,540
Someone else must have stolen
the money,

419
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,843
Keys are always in drawer and
everyone knew it,

420
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,416
You ask to your staff,

421
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,864
Money has been stolen before
I joined,

422
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,533
Can I stay here for few days,

423
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,280
So did he stood at your home,

424
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,442
He still lives at my house,

425
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,652
Which night he has been removed
from his house,

426
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:32,953
He came to your house,

427
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,221
Not that night after two months,

428
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,404
Where you have been?

429
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,747
I went to house thrice,

430
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,009
They didn't take me back,

431
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:57,851
So what did you do in tomb
all these days,

432
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,517
You must have done something,

433
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,073
You are losing the tune,

434
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:39,876
Can you hear the pilot?
Yes!

435
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:11,979
Take a break,

436
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,208
Want some tea?

437
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,566
Are you playing on music or
you are screwing the music,

438
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,215
You are not listening,
I can't do it,

439
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,419
Don't know why you were searching
for me I can't sing,

440
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:00,292
It's not inside me,
You are right,

441
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,864
You were singing wrong intentionally,

442
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,191
Why would I do that?

443
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,926
Even I can understand the tune,

444
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:07,500
And you didn't understand,

445
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,476
It was a miracle.

446
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,455
I have seen you earlier,

447
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:38,431
You know where?

448
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:40,965
At Hazrat Nizamuddin's Tomb,

449
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,644
I have also seen you,

450
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,176
You came on TV.

451
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,122
He is Ustad Jameel Khan,

452
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:17,369
I know you are such a big...

453
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:24,035
But I don't understand this
classical music,

454
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,347
I feel bore.

455
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,376
Why do you play the same thing
over and over again,

456
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:33,521
Now move on and play
something new,

457
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:39,558
He is a monster,

458
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,997
He won't be locked up in
your small cage,

459
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,160
He will make his own world,

460
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:50,700
You mean this guy...
He is another thing...

461
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,005
He have a God's blessings,

462
01:01:58,648 --> 01:01:59,945
Put your money on him,

463
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:01,583
You will earn allot,

464
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:23,662
Khadala Bro told me for interview,

465
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:30,279
Tell me one thing,

466
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,204
Why dhinga have a problem with you?

467
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,278
You have some secret,

468
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:51,165
You are newly born,

469
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:55,260
From today you are my asset,

470
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,575
Now you will perform your own album,

471
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:17,190
Now you will have to learn how
to become a star,

472
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:20,560
Many people can play the music.

473
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,146
But you remember one thing,

474
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:50,120
From today you are not a musician,

475
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,856
You don't know they are going Europe,

476
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,268
Dhinga is taking 5 Indian Musicians
over there,

477
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,839
I want to make a phone call.
Sure!

478
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:03,854
Take me Europe!

479
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,667
How did you get in?
I am ready to sign your contract,

480
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:09,168
I will do whatever you will say.

481
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:15,838
You are not laughing today,

482
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:19,909
No!
Not at all...

483
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,218
I have to go.

484
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,949
Why?

485
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,258
I am ready to sign everything today.

486
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,452
Just take me along.

487
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,667
You will sign a special
contract with me,

488
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:40,926
Whatever you say?

489
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:05,818
You are taking something,

490
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,356
Why don't you buy something
for yourself?

491
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:09,892
I should like something,

492
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,458
Why don't you like something?

493
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:15,294
Come here.
Nice scarf's arrived here,

494
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:16,595
I have an appointment,

495
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,404
You really enjoy to visit the doctor,

496
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,739
Why you are going now?
Your all tests are negative,

497
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,312
You need something to do.

498
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,620
He also said the same,

499
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,490
You have nothing to do here that's
why you keep down.

500
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:44,399
I have embarrassed everyone here.
And I know it.

501
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:23,734
I am gone to Parag,

502
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,303
Let's create the mess.

503
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:39,318
I have an appointment
with psychiatrist

504
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,282
You are gone mad,
I can't come right now,

505
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,953
I have to go,
I am not feeling well.

506
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,430
But we will meet later,
tomorrow!

507
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:51,331
I will take you for lunch,
Some nice place,

508
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,698
Where do you stay?

509
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,500
When did you come?
And what are you doing here?

510
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,069
I shouldn't drink by the way,

511
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,750
When did you start drinking?
Right now,

512
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:37,436
Let's make a list,

513
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:53,553
These cheap pubs,

514
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,882
Some cheap kind of discos where
they have dirty lights,

515
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,592
Dirty people came there,

516
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:01,891
And you will dance on front
of them,

517
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:28,321
I think we should kiss now,

518
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:32,056
Really?
Why do you feel like that?

519
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,326
That's the next step.
You can watch any movie,

520
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:40,230
That's good we are discussing
about this issue,

521
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:43,301
These things are made for
discussion,

522
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:47,472
Not like you are gone emotional
and got kiss,

523
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,174
Precautions can make life easy,

524
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,308
So let's have a detail discussion,

525
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:57,775
All matter should be discuss,

526
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:01,550
So we should have a proper plan,

527
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,490
How would be the kiss?
What kind of kiss it would be?

528
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,484
If the matter won't finish on kiss,

529
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,227
If we will get more emotional so
where to stop,

530
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,399
How we will find out that point
has come,

531
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:17,900
We both are item,

532
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:20,299
If someone will hear us that
what we talk about,

533
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,135
We should stop here,

534
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,041
What are you doing?
Get off!

535
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,117
You don't know why?
Because it's wrong,

536
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,944
Then why I don't feel it wrong,

537
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,584
What do you think?

538
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,253
How could you imagine that you
can do it with me?

539
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:02,500
I really enjoyed,

540
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:07,206
It's not a joke.

541
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:15,115
I have kissed earlier,

542
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:20,958
but what's this?

543
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,003
Look! From this point

544
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:32,599
we could ruin everything,

545
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,510
and we shouldn't do it,

546
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,077
So we won't do it,

547
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:43,184
Now you drop me home and we
will never meet again,

548
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:46,242
It's too late Heer.

549
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:49,453
It's impossible.

550
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:52,692
But it will happen,

551
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:44,703
So you are friend,

552
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,143
I am sister in law,
Meena!

553
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:49,072
So dinner tomorrow,

554
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:53,077
You didn't tell him,
He is very busy,

555
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,680
But he must have meal sometimes,

556
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:58,250
Or he don't have it...

557
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,486
No! You must have to come tomorrow,

558
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,426
We all are really excited to meet you,

559
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:08,262
And we will take good care of you,

560
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,377
You are not in hurry,
No!

561
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,747
I have heard allot about you,
What?

562
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:01,787
Good things from Heer,

563
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,399
Do you know for which program
you have invited here,

564
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,534
few of my friends are involved in
it's organizing committee.

565
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,834
It would be fun but I was busy
all this month,

566
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:22,467
So I have to drop it,

567
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:26,769
And Jordan I should tell you since
you have come Parag,

568
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,405
And Heer is meeting you,

569
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,584
She is feeling very well.

570
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,548
In fact Doctor was so happy
and surprised,

571
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:38,891
You should have join this program,

572
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:52,340
I have to hug you,

573
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,202
I will wait back side,
You have lost your mind,

574
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,844
Shut up and go from here,
I will wait.

575
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,280
You don't come,

576
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:37,907
What do you want?

577
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:20,884
How is it?
I don't know,

578
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,809
You admire me,

579
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:43,843
Increase the amount 300 percent of

580
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:45,279
that contract what I have signed
with you,

581
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:48,111
Miser man like me is talking about
to increase the amount,

582
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,587
And he is really famous in India,

583
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:52,054
Many things are publishing about him,

584
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:56,020
You have kept my respect
in front of white people,

585
01:28:56,864 --> 01:28:59,196
Now perform like this in Paris
and Barcelona,

586
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:38,761
Say bye and let me go,

587
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:42,268
They are waiting for me,

588
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:44,345
It will be a problem,

589
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:47,978
Let it be,
That won't be your problem,

590
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:49,578
You are going,

591
01:29:49,984 --> 01:29:52,077
After that you don't want me to
live happy in my house,

592
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:53,582
No!

593
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,380
I don't want you to stay
happy at home,

594
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,182
You have no feelings,

595
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:02,824
What do you feel about me?

596
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:05,323
I feel that you have to stay here,

597
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,062
Now!
That's what I feel.

598
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,234
Go to hell!

599
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:12,069
You are just worried about yourself.

600
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:14,163
You want what you want,

601
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:16,367
Come here!

602
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:18,841
And you are uncivilized,

603
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:22,976
We can't live together for 6 months,
Thank God you are leaving,

604
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,347
You are forcing me to fight,

605
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:27,844
I can't tolerate you anymore,

606
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:31,287
You are forcing me to fight,
So what did you think?

607
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:33,055
We will be happily separated,

608
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:35,362
So you would meet me again and
have fun with me,

609
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:41,099
You are gone mad,
I was but now I am fine,

610
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:46,102
Come here! Say bye properly.
Get lost!

611
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:33,082
All of you...
Get off from me,

612
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:58,106
Come fast otherwise I will
have nervous breakdown,

613
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:51,821
What have you done?

614
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:56,961
Jai! He won't do anything,

615
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,554
Go! Your plan is accomplished,

616
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:17,022
Now I will never be fine
in my house,

617
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,189
I came to say bye,

618
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,389
Don't show me your face again,

619
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:23,527
I never want to see you again,

620
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:26,557
Really?

621
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:07,430
Today this media has come to cover a
criminal not an artist,

622
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:53,206
In your world...

623
01:35:55,116 --> 01:36:00,315
On every step human is wrong,

624
01:36:00,788 --> 01:36:06,021
Whatever I do to think it's right...

625
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:11,459
You says it's wrong,

626
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:14,993
I am wrong,

627
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:17,502
I just want to tell the media that
No comments,

628
01:36:17,638 --> 01:36:19,333
You call the press and says
no comments,

629
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:22,237
But isn't it true that you are
releasing Jordan's next album,

630
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:24,667
which songs he recorded in
Europe for you,

631
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,013
Album will be release in market and
artist is in jail.

632
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,425
Only Negative works in Media,

633
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:47,727
To live from my own wish

634
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:55,275
Shall I give you the application.

635
01:36:58,179 --> 01:37:06,553
It means you have right on me
more than me,

636
01:37:07,288 --> 01:37:11,657
Bring our right here...

637
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:28,373
Jordan probably can't handle
the fresh fame,

638
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:32,074
Lucknow people still don't believe
that he didn't come to show,

639
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:34,146
besides the matter is clear,

640
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:37,440
that he has been seen coming out
from the Lucknow Airport,

641
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:39,082
He lost his mind,

642
01:42:41,054 --> 01:42:42,749
Shall I put him in the jail again,

643
01:45:05,866 --> 01:45:06,833
This day has come,

644
01:45:07,567 --> 01:45:08,966
I have to take you out from
that place,

645
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:12,962
You will be over before the start,

646
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:16,234
Your reputation is getting
more worse,

647
01:45:16,643 --> 01:45:19,578
And you will never find out that when
people will start hating you,

648
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,741
What happen to you?

649
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:26,179
What are you up to?

650
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:28,982
What's your problem?

651
01:45:30,023 --> 01:45:31,354
Look at yourself,

652
01:45:32,192 --> 01:45:34,057
What do you want that people
should ran away from you,

653
01:46:28,749 --> 01:46:29,943
I shouldn't be happy,

654
01:46:31,017 --> 01:46:32,382
That's all I ever wanted,

655
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,212
But I am not happy at all.

656
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:53,126
Now you believe he is J.J.

657
01:47:56,736 --> 01:47:58,135
We must need an evidence,

658
01:48:39,846 --> 01:48:41,040
You don't want more pictures,

659
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:44,382
Have you done?

660
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:47,377
Shall I go now?

661
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:24,051
Contract of 5 albums and he
can't work outside,

662
01:49:24,424 --> 01:49:25,356
Don't you think it's enough,

663
01:49:25,825 --> 01:49:27,122
So don't sign it,

664
01:49:28,828 --> 01:49:30,989
It has decide,
Sit back home,

665
01:49:32,933 --> 01:49:34,457
Sir! You are right but...

666
01:50:32,859 --> 01:50:34,554
You have screwed up with Dhinga,

667
01:50:36,096 --> 01:50:37,154
Now what will you do?

668
01:50:39,232 --> 01:50:40,563
They want to sign you,

669
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:42,531
They will handle all of
your cases,

670
01:50:43,003 --> 01:50:45,164
Why they are talking to you?
They are scared from you,

671
01:50:45,572 --> 01:50:46,903
Your image is like that,

672
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:49,205
So they thought I am closer
to you and...

673
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:50,499
Are you?

674
01:50:51,878 --> 01:50:52,276
What?

675
01:51:32,552 --> 01:51:33,610
You can't forget her.

676
01:51:45,098 --> 01:51:46,725
He is burning inside for
someone's love.

677
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:04,181
I am not Heer,

678
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:46,810
We have to talk,

679
01:53:48,254 --> 01:53:49,516
Not in this condition,

680
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:56,560
I will never be fine,

681
01:53:58,398 --> 01:54:00,457
My condition will go more bad,

682
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:05,528
What do you want to do?

683
01:54:06,873 --> 01:54:07,862
That's what you have to say,

684
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:12,071
I betrayed you,

685
01:54:13,646 --> 01:54:15,079
I have crossed the line,

686
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:19,681
I knew that time that I am
doing wrong,

687
01:54:21,354 --> 01:54:22,548
I knew every second,

688
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:28,157
I was trying that I should stop
myself but...

689
01:54:29,596 --> 01:54:30,688
don't know why?

690
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:33,195
Don't know what happened to me,

691
01:54:35,835 --> 01:54:38,235
Now what do you feel about him,

692
01:54:43,409 --> 01:54:44,740
This feeling will be gone,

693
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:48,405
Everything will be fine
in few days,

694
01:54:49,883 --> 01:54:51,714
then we will talk after few days,

695
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:50,730
Get up!
I am feeling bore,

696
01:56:52,438 --> 01:56:53,564
how long will sleep,

697
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:24,895
Can you come for a second?

698
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:35,378
Close the door,

699
01:57:41,354 --> 01:57:42,514
What happened in night,

700
01:57:44,557 --> 01:57:47,685
After that how dare you to enter
in this house,

701
01:57:49,429 --> 01:57:50,487
You didn't ashamed,

702
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:52,693
Now only dad will talk to you,

703
01:57:56,502 --> 01:57:57,696
You won't come back here,

704
01:57:59,972 --> 01:58:03,635
Go!
I can't go,

705
01:58:06,446 --> 01:58:08,710
I know myself,
I will stay with Heer,

706
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:15,521
Heer is not in this condition that
she could tolerate more drama,

707
01:58:23,729 --> 01:58:25,697
Nothing will happen to Heer,
Don't worry,

708
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:46,411
She is already dying.

709
01:58:48,121 --> 01:58:50,146
They are going to throw me out,
but you don't worry,

710
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:51,388
I will be back,

711
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:55,590
And let's have a kiss before
they come,

712
01:59:00,133 --> 01:59:02,067
They will come.
Stop it! You stay there,

713
01:59:05,171 --> 01:59:06,866
I am kissing you,
You do whatever you want,

714
01:59:07,006 --> 01:59:08,439
Jordan! I am telling you I
will kill you,

715
01:59:09,909 --> 01:59:12,104
Have you lost your mind,
It would be done yet,

716
01:59:18,484 --> 01:59:20,645
How did you get up?

717
01:59:36,469 --> 01:59:37,959
She didn't get up from the bed
since 3 weeks,

718
01:59:38,104 --> 01:59:40,402
It's good,
But how?

719
01:59:45,411 --> 01:59:46,605
You want to talk to him,

720
01:59:47,947 --> 01:59:50,415
What should I do?
You don't want to talk?

721
01:59:55,922 --> 01:59:57,913
She don't want to talk,

722
02:00:01,127 --> 02:00:02,458
Listen!
When will you die?

723
02:00:11,204 --> 02:00:12,899
Doctor said that you are dying,

724
02:00:14,173 --> 02:00:16,971
So when will you die?
Is this a joke?

725
02:00:17,476 --> 02:00:19,671
No!
It's really serious,

726
02:00:21,214 --> 02:00:24,149
Your body is not building blood anymore,
What do you want?

727
02:00:25,084 --> 02:00:26,108
I want to ask you,

728
02:00:27,019 --> 02:00:28,919
You don't have security alarm
in this house,

729
02:00:29,989 --> 02:00:31,547
Why?
What you going to do?

730
02:00:34,493 --> 02:00:35,960
Parag house alarm was so loud,

731
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:39,598
Within a second all lights
were switched on,

732
02:00:41,567 --> 02:00:42,659
Scene was totally changed,

733
02:00:55,147 --> 02:00:56,512
You shouldn't came out,

734
02:01:00,486 --> 02:01:01,714
Now I will have to come to you,

735
02:01:07,727 --> 02:01:08,659
Don't do it,

736
02:01:10,963 --> 02:01:12,590
I can't tolerate it,

737
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:15,158
Am I doing it?

738
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:20,070
You said you don't want
to see my face,

739
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:22,132
Did I came to you?

740
02:01:24,577 --> 02:01:26,010
Did I call you in 2 years,

741
02:01:28,881 --> 02:01:31,247
I even tried that I shouldn't
think about you,

742
02:01:33,786 --> 02:01:34,309
But what happened?

743
02:01:36,155 --> 02:01:36,917
It's you...

744
02:01:38,624 --> 02:01:39,648
Standing next to me,

745
02:01:41,861 --> 02:01:42,850
Don't you understand?

746
02:01:46,265 --> 02:01:47,254
It's something else.

747
02:01:48,367 --> 02:01:49,925
What is taking us together,

748
02:01:51,904 --> 02:01:53,030
We couldn't live apart,

749
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:59,107
I am such a great personality,

750
02:01:59,879 --> 02:02:00,903
I am a star,

751
02:02:02,081 --> 02:02:04,606
I have lot of money,
I am famous,

752
02:02:05,217 --> 02:02:07,048
But I have a fire inside me,

753
02:02:12,892 --> 02:02:14,325
I am only set with you,

754
02:02:15,127 --> 02:02:16,151
and that's the matter,

755
02:02:19,765 --> 02:02:22,131
When you are not with me so you
have some deadly disease,

756
02:02:28,207 --> 02:02:29,367
I am dying,

757
02:02:31,644 --> 02:02:32,770
May be few months,

758
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:38,806
After that I will die,

759
02:02:39,819 --> 02:02:40,877
And if you didn't die then...

760
02:02:42,688 --> 02:02:43,780
Nothing will happen to you then...

761
02:02:45,758 --> 02:02:46,782
So you will be mine,

762
02:02:52,398 --> 02:02:54,127
Can you hug me?

763
02:04:00,733 --> 02:04:01,825
You are in hurry?

764
02:04:04,136 --> 02:04:06,070
Hold me tight!

765
02:05:27,353 --> 02:05:28,547
You are like Guitar,

766
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,279
You know what kind of man he is?

767
02:05:58,284 --> 02:06:01,776
2 weeks back Heer didn't have
strength to talk properly,

768
02:06:03,022 --> 02:06:05,388
After all the efforts she was sinking,

769
02:06:07,993 --> 02:06:10,325
and today she walks in the park,

770
02:06:10,796 --> 02:06:12,286
She came downstairs for breakfast,

771
02:06:18,103 --> 02:06:19,263
However it's happening?

772
02:06:20,072 --> 02:06:23,200
Do you think I will stop her,

773
02:06:25,311 --> 02:06:28,872
However she looks cheerful from outside
but she is weak from inside,

774
02:06:43,062 --> 02:06:44,927
We think we know the life,

775
02:06:45,998 --> 02:06:48,023
But life always giving us surprises,

776
02:07:05,651 --> 02:07:08,085
That's what I was thinking that
he is such a big star,

777
02:07:09,054 --> 02:07:10,043
He can't work,

778
02:07:10,923 --> 02:07:13,323
But whenever I ask him he
says he is free,

779
02:07:13,892 --> 02:07:17,453
12 recordings, 6 shows and one
product launch has cancelled,

780
02:07:18,464 --> 02:07:19,988
I have got 2 legal notices,

781
02:07:21,233 --> 02:07:22,461
I am hiding my face from everyone,

782
02:07:23,435 --> 02:07:25,494
What should I tell them that
I don't know where he is,

783
02:07:26,171 --> 02:07:27,195
Since one month...

784
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:30,540
His phone is switched off,
He is using another number,

785
02:07:31,443 --> 02:07:34,310
Where does he stay?
Either he is alive or dead,

786
02:07:38,584 --> 02:07:39,915
These foreign companies...

787
02:07:41,153 --> 02:07:43,348
they have their entire law army,

788
02:07:43,622 --> 02:07:45,647
and theirjob is to screw people
like us,

789
02:07:49,595 --> 02:07:51,392
This time you are not going to survive.

790
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,662
This time you will go to jail.

791
02:08:02,441 --> 02:08:04,432
You tell me what immediately
he have to do.

792
02:08:06,378 --> 02:08:08,107
After that he have many shows
on different places,

793
02:08:12,418 --> 02:08:14,113
Live shows ticket didn't stop.

794
02:08:16,255 --> 02:08:17,620
I am not going anywhere,

795
02:08:19,525 --> 02:08:21,925
But I am going,
I have to go,

796
02:08:23,095 --> 02:08:24,562
I want to go to cliffs,

797
02:08:25,197 --> 02:08:27,097
I want to see Himalaya again,

798
02:09:13,112 --> 02:09:14,670
You guys don't report about her,

799
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:16,340
Is she your girlfriend?

800
02:09:16,415 --> 02:09:17,780
Since when you both are together?

801
02:10:19,611 --> 02:10:21,044
Say bye and let me go,

802
02:10:24,116 --> 02:10:25,208
You won't listen to me,

803
02:10:26,285 --> 02:10:27,252
I am listening,

804
02:10:32,457 --> 02:10:33,617
You are not listening to me,

805
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:36,288
I should leave now,

806
02:10:38,597 --> 02:10:40,258
I won't have my bye,
Bye!

807
02:10:49,208 --> 02:10:51,768
Finish your shows and come to me,

808
02:12:56,568 --> 02:12:58,729
Call Jordan and tell
him to come right now.

809
02:14:19,751 --> 02:14:20,945
Everything depends on you,

810
02:14:40,939 --> 02:14:41,667
Look!

811
02:14:42,808 --> 02:14:45,072
At this time I can't come,

812
02:14:48,914 --> 02:14:51,075
Operation is under process,
Somebody is inside,

813
02:14:51,817 --> 02:14:53,546
We have our official orders,

814
02:15:00,492 --> 02:15:02,323
I don't need it all.

815
02:15:02,994 --> 02:15:04,962
I don't to be famous,

816
02:15:05,397 --> 02:15:07,024
My heart shouldn't be broken,

817
02:15:11,336 --> 02:15:12,360
Please do something,

818
02:15:13,405 --> 02:15:14,770
I have nothing else.

819
02:15:21,513 --> 02:15:22,844
It's all because of you,

820
02:15:23,915 --> 02:15:25,940
You have send her to Coma,

821
02:23:29,567 --> 02:23:30,556
Everyone is gone,

822
02:23:32,236 --> 02:23:33,362
It's our world.

823
02:23:37,575 --> 02:23:38,837
Nobody else is here,

824
02:23:41,112 --> 02:23:42,238
Not any journalist,

825
02:23:43,548 --> 02:23:44,981
Not any photographer,

826
02:23:46,017 --> 02:23:48,918
Not any society,
Not any rules.

827
02:23:53,224 --> 02:23:54,452
Not any hospital.

828
02:23:55,660 --> 02:23:56,558
Not any doctor.

829
02:23:58,997 --> 02:24:00,225
Not any contract,

830
02:24:01,199 --> 02:24:02,427
Not any court case,

831
02:24:04,535 --> 02:24:06,162
Not your marriage,

832
02:24:25,556 --> 02:24:27,387
Did you like our world.

833
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:30,657
I couldn't come outside,

834
02:24:31,963 --> 02:24:33,157
You don't have to live outside

835
02:24:35,333 --> 02:24:36,493
You have to stay here,

836
02:24:37,068 --> 02:24:37,659
Now...

837
02:24:42,006 --> 02:24:42,938
Forever!
