1
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,128
Wake up, dear.
It's morning already.

2
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:02,607
Look, how high the sun is.
And your friend Radha's here too.

3
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,621
Why did you lie to me?
Where's Radha?

4
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,823
Downstairs. Your Aunt just stopped
her for the prayers.

5
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,367
Here you are. I moved them
when I swept the room.

6
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:27,170
I don't like it!
Keep my slippers in their place!

7
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:39,182
"You're the Ocean of mercy,
and You keep us, O Lord."

8
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,456
- "I'm stupid and a lowly being."
- Hope you've counted them.

9
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,854
You're always short by one or two.
"Praise to you, O Lord."

10
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,192
Well, well! Listen to her.
Haven't you had this Puja before?

11
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,869
Am I bringing these earthen things
for the first time for you?

12
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,738
Count them. And if these are less,
then chide me all you want.

13
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,871
Quiet! You always chatter during
my prayers! Keep them inside.

14
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,954
Join us in prayers at least.
Enough of your romance now.

15
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:27,229
When my romantic husband
let's me, I will join you.

16
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:33,233
You're lucky. Your husband's too
busy for such things!

17
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,244
Shameless! Your young daughter
will learn all the wrong things!

18
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,973
Don't get angry while
singing hymns at least.

19
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,244
Sure, I'm the one who's full
of vices I suppose!

20
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,247
That side... over there...

21
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:52,722
Give me the keys, please.

22
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,522
Here you are.
- Come with me.

23
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:08,272
That's a nice dress you're wearing.
Silk, eh? How much did it cost?

24
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,940
This is Rama's actually.
- What!

25
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,943
Aren't her old clothes enough...

26
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,342
...for you to talk her into
giving you her new ones too?

27
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,949
It's not new. I've worn it.
- Don't lie! When did you wear it?

28
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,950
I said I've worn it!
It's mine to wear, or give it away.

29
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,692
What a pompous girl!

30
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,037
Give me prasad, Mom.

31
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:58,656
My God! Still angry, eh?
Did I say anything?

32
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:04,854
Did my parents comment?
My aunt is a born loud mouth!

33
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,397
I had just praised your outfit.
Didn't ask for it!

34
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:10,736
So what?

35
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,870
I'll give all my clothes to you.
How does it concern others?

36
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:18,405
Coachman! Turn back. I'll go
and talk to aunt, right now.

37
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:25,009
No, don't say anything to her.
We poor always bear the taunts.

38
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,019
Look at me at least.

39
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:40,688
Look, I apologise on her behalf.
I know you're hurt.

40
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,698
Enough. Do you want me to cry?
- No. I want you to laugh.

41
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,235
So laugh.
No? No?

42
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,515
That's better. Come, let's get
some books from the library.

43
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,713
The library hardly has any books.
But yes...

44
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:05,714
Today we'll soon find a treasure
of books. My brother Devdhar.

45
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,398
My maternal cousin. Have you
forgotten? How you pestered him!

46
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:22,071
The one who took our studies,
brought you fruit, Esp. Dates.

47
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:27,402
Yes! Has he finished studying?
- No. He's coming on vacation.

48
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,139
When is he coming?
- Today, by the afternoon train.

49
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,944
Come, let's collect him
from the station.

50
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,153
But Rama, you...

51
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,948
The goon's coming after a long time.
Let's see what he's like!

52
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,759
Let's sit here.
The train will be here soon.

53
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,767
He'll recognise you right away.
It won't be fun.

54
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,442
So you sit here.
- But how will you know him?

55
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:06,843
I'll recognise the idiot right away.
But let's see if he recognises me.

56
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,146
So you got here now!
- What?

57
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,487
Do you recognise me?
- No.

58
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:54,492
Why would you?
You've become city-bred now!

59
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,497
Who, me?

60
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,031
But Rama, this...
- Shut up!

61
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,499
Didn't I say he won't know me?

62
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,178
Coachman, keep his luggage
in the buggy. Come along Sir!

63
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,470
So! You're doing Ph.D. Eh?
Become a doctor.

64
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,542
Me? I just take orders from
the doctors for medicines.

65
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,876
What! Say that again.
- I... nothing.

66
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,895
Tell me, didn't you think
of me even once in 8 years?

67
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,094
I did.

68
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:05,169
Thought of you night and day.
- But couldn't pen me a letter, eh?

69
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,235
Give me your address and,
I'll pen you from now on.

70
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,508
Shut up!

71
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,172
Weren't you scared to face me?
We were bound to meet somewhere.

72
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,706
The world is round after all!

73
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,848
No, no.
How can the world be round?

74
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,920
Won't those at the South Pole
all fall down?

75
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,589
Coachman!
Stop the buggy.

76
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:37,435
Who are you?

77
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,599
Till now I was Fateh Chand.
But now...

78
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,142
Then why did you claim to be Devdhar.
- I didn't.

79
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,613
You didn't? Then how did you
sit in the buggy? Liar!

80
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,940
He's not lying. In fact he...
- Get out!

81
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,285
Listen, will you?

82
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:03,622
Shut up! Get down, I say!
Take your damn luggage too.

83
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,958
Get out of here, else,
I'll hit you nice and proper.

84
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,297
Why are you blaming him?
- Let go of my hand!

85
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,112
There!
- Shy fox!

86
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,315
Couldn't you tell me before?

87
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,654
You didn't give her
a chance to say a word.

88
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:29,919
You keep quiet.

89
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:36,920
Let's go, Coachman.
Come to my house. I'll show you!

90
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,335
So! This is what the bitch
is up to. Bloody whore!

91
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,680
You said you were going to the
temple. This is your temple, eh?

92
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,551
And who's this? Your God!

93
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,687
I took it as a rumour till now,
but today I caught you red handed!

94
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:11,696
You humiliate me in public?
Come home. I'll kill you!

95
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:25,969
What's this? I'm still here to
solve your problems. Tell me.

96
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:31,906
She swallowed her husband, and now,
she's flirting with this young lad.

97
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:38,448
Don't abuse your daughter so!
It's not her fault she's a widow.

98
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:43,058
It's this bastard who's at fault.
He has enticed this widow.

99
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,388
And I'll punish him for it!
- Hold it, sir!

100
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,865
Investigate before you accuse.
This is no justice.

101
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:59,742
I won't let there be injustice.

102
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:18,092
Come here, boy.
What's your name?

103
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:24,433
Do you earn a living?
- I play a musical instrument.

104
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,771
And in my spare time
I work in the fields

105
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,108
Would you wish to keep the girl?
Will you marry her?

106
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,185
I will, sir.

107
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,791
Get your daughter married to him.

108
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,463
What are you saying, sir?
People will ostracize me!

109
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:02,073
There are social rules to adhere to.
- Rules are made for the good of man.

110
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:07,802
Man isn't made for the rules.
- I didn't recognise you.

111
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,474
Do you live in this town?
- How will you recognise him?

112
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,282
Do the benevolent recognise the ones
they oblige? He's my nephew, Devdhar.

113
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:24,486
You gave money for his education.
Also, he grew up in your shadow.

114
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,833
He came just yesterday from the city.
- Sir...

115
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,573
Come and see me at my place.
I want to talk to you.

116
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,910
Of course.

117
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:44,178
Traditions are being changed.
I don't quite understand.

118
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,176
Only the big shots know what they
mean. We small fires just give in.

119
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,861
May I say something?
- What is it?

120
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:09,404
You were very keen to skin that boy
on a very petty issue.

121
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:17,746
Be truthful. You weren't eying that
young widow for yourself, were you?

122
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:25,554
It's us landlords and the rich, who
protect the social norms and laws.

123
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:31,029
And we shut the mouths of those
who dare to speak insolently!

124
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,903
That won't change your
code of conduct, will it?

125
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,432
You discard a woman like an empty
bottle after you finish with her.

126
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,911
The difference being only this.

127
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,910
You pay first for liquor,
but you pay us, later.

128
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,253
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

129
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,921
Didn't you learn to greet, Radha?

130
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,928
There...
Now see what happens.

131
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,598
Devdhar is sitting in the hall.
And what's this you're doing?

132
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:20,942
So much chilly powder?
- It'll be fun. A doctor, eh?

133
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,280
Let him guess what this
snack carries in it's belly!

134
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,950
My respects, your highness.
- Welcome, dear priest.

135
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:33,284
My greetings, Sir.
You too, sir.

136
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,959
How are you?
- Fine, by your grace.

137
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,963
You called me, and here I am.

138
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,961
What did you say your name was?

139
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:50,640
Sit down please.
Not there. Here, right near me.

140
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,309
You're a limit, Devdhar!
How did you sit here? Get up!

141
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,111
Let him sit with me for a while.
- Later. Not now.

142
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,647
I'm also waiting for him for
the past 8 years! Come on...

143
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,456
Go, son. Meet my wife and
my sis-in-law too.

144
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,994
All that later.

145
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,993
First he'll sit and chat with me!
Come on.

146
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,997
Welcome, Sir... We will now extend
our hospitality to you.

147
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,673
Piping hot snacks.
Special treat for a special person.

148
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,007
Just taste it.
You'll never ever forget it.

149
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,679
Go on, eat it.

150
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:42,024
So, you're doing Inters privately?
- Yes. Now eat.

151
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:48,026
What are your subjects?
- Do you have to know now?

152
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,636
I'm told that while eating,
one should concentrate only on food.

153
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,299
Now, eat it up!

154
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:01,035
It's smelling good...
Oh! The apple's fallen down...

155
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,048
Are you hurt?

156
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,586
I'm at my wits end, Devdhar!

157
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:17,052
Please eat now. I've made
it myself. Just for you.

158
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,062
Okay, here goes.

159
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,067
It's really very good.

160
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:35,079
Go on, start eating.
It's really very nice. You too.

161
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,082
Water?
- Here have this.

162
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:49,621
Aren't you ashamed? You feed
chilly first, and now offer water?

163
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,090
What do I do now?

164
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:57,101
I'll not survive now.
You're so cruel! A despot!

165
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,365
I'll never speak to you now.

166
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:04,976
Coming, father.

167
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,129
And you ask me about the offering?

168
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,459
Make the usual "Churma"
of wheat flour of course.

169
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,133
My respects, Aunty...
- You too.

170
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,148
Don't touch me! Can't you see
I'm wearing my Puja-sari?

171
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:47,816
You're weird aren't you?
How did you walk in? Who are you?

172
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,287
I'm Devdhar.

173
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:56,692
Maybe I never said you weren't.
But that doesn't mean you walk in!

174
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,159
Go on out now... go on.

175
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,161
This is no king's court.
Now get out.

176
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,162
What are you looking at?
Get out... out!

177
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,175
You're still here?

178
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:25,184
Watchman! Throw this man out!

179
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,061
Great! Wonderful!
How nicely you behave, Aunty!

180
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:40,201
Does one treat a guest like that?
He was our Priest's nephew, Devdhar.

181
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:45,206
What! Our priest's nephew!
- And he came here drunk?

182
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,471
Did you see him drinking?
You really talk nonsense at times.

183
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,749
He had eaten chilly powder,
that's why he had hiccups!

184
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,544
Then why didn't he say so?
Why did he go quietly?

185
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,549
You raised hell here and now
you ask why did he go quietly?

186
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:03,892
But why are you shouting?
- Then what? She didn't even think!

187
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,357
He taught us so laboriously as kids.
She just sent him packing!

188
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:12,768
Enough! Where will he go, but home?
Go and call him, if you wish.

189
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,234
I know where he must be.
I don't need you to tell me!

190
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,563
A book-mark! To remember.
Which page you were on!

191
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:48,323
I know you people are rich, but
that doesn't mean we poor are nobody.

192
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,330
No, that wasn't fun. Nobody gets
angry with me on an empty stomach.

193
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,336
You eat and then get angry.
It'll pour out better!

194
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,342
There are no chilies in this.
I swear it. Look...

195
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,415
Now eat.

196
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,365
This is great! You pester me,
and end up crying yourself!

197
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,370
What's great? You talk nonsense
and don't even let me cry.

198
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,110
What did I say?

199
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,382
Then did I talk about we rich,
and you poor?

200
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,645
Did I ask God to give me birth
in a rich man's house?

201
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,715
So that you and Radha
can taint me?

202
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,381
But I...

203
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,718
Aunty scolded you and you
flare up at me!

204
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:54,256
She only asked me to call you.
Else I wouldn't have come at all!

205
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,932
I haven't eaten since morning and
I was coaxing him to eat.

206
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,405
But he went and floored it all!

207
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,404
So now we know the truth!
It was hunger that made you cry.

208
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,414
Okay. Here, have a bite!
- No I won't! You eat if you like.

209
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,413
Else, throw this too!
- Will you eat, or do I apply force?

210
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,420
The one who can force me
isn't born as yet!

211
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:19,553
Really?

212
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,425
Okay, eat this now.
- Don't! Else... I'll bite you!

213
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,420
I'll bite, she says!

214
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,965
Go ahead.
Bite me, if you can.

215
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,452
Nothing...
Absolutely nothing...

216
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,466
"Nothing else is agreeable,
when struck by this ailment"

217
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,466
"I'm love-sick"

218
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:16,474
"I'm bitten by the love-bug.
Please give me some medicine"

219
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,485
"Go, go, go...
Fetch a doctor, someone"

220
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,483
"I'm love-sick"

221
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,556
"I wonder what this world
would've been like..."

222
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:45,564
"...had there been no love in it,
had there been no seasons..."

223
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,569
"or even gardens with flowers,
and blossoms"

224
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,577
"There would've been
something else instead..."

225
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,585
"But not this beautiful world"

226
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,593
"In these thoughts of mine,
you also merge yourselves..."

227
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,535
"Go...
Go get a doctor..."

228
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:04,643
"He is a lucky chap indeed
who is stuck by this illness"

229
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,646
"He's not bothered
about joy and sorrow."

230
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,657
"He's just happy
with his own thoughts"

231
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:19,657
"He laughs to himself,
and he cries to himself"

232
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,663
"This disease may be incurable,
but do something at least"

233
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:32,671
"So go... call a doctor.
Get me treated"

234
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,678
"If not that, then call my beloved
call my sweet-heart"

235
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,685
"For I'm bitten by the love-bug.
Get me some medicine..."

236
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:46,690
"For I'm love-sick"

237
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:52,287
This is a very serious problem.
- Why put me in suspense? Tell me.

238
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:58,756
How can I? Your Saturn is bad.
You won't see this year through.

239
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:04,760
There must be a way to avoid it.
- Of course. Why am I here for?

240
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:11,764
But it's not an easy remedy.
- Tell us. I'm willing to die for him!

241
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,777
Then that's what
you'll have to do.

242
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:20,778
Meaning I'll have to subtract some
years from your age and add to his!

243
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,110
Then do it. Why think?

244
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,985
Who's thinking?
I just wanted to ask...

245
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,317
It'll cost about 400-500 Rupees.
- What!

246
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,318
It concerns life.

247
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:38,797
True. Here, take this Rs.100 now.
The rest I'll pay later. Come, dear.

248
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:47,137
Keep this Rs.20 extra.
Since you're adding and subtracting...

249
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:52,806
...put 25 years in the account.
What'll a woman do with a long life?

250
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,813
Don't worry I'll do as you say.

251
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,814
Have your milk, will you?

252
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,832
Think hard and transfer age
from here to there.

253
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,840
You may add all my ears to him
and that Saturn will finish me off!

254
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:23,842
Take this Rs.50 and keep it.
- Don't need to tell me, Ma'am.

255
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:29,381
I'll calculate in such a way, that
he outlives you by 10-15 days!

256
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,854
What will he do with a long life,
without a wife?

257
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,190
Right!
Okay then. I'll go now.

258
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:44,868
So much of this blind-faith in
our country! Wonderful, uncle!

259
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,403
You really fooled them!
That too in the name of religion!

260
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,869
That's what is sad, nephew.
Nobody practices religion with faith.

261
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,877
Everyone practices out of fear.

262
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:02,886
Had I told him, that this year
was good for him financially...

263
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:07,217
health-wise, let alone Rs.500/-...

264
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,560
he wouldn't have parted
with a fiver even!

265
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,227
He wants to get his daughter
married, and for that we want money.

266
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:18,900
Look at this. What a fine boy.
- We won't get a prince for her...

267
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,897
We must face reality, my dear.
I've seen their horoscopes.

268
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,904
She'll be pretty comfortably off
and be very happy.

269
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,910
But uncle,
he seems much older.

270
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,912
And he lost his wife
a few months ago too!

271
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,916
There was nobody else but him
for my dainty, pretty girl!

272
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,924
Were you talking about me?

273
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,200
This guy's bald!

274
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,939
Devdhar! Come son.
- My respects, Aunty.

275
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,935
Why did you run off yesterday?
Should've told me who you were.

276
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:06,946
I told you, but...
- But you didn't recognise me!

277
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,219
If you say so!
- Bless you.

278
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,951
Yes?
- Look who's here.

279
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,955
He was so small and always wore
a long shirt, over a torn knickers.

280
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,296
Sniffed too!

281
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:28,970
Our priest's sister's son.
He was orphaned when very small.

282
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,966
And my husband sent him
to the city, educated him...

283
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,239
Enough now. Want to tell
the old story in a new way eh?

284
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,982
My respects.
- Bless you.

285
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,980
Give me that.

286
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,987
What happened to your hand?
- Well, you see...

287
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,994
A cat bit it!

288
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,002
My God! Then you must have those
14 injections in your stomach!

289
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:03,330
Those are meant for a dog-bite.
- I know.

290
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,675
But there must be some
for a cat-bite too!

291
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,008
So you think I'm a cat, eh?
- I didn't mean you.

292
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:17,013
A grown girl! Aren't you ashamed?
- Isn't he ashamed?

293
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,019
He's not really hurt.
He has tied it up for a lark.

294
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,015
Let's have a look.
He's so good at excuses!

295
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:39,035
Stupid! Heat the black balm, son,
and apply it. It'll heal the wound.

296
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,040
It's alright.
- Come, I'll apply it for you.

297
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,044
When will she get some sense?
What if it would've turned septic?

298
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:17,208
Since it's a wound, it'll hurt.
Why yell so much?

299
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,878
I didn't mean to bite so hard.
But why did you challenge me?

300
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,755
That's what made me so angry!

301
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,899
Why are you staring at me now?
Say something.

302
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:43,974
Like what?

303
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,638
If you wish to scold me, do so.
I'll listen.

304
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,909
I can't even think of it.

305
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,913
Then what were you thinking about
for so long now?

306
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:06,059
I was thinking, that all men
are alike. 2 hands, and feet...

307
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:10,923
eyes, ears and face too,
are common to all.

308
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:16,131
Then why does just one person,
becomes so very dear...

309
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,677
that even if one has to die
for him, one does it happily.

310
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:29,543
Does it really happen, Dev?
- Yes, it really does.

311
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,426
You mean one day I too will
fall in love with somebody?

312
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:46,162
Of course, who has escaped from it?
Neither the Maker, nor Man.

313
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:54,842
It's Nature's gift to us, which
gives Man a reason to live.

314
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,149
So! You came now, eh?
I've been waiting for ages...

315
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,356
And His Lordship,
takes his own sweet time!

316
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,224
Will you just stand up there,
or, come down here?

317
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,230
What does he think he is!

318
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,508
Why are you so angry?
I just got your message.

319
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,040
I didn't sleep a wink last night,
plus this tension. Won't I be angry?

320
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:12,249
But what's the reason?
- What you said yesterday, what else?

321
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,655
What did I say?
- That I'll fall in love one day.

322
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,257
Thought I'll ask you once,
and feel relieved.

323
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:34,272
Have you ever loved anyone?
- Yes. I did, I do, and I will.

324
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:39,275
I asked for an answer, and you
gave me a lecture! I just want to...

325
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,283
Listen, look the other way...

326
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,153
Why?
- Just do as I ask.

327
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,152
Turn your face the other way.

328
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,291
But what difference...
- Please?

329
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,292
I'm too shy to say
what I want to.

330
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:22,317
"Why does the day dawn?
Why does the night fall?"

331
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:37,332
"Where does this suffering stem from?
And why do these eyes cry?"

332
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:50,348
"What is this thing called love.
Please tell me..."

333
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:05,365
"Who started it...
Let's hear it from you"

334
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:47,407
"A black wasp was buzzing around
a flower till the evening"

335
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:53,410
"When the night fell,
it was shut in the petals"

336
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:00,416
"When it escaped from captivity,
I asked him what happened..."

337
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,730
"It didn't say anything"

338
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,431
"He didn't utter a word, but he
just sang in his own way..."

339
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:21,436
"what is this thing called love?
Please tell me"

340
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,110
"Who started it?
Let us know too"

341
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:33,446
"What is this thing called love?"

342
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:18,831
"Why is this body on fire?
Why is the breath so hot?"

343
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:23,500
"What kind of a fire is this?
Why does this flame melt?"

344
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:44,521
"As the flame burnt brightly
the moth was excited..."

345
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,797
"He wrapped himself
with that fiery body..."

346
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:55,538
"When asked what was so exciting
about somebody else's heat..."

347
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,801
"He didn't say anything"

348
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:04,537
"He didn't utter a word, but
just went on singing to himself..."

349
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:10,543
"What is this thing called love?
Please tell me..."

350
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:16,557
"Who started it?
Let us know too"

351
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,561
"What is this thing called love?"

352
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:09,608
"How does one get intoxicated?
How do steps falter?"

353
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:20,614
"Why isn't one aware of anything?
What kind of a 'high' is this?"

354
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:26,624
"One day, as I was passing
a liquor-house..."

355
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:32,632
"I saw a drunkard go by
with a bottle in his hand"

356
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:39,632
"When asked why he had been
drinking all his life..."

357
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,652
"He didn't say anything..."

358
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:53,178
"He didn't utter a word,
but went on singing to himself"

359
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:59,652
"What is this thing called love?
Please tell me"

360
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:05,658
"Who started it"
Let's hear it too"

361
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,663
"What is this thing called love?
Please tell me"

362
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:17,673
"Who started it...
Let's bear it too"

363
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,684
"What is love?"

364
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:33,963
Help!

365
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,691
Let me go!

366
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,577
Sit down.
- What?

367
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:53,839
I said, sit down!

368
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:02,014
Look, I don't beat around the bush.
So I'll come straight to the point.

369
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,729
Will you come and meet me
at our lakeside house?

370
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:06,927
Why?

371
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:12,735
Don't you know why a girl
is called to that house?

372
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,732
If somebody says this to Manorama,
what will you do?

373
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:18,600
Shoot him!

374
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:27,272
But knowing that she's from a high
class family, nobody will dare it.

375
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,748
So, because I'm a priest's daughter,
you can say this to me?

376
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,287
True.

377
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:40,758
Do I seem like an item for sale
for you to make a deal like this?

378
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:45,765
I accept the proposal, say'Yes',
- What are you saying, dear?

379
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:50,773
Today I realised why a young girl
is a cause of worry to her parents.

380
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,770
I like the man.
Get me married to him.

381
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:54,974
No!

382
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:04,450
You'll wed a much older man?
- No prince will wed me either.

383
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:09,257
I'm a poor priest's daughter, and
it's you who has forgotten...

384
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,792
that you too are an orphaned boy,
brought up by him.

385
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,800
What do you mean by that?
Be clear.

386
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:29,811
Nothing.

387
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,817
Just be aware of her status,
and your own, Dev.

388
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:38,816
Also, the society we live in
considers love a dirty disease.

389
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:43,818
It's their dirty thoughts that
spread hate instead of love.

390
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,822
Who give birth to
'high and low' class.

391
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,827
Love is that disease
which just happens.

392
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,827
And once it happens,
it cannot be cured.

393
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:59,364
She's obliging you by being so free
with you. Don't think it's love.

394
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,846
Else, you'll have no choice
but to repent.

395
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:12,849
That's not so. I'm very sure
she loves me as much as I love her.

396
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:26,862
Do all girls get married?
- Yes.

397
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,441
Forgive me if I've hurt you.

398
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,905
But I'll definitely say one thing.

399
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,911
Learn a lesson from me.
We marry in our own social level.

400
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:21,914
Don't you worry. I'll go and
talk to her uncle tomorrow morning.

401
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:42,935
There's no need for me to talk about
the girl. See for yourself how...

402
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,205
Where's Manorama?
Call her Munimji. Now!

403
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,950
If you'd call him in here,
I'd see how he is too.

404
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,952
Of course. I'll call him now.
- Come, I'll take you.

405
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:04,957
I've also heard a lot about him.
- One shouldn't believe in hearsay...

406
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:09,830
One should believe what one sees.
But yes, I'll say this much...

407
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:13,640
it'll be a very lucky girl
who marries this noble man.

408
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,041
Of course.

409
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,078
Please come here.

410
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:24,312
Come! Our would-be brother-in-law
is coming inside. Take a look.

411
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,989
Hope your journey was comfortable?

412
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:37,528
This is Rama's Aunt, and
this is Rama's mother.

413
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,002
Bless you, son.

414
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:52,010
You have your horoscope?
- My sis-in-law has it.

415
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,015
Right.

416
00:50:55,919 --> 00:51:00,720
All men are made alike. Then why
does just one person... just one...

417
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:06,284
becomes so dear, that even if
one has to die for him...

418
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,032
...one dies most gladly.

419
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,769
Greetings Ma'am.

420
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:17,434
You've come now?
- Yes.

421
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:22,570
See this horoscope and tell us
how well he suits our Rama.

422
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,042
He must be suiting her very well
since you've all approved him!

423
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,579
If I get her horoscope,
I will match and see.

424
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:34,052
I'll...
- Wait!

425
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,055
Please come with me.

426
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,321
Come inside.
Please.

427
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,070
Sit down.

428
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:04,083
Now make a horoscope.
- What? But the horos...

429
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:07,914
You don't have to match one,
but make one.

430
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:13,256
What do you mean?
How is it possible, sir?

431
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:18,423
After all customs do...
- Don't teach me all that!

432
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:23,762
I'll not let such a ideal proposal
slip away for your principles, okay?

433
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:33,448
Take this, and make
a horoscope for Rama...

434
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:38,417
which suits the boy's
horoscope perfectly.

435
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:43,648
When they get it tallied,
their priest should say...

436
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:48,059
"Wonderful! How perfect!
Made for each other!

437
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:57,195
Come, come! Don't bother
with that, just come on in.

438
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:07,978
You've come at the right moment.
- Respects, sir.

439
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:11,880
He's my priest's nephew.
Studies in the city.

440
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:15,319
And this is Virendra Pratap Singh,
the king of Sunehrganj.

441
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,827
And his younger brother,
Prince Narendra Pratap Singh.

442
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:27,236
Devdhar, I'm really happy today.
When Rama was born...

443
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:31,806
I had decided even then,
that she'd wed into a higher family.

444
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:40,173
Today my wish may come true.
The prince has come to approve her.

445
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:51,689
Very glad to meet you. Sit.
- Later. First go and see Rama.

446
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,953
Bring her here with you.

447
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:57,756
Yes, Sir.
- A fine boy.

448
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,527
Rama, you're looking lovely!
Now come on!

449
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,838
Greetings, Ma'am.

450
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:12,881
Where were you?
I was waiting for you. He...

451
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:16,883
He's here, you know.
Sitting with my uncle.

452
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,352
Go and meet him. Go on
- That's where I'm coming from.

453
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,894
You mean you saw him?
How did you like him?

454
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:30,555
I liked him very much.
He's a richie rich, Dev.

455
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,463
His father was a rich landlord.
They mills, factories, mansions...

456
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,570
and lots of cars too.

457
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:44,404
See? That day you said something,
and today it's proved to be true.

458
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:47,510
What?
- Didn't you say...

459
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:50,242
that all men are made alike.

460
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,654
But one becomes so dear
to one's heart that...

461
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:59,260
Well, I saw him, and I said,
"It's him".

462
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,928
Congratulations, Rama.

463
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:09,270
Hurry up! They're waiting.
- Oh God!

464
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:14,272
You're so nice. Do me a favour.
Please take the tea downstairs for me.

465
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,612
Come along Rama.
They're waiting for you downstairs.

466
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:46,598
Vir Singh, won't you show
the king our gardens?

467
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,309
Come, Sire.
- Come, my dear.

468
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:02,648
Please sit down, sire.
Come with me, Devdhar.

469
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:47,625
Is tea made like this here?
- Not really. I'll make you another.

470
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,966
My aunt says if one takes black
tea, one's skin gets darker.

471
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:58,044
I'm dark anyway.
But since you're so fair-skinned...

472
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,375
you mustn't be drinking tea at all.

473
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,050
Are you pulling my leg,
or do you really mean it?

474
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,822
I really mean it.
- Then. That's fine.

475
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:11,050
Please hurry up with your
questions. Then I'll go.

476
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:13,992
I don't want to ask anything.

477
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:20,592
Hey, listen, will you?
- Let her go. She's feeling shy.

478
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,407
You only tell me something
about her then.

479
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,410
Me?

480
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,911
You must be knowing her well.
Isn't it so?

481
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:39,677
I hardly got a chance
to do that. But yes...

482
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:44,623
I can say that she's very innocent.
She's a very nice girl.

483
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:47,920
As pure as a dew-drop.
Clean, and delicate.

484
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:56,261
Her bare feet have never touched
the floor. Cherish her, please.

485
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,098
That's my humble request to you.

486
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,119
Okay Mom, we're going for
an evening walk.

487
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,288
Do what you like.
Why ask me?

488
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:26,999
I'm not asking, but telling!

489
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:42,484
Why are you shy?
Come on... Wow!

490
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,681
See, Mom?
A film star.

491
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:53,927
O Lord! The father recites Vedas
and she dresses up like this!

492
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:59,994
You still have some time, so go to
the Mansion and pay your respects.

493
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,505
To the Mansion.

494
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:22,046
My respects, Sir. I'm going back,
so I thought I'd seek your blessings.

495
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:29,528
Sir, you're still angry with me.
I did apologise that day itself.

496
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,025
It's nothing like that.

497
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,864
When are you going?
- This afternoon.

498
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,698
My brother's upstairs
Go and meet him.

499
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:25,052
I'm leaving, Monorama.
- So go. Who's stopping you?

500
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:30,248
What is it? Are you angry?
- Who am I to get angry?

501
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:35,093
You care only for Radha. And now
that she's gone, why care about me?

502
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:40,425
Big deal! Why are you standing?
Why don't you leave?

503
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,938
What's the matter?
Why are you at swords with him?

504
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:50,101
Look at him with his luggage!
He could attend Radha's wedding...

505
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,942
He had no work then. But now, he's
very busy when I'm getting married!

506
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:59,120
Tell him to go, else he'll miss his
train. And let me tell you now...

507
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:03,952
I'm not getting married!
And that ends the matter.

508
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:10,257
Very stubborn girl indeed!
If you can stay, then do so.

509
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:14,961
There are many odd jobs to do
at a wedding. You can help too.

510
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:19,138
Well... Okay, Sir.
- There! He's staying back.

511
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:24,312
Now swallow your anger!
Makes much ado over nothing!

512
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,158
I was leaving because, finally,
I wasn't feeling too happy here.

513
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,335
Because Radha left, isn't it?
But I'm here to entertain you.

514
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,836
It's just for 7 days. You can go,
when I'll leave.

515
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:53,669
If you say so!

516
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:58,174
You're so nice!
No wonder I love you so!

517
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:53,725
"You're not to come again
in these lanes and this citadel"

518
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:05,069
"Because I'm going away now,
and there's nobody here for you"

519
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:19,087
"Take colourful memories with you
and also the sorrow and mirth"

520
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:24,388
"Because now I'm going away
and there's nobody here for you"

521
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:50,047
"My arms are full of bangles,
and the green ones suit me well"

522
01:03:55,331 --> 01:04:00,291
"Your bangles, and mine meet,
they're like friends now"

523
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:08,410
"Your henna has brought colour..."

524
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:15,373
"Which you applied on my palms
so beautifully"

525
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:23,982
"But why these tears in your eyes?
You too will get married one day"

526
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:33,135
"Tell the clouds in the rainy season
that I live elsewhere now"

527
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:40,432
"Because I'll be going away now,
and there's nobody here for you"

528
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:31,557
"O, Mother, come and hug me.
Because I'm going to my in-laws now"

529
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,160
"I'll be leaving my childhood
in your courtyard and leaving"

530
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:57,008
"Tomorrow the sun will rise,
and the birds will sing too"

531
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:02,252
"You'll see everything else,
but you won't see me"

532
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:08,258
"Wrap me in your sari-end..."

533
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:16,193
"Because I'm going away now.
And you won't have anybody here"

534
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:54,535
"But don't you forget me
though I'm going for from you"

535
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,719
"Keep my impish image
in your eyes, friend"

536
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:13,985
"When you hear the music,
and get an empty feeling..."

537
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:20,224
"Then think that I'm being taken away
in my flower-decked palanquin"

538
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:30,676
"She had danced for a while,
used to laugh and sing too"

539
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:35,683
"For I'm going away now,
and there's nobody here for you"

540
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:44,520
"These lanes and this mansion...
Don't you come here again"

541
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:54,703
"For I'll be going away soon.
And you don't have anybody here"

542
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:28,736
His father couldn't kill a fly...
and he's out hunting!

543
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:33,603
But where's my wife?
- In hell.

544
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,740
Must be in some corner. Go find her.

545
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:53,490
Sweetmeat... flowers.

546
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:59,966
Why are you so sad?

547
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:03,365
Rama's getting married.
I want to go.

548
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:07,702
Go? But I'll be very unhappy.

549
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:12,870
I won't go alone. You'll come too!
- I'll have to go too?

550
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,781
Really? Okay.

551
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:27,122
5 minutes.
- Only 5 minutes?

552
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:30,732
I get it!

553
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:50,741
Heavens! He's gulping the entire
milk again! Just like his father!

554
01:09:56,192 --> 01:10:00,652
You, Radha? You've come now?
I wrote so many letters to you!

555
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:05,162
Take it easy... I'll be a mom soon.
- Really? Come with me.

556
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:15,733
How's life with the 'Baldy'?
- He takes me to the movies...

557
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:22,180
dines me and in the evenings
we go for walks...

558
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:27,186
My word is his command!
But yes he does trouble me at night.

559
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:29,722
Trouble you?
In what way?

560
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:33,528
When your Prince will do the same
to you, you'll know what I mean.

561
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:39,866
Explain. What does he do?
- What all men do!

562
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,534
What do they do?

563
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:48,208
He's a mouse during the day,
but a night, he becomes a tiger!

564
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:53,709
He gulps a liter of milk, and
then makes trouble for me!

565
01:10:54,083 --> 01:11:00,044
This milk is a curse to us girls.
- I'm really getting nervous.

566
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:04,882
What does he do then?
- Throws me on the bed!

567
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,152
Then?

568
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,232
Then he whispers sweet nothings
and seduces.

569
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:11,055
Then?

570
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,235
Runs his fingers
through my hair...

571
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:16,732
Then?
- Then he kisses me!

572
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:20,898
Then?
- Then this! One gets pregnant!

573
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:26,870
O God! I just won't allow him
to drink milk!

574
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,291
"Straight from his heart,
I came to this"

575
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:35,141
"But my trouble is...
that I bought trouble here"

576
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:52,323
"Those who one meets often,
make a home in one's heart"

577
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:04,935
"But the one's who're near, yet
so far, are remembered the most"

578
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:17,992
"Was it love..."

579
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:30,928
"Was it love, or was it
something else?"

580
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:44,975
"Neither you know, nor I.
Whether it was love..."

581
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:59,790
"Was it an error of the eyes?
Not your fault, nor mine"

582
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,680
"Was it love, or something else?"

583
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:46,036
"May yours be the bed of roses,
And may you have a long life"

584
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:03,097
"I was busy blessing you..."

585
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,732
"But neither you knew it, nor l"

586
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:16,578
"Was it love, or something else?"

587
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:25,979
"Neither you knew, nor l"

588
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:35,494
"Was it our error of the eyes..."

589
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:44,995
"But it's neither your fault,
nor mine"

590
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,176
"Was it love, or something else?"

591
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:15,089
"By wishing you all the joys
I'm going a defeated man"

592
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:30,601
"Was this an illusion?
But neither you know it, nor l"

593
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:39,276
"Was it love, or something else?"

594
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:19,950
I always thought it'll be a lucky
girl who'll wed my brother-in-law.

595
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:24,925
But after seeing you,
I now know it's he who's lucky.

596
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,000
Flatter her now!
And then repent at leisure!

597
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,341
Don't try to talk me out of it!

598
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:37,003
First give me my present,
and then step in here!

599
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:39,880
I'll take bangles studded
with gems... this thick!

600
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:45,075
Dear sis-in-law, you're a nut! Of
all the things you asked for that?

601
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:49,354
Had you asked for something even
more precious, you'd have got it!

602
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,583
But never mind.
Ask for it now.

603
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:58,188
No, I won't ask anything from you
I'll ask from Him, who blesses all.

604
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,704
May you have a long life.

605
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:09,578
Come inside, why stand outside?
And remember, brother-in-law...

606
01:19:09,613 --> 01:19:13,241
She has to go back to her father
tomorrow, so let her have some sleep.

607
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:20,977
Also, I've kept some milk there.
Drink it before it gets cold.

608
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,095
What's the matter?

609
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:38,735
Will you really drink that milk?
- You had said tea darkness the skin.

610
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:40,373
Does milk also do something?

611
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:47,075
I'm not an idiot. I know everything.
You'll drink milk and then pester me.

612
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:52,753
Who told you I'll pester you?
- My friend Radha told me.

613
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:55,750
Her 'Badly' drinks milks, and
then pesters her like mad!

614
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,422
But I'm not bald. Look!

615
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:04,423
Enough! Don't make excuses.
Promise you won't take the milk.

616
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:09,029
And that you won't pester me too!
- Okay, I won't do that either.

617
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:12,431
Not like this.
Touch me and then promise.

618
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:19,240
I vow for your sake, but, I was
scared to touch you actually.

619
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:23,573
Because I may soil you.
It'll be my loss, not yours.

620
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:26,282
Meaning?

621
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:31,115
You won't understand.
Now rest. You must be tried.

622
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,588
Don't you trust me?

623
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:57,150
I can't believe my own luck.
Do I deserve a nice wife like you?

624
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:00,816
So sweet, beautiful and innocent.

625
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:07,953
I must've done something good.
Isn't it?

626
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:48,359
I've brought you some tea.
I'll take it back if you say so.

627
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:58,204
Bless you. Looks as though
you both stayed up all night.

628
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:03,951
Hope he didn't pester you too much.
- I slept off the moment I got here.

629
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:09,282
If he pestered me while I slept,
I wouldn't know.

630
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:11,823
What!

631
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:15,221
What could I do?
She made me take a vow.

632
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:18,226
And didn't you yourself say
she was a delicate doll?

633
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:23,496
Had a piece of her come off
I'd have been in trouble!

634
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:29,176
You are great! You should've been
born in the age of the saints!

635
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:33,144
Why make a noise about it? We
have a lifetime ahead after all.

636
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:39,209
True, but now, her brother's
downstairs to take her.

637
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:44,320
Have your tea and get ready.
I'll set the breakfast.

638
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,592
Why did you tell her
about the vow?

639
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:55,595
Don't make me vow the next time
and I won't tell her.

640
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,271
Angry?
- Then what?

641
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:07,137
I'm coming the day after
to collect you. Okay?

642
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:24,221
Easy does it.
I'm pregnant too now.

643
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:25,431
What!

644
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:30,560
I wanted to ask Dev what
to name the child.

645
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:33,304
He's gone back.

646
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,805
But what nonsense are you talking?
You got married just yesterday...

647
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,980
and how come you're
pregnant today?

648
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:42,645
Brother-in-law...

649
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,250
The fact is I don't want to go.

650
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:52,116
Who'll leave such a beautiful
sis-in-law behind?

651
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:53,225
Really?

652
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:56,795
My brother beat me to it,
else I was going to marry you.

653
01:23:57,065 --> 01:24:01,331
When I came here as a bride,
you couldn't tie your pyjamas!

654
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:05,662
Can I now?
- What! Rascal! You tease me?

655
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:57,108
It's been 13 days now.
They haven't bothered to enquire.

656
01:25:57,285 --> 01:26:02,348
Could've sent a message at least.
- Those who've lost their dear son...

657
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:07,961
must be cursing their luck, and
rue the day they approved the girl!

658
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:12,857
Do you have any sense, or not?
Couldn't you come and cut her hair?

659
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:15,269
I won't have my hair cut.

660
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:20,401
You'll have to have them cut, dear.
- But why?

661
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:22,743
Why aren't you coming down?

662
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:33,476
You can't wear these now, dear.

663
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:42,051
Where were you?
Why take so long to come down?

664
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:49,834
Mom! I won't let them
cut my hair... I won't!

665
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:56,477
Won't cut my hair indeed!
Want to dress up as a bride then?

666
01:26:56,811 --> 01:27:01,771
Were all these widows fools
to have had their heads shaven?

667
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,517
Did I become a widow on purpose?
- Listen to her!

668
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:09,186
What will happen if
she has it shaved later?

669
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:10,324
You may not know it.

670
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:14,853
But when something does happen,
you'll have to hide your faces!

671
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,497
We have to follow our
family customs.

672
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:21,190
What nonsense you talk!
The times have changed.

673
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:24,860
What calamity will befall us
if she doesn't shave her head?

674
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:29,467
No calamity befell us when
your mother had her head shaved!

675
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:34,737
Why didn't you oppose then?
- That was different. She was older.

676
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:35,711
And it's not necessary that we
keep on repeating our mistakes.

677
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,356
If you don't follow the customs,
you'll be an outcast!

678
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:43,613
I don't care!

679
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:48,319
Rama's hair will not be cut!
- Okay, if that's how you feel...

680
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:50,555
why did you call us here?
To listen to your lecture?

681
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,562
Do what you like! Let's go.

682
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,565
Wasted your time too!
- No...

683
01:27:56,804 --> 01:28:01,241
Don't do this. Please sit.
I apologise on their behalf.

684
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:04,604
And it'll be done as you say.
Please sit down.

685
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:13,250
Let's see who stops this ritual!
When they all ostracize us...

686
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:17,987
what about our next generation?
Nobody will wed them!

687
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,758
Will you go and sit quietly,
there, or do I drag you?

688
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:25,160
What are you staring at, woman?
Make her sit there.

689
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:39,936
Now what's wrong with you?
What difference does it make to you?

690
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:42,816
Uncle, please...

691
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:18,280
Wait!

692
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:26,985
Oh God! What's all this?
What are you doing?

693
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,831
Such beautiful hair!
How can you cut it?

694
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:37,664
Hey, your ladyship.
What nonsense you talk!

695
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:42,671
She's right. This lovely hair
will cause trouble later.

696
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:45,479
I don't believe in all this.

697
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:51,846
Don't feel bad, but Rama,
is not your daughter now.

698
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:57,889
She's our daughter-in-law!
The day she took her marriage vows...

699
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:02,519
this house became alien to her.
Whatever's to be done, I'll do it!

700
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:07,197
I've come to take her. Goodbye.
- To hell with these present times.

701
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:11,998
Reap as you sow!

702
01:30:21,747 --> 01:30:28,380
Come and eat something, dear.
Don't stand and stare! Bring it in.

703
01:30:28,754 --> 01:30:32,554
You've taken your time as it is!
Hurry up with your milk, son.

704
01:30:32,758 --> 01:30:37,127
Else your aunty will get angry.
Won't you? Drink it up.

705
01:30:37,496 --> 01:30:43,059
What will be the menu today?
- I don't know. Ask her.

706
01:30:46,205 --> 01:30:50,403
But, I don't know anything.
- Then learn.

707
01:30:55,848 --> 01:31:00,410
I've done my bit till now.
Now you take over and I'll retire.

708
01:31:02,354 --> 01:31:07,417
Here are the keys, of all
the cupboards, and the safe.

709
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:11,921
The rest of the work
Phuloo will explain to you.

710
01:31:26,311 --> 01:31:31,442
No, don't cry my dear.
- No... I can't manage this.

711
01:31:40,726 --> 01:31:46,460
Let me exist in some corner.
Don't worry about me.

712
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:52,467
I'm not doing anything.
I can't!

713
01:31:54,273 --> 01:32:00,234
But yes, I'll say this much. This
is your home. You're its mistress.

714
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:05,549
You'll rule the roost.
But take a hold an yourself, Rama.

715
01:32:05,918 --> 01:32:10,321
You have your whole life before you.
And you have to live it.

716
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:17,424
Take a hold on yourself.
Control yourself, my dear.

717
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:52,580
You cheat, eh? I'll show you.
Where will you run? Got you!

718
01:34:54,353 --> 01:34:58,585
I don't like going to these functions,
but we're so close to them...

719
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:04,251
I've no choice but to attend.
My husband's not here either...

720
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:08,933
else I'd have served him food
and gone. I'll do it, don't worry.

721
01:35:09,134 --> 01:35:14,470
Don't trouble your Aunty now.
- In fact, I take care of her.

722
01:35:14,673 --> 01:35:19,610
When there's nobody in the house,
I'm the only male member here.

723
01:35:19,878 --> 01:35:22,847
You jabber too much!
Okay then, I'll go now.

724
01:35:36,128 --> 01:35:40,758
I'm scared, Aunty. You sleep here
and don't leave me alone.

725
01:35:42,901 --> 01:35:47,531
Princes don't get scared.
But come...

726
01:36:19,104 --> 01:36:21,231
My dear queen...
- You?

727
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:26,067
Yes, Guddu was feeling scared
so I slept with him here.

728
01:36:26,278 --> 01:36:29,145
I thought it was my wife.
- Never mind. She has gone out...

729
01:36:29,348 --> 01:36:34,012
and she'll come late.
Shall I serve you your dinner?

730
01:36:35,187 --> 01:36:36,484
No. You better go now.

731
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:40,542
Do you want something?
- No no. I just came to say...

732
01:38:40,812 --> 01:38:46,773
So what if Narendra is dead?
I'm still alive. His elder brother.

733
01:38:52,591 --> 01:38:55,560
Please don't worry about anything.

734
01:39:00,098 --> 01:39:04,728
You have lovely hair...
And you're lovelier too.

735
01:39:10,275 --> 01:39:13,073
Please let go of my hair.
It's hurting me.

736
01:39:13,345 --> 01:39:17,748
Let it hurt a little now,
and you'll be happy forever!

737
01:39:19,117 --> 01:39:24,077
Don't worry. Nobody will say a word.
Narendra was my younger brother.

738
01:39:24,289 --> 01:39:28,248
What's the difference between us?
You can look upon me as a husband.

739
01:39:28,527 --> 01:39:32,827
Yes! It's a practiced custom too.
Come...

740
01:39:33,098 --> 01:39:34,065
Guddu! Guddu!

741
01:39:36,368 --> 01:39:39,098
Aunty! Where are you?

742
01:39:57,656 --> 01:39:59,624
Aunty! Open the door!

743
01:40:04,496 --> 01:40:05,963
Open the door, Aunty.

744
01:40:15,874 --> 01:40:16,636
No! No!

745
01:41:14,499 --> 01:41:17,024
Aunty, why don't you answer me?

746
01:41:56,174 --> 01:42:00,133
Mother...
it's Aunty...

747
01:42:06,451 --> 01:42:10,148
What had happened to you?
Why were you screaming?

748
01:42:12,057 --> 01:42:18,018
Mom, see what's wrong with her.
She was screaming loudly.

749
01:42:23,334 --> 01:42:25,097
I want to go back home.

750
01:42:29,474 --> 01:42:34,434
Yes. I made a great mistake
in bringing you here.

751
01:42:36,648 --> 01:42:40,607
We woman are always told,
that a husband is God!

752
01:42:40,819 --> 01:42:45,449
Even if he treats his wife
as a door mat, or property!

753
01:42:46,324 --> 01:42:51,227
If I say a word against my husband
my tongue will fall off!

754
01:42:51,596 --> 01:42:52,460
But I'll say one thing...

755
01:42:56,501 --> 01:43:01,302
that within these high castings
and marble walls...

756
01:43:01,506 --> 01:43:02,473
is a state of rot!

757
01:43:06,111 --> 01:43:08,807
It's suffocating in here!

758
01:43:10,715 --> 01:43:17,484
But I've to lie here and die too!
I don't have the guts to leave...

759
01:43:17,689 --> 01:43:22,319
nor any place to go to!

760
01:43:24,963 --> 01:43:31,835
But you still have a home,
you can go to, at anytime you like.

761
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:37,433
So go! Go back to your parents.

762
01:43:38,943 --> 01:43:40,240
Go! Go back, I say!

763
01:43:47,418 --> 01:43:51,115
Who has come?
- It's Rama, Sir.

764
01:44:02,233 --> 01:44:09,196
Mom... I won't go back there again.
- Why not? You went pretty haughtily.

765
01:44:10,542 --> 01:44:15,536
What happened now?
And what about your sis-in-law?

766
01:44:15,747 --> 01:44:18,079
Doesn't she have the etiquettes
to leave you here herself?

767
01:44:18,316 --> 01:44:20,546
She sends you with servants?
- What nonsense!

768
01:44:20,985 --> 01:44:22,213
Does one talk to one's daughter.
Who has come home like this?

769
01:44:22,387 --> 01:44:23,752
Then?

770
01:44:24,122 --> 01:44:27,421
It's easy to say, but it's difficult
to take care of a widow.

771
01:44:27,692 --> 01:44:30,718
Returned you like a counterfeit
coin in a few days, didn't she?

772
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:34,396
Where are you going that side?
- Upstairs to her room of course.

773
01:44:34,532 --> 01:44:36,898
Her room is not upstairs any more.

774
01:44:37,202 --> 01:44:39,500
She'll stay below,
as your mother had!

775
01:44:40,104 --> 01:44:44,507
Go and mind your duties out there.
Don't interfere in womanly matters!

776
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:49,241
We'll follow our
traditional customs.

777
01:44:50,114 --> 01:44:53,413
Open the room down here, somebody...

778
01:45:12,971 --> 01:45:17,101
I'm feeling very scared.
Tell me what happened actually.

779
01:45:17,308 --> 01:45:18,275
Tell me... please.

780
01:45:34,325 --> 01:45:35,952
What shall I tell you, Mom?

781
01:45:38,263 --> 01:45:40,959
My brother-in-law
came to me at night...

782
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:43,868
And he... forced himself on me...

783
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:51,971
Don't say anything further.

784
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,975
I suspected this.

785
01:46:00,919 --> 01:46:07,256
Don't you dare mention this to anyone.
Did you hear? Don't say a word.

786
01:46:13,097 --> 01:46:18,057
You don't know these aristocrats.
They have their noses in the air.

787
01:46:19,637 --> 01:46:24,597
They'll shoot that rascal dead,
and the rest of the bullets...

788
01:46:28,947 --> 01:46:34,908
No, my dear, no! There'll be
corpses all over the place.

789
01:46:36,254 --> 01:46:40,987
Seal your lips, dear child,
Seal them!

790
01:46:43,661 --> 01:46:47,688
Dev, you?
- You've changed completely Radha.

791
01:46:48,266 --> 01:46:51,030
How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you both?

792
01:46:51,269 --> 01:46:52,463
We're all well.

793
01:46:54,906 --> 01:46:56,601
Please come in.

794
01:46:58,843 --> 01:47:02,540
Where's your luggage?
- I didn't bring it.

795
01:47:02,814 --> 01:47:04,304
I'm going back today itself.

796
01:47:04,482 --> 01:47:08,316
You remembered me after ages, and,
you won't even stay for a few days?

797
01:47:08,519 --> 01:47:12,285
Come, sit down.
- It's not that, Radha.

798
01:47:12,557 --> 01:47:17,051
Actually I was feeling very uneasy
for quite some time now.

799
01:47:17,261 --> 01:47:20,719
I couldn't stand it any more,
so I thought I'd come to see you.

800
01:47:20,898 --> 01:47:22,729
Dev?
- Yes.

801
01:47:24,202 --> 01:47:27,569
Who else would I ask about Rama,
except you?

802
01:47:27,839 --> 01:47:33,573
I shouldn't have meddled.
You both may have got married.

803
01:47:33,845 --> 01:47:38,805
No, in fact it was very timely.
She was rich, and I...

804
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:46,078
I couldn't have given her the
perks her husband can give her.

805
01:47:46,424 --> 01:47:48,756
How is he? Well, I hope?

806
01:47:49,761 --> 01:47:56,758
Rama is happy, isn't she? They
are happy together, aren't they?

807
01:48:03,341 --> 01:48:06,777
Oh Dev... Dev...

808
01:48:07,879 --> 01:48:11,713
Tell me the truth, for my sake!
What's the matter?

809
01:48:12,683 --> 01:48:19,282
How do I tell you?
But I'll have to break your heart.

810
01:48:20,725 --> 01:48:25,128
On the 4th day after her marriage,
your Rama was widowed, Dev!

811
01:49:10,541 --> 01:49:14,773
Where're all your slippers, Rama?
- Which ones, Dev?

812
01:49:16,214 --> 01:49:19,672
Those finely embroidered,
delicate ones?

813
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:45,273
Don't cry... Please don't cry.

814
01:49:46,711 --> 01:49:51,273
I had so many hopes and dreams...
but everything is shattered now...

815
01:49:51,649 --> 01:49:58,612
Everything is taken away.
- Don't say that.

816
01:50:00,725 --> 01:50:04,286
Everything will be fine.

817
01:50:12,537 --> 01:50:18,498
Tell me, how are your studies?
Did you get your Ph. D?

818
01:50:19,677 --> 01:50:22,407
No. I didn't finish my thesis.

819
01:50:23,681 --> 01:50:27,515
You mustn't have concentrated.
- I couldn't.

820
01:50:28,419 --> 01:50:30,410
Because there was
nobody to scold you!

821
01:50:30,955 --> 01:50:38,327
You should've thought of me. I'll
go now. I can't eat after sunset.

822
01:50:44,635 --> 01:50:47,798
I haven't eaten either.
Won't you invite me?

823
01:50:48,573 --> 01:50:53,806
Will you come? Good!
I won't have to eat alone.

824
01:50:58,649 --> 01:51:01,550
Chef!
- Yes, my dear?

825
01:51:01,919 --> 01:51:04,547
Dev will eat here.
Send one "Thali".

826
01:51:05,923 --> 01:51:11,088
Only one?
You haven't eaten either, Rama.

827
01:51:12,196 --> 01:51:16,826
I cook before I go to the temple.
There's no time when I return.

828
01:51:18,469 --> 01:51:22,371
Doesn't the cook, cook for you?
- He has other chores too.

829
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:26,039
And I have lots of spare time.
Thought I'd cook my own food.

830
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:28,810
It'll pass my time at least.
Come.

831
01:51:29,547 --> 01:51:30,707
Where are you going?

832
01:51:32,083 --> 01:51:33,516
Your room's upstairs.

833
01:51:35,152 --> 01:51:41,022
No. I stay in this room now.
Easier to go to the temple. Come in.

834
01:51:53,904 --> 01:51:57,135
You live like this?

835
01:51:58,242 --> 01:52:03,145
Chef, send the pudding please.
- Let me take this thali first.

836
01:52:03,547 --> 01:52:05,412
Who has come?
- Devdhar, Ma'am.

837
01:52:05,783 --> 01:52:07,341
He's sitting with Rama.

838
01:52:10,921 --> 01:52:13,754
I've kept the dinner, dear.
Please take it.

839
01:52:21,032 --> 01:52:26,231
Why didn't he bring it in?
Must be pressed for time. Sit.

840
01:52:30,074 --> 01:52:31,371
Eat.
- And you?

841
01:52:33,277 --> 01:52:35,871
I'll eat later. Please carry on.

842
01:52:37,581 --> 01:52:38,878
How are you, Devdhar?

843
01:52:39,817 --> 01:52:41,375
My respects.
- Sit down.

844
01:52:42,219 --> 01:52:43,379
You eat with him too.
- But Mom...

845
01:52:43,754 --> 01:52:45,119
You eat once a day anyway...

846
01:52:45,489 --> 01:52:48,049
And if the sun sets,
you'll miss that one meal too.

847
01:52:53,264 --> 01:52:57,667
You eat this stuff?
- Aunty says it's good for widows.

848
01:52:58,602 --> 01:53:02,936
It keeps our minds at peace, and
it doesn't induce bad thoughts.

849
01:53:03,174 --> 01:53:06,337
So that a person becomes a corpse.
That's why this food is served!

850
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:15,544
Listen. There's pudding tonight.

851
01:53:15,986 --> 01:53:18,682
Shall I get you some?
- No, Mom.

852
01:53:19,056 --> 01:53:22,617
Why not? Better to eat openly,
than to sneak and eat.

853
01:53:26,731 --> 01:53:29,700
God knows why these widows
are so shrewd!

854
01:53:32,002 --> 01:53:36,962
One doesn't leave a meal half-way.
It's an insult to the Goddess.

855
01:53:40,911 --> 01:53:43,277
Aren't the living being insulted?

856
01:53:51,756 --> 01:53:54,224
Why did you learn to? Why?

857
01:53:57,361 --> 01:54:00,455
You're doing atrocity and injustice
to yourself. It's a sin...

858
01:54:00,765 --> 01:54:06,328
to do atrocity and to bear it.
You are committing a sin!

859
01:54:26,323 --> 01:54:31,886
Everybody is against me, Dev.
You too made me cry and went away?

860
01:54:34,865 --> 01:54:43,330
I can't bear to see you live
like this. I've hurt you. Forgive me.

861
01:54:44,408 --> 01:54:49,846
But I just can't see anyone die
under the burden of false customs.

862
01:54:50,214 --> 01:54:53,706
No, I just can't.

863
01:54:57,888 --> 01:55:00,857
Yes?
- Angry with me.

864
01:55:01,892 --> 01:55:02,517
No.

865
01:55:03,427 --> 01:55:08,524
But can't you forgive?
- Okay.

866
01:55:11,769 --> 01:55:15,205
Not like this. Yesterday I had
insulted the Goddess of food...

867
01:55:15,573 --> 01:55:17,871
Today I'd like to make
amends with you.

868
01:55:18,242 --> 01:55:19,209
Don't bother.

869
01:55:22,046 --> 01:55:30,886
But I'll be in a flap. I had told
my Aunt I'd bring you for lunch.

870
01:55:30,988 --> 01:55:37,416
You know I eat what I cook myself.
- Yes, she too has cooked it herself.

871
01:55:37,795 --> 01:55:42,289
No Dev. I eat just once a day.

872
01:55:43,467 --> 01:55:48,234
Listen, don't eat in the evening.
You didn't eat yesterday, did you?

873
01:55:50,674 --> 01:55:56,442
The truth now. Did you eat?
- No. But why don't you understand?

874
01:55:56,814 --> 01:56:01,251
They'll all wait for me at home.
- Nobody'll even give you a thought!

875
01:56:01,685 --> 01:56:05,314
Your mother may get upset,
so I've told her before hand. Come.

876
01:56:05,623 --> 01:56:11,584
You're being very stubborn!
- Because you've stopped being so!

877
01:56:20,905 --> 01:56:23,669
Yes, Radha's husband was here,
but he insisted on going back.

878
01:56:24,041 --> 01:56:28,137
I told him to stay back, but
who listens? Oh, come, Aunty.

879
01:56:30,514 --> 01:56:35,884
I don't eat all this, Aunty.
- It's nothing much, my dear.

880
01:56:36,654 --> 01:56:39,885
I don't mean that. I...
- There's no chilly in it. Honestly.

881
01:56:40,257 --> 01:56:41,622
Look, I'll show you.

882
01:56:46,797 --> 01:56:52,030
Now, you eat.
- No, Dev.

883
01:56:52,403 --> 01:56:54,963
Will you eat, or, do I force it
down your throat?

884
01:56:55,339 --> 01:56:58,706
You can bite me if you wish,
I'll take those 14 injections!

885
01:56:59,076 --> 01:57:01,101
No, please.
- Aunty!

886
01:57:01,412 --> 01:57:03,642
Keep that black balm ready.

887
01:57:03,948 --> 01:57:08,908
Rama will bite me first and then,
bandage my hand for me. Yes?

888
01:57:24,535 --> 01:57:27,436
What's this?
You ended up crying while laughing?

889
01:57:31,976 --> 01:57:33,443
I had forgotten how to laugh.
Why remind me and make me cry?

890
01:57:34,044 --> 01:57:35,477
Don't do this.

891
01:57:36,447 --> 01:57:39,939
You've totally forgotten
how to laugh, or smile even.

892
01:57:40,317 --> 01:57:45,277
Smile, dear. Your smile will spread
like dew over flowers.

893
01:57:45,723 --> 01:57:50,558
Try it once. Billions of flowers
will burst into glory.

894
01:57:55,132 --> 01:57:58,761
Smile... go on.

895
01:58:47,117 --> 01:58:52,487
"The bee made the flower bloom,
and the prince took the flower away"

896
01:59:04,201 --> 01:59:09,503
"Don't forget to tell the flower,
that may she live long"

897
01:59:58,989 --> 02:00:04,325
"The bee made the flower bloom,
but the prince took the flower away"

898
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:15,834
"Don't forget to remind her,
that she's neither here, nor there"

899
02:00:55,646 --> 02:01:00,606
"Joys and sorrows come and go"

900
02:01:08,192 --> 02:01:12,754
"There's no hunger for joy,
nor worry about the sorrow..."

901
02:01:13,263 --> 02:01:22,228
"when love takes over,
joys and sorrows come and go"

902
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:28,742
"Meera drank poison,
but love turned it into elixir"

903
02:01:29,112 --> 02:01:34,311
"Saint Kabir sings away
in glory of love..."

904
02:01:34,751 --> 02:01:38,448
"Joys and sorrows, come and go"

905
02:01:39,623 --> 02:01:45,118
"Don't forget to tell the flower,
that let bygones be bygones"

906
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:25,031
"No... Don't..."

907
02:02:37,014 --> 02:02:44,113
"Among the innocent blooming flowers
the bumble-bee buzzes..."

908
02:02:44,521 --> 02:02:49,481
"why does he disturb their sleep?"

909
02:02:56,566 --> 02:03:06,806
"One flower among millions
has made them all bloom"

910
02:03:07,377 --> 02:03:11,245
"and smile ever so sweetly"

911
02:03:11,448 --> 02:03:16,351
"Why disturb the sleeping?"

912
02:03:17,454 --> 02:03:22,619
"Don't forget to remind the flower,
that her honey is no more sweet..."

913
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:27,793
"The bee made the flower bloom
but the prince took it away!"

914
02:03:28,865 --> 02:03:33,461
"Don't forget to tell the flower
how beautiful and simple it is"

915
02:05:02,292 --> 02:05:06,251
Damn it! A widow!
God knows what's in store for me.

916
02:05:06,563 --> 02:05:11,728
They were telling us to
get our widows remarried.

917
02:05:12,035 --> 02:05:14,868
But now that their own daughter
is a widow, they're all quiet.

918
02:05:15,172 --> 02:05:17,402
And whom did they get?
A priest's orphaned nephew.

919
02:05:17,707 --> 02:05:18,731
Weren't we around for her?

920
02:05:19,009 --> 02:05:20,135
Shh!
- Where is he?

921
02:05:43,366 --> 02:05:45,960
They are not fancy. Look.

922
02:05:46,536 --> 02:05:51,166
What are you doing? Go away.
People are staring. Let me go.

923
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:52,838
Wear these and then go.

924
02:05:53,210 --> 02:05:59,240
Wear them. Don't break your lover's
heart. He's doing a good deed.

925
02:05:59,616 --> 02:06:02,016
The priest has taught him this!

926
02:06:05,689 --> 02:06:09,853
Hurry up and wear them.
- There's a limit to stubbornness too.

927
02:06:10,227 --> 02:06:14,789
What nonsense is this?
- Don't pretend, dear priest.

928
02:06:15,132 --> 02:06:18,727
Don't tell us that you don't know
what your city-bred nephew's up to!

929
02:06:20,036 --> 02:06:23,870
Blacken his face, make him sit
on and ass, back to front...

930
02:06:24,241 --> 02:06:28,075
and take him round the town.
He'll come on his senses then!

931
02:06:31,648 --> 02:06:35,209
That's a good remedy.
But can you tell me the cause?

932
02:06:35,585 --> 02:06:41,546
How innocent he is!
- Don't you know she's a widow?

933
02:06:43,093 --> 02:06:48,554
Can anyone tell me why blame
a girl if she becomes a widow?

934
02:06:50,467 --> 02:06:54,096
The sun doesn't refuse her light.
The flowers offer her their scent.

935
02:06:54,404 --> 02:06:57,567
Nature doesn't change her rules
for anyone. Then why do people...

936
02:06:57,941 --> 02:07:01,775
compel her to walk bare footed,
eat inedible food, sleep on a mat?

937
02:07:02,145 --> 02:07:07,105
Why can't she laugh, be happy...
- Fall in love, get married.

938
02:07:07,284 --> 02:07:10,913
Yes, why not? Will the sky fall?
- What nonsense you talk, Dev?

939
02:07:11,288 --> 02:07:15,247
It's a sin for widows to even think
of love and marriage! Immoral!

940
02:07:15,492 --> 02:07:20,259
When you got your only daughter
married to a man twice her age...

941
02:07:20,564 --> 02:07:26,025
whose wife had died recently,
didn't you see sin, immorality in it?

942
02:07:26,303 --> 02:07:29,864
Double standards, eh uncle?
Different codes for men and women, eh?

943
02:07:30,173 --> 02:07:34,269
Talk about yourself!
Will you wed her, or is she a sister?

944
02:07:35,645 --> 02:07:39,877
Why, isn't there any other relation
besides these two you mentioned?

945
02:07:40,217 --> 02:07:45,280
Tell us about that too.
- What was their relation? Your Gods.

946
02:07:45,722 --> 02:07:49,123
Had Krishna married Radha, or,
did he look to her as a sister?

947
02:07:49,326 --> 02:07:51,954
You abuse Gods and their consorts?
Bash him up!

948
02:07:52,262 --> 02:07:57,165
Hit him! Hit him!
- You dare touch him!

949
02:07:58,468 --> 02:08:00,026
I'll kill each one of you!

950
02:08:00,337 --> 02:08:04,831
Let them be.
It's not their fault.

951
02:08:05,342 --> 02:08:11,713
Whoever has loved truly in this
world has been treated like this.

952
02:08:12,816 --> 02:08:18,652
Those who don't understand love,
how can they know divine love?

953
02:08:20,190 --> 02:08:23,318
They only know man-made relations.

954
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:26,321
Husband, lover, brother,
father, pal...

955
02:08:26,696 --> 02:08:30,325
Love means much more
than these relationships.

956
02:08:31,234 --> 02:08:32,997
He's talking sense.

957
02:08:33,370 --> 02:08:39,866
Having a good time is different.
But ask him, will he marry a widow?

958
02:08:44,381 --> 02:08:48,112
Yes I will marry Rama.

959
02:08:51,721 --> 02:08:58,024
Yes, I'll make you mine.
- No, I'll survive somehow.

960
02:08:58,395 --> 02:09:04,823
I can endure sorrow, insults, and
even taunts. But not your pity.

961
02:09:05,468 --> 02:09:08,767
I'm not pitying you.
I love you.

962
02:09:10,607 --> 02:09:16,375
And I always have.
The day I saw you off as a bride.

963
02:09:16,746 --> 02:09:21,046
The day I removed the thorn from
your foot, and today, even now.

964
02:09:24,421 --> 02:09:28,221
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
I had trusted you.

965
02:09:28,958 --> 02:09:34,919
You've killed that trust. Don't even
show me your face. Leave this place.

966
02:09:36,766 --> 02:09:38,791
Listen to me at least, Rama.
- Rama is dead to you!

967
02:09:39,069 --> 02:09:42,197
We've nothing to do with
each other. It's all over!

968
02:10:00,357 --> 02:10:01,346
Uncle!

969
02:10:02,792 --> 02:10:09,163
Get me some poison, dear.
And when I die, step on my chest...

970
02:10:09,466 --> 02:10:12,435
...and then do what you like!
I won't stop you.

971
02:10:12,736 --> 02:10:21,440
I haven't done anything like that.
Do you believe these people?

972
02:10:21,811 --> 02:10:24,837
I haven't done anything.

973
02:10:28,618 --> 02:10:34,454
I've said what I wanted to.
Now it's up to you.

974
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:07,852
May I say something?
Don't you love Dev?

975
02:11:08,124 --> 02:11:08,818
Mom!

976
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:16,025
Tell me the truth.
Don't you really love him?

977
02:11:17,033 --> 02:11:20,491
You too, Mom?

978
02:11:23,139 --> 02:11:28,099
I know you better than yourself!
I'm your mother, dear.

979
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:39,177
The fact is, you do love him.
You know it, but you won't admit it.

980
02:11:41,458 --> 02:11:48,864
Because he's a poor orphan, and you,
a daughter of a rich aristocrat.

981
02:11:49,232 --> 02:11:51,530
Who is taught just this!

982
02:11:51,968 --> 02:11:54,994
Duty, conduct, morals,
social norms, purity!

983
02:11:56,105 --> 02:11:58,801
And by getting confused by
such heavy words...

984
02:11:59,175 --> 02:12:03,839
you too have begun to believe
that you've no right to be happy!

985
02:12:06,483 --> 02:12:09,350
How long will you avoid the truth?

986
02:12:09,853 --> 02:12:11,218
I ask you, you think
of him while, sleeping...

987
02:12:11,454 --> 02:12:12,819
when awake, sitting and standing...

988
02:12:13,189 --> 02:12:18,217
Infact, every breath you take
rings with Dev, Dev, Dev.

989
02:12:18,595 --> 02:12:25,023
If this isn't love, then what is it?
It's simply love, my dear. Love.

990
02:12:42,418 --> 02:12:55,593
"You weren't destined to be mine
then why do I wait for you?"

991
02:12:58,334 --> 02:13:09,506
"I loved you yesterday,
I love you even now"

992
02:14:04,634 --> 02:14:13,064
"I've realised what love is,
today I love you"

993
02:14:13,443 --> 02:14:21,942
"Till yesterday you waited for me,
Today I wait for you"

994
02:14:57,286 --> 02:15:01,382
"Maybe you aren't meant for me"

995
02:15:01,758 --> 02:15:05,990
"Why did my eyes dream of love?"

996
02:15:06,429 --> 02:15:14,598
"I had asked joy from you, but you
didn't even give your sorrows to me"

997
02:15:14,971 --> 02:15:19,408
"You didn't even give
your sorrows to me"

998
02:15:19,776 --> 02:15:28,150
"Life has become a burden now.
Neither I live, nor I die"

999
02:15:28,518 --> 02:15:36,948
"I loved you yesterday,
I love you even now"

1000
02:15:37,326 --> 02:15:41,592
"Maybe you weren't destined
for me"

1001
02:16:16,165 --> 02:16:20,124
"Now love ties will not be broken"

1002
02:16:25,041 --> 02:16:33,676
"They'll have to be nurtured like
yesterday, you'll have to remove..."

1003
02:16:34,050 --> 02:16:38,282
"all thorns from my path.
The thorns of sorrow..."

1004
02:16:42,759 --> 02:16:51,098
"Which I hope I don't find in my joy,
for shadows of sorrow scare me"

1005
02:16:51,467 --> 02:17:00,307
"Till yesterday you waited for me.
Today I wait for you"

1006
02:17:00,676 --> 02:17:04,237
"I think I've realised
what love is..."

1007
02:17:41,918 --> 02:17:49,882
"My dear heart, no leisure...
I'll drown in your love"

1008
02:17:50,927 --> 02:17:59,232
"I do want to meet you so!
For my world is so sad... come!"

1009
02:18:04,106 --> 02:18:12,514
"This is what is known as love...
Every moment"

1010
02:18:12,949 --> 02:18:21,379
"I remember you day and night
and I wait for you eagerly"

1011
02:18:21,691 --> 02:18:30,121
"May be you're not destined for me.
Then why do I wait for you?"

1012
02:18:30,366 --> 02:18:34,666
"I loved you even yesterday"

1013
02:18:34,971 --> 02:18:39,101
"I love you even now"

1014
02:18:39,475 --> 02:18:43,468
"I love you very much"

1015
02:18:43,813 --> 02:18:48,147
"I too love you very much"

1016
02:18:55,591 --> 02:19:02,997
Love, romance mean nothing to you.
But when will you tire of lust?

1017
02:19:05,334 --> 02:19:11,637
To ruin women is a right to you.
But I've freedom to one at last.

1018
02:19:13,276 --> 02:19:19,044
What do you want to say?
- That boy adores your daughter.

1019
02:19:20,349 --> 02:19:24,786
Get your daughter settled again.
Get her married to that boy.

1020
02:19:27,556 --> 02:19:31,856
Who is that bastard?
Tell me, else I'll kill you!

1021
02:19:35,364 --> 02:19:40,734
Why are you hitting my nephew?
Please don't hit him.

1022
02:19:52,648 --> 02:19:56,345
Go somebody...
Go and call my husband.

1023
02:20:02,391 --> 02:20:07,624
What's this your doing?
Please stop. I beg you.

1024
02:20:07,930 --> 02:20:11,764
Sir, what's going on?
Do you want to kill him?

1025
02:20:12,201 --> 02:20:18,106
Tell your nephew that if he wishes
to live, he should leave by tonight.

1026
02:20:22,545 --> 02:20:26,379
You've punished me, Sir.
Won't you tell me my crime?

1027
02:20:28,951 --> 02:20:32,045
Of course, so that the whole village
comes to know what happens...

1028
02:20:32,421 --> 02:20:36,118
when someone plays around
with an aristocratic girl.

1029
02:20:36,425 --> 02:20:41,055
You're lying! You didn't come here
for your daughter's reputation.

1030
02:20:41,597 --> 02:20:45,397
You've come here to live up to
your false pride and position!

1031
02:20:46,936 --> 02:20:50,201
When people refer to her as a widow
and turn their faces away...

1032
02:20:50,573 --> 02:20:52,063
...it doesn't hurt your pride.

1033
02:20:52,441 --> 02:20:56,468
But when I wanted to give her a
little respect, it got your guts!

1034
02:20:57,446 --> 02:21:02,748
Do you know how she exists in
that dark dungeon in your house?

1035
02:21:03,119 --> 02:21:09,922
That's our personal matter.
- No, it isn't.

1036
02:21:10,292 --> 02:21:14,490
Because all these inhuman practices
start from rich families like yours!

1037
02:21:14,864 --> 02:21:17,833
And then they become customs
and spread in entire society.

1038
02:21:18,134 --> 02:21:22,298
Tie him behind the jeep, drag him
to the outskirts and dump him.

1039
02:21:22,671 --> 02:21:25,435
When he becomes an invalid,
he'll know the consequences...

1040
02:21:25,808 --> 02:21:29,107
for having abused our old
traditions and customs.

1041
02:21:29,812 --> 02:21:34,647
Enough, Sir! How can you
talk of customs and traditions?

1042
02:21:35,017 --> 02:21:40,512
That day, when Rama's horoscope
was to be matched for marriage...

1043
02:21:40,890 --> 02:21:44,382
you had cast aside social norms
and forced me to make a new one.

1044
02:21:44,693 --> 02:21:49,255
Did you really do a fake one?
- He had forced me to make one.

1045
02:21:49,632 --> 02:21:53,124
Is the priest telling the truth?

1046
02:21:56,439 --> 02:21:57,531
Why don't you say something?

1047
02:22:02,311 --> 02:22:07,749
We'll talk about this with
the priest in our local-court.

1048
02:22:11,987 --> 02:22:16,481
Change your rotten rules, sir.
Time is flying past.

1049
02:22:16,859 --> 02:22:22,161
You cannot stop the speed
of time, with your hands, Sir.

1050
02:22:32,208 --> 02:22:40,308
You bitch! I'll cut you open
if you step out of this room.

1051
02:22:40,683 --> 02:22:42,981
What's the matter?
What has she done?

1052
02:22:43,285 --> 02:22:50,453
She's going around with Devdhar.
- We just skinned him alive!

1053
02:22:51,694 --> 02:22:55,061
Devdhar?
- And she's asking what she's done?

1054
02:22:55,364 --> 02:22:59,528
Today I had to approach those
small people because of her!

1055
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:34,959
You, sire?
- And so unexpectedly?

1056
02:24:35,331 --> 02:24:38,926
Well...
- I called him.

1057
02:24:39,335 --> 02:24:46,104
You didn't even confer with me?
- Was it necessary even now?

1058
02:24:57,686 --> 02:25:00,211
Pack Rama's bags.
He has come to take her.

1059
02:25:32,288 --> 02:25:35,257
She'll die. She won't survive.

1060
02:25:37,526 --> 02:25:45,023
Dev is a good boy.
He loves her. She too loves him.

1061
02:25:45,868 --> 02:25:47,096
Why not get them married?

1062
02:25:47,403 --> 02:25:54,275
What! You're not in your senses.
Go away from here!

1063
02:25:56,078 --> 02:26:02,506
You've forgotten your position,
and you're talking as a mother now.

1064
02:26:04,286 --> 02:26:11,852
Yes, I am her mother.
But aren't you her uncle too?

1065
02:26:13,896 --> 02:26:20,324
And Dev has openly declared
that he'll marry Rama.

1066
02:26:22,104 --> 02:26:26,063
How dare he!
Anybody there?

1067
02:26:30,045 --> 02:26:32,275
Call Kishanlal at once!

1068
02:26:36,251 --> 02:26:45,592
I fed a snake! But if I can
feed him, I can crush him too!

1069
02:26:45,861 --> 02:26:49,422
Of course you can! Because he's
poor, a nobody, from a weak society.

1070
02:26:49,798 --> 02:26:56,101
Kill him because he tried to bring
light in Rama's dark world.

1071
02:26:56,472 --> 02:27:02,240
But what did you about him,
who raped your innocent niece?

1072
02:27:02,478 --> 02:27:03,775
What!
- Yes!

1073
02:27:04,146 --> 02:27:08,446
What did you do about
that king Virendra Pratap...

1074
02:27:08,817 --> 02:27:11,650
who raped my daughter!

1075
02:27:20,562 --> 02:27:25,056
Your brother is entertaining him,
because he's from a rich family.

1076
02:27:25,367 --> 02:27:31,795
You won't touch him either.
Send her with That Vir Pratap Singh.

1077
02:27:32,174 --> 02:27:38,477
Send her with that butcher,
even if he tears her to pieces!

1078
02:27:47,856 --> 02:27:51,952
Listen. Anger and hate
can only worsen the matter.

1079
02:27:52,261 --> 02:27:55,822
But think carefully,
before you take any step.

1080
02:28:04,006 --> 02:28:08,443
Why? Haven't they done enough?
Do they want to kill him?

1081
02:28:08,544 --> 02:28:13,379
Tell him, Dev will not come.
- Wait Kishanlal. I'll come.

1082
02:28:15,751 --> 02:28:18,845
Where are you going?
- To the Thakurs.

1083
02:28:19,154 --> 02:28:22,521
Heavens! A man whose very name
brings darkness everywhere...

1084
02:28:22,758 --> 02:28:25,454
can only mean ill-omen.

1085
02:28:25,761 --> 02:28:27,854
Don't go.
- What nonsense.

1086
02:28:28,230 --> 02:28:32,792
Electricity always fluctuates.
A village after all. Don't worry.

1087
02:28:33,101 --> 02:28:34,796
It'll come soon. Let's go.

1088
02:28:40,175 --> 02:28:44,009
Come in Devdhar.
I'm sitting right here.

1089
02:28:52,654 --> 02:28:53,621
Respects, Sir.

1090
02:28:56,191 --> 02:28:59,558
Sir, you, in this darkness?

1091
02:29:00,329 --> 02:29:05,892
I want to talk to you.
Good it's dark in here.

1092
02:29:09,271 --> 02:29:10,238
Sit down.

1093
02:29:17,513 --> 02:29:23,383
Is there any truth in what
I'm hearing about you and my niece?

1094
02:29:24,820 --> 02:29:28,381
Yes. I love her.

1095
02:29:30,492 --> 02:29:32,722
Knowing that she's a widow!

1096
02:29:34,162 --> 02:29:39,190
When I returned from the city,
I had paid my respects to you.

1097
02:29:39,501 --> 02:29:44,131
Not because you are elderly, but,
because I realised your greatness.

1098
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:49,472
That day you were telling a man,
to get his widowed daughter remarried.

1099
02:29:49,845 --> 02:29:54,612
That was different.
We live with double-standards.

1100
02:29:54,983 --> 02:30:01,946
Some rules for them,
and other for us! It's all a facade.

1101
02:30:02,991 --> 02:30:06,449
But our widows don't remarry.

1102
02:30:09,531 --> 02:30:11,897
Then may I go?
- Sit down!

1103
02:30:14,536 --> 02:30:16,970
I haven't finished speaking as yet.

1104
02:30:17,339 --> 02:30:23,972
It's a fact that I can't let her
remarry. So here's what I suggest.

1105
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:30,975
Elope with her!

1106
02:30:36,892 --> 02:30:39,122
Sir?
- Yes Dev.

1107
02:30:39,494 --> 02:30:44,124
We'll curse her forever that
she humiliated her family name.

1108
02:30:44,533 --> 02:30:51,666
But we'll save our pride.
Don't worry. I'll arrange it for you.

1109
02:30:52,374 --> 02:30:56,208
But nobody should
come to know of it.

1110
02:30:57,045 --> 02:31:06,886
Nobody will know, sir.
But... I won't elope with her.

1111
02:31:09,324 --> 02:31:14,421
Yes, because it's not a question
of just Rama and myself.

1112
02:31:15,063 --> 02:31:19,363
It's a battle against age-old
wrong customs and traditions!

1113
02:31:20,068 --> 02:31:22,969
Which has spread like cancer
in our society, sir.

1114
02:31:25,741 --> 02:31:27,299
If Rama ever becomes a bride,
it'll be with your blessings.

1115
02:31:27,609 --> 02:31:32,046
You'll sit her in a bridal palaquin
and bid her goodbye. Then she'll go.

1116
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:40,783
This is a battle of principles, Sir.
No compromise in this.

1117
02:31:41,590 --> 02:31:45,458
There'll be either a total loss
in it, or victory!

1118
02:32:01,309 --> 02:32:02,469
Goodbye!

1119
02:32:17,859 --> 02:32:22,421
May God give you victory,
and let the defeat be ours!

1120
02:32:26,468 --> 02:32:34,637
What are you saying? You mean
he dared to soil our reputation?

1121
02:32:34,976 --> 02:32:41,677
No, it's not what I mean. The whole
village is on Dev's side.

1122
02:32:42,017 --> 02:32:53,793
Don't worry. Let alone the village,
but even God can't save him now.

1123
02:32:54,229 --> 02:33:01,135
I've seen to it all. Tonight,
we'll dump his body in such a place...

1124
02:33:01,503 --> 02:33:08,807
that even crows and kites
won't be able to find it!

1125
02:33:44,546 --> 02:33:46,844
You? And at this time?

1126
02:33:49,017 --> 02:33:54,717
You love me very much, don't you?
Tell me.

1127
02:33:55,891 --> 02:34:02,387
I may have hurt your feelings,
but frankly, I love you very much.

1128
02:34:03,765 --> 02:34:10,261
I also love you very much!
But we're so unlucky...

1129
02:34:10,572 --> 02:34:17,205
to realise it so very late.
I beseech you with that very love.

1130
02:34:17,579 --> 02:34:19,137
Please leave this village and go.

1131
02:34:20,415 --> 02:34:24,283
What are you saying?
- I've heard it with my own ears.

1132
02:34:24,653 --> 02:34:30,888
They'll kill you. So before
they come, go away from here.

1133
02:34:32,093 --> 02:34:38,362
No, I won't leave you here and go.
- Don't worry about me.

1134
02:34:39,334 --> 02:34:45,967
I'm ruined as it is.
I married and then became a widow.

1135
02:34:46,341 --> 02:34:53,509
You know all this. But you don't
know that later on, I was raped.

1136
02:34:53,815 --> 02:34:56,511
I was raped mercilessly.

1137
02:35:02,357 --> 02:35:06,657
Stale, trampled flowers
are not offered to Gods.

1138
02:35:07,495 --> 02:35:09,554
I'm not worthy of you now.

1139
02:35:14,970 --> 02:35:19,464
Do you think this insignificant
reason is enough to erase my love?

1140
02:35:19,774 --> 02:35:25,144
I'm not asking to erase it.
But listen to me and go back!

1141
02:35:25,447 --> 02:35:30,384
I will go back. But after
I marry you. Not before.

1142
02:35:30,719 --> 02:35:35,486
Okay. As you wish.

1143
02:35:44,165 --> 02:35:47,157
Here you are. I'm married now.

1144
02:35:48,203 --> 02:35:51,297
What's this?
- You're my husband.

1145
02:35:52,540 --> 02:35:57,170
Now I beg you, as a wife,
to leave this village.

1146
02:35:57,545 --> 02:36:00,173
Please go, Dev. Please go!

1147
02:36:17,899 --> 02:36:24,805
Oh Dev! My body, and soul...
Every breath I take, is yours.

1148
02:36:25,173 --> 02:36:31,874
Please listen to me.
I've been widowed once before.

1149
02:36:32,647 --> 02:36:34,774
Don't make me a widow again.

1150
02:37:19,094 --> 02:37:21,392
What's the matter?
- They're beating up Devdhar.

1151
02:37:21,763 --> 02:37:24,061
Come on men...

1152
02:37:32,374 --> 02:37:33,341
Let me go!

1153
02:37:36,378 --> 02:37:37,345
This is our Rama!

1154
02:38:16,351 --> 02:38:21,186
Stop it! Stop it!
Ramlal, stop it!

1155
02:38:21,890 --> 02:38:24,518
Stop everybody! Stop!

1156
02:38:28,663 --> 02:38:33,623
Take all these asses and throw
them on that Thakur's doorstep!

1157
02:38:34,002 --> 02:38:38,598
Let them know, that villagers
will not tolerate atrocities!

1158
02:38:40,241 --> 02:38:46,202
That's all very well, but this
action was not a wise one.

1159
02:38:46,514 --> 02:38:50,143
My dear, forgive me.
But go home.

1160
02:38:50,518 --> 02:38:53,146
It's not proper for us to
trouble to these simple folks.

1161
02:38:53,521 --> 02:38:56,422
We'll also leave this place,
this very moment.

1162
02:38:56,691 --> 02:38:58,955
How many times will you shift?

1163
02:38:59,527 --> 02:39:02,496
Shifting from place to place
doesn't change these rotten rules.

1164
02:39:02,864 --> 02:39:10,828
The caste system is not erased.
Somebody has to fight this system.

1165
02:40:02,157 --> 02:40:08,562
Folks, I've nothing against you.
But If I do have...

1166
02:40:08,930 --> 02:40:15,233
it's against this bastard here.
Who has lived off our money...

1167
02:40:15,603 --> 02:40:19,562
and forgotten his real status.
And also against this slut here.

1168
02:40:19,941 --> 02:40:24,105
Who has dared to step out
even after being told not to!

1169
02:40:24,412 --> 02:40:26,039
Mind your language, Sir.

1170
02:40:27,882 --> 02:40:31,113
She's not your daughter now.
She's my wife!

1171
02:40:35,089 --> 02:40:37,455
You've no right to abuse her.

1172
02:40:37,759 --> 02:40:47,259
You slut! By marrying this lowly,
orphan boy, you've spat on me!

1173
02:40:48,203 --> 02:40:50,933
I shall kill you for this first!

1174
02:40:58,112 --> 02:41:04,608
Great! You kill an innocent,
and talk of respectability, eh?

1175
02:41:04,986 --> 02:41:10,618
Go on, look within yourself!
Have you left alone any woman here?

1176
02:41:10,992 --> 02:41:15,622
You picked, and disrobed them
at will. If you'd have your way...

1177
02:41:15,997 --> 02:41:18,192
You'd do the same
to your own daughter!

1178
02:41:19,534 --> 02:41:22,901
Stop! Stop!

1179
02:41:23,271 --> 02:41:30,109
You murderer! Stop killing them.
You have a bone to pick, with me.

1180
02:41:30,545 --> 02:41:33,309
Take me and vent your hatred.

1181
02:41:33,681 --> 02:41:39,119
Take them, and torch them alive!
Let these people see...

1182
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:46,326
...that we don't change justice
even with our own relatives.

1183
02:41:54,769 --> 02:41:59,604
What nonsense you talk!
She may not be a daughter to you.

1184
02:41:59,974 --> 02:42:01,339
But she's the daughter-in-law,
of our family.

1185
02:42:01,709 --> 02:42:06,009
Kill that rascal,
who's the root of all this clash.

1186
02:42:06,381 --> 02:42:09,873
Now, only my decision
will be upheld!

1187
02:42:54,095 --> 02:42:59,658
My men have surrounded your men
on horse backs.

1188
02:43:00,702 --> 02:43:08,199
If Rama gets singed slightly even,
you and your men will writhe!

1189
02:43:09,444 --> 02:43:17,146
You called me to take her away.
And I'll do that, at any cost.

1190
02:43:32,066 --> 02:43:32,430
Father!

1191
02:43:35,470 --> 02:43:39,634
Kill these loyal curs
of the Thakur!

1192
02:44:06,834 --> 02:44:10,235
Leave me alone!

1193
02:44:11,406 --> 02:44:14,307
Save me, Dev!

1194
02:44:15,343 --> 02:44:19,245
He's the one who raped me.

1195
02:45:01,122 --> 02:45:03,181
Riddle him with bullets!

1196
02:45:09,831 --> 02:45:14,291
Come on men, get them!
See that nobody escapes.

1197
02:45:28,583 --> 02:45:30,346
Father...

1198
02:46:27,508 --> 02:46:30,875
You bastard!
Son of a bitch!

1199
02:46:32,914 --> 02:46:35,280
You dare lift your...

1200
02:47:05,012 --> 02:47:06,980
You, sir?

1201
02:47:08,516 --> 02:47:14,318
Even God will not forgive
the sin you committed.

1202
02:47:15,423 --> 02:47:21,123
A man who doesn't look upon
his elder sis-in-law as a mother...

1203
02:47:21,495 --> 02:47:24,658
and the younger one, as a
sister, deserves to die!

1204
02:48:04,071 --> 02:48:10,032
Dear brother, if only your eyes
had opened at the right time.

1205
02:48:12,613 --> 02:48:13,910
If only...

1206
02:48:35,436 --> 02:48:41,739
Dev was wright in saying that
all these dirty and wrong customs...

1207
02:48:42,443 --> 02:48:48,871
start in the homes of the rich.
All this... is due to that.

1208
02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:54,745
And because I'm also a part of it,
the law will punish me too.

1209
02:48:55,122 --> 02:48:58,751
Uncle... No! No!

1210
02:49:02,263 --> 02:49:08,031
Don't, my dear.
Everything will be fine.

1211
02:49:12,807 --> 02:49:14,434
Come, son.

1212
02:49:16,944 --> 02:49:21,904
Take her. Cherish her.

1213
02:49:24,885 --> 02:49:30,118
Dev, you won, and I lost.
