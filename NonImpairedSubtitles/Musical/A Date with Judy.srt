00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,315
NARRATOR: That little city tucked
quietly against the mountains...

2
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,957
...is Santa Barbara, California.

3
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:51,218
Over 40,000 people live there.

4
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:54,886
When 40,000 people get together
somewhere, something must be happening.

5
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,292
Let's take a look.

6
00:01:56,292 --> 00:02:00,232
This is Main Street. Only in Santa Barbara,
it's called State Street.

7
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:02,633
The people here are the same
as people anywhere.

8
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:06,242
Old people, young people.
For the most part, nice people.

9
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:11,176
And speaking of nice people,
this is Pop Scully's soda fountain.

10
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:13,645
Meeting place of the world, Pop calls it.

11
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:17,184
Everybody loves Pop
and everybody goes there.

12
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:20,151
That is, everybody except Mr. Pringle.

13
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:21,654
He's too busy.

14
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:25,693
He's owner of the local radio station,
sponsor of the community theater...

15
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:29,229
...president of the bank and he plays golf.

16
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,027
So Mr. Pringle
doesn't get home very often.

17
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,103
Too bad too, it's a beautiful home.

18
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:37,569
Mr. Foster is a busy man too.

19
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,265
He owns and operates
a fish cannery on the coast.

20
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:44,174
But he's never too busy
that he can't find time for his family.

21
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:48,613
Mr. Fosters' home isn't quite as beautiful
as Mr. Pringle's, but he thinks it is.

22
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:51,015
And he gets home often.

23
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,847
Just around the corner is the high school.

24
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:56,082
There's always something
going on here...

25
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:58,955
...especially when Judy Foster
and her friends are around.

26
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:00,288
Let's go in.

27
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,430
Now, just a minute,
you can't do that to us.

28
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,503
We'd like to come in.

29
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:12,174
That's better. Thank you very much.

30
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:18,712
WOMAN [SINGING]:
It's a most unusual day

31
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:22,648
Feel like throwing my worries away

32
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:26,755
As an old native-born
Californian would say

33
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:30,654
It's a most unusual day

34
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:34,763
There's a most unusual sky

35
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:38,594
Not a sign of a cloud passing by

36
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:42,670
And if I want to sing
Throw my heart in the ring

37
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,502
It's a most unusual day

38
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:50,407
There are people meeting people

39
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:54,573
There is sunshine everywhere

40
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:58,312
There are people greeting people

41
00:03:58,312 --> 00:04:02,424
And a feeling of spring in the air

42
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:06,323
It's a most unusual time

43
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:10,159
I keep feeling my temperature climb

44
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,292
If my heart won't behave
In the usual way

45
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:18,270
There is only one thing to say

46
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:23,071
It's a most unusual
Most unusual

47
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:26,738
Most unusual day

48
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,683
Gee, that was nice, Judy.

49
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:31,649
Thanks, Oogie. What do you think, Carol?

50
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:35,188
Well, it's a very cute
little swing number, Judy...

51
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:38,850
...but frankly, I think it's a bit juvenile
for a senior high school dance.

52
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,360
Judy. Why do you ask her for anyway?

53
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,624
You know my sister
never approves of anything.

54
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,791
Please be quiet. Carol is talking.

55
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,527
Yes, go on, Carol.

56
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:50,195
Hey, now, wait a minute.
Who's directing this, anyway?

57
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:52,841
- Carol is, of course.
- Well, naturally.

58
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,500
Women.

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,775
Try singing the number slower, Judy.
More seductively.

60
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:03,817
And a scarf might give you
something to do with your hands.

61
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:06,547
Like this, follow me.

62
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:13,492
[SINGING]
It's a most

63
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:14,812
Unusual day

64
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:23,037
Feel like throwing

65
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:24,837
My worries away

66
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:34,872
As an old native-born

67
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:35,922
Californian would say

68
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,410
It's a most

69
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,194
Unu...

70
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:52,295
Jo-Jo, that is not the place
for the cymbal crash.

71
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:55,232
Carol, what does she have to
hang on to a handkerchief for?

72
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,737
- You'd think she had hay fever.
- Don't be rude.

73
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,841
But this is supposed to be
a swing number.

74
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,069
- As I was saying...
- Judy, don't pay any attention to her.

75
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,012
Last week you were Kathryn Grayson.
This week you're Hildegard.

76
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:09,743
Couldrt you be just
plain Judy Foster for tonight?

77
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:13,377
If you don't like the way I sing, Oogie,
you can use my understudy, Mitzi.

78
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:15,717
All right, Judy, have it your own way.

79
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:17,689
You always do, anyway.

80
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,657
Here, you may as well take this too.

81
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:23,765
After all, Oogie, someone has to
supervise us or we'd be here all night.

82
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:26,060
I gotta call Mother.
I'll be back in a minute.

83
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,634
CAROL:
Hurry back, Judy.

84
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,864
The things a man has to put up with.

85
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:34,135
Yes, Judy, your dress came.

86
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:36,571
Yes, it's lovely, Judy.

87
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:39,237
Nightingale is pressing it now.

88
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:42,748
Well, you better hurry home.
It's almost time for dinner.

89
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,475
All right, dear.

90
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:51,087
- Feeling better, Melvin?
- Yes, a little bit.

91
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,626
You should see Dr. Lippincott
about some glasses.

92
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:54,785
Oh, nonsense.

93
00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:57,694
My eyes are just as good now
as the day I met you.

94
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,425
Ooh.

95
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:01,570
- Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

96
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,706
Do you have to sneak
into the house like that, Randolph?

97
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:06,432
Why don't you blow a siren?

98
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:09,043
- Your father has a headache.
- Yes, I have a headache.

99
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:11,407
What he needs is glasses.

Swing low, sweet chariot

Dora, can't you teach her another song?

00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:23,321
- She's a very good cook, Melvin.
- Yeah.

105
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:26,394
Hey, Mom, would you ask Father
if I could have 50 cents?

106
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:31,431
Dora, will you tell your son
that he may not have 50 cents?

107
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,831
Bad timing, Randolph.

108
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,104
- Hello, Father. Hello, Mother.
- Hi, darling.

109
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:39,434
Do you have to slam the door
like that, Judy?

110
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:42,476
Oh, I'm sorry.
Look, I've got an orchid.

111
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:46,376
- Your father's got a headache.
- What he needs is glasses.

112
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,482
My eyes are just as good
as a 1 6-year-old boy's.

113
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:54,054
Well, Jo-Jo Hoffenpepper's only 1 5
and he can't see a thing.

114
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:57,420
I'm sure Oogie would be upset
if he saw you wearing his orchid now.

115
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,185
It will be dead before the dance.

116
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:01,990
That's when you have acid
in your system or something.

I'll never get dinner on, Mrs. Foster,
if you don't get Gramps out of my kitchen.

- Mm-hm.

No, what now?

Well, Mitzi wears false eyelashes.
Could I wear false eyelashes tonight?

- No, you may not.
- I'll sell you mine for a dime.

Father, you're going to have
to do something about Randolph.

- Somebody drowned?

He says it's very urgent.

Matter of life or death, no doubt.

Dinner's ready whenever you are.

Why can't we have a butler
like the Pringles do?

Why can't we be civilized?

or the oxblood nail polish...

...that Xavier Cugat accepted my invitation
to the dance tonight.

He seemed very pleased when I told him
that he'd be guest of honor.

Oh, now, Judy, as for your dress
for tonight, what are you wearing?

00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,659
You have a new dress?

149
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,689
It's blue?

150
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,290
Judy, dear, don't you think
your pink would be more appropriate?

151
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:49,798
Your complexion really calls for pink.

152
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,408
It brings out the freshness
and charm of your youth.

153
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,978
That's fine.
I knew you would agree with me.

Au revoir for now.

155
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,641
Miss, your father called to say
he'll not be home for dinner.

156
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,376
Thank you.

157
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,314
A very smart man.

158
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,525
Ogden, I think it's up to you
to find Father and talk to him.

159
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,721
I don't think he'd remember me.

160
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:19,629
Tell him it would be a good strategic move
for him to come to the dance.

161
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,793
It'd promote goodwill
with his depositors.

162
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:24,166
Now, how am I gonna find Father,
eat dinner...

163
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,774
...and pick up Judy
all in time for the dance?

164
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:28,569
Simple, Ogden, you don't eat.

165
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,974
Don't eat?

166
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,913
lturbi never eats before a concert.

167
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:36,711
I'm not lturbi. I'm Oogie, remember?

168
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:39,548
And besides, what about Judy?
I gotta pick her up.

169
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:44,192
Ogden, it's a fundamental law
of human nature...

170
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:47,693
...that women are always
more attracted to men who ignore them.

171
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,660
OGDEN:
I don't think Judy knows that law.

172
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,323
Well, of course she doesn't.
You spoil her.

173
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:55,232
- You shouldn't do that.
- I shouldn't?

174
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,864
And you should never have
given her an orchid.

175
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:59,598
Now she'll expect one every week.

176
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:02,039
- She will?
- Naturally.

177
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,146
You've set a very high standard.
It's hard to live up to it.

178
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:07,680
Well, golly, Carol, what am I gonna do?

179
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:10,782
Don't let her know you're so interested.

180
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:14,252
Take tonight, for instance.
Let somebody else call for her.

181
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,188
Be indifferent.

182
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:18,020
Do you really think so, Carol?

183
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:20,053
Of course.

184
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,923
I'll arrange for someone to call for her.

185
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,726
Then, when she sees you again...

186
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,063
...she'll be so relieved,
she'll probably fall right in your arms.

187
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:28,813
Hm.

188
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,003
She's never done that before.

189
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,047
How do I look?

You look lovely, dear.

191
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:45,014
But what about the new dress?

192
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:47,419
Yeah, the one that was so vital.

193
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,649
Oh, blue does nothing for me.

Oh, now, wait a minute.

195

For the last six weeks, I've heard nothing
but how important it was...

196
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,300
...that you should have a new dress
for this dance tonight.

197
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,936
Now that you have it,
you're not going to wear it.

198
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:03,662
Why?

199
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:06,268
It would be very difficult
to explain to you.

200
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,307
And I'm sure it would take
too much time.

201
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,707
- Come on, Melvin.
- All right, all right.

- You're coming along with us, honey?
- Oh, Father, really.

I'd be the laughingstock.

How do you like that?

205
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,916
Well, maybe we had better
wear a disguise.

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,059
Gramps.

313
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:18,706
Nobody's gonna stand up
my granddaughter. No, sirree.

314
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:20,034
Oh, you're a lamb.

315
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,336
I'll take you to the dance
and fetch you home.

316
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:24,843
And if they play a polka,
I'll even dance with you.

317
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:28,005
Oh, thanks, Gramps,
but I think that maybe I have a date.

318
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:30,083
POP:
You have, Judy.

319
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,583
Stephen, Judy.

320
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,654
- Hello, Judy.
- Hello. Gramps, this is Stephen.

321
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:36,051
Glad to know you, Gramps.

322
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,523
Always tell a mars character
the way he shakes.

323
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:39,683
Thank you, sir.

324
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:43,059
We'd better hurry, Stephen.
I don't wanna miss a minute of the dance.

325
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,700
Goodbye, Gramps. Bye, Mr. Scully.

326
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:48,326
Oh, dear.

327
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:59,875
- How about a cherry phosphate?
- Don't mind if I do.

328
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:03,810
Got anything to put a little sting in it?

329
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,968
Hey, Jo-Jo, take over for me
for a minute, will you?

330
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,172
Look.

331
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,147
Don't worry, Oogie.
Everything will be all right.

332
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:46,419
Yeah, and in the meantime,
I'm a bachelor.

333
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:58,472
Melvin, who's Judy dancing with?

334
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,841
I can't tell at this distance.

335
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,980
Well, you need glasses, Mr. Foster.

336
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:08,546
My eyes are perfect.

337
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:12,649
Judy, hey.

338
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:17,916
I think the orchestra leader
is trying to attract your attention, Judy.

339
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,082
Ignore it.

340
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:23,197
He's just someone I used to know
in my childhood.

341
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,238
Ladies and gentlemen...

342
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:37,344
...our popular 1 6-year-old singer,
Miss Judy Foster...

343
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:40,072
...will sing for you now.

344
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,309
That's despicable, that's what it is.
It's despicable.

345
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:45,817
He knows that I'm practically 1 7.

346
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:49,287
Any man who'd reveal a womars age
should be horsewhipped.

347
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,191
Would you?

348
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,828
I'd much rather hear you sing, Judy.

349
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:55,463
All right, Stephen.

350
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:59,088
But only because you want me to.

351
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,832
Your pin, Mr. Pringle.

352
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:09,034
Oh, Judy, please don't be mad at me.

353
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:12,942
I meant to pick you up.
Honest I did, but I had other things to do.

354
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:17,051
And besides, I ought to be mad at you,
coming in here late with some other guy.

355
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:20,655
Kindly, play the introduction
to "Love Is Where You Find lt."

356
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:23,916
You can't sing that tonight, Judy.
"Love Is Where You Find lt"...

357
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,027
...is the song you're gonna sing
on your parents' anniversary.

358
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:32,064
Oogie, "Love Is Where You Find lt."

359
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:36,937
Very well.

360
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:39,869
"Love Is Where You Find lt."

[SINGING]
Love is where you find it

362
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:51,745
Don't be blind

363
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:57,654
It's all around you everywhere

364
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:01,821
Take it, take a chance now

365
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:03,862
For romance now

366
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:09,561
Tell a someone that you care

367
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:13,139
Spring love comes upon you

368
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:17,369
When it's gone you feel despair

369
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:20,572
Soon, though, in the moon glow

370
00:23:20,572 --> 00:23:24,776
You'll find that a new love is there

371
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:27,683
Love is where you find it

372
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:29,585
Fate designed it

373
00:23:29,585 --> 00:23:34,286
To be waiting everywhere

374
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:42,903
It may hide from you for a while

375
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:49,738
It may come tonight in a smile

376
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:53,846
And a plea for the new love

377
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:57,473
In the arms of a new love

378
00:23:57,473 --> 00:24:00,985
Seek and you shall

Love is where you find it

Don't be blind, it's all around you

Everywhere

383
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,272
Everywhere

384
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,423
Judy, isn't there something I can do
to make up with you?

385
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,083
Yes, Mr. Pringle...

386
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:16,628
...you may borrow
some of Jo-Jo's vitamins.

387
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,301
Did you like my song, Stephen?

388
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:24,734
I thought it was wonderful.
I think you're swell.

389
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:27,739
- Oh, you're magnificent. Have some punch.
- Thank you.

390
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:31,037
Judy, you didn't sing the song
that we rehearsed this afternoon.

391
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:33,204
Oh, I'm sorry, Carol.

392
00:25:33,204 --> 00:25:37,579
But I had to sing a special song
for a special person.

393
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,653
Oh, Stephen, this is Carol Pringle.
Carol, this is Stephen.

394
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:43,222
- How do you do?
- Hello, Carol.

395
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:45,518
Judy, dear, it's time
for Mr. Cugat to arrive.

396
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:47,662
You'd better be in the door
to welcome him.

397
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:51,162
- Well, l...
- Run along. Business comes first.

398
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:53,062
I'll be right back.
Don't you go away.

399
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:55,567
Don't worry, Judy. I'll be right here.

400
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:04,211
I have a few moments to spare
if you'd care to dance.

401
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:07,348
Oh, that's very generous of you.

402
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:16,381
I don't believe I know who you are.

403
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:17,923
I'm sure you don't.

404
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:19,890
- But I know who you are.
- You do?

405
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,757
You're the prettiest girl in Santa Barbara.
That's obvious.

406
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:25,627
Well, thank you very much.

407
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:29,736
And you know it. That's also obvious.

408
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,170
That wasrt very nice, was it?

409
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,701
No, it wasrt. I'm sorry.

410
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:41,547
You spending the summer here?

411
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:45,083
I think most of it will be spent
at Scully's drug store.

412
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:48,817
Better come in sometime
and sample a malted milk.

413
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,083
I never drink malt.

414
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:54,460
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in charge of the program.

415
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:57,697
Judy, won't you listen to me
for just a minute?

416
00:26:57,697 --> 00:27:00,164
Please don't talk to me.
I've just renounced you.

417
00:27:00,164 --> 00:27:03,361
But I don't wanna be renounced.
I want you to wear my pin.

418
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:06,564
In fact, I'm going to erase
your name from my diary.

419
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:10,871
You know, Judy, sometimes
I think you don't like me at all.

420
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:15,272
- Good evening.
- Oh, Mr. Cugat.

421
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:17,714
I thought maybe
I got in the wrong place, no?

422
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:19,478
Oh, no, this is the right place.

423
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:21,519
Come with me.
I'll introduce you around.

424
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,659
- There's some other old people here too.
- Oh?

425
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,928
Who's the young man Judy's with?

426
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:31,793
His name's Stephen Andrews.
He works at Scully's drugstore.

427
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:34,025
Nice-looking fellow.

428
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:37,772
Yes, I supposed one might say that he is.

429
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,902
I'm sorry my father isn't here tonight.
He promised he'd try to come.

430
00:27:41,902 --> 00:27:44,568
Well, you know how businessmen are.

431
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:49,342
Sometimes it's very hard to find time
to go to a high school dance.

432
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:51,610
You always seem to find time,
Mr. Foster.

433
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,381
Oh, that's because I guess I'm curious.
I want to know what's going on.

434
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:58,185
I think it's very nice...

435
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:01,925
...having someone who wants
to know what's going on.

436
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:06,257
Just the opposite in our family.

437
00:28:06,257 --> 00:28:09,164
My father never knows what's going on.

438
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:12,299
Of course, he's extremely busy man.

Oh, of course he is, yes.

Sometimes I wish...

441
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,076
Sometimes I wish he werert so busy.

00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:27,379
Will you excuse me?
I'm sure Ogden needs me.

Thank you, I will.

447
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,567
My daughter, Judy,
is a great admirer of yours.

448
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:51,234
- So is her mother.
- Well, thank you, thank you.

449
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:54,211

What? A man of my age get out there...

...and make a fool of himself
like those jack-in-the-boxes?

456
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:15,436
Well, you could do
a more dignified version, dear.

457
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:21,599
Dora, look, I've been a faithful husband
to you for 1 9 years, haven't I?

- Satisfactory father to the children?
- Yes.

...perhaps your wife
will do the rumba with me?

464
00:29:41,192 --> 00:29:44,763
Oh, sure, go ahead and ask her.
You won't have to coax her.

Thank you, Mr. Cugat. I'd love it.

466
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,736
It's a shame
Mother has to dance by herself.

467
00:29:51,736 --> 00:29:54,306
- Judy?
- Yes, Father?

468
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:58,276
I don't wanna hear another word
about me learning to do that rumba.

469
00:29:58,613 --> 00:29:59,841
Yes, Father.

470
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:04,280
But I would like to hear who
the young man was you were dancing with.

471
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,511
Well, that's my dream man.

472
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:07,848
What about Oogie?

473
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,650
Oh, I just gave him up forever
for a little while.

474
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,225
- Oh, I see.
- Would you like to meet Stephen?

475
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:16,022
Well, I believe it's customary.

476
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,428
If you can get him away
from Mitzi there.

477
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:27,297
So that's what happens
when my back is turned.

478
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:30,603
Excuse me, Father.

479
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:39,778
Mitzi, dear, Oogie wants you.

480
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:42,980
Oh, well, tell him I'm busy right now.

481
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,719
Mitzi, Oogie wants you now.

482
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,793
Oh, thank you, Stephen.
It's just been wonderful.

483
00:30:52,793 --> 00:30:54,696
I'll be right back.

484
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:56,996
You do wanna dance with me,
don't you, Stephen?

485
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:59,571
It would be a pleasure, Judy.

486
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:06,146
Where's Mrs. Foster?

487
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:10,113
Out there dancing the rumba
with Mr. Cugat.

488
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:10,863
Oh.

489
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:20,019
Kind of a vulgar dance,
don't you think?

490
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:21,990
I can't do it either.

491
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,163
Mrs. Foster,
you are what we call muy guapa.

492
00:31:27,163 --> 00:31:30,634
- Oh. Is that good?
- Well, in my language...

493
00:31:30,634 --> 00:31:33,433
...it means terrific.
- Oh.

494
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:51,787
Oh, I'd spend the rest of my life
singing for you, Stephen.

495
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:54,224
I don't think Oogie
would like that very well.

496
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:56,886
- Oogie brought this all on himself.
- All right.

497
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:59,260
But don't be too rough on him.
He's a nice guy.

498
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,732
Good night.
Thank you for a very nice evening.

499
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:05,134
JUD Y: Good night, Stephen,
and thank you for a very nice evening.

500
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:09,270
- Well, good night.
- Stephen...

501
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:13,445
...do you think a girl should let a boy
kiss her on their first date?

502
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:14,877
I most certainly do not.

503
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,711
- Not even...
- Not even then, Judy.

504
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:24,047
Good night...

505
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:25,624
...sweet 1 6.

506
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:27,852
Almost 1 7.

507
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,644
If I'd taken Judy to the dance tonight,
that malt mixer wouldn't have taken her.

508
00:32:46,644 --> 00:32:49,840
And if he hadrt taken her,
she wouldn't have met him.

509
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,350
And I wouldn't be miserable
like I am now.

510
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,554
I'm sure Mr. Andrews realizes
the obvious difference in their ages.

511
00:32:56,554 --> 00:33:00,455
Maybe so. But does Judy?

512
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:02,490
She even kissed him.

513
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,060
She did?

514
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,099
I've known her all my life.

515
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,399
She's never kissed me,
except on birthdays.

516
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,534
He's better looking than I am too.

517
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:24,480
Does she really mean that much to you?

518
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,916
Sure she does.

519
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,117
She's real fine.

520
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,793
Oh, why didn't he fall for you
instead of my girl?

521
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:37,522
You haven't any heart, that's all.

522
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,393
I have a heart, Oogie.

523
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,996
It's just that I haven't had
much chance to use it.

524
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:47,705
Like...

525
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:50,571
...neither one of us
has had much chance.

526
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:54,237
I don't have anyone to talk to.

527
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:56,679
You don't have anyone to talk to.

528
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:59,547
I guess we just have
to talk to each other.

529
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,583
Oh, I wish Mother were here.

530
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:06,153
Me too.

531
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,162
I'll take care of everything, Oogie.

532
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:12,629
Oh, no, look, Carol, l...

533
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:15,769
I said I'd take care of everything.

534
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:21,998
OGDEN:
Good night.

535
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:31,781
[SINGING]
Swing low, sweet chariot

536
00:34:31,781 --> 00:34:34,683
Coming for to carry me home

537
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:38,053
She's going to swing so low,
they're going to have to carry me home.

538
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:39,989
Now, Melvin.

539
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:47,659
Your breakfast is getting cold, dear.

540
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,360
- Breakfast?
- That's right, breakfast.

541
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,529
Yeah, we're different than most families.

542
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:55,870
We have breakfast in the morning,
lunch at lunchtime and dinner at...

543
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,840
Never mind, Randolph.

544
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,843
Drink your orange juice, dear.

545
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:02,209
What did you say, Father?

546
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,508
I didn't a say a word,
it was your mother who just spoke.

547
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:10,981
- What's the matter with you, anyway?
- Hm?

548
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:14,026
Melvin, see if you can get through to her.

549
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:17,562
I'll try, Dora. It might take a little time.

550
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:21,164
Judy? Judy Foster.

551
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,367
Good morning, Father.

552
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,199
Good morning, dear ones.

553
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,840
RANDOLPH:
Whee! You got through.

554
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,806
Judy, did you and Oogie make up?

555
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:34,270
My heart belongs to Stephen.

556
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,780
I think we have a lead.

557
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:39,446
Where did you meet Stephen, dear?

558
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:42,180
I met him in a prescription booth.

559
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,387
Ah, he's a soda jerk.

560
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:49,220
I'm sorry, this household just isn't
big enough for both Randolph and me.

561
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,490
Eventually, one of us has to go.

562
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,363
Father, you'll have to make the choice.

563
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:59,097
Well, Dora, what do you think?
You have a preference?

564
00:35:59,097 --> 00:36:01,571
Well, it's something
we can't decide in a hurry.

565
00:36:01,571 --> 00:36:04,472
I think we ought to have at least
until tomorrow morning.

566
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:06,476
Now you're making fun of me.

567
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:08,774
You never take anything I say seriously.

568
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:10,611
Yes, we do, darling.

569
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:14,482
But having to make a choice between
you and Randolph is serious indeed.

570
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:17,283
Now sit down and eat your breakfast.

571
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:22,489
Why, there's a picture of Mr. Cugat.

572
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:26,528
- I hadrt seen it.
- What you need is glasses.

573
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:29,261
Dr. Lippincott can fix you up.

574
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:30,865
Oh. Ha-ha.

575
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,973
Yeah. Oh, he hasn't changed
since last night.

576
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:36,701
You know, he's a very romantic man.

577
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:39,210
He said I was muy guapa.

578
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,281
- What?
- Oh, that's a compliment.

579
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:45,242
Wow, look at that
prized string of palominos he's got.

580
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:49,378
Oh, that's nothing. I can have my face
splashed on there anytime.

581
00:36:49,378 --> 00:36:53,425
Father, you'd look perfectly ridiculous
standing beside a string of mackerel.

582
00:36:53,425 --> 00:36:55,425
And he dances divinely.

583
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:57,029
He should.

584
00:36:57,029 --> 00:37:01,259
That's his business.
My business is canning fish.

585
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:04,165
If you really loved me, Melvin,
you'd learn how to rumba.

586
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:09,970
Oh, what is my loving you
got to do with that ridiculous dance?

587
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,338
Nothing, Melvin.

588
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:14,606
Except that when I go to dances,
I like to dance...

589
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:16,875
...and I like to dance with my husband.

590
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:20,316
That reminds me, the drug store is open.
Bye, everybody.

591
00:37:20,316 --> 00:37:23,286
Where's Judy? Why didn't she
come down for breakfast?

592
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:26,949
Nothing like a quiet breakfast
with the Fosters, is there?

593
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:29,925
- Melvin?
- Mm-hm?

594
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:31,325
I love you.

595
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:34,491
Even if you can't rumba like Mr. Cugat.

596
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:38,969
Muy guapa sounds like birdseed.

597
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:40,266
How was the dance?

598
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:43,467
It was fine. I met a lot of nice people.

599
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:47,370
Say, Pop, do you know a girl
by the name of Carol Pringle?

600
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,846
Sure, sure.
Everybody knows the Pringles.

601
00:37:49,846 --> 00:37:51,507
She never comes in here, though.

602
00:37:51,507 --> 00:37:54,018
Not since she grew out
of her bobby socks, anyway.

603
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:55,678
CAROL:
Good morning, Mr. Scully.

604
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,017
Met a lot of nice people, huh?

605
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,560
Hello, Miss Pringle.

606
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,164
I haven't seen you for some time.
How's your father?

607
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:06,891
Well, he's fine, thank you.

608
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:10,634
Anything I can do for you?

609
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:15,370
I thought perhaps Judy would be here.
I wanted to talk to her.

610
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,274
Well, she isn't here,
but I'm reasonably sure she will be.

611
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:21,380
Hello.

612
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,107
Hello.

613
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:25,943
Didrt know I was artistic, did you?

614
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:27,747
I know very little about you.

615
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:31,121
Go ahead, eat it.

616
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:37,631
There ought to be more
fancy ice cream sundaes in everybody's life.

617
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:39,231
- Thanks.
- Hi, Carol.

618
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:40,958
- Hello, Stephen.
- Hello, Judy.

619
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:42,966
- That looks yummy.
- Would you like it?

620
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:45,162
No, thanks. I came to talk to Stephen.

I finally convinced Father to let you

your father to sponsor it.

can get along very well without my help.

Oh, but I'm sure your voice
would double his sales, Judy.

Gee, I don't know.

- And you better forget about the martinis.

Yes, miss.

Judy, how wonderful to see you,
both of you.

777
00:48:01,054 --> 00:48:03,355
It was so nice of you
to invite us to dinner.

778
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:07,432
I'm so glad you could come.
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

779
00:48:07,432 --> 00:48:10,001
- Oh, where's Oogie?
- He won't be here for dinner.

780
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:12,334
- He won't?
- He won't?

00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:14,440
CAROL:
He'll be here later.

782
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:19,467
Just because he lives here,
I don't see why he should always be here.

783
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,811
Dinner is served, Miss Carol.

784
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:24,883
Thank you, Jameson. Shall we?

785
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:27,982
We thank you for this food...

786
00:48:27,982 --> 00:48:33,422
...and for the privilege of eating it together
and in peace. Amen.

you always manage to get here...

00:48:52,338 --> 00:48:54,503
...just when everybody's eating dinner.

Oh, no, nothing at all.

- Will you have dinner with us, Oogie?
- Sure, thank you.

800

- Isn't Judy here?
- No, Judy won't be here for dinner.

801
00:49:11,064 --> 00:49:14,700
- She's having dinner with your sister.
- She is?

802
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,565
So that's why she wanted me
to eat at the drugstore.

803
00:49:18,565 --> 00:49:21,640
Yeah, she wanted me to leave
so that she could talk to Judy.

804
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,299
If I were at the house,
she couldn't talk to Judy...

805
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:27,276
...so therefore she asked me to leave.
See what I mean?

806
00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:30,610
No, I don't see what you mean.
I'll take your word for it, though.

807
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:34,550
That must be it.
Sure, she's fixing everything up.

you're wanted on the telephone.

Oh, thanks. You see, it's just like I told you.
Excuse me.

She does? Yeah-hoo!

- Hi, Judy. Why did you stop?
- The mood's been broken.

on your father's station.

I'll bet father doesn't.

He won't even let me
inside the station.

When I was just a little girl

But fate plays many funny tricks

Of course I do, Oogie.

Well, the least you can do when
a man asks you to marry him is be polite.

Mr. Pringle, I feel that I'm under
no obligation to you whatsoever...

...as far as marriage is concerned.

911
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:47,030
I'm an adult now
and I must conduct myself accordingly.

912
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:50,565
- What? Judy, are you hurt?
- You pushed me.

913
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:52,728
Pushed you?
How can you say such a thing?

00:54:52,728 --> 00:54:55,397
Don't you ever speak to me again.

915

00:55:34,905 --> 00:55:36,708
You're beautiful.

927
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,817
It's almost too beautiful.

928
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:43,120
You have youth, education,
a lovely home.

929
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:47,224
With all these things, why do you
have to try so hard to impress people?

930
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:51,360
- Is that the way you feel about me?
- I'm afraid it is.

931
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,898
- Then I think you're very rude.
- And I think you're very spoiled.

932
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:57,866
I'm not interested in your personal opinion,
Mr. Andrews.

933
00:55:57,866 --> 00:56:02,031
That's a good sign. It's the first time
I've seen you follow a natural impulse.

934
00:56:02,031 --> 00:56:06,702
If I followed my natural impulse,
I'd push you in the flowerbed. Good night.

935
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,916
- Where's Judy?
- She's upstairs.

936
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:13,780
And will you tell her I didn't push her?

937
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:15,844
Women.

938
00:56:15,844 --> 00:56:18,081
I know what you mean.

939
00:56:18,425 --> 00:56:22,418
Look, Steve, you wouldn't take my girl
away from me, would you?

940
00:56:22,418 --> 00:56:24,654
Why, you bet your life I wouldn't, Oogie.

941
00:56:24,654 --> 00:56:26,924
I wouldn't have a chance
even if I wanted to.

942
00:56:26,924 --> 00:56:27,674
No?

943

When a girl goes to all the trouble
Judy does to make you jealous...

00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,530
...that's true love.

Gee, I never thought of that.

946

Steve, you're a man of the world.

947
00:56:38,468 --> 00:56:41,637
Do you think Judy will be easier
to understand as she gets older?

948
00:56:41,637 --> 00:56:44,784
Don't try to understand women, Oogie,
just accept them.

949
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:46,543
I guess that would be easier.

950
00:56:46,543 --> 00:56:49,745
And, Oogie, would you mind taking
Judy home when she comes down?

951
00:56:49,745 --> 00:56:52,915
- I gotta go back to work.
- Oh, glad to, Steve. Glad to.

952

- Tell Carol good night for me, will you?
- You bet. Come back again, Steve.

- Anytime, anytime at all.
- Thanks, Oogie.

Good night, Steve, old boy.

Could you fix me a double-decker
ham-and-cheese sandwich, please?

- I'll try, sir. And a glass of milk?
- Yeah.

959
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:18,378
Let's make it four-decker.

960
00:57:18,378 --> 00:57:21,452
Four? Yes, sir.

Carol?

962
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:27,491
You know much more
about men than I do.

963
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:29,252
Tell me about them, will you?

964
00:57:29,252 --> 00:57:31,397
There's little to tell, Judy.

965
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:34,192
If you know one man, you know them all.

966
00:57:34,192 --> 00:57:36,335
Of course, Stephers different.

967
00:57:37,137 --> 00:57:39,071
Stephers a man, Judy.

968
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,902
And once a person is a man,
there's nothing anyone can do about it.

969
00:57:42,902 --> 00:57:44,907
Oh, I don't wanna do anything about it.

970
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:48,914
The pathetic part of it all
is they never improve with age.

971
00:57:49,649 --> 00:57:52,311
In fact, they get worse.

972
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:57,923
Shakespeare once said,
"A man in his time plays many parts.

973
00:57:57,923 --> 00:57:59,752
His acts being seven ages."

974
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:04,825
Of course, I never did see
eye-to-eye with Shakespeare.

975
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:07,865
As far as I'm concerned,
there are but three ages:

976
00:58:07,865 --> 00:58:11,333
Youth, middle age and infirmity.

977
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:17,331
It's the middle age we have to be aware of
because that's the critical age.

978
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:19,671
Oh, but Stephers not middle-aged.

979
00:58:19,671 --> 00:58:23,612
He isn't now, but he will be someday.

980
00:58:23,612 --> 00:58:25,808
All men reach it.

981
00:58:26,286 --> 00:58:28,186
My father did.

982
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:31,389
Believe me, Judy.
Then they are a problem.

How do you know
when they reach that critical age?

985
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,025
Oh, by little things.

986
00:58:40,025 --> 00:58:42,464
Sudden changes in their habits.

987
00:58:42,464 --> 00:58:45,331
They start throwing money away like mad.

988
00:58:45,331 --> 00:58:49,202
Maybe something as minor
as a sudden obsession for bright clothes.

989
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,038
In my father's case...

990
00:58:52,038 --> 00:58:56,308
...it was a desire
for monogrammed silk shirts.

991
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,415
Oh, I had a terrible two years.

992
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,386
Oh, I think my father
skipped that critical age.

993
00:59:03,386 --> 00:59:07,048
He doesn't do any of those things,
particularly throw money away.

994
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:09,320
But you never can tell, Judy.

Well, no, not right then.

You'll wear yourself out.

This time, Oogie,
I think I'm the one who's at fault.

I can't tell anybody.

Of course I trust you, Carol.

1273

It's just that...

...turn out to be just like the ones
you think aren't wonderful.

Please forgive me, Judy.

1277
01:14:40,858 --> 01:14:44,555
I don't know how it happened.
I didn't want it to.

1278
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:46,587
It just did.

1279
01:14:46,587 --> 01:14:49,824
I didn't think it was possible to fall in love
with anyone so fast.

1280
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:52,865
I wanted so to tell someone.

1281
01:14:52,865 --> 01:14:57,337
There wasrt anyone to tell.
Anyway, I don't think he even likes me.

01:14:57,942 --> 01:14:59,534
What are you talking about, Carol?

to put men completely out of my life...

1286

...l'd be very angry with you.
Very angry indeed.

1287
01:15:14,692 --> 01:15:18,594
I guess it must be his age.
It's caught up with him.

1288
01:15:19,363 --> 01:15:20,853
I'm talking about my father.

1289
01:15:21,565 --> 01:15:24,466
Your father? What are you saying?

1290
01:15:24,466 --> 01:15:26,694
He's hiding a woman in his office.

1291
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:29,062
Oh, you must be mistaken.

1292

Your father is wonderful.

1293
01:15:31,037 --> 01:15:34,735
- He wouldn't do anything like that.
- This isn't the first time either.

1294
01:15:34,735 --> 01:15:37,142
She'll probably be there tomorrow too.

Carol, what shall I do?
I can't tell Mother.

1296
01:15:39,407 --> 01:15:42,711
- No, you mustrt do that.
- Tomorrow is their wedding anniversary.

1297
01:15:43,921 --> 01:15:45,786
Well, there must be some reason.

1298
01:15:45,786 --> 01:15:49,323
There has to be a reason.
How's his home life?

1299
01:15:49,927 --> 01:15:51,952
Father says it's noisy.

1300
01:15:52,329 --> 01:15:54,456
Usually when a man turns
to another woman...

1301
01:15:54,456 --> 01:15:57,192
...it's because something's lacking
in his home life.

1302
01:15:57,192 --> 01:15:59,598
He's seeking a change.

1303
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:03,633
- Maybe he doesn't get enough affection.
- Of course he gets enough affection.

1304
01:16:03,633 --> 01:16:06,901
We think he's the most wonderful father
in the world.

1305
01:16:07,745 --> 01:16:09,770
At least he was.

1306

Oh, Judy, we can't let this happen.

1307
01:16:13,216 --> 01:16:15,545
Not to your home.

- Father would think it looks dreadful.

As long as the dinner is good,
your father won't notice my hair.

It's terribly important to a man
how a womars hair looks.

1320
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:14,408
It's important to your father
how his food tastes.

You spend too much time in the kitchen.

to his aesthetic senses than to his stomach.

01:20:18,921 --> 01:20:22,930
So it is. And do you know
what else is going to happen tomorrow?

1382
01:20:23,634 --> 01:20:25,932
What else is going to happen?

1383
01:20:25,932 --> 01:20:27,866
You'd like to know, wouldn't you, huh?

1384
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:30,700
- You're going to increase my allowance?
- Randolph.

1385
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,002
I'm going to surprise you all.

1386
01:20:34,002 --> 01:20:35,202
A surprise?

1387
01:20:35,202 --> 01:20:37,711
Melvin, how wonderful. I adore surprises.

1388
01:20:37,711 --> 01:20:41,612
Yes, sir. A surprise to end all surprises.

1389
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:44,978
Another one?

1390
01:20:45,522 --> 01:20:49,618
Oh, no. They're very good, though,
Mr. Andrews. Very Good.

1391
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:54,794
You've been doing this sort of thing,
I presume, for some time?

1392
01:20:54,794 --> 01:20:57,058
No, just for a couple of days, in fact.

1393
01:20:57,058 --> 01:20:58,701
I see.

1394
01:20:59,903 --> 01:21:01,894
Going to make this your lifework?

1395
01:21:01,894 --> 01:21:02,644
No.

1396
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,872
Got something else to do, is that it?

1397
01:21:05,872 --> 01:21:07,408
- Yes.
- What?

1398
01:21:09,746 --> 01:21:11,407
Look, Jameson...

1399
01:21:11,407 --> 01:21:15,484
...as a private investigator,
you couldn't get a job on a soap opera.

1400
01:21:16,186 --> 01:21:18,245
Yes, sir. I suppose you're right.

1401
01:21:18,245 --> 01:21:20,947
- Who sent you?
- Oh, I'm not at liberty to tell, sir.

1402
01:21:20,947 --> 01:21:26,460
- It couldn't be Carol's father, could it?
- Yes, sir. I mean no, sir.

1403
01:21:27,431 --> 01:21:28,955
Yes, sir.

1404
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:32,226
Why should Mr. Pringle care
how long I've been mixing malted milks?

1405
01:21:32,436 --> 01:21:34,427
JAMESON:
After all, Carol's his only daughter.

1406
01:21:34,427 --> 01:21:38,063
He has to be careful of the kind of people
she becomes involved with.

1407
01:21:38,675 --> 01:21:41,667
STEPHEN: Go on.
- Well, it's just a routine sort of thing.

1408
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:46,145
He's naturally interested in,
shall we say, your background.

1409
01:21:46,145 --> 01:21:48,079
Yes, let's do.

1410
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:50,618
You can understand
his feelings on the matter.

1411
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:53,278
His daughter's welfare
would be his first concern.

1412
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:55,417
It would, eh?

1413
01:21:59,096 --> 01:22:01,621
Take care of him, Pop. I'll be right back.

1414
01:22:12,542 --> 01:22:17,946
Mr. Pringle is busy and can't be disturbed.
Perhaps this afternoon he'll talk to you.

1415
01:22:17,946 --> 01:22:20,845
Would you please tell Mr. Pringle
I wish to speak to him.

1416
01:22:20,845 --> 01:22:25,648
- Do you have an appointment?
- Just tell him Stephen I. Andrews is here.

1417
01:22:27,157 --> 01:22:28,954
Mr. Stephen Andrews is here, sir.

1418
01:22:28,954 --> 01:22:30,115
LUCIEN:
Not now, I'm busy.

1419
01:22:30,115 --> 01:22:33,024
WOMAN: But he's already on his way in,
Mr. Pringle.

1420
01:22:34,264 --> 01:22:36,198
LUCIEN:
It's customary to knock before you enter.

1421
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:39,961
I didn't know you were interested
in courtesies or I would have knocked.

1422
01:22:39,961 --> 01:22:41,968
Now, just a moment.
What is it you want?

1423
01:22:41,968 --> 01:22:44,437
I wanna save you
a little time and expense.

1424
01:22:44,437 --> 01:22:46,007
My name is Stephen I. Andrews.

1425
01:22:46,007 --> 01:22:48,269
I weigh 1 70 pounds
and my health is excellent.

1426
01:22:48,269 --> 01:22:51,005
I spent two years in college,
three years in the Navy.

1427
01:22:51,005 --> 01:22:53,706
I'm working my way through school
to become a doctor.

1428
01:22:53,706 --> 01:22:56,512
- That's fine.
- I believe in God. I believe in my country.

1429
01:22:56,512 --> 01:22:59,383
And I don't think the younger generatiors
going to the dogs.

1430
01:22:59,383 --> 01:23:02,081
I play a good game of tennis.
My swimming gets by.

1431
01:23:02,081 --> 01:23:04,750
- Well, that's...
- My parents were born in Missouri...

1432
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,828
...and have lived there for 46 years.

1433
01:23:06,828 --> 01:23:09,557
Unless they've done something
in the past two weeks...

1434
01:23:09,557 --> 01:23:13,362
...to disgrace the name of Andrews,
you'll find them respectable people...

1435
01:23:13,362 --> 01:23:16,005
...who have an interest
in what their sons are doing.

1436
01:23:16,005 --> 01:23:19,540
And if you'll excuse my saying so, sir,
if you'd do the same thing...

1437
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,770
...you wouldn't send your butler out
asking silly questions...

1438
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:25,540
...because you'd know yourself
what was going on.

1439
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,741
Now, any further questions, Mr. Pringle?

1440
01:23:27,741 --> 01:23:31,445
Yes, I have.
Just what is your interest in my daughter?

1441
01:23:31,445 --> 01:23:35,887
She's one of the most beautiful, spoiled
egotistical girls I've ever had to meet.

1442
01:23:35,887 --> 01:23:39,358
Now that I've met you,
I understand better why she is as she is.

1443
01:23:39,358 --> 01:23:41,656
- Anything else?
- That's enough.

1444
01:23:41,656 --> 01:23:43,663
Then good day, sir.

1445
01:23:52,476 --> 01:23:54,341
Mr. Pringle, what are you doing home?

1446
01:23:54,341 --> 01:23:56,445
What's surprising
about coming to dinner?

1447
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:58,843
Why, nothing, sir. Nothing.
Did you say dinner?

1448
01:23:58,843 --> 01:24:01,576
Yes. Now, whatever's prepared,
make it for three.

1449
01:24:01,576 --> 01:24:02,912
Yes, sir, three.

1450
01:24:02,912 --> 01:24:05,646
And tell my family
I want to see them in the library.

1451
01:24:05,646 --> 01:24:07,346
Yes, sir.

1452
01:24:07,824 --> 01:24:11,590
And I've got something
to say to you too later.

1453
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,320
Yes, sir.

1454
01:24:24,908 --> 01:24:26,933
You see...

1455
01:24:26,933 --> 01:24:31,308
...I realized I haven't been
a very good father and...

1456
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,724
Good evening, Father.

1457
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:49,599
Good evening, Carol. Good evening.

1458
01:24:50,867 --> 01:24:54,166
You look lovely tonight, Carol.
You really do.

1459
01:24:55,105 --> 01:24:59,633
And you've grown too.
You certainly have.

1460
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:02,936
Wort you come in and sit down?

1461
01:25:07,384 --> 01:25:08,578
OGDEN:
Good evening, Father.

1462
01:25:08,578 --> 01:25:10,447
Oh, Ogden, my boy.

1463
01:25:10,447 --> 01:25:13,680
Come in, come in.

1464
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:16,592
Sit down, sit down.

1465
01:25:17,127 --> 01:25:19,118
You know, I thought perhaps we might...

1466
01:25:19,118 --> 01:25:22,060
...have a little sort of family
get-together before dinner.

1467
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:25,724
It won't take long.
Sort of get acquainted with one another.

1468
01:25:25,724 --> 01:25:31,738
You know, it's just wonderful
to be home with one's family.

1469
01:25:31,975 --> 01:25:33,840
Just wonderful.

1470
01:25:34,344 --> 01:25:37,507
Father, I thought you had
a board of directors' meeting tonight.

1471
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:41,777
Well, to tell you the truth, I did,
but I decided they could meet without me.

1472
01:25:41,777 --> 01:25:44,978
You see, I think my family
should come first.

1473
01:25:45,789 --> 01:25:47,381
Ogden, I've been thinking.

1474
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:50,549
How would you like to go
on a fishing trip up in the mountains?

1475
01:25:50,549 --> 01:25:52,285
Just the two of us.

1476
01:25:52,285 --> 01:25:54,089
We could cook our own meals.

1477
01:25:54,089 --> 01:25:57,927
Of course, they probably won't be
very good. I was never much of a cook.

1478
01:25:57,927 --> 01:26:00,763
But I might be a lot of fun.
Don't you think so, son?

1479
01:26:01,404 --> 01:26:03,429
Well, yes, sir.

1480
01:26:03,429 --> 01:26:05,074
If you say so, sir.

1481
01:26:07,077 --> 01:26:09,978
Ogden, you know that "sir"
sort of frightens me.

1482
01:26:09,978 --> 01:26:12,741
Do you think maybe you could say "Dad"?

1483
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:16,178
Yes, sir. Dad.

1484
01:26:16,987 --> 01:26:20,047
Say, I have an idea. How do you feel
about seeing a show tonight?

1485
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:23,351
We could make it a party. Ogden...

1486
01:26:23,627 --> 01:26:29,566
Oogie, you might call Judy.
Nice girl, Judy. She might like to go along.

1487
01:26:29,566 --> 01:26:33,100
Oh, no, I can't call her.

1488
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:36,637
You see, we've separated.

1489
01:26:36,637 --> 01:26:41,140
Well, of course, if that's the way
you feel about her, it's all right with me.

1490
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:42,903
How about you, Carol?

1491
01:26:42,903 --> 01:26:45,707
I've been thinking about that young man,
Stephen.

1492
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:49,374
Seems like a fine young man.
Good qualities.

1493
01:26:49,719 --> 01:26:52,882
Of course, I realize you're a little young...

1494
01:26:52,882 --> 01:26:58,255
...but I would have no objections
if after a while you...

1495
01:26:58,255 --> 01:26:59,588
Why don't you phone him?

1496
01:26:59,588 --> 01:27:02,391
Maybe he'd like to go to the show
with us.

1497
01:27:02,391 --> 01:27:04,864
I'd rather not.

1498
01:27:04,864 --> 01:27:08,766
I'm sure Stephen has no interest in me
whatsoever.

1499
01:27:09,172 --> 01:27:10,332
Nor I in him.

1500
01:27:10,332 --> 01:27:14,170
Oh, well, of course if that's the way
you feel about him, Carol...

1501
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:16,335
...it's perfectly all right with me.

1502
01:27:17,247 --> 01:27:20,182
Father, did something go wrong
at the office today?

1503
01:27:20,182 --> 01:27:22,648
No, no, everything's fine.

1504
01:27:23,587 --> 01:27:25,145
Dinner is served.

1505
01:27:25,145 --> 01:27:27,153
Thank you. Thank you, Jameson.

1506
01:27:27,153 --> 01:27:29,519
Will you excuse me?
I'll be right with you.

1507
01:27:29,519 --> 01:27:32,025
Of course, dear. Come on, son.

1508
01:27:38,802 --> 01:27:40,702
Oh, Judy...! Oh.

1509
01:27:40,702 --> 01:27:42,861
- Hello.
- Hello, Judy?

1510
01:27:42,861 --> 01:27:45,098
Something frightening's just happened.

1511
01:27:45,098 --> 01:27:47,675
Father came home to dinner.

1512
01:27:47,877 --> 01:27:49,105
Yes.

1513
01:27:49,105 --> 01:27:51,770
He isn't acting a bit normal.

1514
01:27:51,982 --> 01:27:53,609
And that isn't all.

1515
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:57,913
He practically came right out
and said it was time I was getting married.

1516
01:27:58,421 --> 01:28:00,286
I think he wants to get rid of me.

1517
01:28:00,991 --> 01:28:03,152
Carol, I know just how you feel.

1518
01:28:03,152 --> 01:28:05,590
I think Father's trying
to get rid of me too.

1519
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:10,062
At dinnertime, he kept telling me
what a wonderful young man Oogie is.

1520
01:28:10,062 --> 01:28:11,757
Yes, he did.

1521
01:28:12,269 --> 01:28:13,793
Parents are such great responsibilities.

1522
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,215
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1523
01:28:34,424 --> 01:28:37,086
OGDEN [SINGING]:
In my heart

1524
01:28:37,086 --> 01:28:43,927
There's only room for Judaline

1525
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:49,169
I've seen orchids

1526
01:28:49,169 --> 01:28:55,039
Try to bloom like Judaline

1527
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:55,999
Judaline

1528
01:28:58,515 --> 01:29:04,215
Golden hair and an angel face

1529
01:29:04,215 --> 01:29:09,950
Spring for me is in her embrace

1530
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:12,560
What a glow

1531
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,760
To know that she is mine

1532
01:29:18,868 --> 01:29:20,199
Ain't she divine?

1533
01:29:22,839 --> 01:29:26,172
Beautiful to look at

1534
01:29:26,172 --> 01:29:27,072
Are my Judy's eyes

1535
01:29:33,983 --> 01:29:36,577
Bright as stars

1536
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:37,977
When only two are in the sky

1537
01:29:45,895 --> 01:29:51,891
When there's Judy, there's melody

1538
01:29:52,769 --> 01:29:57,934
While there's Judy, there's love for me

1539
01:29:57,934 --> 01:29:59,034
And the sun will shine

1540
01:30:04,481 --> 01:30:06,813
Judaline

1541
01:30:06,813 --> 01:30:07,773
Judaline

1542
01:30:12,956 --> 01:30:15,288
Hey, Judy. Judy, I gotta talk to you.

1543
01:30:16,459 --> 01:30:18,950
Whatever you have to say
can keep till morning.

1544
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:21,154
No, it can't. I gotta see you right away.

1545
01:30:21,154 --> 01:30:25,097
For heavers sakes,
go on down and talk to him.

1546
01:30:25,097 --> 01:30:27,327
All right, Father.

1547
01:30:28,438 --> 01:30:30,372
Okay, thanks, fellas.
You can go home now.

1548
01:30:30,372 --> 01:30:32,007
And don't make any noise.

1549
01:30:32,007 --> 01:30:35,702
This is the silliest thing I ever heard of.

1550
01:30:41,384 --> 01:30:45,480
Oogie, it isn't that I didn't enjoy the song.
It was very nice.

1551
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,488
But did you have to wake up
the whole neighborhood with it?

1552
01:30:48,488 --> 01:30:50,558
Gee, I'm sorry, Judy.

1553
01:30:50,558 --> 01:30:52,854
I had to see you, though, to say goodbye.

1554
01:30:52,854 --> 01:30:55,725
Goodbye? Well, where you going?

1555
01:30:55,725 --> 01:30:58,094
Going on a fishing trip with my father.

1556
01:30:58,094 --> 01:31:00,168
But what about the radio show?

1557
01:31:00,168 --> 01:31:02,031
You mean, I shouldn't leave?

1558
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,164
I don't care if you leave or not.

1559
01:31:05,164 --> 01:31:07,969
If you wanna walk out on a business deal,
you go ahead.

1560
01:31:07,969 --> 01:31:10,135
I shouldn't expect loyalty from you,
anyway.

1561
01:31:10,135 --> 01:31:13,680
Judy Foster, I've been loyal and true to you
for years.

1562
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:17,308
Ever since the first time I met you
and you ran over me with your tricycle.

1563
01:31:17,854 --> 01:31:20,015
And you've been running over me
ever since.

1564
01:31:20,015 --> 01:31:22,215
But things have changed.
I've grown up.

1565
01:31:22,215 --> 01:31:25,987
And when you grow up
and can quit acting like a child, call me.

1566
01:31:25,987 --> 01:31:28,824
I may be waiting for you and I may not.

1567
01:31:28,824 --> 01:31:32,764
And in the meantime, I have many
important things to take care of.

1568
01:31:32,764 --> 01:31:36,303
One of them is to go on a fishing trip
with my dad.

1569
01:31:36,303 --> 01:31:38,270
We're going alone, just the two of us.

1570
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:42,275
And we don't need any women around to
tells us what we can and what we can't do.

1571
01:31:42,275 --> 01:31:45,312
I maybe back in time for the radio show
and I may not.

1572
01:31:45,312 --> 01:31:47,746
So good night, Judy, and goodbye.

1573
01:31:48,651 --> 01:31:51,586
Attaboy, Oogie,
that's the way to talk to them.

1574
01:31:51,586 --> 01:31:54,587
Always keep the upper hand.

1575
01:31:54,891 --> 01:31:57,121
I don't know which one
is more middle-aged.

1576
01:32:07,937 --> 01:32:11,896
You'll be the sensation tonight, Mr. Foster.
I'm so glad for you, so glad.

1577
01:32:11,896 --> 01:32:15,602
Well, I'm happy
I don't have to earn a living doing that.

1578
01:32:15,602 --> 01:32:17,575
It's much easier selling fish.

1579
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:21,774
Well, you do it for a living,
it is like selling fish.

1580
01:32:22,585 --> 01:32:24,746
Hope that you're not late
for your rehearsal...

1581
01:32:24,746 --> 01:32:28,049
...and that Mr. Cugat
won't be angry with you.

1582
01:32:28,049 --> 01:32:31,352
Cugie, angry?
Oh, no, he never gets angry.

1583
01:32:31,352 --> 01:32:33,894
He's sweet and kind just like you,
Mr. Foster.

1584
01:32:33,894 --> 01:32:37,032
Always a gentleman.
He's gentle as a kitten.

1585
01:32:37,032 --> 01:32:39,293
- And we'll be married pretty soon.
- No.

1586
01:32:39,293 --> 01:32:41,801
- Yes.
- Isn't that wonderful.

1587
01:32:41,801 --> 01:32:45,202
Well, I hope your married life
is as happy as mine has been.

1588
01:32:45,202 --> 01:32:49,971
It will be. If it's not,
I hit Cugie right on the head.

1589
01:32:50,914 --> 01:32:51,938
Yes, Mr. Foster?

1590
01:32:51,938 --> 01:32:56,381
Miss Rosita and I are going to the hotel
for the wedding-anniversary dinner tonight.

1591
01:32:56,381 --> 01:33:00,216
- You can take the rest of the day off.
- Thank you, Mr. Foster. I'd love to.

1592
01:33:00,216 --> 01:33:04,349
- Good luck. And congratulations.
- Thank you ever so much.

1593
01:33:25,815 --> 01:33:27,373
I'm going home to tell Mother.

1594
01:33:27,373 --> 01:33:29,279
Oh, no, Judy, you mustrt do that.

1595
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:32,285
Not on the day
of her wedding anniversary.

1596
01:33:32,488 --> 01:33:36,117
In fact, I'm not sure
you should ever tell her.

1597
01:33:36,659 --> 01:33:39,423
Maybe somehow there's been a mistake.

1598
01:33:39,423 --> 01:33:41,223
Maybe.

1599
01:33:41,664 --> 01:33:43,632
There's no mistake.

1600
01:33:43,933 --> 01:33:46,333
I think she has a right to know.

1601
01:33:46,669 --> 01:33:50,127
Then at least wait
until after the party tonight.

1602
01:33:51,374 --> 01:33:52,932
All right.

1603
01:33:53,643 --> 01:33:57,306
Carol, you won't hold of this against me.

1604
01:33:57,306 --> 01:33:59,744
Of course not, Judy.

1605
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:02,117
Who knows?

1606
01:34:02,117 --> 01:34:05,550
I may be coming to you
with the same kind of problem.

1607
01:34:11,527 --> 01:34:17,488
So my Rosita, my dove, my little pigeon,
the light of my life, she's late again, eh?

1608
01:34:17,488 --> 01:34:21,125
You think you're so good you don't
have to come to rehearsal, no?

1609
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:25,604
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

1610
01:34:27,176 --> 01:34:29,667
Cugie, he's just a little bit upset.
Just a little.

1611
01:34:29,667 --> 01:34:32,144
And don't go away.
He does not stay angry long.

1612
01:34:32,144 --> 01:34:33,714
I'll show you.

1613
01:34:33,714 --> 01:34:36,613
Now, you're not going to stay
angry long with your baby?

1614
01:34:36,613 --> 01:34:39,220
Well, I'll forgive you.
This last time I forgive you.

1615
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:42,449
But you better don't forget
a single word of your song.

1616
01:34:42,449 --> 01:34:45,389
You see? His bite is worst than his bark.

1617
01:34:45,389 --> 01:34:49,691
Now I rehearse my song, then
you talk about your dinner tonight, huh?

1618
01:34:49,691 --> 01:34:51,197
There.

1619
01:34:51,197 --> 01:34:52,425
Nice.

1620
01:34:53,603 --> 01:34:57,437
Pancho, go down with eight
and come up with the downbeat.

1621
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:06,373
[SINGING]
I love the Latin music of Señor Cugat

1622
01:35:06,373 --> 01:35:09,313
He's got the kind of a zip
That only a few got

1623
01:35:09,313 --> 01:35:11,476
The music is romantic

1624
01:35:12,488 --> 01:35:14,479
The music is exciting

1625
01:35:15,258 --> 01:35:17,590
But I like a little better what you got

1626
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:20,752
Not Cugat, but what you got

1627
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:23,662
Not Cugat, but what you got

1628
01:35:30,073 --> 01:35:31,506
Ahh...

1629
01:35:31,506 --> 01:35:33,835
That's the kind of the music. I like it.

1630
01:35:33,835 --> 01:35:35,944
It talks to my skin.

1631
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:38,979
I'm a jitterbug and I'm hot as a pipe

1632
01:35:38,979 --> 01:35:42,276
I want to tell you, brother
I'm the bobby-sock type

1633
01:35:42,276 --> 01:35:45,512
I'm a red tomato and I'm overly ripe

1634
01:35:46,989 --> 01:35:48,957
I'm cooking with gas

1635
01:35:55,264 --> 01:35:58,358
I got a mellow fellow
And he's right on the track

1636
01:35:58,358 --> 01:36:01,367
And I'm so tutti-fruitti
That I holler, "Hey, Mack"

1637
01:36:01,904 --> 01:36:05,032
Beats me up, Barry
And I'll beat you right back

1638
01:36:06,609 --> 01:36:08,304
I'm cooking with gas

1639
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:11,675
Dig, dig, dig, deep right in the grove

1640
01:36:11,675 --> 01:36:14,408
Then send me boy with a boot and a boat

1641
01:36:15,852 --> 01:36:17,547
I got some fish in my food

1642
01:36:17,547 --> 01:36:20,712
I don't know what the heck
That I'm talking about

1643
01:36:27,597 --> 01:36:30,430
I'm an alligator and I'm sharp as a bug

1644
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:33,228
I like to boogie-woogie
Like to chew up a rug

1645
01:36:33,228 --> 01:36:36,929
I'm very, very groove
And I'm a hot chili pep

1646
01:36:38,574 --> 01:36:39,871
I'm cooking with gas

1647
01:36:52,855 --> 01:36:56,814
Oh, Dig, dig, dig, deep right in the grove

1648
01:36:56,814 --> 01:36:59,518
Then send me boy with a boot and a boat

1649
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:02,695
I've got some fish in my food

1650
01:37:02,695 --> 01:37:05,698
I don't know what the heck
That I'm talking about

1651
01:37:05,698 --> 01:37:08,701
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I like it

1652
01:37:09,172 --> 01:37:12,073
- Do you dig me?
- Yes, I dig you

1653
01:37:12,073 --> 01:37:15,404
- Is it murder?
- Sure, it's murder

1654
01:37:15,404 --> 01:37:18,911
- Will you swing it?
- Yes, I will

1655
01:37:22,051 --> 01:37:26,112
I'm the zootiest chick this side of Brazil

1656
01:37:26,112 --> 01:37:28,223
Yes, sir.

1657
01:37:40,102 --> 01:37:41,729
DORA:
Come in.

1658
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:46,706
Oh, Judy, dear, come in.

1659
01:37:48,144 --> 01:37:51,477
Will you please excuse us?
I'd like to talk to Mother alone.

1660
01:37:51,477 --> 01:37:54,878
I'm practically downstairs right now,
Miss Judy.

1661
01:37:54,878 --> 01:37:58,350
My, oh, my.
Doesrt she look just like a bride to be?

1662
01:37:59,422 --> 01:38:01,652
Thank you, Nightingale.

1663
01:38:03,593 --> 01:38:05,618
- Mother?
- Hm?

1664
01:38:06,562 --> 01:38:08,928
Do you love Father very much?

1665
01:38:08,928 --> 01:38:10,963
Very much, Judy.

1666
01:38:10,963 --> 01:38:13,294
Very, very much.

1667
01:38:14,637 --> 01:38:17,333
When a woman loves a man terribly...

1668
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:21,374
...and finds out that he doesn't love her
like she thought he did...

1669
01:38:21,844 --> 01:38:24,005
...what happens then, Mom?

1670
01:38:25,514 --> 01:38:29,450
Well, at my age it might
very well be a tragedy.

1671
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:33,680
But at your age, honey,
it's just all part of growing up.

1672
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:37,019
Learning about people,
learning about a lot of things.

1673
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:41,024
Whatever problem you have,
we'll work out together.

1674
01:38:41,464 --> 01:38:44,160
Now, this is no time to be sad.

1675
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,860
We're all going out to dinner
and have a grand time, aren't we?

1676
01:38:48,938 --> 01:38:51,668
- Of course we are, but this is much...
- Ready, Dora?

1677
01:38:51,668 --> 01:38:54,435
- Practically ready, Melvin.
- Good evening, Father.

1678
01:38:54,435 --> 01:38:58,011
Oh, such formality.
Good evening, Miss Foster.

1679
01:38:58,011 --> 01:38:59,272
Will we do?

1680
01:38:59,272 --> 01:39:03,179
I'm looking at the two
most beautiful women in the world.

1681
01:39:03,653 --> 01:39:05,553
- Thanks, Melvin.
- Thank you, Father.

1682
01:39:05,553 --> 01:39:10,249
Judy, I want to speak to your mother
just a few minutes alone.

1683
01:39:14,063 --> 01:39:16,998
I'll be waiting outside
if you need me, Mother.

1684
01:39:16,998 --> 01:39:18,861
All right, dear.

1685
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:23,636
Dora, I'm a little bit worried about Judy.

1686
01:39:23,636 --> 01:39:26,400
She's been acting very strange
the past week.

1687
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,543
I just bumped into her
a few minutes ago...

1688
01:39:28,543 --> 01:39:31,737
...and she looked at me
and shook her head.

1689
01:39:31,737 --> 01:39:34,747
I thought she want to tell me something,
then she ran away.

1690
01:39:34,747 --> 01:39:38,080
She's probably trying to make up
her mind between Stephen and Oogie.

1691
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,516
And, Melvin...

1692
01:39:39,516 --> 01:39:43,022
...your letting her make her own decision
as you're doing is wonderful.

1693
01:39:43,022 --> 01:39:45,126
Judy will be all right.

1694
01:39:45,126 --> 01:39:47,285
I think she likes living here.

1695
01:39:47,285 --> 01:39:49,431
You know something, Dora?

1696
01:39:49,431 --> 01:39:51,259
I do too.

1697
01:39:53,069 --> 01:39:57,369
- There. You look really sharp, Gramps.
- You really think so, Randolph?

1698
01:39:57,369 --> 01:40:00,475
Sure. I bet you were a jim-dandy
when you were a young guy.

1699
01:40:00,475 --> 01:40:02,440
Well, I never had any complaints.

1700
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:05,102
Randolph? Gramps?

1701
01:40:05,781 --> 01:40:08,807
I have something to say
of the utmost importance.

1702
01:40:08,807 --> 01:40:10,976
Something that may change
our whole lives.

1703
01:40:10,976 --> 01:40:14,316
- You gonna run for president?
- This is no time for jokes, Randolph.

1704
01:40:14,316 --> 01:40:18,927
- Oh, what is it, Judy girl?
- Well, just remember one thing if you will.

1705
01:40:18,927 --> 01:40:23,429
Whatever happens this evening,
we must be patient and understanding.

1706
01:40:23,429 --> 01:40:25,931
We must stick together.

1707
01:40:26,469 --> 01:40:28,232
Please remember.

1708
01:40:31,607 --> 01:40:34,599
My sister used to be
a normal human being.

1709
01:40:34,599 --> 01:40:37,075
Now she's in love.

1710
01:40:37,446 --> 01:40:40,813
Never criticize anyone for being in love,
Randolph.

1711
01:40:40,813 --> 01:40:44,441
It's a mighty important institution.

1712
01:40:56,766 --> 01:41:00,167
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take great pleasure in presenting to you...

1713
01:41:00,167 --> 01:41:03,737
...our very talented,
lovely and beautiful singer...

1714
01:41:03,737 --> 01:41:07,307
...Señorita Rosita Conchellas.

1715
01:41:08,444 --> 01:41:10,878
[SINGING]

1716
01:41:21,424 --> 01:41:23,187
We gotta get going
Where are we going?

1717
01:41:23,187 --> 01:41:24,724
What are we gonna do?

1718
01:41:24,724 --> 01:41:26,691
We're on our way to somewhere

1719
01:41:26,691 --> 01:41:28,386
But only me and you

1720
01:41:28,386 --> 01:41:31,624
All we see there, who we'll see there
What a very big surprise

1721
01:41:31,624 --> 01:41:34,702
There may be caballeros
With dark and flashing eyes

1722
01:41:34,702 --> 01:41:36,394
We're on our way

1723
01:41:36,394 --> 01:41:38,096
Pick up your pack

1724
01:41:38,096 --> 01:41:39,832
And if we stay

1725
01:41:39,832 --> 01:41:41,533
We won't come back

1726
01:41:41,533 --> 01:41:45,373
How can we go?
We haven't got a dime

1727
01:41:45,373 --> 01:41:48,711
But we're going
And you're gonna have happy time

1728
01:42:02,898 --> 01:42:06,129
Now, someone said
They just come back from somewhere

1729
01:42:06,129 --> 01:42:09,567
A friend of mine that I don't even know

1730
01:42:09,567 --> 01:42:13,196
He said there's lot of fun
If we can get there

1731
01:42:13,196 --> 01:42:14,967
If that's the case

1732
01:42:14,967 --> 01:42:16,736
That's the place

1733
01:42:16,736 --> 01:42:20,177
The place we want to go

1734
01:42:20,177 --> 01:42:22,249
We gotta get going, where we going?

1735
01:42:22,249 --> 01:42:24,852
The nerve of her. How dare she?

1736
01:42:24,852 --> 01:42:27,454
How dare she?
And in front of Mother too.

1737
01:42:27,454 --> 01:42:30,558
Who we'll see there, who will be there
What a very big surprise

1738
01:42:30,558 --> 01:42:33,627
There maybe caballeros
With dark and flashing eyes

1739
01:42:33,627 --> 01:42:35,320
I'll take the train

1740
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:37,056
You take the boat

1741
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,860
Or I'll take the plane

1742
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,558
And you ride the boat

1743
01:42:40,558 --> 01:42:42,363
Oh, we don't care

1744
01:42:42,363 --> 01:42:44,403
We rather walk or climb

1745
01:42:44,403 --> 01:42:48,065
But we're going
And you're gonna have a happy time

1746
01:43:24,513 --> 01:43:26,003
Melvin, she seems to know you.

1747
01:43:26,003 --> 01:43:28,673
Oh, yes, I get around quite a bit.

1748
01:43:28,673 --> 01:43:33,049
- We've got a great big secret, Dora.
- Did somebody say, "Let's eat"?

1749
01:43:33,049 --> 01:43:36,419
Nobody did, Gramps,
but it's a good idea.

1750
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:43,427
Hello, girls, did you want to see me?

1751
01:43:43,427 --> 01:43:44,759
Never mind being polite.

1752
01:43:44,759 --> 01:43:47,095
- You ought to be ashamed.
- Ashamed of what?

1753
01:43:47,095 --> 01:43:49,965
Running around with a man
old enough to be your father.

1754
01:43:49,965 --> 01:43:52,573
It is my business
who I choose to run around with.

1755
01:43:52,573 --> 01:43:55,767
- You run around with a married man.
- A married man with children.

1756
01:43:55,767 --> 01:43:59,403
- Just a minute, did you say married?
- Yes, married and with two children.

1757
01:43:59,403 --> 01:44:01,482
- Grown children.
- Two children?

1758
01:44:01,482 --> 01:44:04,346
You're breaking up a wonderful family
and a happy home.

1759
01:44:04,346 --> 01:44:06,249
It was a happy home.

1760
01:44:06,249 --> 01:44:07,855
You wait in here.

1761
01:44:07,855 --> 01:44:09,786
Don't go away.

1762
01:44:34,116 --> 01:44:35,549
There, sit down.

1763
01:44:35,549 --> 01:44:38,653
Now you tell him
what you just told me.

1764
01:44:38,653 --> 01:44:40,721
Go on, tell him.

1765
01:44:40,721 --> 01:44:43,323
Go on. Okay, then I tell him.

1766
01:44:43,323 --> 01:44:46,757
You big good-for-nothing unfaithful lug.

1767
01:44:46,757 --> 01:44:50,592
Why don't tell me you're married?
And have two children. Grown children.

1768
01:44:50,592 --> 01:44:52,893
What do you mean, married?
I am not married.

1769
01:44:52,893 --> 01:44:56,162
I don't have two children of any kind.
What is this all about?

1770
01:44:56,162 --> 01:44:59,068
We didn't mean you, Mr. Cugat.

1771
01:44:59,068 --> 01:45:01,505
We were talking about Mr. Foster.

1772
01:45:01,505 --> 01:45:05,010
Mr. Foster? Mr. Foster, eh?

1773
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:08,513
- My father.
- Her father.

1774
01:45:08,513 --> 01:45:10,515
Werert you at his office this week?

1775
01:45:10,515 --> 01:45:12,085
And hiding in his closet?

1776
01:45:13,188 --> 01:45:15,179
- Well, were you?
- Of course I was.

1777
01:45:15,179 --> 01:45:18,053
I mean, I was teaching him to rumba.

1778
01:45:18,053 --> 01:45:20,058
In a closet?

1779
01:45:20,996 --> 01:45:22,588
Oh, I see.

1780
01:45:22,588 --> 01:45:25,393
You thought... Oh, my.

1781
01:45:25,393 --> 01:45:30,334
I was teaching your father to rumba as
a surprise for you and your mother tonight.

1782
01:45:30,334 --> 01:45:32,167
What?

1783
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:37,673
Oh, I'm afraid we made
a terrible mistake, Miss Rosita.

1784
01:45:37,673 --> 01:45:39,939
Oh, please forgive us, Mr. Cugat.

1785
01:45:39,939 --> 01:45:41,980
I forgive you.

1786
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:43,709
You I wanna talk to.

1787
01:45:43,709 --> 01:45:47,947
And as for Mr. Foster,
he better know how to do the rumba.

1788
01:45:48,724 --> 01:45:50,954
I guess I better apologize to my father.

1789
01:45:50,954 --> 01:45:53,526
I think the less said the better.

1790
01:45:53,526 --> 01:45:55,527
Might as well go back now.

1791
01:45:55,527 --> 01:45:59,190
Just a minute, Carol. I believe
we have some unfinished business.

1792
01:45:59,768 --> 01:46:02,202
Now that my faith in men
has been restored...

1793
01:46:02,202 --> 01:46:04,305
...what's this about you and Stephen?

1794
01:46:04,305 --> 01:46:07,499
Stephen? Well, I don't know.

1795
01:46:07,499 --> 01:46:09,337
That is, not exactly.

1796
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:12,309
Well, exactly what
does "not exactly" mean?

1797
01:46:13,682 --> 01:46:16,776
I mean that Stephen
isn't interested in me.

1798
01:46:17,086 --> 01:46:18,553
Not even a little bit.

1799
01:46:18,553 --> 01:46:23,749
Well, then, if he isn't interested in you,
Carol, maybe he could be interested in me.

1800
01:46:24,293 --> 01:46:26,124
I think he might be.

1801
01:46:26,124 --> 01:46:28,490
- Shall we join the others?
- Mm-hm.

1802
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:31,895
I should have known all the time
my father was fatherly.

1803
01:47:13,075 --> 01:47:15,168
Dora, I don't like to mention this...

1804
01:47:15,168 --> 01:47:18,643
...but don't you think you should brush up
on your rumba a little bit?

1805
01:47:18,643 --> 01:47:22,545
Tell me, how did you manage to keep this
a secret from the children and me?

1806
01:47:22,545 --> 01:47:24,413
No trouble at all. It was easy.

1807
01:47:24,413 --> 01:47:28,317
In fact, they used to call me
"Foxy Foster."

1808
01:47:39,968 --> 01:47:41,993
Excuse me, Carol.

1809
01:47:43,539 --> 01:47:44,938
Evening, Oogie.

1810
01:47:44,938 --> 01:47:47,337
- Oh, good evening.
- Hi.

1811
01:47:47,337 --> 01:47:49,636
There's something
I wish to discuss with you.

1812
01:47:49,636 --> 01:47:51,211
Oh, of course. Go right ahead.

1813
01:47:51,211 --> 01:47:53,871
I thought you'd like to know
that I've changed.

1814
01:47:53,871 --> 01:47:56,574
I'm not the same Judy Foster
you knew yesterday.

1815
01:47:56,574 --> 01:47:58,777
Well, you look the same to me.

1816
01:47:59,188 --> 01:48:00,746
I've decided to take you back.

1817
01:48:00,746 --> 01:48:03,153
Frankly, Miss Foster,
I don't want you back.

1818
01:48:04,026 --> 01:48:07,826
Oogie Pringle, you listen to me.
First you want me, then you don't want me.

1819
01:48:07,826 --> 01:48:11,864
Now that I want you to want me,
you don't want me. Make up your mind.

1820
01:48:12,201 --> 01:48:15,034
- I have made up my mind.
- He has made up his mind.

1821
01:48:15,034 --> 01:48:17,434
- Mitzi, you keep out of it.
- I don't have to.

1822
01:48:17,434 --> 01:48:20,769
- You keep out...
- Girls, girls, please be calm.

1823
01:48:20,769 --> 01:48:23,673
You'll find someone someday, Judy.

1824
01:48:27,115 --> 01:48:28,878
Good evening, Mr. Pringle.

1825
01:48:29,084 --> 01:48:32,713
Oh, Oogie. Oogie, you're so right.

1826
01:48:32,713 --> 01:48:36,153
I hope you two will be very happy.

1827
01:48:39,628 --> 01:48:42,426
Oh, Oogie,
I didn't know you cared for me.

1828
01:48:42,426 --> 01:48:44,657
Oh, don't talk to me.

1829
01:48:44,657 --> 01:48:46,858
I'm confused.

1830
01:48:47,169 --> 01:48:48,830
Good evening, Stephen, Mr. Pringle.

1831
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:51,564
- Judy, Is my daughter here?
- She's right over there.

1832
01:48:51,564 --> 01:48:54,334
- Will you excuse me?

Well, say in a few years. You think so?
