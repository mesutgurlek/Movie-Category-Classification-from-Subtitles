1
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,533
<i>Have you been told?</i>

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,872
<i>Did you ever hear of the curious,
furious, fidgety year...</i>

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:18,745
<i>...when Santa Claus unhitched his sleigh
and vowed he was taking a holiday?</i>

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,784
How do I know so much about Santa?
Well, I'm Mrs. Claus.

5
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,718
It was long ago before you were living.

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:33,599
Not yet Christmas, but past Thanksgiving,
though I can't give you the very date.

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:41,202
<i>Santa got up that morning late,
pulled on one boot, and then, its twin...</i>

8
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,510
<i>...ruffled the whiskers on his chin...</i>

9
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,909
...and sat back down
on the side of the bed.

10
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,581
Great North Star, but I'm tired.

11
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:49,881
...he said.

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,978
Painting wagons red and bright,
sharpening ice skates half the night...

13
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,488
...wrapping presents in ribbons and gauze...

14
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,681
...has worn me weary.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,494
...said Santa Claus.

16
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,887
Crick in my back.

17
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,562
Cold in my nose.

18
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,896
Aches in my fingers and all ten toes...

19
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:13,471
...and a sort of kind of kink inside
whenever I think of...

20
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,002
...that Christmas ride.

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,705
Now, Santa, you just rest yourself
a bit longer.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,644
I've already sent for the doctor.

23
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,116
We'll have you back on your feet
in no time.

24
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,452
No wonder you got the shivers and shakes.

25
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,784
Probably, never got over the case of
near-pneumonia you picked up last year...

26
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,729
...gallivanting around the world
in your open sleigh.

27
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,125
And for what?

28
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:45,135
Just to deliver presents to a bunch of folks
who don't give a hoot in the first place.

29
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,237
But...

30
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,708
Now, now, Doctor.
It's not just presents, and you know it.

31
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,941
What about all that Christmas spirit
and goodwill?

32
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,844
If you had any sense,
you'd give it up as a bad job...

33
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,784
...and stay home in bed this year.

34
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:03,847
Come now. If Santa stayed home,
there'd be no Christmas.

35
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,689
Who cares?
Nobody cares about Christmas anymore.

36
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,189
They don't?

37
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,292
Of course not.

38
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,431
Wouldn't surprise me none
if nobody even believes in you anymore.

39
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,733
Now, Santa, don't you pay him any mind.

40
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,274
Nobody cares a hooting holler for you
or Christmas.

41
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,474
By the way, Merry Christmas to you.

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,216
Now, Santa, I hope you're not going
to take any of that to heart.

43
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,684
No, Ma. The man's right.

44
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:36,781
I had that same feeling myself,
but I just wouldn't admit it.

45
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,559
Nobody really cares anymore.

46
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,986
And besides, the doctor says...

47
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,191
...I'm really not up to snuff.

48
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,396
Besides, I'm due for a holiday.

49
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,172
I better call the boys...

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,634
...and tell them to cancel Christmas.

51
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:05,710
<i>Warn the people. Tell the papers
I'm much too tired for Christmas capers.</i>

52
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,120
But Santa, you must be kidding.

53
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,582
But, it was true.

54
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,293
Santa was taking a holiday
and the world would soon know...

55
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,264
...that it was to be the year
without a Santa Claus.

56
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:23,326
"Did you ever hear
of that terrible year

57
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,466
"Way back before you were born

58
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:32,903

82
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,348
<i>...when that news reached the press?</i>

83
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,616

<i>"Santa says, 'Too tired, not coming.“</i>

85
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:30,025
<i>Out in the stable nuzzling hay,
the reindeer dreamed of Christmas day.</i>

86
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,329
<i>But Santa phoned the reindeer groom.</i>

87

<i>Hang up the harness in the big storeroom.</i>

88
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,802
He called to his elves
and he told each gnome:

89
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,741
Cover up the shelves. We're...

90
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,242
<i>...staying home.</i>

91
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,608
What? Cover the shelves?

92
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,815
<i>...cried the gnomes and elves.</i>

93
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,747
Cover the dolls?

94
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,083
And electric trains?

95
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,816
And the rocking horses
with shaggy manes?

96
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,925
And the rubber boots
for splashing in parks?

97
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,495
And the cowboy suits?

98
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,319
And the Noah's Arks?

99
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,822
And the Noah's Arks.

100
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,093
And the animals too.

101
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:12,900
Hello?

102
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,068
Jingle Bells. Number One Elf speaking.

103
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,104
And Jangle Bells.

104
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,174
Will you stop that?

105
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,571
May I ask who is calling, please?

106
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,877
Hi, Mrs. Claus! Yes, Mrs. Claus.

107
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,688
Okay, Mrs. Claus.

108
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,986
Sure thing, Mrs. Claus.
Right away, Mrs. Claus.

109
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,821
Who was that?

110
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,918
That was...

111
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,592
Come on.

112
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,434
It fits. It fits very nicely.

113
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,631
I bet I could be Santa Claus.

114
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:52,003
"Who would know the difference
if Santa Claus was me

115
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,209
"Yes, who would know the difference

116
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,680
"Just Santa Claus and me

"I could be Santa Claus"

137
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,902
Santa, you changed your mind.

138
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,946
Oh, joy! Oh, happy day!

139
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,215
Well, boys, what do you think?

140
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,882
Hi, Mrs. C.

141
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,853
Mrs. C!

142
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,522
No good, huh?

143
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,625
I guess we'll have to move
right on then to plan B.

144
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,760
Plan B?

145
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:49,761
What's that?

146
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,164
As I see it, Santa doesn't want to go
because nobody cares, right?

147
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:54,962
Right.

148
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,562
He thinks there's no Christmas spirit,
no goodwill. Right?

149
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,634
Right.

150
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,836
So, all you have to do is go down there
and find some example...

151
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,538
...of Christmas spirit left over
from last year.

152
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,274
Scout up some goodwill
and show him some proof...

153
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,614
...that somebody cares. Right?

154
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:13,650
Right.

155
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,788
Santa will change his mind,
and presto, Christmas is on again.

156
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,785
Now, make sure you don't get lost.

157
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,860
- Lost?
- Lost?

158
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,630
Vixen's made the trip. Haven't you, dear?

159
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,936
- She'll take you. No problem.
- Yeah, but...

160
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,103
Just hurry along and gather up
enough proof to change Santa's mind...

161
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,677
...and we can get on
with Christmas as usual.

162
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,781
Bon voyage. Send us a card now and then.

163
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,317
I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing.

164
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,620
But faced with the idea of having
no Christmas at all...

165
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,326
...drastic measures were called for.

166
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,890
What's all that racket out there, Ma?

167
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:06,005
It was just one of the reindeer
getting himself some exercise, dear.

168
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,802
With all the rest
and relaxation around here...

169
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,174
...everybody's jumpy as a leapfrog.

170
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,506
It just isn't natural for this time of year.

171
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,982
They'll get used to it. I have already.

172
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,448
I tell you, this is life.

173
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,688
If you say so, dear.

174
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:32,063
Are you thinking that I'm doing
the wrong thing by staying home?

175
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,429
Of course not, dear.
But if you should change your mind...

176
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,905
Okay, what are you up to, Ma?

177
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,371
Me? Up to something?

178
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,634
Ridiculous.

179
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,644
Do I look like I'm up to something?

180
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,546
No, you don't look like
you're up to something...

181
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,246
...but whenever you look like
you're not up to anything...

182
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,610
...you're up to something.

183
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,556
What are you up to, Ma?

184
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,492
It's nothing that need concern you.

185
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,494
Poor Jingle.

186
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,459
Poor Jangle.

187
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,699
Jingle! Jangle!

188
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,759
Concern it, Ma. What's going on?

189
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,037
They're only trying to help.

190
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,998
Where are they?

191
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,701
They thought they'd just browse
around the world...

192
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,178
...and see if the folks didn't really care
about you and Christmas.

193
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:25,150
You mean, they went down there
out into that...

194
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,110
...cruel world by themselves?

195
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,815
Of course not, silly.
Vixen went with them.

196
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:36,026
Vixen! She's just a baby.

197
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,223
Poor little girl.

198
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,597
No telling what might happen.

199
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,231
Now I'll have to go after them.

200
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,503
Do you think you ought to, dear,
with your cold and all?

201
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,041
I have to go.

202
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,812
Those three won't even get
past the Miser brothers without...

203
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,009
The Miser brothers, oh dear!

204
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,912
I forgot all about those two.

205
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,614
Of all the fool things for them to do.

206
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:06,683
If Snow Miser doesn't freeze them
just for the fun of it...

207
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,785
...his devil of a brother
will put the heat on them for sure.

208
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:16,526
Dasher! On the double!

209
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,364
Away, Dasher! Away!

210
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,046
<i>The Miser brothers. What a pair!</i>

211
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,840
<i>Snow Miser, who controls
the northern part of the world...</i>

212
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,147
<i>...trying to turn everything to icicles...</i>

213
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,211
<i>...and his nasty brother
trying to keep the south so hot...</i>

214
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,314
<i>...with nary a snowflake a year.</i>

215
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,425
<i>Thanks to me, Vixen, Jingle and Jangle...</i>

216
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,757
<i>...were headed right between the two.</i>

217
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,195
Where are we? Where are we heading?

218
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,960
What do you think?

219
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,598
Don't just stand there, you fools!

220
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,300
They're part of the Santa Claus gang
of goody-goodies.

221
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,706
They must be on their way
to start everybody grieving...

222
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,439
...about white Christmas again.

223
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,978
Don't let them get through.
Singe their britches for them.

224
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:07,884
Get them.

225
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,048
Get them!

226
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,489
<i>Of course, I never dreamed
that little Vixen...</i>

227
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,156
<i>...would make the mistake of flying
right smack into Heat Miser's territory.</i>

228
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,035
They got away. They got away!

229
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,917
<i>Just a baby, perhaps,
but little Vixen pulled the boys...</i>

230
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,581
<i>...out of a pretty tight spot.</i>

231
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,624
I wonder where we are now?

232
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,093
If you ask me, still in serious trouble.

233
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,896
Look! Look down there.

234
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,257
Southtown, U.S.A.

235
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:56,066
That looks like as good a place as any
to find some Christmas spirit.

236
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,500
Take her down, Vixen old girl.

237
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,536
Where is everybody?

238
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,509
Boy, that's what I'd like to know.

239
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:09,773
How can we find any goodwill
if we can't even find any people?

240
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,149
All right, buddy, pull over.

241
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,743
What's the problem, Officer?

242
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,757
"What's the problem?"
I'll tell you what the problem is.

243
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,824
Driving a... Riding a...

244
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,527
What do you call that thing anyway?

245
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,856
That's Vixen.

246
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,700
Riding a Vixen the wrong way
on a one-way street...

247
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,428
...crossing the white line...

248
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,799
...and wearing funny-looking suits
on a Sunday.

249
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,738
But--

250
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,672
Tell it to the judge.

251
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,504
Maybe they don't like reindeer
in these parts.

252
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,348
I know what! We'll make her a disguise.
Take your socks off.

253
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,884
Take my socks off!

254
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,316
Just do as you're told.

255
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,057
And there we have "instant Rover."

256
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,554
Now, let's take our dog for a walk...

257
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,291
...and see if we can find
some Christmas spirit and goodwill.

258
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,929
<i>Yoo-hoo, madam.</i>

259
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,366
What do you want?

260
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,961
I wonder if we might speak with you
for a moment.

261
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,966
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

262
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,576
At my age? Who are you?

263
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:12,870
My name is--

264
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,004
What on earth is that?

265
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,711
That's our little puppy dog, Rover.

266
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:18,808
A dog?

267
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,684
Yep. Bark for the lady, Rover.

268
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,493
Kitty cat. Kitty, come here.

269
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,633
Yeah, I've seen them. Two little fellas
wearing goofy clothes.

270
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,067
They didn't get into any trouble,
did they, Officer?

271
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,901
I'll say they got in trouble.

272
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,810
Wait until the judge gets finished
with them lawbreakers.

273
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,905
He'll give them what for.

274
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:54,950
Not much Christmas spirit there,
and just as I feared...

275
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,386
...they're in trouble already.

276
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,189
We better find them quick.
Poor little guys.

277
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,486
Must be scared to death.

278
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,294
I'm scared to death.

279
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,527
Serves you right.
"Bark for the lady, Rover," indeed.

280
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,369
Why don't we just skip the whole business
and go home?

281
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,636
I'd like to, but I hate to let Mrs. C down.

282
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,278
We've just got to find a trace of
Christmas spirit and goodwill somewhere.

283
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,606
I know.

284
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,050
Santa's favorites have always been
the little ones, the children.

285
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,984
Why don't we talk to one of them?

286
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,284
Good idea.

287
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,960
There are a whole bunch
of children over there.

288
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,254
Let's talk to them and get out of here...

289
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,493
...because I think Vixen's coming down
with something. She's got a slight fever.

290
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,895
Poor thing.
She's just not used to this weather.

291
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,869
You just lay down here in the shade, girl.
We'll be right back.

292
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,668
I beg your pardon, young man.
May we have a word with you?

293
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,544
Sure. Hey, they're dressed up
like a couple of Christmas elves.

294
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,819
Haven't you heard the news?
Santa's taking a holiday.

295
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,649
Yeah, it was in all the papers.

296
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,584
Well, you don't seem
to be very upset about it.

297
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,753
Upset? Why should I be upset?

298
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,260
Yeah, what's the big deal?

299
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,094
You mean, you don't care
if Santa Claus comes or not?

300
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,390
None of you?

301
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,957
No.

302
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,736
Of course not. It's none of our business.

303
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,240
Besides, believing in Santa Claus
is for little kids.

304
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,469
Yeah.

305
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,008
This is serious.

306
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,909
It's worse than I thought.

307
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,478
If I were you guys, I wouldn't waste time
worrying about Santa Claus.

308
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,642
You got a bigger problem.

309
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,048
What do you mean?

310
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,320
The dog catcher's got your pooch!

311
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,657
Stop! Thief!

312
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,658
- Reindeer-napper!
- You come back here!

313
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,251
Who said you could...

314
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,353
Vixen, hang on! Hang on!

315
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,565
<i>A very nice boy. Ignatius Thistiewhite.
Nice name, too.</i>

316
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,631
<i>He didn't know it at the time, but he was
going to be a much bigger help...</i>

317
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:58,268
<i>...to the two little elves and to all of us
than he could ever imagine...</i>

318
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,578
<i>...because a little later,
when he got home...</i>

319
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,048
Hi, there, little fella.

320
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,783
Can you spare a moment?

321
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,317
Sure. My name's Ignatius Thistiewhite.
Everybody calls me Iggie.

322
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,357
What's yours?

323
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,825
Claus. Claus.

324
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,663
What can I do for you, Mr. Claus?

325
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:26,431
I'm looking for two friends of mine.
Tiny little fellas.

326
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,131
Red shoes.

327
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,643
You must mean the two guys
I met at school.

328
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,442
They were asking us about Christmas
and stuff.

329
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,976
Ignatius, was that you I heard sneeze?

330
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,022
Not me, Mom. It was my friend, Mr. Claus.

331
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:48,155
Why don't you bring him inside and talk,
and I'll give him something for that cold?

332
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,088
Mom, Dad, meet Mr. Claus.

333
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,099
How do you do?

334
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,911
You poor man. Drink this.
It'll make you feel much better.

335
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,048
Thank you.

336
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,885
You say my friends
were asking you about Christmas?

337
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,393
Yeah. They wanted to know
if we kids cared about Santa Claus and all.

338
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,950
What did you tell them?

339
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,757
Heck, I don't believe
in Santa Claus anymore.

340
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,064
That's kid stuff. isn't it?

341
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,832
Just as I thought.

342
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,633
You don't believe in Santa Claus,
do you, Dad?

343
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,337
Why, yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

344
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,442
How about you?

345
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,146
Me?

346
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,343
Why, of course, I do.

347
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,561

I guess, if you're not too old

00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,821
...well, I guess, maybe--

383
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,595
By the way,
when my friends left the schoolyard...

384
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,729
...did they say where they were going?

385
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,003
Oh, my gosh.

386
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:00,273
I almost forgot.
They were chasing the dog catcher's truck.

387
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,808
They were what?

388
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,681
He was taking their dog away in his truck
and they were trying to catch him.

389
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,880
Their dog? Good grief!

390
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,388
Vixen!

391
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:16,025
<i>Poor little Vixen,
so frightened and sick in the dog pound.</i>

392
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:20,723
<i>It was one of those days when things
just kept going from bad to worse.</i>

393
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:35,343
<i>Santa wanted to get Vixen
out of that dog pound and quick.</i>

394
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,579
<i>Ordinarily, Santa doesn't like
to show off his flying reindeer...</i>

395
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,314
<i>...in front of people, but he was in a rush.</i>

396
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,722
Gosh, did you see that?

397
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,558
I certainly did.

398
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,686
I thought there was something different
about that man.

399
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,221
Mr. Claus. He must be...

400
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,027
Wouldn't surprise me a bit.
At the moment, nothing would.

401
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,103
Then his friends must be real elves
and their dog...

402
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,171
I'll bet that dog was a baby reindeer.

403
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,577
That's bad. They won't know how
to take care of a reindeer at the dog pound.

404
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,241
I wish there was something I could do.

405
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:15,254
When you've got a big problem, Son,
it often pays to go right to the top man.

406
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,349
Why don't you stop by the mayor's office?
Tell him the whole story.

407
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,458
He should be able to help.

408
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,291
Good idea, Dad.

409
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:28,293
<i>Well, it just so happened that Jingle
and Jangle had the same good idea...</i>

410
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:32,135
<i>...when the men at the dog pound refused
to let Vixen go...</i>

411
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,499
<i>...he suggested that they take their case
to the mayor.</i>

412
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:42,810
Now, let me see if I got this straight.

413
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,544
You two are elves...

414
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,451
...and that dog down at the pound...

415
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,417
...is a reindeer...

416
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:56,557
...and you want to take him back
to Santa Claus.

417
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,493
At the North Pole.

418
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,598
You see, your honor,
we're here on a special mission.

419
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,231
A secret mission.

420
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,502
A secret mission. I should have guessed.

421
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,212
'Cause Santa isn't coming this year.

422
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,073
He wants to take a holiday.

423
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,615
No more, please. I can't take any more.

424
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,356
Reindeer, Santa Claus, elves.

425
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,694
But, we are elves. We're serious.

426
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,194
How can we convince you?

427
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,868
Come on, son.
What kind of fool do you think I am?

428
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:40,697
You ain't got the chance of a snowball
in Southtown of convincing me...

429
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,607
...one-tenth of your story's on the level.

430
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:47,907
A snowball in Southtown?
What kind of chance is that?

431
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,741
Not very good. It never snows here.

432
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,117
Well, not in the last 100 years.

433
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,687
I've got an idea.

434
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,520
You elves can work magic and all that.

435
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:04,492
You conjure up a good old-fashioned
white Christmas for us...

436
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,427
...right here in Southtown...

437
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,796
...and I'll buy every word you say.

438
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,028
You will?

439
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,766
I'll spring your reindeer
from the hoosegow.

440
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,967
I'll call all the mayors in the U.S. of A.

441
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:22,805
We'll give Santa
an official national holiday this year.

442
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,416
It's a deal.

443
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,285
Good-bye, your honor.
We've got lots to do.

444
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,554
Yeah, see you all on the ski slopes,
Mr. Mayor.

445
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,768
"It's gonna snow, ho, ho,
right here in Dixie

446
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,467

"So we've been told"

457
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:36,817
Now, take it easy, girl. I paid your fine.

458
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,218
We'll be going home now.

459
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,384
A real reindeer. How do you like that?

460
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,660
Aren't they supposed to be up north?

461
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,826
That's why she's so sick.
She can't take this warm weather.

462
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,169
I've got to get her home.

463
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,032
I hope I'm not too late.

464
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,999
There we go, girl.

465
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:03,612
If anybody should come by
asking about her...

466
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,172
Two funny little characters.

467
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,515
They were here about an hour ago,
but they couldn't pay the fine.

468
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,521
I told them to go see the mayor.

469
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:14,424
What am I gonna do about those two?

470
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,585
Don't you worry, Vixen.

471
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,066
I'm gonna take care of you first.

472
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,903
<i>Santa was worried
about Jingle and Jangle...</i>

473
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:33,206
<i>...but he had an even more serious prob!em
on his hands.</i>

474
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,613
<i>If he didn't get Vixen back
to the North Pole fast...</i>

475
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:41,416
<i>...well, who knows what might happen
to the littlest reindeer of the team.</i>

476
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:47,183
<i>Things looked pretty grim from where
Jingle, Jangle and young Iggie sat.</i>

477
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:51,220
<i>As far as they knew,
Vixen was still in the pound...</i>

478
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,965
<i>...and they were faced with the problem
of making it snow in Southtown.</i>

479
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:00,932
<i>Well, all seemed lost,
but Jingle got a brilliant idea.</i>

480
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:06,201
Mrs. Claus. If anybody can figure
a way out of this mess...

481
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,437
...she can.

482
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,072
How about calling Mrs. Santa Claus?

483
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,511
Good idea. Why didn't I think of that?

484
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,648
She should be along any minute now.

485
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,254
I hope she doesn't wake my folks up.

486
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,723
Here she comes now!

487
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,100
Gosh!

488
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:33,962
Hop on, boys. Hello, Iggie.
Say, "hello," Blitzen.

489
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,298
Golly.

490
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,904
Hi, Mrs. C. Where are we going?

491
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,536
To see Snow Miser.

492
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,023
Here he comes now, the big ham.

493
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,902
"I'm Mr. White Christmas

494

"Too much"

518
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,284
Well, Mrs. Claus, how's your hubby?

519
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,762
I'm afraid he's got
a pretty bad cold, Snowy.

520
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,624
That's a shame, the poor fellow.

521
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:45,934
He should have come to see me.
I'd have given him a good one.

522
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,429
A little chilly humor there.

523
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,467
Don't you dare make fun
of Santa Claus like that!

524
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,740
He's the nicest person in the whole world.

525
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,544
Of course he is, sonny. I love him a lot.

526
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:58,545
You do?

527
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,312
Of course I do, silly.

528
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,411
He's the best advertisement
snow biz ever had.

529
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,951
Now, what can I do for you, madam?

530
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,685
We need a snowstorm.

531
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,161
No sooner said than done, my little icicle.

532
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:18,035
- Where do you want it?
- In a town called Southtown, U.S.A.

533
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,705
What? Hold it.

534
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,998
Hold it!

535
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,140
No can do, Mrs. C.

536
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,014
The south is under the control
of my stepbrother, Heat Miser.

537
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:32,207
Every time I try to send
a little refreshing snow down there...

538
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:37,355
...what does he do? He turns it into rain
or fog, and who needs that?

539
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,453
If I get his okay, will you make it snow?

540
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:45,788
Sure thing. But don't get your hopes up.
You'll never get anywhere with that one.

541
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,557
We'll have to try. Thanks, Snowy.

542
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,393
Don't mention it,
and don't be such a stranger.

543
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:56,168
Stop by with your hubby sometime
and we'll have a blizzard.

544
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,305
Where to now?

545
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,175
You heard the man.
We've got to see Heat Miser.

546
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,215
I was afraid you'd say that.

547
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,851
On, Blitzen!

548

Where's your husband?

580
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,277
Out doing another commercial
for my brother?

581
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:17,244
Come now. You know Santa isn't
on your brother's payroll.

582
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:20,348
Well, then, he's grossly unfair, that's what.

583
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,887
Traipsing around
in that stupid sleigh of his...

584
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,352
...stirring up cold winter breezes,
and causing everybody...

585
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,826
...to think fondly of snowball fights
and sleigh rides...

586
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,126
...and ice hockey.

587
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,365
I assure you, it's not intentional.

588
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,697
Why doesn't he wear a bathing suit
and drive a sand buggy.

589
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,668
But we live at the North Pole.

590
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,296
And he could sing the praises
of heat and rain!

591
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,773
I'll see what I can do.

592
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,572
In the meantime, will you do us a favor?

593
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:50,204
I don't see why I should.
Nobody ever does anything for me.

594
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,140
But what is it?

595
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:56,479
Could you let it snow?
Just for one day in the south.

596
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,654
What? Snow in the south?

597
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,718
Just for one day.

598
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,222
Never!

599
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,161
Unless...

600
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:13,068
...there were something in it for me?

601
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,496
Like what?

602
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,802
Like, for instance,
if a little bit of northern territory...

603
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,778
...were turned over to me.
Shall we say, the North Pole?

604
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:29,681
Well, heavens, I don't know.
That would be up to your brother, not me.

605
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,490
Well, why don't you give
the tutti-frutti snowcone...

606
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,219
...a buzz on the hotline
and see what he says?

607
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,754
Hello?

608
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,398
Snowy, this is Mrs. Claus.

609
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,766
<i>Hi there, sugarplum.
How'd you make out with the hothead?</i>

610
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,204
I heard that, you snowball!

611
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:50,139
<i>Oh, my goodness, speak of the devil.</i>

612
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:53,836
Madam, kindly state your business
with that drippy snowman...

613
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,380
...and get him out of here.

614
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,108
<i>Mind your blood pressure, hotcakes.</i>

615
00:36:57,182 --> 00:37:00,117
<i>Mother warned you about that
low boiling point of yours.</i>

616
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,116
You think you're hot stuff
just 'cause Mother likes you best.

617
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:05,919
Boys, boys. Now, please, don't fight.

618
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,856
<i>If I can't have a little fun,
I might as well leave.</i>

619
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,793
Your brother agreed to let it snow
in the south.

620
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,953
<i>He did?</i>

621
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,794
Of course, there has to be
a small concession on your part.

622
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,095
<i>Really? What does the flaming fool
want this time?</i>

623
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:20,535
<i>The North Pole?</i>

624
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,870
Yes, as a matter of fact.

625
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,377
<i>What?</i>

626
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,813
I told you he wouldn't cooperate.

627
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,214
<i>Cooperate? Surrender the North Pole,
you call "cooperate"?</i>

628
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,047
<i>I have a good mind
to chill your embers for you.</i>

629
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,246
Oh, yeah?

630
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,983
All right, enough of this.

631
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:43,653
I hate to do this to you, boys,
but you leave me no choice.

632
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,663
I'm going over your heads.

633
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,458
<i>You're kidding.</i>

634
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,090
You wouldn't dare!

635
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,130
I would, and I will.

636
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,799
Mrs. Claus? You see what you did,
you old blizzard?

637
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,374
She's going to tell Mother.

638
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,637
<i>I did, you hot dog? It's all your fault!</i>

639
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,036
Come along.

640
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,104
We're not really going to do it,
are we, Mrs. Claus?

641
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:08,279
I mean, we're not actually
going to disturb her?

642
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,548
She's not serious.

643
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,987
We're not really...

644
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,654
Are we actually going to see...

645
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,793
Yes.

646
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,127
No.

647
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,924
Who? Where are we going?
Who are we going to see?

648
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:26,067
We're going right to the top, Iggie, my boy.

649
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:31,767
Mrs. C is through fooling around.
We're gonna see none other than...

650
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,872
...Mother Nature.

651
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,446
Gosh.

652
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:39,116
<i>I must admit,
I was more than a little nervous myself.</i>

653
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:43,884
<i>I'd never met Mother Nature,
but I knew she didn't like to be disturbed.</i>

654
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,200
<i>As I said, I was pretty nervous myself.</i>

655
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,869
<i>I had no idea what to expect
of Mother Nature.</i>

656
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,274
<i>But, frightened as we were,
we were that determined...</i>

657
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,572
<i>...that Santa should have his holiday.</i>

658
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:13,078
So they gave you a hard time,
did they, Mrs. Claus?

659
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,717
I'm sure they didn't mean to.

660
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:19,952
Yes, they did.
They're nasty little boys, both of them.

661
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,791
Well, I wouldn't say...

662
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,330
I'll straighten them out for you.

663
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,825
Children.

664
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,777
What is it, Mother dear?

665
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:44,878
Mrs. Claus made a very simple request.

666
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:49,276
Now, you let a little snow fall
in Southland...

667
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:56,052
...and you allow just one nice spring day
at the North Pole.

668
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:01,558
All you have to do is compromise.
At this time of the year, especially...

669
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,497
...Santa needs some examples
of the Christmas spirit...

670
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,502
...and we must set a good example
for the people down there to follow.

671
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,040
So, boys, please!

672
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,372
I won't do it!

673
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,648
Me, neither.

674
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,411
Stop it!

675
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,312
Yes, Mother dear.

676
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,315
They're really nice boys, Mrs. Claus.

677
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:32,322
Sometimes they bicker, but you'll have
no further trouble with them.

678
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:36,296
I do hope Santa enjoys his holiday.

679
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,329
How can I ever thank you?

680
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,563
Don't mention it.

681
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:57,521
Well, little girl, I guess,
you're going to be all right after all.

682
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,223
What's this?

683
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,226
"Dear Santa,
I had to go meet Jingle and Jangle.

684
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,632
"Will be back soon."

685
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,500
That's a relief.

686
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,137
Ma will look after those two. She will.

687
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,337
Now, I can stay home
and look after my cold.

688
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,987
Kids, look at the snow. it's really snowing.

689
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,584
Yes, dear, I'll be home early.

690
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,097
Well, I should be leaving here
in a few minutes.

691
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,960
What's that?

692
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,628
Don't forget to wear my what?

693
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,107
Galoshes? What on earth for?

694
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,274
It's snowing, is it? In that case, I'll...

695
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,375
What?

696
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,009
Snow in Southtown?

697
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:05,153
I guess those fellas weren't pulling my leg
about Santa Claus after all.

698
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:11,019
Santa, wake up. Look at these headlines!

699
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:16,523
Yes. Listen to this,
"Mayors Declare Legal Holiday for Santa."

700
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:19,434
"Snow Falls for First Time in Southtown."

701
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:23,407
And, get this: "Day Off for Santa."

702
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,171
Yes, and these all say the same.

703
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,673
Well, Mama, I guess you proved your point.

704
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:34,046
There is some goodwill in the hearts
of all men at this time of year.

705
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:38,115
This, especially, proves it.

706
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:42,752
The world gave me a vacation.

707
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:59,736
<i>Fast as a hurricane,
children hurled the happy message...</i>

708
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,142
<i>...around the world.</i>

709
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,280
<i>Over each continent, isle, and isthmus...</i>

710
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,010
<i>... "Let's give Santa a Merry Christmas."</i>

711
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,513
<i>With snow,
the earth was already whitening.</i>

712
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:13,757
<i>They rolled up their sleeves
and worked like lightning.</i>

713
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,890
<i>They opened their piggy banks.</i>

714
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,550
<i>They racked their brains.</i>

715
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:22,759
<i>They chartered buses and special trains
to reach the Pole by the 24th...</i>

716
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,434
<i>...was all their goal.</i>

717
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:27,828
<i>East, west, north and south...</i>

718
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,805
<i>...came gifts and gifts...</i>

719
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:33,811
<i>...and gifts to spare
from clever children everywhere.</i>

720
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:38,775
<i>Tots who hadn't a penny to spend,
wrote him a letter signed, “a friend.“</i>

721
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:42,977
<i>They had more fun
that strange December, they said...</i>

722
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,549
<i>...than any they could remember.</i>

723
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,637
Well, look at this.

724
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:09,141
What's this? Why, it's a letter for me.

725
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:11,443
"Dear Santa..."

726
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:18,179
<i>"I'll have a blue Christmas</i>

727

<i>"Blue Christmas"</i>

742
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,066
Santa, look!

743
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,674
Presents from the children.

744
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,143
Christmas presents for Santa Claus.
Can you imagine that?

745
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,904
<i>Santa was silent for a minute.</i>

746
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,039
<i>His eye looked bright but a tear stood in it.</i>

747
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,582
<i>And then, he blew his nose
like a trumpet blast.</i>

748
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,323
God bless my soul.

749
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,122
<i>...he said at last.</i>

750
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,294
By the Big Borealis,
by my maps and charts...

751
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,699
...I didn't know children
had such kind hearts.

752
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:16,970
How could a man feel gladder? Prouder?

753
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,741
<i>Then he turned away
and blew his nose louder.</i>

754
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,578
Isn't it wonderful, dear?

755
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:31,716
When we told all the children
you needed a holiday, they all agreed.

756
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,926
So, this year,
they brought Christmas to you.

757
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,786
A holiday! Nonsense!

758
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:44,868
Well, why is everybody standing around?
There's work to be done!

759
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:46,470
Load up the sleigh!

760
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:49,674
Harness the team! Fetch my coat!

761
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:52,069
But what about your gout?

762
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,838
And the crick in your spine?

763
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,106
And your aches?

764
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,807
My back feels fine! Never felt younger!

765
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,645
Never felt stronger!

766
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,582
Haven't got a symptom any longer.

767
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:13,253
Now, pile all those toys inside.
There's no time to waste.

768
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,524
Tonight, we ride!

769
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:31,877
I don't believe it.

770
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:34,016
