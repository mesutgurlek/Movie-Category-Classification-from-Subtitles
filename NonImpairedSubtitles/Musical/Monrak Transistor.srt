1
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,120
Laxative

2
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,799
Have you finished? It smells!

3
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,671
I told you not to use laxative!

4
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,635
This is disgusting!

5
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,545
What are you cooking?

6
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,713
But the kids hate vegetables...

7
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:36,319
I can't come now
I'm guarding a prisoner on the toilet

8
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,528
Got to go, bye

9
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,999
Hey, shit it out...
can't be anything left in there!

10
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,299
I'm done

11
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,287
Hey, this isn't real gold!

12
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,436
Yeah, this is fake!

13
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:23,065
I chased you all day for this?
You deserve a good kick!

14
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,072
You bastard!

15
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,364
His name is Pan

16
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,700
He's from my village
but I haven't seen him in years

17
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,140
I never thought I'd see him again!

18
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,946
Life is so unpredictable...

19
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,783
Hey, no legs outside the bars!

20
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,555
Some people are wicked as hell

21
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,317
but never get punished

22
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,860
Some of them do so well
they make you jealous!

23
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,590
Meanwhile, good people...

24
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,493
like Pan

25
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,526
strange as it may seem

26
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,432
it's as if God's mysterious foot
keeps them down...

27
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,771
all the way down
to this hellish shit hole

28
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,448
Strange, isn't it?

29
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:55,594
The May dewdrops tell me...

30
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,601
my true love is near...

31
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,002
But if you reject me...

32
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,575
the dew just trickles away

33
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,245
Love can turn to something else!

34
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,247
A room can shrink to a mouse hole!

35
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,251
A love filled home...

36
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,322
can become cold and empty!

37
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,962
How much? It's paid for

38
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,366
Who paid?

39
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,044
Hi, Sia Noi!

40
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,679
Hi, Sadaw!

41
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,078
You look lovely tonight...

42
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,250
Who made this blouse for you?

43
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,388
I bought it

44
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,023
I...

45
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:02,533
can't take my eyes off your beauty

46
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:07,331
Why do you transfix me so?

47
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,270
Why must I stare at you?

48
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,774
Why does my heart pound so?

49
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,072
You shine like the full moon!

50
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,716
Your beauty pierces my heart!

51
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,650
Whenever you're within my sight...

52
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:26,884
I can only gaze in rapture!

53
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,324
You look so great!

54
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,054
You could be a model

55
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,799
Every goddess pales beside you!

56
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,333
This world's greatest beauty

57
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,370
comes second to you!

58
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,907
If you came face to face...

59
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,304
Don't embarrass me!

60
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,076
Why are you alone?

61
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,551
Sweethearts...

62
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,351
should make couples...

63
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,985
Should nurse each other
through sickness...

64
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,631
Have a child care for them

65
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,359
It's their duty to the nation!

66
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,765
Why are you alone?

67
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,202
You'll meet death in the end

68
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,207
Can you be reborn
if you spend your life alone?

69
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,869
Living is all about
finding true happiness!

70
00:06:55,014 --> 00:07:01,146
Don't waste your lives! Get married!

71
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,035
Sadaw!

72
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,263
You're very beautiful

73
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,809
Watch where you're fucking going!

74
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,079
Stop gawking and wipe it off!

75
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,358
Bastard!

76
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,907
You're still alive, then?

77
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,814
Stay still

78
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,535
Stop that! There's blood!

79
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,304
It's okay, it will wash out

80
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:13,150
My blood doesn't wash out so easily

81
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,244
Why not? You've especially bad blood?

82
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,963
You looked happy dancing with Sia Noi

83
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:35,631
Every time I looked, you were smiling

84
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,706
I should look stern while I'm dancing?

85
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:42,981
You didn't smile or say a word
when you danced with me

86
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:47,415
Neither did you!
I'm not crazy, I don't talk to myself!

87
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,482
I know...

88
00:09:53,626 --> 00:10:02,364
I'm poor...
so I'm nothing in your eyes...

89
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,333
I have no car...

90
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,430
so you don't care...

91
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,170
Though we used to love each other...

92
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:17,439
All I can give...

93
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,411
is my true heart...

94
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:29,284
I have no diamonds to satisfy you...

95
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,092
What the hell is going on?

96
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,166
Hello... Dad

97
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,999
You're not my damned son!

98
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,037
So it's you, Sadaw!

99
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,698
Sadaw's did not, Dad

100
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,207
Quite the hero, aren't you?

101
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:52,910
Come on...

102
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,129
Where are you going?

103
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,724
You're dead!

104
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:15,930
You'll float in the canal
like a dead dog!

105
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:25,311
MONRAK TRANSISTOR

106
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,818
Oh, it's you... Oye

107
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,922
You're up early this morning

108
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,595
Yes... this is for you, from Pan

109
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,760
What is it? Open it!

110
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,780
FOOT POLLEN

111
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:46,931
Why the hell are you digging
that pond? I hired Noi to do it!

112
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,132
Noi is sick. I'm replacing him

113
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,838
Dad... Stop calling me Dad!

114
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,336
When did I fuck your mother?

115
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,606
What are you doing?

116
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,008
Can't you see? I'm washing clothes

117
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:42,018
Sadaw, you're so cute
even when you tease me

118
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,861
Sadaw...

119
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,865
there's something I must ask you

120
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:05,602
I know it may not be the right time...

121
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,736
What's on your mind?

122
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:16,850
It may embarrass you...

123
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:22,221
or make some difficulty for you...

124
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:29,463
Tell me! I'm listening

125
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,031
Can you pay me in advance?

126
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,905
Oye needs it to buy Osha rice
they'll only sell it tomorrow

127
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,072
All right

128
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,310
Sadaw...

129
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,783
Massage my waist will you?

130
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,784
Just here

131
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,515
On the waist

132
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,060
I know a ghost recipe potion

133
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,723
My Grandpa told me about it

134
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,802
What crap is this now? Ghost recipe?

135
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,839
It's real!

136
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,234
A relative of mine drank it...

137
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:15,211
and he got back on his feet!

138
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,612
You think you can trick an old man?

139
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,050
Why would I want to trick you?

140
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,246
It's real!

141
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:28,550
If it doesn't work
I'll dig without pay!

142
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,893
So what is it?

143
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,495
It helps you live longer
It's made of four plants:

144
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,232
Elbow Tree, Knee Flower
Toe Root and...

145
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,137
Foot Pollen

146
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,005
Foot pollen? Yes

147
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,511
Bastard!

148
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,613
Did I say something wrong?

149
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,547
Get the hell away from me!

150
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,620
You should show me some respect!

151
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,788
Sadaw, what about my cash advance?

152
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,056
Here is your cash!

153
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:07,426
Get away from me or you'll
feel my foot

154
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,364
I haven't kicked you yet!

155
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,431
What's wrong? You look so angry

156
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,441
Give this to Pan
it's his pay for digging the pond

157
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,581
He wasn't kidding
about the ghost recipe...

158
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,888
What kind of medicine's
made from feet?

159
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,856
I'll tell you...

160
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,726
Elbow Tree is lemongrass
it's the length of a forearm

161
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,299
Knee Flower is a real flower

162
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,096
Toe Root's from the roots of bean plant

163
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,204
It grows in our yard

164
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,034
Foot Pollen
comes from a plant with leaves...

165
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,143
as curly as birds' feet

166
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:57,248
I see... But why not call them
by their real names?

167
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,852
My Dad thought Pan wanted him
to eat some feet!

168
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,620
It's a Ghost recipe...

169
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,452
The ingredients have mystical names

170
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,219
with mysterious power to cure

171
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,488
Here, this is from Pan

172
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,666
Sadaw, my love...

173
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,936
the May dewdrops are here...

174
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:32,015
Aren't you cold? When will you choose
someone to plough with you?

175
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:37,314
As the days grow longer, things change

176
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,447
Sadaw, my pretty one

177
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,492
I long to hold you in my arms
but heaven plays funny tricks on me

178
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,755
My heart is in great pain

179
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,363
People are born with ears and eyes

180
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,459
Even though we have different skin
color and sex, we are all still human

181
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,469
I hope, my sweet one

182
00:17:54,606 --> 00:18:00,806
that you will truly understand
what I'm saying

183
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,905
Last, if you really love me

184
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,813
on the night before the new moon

185
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:11,479
there'll be a likay performance
at the temple... If you are alone

186
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,921
I'll swim across the river to you

187
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,357
May you be happy until that day

188
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:21,932
Love you as big as an elephant... Pan

189
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,277
You're so rich
you can fire off pellets at random?

190
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,005
It wasn't at random

191
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,413
I was aiming at a water ghost!

192
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,800
You aren't watching the likay?

193
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,831
No, I'm not feeling well

194
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,937
Not feeling well...

195
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,234
or are you waiting for me?

196
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,137
Crazy!

197
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,712
Shall we stage a likay?

198
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,818
Sure, you play the villain

199
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,881
I force myself on the heroine

200
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,122
You can't escape, I'll do it now

201
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,093
I'll smother you with kisses...
Get off!

202
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,026
Aren't you afraid of ghosts
being on your own?

203
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,640
No! What are you doing here
at this hour?

204
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,207
I keep you company

205
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,969
Leave now...

206
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,542
or we'll be caught

207
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,408
I can be alone

208
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,550
But I can't...

209
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,792
Later on...

210
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,297
Old Chuey came to hate Pan
less than before

211
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,367
But he still didn't really trust him

212
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,333
Quiet! You rascal

213
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,075
What the hell do you want now?

214
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:18,205
I've got some soup from Oye
Wait here

215
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,214
Come up, Brother!

216
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,678
See? My daughter calls
him Brother now!

217
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,016
Naughty girl!

218
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,857
What soup did you say it was?

219
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,724
Old Chuey thinks
that Pan lives only for the moment

220
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:37,028
He's too fond of entertainment

221
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,205
doesn't respect elders

222
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,672
and doesn't know when to stop

223
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,337
But no matter what the old man thinks

224
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,979
one day he finds himself
blessing the bride and groom

225
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:57,588
Blessed be the Buddha
blessed be the monks...

226
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,620
May you both grow old together!

227
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,020
Go forth and multiply!

228
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,390
You're taking her from me, damn you!

229
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,069
Sadaw...

230
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,467
Thanks, dear

231
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,300
Guess which singer?

232
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,207
Sayan Sanya! Wrong

233
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:28,872
Chaiya Mitchai then! Wrong

234
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,774
You know what you get
for guessing wrong?

235
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,045
What? Kisses

236
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,984
What? Kisses

237
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,090
Then... Yodrak Salakjai!

238
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:01,043
Before long, Sadaw was pregnant

239
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,374
Had Pan's story ended here

240
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:07,279
it would have made
a charming short film

241
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:11,144
You'd be on your way
to the exits by now

242
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,951
But not yet!

243
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,186
Pan's story is just beginning

244
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,828
When Sadaw
was a few months pregnant...

245
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:28,429
All the young men in Bangnamlai
had to draw lots for conscription

246
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,538
Yoi was lucky...

247
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,143
Jon, too, Muek, too

248
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,941
and even Dang

249
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:42,013
Guess what Pan drew?

250
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,356
I promise I'll write to you every day

251
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,689
I promise...

252
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:49,044
Never!

253
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:54,692
I'll never forget!
As the moon never forgets the sky...

254
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,726
I'll never forget when we made love

255
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,797
I'll never forget our time together

256
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,959
As long as I live, I'll never forget!

257
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:10,407
Never, never, never...

258
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:15,171
Never...

259
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:20,683
No matter how many months or years

260
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,978
I'll never forget our joyful love

261
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,090
I'll never forget our shared dreams

262
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:31,093
Months or years, I'll never forget

263
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:38,169
Don't forget before I do!

264
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:43,935
I promise I won't forget!

265
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:48,239
I'll always remember the sweetness
which freshens my heart...

266
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,813
During the first six months...

267
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,315
only Pan's letters could
bring smiles to Sadaw's face

268
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:59,890
Pan knew this well
so he went on writing and writing

269
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,293
Though far from each other

270
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,964
Pan's heart
was in every letter he sent her

271
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,990
From the Gutter to the Stars

272
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,101
a contest for folk singers

273
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:50,301
two winners will join the troupe

274
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,569
of top star...

275
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:58,147
Plern Praewsupan

276
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:07,280
A place in Plern's troupe!

277
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:10,083
The tiny house I live in

278
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,423
Should I survive on salt alone

279
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,430
I shall never leave it

280
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,125
Even if I grew rich

281
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,202
No matter how rich

282
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,703
Nothing could take me away

283
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:26,276
From the tiny home I love!

284
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,710
Let's hear it for Plern Praewsupan!

285
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:34,283
Our young and handsome singer

286
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:38,181
Let's not waste time

287
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,384
Next we have our contest:
From the Gutter to the Stars!

288
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,551
Onward and upward!

289
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,294
Lots of contestants tonight!

290
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:53,403
I saw several baskets of
them backstage!

291
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,197
Singers? Singers

292
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,309
How strange!

293
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,371
But only two will be winners!

294
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:07,985
So let's hear first from Miss Dao

295
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:11,418
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Dao!

296
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,319
She is our first contestant
for tonight

297
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,987
Miss... Dao!

298
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,824
She's as light skinned as a Burmese

299
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,660
and has pretty Indian eyes!

300
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:34,370
When the sun goes down

301
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:40,178
When I'm famous, I'll leave for home...

302
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:44,981
I'll bear every hardship

303
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:48,490
to become a country singer

304
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:56,624
and sing for my peers and my fans!

305
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,540
Pan! You're on next! Okay!

306
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,773
Ask him which song he's going to sing!

307
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,004
What are you singing?

308
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,347
I'll sing...

309
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,483
The Sad Soldier

310
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,484
Ho! What song's that?

311
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,315
No such song!

312
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,583
Anyone in the band know it?

313
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,285
Can you play it? He can't

314
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:27,019
Sorry, guy, we don't know your song

315
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,567
Change it! Sing something else!

316
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,833
No, I want to sing this song

317
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,463
But the band can't play it!

318
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,306
I can do it without music

319
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,745
Hey, this guy is great!

320
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,580
I want to hear him!

321
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,019
He has balls!

322
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,853
Pan! Let's get back to the camp!

323
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,401
The hot winds wafted

324
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:17,208
over the rice paddy last April

325
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,083
I had to leave

326
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:27,213
when the hot winds came

327
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:35,958
Sad soldier, I had to leave

328
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:43,800
I hugged you, telling you not to cry

329
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:53,012
Seeing your tears wrung my heart

330
00:30:53,451 --> 00:31:02,450
I felt sorry for you, I felt so sad

331
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:11,262
From now on, who would help you plough?

332
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:18,966
I worried about you
I didn't want to go

333
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:24,804
I remember it so well

334
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:30,251
at New Year last year...
I wore a beautiful shirt

335
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:42,125
And you, my sweetheart
you wore a blue blouse

336
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:46,633
I recall the fragrant scent
on your cheeks

337
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:51,071
So nice it made the moon envious

338
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,803
I promised

339
00:31:54,979 --> 00:32:00,611
to be back next New Year

340
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,685
The full moon of April...

341
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:11,955
is back now

342
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:18,200
But this New Year I'm alone

343
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:22,931
thinking of you far away

344
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:31,711
Sad soldier, I long for you

345
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:35,515
I have to spend

346
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:40,852
New Year alone without you

347
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,348
We've arrived!

348
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,175
Thanks

349
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:55,621
Hey, don't go in empty handed!
Carry this!

350
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,731
Hang on, there may be cash in there

351
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,734
No, not this time! Go on!

352
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,890
Never...

353
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:36,303
I'll never forget
as the moon never forgets the sky...

354
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,125
Yes sir!

355
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,369
This is not a hotel!

356
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,404
Why are you lying here
did you get kicked out?

357
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,336
What's your name? Pan, Sir

358
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,206
Pan who? Pan, the singer...

359
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,404
Oh, right, Pan from last night

360
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,340
Good! Follow me!

361
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,118
My name is Suwat

362
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,920
People in this business
call me Daddy

363
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,188
You've probably never heard of me

364
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,298
I stay off stage

365
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,364
I never take credit for what I do

366
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,832
Surapol, Sornkiri, Sayan, Chaiya

367
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,474
I'm the one behind them all

368
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,042
You know Sayan, right?

369
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,803
When he was starting out

370
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,476
he kept changing his style

371
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,847
His songs didn't really click

372
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,380
He asked me for help

373
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,988
Daddy, I need your help

374
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,487
It's been three years now

375
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,751
I want to send 10,000 baht home

376
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,528
I've only managed to send husks

377
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,221
Daddy, please help me!

378
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,832
You know what I told him?

379
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,258
Grow a beard

380
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,863
A beard?

381
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,494
That's all it took!

382
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,335
Now he coins it in!

383
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,706
Listen to me, Plern

384
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,572
It's Pan, Sir

385
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,646
Yes, Pan, listen to me

386
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,677
All the famous singers I've made:

387
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:05,845
If they were good, they did well

388
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,254
Remember: Be good and you'll do well

389
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,729
Obey me and you'll make it

390
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,524
Remember that

391
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,191
I've seen plenty of stoneheads:

392
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,302
Believe me

393
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:24,002
they didn't listen, they failed

394
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,888
My karma is a burden to me

395
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,958
Whenever I make someone famous

396
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,425
they forget all their gratitude to me

397
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,398
When they can fly with their own wings

398
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:56,730
they forget the nest
in which they were nurtured

399
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:02,076
People like that
will never go very far, I tell you

400
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,326
Take off your shirt

401
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:27,165
Come on, take it off!
Don't you want to be famous?

402
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,244
Are you sure of your career choice?
Yes

403
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,480
Good, in order to become a singer

404
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,251
you need to work very hard

405
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,754
Sir, I'm used to that

406
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,158
Good!

407
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:58,524
Start with the magic word: Endurance

408
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:04,435
Hang on to it
and your wishes will come true

409
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,600
You'll get all you want!

410
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,645
A house... Girls...

411
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,783
Whoever, whatever!

412
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,548
You like girls, I suppose?

413
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,620
I think I'd like
my wife and child with me

414
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,958
You're married! Nice!

415
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,324
It's good to have a loving family!

416
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,119
Can I put on my shirt?

417
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:32,728
From now on, call me Daddy

418
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,037
You can stay here for now

419
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,697
I will move you to my house later on

420
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:42,574
Don't forget, Plern...

421
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,909
It's Pan, Sir

422
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,209
Don't forget, Pan

423
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,250
remember what I said

424
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,045
Be good and you'll do well!

425
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,793
I don't like stoneheads

426
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,823
I've never been ungrateful, sir

427
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,365
When can I start singing, Daddy?

428
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,833
What?

429
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,000
There's no rush!

430
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,773
First things first...

431
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,160
Handsome!

432
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,601
Bring my girls some water

433
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,365
On the double!

434
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,742
Fifteen minute break, girls

435
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,017
Handsome! Buy me a Krathing Daeng!

436
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,980
One bottle

437
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,282
And cigarettes for me!

438
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,301
One month later

439
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,422
You ran away from the army?

440
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,827
Yes, so I have to stay

441
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:45,229
If I go back, they'll jail me for life

442
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,903
Never mind the jail

443
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,800
They'll shoot you!

444
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,201
What?

445
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,434
Shoot me? Damn right!

446
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,441
14 months later

447
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:06,485
27 months later

448
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,924
Stop, stop!

449
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,653
How annoying!
How many times must I tell you?

450
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:18,962
Together now! 5, 6, 7, 8...

451
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,316
Please think of me

452
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,517
O please...

453
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:47,357
Do you still think

454
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,090
of me...

455
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:57,901
Never forget, never for...

456
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:10,314
we are apart, but our hearts are close

457
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,518
TITS, ASS, BALLS

458
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,423
She takes on all comers!

459
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:23,195
She can crush the balls
of any male star...

460
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,335
She can overtake Dao Mayuree

461
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,731
Morning and night

462
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,599
she can suck for James

463
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,969
challenge Arpaporn Nakornsawan

464
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,008
crush the balls of Chaiya Mitchai

465
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,110
grab the guts of Roong Suriya

466
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,271
split the legs of Siriporn...

467
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,009
Is she a hooker?

468
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,810
She's a singer! A singer?

469
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,118
Her voice is so sexy!

470
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,119
She is...

471
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,317
the new sensation:

472
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,825
Dao Saosuantang!

473
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,964
Give her a big hand
ladies and gentlemen!

474
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:56,894
Here she is...

475
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,559
With more than twenty dancers!

476
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,263
When I least expected it...

477
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,137
In just one glimpse

478
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:10,735
it blinded me

479
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:14,145
Everything about him is perfect

480
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,515
He makes my heart pound

481
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:21,681
I don't know or care

482
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:26,387
I wait for him to smile

483
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,360
To come closer
and whisper sweet nothing...

484
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:29,863
How is it going, Pan?

485
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,329
There...

486
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,733
Bring the rest of them...

487
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,464
Love came suddenly

488
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,939
when I least expected it

489
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,739
In just one glimpse

490
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,543
it blinded me

491
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,778
Everything about him is perfect

492
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,787
He makes my heart pound

493
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,483
I don't know or care
if he's good or bad

494
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,494
I wait for him to smile

495
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,154
To come closer

496
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,798
and whisper sweet nothing

497
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:06,527
My song is the breeze

498
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:14,142
that blows towards him...

499
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:15,972
When I arrived here

500
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,843
Daddy said my dreams would come true

501
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,007
I'd become famous

502
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,014
I'd have my own house and car

503
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,711
But after two years

504
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,822
I'm still mopping floors

505
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,889
You know

506
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,426
wannabe stars like you

507
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,563
I've seen lots of them here

508
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,425
None of them made it

509
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:40,794
My heart was full of dreams too
when I came here

510
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,172
You... a singer?

511
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,775
Yes

512
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,341
You must have been a handsome man

513
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:51,274
See, you're the wrong sex

514
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,473
You see...

515
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,276
Look at the girls here...

516
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,113
They can go far, fast

517
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:02,390
Because they have tits and asses

518
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,792
What have you got? Balls

519
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:06,885
Right

520
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,235
Pan, what's the matter?

521
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,881
Well...

522
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,952
I...

523
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,618
When will I get a chance to sing?

524
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,463
You said you loved this career...

525
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,795
I do

526
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,095
It takes time to prove true love

527
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,366
But I've been here two years

528
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,508
You think we're folding
paper bags here?

529
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,578
Let me tell you
the economy is bad right now

530
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,043
I can't afford to take risks!

531
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,341
Do you know how much we owe the bank?

532
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,916
If we went bankrupt

533
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,748
how many people would be out of work?

534
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,015
I'll tell you what, Pan

535
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:11,318
tomorrow you will have...

536
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,526
a job

537
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,095
food on your plate

538
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,664
and a bed

539
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,426
Be grateful for it!

540
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,230
You told me you were not ungrateful!

541
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,597
But now you're starting
to behave selfishly

542
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,535
I'm sorry

543
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,616
But what about the girls?

544
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,849
Why do girls get ahead?

545
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:45,084
They have tits and asses...

546
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,390
You only have balls

547
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:07,507
Is Dao here?

548
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,945
In her dressing room

549
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,020
Here, clean my car

550
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,170
Stay with me

551
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,309
I love it when you laugh!

552
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,746
Here sir Thanks

553
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,853
Hang on!

554
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,210
Dao! Dao!

555
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:58,926
Balm!

556
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:23,211
Rub balm on my temples, Pan

557
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:40,664
That's nice...

558
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,909
Pan, massage me here...

559
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:38,946
SURAPAN PETNAMLAI

560
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,256
How do you expect to find him?

561
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,192
There are millions of people

562
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,264
It won't be easy, you know

563
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,126
They live in buildings

564
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:54,260
and there are
hundreds of thousands of buildings

565
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:57,129
How will you know which one he's in?

566
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,936
He said something like
Buppasawan Lane

567
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,874
it can't be that hard to find

568
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,111
What should I take him as a gift?

569
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:11,220
Maybe a bullet or two! That bastard!

570
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,313
Once he's doing well

571
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,857
he forgets his family

572
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,087
She could have died without us

573
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:22,962
Rainwater

574
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,960
What about rainwater, Dad?

575
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,366
It's less tasty in the city!

576
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,403
The city is damn filthy!

577
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,667
How can rain taste good?

578
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,755
Oy! Yes?

579
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,189
Take care of my baby

580
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:54,058
Of course, and I want to see
Pan's blood when you get back!

581
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,549
Can I help you?

582
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,948
We're looking for the singer Pan

583
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,349
Pan?

584
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,253
My husband!

585
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,482
I've brought him rainwater

586
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,422
There's a show at Wat Mai tonight

587
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,189
they've all gone to prepare for it

588
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,458
Shit! How can we get to that temple?

589
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,338
You could take a water taxi

590
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,669
Or the number 40 bus

591
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,910
Is Pan famous yet?

592
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,546
You'll see...

593
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,074
What are the Four Virtues?

594
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:50,447
1: Food to eat 2?

595
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,212
Place to stay 3?

596
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:53,515
Hole to pierce 4?

597
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,282
Staying power!

598
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,787
Where's Plern?

599
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,493
There's a big crowd waiting...

600
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:02,527
Found him yet?

601
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:06,193
Not yet, dunno where he's got to

602
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,598
Go find him!

603
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,102
The bastard!

604
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,740
He's pulled this act once too often!

605
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:15,034
I'll tie up his balls
with a rubber band!

606
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,084
This singer was a born genius

607
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,448
How do you know?

608
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,679
He's born with a mic in one hand

609
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,586
notes in the other

610
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,521
and a keyboard in his mouth!

611
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:32,356
He was born to...

612
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,656
kill Sayan

613
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,230
push out Surachai

614
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,993
turn on Poompuang

615
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,931
split Somying's legs

616
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,369
squeeze the tits of Banyen
suck on Pornsak

617
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:46,871
take out the guts of Arisman
smash Surachai's balls

618
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:54,575
to go between Sangrawee's legs
and take her on...

619
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,886
The man I'm talking about here
is Surapan Petnamlai!

620
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,386
Please give him a round of applause!

621
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:03,492
Together with his dancers!

622
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:18,334
O please don't turn away from me
listen to me

623
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,773
I'm in the wrong, I'm bad

624
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:26,744
I abandoned you

625
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,176
I was cruel

626
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:34,050
I destroyed our love

627
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:38,024
I took a mistress
and betrayed our love

628
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:43,757
whereas I never did you wrong before

629
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:48,127
I hear you cry

630
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,466
and my heart breaks

631
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:59,070
I feel weak thinking of you

632
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,809
I was wrong

633
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,714
I feel guilty about my mistake

634
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,186
I long for you

635
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:15,627
A hundred casual flings can't
compare with your steadfast love!

636
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:19,530
A thousand other women

637
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:25,335
cannot match with you!

638
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:31,640
I'll never turn away...

639
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:37,276
from my dear chili dip again!

640
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,550
I love you with all my heart!

641
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:47,890
I know I've done you wrong!

642
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:54,126
I know now I have disappointed you

643
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,503
My dear, have you forgotten me?

644
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,935
I have made the biggest mistake ever

645
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,203
I'm coming back to you

646
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:09,545
O my love, don't flee from me

647
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,155
let's start all over again!

648
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:20,718
Please forgive me for the past

649
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:54,523
Pan, Pan...

650
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,758
You're going to make it!

651
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:02,965
I'm happy for you, Pan!

652
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:11,212
Pan!

653
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,443
Sadaw!

654
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,798
What are you doing here?

655
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,565
I came with Dad... He's taking a pee

656
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,273
A pee?
