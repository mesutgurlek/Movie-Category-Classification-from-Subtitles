1
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,171
Thank you.
- Thank you.

2
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,517
Thank you.
- Thank you.

3
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,849
My life is nothing less
than a festival.

4
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:20,586
A never ending festival.

5
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,720
In which I am the host
as well as the guest.

6
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:26,596
Me and my alcohol have too much...

7
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,362
...fun all through the
nights together.

8
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,361
There isn't anyone to ask me.

9
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,701
There isn't anyone to stop me.

10
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,203
And when morning arises...

11
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:40,210
...I go back to those four walls...

12
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,612
...which are regarded as
a home by sundry people.

13
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:46,377
The car of my life is going
on this same speed.

14
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:48,720
I ride this car.

15
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:50,880
But I don't have any idea as to...

16
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:53,721
...where it's steering wheel is.

17
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:56,760
In fact, I didn't even know that...

18
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,391
...my car would stop at
a signal very quickly.

19
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:03,229
The first raindrops would
bring such a moment...

20
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:06,238
...with them, after
which everything...

21
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:09,400
...would change for ever and ever.

22
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,414
Police station? Police station?

23
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:04,416
Police station? Police station?

24
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,418
Why don't you take a job
in the police station?

25
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,619
Come here.
- Yes sir.

26
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,748
Give an orange juice.
- Yes Sir.

27
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,918
Just a minute. Give coffee.
- Yes sir.

28
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:15,757
Without milk.
- Yes sir.

29
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:22,166
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

30
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,603
I have come for his bail.

31
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:28,940
You are his father?

32
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,105
I get the salary of a butler,
but I work as a father.

33
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:36,607
Yes?

34
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,616
Twenty two years, eleven
months and nine days.

35
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,621
And since yesterday night, it is...

36
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,850
...sixteen hours that I
am staying with him.

37
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,119
I worry more for him than myself.

38
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:49,855
I stay so worried for him...

39
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,954
There will rarely be any
dad worried so much.

40
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,625
See.

41
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,862
I haven't yet been able
to understand...

42
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,904
...as to how are you related to him.

43
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,802
Please let it be, sir.

44
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:02,466
The mind cannot understand...

45
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,976
...the relations of the heart. So...

46
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:07,639
...what has this child done?

47
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:09,645
Has he committed some serious crime?

48
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:11,081
Please have a seat.

49
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:14,076
Yes sir. Thank you.
Thank you, inspector.

50
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,554
Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay.

51
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:19,490
It is good that the girl didn't
set a police complaint.

52
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,493
She just had you beat up and
let you go. What is it?

53
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,554
Didn't you get any of my principles?

54
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:26,826
You saw a girl on the street.

55
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,128
And you kissed her
in broad daylight?

56
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:30,669
You stay that I stay
away from girls.

57
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:33,004
But the girl was something
like this.

58
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,507
I don't know. My feet
just walked up to her.

59
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:36,906
I couldn't tolerate it.

60
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,500
You mean, because of you...

61
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:40,011
...the girls should stop
going out on the streets?

62
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,911
It doesn't matter, son. Come home.

63
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,040
The limousine is waiting for you.

64
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:46,847
The limousine?
- Yes. - Daddy? - Yes.

65
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,512
No, uncle. I won't go
alone. You will...

66
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:49,850
...have to come with me. Please!

67
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,858
Oh. How will you not go alone? Even
your father will go. All alone.

68
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:54,860
In your father's presence. Come on.

69
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,867
You are keeping the
family's prestige.

70
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:05,535
Drunkard.

71
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,732
You are a very weak man.

72
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,705
I pity you.

73
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,041
Dad, if you had to tell me this...

74
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:13,704
...you could have told
it over the phone.

75
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,044
What was the need of sending... a
limousine and calling me here?

76
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:21,050
I have called you here
to talk about marriage.

77
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:22,747
Marriage?

78
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,949
With Anahita Madhwani.
- Anahita Madhwani!

79
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:38,962
No. Dad.

80
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,903
I can't do this marriage. Please.

81
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:44,740
It is my wish. It is your
grandmother's wish.

82
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,075
And Devendra Madhwani wishes it too.

83
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:50,310
Dad, Devendra Madhwani,
rogue, criminal.

84
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,749
How can he become my father-in-law?

85
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,184
Who isn't a criminal today?

86
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:55,911
In the business circle, everyone...

87
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,752
...is a criminal on a smaller
of higher level.

88
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,587
It will be better...

89
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,093
...that you pay attention
to the wealth that...

90
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:04,596
...you will get by marrying
Anahita Madhwani.

91
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:05,926
Dad see.

92
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,991
I will marry when I
meet such a girl...

93
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:12,936
...who will love me and I can
love her too. All right.

94
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:14,765
Bye.

95
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:17,776
If you don't agree you will
lose 100 million dollars.

96
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,935
You will be disowned from my will.

97
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,345
Mittal house will close it's
doors on you forever.

98
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:23,944
You will have to do hard work.

99
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:25,609
And you will have to earn yourself.

100
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:30,121
Actually, Anahita isn't
that bad a girl.

101
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,152
She is a very sweet girl.

102
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,128
She is a very sweet girl.

103
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,630
She is a very sweet girl.

104
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:45,830
I am ready for the marriage.

105
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:47,832
Wonderful.

106
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,966
Congratulations. Son.
Congratulations.

107
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:52,705
Madhwani will be very
happy hearing this.

108
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,839
Come on, give me a hug.
Give me a hug.

109
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,308
Son. Taking this decision,
you have taken the...

110
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:03,048
...certificate of being rich
all through your life.

111
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:05,985
After mummy's death, what have...

112
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,856
...I got from you and this family?

113
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:09,655
Except wealth? Yes?

114
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:20,001
Are you thinking of filling
the swimming pool...

115
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:21,836
...with alcohol and jumping in it?

116
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:25,671
Jumping?

117
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:28,009
John uncle, please move from my way.

118
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,015
I am very angry. I don't want to...

119
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,849
Oh go! Wow! You can show
this arrogance to me.

120
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,354
He doesn't even squeak
to his father, ma'am.

121
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:37,684
What is your name?

122
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,083
What should I do then? Should
I fight? Should I scream?

123
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,858
He won't give me one rupee.

124
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,191
I will move around
hungry and thirsty.

125
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:45,322
You will like it then.

126
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:46,891
John uncle...

127
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,694
This isn't the marriage
of two people.

128
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,702
This is the marriage
of two bank accounts.

129
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,862
Two bank accounts.

130
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:55,036
Eight days. Just eight days.

131
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,302
And that Anahita Madhwani...

132
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,105
...will be clasped to
my neck permanently.

133
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:01,240
And my dad will have a jackpot
permanently, okay?

134
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:04,315
Do you know what the people...

135
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,045
...in rural areas do
to catch a monkey?

136
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:08,320
They put some peanuts in a pot...

137
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:09,878
...and keep it in front
of the monkey.

138
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:12,115
The monkey puts his hand in the pot.

139
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,715
He clenches the peanuts
in his palm...

140
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:15,055
...and he gets stuck up there itself.

141
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:17,890
Then he can't take his
hand out from the pot.

142
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:19,329
Because, to remove his
hand from the pot...

143
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,060
...he will have to let
go of the peanuts.

144
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,734
Your situation is just
like that monkey.

145
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:26,135
You want to be free too. But...

146
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:29,072
...you cannot live without
the peanuts too.

147
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,142
Did you like my philosophy?

148
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,142
I didn't understand that.
- Good.

149
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:35,908
John uncle, I don't understand...

150
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:37,745
...anything about this monkey.
- Okay.

151
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:40,251
I am in a bad state.
- Okay.

152
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,912
Wherever I see...

153
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,751
...that female monkey
Anahita Madhwani...

154
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:45,757
...is jumping and clenching at me.

155
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:57,962
Who is she?

156
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:00,931
What happened?
- That... - What?

157
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,770
The kiss girl.
- The kiss girl?

158
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:03,934
At the bus stop.
- Oh!

159
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,773
The one who made you go to
the police station? - Yes.

160
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,842
She is stealing tie.
She is stealing tie.

161
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,781
Don't look there. Let
her steal comfortably.

162
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:21,793
Look at me...
- Oh oh!

163
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,352
Oh! How the hell are you
related with that?

164
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,403
Bye bye.

165
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,145
Excuse me.

166
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,978
Madam, just a minute.

167
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:51,146
Excuse me. Madam just a minute.

168
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:53,986
Just a minute, madam. Madam,
just a minute.

169
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,322
What is it?
- I want to speak to you.

170
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,487
What do you want to speak about?

171
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:57,824
The item that you took from inside...

172
00:11:57,897 --> 00:11:59,489
...did you pay for it?
- What did you say?

173
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:01,556
It is in your bag... here...
- What?

174
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:03,363
Don't touch!
- What did you say?

175
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,164
What do you think you are?

176
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:06,500
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.

177
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,836
Madam... it is in your bag...
it is in your bag

178
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,001
What is there in my bag?
- Don't you know who I am? - Madam...

179
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:12,339
Please listen to me...
- I will make one phone call...

180
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:13,504
- Madam, please listen to me... - 
This uniform that you have worn...

181
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,342
...you will wear it all through
the night and sleep.

182
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:17,007
You should be given to the police.
- Madam...

183
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,175
Somebody call the police.
- Please madam. Please...

184
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:20,185
Police! Police!
- I will show you right away.

185
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:22,517
Ram Singh... what are you doing
here leaving your work?

186
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:24,249
Mr. Mittal, it is a
very small matter.

187
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:26,848
No, what is the matter?
- Please don't meddle.

188
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,188
No. What... what... what?
What is the matter?

189
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:29,319
Sir. You don't know.

190
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:30,521
This madam has brought
a tie from inside.

191
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:31,858
Without paying for it.

192
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:33,922
See. See it in her bag.
- Brought a tie? - Yes.

193
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,365
Look at it in her bag.

194
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,196
In the bag?
- Yes. Look at it in her bag.

195
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,536
Give me the bag.
- No. - Hold this.

196
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,337
Look at this.

197
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,042
Oh! For me!

198
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:56,411
Thank you! Come here, baby. Come.

199
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,281
I love you so much.

200
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,449
Sorry for that day.
- Shut up, okay.

201
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:03,286
Sir.

202
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,557
Sir...

203
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:15,097
Get lost. Get lost.

204
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:18,068
Hey, auto...

205
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:24,913
Hey, for that day...
- Don't take a...

206
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:27,077
...step ahead or I will
slap you very hard.

207
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:30,987
Okay... I will... I will
drop you home...

208
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:34,084
Wow.

209
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,090
Stealing and attitude on top of it.

210
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:39,590
Now I came to know that the girl...

211
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:41,257
...whom I kissed wasn't
anything common.

212
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:43,095
She was dynamite.

213
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,437
If I would try to find out
anything more than that.

214
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:49,131
Her slap would have turned
into a blast too.

215
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:52,676
All of a sudden, there was
a fire in the chest.

216
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,276
The heart yearned to meet her again.

217
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,616
Brother Nikki... here is your tie.

218
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:11,160
Tie! Tie! Tie!

219
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:14,163
That's enough. Enough of this love.

220
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,564
I don't understand what
you do of these ties.

221
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:21,366
Do you know how many problems
are there in bringing these ties?

222
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,498
Yes... come on now...

223
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:28,637
Oh God! Brother! You
have so many ties?

224
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:35,382
You don't wear them. What
do you do of them?

225
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:40,148
You will have to tell me today.

226
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:42,586
Tell me.

227
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:44,588
Come here.

228
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,395
Come here, please.

229
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,397
Please come here.

230
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:52,530
Sit down here.

231
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:56,405
For my sake. Tell me. What
will you do of these ties?

232
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,404
Tell me...

233
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,643
I will wear it on a suit.
- You will wear it on a suit? - Yes.

234
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,015
Where will you wear a suit?
- In your marriage.

235
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:14,751
In my marriage?

236
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:21,531
How will I marry?
You know what I do.

237
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:24,568
Who will marry me?
- A prince.

238
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:28,097
A prince?
- Yes, a prince.

239
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:32,308
Where will a prince come from?

240
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:35,446
Will he waiting for me
on the streets? - Yes.

241
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,209
Yes?
- Open your mouth.

242
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,550
The Prince. The prince.

243
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:44,785
The prince, the prince, the prince.

244
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,057
Wow!

245
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,058
This is me?

246
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,722
And this, with the tie?

247
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:37,566
'I love you.'

248
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:41,231
'I love you till the
limits of craziness.'

249
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:48,236
'Don't make me crazy till
the limits of craziness.'

250
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:50,179
'O beloved... '

251
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:55,516
'Ask me, how much I love you.'

252
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,180
'O beloved... '

253
00:17:57,256 --> 00:18:02,694
'Ask me, how much I love you.'

254
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:06,695
'I love you.'

255
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:10,202
'I love you till the
limits of craziness.'

256
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:17,539
'Don't make me crazy till
the limits of craziness.'

257
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:42,728
'This isn't a game.'

258
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:46,499
'To fall in love with anyone.'

259
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:54,410
'Don't forget me after falling
in love with me.'

260
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,245
'This isn't a game.'

261
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,653
'To fall in love with anyone.'

262
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:12,254
'Don't forget me after falling
in love with me.'

263
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:19,260
'O beloved! Ask me, how much I
love you.'

264
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:26,801
'O beloved! Ask me,
how much I love you.'

265
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:30,280
'I love you.'

266
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:33,785
'I love you till the
limits of craziness.'

267
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:40,952
'Don't make me crazy will
the limits of craziness.'

268
00:19:56,108 --> 00:20:03,310
'Why have I started becoming
restless now? '

269
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:10,718
'What should I tell you, what
has happened to me now.'

270
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:21,524
'Why have I started becoming
restless now? '

271
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:28,664
'What should I tell you, what
has happened to me now.'

272
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:35,670
'O beloved, what situation
I am in, ask me!

273
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:43,678
'O beloved, what
situation I am in! '

274
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:47,348
'I love you.'

275
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:50,520
'I love you till the
limits of craziness.'

276
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:57,695
'Don't make me crazy till
the limits of craziness.'

277
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:05,040
'O beloved! Ask me,
how much I love you.'

278
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:11,777
'O beloved! Ask me,
how much I love you.'

279
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:19,586
'I love you till the
limits of craziness.'

280
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:26,894
'Don't make me crazy till
the limits of craziness.'

281
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,591
Out. Out.

282
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,758
Don't take her in and bring her.

283
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,930
Come on.

284
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:09,599
To whom will she come in the
times of need if not you?

285
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:13,111
Hey Reshma! Don't butter me.

286
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:16,504
Her needs are never fulfilled.

287
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:19,608
If it is her brother's problem.
She dances on my head.

288
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:21,118
If it is the problem
of her land lord...

289
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:22,778
...she comes to dance on my head.

290
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:23,947
If you want to dance...

291
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:25,786
...why don't you go to
the stage and dance?

292
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:28,122
But where can she do that too?

293
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,626
I will go home at eleven o' clock.

294
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:32,789
I won't go out with anyone.

295
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:35,627
I won't sit with anyone
and drink alcohol.

296
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:38,795
She will just ask a loan from
me and drink my blood.

297
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:40,463
Brother...

298
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,632
Doesn't she create magic
when she is on stage?

299
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:43,968
Reshma!

300
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:47,637
Don't waste your time
in her problems.

301
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:48,975
You go and do your work.

302
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:52,142
I won't give her anything.

303
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:54,475
She hasn't returned the loan...

304
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,145
...and she is talking...
- Come on.

305
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:57,688
Please forgive me. You go.

306
00:22:58,657 --> 00:22:59,885
Oh! Go!

307
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,652
Jiya...

308
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:06,690
Bye.
- Bye.

309
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,657
Good morning.

310
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:12,895
Wherever you see, he follows me.

311
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:18,734
Oh!

312
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,909
Come with me and don't turn around.

313
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,677
What... what happened?
- Silent. - Let me go inside.

314
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:26,843
Where do you want to go?

315
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:28,853
I have to take the rent
for the house from Jiya.

316
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,912
Hey, don't talk...
- I know she is inside there.

317
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:32,581
She is not here.
- Let me go inside.

318
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,853
Hey, what are you doing?

319
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,861
I will take my rent today.

320
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:44,093
Thank you.

321
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:45,761
Hey!

322
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:47,528
Don't you think that
fate is trying...

323
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:48,868
...to make us meet repeatedly?

324
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,599
I mean... you know...

325
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,544
No?
- Taxi!

326
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:56,078
Okay. I have a car.
I can drop you home.

327
00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:58,543
You are chasing me. Stay away.

328
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:01,108
By the way, there is
a restaurant nearby.

329
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:03,211
We can go and have food, have
some coffee. Something...

330
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:06,552
If I had free time, I
would be in the bar.

331
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,718
I would be dancing
and earning money.

332
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:11,061
I can give you money.

333
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,154
Just because I dance in a bar...

334
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:15,757
...it doesn't mean that I am
a prostitute, understood?

335
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,062
See. You misunderstood me.

336
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:18,728
I was just speaking about coffee.

337
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:22,171
That... that too, in
a public place, okay?

338
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,736
Your like...

339
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:30,741
This means... that you want
to just spend time with me?

340
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:36,587
That will take money.

341
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:39,920
Yes. How much? Two thousand... three
thousand. - Three thousand.

342
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:41,218
All right.

343
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,664
Only one hour.
- Okay. All right.

344
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:52,761
And don't come close to me.
- No.

345
00:24:57,776 --> 00:24:59,334
I don't have many friends.

346
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:02,772
But the ones who are, call me Daksh.

347
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:05,781
What is your name?
- Why should I tell you?

348
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:09,218
Wow! Your parents have
named you so nicely.

349
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:13,019
Why should I tell you? Very nice.
- Jiya.

350
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:15,821
If you just keep babbling
like this, I am going.

351
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:19,791
Okay. After this, I won't
utter another syllable.

352
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:20,957
That's it.

353
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:23,797
From this time, My name
is Deaf and Dumb.

354
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,131
Very funny.

355
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,224
Thank you.
- Sorry.

356
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:05,995
Oh god!

357
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,898
The time is done, the money is over.

358
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,408
Is it necessary to go? Please
stay some more. - Bye.

359
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:13,738
Okay, if I wish, you can
stay for some more time.

360
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:15,404
According to your way.
Yes. Your way.

361
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:17,907
I can arrange as much
money as you want.

362
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:19,746
Only one week.

363
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:21,809
You seriously have some problem

364
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:24,754
If you really have so much
money you should go to...

365
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:27,815
...a good psychiatrist and
cure yourself. Okay?

366
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:31,089
We will never meet after today.

367
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:35,160
What rubbish.

368
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,928
See, fate is trying to make
us meet again and again.

369
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:40,096
Who knows? What if this fate
unites us forever and ever?

370
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,164
Fate didn't make us meet.
I came according to my own.

371
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:45,266
That means you don't
believe in fate?

372
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,438
No. Fate is for rich
people like you.

373
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:51,778
People like us move with
our fates in our pockets.

374
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,182
Okay. Just a second, just a second.
One second please.

375
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:55,446
Do you have a pen?

376
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:56,980
What?

377
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:00,952
If fate wishes that we should
unite forever see...

378
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:06,957
...sometime or the other this
note will surely reach you.

379
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:10,025
All right?

380
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:11,797
Two candy floss please. Pen.

381
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:17,032
Candy floss.

382
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:20,310
I have an idea. You go to America.

383
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,437
I have heard...

384
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:24,004
...there are very good psychiatrists
there. Bye.

385
00:28:24,316 --> 00:28:26,807
Okay, before going, some address...
...phone number, just tell me...

386
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:30,878
I just came with you,
because I needed money.

387
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:33,891
No address. No telephone number.

388
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,224
And don't follow me.

389
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:56,003
How much did you drink?

390
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:01,350
Wow! It is a miracle today.
You didn't drink any.

391
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,412
Otherwise, your whole
body stinks of alcohol.

392
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:06,389
Are you all right, son?

393
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,857
Yes.

394
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:09,118
Then?

395
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:10,859
Because I met her last night too.

396
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:14,021
Okay... that tie thief? Okay. Okay.

397
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:17,193
So you didn't drink because of her?

398
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,196
Wow.

399
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:22,204
I didn't feel like drinking.
- Oh God!

400
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:26,037
And whenever she meets me,
I won't drink. - Oh God!

401
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:28,937
She is a very good girl.

402
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:31,381
She is honest.

403
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:33,544
She is smart.

404
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,952
She is smarter than you.

405
00:29:38,957 --> 00:29:41,482
Play son. Play. Play till
you feel like it.

406
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,084
And then throw her away.

407
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:46,228
Rich son of a rich father.

408
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:50,064
Won't you marry the girl
whom you father chooses?

409
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:53,098
Come on. I can sleep a bit,
now that you have come.

410
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:55,236
Move it. Yes.

411
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:57,405
Come on.

412
00:29:58,243 --> 00:30:03,078
Oh! Very good. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

413
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,581
Wow.

414
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:21,927
Girl friend?

415
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:25,096
Good. Good. Good.

416
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:43,112
Take it. Take the comb.

417
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:45,284
Become smart.

418
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:48,117
Take it. Take the comb.

419
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,131
What!

420
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:03,299
Taxi...

421
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:09,371
Taxi...

422
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,140
Hey! Hey!

423
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:13,047
Nikki! Nikki son, come
back down here.

424
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:16,485
Please come down. Please...
please come down.

425
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:18,318
Please come down. Please...
please come down.

426
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,483
Please come down. Please...
please come down.

427
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,049
See, Jiya has come.

428
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:31,393
Let me go. Move aside.

429
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,066
Please come down.

430
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:39,337
What happened to him?
- No, madam.

431
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:42,005
When the ward boy went to
clean the room Nikki...

432
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,014
...wasn't in the room. He
went to the terrace...

433
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:46,016
...and closed the door.
And he started saying...

434
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:48,018
...that he will jump down. It
is more than an hour, madam.

435
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:49,348
I will go upstairs.

436
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:51,546
See. There isn't any way to go up.

437
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:53,750
You don't go upstairs.
You stay here.

438
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,190
We are there, isn't it?
- Oh! Him!

439
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,693
Come down. Come down, Nikki.

440
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:58,023
Come down, Nikki!

441
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:03,526
Nikki!

442
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:06,102
I will jump! I will jump!

443
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:17,579
I will jump!

444
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:22,052
Please don't jump. I have come.

445
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,385
I will jump.

446
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:27,049
Bring him down.

447
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,717
Bring him down.

448
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,222
Hi!

449
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,562
You... you... you... what
are you doing here?

450
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:44,234
Good question. What am I doing here?

451
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:49,577
Yes. I had come with your sister.
- Sister?

452
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:51,238
Yes. Your sister is
down there, isn't it?

453
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,477
Sister. I will jump down!

454
00:32:55,754 --> 00:32:58,154
Yes. I came here and I saw
that you are jumping.

455
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:01,421
See. I don't have any problem.
Jump from here.

456
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:05,085
But before going, tell me something.

457
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:07,256
Why are you jumping?

458
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:12,096
That... Biba... Biba... that
rascal Biba... - Yes?

459
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,504
He took four of my ties!
- He took four of your ties?

460
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:19,270
He took four of my ties!
Yes. Biba the rascal!

461
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:21,502
Then... so what if he took
four of your ties?

462
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,444
How will I wear a tie
on my sister's wedding?

463
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:29,619
How will I wear it?
- Oh! Very sad.

464
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:32,282
It doesn't matter. I have many ties.

465
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:35,318
I have ties of every color.
- Yes?

466
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:37,452
I have red tie, I have a blue
tie, I have a green tie.

467
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,463
Suit... do you have a suit?

468
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:43,328
Yes. I have a suit too. I
have a suit of every color.

469
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,198
Red suit, blue suit, green suit.

470
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,204
You don't have maroon...
you don't have maroon.

471
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:49,137
I have a maroon suit.

472
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:51,203
I have twelve dozen maroon suits.

473
00:33:51,276 --> 00:33:53,870
Give me one, give me
one, give me one.

474
00:33:58,216 --> 00:34:00,207
What is the need of giving you?
You are jumping from here.

475
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:02,149
I won't jump. I won't
jump. I won't jump.

476
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,312
Give me one. Give me one.

477
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:04,480
I will do like this. I will give
the maroon suit to someone else.

478
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:05,614
I will give it to Biba.

479
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,487
No! Not Biba! Biba the
rascal! Not Biba!

480
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,151
Give it to me please!
Please give me one.

481
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,319
One. Just one.

482
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:13,153
Yes. Okay.

483
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:16,494
Okay. I will give you the suit.
Give me your hand.

484
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:20,668
Give me your hand, or
I will give it to Biba.

485
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,333
No. Not Biba! Not Biba!
Biba rascal! Not Biba.

486
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:24,841
Give me your hand.

487
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:36,345
Nikki brother!

488
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:40,517
Some one stop him!

489
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:43,686
Nikki brother!

490
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:50,200
Oh! Help me! Help me!

491
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:02,542
You have a maroon suit, isn't it?
- Yes, I have a maroon suit.

492
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:03,706
You have a tie too?

493
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:05,374
I want the maroon suit.
Just the maroon suit.

494
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,384
Yes. I have a maroon suit.
- Promise?

495
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:08,612
Yes. Promise, promise. Promise.

496
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:10,620
I want a tie too, give me a tie too.

497
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,223
Maroon suit. You have a
maroon suit, isn't it?

498
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,553
Yes. I have the maroon suit.
- You give me a tie too.

499
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:15,718
I have twelve dozens.
I have twelve dozens.

500
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:18,228
I have twelve dozen maroon suits.
I will take one. I will take one.

501
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:20,230
Come on. Nikki. Come on, Nikki.

502
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:22,425
Yes, you have come?
- Yes I have come.

503
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,409
Come on. Come on, Nikki.
- Yes, come on.

504
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:36,439
Tie... tie... tie...
- Come on, come on, come on.

505
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:40,578
Will you take one?
- Yes, it is all right.

506
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,655
Bye.
- Bye.

507
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:53,756
Listen...

508
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:59,430
Will you meet me tomorrow?

509
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:06,769
17th Victoria cross road?

510
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:08,607
South?

511
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:11,876
Ten O'clock.

512
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:50,310
'I have decided.'

513
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:53,321
'I have decided.'

514
00:36:53,391 --> 00:37:01,662
'Whatever be the case,
I will love you.'

515
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,667
'I have decided.'

516
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:06,670
'I have decided.'

517
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:15,339
'Whatever be the case,
I will love you.'

518
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,347
'I have decided.'

519
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:20,507
'I have decided.'

520
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:23,419
'I have decided.'

521
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:51,711
'This is the separation
of a few days.'

522
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:54,547
'This is a distance of a few days.'

523
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:57,554
'Then, every season
is that of meeting.'

524
00:37:57,622 --> 00:38:00,887
'Then every moment is so saffron! '

525
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:09,897
'What should I tell you
about the state of this...

526
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:12,801
...heart? I cannot
tell you anything.'

527
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,930
'You have made me so restless.'

528
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:19,408
'I cannot stay apart from
you even for a moment.'

529
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:23,911
'I have decided.'

530
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:26,910
'I have decided.'

531
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:35,585
'Whatever be the case,
I will love you.'

532
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,423
'I have decided.'

533
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:41,761
'I have decided.'

534
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:11,956
'I didn't say anything with words.'

535
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,056
'I said everything without
saying anything.'

536
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:21,629
You gave me the gift
of my love freely.'

537
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:29,970
'There wasn't such fun ever.'

538
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,484
'There wasn't such a
season before this.'

539
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:39,649
'Before I met you, there was
loneliness in my life.'

540
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,492
'I have decided.'

541
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:47,226
'I have decided.'

542
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:55,495
'Whatever be the case,
I will love you.'

543
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:57,507
'I have decided.'

544
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:01,175
'I have decided.'

545
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:09,509
'Whatever be the case,
I will love you.'

546
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:12,021
'I have decided.'

547
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,854
'I have decided.'

548
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:18,187
'I have decided.'

549
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:21,861
'I have decided.'

550
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,697
The shoe is broken.

551
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:33,543
It doesn't matter. Come on.

552
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:37,707
No.
- Come on. I won't bite.

553
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:39,941
Come on!

554
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:16,177
Jiya, do you know?

555
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:21,310
I never looked after anyone in life.

556
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:26,183
Always, someone has looked after me.

557
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:33,661
God forbid that you
fall ill someday...

558
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:36,823
...or something happens to you...

559
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:40,829
...then I will come
to look after you.

560
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:45,066
Okay.

561
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:48,835
Then I will fall ill today itself.

562
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:52,839
And then I will stay ill
throughout my life.

563
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,851
Then I will take care
of you throughout life.

564
00:43:54,912 --> 00:43:57,403
Daksh...
- Yes?

565
00:43:57,548 --> 00:43:58,913
Tell me something.

566
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:02,251
Who are you?

567
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:06,085
Are you the one who
came on the streets...

568
00:44:06,157 --> 00:44:08,421
...and kissed me like
a shameless person?

569
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:13,429
Or are you the one who
shied away from me now?

570
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:21,264
I don't know.

571
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:23,937
I am a bit impulsive.

572
00:44:24,942 --> 00:44:27,775
Who himself doesn't
know what he will do.

573
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,178
Jiya, I am like this since my birth.

574
00:44:33,284 --> 00:44:35,445
I have done everything
wrong since birth.

575
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:40,514
But not any longer.

576
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:44,458
Now. Whatever I do, I
will think about it.

577
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:47,292
And I will do it in the right way.
- How?

578
00:44:48,966 --> 00:44:50,957
You won't laugh?
- No.

579
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:52,796
Promise?
- Promise.

580
00:44:55,473 --> 00:44:57,338
The elder's permission is taken
for marriage, isn't it?

581
00:44:58,142 --> 00:45:01,543
I will come to your house tomorrow.
You call your brother.

582
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:03,136
I will come to your house tomorrow...

583
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:05,148
...and ask your brother for
your hand in marriage.

584
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,150
I will take his permission
for marriage.

585
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:09,978
Yes?

586
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:21,158
See, you are laughing. I know
that I do everything wrong.

587
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:23,332
No, you fool.

588
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:27,996
I am laughing so that
I can stop my tears.

589
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:30,999
Do you know?

590
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,509
I thought that all this only
happens in fairy tales.

591
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:38,507
Every girl isn't lucky
like Cinderella.

592
00:45:42,386 --> 00:45:43,853
But I am.

593
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:50,350
So, I can come to your
house tomorrow?

594
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:55,023
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

595
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:02,198
What happened?

596
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:06,534
Did you change your decision?

597
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:10,206
No. Before meeting your
brother I will have...

598
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,875
...to take permission
from someone else.

599
00:46:13,384 --> 00:46:14,476
Whom?

600
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:18,046
Hitler.

601
00:46:28,399 --> 00:46:29,457
You fool!

602
00:46:30,968 --> 00:46:32,959
The doctor tells me...

603
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:35,967
Leave smoking the hookah
or else you will die.

604
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:39,568
I said... you fool!

605
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,905
I have got just one life.

606
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:45,579
If I don't smoke the hookah
in that fie on my life!

607
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:51,077
Come on! Come on! Take a puff too!

608
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:55,422
The thing that isn't coming
from your tongue to words...

609
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:57,586
...that will come out as
soon as you take a puff.

610
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:00,587
Come on! Take this! Take a puff.

611
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:15,109
Did you enjoy it? Did you enjoy it?

612
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:18,271
Now, tell your grandma clearly.

613
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:20,283
What is your problem? Yes.

614
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:24,681
Grandma, I don't want
to marry Anahita.

615
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,450
Really?

616
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:33,028
Grandma, a few days ago,
I met a girl.

617
00:47:35,032 --> 00:47:37,296
You are just like your grandfather.

618
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:39,629
If your grandfather liked someone...

619
00:47:39,703 --> 00:47:42,171
...he would get ready to marry her.

620
00:47:42,706 --> 00:47:45,300
Your grandpa's grandpa
made him understand...

621
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:48,140
...that if you want to drink the
water from a well, drink it.

622
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:51,306
But what is the need of bring
the well in the house?

623
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:53,973
Did you understand what I am saying?

624
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,310
Paani Puri! Paani Puri!

625
00:47:56,387 --> 00:48:00,187
We will have 'Paani Puri'! Bring
it fast, Rosie, yes!

626
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:01,656
Yes. This is something.

627
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:03,659
Tell me something, Rosie?
- Yes?

628
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:05,991
Is my grandson handsome?

629
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:08,156
Yes. He is very handsome.

630
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:14,665
Oh! He has shied away! Okay,
you go. Go. - Yes.

631
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:23,507
This girl, whom you met a few...

632
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:26,175
...days ago who is she after all?

633
00:48:27,084 --> 00:48:31,180
What does it matter, grandma? She
is a nobody. But I love her.

634
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:35,351
Listen.

635
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:38,687
You are accustomed to wealth.

636
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:41,189
You move around in the
biggest of cars.

637
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:43,028
You drink the most
expensive alcohol.

638
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:48,028
You are not able to live the
life of poverty now. Yes.

639
00:48:50,374 --> 00:48:54,367
You will have to marry Anahita.

640
00:48:57,114 --> 00:48:59,708
This grandma... and your father.

641
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:02,381
They are very dangerous.

642
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,554
If you don't listen
to us, you wont...

643
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:09,386
...get anything from the
wealth of this family.

644
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,051
I will shut down your bank account.

645
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:14,120
I will snatch your credit card!

646
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:19,596
I am a bitch! I am a bitch!
- Grandma...

647
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:20,728
Listen.

648
00:49:21,138 --> 00:49:25,404
You are my small and innocent child.

649
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:29,405
See.

650
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,081
Shall I tell you a way to come out
of this quicksand of this heart?

651
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:35,810
Do one thing.

652
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:38,280
Marry Anahita.

653
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:41,287
And make this nobody your mistress.

654
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:44,252
She is happy too, we are happy too.

655
00:49:44,328 --> 00:49:46,262
Grandma...
- Shut up.

656
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,356
Shut up! Shut up!

657
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:08,116
'This is an ebbing color.'

658
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:14,287
'Lt has scattered on my veil.'

659
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:25,130
'All the aroma is
in my embrace now.'

660
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:33,473
'My feet don't settle
on the ground.'

661
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:39,000
'This is a strange mischief
within me.'

1
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,713
'This is a strange mischief
within me.'

2
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:54,559
'Today, I feel that
I am in the breeze.'

3
00:50:54,632 --> 00:50:58,898
'I have got such happiness today.'

4
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:05,570
'My heart is not in
my control today.'

5
00:51:05,643 --> 00:51:10,080
'I have got such happiness today.'

6
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:16,643
'Today, I feel that
I am in the breeze.'

7
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:21,158
'The meeting of a moment
has colored now.'

8
00:51:48,686 --> 00:51:55,615
'The meeting of a moment
has colored now.'

9
00:52:01,032 --> 00:52:07,631
'The meeting of a moment
has colored now.'

10
00:52:07,705 --> 00:52:14,804
'The meeting of a
moment has colored now.'

11
00:52:15,713 --> 00:52:20,309
'Lt has become a guest
forever and ever.'

12
00:52:20,384 --> 00:52:24,980
'I have got such happiness today.'

13
00:52:26,824 --> 00:52:31,659
'Lt has become a guest
forever and ever.'

14
00:52:31,729 --> 00:52:36,666
'I have got such happiness today.'

15
00:53:19,877 --> 00:53:26,715
'The beauty of shyness
has draped me today.'

16
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:38,728
'The beauty of shyness
has draped me today.'

17
00:53:38,796 --> 00:53:46,066
'The beauty of shyness
has draped me today.'

18
00:53:46,804 --> 00:53:51,798
'Lt seems that I have
become a bride.'

19
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:56,245
'I have got such happiness today.'

20
00:53:57,915 --> 00:54:02,909
'Lt seems that I have
become a bride.'

21
00:54:02,987 --> 00:54:07,083
'I have got such happiness today.'

22
00:54:07,258 --> 00:54:13,754
'I have got such happiness today.'

23
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,104
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

24
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:29,936
Brother... brother... sit down...
phone... yes, phone.

25
00:54:30,848 --> 00:54:31,940
Hello.

26
00:54:33,851 --> 00:54:34,943
Hello, Jiya.

27
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:38,319
You aren't coming?

28
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:45,292
Sorry, Jiya.

29
00:54:46,297 --> 00:54:49,061
I can't come today. I am sorry.

30
00:54:49,967 --> 00:54:54,301
It's okay. If not today,
some other time.

31
00:54:56,307 --> 00:54:57,501
Tomorrow?

32
00:55:00,144 --> 00:55:03,409
Jiya. Actually, I can't
come tomorrow too.

33
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:10,348
Actually. I won't be able
to meet you from today.

34
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:16,485
I am to be engaged, Jiya. I am sorry.

35
00:55:23,901 --> 00:55:25,163
It doesn't matter.

36
00:55:25,336 --> 00:55:28,499
At least we got to spend some
moments of life together.

37
00:55:28,906 --> 00:55:30,168
Thank you, Daksh.

38
00:56:01,539 --> 00:56:03,268
Come on, brother.
- He will come.

39
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:07,204
He will come. He will
come. He will come.

40
00:56:08,546 --> 00:56:11,879
He will come. He will
come. He will come.

41
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:17,050
Nobody will come.
- He will come.

42
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:19,219
Nobody will come.
- He will come.

43
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,281
Didn't I tell you that
nobody will come?

44
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:23,549
Nobody will come.

45
00:57:13,277 --> 00:57:14,437
John uncle!

46
00:57:15,446 --> 00:57:16,606
John uncle!

47
00:57:19,016 --> 00:57:20,278
John uncle!

48
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:21,943
Yes sir, tell me.

49
00:57:23,287 --> 00:57:26,950
Are you John uncle? Did I call you?

50
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:31,617
Go away from here.
- Sorry sir. - Wait.

51
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:39,461
I am sorry.

52
00:57:40,037 --> 00:57:42,369
I am taking someone's
anger on someone.

53
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:44,304
No problem sir, no problem.

54
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:47,310
Where is John uncle?
- Sir, he has gone to the hospital.

55
00:57:48,045 --> 00:57:49,376
What has happened to him?

56
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:52,176
Son. I am dying. I am dying.

57
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:53,648
John uncle, what childishness
is this?

58
00:57:53,717 --> 00:57:56,481
Son, my thirty suits,
my fifteen shoes...

59
00:57:56,554 --> 00:57:58,988
...my twenty ties and
my property in Goa...

60
00:57:59,056 --> 00:58:01,149
I will make all of
them in your name.

61
00:58:01,225 --> 00:58:03,591
John uncle, you stop this joke.
Or should I go from here?

62
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:05,494
This isn't a joke.

63
00:58:05,563 --> 00:58:07,497
I have brain tumor.
- I am going.

64
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:08,623
This isn't a joke.
- I don't want to talk to you.

65
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:09,996
This isn't a joke.
- Hey, wait! Come back.

66
00:58:10,067 --> 00:58:12,001
I am all right. Come on. Come on.

67
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:13,331
Will you joke again?

68
00:58:13,404 --> 00:58:15,338
What is it? You don't let
me act properly too.

69
00:58:15,406 --> 00:58:16,498
Come on.

70
00:58:20,611 --> 00:58:23,512
How are you?
- I am all right. I am all right.

71
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:26,675
Should I bring something
from outside?

72
00:58:28,352 --> 00:58:29,410
Yes.

73
00:58:30,087 --> 00:58:31,520
From outside...

74
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:34,023
...you bring for me the medicine
to become young.

75
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:36,182
I want to become young.

76
00:58:38,095 --> 00:58:41,553
Bring a bit of years
for me from outside.

77
00:58:44,535 --> 00:58:46,025
No reaction.

78
00:58:47,638 --> 00:58:49,367
Everything is all right, isn't it?

79
00:58:52,376 --> 00:58:54,037
I have told Jiya...

80
00:58:54,111 --> 00:58:57,046
...that I am about to be engaged.

81
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:00,378
That's good.

82
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:03,652
So you have understood
this in the end...

83
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:07,054
...that life isn't any
book or any film...

84
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:10,387
...which we can make
or break anytime.

85
00:59:11,228 --> 00:59:13,059
Actually, our life...

86
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,394
Even though it is ours,
it isn't ours.

87
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:18,067
It walks according to someone...

88
00:59:18,135 --> 00:59:20,399
...else's whims till
the time that we die.

89
00:59:21,138 --> 00:59:23,402
Come on, whatever you did was good.

90
00:59:23,474 --> 00:59:25,465
In fact, whatever you say...

91
00:59:25,743 --> 00:59:27,802
She is a dancer after
all, isn't she?

92
00:59:28,145 --> 00:59:29,407
A bar dancer...

93
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,677
John uncle, if you say another
word about Jiya it won't be good.

94
00:59:34,585 --> 00:59:37,076
I haven't got another girl
like Jiya till today.

95
00:59:38,155 --> 00:59:39,747
What has happened to you?

96
00:59:41,592 --> 00:59:43,082
Even you have...

97
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,287
...started to speak like
daddy and grandma.

98
00:59:46,597 --> 00:59:48,087
I don't believe this.

99
00:59:49,266 --> 00:59:51,257
Hey! At least listen,
please listen.

100
00:59:57,174 --> 00:59:59,267
Daksh, what will you do now?

101
01:00:31,642 --> 01:00:33,132
Hello, Mr. Madhwani.

102
01:00:45,656 --> 01:00:47,556
Good evening, Mr. Mittal.

103
01:00:48,225 --> 01:00:50,659
Bless me, Father Bhisma.

104
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:53,762
Anahita, see who has come.

105
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:56,331
Your to be husband has arrived.

106
01:00:57,234 --> 01:00:59,168
Come on down quickly or else...

107
01:00:59,236 --> 01:01:02,899
...I will cancel this marriage.
I will call it off.

108
01:01:04,241 --> 01:01:06,505
Anahita was waiting for you.

109
01:01:06,577 --> 01:01:08,568
She has gone to change her clothes.

110
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:09,839
Till that time...

111
01:01:09,913 --> 01:01:11,847
...would you like to wait in
the living room for her?

112
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:14,678
Obviously, I can't wait
in the bathroom, can I?

113
01:01:26,864 --> 01:01:28,195
Thank you.

114
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:30,358
Father.

115
01:01:31,802 --> 01:01:34,202
I become very nervous thinking...

116
01:01:34,271 --> 01:01:36,364
...about this marriage
and this engagement.

117
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,270
I get very scared.

118
01:01:40,277 --> 01:01:41,801
I don't know what happens to me.

119
01:01:42,713 --> 01:01:44,544
Please tell me what I should do.

120
01:01:44,715 --> 01:01:46,376
You know what I am talking about?

121
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:47,747
Hello, Daksh.

122
01:01:49,286 --> 01:01:50,548
Mr. Madhwani.

123
01:01:51,288 --> 01:01:52,721
You are here?

124
01:01:52,956 --> 01:01:55,948
I was searching for you all around.
You... - What were you saying?

125
01:01:57,294 --> 01:01:58,556
What was I saying, father?

126
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:01,890
I was telling something to you.
- You go.

127
01:02:08,572 --> 01:02:11,405
Daksh. Not you.

128
01:02:13,977 --> 01:02:15,239
You are here too?

129
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,241
That too, just half?

130
01:02:18,315 --> 01:02:20,306
Where is your backside?

131
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:22,910
Do you remember what I was saying?

132
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:25,921
Do you know why nobody
drinks in our family?

133
01:02:28,325 --> 01:02:30,759
Because after drinking...

134
01:02:30,928 --> 01:02:32,919
...a man doesn't have sense...

135
01:02:32,996 --> 01:02:36,591
...as to what he is saying,
why is he saying...

136
01:02:36,767 --> 01:02:38,598
...and to whom is he saying...

137
01:02:38,669 --> 01:02:40,330
...and what he is doing.

138
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:46,435
A drunkard is always confused.

139
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:49,274
He cannot decide as
to what he wants.

140
01:02:49,613 --> 01:02:51,444
Actually, you are right, sir.

141
01:02:51,515 --> 01:02:54,450
Even I am confused a it
about this marriage.

142
01:02:54,518 --> 01:02:55,780
Yes.

143
01:02:56,353 --> 01:02:58,446
I think that the time has come...

144
01:02:58,522 --> 01:03:03,789
...that the two of us should
know each other now.

145
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:07,455
Daksh...

146
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:13,300
I wasn't born in a rich
household like you.

147
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:16,806
I earned everything with
these two hands of mine.

148
01:03:16,874 --> 01:03:18,466
I achieved everything.

149
01:03:19,376 --> 01:03:23,642
At the age of eighteen,
I was a millionaire.

150
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:29,647
At the age of fifteen,
I had a killed...

151
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:32,648
...a man with the bullets
of this gun.

152
01:03:33,824 --> 01:03:35,314
Do you know why?

153
01:03:36,393 --> 01:03:39,829
Because he had barged
into my house...

154
01:03:39,897 --> 01:03:42,832
...to steal my hard earned money.

155
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:46,335
I remember the day even today.

156
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:48,334
As soon as the man started...

157
01:03:48,405 --> 01:03:50,339
...running with the money
from my cupboard...

158
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:51,840
I... bang bang.

159
01:03:53,544 --> 01:03:55,512
I put two bullets into him.

160
01:03:56,513 --> 01:03:58,344
And that thief.

161
01:03:58,415 --> 01:04:01,509
He fell down on the carpet
of my living room and died.

162
01:04:02,419 --> 01:04:03,681
Shameless.

163
01:04:03,754 --> 01:04:05,346
First of all he came
to steal and then...

164
01:04:06,423 --> 01:04:07,685
...he dirtied your carpet? Very bad.

165
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:12,693
You think that every thing
I say I is a joke?

166
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:19,593
Daksh...

167
01:04:22,706 --> 01:04:26,540
Do you know what the most priceless
thing in my life is?

168
01:04:27,978 --> 01:04:29,377
What, sir?

169
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:32,538
My daughter, Anahita.

170
01:04:32,616 --> 01:04:33,708
Yes.

171
01:04:34,451 --> 01:04:36,544
She is my Kohinoor diamond.

172
01:04:40,457 --> 01:04:41,549
Daksh...

173
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,891
I am a very bad man.

174
01:04:46,597 --> 01:04:48,895
Anahita loves you very much.

175
01:04:50,467 --> 01:04:51,900
And I wish that...

176
01:04:52,736 --> 01:04:54,727
...that you keep her happy.

177
01:04:55,072 --> 01:04:57,905
You give her every happiness
of the world.

178
01:04:59,476 --> 01:05:00,807
I will try.

179
01:05:00,877 --> 01:05:04,074
No tries! You will keep her happy.

180
01:05:04,481 --> 01:05:09,077
Till the time I am happy,
I am happy, understood?

181
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:10,746
And yes...

182
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:13,585
You will have to stop drinking.

183
01:05:16,493 --> 01:05:19,587
What about alcohol, I am
ready to leave this life.

184
01:05:20,764 --> 01:05:21,924
Hi!

185
01:05:26,236 --> 01:05:27,931
Shall we go?
- Yes.

186
01:05:30,507 --> 01:05:32,771
Goodbye dad!
- Bye bye, child.

187
01:05:37,781 --> 01:05:39,612
Waiter!

188
01:05:40,517 --> 01:05:42,007
Waiter, come here.

189
01:05:42,085 --> 01:05:43,643
Come here. Come here.

190
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:46,680
Yes, sir.

191
01:05:47,524 --> 01:05:50,459
My doctor has said that
if I want to be alive...

192
01:05:50,527 --> 01:05:53,963
...l'd have to drink at least
10 scotch whiskies in 1 hour.

193
01:05:54,531 --> 01:05:56,624
If you want me to be alive...

194
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,464
...then bring 1 large
scotch whisky for me.

195
01:05:59,536 --> 01:06:01,060
Ok, sir.
- Go.

196
01:06:02,806 --> 01:06:05,138
Well everyone, mind your
own business please.

197
01:06:09,146 --> 01:06:10,477
Calm down.

198
01:06:11,815 --> 01:06:14,215
Calm down. What's wrong?

199
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,686
Who's missing you, when I am here?

200
01:06:37,674 --> 01:06:38,834
This ring...

201
01:06:40,577 --> 01:06:43,239
...was gifted by my grandfather
to my grandma.

202
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:46,014
Ooh... Wow!

203
01:06:46,316 --> 01:06:47,510
Both are dead.

204
01:06:51,588 --> 01:06:53,681
Today I am giving this ring to you.

205
01:06:55,926 --> 01:06:57,689
Please keep it carefully with you.

206
01:06:59,596 --> 01:07:01,188
I don't know what will happen to me?

207
01:07:01,598 --> 01:07:02,860
Oh Daksh!

208
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:07,866
Daksh, I was waiting
for this since ages.

209
01:07:09,606 --> 01:07:11,267
I still can't believe this.

210
01:07:12,609 --> 01:07:14,702
You are giving this ring to me.

211
01:07:16,613 --> 01:07:21,710
I can't believe that we are
going to get married soon.

212
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:28,285
I don't believe that very soon,
we are going to have kids.

213
01:07:34,965 --> 01:07:36,159
Are you ok?

214
01:07:37,234 --> 01:07:39,225
I think you wanna
puke? Puke, right?

215
01:07:39,369 --> 01:07:41,564
Go. Go from here.

216
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:44,072
Just get out from here.

217
01:07:44,241 --> 01:07:45,299
Go away. Go away.

218
01:07:46,643 --> 01:07:48,076
Go to the loo.

219
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:50,577
Oh God!

220
01:08:39,696 --> 01:08:42,961
Jiya, I am back.

221
01:09:01,718 --> 01:09:03,845
Jiya open the door.

222
01:09:06,723 --> 01:09:08,987
Jiya, open the door.

223
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:11,987
Jiya, open the door.

224
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,388
Hi, Jiya.

225
01:09:45,195 --> 01:09:46,253
Sorry.

226
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:55,770
You were missing me, right?

227
01:10:02,112 --> 01:10:04,046
I was missing you too.

228
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:11,979
Sorry.

229
01:10:15,225 --> 01:10:16,317
Leave it.

230
01:10:16,793 --> 01:10:19,887
You are so drunk, that you
can't even stand properly.

231
01:10:20,063 --> 01:10:21,394
Why have you come here?

232
01:10:21,464 --> 01:10:23,398
Go to her, whom you are marrying?

233
01:10:29,806 --> 01:10:31,740
Go and let me sleep.

234
01:10:31,808 --> 01:10:33,742
I have work tomorrow.

235
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,012
Bye.

236
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:49,251
You had come so late at night
just to say good bye.

237
01:10:54,097 --> 01:10:55,155
Answer me.

238
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,831
Actually I had come
To give you this.

239
01:11:07,577 --> 01:11:08,771
Take it.

240
01:11:19,856 --> 01:11:21,517
A cheque for 5 crores.

241
01:11:24,127 --> 01:11:25,856
This is for you from me.

242
01:11:26,963 --> 01:11:30,126
No, you don't have to
dance and earn money.

243
01:11:31,301 --> 01:11:34,293
You can buy a bungalow with this.

244
01:11:34,871 --> 01:11:36,304
You can buy a car.

245
01:11:37,307 --> 01:11:39,332
Money really means big.

246
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:41,802
What?!

247
01:11:42,879 --> 01:11:45,211
So what if am getting
married somewhere else?

248
01:11:45,982 --> 01:11:47,973
I love only you.

249
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:50,980
We will stay together.

250
01:11:51,154 --> 01:11:53,213
We will be happy forever.

251
01:11:54,157 --> 01:11:55,317
What?!

252
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:01,153
You'll marry someone else
and I'll stay with you?

253
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,835
I thought you were my
prince charming...

254
01:12:08,571 --> 01:12:11,165
...whom I was waiting
since my whole life.

255
01:12:16,913 --> 01:12:19,177
What do you want to
prove by giving this?

256
01:12:20,517 --> 01:12:26,012
Jiya, keep it. You
need this... please.

257
01:12:27,357 --> 01:12:31,521
I despise myself... that I loved you.

258
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:36,021
Those people are much
better than you?

259
01:12:36,266 --> 01:12:38,928
At least they take out the money...

260
01:12:39,002 --> 01:12:42,028
...and ask, what's your price?

261
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,073
At least they don't pretend love.

262
01:12:59,956 --> 01:13:01,287
Jiya, please listen to me.

263
01:13:01,357 --> 01:13:03,325
I will dance in the
bar my whole life.

264
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,053
But I'll never become your mistress.

265
01:13:06,129 --> 01:13:08,893
I'll never become your mistress.

266
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:10,563
Did you get me?

267
01:13:11,968 --> 01:13:13,959
Jiya, please listen...
- Get lost from here!

268
01:13:14,304 --> 01:13:16,238
Jiya, I am sorry...
- Get lost from here!

269
01:13:16,406 --> 01:13:17,896
Just get out!

270
01:13:18,074 --> 01:13:19,632
Jiya, listen...
- Get lost from here!

271
01:13:19,976 --> 01:13:21,068
Just get out!

272
01:13:21,711 --> 01:13:24,111
Please listen to me! - Just get out!

273
01:13:26,249 --> 01:13:27,307
Get out!

274
01:13:28,251 --> 01:13:30,242
Jiya, please listen to me.

275
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,081
Jiya, please listen to me.

276
01:13:32,155 --> 01:13:33,588
Jiya, I am sorry.

277
01:13:34,257 --> 01:13:35,315
I am sorry, Jiya.

278
01:13:37,994 --> 01:13:39,325
I am sorry.

279
01:13:42,432 --> 01:13:44,263
Jiya, I am sorry.

280
01:14:33,713 --> 01:14:35,704
Sir, we couldn't find
Daksh anywhere?

281
01:14:35,781 --> 01:14:37,373
You couldn't find him?
- Yes, sir.

282
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,077
Not anywhere?
- No, sir.

283
01:14:39,452 --> 01:14:42,046
Not even that wretched Anahita
know where he is?

284
01:14:42,121 --> 01:14:44,646
No, sir. I have rifled
through all the bars.

285
01:14:44,724 --> 01:14:45,986
We couldn't find him anywhere.

286
01:14:46,058 --> 01:14:47,650
I had told you not
to leave him alone.

287
01:14:47,727 --> 01:14:50,321
Now, it's so late in the night
and he's not to be found.

288
01:14:50,396 --> 01:14:52,728
Sir, we made a mistake.
What shouldn't we do now?

289
01:14:52,798 --> 01:14:54,163
To hell with you!

290
01:14:57,737 --> 01:15:00,171
He won't even let me die peacefully
in the hospital.

291
01:15:01,073 --> 01:15:02,665
Tomorrow... is his engagement...

292
01:15:03,342 --> 01:15:05,003
And who knows where the heck he is?

293
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,874
'She's annoyed with me.'

294
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:47,110
'I am annoyed with her.'

295
01:15:47,386 --> 01:15:50,878
'She's annoyed with me.'

296
01:15:50,956 --> 01:15:54,221
'I am annoyed with her.'

297
01:15:54,794 --> 01:16:01,063
'But it feels like I
should talk to her.'

298
01:16:01,233 --> 01:16:08,071
'Her style is different
from this world.'

299
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:15,078
'I feel like giving up
my life for her style.'

300
01:16:15,147 --> 01:16:18,241
'She's annoyed with me.'

301
01:16:18,417 --> 01:16:22,353
'I am annoyed with her.'

302
01:16:53,586 --> 01:17:00,185
'How can I say to him what
my feelings are for him? '

303
01:17:00,526 --> 01:17:07,125
'I can't even live without
telling him that.'

304
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:20,978
'How can I say to him what
my feelings are for him? '

305
01:17:21,147 --> 01:17:27,985
'I can't even live without
telling him that.'

306
01:17:28,154 --> 01:17:35,151
'I can't even live without
telling him that.'

307
01:17:35,427 --> 01:17:42,162
'I swear on love that in love...

308
01:17:42,234 --> 01:17:49,163
...I wish to cross all limits.'

309
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:52,833
'She's annoyed with me.'

310
01:17:53,012 --> 01:17:56,175
'I am annoyed with her.'

311
01:17:56,248 --> 01:18:03,017
'But it feels like I
should talk to her.'

312
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:06,852
'He's annoyed with me.'

313
01:18:06,926 --> 01:18:10,191
'I am annoyed with him.'

314
01:18:10,262 --> 01:18:12,196
I'll call back afterwards.

315
01:18:12,264 --> 01:18:14,357
Just a minute. You wait here.

316
01:18:14,433 --> 01:18:17,869
This is a bar and not
a government office.

317
01:18:18,938 --> 01:18:20,269
Get out from here.

318
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:23,033
We won't get along now.

319
01:18:41,627 --> 01:18:48,055
'My heartfelt prayers
are of help now.'

320
01:18:48,234 --> 01:18:55,231
'I get relief for at least a while.'

321
01:19:02,147 --> 01:19:09,246
'My heartfelt prayers
are of help now.'

322
01:19:09,455 --> 01:19:15,917
'I get relief for at least a while.'

323
01:19:16,328 --> 01:19:23,097
'I get relief for at least a while.'

324
01:19:23,168 --> 01:19:30,267
'Ln the beautiful arms of my lover...

325
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:37,111
...I feel like crying my heart out.'

326
01:19:37,182 --> 01:19:40,948
'He's annoyed with me.'

327
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:44,285
'I am annoyed with him.'

328
01:19:44,356 --> 01:19:51,125
'But it feels like I
should talk to her.'

329
01:19:51,297 --> 01:19:58,135
'Her style is different
from this world.'

330
01:19:58,304 --> 01:20:05,142
'I feel like giving up
my life for her style.'

331
01:20:05,311 --> 01:20:08,542
'He's annoyed with me.'

332
01:20:08,614 --> 01:20:13,984
'I am annoyed with him.'

333
01:20:19,058 --> 01:20:21,151
Today, I'll tell you
the naked truth.

334
01:20:22,061 --> 01:20:24,393
There are two types of
woman in this world.

335
01:20:24,496 --> 01:20:26,987
One. She wears the nuptial thread.

336
01:20:27,066 --> 01:20:28,556
She adorns her head
part with vermilion...

337
01:20:28,634 --> 01:20:30,158
...and she sleeps only with one man.

338
01:20:30,235 --> 01:20:32,169
Only one man uses her.

339
01:20:32,237 --> 01:20:33,499
She makes her conceive kids.

340
01:20:33,672 --> 01:20:35,196
What does she get in return?

341
01:20:35,274 --> 01:20:38,607
Money, food and house... right?

342
01:20:39,178 --> 01:20:41,339
And second type is like me...

343
01:20:42,081 --> 01:20:44,515
...who earns money herself...

344
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,676
. and takes care of all
her needs herself.

345
01:20:47,186 --> 01:20:49,552
And you have the third
way before you.

346
01:20:49,822 --> 01:20:52,188
And I think that's better
than the rest.

347
01:20:53,192 --> 01:20:56,753
You will get money...
house and freedom.

348
01:20:57,096 --> 01:20:59,189
And above that you get
the one who loves you.

349
01:20:59,264 --> 01:21:01,027
What more do you want?

350
01:21:01,533 --> 01:21:03,558
Wife or mistress.

351
01:21:04,536 --> 01:21:06,697
The difference is just a word.

352
01:21:08,107 --> 01:21:10,769
Sometimes, you have to think
of your own happiness too.

353
01:21:11,543 --> 01:21:13,204
Don't think too much.

354
01:21:13,278 --> 01:21:15,041
Become his mistress.

355
01:21:49,415 --> 01:21:51,576
I don't know, why
am I living at all?

356
01:21:53,585 --> 01:21:56,577
I am a failure in life.

357
01:22:01,493 --> 01:22:03,085
No one loves me.

358
01:22:05,164 --> 01:22:06,597
What did you say?

359
01:22:07,266 --> 01:22:08,756
No one loves me.

360
01:22:09,168 --> 01:22:11,432
No one loves you... huh?
No one loves you... huh?

361
01:22:11,637 --> 01:22:14,162
You are the spoilt child
of a rich father.

362
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,173
Your mother had died when
you were very small.

363
01:22:16,241 --> 01:22:18,175
If I had brought you
up using the rod...

364
01:22:18,243 --> 01:22:20,643
...I wouldn't have had to see
your sorrowful pretense.

365
01:22:22,181 --> 01:22:25,116
Do you know, you are among
the lucky persons...

366
01:22:25,184 --> 01:22:27,118
...in the world who have everything.

367
01:22:27,186 --> 01:22:28,744
But even though you
have everything...

368
01:22:28,821 --> 01:22:30,288
...it's not enough for you.

369
01:22:31,457 --> 01:22:34,620
Today, you are feeling
that no one loves you.

370
01:22:34,693 --> 01:22:36,285
Do you know why?

371
01:22:36,462 --> 01:22:39,522
Because today for the first
time you have known life.

372
01:22:40,732 --> 01:22:42,632
Mr. Daksh Mittal...

373
01:22:42,801 --> 01:22:45,463
Do you know there are many
people in the world...

374
01:22:45,637 --> 01:22:48,868
...who have never seen
love in their lives.

375
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:51,472
They die without loving
anyone or getting love.

376
01:22:54,213 --> 01:22:56,147
Go and take a bath.

377
01:22:56,215 --> 01:22:58,649
You still stink of liquor. Go.

378
01:23:05,491 --> 01:23:06,685
One more thing.

379
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:12,161
Henceforth, if you say
that no one loves...

380
01:23:12,231 --> 01:23:14,324
...l'll not slap you but I'll
punch you right in the face!

381
01:23:15,234 --> 01:23:17,168
Because I love you very much.

382
01:23:24,243 --> 01:23:25,676
I am sorry.

383
01:23:32,985 --> 01:23:34,850
Son, marry Anahita.

384
01:23:36,688 --> 01:23:39,350
It's very difficult
to live a poor life.

385
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:43,592
But I want to marry Jiya.

386
01:23:46,532 --> 01:23:49,365
It's better if you grow up,
while I am still alive.

387
01:23:50,269 --> 01:23:52,863
What will happen to you,
if I am not around?

388
01:24:00,279 --> 01:24:01,610
Out of question.

389
01:24:01,713 --> 01:24:04,375
You can't move out from your bed.

390
01:24:04,716 --> 01:24:07,549
Then it's out of question that
you get out of this hospital!

391
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:09,382
Doctor, I must go.

392
01:24:09,454 --> 01:24:11,422
Or else it will mean
trouble... please.

393
01:24:11,557 --> 01:24:16,392
See this. 1,50,000 are just
a normal platelet count.

394
01:24:17,029 --> 01:24:19,623
Your count has reduced to 20,000!

395
01:24:20,299 --> 01:24:22,961
No, I am sorry. I can't
give you the permission.

396
01:24:23,302 --> 01:24:24,894
Doctor, it's just a question
of half an hour.

397
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:26,232
I'll be back in an instant.

398
01:24:27,406 --> 01:24:29,397
Ok, Mr. John D'costa.

399
01:24:29,841 --> 01:24:31,900
Please sign this undertaking.

400
01:24:32,311 --> 01:24:34,404
I will not be responsible
for anything.

401
01:24:35,314 --> 01:24:38,408
Why are you hell-bent
on committing suicide?!

402
01:24:39,451 --> 01:24:44,252
Doctor, life is just like
that unfaithful wife...

403
01:24:44,423 --> 01:24:47,415
...who leaves her husband
stranded in bad times.

404
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:50,420
Why should I cry over such a life?

405
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:52,661
I'll sign it.

406
01:24:57,603 --> 01:24:58,763
Yes, please may I know
what do you want?

407
01:24:58,837 --> 01:25:00,464
I am Uncle John of Daksh.

408
01:25:00,606 --> 01:25:03,439
He must have told you about me.
- Yes, please come in.

409
01:25:04,776 --> 01:25:05,834
Thank you!

410
01:25:09,348 --> 01:25:10,440
Come in.

411
01:25:11,783 --> 01:25:12,875
Please come in.

412
01:25:17,789 --> 01:25:18,949
Please have seat.

413
01:25:26,365 --> 01:25:28,697
I have come to tell you that...

414
01:25:28,767 --> 01:25:30,792
...tomorrow night... Daksh's
wedding will take place...

415
01:25:30,869 --> 01:25:32,461
...in his father's house.

416
01:25:32,704 --> 01:25:33,796
In Mittal house.

417
01:25:34,373 --> 01:25:38,707
And I think that you must go there.

418
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:44,815
Have you invited all the
girlfriends of Daksh?

419
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,656
Daksh is not a commodity kept
in a departmental store...

420
01:25:52,824 --> 01:25:54,655
...that you can steal so easily.

421
01:25:55,661 --> 01:25:57,652
You have to win him over.

422
01:25:59,998 --> 01:26:02,831
But, how can I go on his engagement?

423
01:26:04,503 --> 01:26:10,066
Listen Jiya, I know him very well.

424
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:13,501
He needs you.

425
01:26:14,413 --> 01:26:16,540
He loves you very much.

426
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:19,509
Listen to me. You must
go to the party.

427
01:26:20,419 --> 01:26:25,755
Destiny always plays such
strange games with lovers.

428
01:26:27,526 --> 01:26:31,519
Your love story can take
a new twist any moment.

429
01:26:37,102 --> 01:26:40,538
Are you all right?
- I am fine. - Please sit down.

430
01:26:40,605 --> 01:26:43,039
Sit down. I will bring
water for you.

431
01:26:51,883 --> 01:26:53,544
I hope you are all right?

432
01:26:53,719 --> 01:26:54,947
Yes, I am fine. I am fine.

433
01:26:58,457 --> 01:27:02,587
Does Daksh know that you have
come to say this to me?

434
01:27:05,897 --> 01:27:07,558
He's a poor kid.

435
01:27:08,567 --> 01:27:10,728
If he had this much sense...

436
01:27:10,802 --> 01:27:13,396
...then this problem would
never have arisen.

437
01:27:15,474 --> 01:27:17,738
You really love Daksh very much.

438
01:27:17,909 --> 01:27:19,740
Just like a mother.

439
01:27:20,912 --> 01:27:22,607
This is my job.

440
01:27:23,815 --> 01:27:26,579
And I love doing this job.

441
01:27:27,486 --> 01:27:30,614
In fact I would suggest you
to do this job after me.

442
01:27:30,922 --> 01:27:34,085
And I guarantee you 100
0/0 job satisfaction.

443
01:27:34,493 --> 01:27:36,586
After you!? Where are you going?

444
01:27:39,498 --> 01:27:41,432
I have brought something for you.

445
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,934
But you must open it
only after I leave.

446
01:27:44,503 --> 01:27:46,971
What's in it?
- Open it only after I leave.

447
01:27:48,106 --> 01:27:52,099
John uncle, why don't
you consult a doctor?

448
01:27:52,244 --> 01:27:54,712
I am going straight to a doctor.

449
01:28:02,621 --> 01:28:03,781
Can I kiss you?

450
01:28:07,526 --> 01:28:08,959
You don't have to ask me.

451
01:28:14,866 --> 01:28:17,130
Can I also kiss you?
- Yes.

452
01:28:27,546 --> 01:28:28,979
God bless you.

453
01:29:29,608 --> 01:29:34,045
'Let this smoke be as it is.'

454
01:29:34,112 --> 01:29:38,549
'Let me tell you my feelings.'

455
01:29:38,617 --> 01:29:44,214
'I am crazy for your love.'

456
01:29:44,623 --> 01:29:49,060
'Let me burn in love.'

457
01:29:49,227 --> 01:29:53,561
'Let this smoke be as it is.'

458
01:29:53,632 --> 01:29:57,625
'Let me tell you my feelings.'

459
01:29:57,702 --> 01:30:02,901
'I am crazy for your love.'

460
01:30:03,642 --> 01:30:08,238
'Let me burn in love.'

461
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:12,976
'Let this smoke be as it is.'

462
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:03,634
'Your glance has touched my heart.'

463
01:31:03,702 --> 01:31:08,036
'I am entranced by your love.'

464
01:31:08,139 --> 01:31:16,706
'Burning in love gives a
strange satisfaction.'

465
01:31:16,781 --> 01:31:20,979
'Hold me in your arms.'

466
01:31:21,052 --> 01:31:25,182
'Come close... come close to me.'

467
01:31:25,256 --> 01:31:30,660
'Come close to me.'

468
01:31:33,732 --> 01:31:38,669
'Let this smoke be as it is.'

469
01:31:38,737 --> 01:31:42,833
'Let me tell you my feelings.'

470
01:31:42,907 --> 01:31:47,901
'I am crazy for your love.'

471
01:31:48,747 --> 01:31:53,184
'Let me burn in love.'

472
01:31:53,485 --> 01:31:58,184
'Let this smoke be as it is.'

473
01:32:00,425 --> 01:32:02,017
Can't you see what's going on?

474
01:32:02,093 --> 01:32:05,085
Do something of this scene.
Please do something.

475
01:32:05,363 --> 01:32:09,094
Is this the same girl about
whom Daksh mentioned to me?

476
01:32:09,167 --> 01:32:10,862
Yes, she's the same girl.

477
01:32:11,870 --> 01:32:13,360
Her name is Jiya.

478
01:32:13,505 --> 01:32:16,440
She dances in a beer bar.

479
01:32:19,778 --> 01:32:21,871
Just a few days back,
your grandson...

480
01:32:21,946 --> 01:32:28,044
...left my daughter and was roaming
with this lowly girl...

481
01:32:28,119 --> 01:32:29,882
...on the streets.

482
01:32:31,389 --> 01:32:34,449
Let them roam. Let them roam
as long as they want.

483
01:32:34,526 --> 01:32:38,257
My son is of young blood.
He'll roam before marriage.

484
01:32:40,532 --> 01:32:42,898
But, you have become old...

485
01:32:42,967 --> 01:32:45,231
...still you are on that
old beaten path again.

486
01:32:46,304 --> 01:32:51,901
Forgot your affair... with your maid.

487
01:32:55,814 --> 01:32:56,940
So funny.

488
01:32:57,248 --> 01:33:01,742
'This heat. This softness.'

489
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:06,257
'What can I say about this thirst? '

490
01:33:06,324 --> 01:33:14,424
'I am always lost in
your love's trance.'

491
01:33:14,499 --> 01:33:18,936
'This is the blistering
ashes of our passion.'

492
01:33:19,003 --> 01:33:22,939
'Let me become dust again.'

493
01:33:23,007 --> 01:33:29,276
'O my beloved.'

494
01:33:31,583 --> 01:33:36,282
'Let this smoke be as it is.'

495
01:33:36,354 --> 01:33:40,518
'Let me tell you my feelings.'

496
01:33:40,592 --> 01:33:45,962
'I am crazy for your love.'

497
01:33:46,197 --> 01:33:51,134
'Let me burn in love.'

498
01:33:51,302 --> 01:33:55,966
'Let this smoke be as it is.'

499
01:34:43,388 --> 01:34:45,015
If you say, I will have
her thrown out from here.

500
01:34:46,124 --> 01:34:47,455
Take it easy! You want
to show your strength...

501
01:34:47,525 --> 01:34:48,856
...against a menial girl.

502
01:34:49,527 --> 01:34:51,859
Go and announce the engagement.

503
01:34:52,197 --> 01:34:53,858
She will run away on her own.

504
01:35:00,605 --> 01:35:01,867
C'mon.

505
01:35:04,409 --> 01:35:06,468
I thought you'd elope with me.

506
01:35:11,216 --> 01:35:15,050
Are you really getting
engaged to Anahita?

507
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:27,398
Your silence has given me my answer.

508
01:35:31,302 --> 01:35:32,894
Believe me Jiya, I am helpless.

509
01:35:34,706 --> 01:35:36,901
Or else, I'll lose
100 million dollars.

510
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:42,070
Do you know how much
100 million dollars is?

511
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:43,511
No, Daksh.

512
01:35:44,582 --> 01:35:47,642
I don't have the money even
to go back home by a cab.

513
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:49,911
How do I know how much it is?

514
01:35:50,521 --> 01:35:51,920
It's a huge amount!

515
01:35:53,091 --> 01:35:55,082
That I had come to your house
to make you understand this.

516
01:35:55,526 --> 01:35:57,255
But you got annoyed with me.

517
01:36:00,131 --> 01:36:02,599
I just want you to consider
my offer... please.

518
01:36:03,201 --> 01:36:04,930
Daksh, I have come here for that.

519
01:36:07,272 --> 01:36:08,933
The girl inside me said...

520
01:36:11,276 --> 01:36:12,937
...what tantrums are
you throwing, Jiya?

521
01:36:15,346 --> 01:36:17,280
Get out from the world
of dolls and fairies.

522
01:36:19,117 --> 01:36:20,948
Become his mistress.

523
01:36:21,486 --> 01:36:23,954
You can't run this
world as you wish.

524
01:36:25,356 --> 01:36:28,450
Sometimes to win something you
have to lose everything.

525
01:36:30,361 --> 01:36:33,455
But when I came here, when
I saw you before me...

526
01:36:36,301 --> 01:36:38,565
...one more girl inside
me called out...

527
01:36:41,306 --> 01:36:43,137
...the one who still believes
in her dreams.

528
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:45,967
She said to me.

529
01:36:47,378 --> 01:36:52,509
Jiya, if dreams are lost...
then everything is lost.

530
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,585
Daksh, just like you can't
leave you dollars for me...

531
01:37:00,591 --> 01:37:03,151
...in the same way, I can't
leave my dreams for you.

532
01:37:09,267 --> 01:37:10,996
My dreams will be fulfilled.

533
01:37:16,541 --> 01:37:19,169
Daksh! C'mon, let's go.

534
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:23,010
I said... C'mon, Daksh.

535
01:37:23,181 --> 01:37:25,012
Daksh, C'mon.

536
01:37:27,185 --> 01:37:28,516
C'mon.

537
01:37:28,619 --> 01:37:30,018
Grandma is waiting for you.

538
01:37:33,191 --> 01:37:34,351
Ladies and gentleman.

539
01:37:34,425 --> 01:37:38,191
I'd like my mother to
start this ceremony...

540
01:37:38,262 --> 01:37:41,197
...with her pure and sacred hands...

541
01:37:41,265 --> 01:37:45,759
...which will bind these
hearts forever.

542
01:37:47,372 --> 01:37:52,036
And along with this, two
influential business families...

543
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:54,203
...of this city will
become one forever.

544
01:37:54,379 --> 01:37:56,643
Wow! That's great!

545
01:38:02,787 --> 01:38:04,049
Slip this on her fingers.

546
01:38:07,225 --> 01:38:09,386
Wow! That's wonderful.

547
01:38:29,247 --> 01:38:31,078
May God bless you!

548
01:38:33,484 --> 01:38:36,476
Sir, please excuse me.
Just a minute.

549
01:38:37,255 --> 01:38:39,086
Didn't I tell you that the
girl would run away?

550
01:38:40,491 --> 01:38:42,755
What happened?
- Sir, come fast.

551
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:45,627
John uncle's health
is deteriorating.

552
01:38:45,696 --> 01:38:48,096
What happened to him?
- I don't know. - Let's go.

553
01:38:49,434 --> 01:38:53,495
Mr. Daksh Mittal, your butler
has acute leukemia.

554
01:38:58,776 --> 01:39:00,107
Acute Leukemia!

555
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:09,109
Cancer!

556
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,454
Yes. He had been coming
here for treatment...

557
01:39:11,522 --> 01:39:13,456
...since the last six months.

558
01:39:15,193 --> 01:39:17,286
It's strange that he never
told you about it.

559
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:23,133
I hope he becomes all right?

560
01:39:23,634 --> 01:39:26,660
Mr. Mittal, your butler was
careless from the beginning.

561
01:39:27,738 --> 01:39:29,296
We tried our best.

562
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:31,469
He never took care of himself...

563
01:39:31,542 --> 01:39:33,737
...and neither did he take
his medicines on time.

564
01:39:35,213 --> 01:39:36,646
Even though, we limited
your butler from...

565
01:39:36,714 --> 01:39:38,147
Stop this butler nonsense!

566
01:39:38,316 --> 01:39:40,147
He's not my butler. He's my father.

567
01:39:53,664 --> 01:39:55,154
He's my father.

568
01:39:58,569 --> 01:40:01,663
Oh, I am really very sorry,
Mr. Mittal.

569
01:40:02,507 --> 01:40:04,168
I am extremely sorry.
- It's ok.

570
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:09,344
But now he has a new firmness.

571
01:40:10,581 --> 01:40:13,175
He wants to go the church everyday
for Christmas prayers.

572
01:40:14,986 --> 01:40:17,181
Mr. Mittal, I won't
take any guarantee...

573
01:40:17,255 --> 01:40:19,519
...if anything happens to him, now.

574
01:40:28,366 --> 01:40:30,596
So, will you take the guarantee...

575
01:40:30,701 --> 01:40:32,191
...that nothing would happen
to him if he stays here.

576
01:40:39,610 --> 01:40:41,544
Then, why are you stopping him?

577
01:40:45,383 --> 01:40:47,214
Does it make a difference if he
stays here or in the church?

578
01:40:50,388 --> 01:41:04,826
Silent night. Holy night.
All is calm. All is bright

579
01:41:05,403 --> 01:41:12,241
All around the
virgin mother and child.

580
01:41:13,511 --> 01:41:15,570
Holy infant...

581
01:41:15,746 --> 01:41:18,306
I think my life's
circle is complete.

582
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:20,646
...mother and child.

583
01:41:21,419 --> 01:41:24,411
Remember, I used to take
you out on a pram.

584
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:31,251
Now you have brought me to this
church on a wheelchair.

585
01:41:35,433 --> 01:41:38,925
Daksh, death is not that
frightening as people think.

586
01:41:40,438 --> 01:41:41,666
People fear it for nothing.

587
01:41:41,806 --> 01:41:44,434
'Holy night... '

588
01:41:44,775 --> 01:41:47,266
If humans don't die...

589
01:41:49,447 --> 01:41:51,278
...then how will life live on?

590
01:41:51,449 --> 01:41:56,546
'Round the virgin mother and child.'

591
01:41:56,621 --> 01:41:59,283
Do you know I am feeling
very peaceful in here?

592
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:03,291
I never felt like this before
in my whole life.

593
01:42:04,695 --> 01:42:07,630
Even if I gulped down a
whole bottle of liquor.

594
01:42:07,698 --> 01:42:10,292
'Sleep in heavenly peace.'

595
01:42:10,501 --> 01:42:13,698
'Sleep in heavenly peace.'

596
01:42:13,804 --> 01:42:20,471
How... is Jiya? ...the tie thief.

597
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:23,310
Why are you talking about her?

598
01:42:23,848 --> 01:42:25,315
Don't know why...

599
01:42:25,383 --> 01:42:27,476
...but her thought are
revolving in my mind.

600
01:42:27,652 --> 01:42:29,313
'Silent night... '

601
01:42:30,388 --> 01:42:32,322
You know people say that...

602
01:42:32,556 --> 01:42:35,491
...when a person is about to die...

603
01:42:35,559 --> 01:42:37,493
...he starts talking absurd things.

604
01:42:37,662 --> 01:42:40,495
'Around the virgin
mother and child.'

605
01:42:40,564 --> 01:42:43,829
'Holy infant in
the manger and child.'

606
01:42:44,502 --> 01:42:47,494
'Sleep in heavenly peace... '

607
01:42:47,571 --> 01:42:50,836
'Sleep in heavenly peace.'

608
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:55,502
'Silent night.'

609
01:42:55,579 --> 01:42:58,742
'Holy night... '

610
01:43:00,518 --> 01:43:03,510
'Silent night... '

611
01:43:03,888 --> 01:43:06,356
It doesn't hurt me that...

612
01:43:07,758 --> 01:43:09,350
...people die.

613
01:43:09,527 --> 01:43:10,858
'All is quiet, all is calm.'

614
01:43:11,028 --> 01:43:12,689
It hurts me the most...

615
01:43:12,763 --> 01:43:16,028
...that people don't live
their life even if alive.

616
01:43:16,767 --> 01:43:24,037
'All is quiet, all is calm.'

617
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:27,366
I want to say this one thing
to you for the last time.

618
01:43:27,545 --> 01:43:29,706
'Silent night... '

619
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:33,375
You can do whatever you
wanna do with this life.

620
01:43:36,554 --> 01:43:38,385
This life is only yours.

621
01:43:39,557 --> 01:43:41,388
It's only yours.

622
01:43:42,727 --> 01:43:46,561
Only you have the right
over your life.

623
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:50,390
God bless you.

624
01:43:52,069 --> 01:43:53,400
God bless you.

625
01:44:43,053 --> 01:44:44,987
Hello!
- Hello, Jiya.

626
01:44:50,795 --> 01:44:52,456
Uncle John is no more.

627
01:44:57,635 --> 01:44:59,466
He went away leaving me alone.

628
01:45:04,642 --> 01:45:06,473
He was quiet!

629
01:45:11,148 --> 01:45:13,548
He was talking about
you till his end.

630
01:45:21,659 --> 01:45:23,490
I am alone now, Jiya.

631
01:45:27,665 --> 01:45:29,656
I am feeling lonely.

632
01:45:57,862 --> 01:46:00,524
'Ln the crowd and in loneliness.'

633
01:46:00,598 --> 01:46:03,533
'Ln the depth of my thirst.'

634
01:46:03,734 --> 01:46:06,532
'Ln pain and in anguish.'

635
01:46:06,604 --> 01:46:12,270
'I miss you... always.'

636
01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:17,877
'I miss you... always.'

637
01:46:18,949 --> 01:46:21,713
'Ln songs and in music.'

638
01:46:22,553 --> 01:46:24,748
'Ln my dreams and while I am awake.'

639
01:46:24,889 --> 01:46:27,824
'Ln the sunlight and in the shade.'

640
01:46:27,892 --> 01:46:33,558
'I miss you... always.'

641
01:46:33,631 --> 01:46:39,069
'I miss you... always.'

642
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:42,732
'Ln the crowd and in loneliness.'

643
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:45,900
'Ln the depth of my thirst.'

644
01:46:46,744 --> 01:46:48,905
'Ln pain and in anguish.'

645
01:46:49,113 --> 01:46:54,745
'I miss you... always.'

646
01:46:54,852 --> 01:47:00,313
'I miss you... always.'

647
01:47:37,962 --> 01:47:43,628
'Your love is my life.'

648
01:47:43,901 --> 01:47:49,635
'I can't forget your love.'

649
01:47:56,046 --> 01:48:01,814
'Your love is my life.'

650
01:48:01,919 --> 01:48:07,653
'I can't forget your love.'

651
01:48:07,992 --> 01:48:13,988
'I try my best day and night.'

652
01:48:14,064 --> 01:48:19,730
'But I can't erase your image.'

653
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:22,664
'Ln the depth of my thirst.'

654
01:48:22,873 --> 01:48:25,842
'Ln the crowd and in loneliness.'

655
01:48:25,943 --> 01:48:28,673
'Ln pain and in anguish.'

656
01:48:28,746 --> 01:48:34,343
'I miss you... always.'

657
01:48:34,418 --> 01:48:40,414
'I miss you... always.'

658
01:49:11,255 --> 01:49:16,454
'I never dreamt that...

659
01:49:17,895 --> 01:49:23,265
...l'd have to live without you.'

660
01:49:29,907 --> 01:49:35,743
'I never dreamt that...

661
01:49:35,913 --> 01:49:40,475
...l'd have to live without you.'

662
01:49:41,919 --> 01:49:47,357
'O beloved, if you call me...

663
01:49:47,925 --> 01:49:53,158
...l'll break all promises and come.'

664
01:49:53,297 --> 01:49:56,095
'Ln the dark shade of my locks.'

665
01:49:56,767 --> 01:49:59,292
'Ln the crowd and in loneliness.'

666
01:49:59,937 --> 01:50:02,098
'Ln pain and in anguish.'

667
01:50:02,172 --> 01:50:07,838
'I miss you... always.'

668
01:50:07,978 --> 01:50:13,382
'I miss you... always.'

669
01:50:14,785 --> 01:50:17,310
'Ln the crowd and in loneliness.'

670
01:50:17,955 --> 01:50:20,321
'Ln the depth of my thirst.'

671
01:50:20,958 --> 01:50:23,324
'Ln pain and in anguish.'

672
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:29,262
'I miss you... always.'

673
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:34,965
'I miss you... always.'

674
01:50:35,472 --> 01:50:45,074
'I miss you... always.'

675
01:50:47,985 --> 01:50:50,146
Sir, let's go home.

676
01:50:51,155 --> 01:50:52,816
It's your wedding this evening.

677
01:50:57,995 --> 01:50:59,826
Wedding?
- Yes, sir.

678
01:51:01,999 --> 01:51:03,830
Shankar, why am I
doing this wedding?

679
01:51:07,237 --> 01:51:09,000
Sir, you are helpless.

680
01:51:12,176 --> 01:51:13,837
I am not helpless. This
is just a pretense.

681
01:51:15,179 --> 01:51:16,840
Because I can't forfeit money.

682
01:51:17,848 --> 01:51:19,839
I can forfeit all the luxuries.

683
01:51:21,185 --> 01:51:23,244
The money which means
nothing in the end.

684
01:51:27,024 --> 01:51:28,855
See this.

685
01:51:29,193 --> 01:51:30,854
Uncle John.

686
01:51:31,361 --> 01:51:32,851
What did he take away with him?

687
01:51:34,031 --> 01:51:35,862
Nothing.

688
01:51:36,033 --> 01:51:37,864
He took only our love
with him, didn't he?

689
01:51:40,137 --> 01:51:42,196
And I am marrying someone
else for money.

690
01:51:43,373 --> 01:51:46,934
Even though I know... that
I can't live without Jiya.

691
01:51:50,414 --> 01:51:51,881
Uncle John, I have understood...

692
01:51:53,283 --> 01:51:54,875
I have understood why the
monkey was not able...

693
01:51:54,952 --> 01:51:56,886
...to take out his hand
from the glass jar.

694
01:51:58,222 --> 01:52:00,053
Because greediness
was his weak link.

695
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:04,220
Uncle John, see this.

696
01:52:04,428 --> 01:52:05,895
I have taken out my hand
from this glass jar.

697
01:52:07,431 --> 01:52:09,399
You were right.

698
01:52:10,901 --> 01:52:12,892
This is my life.

699
01:52:13,237 --> 01:52:14,898
And only I have the
right over my life.

700
01:52:16,106 --> 01:52:17,903
Now I will only do the thing...

701
01:52:19,243 --> 01:52:21,177
...which I should have done
in the very beginning.

702
01:52:22,246 --> 01:52:24,237
Even the Pavilion is ready now.

703
01:52:24,982 --> 01:52:27,075
Your son has not arrived yet.

704
01:52:27,251 --> 01:52:29,242
He'll come, Madhwani. He'll come.

705
01:52:29,319 --> 01:52:31,583
Mittal, I just want
to say one thing.

706
01:52:32,990 --> 01:52:37,518
If your son doesn't come today...
then I'll murder him.

707
01:52:44,434 --> 01:52:47,267
Suit, suit.

708
01:52:50,007 --> 01:52:54,944
Suit... suit... Maroon suit... for me...

709
01:53:00,450 --> 01:53:02,111
Please forgive me.

710
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:04,954
I hurt you that day.

711
01:53:07,024 --> 01:53:08,116
I am sorry.

712
01:53:11,028 --> 01:53:12,461
You are Jiya's big brother, right?

713
01:53:13,297 --> 01:53:14,457
Right?

714
01:53:15,632 --> 01:53:17,463
I have come here to ask
her hand in marriage.

715
01:53:19,369 --> 01:53:21,132
I want to marry her.

716
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:24,300
Yes.

717
01:53:24,374 --> 01:53:27,138
Yes... marriage.
- Marriage...

718
01:53:31,048 --> 01:53:32,572
That's enough. That's enough.

719
01:53:35,052 --> 01:53:36,314
Is Jiya not at home?

720
01:53:36,486 --> 01:53:39,148
She's... not... at home.
- Not at home? - No.

721
01:53:39,222 --> 01:53:41,986
Then where is she?
- Coffee shop.

722
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:45,322
Coffee shop?
- Coffee shop... suit.

723
01:53:45,395 --> 01:53:46,487
Which Coffee shop?

724
01:53:48,065 --> 01:53:49,498
First tell me, which coffee shop?

725
01:53:49,566 --> 01:53:51,659
I won't give the suit. First
tell me, which coffee shop?

726
01:53:53,070 --> 01:53:54,332
Which coffee shop?

727
01:54:10,187 --> 01:54:12,678
If destiny wants us to
be united together...

728
01:54:12,756 --> 01:54:17,523
...then just expect this note
to reach you anytime.

729
01:54:21,098 --> 01:54:22,190
Ouch!

730
01:54:22,265 --> 01:54:23,357
You idiot!

731
01:54:24,101 --> 01:54:25,193
I am sorry.

732
01:54:28,205 --> 01:54:29,365
Hi!

733
01:54:40,117 --> 01:54:42,585
Can you get leave from here
for the next 60 years?

734
01:54:45,389 --> 01:54:47,220
Daksh, you are not in your senses.

735
01:54:48,125 --> 01:54:50,719
You are getting married
in the next 20 minutes.

736
01:54:50,794 --> 01:54:52,728
Jiya, I have come to
my senses only now.

737
01:54:55,132 --> 01:54:56,224
What can I do?

738
01:54:56,299 --> 01:54:59,268
I come to know everything
late in life.

739
01:55:01,138 --> 01:55:02,571
Please marry me.

740
01:55:04,574 --> 01:55:05,632
Please.

741
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:14,808
Please.

742
01:55:21,425 --> 01:55:25,088
Do you have any idea of how are
you going to live without money?

743
01:55:25,162 --> 01:55:27,096
Just like the other
poor people live.

744
01:55:30,167 --> 01:55:34,103
Jiya, I swear on you.
I'll never drink again.

745
01:55:35,906 --> 01:55:37,498
I'll always keep you happy.

746
01:55:39,709 --> 01:55:41,301
And I'll always make you laugh.

747
01:55:45,182 --> 01:55:46,274
Say yes.

748
01:55:46,349 --> 01:55:48,442
Yes... yes... yes.

749
01:55:59,196 --> 01:56:01,460
Yes.
- Yes!

750
01:56:07,471 --> 01:56:09,462
Will you help me give this news...

751
01:56:09,539 --> 01:56:11,632
...to Mr. Mehta and Mr. Madhwani?

752
01:56:13,477 --> 01:56:14,637
Of course.

753
01:56:14,811 --> 01:56:18,144
Now I will do everything as you say.

754
01:56:19,216 --> 01:56:20,308
I'll be back.

755
01:56:38,668 --> 01:56:39,760
Hi!

756
01:56:48,245 --> 01:56:49,678
Hi!

757
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:54,343
Can you tell me where the bride is?

758
01:56:54,417 --> 01:56:55,509
I am the groom.

759
01:56:56,253 --> 01:56:59,347
Fellow, the bride is upstairs.

760
01:57:00,924 --> 01:57:02,186
Thank you.

761
01:57:04,861 --> 01:57:06,522
O God, bless us! Hey man,
what are you doing?

762
01:57:12,269 --> 01:57:14,533
This has got loose. Where
is the nuptial thread?

763
01:57:14,871 --> 01:57:17,601
Hey idiot, the husband ties it
after the seven holy rounds.

764
01:57:17,707 --> 01:57:19,698
She doesn't know even this.

765
01:57:24,881 --> 01:57:26,212
Hello!

766
01:57:26,283 --> 01:57:28,217
Hi!
- The groom.

767
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:35,883
Anahita... I am sorry
for being late.

768
01:57:35,959 --> 01:57:37,950
Traffic you know.
- It's ok.

769
01:57:38,562 --> 01:57:40,621
Can I talk to you in private?

770
01:57:41,565 --> 01:57:42,623
Yes.

771
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:44,858
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

772
01:57:45,302 --> 01:57:46,564
Excuse me.

773
01:57:47,404 --> 01:57:48,962
Daksh, what's the matter?

774
01:57:50,307 --> 01:57:52,241
The bride's room is upstairs.

775
01:57:52,309 --> 01:57:54,243
The groom has gone upstairs.

776
01:57:54,311 --> 01:57:57,439
Now, don't ask me, what is
the time of the wedding?

777
01:57:57,514 --> 01:57:58,640
I don't know.

778
01:58:00,317 --> 01:58:02,842
The wedding is not going
to take place. - What?!

779
01:58:02,919 --> 01:58:05,251
I think you are drunk.
- Yes.

780
01:58:05,422 --> 01:58:06,582
But I...

781
01:58:06,656 --> 01:58:08,920
Cool. Men often get nervous
before the marriage.

782
01:58:08,992 --> 01:58:10,926
You are getting scared, right?

783
01:58:11,061 --> 01:58:13,461
Yes, Anahita. I am getting scared.

784
01:58:13,597 --> 01:58:15,428
I have drunk a lot too.

785
01:58:15,498 --> 01:58:18,262
But the truth is that
I don't love you.

786
01:58:18,335 --> 01:58:19,927
I don't love you.

787
01:58:21,338 --> 01:58:22,930
I love someone else.

788
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:29,340
I love Jiya.

789
01:58:30,347 --> 01:58:32,281
Anahita, look. No need to cry.

790
01:58:34,084 --> 01:58:35,881
Anahita, look. No need to cry.

791
01:58:35,952 --> 01:58:38,443
Anahita, please listen.
- Beware if you speak a word more!

792
01:58:38,521 --> 01:58:39,954
I'll break your face.

793
01:58:40,357 --> 01:58:41,619
Daddy!

794
01:58:47,364 --> 01:58:48,626
Daddy!

795
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:52,458
Hello, Mr. Madhwani.

796
01:58:52,535 --> 01:58:53,900
You have sported a
really good turban.

797
01:58:53,970 --> 01:58:55,028
Very colorful.

798
01:58:58,375 --> 01:59:01,708
Hey man, what's going on?

799
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:08,982
Actually, when Daksh gets nervous...

800
01:59:09,052 --> 01:59:10,917
...he breaks things this way.

801
01:59:10,987 --> 01:59:12,978
Catch your grandma's ring.

802
01:59:13,056 --> 01:59:14,717
And slip it on that witch's finger.

803
01:59:18,495 --> 01:59:20,725
Hello, Jiya. Meet him.

804
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:22,320
He's Mr. Madhwani.

805
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:24,333
And she's Ms. Anahita.

806
01:59:24,401 --> 01:59:25,732
Daksh, are you ok?

807
01:59:27,404 --> 01:59:29,395
You, beast! If he doesn't
love your daughter...

808
01:59:29,472 --> 01:59:31,406
...then will you make him
love her by using force?

809
01:59:31,474 --> 01:59:33,339
Beware if you touch him.

810
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:34,877
He loves me.
- Yes.

811
01:59:35,412 --> 01:59:36,674
Move aside.

812
01:59:40,517 --> 01:59:44,681
So, she's that call girl...
that bar dancer...

813
01:59:44,754 --> 01:59:48,747
...who made you break
my daughter's heart.

814
01:59:48,825 --> 01:59:50,520
You humiliated her... huh?

815
01:59:50,694 --> 01:59:53,094
She's that mistress.

816
01:59:53,163 --> 01:59:55,028
Mistress?
- Yes, mistress!

817
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:12,372
Daddy, please... daddy,
please don't hit him.

818
02:00:12,449 --> 02:00:13,882
Get out from this room! Go!

819
02:00:14,451 --> 02:00:17,716
Get out from this room!
Everybody get out!

820
02:00:20,557 --> 02:00:22,787
I won't leave him!
I won't leave him.

821
02:00:25,729 --> 02:00:27,720
Nug...! Nug...!

822
02:00:27,897 --> 02:00:29,728
It's not nug. It's gun.

823
02:00:32,469 --> 02:00:34,403
Jiya, what if we can't
live together.

824
02:00:34,471 --> 02:00:35,733
We can at least die together.

825
02:00:35,805 --> 02:00:37,739
I love you, Jiya.
- I love you too, Daksh.

826
02:00:37,907 --> 02:00:39,397
What's going on here?

827
02:00:39,476 --> 02:00:41,410
Hey on whom are you pointing
the gun, you scum!

828
02:00:41,478 --> 02:00:42,911
Lower that gun!

829
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:46,743
Scum, you'll shoot my grandson!

830
02:00:46,816 --> 02:00:48,909
I am a very mean woman.

831
02:00:48,985 --> 02:00:50,418
Throw the gun down!

832
02:00:50,487 --> 02:00:52,751
Throw the gun or I will
riddle you with bullets.

833
02:00:53,923 --> 02:00:55,584
Throw the gun down.

834
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:04,762
Ladies and gentleman!

835
02:01:04,834 --> 02:01:05,926
Ladies and gentleman!

836
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:09,102
Silence please! Silence...

837
02:01:09,172 --> 02:01:13,108
I am extremely sorry that
you all had to wait for me.

838
02:01:13,176 --> 02:01:14,643
I am sorry.

839
02:01:15,612 --> 02:01:17,842
But you must have known till now...

840
02:01:17,914 --> 02:01:20,178
...that I am not getting married.

841
02:01:20,517 --> 02:01:22,451
No! This is very bad.

842
02:01:22,519 --> 02:01:25,454
So, all of you can go
home now. Bye. Bye.

843
02:01:25,522 --> 02:01:26,989
Just a second.

844
02:01:27,056 --> 02:01:28,614
One more thing.

845
02:01:28,691 --> 02:01:32,991
It may happen that I won't
meet you in future.

846
02:01:34,531 --> 02:01:37,967
Because I am going to
be very poor from now.

847
02:01:38,535 --> 02:01:40,799
I won't even have the money
to pay for the rickshaw.

848
02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:42,804
I love you all.

849
02:01:49,546 --> 02:01:51,980
Daksh, you must apply the ointment.
- Fast.

850
02:01:52,549 --> 02:01:53,811
Sorry... sorry.

851
02:01:55,552 --> 02:01:58,146
Be like the good boy
you are right now.

852
02:01:58,221 --> 02:01:59,984
Love me a lot after the marriage.

853
02:02:00,056 --> 02:02:01,819
And do everything as I say. Ok?

854
02:02:01,891 --> 02:02:03,825
Jiya, I'll do everything as you say.

855
02:02:03,893 --> 02:02:06,828
Just promise me that you'll never
apply this burning ointment.

856
02:02:06,896 --> 02:02:08,227
I'll never apply this.

857
02:02:09,566 --> 02:02:11,557
I swear by you Jiya...

858
02:02:11,634 --> 02:02:14,569
...I am desperate to live
the life of a commoner.

859
02:02:15,572 --> 02:02:18,837
Just like millions of people go
for their work every morning...

860
02:02:18,908 --> 02:02:22,844
...in the same way, I'll
sit in my car and...

861
02:02:22,912 --> 02:02:26,177
Hey... poor people don't have cars.

862
02:02:26,583 --> 02:02:29,518
They either go by
walking or by bus...

863
02:02:29,586 --> 02:02:31,850
...or they travel by train.
- Fine, I will travel by bus.

864
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:37,686
And when I return home, you
will be washing clothes...

865
02:02:38,595 --> 02:02:41,029
...and for dinner we will share a
piece of dry bread in candle light.

866
02:02:44,601 --> 02:02:46,694
Jiya, our life would
be so wonderful!

867
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:48,701
I will go for a job.

868
02:02:48,771 --> 02:02:50,534
Daksh Mittal will go for a job.

869
02:02:50,607 --> 02:02:51,938
That's enough!

870
02:02:54,611 --> 02:02:57,045
You will not go for a job.

871
02:02:58,348 --> 02:03:01,875
Your grandfather and I have
not earned this much health...

872
02:03:01,951 --> 02:03:05,284
...to let you travel
in crowded buses.

873
02:03:05,622 --> 02:03:09,888
Let you have only one dry
piece bread that too half...

874
02:03:09,959 --> 02:03:14,953
No! No one has ever worked in
the Mittal family after us.

875
02:03:15,031 --> 02:03:16,555
Your father never worked.

876
02:03:16,633 --> 02:03:19,625
You'll never work and even
your kids won't work.

877
02:03:19,702 --> 02:03:20,896
Yes.

878
02:03:21,771 --> 02:03:24,763
Hey girl, make your future
husband understand.

879
02:03:25,642 --> 02:03:28,907
That even though he deceived me...

880
02:03:28,978 --> 02:03:34,075
...still I have decided to give
the 100 million dollars in his name...

881
02:03:34,150 --> 02:03:35,742
...only to him.

882
02:03:35,818 --> 02:03:38,912
No, Grandma. I want to work.
I want to be poor.

883
02:03:41,758 --> 02:03:46,252
Hey, scum. When poverty
knocks your door...

884
02:03:46,329 --> 02:03:48,797
...love escapes through the window.

885
02:03:49,666 --> 02:03:51,600
Hey girl, explain this to him.

886
02:03:51,668 --> 02:03:53,659
I am going to call
that stupid priest.

887
02:03:53,736 --> 02:03:54,930
In the meantime, make
him understand...

888
02:03:55,004 --> 02:03:56,130
...that he'll have to take
the money at any cost.

889
02:03:56,205 --> 02:03:58,935
Grandma, listen to me.
Please tell her.

890
02:03:59,008 --> 02:04:00,339
Hey grandma...

891
02:04:15,959 --> 02:04:17,950
'I have decided.'

892
02:04:18,027 --> 02:04:24,626
'I have decided, come what may...

893
02:04:24,701 --> 02:04:29,297
...I will love only you.'

894
02:04:29,372 --> 02:04:31,636
'I have decided.'

895
02:04:31,808 --> 02:04:34,641
'Yes, I have decided.'

896
02:04:34,978 --> 02:04:37,640
'I have decided.'

897
02:05:03,006 --> 02:05:05,668
'This separation is
only for a few days.'

898
02:05:05,742 --> 02:05:08,836
'This distance is only
for a few days.

899
02:05:08,911 --> 02:05:11,846
'Then every season
will be of union.'

900
02:05:11,914 --> 02:05:15,077
'Every moment will be beautiful.'

901
02:05:20,857 --> 02:05:24,020
'What can I tell you of
this heart's pain.'

902
02:05:24,093 --> 02:05:27,187
'I can't express this to you.'

903
02:05:27,263 --> 02:05:30,027
'You have made me so anxious...

904
02:05:30,099 --> 02:05:33,694
...that I can't be away from
you even for a moment.'

905
02:05:35,772 --> 02:05:38,104
'I have decided.'

906
02:05:38,508 --> 02:05:44,708
'I have decided, come what may...

907
02:05:44,781 --> 02:05:49,718
...I will love only you.'

908
02:05:49,786 --> 02:05:51,777
'I have decided.'

909
02:05:51,854 --> 02:05:54,914
'Yes, I have decided.'

910
02:06:23,086 --> 02:06:25,919
'My lips never moved.'

911
02:06:25,988 --> 02:06:29,253
'But my feelings reached
you without words.'

912
02:06:29,325 --> 02:06:32,089
'You have showered me with
your precious love.'

913
02:06:32,161 --> 02:06:35,756
'You have made me invaluable.'

914
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:44,333
'I have never seen such
colorful life before.'

915
02:06:44,407 --> 02:06:47,501
'I have never seen such
colorful life before.'

916
02:06:47,577 --> 02:06:53,948
'Loneliness covered my
life before you came.'

917
02:06:56,185 --> 02:06:58,312
'I have decided.'

918
02:06:58,855 --> 02:07:04,953
'Yes, I have decided,
come what may...

919
02:07:05,027 --> 02:07:09,964
...I will love only you.'

920
02:07:10,032 --> 02:07:12,125
'I have decided.'

921
02:07:12,869 --> 02:07:18,136
'I have decided, come what may...

922
02:07:18,207 --> 02:07:19,799
...I will love only you.'
