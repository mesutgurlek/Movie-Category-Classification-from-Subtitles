(# Moonlight Serenade)

2
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,642
Hello, Mr Kranz.

3
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:53,759
- I'd like to redeem my...
- I know! The trombone.

4
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:56,162
I always keep her hanging in the window

5
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:59,517
so when you walk by
you can see she is still there.

6
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,125
I keep my eyes on her.

7
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:04,398
Say, Mr Miller,
where'd you got the money this time?

8
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:08,679
- Working in a gas station.
- And now you've got another band job?

9
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:13,323
Yep. I'm with Minton at the Sunset Hotel.
Chummy's gonna pick me up.

10
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,803
Your friend Chummy,
why don't he hock something?

11
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:19,122
- He plays the piano.
- I see!

12
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:24,321
That's all we need! To schlep a piano
in and out every once in a while.

13
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:27,723
That string of pearls,
how much did you say that was?

14
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:30,156
I'd like to give my girl a birthday present.

15
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:32,163
Isn't it wonderful to be young?

16
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:37,281
He just got his trombone out of hock
and he wants to buy a $100 necklace.

17
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:39,045
$100?

18
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:42,079
I'd like to give her this.
Haven't seen her for a few years.

19
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:44,925
- You are engaged?
- No, not exactly.

20
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:49,199
We went around together when we were
in college. University of Colorado.

21
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:52,125
$100. That's a lot of money, isn't it?

22
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:55,239
For a regular customer,
I make a special price.

23
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:58,279
- (Car horn)
- I guess that's Chummy.

24
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:01,038
A hundred dollars.

25
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:05,598
Here's for the horn.

26
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:08,605
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

27
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:16,406
- Where'd you get this one, Chummy?
- Made a deal on my Briscoe.

28
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:19,723
She's a beaut.
45 horsepower. Only four years old.

29
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:23,362
- 45 horse...
- Come on, hop in. We gotta get goin'.

30
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:27,400
- Isn't this a darb, kid?
- Yeah, gee whiz!

31
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:30,484
- You bring my arrangement?
- You're sittin' on it.

32
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:34,236
But this is the Sunset Hotel,
potted palms and marble stairs.

33
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:37,040
- Minton's band plays sweet.
- I know that.

34
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:40,636
Don't try to slip in
that arrangement of yours tonight.

35
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,521
- We don't wanna lose this job.
- Stop worryin'. This is a classic.

36
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,798
I Dreamt I Dwelt In Marble Halls,
it's a classic!

37
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:52,841
When Minton hears this arrangement,
he'll give us a job for life. Let's go.

38
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:02,565
(# Upbeat swing)

39
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,923
(# Romantic swing)

40
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:43,606
Too bad you can't keep the trombone
and hock the arrangement.

41
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,635
- You know where there's Venice?
- Italy.

42
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:58,123
No! Venice here.
By the pier, with that big wheel.

43
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:01,443
- Oh, yeah.
- You boys go out there next Monday.

44
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:04,843
- This fellow Pollack, he has tryouts.
- Ben Pollack?

45
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,402
Ben Pollack. He gets together a new band.

46
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:10,563
They go for a long, long trip.

47
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:13,565
- How do you know?
- A fellow told me this morning.

48
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:16,326
- You boys go out there.
- Sure. Thanks a lot.

49
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,686
Next Monday?

50
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:20,195
That gives you a week
to get your trombone out.

51
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:23,080
- You could work in a gas station.
- Not me.

52
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,163
I'm gonna work on arrangements.

53
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:29,120
For me, I'm glad for your business,
Mr Miller,

54
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:33,445
but why don't you give up this arranging
and stick with the trombone?

55
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:36,524
That's a good question.
I wish I knew the answer.

56
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:40,321
But I have one idea up here in my head.

57
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:43,723
To me, music is more
than just one instrument.

58
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,520
It's a whole orchestra playing together. See?

59
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:50,355
The only way I can express myself
is to work out an arrangement.

60
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:53,126
See? Thanks for the tip.

61
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,362
Come on.

62
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,637
(# Ragtime piano)

63
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,483
Great!

64
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:51,724
- Thanks, Ben.
- You're in. You're in.

65
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,758
- Who's next?
- I am.

66
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,883
I've done some arrangements...

67
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:59,646
I'm full up on arrangements.
I need more musicians.

68
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:03,282
I've been working on 'em all week.
They're in your style.

69
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:07,081
I appreciate that. Lay them on the piano,
I'll try 'em some other time.

70
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,958
Uh-huh.

71
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:13,277
- My name's on the cover.
- Swell.

72
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:14,965
OK, who's next?

73
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:18,124
I am. My name's Schwartz.
Wilbur Schwartz.

74
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,716
Clarinet, eh? Sit down at the first chair
and blow a little bit.

75
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:26,318
- What tune do you want me to play?
- Do you read at sight?

76
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:29,484
- Try me.
- Chummy, get him something to read.

77
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:47,478
One, two.

78
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:49,518
(# Plays upbeat tune)

79
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,878
(Music stops)

80
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:35,806
Hey, Glenn! Come on back.
Mr Pollack wants to talk to you.

81
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:39,726
He says your arrangement is a pip!
Your arrangement!

82
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:43,720
I'm playing in the band
and working on arrangements.

83
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:45,439
I got a two-week advance.

84
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,478
You are a regular Rockefeller!

85
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,884
- I want to thank you for everything.
- Don't mention about it.

86
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:54,805
I'm only glad it worked so good out.

87
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,998
About that string of pearls
for my girl's birthday.

88
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:02,199
You said something
about a special price for those.

89
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:06,877
For you it's $80.
You pay me 40 down and $5 a week.

90
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:09,236
- Good enough.
- Shall I mail it for you?

91
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:12,245
I better take 'em with me.
I'm not sure of her address.

92
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:15,518
We're booked into Denver.
She lives right near there.

93
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,604
Ten, 20, 30, 40.
There's the 40.

94
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:22,765
- And here is for the trombone.
- All right.

95
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:26,243
- Thank you very much.
- Same to you, and good luck.

96
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:29,165
I hope you stay out
of pawnshops for a while.

97
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:32,404
- So do I! Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

98
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:43,162
- Glenn, come on!
- A Pierce-Arrow?

99
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,085
Yeah! I got it for the old car and 100 bucks.

100
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,085
Much heavier.
It'll hold the road better on a long trip.

101
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:52,164
If the band folds up,
we can sell it to an undertaker.

102
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:55,085
Get in the back, I'll give you a ride in style.

103
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,519
Hurry, Glenn. We're due
at the Denver Palace in ten minutes.

104
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:20,286
- How much, sir?
- Oh, give us five.

105
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:35,440
Hello. I want Boulder 6-1-7-0.

106
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:39,518
How many?

107
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:47,438
(Telephone)

108
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:50,238
I'll get it, Mother.

109
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,561
Hello?

110
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:58,599
Hello? Helen? How's my girl?

111
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:01,363
Your girl? Who is this?

112
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,682
Who is this? Is this Helen Burger?

113
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,365
Yes, but there must be some...

114
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:09,366
- Well, it's Glenn!
- Glenn? Glenn who?

115
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,045
It's Glenn Miller!

116
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,442
Glenn Miller?

117
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,762
Oh, Glenn Miller.

118
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:20,436
Well, now, honestly.
After two years and not a word.

119
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:22,125
Didn't you get my card?

120
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,317
The one you wrote
a year ago last Christmas?

121
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,756
Well, I haven't heard from you either.

122
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:31,119
I didn't know where you were.
I don't even know where you are now.

123
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:35,365
I'm down here in Denver.
I want to see you. How about tonight?

124
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:37,557
Oh, I'm sorry. I have a date.

125
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:41,122
Couldn't you break it?
I'm with Pollack and we're leavin' tomorrow.

126
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,964
Now, honestly, I...

127
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:45,726
(Chummy) Glenn, come on, hurry it up.

128
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,964
I'll see you later, then.
Gee, there's a lot I want to tell you.

129
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:53,558
- Glenn, wait a minute...
- I'll be out right after I finish work. Bye.

130
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,638
Glenn? Hello?

131
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:01,757
Well, honestly.

132
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:11,439
- Hi, Dad.
- Going out, Helen?

133
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:14,365
This is a new wrinkle, isn't it?
Ed keeping you waiting.

134
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:17,399
It isn't Ed tonight.
It's a man I haven't seen for years.

135
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:19,483
Not Ed? What's happened?

136
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,995
It must be serious for you
to break a date with Ed.

137
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:24,766
No, Mother. Glenn isn't my type.

138
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:28,959
I guess I'm just too practical
or unromantic or something.

139
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:35,082
I want a man like Ed who's got a factory
or a store or something solid.

140
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:38,403
I certainly don't want
a wandering nomad like Glenn Miller.

141
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:40,802
What's he do, this Glenn Miller?

142
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:45,122
I don't really know except he said
he was in Denver for overnight.

143
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,237
He's gonna pick me up after work.

144
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:51,758
He must be a hard worker.
It's nearly 9:00 now.

145
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:54,480
It is?

146
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,518
Well.

147
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,761
(Clock strikes)

148
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:07,924
Oh! There's really no excuse for this!

149
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,958
The least he could've done was phone.

150
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:12,567
- Unless he was in an accident.
- Call him.

151
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:14,598
How can I? I don't know where he is.

152
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:17,605
If I'm going hunting in the morning,
I've gotta get to bed.

153
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:20,161
Sam's picking me up at the crack of dawn.

154
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:23,762
- Doesn't look as if he's coming tonight.
- It certainly doesn't!

155
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:26,002
Even if he did come, I wouldn't see him.

156
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:28,242
Then we can all go to bed?

157
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:32,041
Well, so much for Mr Glenn Miller.

158
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:34,078
I'll never see him again.

159
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,238
(Glenn, calling softly) Helen?

160
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:54,246
Helen?

161
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,437
(Whistles)

162
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,086
Helen?

163
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:06,605
Helen!

164
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:09,207
(Whistles)

165
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,966
Helen! (Whistles)

166
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,365
- Oh, there you are.
- Glenn Miller, you go away.

167
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:22,437
I don't want to go away.
I came to see you. We have a date.

168
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:27,322
- Shh! You'll wake up the neighbourhood.
- How can I talk to you?

169
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:30,917
You keep quiet. I'll be right down.

170
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,246
Hello, Helen.

171
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:55,847
What's the matter with you,
coming at this hour?

172
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:59,675
I told you I'd come out after work.
I got here as quick as I could.

173
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:03,686
- Shh. Be quiet.
- You haven't changed a bit, have you?

174
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:07,356
Just as feisty as ever, and just as pretty too.

175
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,685
I must be pretty! Wearing this kimono
and my hair up in curlers.

176
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:14,002
Is that what they are? Come on, sit down.

177
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,483
- It's cold out here.
- Come on. It's a beautiful night.

178
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:18,755
Gee.

179
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:23,198
There. I bought you a present
for your birthday.

180
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:26,876
My birthday?
That isn't until next November.

181
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,918
This is for your last birthday.

182
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,522
Why, they're beautiful!
But I can't accept a present like this.

183
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,798
Why not? They're not real.
I wish they were.

184
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:43,045
I got 'em out in Los Angeles in a pa...
In a, uh... A, uh...

185
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,476
I'll get you some real ones someday.

186
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:47,966
Honestly.

187
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:51,682
Two years and not a word
and then a present like this.

188
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:56,403
You know, with some people
you don't have to write. You just know.

189
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:59,564
- I knew you'd be here.
- Oh, you did?

190
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,758
Sure. I knew you'd be just the same.

191
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:05,799
Just sitting around waiting
for you to show up, I suppose?

192
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:09,522
"How is my girl?" you said.
Well, you happen to be wrong!

193
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,525
I've been engaged to Ed Healey
for nearly a year.

194
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:15,877
Did it occur to you that I might not care
if I ever saw you again?

195
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:17,997
No, it never did.

196
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,958
Never.

197
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:23,079
- Never.
- Why can't I ever stay mad at you?

198
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:25,766
You had me worried there for a minute.

199
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:28,082
Honestly!

200
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:32,678
If you were anybody else,
I would never speak to you again.

201
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:37,118
Look at me. Sitting here
in this kimono and my hair all...

202
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,727
- Those curlers.
- Terrible, isn't it?

203
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,762
Helen, now look, I've got an idea.

204
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:48,561
Come with me to Fort Morgan.
I'm gonna introduce you to my folks.

205
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,203
- Now?
- Right now.

206
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:53,681
People do sleep between 3am and 6am.

207
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:56,116
They'll be crazy about you.

208
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,125
- And they'll give us breakfast.
- How do we get there?

209
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,601
- I'll get a taxi.
- A taxi to Fort Morgan?

210
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,842
- Sure.
- That's so extravagant.

211
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,481
- It isn't far.
- Maybe I can get the family car.

212
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,518
Wonderful. Wait a minute.

213
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,683
Let me try these on for size, hm?

214
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:12,996
There.

215
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,083
(Door opening)

216
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:17,756
Uh-oh.

217
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:20,275
- Mr Burger, I...
- Take it easy, son.

218
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:23,160
I'm just going hunting, for jackrabbits.

219
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:42,115
- Glenn!
- It's Glenn!

220
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:45,557
Hi, Herb. How are you?
Glad to see you. Hello, Irene.

221
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,519
- What a surprise! I had no idea.
- Hello, Mother.

222
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,558
Glad to see you. Mother, this is...

223
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:53,246
You don't need to tell me. You're Helen!

224
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,721
We've been hearing about you for years.

225
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:58,076
Why, yes. I'm very happy to meet you.

226
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:01,119
- Daddy'll be down in a minute.
- Dean and Velna?

227
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,806
They're fine! I'll show you
a picture of the baby.

228
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:06,680
- Sure.
- She your girl, Glenn?

229
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,399
That's right, Herb.

230
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,597
Are you and Glenn gonna get married?

231
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:13,798
Don't ask that!
We just take such things for granted.

232
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:15,917
- How are you, son?
- Fine.

233
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:19,004
- And you're Helen. Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

234
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:22,881
- You gonna get these kids some breakfast?
- I certainly am!

235
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:26,681
You might've let us know where you are
and what your plans are.

236
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:29,685
We have to ask Helen, eh?
I'll bet he tells you everything.

237
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:33,003
Oh, no, Mr Miller.
I seem to be the last person he tells.

238
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,641
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.

239
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:37,723
- You like hotcakes, Helen?
- Yes.

240
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:39,564
Mom makes pretty good ones...

241
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:41,846
(Men) # Little brown jug, how I love thee

242
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,276
# Ha-ha-ha, you and me

243
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:48,764
# Little brown jug, how I love thee... #

244
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:54,360
Good old Colorado U.
It hasn't changed a bit.

245
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,875
No, it's just as pretty as ever.

246
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,602
We still have time. Let's walk
across the campus for old times' sake.

247
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:02,638
- I'd love to.
- Come on.

248
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:07,718
- Wish I didn't have to leave so soon.
- I do too.

249
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,361
Listen. It's the Glee Club rehearsing.

250
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:15,484
- I love that song.
- What, Little Brown Jug?

251
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:18,200
That's sort of a tin-eared tune.

252
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:20,636
Why, that's one of my favourites.

253
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:24,726
My dad used to sing it to me
when I was a little girl. I guess that's why.

254
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:27,076
- They sing it pretty well.
- Mm-hm.

255
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:31,644
When something's
really wonderful like that, I know it.

256
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:35,043
I get kind of a funny feeling
up the back of my neck.

257
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:38,762
That's how I can tell.
Sort of makes my hair stand on end.

258
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,037
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

259
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,521
Looks pretty normal from here.

260
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,558
It just feels that way!

261
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,722
- Remember that lake?
- Yes, I do.

262
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,966
- Where do you go from here?
- We're heading east.

263
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:59,283
Chicago, New York.
We're booked into the Club Fifty there.

264
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:01,158
- Ever been to New York?
- No.

265
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:03,562
Neither have I. I hear it's quite a town.

266
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:06,360
You're certainly seeing America, aren't you?

267
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,642
You think I'm kinda rudderless, don't you?

268
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:12,679
Wandering over the country with the band.

269
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,480
- Yes, I guess I do.
- But I'm not, though.

270
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:20,521
I know exactly where I'm going.
I know exactly what I want to do.

271
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,966
You do?

272
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:25,682
I'm not gonna be a sideman all my life,
a trombone player.

273
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,036
I'm gonna have a band all of my own.

274
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:30,920
I'm gonna play my own kind of music.

275
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:35,199
I... It's hard to explain, but a band...

276
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:39,684
A band oughta have a sound all of its own,
oughta have a personality.

277
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,167
- Sort of like a person.
- Uh-huh.

278
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,596
How do you get this different sound?

279
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:48,161
You see, the arrangements,

280
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,438
the way you score each one
of the individual instruments.

281
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:54,320
Some bands have that sound already,
like Pollack,

282
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:56,961
but it's not the right sound, not for me.

283
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,840
- What is?
- I don't know.

284
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:02,526
I don't know. I haven't found it yet.

285
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:05,957
But someday I'm gonna find it
and when I do...

286
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:08,282
You'll find it. I'm sure you will.

287
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:12,607
- You are?
- Hey, Glenn!

288
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:16,965
There's Chummy.
He found it all right. Goodbye.

289
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:20,556
It's been wonderful seeing you. Goodbye.
I'm comin'!

290
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:23,405
You'll be hearing from me. Wait and see.

291
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:29,684
- Come on, boy, let's go.
- All right, all right.

292
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:34,275
Bye.

293
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:44,439
Honestly.

294
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:55,040
(# Mellow version of Good Night Ladies)

295
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:17,997
How about one more?
One more number?

296
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:21,244
We can't, kids.
We're leaving for Atlantic City.

297
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:23,323
We'll be back in a couple of months.

298
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,198
Thanks a lot. Swell.

299
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:28,717
Fellas, listen just a minute
before you start packing up.

300
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:33,557
The bus leaves from the hotel for
Atlantic City tomorrow morning at 10:30.

301
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:37,998
Everybody be on time.
Don't be late, will ya? OK.

302
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:42,882
Ben, like I told you,

303
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:45,487
I guess this is where I get off.

304
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:47,722
I want to thank you for everything.

305
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,962
- You know what you're doin'?
- Yeah.

306
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:54,080
I wanna stick around New York for a while.
I want to do some studying.

307
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:57,278
Just when the band's
really startin' to take on.

308
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:00,717
I know all that. I appreciate
everything you've done for me

309
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:03,645
and I wish you all the luck in the world.

310
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:09,364
If there's... Any time you want me to do
an arrangement for you, just let me know.

311
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:13,036
That's an idea.
Well, so long, kid. A lotta luck.

312
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,442
- Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.

313
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:18,081
- You're really serious about this?
- Yeah.

314
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:21,437
Still got that crazy idea in your head,
that sound?

315
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:25,636
Hey, Don?

316
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:28,281
This is Chummy MacGregor.
This is Don Haynes.

317
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:31,205
- Hi.
- Glad to meet ya. You're the band booker.

318
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:33,556
Gonna try and get Glenn
some work arranging.

319
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,837
- It's an awful lonely town.
- I know.

320
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:39,846
I wish we could stick together,
but I've been eating for two years now.

321
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:42,720
It's gotten to be a habit.
I don't think I can break it.

322
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,837
I know.

323
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:48,038
Well, good luck, kid.
Hope you find a friendly pawn shop.

324
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:50,282
- Yeah, bye, Chummy.
- So long.

325
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:43,126
- Glenn!
- Hi, Don. How are you?

326
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,044
- What are you doin'?
- Not much.

327
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:49,922
Listen, Red Nichols is getting together
a pit band for a new musical, Girl Crazy.

328
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:52,879
I know you're still looking for
that sound but it's been two years.

329
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:56,044
- You won't find it on an empty stomach.
- I sure can't.

330
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:59,477
A lot of your friends are in the band -
Benny Goodman, Babe Russin.

331
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:03,645
- It's a great chance. It'll run all season.
- I guess I better take it.

332
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:05,882
I'll call you tomorrow. I gotta run.

333
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:07,918
Thanks a lot.

334

little brown jug, don't I love thee?

339
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:49,797
If I'd a cow that gave such milk,
I'd clothe her in the finest silk

- Who is it?
- Don't forget to turn off the roast.

345
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:09,721
Who is it?

346
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:10,995
Hello.

347
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:13,322
Helen, can you come
to New York right away?

348
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:17,201
Glenn! I don't know whether I can or not.

349
00:26:17,247 --> 00:26:19,124
But for heaven's sake, why?

350
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,158
So we can get married.

351
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,482
I need you, Helen. I can't wait any longer.

352
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:25,438
Glenn, I'm engaged!

353
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:29,036
That's right. It'll be a very short engagement.

354
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,966
No, you don't understand.
I'm engaged to Ed. Ed Healey.

355
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:36,204
Ed Healey? The fellow
you told me about two years ago?

356
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:40,035
- Yes.
- If you haven't gotten married in two years...

357
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:43,204
People just don't rush into getting married!

358
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:48,162
Nonsense, Helen. You come to New York,
marry me and get this thing settled.

359
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,437
I can't just walk out on him!

360
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:55,003
There's a train leaving Denver
at 11:30 tomorrow night. Can you get that?

361
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,878
Glenn, you just wait a minute.

362
00:26:56,927 --> 00:26:59,885
We can talk everything over
when you get here.

363
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:02,925
Honestly!

364
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:07,404
Call me from Denver so I can meet the train.
My number is Pennsylvania 6-5000.

365
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,517
Pennsylvania 6-5000.

366
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,035
Pennsylvania 6-5-0-0-0.

367
00:27:12,087 --> 00:27:14,806
And, Helen, bring a warm coat.

368
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:17,805
It gets kinda chilly here
this time of year. Goodbye.

369
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:19,166
Glenn!

370
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:46,442
What beats me is how she got Ed
to drive her into Denver.

371
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:53,836
(Tannoy announcement)

372
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,037
Helen!

373
00:27:57,087 --> 00:28:01,000
- Hi. You look wonderful.
- I've only come to talk things over.

374
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,242
We can talk it over on the way.

375
00:28:03,287 --> 00:28:06,723
I'm not going to let you
rush me into getting married.

376
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:09,679
Of course not.
But there isn't much time.

377
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:15,006
We have to pick up the licence,
then be uptown at the church by 7:00.

378
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:18,722
- I have to be in the theatre by eight.
- Wait a minute, Glenn.

379
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:21,486
Gee, I'm so glad you're here.

380
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:48,523
- Where are we going?
- The theatre.

381
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:52,401
You're gonna see a wonderful show,
Girl Crazy. I got you a box seat.

382
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:55,439
- No, I mean, on our honeymoon.
- The Pennsylvania Hotel.

383
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:59,400
Don's arranged for a big suite.
He's sending up the baggage.

384
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:02,405
The Pennsylvania Hotel?
Isn't that extravagant?

385
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:06,599
If we'd been married in Boulder
and come to New York on our honeymoon,

386
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,524
we'd be staying at a hotel.

387
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:12,480
- I suppose.
- Of course we would. Here's the ticket.

388
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:15,963
I'll meet you after the show.
I wanna check if it's...

389
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:22,045
- What? What are you looking at?
- The man I just married.

390
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:28,645
The first time I even suspected anything
was when I found myself packing.

391
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:32,123
And then when you met me
at the station and kissed me.

392
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,158
It was that kiss that convinced you.

393
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,721
I kinda figured that'd do the trick.

394
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:40,726
And if you don't mind,
I'd like to be convinced all over again.

I'm sorry about the rice.

409

It was kinda embarrassing, though.

410
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:05,000
I had a feeling people were staring at us.

411
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:07,242
- Nonsense.
- No. Here.

412

that gave me my first job.

This is Helen.
You remember Gene Krupa from the show.

419
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:55,126
Here's Babe Russin, the tenor saxophone.

420

You remember Chummy.
There's Polly and Don.

421
00:31:57,807 --> 00:32:00,241
We decided to celebrate.
We're gonna have a party.

- Here?
- No, Harlem. Connie's Inn.

Oh. Well, that's awful nice of you.

424
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:08,003
Helen just arrived.
We've had the wedding and the show

425
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:10,436
- and Helen's a little tired.
- I'm not.

426
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:12,603
You've been on the train for three days.

427
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:16,686
If your friends are nice enough
to give us a party, we should go!

428
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,878

- Dr Schillinger!

454
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:54,999
- Very pleased to meet you.
- You remember Chummy.

455
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:59,120
I missed you but I can see
you had a very charming distraction.

456
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:01,840
Yeah, well, glad to see you, Doctor.

457
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:05,436
- Who's Dr Schillinger? Were you sick?
- No, he's a musician.

458
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:08,843
He worked out a new method
of composition. I studied with him.

459
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:12,675
- Why did you stop?
- I got busy and it was expensive.

460
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:14,763
Want something else to eat?

461
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:19,555
- Maybe we'd better call it a day.
- No, I'm having a...

462
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:22,758
- No, I really had a wonderful time.
- Yes, dear.

00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:25,082
- Bye.
- Good night.

Helen?

470
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:19,799
Helen?

471
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:25,562
- Good morning.
- Honey, what are you doing up at this hour?

472
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:28,405
This hour? I've been up since seven.

Well, come here.

- Good morning.
- Good morning.

475
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:44,400
7:00? It must be dark outside.

476
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:48,520
No, it is not.
I've been getting up at this hour all of my life.

But you haven't been staying up
until 4:00 in the morning.

00:39:52,087 --> 00:39:54,647
Well, no, that's true.
Only when you were around.

00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:58,646
That's right.
Your father on the porch with his shotgun.

- What have you been doing?
- The ironing.

481
00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:11,117
The ironing? Honey, this is a hotel.

482
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:14,682
All you have to do is pick up the phone.
They have people to do that.

483
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:17,082
- But did you see what they charge?
- No.

484
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:19,163
- It's just terrible.
- Is that so?

485
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:22,005
I don't think we should
waste our money like that.

486
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:25,722
- Nobody can say I married a spendthrift.
- No, sir.

487
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:28,076
I'm a penny-pinching miser.

488
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:35,885
I'm the kind of wife that steals money
out of your pockets and puts it in the bank.

489
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:39,715
- Would you really do that?
- Sure. I've already started.

- Hi.

493
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:19,365
It's a long movie. We have
two hours before the next stage show.

494
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:22,558
- Have a good time?
- I like the show. But the music!

495
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,802
Well, you know the music.

496
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:29,079
- That isn't the way you want to play, is it?
- No, but I like pit work.

497
00:41:29,127 --> 00:41:32,085
It pays well. You get to stay in one place.

498
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:36,439
Glenn, I've been thinking.
How much does that Dr Schillinger charge?

499
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:39,285
He's pretty expensive. I don't know exactly.

500
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:41,318
I haven't worked with him for years.

501
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:44,120
That's just exactly what I mean. Why not?

502
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:45,998
I don't know. I...

503
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:49,323
What happened to that dream of yours?
What about that sound?

504
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:51,835
Well, I've been working on that, Helen.

505
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:55,596
It's an uphill grind.
My chance will come one of these days.

506
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,522
To tell you the truth, Glenn,
I've been sort of disappointed.

507
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:05,397
You mean that?

508
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:14,363
If I started to study again,
we'd have to make all sorts of sacrifices.

509
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,443
I'd have to give up those record dates.

510
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:20,882
Darling, I don't want to live in a fancy hotel.

511
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:24,078
We could get an awfully cute
little apartment.

512
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,641
I just want you to keep on trying.

513
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,838
I've sort of let you down, haven't I?

514
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:35,919
A little.

515
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:39,878
I'm sorry, Helen.

516
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:46,724
You're right. I should start to study again. I...

517
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:50,362
Why don't I call Schillinger right now?
See if he'll take me back.

518
00:42:50,407 --> 00:42:52,318
I have his phone number here...

for Schillinger. I hope he likes it.

Does that mean you won't be able to use it?

530
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:44,160
No, that doesn't make any difference.
It's not that good, though.

00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:45,799
I think it is.

- No.

Well, it should be soft and romantic.
Sort of like moonlight.

Moonlight. Young lover
under his sweetheart's window.

You wouldn't be thinking
of a certain night in Boulder?

539

There wasn't any moonlight. Just a shotgun!

I know. And you didn't serenade me either.

Serenade. There's a title.

- Serenade in the Moonlight.

not a hootchy-kootchy dance!

So do you! If you had your own band,
this sort of thing wouldn't happen.

no food but plenty of manuscript paper.

Has the business manager
given you the big financial statement yet?

No, but I will. We left New York
with $42 in the bank.

598

After six months,
we've paid for the truck and the car.

In short, we're making exactly $1 a month.

So in ten years we'll have made $120.

The next six dates we die.

606
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:13,724
We don't seem to be getting anywhere,
and we don't deserve to!

607
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:17,965
I just haven't been able to hit
the right combination.

608
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:21,886
I just still haven't got that sound.

609
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:25,604
Glenn, maybe if you stop playing.

610
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:29,201
- Touché!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

611
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:32,717
I know what you mean.
Get a baton and start leading. No.

612
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:36,442
Once you step out in front of the boys,
you can never be a sideman again.

613
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:38,478
I'll stick to my trombone.

614
00:49:38,527 --> 00:49:40,643
I've got some good news for a change.

615
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:44,726
I talked to Si Schribman.
He runs the State Ballroom in Boston.

616
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:46,883
He's booked you in
for the week of the 22nd.

617
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:49,760
That means six half-hour air spots.
That's what counts.

618
00:49:49,807 --> 00:49:53,766
- It sure does!
- Imagine! A whole week in one town.

619
00:49:53,807 --> 00:49:56,401
I could even get the washing
and the mending done.

620
00:49:56,447 --> 00:49:59,484
- Let's all drink to Boston!
- I think we should.

621
00:49:59,527 --> 00:50:01,438
Good ol' Boston.

622
00:50:07,887 --> 00:50:11,084
Glenn, why don't you ever use
Moonlight Serenade?

623
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:14,403
Don't we have enough trouble
without resurrecting that?

624
00:50:14,447 --> 00:50:17,120
- Well, I liked it.
- So did I.

625
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:20,159
That's two of us.
Now, if we can just find a third.

626
00:50:28,807 --> 00:50:32,322
- How's she look?
- Could be worse. Don't know how.

627
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:34,961
You need a new axle housing,
an axle shaft,

628
00:50:35,007 --> 00:50:37,840
ring gear and pinion,
differential gear case.

629
00:50:37,887 --> 00:50:41,118
- How long'll it take?
- A few days once I get the parts.

630
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:45,240
- You don't have 'em here?
- Don't have many calls for ring gears.

631
00:50:45,287 --> 00:50:49,075
Might have to go to Woodstock
soon as it stops snowing.

632
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:51,038
- It could be worse.
- Yeah.

633
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:54,315
There's Helen.
Get a hold of Schribman?

634
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:58,280
No, I couldn't get Boston.
The telephone lines are down.

635
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:01,160
Chummy, you and Helen
better try and make Boston.

636
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:03,596
Tell Schribman we'll be there
as soon as we can.

637
00:51:03,647 --> 00:51:06,525
He's probably guessed what happened.

638
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:10,037
- He wouldn't cancel on us.
- No, we'll get there all right.

639
00:51:10,087 --> 00:51:13,204
We can't lose that week in Boston.
Go ahead. Bye, dear.

640
00:51:13,247 --> 00:51:15,124
- Take care.
- Yeah.

641
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:31,403
- You Mr Miller?
- Yeah.

642
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:35,520
Man left a message. Your wife's sick.
They got her to the hospital.

643
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,956
- What hospital?
- Boston Memorial.

644
00:51:42,327 --> 00:51:44,283
Mr Miller, she's a very sick girl.

645
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:47,842
We gave her a transfusion
but we're lucky this happened when it did.

646
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:51,880
A few months further along and we might've
lost the mother as well as the child.

647
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:53,997
I had no idea that she was...

648
00:51:54,047 --> 00:51:56,083
- All right, Doctor.
- Thank you.

649
00:51:56,127 --> 00:51:58,118
Just for a minute.

650
00:52:12,847 --> 00:52:14,917
Helen.

651
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:21,238
The truck all right?

652
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:31,315
Five and a quarter, cash on the barrel head.
Take it or leave it, boys.

653
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,358
Better than the others.

654
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,602
I guess we'll have to take it.

655
00:52:35,647 --> 00:52:39,401
Kinda leaves us in a spot.
It's $900 to pay the boys in the band.

656
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,438
With my car? How much'll you give us?

657
00:52:41,487 --> 00:52:44,445
- You're not gonna do it.
- I can sell my own car if I want to.

658
00:52:44,487 --> 00:52:48,526
Four hundred. That makes
nine and a quarter for all three of 'em.

659
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:52,560
- This isn't your problem.
- Why isn't it? I wanna get paid off, too.

660
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,723
You got a deal. Just one condition.

661
00:52:54,767 --> 00:52:57,759
I need the car long enough
to drive the boys to the station.

662
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,399
Yes, that can be arranged.

663
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:02,359
Fellas, pile in. I'll drive you to the station.

664
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:04,398
Thank you, Chummy.

665
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:11,760
- Hi, dear. How do you feel?
- Fine.

666
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,241
- You look much better.
- Good.

667
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:17,279
The doctor said if I behave myself,
I'll be up in a few days.

668
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,079
Good.

669
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:22,005
I've made up my mind
about something, young lady.

670
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,845
If I ever go on the road again,

671
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:29,199
you're gonna stay in that nice apartment
of ours on East 57th Street.

672
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,283
You just listen to me, Glenn Miller.

673
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:34,319
You enticed a little country girl
to run away and marry you

674
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:36,005
and now you're hooked with her.

675
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:39,801
And I'm not gonna let you go
gallivanting around the country without me.

676
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:43,044
You're hooked with
a no-good itinerant musician.

677
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:47,000
- I'm not complaining.
- I know. You never do.

678
00:53:47,047 --> 00:53:50,676
But I know how you wanted kids.

679
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,844
I want to tell you something else
I've made up my mind about.

680
00:53:53,887 --> 00:53:56,959
We're not gonna have just one child.
We're gonna have two!

681
00:53:57,007 --> 00:53:58,998
We're gonna have a boy and a girl.

682
00:53:59,047 --> 00:54:00,719
- Glenn, I can't.
- I know.

683
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:03,076
The doctor told me, but I mean it.

684
00:54:03,127 --> 00:54:07,917
There'll be two kids meant for us.
Somewhere we're gonna find them.

685
00:54:10,487 --> 00:54:12,682
I hope so.

686
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:18,957
Who sent these flowers?

687
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,202
- The boys in the band.
- Wasn't that nice?

688
00:54:21,247 --> 00:54:23,158
They're sweet.

689
00:54:25,047 --> 00:54:26,924
What's happened? Any dates?

690
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:30,477
No. No dates.

691
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:33,718
There's no band.

692
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:36,327
We had to sell the cars
and pay off the boys.

693
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:40,155
Chummy had to sell his Phaeton.
Isn't that a shame?

694
00:54:40,207 --> 00:54:42,721
Poor Chummy really loved that car.

695
00:54:45,727 --> 00:54:48,799
Glenn, you had a good band.

696
00:54:48,847 --> 00:54:52,078
It was getting better all the time.
It wasn't your fault.

697
00:54:52,127 --> 00:54:54,357
It's my fault all right!

698
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:57,205
I'm broke, I'm in debt,
I don't even have a job.

699
00:54:57,247 --> 00:55:02,037
I told you before, you've gotten mixed up
with a no-good itinerant musician.

700
00:55:02,087 --> 00:55:05,602
- And I love him.
- And I love you.

701
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:11,278
It's almost worth it.

702
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:15,798
It's the first time you've told me that
since the day we were married.

703
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:29,923
Come in.

704
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:34,046
- Mrs Miller?
- Yes.

705
00:55:34,087 --> 00:55:36,601
I thought so. I can come in?

706
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:38,558
Well, yes, of course.

707
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:43,316
I brought you some flowers.

708
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:46,325
Oh. Well, thank you very much.

709
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:53,200
- They're all right?
- They're lovely.

710
00:55:53,247 --> 00:55:57,081
I'm a bachelor, I got no wife
to tell me these things.

711
00:55:57,127 --> 00:55:59,925
- Well, they're very pretty.
- Yeah.

712
00:55:59,967 --> 00:56:02,959
I heard all about the band
and how you were sick.

713
00:56:03,007 --> 00:56:05,965
Such a shame. I can sit down a minute?

714
00:56:06,607 --> 00:56:08,359
Yes, please.

715
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,835
"Compliments of the State Ballroom."

716
00:56:13,007 --> 00:56:16,682
- Is this a joke?
- I shoulda said so right away.

717
00:56:16,727 --> 00:56:19,195
No, that's me. Si Schribman.

718
00:56:19,247 --> 00:56:21,886
Si Schribman!
If I'd known who you were...

719
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:25,476
I know. Don Haynes said you wanted
to give me a piece of your mind.

720
00:56:25,527 --> 00:56:27,438
That's why I came here.

721
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,876
Maybe we can exchange pieces of mind.

722
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:35,239
I'm not really such an ogre.
I didn't like cancelling you out.

723
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:38,962
But an old widow lady, 75,
she owns that ballroom.

724
00:56:39,007 --> 00:56:41,237
If I don't have a band, I don't pay the rent.

725
00:56:41,287 --> 00:56:44,643
If I don't pay the rent,
that old lady don't eat.

726
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:46,678
It's a bad situation.

727
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:52,118
If she would only die, God forbid,
then I could run it like I like.

728
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:54,840
- It finished us. You know that.
- Yeah.

729
00:56:54,887 --> 00:56:57,560
- We had to break up the band.
- I know.

730
00:56:57,607 --> 00:56:59,882
I heard the band. It was good.

731
00:56:59,927 --> 00:57:02,680
Not great, mind you, but good, very good.

732
00:57:02,727 --> 00:57:07,847
We were just getting started.
Well, now I don't know what we'll do.

733
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:12,722
Just don't you worry, young lady.
Get well, and don't worry about the band.

734
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:15,365
That's easy to say.

735
00:57:15,407 --> 00:57:18,205
I believe in Glenn
and I believe what he's trying to do,

736
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:20,158
so naturally I worry.

737
00:57:20,927 --> 00:57:24,203
I tell you, you send him over,
he should see me.

738
00:57:24,247 --> 00:57:26,807
With my own money
that don't go to the widow,

739
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:30,362
- I sometimes invest in bands.
- Do you mean that?

740
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:33,604
Would I make myself
so much trouble if I didn't?

741
00:57:34,487 --> 00:57:37,479
But there's a problem. I know Glenn.

742
00:57:37,527 --> 00:57:40,360
He's down right now
and he won't accept help.

743
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:43,240
I don't think he'd risk
somebody else's money.

744
00:57:43,287 --> 00:57:45,960
I never even met your husband
and I like him already.

745
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:48,840
You just leave it to me.
I'll cook up something.

746
00:57:48,887 --> 00:57:51,162
Thank you very much for coming.

747
00:57:51,207 --> 00:57:53,357
And I'm sorry I was so ungracious.

748
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:58,162
Who was ungracious? We got along fine
exchanging pieces of mind.

749
00:57:58,207 --> 00:58:00,277
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

750
00:58:05,487 --> 00:58:08,638
I know you don't want a band but I'm stuck.

751
00:58:08,687 --> 00:58:12,646
But this Charley Firman sneaks a band
right out from under my nose.

752
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:16,999
- I don't have any men. No money.
- I'll give you the money. Here.

753
00:58:17,047 --> 00:58:20,926
Five hundred. Six hundred. A thousand.

754

There. You got the money.
Now, go get the men.

755
00:58:24,007 --> 00:58:29,127
I've tried all sorts of combinations.
I never found out what I was looking for.

756
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:33,399
If I start again, I've got to have
an entirely different kind of a band.

757
00:58:33,447 --> 00:58:36,280
Different tunes.
I wanna try something radical.

758
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:39,603
Fine. Go get radical, but just get going!

759
00:58:39,647 --> 00:58:43,925
I gotta have something in here
making a noise the kids can dance to.

760
00:58:48,047 --> 00:58:49,275
OK.

761
00:58:52,807 --> 00:58:56,686
- Let's have the five saxes right in there.
- Five saxes?

762
00:58:56,727 --> 00:58:59,195
And the trombones over there.

763
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:01,761
And the four trumpets right behind them.

764
00:59:01,807 --> 00:59:03,957
Four trombones and four trumpets!

765
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,601
When they play,
what's gonna hold the roof on?

766

Five saxes and a trumpet lead.

767
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:11,645
Maybe it's good and maybe it ain't,
but it's radical.

but if we could've worked on it...

- Not with Joe's range.

the day before you open.

Postpone the opening?

- Poor old widow lady.
- We're not gonna postpone anything.

789

We'll open tomorrow if I have to stay up
all night and rewrite the arrangement.

- Oh, yes.

- That's pretty good. Let's try that again.
- All right.

907
01:16:09,407 --> 01:16:11,967
I think I better go back to the trombone.

908
01:16:15,007 --> 01:16:16,918
You sit down there.

909
01:16:29,847 --> 01:16:31,280
All right, you.

910
01:16:31,327 --> 01:16:34,717
- (Ringing)
- Pennsylvania 6-5-0-0-0!

911
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,686
I'm kinda glad you called me that night.

912
01:17:20,727 --> 01:17:23,799
So am I.
All right, let's have something to eat.

913
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:26,122
Come on. Come on, dear.

914
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:28,840
- We're cutting a record of that.
- A record?

915
01:17:28,887 --> 01:17:30,525
- Three cents?
- Right.

916
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:32,125
That's my boy!

917
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:36,836
You oughta use that number in your picture.

918
01:17:36,887 --> 01:17:38,206
Picture?

919
01:17:38,247 --> 01:17:41,080
Glenn and the boys
are gonna do a movie in the fall.

920
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:43,516
- Are you gonna be a movie star?
- Yes, Mother.

921
01:17:43,567 --> 01:17:47,879
I'm gonna play Tarzan and
swing from the trees playing my trombone.

922
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:50,398
I'd like to propose a toast.

923
01:17:50,447 --> 01:17:53,120
To Glenn and Helen,
who serve the best food in town.

924
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:57,445
Besides, the price is right.
We can remember when it wasn't like this.

925
01:17:57,487 --> 01:18:01,526
May you be as happy together always
as you are tonight.

926
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:08,041
Thank you, Chummy.
That was a very nice speech.

927
01:18:08,687 --> 01:18:10,643
It oughta be, I worked on it all day!

928
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,803
- You did?
- (Laughter)

929
01:18:12,847 --> 01:18:18,683
I thought your special number was gonna be
Helen's favourite, Little Brown Jug.

930
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,319
He'd never do that. He hates it.

931
01:18:21,327 --> 01:18:24,399
I knew this would come up sooner or later.

932
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:27,120
So I have an anniversary present
for my good wife

933
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:29,123
and on the card it says,

934
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:31,840
"Ha-ha-ha, you and me

935
01:18:31,887 --> 01:18:34,447
"We hardly ever disagree

936
01:18:34,487 --> 01:18:37,399
"So here you are, this will be

937
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:40,757
"The one brown jug you'll get from me."

938
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:48,639
- Roll 'em for a take.
- M3-45, take one.

939
01:18:49,647 --> 01:18:51,399
Here we go.

940
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:55,563
One, two, three, four.

941
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:57,723
(# Tuxedo Junction)

942
01:21:21,367 --> 01:21:23,358
All right. Save it.

943
01:21:29,407 --> 01:21:31,637
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, Helen.

944
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:33,598
Well, hi, dear.

945
01:21:33,647 --> 01:21:35,956
- I thought you'd like lunch.
- I sure would.

946
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:37,804
I brought the mail.

947
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:49,160
Chummy, we still have a little time.
Why don't you go over At Last?

948
01:21:49,207 --> 01:21:51,118
Let's go up to the control booth.

949
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:53,362
- Anything wrong?
- No, no.

950
01:21:56,847 --> 01:21:58,758
Come on, sit down, honey.

951
01:21:58,807 --> 01:22:01,879
Helen, I wanted to talk to you about...

952
01:22:01,927 --> 01:22:05,806
With this picture deal
and the record sales and everything,

953
01:22:05,847 --> 01:22:08,361
- we're pretty well fixed.
- Yes.

954
01:22:08,407 --> 01:22:12,116
And, no matter what happens,
you and the kids,

955
01:22:12,167 --> 01:22:15,443
- you're in good shape.
- Yes, I know.

956
01:22:15,487 --> 01:22:17,637
Can you come to Men's Wardrobe at two?

957
01:22:17,687 --> 01:22:19,803
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

958
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:22,281
So, I thought that...

959
01:22:23,207 --> 01:22:25,926
What I'm trying to get at...

960
01:22:25,967 --> 01:22:27,958
I've been thinking... Yeah?

961
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:30,805
On Tuxedo Junction,
we'll have a wax right after lunch.

962
01:22:30,847 --> 01:22:32,883
Fine. Thanks very much.

963
01:22:33,887 --> 01:22:37,846
- So...
- Open the letter from the War Department.

964
01:22:37,887 --> 01:22:41,562
- I'm sure it's your commission.
- How do you know?

965
01:22:41,607 --> 01:22:45,600
I've known it for months.
I knew it was only a question of time.

966
01:22:45,647 --> 01:22:50,277
I just put in for it two weeks ago.
I guess you found out about it before I did.

967
01:22:50,327 --> 01:22:53,399
Go on, open it.
I want to know what to call you.

968
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:55,358
Let's see.

969
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:00,603
This is it all right.

970
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:03,844
Captain. Captain Alton G Miller.

971
01:23:03,887 --> 01:23:08,039
Serial number 0-4-5-0-5-2-7-3.

972
01:23:09,927 --> 01:23:12,964
How soon will you be leaving,
Captain Miller?

973
01:23:13,527 --> 01:23:15,882
I don't know. It usually takes about a month.

974
01:23:15,927 --> 01:23:18,395
Don wants to go with me,
so do some of the boys.

975
01:23:18,447 --> 01:23:21,439
- Are you gonna have your own band?
- I hope so.

976
01:23:21,487 --> 01:23:25,685
You know, all the kids
that liked our music are in the service.

977
01:23:25,727 --> 01:23:28,241
- That's the reason I...
- I understand.

978
01:23:28,287 --> 01:23:30,881
I think you'll look very handsome in uniform.

979
01:23:30,927 --> 01:23:35,079
What do you think about it?
Are you upset?

980
01:23:35,127 --> 01:23:38,164
Of course I'm upset.
I don't want you to go

981
01:23:38,207 --> 01:23:42,041
but I guess I'd be
even more upset if you didn't.

982
01:23:45,247 --> 01:23:48,557
(# Marching music)

983
01:24:00,887 --> 01:24:04,562
- They sound good.
- Do we have to play this kind of music?

984
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:07,201
We've marched to this music
for a hundred years.

985
01:24:07,247 --> 01:24:10,922
- That's what I mean.
- We're not gonna change now, Captain.

986
01:25:11,327 --> 01:25:14,444
We gotta do better
than this for General Arnold.

(# Upbeat swing)

989
01:26:41,527 --> 01:26:43,358
In all my 27 years in the Army

990
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:47,082
I have never witnessed a more
flagrant breach of military decorum.

991
01:26:47,127 --> 01:26:50,915
- Sorry, Colonel.
- And walking through a reviewing column!

992
01:26:50,967 --> 01:26:53,845
- I had to get to the band, sir.
- Then playing blues!

993
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:58,165
You made a laughing stock of this entire
unit, and in front of General Arnold!

994
01:26:58,207 --> 01:27:00,926
- I had no such intentions.
- What was your intention?

995
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:04,198
Blasting out right in the General's face!

996
01:27:04,247 --> 01:27:06,442
The men seemed tired, sir.

997
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:09,763
- The men's condition is my responsibility.
- Yes, sir.

998
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:13,277
I must warn you that your conduct calls
for disciplinary action.

999
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:14,601
- Yes, sir.
- (Knock on door)

1000
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:16,524
Come in.

1001
01:27:16,567 --> 01:27:20,242
Just wanted to say goodbye,
we're due in Washington tonight.

1002
01:27:20,287 --> 01:27:22,562
General Arnold, it's been a pleasure.

1003
01:27:22,607 --> 01:27:25,599
- I'm sorry that...
- Aren't you Captain Glenn Miller?

1004
01:27:25,647 --> 01:27:28,798
- Yes, sir.
- I want to congratulate you on your band.

1005
01:27:28,847 --> 01:27:32,237
- Thank you, sir.
- Great morale builder.

1006
01:27:32,287 --> 01:27:35,518
The effect was astonishing!
Keep up the good work.

1007
01:27:35,567 --> 01:27:38,035
- Yes, sir.
- I like your music myself.

1008
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:39,884
Makes me think of home.

1009
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:42,361
My children play your records day and night.

1010
01:27:42,407 --> 01:27:45,160
- May I make a suggestion, sir?
- Certainly.

1011
01:27:45,207 --> 01:27:49,200
I'd like to suggest that I be given
the authority to form my own band.

1012
01:27:49,247 --> 01:27:50,805
Play my kind of music.

1013
01:27:50,847 --> 01:27:52,838
Most of my men are in the service.

1014
01:27:52,887 --> 01:27:57,119
If we can be sent overseas,
I know we can be of value.

1015
01:27:57,167 --> 01:28:00,955
As you say, I think we can give the boys
a piece of home.

1016
01:28:01,007 --> 01:28:04,044
I must say I agree with you, Miller.

1017
01:28:04,087 --> 01:28:06,806
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you, sir.

1018
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,958
Glenn!

1019
01:28:22,247 --> 01:28:24,397
Well, gee, I didn't expect this!

1020
01:28:24,447 --> 01:28:26,438
General Arnold brought us.

1021
01:28:26,487 --> 01:28:30,036
General, thank you.
I appreciate everything you've done.

1022
01:28:30,087 --> 01:28:33,966
A pleasure. I'll probably get court-martialled
but I brought 'em anyway.

1023
01:28:34,007 --> 01:28:35,679
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1024
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:38,002
- Goodbye and thank you.
- I enjoyed it.

1025
01:28:38,047 --> 01:28:40,163
- Goodbye, General.
- Goodbye.

1026
01:28:40,207 --> 01:28:42,437
Well, Jonnie Dee.

You got a hug for your daddy?
Got a hug for your daddy?

1028
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,684
That's a girl!

1029
01:28:47,727 --> 01:28:50,799
How about you, young man?
How about you?

1030
01:28:50,847 --> 01:28:53,441
- Can I fly in your airplane?
- I'm afraid not.

1031
01:28:53,487 --> 01:28:55,876
You have to stay
and take care of your mother.

1032

You be good
and don't cause him any trouble.

1033
01:28:58,487 --> 01:29:02,116
- I'll try not to. You take care of yourself.
- Don't worry.

1034
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:05,239
You show 'em a picture of me
every once in a while.

1035
01:29:05,287 --> 01:29:08,199
I promise. And I'll read them your letters,
if you write.

1036
01:29:08,247 --> 01:29:09,999
I'm gonna write.

1037
01:29:10,047 --> 01:29:13,244
Gee, I'm gettin' homesick already.

1038

It's funny how you can miss a person
even before he's gone.

1039

Hurry it up, Glenn.

that same airplane. A big surprise, boys.

1060
01:34:36,047 --> 01:34:38,117
Here's a girl you all know.

1061

She's flown across the ocean
just to sing for you.

Let's give her a good, big ETO welcome.
Frances Langford!

1063
01:34:49,207 --> 01:34:50,799
Hi, Frances.

1064
01:34:55,527 --> 01:34:57,438
- Thank you, Glenn.
- Thank you.

1065
01:34:57,487 --> 01:35:00,160
- That's from Helen.
- Bless your heart.

1066
01:35:02,327 --> 01:35:07,276
I'll start out by taking you on a trip
south of the Mason-Dixon line.

1067

Let's all get aboard
that old Chattanooga Choo Choo.

# Step aside, partner, it's my day

# Pardon me, boy,

1073
01:36:27,607 --> 01:36:29,040
# Yes, yes

# Boy, you can give me a shine

1076

# I can afford
to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo

1077
01:36:40,607 --> 01:36:42,165
# Yes, yes

1078

# I've got my fare

1079
01:36:44,967 --> 01:36:47,800
# And just a trifle to spare

1080

I wrote Glenn what you asked.

1103
01:39:40,887 --> 01:39:44,118
I want to read you his answer. He says...

1104
01:39:44,167 --> 01:39:46,237
"Tell Chummy not to take the job.

1105

"As long as there's a Glenn Miller Band,

"so tell Chummy to start looking
for a friendly pawn shop."

1109
01:39:58,647 --> 01:40:02,401
Friendly pawn shop.
He hasn't changed, has he?

1110
01:40:02,447 --> 01:40:06,201
Yes, he has! He's been promoted.
He's Major Glenn Miller now.

1111
01:40:06,247 --> 01:40:10,320
Major? That's wonderful.
I wish I could've gone with him.

You'd have made a fine soldier
with your heart and ulcers!

1113
01:40:14,527 --> 01:40:18,315
I've got two eyes and ten fingers.
That's all you need to play the piano.

1114
01:40:19,807 --> 01:40:22,321
They're going to Paris. I told you that.

1115
01:40:22,367 --> 01:40:26,076
And he says, "We're doing
a special programme on Christmas Day."

1116
01:40:26,127 --> 01:40:28,083
It's gonna be broadcast over here.

"Be sure and listen cos I'm sending you
an extra special Christmas present."

01:40:32,687 --> 01:40:35,599
And I'll know what it is
if I listen to the programme.

1119
01:40:35,647 --> 01:40:39,959
- I wonder what he's gonna do.
- I don't know. But I'm sure gonna listen.

1120
01:40:59,687 --> 01:41:01,837
- Morning, Glenn.
- Morning, Colonel.

1121
01:41:01,887 --> 01:41:04,321
- I sure appreciate the lift.
- Not at all.

1122
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:06,358
- You coming too?
- No. Tomorrow.

1123

at the advance bases.

1125
01:41:12,007 --> 01:41:14,043
It's kinda soupy, isn't it?

1126
01:41:14,087 --> 01:41:17,363
It's always this way in December.
Shall we hop in?

1127
01:41:18,367 --> 01:41:21,996
Don, I don't know where I'll be,
so as soon as you land at Orly,

1128
01:41:22,047 --> 01:41:24,117
get in touch with the dispatcher.

1129
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:26,635
Be sure the band goes over
that new arrangement.

1130
01:41:26,687 --> 01:41:29,679
- I want to use it.
- Right. See you tomorrow.

Pick up my mail.
I'm expecting a letter from Helen. Bye.

All right, hurry it up, you guys.

1133

This is Paris. You wanted to see it.
Now's your chance.

1134
01:42:16,847 --> 01:42:21,443
I'm Lieutenant Haynes. Did Major
Glenn Miller leave a message here for me?

1135
01:42:21,487 --> 01:42:24,160
Nothing here, sir.
Did you try Flight Control?

1136
01:42:24,207 --> 01:42:29,042
No, he said he'd leave it here. He came
with Colonel Baessell on the Norseman.

1137
01:42:32,087 --> 01:42:33,884
The flight wasn't logged in.

1138
01:42:33,927 --> 01:42:37,124
No Norseman has landed here
in two or three days.

1139
01:42:37,167 --> 01:42:38,805
Thanks.

1140
01:42:45,487 --> 01:42:49,162
- General! I thought you were in Europe.
- Just arrived.

1141
01:42:49,207 --> 01:42:52,483
- May I congratulate you on your promotion?
- Thank you.

01:42:58,247 --> 01:43:01,922
- Have you heard about Glenn Miller?
- Yes, this morning.

1145
01:43:01,967 --> 01:43:03,480
Notified his family yet?

1146
01:43:03,527 --> 01:43:07,042
We've been ordered to withhold notifications
until after Christmas.

1147
01:43:07,087 --> 01:43:11,797
His band is broadcasting tomorrow.
We can't let Mrs Miller find out that way.

1148
01:43:11,847 --> 01:43:15,203
- Do you mind if I call her personally?
- Of course not.

1149
01:43:15,247 --> 01:43:17,317
- Use my telephone.
- Thank you.

1150
01:43:24,167 --> 01:43:28,206
It's still a couple of minutes
before the broadcast, Helen.

1151
01:43:28,247 --> 01:43:32,160
You know, I never realised
how wonderful friends could be.

1152
01:43:32,207 --> 01:43:35,040
Even General Arnold, he called me himself.

1153
01:43:35,087 --> 01:43:39,319
That's why he's where he is, maybe,
because he's that kind of a guy.

1154
01:43:52,247 --> 01:43:55,125
Last night when I couldn't sleep,
I got to thinking.

1155
01:43:55,167 --> 01:43:57,078
It come to me about this broadcast.

1156
01:43:57,127 --> 01:43:59,960
You know, Helen, this is a test.

1157
01:44:00,727 --> 01:44:02,877
A test? How do you mean?

1158
01:44:02,927 --> 01:44:06,636
You remember how much we talked,
all of us,

1159
01:44:06,687 --> 01:44:11,078
about how Glenn's band
was something different?

1160
01:44:11,127 --> 01:44:14,881
Something permanent? An institution, like!

1161
01:44:16,367 --> 01:44:19,279
Yeah, Glenn and I talked about it often.

1162
01:44:19,327 --> 01:44:21,477
Don't you see what Si's getting at?

1163
01:44:21,527 --> 01:44:24,724
If the band goes on,
even if Glenn's not with it,

1164
01:44:24,767 --> 01:44:26,325
that's the proof.

1165
01:44:26,367 --> 01:44:30,326
It means that Glenn's band,
Glenn's music, keeps right on going,

1166
01:44:30,367 --> 01:44:34,838
and the kids'll be dancing to it
for years and years.

1167
01:44:34,887 --> 01:44:36,639
