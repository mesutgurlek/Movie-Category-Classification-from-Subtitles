"...once again for those

waiting when to know..."

00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:16,510

00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:27,524
"We pull off of the shade of
the veil from your eyes..."

10
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:39,198
"We lay on our stomachs,
tossing and turning."

11
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:42,540

00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:18,247
"...we keep awake..."

00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:27,256
"...in cold white
sheets until late."

16
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:38,598
"We kept staring at the
stars lying on terraces..."

17
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:41,761
"This heart lays in search..."

18
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:49,437
"...once again for those

19
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,284
Hello Sir.
- Hello.

20
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:06,294
This is Mr. Chawla, our biggest
distributor in eastern India.

21
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,294
How do you do sir?
Dr. Kamal Bose.

22
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,627
How do you do?

23
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,462
I know you well
by your medicines.

24
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:14,502
That is why I am infamous.

25
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:18,806
In fact all my doctor
friends prescribe your medicines.

26
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:21,968
Nowadays your name
dominates the market. - Okay.

27
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:25,479
Mr. Chawla, isn't your
head office in Calcutta?

28
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,311
Yes. I had come here only to
arrange this cottage for you.

29
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,318
Mr. Bali had called.

30
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,910
Didn't Mr. Bali
mention over the phone that...

31
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,488
...during these holidays
I do not wish to hear...

32
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:34,647
...even the names of medicines?

33
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:36,315
I want a
complete rest from work.

34
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:37,916
Physical as well as mental.

35
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,860
Neither do I want to tell
anything about them, nor hear.

36
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:48,329
Whose cottage is this?

37
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:50,838
Dinshaw Irani's. A Parsi
medicine man of Calcutta...

38
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,840
...who is now settled in Bombay.

39
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,534
He has maintained
his house beautifully.

40
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,409
Yes, that is the
uniqueness of the Parsis.

41
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:01,347
Even if hundreds of years pass
by, their wallpapers don't spoil.

42
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,354
Greetings, sir... Greetings.

43
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,689
I have heard you are very
fond of eating and drinking.

44
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:15,025
So I have arranged this cook
for you. He cooks very well.

45
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:29,707
The twin pills of
Gill's medicines.

46
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,778
You can have them with
either water or milk.

47
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:35,544
They provide relief from
cold and cough immediately.

48
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,921
These medicines do
not leave me here also.

49
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:42,456
They are medicines
discovered by you, Dr. Gill.

50
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:47,559
Yes, where am I refusing that?
My deeds are chasing me.

51
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,722
They don't leave me at all.

52
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:00,399
Beautiful!

53
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,569
Is this the first time you
have come to Darjeeling?

54
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:07,572
No, I have come once
before also. Many years ago.

55
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:12,746
About 25 years ago. Before I
gave my doctor's examination.

56
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,753
Then I had an accident.

57
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:20,591
Accident? - Yes! I had
fallen in love with a girl.

58
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:26,424
Oh! That happens in youth, doctor
I also had them. - With her?

59
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,936
Yes. I mean, no. It was on
the hill station and now...

60
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,836
...I am the father
of her three kids.

61
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,102
No, man, I did not do
anything like that with her.

62
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,941
That is why you were saved
and I had to get married.

63
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,518
Listen.
- Yes sir.

64
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,782
What is your name?
- Mangal Singh sir.

65
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,121
Mangal Singh sir?
- No sir, only Mangal Singh.

66
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:54,796
Tell someone to put the chairs
out. We shall sit there only.

67
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:59,129
Excuse me, Dr. Gill.
I'll take your leave now.

68
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,465
I have work in the hospital.
I'll meet in the evening.

69
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,129
Okay.
- Mr. Chawla?

70
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,639
Mr. Chawla, you too may leave.
No need for formalities.

71
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:08,073
I'll take some rest now.
We'll meet in the evening.

72
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,146
Bye for now. We'll
meet in the evening.

73
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:15,809
If you need me for anything,
here's my card. Come on.

74
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,998
Dhyan Singh...
- Yes sir?

75
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,500
Why are you throwing
cold water on the car...

76
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,833
...early in the morning? I am
feeling cold just by its sight.

77
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:37,098
Don't you feel anything?

78
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,834
It's better if I wash it now
only. If the master asks for it...

79
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,500
...as soon as he wakes up,
then what shall I do?

80
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:44,175
This is not
Calcutta; this is Darjeeling.

81
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,582
Dr. Gill has come
here on vacation.

82
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:48,707
He'll not wake up so soon.

83
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:50,513
Yes, this is the
condition since yesterday.

84
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,521
I myself was
waiting till 11 o'clock.

85
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,524
When will the
master have breakfast?

86
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,526
Today the master will
have a very heavy breakfast.

87
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,528
He has not eaten
anything since yesterday.

88
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,928
When will he have it?
- As soon as he wakes up.

89
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,601
Who will wake up?
- The master.

90
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:08,534
Early morning, the master...

91
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,869
Now this hill
station has changed a lot.

92
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:14,534
When I had come
here many years ago...

93
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,703
...there weren't
so many cars here.

94
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:19,608
There were only mostly
rickshaws plying here.

95
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:22,548
Now it is not even the season.
When the season comes...

96
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,552
...you shall see, there's
so much rush here that...

97
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,554
...people do not even get
adequate place to stay.

98
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,949
Then we could manage to get
lodging at someone's house...

99
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,551
...as a paying guest even.
I myself had stayed...

100
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:36,223
...at a contractor's place.
Mr... Mr. Jodhpal.

101
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,902
Do you know what the
rent of the room was?

102
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,561
Seven rupees.

103
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,570
But sir, now that
can be only dreamt of.

104
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,574
Right said! The whole
place looked different then.

105
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,080
See that wood shed there?
- Yes.

106
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,579
There used to be a
doctor's shop there.

107
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:00,781
When had you come here before?

108
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,755
It is many years now.

109
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,257
But we are seeing this shed
here like this since many years.

110
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:09,096
I am talking of a
time before that.

111
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,668
You must be mistaken.

112
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:16,602
No. I cannot be
mistaken about this place.

113
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:19,998
A little ahead from here,
there are those stairs, isn't it?

114
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:21,770
Those which descend
from the Upper Bazaar?

115
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:24,107
Yes.
- Then this is the same place.

116
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:27,114
But sir, there was
never a doctor's shop here.

117
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:28,945
We have always
seen this shed here.

118
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:31,611
You must be talking
of the doctor Thapa.

119
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:36,947
Yes, yes, he's the
one. Harihar Thapa.

120
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,957
It's ages since he died, sir.

121
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,961
But he was not that old.

122
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,125
Does it take time
to grow old, sir?

123
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:49,303
If there is sorrow,
man can age very quickly.

124
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:51,305
Which sorrow did he have?

125
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,967
The sorrow of a
daughter is very bad, sir.

126
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:58,240
He had a young girl. She
had a very pretty name...

127
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:03,185
Chanda? - Yes, Chanda. You
have a sharp memory, sir.

128
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,648
Then?
- She wouldn't marry. - Why?

129
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:10,651
She would tell some
doctor would come to take her.

130
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:16,155
Then?

131
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:20,167
Does anyone come back, sir?
She was humiliated in society.

132
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,999
We don't know who the man
who gave her sorrow was.

133
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,730
The doctor also stuck to
the bed in such a way...

134
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:29,675
...that he died on the bed
itself. Only before dying...

135
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,077
...he entrusted his daughter
to a lame stammering man.

136
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:35,683
Lame? Stammering?

137
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:38,754
Yes. He was staying
down in the Blue Valley.

138
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:41,682
A factory had opened
up there that time.

139
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,021
We had heard Chanda
also worked there.

140
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,195
When she returned home
upon her father's death...

141
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:50,231
...she had a child in her arms.
Her husband did not come.

142
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,096
Some tell he died;
some tell he left her.

143
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,395
Show that to me...
- Here.

144
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:29,396
Show me that one. - That
one's mine. - Show it please.

145
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:31,196
What happened? Did
you have a fall?

146
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:34,129
Yes. This...

147
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,872
Is it a sprain or an injury?

148
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,202
I do not know.
Perhaps it is a sprain.

149
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,799
There's a doctor here. Get
him to put an ointment on it.

150
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:44,379
It will be well in an instant.
- Is that so?

151
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,141
He is a very good doctor. Yes.

152
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,827
Did you bring the herbs?
Which all did you get?

153
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:04,359
I found some of them. And I
also found a patient, father.

154
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,161
He has a sprain in his
foot. He'll come now...

155
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:08,896
...to get an ointment put on it.

156
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:12,167
Those stairs in the bazaar.
He fell on them.

157
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,242
Did he fall by himself
or did you push him?

158
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,038
Why will I push him?

159
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,836
Who knows? You may be
helping your father's business.

160
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:23,116
Very good! If someone falls,
that means I have pushed him.

161
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,186
Don't know what he thinks of me!

162
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:40,197
Come, come, come. Did
you sprain your leg?

163
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:44,033
Yes. It seems like that.

164
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:50,273
It is the fault of the eyes,
and the legs have to suffer.

165
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:55,043
A foolish leader commits a
folly; the whole village pays.

166
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:59,045
Give me your foot.

167
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:05,054
So you slipped on
the bazaar steps?

168
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:08,559
It doesn't matter.
You are saved.

169
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:11,224
If you had been hit on the
head, that would be grave.

170
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,302
Chanda, bring the
herbal oil kept inside.

171
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:16,496
I'm warming and
bringing it, father.

172
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,573
Shall I bring the turmeric also.

173
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,232
Yes, bring that also.

174
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:23,067
Did you see? Before
the patient comes...

175
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:25,078
...the preparation of
the medicine has begun.

176
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,241
Do you know astrology also?

177
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,246
Yes, I know.

178
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:42,252
Okay! So that's how you
came to know about it.

179
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,992
Seen her? She's my astrologer.

180
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,931
She keeps herself updated
with the goings-on of the city.

181
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:50,437
From where have you come?
- From Calcutta.

182
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:55,104
What is your name?
- Amar Nath Gill.

183
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,473
What are you doing?
- Learning to be a doctor.

184
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,344
It is the last year so I
have come here for preparation.

185
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,113
"Whether you take
a prescription.".

186
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,120
"...or rely on drugs..."

187
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:09,222
"A man has to face the
consequences of his deeds."

188
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,292
"Whatever he does, the
doctor ends up getting richer."

189
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,292
If you do not have the
sole intent of earning money...

190
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:18,298
...then there is no occupation
better than this, Amar Nath.

191
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,164
Amar Nath what?
- Gill.

192
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,963
There is so much
pleasure in this job that...

193
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,973
...it cannot be expressed in
words. It is like worship.

194
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,305
That is why I am
learning to be a doctor.

195
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,702
So you'll open your
clinic in the city?

196
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:33,145
It won't work in the village.
- Why?

197
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:36,149
Who will buy such expensive
medicines here, Amar Nath?

198
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,978
Gill!

199
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,715
Yes, Gill. Here only
our herbs will work.

200
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,490
The virtues are
earned by the tree...

201
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,583
...while the peepal
tree has to sacrifice.

202
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,326
Where's a doctor like me
who can take care of all?

203
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,329
Once I have the knowledge, sir...

204
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,402
...I shall learn
the wisdom from you.

205
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:56,401
Where do you stay here?

206
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:59,664
That bungalow of the contractor
Jodhpal... I stay there only.

207
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,174
That is very near.

208
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,176
Father, the bandage.

209
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,181
Okay, so you stay in
Jodhpal's bungalow. - Yes.

210
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:13,220
Anyway that remains
vacant ten months in a year.

211
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:17,084
Where do you eat?

212
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,353
In a wayside restaurant.

213
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,760
How bad! Being a student, you
eat in a wayside restaurant?

214
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,358
How will you top
your class then?

215
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:33,097
No, no, no. From today
you'll eat with us. Okay Chanda?

216
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,372
Thank you. How much?

217
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:42,049
Let it be. First you become
all right, Amar Nath... - Gill.

218
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,451
I'll take the money later.
When you come to dine at night...

219
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,112
...l'll change the bandage.

220
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:50,391
Thank you. Good bye.

221
00:16:56,498 --> 00:17:01,060
Take care, take care. Take my
stick. Chanda, give my stick.

222
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,580
Bring in the evening
without fail. - Okay.

223
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:25,755
Father, the
sprained one hasn't come.

224
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:28,163
May I give his
share to the goat?

225
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:31,255
Why? Did you eat the
hay meant for the goat?

226
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:35,425
Am I an animal to eat
the fodder of animals?

227
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:37,437
Then why will you give
his share to the goat?

228
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,166
Does the goat
also have a sprain?

229
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:42,109
What is there
about a sprain in this?

230
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:48,615
Always doing charity.
You don't take money from...

231
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:52,448
...the villagers because they
are from the same village.

232
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:59,289
You found one foreigner, but
he too turned to be a student.

233
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,196
More than a student, he
has become something else.

234
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,129
How will it do if you
treat everyone for free?

235
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,129
You have to get me married
in the future. What then?

236
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:14,470
Don't get married.

237
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,210
Do you mean that? Can
you promise me that?

238
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:21,648
I can promise you but who
will bear this headache for...

239
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,809
...a lifetime?

240
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:27,484
Now you call me a headache.
But when I shall go...

241
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,157
...you shall not be able
to find anyone like me...

242
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,159
...who would find
your herbs for free.

243
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:35,496
Go yourself in the jungles then.

244
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:44,831
Listen Chanda, I'll do one
thing. I'll see Amar Nath myself.

245
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,170
He stays near here
in Jodhpal's bungalow.

246
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,506
No need. I am
going to Hansa's place.

247
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,340
I'll see him on the way.

248
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:56,513
Doesn't give any money; on top
of that, he's taken the stick.

249
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:15,364
You? Come. Come inside.

250
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,207
You did not come to eat.
Father was waiting.

251
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:29,546
I could not come. I have fever.
This foot is also swollen.

252
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,385
You did not eat anything?

253
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,550
I am not hungry. I
have warmed the milk.

254
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,218
I'll drink that only.

255
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:48,398
You sit. I'll bring
it. Where's the milk?

256
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,571
There in the kitchen.

257
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:15,592
Drink the milk and sleep
now. I'll tell father.

258
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,257
He'll come here and
change the bandage tomorrow.

259
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,598
Do you have a
thermometer at your place?

260
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:26,773
What?

261
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:29,276
A thermo...
- What is that?

262
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,281
It is a glass tube.

263
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:35,782
What is that?

264
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:42,279
Tube. A tube of glass.
It has mercury below it.

265
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,790
What below?

266
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:49,626
Mercury. Mercury. When
you put it in your mouth...

267
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:53,292
...you know the temperature.
I mean, fever.

268
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,306
What is there to laugh in that?

269
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:02,468
Do you need a tube
to tell about fever?

270
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:05,805
We can simply touch and
tell how much fever one has.

271
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,483
Touch me and tell
how much fever I have.

272
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:17,654
You have. But not much. Shall
I bring the medicine tomorrow?

273
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,886
What tablets, I mean
medicine do you have?

274
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:25,489
No tablets. I have some
flowers, which I shall...

275
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,659
...boil and make a brew.

276
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:32,001
You yourself are a good doctor.

277
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,337
Living with herbs
day and night, even...

278
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:36,502
...my goat has become
somewhat of a doctor.

279
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,406
Can't I become then?

280
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,347
You can be.

281
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,418
Shall I go?
- Yes, go.

282
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:46,948
Can I take this stick?

283
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,886
Let it be. I'll need it.

284
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,369
Father, have your breakfast.
- Keep it.

285
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:07,533
Take this pill
and this medicine.

286
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:11,708
What to do of that
man with the stick?

287
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,709
You only go. Give
him these medicines...

288
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:18,377
...and apply this ointment also.

289
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,448
Take your stick back
and get rid of him.

290
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,719
You'll have to only
give instead of taking.

291
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:27,385
He hasn't paid for
his first ailment...

292
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:28,895
...and has attracted
another on the contrary.

293
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:32,398
He'll give. Take
something to eat also.

294
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:35,402
Here.
- He's a student. A student.

295
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:37,062
They are the
future of the country.

296
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:38,605
Don't know when he'll be
the future of the country...

297
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,572
...but right now he is
affecting our future.

298
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:42,742
He has caught the
stick in such a way...

299
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,573
...he doesn't leave it at all.

300
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:58,417
Oh my God! Do you have
to study so many books...

301
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:01,826
...to become a doctor?

302
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:07,434
What else? This is
not village medicine...

303
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:10,437
...that a person can learn
sitting next to his goat.

304
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,936
Did you call my father a goat?

305
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:15,440
No, I called the goat
your father. I mean...

306
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:18,445
...you only had told yesterday
that if your father sat...

307
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,447
...next to the goat... sorry, the
goat sat next to your father...

308
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,608
...then it could learn also.

309
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:27,787
It is not that simple. 300.
No, I don't know how many...

310
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:33,623
...there are species of roots,
flowers and herbs.

311
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:36,524
You should be able to
recognise each leaf.

312
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:38,628
Only then can a
man give medicine.

313
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,458
It is not like this. Just
read a book and give medicine.

314
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:46,806
Why don't you treat yourself?
You too are a doctor.

315
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,466
I would have done it.
But the medicines I need...

316
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,547
...I do not get them here.

317
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,644
Then where do you get them?

318
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:56,544
There in Calcutta.

319
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:59,148
Then you should have
fallen there also.

320
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:00,482
Why did you fall here?

321
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:07,020
Do you not get any other stick?

322
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:09,564
No. I'll take this one only.

323
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,567
Father had bought
it for three rupees.

324
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,567
He had not got it from a tree.

325
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:27,507
Hello, Chanda.
- Come, come. - Greetings.

326
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:29,846
Greetings. I had
forgotten your gait.

327
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:31,578
I didn't see you so many days.

328
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:34,018
Actually I had
forgotten my gait.

329
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,850
Lay out the plates for him also.

330
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:42,529
Tell me, how is your health now.

331
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,858
I am all right now.
Also the temperature...

332
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:48,527
...the fever, that
is, has gone down.

333
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:55,266
Chanda! O Chanda! Come here.

334
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:59,546
Come here I say.

335
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,949
What is this? You did not
greet him? He is your guest.

336
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:06,714
Greetings!
- Greetings!

337
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:08,884
Eat.

338
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,559
How are studies going on?
- Okay.

339
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:17,962
Will you top?

340
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,567
I hope to.

341
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,635
How many patients
will you kill in a year?

342
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:25,638
Some... what?

343
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:31,570
What to worry of
those who have to go?

344
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,978
Creatures come and go. If
they are saved, it is due to...

345
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,913
...the Almighty's blessings.

346
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:38,076
If they die, it's
the doctor's doing.

347
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:42,582
Sir, along with wisdom,
you also teach me...

348
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:46,752
...how to make couplets. I'll
recite them when I operate.

349
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:49,930
Operation means the
cutting up of the body.

350
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:53,099
That's it. I do not like this
cutting up in your medicine.

351
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,600
Do you also do it?

352
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:56,933
It has to be done in surgery.

353
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:58,767
When has it to be done?

354
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:02,604
In surgery. Surgery.
There's no meaning of that.

355
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:07,113
Sir, nowadays technology in
surgery is fast developing.

356
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:09,775
Is that so? - Now we can
even transplant hearts.

357
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:13,111
Oh! We change hearts also, but
by instilling good thoughts.

358
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:14,950
What else?

359
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:19,624
Eat, eat. Did you not like it?

360
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,218
No, it is very nice.

361
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,695
Whatever little it is,
it is at least home-made.

362
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:26,699
Listen, as long as you are
here, you are our guest.

363
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:37,803
Give.

364
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,046
Why are you taking this stick?

365
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,640
I'll give you one. Silent!

366
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,824
She is after this
stick since ten days, sir.

367
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,722
She is not at all
concerned about my foot.

368
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:02,662
"This stick... this stick..."

369
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:04,830
"...has stuck around my neck."

370
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:07,169
"This stick... this stick..."

371
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:10,005
"...has stuck around my neck."

372
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:15,080
"Like shackles around the feet,
or sometimes like handcuffs."

373
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,013
"This stick... this stick..."

374
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:19,678
"...has stuck around my neck."

375
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,848
"This stick... this stick..."

376
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:24,686
"...has stuck around my neck."

377
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:48,876
"Give a turn to
the straight paths..."

378
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:59,890
"Give a turn to
the straight paths..."

379
00:27:59,994 --> 00:28:04,795
"...give some solace to
disinterested souls..."

380
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:09,734
"...this chain of
breath may not cease..."

381
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:13,740
"...this chain of
breath may not cease."

382
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,070
"This stick... this stick..."

383
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:19,237
"...has stuck around my neck."

384
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,074
"This stick... this stick..."

385
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,241
"...has stuck around my neck."

386
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,760
"This stick... this stick..."

387
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:36,160
"...has stuck around my neck."

388
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:38,928
"This stick... this stick..."

389
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:41,263
"...has stuck around my neck."

390
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,933
"Like shackles around the feet,
or sometimes like handcuffs."

391
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:48,836
"This stick... this stick..."

392
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:51,173
"...has stuck around my neck."

393
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,797
"This stick... this stick..."

394
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:16,132
"...has stuck around my neck."

395
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,802
"This stick... this stick..."

396
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,205
"...has stuck around my neck."

397
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:59,242
"It seems that some glass
is broken in my breath."

398
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:11,858
"It seems that some glass
is broken in my breath."

399
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,863
"Some strange pain
pierces the chest."

400
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:21,265
"I have tied this
fiery pain to my veil."

401
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:25,868
"I have tied this
fiery pain to my veil."

402
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,201
"This stick... this stick..."

403
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:30,869
"...has stuck around my neck."

404
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:33,207
"This stick... this stick..."

405
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:35,874
"...has stuck around my neck."

406
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:41,283
"Like shackles around the feet,
or sometimes like handcuffs."

407
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:43,050
"This stick... this stick..."

408
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:45,887
"...has stuck around my neck."

409
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,057
"This stick... this stick..."

410
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:50,392
"...has stuck around my neck."

411
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,896
"This stick... this stick..."

412
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,231
"...has stuck around my neck."

413
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,924
Good morning, sir.

414
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:22,990
Good morning.

415
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:25,429
Sorry, Dr. Gill, we
have entered your house...

416
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:29,526
...without your permission.
Mr. Mehta, dean of the...

417
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,434
...government hospital.
- How do you do?

418
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,939
Mr. E. Suratwalla, chief
surgeon. - How do you do?

419
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:36,602
And you already
know Dr. Kamal Bose.

420
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:37,939
Please sit down.

421
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:42,448
We have come here to invite
you for the opening of a clinic.

422
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:48,014
Well gentlemen,
thank you for the honour.

423
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:51,956
But I am here on a holiday. I
wish to spend these holidays...

424
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,620
...in absolute solitude.

425
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,356
We won't take
much time, Dr. Gill.

426
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:57,954
It is a very small function.

427
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:01,968
We are opening a clinic in
the Blue Valley. We wish that...

428
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,470
...you encourage the young
doctors who are leaving...

429
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:08,133
...the city and beginning their
careers in this faraway village.

430
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:13,479
Where are you
opening this clinic?

431
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:14,980
In the Blue Valley.

432
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,984
When?
- Next week, Friday.

433
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,058
Okay.
- Thank you.

434
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:28,153
You are welcome.
Bye doctor. Okay.

435
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:33,158
By the way, dean. Is
there a mill there...

436
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,497
...where clothes are made?

437
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:39,334
Yes there is one, a small one.
It is not very famous too.

438
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,998
The womenfolk of the
village work there.

439
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:46,172
There's a better mill at Siliguri
It makes better cloth too.

440
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:50,179
Okay. Anyway, I
shall reach at 11.

441
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:52,343
We shall come to pick you up.
- Okay, bye.

442
00:32:59,393 --> 00:33:01,190
The Blue Valley! (Nili Ghati)

443
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,261
Come, come.

444
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:51,405
I am looking for a
woman named Chanda.

445
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,239
She works with you perhaps.

446
00:33:54,448 --> 00:34:01,411
Chanda! Yes there is one.
She is an old lady.

447
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,250
Perhaps yes, she is the one.

448
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:06,223
You wait. I'll call her.

449
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:30,273
Come, come inside,
mother. No need to worry.

450
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:45,722
Is she the one?

451
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,199
No. Sorry,
mother, I troubled you.

452
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:51,630
Go mother. Do your work.

453
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:55,304
She must not have become so old.

454
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,138
You know her?

455
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:01,481
Yes. I know her.

456
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:03,675
Then come yourself and see.

457
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,174
No.

458
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:32,171
Do you know very well
she works here only?

459
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,373
Yes, I have heard. Since
when are you working here?

460
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,178
Since about 10 to 12 years.

461
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,182
I am speaking of a time
before that. About 20 years ago.

462
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:48,194
Munim, listen. Was a
woman named Chanda...

463
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:51,197
...working here 20 years ago?

464
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:54,534
What name?
- Chanda. Isn't that right?

465
00:35:56,304 --> 00:36:02,937
I do not remember anything.
Did she live here?

466
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:05,706
No, she had come here
after marriage in Darjeeling.

467
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:08,281
Her husband was lame.

468
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,808
Are you speaking
about Langu Harkara?

469
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,386
Yes, he's the one.

470
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:16,217
He had married the
daughter of some doctor.

471
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,758
Yes. Her name is Chanda.

472
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:22,888
She used to work here. In
the coloring department.

473
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:26,232
She would colour threads.
Her husband had died...

474
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,393
...just one year
after her marriage.

475
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:31,230
She had a daughter with Langu.

476
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:33,307
I am searching for
them only, Munim sir.

477
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:36,240
Do you know where they are?
Where can I meet them?

478
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:41,407
I cannot tell that, sir. It
seems to be another life now.

479
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:44,313
But I know that even
after the death of Langu...

480
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:47,251
...she was here for
three or four years.

481
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,424
She knew the herbs very well.
It was in those days only...

482
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:55,427
...that she went somewhere.
Perhaps she went to Dhaulpur.

483
00:36:57,365 --> 00:37:00,596
A woman named
Chanda in Dhaulpur?

484
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,669
Yes. She's a widow.
She has a daughter.

485
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:10,674
She had come from the Blue
Valley about 15 years ago.

486
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:15,438
She knows herbs well.
She knows Ayurveda also.

487
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:18,812
We do not know any
woman by this name.

488
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:24,619
Thank you.

489
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:35,460
Darjeeling to the Blue Valley
and from there to Dhaulpur.

490
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:37,298
I only know that much.

491
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:39,935
It is difficult to
find her like this, sir.

492
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:42,638
How many places
have you been to?

493
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,641
You do not know the
name of her husband...

494
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:48,647
...you do not know the
name of her daughter...

495
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:52,310
...and the one you know, who
knows if she is alive or...

496
00:37:53,687 --> 00:38:01,492
No! She is not dead.
This cannot be.

497
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,330
But will you recognise her
if you meet her daughter?

498
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:13,663
I will recognise. If not by
the face, then by the voice.

499
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:19,509
The voice will be
the same... Of Chanda.

500
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,386
"This heart lays in search..."

501
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:09,396
"...once again for those
days and nights of leisure..."

502
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:12,466
"This heart lays in search..."

503
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:18,402
"...once again for those
days and nights of leisure..."

504
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:27,414
"We remain sitting,
waiting when to know..."

505
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:30,416
"This heart lays in search..."

506
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:36,423
"...once again for those
days and nights of leisure..."

507
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:41,587
"This heart lays in
search once again..."

508
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:06,615
"On seeing the delicate
sunshine of the winter..."

509
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,951
"...and lying in the courtyard..."

510
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:19,624
"On seeing the delicate
sunshine of the winter..."

511
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:23,635
"...and lying in the courtyard..."

512
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:32,475
"Pulling the shade of
your coat over my eyes..."

513
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:41,488
"Pulling the shade of
your coat over my eyes..."

514
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:50,896
"We lay on our stomachs,
tossing and turning."

515
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:53,489
"This heart searches..."

516
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:56,502
"This heart lays in search..."

517
00:40:56,604 --> 00:41:02,509
"...once again for those
days and nights of leisure..."

518
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,673
"This heart lays in
search once again..."

519
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:48,881
"When the winds blow in
the nights of summer..."

520
00:41:53,994 --> 00:42:02,231
"When the winds blow in
the nights of summer..."

521
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:11,568
"...we keep awake in cold
white sheets until late."

522
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:20,587
"...we keep awake in cold
white sheets until late."

523
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:29,926
"We kept staring at the
stars lying on terraces..."

524
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,260
"This heart searches..."

525
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:35,597
"This heart lays in search..."

526
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:41,608
"...once again for those
days and nights of leisure..."

527
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:46,612
"This heart
searches once again..."

528
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:12,799
"This heart
searches once again..."

529
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:19,805
"...for those days and
nights of leisure..."

530
00:43:20,748 --> 00:43:36,324
"We keep sitting, not
knowing where to go..."

531
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:43,670
"This heart
searches once again..."

532
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:50,836
"...for those days
and nights of leisure."

533
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:24,301
Excuse me. I need to know
the whereabouts of a girl.

534
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,878
If you now, then...

535
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,876
Whose girl?

536
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:34,884
She's named Chanda. A woman now.

537
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:41,721
She knows herbs well.
She had come to stay here...

538
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:51,727
...from the Blue Valley. She
has a child also. She's a widow.

539
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:54,265
Thapa the doctor's daughter?

540
00:44:54,842 --> 00:44:58,141
Yes, she's the one.
Where is she?

541
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:03,908
She was. She was
a very nice girl.

542
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:09,916
Was? Does that
mean she isn't now?

543
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:15,918
No. She went from here.

544
00:45:21,134 --> 00:45:23,762
It is many years now...

545
00:45:23,871 --> 00:45:28,774
...she used to collect herbs
and bring and then sell them...

546
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:34,940
...in the bazaar. She used
to prescribe medicines also.

547
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,109
She had suffered
many torturous days.

548
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:47,793
Don't know how she got
an idea in her mind!

549
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,964
She would tell of
going to the city...

550
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:54,966
...and educate her
daughter to become a doctor.

551
00:45:56,904 --> 00:46:01,204
But the wretched woman
was ruined by her own self.

552
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,808
What had happened to her?
Where is she gone?

553
00:46:05,913 --> 00:46:12,148
Who knows who he was?
Dhanu or somebody.

554
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:16,148
Don't know what his
name was. Perhaps he was...

555
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:19,316
...her husband's brother.
Less of a brother...

556
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:23,829
...more of a slaughterer.
He would take whatever...

557
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:27,992
...she would earn. He tried to
keep her forcibly in his house.

558
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:32,329
He would threaten to kidnap
the girl and take her away.

559
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:36,910
She was getting
insulted due to him.

560
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:44,008
She had just one folly.
She would mutter to herself.

561
00:46:44,217 --> 00:46:46,185
She would speak to herself only.

562
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:49,847
But she was fond
of making medicines.

563
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:52,858
If I would tell her the medicine
for her asthmatic problem...

564
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,521
...she would tell me
her own prescriptions.

565
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:03,369
She would tell to put all
the seven salts in some leaf...

566
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,028
Where has she gone now?

567
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:09,199
I'll tell. Let me
finish what I am saying.

568
00:47:58,025 --> 00:48:03,258
Here. Jodha... Jodh...
- Jodhpal.

569
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:10,595
Yes. Here, you see this.
She had written this here.

570
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,269
It is her handwriting.

571
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:24,110
Contractor Jodhpal,
Pili Kothi, Siliguri.

572
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:29,955
This is the Pili Kothi. But it
has been sold since 2 years.

573
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:34,116
Where does the
contractor Jodhpal stay nowadays?

574
00:48:34,227 --> 00:48:36,957
He has retired now. He
stays in Calcutta only.

575
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:42,290
There was a woman named Chanda.

576
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:46,369
I have come from very
far to search for her.

577
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:50,305
Please tell me
where I can find her.

578
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,970
There's a gardener
living behind the cottage.

579
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,139
Meet him and ask. He was
taking care of that mad one.

580
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:58,483
Mad?

581
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:02,146
Yes. The elder one had lost
her senses and the younger...

582
00:49:02,255 --> 00:49:04,052
You meet him only and
ask. He'll tell you.

583
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:31,175
Can I get a glass of water?

584
00:49:31,284 --> 00:49:33,343
Yes, definitely.

585
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:49,527
You do not seem to
be well, sir. Here.

586
00:50:00,147 --> 00:50:07,246
A mad woman stayed here.
Chanda. - Yes.

587
00:50:07,354 --> 00:50:09,117
Can you tell me
anything about her?

588
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:13,388
She's not here anymore,
sir. She died.

589
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:20,394
When?

590
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:22,563
It is eight months.

591
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:29,806
How did she die?
What had happened?

592
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:40,249
It is a very sad tale, sir.
I would just hear and weep.

593
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:44,422
In her last days, she
had lost all her senses.

594
00:50:44,524 --> 00:50:47,254
She would run here and
there in her madness.

595
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,419
If she would see a
book in anyone's hands...

596
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:51,588
...she would hold
their hand and ask them...

597
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:55,600
...if their exams were over.
Are the exams over?

598
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:59,103
Have you become a doctor?
When you become a doctor...

599
00:50:59,206 --> 00:51:04,303
...you marry my daughter.
Teach her also. Her also...

600
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,109
Sir... Sir...

601
00:51:22,229 --> 00:51:24,288
She has lived
her life in misery.

602
00:51:25,565 --> 00:51:29,126
There was an old overcoat.
She would wear that.

603
00:51:30,237 --> 00:51:34,298
She also had a stick in
her hand. She used to tell...

604
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:38,138
...to burn the stick along
with her on her funeral pyre.

605
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:43,648
And Kajli? What happened to her?

606
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,344
No news from her since
she went to the city.

607
00:51:47,254 --> 00:51:50,155
She would send some
money for her mother...

608
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:53,488
...every month or two. She
had sent the message that...

609
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:56,494
...she had got a good job
and she was still studying.

610
00:51:56,596 --> 00:51:59,156
When she becomes a doctor,
she will come...

611
00:51:59,266 --> 00:52:02,497
...and treat her mother herself.
- Do you know her whereabouts?

612
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:04,229
She never sent any.

613
00:52:05,538 --> 00:52:08,336
Does she know
that Chanda is dead?

614
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:10,509
Yes. I had sent a
message with the person...

615
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:15,172
...who used to bring the money.
When the money stopped...

616
00:52:15,282 --> 00:52:19,514
...I understood that she
must have got the news.

617
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,521
She would make Kajli
wear this and look at her.

618
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:28,523
And this... she had told Kajli
that she would give it to her...

619
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:32,530
...when she became a doctor.
Don't know where she got it from.

620
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,528
Can I keep this too?

621
00:52:37,304 --> 00:52:39,204
Yes, keep it too.

622
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:43,538
Listen, give me that box.

623
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:50,750
It is that same thing, perhaps.
- What, sir?

624
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:56,282
I had given her
a white necklace.

625
00:52:56,389 --> 00:53:01,554
Of ivory? I have seen it.
She told Kajli that...

626
00:53:01,661 --> 00:53:03,891
...she would give
it to her as dowry.

627
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:11,733
It wasn't of ivory. I had lied
to her and she began arguing.

628
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,636
That time, I was
preparing to return to the city.

629
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:27,409
It is very beautiful.
Is it ivory? - Yes.

630
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,251
How much is it of?
- Of 715 rupees.

631
00:53:35,362 --> 00:53:36,590
What happened?

632
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:41,656
How do you have so much money?
- That...

633
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:59,350
There were 128 rupees in
it. Only 60 are left now.

634
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:00,783
Where are the rest?

635
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:02,286
I have kept those sixty
for returning to the city.

636
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:03,788
Don't touch them.

637
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:08,626
Why did you touch them?
There were 128 rupees here.

638
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,693
How many days have
passed since I kept them?

639
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:12,355
Don't I have any expense?

640
00:54:12,465 --> 00:54:15,628
What expense do you have?
You eat for free.

641
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:19,694
I wash your clothes. You get
milk twice in a day. That's all.

642
00:54:23,676 --> 00:54:26,304
And this necklace of 45
rupees? Does the pundit...

643
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:28,381
...in the temple distribute them?

644
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:33,481
Is it of 45 rupees?

645
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:36,321
Doesn't it seem to be so?

646
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,492
That it does.

647
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,665
Give me the remaining money.

648
00:54:51,438 --> 00:54:54,339
What money is left? I
spent 50 paise on tea...

649
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:56,500
...and 50 paise for the rickshaw.

650
00:54:56,609 --> 00:54:59,510
Tea? Had you drunk in a bucket?

651
00:54:59,612 --> 00:55:01,842
Not drunk, but bathed in it.

652
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,540
What is this? Show.

653
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:06,680
Hey...

654
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:16,422
58 rupees.
- Isn't it a good photo?

655
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,760
How did these come? Tell
me how much this is of.

656
00:55:20,867 --> 00:55:22,357
You'll have to swear on me.

657
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:27,702
No, no. This box, it
is of three rupees.

658
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:30,037
And this necklace?
- Of 75 paise.

659
00:55:31,478 --> 00:55:35,380
I do not want a necklace
of 75 paise. Am I a beggar?

660
00:55:35,482 --> 00:55:38,576
Great! So long as it was
of 45 rupees, it was nice.

661
00:55:38,685 --> 00:55:40,710
Now that it is of
75 paise, it is bad?

662
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,380
Princess Chanda, it
is the same necklace.

663
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:45,390
Is a 75 paise
necklace a necklace?

664
00:55:45,758 --> 00:55:48,454
What if the
necklace is of 75 paise?

665
00:55:48,761 --> 00:55:50,991
The heart is not of 75 paise.

666
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:54,733
Take your hand away.
- What happened?

667
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:56,392
Do not rub your ears.
It becomes septic.

668
00:55:56,503 --> 00:55:59,734
What does it become?
- Septic.

669
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:03,468
Look, you forget this medicine.
You'll simply kill some patient.

670
00:56:03,576 --> 00:56:06,568
You become a doctor.
I'll leave then.

671
00:56:06,779 --> 00:56:09,748
What will be the delay
in my becoming a doctor?

672
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:12,909
Just about ten days.
I'll go next Tuesday...

673
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:14,919
...there will be the
exams on Wednesday.

674
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:18,582
What will be there?
- Exams! Examination.

675
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:21,922
Didn't you say that
you will get something?

676
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:25,759
Yes, a first class degree.
After that I can kill anyone.

677
00:56:28,535 --> 00:56:33,029
When will you speak to father?
You are going on Tuesday.

678
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,599
Now five days is remain.
I'll speak tomorrow itself.

679
00:56:38,545 --> 00:56:40,035
What will you tell him?

680
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,946
I'll tell I want to marry
Chanda and take her with me.

681
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,846
Will you not give me time
to make the preparations?

682
00:56:49,556 --> 00:56:51,956
If I just send her like that,
she will think I only...

683
00:56:52,058 --> 00:56:56,461
...washed my hands off my
responsibility. No, my son.

684
00:56:56,663 --> 00:57:02,465
Not like this. I'm fortunate
that Chanda is born in my house.

685
00:57:02,902 --> 00:57:06,463
You are also fortunate that
she is going to your house.

686
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:12,474
When such a goddess of
wealth enters someone's home...

687
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:18,483
Go, son, go. I
am obliged to you.

688
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,644
Whenever you shall come, I
shall return your wealth to you.

689
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,648
Go.

690
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,661
That was the last
time I saw Chanda.

691
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:42,507
I thought that this journey
will take me back to Chanda...

692
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:47,512
...in a few weeks, but it
extended to many years.

693
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,043
I committed a very big mistake.

694
00:57:55,622 --> 00:58:01,527
It's result would be this,
I never imagined.

695
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:08,693
I should have returned.
I should have returned.

696
00:58:38,654 --> 00:58:42,613
Yes please.
- Do you have aspirin?

697
00:58:42,725 --> 00:58:44,784
Can I give you Gill's tablets?
They are very effective.

698
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:45,952
You'll get relief soon.

699
00:58:48,564 --> 00:58:52,625
No, brother. They have
more chlorine, less medicine.

700
00:58:52,835 --> 00:58:54,462
Give me aspirin only.

701
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:55,798
As you wish.

702
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,477
Scoundrel, rascal, will you
sit here the whole night...

703
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:10,643
...for ten rupees?
Is this your house?

704
00:59:10,753 --> 00:59:12,812
If you come here again,
I shall cut you up and...

705
00:59:12,922 --> 00:59:14,822
...feed you to the
crows. I shall...

706
00:59:24,266 --> 00:59:25,699
Give me my slippers.

707
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:30,498
Take these. And beat
your wife with them.

708
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:32,665
Where do they come from?

709
00:59:35,945 --> 00:59:38,505
What are you seeing, sir?
If you want to have fun...

710
00:59:38,614 --> 00:59:39,842
...come upstairs.
Or else, go away.

711
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:48,522
Come on, Kajli. Why are
you spoiling business?

712
00:59:48,624 --> 00:59:50,683
Only God can
understand your anger.

713
00:59:56,732 --> 01:00:01,692
Sir, aspirin. Take your aspirin.

714
01:00:04,073 --> 01:00:05,870
What are you
embroiling yourself into, sir?

715
01:00:05,975 --> 01:00:07,875
This happens here every night.

716
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:12,703
This girl... who is this girl?

717
01:00:12,815 --> 01:00:15,545
She is a prostitute, sir.
Didn't you hear her language?

718
01:00:16,652 --> 01:00:18,711
Such foul words!

719
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:21,549
You can hear such
dirty language here that...

720
01:00:21,657 --> 01:00:24,717
...a gentleman would go
home and wash his ears.

721
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:28,726
Three rupees.

722
01:00:43,012 --> 01:00:44,980
Your balance, sir.

723
01:02:23,779 --> 01:02:29,740
Does some girl
named Kajli live here?

724
01:02:33,822 --> 01:02:37,758
I want to meet her.

725
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:41,860
She is resting now; a customer
has just left. She is tired.

726
01:02:41,964 --> 01:02:47,368
Will someone else do?
- I have some work with her.

727
01:02:50,806 --> 01:02:55,869
Everyone has the
same work. Come.

728
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:05,884
Get up. - Who is it? - 
Go inside and sleep. Sit.

729
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:22,896
Kajli, get up. Someone
has come for you. Get up.

730
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,743
Let me sleep, auntie. How
much will you make me toil?

731
01:03:30,112 --> 01:03:32,808
Get up, child. He seems
to be a very rich man.

732
01:03:32,915 --> 01:03:35,076
If he was a pauper, I myself
would have shooed him off.

733
01:03:37,853 --> 01:03:40,822
I do not think he will sit.
He'll have fun you and go away.

734
01:03:40,923 --> 01:03:44,916
Meet him. And do not agree to
anything less than 30 or 40.

735
01:04:17,893 --> 01:04:21,954
Hey sir, you were
so late in coming.

736
01:04:22,898 --> 01:04:29,804
I am yawning. Sit.

737
01:05:02,204 --> 01:05:03,831
Will you have
something to drink?

738
01:05:05,941 --> 01:05:11,345
No whisky. But I have country
beer, like myself. Will it do?

739
01:05:12,948 --> 01:05:17,851
No, daughter. I
just came to meet you.

740
01:05:17,953 --> 01:05:20,854
Why do you call me daughter?
Just come down to business.

741
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:27,019
I have come here with
some other work, daughter.

742
01:05:27,129 --> 01:05:31,031
Don't tell daughter. I
have heard lot of this.

743
01:05:31,967 --> 01:05:34,026
Tell me if you want to sit.

744
01:05:34,136 --> 01:05:35,467
What is your name?

745
01:05:35,571 --> 01:05:37,539
What will you do with
my name? Do you want...

746
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:39,197
...to take me home? Why
know about my ancestors?

747
01:05:39,308 --> 01:05:41,208
My mother was mad,
my father was lame.

748
01:05:41,977 --> 01:05:43,945
Want to ask something more?

749
01:05:44,046 --> 01:05:45,877
Why are you
getting angry, daughter?

750
01:05:47,983 --> 01:05:53,046
Auntie... auntie...

751
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:56,890
Listen to me.

752
01:05:56,992 --> 01:05:58,960
You only take care
of this old man.

753
01:05:59,061 --> 01:06:00,961
He has come to adopt me.

754
01:06:21,016 --> 01:06:22,074
What happened?

755
01:06:23,118 --> 01:06:24,415
Come on inside.

756
01:06:49,311 --> 01:06:51,472
Is Kajli there?

757
01:06:52,047 --> 01:07:03,288
Kajli... See your old
man has come. Go. Go.

758
01:07:17,072 --> 01:07:18,471
So you came back?

759
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:21,975
Listen to what I
have to say, daughter.

760
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:26,309
Daughter again?
Go. Get out. Go away.

761
01:07:26,415 --> 01:07:32,149
Where do these people come from?

762
01:07:32,254 --> 01:07:33,312
These people...

763
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:16,020
What is it? What
do you want now?

764
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:24,368
I want Kajli. I have whisky.
I need soda. Can I get it?

765
01:08:32,247 --> 01:08:36,445
So you have come on
the right path. Come.

766
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:50,389
Sit. I'll bring the soda.

767
01:09:00,175 --> 01:09:03,144
What is it? What is your name?
- Paro.

768
01:09:03,245 --> 01:09:06,408
Will you take some whisky, sir?
- No.

769
01:09:08,183 --> 01:09:13,246
So you too are bonkers for
Kajli! She is quite an item.

770
01:09:13,355 --> 01:09:17,086
Once you are addicted to her,
you can have no one else.

771
01:09:17,459 --> 01:09:20,087
Husain, did you like anyone?

772
01:09:20,195 --> 01:09:22,425
None from this lot.
- Then go inside. Go.

773
01:09:22,531 --> 01:09:24,089
Come on, let's play poker.

774
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:26,258
Do you have money?
- Certainly.

775
01:09:26,368 --> 01:09:29,098
Can I come also? - Be seated
there. It is strictly cash here.

776
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,098
Here, this is mine.

777
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:35,267
Distribute for me. I'll
come just now. - Come soon.

778
01:09:40,215 --> 01:09:42,115
Is there any place
to sit separately?

779
01:09:42,217 --> 01:09:45,277
Yes. It will take Rs. 5 more.

780
01:09:45,387 --> 01:09:49,289
Doesn't matter.
- Come on. Bring the soda.

781
01:09:49,825 --> 01:09:51,452
Go, sir. Go.

782
01:10:00,502 --> 01:10:02,163
Sit down.

783
01:10:25,527 --> 01:10:27,154
Since when do you drink?

784
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:31,158
Since I am in this job. The
one who would come earlier...

785
01:10:31,266 --> 01:10:35,327
...used to give me forcibly.
Now it has become a habit.

786
01:10:35,604 --> 01:10:38,164
If I don't drink,
I cannot sleep.

787
01:10:42,277 --> 01:10:44,177
You didn't touch the glasses.

788
01:10:48,617 --> 01:10:50,175
Cheers!

789
01:10:51,286 --> 01:10:53,186
What did you say?

790
01:10:53,722 --> 01:10:55,349
Nothing.

791
01:11:02,564 --> 01:11:04,191
Kajli!

792
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:07,535
What is it, auntie?
- Listen.

793
01:11:10,305 --> 01:11:12,603
Will he sit the
whole night or go?

794
01:11:12,707 --> 01:11:15,369
I don't know.
- Ask him.

795
01:11:15,477 --> 01:11:20,210
Why? - Chawdhary has come.
He doesn't go to anyone...

796
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:21,543
...but you.

797
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:24,710
What do I do, auntie?
He's sitting. Tell him...

798
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:26,286
...someone took me outside.

799
01:11:29,324 --> 01:11:31,724
Come on, why are you fretting.

800
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:35,558
Chawdhary, she is
sitting with a client.

801
01:11:35,664 --> 01:11:37,291
Let me show.

802
01:11:42,604 --> 01:11:47,234
Chawdhary! What are you doing?

803
01:11:47,342 --> 01:11:49,572
It's a very rich
client you have trapped.

804
01:11:49,778 --> 01:11:52,246
You sit with him Kajli.
I shall deal with him.

805
01:11:52,347 --> 01:11:53,746
Come on with me.
- What will you take?

806
01:11:59,688 --> 01:12:01,417
Many people come here.

807
01:12:02,624 --> 01:12:05,422
Some days many people come
here. But on some other days...

808
01:12:05,527 --> 01:12:07,427
...it is so empty here, do
not even ask about them.

809
01:12:07,629 --> 01:12:09,756
People do not come
here even to just drink.

810
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:16,667
But that Gangu Rani, she
takes good care of the girls.

811
01:12:16,805 --> 01:12:20,673
Just like a mother
she treats them. Drink.

812
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:22,606
You are very slow.

813
01:12:23,378 --> 01:12:25,346
What's the hurry?

814
01:12:25,814 --> 01:12:27,782
Will you stay the whole night?

815
01:12:31,987 --> 01:12:38,449
Yes. Do you go out also?

816
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,460
Yes. If he is atrustworthy
man, Gangu Rani sends me.

817
01:12:42,564 --> 01:12:44,623
What does trustworthy mean?

818
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:48,291
Gangu Rani looks at
the man and understands.

819
01:12:48,403 --> 01:12:50,371
She has seen in a lot in life.

820
01:12:54,676 --> 01:12:56,473
Will she send you with me?

821
01:12:58,513 --> 01:13:00,310
It appears so.

822
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:05,818
Not for just one night.
For many days.

823
01:13:08,423 --> 01:13:09,822
Out of the city?

824
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:12,722
No, in this city only.

825
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:17,491
As long as I am in this city.

826
01:13:24,706 --> 01:13:31,839
I understand. I have also seen
life. But it will cost a lot.

827
01:13:31,946 --> 01:13:36,508
Do not worry about money. I
will give as much as you ask.

828
01:13:37,452 --> 01:13:41,354
But you will have to stay
with me where I tell you.

829
01:13:41,456 --> 01:13:43,686
Agreed. Okay.

830
01:13:49,564 --> 01:13:51,532
Tell me, from when.

831
01:13:52,467 --> 01:13:53,695
From today.

832
01:13:57,472 --> 01:13:59,702
How much will you take? Tell me.

833
01:14:02,744 --> 01:14:09,547
Shall I call Gangu Rani?
You'll give an advance. No drugs.

834
01:14:09,651 --> 01:14:11,380
Call her.

835
01:14:36,511 --> 01:14:37,910
You sleep.

836
01:14:40,515 --> 01:14:42,005
Dinner, sir?

837
01:14:42,117 --> 01:14:45,575
I have eaten. You sleep.
Turn off the lights.

838
01:14:59,534 --> 01:15:02,765
Where are we?

839
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:07,885
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

840
01:16:10,922 --> 01:16:13,550
Keep the tea
outside in the lawn.

841
01:16:44,956 --> 01:16:48,084
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

842
01:16:48,793 --> 01:16:51,591
I waited for you
till late at night.

843
01:16:51,696 --> 01:16:55,188
Yes, I was delayed.

844
01:17:01,706 --> 01:17:03,765
Those papers which have
come from the office...

845
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:07,777
...I have signed them and kept.
You can take them and return.

846
01:17:08,146 --> 01:17:12,105
Take Dhyan Singh also with
you. I shall not need him.

847
01:17:12,984 --> 01:17:17,114
Tell in the office not todisturb
me at all these vacations.

848
01:17:17,722 --> 01:17:20,156
I do not know
when I shall return.

849
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:24,786
Tell Kiran to mind the business.

850
01:17:27,999 --> 01:17:30,627
Do you want to ask anything?
- No.

851
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:40,643
You woke up? - Yes. I
got much drunk last night.

852
01:17:42,013 --> 01:17:44,140
You go. Make
preparations for your return.

853
01:17:47,752 --> 01:17:50,152
This whisky is a
very miserable thing.

854
01:17:50,255 --> 01:17:52,155
Look, do not swear.

855
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:56,727
I have sworn at whisky, not you.

856
01:17:57,028 --> 01:18:01,055
It may be for the whisky; but
girls don't look good cussing.

857
01:18:01,766 --> 01:18:05,668
Whether it is a boy or a girl,
a swear word is a swear word.

858
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:07,735
What is good in that?

859
01:18:13,044 --> 01:18:16,013
Let us get some new
clothes for you today.

860
01:18:16,314 --> 01:18:19,010
I have some.
They are in the box.

861
01:18:19,217 --> 01:18:23,017
Even then, let me buy
some more. - Buy them.

862
01:18:23,121 --> 01:18:26,181
What loss it is to me? But
do not cut it from my fees.

863
01:18:28,893 --> 01:18:31,020
You are good at business.

864
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:37,698
What else? If you have to
sell your body to live...

865
01:18:37,802 --> 01:18:39,895
...then you'll know.

866
01:18:41,072 --> 01:18:45,099
What are you doing?
- What?

867
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,041
Why are you smoking a beedi?

868
01:18:47,812 --> 01:18:51,213
I smoke beedi.

869
01:18:53,818 --> 01:18:57,049
That may be. But is
it a problem if you...

870
01:18:57,155 --> 01:18:59,783
...do not smoke here
in front of everybody?

871
01:19:00,425 --> 01:19:04,725
Look friend, this will be
very difficult. You've paid me...

872
01:19:04,829 --> 01:19:08,458
...but do not boss on
me as if I am your wife.

873
01:19:08,566 --> 01:19:11,797
Do not smoke; do not swear;
don't do this; don't do that.

874
01:19:13,171 --> 01:19:17,073
For what you have paid me,
that I know and you know too.

875
01:19:19,444 --> 01:19:25,076
Look, if you feel so much
like smoking, then go inside.

876
01:19:26,117 --> 01:19:29,143
Outside there are servants.
People look.

877
01:19:29,387 --> 01:19:33,915
If you keep my respect among
them, it will be a favour.

878
01:19:34,959 --> 01:19:39,760
Otherwise, let's bathe and go
out. Where do I refuse there?

879
01:19:42,867 --> 01:19:45,768
I get humiliated very
much with a respectable man.

880
01:19:52,877 --> 01:19:55,175
Sir, you have a
trunk call from Calcutta.

881
01:20:01,152 --> 01:20:05,851
Hello. Speak Kiran.
I am all right.

882
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:14,127
I have money. I'll ask
if I need. And listen...

883
01:20:14,232 --> 01:20:20,137
I am sending Mathur and Kiran
back. Oh, don't you bother...

884
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:27,144
...and don't bother me also.
What? Okay, you sign it. Okay.

885
01:20:29,914 --> 01:20:32,883
Sorry sir. I had to
disturb you in the morning.

886
01:20:32,984 --> 01:20:35,885
I'm going back today. I
thought of meeting you.

887
01:20:35,987 --> 01:20:38,353
If you need anything from
Calcutta, you can tell me.

888
01:20:39,924 --> 01:20:41,152
Sir...

889
01:20:41,926 --> 01:20:43,985
Sir...
- What is it?

890
01:20:44,095 --> 01:20:46,222
Where is the box of my clothes?

891
01:20:47,932 --> 01:20:50,332
In my drunkenness, I
lost my wits only.

892
01:20:52,203 --> 01:20:56,833
It is outside in the car. Tell
the driver. He'll remove it.

893
01:20:58,943 --> 01:21:01,173
So, when are you going?

894
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:04,840
I thought of meeting you. - Will
you have tea? - No, I'll go now.

895
01:21:04,949 --> 01:21:09,045
I wouldn't want to disturb you
much. Have a good time, sir.

896
01:21:18,062 --> 01:21:20,189
I got it. It was in the car.

897
01:21:20,298 --> 01:21:22,528
Did you have to ask now only?
- What happened?

898
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:28,871
Don't you have anything
else to wear? Like some saris?

899
01:21:29,974 --> 01:21:32,204
You go, get ready.
We'll go to the bazaar.

900
01:21:50,094 --> 01:21:53,222
Look, how beautiful
you look like this.

901
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:55,891
Unnecessarily you
put all the makeup.

902
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,903
You speak like a lover. No
one has told me this before.

903
01:22:01,272 --> 01:22:04,241
Can't you speak
without calling names?

904
01:22:05,009 --> 01:22:07,307
If you feel bad, I
shan't say so, my friend.

905
01:22:11,015 --> 01:22:14,576
Wear one of these saris.
Which one will you wear?

906
01:22:15,019 --> 01:22:17,249
The one that you like.

907
01:22:19,023 --> 01:22:21,253
You wear it. I'll go outside.

908
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:25,261
Why do you go out? I shall
wear it in front of you, friend.

909
01:22:25,363 --> 01:22:27,263
Won't you feel ashamed
to change in front of me?

910
01:22:27,365 --> 01:22:30,129
Your daughter may get
ashamed. Why should I?

911
01:22:31,035 --> 01:22:33,936
People spend so much
money for the body.

912
01:22:34,038 --> 01:22:39,943
Will it always remain like this?
I was going to call you a name.

913
01:22:40,044 --> 01:22:42,945
You wear. I'll go outside.

914
01:22:43,047 --> 01:22:50,283
I understood you. - What? -
You are another type of man.

915
01:22:50,488 --> 01:22:52,012
Another type?

916
01:22:53,324 --> 01:22:56,293
Yes, the romantic. They
keep girls only for roaming...

917
01:22:56,394 --> 01:23:00,023
...drinking and dancing.
Isn't that true?

918
01:23:00,331 --> 01:23:02,959
Yes. I am that
other type of man.

919
01:23:04,068 --> 01:23:06,969
But you have
committed a mistake. - What?

920
01:23:07,071 --> 01:23:09,301
It would have been better
if you'd have chosen Champa.

921
01:23:09,407 --> 01:23:15,312
She dances quite well. She
taught me, but I didn't learn.

922
01:23:15,413 --> 01:23:21,147
But I'll show you.
- Okay. Wear the sari.

923
01:23:30,361 --> 01:23:39,997
"I sway a lot in my love... My
lover, get aside... get aside..."

924
01:23:40,204 --> 01:23:48,339
"I sway a lot in my love... My
lover, get aside... get aside..."

925
01:23:48,546 --> 01:23:51,344
"If I wink..."

926
01:23:51,449 --> 01:23:53,178
What is this? What is happening?

927
01:23:53,284 --> 01:23:59,086
"If I wink, you
shall fall, my lover..."

928
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:00,350
Oh no!

929
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:03,086
"My lover, get aside,
get aside, get aside..."

930
01:24:03,194 --> 01:24:11,192
"I sway a lot in my love... My
lover, get aside... get aside..."

931
01:24:11,302 --> 01:24:20,210
"I sway a lot in my love... My
lover, get aside... get aside..."

932
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:40,063
"My waist is so thin..."

933
01:24:44,769 --> 01:24:49,069
"My waist is so thin..."

934
01:24:49,173 --> 01:24:53,075
"...and on that thin
waist I have tied a pot..."

935
01:24:53,177 --> 01:24:57,580
"My lover, get aside,
get aside, get aside..."

936
01:24:57,682 --> 01:25:05,088
"I sway a lot in my love... My
lover, get aside... get aside..."

937
01:25:05,289 --> 01:25:14,163
"I sway a lot in my love... My
lover, get aside... get aside..."

938
01:25:25,209 --> 01:25:27,370
What happened?
Do you feel dizzy?

939
01:25:27,478 --> 01:25:29,105
Yes, a little.

940
01:25:29,313 --> 01:25:31,110
Enough! You've done too much.

941
01:25:31,482 --> 01:25:35,714
Didn't you like it?
- It's nice. It's very nice.

942
01:25:48,499 --> 01:25:55,132
"The intoxication of
alcohol on the peach colour..."

943
01:25:58,509 --> 01:26:03,139
"The intoxication of
alcohol on the peach colour..."

944
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:07,308
"My lover has
spoiled my habits..."

945
01:26:07,418 --> 01:26:10,751
"My lover, get aside,
get aside, get aside..."

946
01:26:10,855 --> 01:26:19,320
"I sway a lot in my love... My
lover, get aside... get aside..."

947
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:21,660
"If I wink..."

948
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:23,665
Enough, Kajli.

949
01:26:24,268 --> 01:26:27,829
I am doing this for you. You
are spending so much on me.

950
01:26:27,939 --> 01:26:31,568
Do not worry about my money.
I have a lot of it.

951
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:34,506
Ask how much you want.

952
01:26:34,812 --> 01:26:36,370
What do I want to do?

953
01:26:36,547 --> 01:26:39,675
If I get for my food and
booze, enough. What else?

954
01:26:42,286 --> 01:26:44,186
Will you drink some?

955
01:26:44,555 --> 01:26:46,853
No. Not today.

956
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:48,357
Are you sick?

957
01:26:48,559 --> 01:26:52,359
No. Is it necessary
man should drink daily.

958
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:54,357
I'll not be able
to drink, friend.

959
01:26:55,299 --> 01:26:57,199
Try abstaining for one day.

960
01:26:57,301 --> 01:26:59,269
You will make me
go out of business.

961
01:26:59,637 --> 01:27:01,798
When I was not doing all this,
someone used to come...

962
01:27:01,906 --> 01:27:05,205
...and make me do all
this forcibly. But now...

963
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:09,712
...somehow you have come.
Why did you not come then?

964
01:27:10,915 --> 01:27:12,212
When?

965
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:14,277
When I was young.

966
01:27:14,752 --> 01:27:19,621
I could not come then. I
am repenting for that now.

967
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:23,225
But if you'd have come then,
we would not have gelled.

968
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:26,229
Why? - But you would
have gelled with my mother...

969
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:28,560
...because she was
also very beautiful.

970
01:27:31,335 --> 01:27:33,235
What was your mother doing?

971
01:27:34,605 --> 01:27:38,564
She was just dying. She
kept dying for twenty years.

972
01:27:38,676 --> 01:27:40,576
For some scoundrel of a doctor.

973
01:27:42,346 --> 01:27:47,249
But don't remind me of all that.
Do not ever talk of my family.

974
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:49,410
I'll warn you
against that now only.

975
01:27:53,357 --> 01:27:55,757
I do not feel naked
sitting among naked people now...

976
01:27:55,860 --> 01:28:00,422
...but I do feel ashamed
among respectable folk.

977
01:28:01,365 --> 01:28:03,424
I can then see my nakedness.

978
01:28:03,534 --> 01:28:06,332
You only had gone
and sat in nakedness.

979
01:28:06,437 --> 01:28:09,668
Come back to where
you had gone from.

980
01:28:12,376 --> 01:28:14,435
Do you not know of the cobbler...

981
01:28:14,545 --> 01:28:17,275
...who spent a
lifetime working in leather?

982
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:20,612
The day he passed by a
perfumery, he fainted.

983
01:28:24,388 --> 01:28:27,289
He had gone there after
many days; that's why.

984
01:28:27,825 --> 01:28:29,690
If he goes there daily,
then he will not faint.

985
01:28:29,794 --> 01:28:32,285
It isn't needed at
all. If one feels...

986
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:34,830
...naked going somewhere,
why should they go there?

987
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:41,303
I will have to travel to the
market of perfumes so many...

988
01:28:41,405 --> 01:28:43,635
...times, you will forget
the stench of leather.

989
01:28:45,409 --> 01:28:47,639
You must have gone to
some other paths too.

990
01:28:49,413 --> 01:28:53,372
Not all the time... - Sir...
this was left in the both room.

991
01:28:58,422 --> 01:29:00,322
This... is this yours?

992
01:29:01,525 --> 01:29:02,822
Yes.

993
01:29:07,431 --> 01:29:09,399
Why do you wear this coral.

994
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:13,665
Someone had given it to me.

995
01:29:14,872 --> 01:29:16,339
Who had?

996
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,670
Some one.
- Is he not there any longer?

997
01:29:18,776 --> 01:29:23,679
He is there. I don't
know how and where he is.

998
01:29:25,449 --> 01:29:27,349
What is his name?

999
01:29:28,452 --> 01:29:29,851
Kundan.

1000
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:34,515
Do you want to
search for him? Do you?

1001
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:37,423
Why are you
worried about my life?

1002
01:29:37,528 --> 01:29:40,429
Do you want some alcohol?
Shall I bring the glass?

1003
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:00,545
I look dignified
with you now, isn't it?

1004
01:30:02,586 --> 01:30:05,384
There is something.
You are a good man.

1005
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:09,391
But you are useless for me.
- What do you mean?

1006
01:30:10,494 --> 01:30:12,894
Have you kept a
woman for the first time?

1007
01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:15,726
Yes.

1008
01:30:17,501 --> 01:30:19,469
Never married?

1009
01:30:20,604 --> 01:30:21,730
No.

1010
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,398
Why?

1011
01:30:26,777 --> 01:30:31,737
It was a long time ago.
I loved a woman.

1012
01:30:33,117 --> 01:30:35,915
I wanted to come
back and marry her.

1013
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:38,921
But... in those days...

1014
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:44,426
A man was killed at my
hands during an operation.

1015
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:48,430
Are you a doctor?

1016
01:30:48,532 --> 01:30:50,932
No. A surgeon.

1017
01:30:54,538 --> 01:30:58,497
There was a police case, and
I was jailed for three years.

1018
01:30:59,543 --> 01:31:03,946
Because of that shame, I
didn't tell her anything.

1019
01:31:04,815 --> 01:31:08,615
I didn't come back,
and neither did I marry.

1020
01:31:13,224 --> 01:31:16,625
Don't scratch your ears.
They get poisoned.

1021
01:31:19,563 --> 01:31:21,963
Don't scratch your ears.
They get poisoned.

1022
01:31:22,066 --> 01:31:25,467
Who told you that if you itch
your ears, they get poisoned?

1023
01:31:25,569 --> 01:31:29,630
Mother. Mother told it
to me. In my childhood.

1024
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:50,656
Where are we going?

1025
01:31:51,595 --> 01:31:53,563
The blue valley.

1026
01:31:57,034 --> 01:31:58,831
Have you ever gone there?

1027
01:31:58,936 --> 01:32:01,905
Yes, in my childhood.

1028
01:32:03,607 --> 01:32:05,507
How is the place?

1029
01:32:05,609 --> 01:32:07,668
I just remember two places.

1030
01:32:07,945 --> 01:32:11,574
One is the company,
mother used to work there.

1031
01:32:11,882 --> 01:32:16,842
And the hospital, where
mother used to take me to.

1032
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:18,849
Why?

1033
01:32:19,723 --> 01:32:24,683
She used to tell the
doctors to make me a doctor.

1034
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:27,688
Then?

1035
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:31,734
Then what. Does anyone want
a doctor without studying?

1036
01:32:33,637 --> 01:32:35,730
If you wish, you can
continue your studies.

1037
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,205
You can become doctor.

1038
01:32:38,742 --> 01:32:41,870
Should I tell you something?
I hate the word doctor.

1039
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:44,545
I don't hate that man
as much who made me...

1040
01:32:44,648 --> 01:32:47,879
...a prostitute, as much
as I hate that doctor...

1041
01:32:47,985 --> 01:32:49,885
...because of whom my
mother went crazy.

1042
01:32:52,756 --> 01:32:55,156
If I would meet him
once in this life...

1043
01:32:55,259 --> 01:32:57,887
Then? What would you do?

1044
01:32:58,095 --> 01:33:00,086
Even I don't know what I'd do.

1045
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:04,734
I just know that whatever
I'd do would be very bad.

1046
01:33:10,107 --> 01:33:16,740
Rascal! Wretch!
- Oh god...

1047
01:33:16,847 --> 01:33:19,907
Get lost from here. Get lost.
- No, I won't... I won't...

1048
01:33:26,123 --> 01:33:28,250
What is going on? Why
are you two fighting?

1049
01:33:28,359 --> 01:33:33,126
Dare he hit me! I will
wreck his entire family.

1050
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:34,993
I will...
- Silent, Kajli.

1051
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:36,927
What is the matter?

1052
01:33:37,034 --> 01:33:39,764
Sir, I told her not to
come in the kitchen.

1053
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:41,269
But she didn't listen to me.

1054
01:33:41,372 --> 01:33:43,602
Who are you to refuse me?
Is this your father's house?

1055
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:45,607
See, sir... when I told her
to go out of the kitchen...

1056
01:33:45,709 --> 01:33:47,609
...she abused me on my mother.

1057
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:49,144
Why did you send her separate?

1058
01:33:50,714 --> 01:33:54,616
See, sir... I have been
silent till today because of you.

1059
01:33:55,052 --> 01:33:57,612
Otherwise, you
know it very well.

1060
01:33:57,721 --> 01:34:00,121
I cannot eat
anything that she touches.

1061
01:34:00,324 --> 01:34:02,952
If you can eat it,
please have her cook it.

1062
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:07,128
I will have her cook it.
Go away from here.

1063
01:34:07,331 --> 01:34:10,960
This is not correct, sir. A
respectable man like you...

1064
01:34:11,068 --> 01:34:13,036
You don't have to
worry about my respect.

1065
01:34:13,137 --> 01:34:14,968
I will take care
of my own respect.

1066
01:34:15,739 --> 01:34:17,639
Please leave.

1067
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:26,147
Come with me.

1068
01:34:38,762 --> 01:34:40,662
I threw the cook away.

1069
01:34:40,764 --> 01:34:42,664
To hell with the wretch.

1070
01:34:42,766 --> 01:34:44,825
And which wretch
will cook the good?

1071
01:34:44,935 --> 01:34:47,665
I will cook the food,
don't I know how to?

1072
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:53,675
Eat it and see. You
will forget this wretch.

1073
01:34:53,877 --> 01:34:58,007
Is it? Okay. Bring it. Come on.

1074
01:36:10,854 --> 01:36:12,754
Are you going to Dholpur?

1075
01:36:12,856 --> 01:36:16,155
Yes. I think that is
the name of that place.

1076
01:36:17,127 --> 01:36:18,822
What work do you have there?

1077
01:36:20,864 --> 01:36:22,263
I want to search
for a man there.

1078
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:24,766
What is the name of that person?

1079
01:36:25,869 --> 01:36:29,965
Kundan.
- Why? - I have some work.

1080
01:36:30,074 --> 01:36:31,302
What is the work?

1081
01:36:31,475 --> 01:36:34,933
Not me, but you can
have some work with him.

1082
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:38,446
No, I don't have any work,
I don't want to meet him.

1083
01:36:44,988 --> 01:36:48,947
You loved Kundan, isn't it?

1084
01:36:49,226 --> 01:36:50,853
Yes, so?

1085
01:36:51,228 --> 01:36:54,197
What if Kundan is
still waiting for you?

1086
01:36:54,898 --> 01:36:57,128
Nobody waits for
anybody for so long.

1087
01:36:58,902 --> 01:37:01,302
Didn't your mother
wait for a doctor?

1088
01:37:02,906 --> 01:37:04,305
Twenty years.

1089
01:37:07,177 --> 01:37:11,136
It isn't wrong to meet him once.

1090
01:37:12,015 --> 01:37:15,883
I am not worthy of
him anymore now.

1091
01:37:17,254 --> 01:37:19,814
And I will not hide
anything from him too.

1092
01:37:19,923 --> 01:37:23,984
It is possible that the
doctor thought like this...

1093
01:37:24,094 --> 01:37:26,824
...and he didn't return too.

1094
01:37:30,033 --> 01:37:36,165
If that doctor returned...
wouldn't your mother forgive him?

1095
01:38:01,231 --> 01:38:02,255
Yes?

1096
01:38:05,569 --> 01:38:08,197
Kundan... Kundan
stayed here, isn't it?

1097
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:10,034
Yes, he stays here...

1098
01:38:11,975 --> 01:38:13,374
I... I...

1099
01:38:14,978 --> 01:38:16,878
I wanted to meet him.

1100
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:18,880
He has gone out for some work.

1101
01:38:18,982 --> 01:38:21,041
Tell me. I am his wife.

1102
01:38:28,325 --> 01:38:30,054
So... he has married...

1103
01:38:35,265 --> 01:38:37,290
Can I tell you something, Kajli?

1104
01:38:39,002 --> 01:38:41,300
Why don't you marry someone too?

1105
01:38:42,339 --> 01:38:46,070
Someone nice...
- Who lets anyone remain nice?

1106
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:51,413
No woman is a born prostitute.
You get people to make them.

1107
01:38:52,616 --> 01:38:55,915
I have got also.
- Who?

1108
01:38:56,286 --> 01:38:59,585
Dinu, my father's brother.

1109
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:02,918
He used to regard me
as his daughter and...

1110
01:39:05,028 --> 01:39:07,258
Where was your
mother at that time?

1111
01:39:08,031 --> 01:39:13,333
Mother was crazy by
that time. Already crazy.

1112
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:23,275
"The baton... how did
it stick to the neck?"

1113
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:26,108
You have become crazy, Chanda.

1114
01:39:26,216 --> 01:39:28,116
Mother, go inside.

1115
01:39:41,064 --> 01:39:43,464
Dinu... Why did you
come once again?

1116
01:39:43,567 --> 01:39:48,129
I am your father's brother.
Regard me as your uncle.

1117
01:39:48,338 --> 01:39:50,306
How can you speak
to me like this?

1118
01:39:50,507 --> 01:39:53,305
I have seen your brotherhood.
I have told you so many times.

1119
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:54,968
You don't need to
come here anymore.

1120
01:39:55,078 --> 01:39:58,309
Even if I do come, I
come to see your well being.

1121
01:39:58,415 --> 01:40:02,044
See, I have spoken to
the doctor upstairs.

1122
01:40:02,152 --> 01:40:04,382
Take Chanda and
have her admitted.

1123
01:40:05,088 --> 01:40:07,386
I don't want to send
mother to a mental asylum.

1124
01:40:07,491 --> 01:40:09,322
I will have her cured.

1125
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:13,386
Uncle Moti...
- Yes?

1126
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:20,067
Uncle, I am going to
get medicine for mother.

1127
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:24,004
Please take care of her.
- What is all this?

1128
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:30,168
When Kajli becomes a bride,
I will have her wear this.

1129
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,544
I can make her a bride tomorrow.

1130
01:40:32,649 --> 01:40:34,514
But she should agree, isn't it?

1131
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:40,021
How will you have her
married now? Are you crazy?

1132
01:40:40,557 --> 01:40:45,187
Let her become a doctor.
When she becomes a doctor...

1133
01:40:45,395 --> 01:40:48,364
I will give her this...
I will give her this...

1134
01:40:50,233 --> 01:40:53,532
You have ruined your
life for some doctor.

1135
01:40:54,137 --> 01:40:56,367
He must have died
a long time ago.

1136
01:40:56,473 --> 01:41:02,378
Kajli... hey, did Kajli
go to get the medicines?

1137
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:05,380
She has gone to the school,
to become a doctor.

1138
01:41:05,482 --> 01:41:07,040
What is the work?

1139
01:41:07,417 --> 01:41:11,376
The landlord has called her.
Send her when she returns.

1140
01:41:12,756 --> 01:41:19,252
That landlord! Till when
will he save her? I'll see!

1141
01:41:19,596 --> 01:41:22,394
If I cannot do it right away...

1142
01:41:47,524 --> 01:41:50,425
You? What are you doing here?

1143
01:41:54,464 --> 01:41:56,261
What do you want?

1144
01:43:49,579 --> 01:43:53,538
While I was unconscious,
he took me to the city.

1145
01:43:54,751 --> 01:44:01,623
The dark room... and... and...

1146
01:44:11,334 --> 01:44:15,566
I was sold the day
I saw brightness.

1147
01:44:16,339 --> 01:44:18,398
At Gangurani's courtesan hall.

1148
01:44:25,682 --> 01:44:27,411
What did you do?

1149
01:44:28,952 --> 01:44:31,921
If I was with my
Kajli at that time...

1150
01:45:36,853 --> 01:45:38,320
Good morning.

1151
01:45:38,421 --> 01:45:44,656
Good morning. Yes... thank you.

1152
01:45:46,696 --> 01:45:48,664
You woke up
early in the morning?

1153
01:45:49,432 --> 01:45:51,866
My days and nights
have changed due to you.

1154
01:45:55,438 --> 01:45:59,670
I sleep early in the night,
and wake up quickly in the day.

1155
01:46:00,777 --> 01:46:05,680
I felt like praying
today in the morning.

1156
01:46:06,783 --> 01:46:11,846
You should have done it.
Do you know how to?

1157
01:46:14,457 --> 01:46:16,357
I didn't learn it at all.

1158
01:46:19,062 --> 01:46:22,691
Here...
- You have it. - Take this.

1159
01:46:22,799 --> 01:46:25,359
No. I had it lighted for you.

1160
01:46:27,470 --> 01:46:28,698
You will not have it?

1161
01:46:28,805 --> 01:46:32,366
No. You don't
like it. Therefore...

1162
01:46:32,475 --> 01:46:34,705
I thought that I'd not
have it in your presence.

1163
01:46:35,478 --> 01:46:37,878
That means, you will
have it if I am not around.

1164
01:46:40,483 --> 01:46:41,711
What?

1165
01:46:42,819 --> 01:46:46,550
Nothing, I forgot.

1166
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:49,720
You will not be with me forever.

1167
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:53,558
And if I tell you that I
will be with you forever.

1168
01:46:54,764 --> 01:46:58,564
I want to keep you
with me forever, then?

1169
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:03,468
It is good for the number of
days that you are with me.

1170
01:47:04,507 --> 01:47:09,740
Don't promise me forever. I
am scared of such promises.

1171
01:47:11,514 --> 01:47:15,575
Someone had promised my
mother this once upon a time.

1172
01:47:15,785 --> 01:47:20,745
And I had promised
someone the second time.

1173
01:47:21,791 --> 01:47:23,088
Now...

1174
01:47:30,533 --> 01:47:33,434
There was so much
money here. Where is it?

1175
01:47:34,537 --> 01:47:39,440
The wallet too...
yes... I found them.

1176
01:47:40,643 --> 01:47:45,444
There was so much money... now,
there are just this much.

1177
01:47:46,649 --> 01:47:49,447
If you spend them like this,
you won't have any to return.

1178
01:47:50,086 --> 01:47:52,452
Shall I keep some
of them, carefully?

1179
01:47:56,159 --> 01:48:01,791
Kajli... many years ago, a
woman saved my money like this.

1180
01:48:02,899 --> 01:48:06,960
Even at that time, she kept
sixty rupees for my return.

1181
01:48:08,571 --> 01:48:13,474
If she wouldn't keep it, if
I wouldn't go... then... then...

1182
01:48:21,584 --> 01:48:24,485
I am feeling very strange.

1183
01:48:25,588 --> 01:48:29,490
When Kundan was here many
years ago, I felt like this.

1184
01:48:31,027 --> 01:48:34,155
Did you say something?
- No.

1185
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:15,537
Where had you gone?

1186
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,540
Are you still angry with me?

1187
01:49:20,643 --> 01:49:23,544
I committed a mistake,
forgive me.

1188
01:49:23,913 --> 01:49:25,540
I have come to take my clothes.

1189
01:49:25,648 --> 01:49:27,548
You will not get them.

1190
01:49:28,184 --> 01:49:33,884
You will not get your clothes,
salary or holiday. Nothing!

1191
01:49:35,658 --> 01:49:41,893
See, this house is yours, and
the owner of this house too.

1192
01:49:44,667 --> 01:49:46,567
I don't have anything here.

1193
01:49:47,937 --> 01:49:50,064
Nor the employer nor the house.

1194
01:49:50,673 --> 01:49:52,573
He has kept you to
look after the house.

1195
01:49:53,676 --> 01:49:55,576
You look after it.

1196
01:49:57,213 --> 01:50:03,584
You don't know why
and how we are kept?

1197
01:50:06,789 --> 01:50:08,916
Nobody gives us houses.

1198
01:50:09,125 --> 01:50:10,592
Then why have you come here?

1199
01:50:10,793 --> 01:50:12,920
To trouble a dignified man?

1200
01:50:16,799 --> 01:50:18,596
I had come here for my business.

1201
01:50:18,968 --> 01:50:22,927
And I forgot it.

1202
01:50:25,708 --> 01:50:28,609
I started looking
at him like a woman.

1203
01:50:28,978 --> 01:50:32,937
I don't know... how
this took birth within me.

1204
01:50:37,153 --> 01:50:41,283
Uncle... uncle...
please come back...

1205
01:50:41,824 --> 01:50:45,624
I will go tomorrow.

1206
01:50:49,732 --> 01:50:52,633
Your employer
won't lose anything.

1207
01:50:52,835 --> 01:50:54,962
I won't be worth anywhere.

1208
01:50:55,271 --> 01:50:57,967
Neither the house... nor...

1209
01:51:05,748 --> 01:51:07,648
Who has come at this time?

1210
01:51:07,850 --> 01:51:10,648
Get up, see.

1211
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:17,657
You? Come... come inside...

1212
01:51:21,764 --> 01:51:23,664
Have a seat.

1213
01:51:28,104 --> 01:51:30,664
Tell me. Why did you
come here at this time?

1214
01:51:30,773 --> 01:51:32,673
Your previous money
hasn't finished as yet.

1215
01:51:33,876 --> 01:51:41,408
I wanted to speak about
something. Therefore...

1216
01:51:44,787 --> 01:51:46,687
I don't know how
to tell this to you.

1217
01:51:47,790 --> 01:51:49,690
Do you want to change the girl?

1218
01:51:50,059 --> 01:51:51,686
Are you tired of Kajli?

1219
01:51:53,229 --> 01:51:56,357
You will not understand.

1220
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,697
It is like this...

1221
01:52:00,803 --> 01:52:04,705
Kajli is from a good house.

1222
01:52:06,142 --> 01:52:09,703
I want to take
her out from here.

1223
01:52:12,815 --> 01:52:18,720
Sir... nobody is good in this.
All of them are whores.

1224
01:52:18,921 --> 01:52:21,219
Yes, they do nice business.

1225
01:52:23,092 --> 01:52:27,222
Do your work, and
return the seeds to us.

1226
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:30,060
Don't try to sow them.

1227
01:52:32,935 --> 01:52:35,062
How much do you earn from Kajli?

1228
01:52:35,838 --> 01:52:37,738
How much will you earn from her?

1229
01:52:38,107 --> 01:52:40,405
And till when will
you earn from her?

1230
01:52:40,843 --> 01:52:44,074
Five years? Ten years?
Fifteen years?

1231
01:52:44,847 --> 01:52:49,079
Take all the money that you
can earn from here. From me.

1232
01:52:49,285 --> 01:52:52,413
Has Kajli sent you?
- She doesn't know about this.

1233
01:52:53,856 --> 01:52:55,756
I didn't even tell her this.

1234
01:52:57,126 --> 01:53:03,258
And I don't know how I
will tell her about this.

1235
01:53:03,399 --> 01:53:04,764
Don't be crazy, sir.

1236
01:53:06,302 --> 01:53:08,770
This is not the market of sheep.

1237
01:53:08,971 --> 01:53:13,772
My daughters live here.
You can sell your daughters.

1238
01:53:13,976 --> 01:53:15,773
I don't sell them.

1239
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,107
They are not saleable.

1240
01:53:28,891 --> 01:53:32,793
Such a amount, which you
must have just heard...

1241
01:53:32,895 --> 01:53:38,800
...but never seen in your life,
fill it. I will give it to you.

1242
01:53:40,002 --> 01:53:44,803
But give Kajli to me. I
will wait for your answer.

1243
01:54:16,038 --> 01:54:20,839
"These halted steps..."

1244
01:54:20,943 --> 01:54:26,176
"They stop and
then move ahead..."

1245
01:54:26,549 --> 01:54:30,849
"These halted steps..."

1246
01:54:30,953 --> 01:54:36,858
"They stop and
then move ahead..."

1247
01:54:36,959 --> 01:54:39,860
"At peace..."

1248
01:54:39,962 --> 01:54:46,868
"...they become restless again."

1249
01:54:46,969 --> 01:54:50,871
"These halted steps..."

1250
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:56,872
"They stop and
then move ahead..."

1251
01:54:57,079 --> 01:55:01,209
"These halted steps..."

1252
01:55:24,106 --> 01:55:33,913
"The morning didn't come... I
woke many times from my sleep."

1253
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:43,925
"The morning didn't come... I
woke many times from my sleep."

1254
01:55:44,126 --> 01:55:54,934
"I spent this whole life
in a night once again."

1255
01:55:55,037 --> 01:56:04,935
"I spent this whole life
in a night once again."

1256
01:56:05,047 --> 01:56:09,279
"These halted steps..."

1257
01:56:35,077 --> 01:56:44,975
"I had the gratitude of
the heart on my bosom..."

1258
01:56:45,087 --> 01:56:54,325
"I had the gratitude of
the heart on my bosom..."

1259
01:56:54,630 --> 01:57:05,006
"I repaid this debt to you too."

1260
01:57:05,207 --> 01:57:15,014
"I repaid this debt to you too."

1261
01:57:15,117 --> 01:57:25,015
"At peace, they
become restless again."

1262
01:57:25,227 --> 01:57:29,027
"These halted steps..."

1263
01:57:29,231 --> 01:57:35,033
"They stop and
then move ahead..."

1264
01:57:35,137 --> 01:57:40,040
"These halted steps..."

1265
01:58:14,677 --> 01:58:16,042
What is this that
you are wearing?

1266
01:58:18,247 --> 01:58:21,045
Clothes. I wear
them all the time.

1267
01:58:21,417 --> 01:58:23,544
What is so surprising in this?

1268
01:58:24,687 --> 01:58:27,053
Get up. Get up and
change your clothes.

1269
01:58:29,158 --> 01:58:32,389
See, don't order me
around like a husband.

1270
01:58:33,763 --> 01:58:38,063
I am not your wife. What
is wrong with these clothes?

1271
01:58:38,167 --> 01:58:40,067
You look vulgar
in these clothes.

1272
01:58:40,169 --> 01:58:43,400
It seems... these
clothes look so cheap.

1273
01:58:44,173 --> 01:58:46,403
Don't you know where
you have brought me from?

1274
01:58:46,509 --> 01:58:48,568
See, I don't want
to argue with you.

1275
01:58:48,711 --> 01:58:50,076
Just change your clothes.

1276
01:58:50,179 --> 01:58:52,079
Haven't you heard that phrase?

1277
01:58:52,181 --> 01:58:55,412
The crow tries to
walk like a duck.

1278
01:58:56,185 --> 01:58:58,415
I had forgotten my business.

1279
01:58:59,188 --> 01:59:01,088
I had gone to
business today therefore...

1280
01:59:01,190 --> 01:59:03,090
Where had you gone?

1281
01:59:04,193 --> 01:59:09,096
To my client. That Chaudhary.
Do you remember?

1282
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:11,428
That day... He had come...

1283
01:59:13,636 --> 01:59:16,764
Why did you go?
Why did you go out?

1284
01:59:17,807 --> 01:59:21,106
What do you lack here?
What do you lack here?

1285
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:23,107
You want money, isn't it?

1286
01:59:23,212 --> 01:59:26,113
Don't I give you money? Don't
you get money for your time?

1287
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:31,117
I know. This is the
time that you have bought.

1288
01:59:33,556 --> 01:59:39,119
I will not betray you.
I got these. Keep them.

1289
01:59:49,338 --> 01:59:51,135
Get lost. Get lost from here.

1290
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:55,142
Nothing can be done to you.
I cannot do anything.

1291
01:59:55,511 --> 01:59:59,140
You have come from the dirt.
You will remain in the dirt.

1292
01:59:59,515 --> 02:00:02,484
Mangal, give her
all her belongings.

1293
02:00:24,273 --> 02:00:26,173
What is the matter?

1294
02:00:27,376 --> 02:00:29,173
Tell me.

1295
02:00:29,545 --> 02:00:32,844
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1296
02:00:34,383 --> 02:00:36,180
I forgot my way.

1297
02:00:37,887 --> 02:00:42,847
Inside me... inside me...
a woman is still alive.

1298
02:00:44,393 --> 02:00:47,191
I thought, she had
died a long time ago.

1299
02:00:49,298 --> 02:00:51,698
But she is alive.

1300
02:00:52,568 --> 02:00:57,198
I wish to be a mother, Champa.

1301
02:00:58,641 --> 02:01:00,871
I wish to be a mother.

1302
02:01:04,914 --> 02:01:06,541
Has our Banno returned?

1303
02:01:14,924 --> 02:01:16,221
Where is Kajjo?

1304
02:01:18,327 --> 02:01:22,229
Come... come... have you
returned from your in-laws?

1305
02:01:22,865 --> 02:01:24,833
Come on, get up and sit there.

1306
02:01:24,934 --> 02:01:28,563
You look so nice in this saree.
That old man made you a bride.

1307
02:01:29,605 --> 02:01:31,232
Anyone would take you home.

1308
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:33,570
Come on. Sit on the chair.

1309
02:01:34,343 --> 02:01:37,244
The new one for nine days, and
the old one for a hundred days.

1310
02:01:37,346 --> 02:01:39,576
I am your lover
since so many years now.

1311
02:01:39,782 --> 02:01:41,249
He is here today,
he will go tomorrow.

1312
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:44,248
And I... I will be
here with you forever.

1313
02:01:44,353 --> 02:01:46,253
I have heard it,
come on... get up.

1314
02:01:46,455 --> 02:01:49,253
That pimp has made
you so arrogant.

1315
02:01:49,892 --> 02:01:52,588
You must be the pimp. Your
father doesn't feed him.

1316
02:01:52,795 --> 02:01:54,262
Don't you dare abuse him.

1317
02:01:59,368 --> 02:02:02,269
A woman worth two
bits. She slaps me?

1318
02:02:02,371 --> 02:02:03,599
What did you say?

1319
02:02:03,706 --> 02:02:05,867
Get lost from here...

1320
02:02:05,975 --> 02:02:07,272
Will you hit me?

1321
02:02:07,376 --> 02:02:10,277
Will you?

1322
02:02:10,379 --> 02:02:13,280
Come on!

1323
02:02:30,933 --> 02:02:32,298
What happened?

1324
02:02:34,403 --> 02:02:36,303
He was abusing.

1325
02:02:36,405 --> 02:02:38,305
Whom?

1326
02:02:38,407 --> 02:02:39,635
Him.

1327
02:02:39,842 --> 02:02:41,969
With whom I stay nowadays.

1328
02:02:42,511 --> 02:02:44,638
Is he your husband?

1329
02:02:46,515 --> 02:02:49,313
No. I am not related to him.

1330
02:02:49,418 --> 02:02:51,318
But who is
Chaudhary to abuse him?

1331
02:02:52,421 --> 02:02:54,321
But why did you feel so bad?

1332
02:02:55,958 --> 02:02:58,324
I never saw you so
angry ever before.

1333
02:02:58,427 --> 02:03:01,328
I never met anyone
before this too.

1334
02:03:01,964 --> 02:03:04,330
Nobody gave me such dignity too.

1335
02:03:06,035 --> 02:03:11,667
For the first time,
someone saw me like a woman.

1336
02:03:12,708 --> 02:03:18,840
Not like a courtesan. He
didn't even touch me till now.

1337
02:03:19,548 --> 02:03:27,353
Aunty, he really loves me.
I can't tolerate his love.

1338
02:03:27,556 --> 02:03:32,687
Kajli, does he love you...

1339
02:03:33,462 --> 02:03:35,362
...or do you love him?

1340
02:03:36,565 --> 02:03:38,362
Even you have changed a lot.

1341
02:03:42,571 --> 02:03:44,368
See, child...

1342
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:48,369
The steps of these halls
don't lead to any house.

1343
02:03:49,478 --> 02:03:51,378
I have never seen
any woman settle...

1344
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:53,380
...down after leaving
these courtesan halls.

1345
02:03:55,584 --> 02:03:58,712
I haven't seen
such guts in any man.

1346
02:03:59,588 --> 02:04:02,386
Whoever comes,
comes all excited.

1347
02:04:03,492 --> 02:04:06,393
When the excitement is over...

1348
02:04:07,763 --> 02:04:12,393
But for the first time... I
saw a man to be so truthful.

1349
02:04:13,769 --> 02:04:15,396
Such truth in his words...

1350
02:04:16,839 --> 02:04:20,400
That old man...
with whom you reside.

1351
02:04:21,510 --> 02:04:25,742
He came to me too.
To pay for you.

1352
02:04:26,515 --> 02:04:29,746
He came here?

1353
02:04:30,619 --> 02:04:34,077
Yes. And he gave me
this blank cheque.

1354
02:04:35,524 --> 02:04:37,424
Told me to write
off anything in it.

1355
02:04:38,627 --> 02:04:40,424
This hasn't happened
ever in life, child.

1356
02:04:42,531 --> 02:04:47,434
But even if one person
does it once out of millions...

1357
02:04:47,536 --> 02:04:51,438
...I will think that you
and I have done our duty.

1358
02:04:53,075 --> 02:04:59,173
If he takes you as
his own, go. Go away.

1359
02:05:00,082 --> 02:05:04,451
I don't want anything, I
don't want anything at all.

1360
02:05:09,825 --> 02:05:17,459
Champa, should I go?
Should I go away?

1361
02:05:19,668 --> 02:05:22,967
Once... just once...

1362
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:28,469
I want to be a complete woman...

1363
02:05:29,678 --> 02:05:32,806
I don't want to be incomplete...

1364
02:05:33,582 --> 02:05:35,812
I don't want to be incomplete...

1365
02:08:36,198 --> 02:08:38,325
Who? Who is it?

1366
02:08:38,767 --> 02:08:40,667
Your Kajli...

1367
02:08:50,779 --> 02:08:54,681
You? Why have you come here?

1368
02:08:55,217 --> 02:08:56,684
What have you come here for now?

1369
02:08:57,886 --> 02:09:02,687
To love you. To
give myself to you.

1370
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:15,028
Have you seen
anything ahead of this body?

1371
02:09:15,804 --> 02:09:19,035
Thought about it? Recognized it?

1372
02:09:25,814 --> 02:09:28,044
Did your mother give
birth to you for this day?

1373
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:30,716
Did she give birth to
you for this market?

1374
02:09:32,921 --> 02:09:35,048
It is good that Chanda
went away before all this.

1375
02:09:41,263 --> 02:09:42,730
Chanda?

1376
02:09:42,931 --> 02:09:45,058
If she wasn't mad
for that doctor...

1377
02:09:45,267 --> 02:09:46,734
...she would have
been mad for you.

1378
02:09:46,835 --> 02:09:48,735
You would have made her mad.

1379
02:09:51,373 --> 02:09:53,739
Chanda wanted to make you this?

1380
02:09:53,842 --> 02:09:55,742
She wanted to see you like this?

1381
02:10:00,115 --> 02:10:02,743
You know this, isn't it?
Don't you recognize it?

1382
02:10:09,124 --> 02:10:12,355
This... all this... these
veils, this vermillion...

1383
02:10:12,461 --> 02:10:13,758
Don't you know all this?

1384
02:10:15,397 --> 02:10:17,092
She accumulated dowry even in...

1385
02:10:17,199 --> 02:10:19,759
...her madness to
see you as a bride.

1386
02:10:19,968 --> 02:10:21,765
And you...

1387
02:10:43,158 --> 02:10:46,457
You want to ask
who I am, isn't it?

1388
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:51,788
I am that same doctor.
Dr. Amar Nath.

1389
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,798
You want to avenge
your mother from him.

1390
02:10:55,904 --> 02:11:01,137
Tell me. What do you
want in revenge? Tell me!

1391
02:11:11,186 --> 02:11:12,813
No...

1392
02:11:15,924 --> 02:11:17,824
No...

1393
02:11:19,261 --> 02:11:20,819
No...

1394
02:11:57,499 --> 02:11:58,864
Mangal...
- Yes, sir?

1395
02:12:06,408 --> 02:12:07,875
Here...

1396
02:13:16,044 --> 02:13:18,945
Why did you come back?

1397
02:13:23,051 --> 02:13:24,951
Do you want something from me?

1398
02:13:28,056 --> 02:13:29,956
What do you have in your hand?

1399
02:13:31,059 --> 02:13:33,960
What are you hiding? Show me...

1400
02:13:55,517 --> 02:13:57,985
Him... you are the one, isn't it?

1401
02:13:58,620 --> 02:14:01,316
You made my mother
wait for twenty years?

1402
02:14:02,624 --> 02:14:06,720
You are the one, for
whom my mother went crazy?

1403
02:14:10,098 --> 02:14:12,999
For whom her whole
life was ruined.

1404
02:14:14,202 --> 02:14:17,501
Neither did she survive,
and nor me.

1405
02:14:18,206 --> 02:14:22,006
Even I was sold in
the market for you.

1406
02:14:23,211 --> 02:14:27,011
It is your fault.
It is your fault.

1407
02:14:28,116 --> 02:14:36,023
Mother will never forgive you.
She will never forgive you.

1408
02:14:39,728 --> 02:14:46,361
Yes, child. Chanda
will never forgive me.

1409
02:14:47,736 --> 02:14:56,041
But my Kajli can
forgive me? I know.

1410
02:14:56,578 --> 02:14:59,706
I have erred. I am a sinner.

1411
02:15:01,149 --> 02:15:03,379
Therefore, I came
to you repeatedly.

1412
02:15:11,159 --> 02:15:14,060
To ask for my
repentance from you, child.

1413
02:15:19,167 --> 02:15:22,068
Please forgive me, child...

1414
02:15:27,776 --> 02:15:29,403
Will you come with me?

1415
02:15:32,447 --> 02:15:36,406
We don't have anything to
turn and look back, child.

1416
02:15:38,186 --> 02:15:41,417
Come with me... come on...
