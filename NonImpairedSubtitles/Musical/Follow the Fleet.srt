1
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:06,589
Hey, listen, if you and your
nautical nitwits...

2
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:09,596
...are gonna give the girls their
big break, better shove off.

3
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,256
- We've dropped anchor.
- We have?

4
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:20,877
Say, will you guys let me forget
I was once a hoofer?

5
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,813
It sure seems swell to be getting back
where the women talk your own language.

6
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:29,748
You bet. it's gonna be great
to be able to talk to a dame...

7
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,820
...without using your hands.

8
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:51,806
Hey, you been holding out on me.
I didn't know you had a girl in your act.

9
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:55,243
- Give me that.
- Wait a minute.

10
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:58,745
That's why you joined the Navy.
You thought a torpedo would be easier...

11
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,384
- ...to dodge than a shotgun.
- Don't be funny.

12
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,180
- I asked that little girl to marry me.
- What?

13
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,345
Yeah, and she turned me down.

14
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:09,515
Imagine a guy asking a dame to marry.

15
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:12,059
Say, what's become of her?

16
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,595
Oh, I heard from her
when we were down in Manila.

17
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:17,165
She's working here in Frisco.

18
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,394
Well. Maybe she's got a friend.
Let's go see her.

19
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,334
No, we're all washed up.

20
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:24,906
- Say, give me that picture.
- What do you want it for?

21
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,543
I thought you said
you were all washed up.

22
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,941
Oh, I just kept it
because I came out so good.

23
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:35,610
Lay aft for the 4:00 liberty party.

24
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:05,139
Boy, I hope I pick
something good this time.

25
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:06,976
I'm always getting schoolteachers.

26
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,482
Why not?
You got a lot to learn yet.

27
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:14,317
I want something with spangles on it,
like that ex-partner of yours.

28
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:15,719
Say, let's find her.

29
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:18,053
She probably wouldn't
even speak to me anymore.

30
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:21,629
The last letter from her, she said she
was working in a high-class spot...

31
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,393
- ...where all the money goes.
- Yeah? Well, that's the way it is.

32
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,697
Listen, you mugs, don't forget
that liberty expires at 12:00.

33
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:29,896
We've got our orders.

34
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:31,765
Needn't wait up tonight, Mother.

35
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:34,433
We're going to Paradise.

36
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,583
Six admissions, please.

37
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:53,195
- Do you want any dance tickets?
- Dance tickets?

38
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,854
- How much are they?
- Three for 25.

39
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,927
- Give me one.
- one?

40
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,035
Yeah, to see if I like it.

41
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,194
What's the matter?
Don't your friends dance?

42
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:05,000
They're underage.
I hold them on my lap.

43
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:11,440
- Hey, Bake, where's Bilge?
- He stopped off to buy the beer.

44
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,413
He knows a place where you get
3 cents back on the bottles.

45
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,017
Hi, tiny.

46
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:24,325
I'll see you fellows. I gotta look
up a party in the telephone book.

47
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,197
Hello? information?

48
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,899
Look, I want to get the number
of a Miss Sherry Martin.

49
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:43,740
She lives at 610 Hyde Street.

50
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:46,280
Yeah, all right.

51
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:54,647
Sorry, miss,
it's the rules of the Paradise.

52
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:57,055
No girls are allowed in without escorts.

53
00:07:57,594 --> 00:08:01,997
I see. Women aren't even admitted
to paradise without a man.

54
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:03,831
Yeah.

55
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:08,971
Oh, there you are.

56
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,267
Don't bother. Your hands are full.
I'll get the tickets for us.

57
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,273
Two, please.

58
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:20,645
I'll explain to you when we get inside.

59
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,552
Did you bring your lunch too?

60
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:34,762
Thank you. You see,
I wanted to get in to see my sister.

61
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,764
She works here, and they wouldn't
let me in without an escort.

62
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,959
I thought you were trying to frame me.

63
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:42,537
Oh, no. You see,
I've never been here before.

64
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:45,504
My sister's asked me to come down.
I've never been able to.

65
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:50,476
I've always been so busy, but, well,
tonight I just felt like a little spree.

66
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,615
Well, I hope you find it.

67
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,944
I've sort of been playing hooky
all day today.

68
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,386
I spent the afternoon
watching the fleet come in.

69
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:04,959
Oh, gee, it was exciting.
If I were a man, I'd be a sailor.

70
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,528
Yeah, I know just how you feel.

71
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:18,268
They're pretty, aren't they?

72
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:21,377
I'll bet you're used to seeing
pretty girls all over the world.

73
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:25,242
I never give them a tumble, sister.
Women don't interest me.

74
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,016
I'll bet you dance beautifully.

75
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,857
No, not a step.

76
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:39,223
Well, I gotta be shoving off. So long.

77
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:41,864
- Come to Papa.
- You sure work fast, Bilge.

78
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:43,932
- Yeah, we're the slow ones.
- Lay off me.

79
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:49,564
Where did you pick up
that awful-looking crow?

80
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,570
She picked me up.
I think she's screwy.

81
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:54,266
She must be
if she tried to pick you up.

82
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:59,973
- Well, what will you have?
- Six clean glasses.

83
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:15,830
- Who is it?
- Connie.

84
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,194
Oh, Connie, come in.

85
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,061
I'm glad to see you. How'd you get away?
What about your music lessons?

86
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:25,504
I didn't feel like giving them,
so I just called up and said I was ill.

87
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:27,802
I guess it's just a touch
of spring fever.

88
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:31,209
This is a funny time to be having
spring fever, in october.

89
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,872
Well, things usually happen
to me out of season.

90
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:37,251
Connie, why don't you admit it.
You're lonesome.

91
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,584
Some men aren't half bad.

92
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,595
I don't know why.
I just seem to frighten them away.

93
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,024
You look too darned intelligent.

94
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,101
It isn't that gentlemen prefer blonds...

95
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,465
...it's just that we look dumber.

96
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,129
Maybe that's it.

97
00:10:57,307 --> 00:11:00,105
It used to end up by my saying
I'd be a sister to them.

98
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:03,269
Now it begins by their saying
they'll be a brother to me.

99
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:04,970
That's the difference between us.

100
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:06,638
I make them say uncle.

101
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:09,751
Well, I can understand that.
You're attractive.

102
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,821
Connie, women weren't born
with silk stockings on, you know.

103
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:15,048
Well, I wear silk stockings.

104
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,816
And no one looks at them.

105
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:23,558
Well, men haven't x-ray eyes.

106
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,196
Though sometimes I wonder.

107
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,569
Gee, you must look lovely in this.

108
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:33,971
And so could you, if you wanted to.

109
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,078
Things have got to be
dolled up nowadays.

110
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,771
That's why they put brass on battleships.

111
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,180
Why don't you let me try to fix you up?

112
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,980
You'll be amazed how much
better it'll make you feel.

113
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,651
Even though I'm not a blond,
I could be dumb, couldn't I?

114
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,759
And you'll probably do all right too.

115
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,862
It takes a lot of brains to be dumb.
Let's try it.

116
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,959
Hey, Kitty!

117
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:14,411
Connie, this is Kitty Collins.
Kitty, this is my sister.

118
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:15,983
- How do you do?
- Hiya.

119
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,313
Will you fix her up?

120
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,218
Well, I'll do what I can, Sherry.

121
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:23,055
I've got to go on.

122
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,560
I'll be back after the number.

123
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:28,425
And remember the old saying,
"Clothes make the man."

124
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,733
Do you have to wear these?

125
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,370
Oh, no. I just wear them
to impress my pupils.

126
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,665
I'll bet they're impressed.

127
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:44,172
Nobody'd ever take you
for Sherry's sister.

128
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,644
I guess not.

129
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:49,273
I've spent most of my life up the coast
in a little town called Bellport...

130
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:50,976
...while Sherry's been here.

131
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:48,429
Sherry!

132
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,108
- Bake!
- Sherry!

133
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,049
Well, what a surprise seeing you here!

134
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,092
Yeah. I'm kind of surprised
to see you here too.

135
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,963
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.

136
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:19,726
I'm glad to see you too.

137
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:24,933
Say, you better do something
for that cold.

138
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:27,507
Oh, this isn't a cold.

139
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,636
It's tears because
I'm so glad to see you.

140
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,417
I'm glad to see you too.

141
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,712
Thanks.

142
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,455
I've missed you, Bake.

143
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:43,292
I've missed you too.

144
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,120
A little bit.

145
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,499
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.

146
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:58,936
Same here.

147
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:02,737
I worried about you for two years
until I learned you'd joined the Navy.

148
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,812
Didn't you ever get my letter?

149
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:07,245
Oh, sure, I heard from you, all right.

150
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:10,750
Telling me about how well
you were doing and everything.

151
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:14,723
Why didn't you write to me?

152
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:17,919
I didn't think you cared
about hearing from me.

153
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:20,961
Especially after that last time
we saw each other.

154
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:24,265
Well, all I said was
I didn't want to marry you.

155
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:26,467
Yeah, I know.

156
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,099
It all seemed very important at that time.

157
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:33,031
But it doesn't make any difference now.

158
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:37,677
Doesn't it?

159
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:41,783
No. As you said, marriage
would have ruined your career.

160
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,345
Well, I found out I was wrong.

161
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:47,750
No, maybe you're right.

162
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,451
If you'd married me, you wouldn't
be working in a chop-suey joint like this.

163
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,824
Well, I don't see
any admiral's stripes on you.

164
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:01,633
I like to go incognito,
just to mingle with the boys.

165
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,506
Order, please.

166
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:08,168
I want a Coke.

167
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:11,575
And Miss Martin will have a chocolate
sundae without whipped cream.

168
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:14,774
With whipped cream, and plenty of it.

169
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,544
Gosh, you're glad to see me.

170
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,531
Well, you sure look different.

171
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:32,834
Don't I?

172
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:35,730
I'm beginning to feel different.

173
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,449
Kitty, there's a sailor I want to meet.
How do I go about it?

174
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,315
Are you kidding?

175
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,979
No. I mean, are there any rules?

176
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,853
Well, yes and no.

177
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:58,994
"Yes" before you meet him...

178
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,857
...and "no" after.

179
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,128
Gosh, Sherry, how'd you
ever get in a place like this?

180
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:11,597
Well, it seems I didn't mean
much after we split up.

181
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,970
For some reason, they're not
interested in a girl dancing alone...

182
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,977
...unless she's got a fan.

183
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:21,139
Well, a fan doesn't cost much.

184
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,248
Gee, it's swell being with you again.

185
00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:29,955
Friends?

186
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,693
- Friends.
- Let's kiss and make up.

187
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:36,589
No, let's just make up.
That'll give you something to work for.

188
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:44,698
Why don't you guys take a walk.

189
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,597
Hiya, baby.

190
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:10,460
Hello, sailor.

191
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,760
- So you know my name.
- Sure.

192
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,766
Haven't we met before?

193
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,496
That's what I should have said.

194
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:19,937
No, but haven't we?

195
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,608
Not a chance.
Think I could forget a face like yours?

196
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,077
Well, I must have been mistaken.

197
00:19:29,352 --> 00:19:31,286
But we're meeting now.
Wanna dance?

198
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,489
Oh, I was under the impression
that you didn't dance.

199
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,187
Who, me?

200
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,521
I'm the heavyweight
dance champ of the fleet.

201
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:42,995
You've got me up
against the ropes here.

202
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,929
Maybe we better sit this one out.

203
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,363
Sure.

204
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,337
This is a lucky night for me, baby.
You're just my type of girl.

205
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,068
Oh, really?

206
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:01,844
I thought you were the kind of man
who never gives girls a tumble.

207
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:06,044
You've got some
very funny ideas about me.

208
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:09,885
Oh, I admit I've been around.
But I've never met one like you, baby.

209
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,188
No, I guess you haven't.

210
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,838
Hey, what's the idea?

211
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:28,904
It's a line of defense.

212
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,110
Well, watch my maneuvers.

213
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,814
You can't beat the Navy.

214
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,713
All right, sailor. I surrender.

215
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:41,857
Unconditionally?

216
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:44,458
Well, I'm willing to discuss terms.

217
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:46,686
Okay, baby. Let's get out of here.

218
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:50,128
Let's find someplace where we can talk.

219
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,640
I'll go ransom my hat
and meet you at the back exit.

220
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,640
And don't walk out on me.

221
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:05,490
- Where's Connie?
- Dropped in a minute ago...

222
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:08,159
...and said she was leaving,
for you not to worry.

223
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:11,500
Poor kid. I'll bet she was scared
with all these sailors around.

224
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,107
Thanks.

225
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:14,834
All right, everybody.

226
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:16,376
And now, as you know...

227
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:20,538
...the Paradise Club holds its popular
Saturday night dance contest.

228
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:23,651
Mr. Weber will tap the shoulders
of the eliminated couples...

229
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,084
...and as usual, your applause
will decide the winners.

230
00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:28,848
I thank you.

231
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,424
- Kind of neat, huh?
- Kind of.

232
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:20,603
Listen, my enlistment's up in the spring.

233
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:25,839
Then we'll pick up where we left off,
only this time you'll ask me to marry you.

234
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,976
The Navy must be a wonderful institution.

235
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,848
It produces such a modest,
shrinking type of man.

236
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:34,785
Yeah, doesn't it?

237
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:43,559
Go away.

238
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,797
How do you like that?

239
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:48,869
On my dime, he wants to cut in.

240
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:59,876
The village cutups.

241
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,983
Wait a minute.
This is the dance contest.

242
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,278
- Is it?
- I'm not supposed to be in it.

243
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:06,614
- Why not?
- Because it's for guests.

244
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:08,620
Well, I'm a guest. Ten cents' worth.

245
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:10,923
No, I don't think I'd better.

246
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,460
Maybe you're right. You probably couldn't
keep up with me anymore anyway.

247
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,589
You think not? Well, I'm not so
sure you could keep up with me.

248
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:31,424
Gosh, you've kind of taken
the wind out of my sails.

249
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:35,085
There aren't any sails these days, baby.
Just steam, full steam ahead.

250
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,595
Come on, let me get you
something to eat.

251
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:40,530
- Don't tell me you can cook too.
- oh, yes.

252
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:43,364
You don't know the kind
of person I really am.

253
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:45,904
Well, you've given me a faint idea.

254
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:50,010
Oh, boy.

255
00:28:50,178 --> 00:28:53,443
Say, I haven't seen the inside
of an icebox since I left home.

256
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:54,912
Where is your home?

257
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,550
Texas.

258
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,078
I've been back once or twice
to see my mother.

259
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:02,348
- She never knows when I'm gonna turn up.
- Don't you ever write her?

260
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:05,015
I'm no good at writing.
Don't know what to say.

261
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:06,820
You could say you love her.

262
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,054
What's the use? She knows that.

263
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,957
Custard pie.

264
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:16,467
- Now, don't tell me you made this too.
- I made it.

265
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:20,665
Sweetheart, you've got everything.
I knew it from the first minute I saw you.

266
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:24,906
- Bilge, I've got to tell you the truth.
- About what?

267
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,173
Well, the first time you saw me,
you acted as my escort.

268
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:32,014
Remember the funny-looking girl
with glasses who bought your ticket?

269
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,950
- Yeah.
- Well, that was me.

270
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:41,090
Well, what was the getup for?

271
00:29:41,262 --> 00:29:43,253
It wasn't a getup.

272
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:47,595
Until tonight, those were the kind
of clothes I wore. That was the real me.

273
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:54,805
Well, how do you like that?

274
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,172
But that doesn't make any difference.
I'm nuts about you anyway.

275
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:01,812
Say, Connie, what are you?

276
00:30:01,983 --> 00:30:03,575
A teacher.

277
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:05,979
I knew it.

278
00:30:07,822 --> 00:30:09,380
Yes, a music teacher.

279
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:12,856
Well, that ain't so bad.

280
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,098
Oh, Miss Martin, I want to speak to you.

281
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:25,763
Mr. Weber, I want you to meet
Mr. Baker, a friend of mine.

282
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,271
Mr. Baker is a guest.

283
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:29,410
- Oh, how do you do?
- How are you?

284
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,306
Mr. Weber owns the Paradise Club.

285
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,673
Is that so?

286
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:35,307
Not a bad little spot
you got here, Mr. Weber.

287
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:37,144
It isn't right for Miss Martin though.

288
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:39,286
She's used to working
in a nicer atmosphere.

289
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,613
Oh, you don't like this atmosphere.

290
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:45,755
It's all right for some people...

291
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,622
...but not for Miss Martin.

292
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:49,390
And who are you?

293
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,957
Me? I'm her manager.

294
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:56,626
I see. Well, I think you'd better
go manage her somewhere else.

295
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:58,999
Beginning right now.

296
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:01,641
Pick up your salary
in the morning, Miss Martin.

297
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,737
Good night.

298
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:08,204
Well, I fixed that.

299
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:10,408
You fixed me.

300
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,782
I did that on purpose. I don't want you
working in a place like this.

301
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,083
I'll take you to see Jim Nolan.
I'll get him to put you in his show.

302
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:19,658
- He'll do that.
- It might have been better to wait...

303
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:21,488
...until we were sure.

304
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:23,560
Now, I'll take care of everything.

305
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:26,131
That's exactly what's worrying me.

306
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,698
Bilge, how long are
you going to be here?

307
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:32,703
We're having war games.
We don't know.

308
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:36,071
- Maybe in a week. Maybe tonight.
- oh, no.

309
00:31:36,544 --> 00:31:38,671
Don't you worry.
We'll be back in the spring.

310
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:41,406
The night the fleet arrives
you and me have got a date.

311
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,710
- Honest?
- The minute we hit port.

312
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:48,352
- Soon after that, I'm out of the Navy.
- Really? What are you going to do then?

313
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:49,888
Gonna stick to the sea.

314
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:51,889
Oh, I love the sea too.

315
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,119
My father was a sea captain.

316
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:56,224
You know, that's what I want to be.

317
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:58,524
I'm taking my chief petty
officer exams now.

318
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,534
Then I'm going to try for my master's
papers in hopes that I can get a ship.

319
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:08,300
Bilge, I've got a ship.

320
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:10,844
- What?
- Yes, come here.

321
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:19,152
Here it is.

322
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,548
It's a model of the real one.
It was my dad's ship.

323
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:27,292
He died of a broken heart when
she ran aground off the north coast.

324
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:30,859
I wouldn't want my ship
to run aground either.

325
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,728
Dad left my sister Sherry
what little money he had.

326
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:36,927
And he left me the ship because
he knew how much she meant to me.

327
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:38,663
Boy, she's a beauty.

328
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,742
I've always had dreams of sailing on her
again as I did when I was a kid.

329
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,209
A steam schooner,
just the kind I like to feel under me.

330
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,544
Baby, I'd like to be captain of your ship.

331
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:55,582
I wanna sail under my own steam to
China, India and those spiggoty ports.

332
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:57,190
So do I.

333
00:32:57,358 --> 00:33:00,350
I've always wanted to sail on her
to all those spiggoty places...

334
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:02,792
...with my husband at the helm.

335
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:10,966
- Holy cat.
- What's the matter?

336
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:14,131
I gotta be going.
Gotta be back on board by 12:00.

337
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:16,770
- Oh, gee.
- Sorry.

338
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:19,776
Well...

339
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,855
Hello, Connie. ls Sherry home?

340
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:32,954
Not yet. She's a
little later than usual.

341
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:36,290
What's happened to you, Connie?
You look swell.

342
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:42,594
May I present Mr. Smith. A friend
of my sister's, Mrs. Manning.

343
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,529
How do you do?

344
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:46,195
How do you do?

345
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:50,105
- I'm sorry to have broken in like this.
- oh, no, that's all right. Don't go.

346
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,509
Mr. Smith was just leaving.
He has to be back on ship by 12.

347
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:56,878
I can't stay. I have an engagement,
but tell Sherry I dropped in.

348
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:58,382
Good night, dear.

349
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,348
Good night, Mr. Smith.

350
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:02,455
Good night.

351
00:34:07,061 --> 00:34:09,962
I wish you didn't have to leave, Bilge,
but maybe you'd better.

352
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,928
Yeah, I guess so.

353
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,898
If you're still here tomorrow night,
will I see you?

354
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:16,969
Will you.

355
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:26,547
- Tell the admiral not to go away.
- I'll do that. Good night, baby.

356
00:34:26,714 --> 00:34:29,683
Good night.

357
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,256
Mr. Smith.

358
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:47,924
Hello.

359
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:52,896
I'm going that way anyway, so I thought
I might drop you off at the dock.

360
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:56,339
Thanks, that'll help me out a lot.

361
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:22,516
I'll be up to get you
the first thing in the

362
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:24,564
morning and we'll go see Nolan together.

363
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:27,299
- Here.
- Thanks.

364
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,468
Can't you come up for a while?

365
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:35,082
I'm sorry, Sherry. I've only got a minute.
I've got to be back on board by 12:00.

366
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:38,908
Good night.

367
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:47,255
Good night.

368
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,592
Good night.

369
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,102
Haven't you got a home?

370
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:06,608
Turn in all liberty cards.

371
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:10,273
All liberty has been cancelled.
We have immediate sailing orders.

372
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,981
Turn in all liberty cards.

373
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:16,146
All liberty has been cancelled.
We have immediate sailing orders.

374
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:20,556
Sailing orders? Listen,
I've got to get ashore.

375
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:22,042
I've started something
I've got to finish.

376
00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:23,356
Yeah?

377
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:26,022
Maybe you're lucky we're sailing.

378
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:28,698
Put it in.

379
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,952
I've got to go to bed, Connie.
I can't keep my eyes open any longer.

380
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,923
Yes, it's late.

381
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:57,962
Sherry, how much does
a chief petty officer get?

382
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:02,794
Whatever he told you,
just cut it in half.

383
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:09,175
Give me a chance. Let me talk
about Bake for a while, will you?

384
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,971
Excuse me, darling, you go right ahead.

385
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:17,275
Of course, he would make more as
master of his own ship, wouldn't he?

386
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,414
I'll bet he's by far the
best dancer in the Navy.

387
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,183
Yes, that's what he told me.

388
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,955
Who?

389
00:37:28,796 --> 00:37:31,765
You're talking about Bake.

390
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,827
It's swell, Sherry, isn't it?

391
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,834
Isn't it?

392
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,354
- What's the matter?
- Bilge must have been right.

393
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:03,222
About what?

394
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:05,695
Well, he said they might
have to leave anytime...

395
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,766
...but it's sooner than I expected.

396
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:10,301
Who has to leave? What? Where?

397
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:12,200
The fleet.

398
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,237
The fleet?

399
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,017
Why, the dirty, double-crossing...

400
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,356
What's going on?

401
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:35,961
Dance team.

402
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,269
Stand clear, fellows.
Give everybody a chance to read it.

403
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,356
Well, where is Bake?

404
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:06,824
Professor Baker will commence
dancing class just as soon as he...

405
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:09,293
...finishes painting the mainmast.

406
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,076
When you weren't back
by 2 this morning...

407
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:17,712
...I had to think up some alibi.

408
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,145
I told the quartermaster you stayed
with your mother who was very sick.

409
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,081
When the officer of the deck
asked me where my mother was...

410
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:26,380
...I said she was home in Texas.

411
00:39:26,956 --> 00:39:29,982
Well, how did I know you
were going to be so dumb?

412
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:34,190
I can understand them making you do this,
but why do they have to pick on me?

413
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:36,923
What kept you out so late anyway?

414
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:39,533
A very charming young lady,
with loads of dough.

415
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:42,262
She was in show business
too, before she got married.

416
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:46,374
But her husband didn't understand her,
so the poor kid had to go to Reno.

417
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,667
Poor kid. I bet the chorus miss her.

418
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,837
She still sees them.
There's nothing snooty about her.

419
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,815
What about that teacher that was going
to make you captain of her ship?

420
00:39:56,986 --> 00:39:59,614
She's a swell kid too,
but she's kind of serious.

421
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:02,052
She's sappy like you.
She wants to get married.

422
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,925
I beg your pardon.

423
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:10,688
One, two, three.
one, two, three. Try it.

424
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:15,200
One, two, three. one, two, three.
one, two, three.

425
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,033
Now the left arm up.
one, two, three.

426
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:23,372
Right arm around the lady's waist.
one, two, three. Now smile.

427
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,411
One, two, three. All right.

428
00:40:26,982 --> 00:40:29,075
Let's see if you can
remember what I told you.

429
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:32,618
Now, you fellows get over there.
You're the dames.

430
00:40:32,788 --> 00:40:34,380
Dames? What's the big idea?

431
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:37,614
You asked me to teach you
how to dance, didn't you?

432
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:40,591
All right then, you're dames.
You fellows are their partners.

433
00:40:40,762 --> 00:40:43,754
All right, music.
Now get together.

434
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:48,359
Come on, get together, get together.

435
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:53,406
One, two, three. one, two, three.
one, two, three.

436
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:58,242
Don't be bashful. Grab them tight.

437
00:40:58,413 --> 00:41:01,610
One, two, three. one, two, three.
That's better. one, two, three.

438
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:05,275
Hey, Bake, nobody will dance with me.

439
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:08,821
That's too bad.

440
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:13,183
Keep it up, fellows,
while I dance with the wallflower.

441
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:19,898
Hey!

442
00:41:21,036 --> 00:41:24,005
You know, there's a difference
between dancing and wrestling.

443
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:27,938
In dancing, the main idea is to keep
your partner's shoulders off the floor.

444
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,943
I was taught to dance collegiate.

445
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,445
Oh, that's different.

446
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,788
Let's cut in.

447
00:41:57,539 --> 00:41:58,836
Hey, Marines.

448
00:42:21,763 --> 00:42:23,628
May I have the pleasure?

449
00:42:30,439 --> 00:42:32,999
Dancing class dismissed!

450
00:42:43,518 --> 00:42:47,818
What I can't understand, Miss Connie,
is why you want a floater.

451
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:50,321
A girl can't handle a ship herself.

452
00:42:50,492 --> 00:42:53,325
No, but she may be able
to get a man to do it for her.

453
00:42:54,396 --> 00:42:58,230
Well, I went over the ship
like you asked me to, and...

454
00:42:59,234 --> 00:43:01,464
There's lots to be done.
It'll cost quite a bit.

455
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:03,900
Well, I've saved up about 600 dollars.

456
00:43:04,072 --> 00:43:05,539
And I'll add 400...

457
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:09,473
...which I got convoying the Navy around
the dance floor on my feet.

458
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:14,479
Even at that, I'm afraid 1000 dollars
would hardly be enough.

459
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:19,477
But I'll tell the company
what nice girls...

460
00:43:19,654 --> 00:43:22,953
...my old friend Captain Martin's
daughters are...

461
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,990
...and we'll see what we can do.

462
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,094
Thank you, Captain Hickey.

463
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:30,698
If you don't mind my saying so,
I think he's a very lucky young man.

464
00:43:30,866 --> 00:43:35,064
Actually, Captain Hickey, I consider
this whole thing a business proposition.

465
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:39,571
Don't you believe it, Captain Hickey.
Little Red Riding Hood rides again.

466
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:51,619
I hear the old man is entertaining
a party of big shots this afternoon.

467
00:43:51,787 --> 00:43:55,086
- That's the reason for the dress whites.
- Yeah.

468
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,657
Hey, Bake.
I just got word I passed my exams.

469
00:43:57,826 --> 00:44:00,488
No kidding, Bilge!
Gee, that's swell. Congratulations.

470
00:44:00,662 --> 00:44:02,357
- Thanks.
- I knew you'd make it.

471
00:44:02,531 --> 00:44:06,126
I know you don't care to be taken on
a tour of inspection, Courtney.

472
00:44:06,301 --> 00:44:08,701
But I'd like to have you
glance over the ship...

473
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,430
- ...and look at our men.
- We'd love to, Captain Jones.

474
00:44:11,606 --> 00:44:14,166
If it won't trouble you, Jones,
we'd enjoy it immensely.

475
00:44:14,342 --> 00:44:16,902
Mr. Gilbert, my party
will look about the ship.

476
00:44:17,078 --> 00:44:19,876
See that attention is sounded.
Have the band play a march.

477
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:21,413
Aye, aye, sir.

478
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:25,815
How about breaking up this sewing circle,
and getting into a jam session?

479
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:27,716
Are you ready?

480
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:16,869
- Your men are very smart, lieutenant.
- Thank you, sir.

481
00:45:32,854 --> 00:45:34,412
- Mr. Gilbert.
- Yes, sir.

482
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:35,937
Have that jazz band
stop playing at once.

483
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:37,285
Aye, aye, sir.

484
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:41,089
Silence!

485
00:45:41,263 --> 00:45:44,699
Baker, are you aware the captain is
showing some guests around the ship...

486
00:45:44,866 --> 00:45:46,993
...and that attention has been sounded?

487
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:50,695
I'm sorry, sir. We didn't
hear the call. We were playing.

488
00:45:53,575 --> 00:45:57,067
Captain, the orchestra was playing
and none of the men heard the call.

489
00:45:57,245 --> 00:45:59,839
I'm satisfied, sir, they intend
no breach of discipline.

490
00:46:00,015 --> 00:46:02,006
- Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.
- Aye, aye, sir.

491
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,651
Captain Jones. Would you think it a
breach of discipline if I asked you...

492
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:09,517
...to let them play for us?
I do so adore American music.

493
00:46:11,426 --> 00:46:14,987
Not at all.
Bugler, sound carry on.

494
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:29,369
Division dismissed.

495
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:45,053
Baker, please carry on as you intended.

496
00:46:45,226 --> 00:46:49,253
Thank you, sir.
Come on, boys, as we rehearsed it.

497
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:46,985
Captain Hickey, I'm so happy.

498
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,181
- The great day is dawning.
- Yes, they're just outside the gate.

499
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:26,623
- They'll drop anchor tonight.
- That's not what I mean.

500
00:53:26,794 --> 00:53:29,763
Nolan's back from New York.
He's giving me an audition tomorrow.

501
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:34,595
- That's marvelous! But what about Bake?
- That's all I want.

502
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:38,000
To show him I can get that job
without his magnificent management.

503
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:40,732
- And then what?
- And then...

504
00:53:40,908 --> 00:53:43,103
...I'll be satisfied.

505
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:55,947
So the Connie Martin is about
to have a new master, huh?

506
00:53:56,124 --> 00:53:58,592
- Well, good luck, dear.
- Thank you.

507
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,990
Oh, gosh, it's nearly 7:00.
I've got to be going.

508
00:54:01,162 --> 00:54:04,620
I hope this is the last night
I have to take a substituting job.

509
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:07,157
What time will you be back, dear?

510
00:54:07,502 --> 00:54:09,663
We won't be through until about 1 or 2.

511
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:15,867
Don't worry. I'll make
a lot of noise with the key.

512
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,705
- Good night.
- Night, darling.

513
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:37,024
- Say, what are you gonna do with Mike?
- A little peace offering for Sherry.

514
00:54:37,198 --> 00:54:39,723
Every time she looks at him,
she'll think of me.

515
00:54:41,202 --> 00:54:43,136
There is a resemblance.

516
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:48,272
I wrote and explained what happened...

517
00:54:48,443 --> 00:54:50,877
...but I never had an answer
to any of my letters.

518
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:55,072
Bilge, you don't think by any chance
she could be sore at me, do you?

519
00:54:55,249 --> 00:54:57,809
I'd advise you to phone first
and find out.

520
00:54:57,985 --> 00:55:01,819
Maybe you'd better phone for me.
You're so masterful with women.

521
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,581
You'll swab your own decks tonight.

522
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:08,627
I got a heavy date
that I made last october.

523
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,472
Hello.

524
00:55:29,217 --> 00:55:33,586
- Hello, Bake.
- Is Sherry there?

525
00:55:33,754 --> 00:55:37,918
Oh, she's working. Good.
Then she's not sore at me.

526
00:55:38,659 --> 00:55:41,355
Oh, she is?
Well, I'll be right up then.

527
00:55:41,896 --> 00:55:46,595
Well, I wouldn't, at least until
I've spoken to her. Where are you?

528
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:49,265
Who, me? I'm...

529
00:55:49,904 --> 00:55:52,270
I'm dining with a friend of mine.

530
00:55:54,408 --> 00:55:57,639
Yes, well, you can tell her she can
reach me at this number.

531
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,837
It's Franklin-4321.

532
00:56:00,014 --> 00:56:04,041
All right, I'll tell her.
She may be a little late. Goodbye.

533
00:56:04,218 --> 00:56:06,118
Goodbye.

534
00:56:07,088 --> 00:56:09,613
Mike, don't ever fall in love.

535
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,048
Connie.

536
00:56:48,426 --> 00:56:50,189
Oh, hello.

537
00:56:53,665 --> 00:56:55,758
I must have fallen asleep.

538
00:56:56,634 --> 00:56:58,727
Can't I get you a cup of coffee?

539
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,270
No, thanks. You have one.

540
00:57:12,217 --> 00:57:16,176
You see, I never did write him.
I wanted to keep the boat as a surprise.

541
00:57:16,354 --> 00:57:19,517
So I really can't blame him.
It's my fault.

542
00:57:25,163 --> 00:57:27,097
I think we better get to bed.

543
00:57:27,265 --> 00:57:30,098
Don't forget I've got to sing
at Iris' tomorrow night.

544
00:57:30,802 --> 00:57:33,327
- We can use that 50 dollars.
- Yes.

545
00:57:33,738 --> 00:57:36,002
Oh, I nearly forgot. Bake called.

546
00:57:36,174 --> 00:57:39,905
He left a number where you can reach him.
He's waiting to hear from you.

547
00:57:40,812 --> 00:57:43,110
Let him wait.

548
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:03,528
Good morning, Nolan Enterprises.
Just a moment, I'll connect you with him.

549
00:58:04,536 --> 00:58:07,972
- Good morning. I want to see Mr. Nolan.
- Mr. Nolan is in New York.

550
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:10,004
Good. I'll wait.

551
00:59:21,546 --> 00:59:25,312
- Thank you, that's very nice.
- Thank you, Mr. Nolan.

552
00:59:25,617 --> 00:59:28,108
We'll be ready to hear you sing
as soon as you've rested.

553
00:59:29,787 --> 00:59:32,051
- Well, how is she?
- She's a great little dancer.

554
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,589
If she can sing too,
she's the best bet we've had.

555
00:59:34,759 --> 00:59:37,922
Better get a contract ready. Nolan'll
be yelling for one if she delivers.

556
00:59:38,096 --> 00:59:39,324
Okay.

557
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:45,099
Hi, Sullivan.

558
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:48,068
Hello, Baker. What's the idea
of the outfit? Is it a new act?

559
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:51,265
- Yeah, an act of Congress.
- So you joined the Navy.

560
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:54,104
So long as you don't want a job,
I'm glad to see you.

561
00:59:54,279 --> 00:59:56,008
I want a job for somebody else.

562
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,744
She's just what Nolan's
been looking for.

563
00:59:57,745 --> 00:59:59,308
You're too late.

564
00:59:59,484 --> 01:00:01,714
He's got somebody in there
he's interested in.

565
01:00:01,886 --> 01:00:04,320
Yeah? Who is she?

566
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:06,389
I don't know.
Just some girl who came in.

567
01:00:07,959 --> 01:00:11,224
- May I have a drink of water, please?
- Why, certainly.

568
01:00:14,332 --> 01:00:17,301
Yes, Mr. Nolan, right away.

569
01:00:17,802 --> 01:00:20,703
Take a glass of water to the young lady.
She's gonna sing now.

570
01:00:20,872 --> 01:00:23,170
- You better take that contract in.
- All right.

571
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:26,037
- Glad you dropped around.
- Thanks.

572
01:01:05,149 --> 01:01:06,748
There's nothing like
water for the voice.

573
01:01:06,749 --> 01:01:08,346
No, there isn't.

574
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:11,044
- That's what I always say.
- Yeah.

575
01:01:18,162 --> 01:01:19,778
Well, so long, Sullivan.
I'll be seeing you.

576
01:01:19,779 --> 01:01:21,393
So long.

577
01:01:26,437 --> 01:01:28,200
Thank you.

578
01:01:36,614 --> 01:01:39,082
All right, Miss Martin.

579
01:01:39,817 --> 01:01:41,808
Yes, sir.

580
01:02:56,861 --> 01:03:00,228
- Pretty dull party, isn't it?
- Why, yes, it's dreadful.

581
01:03:00,398 --> 01:03:02,730
How about sneaking away
to find some excitement?

582
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:07,735
I'd love to, but I can't.
You see, I'm the hostess.

583
01:03:07,905 --> 01:03:12,535
Really? I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to deride your party.

584
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:16,202
It's all right, brother.
That's what parties are for.

585
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,318
- Hello, Sherry.
- oh, hello, Iris.

586
01:03:25,823 --> 01:03:28,621
Connie says she's singing in your place
tonight, that you're not well.

587
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:30,522
- What's wrong?
- Well, I don't know.

588
01:03:30,695 --> 01:03:33,357
I've been feeling
a little peculiar all afternoon.

589
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:35,192
That's too bad.

590
01:03:35,366 --> 01:03:38,858
Why don't you try a little
bicarbonate of soda. That might help.

591
01:03:42,273 --> 01:03:45,504
- Hello, hello, hello.
- You like?

592
01:03:46,844 --> 01:03:48,903
This reminds me of the Paradise.

593
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,413
- I wonder where you buy the tickets.
- Remember where you are, son.

594
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:54,676
Poor kid, she had to go to Reno.

595
01:03:58,556 --> 01:04:00,319
I'll see you later.

596
01:04:03,628 --> 01:04:06,188
Don't worry,
I'll take care of everything.

597
01:04:06,964 --> 01:04:10,127
- What are you doing here?
- I came with my pal.

598
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:14,102
You're not gonna hold it against me
for the rest of my life, are you?

599
01:04:14,272 --> 01:04:16,570
I waited all last night
for you to return my call.

600
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:19,209
- I wanted to explain about Jim Nolan.
- Don't bother.

601
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:21,971
I was there this afternoon
and I fixed it all up for you.

602
01:04:22,146 --> 01:04:25,013
- At Jim Nolan's?
- Yes, and it wasn't easy.

603
01:04:25,183 --> 01:04:27,242
There was a girl
he was about to sign up.

604
01:04:27,418 --> 01:04:30,785
As she was getting ready to sing,
she asked for a drink of water.

605
01:04:30,955 --> 01:04:32,923
What do you think I did?

606
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:37,827
- What?
- I put bicarbonate of soda in it.

607
01:04:38,729 --> 01:04:41,391
- You what?
- Yeah, bicarbonate of soda.

608
01:04:41,566 --> 01:04:44,126
Can you imagine
the expression on her face?

609
01:04:45,903 --> 01:04:50,431
Bake Baker, I'll get even with you
if it's the last thing I do.

610
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,971
I must have said something.

611
01:05:07,725 --> 01:05:09,317
Bilge.

612
01:05:11,028 --> 01:05:13,758
- Connie Martin.
- Why, yes, of course.

613
01:05:13,931 --> 01:05:15,831
Well, well, how are you?

614
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:19,998
You're back. it seems
a long time, doesn't it?

615
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:22,264
Yes, when you come
to think of it, it does.

616
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,432
I was sort of expecting you last night.

617
01:05:26,644 --> 01:05:30,011
And when you didn't show up, well,
I thought perhaps you'd forgotten me.

618
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:33,844
Forgotten you?
No, I had to stay on board last night.

619
01:05:34,018 --> 01:05:37,146
I realize that. it was silly of me.

620
01:05:37,321 --> 01:05:39,585
Of course,
somebody has to stay on board.

621
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,624
Oh, Bilge, I was so excited,
I didn't notice you passed your exam.

622
01:05:44,795 --> 01:05:47,320
- I'm so glad.
- Yeah, I am too.

623
01:05:47,498 --> 01:05:50,296
I've so many things to tell you,
I don't know where to start.

624
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:52,993
That's swell. I'll be glad
to hear them some time.

625
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:57,664
- Well, I'll see you later.
- But, Bilge...

626
01:06:01,045 --> 01:06:03,240
- What?
- Yes, sir.

627
01:06:05,249 --> 01:06:07,046
- Hey, can you imagine that?
- What?

628
01:06:07,218 --> 01:06:10,085
I'm trying to drown my sorrows.
I down a quart of the stuff...

629
01:06:10,254 --> 01:06:11,801
...and the guy tells
me it's grape juice.

630
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:13,348
Let's get out of here.

631
01:06:13,524 --> 01:06:16,823
What's the rush? Maybe the grape juice
will make me feel happy anyway.

632
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:18,723
- Remember that teacher?
- Yeah.

633
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:21,228
She's here, and she was
expecting me last night.

634
01:06:21,399 --> 01:06:23,196
- Did you forget?
- No, I lied to her.

635
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:25,892
- I told her I had to stay on board.
- Why?

636
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:29,506
Oh, I don't want to wake up
some morning and find myself married.

637
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,232
Acted as cold as I could. A dame like that
always makes me feel like a heel.

638
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:35,902
She brings out your finer instincts.

639
01:06:36,447 --> 01:06:37,675
Come on.

640
01:06:37,848 --> 01:06:40,248
- Where have you been, Bilgy?
- oh, I...

641
01:06:41,752 --> 01:06:43,913
I want you to meet
my shipmate, Bake Baker.

642
01:06:44,088 --> 01:06:46,249
This is a friend of mine, Mrs. Manning.

643
01:06:46,724 --> 01:06:48,214
How do you do, Mrs. Manning?

644
01:06:48,392 --> 01:06:49,757
How do you do?

645
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:53,624
I'm always happy to meet
a friend of Bilgy's.

646
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:57,423
Yes.

647
01:06:57,601 --> 01:07:00,832
Sometime when I'm having a party
I'll invite you to come.

648
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:09,241
May I have the next dance? Thank you.

649
01:07:09,513 --> 01:07:12,641
I've been waiting for you, Bilgy.

650
01:10:26,143 --> 01:10:27,804
Why aren't you wearing your uniform?

651
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:29,445
It's a custom of the Navy.

652
01:10:29,613 --> 01:10:33,276
Officers seldom wear their uniforms
ashore unless we're on duty.

653
01:10:34,418 --> 01:10:38,081
Then how can one tell the difference
between an officer and a civilian?

654
01:10:38,255 --> 01:10:40,849
We have our academy ring.

655
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,389
Oh, isn't that lovely.

656
01:10:45,195 --> 01:10:46,787
Mind if I borrow this for a moment?

657
01:10:46,964 --> 01:10:49,956
- I'd like to show it to a friend.
- Certainly.

658
01:10:50,901 --> 01:10:53,768
Thank you so much.
I'll bring it right back.

659
01:11:11,722 --> 01:11:14,987
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

660
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:18,961
What is it?

661
01:11:19,997 --> 01:11:22,522
You men are all alike.

662
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,863
Oh, Sherry, honestly,
I didn't know it was you.

663
01:11:26,103 --> 01:11:27,730
That's not what I'm talking about.

664
01:11:27,905 --> 01:11:29,634
Then tell me what's the matter.

665
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:31,297
No.

666
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:36,746
If I only had someone to protect me.

667
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:39,246
What is it? What is it?

668
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,517
I've never been so insulted
in all of my life.

669
01:11:42,686 --> 01:11:44,916
Who did it? What did he say?

670
01:11:45,222 --> 01:11:47,918
Oh, I couldn't repeat it.

671
01:11:48,659 --> 01:11:51,025
Who was it? Point him out to me.

672
01:11:52,763 --> 01:11:56,199
That man over there near the pond.

673
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:02,996
I don't like his face.

674
01:12:07,177 --> 01:12:10,510
Listen, landlubber, I know your type.
You can't get away with that.

675
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:23,323
He's lucky I slipped.

676
01:12:23,494 --> 01:12:25,291
- Let go of me.
- Take it easy, buddy.

677
01:12:25,462 --> 01:12:26,690
Let go of me.

678
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:29,765
I'm awfully sorry
this had to happen, lieutenant.

679
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:33,102
Thanks so much for the use of your ring.

680
01:12:33,303 --> 01:12:35,567
Return to your ship at once.

681
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,167
Aye, aye, sir.

682
01:12:37,341 --> 01:12:42,745
What's the matter, Bake? You look sick.
Can I get you some bicarbonate of soda?

683
01:12:48,919 --> 01:12:50,910
Sorry you're leaving
so early, Miss Martin.

684
01:12:51,088 --> 01:12:54,888
I have to get up early. I'm looking
for my sister. Have you seen her?

685
01:12:55,059 --> 01:12:58,085
- She was on the terrace a moment ago.
- Thank you.

686
01:12:58,395 --> 01:13:00,460
What's the matter with
you tonight, Bilgy?

687
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:02,525
Nothing. Why?

688
01:13:03,067 --> 01:13:05,763
- You're acting so funny.
- Am I?

689
01:13:05,936 --> 01:13:07,631
Why, I don't mean to be.

690
01:13:09,573 --> 01:13:11,404
That's more like you were last night.

691
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:13,008
This is tonight, baby.

692
01:13:13,177 --> 01:13:16,078
And remember the date for your diary.

693
01:13:34,264 --> 01:13:35,993
Now, remember what I told you.

694
01:13:47,745 --> 01:13:50,942
Well, look who's here.

695
01:13:51,115 --> 01:13:53,413
Thank you very much.

696
01:13:54,418 --> 01:13:56,648
Where did you come from?

697
01:14:03,093 --> 01:14:06,028
That's all right, son. You did your best.

698
01:14:07,164 --> 01:14:10,292
I know. She treats me that way too.

699
01:14:24,982 --> 01:14:29,009
I don't often try to apologize
because I seldom make any mistakes.

700
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:38,351
I thought we were
all even after last night.

701
01:14:39,963 --> 01:14:43,228
Gosh, Sherry, I didn't know you took
this whole thing so seriously.

702
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,131
- Don't flatter yourself.
- It's Connie. She's going back home.

703
01:14:47,304 --> 01:14:49,033
Why, what's happened?

704
01:14:49,206 --> 01:14:51,640
Like a sap, she fell
in love with a sailor.

705
01:14:51,809 --> 01:14:54,369
Well, look at you.
I don't consider you a sap.

706
01:14:54,545 --> 01:14:58,709
Save that for the high-class
patter and genteel dance act.

707
01:14:58,982 --> 01:15:01,382
Connie won't listen.
If she goes back to Bellport...

708
01:15:01,552 --> 01:15:03,076
...she'll just eat her heart out.

709
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:06,984
Tell me who it is, and I'll bring him back
if I have to drag him to her.

710
01:15:07,157 --> 01:15:09,284
She wouldn't want him that way.

711
01:15:09,459 --> 01:15:11,188
Who is he?

712
01:15:11,361 --> 01:15:14,387
Well, with the usual
lack of imagination a sailor has...

713
01:15:14,565 --> 01:15:17,295
...he told her his name was Smith.

714
01:15:17,467 --> 01:15:19,094
The call him Bilge.

715
01:15:19,269 --> 01:15:22,170
Bilge Smith? He's my shipmate.

716
01:15:22,673 --> 01:15:24,265
I might have guessed it.

717
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:27,740
No, seriously, Bilge is a swell guy.
I'll talk to him.

718
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:29,936
Bake, you don't understand.

719
01:15:30,113 --> 01:15:32,911
Connie wouldn't want him
if things had to be explained.

720
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:34,880
He's stuck on that Iris Manning.

721
01:15:35,052 --> 01:15:36,485
Say, what's she like?

722
01:15:36,653 --> 01:15:39,053
Anything in a uniform.

723
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:03,206
There, don't you worry about it.

724
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:07,578
I guess maybe I can
take care of this matter.

725
01:16:07,751 --> 01:16:11,653
Captain Hickey, did you guarantee
this whole thing personally?

726
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:13,881
No. Not exactly.

727
01:16:14,057 --> 01:16:16,958
I did tell them I sailed
under your father.

728
01:16:17,127 --> 01:16:20,858
And if the amount isn't met, you're
in danger of losing your job, aren't you?

729
01:16:21,465 --> 01:16:25,629
Well, I'm kind of sick
of being a landlubber anyway.

730
01:16:25,802 --> 01:16:27,770
Don't you worry about it, child.

731
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:29,500
Goodbye, Miss Connie.

732
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,445
Ahoy, Captain Hickey.

733
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:40,981
Ahoy, Miss Sherry.

734
01:16:41,151 --> 01:16:42,812
- Well.
- I want you to meet...

735
01:16:42,986 --> 01:16:45,386
...the United States Navy, Bake Baker.

736
01:16:45,555 --> 01:16:47,785
- How do you do, Mr. Baker?
- Captain Hickey.

737
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:51,587
So this is the young man
you've been moping about, eh?

738
01:16:52,296 --> 01:16:56,426
- Well, fair weather.
- Thank you, sir.

739
01:16:58,335 --> 01:17:01,065
Well, I don't suppose you can
make it any worse than it is.

740
01:17:01,238 --> 01:17:03,536
You see what you can do with her.

741
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:11,013
- Hello, Bake.
- Hello, Connie.

742
01:17:12,683 --> 01:17:14,776
Sherry tells me you're leaving.

743
01:17:15,519 --> 01:17:18,386
Well, that's probably
the wisest thing to do. Run away.

744
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:21,991
All this stuff about fighting for your man
makes things so complicated.

745
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,923
If all girls would just give up
and run back to Bellport...

746
01:17:25,095 --> 01:17:27,063
...then we'd see the end of family life.

747
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:29,198
Little Junior would remain just an idea...

748
01:17:29,366 --> 01:17:31,994
...and every man would burn
his own toast. I thank you.

749
01:17:32,269 --> 01:17:33,736
Well, I'm not leaving.

750
01:17:33,904 --> 01:17:35,394
Staying right here.

751
01:17:37,307 --> 01:17:39,775
There, you see? I told you I'd fix it.

752
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:45,044
Why, Connie, that's swell.
What happened?

753
01:17:45,215 --> 01:17:47,240
Well, I've been talking to Captain Hickey.

754
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:50,443
He's about to lose his job
for what he's done for me.

755
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:53,714
I've got to have 700 dollars
by Saturday.

756
01:17:54,491 --> 01:17:58,951
Seven hundred dollars? We earn that
in a week, but they don't pay it to us.

757
01:18:01,798 --> 01:18:04,926
There, Mr. Baker, is something
for you to manage.

758
01:18:09,306 --> 01:18:11,206
What do you say?

759
01:18:11,842 --> 01:18:14,811
I don't know, Baker. if Nolan
ever found out, he'd fire me.

760
01:18:14,978 --> 01:18:18,175
All I want is a loan of some scenery
and costumes for the one night.

761
01:18:18,348 --> 01:18:20,111
Now, how will he ever know?

762
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:22,083
Well, let's see.

763
01:18:22,252 --> 01:18:25,085
We had a show called Mum's the Word
that folded in four days.

764
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:28,656
Those costumes were pretty cute,
but Nolan never liked them.

765
01:18:28,825 --> 01:18:30,087
You can have those.

766
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:31,989
Thanks.

767
01:18:32,162 --> 01:18:35,325
And if you ever need a battleship,
you can have mine.

768
01:18:35,499 --> 01:18:37,296
- So long, boy.
- So long.

769
01:18:42,906 --> 01:18:44,134
- Hi, Bake.
- Hello, Bake.

770
01:18:44,307 --> 01:18:47,640
You know, rehearsal
was called for four bells.

771
01:18:51,548 --> 01:18:53,140
Say, Bake.

772
01:18:53,316 --> 01:18:55,784
Is there going to be some dames
in this show with us?

773
01:18:55,952 --> 01:18:59,319
If it's the fairer sex you're
referring to, the answer is yes.

774
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,760
- Hello, Sherry.
- Hi.

775
01:19:06,329 --> 01:19:07,660
Lookie there.

776
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:09,264
How about that, huh?

777
01:19:09,433 --> 01:19:13,164
- These kids offered to help out.
- oh, gee, that's swell of you.

778
01:19:13,336 --> 01:19:16,897
I wish that tall blond angel
would adopt me.

779
01:19:17,074 --> 01:19:18,302
You ain't fooling, either.

780
01:19:22,779 --> 01:19:24,076
Hello.

781
01:19:24,247 --> 01:19:26,545
How was heaven when you left?

782
01:19:26,716 --> 01:19:31,346
Tell me, little boy, did you get a whistle
or a baseball bat with that suit?

783
01:19:35,325 --> 01:19:37,850
Bomber and his blonds.

784
01:21:01,545 --> 01:21:05,675
Thanks, fellows. I can see
you guys don't appreciate high art.

785
01:21:14,424 --> 01:21:15,914
What's the matter, Sherry?

786
01:21:16,092 --> 01:21:19,926
It's Connie. She says she's going back
to Bellport after the show, anyway.

787
01:21:20,096 --> 01:21:22,690
I wish there was something
we could do for her.

788
01:21:22,866 --> 01:21:24,800
That Manning woman.

789
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:27,566
Maybe something can be done.

790
01:21:29,339 --> 01:21:32,536
Let's not worry about it now.
We ought to run through the new number.

791
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:34,643
We haven't been through
the dance though.

792
01:21:34,811 --> 01:21:37,609
Let's take a crack at it anyway.
There isn't much time.

793
01:21:37,881 --> 01:21:39,696
Come on, fellows, let's
have it, will you?

794
01:21:39,697 --> 01:21:41,510
A flat, fellows.

795
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:19,906
That's it.

796
01:27:26,363 --> 01:27:28,456
I'm moving my gear
up to the chief's quarters.

797
01:27:28,632 --> 01:27:32,591
Mind getting that riveting machine out
of the way so that I can get to my locker?

798
01:27:32,769 --> 01:27:35,169
Don't bother me, son.
The show must go on.

799
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:38,305
Why?

800
01:27:39,109 --> 01:27:42,738
Why? I don't know why,
but that's what they always say.

801
01:27:56,727 --> 01:27:59,195
I hear you're putting on a show
with the Martin girls.

802
01:27:59,796 --> 01:28:01,388
Yeah.

803
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:05,301
What are you doing tonight, Bilge?

804
01:28:07,004 --> 01:28:10,872
I've got a date
with Mrs. Manning at 10:00.

805
01:28:16,847 --> 01:28:18,974
Well, I'll be seeing you.

806
01:28:39,269 --> 01:28:42,067
"Was I long, darling?"

807
01:28:42,506 --> 01:28:44,667
Was I long, darling?

808
01:28:45,175 --> 01:28:47,268
Was I long, darling?

809
01:28:47,444 --> 01:28:49,844
Was I long, darling?

810
01:28:52,849 --> 01:28:57,684
"And every hour away from you
seems like a day."

811
01:28:57,854 --> 01:29:00,982
- Mr. Bake Baker.
- Yes.

812
01:29:01,725 --> 01:29:03,056
Mr. Baker, I'm so
happy to see you again.

813
01:29:03,057 --> 01:29:04,387
Oh, thank you.

814
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:07,223
It's so thoughtful of you
to ask me to join your show.

815
01:29:07,397 --> 01:29:09,592
- I see you have the part I sent.
- Yes...

816
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:13,532
...it's short order to learn by tomorrow
night. I spent the afternoon studying it.

817
01:29:13,704 --> 01:29:16,002
- I think I know it quite well.
- That's fine.

818
01:29:16,173 --> 01:29:18,733
I just thought I'd drop in
to run through it with you...

819
01:29:18,909 --> 01:29:21,935
- ...since we haven't much time.
- Mr. Smith isn't here yet.

820
01:29:22,112 --> 01:29:24,842
Oh, he'll be here.

821
01:29:25,349 --> 01:29:26,611
Shall we start?

822
01:29:26,783 --> 01:29:30,048
Well, now, I thought we'd make this
a sort of a dress rehearsal.

823
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:31,983
Oh, dress rehearsal?

824
01:29:32,155 --> 01:29:33,622
I'm supposed to wear a negligee.

825
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:37,453
Yes, it's very important to the scene.

826
01:29:38,128 --> 01:29:40,313
This is going to be a
lot of fun, isn't it?

827
01:29:40,314 --> 01:29:42,497
You'll be surprised.

828
01:29:42,666 --> 01:29:44,497
I'll rush and slip one on.

829
01:29:44,668 --> 01:29:46,369
It'll be more effective
that way, won't it?

830
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:48,069
Oh, definitely, yes.

831
01:29:48,638 --> 01:29:50,503
Yes.

832
01:30:12,763 --> 01:30:14,379
Mrs. Manning is waiting
on the porch, sir.

833
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,994
Thank you, Benson.

834
01:30:24,641 --> 01:30:27,269
I know, it's Bilgy.

835
01:30:34,084 --> 01:30:36,052
What are you doing here?

836
01:30:36,219 --> 01:30:37,481
Who, me?

837
01:30:38,488 --> 01:30:41,150
I'm here at Mrs. Manning's
special invitation.

838
01:30:41,324 --> 01:30:43,053
Have a cigar.

839
01:30:45,962 --> 01:30:47,429
I'll call for a drink for you.

840
01:30:47,597 --> 01:30:49,155
Hey, Max!

841
01:30:50,534 --> 01:30:52,331
What's this all about?

842
01:30:52,836 --> 01:30:54,701
Oh, my being here?

843
01:30:54,871 --> 01:30:57,431
Iris and I have developed
a very close friendship...

844
01:30:57,607 --> 01:31:00,132
...ever since the night of her party.

845
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:04,809
Listen, how far has this thing gone?

846
01:31:05,182 --> 01:31:09,380
Well, you know, Bilge, you and I
are both men of the world.

847
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,715
Don't make me laugh.

848
01:31:13,623 --> 01:31:16,820
You wouldn't like to make
a little bet or anything, would you?

849
01:31:17,294 --> 01:31:18,693
Any amount you say.

850
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:22,029
Ten bucks?

851
01:31:22,265 --> 01:31:23,562
All right with me.

852
01:31:27,838 --> 01:31:29,863
You wait out there,
and keep your eyes open.

853
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,701
Okay.

854
01:31:41,084 --> 01:31:44,315
Was I long, darling?
Was I long, darling?

855
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:53,022
Was I long, darling?

856
01:31:53,196 --> 01:31:54,959
Every minute seemed like an hour, babe.

857
01:31:55,132 --> 01:31:58,624
And every hour away from you
seems like a day.

858
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:02,067
You're not expecting anyone, are you?

859
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,228
Well, I was.

860
01:32:03,406 --> 01:32:05,806
But when I heard you could come
I told my servants...

861
01:32:05,976 --> 01:32:09,036
...I wasn't home to anyone
but you, Bakey.

862
01:32:11,882 --> 01:32:15,409
And to think we've only
known each other these few days.

863
01:32:16,219 --> 01:32:18,585
Of course, there have been
other men in my life...

864
01:32:18,755 --> 01:32:23,283
...but they all seem like such petty,
unimportant people since I met you.

865
01:32:23,527 --> 01:32:25,961
Yes, I understand.

866
01:32:26,429 --> 01:32:29,796
Tell me, have there ever been
any other women in your life?

867
01:32:30,667 --> 01:32:35,195
- You're the first.
- oh, my darling. You make me so happy.

868
01:32:35,372 --> 01:32:36,999
There, there.

869
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:41,268
Sorry if I'm interrupting anything.

870
01:32:41,444 --> 01:32:43,412
And you're supposed to be my pal.

871
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,514
How dare you enter like this.

872
01:32:45,682 --> 01:32:49,482
What right have you to come prying,
forcing yourself into my private life?

873
01:32:49,653 --> 01:32:51,416
- But I...
- Understand this.

874
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:55,957
I was only playing with you.
And you, poor sap, fell for it.

875
01:32:59,329 --> 01:33:01,456
Will you leave,
or do I ring for the butler?

876
01:33:01,965 --> 01:33:04,160
Don't trouble yourself.

877
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:09,930
Well, how was I?

878
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:13,075
You were swell. Nobody could've
done the part as well as you.

879
01:33:13,243 --> 01:33:17,612
I was confused at the end. Bilgy didn't
say his lines the way they were written.

880
01:33:17,781 --> 01:33:20,477
No, but he got the general sense of it.

881
01:33:40,136 --> 01:33:41,364
Isn't Bake here yet?

882
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:43,836
The boys say he didn't leave
in their boat with them.

883
01:33:44,007 --> 01:33:45,599
No one knows what's happened to him.

884
01:33:45,775 --> 01:33:49,541
I might have known. A little thing
like this show's just slipped his mind.

885
01:33:49,713 --> 01:33:52,147
I bet he's telling the admiral
how to run the fleet.

886
01:33:52,315 --> 01:33:54,977
If he doesn't come,
we'll just have to return the money.

887
01:33:55,151 --> 01:33:57,051
Without Bake, we'll have no show.

888
01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:00,246
And without a show, we'll have no Bake.

889
01:34:02,659 --> 01:34:05,423
Why did they let the rest of the men go
and keep me?

890
01:34:05,595 --> 01:34:07,392
I've gotta get to that show.

891
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:11,466
All I know is that orders are
your liberty has been cancelled.

892
01:34:11,901 --> 01:34:14,734
I'll bet you did this to get even
with me for last night.

893
01:34:14,904 --> 01:34:18,340
Well, if you think I did it,
go ask your executive officer.

894
01:34:18,808 --> 01:34:21,276
Okay, admiral, I'll do that.

895
01:34:24,681 --> 01:34:27,115
Seaman Baker to speak
with the executive officer.

896
01:34:27,284 --> 01:34:28,512
Just a minute.

897
01:34:29,886 --> 01:34:31,683
Seaman Baker requests to see you, sir.

898
01:34:31,855 --> 01:34:33,482
Permission granted.

899
01:34:33,957 --> 01:34:35,982
Here's Baker now.

900
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:39,226
- Executive officer will see you.
- Thank you.

901
01:34:41,631 --> 01:34:43,496
Yes, Baker?

902
01:34:44,434 --> 01:34:46,595
I beg your pardon, sir.
I've changed my mind.

903
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:49,261
Just a moment.
We've been talking about you.

904
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:52,567
Lieutenant Williams came aboard
to discuss you with me.

905
01:34:53,109 --> 01:34:55,373
I'm sincerely sorry
about the other evening, sir.

906
01:34:55,545 --> 01:34:57,137
I didn't know you were an officer.

907
01:34:57,314 --> 01:34:58,747
I realize that, Baker.

908
01:34:58,915 --> 01:35:01,941
Lt. Williams has been very generous
about the whole thing.

909
01:35:02,118 --> 01:35:04,712
He's just been interceding for you.

910
01:35:05,121 --> 01:35:06,645
Thank you, sir.

911
01:35:07,390 --> 01:35:09,551
May I go ashore now, sir?

912
01:35:09,926 --> 01:35:11,257
Your name is on the report.

913
01:35:11,428 --> 01:35:14,022
The captain will probably scratch it
tomorrow at mast.

914
01:35:14,197 --> 01:35:16,028
But until then, you must remain aboard.

915
01:35:16,366 --> 01:35:19,233
- But, sir, I...
- That'll be all, Baker.

916
01:35:19,736 --> 01:35:21,033
Aye, aye, sir.

917
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:27,437
Well, wise guy,
did you get your liberty pass?

918
01:35:36,419 --> 01:35:38,011
Where are you going without liberty?

919
01:35:38,188 --> 01:35:39,587
- Where do you think?
- Wait.

920
01:35:39,789 --> 01:35:41,552
- You crazy?
- I'm not crazy. I'm going.

921
01:35:41,725 --> 01:35:43,090
You know the orders.

922
01:35:43,259 --> 01:35:45,921
I don't care what
the orders are. I'm going.

923
01:35:46,096 --> 01:35:47,563
Cut it out, will you?

924
01:35:54,337 --> 01:35:55,770
Gee, kid, I'm sorry.

925
01:35:55,939 --> 01:35:57,406
I didn't mean to hurt you.

926
01:35:57,574 --> 01:35:59,337
I forgot myself.

927
01:35:59,509 --> 01:36:01,875
Come on, Bake, hit me.

928
01:36:11,955 --> 01:36:15,254
Hey, water taxi. Stand by.

929
01:36:16,459 --> 01:36:18,086
Bake!

930
01:36:29,406 --> 01:36:30,964
What is it, quartermaster?

931
01:36:31,141 --> 01:36:33,268
It's a man jumping ship, sir.

932
01:36:33,443 --> 01:36:35,411
- Do you know who it is?
- Yes, sir.

933
01:36:35,578 --> 01:36:37,443
It's Seaman Baker.

934
01:36:38,515 --> 01:36:40,005
Smith.

935
01:36:41,718 --> 01:36:44,278
Get a detail of men and arrest
Seaman Baker immediately.

936
01:36:44,454 --> 01:36:45,978
Aye, aye, sir.

937
01:36:47,357 --> 01:36:51,157
You've gotta be ready by the third chorus.
Get your clothes on. Hurry, kids.

938
01:36:51,327 --> 01:36:52,316
- Is he here yet?
- No.

939
01:36:55,932 --> 01:36:57,559
Here I am.

940
01:37:11,448 --> 01:37:14,042
- Hello, Sullivan.
- Hello, Mr. Nolan.

941
01:37:14,217 --> 01:37:16,913
Glad to see you taking
so much interest in scouting talent.

942
01:37:17,086 --> 01:37:19,213
Yes, Mr. Nolan.
If I'd known you were coming...

943
01:37:19,389 --> 01:37:22,586
- ...I'd have changed my plans.
- oh, that's all right. Glad to see you.

944
01:37:22,759 --> 01:37:24,556
Let's sit together.

945
01:37:24,994 --> 01:37:28,691
Baker sent a note telling me he had a
Monte Carlo idea when the fleet was there.

946
01:37:28,865 --> 01:37:31,299
I'm anxious to see it.
Might be able to use it.

947
01:37:31,468 --> 01:37:34,801
- He's a smart lad.
- In more ways than one.

948
01:37:36,573 --> 01:37:38,097
Sullivan...

949
01:37:38,374 --> 01:37:40,274
...look at that costume.

950
01:37:42,312 --> 01:37:45,179
That's the kind we should've
used in Mum's the Word.

951
01:37:46,716 --> 01:37:48,013
Yes, sir.

952
01:37:49,385 --> 01:37:53,116
- Shore patrol coming aboard on duty.
- Aye, aye, sir.

953
01:37:55,792 --> 01:37:59,250
You men patrol the docks and
see that he doesn't get off the ship.

954
01:38:03,433 --> 01:38:04,900
Wonder what this is all about.

955
01:38:12,542 --> 01:38:13,770
Hello, Connie.

956
01:38:13,943 --> 01:38:15,570
It's you. What are you doing here?

957
01:38:15,745 --> 01:38:17,076
I've come to arrest Bake.

958
01:38:17,247 --> 01:38:18,475
Arrest Bake? Why?

959
01:38:18,648 --> 01:38:21,583
He jumped ship.
My orders are to bring him back.

960
01:38:22,218 --> 01:38:24,914
Well, couldn't you wait
until after the show?

961
01:38:25,221 --> 01:38:28,486
If I don't bring him back right away,
it'll cost me my stripes.

962
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:31,589
Well, I guess you'd better
make your arrest then.

963
01:38:31,761 --> 01:38:33,558
He's in there.

964
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,022
Thanks.

965
01:38:38,468 --> 01:38:40,868
Connie, I've been wanting
to say this to you, but I...

966
01:38:41,037 --> 01:38:42,766
I don't know how.

967
01:38:42,939 --> 01:38:44,930
Can't we start again,
like at the beginning?

968
01:38:45,108 --> 01:38:48,908
I'm afraid you missed the beginning.
This is the end of the show.

969
01:39:03,326 --> 01:39:05,556
You're under arrest, Bake.

970
01:39:09,999 --> 01:39:12,365
I guess I didn't hit you hard enough.

971
01:39:12,535 --> 01:39:14,969
Come on, we gotta get back to the ship.

972
01:39:16,573 --> 01:39:18,234
You win.

973
01:39:19,475 --> 01:39:22,808
You may as well know, that thing with
Iris Manning last night was a gag.

974
01:39:22,979 --> 01:39:24,241
What?

975
01:39:24,414 --> 01:39:27,076
While you were running around
with a bottle of peroxide...

976
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:29,616
...you were passing up a girl
you were nuts about.

977
01:39:29,786 --> 01:39:31,219
That's my business.

978
01:39:31,387 --> 01:39:33,287
Tried to make up.
She wouldn't look at me.

979
01:39:33,456 --> 01:39:34,946
I don't blame her.

980
01:39:35,124 --> 01:39:37,422
Do you know why
this show's being given?

981
01:39:37,594 --> 01:39:40,154
To help Connie pay off this ship.

982
01:39:41,497 --> 01:39:43,522
Is this the Connie Martin?

983
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:45,861
It ain't the Joe Doakes.

984
01:39:46,402 --> 01:39:48,734
She didn't tell me she salvaged it.

985
01:39:48,905 --> 01:39:52,102
She salvaged it for you, you sap.

986
01:40:01,284 --> 01:40:04,344
She knew I was going to arrest you,
and she told me where you were.

987
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,488
That's the kind of a girl she is.

988
01:40:09,726 --> 01:40:11,887
You go on with this show.

989
01:40:12,061 --> 01:40:13,023
What about the patrol?

990
01:40:13,024 --> 01:40:15,121
I'll stall them off
until you get through.

991
01:40:15,298 --> 01:40:19,325
Oh, no, just because I'm in a jam,
there's no need for you to get in one.

992
01:40:21,037 --> 01:40:23,505
Those are orders. Do as I tell you.

993
01:40:26,843 --> 01:40:30,438
Maybe they won't be putting us
in the same cell together anyway.

994
01:40:32,515 --> 01:40:34,312
Okay, chief.

995
01:48:36,867 --> 01:48:41,201
And we'll sail to China and India,
and all those spiggoty places.

996
01:48:41,371 --> 01:48:43,737
With your husband at the helm.

997
01:48:47,244 --> 01:48:48,609
Hey, Bake.

998
01:48:48,778 --> 01:48:51,303
Here's a note for you and Miss Sherry.

999
01:48:51,781 --> 01:48:54,511
It's from Nolan. I told you I'd fix it.

1000
01:48:55,051 --> 01:48:56,609
Oh, he asked me to get an answer.

1001
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:59,784
Tell Mr. Nolan we'll be happy
to consider his proposition...

1002
01:48:59,956 --> 01:49:02,083
...as soon as Mr. Baker
gets out of the brig...

1003
01:49:02,259 --> 01:49:03,851
...which is one
thing he can't fix.

1004
01:49:04,027 --> 01:49:05,858
- Okay.
- Wait a minute. one condition.

1005
01:49:06,029 --> 01:49:09,021
That is that Miss Martin
asks me to marry her.

1006
01:49:10,167 --> 01:49:12,032
Well, will you?

1007
01:49:12,903 --> 01:49:14,530
You'll have to ask Father.

1008
01:49:14,704 --> 01:49:17,537
Get your uniform on.
I can't stall the patrol any longer.
