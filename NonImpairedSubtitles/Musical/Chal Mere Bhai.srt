1
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:38,054
One more.

2
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:40,656
Ask me, why?
I regret getting married.

3
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:44,054
Marriage maybe good for others
but it has ruined me!

4
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:49,598
My friends explained that the
old cot I'd brought with the dowry...

5
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:54,668
She is terrible. To top it
she has brought half a dozen kids!

6
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:58,900
They well remember our address.
I often left them in the temple...

7
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:02,101
...saying I'll soon be back.
I'd fiind them sleeping in my bed!

8
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:06,840
You're really nuts! Why are
you cursing the unborn kids?

9
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:10,611
Wrong! This superstar
director husband of yours...

10
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,921
...is rehearsing his
Oscarwinning play.

11
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,821
Continue with these plays.
But don't everwork.

12
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,551
So, Oscarwinning...

13
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:23,254
Tell me, this niece of yours
who has come from Pune...

14
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:26,231
How much longerwill she stay here?
- What does that mean?

15
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,361
She has nobody but me.

16
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:32,333
Does that mean she'll
live here all her life?

17
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:35,035
Softly... talk softly.

18
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:38,441
She has come to her uncle not you.

19
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:42,640
Don't be rude to hertoday.

20
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:47,255
- Why? - She's a very proud girl.
- She's come here to look for a job.

21
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:50,290
You've neverfound a job.
How will she get one?

22
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:53,758
I'm sure I'll get this job!

23
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:57,194
- I know it in my bones.
- Of course. My niece is the best.

24
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,494
She's educated and smart.

25
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,634
I must leave or I'll get late.

26
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:03,795
I don't even know the way.
Bye, aunt.

27
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:06,603
If you get selected,
negotiate for a house.

28
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,403
These days you get
quarters with the job.

29
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:12,913
Also a car. Run along, dear.
Or you'll lose the job.

30
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:20,947
I've often told you not to eat
chilies as it effects your speech.

31
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:24,116
- Come, I'll give you some sweets.
- Go and rehearse your play!

32
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,627
Stop... right here.

33
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:32,166
- Madam, the fare...
- Oh, yes.

34
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:36,032
Here you are.
Pray for me.

35
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,857
Can't you watch where you're going?

36
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:56,959
What would you say if
I asked you the same?

37
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,129
This is an office
not a jogging ground.

38
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:03,129
- The way you're running...
- Yes, this is an office.

39
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,790
Not your drawing room that
you're wandering around!

40
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,799
Help me pick up my fiiles.
You dropped them all!

41
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:12,304
What kinds of people! I'm late and
you had to barge into me right then!

42
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:15,900
Doesn't see where he's headed
and then scolds me!

43
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:18,240
Won't even apologise!

44
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:21,747
- I should apologise?
- No, I'll apologise!

45
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:23,909
Sorry, I made a mistake.
Forgive me.

46
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,851
He's made me forget all
the answers I'd memorised.

47
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:29,925
God knows what will happen
in the interview!

48
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:38,030
Dear God, let nobody get
selected before my turn!

49
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:40,429
- Who is Miss Sapna?
- That's me.

50
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:43,137
You've been called.

51
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,271
Get her application out
and read her bio-data.

52
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:53,872
Her application is not in the fiile.

53
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,075
- What?
- Sir, I'll tell you...

54
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:59,244
My name is Sapna and I've done
B. Com in the fiirst division.

55
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,383
Did I ask you?

56
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,995
Didn't you fiile the
applications in serial?

57
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,192
- I did sir but...
- Hurry up, Suri.

58
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:14,293
Yes sir...

59
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:19,901
Look at the state of
yourworld, Oh God.

60
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:22,236
How man has changed...

61
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:24,346
It says in this...

62
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:28,548
Sir, that's not my application.
I remember mine by heart!

63
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:30,810
I'll recite it for you.

64
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:44,659
I don't know how the papers
in my fiile got into yourfiile...

65
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:48,735
Oh yes! You banged into
me on the stairs...

66
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:51,135
- I banged into you?
- Don't you remember?

67
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:53,572
In the bargain yourfiile
fell down, so did mine.

68
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:57,042
And in the process,
the papers got mixed up!

69
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:02,309
I think we should now interview her.
What's your shorthand speed?

70
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:06,615
I don't know shorthand
but my English is good!

71
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:08,691
What's yourtyping speed?

72
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:12,088
I don't know typing but...
I write very fast.

73
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:16,287
I'd complete a three hour exam
paper in 11/2 hours and run out!

74
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:18,524
You may leave.

75
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:21,099
I can leave? Does that mean
I've got the job?

76
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:23,499
Please call the next candidate.

77
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:27,307
But... why are you calling the next
candidate when I've been selected?

78
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,911
A knowledge of shorthand and
typing is essential forthis job.

79
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:32,104
Give me one chance.

80
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:35,648
- I'll learn...
- This is no training school!

81
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:39,618
I need an efficient secretary
to run this huge office!

82
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:41,847
You may leave!

83
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:05,139
This is not the place to
throw fiiles and certifiicates.

84
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:07,272
They are trash for me!

85
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,951
I came for an interview
but he didn't conduct it!

86
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:13,851
He only asked me one question,
if I know shorthand and typing!

87
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:18,154
- I said, no. He asked me to leave!
- Did he say that?

88
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:22,659
Yes. Didn't people work when
there was no shorthand and typing?

89
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:26,062
- Yes, they did.
- Let me ask you something.

90
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:30,263
- Do you know shorthand, typing?
- How would I know?

91
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:33,203
So there! Yet I'm sure
you work pretty well.

92
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:37,904
Yes I do work all right but
you should explain this to him.

93
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,880
If he'd listen. But he started off
like a machine gun soon as I entered.

94
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:47,078
I don't understand who
gave him the MD's chair!

95
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:53,820
You... don't know anything.
I came here with such difficulty.

96
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:56,724
I'm not familiarwith Bombay streets.

97
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:59,299
I could fiind neither
rickshaw nortaxi.

98
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:02,269
Yet I came here.

99
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:05,874
With the hope that my
boss would be very happy.

100
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,031
You're crying...

101
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:10,874
- Why would I cry?
- Look, my child...

102
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:15,541
Tears turn into waterwhen they
flow but turn to poison inside.

103
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:17,744
Let them flow out.

104
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:22,254
By the way, who made you cry?

105
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,293
The Managing Director of
the Oberoi group of industries!

106
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:29,056
- That must be Vicky.
- That's right.

107
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:36,197
- You've brought me back there!
- Where are you going? Come here.

108
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:40,567
Let us leave or he'll
lose his shirt again!

109
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:43,677
Come here, Suri.
Where are you going?

110
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,280
Make out an appointment letter
in Miss Mehra's name. Pronto.

111
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:49,679
What are you doing?
How can you appoint me?

112
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,479
Why not? Do I look like riffraff?

113
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:54,722
You look very honorable.

114
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:58,587
But he's very dangerous!
He'll fiire you because of me!

115
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:01,162
He can't fiire me.

116
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,231
- Why not? - He's the Managing
Directorwhile I'm the Chairman.

117
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,426
- What?
- And also his father!

118
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:14,637
Here's your appointment letter
You're joining us tomorrow.

119
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:23,742
Get to work.

120
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:28,182
Grandma! Grandma!

121
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:36,756
Grandma, sir has come.

122
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:39,799
He's come? He's had it today!

123
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:44,269
Relax, grandma. Control yourtemper.
- You shut up!

124
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,309
- Yes, mother?
- Is this the time to come home?

125
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,411
I'd asked you to come at 5!

126
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:52,572
I'm sorry. I was in the office.

127
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,774
Is your office more important
than Prem's drama?

128
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:59,377
We're all ready for half an hour.
Now hurry up orwe'll be late.

129
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:04,026
The son of Industrialist
Balraj Oberoi is an actor!

130
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:07,323
Prem is not fooling around.
He's acting in a stage play.

131
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,022
You keep quiet. You're his elder
brother. You should explain to him.

132
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,660
He must concentrate on business
instead of these wasteful hobbies.

133
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,364
Why does he need to work?

134
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,941
I am here. Let him do
whatever he feels like.

135
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:24,342
He's become responsible on his own.

136
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:28,984
You're spoiling him! He's
sheltered by you! Wasting money!

137
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:32,245
- Why have you made money? Forthese
sons, isn't it? - Mother, you...

138
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:35,355
Get the car out.

139
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:38,255
- Will they come with us?
- Of course.

140
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:44,266
You should have told me. I'd lock
the office and get my staff along.

141
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:47,664
Apart from us, who
would watch his play?

142
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,465
Don't underestimate Prem.

143
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:55,776
One day Prem will be the
brightest star of the stage.

144
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:04,212
Oh Lord in the sky,
listen to my plea if you exist.

145
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,559
There are hundreds of girls
in the world. Find one for me!

146
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:29,334
My father's daughter
calls me brother

147
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:34,074
My father's wife calls me son

148
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:48,353
My mother's brother
calls me nephew

149
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:50,692
My brother's daughter
calls me uncle

150
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:54,859
Oh Lord!
You've given me everything'

151
00:14:55,004 --> 00:15:00,032
Now give me a pretty wife
who'll call me husband

152
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,331
It'll be nice to fiind
someone calling me husband

153
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:38,072
She'll have a child
calling me daddy

154
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:42,843
The child will get married
and also have a child

155
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:47,648
My daughter-in-law will call me
father-in-law and the child, grandpa

156
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:52,351
You've kept me unmarried.
What mistake have I made?

157
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,490
My lovely sons would've given me
the next beauty

158
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:05,099
Give me the girl that
you want to give me soon

159
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:09,795
For all my trust in you, my
marriageable age may pass by

160
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:14,601
I may get old and may
have to carry a stick

161
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,213
I'm telling it to you because
you rule the world

162
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:43,537
God, you've given
me everything

163
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:48,039
Now give me a sister-in-law who'll
call me her brother-in-law

164
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:30,844
- Have we already reached Bandra?
- No, Bandra is quite far.

165
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,921
- Then why did you stop the cab?
- It's conked off.

166
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:37,149
- No, that's not possible.
- Why?

167
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,419
It's a machine.
Anything can happen.

168
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:43,157
Why don't you understand?
Today is my fiirst day at work.

169
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,425
Incidentally it's
my fiirst day too.

170
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:49,226
Now I'll lose my job.
You're not even trying!

171
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:53,030
I've got a job with such
difficulty. Now I'll lose it!

172
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,437
It's not empty.

173
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,771
Where will I get a cab?

174
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:05,078
Excuse me. Excuse me...

175
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,178
- Are you going to Bandra?
- No.

176
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:09,291
But I have to go to Bandra.

177
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:16,422
Today is my fiirst day at work.
If I'm late it will be my last day!

178
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,596
- So what can I do?
- Don't do anything.

179
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:21,133
Just take me to Bandra.

180
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:25,606
Now stop staring.
You can stare on the way.

181
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:30,444
The signal has changed to green!
Start the car! Please!

182
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,813
- Drive fast.
- Tell me one thing.

183
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:43,651
Is it your habit to sit in
anyone's car or your hobby?

184
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:47,056
I've no option. Else
I'd hate to sit in your car!

185
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:50,923
What are you looking at?
Glare in front!

186
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:56,269
I'll drive slow! Slow!

187
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:59,032
I'll turn right!

188
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,175
You want to go to Bandra?
Then shut up!

189
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,876
Stop! Stop!

190
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,488
Open this...

191
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:24,491
You gave me a lift forfree
So I'll give you free advice.

192
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,361
Don't look around and drive.
You might meet with an accident.

193
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:29,403
- You're getting late?
- Now go away.

194
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:32,502
What a character!

195
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:37,075
Good day.

196
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:41,773
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to work.

197
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:43,976
Not to see yourface.

198
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:46,984
Didn't I tell you there's
nothing here that you can do.

199
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:49,887
- I have the appointment letter.
- Who gave it to you?

200
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:52,720
The one who is above you.

201
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:55,523
- The Chairman sir.
- Show me the letter. - All right.

202
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,136
Where has it gone?
I'd brought it along.

203
00:21:04,273 --> 00:21:07,140
Do you think this ploy
will get you the job?

204
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:10,939
No sir. It's the truth.
One minute...

205
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:21,254
- Where is it?
- Your letter.

206
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,358
- You left it in the car.
- You!

207
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,250
He's my friend. He gave
me a lift in the morning.

208
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:29,556
Stop glaring at him
and read this.

209
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,762
That's all right.
Will you please come in?

210
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:35,059
- Go in.
- Come on.

211
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:40,069
Talk politely to him.
He's a good man.

212
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:42,268
What are you father and son up to?

213
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,479
One gives her a job and
the otherflirts with her!

214
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,179
What? This girl? She's crazy!

215
00:21:48,383 --> 00:21:51,614
She sat in my car, told me to drop
her as it's herfiirst day at work.

216
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:53,721
How was I to know she works here?

217
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:57,983
- She says she's yourfriend.
- Friend? She's lying!

218
00:21:58,093 --> 00:22:01,028
Creating a rift between brothers
on herfiirst day. Confusion next!

219
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,963
I say, lift the phone and
turn herfiirst day to her last!

220
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:09,035
Send in the girl who has just come.

221
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:13,741
- Arms look good.
- Just exercised.

222
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,344
- Why is your paunch showing?
- Just had breakfast.

223
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:21,741
- She's come.
- Yes? - Welcome.

224
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,142
Did you call for me?

225
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,853
- Tell him for how long...
- Just a minute.

226
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:28,156
Since when do you know him?

227
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:31,258
Him? 9.45...

228
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:34,792
- What's the time?
- 15 past 10.

229
00:22:35,164 --> 00:22:37,758
- For half an hour.
- Half an hour?

230
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:49,671
Whom are you laughing at? Me?

231
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:52,608
- Go on.
- Yes, carry on.

232
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:03,052
- Who gave this fool a job?
- Who else?

233
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:12,558
What kind of a girl is this?
What clothes she's wearing!

234
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:16,736
No problem. Hail the Lord
and neverworry.

235
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,736
Look at this. She's
one in a million.

236
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:24,170
She's very pretty.

237
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:26,678
But Vicky won't approve of her.

238
00:23:26,848 --> 00:23:31,080
The whole nation is
crazy about her.

239
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:35,687
And you rejected her!
What kind of girl do you want?

240
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:39,554
The one whom you set eyes on
and a voice sings from your heart.

241
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:42,858
- She's the one.
- Give me the bag.

242
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:46,000
She's the one who will
bring joys to my son's life.

243
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:48,568
- He'll look at her and agree.
- No!!

244
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:56,166
- You're back?
- I came to see mother.

245
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:58,505
- Seen her? - Yes.
- Then leave.

246
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:05,512
Please grandma. I've told you
I don't want to get married.

247
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:09,157
- How'll you spend life? - I've
spent it so long. I'll manage.

248
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:15,856
When will he get over old memories?

249
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,832
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you for 10 minutes.

250
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:30,968
Only 10 minutes not 10 hours!

251
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:33,137
You know I can't wait long.

252
00:24:33,282 --> 00:24:36,649
So you trouble Mummy,
Daddy the neighbours?

253
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:41,045
Tell your parents, today I'm
blowing the horn at their house.

254
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,052
Tomorrow they'll come to my
house and I won't send you.

255
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,356
Now aren't we getting late?

256
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:49,464
Shall we leave?

257
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,765
Do you love me so much?

258
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,902
A lot. I can't live without
you for even a minute.

259
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:04,306
Tell yourfamily to
marry us off soon.

260
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:07,711
My parents did say
they'd marry us in a year.

261
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:09,817
Ayear?

262
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:15,220
You're driving so fast!

263
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:19,123
- Ayear is too long.
- I'll convince them for 6 months.

264
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:21,523
- Slow down.
- 6 months?

265
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:28,429
Okay, 3 months! Now slow down!

266
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:34,737
Then shall we get married tomorrow?

267
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:12,138
Pills for hypertension?

268
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:14,248
Sir needs this bad.

269
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:18,614
What a temper.
He's bound to be sick.

270
00:26:19,755 --> 00:26:21,916
Window?

271
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:25,949
Fresh airwill make him feel better.

272
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,229
What's happening?

273
00:26:40,342 --> 00:26:42,469
What's going on?

274
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:46,137
- Breeze...
- Shut the window!

275
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:48,646
Shut the window!
Can't you hear me?

276
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,331
- All right.
- What's wrong?

277
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,433
My head is splitting!

278
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:09,297
- Shall I give you a pill for
hypertension? - No.

279
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:11,804
Pick up those papers
and please staple them.

280
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,703
- Which ones?
- These!

281
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:22,406
- What are you looking for?
- This is a stapler! - Yes.

282
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,508
Hurry up!

283
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:30,153
What have you done?

284
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,961
- Sorry!
- What's wrong?

285
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:46,331
Son, what's the matter?
Why are you screaming?

286
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:50,741
- He has fiired me!
- Fired you? Why?

287
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:53,743
Either I stay in
this office or she!

288
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:02,686
Yourtie looks great.
Starting a new trend?

289
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,985
Take this girl away.
She's good for nothing!

290
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:08,822
She's a good girl.

291
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:10,897
Slowly she'll learn everything.

292
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:19,501
- Come, my dear.
- I'll keep the scissor.

293
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:27,306
I am the hero of my area

294
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:36,418
Did you take me
for anything less?

295
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:48,669
Get aside, lady

296
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:57,140
Get aside.
I am in an angry mood

297
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,188
Let go of her!

298
00:29:11,326 --> 00:29:13,317
- She's a crazy girl!
- Why?

299
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:15,895
She forced herself into
my car yesterday.

300
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:18,499
- You sat in his car?
- It was my fiirst day.

301
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,893
- That is why. Yes.
- Today she follows me here.

302
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:26,030
You don't know her.
She's my dear niece.

303
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:29,540
- Good day.
- Good day.

304
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,703
Cast her opposite me.

305
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,213
She's come here to work not act.

306
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,407
I know where she works.

307
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,548
Being the master, I don't go there
What will she do there?

308
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:42,713
- Do you work for him?
- Yes. For his elder brother.

309
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:45,826
- You don't know his temper.
- I do.

310
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:48,962
He's as dangerous as I'm sweet.

311
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,758
Rememberthat dialogue.
We'll use it in some scene.

312
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,728
Let's go. Aunt must be waiting.

313
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:57,429
- Hey, uncle! Come here.
- Going to aunt.

314
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,764
- Let's rehearse.
- Aunt...

315
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,738
Why are you getting me
into trouble?

316
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:06,573
What? We lost this contract too!

317
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:10,677
How can that be possible?
Ourtenderwas quite low.

318
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:14,046
What was the difference in the
tender of that company and us?

319
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:16,951
All right. Fiind out and call me.

320
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:22,886
Call me later. I'm very busy now.

321
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:28,667
- Sir, what's the matter?
- We lost the contract again.

322
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,898
- Again?
- That's what I don't understand.

323
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:34,871
We haven't got any contract
forthe past three years.

324
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:38,273
It can be a co-incidence once.
Twice... but the third time...

325
00:30:38,513 --> 00:30:41,710
We have been missing out on the
contract at very low differences.

326
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,907
This time it's just 2 bucks.

327
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:47,577
- How do you know?
- I saw the price list.

328
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:52,091
I just spoke on the phone.
The price will be opened tomorrow.

329
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:55,390
This means you're the traitor!

330
00:30:55,597 --> 00:30:58,896
We pay you and you work for others!

331
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,125
How much did you sell yourself for?

332
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:04,737
- Forgive me, sir.
- Vicky neverforgives betrayers!

333
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:29,760
- You haven't left? - Neither have
you. - You should have gone.

334
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:33,263
- I thought you might need me.
- Nothing of that sort.

335
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:35,359
- I'll drop you home.
- Okay.

336
00:31:44,713 --> 00:31:49,207
- What's wrong?
- I left my bag.

337
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:53,988
Has there ever been a day in your
life when you did something...

338
00:31:54,189 --> 00:31:56,680
...without falling orforgetting?

339
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:03,224
I'll get it.

340
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:37,855
You use your hands too much.

341
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,731
Let's go. That's enough.

342
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:26,542
Anybody around?

343
00:33:26,848 --> 00:33:28,873
Are you all right?

344
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:33,076
Please hurry up.

345
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:36,457
- Emergency case.
- It's a deep gash.

346
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:39,854
Madam, it's a police case.
Inform the police.

347
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:44,456
Doctor, where are you going?
There's so much blood flowing.

348
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:47,200
I can't do a thing
till the police comes.

349
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:50,098
The police? What will they do?

350
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:54,264
Will they treat him? You
yourself said it's a deep wound.

351
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:56,705
And you refuse to treat him!

352
00:33:56,878 --> 00:33:59,176
God forbid if something
happens to him...

353
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,111
What kind of a doctor are you?
It's your duty to save human life!

354
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:06,617
You swearto save human life
when you get your degree.

355
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:08,322
And you forget it once
you become doctors!

356
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:10,548
Don't you care about his life?

357
00:34:11,693 --> 00:34:15,527
I beg you doctor...

358
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:17,665
Don't do this!

359
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:20,027
Save his life!

360
00:34:29,644 --> 00:34:32,841
You stay here.

361
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,660
- What happened?
- He...

362
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:51,597
Nothing. Nothing will
happen to my Vicky.

363
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,896
Nothing will happen.

364
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:00,105
- How is my son?
- He's all right.

365
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:04,176
- No need to worry.
- Didn't I say he'll be fiine?

366
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:08,942
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank her not me.

367
00:35:09,183 --> 00:35:12,118
She brought the patient here
in time and saved his life.

368
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,756
She also reminded me of my duty.

369
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:22,855
Avery sweet child.

370
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:32,337
He has a deep wound on his head.

371
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:36,534
I can't say anything till
he regains consciousness.

372
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:46,643
You are aware that there are
only three actors in this world.

373
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,449
And me.

374
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:53,387
Dilip Kumar climbed the
stairs of yourtemple.

375
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:56,088
Amitabh Bachhan rang
the bell of yourtemple.

376
00:35:56,264 --> 00:35:59,256
I can't ring the bell because
of the way you made me!

377
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,291
My hands doesn't reach the bell!

378
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:03,336
Dilip Kumar came for his love.

379
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:06,801
Amitabh came for his mother.
I've come for my brother.

380
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:10,900
Both of them fought with you
yet you made their scenes hit!

381
00:36:11,112 --> 00:36:13,342
I'm standing before you
with folded hands.

382
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:16,312
Folded hands...

383
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:18,508
Save my brother's life.

384
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:20,745
I'll assume my scene is a hit.

385
00:36:21,022 --> 00:36:23,320
Please save him.

386
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:32,724
- How do you feel, my son?
- He's absolutely fiine.

387
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:35,026
He'll be home in 2 days.

388
00:36:40,975 --> 00:36:43,967
- Is brother all right?
- See for yourself.

389
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:51,049
Brother is fiine!
My scene is a hit!

390
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:53,946
- Let's go home and exercise.
- What's the day today?

391
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:56,851
We'll sign on!

392
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:03,887
What have you brought?

393
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:07,124
You shouldn't call from behind.
You made me drop the fiiles!

394
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:11,738
Now help me pick them up.
Sirwill be angry if he sees this.

395
00:37:11,906 --> 00:37:14,397
So many fiiles?
Have you locked the office?

396
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:17,303
Sir asked me to get
the important fiiles.

397
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:20,812
I thought all the fiiles are vital.
He might need any of them.

398
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:23,606
So I brought them all over.
Did I do right?

399
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:27,254
Absolutely. I've been saying this
from day one. You can't do wrong!

400
00:37:27,422 --> 00:37:31,017
- Where is sir?
- In his room.

401
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,321
What are you muttering in English?

402
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,424
Tell me the name of
the medicine in Hindi.

403
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:42,626
Doctor says brother is fiine.

404
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,136
He only needs some peace.

405
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:49,869
How can he get peace?
He wants to open an office at home.

406
00:37:50,078 --> 00:37:52,478
- Look at these!
- I asked for one fiile!

407
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:58,450
Forget your office
and work for 10 days.

408
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:01,917
Send him to a hill station
for 10 days.

409
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:05,881
I think we all should
. the farm house.

410
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,891
- Pack the bags immediately.
- But Dad the office...

411
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,591
The office existed even
before you were born.

412
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:21,205
It won't shut in a week.
We're all going to the farm house.

413
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:23,603
I'll take leave.

414
00:38:23,644 --> 00:38:27,136
- We're leaving tomorrow not today.
- You too must join us.

415
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:30,715
But I must take permission
from my uncle and aunt.

416
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:34,413
- So do that.
- Uncle's boat bobs in the stream.

417
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:37,724
Uncle, give me permission.
Uncle gives permission.

418
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,726
- Uncle will accompany you.
- So will aunt.

419
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:43,831
Even the doctorwill come.

420
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,659
- Why will you come?
- It's mental stress.

421
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:10,722
I've just been discharged from
hospital. Exercise will set me right.

422
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:13,588
Why are you laughing, shorty?

423
00:39:13,794 --> 00:39:16,388
- Here she comes.
- Why have you come here?

424
00:39:16,497 --> 00:39:18,897
- What is it?
- Grandma...

425
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:21,524
Aren't you ashamed to
ogle at two young men?

426
00:39:24,138 --> 00:39:26,402
What sorry? Pick that up
and pass it to me.

427
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:32,704
Forget it.

428
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:38,217
All right. Tell us,
whose body is better.

429
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:41,344
But hear me out
before you answer.

430
00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:44,855
I can't tolerate criticism. Nor
can I bear brother being criticized.

431
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:48,928
You don't seem like two.

432
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,328
It appears as if there's
a mirror between you.

433
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:55,059
Grandma has called you
for breakfast. Come fast.

434
00:39:55,236 --> 00:39:58,728
Brother, this fool seems very clever.

435
00:39:58,873 --> 00:40:01,774
But she's right. We are one.

436
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:07,744
Grandma!

437
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:11,544
- Breakfast looks inviting...
- You're not allowed to eat that.

438
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:14,243
This boiled egg is for you.

439
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:16,855
Take your pills.
Your blood pressure will rise.

440
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,753
I came here for nothing.
Sapna has taken over my job.

441
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:26,264
Get breakfast overwith.
I'll ask the driverto drop you home.

442
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,901
You would want me to go back.

443
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,004
So you can eat whatever you want.

444
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:36,610
Eat, Dad. The doctor is here.

445
00:40:36,877 --> 00:40:39,675
- I can't disobey my son.
- What fun!

446
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,408
- What's the matter? - Khanna in
the house next door had diabetes.

447
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:47,916
He came to the farm house
one day, ate all that he wanted.

448
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:50,589
Today his grave lies
behind the house.

449
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:53,193
Speak auspiciously.

450
00:40:53,394 --> 00:40:58,491
One thing is sure. It's more
enjoyable to eat your own choice.

451
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:04,260
What delicious food! Nandu, if your
hands weren't ugly, I'd kiss them!

452
00:41:04,538 --> 00:41:06,768
The one who cooked this
has pretty hands.

453
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:08,842
- Who cooked?
- Sapna.

454
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:12,036
Really? Give them to me!

455
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:14,337
Careful, brother!

456
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:37,193
Give me your hands. Come on.

457
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:49,205
Whom are you laughing at? Me?

458
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:51,681
- Or me? - No...
- Say sorry!

459
00:42:21,882 --> 00:42:26,876
Girls nowadays
are just great

460
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:41,201
They have someone in the heart

461
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:45,396
And they fall for someone else

462
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:51,376
Boys nowadays are great too

463
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:05,725
They flip for any girl
they see

464
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:38,291
The spicy one is now bitter, too

465
00:43:42,696 --> 00:43:48,498
She's short is height,
but makes tall claims

466
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:59,113
We know, he's scared of even
the most timid creatures

467
00:44:03,217 --> 00:44:09,156
And he says to us that he'll
fiight a tigertoo

468
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:16,560
His face resembles Salman's

469
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:19,827
Tell this fool not to consider
himself to be a hero

470
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:23,128
She wears high heels
and black glasses...

471
00:44:23,337 --> 00:44:26,738
and thinks she's Karisma

472
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:32,540
Butterflies these days
are so very strange

473
00:45:07,815 --> 00:45:13,310
Look friends, how a monkey
prances about like a stork

474
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:23,322
She wants to dance and
sing without knowing how to

475
00:45:28,135 --> 00:45:34,040
One who doesn't get it,
says that the grapes are sour

476
00:45:38,245 --> 00:45:44,047
I usually stay away
from such boys

477
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:51,284
I have something in me for
which, every girl loves me

478
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:54,655
She walks around looking
at me all day

479
00:45:54,762 --> 00:45:58,095
My brother, don't fall
for her pranks

480
00:45:58,265 --> 00:46:01,393
Or you'll get burnt
by this current

481
00:46:01,702 --> 00:46:07,038
Currents nowadays
are just great

482
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:38,929
She has bathed in
the juices of flowers

483
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:42,531
She has come from
the world of stars

484
00:46:42,743 --> 00:46:45,837
She's beautiful

485
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,438
You have made a place
in everyone's heart

486
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:55,555
Whichever house you go to,
you'll bring light into it

487
00:46:55,789 --> 00:46:59,156
You'll light the
lamp of happiness

488
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:02,786
And you'll make
their destiny glow

489
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,832
Aim carefully.
You miss and I'm dead.

490
00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:54,873
Shoot like Dilip Kumar.

491
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:58,848
No, uncle. Don't move.

492
00:47:59,053 --> 00:48:01,317
Or you could lose your life.

493
00:48:01,622 --> 00:48:05,422
Mister Dilip has held a gun
today forthe very fiirst time.

494
00:48:12,633 --> 00:48:17,195
- I'm alive! - Now you won't
escape. This orange is smaller.

495
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:22,205
- That's too small! - That's fiine
but this fiig is real tiny.

496
00:48:22,443 --> 00:48:24,411
This is fiine.

497
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:28,811
Shoot like Amitabh Bachhan.

498
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:34,313
No! That's Amitabh Bachhan.
He shoots with his left hand!

499
00:48:34,521 --> 00:48:38,753
He's a born left hander. You're
born a right hander. Careful!

500
00:48:38,926 --> 00:48:41,224
Close your eyes.

501
00:48:41,361 --> 00:48:46,128
Hey, shut up! Talk too much
and I'll splatter your brains!

502
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:56,371
I'm alive! Saved!

503
00:48:56,543 --> 00:49:00,206
You're not safe.
This fiig is smaller.

504
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:03,211
No! This is cheating!

505
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:10,782
You may move all you want because
my style is totally different.

506
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:14,683
That's a date. I can
shoot a grape with this.

507
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:17,922
Dilip Kumar and
Amitabh Bachhan are done.

508
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:20,327
Now what style will Prem use?

509
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:23,493
- He hasn't formed his style.
- Shut your eyes.

510
00:49:23,704 --> 00:49:27,606
I'm taking you away from Prem.

511
00:49:27,808 --> 00:49:30,038
Can I mount him?

512
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,407
Sure, why not? Come here.
Have you ridden a horse earlier?

513
00:49:33,547 --> 00:49:35,947
No. But one must try
everything once in life.

514
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:48,319
- What is this?
- Open your eyes.

515
00:49:50,164 --> 00:49:54,726
You guys cheated and
brought me here. My niece!

516
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:56,859
Help!

517
00:49:57,137 --> 00:50:00,334
- Stop the horse!
- Save my niece!

518
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,374
Dad's running. Hope he
doesn't get a heart attack!

519
00:50:02,543 --> 00:50:04,943
- The doctor is with him.
- He's had two by passes!

520
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:07,545
My niece! My niece!

521
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:09,978
Stop the horse!

522
00:50:11,185 --> 00:50:14,643
Come on.

523
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:18,053
Help! Stop for a minute.

524
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,691
Help! Anybody around?

525
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:31,167
Save me!

526
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:33,862
Anybody around?

527
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:37,268
Somebody save me!

528
00:50:37,511 --> 00:50:39,877
Stop!

529
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:09,038
- She'll get the fiirst prize.
- We'll have to stop her.

530
00:51:09,142 --> 00:51:11,736
- She's a jockey.
- Still we have to stop her.

531
00:51:11,879 --> 00:51:14,746
The mare is quite stubborn.
To top it, she's also adamant.

532
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:16,882
That is why we have to save her.

533
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,679
- In the worst scene she'll fall.
- Shorty! - Then go rescue her.

534
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:27,452
- Help me!
- My brother is coming to save you.

535
00:51:28,695 --> 00:51:30,686
- Help!
- I guarantee you she won't survive.

536
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:37,860
Brother, she's crying.

537
00:51:38,171 --> 00:51:40,264
She's not happy that we saved her.

538
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:42,806
- Then put her back on the mare.
- Go back... - No!

539
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:47,470
- Whom are you crying at? Me?
- No. - At me?

540
00:51:48,682 --> 00:51:51,173
- Say sorry.
- Come on.

541
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:53,276
Come on home.

542
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:59,781
- Are you all right? - Yes.
- Not hurt? - No, I'm fiine.

543
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:03,124
Vicky saved my Sapna.

544
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:07,130
- Niece, are you all right?
- What is this niece business?

545
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:10,725
When you don't know riding,
why did you have to race the horse?

546
00:52:10,871 --> 00:52:13,533
I didn't race her.
She ran off on her own.

547
00:52:14,574 --> 00:52:20,535
- Was the mare mad to run? - The gun
frightened her & she took off with me.

548
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:24,444
- Don't you care about your niece?
- What did he do?

549
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:27,549
He placed an orange on his
head and asked us to shoot it.

550
00:52:27,754 --> 00:52:30,951
- What? - He shot... - And the
horse got scared by the gun shot.

551
00:52:31,091 --> 00:52:34,458
Why did you mount the horse
when you can't ride for nuts?

552
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:37,455
- Mare... - Forget it now.
- Daddy has come!

553
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:40,064
- She's nervous. Let's go in.
- Yes, come in.

554
00:52:42,703 --> 00:52:44,967
- Uncle, they're left...
- What?

555
00:52:45,172 --> 00:52:47,072
Two grapes, a peanut and a pill.

556
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,869
- I won't let you shoot them!
- Why?

557
00:52:55,082 --> 00:52:57,778
He refuses to get out!

558
00:52:58,185 --> 00:53:01,552
- I'm not out. That was a shot.
- Why won't you get out?

559
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:04,213
- How can you do that?
- Is this your age to play?

560
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:07,259
- What has age got to do with it?
- You're out. Go and bowl.

561
00:53:07,427 --> 00:53:11,056
- I'm the umpire.
- You're a fraud.

562
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:13,165
Nobody take the catch.

563
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:24,742
She's gone in the water! My niece!

564
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:28,039
- Help!
- Help her!

565
00:53:28,181 --> 00:53:31,150
Come out of the water!

566
00:53:32,352 --> 00:53:37,756
- She looks lovely as she drowns.
- Save her! Don't talk of drowning!

567
00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:40,156
- You save her.
- I can't swim!

568
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,590
Shorty, will you go or should I?

569
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:49,066
Sapna will lose her
life in your jokes!

570
00:53:49,202 --> 00:53:52,660
- Then you go.
- No, I have a heart problem.

571
00:53:52,773 --> 00:53:55,571
- No problem when you play cricket!
- Now go on!

572
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:57,973
- Go on.
- Save her! Don't discuss!

573
00:53:58,178 --> 00:54:01,341
Give the bracelet.
The watch is water proof!

574
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:04,815
- It's a gift from Daddy.
- Go and save her!

575
00:54:08,021 --> 00:54:10,353
Don't take off your pants.

576
00:54:12,526 --> 00:54:15,324
Help! Help!

577
00:54:47,861 --> 00:54:49,954
Grandma!

578
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:52,996
- You fiight very well.
- You lie very well.

579
00:54:53,266 --> 00:54:55,598
The water in the swimming
pool is very clean.

580
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:01,905
Let it be. You look afterthe
others. I'll make the tea.

581
00:55:02,109 --> 00:55:04,703
She's my pretty and lovely girl.

582
00:55:04,811 --> 00:55:06,904
She's like the beautiful rose.

583
00:55:07,114 --> 00:55:10,914
She's the apple of my eye.

584
00:55:11,118 --> 00:55:15,214
To tell you the truth,
we didn't have our own kids...

585
00:55:15,355 --> 00:55:17,721
...so she doesn't miss her parents.

586
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:20,254
Now we have but one dream.

587
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:24,122
To get her married to a
good boy from a good family.

588
00:55:24,264 --> 00:55:27,131
- How much sugar?
- Half a teaspoon.

589
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:29,235
- That's all?
- Have you seen a boy?

590
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:33,430
We have but what can I say...

591
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,336
We don't have the
courage to talk to them.

592
00:55:36,443 --> 00:55:39,139
- Why?
- He's from a very wealthy family.

593
00:55:39,446 --> 00:55:41,539
Sugar? Half a teaspoon...

594
00:55:41,748 --> 00:55:46,583
So what? They won't fiind a
bride as talented as Sapna.

595
00:55:46,753 --> 00:55:50,450
That's quite true.
Grandma, you are great!

596
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,558
You have seen Sapna.
How she takes care of all.

597
00:55:54,761 --> 00:55:58,788
Specially of Vicky.
His diet, his medication...

598
00:56:03,203 --> 00:56:05,194
I love you.

599
00:56:05,438 --> 00:56:08,532
I neverfound the chance to tell you.

600
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:12,303
You were always surrounded
by grandma or uncle or aunt.

601
00:56:12,445 --> 00:56:16,438
I'll keep you happy. Very happy.

602
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:27,318
- Answer me.
- I'll answer you! Rascal!

603
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,759
Is this a prank?
It's not funny!

604
00:56:30,931 --> 00:56:35,732
Great performance! What an actor!

605
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:39,327
He was rehearsing with him but
couldn't arouse the feelings. Hence...

606
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:41,532
Hearthat. I was acting!

607
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:46,075
Wonderful! I think you should
give up theater and get into fiilms.

608
00:56:46,246 --> 00:56:49,647
That's just what I'll do because
there are only 3 actors in India.

609
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:52,946
The fiirst is Dilip Kumar, second
Amitabh Bachhan and the third...

610
00:56:53,153 --> 00:56:56,281
...is you, my brother.
- Yes, come on, my brother.

611
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:02,819
She's coming. Murari, get my bag.

612
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:07,298
- Sir, I don't have time. - Talk
softly! - I have no time.

613
00:57:07,434 --> 00:57:10,597
What's the matter?

614
00:57:10,804 --> 00:57:14,501
I want to meet Daddy and nobody will
get my bag! - I'll get it. - Really?

615
00:57:14,608 --> 00:57:16,542
Yes. No problem, sir.

616
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:20,010
First time a girl will get my bag
from my bedroom. But it's in the car!

617
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:23,206
We had great fun.
The trip was great.

618
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:25,316
It was really great.
Put the luggage in.

619
00:57:25,418 --> 00:57:28,410
- Where is Sapna?
- She'll come with uncle.

620
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:31,419
- Then let us leave.
- Sure, come on.

621
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:35,254
- Prem, let's go.
- Then who will drive this car?

622
00:57:35,362 --> 00:57:37,922
I'll drive.

623
00:57:38,064 --> 00:57:41,329
- What problem?
- The doctor is here.

624
00:57:41,434 --> 00:57:45,530
- He's already had two by passes!
- He's joking. - Son, you drive us.

625
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:57,575
Go home and write.

626
00:57:58,485 --> 00:58:00,817
She's gone with grandma.

627
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,885
- I'll come with you.
- Why? Go with yourwife.

628
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,981
- She's got work at home.
- What work?

629
00:58:06,293 --> 00:58:08,488
- She'll bash me.
- She's become fat?

630
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:12,587
- She looks ugly?
- I didn't say that!

631
00:58:12,932 --> 00:58:16,698
- He's saying that.
- Come home. I'll show you!

632
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:29,111
Sir, there's no bag inside.

633
00:58:29,316 --> 00:58:32,513
Call me Prem, not sir.

634
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:36,314
- The bag is not inside.
- I know that.

635
00:58:36,523 --> 00:58:40,550
- It's in the boot.
- Is it? But where's everybody?

636
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:43,924
- They've gone.
- Why did they leave me?

637
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,462
They've left you for me.

638
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:49,031
Will you come with me?

639
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:51,931
Shall I deliver a dialogue?

640
00:58:52,138 --> 00:58:56,336
Forthe fiirst time, a girl
will sit on my car's front seat.

641
00:58:56,443 --> 00:58:58,877
My Madhuri Dixit.

642
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:03,277
My Madhuri Dixit!

643
00:59:24,003 --> 00:59:27,097
Someone stealthily
comes into my dreams

644
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:31,038
Someone keeps me awake
the whole night

645
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:35,739
My heart is restless

646
00:59:35,915 --> 00:59:43,219
I think I have fallen in love

647
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:48,677
I'm faltering in my step

648
01:00:48,822 --> 01:00:52,519
This is the fiirst feeling
of its kind

649
01:00:52,826 --> 01:00:58,628
I don't know what happened when

650
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:09,931
How can I tell you
the state of my craziness?

651
01:01:11,144 --> 01:01:16,741
How can I tell what is
happening in my heart

652
01:01:21,754 --> 01:01:24,484
'Someone is gradually
increasing my pain

653
01:01:24,757 --> 01:01:28,158
Someone is slowly
making me writhe

654
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:29,552
This never used to
happen to me earlier

655
01:02:29,656 --> 01:02:32,648
I never lost my senses

656
01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:36,761
I never lost my peace

657
01:02:42,502 --> 01:02:47,701
I stay awake the whole night,
and toss and turn

658
01:02:47,874 --> 01:02:51,970
I remain lost

659
01:02:52,178 --> 01:02:55,375
I wonderwhat I keep thinking

660
01:02:59,586 --> 01:03:02,419
Someone takes away my senses

661
01:03:02,722 --> 01:03:06,021
Someone just teases me around

662
01:03:56,476 --> 01:03:59,468
What's the matter, mother?
Why are you so sad?

663
01:03:59,779 --> 01:04:04,512
In 4 days, I've grown
so attached to this girl...

664
01:04:04,717 --> 01:04:07,311
Everything seems vacant.

665
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:12,321
It's just a few hours since she left
but I feel I haven't seen herfor days.

666
01:04:12,425 --> 01:04:14,416
- If she permanently...!
- If she permanently...!

667
01:04:14,527 --> 01:04:17,928
Comes here forever?

668
01:04:18,131 --> 01:04:22,431
- The best bride for Vicky.
- Vicky should agree to marry her.

669
01:04:22,535 --> 01:04:25,868
He will agree. I will
convince him this time.

670
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:42,944
Escorted her home? Now leave.
See you at the rehearsal tomorrow.

671
01:04:43,156 --> 01:04:45,886
Uncle, I feel I've fallen
in love with your niece.

672
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:48,684
- And she?
- I don't know.

673
01:04:48,995 --> 01:04:54,058
If she looks out of the window,
it means she too loves you.

674
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:57,998
- If she doesn't look out?
- Don't ever be seen in this area.

675
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:00,503
She's my niece!
I'll break your legs!

676
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,600
If she opens the window,
I too will be overjoyed.

677
01:05:06,713 --> 01:05:09,841
- She'll open it!
- Yes!

678
01:06:16,149 --> 01:06:20,108
You could fiind just
one fool in the town. Me!

679
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:22,844
- How did you guess that?
- Because I let you treat me!

680
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:25,547
I never see you go to another
patient.

681
01:06:25,825 --> 01:06:27,816
Not the time to be decent.

682
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,951
I leave all my patients
and come to see you.

683
01:06:30,129 --> 01:06:32,723
It's been so long.
Did you ask me fortea?

684
01:06:32,832 --> 01:06:34,766
No sweat. I'll get it now.

685
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:38,970
- Get some tea forthe doctor.
- I have some eats.

686
01:06:39,138 --> 01:06:44,235
- Get some tea for doctor.
- I have good clothes.

687
01:06:44,544 --> 01:06:47,445
I'm carrying shoes, sir!

688
01:06:49,549 --> 01:06:52,177
What's going on? Everyone is busy.

689
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:54,342
Nobody has the time to listen to me.

690
01:06:54,487 --> 01:06:58,753
- What's so special?
- There is something.

691
01:07:02,795 --> 01:07:05,093
The actorwas getting ready.

692
01:07:05,298 --> 01:07:07,493
Going for a play.

693
01:07:07,733 --> 01:07:09,701
I'm going to the office.

694
01:07:10,236 --> 01:07:12,500
Did you give me a sleeping pill?

695
01:07:12,705 --> 01:07:15,606
Why am I dreaming when I'm awake?

696
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:20,940
- I'm going to the office for Sapna
(dream). - Lord! Thank you. My son...

697
01:07:21,147 --> 01:07:23,513
Cut the over acting.

698
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:26,819
My son is going to
the office on his own!

699
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:30,855
Didn't I say, he'd realise
his responsibilities himself?

700
01:07:31,023 --> 01:07:34,925
You're going to the office
but what will you do there?

701
01:07:35,061 --> 01:07:37,154
You don't know any work.

702
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,924
Nobody teaches a donkey's
offspring to kick.

703
01:07:40,132 --> 01:07:42,123
What did he say?

704
01:07:43,936 --> 01:07:47,428
Dad, he said; you don't have
to teach a fiish to swim.

705
01:07:51,043 --> 01:07:54,240
I have something important to say.

706
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:58,248
- Put your heart in yourwork.
- I'm going for my heart.

707
01:08:11,197 --> 01:08:13,131
You... in the office?

708
01:08:13,499 --> 01:08:16,991
Who employed you, Miss Sapna?

709
01:08:17,103 --> 01:08:19,833
Do you address your boss
by his name?

710
01:08:20,006 --> 01:08:22,031
Address the boss as sir.

711
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:25,735
- All right.
- Say, sorry sir!

712
01:08:29,448 --> 01:08:34,852
- Come to my cabin.
- Why?

713
01:08:35,054 --> 01:08:38,512
I have to dictate an
important letter.

714
01:08:43,729 --> 01:08:47,028
Come in and write.

715
01:08:49,035 --> 01:08:51,333
Sometimes this thought
comes to mind...

716
01:08:55,474 --> 01:08:59,638
Just write. Sometimes
this thought comes to mind...

717
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:02,304
Why sometimes?
It should come everyday!

718
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:04,483
That's wrong. Write again.

719
01:09:04,717 --> 01:09:07,481
I love you very much, dearest.

720
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:10,117
I can swear by God if you wish.

721
01:09:10,356 --> 01:09:13,917
That's not a declaration of love.
Sounds like a testimony in court.

722
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:16,618
What do you actually
want me to write?

723
01:09:16,796 --> 01:09:18,889
I just want you to write
three simple words.

724
01:09:23,903 --> 01:09:27,202
But it's pretty normal.
Can't we have something different?

725
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:30,605
Why don't you ask me
to write that?

726
01:09:36,615 --> 01:09:39,516
Great! My son is really
working in office!

727
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:41,710
Tell me, what he's doing.

728
01:09:41,921 --> 01:09:44,719
- Ask him.
- Just an official letter.

729
01:09:44,857 --> 01:09:47,849
My son's fiirst official letter!
Read it out to me.

730
01:09:48,027 --> 01:09:50,518
- What's the point? - Why?
- You won't understand!

731
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:53,221
- Read it out.
- Yes, read it.

732
01:10:00,673 --> 01:10:03,335
One doesn't talk to
clients in that manner.

733
01:10:03,476 --> 01:10:06,741
There's a lot of difference
in yourworking style and mine.

734
01:10:06,946 --> 01:10:08,880
What will the horse eat
if he befriends the grass?

735
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:21,259
Aren't you ashamed
to be lying to my Dad?

736
01:10:21,394 --> 01:10:25,262
Had I told him the truth
he would have been hurt.

737
01:10:25,398 --> 01:10:29,061
- You should have let him be hurt!
- He thinks you've come here to work.

738
01:10:29,268 --> 01:10:33,170
But you considerthe office
a stage and continue acting!

739
01:10:33,305 --> 01:10:36,399
Look... try to understand...

740
01:10:36,776 --> 01:10:41,304
- I understand everything.
- So I don't have to say a word!

741
01:10:43,783 --> 01:10:47,378
No sir. I can't be compared to you.

742
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,511
You're there and I'm here.

743
01:10:49,822 --> 01:10:51,915
There's a lot of
difference between us.

744
01:11:00,533 --> 01:11:03,366
So you were saying, there's
a lot of difference between us.

745
01:11:03,536 --> 01:11:07,529
If it's a difference of
height, it's very good.

746
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:12,734
If it's a matter of colour. You're
fair and I'm not. That too is good.

747
01:11:12,845 --> 01:11:16,440
If it's a question of sex,
that's even better!

748
01:11:16,582 --> 01:11:20,541
But if it pinches you that
I'm rich and you're poor...

749
01:11:20,853 --> 01:11:24,186
- I'll erase the gap right now.
- Come here. - Yes sir?

750
01:11:24,423 --> 01:11:28,154
Give this to Mr. Oberoi and tell
him he has only one son, Vicky.

751
01:11:28,294 --> 01:11:31,354
- What are you saying?
- And tell Vicky, he has no brother.

752
01:11:31,464 --> 01:11:34,865
- Get it. Now go. - What's all this?
- Let's go in the bus.

753
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:36,935
All right.

754
01:11:37,069 --> 01:11:40,766
I'm willing to give up my car
and travel in a bus with you.

755
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:44,069
And you're not ready to give
up the bus and come in my car!

756
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,269
Is this how you love me?

757
01:11:46,445 --> 01:11:48,777
- What is okay?
- Come on.

758
01:11:48,914 --> 01:11:53,908
Come here. Give me the car keys.
Don't say anything to Vicky or Dad.

759
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,714
Get in from here.

760
01:11:56,922 --> 01:11:59,891
What logic! I wish I was
as tall as my logic!

761
01:12:25,284 --> 01:12:29,846
A little bit of peace
and a little of restlessness

762
01:12:33,759 --> 01:12:37,923
Whateverthey call it...
we call it love

763
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:57,977
This happens to
everyone sometime

764
01:13:01,854 --> 01:13:05,517
Whateverthey call it...
we call it love

765
01:13:26,745 --> 01:13:30,044
I just keep missing you

766
01:13:30,249 --> 01:13:33,650
You steal my sleep of the nights

767
01:13:33,886 --> 01:13:37,686
Your love, my dear...

768
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:41,587
makes my heart ache

769
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,314
Sometimes we meet,
sometimes we have to wait

770
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,862
My eyes are awake

771
01:14:58,971 --> 01:15:01,804
But we both are sleeping

772
01:15:02,007 --> 01:15:05,636
In our own thoughts...

773
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:09,647
we lovers are lost

774
01:15:25,831 --> 01:15:29,528
This is our state

775
01:15:29,735 --> 01:15:34,229
May someone believe it or not

776
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,035
There is a little fun and a
bit of intoxication

777
01:16:33,665 --> 01:16:36,828
- What happened?
- I was acting.

778
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:45,633
I came here thinking
I'd fiind a good job.

779
01:16:45,778 --> 01:16:50,147
I neverthought
someday I'd fiind you.

780
01:16:50,349 --> 01:16:55,286
Do you think I love you?

781
01:16:55,788 --> 01:16:59,087
- Yes.
- I was acting.

782
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:02,385
At the farm, I told you
I love you? This too is acting.

783
01:17:02,694 --> 01:17:04,685
What?

784
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:08,990
- You can't do this!
- I love you!

785
01:17:09,101 --> 01:17:11,399
The public here hits hard.

786
01:17:11,737 --> 01:17:17,437
Quickly go and talk to your
family about our marriage.

787
01:17:17,709 --> 01:17:21,145
- No way! - Why not? - Let my
elder brother get married fiirst.

788
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:24,213
The day that happens I'll
tell them, my bride is ready.

789
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:26,249
All right.

790
01:17:27,453 --> 01:17:30,854
That... that man!

791
01:17:31,123 --> 01:17:34,615
I'll beat you! Talk to me of
marriage and look at other men!

792
01:17:34,827 --> 01:17:38,024
It's not that. He's the
one who beat up Vicky sir.

793
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:41,764
Let's see where he goes.

794
01:17:48,173 --> 01:17:50,641
Every week you come to fiix your car.

795
01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:53,140
- Why don't you buy a new one?
- What can I say?

796
01:17:53,345 --> 01:17:56,940
Since I was fiired, I don't
have money forfuel.

797
01:17:57,049 --> 01:17:59,040
And you talk of buying a new car!

798
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:01,176
- Get the car checked.
- Check the problem in the car.

799
01:18:02,688 --> 01:18:05,987
There's dirt in the engine.

800
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:08,182
We'll have to open the nuts
and bolts and clean it up.

801
01:18:08,327 --> 01:18:12,787
The glass is shattered.

802
01:18:13,332 --> 01:18:17,735
And the body is dented.
How much can we repair?

803
01:18:18,003 --> 01:18:21,200
There are so many cars
but only 2 mechanics?

804
01:18:21,507 --> 01:18:25,307
He'll fiix half the cars.
I'll repain'the rest.

805
01:19:17,095 --> 01:19:19,086
You haven't slept?

806
01:19:19,231 --> 01:19:22,291
How can we sleep when
our young son is still awake?

807
01:19:22,534 --> 01:19:25,935
I've lived the life a man lives.

808
01:19:26,104 --> 01:19:30,131
- I hope before your marriage,
I don't... - What are you saying?

809
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:33,311
You'll live to see
my kids get married!

810
01:19:33,512 --> 01:19:36,811
- Wait a little.
- If so many years go by...

811
01:19:36,915 --> 01:19:38,849
...your grandma's
life will fall short!

812
01:19:39,017 --> 01:19:42,748
- We've chosen a bride for you.
- Bride? Who?

813
01:19:43,021 --> 01:19:46,752
- Not her!
- Why? What does she lack?

814
01:19:46,925 --> 01:19:49,257
She took such good care
of you in the farm house.

815
01:19:49,428 --> 01:19:52,022
She won our hearts.
I am convinced...

816
01:19:52,164 --> 01:19:54,826
She will be the best bride for you

817
01:19:54,967 --> 01:19:58,926
- I'll have to think. - Keep
thinking. - We've thought it out.

818
01:19:59,071 --> 01:20:01,130
Sapna will be your bride!

819
01:20:07,779 --> 01:20:10,441
One doesn't feel hungry
orthirsty when in love.

820
01:20:10,582 --> 01:20:13,949
- But would you like something to
pass time? - Get us whatever you like.

821
01:20:14,286 --> 01:20:16,254
What would you like, madam?

822
01:20:17,289 --> 01:20:20,156
And you, sir?

823
01:20:20,459 --> 01:20:22,484
- No point. - why?
- It will turn cold.

824
01:20:22,594 --> 01:20:24,562
- Then get it cold.
- Right sir.

825
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:29,664
Where's the loo?

826
01:20:30,402 --> 01:20:33,303
I'll go to the loo and come.

827
01:20:39,778 --> 01:20:43,077
- What are you doing here?
- Sir... I...

828
01:20:43,215 --> 01:20:45,979
You're so nervous as if
I caught you red handed.

829
01:20:46,118 --> 01:20:48,609
Sit down.

830
01:20:50,789 --> 01:20:53,519
Get me a coffee.

831
01:20:53,792 --> 01:20:56,727
- Take this one. - No, give it to
her. Get me another.

832
01:20:56,895 --> 01:21:00,262
- Take it.
- Please have it.

833
01:21:07,673 --> 01:21:09,732
- Brother!
- Shorty!

834
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:13,737
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

835
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:17,048
Isn't she your crazy one?

836
01:21:17,249 --> 01:21:22,050
In the coffee shop
during working hours...

837
01:21:22,387 --> 01:21:25,151
- what are you saying?
- Now I'm saying it.

838
01:21:25,357 --> 01:21:27,552
Then the world will talk.

839
01:21:27,693 --> 01:21:30,093
Grandma's wish will be fulfiilled.

840
01:21:30,295 --> 01:21:32,695
- Shut up! - Why?
- You are mistaken.

841
01:21:32,864 --> 01:21:36,493
Mistaken?

842
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:39,566
- Nothing of that sort.
- Sure? - Sure.

843
01:21:39,771 --> 01:21:42,797
- You're lying.
- Not at all.

844
01:21:43,075 --> 01:21:46,374
Get up!

845
01:21:46,778 --> 01:21:49,372
I will come with you.

846
01:21:49,581 --> 01:21:53,779
Stay with me!

847
01:21:54,086 --> 01:21:58,318
Who is that handsome young man?

848
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:00,549
My elder brother.

849
01:22:00,759 --> 01:22:03,125
- He means the world to me.
- And the lady?

850
01:22:03,361 --> 01:22:05,522
His sister-in-law.

851
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:08,359
I fiind her more of your
sister-in-law than his!

852
01:22:19,478 --> 01:22:23,574
It's often said the boss sees the
secretary daily and falls in love.

853
01:22:23,849 --> 01:22:28,650
No... I will tell brothertoday...

854
01:22:28,854 --> 01:22:31,982
Sapna is your sister-in-law.
Don't even look at her.

855
01:22:32,157 --> 01:22:35,058
She's the love of your
brother, his life.

856
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,194
His wife...

857
01:22:37,362 --> 01:22:41,264
I love her a lot. A lot.

858
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:44,698
- Brother!
- What's up, shorty?

859
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:47,168
- Car packed up?
- No, waiting for you.

860
01:22:47,305 --> 01:22:49,705
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Yes? - Like this?

861
01:22:49,808 --> 01:22:53,710
- Let's talk here.
- No, I'll drop you to the office.

862
01:22:54,279 --> 01:22:58,579
Forthe fiirst time my elder
brotherwill sit in my car!

863
01:23:03,822 --> 01:23:05,915
So tell me...

864
01:23:06,124 --> 01:23:09,423
- You'll go crazy when you hearthis
- Just a minute.

865
01:23:09,528 --> 01:23:13,362
- Yes, Suri? - The papers you...
- Yes keep the papers ready.

866
01:23:13,532 --> 01:23:17,024
- No more calls?
- No.

867
01:23:17,169 --> 01:23:21,868
We've grown up together.

868
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,031
Never kept anything from each other.

869
01:23:24,276 --> 01:23:26,938
I want to tell you about
one little thing I kept from you.

870
01:23:27,145 --> 01:23:30,478
- You're hiding something?
- That's what I'm saying...

871
01:23:30,749 --> 01:23:35,846
- Just a second...
- Yes Suri?

872
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,955
Shorty, just a minute.
Yes, Suri?

873
01:23:44,162 --> 01:23:47,563
What? You still haven't
made the contract!

874
01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:51,191
- You didn't get it done.
- You should have told me yesterday!

875
01:23:51,369 --> 01:23:53,360
Write fast...

876
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:59,109
Our company has been working
with you forthe past 8 years.

877
01:23:59,277 --> 01:24:02,440
What will be the mode of payment
before the contract is renewed?

878
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:05,113
What will the payment be
if the work days are more?

879
01:24:05,317 --> 01:24:07,512
What will the payment be
if the work days are less?

880
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:12,520
The contract is terminated
if the contract is not ready.

881
01:24:17,729 --> 01:24:20,061
Here's the office.

882
01:24:20,332 --> 01:24:23,824
We'll discuss the rest in
the meeting. I'm coming up.

883
01:24:24,536 --> 01:24:28,632
- Let me go!
- How can I let you go?

884
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,140
- We didn't talk.
- Shorty, you don't work.

885
01:24:33,278 --> 01:24:36,179
Let me work.
We'll talk at home tonight.

886
01:24:36,348 --> 01:24:39,146
I don't know why God is doing this!

887
01:24:39,351 --> 01:24:41,285
I will tell him at night!

888
01:24:47,859 --> 01:24:52,159
My mistake. I should watch my step.
- No sir, I'd ratherwatch mine

889
01:24:52,264 --> 01:24:54,459
It's an office. Not a jogging park.

890
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:57,863
In my case, the drawing room.

891
01:25:02,107 --> 01:25:05,440
- When I was new, I was scared of
you. - And now?

892
01:25:05,744 --> 01:25:09,703
- Not anymore. I admire you.
May I? - Go on.

893
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,762
- No! Not Sapna
- What's wrong with Sapna?

894
01:25:27,966 --> 01:25:31,732
Back at the farmhouse, she was
so caring. She bowled me over

895
01:25:31,937 --> 01:25:35,737
For my family, she's the best
I could everfiind.

896
01:26:09,908 --> 01:26:15,608
I am losing my sleep.
I am losing my peace

897
01:26:35,433 --> 01:26:40,234
I am falling in love

898
01:27:49,474 --> 01:27:54,969
The world seems like a new place
and everything seems pleasant.

899
01:27:55,246 --> 01:28:01,014
I am getting lost
in your eyes

900
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:10,586
I spent my days and nights
with great difficulty

901
01:28:10,728 --> 01:28:16,689
Today I realise what is love

902
01:28:17,836 --> 01:28:23,001
Even I am lost

903
01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:29,204
I don't gain my consciousness...
I wonderwhat intoxication this is

904
01:29:32,644 --> 01:29:37,741
The views are getting better...
The climate is changing

905
01:29:37,949 --> 01:29:43,819
We both have started falling and
rising in our intoxication

906
01:29:47,926 --> 01:29:53,228
Having come into the arms
of my beloved, I'm aroused

907
01:29:53,431 --> 01:29:59,370
We feel lost in
the shade of youth

908
01:30:00,038 --> 01:30:05,840
What kind of magic is this?

909
01:30:06,077 --> 01:30:11,879
What kind of a fiire
and pain is this?

910
01:30:44,882 --> 01:30:49,285
- You haven't left the office yet?
- The boss is still in. I'm late.

911
01:30:49,487 --> 01:30:55,084
Not late. Very late. And I've downed
countless coffees waiting for you.

912
01:30:56,294 --> 01:31:01,630
I'm coming right over.
- Take a taxi, and hurry up, please!

913
01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:08,737
Who was it?

914
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:13,140
My uncle. I'm late, you know.
That's why he called.

915
01:31:13,444 --> 01:31:16,675
- I'll drop you.
- No! You mustn't take the trouble.

916
01:31:16,881 --> 01:31:21,045
- I'll take a taxi.
- I wouldn't like that.

917
01:31:21,252 --> 01:31:23,482
Come, I'll give you a lift.

918
01:31:36,968 --> 01:31:40,199
Forgotten your bag?

919
01:31:40,571 --> 01:31:44,371
- Sorry sir, I'll be back in a
moment. - One moment.

920
01:31:58,489 --> 01:32:01,219
He must be waiting.
- Who?

921
01:32:03,261 --> 01:32:07,755
- They may be awaited at home.
- At most, I'll be half an hour late.

922
01:32:10,435 --> 01:32:12,767
- Stop! Please.
- What happened?

923
01:32:13,071 --> 01:32:18,441
I'll take a taxi. You won't get late.
- Why are you bothered about my time?

924
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:27,549
- He must be so bothered...
- Who?

925
01:32:28,786 --> 01:32:33,849
- Why botherfor me?
- Dropping you home is no botheration.

926
01:32:36,094 --> 01:32:38,358
All right.

927
01:32:44,001 --> 01:32:48,267
Tired of the waiting.

928
01:32:48,573 --> 01:32:53,909
And no news of the beloved.

929
01:32:54,412 --> 01:33:00,214
But I know, she isn't unfaithful

930
01:33:00,418 --> 01:33:04,411
Then why does she keep you waiting?

931
01:33:04,722 --> 01:33:09,352
- Moot point. - Show over.
The audience has departed.

932
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:13,621
- It's time to close forthe day.
- Till this flame burns, I won't go.

933
01:33:16,234 --> 01:33:19,135
- May I take your leave?
- All right.

934
01:33:53,171 --> 01:33:57,767
- A cup of tea for Vicky sahib,
please. - What?

935
01:33:58,976 --> 01:34:01,501
Where's Grandma?

936
01:34:01,712 --> 01:34:04,010
- Grandma... where is she?
...overthere.

937
01:34:04,148 --> 01:34:07,117
- What's wrong with Mr Vicky?
- God only knows!

938
01:34:14,859 --> 01:34:20,729
- Grandma, what do you seek from
God? - He gives me whatever I ask for.

939
01:34:20,832 --> 01:34:24,324
When will He give me this wish
for a bride... for you?

940
01:34:24,869 --> 01:34:30,637
If God can't refuse you,
how can I... a mere mortal?

941
01:34:30,842 --> 01:34:33,072
You mean?

942
01:34:33,277 --> 01:34:38,146
Nandu! Murari! Come here! Quick!
Call Balraj! Call Prem!

943
01:34:38,449 --> 01:34:41,577
My Vicky says yes, he'll marry!

944
01:34:49,794 --> 01:34:52,354
- Sir! Do you know?
- I know nothing! Get lost

945
01:34:55,366 --> 01:34:57,960
What's it, Grandma?
- I've been waiting for you!

946
01:34:58,169 --> 01:35:01,104
After you've heard what I have to
tell you, you'll go mad with joy!

947
01:35:01,239 --> 01:35:05,642
- What could it be, Dad?
- You can't even imagine!

948
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:09,038
Your brother has said yes
to getting married

949
01:35:09,313 --> 01:35:12,840
What's so great... What?!
Said yes? To getting married?

950
01:35:18,122 --> 01:35:21,649
Brother, oh brother!
Who's the girl?

951
01:35:21,859 --> 01:35:24,157
- You'll get to see, you'll get to
know. - Right away.

952
01:35:24,529 --> 01:35:28,226
- Tomorrow. - Now!
- Tomorrow! - Now!

953
01:35:28,633 --> 01:35:30,066
Tomorrow.

954
01:35:30,234 --> 01:35:33,362
- Now?
- Tomorrow?

955
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:39,770
- Not tomorrow, tell me today!
- If you've waited so many years...

956
01:35:40,044 --> 01:35:43,138
- what's another night?
- Tell me her name

957
01:35:43,347 --> 01:35:48,478
- Her name is... your sister-in-law.
- Name? That's the relationship.

958
01:35:48,953 --> 01:35:51,444
Come off it!

959
01:36:06,737 --> 01:36:09,501
What's the name again?

960
01:36:09,807 --> 01:36:14,437
- Tell me.
- Tomorrow. Now go to sleep.

961
01:36:20,818 --> 01:36:22,752
All night, all through the drive,
you've kept me on tenterhooks

962
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:27,016
- Now tell me! - Let me show you.
- Show it to me! - Look...

963
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:32,920
- No one at all?
- Look. Properly.

964
01:36:44,342 --> 01:36:47,368
- But this is Sapna.
- She's the one.

965
01:36:50,381 --> 01:36:54,875
- Am I the fall guy this morning?
- No jokes. She's the one.

966
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:12,002
Aren't you happy?

967
01:37:12,203 --> 01:37:17,436
Come on, what's wrong with her?
- What's good about her?

968
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:23,203
What happened to your choice?
Look at her, she looks like yogurt.

969
01:37:23,447 --> 01:37:29,010
She's shorterthan I am! Mismatch!
And what'd people say?

970
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:35,116
Balram Chopra's son marries his
secretary! No, she's a reject.

971
01:37:35,259 --> 01:37:37,921
- Find someone else, okay?
- No Prem.

972
01:37:38,129 --> 01:37:42,828
Whatever people might say
she means the world to me.

973
01:37:45,436 --> 01:37:47,370
She's the girl who has lit
the light of love in my heart.

974
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:51,530
She is the only one I will marry.
I'll marry no one else.

975
01:38:03,988 --> 01:38:09,392
- Actually, brilliant choice!
- But you just said she's no good.

976
01:38:09,593 --> 01:38:11,527
- Just joking.
- Really?

977
01:38:18,102 --> 01:38:22,903
Now get married quickly and
make babies... while I take a break.

978
01:38:23,107 --> 01:38:26,440
- Where are you off to?
- Now that you've found yours...

979
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:28,805
You've found yours, haven't you?
Time I found myself one.

980
01:38:57,942 --> 01:39:01,173
- How are you doing?
- Good you're here.

981
01:39:01,579 --> 01:39:05,276
I've got to take this weight off
my chest. I think I should...

982
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:08,874
- make a clean breast of it.
- Why haven't you said it already?

983
01:39:09,086 --> 01:39:12,681
How could I? He was so happy.
He would've been hurt.

984
01:39:12,823 --> 01:39:14,916
- So he won't get hurt now?
- What do you want me to do?

985
01:39:15,126 --> 01:39:18,687
I was about to marry her. Now you
want me to call her my sister-in-law?

986
01:39:18,896 --> 01:39:23,094
- You must. - Why must I?
I'll tell him the truth

987
01:39:23,334 --> 01:39:26,497
- Why must you tell him the truth?
- Because I've never lied to him.

988
01:39:26,704 --> 01:39:31,505
This could make him or break him.
You have to tell the lie

989
01:39:34,445 --> 01:39:39,906
All right, I lie. But when he realises
that she's his brother's girlfriend...

990
01:39:40,117 --> 01:39:45,214
- what's he going to go through?
- Who'd tell him? Not you. Not Sapna.

991
01:39:48,459 --> 01:39:52,953
Then I'll have to leave this city.
- Go where you want to

992
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:56,927
- I'm sticking with my brother.
- How can I leave without you?

993
01:39:57,067 --> 01:40:01,128
- Why are you crying?
- Just forfiive minutes.

994
01:40:01,438 --> 01:40:04,236
- Let me cry my heart out. - So you
aren't happy for your brother?

995
01:40:04,742 --> 01:40:10,544
- These are tears of joy! - Then
keep smiling through the tears. - How?

996
01:40:11,749 --> 01:40:13,740
Like that.

997
01:40:16,754 --> 01:40:19,279
The signal has turned green. Move it.
People will think you're insane

998
01:40:19,456 --> 01:40:21,856
Yes, yes, I'm moving

999
01:40:22,092 --> 01:40:25,960
- And don't you come to me again!
- Don't you call me ever again.

1000
01:40:26,163 --> 01:40:30,259
I won't! My brother's happy,
my sister-in-law is happy, I'm happy!

1001
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:32,967
That's just what I want.
Now get lost.

1002
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:37,368
Yes all right, I'm moving

1003
01:40:38,809 --> 01:40:41,107
Not one of them cares!

1004
01:41:45,376 --> 01:41:48,573
I'm in Panvel. On my way to Poona.
The signal is very weak here

1005
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:52,306
I'll be back in two days.
I'll call you after I get back

1006
01:41:52,483 --> 01:41:57,318
Here's Prem. Put on the costume.
Let's do the rehearsal. Move it man.

1007
01:41:57,488 --> 01:42:00,150
- What's wrong with him?
- What's the matter, Prem?

1008
01:42:04,962 --> 01:42:09,922
- Vicky is in love.
- Vicky in love. At last!

1009
01:42:10,134 --> 01:42:13,626
Next, he gets married, and then
it's little brother's turn.

1010
01:42:13,837 --> 01:42:15,930
He's going to carry my niece away!

1011
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:21,642
The girl Vicky is in love with
...is your niece. Sapna

1012
01:42:22,146 --> 01:42:26,173
What a joke! Now stop joking
and get into the costume.

1013
01:42:26,784 --> 01:42:31,153
- Don't you ever crack such dirty
jokes. - I'm not joking!

1014
01:42:31,555 --> 01:42:35,491
Is this something to joke about?
Vicky is in love with Sapna

1015
01:42:35,759 --> 01:42:39,160
- He wants to marry her.
- Tell Vicky you're in love...

1016
01:42:39,296 --> 01:42:42,265
- and you want to marry Sapna
- I can't tell him that!

1017
01:42:42,466 --> 01:42:44,559
- I can tell him that, can't I?
- You won't!

1018
01:42:45,002 --> 01:42:49,462
As her uncle, I will decide whom
she marries, and whom she doesn't.

1019
01:42:52,409 --> 01:42:56,573
And I know how much you and Sapna
love each other

1020
01:42:56,780 --> 01:43:01,649
You also know how much I love Vicky.
I'd do anything for him. You know?

1021
01:43:06,023 --> 01:43:11,518
I've done my bit of acting for you.
Now I'm going to do it for Vicky.

1022
01:43:11,729 --> 01:43:15,460
I'm going to need your help
...I need everyone's help.

1023
01:43:27,144 --> 01:43:32,844
- No more directing plays with Prem.
- What's the matter, Uncle?

1024
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:36,645
- What does Prem think of himself?
- Why, what happened?

1025
01:43:36,787 --> 01:43:39,950
That girl in our group, Sonia
...you've met her, haven't you?

1026
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:42,558
Prem insists on having her
as his heroine in every play

1027
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:48,198
Even if she doesn't fiit the role.
Guess why? So that he can go flirting.

1028
01:43:48,465 --> 01:43:51,662
I just walked out of the rehearsal.
- How come? Prem is in Poona

1029
01:43:51,869 --> 01:43:55,305
- Where is he?
- In Poona. He told me so himself.

1030
01:43:56,874 --> 01:44:02,710
That's the official version for home.
He's rehearsing. With that girl!

1031
01:44:03,213 --> 01:44:06,410
Come on, take me there

1032
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:15,718
You?

1033
01:45:20,457 --> 01:45:22,755
Why are you laughing?

1034
01:45:22,926 --> 01:45:26,760
I never guessed I'd get caught
so soon!

1035
01:45:28,232 --> 01:45:34,034
So this is your urgent business
in Poona! I trusted you. And this?

1036
01:45:34,271 --> 01:45:39,538
If you trusted me, it's your mistake.
Trust me, you're bound to be deceived

1037
01:45:39,843 --> 01:45:45,748
I love you! How'd I live without you?
You never even gave it a thought?

1038
01:45:45,883 --> 01:45:49,751
You'll live. Same as before. I didn't
bring you up these 20 years, did I?

1039
01:45:49,887 --> 01:45:55,450
Don't give me those lines. I was born
an actor. I'm in the profession too

1040
01:45:55,659 --> 01:46:00,426
If you can take that,
just fall into step. Like her.

1041
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:13,000
Who says there are only three actors
in the world?

1042
01:46:13,243 --> 01:46:16,144
No not Amitabh Bacchan.
Nor Dilip Kumar. Only Prem.

1043
01:46:16,513 --> 01:46:18,538
They do their acts on screen

1044
01:46:18,815 --> 01:46:21,943
Who does it in real life?

1045
01:46:31,061 --> 01:46:36,658
Let's do it tomorrow! My baby is
so lucky! What a grand house!

1046
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:40,030
And such a good boy! One has
to be lucky, yes Grandma?

1047
01:46:40,137 --> 01:46:44,938
Still, ask Sapna once.
- Why Sapna? I'm saying yes!

1048
01:46:45,075 --> 01:46:49,136
- Here, eat a sweet
- No thank you. You go ahead

1049
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:54,847
Well all right. She's my niece, but
I love her more than my daughter

1050
01:46:55,085 --> 01:46:59,351
- What if she doesn't like Vicky?
- Didn't you see her at the farm?

1051
01:46:59,489 --> 01:47:01,684
- She was doting on Vicky.
- Yes.

1052
01:47:01,825 --> 01:47:04,919
In her eyes, I've seen love.
For Vicky

1053
01:47:06,897 --> 01:47:10,492
Next Sunday is Vicky's birthday.
We aren't throwing a big party.

1054
01:47:10,701 --> 01:47:15,035
But this time I want to give him
the thing he'll value most in life.

1055
01:47:15,205 --> 01:47:18,697
- Make sure you're here. With Sapna.
- You want to bring her right now?

1056
01:47:18,842 --> 01:47:21,606
No! Eat a sweet.
- One for you too?

1057
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:30,250
You could've asked me before
getting involved with Prem.

1058
01:47:30,454 --> 01:47:34,754
- I would've told you what he's
like. - Get lost.

1059
01:47:35,259 --> 01:47:38,717
I say, whatever happens,
happens forthe better

1060
01:47:38,929 --> 01:47:41,921
At least she got to know before
things got worse.

1061
01:47:43,133 --> 01:47:48,730
God forbid it, we'd have lost face.
- In that family...

1062
01:47:48,939 --> 01:47:52,534
Vicky is a more deserving boy.

1063
01:47:52,843 --> 01:47:56,335
Siblings, yet poles apart.

1064
01:47:56,647 --> 01:48:02,176
One is honest and hardworking.
And the other... what a hypocrite!

1065
01:48:02,519 --> 01:48:07,320
And it's God's wish that
they want you for Vicky.

1066
01:48:07,491 --> 01:48:11,621
This isn't happening! I love Prem.

1067
01:48:11,895 --> 01:48:15,422
Make sure no one gets wind of it.

1068
01:48:15,599 --> 01:48:19,626
Gone are the times when women
would weep fortheir errant men.

1069
01:48:19,836 --> 01:48:24,102
Look at Prem. What difference is it
for him? He's still enjoying himself.

1070
01:48:24,408 --> 01:48:27,434
And why are you crying?
Come on, enjoy yourself

1071
01:48:27,611 --> 01:48:31,308
We're going there tomorrow.
For a formal meeting.

1072
01:48:31,515 --> 01:48:36,145
Wearthe black dress.
You look gorgeous in it.

1073
01:48:41,525 --> 01:48:44,050
- No...!
- This is for good luck.

1074
01:48:44,227 --> 01:48:49,722
My doll! How pretty you look!
The Lord has answered my prayers

1075
01:48:49,933 --> 01:48:54,836
Now get married quickly
and come into my house.

1076
01:48:54,971 --> 01:48:58,372
And fiill my Vicky's life
with happiness.

1077
01:49:01,378 --> 01:49:04,370
Now stop directing plays and get
into fiilms.

1078
01:49:04,715 --> 01:49:07,411
Mr Oberoi will fiinance you.
We're related now.

1079
01:49:07,584 --> 01:49:10,781
Why not? Balraj Oberoi Presents

1080
01:49:11,021 --> 01:49:14,479
Prem in every frame!
- Super hit!

1081
01:49:19,396 --> 01:49:23,423
I'm so happy! Nandu! Murari!
Get the sweets! Sapna has said yes!

1082
01:49:23,734 --> 01:49:26,601
Obviously! How could she refuse?

1083
01:49:27,738 --> 01:49:30,605
What could be bad
about my brother?

1084
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:35,039
Besides, it's magnanimous of my
brotherto marry his secretary.

1085
01:49:35,245 --> 01:49:37,304
- What is he saying?
- She's your sister-in-law.

1086
01:49:37,514 --> 01:49:41,951
- Now Grandma, what about me?
- Later.

1087
01:49:42,119 --> 01:49:44,553
- When?
- Soon enough. Just wait and watch.

1088
01:49:44,721 --> 01:49:47,747
Yes, here are the sweets.
Come, give sweets to everyone.

1089
01:49:48,358 --> 01:49:52,727
Sapna, fiirst of all,
your brother-in-law.

1090
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:59,529
That's the brother-in-law

1091
01:50:07,444 --> 01:50:12,848
And remember, for me, my brother
always comes fiirst. All else can wait.

1092
01:50:12,949 --> 01:50:15,247
May I reciprocate?

1093
01:50:17,687 --> 01:50:19,746
Prem isn't with you either?

1094
01:50:21,258 --> 01:50:24,352
- Where might he be?
- He'll come.

1095
01:50:24,561 --> 01:50:27,052
- He should've been home by now.
- He will.

1096
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,768
- Where might he be?
- How would I know?

1097
01:50:32,969 --> 01:50:38,669
- Come on Rina, what's your problem?
- I can't live in a joint family.

1098
01:50:38,809 --> 01:50:42,074
I won't marry you before you start
living away from your brother.

1099
01:50:42,312 --> 01:50:47,477
- Afterthe wedding, I'll move out.
- Not after. Before the wedding.

1100
01:50:55,125 --> 01:50:58,322
Try to understand. He manages the
businesses. Afterwe're married...

1101
01:50:58,495 --> 01:51:01,328
- I collect my share, and move out.
- Are you saying the truth?

1102
01:51:01,531 --> 01:51:03,726
Trust me!

1103
01:51:08,538 --> 01:51:12,065
What are you saying man? You want
to walk out on your brother?

1104
01:51:13,243 --> 01:51:18,647
Two minutes. Let me talk. And you're
pitting brother against brother?

1105
01:51:18,849 --> 01:51:23,047
Not a hundred like her
are worth a brother

1106
01:51:23,253 --> 01:51:25,653
This is a private matter.
Please stay out of this.

1107
01:51:25,789 --> 01:51:28,849
- Go on, man.
- Let me talk.

1108
01:51:28,959 --> 01:51:32,156
Rina, trust me.
I'm not going to deceive you.

1109
01:51:32,295 --> 01:51:36,891
This is no private matter.
This is about brothers

1110
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:40,263
And between brothers,
you shall do no wrong.

1111
01:51:40,604 --> 01:51:42,572
I've a big brothertoo.

1112
01:51:42,806 --> 01:51:45,468
I'm just trying to settle
the squabble.

1113
01:51:48,778 --> 01:51:51,372
What kind of a melodrama is this?

1114
01:51:51,781 --> 01:51:54,272
What big brother are you
talking about? Get up

1115
01:51:54,484 --> 01:51:56,418
Throw him out.

1116
01:52:01,925 --> 01:52:07,522
Have you had enough now?
Pick him up and throw him out

1117
01:52:07,864 --> 01:52:10,628
My brother! Where's my brother?

1118
01:52:22,245 --> 01:52:28,081
- You're drunk?
- Past tense. The trip is over.

1119
01:52:28,285 --> 01:52:31,743
They bashed me out of it.
Look at this... and this, and this!

1120
01:52:31,888 --> 01:52:34,880
Sit here. Just sit here

1121
01:52:35,091 --> 01:52:37,855
I'll be back.

1122
01:52:46,403 --> 01:52:50,271
Now watch my brother bowl you over.

1123
01:52:50,473 --> 01:52:55,103
- Who hit my brother?
- I did. Who are you?

1124
01:52:59,115 --> 01:53:01,015
What's the matter, boss?
Have we done something wrong?

1125
01:53:01,217 --> 01:53:03,151
Why did you hit my brother?

1126
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:05,411
- It was a mistake. Please
forgive us. - Mistake?

1127
01:53:39,189 --> 01:53:42,158
- You're drunk!
- Let's talk when we're home.

1128
01:53:42,258 --> 01:53:45,091
Home? In this condition?
What will Grandma and Daddy say?

1129
01:53:45,261 --> 01:53:48,753
Then I won't go home.
I'll sleep right here.

1130
01:53:48,965 --> 01:53:53,868
- Stop this sham & just come home.
- I told you I'm not coming home

1131
01:53:53,970 --> 01:53:56,666
I'll sleep on the street.
I'll sleep on the platform.

1132
01:53:56,873 --> 01:54:00,741
I won't go home.

1133
01:54:09,019 --> 01:54:11,010
Come home.

1134
01:54:13,723 --> 01:54:19,320
Now listen to me...
Stop being stubborn

1135
01:54:23,433 --> 01:54:25,924
But fiirst say something

1136
01:54:26,069 --> 01:54:31,371
Come along, brother!

1137
01:54:38,648 --> 01:54:41,947
I can't get up.
And he's asking me to walk

1138
01:54:42,052 --> 01:54:44,043
First carry me atleast

1139
01:54:44,254 --> 01:54:49,556
I told you so many times
not to drink

1140
01:54:54,064 --> 01:54:56,555
Your liverwill get ruined

1141
01:54:56,766 --> 01:55:00,202
You're high

1142
01:55:00,537 --> 01:55:03,995
You don't understand it...
- He said this the fiirst time

1143
01:55:18,621 --> 01:55:21,818
I'm walking. I'm drunk and you're
the one feeling high

1144
01:55:21,958 --> 01:55:25,325
You used to say that
I'm yourfriend

1145
01:55:25,462 --> 01:55:28,829
And that you loved only me

1146
01:55:28,965 --> 01:55:31,525
And it never can happen

1147
01:55:41,544 --> 01:55:43,876
You are younger and
I am elderto you

1148
01:55:44,047 --> 01:55:47,244
Add to my respect...
don't lower it

1149
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:51,750
This will never happen again

1150
01:55:53,456 --> 01:55:55,481
Listen my dear shorty

1151
01:55:55,658 --> 01:55:59,355
Listen my dear son

1152
01:56:02,699 --> 01:56:05,793
See how they are
laughing at you

1153
01:56:12,008 --> 01:56:16,707
I told you so many times.
It was not just in vain

1154
01:56:21,017 --> 01:56:23,815
There is something in my mind

1155
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:29,754
Shorty's drama will stop; atleast
let my engagement happen

1156
01:56:38,234 --> 01:56:41,169
You've said that sentence
5 times

1157
01:56:41,471 --> 01:56:45,134
I think you're drunk and
your liverwill get spoilt

1158
01:56:45,241 --> 01:56:49,371
Is Sapna really coming here
or am I dreaming?

1159
01:56:49,646 --> 01:56:53,138
Yes. It is Sapna

1160
01:56:53,583 --> 01:56:56,279
She's looking very nice

1161
01:56:56,586 --> 01:56:59,248
You'll make a great couple

1162
01:56:59,489 --> 01:57:01,980
See, my brother
has royal ways

1163
01:57:02,125 --> 01:57:05,288
You are going to be
his sister-in-law

1164
01:57:06,596 --> 01:57:10,930
How are you sister-in-law?

1165
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:23,201
You may not look after me
but don't make him unhappy

1166
01:57:23,613 --> 01:57:28,312
You are my Sapna.
He's my closest person

1167
01:57:29,252 --> 01:57:33,154
If she doesn't look after you,
she is wrong

1168
01:57:33,456 --> 01:57:35,924
I'll get you the right
sister-in-law then'

1169
01:57:39,028 --> 01:57:42,259
My life is one with his

1170
01:58:15,398 --> 01:58:17,889
In India...

1171
01:58:24,741 --> 01:58:28,302
- And the third is?
- It is you, my brother

1172
01:58:39,956 --> 01:58:42,720
Just let me get
rid of some booze.

1173
01:58:42,926 --> 01:58:47,829
Don't you go away. If you go away,
who's going to take me home?

1174
01:58:48,965 --> 01:58:52,423
Are you all right?

1175
01:58:52,568 --> 01:58:54,536
Are you okay?

1176
01:58:59,442 --> 01:59:01,376
Come home.

1177
01:59:26,903 --> 01:59:29,531
- Bring the tea!
- Tea, sir

1178
01:59:29,706 --> 01:59:33,836
Do you have soda and lime?
I'm feeling like puking

1179
01:59:37,747 --> 01:59:42,514
You know, after you were born,
I neverwanted any toys.

1180
01:59:44,754 --> 01:59:49,418
Because you were everything for me
...my brother, my friend, my toy.

1181
01:59:49,659 --> 01:59:51,718
I have always loved you.

1182
01:59:57,533 --> 02:00:00,127
You got drunk last night.

1183
02:00:01,437 --> 02:00:06,966
- I got into the mood yesterday.
- Never happened before, did it?

1184
02:00:07,243 --> 02:00:12,237
What if I were to play a drunk?
So I just got drunk

1185
02:00:12,448 --> 02:00:16,384
Last night, I had the feeling that
you were trying to tell me something

1186
02:00:16,552 --> 02:00:18,952
- Trying to tell you something?
- Tell me

1187
02:00:20,857 --> 02:00:23,052
When you're sober, you cannot
talk in drunken abandon.

1188
02:00:23,192 --> 02:00:27,151
Let me have a few drinks fiirst.
Then I might tell you.

1189
02:00:27,563 --> 02:00:30,054
- Are you pulling my leg?
- Oh no!

1190
02:00:30,266 --> 02:00:34,293
- So tell me.
- You really want me to say it?

1191
02:00:39,575 --> 02:00:41,702
Sapna is here

1192
02:00:41,978 --> 02:00:46,813
Sapna, talk some sense into him.
Last night, he got drunk

1193
02:00:47,083 --> 02:00:52,612
- Nothing new for him, is it?
- It was his fiirst time

1194
02:00:53,122 --> 02:00:58,890
Could it have been an act? You never
know when he's putting up an act.

1195
02:00:59,095 --> 02:01:03,862
I told you to drill some sense into
him. Not to scold him. Don't do that.

1196
02:01:04,033 --> 02:01:06,524
Still sir?

1197
02:01:06,736 --> 02:01:11,230
- Come on, we're going shopping.
- What am I going to do with you?

1198
02:01:11,441 --> 02:01:13,375
Just come along, I said.
- Just give me two minutes

1199
02:01:13,643 --> 02:01:18,444
What for?
Get lost and have bath.

1200
02:01:24,454 --> 02:01:26,581
This would look nice on you.

1201
02:01:29,092 --> 02:01:32,255
- What happened?
- He'll look like a bandmaster

1202
02:01:32,595 --> 02:01:34,961
Pick a suit that suits
his personality.

1203
02:01:35,164 --> 02:01:39,260
- How do I smell now?
- Better.

1204
02:01:40,603 --> 02:01:45,597
How would this be?
- Try it out on Prem

1205
02:01:45,775 --> 02:01:50,212
- But you're the one to wear it.
- If it suits him, it'll suit me.

1206
02:01:50,580 --> 02:01:55,210
- You can take a look in the mirror.
- Sapna, he's my mirror.

1207
02:01:55,585 --> 02:01:59,282
Just put it on, will you?

1208
02:01:59,889 --> 02:02:02,915
All right, I'll try it out.

1209
02:02:16,038 --> 02:02:20,168
You're unhappy, aren't you... about
the prospect of a secretary...

1210
02:02:20,443 --> 02:02:26,245
- becoming the lady of the house.
- My brother has made a bad choice

1211
02:02:26,582 --> 02:02:31,952
So what do you propose to do?
I'm about to enter your house.

1212
02:02:32,455 --> 02:02:38,451
- I'll tolerate you as always.
- There's still time. Change yourself.

1213
02:02:38,961 --> 02:02:42,362
- Time's up.
- You're destroying yourself.

1214
02:02:42,565 --> 02:02:46,399
Look at your brother.
How different the two of you are.

1215
02:02:47,069 --> 02:02:52,769
Lots of differences between us,
but my brother loves me dearly.

1216
02:02:53,009 --> 02:02:58,106
He won't like to hear you speak
ill of me. You understand?

1217
02:02:59,115 --> 02:03:04,712
I know. To tolerate you for
the sake of his happiness...

1218
02:03:05,121 --> 02:03:11,026
- well, I'm willing.
- Willing to do for Prem... what?

1219
02:03:11,227 --> 02:03:15,664
- At the engagement, she'll sing!
- Duet. With him

1220
02:03:15,831 --> 02:03:21,360
- What say? - I'll leave nothing to
say. I'll sing, I'll dance, and...

1221
02:03:21,737 --> 02:03:25,764
Let's leave now

1222
02:03:35,084 --> 02:03:39,453
The henna brings colour
on yourwedding day

1223
02:03:57,873 --> 02:04:03,311
You see many colourful dreams

1224
02:04:08,718 --> 02:04:13,417
I pray ardently that this
colour never be lessened

1225
02:04:57,166 --> 02:05:02,399
The red muslin cloth of yours...

1226
02:05:06,208 --> 02:05:10,440
should not slip out
of your body

1227
02:05:19,455 --> 02:05:23,915
The desires of
your crazy heart...

1228
02:05:28,931 --> 02:05:32,230
may never leave your mind

1229
02:05:40,576 --> 02:05:45,536
He was a crazy guy in
everyone's view

1230
02:05:45,781 --> 02:05:51,083
He was such a
happy-go-lucky bachelor

1231
02:05:51,253 --> 02:05:56,281
You have shut a free bird...

1232
02:06:01,397 --> 02:06:07,097
in the cage of your heart

1233
02:06:18,514 --> 02:06:23,611
Come to your senses.
Just listen to me

1234
02:06:23,753 --> 02:06:28,816
Just look into my eyes and
recognise my love

1235
02:06:29,024 --> 02:06:34,155
Oh crazy guy!
How do I explain to you?

1236
02:06:40,136 --> 02:06:44,835
Why I chose him

1237
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:06,789
My brother is a simple man and
this girl is very naughty'

1238
02:07:06,996 --> 02:07:12,298
She is good looking but
crazy in her brains

1239
02:07:13,536 --> 02:07:17,404
I wonder if they'll get along

1240
02:07:23,746 --> 02:07:28,513
It is a pair of
a stick and ball

1241
02:07:55,945 --> 02:07:58,436
Hey fellers,
just listen to me

1242
02:07:58,781 --> 02:08:00,806
See the way he walks

1243
02:08:01,383 --> 02:08:06,582
He looks like his
brother's tail

1244
02:08:06,722 --> 02:08:11,785
Hey guy!
Just look into the mirror!

1245
02:08:17,433 --> 02:08:20,834
You have something in your heart

1246
02:08:44,727 --> 02:08:49,824
Stop fiighting. It is a moment
of joy. Be happy

1247
02:08:49,965 --> 02:08:54,959
Make a promise before me
that you won't fiight again

1248
02:08:55,237 --> 02:09:00,174
Oh dear! He's very innocent

1249
02:09:06,382 --> 02:09:10,978
Don't feel bad about
what he says

1250
02:09:58,334 --> 02:10:00,359
The ring!

1251
02:10:02,972 --> 02:10:06,931
- You still won't say it? - What's
it? What are you asking him?

1252
02:10:07,076 --> 02:10:11,069
- What's the matter, son?
- Ask him. He's going to say.

1253
02:10:11,246 --> 02:10:14,579
- You won't say it, will you?
- What?

1254
02:10:14,750 --> 02:10:16,684
Then I'll say it.

1255
02:10:19,154 --> 02:10:21,782
Prem and Sapna are in love

1256
02:10:27,763 --> 02:10:32,598
You think I don't know?
That night when you were drunk...

1257
02:10:34,470 --> 02:10:38,668
Sapna, marry my brother

1258
02:10:41,910 --> 02:10:44,777
I love my brother very much.

1259
02:10:49,685 --> 02:10:55,317
So you were making a sacrifiice?
No, you were about to ruin 3 lives.

1260
02:10:56,625 --> 02:11:02,222
You think you're great? You're my
little brother. You'll always be.

1261
02:11:05,034 --> 02:11:09,368
And you... you were marrying me
just to get even with him?

1262
02:11:09,672 --> 02:11:12,732
- No... - What made you think
his character is bad?

1263
02:11:12,941 --> 02:11:16,433
If you were in love with him,
you could've come to me, asked me.

1264
02:11:17,946 --> 02:11:23,248
And I'd tell you, my brother's
character is immaculate.

1265
02:11:27,956 --> 02:11:31,357
What use is it saying sorry?

1266
02:11:34,163 --> 02:11:36,495
You think you're some great actor?

1267
02:11:37,099 --> 02:11:42,867
Three actors in all of India, yes?
Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bacchan...

1268
02:11:42,971 --> 02:11:44,871
- and who's the third?
- You!

1269
02:11:45,074 --> 02:11:47,065
You... you are the one!

1270
02:11:53,282 --> 02:11:56,774
Now before he changes his mind...
take this... and put it on!

1271
02:11:57,019 --> 02:12:00,011
One minute, what was it
you were saying about her?

1272
02:12:00,222 --> 02:12:03,123
What?
- She looks like yogurt...

1273
02:12:03,225 --> 02:12:05,250
she's squat and that beaked nose
is just like her uncle's.

1274
02:12:05,427 --> 02:12:08,521
You said that about me?
I'm going to marry him!

1275
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:11,030
You're marrying the man in black.

1276
02:12:11,233 --> 02:12:14,430
Have you ever seen two brothers
who love each other so much?

1277
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:16,629
God protect them from the evil eye

1278
02:12:20,843 --> 02:12:23,073
How about honeymooning
before the wedding?

1279
02:12:23,245 --> 02:12:25,236
I'm the bride's dowry.

1280
02:12:34,957 --> 02:12:37,858
Can't you see where you're going?
All my papers are on the floor

1281
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:42,260
This is an office.
Not a jogging park.

1282
02:12:42,564 --> 02:12:44,088
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

1283
02:12:44,199 --> 02:12:47,760
This isn't your drawing room either.
You don't amble about.

1284
02:12:47,903 --> 02:12:51,464
I'm nervous as it is. I wonder if
I'm going to make it at the interview.

1285
02:12:52,407 --> 02:12:56,503
- So you're here forthe interview?
- No, I'm just taking a walk.

1286
02:12:56,779 --> 02:12:58,770
Obviously, I'm here
forthe interview.
