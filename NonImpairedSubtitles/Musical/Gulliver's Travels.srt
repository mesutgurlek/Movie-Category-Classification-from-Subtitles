5
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:45,634
I, Lemuel Gulliver

6
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:49,169
give thee a faithful history

7
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,834
of my most interesting adventure

8
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,257
in the south sea.

9
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,136
On the 5th day of November, 1699,

10
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:57,894
having reached latitude 30 degrees,

11
00:01:58,139 --> 00:01:59,925
two minutes south,

12
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:04,992
a storm of great fury suddenly...

13
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:43,568
All's well!

14
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:50,416
All's well!

15
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:59,303
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #

16
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:00,685
# Never mind that cloud. #

17
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:04,165
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #

18
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,775
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #

19
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:11,627
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #

20
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:13,997
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #

21
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:19,448
# Everyone, come on have fun. All's well! #

22
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:23,032
Why do they make me sing that song?

23
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:25,553
The poet who wrote it was certainly wrong.

24
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:28,299
It's bright ahead. The light's ahead.

25
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,707
I'd rather go home and go right to bed.

26
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:39,818
All's well!

27
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,107
My feet are wet and my bunions ache,

28
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,851
and yet I've to keep wide awake,

29
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:51,351
all night!

30
00:04:56,357 --> 00:05:01,126
I wake folks up to tell them
things are all right!

31
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:05,868
And, # All's well! What's a rainy day? #

32
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,393
# Never mind that cloud. #

33
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:10,861
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #

34
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:15,390
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #

35
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:18,081
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #

36
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:20,516
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #

37
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:24,325
# Everyone, come on have fun. All...

38
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:53,603
A, A, All's well! Wha, wha, what's a rainy day?

39
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,295
The king has visitors.

40
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,751
Do you know they're signing a wedding contract?

41
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,963
There's a giant on the beach!

42
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:14,629
<i>There, there's a giant out there!</i>

43
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:31,123
Your majesty.

44
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:34,413
Thank you, your majesty.

45
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,818
Marriage Contract

46
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:41,388
King Little of Lilliput

47
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:45,009
Does this 5th day of November 1699
give the hand of his daughter

48
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:48,501
Princess Glory

49
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:50,198
to Prince David

50
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:51,956
son of Bombo

51
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,727
King of Blefuscu!

52
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:57,194
Quite in order, fine.

53
00:07:57,382 --> 00:08:01,379
King Bombo!

54
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:32,551
Well we did it, you little rascal, you.
We did it.

55
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:34,866
Yes we, we certainly did, didn't we?

56
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:40,832
Just a couple of old dag cupids, I think! [laughs}

57
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:48,748
Your majesty, the wedding things are here.

58
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:52,173
There's a giant on the beach!
Let me go!

59
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:12,191
Let me go! Let me go!
There's a giant on the beach! Let me go!

60
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:25,789
Exquisite taste, exquisite!

61
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:35,345
Roses, Freesia, Rhododendrons,
Ranunculus, Snap Dragons, and Daisies.

62
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,264
Ahh!

63
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,920
They're pretty Posies, aren't they?

64
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:50,037
Beautiful blooms, beautiful!

65
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,439
Oh!

66
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:05,524
May I?

67
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:10,814
Oh, please do!

68
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:21,511
Magnificent!

69
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:40,914
Oh! A masterpiece!

70
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:55,096
Vanilla. Wow!

71
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:14,040
# Faithful. Remember, that whatever I do,
I'm always faithful, my love. #

72
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:24,901
# Faithful, with all my soul and thankful for you, #

73
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:33,877
# who came from heaven above. #

74
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:45,951
# We'll dance tonight together,
on a world with me we'll find. #

75
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:48,966
My only little daughter. I dread losing her.

76
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:54,862
Huh, Buck up there old boy, you're not
losing a daughter. You’re gaining a son.

77
00:11:56,573 --> 00:12:00,130
My son!

78
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:21,634
# So I'll be faithful and faithful as I promise to be,
and you'll be for all mine. #

79
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:26,818
Hmm. Lovely melody.

80
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,957
Yes, we like it.

81
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:32,289
That is Faithful. The song of Lilliput.

82
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,416
It will be played at the wedding tomorrow.

83
00:12:35,514 --> 00:12:36,758
Of course. Of course.

84
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:42,694
What's that, Faithful? Oh, no, no! Forever!

85
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,787
The song of Blefuscu must be
played at the wedding.

86
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:50,335
But Bombo, Faithful is always
played at our weddings.

87
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:55,244
It, it's tradition, sir. And it's very pretty.

88
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,001
Yes, yes, I know. Pleasant little ditty,

89
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,413
oh but hardly appropriate for this great occasion.

90
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:07,197
But Forever! There's a song for you! Ha, ha!

91
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:09,720
Faithful will be played.

92
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:14,545
Bah! Fodder. Absolute fodder. It must be Forever!

93
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:18,396
Faithful.

94
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:19,843
Forever!

95
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:22,145
Faithful.

96
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:24,767
Forever!

97
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:29,289
Faithful.

98
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,773
It will be Forever, or there will be no wedding!

99
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:41,157
No wedding? But the cake
and the pretty flowers and..

100
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:47,013
oh Bombo, you'll love Faithful.

101
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,513
Ahh!

102
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:04,558
It's war!

103
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:27,053
There's a giant on the beach!

104
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:35,779
It's war!

105
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,816
War. Woe is me. Woe is me.

106
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:55,332
I found a mountain, your majesty. I found it!
It was man, a man mountain!

107
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:56,985
War isn't nice.

108
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,504
It was, was this big!

109
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,106
No, no. It was this big!

110
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,287
People get hurt in wars.

111
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:06,374
He's as big, as big as, as,.. big as, as, as..

112
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,912
Wait your majesty!

113
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,379
Bombo can't frighten me. No sir.

114
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,115
Don't stand there like a nincompoop!

115
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:19,411
I'm trying to tell you that there's a giant!

116
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:23,826
When I get my dandruff up, then look out.

117
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:34,981
But Glory, poor little Glory.

118
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:55,412
Don't look now gentleman, but it's war.

119
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:58,304
War? Whoopee!

120
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:04,871
# Forever, forever, #

121
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:09,954
# There won't be anyone but you. #

122
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:19,189
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #

123
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:23,474
# Forever, forever, #

124
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:28,435
# You'll share in everything I do, #

125
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:36,727
# And keep smiling through, my sweet. #

126
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:45,926
# I'll have just you here in my heart, #

127
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:54,093
# And I'll trust you though we're apart. #

128
00:16:54,113 --> 00:17:02,601
# So, forever, forever, #

129
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,003
# My guiding angel you will be. #

130
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:28,692
# So always have faith in me. #

131
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:44,358
Shh!

132
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:46,485
Shh!

133
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:48,247
Shh!

134
00:17:56,718 --> 00:18:00,719
War. Ha. Ha. Rolls off my back like a duck.

135
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:03,350
But, but I'm, but I'm trying to tell ya!

136
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm telling ya there's, there's a...

137
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:06,913
What's on your mind?

138
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:08,889
I said..

139
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:09,806
Speak up, man.

140
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,850
There's a giant on the beach!
There's a giant on the beach!

141
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,245
For heaven's sake, Gabby.
Button your mouth.

142
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:18,133
Can't you see I have a war on my hands?

143
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:20,119
Be off with you. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

144
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:21,742
A war?

145
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:24,924
Do you suppose he could be a, a spy?

146
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:28,834
Who's a spy? Who's a spy?

147
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:31,925
THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!

148
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,613
A giant? Giant? Why don't you tell me things?

149
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:37,067
Do something. Don't stand there.
Go. Sic the dogs on him.

150
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,729
Fetch him to me at once!

151
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,054
Wake up! Wake up!

152
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:44,086
There's a giant on the beach!
A giant on the beach!

153
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:48,637
Wake up, I tell ya! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!

154
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:51,122
Wake up! Wake up!
Giant on the beach!

155
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,262
Wake up! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!

156
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,544
A giant on the beach!
Wake up, I tell ya! Wake up!

157
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:58,956
There's a giant on the beach!

158
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,169
Wake up! Wake up!
Giant on the beach!

159
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:04,829
Wake up! Wake up! There's a giant on the beach!
A giant on the beach!

160
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:07,049
Wake up! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!

161
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:09,013
A giant, on the beach?

162
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:09,962
A giant?

163

On the beach!

172
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:25,863
I said, "There's a giant on the beach!"

173

Bring cables and tools.
Bring horses and mules.

Shh!

182
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:45,897
Hmm!

183
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:03,811
Shh! Quiet. We're almost there.

184
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:24,220
Whoaa!

185
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:27,792
Wh, where, where is it?

186
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:32,588
I don't know, but it was right here.

187
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:36,042
Here?

188
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:39,971
Oh yeah? Well where is it now?

189
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:45,029
Well ah, ah, I can't understand it.
It was right here.

190
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:48,633
Honest.

191
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:53,111
Giant, huh! Dragging us out
into the dead of the night.

192
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,318
Yeah, chasing wild geese.

193
00:21:55,353 --> 00:21:58,248
Gabby must have been seeing things.

194
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:02,926
Maybe it just got up and flew away.

195
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:07,337
Yeah, and breathing fire.

196
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:12,691
Look out Gabby.
Your giant's gonna bite ya!

197
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:22,410
Hey, hey fellas, maybe it was me he saw.
Look. I'm a giant! I'm a giant!

198
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:41,720
Psst!

199
00:22:43,855 --> 00:22:45,962
Psst! Psst! Psst!

200
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:50,409

203
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:51,234
And well, there he is.

204
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:52,031
Huh?

205
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:55,669
HE SAID, "THAT'S THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!"

206
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,460
Shh!

207
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,843
Shh!

208
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:01,392
Shh!

209
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:02,850
There isn't a moment to waste.

210
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:05,008
Every last man must do all that he can.

211
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,701
Work with the greatest of haste.

212
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:10,670
So bind up its hands, its arms,
its chest, its neck, its feet!

213
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:12,239
And I'll do the rest.

214
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:14,822
Let's go!

215
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,200

Quiet.

217
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:42,956
Quiet.

218
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:44,788
Quiet.

219
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:47,923
Hey?

220
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,007
Shh!

221
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:27,503
Careful!

222
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:31,542
Up!

223
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:54,440
Put him there! No! No! Here!
Don't be afraid man!

224
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:59,674
Aw! Aw! He got me! He got me!

226
00:27:03,157 --> 00:27:04,230
Hey!

Well, what are you rubes waiting for?
Tie him up!

228
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:00,103
Get the wheel. Come on, roll in the plate.

229
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:02,336
Bring pegs to hold him.
Bring jacks, tacks, cleats, axe.

230

00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,677
Come on now! Let's go! Heave, ho!

Lower wave in!

00:32:45,284 --> 00:32:49,947
All set below!

244
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:55,002
Okay, let's go!

245
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:58,843

Giddy up!

248
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:32,911
Oh! Oh! Oh!

249
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,128
Pull in the ropes there!

250
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:41,727
Not so fast! Not so fast!
Hurry up, there! Slow down!

251
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,251
Get the wheels past!

252
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:50,404
Phew! I don't know what they would do
around here without ME!

253
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:56,219
Ohhhh!

254
00:33:58,676 --> 00:34:01,605
Heave! Heave!

255
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:20,394

at our weddings... Faithful.

256
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,514
Faithful.

257
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:32,413
Your, your, your majesty.

258
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:34,764
Huh?

259
00:35:34,822 --> 00:35:36,761
I've got the giant!

260
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:43,361
The giant. Oh, yes, yes, the giant.
Well bring him in. Bring him in.

261
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,718
Okay. Okay.

262
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:50,581
Your majesty, I don't think he'd fit in here.

263
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,999
Oh you don't, huh?
So it's not good enough for him, hmm?

264
00:35:55,097 --> 00:35:58,844
Well where is he?

265
00:35:58,894 --> 00:36:01,330
Out there, your majesty.

266
00:36:07,189 --> 00:36:10,220
Now, then.

267
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:16,021
Humph! Not good enough for him!

268
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:37,900
Well, where is he?

269
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:43,312
From here. On!

270
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:56,119
Call out the guards, the army, the navy,
women and children first, I'll see you later.

271
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:33,990
Search him, men. He may be armed.

272
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:02,998
Ohhhh!

273

280
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:42,859
Help! I won't taste good.
I'll give you indigestion.

281
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:45,902
A man. A tiny man.

282
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:49,099
You can't do this to me.
I've got a wife and kids.

283
00:39:49,129 --> 00:39:50,714
Millions of kids.

284
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:54,113
Hold on there, mate.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

285
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:59,115
Help! Put me down! Help! Help!

286
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,025
Drop that! Drop that!

287
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:06,396
Well, another one. Who are you?

288
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:10,613
Who me? What? I'm king around here.

289
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:13,153
Guards! Guards! To the turrets!

290
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:18,416
Archers! Surround the giant!
Surround the giant! Guards!

291
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:31,577
Well.

292
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:42,650
Huh! You'll pay for this.

293
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:44,525
Ready!

294
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:47,092
Aim, fire. Aim, fire.

295
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:51,344
Aim!

296
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:52,910
Fire, fire, fire.

297
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:11,460
How do you like that?

298
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:17,760
Want some more?
All right, let her go!

299
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:21,677
It's Bom

300
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:23,571
Bo!

301
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:27,653
Force the gates! Man the battlements!
Defend the city!

302
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,045
We're attacked! We're attacked!

303
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:44,611
Stop! Stop you swine!

304
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:49,003
Get back to your posts!
Get back there and fight!

305
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,060
We of Blefuscu are not!

306
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:59,482
... afraid of anything.

307
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:10,872
Well, where's everyone gone?

308
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:13,887
This is no way to treat a harmless visitor.

309
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:32,988
Look Gabby, we've won! Gabby! Gabby?

310
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:40,482
See Gabby? They've gone.
Yes, sir. Scared stiff.

311
00:42:56,793 --> 00:42:59,741
Hello there.

312
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:08,592
Come now, don't let my size frighten you.

313
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:15,762
You, your majesty, surely
you're not afraid of me?

314
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:17,797
Nuh uh.

315
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:21,823
Well, good. Then let me present myself.

316
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:28,175
My name is Gulliver, your majesty.
Lemuel Gulliver, a shipwrecked sailor.

317
00:43:28,196 --> 00:43:30,438
At your service.

318
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:35,138
Well, welcome to Lilliput,
Mr., Mr. Gulliver.

319
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:38,776
Uh Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?

320
00:43:38,798 --> 00:43:43,278
Well your majesty,
I can lick anybody my size.

321
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:46,440
Ah, splendid, splendid!

322
00:43:46,485 --> 00:43:50,841
I don't think Bombo will give us any
further trouble while you're around here.

323
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:52,683
No sir!

324
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:56,195
He's on our side, Gabby.

325
00:43:56,493 --> 00:43:58,478
He's on our side!

326
00:43:58,501 --> 00:43:59,994
There's nothing to fear!

327
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:03,465
The man mountain's on our side!

328
00:44:12,924 --> 00:44:16,383
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #

329
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:17,880
# Never mind that cloud. #

330
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:20,716
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #

331
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:24,287
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #

332
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,785
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #

333
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:28,628
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #

334
00:44:28,763 --> 00:44:32,789
# Everyone, come on have fun. All's well! #

335
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:41,405
# All's well! All's well! All's well! #

336
00:44:42,831 --> 00:44:45,008
# It's a hap-hap-happy day #

337
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:47,610
# Toodle-oodle-oodle-oodle-oodle-lay #

338
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,833
# For you and me for us and we #

339
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,080
# All the clouds have rolled away #

340
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:54,358

343
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:01,477
# It's a hap-hap-happy day #

344
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:07,312

00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,115

00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:23,791
# It's a hap-hap-happy day #

352
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,766
# Four and twenty sunbeams #

353
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:28,453
# Are dancing round my face #

354
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:30,130
# Four score and twenty more #

355
00:45:30,158 --> 00:45:31,773
Come on, where are those buttons?

356
00:45:31,808 --> 00:45:33,172
# Are dancing every place #

357
00:45:33,242 --> 00:45:35,246

359
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:40,292
# You can't go wrong if you sing that song #

360
00:45:40,331 --> 00:45:42,615
# It's a hap-hap-happy day #

361
00:46:02,566 --> 00:46:04,203
# Four and twenty sunbeams #

362

366
00:46:17,453 --> 00:46:19,289
# It's a hap-hap-happy day! #

367
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:54,944
Out of soap! Push him up!

368
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:58,588
Out of soap! Push him up!

369
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,140
Outta the tub! He's a coming up!

370
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:17,393
Hey look out! Grab it! Pull it off! Nab it!

371
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:20,048
Pull it off! Take it off!

372
00:48:19,092 --> 00:48:22,564
You understand that not until
that giant is removed

373
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:26,377
can our forces taste the sweet fruits of victory!

374
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:32,378
Now then, it is up to you to carry
this message to my spies in Lilliput.

375
00:48:38,354 --> 00:48:42,167
Be off and may luck be with you!

376
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:48,123
Too-de-loo!

377
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:51,367
Get going!

378
00:49:30,472 --> 00:49:34,867
Your majesty, I'm sorry the
little princess isn't with us.

379
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:39,368
Yes, too bad. Too much
excitement for one day.

380
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:52,261
# There are bluebirds in the moonlight #

381
00:50:52,328 --> 00:50:57,251
# Silly idea, bluebirds in the moonlight #

382
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:01,081
# But that's how I feel when I'm with you #

383
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:05,536
# There are night owls in the daylight #

384
00:51:05,652 --> 00:51:10,205
# Silly idea, night owls in the daylight #

385
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:14,236
# Or maybe my heart is saying
whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo #

386
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:18,361
# Who is the one for us? #

387
00:51:18,394 --> 00:51:22,738
# You - it's what you've done for us #

388
00:51:22,766 --> 00:51:27,208
# There are bluebirds in the moonlight #

389
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:31,407
# Silly idea, bluebirds in the moonlight #

390
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:36,557
# But that's how I feel when I'm with you #

391
00:51:40,006 --> 00:51:44,930
# There are bluebirds in the moonlight #

392
00:51:45,153 --> 00:51:48,653
# Silly idea, bluebirds in the moonlight #

393
00:51:48,687 --> 00:51:53,130
# But that's how I feel when I'm with you #

394
00:51:53,155 --> 00:51:57,560
# There are night owls in the daylight #

395
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:01,955
# Silly idea, night owls in the daylight #

396
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:06,312
# I only think my heart is saying
whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo #

397
00:52:06,703 --> 00:52:10,398
# Who is the one for us? #

398
00:52:10,547 --> 00:52:14,443
# You - that's what you've done for us #

399
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:19,157
# There are bluebirds in the moonlight #

400
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:23,589
# Silly idea, bluebirds in the moonlight #

401
00:52:23,634 --> 00:52:26,444
# But that's how I feel when I'm with you #

402
00:52:26,486 --> 00:52:34,874
# I'm that way about you! #

403
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:32,081
# Come home again, come home #

404
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:40,752
# Wherever you may be #

405
00:54:41,617 --> 00:54:52,826
# Come home again you sailor man, sailor man #

406
00:54:54,544 --> 00:55:05,942
# Home again to the sea #

407
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:15,876
# I hear a dream all day #

408
00:55:16,075 --> 00:55:25,125
# A dream that calls to me #

409
00:55:25,298 --> 00:55:37,674
# Come home again you sailor man, sailor man #

410
00:55:37,819 --> 00:55:53,057
# Home again to the sea #

411
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:49,841
Ahoy, mate! Ahoy, m...

412
00:56:52,129 --> 00:56:56,549
Ahoy, mate! Ahoy! Ahoy!
I see that you're a sailor boy.

413
00:56:56,658 --> 00:56:58,349
I owned a boat. A beauty, too.

414
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:00,500
Fifty times as big as your a,

415
00:57:00,636 --> 00:57:02,313
as big as your a,

416
00:57:02,825 --> 00:57:04,478
as big as your shoe.

417
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,095
My, my.

418
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:07,988
Hoy, hoy.

419
00:57:08,022 --> 00:57:10,114
Lost her though in a glorious gale,

420
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:12,244
but I came home on
the back of a whale.

421
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,293
But tell me though how
you caught the whale.

422
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:19,269
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.

423
00:57:20,384 --> 00:57:22,237
My, my.

424
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:24,211
I, I,

425
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,490
I climbed a mountain peak so high.

426
00:57:26,516 --> 00:57:29,274
I bumped my head against the sky.

427
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:33,039
And there I was, where was I?

428
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:35,037
On the Island of Alibi.

429
00:57:35,116 --> 00:57:37,240
Hoy, hoy.

430
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:39,338
My, my.

431
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:42,548
Hi, hi.

432
00:57:43,681 --> 00:57:45,571
But now my life is very dull.

433
00:57:45,676 --> 00:57:48,450
They ought to make me an admiral.

434
00:57:48,497 --> 00:57:52,036
Now that's the job that I'd enjoy.

435
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:55,469
I must be going. Ahoy! Ahoy!

436
00:57:57,386 --> 00:58:01,343
My, my, my.

437
00:58:17,603 --> 00:58:20,886
You put that ball in there.

438
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:24,351
And then it goes down and around.

439
00:58:24,497 --> 00:58:25,860
Pull that thing.

440
00:58:25,887 --> 00:58:30,622
And it comes out here.

441
00:58:49,028 --> 00:58:52,319
The g-g-g-g-giant!

442
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:54,829
Wow!

443
00:59:02,969 --> 00:59:06,800
The light. The light.
Douse the light!

444
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,178
He's gone.

445
00:59:31,261 --> 00:59:34,097
Phew!

446
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:17,495
Hello! Anybody in there?

447
01:00:18,057 --> 01:00:20,007
Nobody here but just us spi...

448
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,828
Chickens!

449
01:00:24,606 --> 01:00:27,183
My, my.

450
01:00:38,814 --> 01:00:43,759
# Forever, forever, #

451
01:00:43,818 --> 01:00:48,505
# There won't be anyone but you. #

452
01:00:48,535 --> 01:00:57,145
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #

453
01:00:57,495 --> 01:01:01,968
# Forever, forever, #

454
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:05,609
# La, la, la, la, la, la. #

455
01:01:06,488 --> 01:01:10,644
# Forever, forever, #

456
01:01:10,654 --> 01:01:13,210
Forever! Forever!

457
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:15,768
That's the song of Blefescu!

458
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:16,473
A spy!

459
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,466
Charge!

460
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:18,411
A spy!

461
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:19,678
A spy!

462
01:01:20,073 --> 01:01:20,940
Charge!

463
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,207
A spy! A spy!

464
01:01:22,216 --> 01:01:23,722
Charge!

465
01:02:02,508 --> 01:02:04,596
Where is he? Where did he go?

466
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:06,209
Concealing a spy.

467
01:02:06,243 --> 01:02:10,630
And at a time of war, too.
That makes it worse!

468
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,841
Carry on the search men!

469
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:19,607
Mind you, your father will hear of this.

470
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:55,099
King Bombo,
Say the word and the giant is a dead duck.

471
01:02:55,181 --> 01:02:57,567
..is a dead duck.

472
01:02:59,678 --> 01:03:03,225
P.S. What do we do with the body?

473
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:11,532
Two hearts and a wedding
broken by a melody?

474
01:03:11,546 --> 01:03:14,708
Incredible!

475
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,917
Wait a minute.

476
01:03:20,937 --> 01:03:24,501
I have an idea that might turn
this malice to a melody!

477
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:29,347
Sing Faithful and Forever
together, as one song.

478
01:03:43,684 --> 01:03:46,468
The giant will be a dead duck.

479
01:03:46,514 --> 01:03:50,249
Ha! Now we are getting at somewhere!

480
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:56,978
Dear Spies, Destroy. Crush.
Obliterate! Annihilate!

481
01:03:57,145 --> 01:03:59,602
Kill him!

482
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,765
I will attack at dawn!

483
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:06,154
Affectionately yours, Bombo.

484
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:26,215
Whatcha got there?

485
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:35,970
Attack at dawn. Attack..
Bombo's attack.., Bom..., Bom...

486
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,686
Guards! Guards! Guards!

487
01:04:37,721 --> 01:04:41,110
Bombo's attacking! Bombo's attacking!

488
01:04:41,262 --> 01:04:42,826
Bombo's attacking at dawn!

489
01:04:42,852 --> 01:04:45,459
Bombo's attacking! It's war!

490
01:04:45,557 --> 01:04:48,301
Bombo's attacking! It's war! It's war!

491
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:51,181
It's the end of the ending!

492
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,468
To the beach! To the beach!

493
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,050
Bomb.. attacking!

494
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:55,916
What?

495
01:04:55,966 --> 01:04:57,422
Bombo attacking!

496
01:04:57,595 --> 01:04:59,443
It's war! It's war!

497
01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:01,941
To the beach! To the beach!

498
01:05:01,966 --> 01:05:07,566
The enemy attacks!

499
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,966
To defend Lilliput.

500
01:05:14,356 --> 01:05:18,392
To defend Lilliput!

501
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:20,659
Yes, forward march.

502
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:28,194
Gulliver! Gulliver! Where are you?

503
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,715
Bombo's attacking.

504
01:05:29,747 --> 01:05:31,578
Where are you Gulliver?
We'll be wiped out!

505
01:05:31,808 --> 01:05:33,778
Gulliver where are you?

506
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:37,283
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!

507
01:05:38,191 --> 01:05:42,368
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!

508
01:05:42,414 --> 01:05:45,534
It's war! Gulliver! It's war!

509
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:52,220
Gulliver! Where are you?

510
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:56,026
Gulliver! Gulliver! It's war!

511
01:05:56,191 --> 01:06:00,184
Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!

512
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:01,533
Put me down.

513
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:07,121
Hah! Well, where you been you
lazy, long legged, overgrown lummox?

514
01:06:07,135 --> 01:06:10,377
Now, get down there to that beach
and wipe out that Bombo

515
01:06:10,419 --> 01:06:11,759
and that bunch of Blefescuians.

516
01:06:12,175 --> 01:06:13,415
And tear em to pieces

517
01:06:13,425 --> 01:06:15,666
and don't leave a man alive
to tell the tale.

518
01:06:15,897 --> 01:06:17,508
Forward march! Get going!

519
01:06:17,566 --> 01:06:20,470
Aye, aye, sir!
My, oh my.

520
01:06:21,383 --> 01:06:24,277
Hey! Wait for me.

521
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:28,470
Gulliver, wait for me!

522
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:30,958
Wait for me, Gulliver!

523
01:07:37,714 --> 01:07:40,005
No note.

524
01:07:48,109 --> 01:07:49,153
Where is it?

525
01:07:49,243 --> 01:07:50,515
What did you done with it?

526
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:51,368
Where did you lose it?

527
01:07:51,457 --> 01:07:52,829
Who's got it now?

528
01:07:54,182 --> 01:07:57,367
Gulliver! Gulliver! Wait for me!

529
01:07:59,147 --> 01:08:03,716
Gulliver! Gulliver!

530
01:08:17,502 --> 01:08:20,101
Let me go! Let me go!

531
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:32,737
Let's go!

532
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:02,588
Hold on there!
We can settle this peacefully.

533
01:09:03,023 --> 01:09:04,883
Listen!

534
01:09:04,997 --> 01:09:07,025
Hold you fire!

535
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:10,233
Hear what I have to say.

536
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,720
Bombo, order your men
to lay down their arms.

537
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:41,260
Must I make you listen?

538
01:10:33,222 --> 01:10:38,060
David, look! Gulliver's thunder machine.

539
01:10:53,862 --> 01:10:56,111
Wait here, Glory.

540
01:10:57,288 --> 01:10:59,494
David!

541
01:11:05,203 --> 01:11:07,004
Fire!

542
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,430
Fire!

543
01:11:30,684 --> 01:11:35,540
Pull! Come on! Pull! Pull!

544
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:13,962
David!

545
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:23,139
Poor, poor, foolish little people.

546
01:12:23,197 --> 01:12:25,119
Look what you've done.

547
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:28,971
Now go ahead! Break your nutshell heads
over your songs!

548
01:12:29,358 --> 01:12:32,672
But did you have to break Glory's heart,
King Little,

549
01:12:32,758 --> 01:12:35,320
because you are thoughtless and selfish?

550
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:41,760
And you Bombo, o mighty warrior,
what have you won?

551
01:12:43,149 --> 01:12:45,337
You were too stubborn to think,

552
01:12:45,423 --> 01:12:50,348
too busy quarrelling to lend ear to the
harmony that might have been yours.

553
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:57,697
But now in your sorrow and despair,

554
01:12:57,715 --> 01:13:01,907
perhaps you will listen to your songs
as they might be sung.

555
01:13:11,314 --> 01:13:20,469
# Faithful forever whatever I do #

556
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:24,874
# Remember I'm true, #

557
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,331
# remember that #

558
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:39,265
# Faithful forever and thankful for you #

559
01:13:39,345 --> 01:13:43,866
# I'll keep smiling through, #

560
01:13:43,927 --> 01:13:47,796
# remember that #

561
01:13:47,876 --> 01:13:56,382
# We may be apart now and then #

562
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:01,686
# But I'll hold you in my heart #

563
01:14:01,699 --> 01:14:09,088
# Till you're in my arms again #

564
01:14:09,173 --> 01:14:19,530
# Faithful forever I promise to be #

565
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:36,148
# So always have faith in me #

566
01:14:40,288 --> 01:14:43,875
In behalf of the peoples of
Blefescu and Lilliput,

567
01:14:43,908 --> 01:14:52,233
With eternal gratitude and love in our hearts,
we christen thee, Gulliver!

568
01:14:55,628 --> 01:15:01,087
# Come back again, come back #

569
01:15:01,186 --> 01:15:07,432
# Wherever you may be #

570
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:15,279
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #

571
01:15:15,285 --> 01:15:23,858
# Back again from the sea #

572
01:15:35,488 --> 01:15:43,665
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #

573
01:15:43,796 --> 01:15:54,582
# Back again from the sea #
