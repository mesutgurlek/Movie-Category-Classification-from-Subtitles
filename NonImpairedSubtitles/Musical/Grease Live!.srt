>> IS HE NICE?

154
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:18,958
>> YEAH.

155
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:20,280
HE TEACHES HEALTH CLASS.

156
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,713
BUT MOSTLY HE JUST SITS IN THE
CORNER AND SMOKES.

157
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:25,393
>> I HAVE A FEELING I'M NOT IN
SALT LAKE ANYMORE.

158
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:44,843
??
>> GOOD MORNING, BOYS AND GIRLS,
AND WELCOME TO RYDELL.

159
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:50,154
I'M NOT SURE YET IF THIS YEAR'S
SENIORS WILL BE THE BEST CLASS
OF THE DECADE, BUT AT LEAST

160
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,616
YOU'LL BE THE LAST.

161
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:57,658
SO LET'S START OFF THE CLASS OF
1959'S FINAL YEAR ON A HIGH
NOTE.

162
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:04,703
??
? AS I GO TRAVELING DOWN LIFE'S
HIGHWAY

163
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:14,671
WHATEVER COURSE MY FORTUNES MAY
FORETELL ?
? I SHALL NOT GO ALONE ON MY WAY

164
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:20,100
FOR THOU SHALL ALWAYS BE WITH ME
RYDELL ?
??

165
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,874
>> NOW, A FEW SHORT
ANNOUNCEMENTS.

166
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:30,691
WE HAVE A NEW ROCKET CLUB
STARTING UP FOR OUR SPACE
ENTHUSIASTS, LED BY OUR OWN

167
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,449
EUGENE FELSNICK.

168
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:38,188
AND SPEAKING OF EXPLOSIVES, THE
SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS DECIDED THIS
YEAR TO SUSPEND OUR

169
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,025
DUCK-AND-COVER EXERCISES AT THE
HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL SINCE MOST OF
YOU ARE TOO BIG TO FIT UNDER THE

170
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:44,803
DESKS.

171
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:50,669
BUT PLEASE NOTE WE'RE ACTIVELY
LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO BUILD A
NEW BOMB SHELTER WITH ENOUGH

172
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,458
ROOM FOR ALMOST EVERYONE.

173
00:09:53,282 --> 00:10:00,000
NEXT FRIDAY WILL BE OUR FIRST
PEP RALLY, AND EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU CAN'T HAVE PEP WITHOUT

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,220
CHEER.

175
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,288
SO DON'T FORGET TO SIGN UP FOR
CHEERLEADING, GIRLS, UNLESS
OF COURSE YOU'VE HAD A PREVIOUS

176
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:06,284
HEAD INJURY.

177
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:12,060
I WANT TO SEE PLENTY OF SUPPORT
FOR COACH CALHOUN AND THE RYDELL
RANGERS.

178
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,008
REMEMBER, IF YOU CAN'T BE AN
ATHLETE, BE AN ATHLETIC
SUPPORTER.

179
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:22,966
AND FINALLY, THE NATIONAL
BANDSTAND TELEVISION SHOW IS
CONSIDERING RYDELL AS A

180
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,989
REPRESENTATIVE AMERICAN HIGH
SCHOOL TO BROADCAST LIVE FROM
OUR GYM.

181
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:34,675
IF CHOSEN, WE WILL HAVE THE
CHANCE TO SHOW THE ENTIRE NATION

AT RYDELL.

183
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:42,370
GOOD LUCK TO US ALL.

184
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:54,174
? THROUGH ALL THE YEARS RYDELL
AND TEARS RYDELL WE GIVE THREE
CHEERS RYDELL FOR THEE ?

191
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:18,849
>> YOU NEVER KNOW.

192
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,925
SOMETIMES HISTORY REPEATS
ITSELF.

193
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,036
>> HEY, GUYS!

194

AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

824
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,080

>> WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GET A
NEW ENGINE?

845
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,190
>> BOYS, THERE'S AN OLD
SAYING -- "THERE'S A SPARE PART
IN EVERY PARKED CAR."

846
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,080
>> WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

847
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,497
>> PRISON.

848
00:45:59,497 --> 00:46:00,120
I LEARNED A LOT.

849
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,130
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

850
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,130
>> SO, YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD
STEAL FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S CARS?

851
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,000
>> I SAID NO SUCH THING.

852
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,230
AND I WILL DENY IT TO THE BOARD
OF EDUCATION.

853
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:13,030
NO, I'M JUST INSPIRING YOU TO
FOLLOW THAT AUTOMOTIVE DREAM AND
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF THE CHEVY

854
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:13,510

860
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,220
I DON'T WANT THE GET IN ANY
TROUBLE.

862
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,160
