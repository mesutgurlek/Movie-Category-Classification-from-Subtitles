1
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,539
The only wonder of the Earth.

2
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:27,532
Which can be seen
even from the space.

3
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:31,503
The Great Wall of China.

4
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:35,612
There was only one reason
to build this wall,

5
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:38,313
The Defense of the Country.

6
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:42,509
Enemies kept on attacking.

7
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:48,580
He kept on fighting.

8
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:55,563
The biggest warrior of
the history of China.

9
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:58,559
Lou Shang

10
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:05,565
Today this wall is only an
attraction for tourists.

11
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:10,341
And the warriors are reduced
to the statues on the roads.

12
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:18,352
Now the enemy has returned.

13
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:20,479
Hojo!

14
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:48,382
Hojo ruled this village.

15
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,513
He knew there's a treasure
buried in this village.

16
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:55,590
He kept on selling that
to the foreigners.

17
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,549
The game Hojo was playing with
the villagers,

18
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:05,552
had only a defeat for them.

19
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:10,489
Only the death.

20
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:14,465
Only the helplessness.

21
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:31,381
ln hard times like this a blind
man looks at the sky.

22
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:35,550
But only those get help

23
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:38,424
who have courage to reach it.

24
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,492
They were seeking the light.

25
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:44,523
To eliminate the darkness
of their lives.

26
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:30,408
The key to their hope was
in their own past.

27
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:34,548
Their centuries old savior
has come back.

28
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,552
He is re-born.

29
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:40,545
Lou Shang.

30
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,386
ln some other guise.

31
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,358
ln some other country.

32
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:51,588
ln a country where the Lord
Buddha was born.

33
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:57,498
ln a city which is still
standing strong

34
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,406
even it got attacked
for seven times.

35
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:03,340
Near a Fort.

36
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:06,541
A fort who's strength shows
the courage of it's warriors.

37
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:12,581
Near a road-crossing, who's lights
are brighter then sunlight.

38
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:17,382
Under all such great things...

39
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:21,454
Their savior is waiting for them.

40
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:23,396
Laughing?

41
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,526
You are no more, son.

42
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:32,438
Where are you going to?

43
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:50,386
l bought lottery of 50 million.

44
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:52,416
l spent 100 rupees on that.

45
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,325
l asked forjust one favor.

46
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:57,523
Just one favor and you can't
do one thing.

47
00:06:57,565 --> 00:06:59,465
You just keep on sitting
like this.

48
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:37,328
Just once Lord.

49
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:38,526
Just once get the lottery.

50
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,569
One, one, six, six.

51
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:45,431
l've won the lottery.

52
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,382
Keep it with you.

53
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,589
l got it, noodles with bread.

54
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:13,425
Here put it down.

55
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:17,336
l'm the only fool who keeps
on working like a dog.

56
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:19,340
Shut up.

57
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:23,401
Here!

58
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:24,604
Do you see this magical
taveez ( amulet)?

59
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:26,574
You'll get lucky with it.

60
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:29,482
lt's a unique magical object.

61
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:31,474
Just for you.

62
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,454
Forjust... How much do
you have in your pocket?

63
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:35,421
What?

64
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:36,445
How much do you have
in your pocket?

65
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:39,484
l'll have to check that.

66
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,589
Only 2 notes.

67
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:47,526
Damn you.
Give it to me.

68
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,331
But shall l become
something?

69
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,339
Stupid! Just put it on.

70
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,568
After that you'll be up

71
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:56,475
and the world will be down.

72
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,479
Master!

73
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:13,350
l wish l had become something,
your menu would've finished.

74
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:16,524
Yes, even since you've come
l'm surviving.

75
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:19,589
Else l would've been begging
in front of the mosque.

76
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:21,358
l know everything.

77
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:22,528
You don't know a thing.

78
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,403
Had l worn that taveez,
l would've been very rich.

79
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:26,599
Hey Sidhu.

80
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:29,434
You are too naive.

81
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:31,536
Don't get into schemes
of such frauds.

82
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,480
Our luck in not in this.

83
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:36,346
lt's in here.

84
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:39,409
Do the hard work.
- Hard work give only sweat.

85
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,545
Not the money.

86
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:43,422
l need money. And for
money l need luck.

87
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,391
And for luck you need
hard work.

88
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:47,451
Don't take out your anger
on that.

89
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:50,487
lt's our fate that we have
to work everyday to survive.

90
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:52,396
Don't make hollow plans.

91
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:53,525
No miracle will happen.

92
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,536
How any miracle will happen

93
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,367
when l didn't wear taveez.

94
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,314
Miracle!

95
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,510
Ganeshji appeared
in potato.

96
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,348
Look!

97
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:14,549
Ganeshji appeared in potato.

98
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:19,450
Hail Ganesh, hail Ganesh.

99
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:59,327
Will you tell us why Ganeshji
chose a potato to appear on?

100
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,336
Don't talk just prostate
and go out.

101
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:09,439
Weekly money?
- Money?

102
00:12:09,477 --> 00:12:10,535
My money.

103
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,304
l knew Bappa will send
you on time.

104
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:51,445
Just be patient with me.

105
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:54,312
Don't smash eggs.

106
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:08,521
You too are here?

107
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:11,395
You always follow me
in every wedding.

108
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,457
Don't spare him.
Beat him

109
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,524
Beat him.

110
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:18,472
l'm the bridegroom.
Why are you beating me?

111
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:19,598
lt's my wedding today.

112
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:21,501
You're ruining me.

113
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,517
Remember one thing.

114
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:35,318
You won't find any vegetable
cutter better then me.

115
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,449
Even you search the
whole Chandni Chowk.

116
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:40,551
l'm best Mughlai...
Where did he go?

117
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:52,498
And...
Chinese?

118
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,503
He too...
Chinese?

119
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:56,402
How should l tell them...

120
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,470
They think the toothpick
is arrow.

121
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,569
What are you doing?

122
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:05,369
You're getting a chance
to have foreign money.

123
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:06,539
And you're refusing it.

124
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,548
lf you say to Sidhu that
these Chinese are

125
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:12,416
taking him to fight with
a dangerous enemy.

126
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,512
He will never go with them.

127
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:17,580
You speak the truth. At least
he will live.

128
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:21,322
lf you give him this chance,
he'll always be grateful.

129
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:23,455
What if that Hojo kills him?

130
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:25,556
Your blood is calling you.

131
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,294
You have to honor your
Chinese blood.

132
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:29,336
Go on the shoulders of Sidhu

133
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:30,392
and earn money from them.

134
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:31,598
Don't do this.
lt's sin.

135
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:33,431
Don't listen to him.
He's an ass.

136
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:34,599
Walk of the path of the truth.

137
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:37,469
Truth?
Truth you get you killed.

138
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:39,479
What are you looking here
and there?

139
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:41,547
And what they are talking
in Sindhi?

140
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,317
Dado Hojo?

141
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:48,419
lf you tell him that Dado Hojo
means to kill Hojo.

142
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:49,480
The whole plan will be ruined.

143
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:51,549
Say something else.

144
00:16:51,592 --> 00:16:56,359
Dado Hojo means you're
too sexy.

145
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,355
You too are sexy.

146
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:01,425
Very sexy.

147
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:04,336
They were also speaking some
thing more.

148
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,531
What does that mean?

149
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:09,467
They mean to say that
you're blessed with Ganeshji.

150
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,378
When such blessing happens,
all things a changed.

151
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:18,351
That Ganeshji has decided that
you're not for these fishes and all.

152
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:21,411
You were a brave king of
China in you previous lifetime.

153
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,548
Lou Shang.

154
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:48,413
Dado Hojo.
l'm going...

155
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:51,475
Chandni Chowk to China.

156
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:29,608
Can l get a girl like
her in China?

157
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:31,409
Like her?

158
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:33,578
You'll have to stay in
the queue to get Chinese visa.

159
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,583
No matter if you're
Miss TSM or whatever.

160
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:37,483
Tell your story to these people.

161
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,424
Maybe any of them can
help you.

162
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,451
l can't help you.

163
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:42,427
Come inside.

164
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:43,485
Come

165
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:46,390
Show your passport madam.

166
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:49,461
Do you have the token?

167
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:50,525
Yes

168
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,571

My lovely Lord.

170
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,317

171
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:07,547
You've come and everything

172
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:10,318
Just it's lack only that

173
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:11,551
Miss TSM

174
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:17,394

bowing it for you.

175
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:26,362
Lord! l'll pay tribute to you
with everything.

176
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,566
Please listen to me.

177
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:31,469
Please Ganpati.

178
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:43,618
Oh my God.

179
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,384
My friend Ganesh!
The dish is ready before order?

180
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:48,452
Listen to me l know
everything.

181
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:51,464
You're so delicate and pretty.

182
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:55,457
You're not simple woman
you're more then that.

183
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:58,471
My number has come,
l'll be right back.

184
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:55,420
Hey give me my token.

00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:16,482
l'll slap you.

186
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:18,417
Will you go to China?

187
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:20,386
No l won't

188
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:23,321
l'm very upset right now.

189
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:25,382
Take this bag and
put it in the shop.

190
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:27,526
Nobody can stop the
wind.

191
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,395
Neither talks nor kicks.

192
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:33,458
Let him go.

193
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,365
You cheater.

194
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:39,338
l'll hit you with the shoe
that you'll get back in senses.

195
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:43,366
You always trust
Wrong men.

196
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,604
You're doing the same
mistake today.

197
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,539
Let me go, it will
get my dream come true.

198
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,445
Don't live in dreams.

199
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:50,347
You'll have nothing when
you'll wake up.

200
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,476
What do l have now?

201
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:53,315
Who's with me?

202
00:22:53,387 --> 00:22:55,378
l don't have money, home,
servants, cars, nothing.

203
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:57,516
l don't even have a mother.

204
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:00,389
l'm scared.

205
00:23:00,427 --> 00:23:03,555
My life started from a dustbin
and will finish in a dumpster.

206
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:20,309
You were this little when l
became your guardian

207
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:22,315
and raised you this big.

208
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:25,512
And you're talking about
a dumpster.

209
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,485
You trust that cheater.

210
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:30,387
You believe a potato
as your lord.

211
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:33,424
But you don't in yourself.

212
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:37,590
l scold you

213
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:39,389
l beat you

214
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:43,403
l have no right over you.
Do l?

215
00:23:43,437 --> 00:23:45,530
You talk about the dumpster.

216
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:49,331
All right.

217
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:51,469
You can go.

218
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:53,410
l don't need anyone.

219
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:55,448
Dada! Please stop.

220
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:57,507
Stop.

221
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:07,484
l understand.

222
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:09,586
That you've taught me
to walk.

223
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:12,557
You've raised me.

224
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:18,505
My fate is not here.

225
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:22,307
My fate is there in China.

226
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:27,608
l know of one thing.

227
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:32,485
lf l fall you'll hold me.

228
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:36,489
Don't be mad.

229
00:24:36,523 --> 00:24:38,457
Let me go.

230
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:47,456
lf everything goes well,
promise me.

231
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:49,365
You'll come to see me
in China.

232
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:53,336
China? No, no.

233
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:56,467
lf you won't come who will
kick me on my behind?

234
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:59,345
How will l fly in the air?

235
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:04,475
Tell me frankly,

236
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,445
that you'll be alone here that's
why you're not letting me go.

237
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:12,516
lsn't it? Don't lie to me.

238
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:24,401
Be careful.

239
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:27,472
A green forest who look
beautiful from far

240
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:29,498
might be too dangerous
from inside.

241
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:36,414
That's how, with the blessings
for his Dada...

242
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,509
Sidhu left for China.

243
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:27,526
l'll shut it down,

244
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:29,558
luggage will fall.

245
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:03,393
This is a wicked woman,
we shouldn't trust her.

246
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,494
She is too wicked.

247
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:06,301
Speak low..

248
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:07,533
You should not trust
any Woman

249
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:17,603
Who threw the banana shell?

250
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:20,513
Beware all Chinese!

251
00:31:22,395 --> 00:31:23,589
Let's sleep.

252
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,350
Hail Ganpati! l'm in China.

253
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:28,350
Be good, you still have time.

254
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:30,363
Look everyone has a student
and you have a sack.

255
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:45,536
Potato Bread!

256
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:50,574
Get aside.

257
00:32:56,489 --> 00:32:57,478
Stop her.

258
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:13,336
Where were you going?

259
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:19,374
Beautiful, delicate?

260
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:21,346
Or wicked and evil?

261
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:24,346
How come you've become
a Chinese?

262
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:26,544
The guise according
to the country.

263
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:30,317
From Rampuri knife to
a Chinese nanchakoo.

264
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:32,517
What's this?

265
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,584
Where did this oven come
from?

266
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:36,590
Who made breads out
of it?

267
00:33:39,532 --> 00:33:41,363
Are you crazy?

268
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:42,334
Why are you bothering that lady?

269
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:43,528
She's not a lady.
She's cheater lady.

270
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,435
Miss TSM.
l won't spare her.

271
00:33:45,505 --> 00:33:46,563
Wait l'm coming too.

272
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,442
Hay Madam, who's this Choochi?

273
00:33:57,484 --> 00:33:59,509
Who's this Choochi?

274
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,537
To find out the reality of Sidhu,
Hojo sent his faithful Joey to lndia.

275
00:36:11,484 --> 00:36:15,545
She was confused that why
did Sidhu was after her?

276
00:36:17,423 --> 00:36:18,583
What did Sidhu see
in her face?

277
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:29,492
l'm Miss TSM from lndia,
Sakhi.

278
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:32,497
How should l explain them?

279
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:37,342
You're welcome to TSM China.
Miss Sakhi.

280
00:37:24,424 --> 00:37:25,584
James Bond?

281
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,456
Now you'll say it's a
parachute too.

282
00:38:01,461 --> 00:38:03,395
Take madam's luggage to
the car.

283
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:04,487
Come Madam.

284
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:07,433
Can l ask something?

285
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,331
You're a celebrity in lndia.

286
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:11,360
Yet you've come here by yourself
to collect samples.

287
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:13,367
From lndia to China.

288
00:38:13,406 --> 00:38:14,498
This far.

289
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:17,365
Far?

290
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:20,445
Actually China is too close to me.

291
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:24,540
lt's the same place where my
mom met my dad.

292
00:38:44,604 --> 00:38:46,538
lt's the same place...

293
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:49,404
Where l and my twin sister
Suzy were born.

294
00:39:05,324 --> 00:39:06,518
lt's the same place..

295
00:39:07,527 --> 00:39:09,427
Where my family got destroyed.

296
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:16,561
You take Suzy and...
- You go l'll come.

297
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:18,598
Yes.
- And you?

298
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,568
There bodies couldn't be found.

299
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:33,471
And mom couldn't bear
that incident.

300
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:37,372
And she too...

301
00:41:38,344 --> 00:41:39,538
She used to always say

302
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:41,376
that they are alive.

303
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:43,573
l've come to China.

304
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,574
l've come this far.

305
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,512
For the peace of their souls.

306
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:51,386
For their peace.

307
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:54,550
Om Shanti (Peace )

308
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:04,528
Who's this?

309
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:10,339
Dad!
Suzy?

310
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:14,572
l've never met you.

311
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:18,417
But l promise you that

312
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,519
l'll never forget you.

313
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:33,416
Subtitles!

314
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,428
They're saying the Lou Shang
died right here.

315
00:43:37,563 --> 00:43:39,531
No he didn't die.

316
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:42,396
He was martyred.

317
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:50,535
Easy.

318
00:43:50,576 --> 00:43:53,477
Why are you standing?
Pay respects.

319
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:20,405
Too many fans in China of TSM!

320
00:44:25,377 --> 00:44:26,469
Police too?

321
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:27,479
Autographs?

322
00:44:29,515 --> 00:44:31,380
No autographs?

323
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:32,543
You're under arrest.
- Arrest?

324
00:45:24,403 --> 00:45:25,563
Actually, l fell.

325
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:27,469
l didn't know what happened.

326
00:46:05,344 --> 00:46:06,402
Not here.
There.

327
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,381
What have l done?

328
00:47:00,466 --> 00:47:03,435
l have come.

329
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:46,310
No one will recognize me.

330
00:47:47,346 --> 00:47:49,507
She returned unsuccessful
once again.

331
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:56,383
She thought her time has come.

332
00:47:57,356 --> 00:47:59,517
But Hojo wanted something else.

333
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:05,495
Sidhu's death.

334
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,567
lt's our lndia's song.

335
00:53:15,474 --> 00:53:17,567
Hey God, why is it so itchy?

336
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,510
Chanchal, Sheetal, Komal?

337
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:29,582
Whatever happened, it was my thinking.

338
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:31,446
lt's not my fault.

339
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,455
Please try to understand.

340
00:53:33,558 --> 00:53:36,527
l didn't do anything but police is still
after me.

341
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:45,326
Teacher, tommorow my photo will
be printed in the newspaper.

342
00:53:46,538 --> 00:53:48,506

Your photo?

343
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:50,575
Yours too.

344
00:53:52,344 --> 00:53:53,504
Teacher, l'll sleep with you.

345
00:53:53,612 --> 00:53:54,476
Go now.

346
00:53:54,546 --> 00:53:55,570
Careful.

347
00:53:56,481 --> 00:53:57,470
Sleep here.

348
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:24,336
She changed her clothes!

349
00:54:40,492 --> 00:54:42,357
Where did you come from?

350
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,574
Save me.

351
00:55:18,597 --> 00:55:21,498
Teacher, l'm the expert of this song.

352
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:46,319
l'm so scared.

353
00:55:46,525 --> 00:55:47,549
l'll sleep in your sack.

354
00:55:53,365 --> 00:55:54,297
What are you doing, teacher?

355
00:55:54,499 --> 00:55:56,592
Nothing, close the door.
l'll be back.

356
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:01,337
Teacher, lock it well she comes
out again and again.

357
00:56:01,406 --> 00:56:03,374
She's a very clever woman.
Come on let's sleep.

358
00:58:03,495 --> 00:58:04,484
What a girl.

359
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,407
So beautiful.

360
00:58:19,477 --> 00:58:23,436
But like the villagers she also thinks
that Siddhu is Lu-Shang.

361
00:58:32,624 --> 00:58:33,556
He's nothing.

362
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,418
He cuts vegitables on Chandni Chowk.

363
00:58:37,596 --> 00:58:38,585
He does as l say.

364
00:58:40,432 --> 00:58:41,456
He's not Lu-Shang.

365
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:07,552
That's what l was saying.
Siddhu is nothing.

366
00:59:22,574 --> 00:59:28,513
Meow Meow has found a precious
gift for Hojo this time.

367
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:32,541
Key to the death of Siddhu.

368
01:00:46,591 --> 01:00:48,422
You don't need to tell him anything.

369
01:01:00,438 --> 01:01:01,405
Tell them.

370
01:01:03,541 --> 01:01:04,473
His reality.

371
01:01:06,578 --> 01:01:09,376
He's nothing.
He's just a fraud.

372
01:01:09,547 --> 01:01:12,482
He cuts vegitables.
He's a fool.

373
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:16,349
Daddy, l have made him a fool.

374
01:01:19,424 --> 01:01:23,588
He doesn't even know that he's been
brought here to kill Hojo.

375
01:01:27,365 --> 01:01:30,334
He's telling the truth.
l've brought proof. Hojo.

376
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:11,600
She always breaks the lock.

377
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:22,991
What do you want now?

378
01:17:37,107 --> 01:17:40,167
I'm Iike a dog.
Nor here or there.

379
01:17:41,979 --> 01:17:43,913
I can't go back to Chandni Chowk.

380
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:48,941
PIease give me work here, I'II
do anything, I'II poIish your shoes.

381
01:17:56,927 --> 01:17:58,918
To bring Meow Meow and Sakhi
together.

382
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:01,087
Chopstick joined Hojo's gang.

383
01:18:03,133 --> 01:18:04,964
And after three months.

384
01:18:10,173 --> 01:18:11,970
One hand on my head.

385
01:18:13,076 --> 01:18:15,044
And with the other one you
stoIe my grandfather.

386
01:18:16,113 --> 01:18:17,876
Why did you do that, God?

387
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:22,942
What do I do here with these
Chinese?

388
01:18:23,153 --> 01:18:24,120
Where do I go?

389
01:18:25,956 --> 01:18:28,015
No speaks Hindi here.

390
01:18:29,026 --> 01:18:30,050
Show me the way.

391
01:18:31,194 --> 01:18:32,923
Show me the way.

392
01:18:34,097 --> 01:18:36,895
He's gone mad.
TaIking to a potato.

393
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:40,967
Hey make French fries and eat it.

394
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:44,937
You're so sIim.

395
01:18:46,076 --> 01:18:47,100
It's not a potato.

396
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:50,045
It's not a potato.
It's my GOD.

397
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,114
Don't taIk rubbish you beggar.

398
01:18:54,117 --> 01:18:56,176
And peopIe say that I'm crazy.

399
01:19:05,128 --> 01:19:05,992
What did you say?

400
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:08,062
What?

401
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:12,158
I said that peopIe say that I'm crazy.

402
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,907
How did you say that?

403
01:19:20,077 --> 01:19:21,942
I said it Iike that they said it.

404
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:23,912
You spoke Hindi!

405
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:26,107
No I spoke Chinese.

406
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:28,048
No.

407
01:19:29,019 --> 01:19:30,111
You spoke Hindi.

408
01:19:31,154 --> 01:19:34,055
How can I speak Hindi?
I'm Chinese.

409
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:37,922
You're Chinese but you spoke Hindi.

410
01:19:45,002 --> 01:19:46,026
I don't know anything.

411
01:19:48,005 --> 01:19:51,031
I asked of you to show me the way
and you sent me guide.

412

Strange man.

He thinks he's a poIiceman.

506
01:39:20,176 --> 01:39:21,143

and when peopIe ask where is
Grandfather, what shaII I say?

510
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:38,126

511
01:39:39,061 --> 01:39:41,996

because he is dead.

516
01:40:12,094 --> 01:40:14,187
Hojo kiIIed him on the middIe of
the road.

517
01:40:16,098 --> 01:40:19,067
he came to China from Chandni Chowk
to hug me..

518
01:40:20,135 --> 01:40:21,124
and Hojo cut his throat.

519
01:40:26,175 --> 01:40:27,972
but I wiII take revenge with Hojo.

520
01:40:29,011 --> 01:40:30,876
