hey!

21
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:37,385
Well, well, well,

22
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:39,087
if it isn't
the rover boys.

23
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:43,459
Aren't you guys ever
going to grow up?

24
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,228
Is this any way
to greet your american heroes?

25
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:48,064
Come on, tim,
don't spoil our last day together.

26
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:48,965
Yeah, give us
a pleasant smile.

27
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,800
We've been over there
cutting the german lines,

28
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,101
protecting your right
to cut your scotch.

29
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,703
We've been gone
over two years.

30
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:55,105
Haven't you
missed us, tim?

31
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:55,739
Sure, i missed you.

32
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,708
I got a little
tab here exactly two years old.

33
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,910
Take care of it, banker.

34
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:02,613
$75.80. fork up
or no liquor.

35
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:04,648
You're
a sentimentalist at heart, tim.

36
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,884
Listen, this
is a bar, not a barbershop.

37
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:08,920
What do
you got there? Hey, silvio!

38
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,389
You guys act as if
you own the joint.

39
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,991
Hey, silvio!
Hey! Hi!

40
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:17,263
Silvio!
Hey!

41
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,163
Hey, silvio!

42
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:23,469
What's he
going to make?

43
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,737
3 ham
sandwiches. Great cook.

44
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,339
Come on, tim,
set 'em up. Put 'em on a tab.

45
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,108
No more tabs.
Cash.

46
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,777
You're civilians now.
You owe me a buck for this,

47
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,346
and i think
you're overtipping.

48
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,347
Tim, what do
you mean? We can't-

49
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,117
i just wanted you
to know i didn't forget it

50
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:39,453
and you can't put
anything over on me.

51
00:03:39,454 --> 00:03:42,455
Keep the dough.
You're going to need it.

52
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,158
Gee, tim-

53
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:45,359
tim, i'd like
to leave you with a little remembrance

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,695
because we're all
busting up and going home.

55
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:48,496
This is for you.

56
00:03:48,497 --> 00:03:50,932
Take it, save it,
frame it, put it up over the bar.

57
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:52,434
Someday it'll
be worth millions.

58
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:52,967
What is it?

59
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,969
What is it?
It's an original douglas hallerton.

60
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,870
Security
for your old age.

61
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:57,973
I'm trying
to attract patrons, not scare them away.

62
00:03:57,974 --> 00:04:00,208
Tim, this saloon will be
famous someday because this painting's here.

63
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,678
Yeah! Like places
that say george washington slept here. Like that.

64
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:06,215
Yeah, like that.

65
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:06,616
Coming up!

66
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:08,985
That's a pretty
picture.

67
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:09,785
Looks like
a pizza pie.

68
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:11,554
Yeah, we call it
the picture you eat with a spoon.

69
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,990
Stand back one second,
silvio. Do you mind?

70
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:15,158
Just a little room.

71
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,493
Huh! Hoo! Huh!

72
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:20,331
Ted, got some mail for you.

73
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:23,133
I hope it's the one.
It is!

74
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:23,802
A dame?

75
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:24,902
The future mrs. Riley!

76
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:27,472
Wife of one
of the future lawmakers of the united states.

77
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:28,039
This no-goodnik?

78
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,074
No-goodnik?
Head man in his school.

79
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:30,875
President of
the pittsburgh

80
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,344

00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:34,579
A born leader!

83
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,848
Both: Vote for riley!

84
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:36,748
"Dearest ted,

85
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:40,151
"i have missed you
so terribly and worried about you constantly,

86
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:43,321
"so far away
and in such danger all the time.

87
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:44,523
"You know there is
no one in the world

88
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,492
"nearer and dearer
to me than you, ted, dear.

89
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:49,395
"I know you'll have
a brilliant career when you finish law school,

90
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:53,098
"but we haven't seen
each other in several years, and people grow up and change.

91
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:56,769
"Ted, i hope it
makes no difference in our friendship

92
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,306
"just because i happened
to get married last month.

93
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:02,308
Joe is the most
wonderful guy in the world."

94
00:10:29,064 --> 00:10:29,330
Hey!

95
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,568
Oh, back again.

96
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:34,436
Come on, tim,
give us a drink.

97
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:37,538
All right. All right.
One more and that's it.

98
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:41,710
It's closing time.
It's 4:00.

99
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:43,412
Closing time?
Where's the clock?

100
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,581
Well, we got to help
old tim close up.

101
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:47,249
Well, of course.

102
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:47,584
Come on.

103
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:55,325
Hey! Watch that!

104
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:55,660
Sorry.

105
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:58,428
The war's over.
People don't love drunk civilians

106
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,097
like they love
tipsy soldiers.

107
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:00,398
Hey!

108
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:03,332
We're civilians now!

109
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:14,244
Oh, the time has
come for parting

110
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:20,383
and the marching
music ends

111
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:26,191
no matter where
our lives may lead us

112
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,797
in our hearts,
we'll still be friends

113
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,404
though the time
has come for parting

114
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:45,277
and the future
lies unknown

115
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:51,184
although the years
may come between us

116
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:57,625
we will never feel alone

117
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:05,233
for friends we are now

118
00:12:07,904 --> 00:12:10,772
and friends we'll stay

119
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:16,779
until we meet again

120
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:23,519
one wonderful day

121
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,278
although the time
has come for parting

122
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:54,419
we'll be friends
until we die

123
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:05,332
tim: Stop, you guys.
What are you kidding yourselves for?

124
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,835
A month from now,
you won't even remember each other's names.

125
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:10,004
All: What?

126
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:11,072
Sure, you're great
buddy-buddies now.

127
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:14,142
I've seen it before.
It's like a girl you meet up in the catskills.

128
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:16,410
You never see her again
when you get back to the city.

129
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:17,278
Hey, what are you
talking about?

130
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,448
This is different.
We've been together 4 years.

131
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:21,049
The war's over, kids.

132
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,851
In a month from now-

133
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:24,720
all right, tim.
You give us one month, huh?

134
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,789
I say we're
friends for life

135
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,589
and nothing
can change it.

136
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,892
5 years, 10 years...
look, tim, i'll make you a bet.

137
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:34,863
10 years from today,
october 11, 1955, at 12:00 noon.

138
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,837
No matter where we are
or what we're doing,

139
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:43,305
the 3 of us are going
to walk right through that door and meet here.

140
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:45,643
Right, guys?

141
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:46,777
Both: Right.
You're crazy.

142
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:48,012
You want
to bet $1,000?

143
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:48,380
Please.

144
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:51,882
All right, then. A buck
from each of us against one buck from you.

145
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,418
Enjoy. Enjoy.

146
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:59,523
Not to be opened
till 1955.

147
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:01,826
In the safe.

148
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:04,896
I'll make a little memo
here for ourselves.

149
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,467
October 11, 1955.

150
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:09,001
You said it.

151
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:12,237
Good luck, guys.
I'll probably never see you again,

152
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:13,506
but good luck anyway.

153
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:14,240
You'll see us.

154
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:17,042
You got a date
october 11, 1955.

155
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:19,612
12:00 noon.

156
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:22,915
Start chilling a bottle
of champagne right now.

157
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:31,292
You sure you're going
to be all right, ted?

158
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:33,694
Sure. Sure.

159
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,463
Well, so long.

160
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,382
Kid mariacchi.

161
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,452
Go ahead, kid.

162
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:00,887
Nashby, sports herald.
You manage the kid?

163
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:01,989
Yeah.
Hiya, rocky.

164
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,689
What do you say, sport?

165
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,891
Why don't you give him
a little squib?

166
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:05,659
Why don't you have him over
at stillman's about 4:00?

167
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,160
We'll shoot
some glamour stuff.

168
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:07,728
Thanks very much.

169
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:08,996
You're new in
the fight racket, huh?

170
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:12,166
Yeah. Didn't even know
i was going to be in it until about 8 months ago.

171
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,168
I won the kid
in a game of chance.

172
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:15,403
Huh?
A crap game.

173
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:17,672
No credit to me.
I figured i couldn't get anything with him

174
00:17:17,673 --> 00:17:20,642
if i tried to hock him,
so i tried to do something with him.

175
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:22,210
You sure did do
something with him.

176
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:23,345
This kid's no punk.

177
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:24,380
8 knockouts
in a row.

178
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:25,514
Number 9 tonight,
huh, kid? Yeah.

179
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:27,383
Mr. Nashby,
sports herald.

180
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:28,350
You look great,
mariacchi.

181
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,185
Best of luck
tonight. Thanks.

182
00:17:30,186 --> 00:17:32,321
How you feeling,
kid? I'm ok.

183
00:17:32,322 --> 00:17:33,355
Look, get a couple
hours of shuteye

184
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:35,558
and then meet me
over at stillman's gym at 4:00.

185
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,026
The newspapers
want some pictures.

186
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:38,194
I don't need
no pictures.

187
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:41,398
Any pictures.
And you do need pictures.

188
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:42,699
Give me something
for a cab, will you? A fin?

189
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,868
A fin? I got exactly
$2.00 and some loose change.

190
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:49,340
Here, take it all.

191
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:51,375
Hey, what's this?
Confederate money?

192
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:52,709
Hey, give me that.

193
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,046
October 11, 1955.

194
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,213
Hey, that's today.

195
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:58,649
Today? That-

196
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,187
oh, doug and angie.

197
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:07,192
What am i
talking about?

198
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:09,462
If i go over there,
nobody will show up.

199
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,730
I'm the biggest
sucker of all time.

200
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:13,031
Where do you have to go?

201
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:15,800
Tim's bar
on third avenue.

202
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,637
It's a long way
from here.

203
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,538
You're nuts.
It's 10 minutes.

204
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:21,275
No.

205
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:25,878
It's 10 years.

206
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,560
What can i do
for you?

207
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:42,629
Oh, could i just have
a glass of water, please?

208
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:57,514
Say, uh, when
did you get this?

209
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,449
Ex-g.i. Gave it
to me a long time ago.

210
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,118
Funny thing. Lots of
people ask me about it.

211
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,153
He went off to europe
to paint or something.

212
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,972
Long distance. I'd like
to place a call to chicago.

213
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:24,141
Long beach 1-0-8-8-0.
Mrs. Douglas hallerton, please.

214
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:28,913
Tune in tonight
at 11:00 for miss mop-up, miss mop-up, miss mop-up.

215
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,653

K-l-e-n-z-r-l-t-e spells klenzrite!

218
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:54,007
Hello? Hello, dorothy?
This is doug.

219
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:57,510
I'm in new york.
No, not on business,

220
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,647
something much
more important.

221
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,783
Dorothy, what is this number
where they reached you?

222
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:06,955
Oh, your lawyer's.
Well, dorothy, look.

223
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,494
Do you have to go
through with it?

224
00:20:11,495 --> 00:20:14,463
I know, but if you
love me, why a divorce?

225
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:17,865
We've been over this
a thousand times.

226
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,372
What do you mean,
i've changed?

227
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:25,074
What's changed about me?

228
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:28,611
Dorothy, i don't know
what you're driving at.

229
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:36,589
Hi, tim!

230
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:38,090
Well, chum,
what'll you have?

231
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,357
Don't you know me, tim?

232
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:42,626
I'm angie!
Angelo valentine, united states infantry.

233
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:46,363
A lot of fellas come
and go in here, buddy.

234
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,967
Yeah, i guess they do.

235
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:52,038
Have you seen
two other fellas today?

236
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,405
I wouldn't be doing
such a good business

237
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:56,407
if i hadn't seen
two fellas all morning.

238
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:56,944
Sure.

239
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,998
Should've known.
Number one sucker of all time.

240
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:29,778
Doug.
You're ted. Hey!

241
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,118
You haven't
changed much, doug,

242
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:36,853
except for
that brush.

243
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:38,988
Get a load
of that brush, will you, ted?

244
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:39,390
Ha ha ha!

245
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,291
Where'd you come
in from, doug?

246
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:42,159
Chicago.
How about you?

247
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,460
Schenectady.
Same old place.

248
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:45,195
How about you, ted?

249
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:46,129
I've been here
the whole time.

250
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,466
You have? I didn't
know you'd been here all this time.

251
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:51,901
Yeah. Well...

252
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:54,038
yeah! Well.

253
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:54,506
We're us!

254
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:56,941
Hey, tim!
Tim!

255
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,009
Tim, we made it!

256
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,712
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the rover boys.

257
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:03,315
He didn't even know me
when i first came in.

258
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:04,983
Tim, you said
we'd never make it, and here we are.

259
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:07,786
You got no faith,
that's what's the matter with you.

260
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:08,453
Come on, set 'em up.

261
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:10,355
Got to break open
a fresh bottle for this.

262
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:12,558
I don't think i could
handle a drink, ted.

263
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:12,893
What?

264
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,793
I'm not too fit
digestion-wise.

265
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:15,794
Little bit of
a nervous stomach.

266
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:17,864
Oh. Well, come
to think of it,

267
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:21,200
i haven't had a drink
at noon in a lot of years myself.

268
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:23,002
Maybe i could
handle one.

269
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:24,204
I'll take a couple
of these pills.

270
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:27,240
Ok by me. I'm game.
Boy, this is great.

271
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:28,575
Well, to us.

272
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:28,911
To us.

273
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:34,681
Cut that out, will you?
The sacroiliac.

274
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:36,718
Oh, i'm sorry.

275
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,386
If connie could
only see me now-

276
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:40,588
drinking in the middle
of the afternoon.

277
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:43,657
I got some pictures here
of connie and the kids.

278
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:44,593
Very nice.

279
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:46,662
You kept pretty
busy these 10 years.

280
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:49,564
Yeah. How about
you guys? You married?

281
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:50,866
Yes, i'm married.

282
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:51,533
Pictures of the kids?

283
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:52,834
No. We don't
have any children.

284
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:55,803
Well, i'll lend you
a couple of mine!

285
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,242
And how about you, ted?
You married?

286
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:02,378
No, thank you.
Well, let's have another drink.

287
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,082
Yeah. Let's have
another drink.

288
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,716
Boy, this is great.
Great.

289
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:09,119
You know what?
Let's drink to old bootsie.

290
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,454
Who?
Who's old bootsie?

291
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,390
You know. Don't you
remember? Bootsie.

292
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,358
That kid in our outfit
who was always tripping over everything.

293
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,560
From the south.
We always used to toast old bootsie.

294
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,699
Don't you remember?
It was good luck,

295
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,500
and then we always
used to laugh.

296
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:23,836
Why?

297
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,638
I don't know.

298
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,073
Sure.
Come on, doug. Old bootsie.

299
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,642
No. I couldn't
handle another one.

300
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,544
All right, angie.
Bottoms up.

301
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,946
Bottoms up.

302
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:36,215
Here you are, tim.

303
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:37,116
No, here.
Let me get this.

304
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:38,318
No. No, i'm
the host here.

305
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,952
This is
my hometown.

306
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:40,586
Hey, 50 bucks.

307
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,388
You're doing
all right, ted,

308
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:43,556
but i always
knew you would.

309
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:44,157
I'm doing swell.

310
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:46,760
I borrowed it
from my barber this morning.

311
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,628
It's strictly
temporary.

312
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:50,530
I'll be
in the chips tomorrow.

313
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,135
I got to call connie
and tell her about this.

314
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:56,070
She didn't believe
you guys would show up.

315
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:59,472
She's a great girl,
connie. Sometimes a little bit jealous.

316
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:01,876
Guess you know what
that's like, huh, doug?

317
00:24:01,877 --> 00:24:02,245
Oh, sure.

318
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,613
I'll tell you
what we'll do.

319
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:06,648
We'll have
a few more drinks here,

320
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:08,917
and we'll
go somewhere for lunch, huh?

321
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:09,219
Yeah.

322
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:10,220
Florio's.

323
00:24:10,286 --> 00:24:11,286
Florio's. Veal parmigiana.
Lasagne.

324
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:12,788
I couldn't handle
that heavy food.

325
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,923
I have to be
a little careful, restaurant-wise-

326
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:16,592
go where they know me.

327
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:19,529
Why don't i take
you two chaps to the turquoise?

328
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,331
The turquoise?
Whoo.

329
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:22,298
I'll handle it.

330
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,500
No. I can
handle it.

331
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:25,134
No. I wouldn't
think of it.

332
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:26,203
I'll just put it
on the expense account.

333
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:29,472
I'll charge
this whole day off as a business trip.

334
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,843
That's just swell.

335
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:44,922
Doug, you never did
get back to europe to paint, did you?

336
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:47,893
No. Career-wise, it
didn't seem practical,

337
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:50,028
but i've been creative
in the advertising line

338
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:53,464
with little miss mop-up
for klenzrite and jolio the gelatin man.

339
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:57,536
No. I don't miss
la vie boheme one bit.

340
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,039
Little miss mop-up.
You did that?

341
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,575
What do you know?

342
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,711
If you're ever up
schenectady way,

343
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,746
you have to drop in
at my place.

344
00:25:06,747 --> 00:25:08,982
Real red meat
at the cordon bleu.

345
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:09,449
At the what?

346
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,520
The cordon bleu.
That's the name of my hamburger joint.

347
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:15,288
Ha ha ha!
That's rich.

348
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:17,525
That is priceless.

349
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:18,159
What's so funny?

350
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,361
As far as names go,
it seems to me little miss mop-up

351
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,931
and jolio
the gelatin man

352
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,766
are pretty priceless
themselves.

353
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:25,434
Oh, well, l-

354
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:27,702
come on. Jolio
the gelatin man.

355
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:30,005
Your call to
schenectady, sir.

356
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:32,407
Gee, thanks.

357
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:37,846
Hello? Connie?
Hey, it's me.

358
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:41,617
I'm talking
to you from a table at the turquoise.

359
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:43,553
What a swanky dump.

360
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:46,123
What do you know?
They both showed up.

361
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:48,692
Oh, it's great.
Like old times.

362
00:25:48,693 --> 00:25:50,561
How are the kids?
Good.

363
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:53,564
How did johnny do
in the columbus day school pageant?

364
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:56,666
Oh? He forgot
"oh, columbus, we salute you"?

365
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:00,671
Went over that line
a thousand times with him.

366
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,243
Look, connie, i'll
call you back later.

367
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:06,912
Tell you when
i'm coming home.

368
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:09,713
Miss you, too.
Yeah. Good-bye.

369
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,787
Ted, how about you?

370
00:26:14,788 --> 00:26:16,789
Law school and
the political arena?

371
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,992
The midtown arena
is about the only arena i know.

372
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:21,461
Which reminds me-
i have to get up

373
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:23,930
to stillman's gym
later and look at my fighter.

374
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:25,599
Racketeers in
the fight game, huh?

375
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,567
Glad i'm in
a respectable business.

376
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:43,417
I shouldn't have come

377
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:46,453
i shouldn't have come

378
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:49,423
this thing's a mistake

379
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:52,727
an awful mistake

380
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,031
that guy's such a snob

381
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:59,101
and who is that hick?

382
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:02,137
Can these be the guys
i once thought

383
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:05,741
i could never live without?

384
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:09,379
Doug: Who do you think
will win the world series?

385
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,248
Both teams look
pretty good to me.

386
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:12,751
Yeah.

387
00:27:13,585 --> 00:27:13,885
Yeah.

388
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,886
May the best team win.

389
00:27:21,326 --> 00:27:24,094
This thing is a frost

390
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:27,130
i'd like to get lost

391
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:30,100
old pals are the bunk

392
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:33,238
this guy's a cheap punk

393
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:36,241
and that one's a heel

394
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,277
and i'm a schlemiel

395
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:42,381
can these be the guys
i once thought

396
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,985
i could never live without?

397
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:04,004
This thing's a bad dream

398
00:28:04,006 --> 00:28:06,208
why can't i just scream?

399
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:06,542
Aaaaah!

400
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:10,144
Oh, why did i fly

401
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:13,147
to new york from chi?

402
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,250
To drink scotch at noon

403
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:19,055
with a hick and a goon

404
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:22,091
can these be the guys
i once thought

405
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,429
i could never live without?

406
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,264
This guy is a punk,
a punk, a punk

407
00:28:27,265 --> 00:28:29,266
this guy is a snob,
a snob, a snob

408
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:30,867
this guy is a dope,
a hick, a square

409
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:32,837
i shouldn't have come,
i'm in despair

410
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,538
our dreams are dust
and down the drain

411
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,373
this thing is a bust,
and i'm insane

412
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:39,110
oh, why did
i come? Why am i here?

413
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:40,945
A hick
a square a snob

414
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:43,648
a punk a hick
a square a slob

415
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:45,917
a ha ha ha
ho ho ho ho

416
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:49,488
a hick, a square,
a snob, a punk

417
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:52,457
why did i come?
Why am i here?

418
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,627
Why?

419
00:28:56,131 --> 00:29:07,074
Good afternoon,
miss leighton.

420
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:09,608
This way, please.

421
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:14,280
Thank you, carl.

422
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:17,552
Thank you.

423
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,388
Scotch old-fashioned,
please, carl.

424
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:23,456
That's what i like.
An old-fashioned girl.

425
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:26,828
I'm an old-fashioned
boy, myself.

426
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:28,830
Here we are, gentlemen.

427
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:31,433
Salisbury steak medium
for you, sir.

428
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:31,834
Thank you.

429
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,204
Medium rare for you,
mr. Hallerton.

430
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:35,571
Thank you.

431
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:38,875
And well done
for you, sir.

432
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:39,242
Thank you.

433
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:44,247
Hey! You call this
a hamburger? For 4 bucks?

434
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:45,081
Angie, shh, please.

435
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:45,916
Come on, ted,
you taste it.

436
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,484
You know about horses.
I tell you this hamburger ran in the kentucky derby.

437
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:50,621
Forget it, angie.

438
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,088
Listen. If i served
stuff like this,

439
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:54,692
i'd be run out
of schenectady on the third rail.

440
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,693
Will you shut up?

441
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:56,260
What did you say?

442
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,929
I said be quiet.
This is very embarrassing.

443
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,096
Angie, don't act
like a yokel.

444
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,398
We're in a very
high-class place.

445
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,535
Didn't stop you
from trying to make a quick pickup, i noticed.

446
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:04,602
I've picked up
dames

447
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:05,937
in better places
than this.

448
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:06,438
I doubt that.

449
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,406
I don't think
either of you crumbs

450
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:08,874
could get in a place
like this without me.

451
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:09,708
Who's a crumb?

452
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:12,376
You are.
You cheap snob.

453
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:18,751
I'm sorry.
Me, too.

454
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:19,119
So am i.

455
00:30:21,222 --> 00:30:22,655
I guess
we've had it.

456
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:23,589
Yeah.
Guess so.

457
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,225
Waiter.
Check, please.

458
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:27,361
Man: Hey, hallerton.

459
00:30:27,362 --> 00:30:28,562
Well, well, well.

460
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:29,563
Oh, mr. Fielding.

461
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:31,432
I didn't know
you were in town.

462
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:32,066
Just for the day.

463
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:34,235
How's
the missis? Fine, thank you.

464
00:30:34,236 --> 00:30:37,136
Is she
with you? No, not this trip.

465
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:38,105
Oh, mr. Fielding,

466
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:38,940
these are
two friends of mine.

467
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:41,776
Mr. Valentine,
and this is mr. Riley.

468
00:30:41,777 --> 00:30:42,944
How do you do,
mr. Fielding?

469
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:43,811
We were in the war
together.

470
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:44,947
We're having
a little reunion.

471
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:46,181
Haven't seen each
other in 10 years.

472
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:49,518
Must be a lot of fun
getting together to talk about old times.

473
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,686
Mr. Fielding,
excuse me.

474
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:51,286
Oh, miss leighton.

475
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:53,021
I've been calling you
and couldn't reach you.

476
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:53,889
It's very important.

477
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,358
Miss leighton,
i want you to meet hallerton of chicago.

478
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,195
He's one of our executive
vice presidents out there.

479
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:02,330
He's responsible for
the miss mop-up campaign.

480
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,332
Oh, you're the one.

481
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,368
Miss leighton
is one of our best idea men.

482
00:31:06,504 --> 00:31:07,604
I should
say women.

483
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:08,438
You certainly should.

484
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:10,607
You know, she's
the program coordinator

485
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:12,643
on our biggest
klenzrite tv show-

486
00:31:12,644 --> 00:31:13,978
midnight
with madeline.

487
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:15,012
What do you know?

488
00:31:15,013 --> 00:31:17,648
Doug, aren't you
going to introduce us?

489
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:18,182
Oh, certainly.

490
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:21,285
Miss leighton, this is
mr. Valentine and mr. Riley.

491
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:22,989
Ted riley.

492
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:24,455
I suggest
we skip lunch

493
00:31:24,456 --> 00:31:26,992
and get right over
to madeline's rehearsal.

494
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:27,926
You know how she is.

495
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:28,593
Sweetie,
i can't.

496
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:31,330
I'm waiting here
for stamper and trasker.

497
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:32,999
And donner
and blitzen.

498
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,733
I'm afraid
we really better go.

499
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:35,101
All right.

500
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,804
Doug, why don't
you come along and have a look-see?

501
00:31:37,805 --> 00:31:39,839
We're
rehearsing over at the fontainebleau.

502
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,140
I'd like
that very much.

503
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:42,475
Well, so long, fellas.

504
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:43,909
Bring your
friends along.

505
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,211
No!

506
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:45,645
I mean, we're
just about through here lunch-wise,

507
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:48,414
and i'm sure
they're very busy appointment-wise.

508
00:31:48,415 --> 00:31:49,683
Not at all, doug.
We'd love to come along.

509
00:31:49,684 --> 00:31:52,986
I've got about an hour
to kill before i have to be at stillman's gym.

510
00:31:52,987 --> 00:31:56,656
You see, i own a plug-ugly
who's going to be engaged fisticuffs-wise tonight,

511
00:31:57,425 --> 00:32:00,794
and i have to stop by
and put the lead weights in his gloves

512
00:32:00,996 --> 00:32:03,532
and wise him up
wise-wise.

513
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,367
Sure. Sure.
Come along.

514
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:05,900
You, too, mr. -

515
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,869
i'd sure like
to meet madeline in the flesh-

516
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,671
maybe get her
autograph to take home.

517
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:12,940
Yes, you could
hang it on the wall of your hot dog stand.

518
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:13,843
Hamburgers.

519
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:17,178
Hamburgers, of course.
How crude of you, douglas. Shall we go?

520
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:23,186
Man: Say, fielding?

521
00:32:23,187 --> 00:32:25,755
Oh, stamper
and trasker.

522
00:32:25,756 --> 00:32:29,025
Yes. We're just
on our way over to the fontainebleau,

523
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:30,561
and this is-

524
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:31,595
the fontainebleau,
please.

525
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:33,263
7 of us couldn't
fit in one cab.

526
00:32:33,264 --> 00:32:33,763
Of all the-

527
00:32:33,764 --> 00:32:36,765
now, don't get mad.
I had a crazy notion

528
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:39,370
you and i should get
better acquainted.

529
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:39,671
I see.

530
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:42,240
Besides, i think
you're about

531
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:45,509
the prettiest
program coordinator i've ever seen.

532
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:48,947
You know, a fella's
not safe

533
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:51,683
alone in a cab
with a girl these days.

534
00:32:51,684 --> 00:32:52,051
All right.

535
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,992
Ok. Satisfied?
I just couldn't face the boredom

536
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:03,362
of fighting you off
for 10 blocks.

537
00:33:03,363 --> 00:33:05,665
It's the simplest
method, my own invention.

538
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,267
Remove the initiative
from the brute male,

539
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:08,635
and he'll retire
in confusion.

540
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:12,004
Now, while you
retire in confusion, i'll do a little work.

541
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,843
What kind of
a screwball are you?

542
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:17,912
To save you the strain
of trying to understand me,

543
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,880
i'll give you
the salient facts.

544
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,983
Graduate of barnard,
summa cum laude, career girl.

545
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,621
I'm fairly pretty,
which is a nuisance.

546
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:26,788
I attract a lot of men
at first,

547
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:28,790
but i can always
find a way of getting rid of them,

548
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,160
and then everybody's
happy all around.

549
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:34,095
In short, i can
always scare them off.

550
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:37,667
I don't scare easy.

551
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:38,101
No?
No.

552
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:40,335
Did you ever hear
of planck,

553
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:42,372
who discovered
the quantum theory in 1895?

554
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:44,174
Without that
and maxwell's field theory,

555
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:46,342
there never
would have been a theory of relativity.

556
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:48,445
And did you ever hear
of magadization,

557
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:49,345
the pre-medieval
musical system

558
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:52,182
of voices singing
or playing octaves apart?

559
00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:53,550
And did you-
time.

560
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:56,453
Did you ever hear
of kid mariacchi?

561
00:33:56,655 --> 00:33:59,157
Kid mariacchi?
Yeah.

562
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:01,159
Middleweight.
Fighting tonight.

563
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,961
5 foot 9,
165.

564
00:34:04,497 --> 00:34:07,263
39,
42.

565
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,434
8 straight knockouts
in a row.

566
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:12,403
Good chance of flattening
helding tonight.

567
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:14,406
You're
flattening me right now.

568
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:16,575
It's just a trick.
It doesn't mean anything.

569
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:19,044
It has nothing
to do with intelligence,

570
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:21,481
but men do find it
an awful bore.

571
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:24,583
And i'll tell
you something. I don't care.

572
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:28,053
Because as shakespeare
said in the tempest, act 2, scene 7:

573
00:34:28,088 --> 00:34:31,357
"Most friendship
is feigning, most loving mere folly."

574
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:38,531
"Most friendship
is feigning, most loving mere folly."

575
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:42,504
Well, in some ways,
you and me

576
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:44,605
and shakespeare
see eye to eye.

577
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:47,441
I got my diploma
this afternoon.

578
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,711
You and your
war buddies?

579
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,712
Yeah. You saw it.

580
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,881
We met at our old
wartime hangout,

581
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,083
little place called
tim's bar.

582
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:58,320
We expected to pick
up where we left off 10 years ago.

583
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,358
What a laugh.

584
00:35:07,598 --> 00:35:10,200
Never mind.
It's on klenzrite.

585
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:12,235
See? You didn't
bother me

586
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,605
in the least
on the rest of the trip.

587
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:15,238
My own
invention.

588
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,741
That invention's
going to explode in your face someday, einstein.

589
00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:21,579
Well, so long.

590
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,814
Aren't you going
to say good-bye to your pals?

591
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:27,218
We said good-bye
a long time ago.

592
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:29,421
But don't let
that worry you. You'll see me again.

593
00:35:29,422 --> 00:35:33,057
Just take the male
initiative and pick me up at stillman's gym about 4:00.

594
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:34,894
I wouldn't
bet on that.

595
00:35:34,895 --> 00:35:38,296
You know, there's
a lot of things you shouldn't bet on.

596
00:35:38,932 --> 00:35:40,232
Like that shakespeare
quote, for instance.

597
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:44,168
It ain't the tempest act 2,
scene 7. it's as you like it act 2, scene 7.

598
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,842
"Hey-ho, sing hey-ho
unto the green holly,

599
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:53,880
most friendship is feigning,
most loving, mere folly."

600
00:35:56,951 --> 00:36:00,053
Oh, i'm around
stillman's all the time.

601
00:36:10,766 --> 00:36:13,634
Man: Quiet. Quiet, please.
Rehearsal.

602
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,773
Klenzrite presents...

603
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:22,110
midnight with madeline,
starring...

604
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:24,448
madeline!

605
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:27,449
Music is better than words

606
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,053
you break the spell
when you start to speak

607
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,624
that technique is all wrong

608
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,361
just forget about words
and sing her a song

609
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:45,001
music was made for romance

610
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:48,405
love and a sweet song
go hand in glove

611
00:36:49,175 --> 00:36:51,909
every lover knows this

612
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:55,613
and the sweeter the song,
the sweeter the kiss

613
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,354
when you're
without love, you cry

614
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:05,190
and your song is the blues

615
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:09,028
but when you've
got love, you're high

616
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,998
and your song
is a gay refrain

617
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:16,135
a happy strain
that sings out the news

618
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:21,241
don't let the night
go to waste

619
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:25,145
looking for ways
to say i love you

620
00:37:25,614 --> 00:37:28,482
take your cue from the birds

621
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:30,019
music

622
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:34,355
music is better

623
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,660
music is better than words

624
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,606
applause, applause,
applause.

625
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:51,575
And now, you dear
ladies and gentlemen,

626
00:37:51,576 --> 00:37:54,944
we come to the part
of the program which is always my favorite

627
00:37:55,113 --> 00:37:57,314
because it
means something.

628
00:37:57,315 --> 00:38:00,317
Because it means
this big, cold canyon

629
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:03,220
we call new york
really has a heart,

630
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:05,590
and if you
listen very hard,

631
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:07,659
you can hear it throb.

632
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,998
The throb of manhattan.

633
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:16,669
Last week we brought you
thomas w. Jackwood,

634
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,204
reunited right here with
his wife and children after 30 years in jail.

635
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:23,943
Tonight again,
our surprise guest

636
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:26,879
or guests are
somewhere in this room.

637
00:38:27,414 --> 00:38:27,782
Spotlight.

638
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:33,218
Could it be you?

639
00:38:33,454 --> 00:38:36,257
Yes. Yes, it's you,
mr. Kebbner.

640
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:39,625
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is donald w. Kebbner of the bronx-

641
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,263
one of the last army
of little gray men

642
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:45,599
struggling along
from day to day gallantly making ends meet.

643
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:49,037
Everyone has a dream,
ladies and gentlemen.

644
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:50,272
Such a one is mr. Kebbner-

645
00:38:50,273 --> 00:38:53,908
a simple man with a dream
of visiting the orient in its unparalleled splendor,

646
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:58,846
but all his life he has
spent in his candy store on superior avenue,

647
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:02,118
where he has brought
the orient to him

648
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,552
by constructing,
for 16 years,

649
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:06,589
a complete table-sized
model of the taj mahal

650
00:39:07,658 --> 00:39:10,659
executed entirely
in chewing-gum wrappers.

651
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:16,866
No. No. No. No!
I will not have this on my show!

652
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,138
It's terrible!

653
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:23,174
Jackie, what are you
trying to do, ruin me?

654
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:26,676
Madeline, it's
the best we could do as a last-minute substitute.

655
00:39:26,846 --> 00:39:27,746
We had something
so wonderful-

656
00:39:27,747 --> 00:39:31,315
a totally reformed drunkard
who was going to tell us his inspiring story.

657
00:39:32,485 --> 00:39:33,252
Yes, but
he got drunk.

658
00:39:33,253 --> 00:39:35,654
You geniuses will
just have to put your heads together.

659
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:38,023
I won't do the show tonight.
I just won't go on.

660
00:39:38,024 --> 00:39:41,326
I want 40 million people
to sit home and cry and love me.

661
00:39:41,995 --> 00:39:45,030
Sam, get me a club
sandwich, a double order of french fries,

662
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:46,999
and two cans of beer.
Make it 3!

663
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,867
Madeline, please,
your diet...

664
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:50,536
you know what happens
to your figure when you start eating.

665
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:52,706
Who cares about my
diet or my figure?

666
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:54,107
I'm unhappy,
and i want to eat.

667
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:56,410
Here's a nice
pimento cheese sandwich.

668
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,379
I don't want
a pimento cheese sandwich.

669
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,648
Sweetie, it took you
so long to take off those 20 pounds.

670
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:04,118
You mustn't give up
the battle of the bulge.

671
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:06,354
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

672
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:07,522
Look who's talking,
fatso.

673
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:08,556
You didn't get
that corporation

674
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:10,259
on lettuce
and tomato sandwiches.

675
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,892
Yeah, but, sweetie,

676
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:13,395
nobody pays to look
at me in an evening gown.

677
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:16,364
Who cares? I'm not
going on tonight!

678
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,199
Madeline,
wait a minute.

679
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,067
This chewing-gum
man has no sympathy!

680
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:23,638
Look, sweetie.
You got to lay off those fat sandwiches.

681
00:40:24,474 --> 00:40:25,741
Now calm down,
everybody.

682
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:28,477
I think i've got
the spot solved for tonight.

683
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:29,613
It's the foulest
notion i've had yet,

684
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:32,549
but after all,
it's for the glory of klenzrite.

685
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,684
The show must go on.

686
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:34,151
What is it?

687
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:35,886
It's human. It's
up to the minute.

688
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:38,455
It's guaranteed to
tear your guts out!

689
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:38,757
Yes?

690
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:40,124
It will take
coordination-

691
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,293
everybody pitching
in, even you.

692
00:40:42,294 --> 00:40:43,127
Darling, what is it?

693
00:40:43,128 --> 00:40:45,963
The 3 war buddies.
They met today for the first time

694
00:40:45,964 --> 00:40:47,732
in 10 years at their
old hangout,

695
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:48,901
a little place
called tim's bar.

696
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:52,369
You mean hallerton
and what's his name and what's his name?

697
00:40:53,907 --> 00:40:56,342
Right.
And tonight, much to their surprise,

698
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:57,410
they will meet
again at 11:00

699
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,812
and be interviewed
by madeline on throb of manhattan.

700
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,614
Oh! It's beautiful!
Beautiful!

701
00:41:02,615 --> 00:41:05,918
Our boys and me
and the whole nation watching and weeping.

702
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:09,489
That's very good. You
think we ought to talk to hallerton about this?

703
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,924
No. This has to be
a surprise show.

704
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:13,126
Something tells me
these 3 old pals

705
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:14,294
wouldn't want
to do this.

706
00:41:14,295 --> 00:41:15,162
You just take care
of hallerton

707
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:16,764
and get him
to the theater by 11:00.

708
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,999
And, madeline,
you take care of mr. Schenectady.

709
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,401
How am i going
to take care of mr. -

710
00:41:20,402 --> 00:41:21,369
don't let him
out of your sight.

711
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,371
Take him anyplace
he wants to go.

712
00:41:23,372 --> 00:41:23,739
To dinner?

713
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:24,805
Yes. Eat
your head off.

714
00:41:24,806 --> 00:41:28,075
Now, let's see,
that's hallerton and valentine,

715
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,145
and i guess
i'll have to be

716
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:33,848
responsible
for number 3.

717
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:40,823
Nashby: Get that.

718
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:42,157
Ok, that's enough.

719
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:43,393
Hey, what's
eating you?

720
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:44,026
Huh? Oh. Nothing.

721
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:45,895
I was just thinking
about the fight.

722
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:46,197
Ted.

723
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,497
Thanks, nashby.
So long.

724
00:41:47,498 --> 00:41:48,365
You mad at me
about something?

725
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:50,500
What have i got
to be mad at you about?

726
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:51,869
Man: Riley.
Someone to see you.

727
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:55,337
Someone about 6 foot 4
with a broken nose and an i.o.u. In his hand?

728
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:58,941
No. About 5 foot 5,
neat little nose, and "i love you" in her eyes.

729
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:03,446
Hey, lady.
Come in.

730
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:05,918
Hello.

731
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:23,067
Well, well, well.
Right on the dot.

732
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:24,670
Are you always
this prompt?

733
00:42:24,671 --> 00:42:26,439
Yes. I'm just
a machine.

734
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,441
Good. I love
to tinker with machinery.

735
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,344
I had a couple
of hours off,

736
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:32,712
and i remembered
your kind invitation.

737
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:33,613
I thought i'd
drop in and see

738
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:36,949
all you colorful folk
of the world of fisticuffs in action.

739
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:39,020
Sort of research, huh?

740
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:40,087
In a manner
of speaking.

741
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:42,256
You're just in time
for a nice hot cup

742
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:43,157
of rubbing alcohol
and crumpets.

743
00:42:43,158 --> 00:42:46,593
Miss leighton, this is,
as if you didn't know, kid mariacchi.

744
00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:48,596
How do you do?
Hello.

745
00:42:48,597 --> 00:42:51,731
Ok, kid, get dressed.
You'll be great tonight.

746
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:53,569
And lefty louie.

747
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:53,937
Delighted.

748
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:56,237
Butch mcsween.

749
00:42:56,238 --> 00:42:56,606
Charmed.

750
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:58,407
Boys, miss leighton.

751
00:42:58,408 --> 00:42:59,208
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.

752
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,243
Miss leighton is here
to do some research.

753
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:02,144
She says
she wants to see

754
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:05,380
the colorful folk
of the world of fisticuffs in action.

755
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,584
I'm sure you'll oblige.

756
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,585
Mariacchi: Hey, ted.

757
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,986
Mr. Riley,
i'll be delighted

758
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,788
to escort
miss leighton until your return.

759
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,756
Louie, you're
a gentleman and a scholar.

760
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,126
It's a pleasure.
I'll be right back.

761
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,962
Fellow colleagues,
do your stuff.

762
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:19,431
Yeah!

763
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,099
Look at me.
I'm shadow boxing.

764
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,501
He's got
a glass jaw.

765
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:26,370
This is headgear.
It protects me.

766
00:43:26,572 --> 00:43:27,739
Sucks wind
in the third round.

767
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,875
Boxer:
1, 2, button my shoe, 3, 4, shut the door.

768
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:31,943
Louie:
Good counter-puncher.

769
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:34,945
Well, charming little
place you have here.

770
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:38,349
Charming little place?
Lady, this is an institution.

771
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,786
It's been like
a mother to us

772
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,287
and to our
fathers before us.

773
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:45,224
These old walls
are as steeped in tradition

774
00:43:45,225 --> 00:43:48,093
as the ivy-covered
walls of harvard.

775
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,067
Over on new york's
eighth avenue

776
00:43:57,672 --> 00:44:00,607
stands a building
gray and grim

777
00:44:03,578 --> 00:44:06,546
it's the home
of broken noses

778
00:44:09,284 --> 00:44:12,286
our alma mater,
stillman's gym

779
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,226
though the plastered
walls are peeling

780
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:25,167
and it looks a mess to some

781
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:32,041
we point with pride to that
spot on the northwest side

782
00:44:37,382 --> 00:44:37,848
mmm

Sock them with a right hook.

853
00:48:17,788 --> 00:48:19,121
Boxers: Baby,

855
00:48:21,324 --> 00:48:23,393
you're the chick with a kick
like a rodeo

856
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:26,429
honeybunch,
you got the punch that lays me low

857
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,464
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, boing

00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:57,262
I see you made
quite a hit with the fellas.

865
00:48:57,263 --> 00:48:58,964
Thanks. If i'm staying
with you for dinner,

866
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:02,199
i have some calls
to make-my office, for instance.

867
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:02,702
Dinner?

868
00:49:03,036 --> 00:49:03,937
Don't you
want me to?

869
00:49:03,938 --> 00:49:06,773
Look, i hate to curb
your male initiative,

870
00:49:06,774 --> 00:49:09,008
but a guy likes to ask
once in a while.

871
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:11,177
Well, then ask me.

872
00:49:11,178 --> 00:49:13,079
Miss leighton,
would you do me the honor-

873
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,514
yes. Come on.

874
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:21,288
Look,
it'll have to be a quick dinner.

875
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:22,656
I got the fight
tonight, you know.

876
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:25,558
Oh. I'll go
with you to the fight.

877
00:49:34,837 --> 00:49:37,638
Hello, roy.

878
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:39,408
And fielding? Fine.

879
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,344
Now, what about the costumes
for the singing girls?

880
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:45,313
Have we any cute
military outfits around?

881
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:46,983
Oh. Well, listen.

882
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:50,652
Right after the rehearsal,
i'll meet the girls at the grove costume company.

883
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,993
What do you say, sport?

884
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:58,394
Hiya, rocky.

885
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:00,832
Hi.

886
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,667
Hi.

887
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:07,104
You're pretty smart,
sport.

888
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:10,173
I mean, you're cagey,
you know what i mean?

889
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,243
No. What do you mean?

890
00:50:12,244 --> 00:50:15,679
I mean, you're so cagey,
you won't even discuss it with me,

891
00:50:17,216 --> 00:50:18,784
what's in on it.

892
00:50:18,785 --> 00:50:21,185
In on what?

893
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:21,555
On it.

894
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:24,723
Oh, on, uh...

895
00:50:24,724 --> 00:50:25,091
the fix.

896
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,861
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The fix.

897
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:32,031
Sure. You don't have to
worry about nothing, ted.

898
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,167
Charlie culloran
set it up great.

899
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:36,837
Charlie culloran's
pretty good at that sort of thing.

900
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:38,305
Oh, yeah.
We been rehearsing.

901
00:50:38,306 --> 00:50:40,041
We got it down
perfect.

902
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,208
You and, uh...

903
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:42,910
me and marl-

904
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:45,812
me and mariacchi.

905
00:50:47,248 --> 00:50:48,916
Look, rocky,
don't you think

906
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:52,054
you ought to run
over it once again just to make sure?

907
00:50:52,055 --> 00:50:54,621
No. I got it down pat.

908
00:50:54,924 --> 00:50:58,125
Uh, in the fourth round,
me and the kid, we come out,

909
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:00,596
and we dance around
a little bit. You know.

910
00:51:00,597 --> 00:51:03,265
And all of a sudden,
i throw a beautiful left hook.

911
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:05,068
Catches the kid
right on the button.

912
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:07,636
He does a neat
half gainer into the canvas

913
00:51:07,637 --> 00:51:10,572
and swims the length
of the ring. Huh?

914
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:12,809
Sounds prettier
than the russian ballet.

915
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:16,078
Well, it'll bring us
maybe not fame, but fortune.

916
00:51:19,683 --> 00:51:21,785
Listen, rocky,
play it cagey, will you?

917
00:51:21,786 --> 00:51:23,621
I mean, don't go around
shooting your mouth off

918
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,324
to somebody who might
not be in on the fix.

919
00:51:26,325 --> 00:51:29,192
That would be,
shall we say, silly?

920
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:33,097
What-what do you
take me for?

921
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:37,067
I'm... sheesh.

922
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:42,340
Uh, i'll see you
at charlie culloran's after the fix-

923
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:47,245
i mean, the fight.

924
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:54,988
Sorry. I need the phone.

925
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:56,623
I'll call you back.

926
00:51:56,624 --> 00:51:57,691
Come on. Come on.

927
00:51:57,692 --> 00:51:58,291
Well, really!

928
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:00,226
Get me a load
of dimes. Who do you think-

929
00:52:00,227 --> 00:52:00,629
hurry up!

930
00:52:09,672 --> 00:52:11,005
Well, that's that.

931
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:12,239
You've been
on that phone for years.

932
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,076
I'm sorry, baby.
Last-minute changes, urgent business,

933
00:52:15,077 --> 00:52:16,244
but now we'll
concentrate on you.

934
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:17,679
We'll go to some
nice quiet place-

935
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,148
listen, there's
something i have to do.

936
00:52:19,149 --> 00:52:20,983
I must go
to the grove costume company

937
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:23,318
and see about some changes
for tonight's show.

938
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:24,520
Do you mind coming along?

939
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:27,221
What have i got
to lose?

940
00:52:27,257 --> 00:52:28,491
Oh, what a day.

941
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:31,626
The end of old
friendship's beautiful dream,

942
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:34,030
and now a frame-up.
Taxi!

943
00:52:34,031 --> 00:52:34,364
What?

944
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,400
They're trying to
pull a fast one on me,

945
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:38,168
but i outsmarted
them.

946
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:38,436
Who?

947
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:39,869
I just found out

948
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,705
that sweet kid
you met inside- mariacchl-

949
00:52:41,706 --> 00:52:43,174
is taking
a dive tonight.

950
00:52:43,175 --> 00:52:44,875
What?
Yeah. The fight's fixed.

951
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:46,744
A big fat
combine behind it.

952
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:48,413
Oh, that's awful.

953
00:52:48,414 --> 00:52:48,747
Taxi!

954
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:50,381
Is that what
you were phoning about?

955
00:52:50,382 --> 00:52:53,085
Did you tip off
the boxing commission?

956
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,886
Did i tip off-

957
00:52:54,887 --> 00:52:56,855
you think
i want to get my head bashed in

958
00:52:56,856 --> 00:52:58,490
in a dark alley
some night?

959
00:52:58,491 --> 00:52:59,424
Oh, no.
I played dumb.

960
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:02,627
Took a lot of doing,
but i managed to get all my bets

961
00:53:02,895 --> 00:53:04,029
switched
to rocky helding.

962
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:06,432
I should make
a pile of dough out of it.

963
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:06,834
Hey, taxi!

964
00:53:08,068 --> 00:53:08,368
Oh.

965
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:13,973
Situation-wise
and saturation-wise,

966
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:16,309
i think this fiscal
year is going to top them all.

967
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,411
What do you think,
hallerton?

968
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:18,779
What wise?

969
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,247
I said
situation-wise.

970
00:53:20,248 --> 00:53:22,216
Excuse me.
I thought you said saturation-wise.

971
00:53:22,217 --> 00:53:25,351
I did. I said
situation-wise and saturation-wise.

972
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,988
Definitely.
Mr. Fielding, i've got to get home.

973
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:29,757
I want to see dorothy.
I'm just beginning to see-

974
00:53:29,758 --> 00:53:31,325
nonsense. You can't
leave now.

975
00:53:31,326 --> 00:53:33,427
You've got to stay
and see that program tonight,

976
00:53:33,428 --> 00:53:35,631
and celia's expecting you
for dinner.

977
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:36,431
Trasker,
where were we?

978
00:53:36,432 --> 00:53:38,433
Trasker: Sales-resistance-wise
and competition-wise,

979
00:53:38,434 --> 00:53:41,303
we have nosed out
every other brand from coast to coast.

980
00:53:41,304 --> 00:53:43,572
That's consumer-wise
and housewife-wise.

981
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:45,241
Fielding: But soft-spot-wise
and danger-wise,

982
00:53:45,242 --> 00:53:48,843
we've got to keep our eyes
on november, december, january, and february.

983
00:53:48,945 --> 00:53:51,414
All: I think
this fiscal year is going to top them all.

984
00:53:51,415 --> 00:53:53,616
And sales-resistance-wise
and competition-wise,

985
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:56,319
we've nosed out every
other brand from coast to coast.

986
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,454
But situation-wise
and saturation-wise,

987
00:53:58,455 --> 00:54:00,691
i think this fiscal year
is going to top them all.

988
00:54:00,692 --> 00:54:03,761
And sales-resistance-wise
and competition-wise...

989
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:04,828
we've got to keep
our eye on...

990
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:06,597
we've got to
keep our eye on...

991
00:54:06,598 --> 00:54:07,464
keep our eye on...

992
00:54:07,465 --> 00:54:10,366
november, december,
january, february,

993
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:13,037
january, february,
january, february...

994
00:54:13,038 --> 00:54:16,106
march, march, march,
april, may, june

995
00:54:16,475 --> 00:54:19,210
june, june, june...

996
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:25,083
oh, excuse me.
I have a little bit of a headache.

997
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,289
Pardon me.
I'll just step outside for a minute.

998
00:54:30,557 --> 00:54:33,092
I'll be here.

999
00:54:50,178 --> 00:54:51,412
Ok, madeline,
that's all.

1000
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,514
Girls, over to
grove's costume.

1001
00:54:53,515 --> 00:54:56,151
Oh, schenectady!
Meet you in the lobby

1002
00:54:56,152 --> 00:54:57,485
as soon
as i change.

1003
00:54:57,486 --> 00:55:00,589
Don't forget,
you're taking me to dinner.

1004
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,991
I'll be there.
Well, bye, girls.

1005
00:55:02,992 --> 00:55:05,061
Thanks a lot
for showing me everything...

1006
00:55:05,062 --> 00:55:06,329
and everything.

1007
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:06,929
You're welcome.

1008
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,064
Can't wait to see
the show tonight

1009
00:55:08,065 --> 00:55:09,198
and watch
donald kebbner's face

1010
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:11,367
when he finds
he's a surprise guest.

1011
00:55:11,368 --> 00:55:14,270
Boy, they really
keep it secret, don't they?

1012
00:55:14,271 --> 00:55:16,938
That's the whole fun.

1013
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,742
Hey, look at that.

1014
00:55:18,743 --> 00:55:20,778
I always dreamed
of having things like that

1015
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:22,545
in my restaurant
in schenectady.

1016
00:55:22,546 --> 00:55:25,115
Do you own
a place like this?

1017
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:28,017
Well, it's not exactly
like this.

1018
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,421
It's only, uh...
it's more modern.

1019
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:32,124
Oh. Bye.

1020
00:55:33,225 --> 00:55:33,492
Bye.

1021
00:55:56,217 --> 00:55:56,917
Man: Oh,
there you are.

1022
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,251
It's late.
Come on, girls. Line up.

1023
00:55:58,252 --> 00:56:01,555
Jackie: I know, max.
I'm terribly sorry. Sorry, girls.

1024
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:03,056
Oh, max,
the hats are all wrong.

1025
00:56:03,057 --> 00:56:05,759
It's supposed to
be america, not mauritania.

1026
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,261
We'll have to do
something about them.

1027
00:56:07,262 --> 00:56:09,363
Let me see.
Get me those little overseas caps,

1028
00:56:09,364 --> 00:56:12,465
number 9764-j
in your catalog. Come on, girls.

1029
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,336
Ok, girls,
follow me.

1030
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,103
I'll be
right back, ted.

1031
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:38,260
When the time has come
for parting

1032
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:43,933
and the marching
music ends

1033
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:49,639
no matter where
our lives may lead us

1034
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:56,546
we'll be friends
until we die

1035
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:05,923
once upon a time,
i had two friends

1036
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:23,042
once upon a time

1037
00:57:23,378 --> 00:57:26,479
i thought
that friendship never ends

1038
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,395
once i had
a dream

1039
00:57:41,096 --> 00:57:43,664
what a joke

1040
00:57:46,202 --> 00:57:49,004
all: Gone is that dream

1041
00:57:50,607 --> 00:57:53,207
up in smoke

1042
00:59:18,736 --> 00:59:21,537
all: Once i had a dream

1043
00:59:22,607 --> 00:59:25,174
what a joke

1044
00:59:27,211 --> 00:59:29,912
gone is that dream

1045
00:59:31,883 --> 00:59:34,451
up in smoke

1046
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:39,624
gone is that dream

1047
00:59:42,728 --> 00:59:43,163
up

1048
00:59:46,066 --> 00:59:46,499
in

1049
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:50,336
smoke

1050
00:59:59,580 --> 00:59:59,881
ted.

1051
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:04,950
Ted, shall we go?

1052
01:00:06,588 --> 01:00:08,089
Look, lady,
you're excused.

1053
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:11,059
You don't have to
hang around with me all evening.

1054
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,327
I wish i didn't
have to hang around with myself.

1055
01:00:13,328 --> 01:00:16,431
Jackie: But, ted,
we were going to have dinner and go to the fights.

1056
01:00:16,432 --> 01:00:19,066
Don't you remember?

1057
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,405
I don't get you.

1058
01:00:23,406 --> 01:00:26,008
First it was
strictly no dice,

1059
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:29,077
for which i can
hardly blame you, and now-

1060
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:31,414
i don't figure
a broad like you.

1061
01:00:31,415 --> 01:00:34,649
I don't get you.
You talk like a mug, or you try to,

1062
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:39,255
but obviously-
well, that shakespeare quote.

1063
01:00:39,256 --> 01:00:42,592
Oh, no. I used to
have quite a fund of useless information.

1064
01:00:43,595 --> 01:00:44,794
Just ask angie and doug.

1065
01:00:44,795 --> 01:00:46,630
I don't have to
ask angie and doug.

1066
01:00:46,631 --> 01:00:48,966
You know something?
Those two used to think

1067
01:00:48,967 --> 01:00:51,969
i was greater
than babe ruth, justice holmes,

1068
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,638
and dick tracy
rolled into one.

1069
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:56,906
What did they think
you were going to turn out to be?

1070
01:00:57,176 --> 01:01:00,044
Oh, nothing much,
just a great man.

1071
01:01:00,747 --> 01:01:03,848
I have
a sneaking feeling i've let them down

1072
01:01:04,651 --> 01:01:06,151
just a wee bit.

1073
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:08,988
If they knew
about my, shall we say,

1074
01:01:08,989 --> 01:01:11,789
helpful attitude
toward this fix,

1075
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:14,660
the boys would be
real proud of me.

1076
01:01:15,028 --> 01:01:17,130
Don't you think so?

1077
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,166
Don't look for
any sermons from me.

1078
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:22,168
I've been involved
in some fixes myself.

1079
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:26,239
I suppose everybody's
in some racket or other.

1080
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:29,576
Say, what is this
tough-woman-of-the-world pose of yours?

1081
01:01:31,045 --> 01:01:34,181
What's your problem?
Some man done you wrong?

1082
01:01:34,216 --> 01:01:36,317
Oh, really.

1083
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:39,386
No. You'd never let
anyone get near enough.

1084
01:01:41,424 --> 01:01:43,892
You think you know
all the answers.

1085
01:01:43,893 --> 01:01:46,695
You take
the initiative. You-

1086
01:01:46,696 --> 01:01:50,165
actually, you're just
plain inhibited. That's your problem.

1087
01:01:50,267 --> 01:01:50,567
Look.

1088
01:01:50,867 --> 01:01:54,003
Don't give me
any two-bit snap psychoanalysis.

1089
01:01:54,004 --> 01:01:54,837
Anyone can do it.

1090
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:58,041
10 years ago, fresh out of the army,

1091
01:01:58,042 --> 01:01:59,843
you were going to
amount to something,

1092
01:01:59,844 --> 01:02:01,077
but you had
a disappointment.

1093
01:02:01,078 --> 01:02:04,314
I don't know if
it was a small blond one or a tall dark one,

1094
01:02:04,315 --> 01:02:07,285
but ever since then,
you've been taking it out on the world

1095
01:02:07,286 --> 01:02:08,219
and yourself.

1096
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:11,054
That'll be 25 cents,
please.

1097
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:17,494
That was no
snap analysis, lady. That was my life.

1098
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:21,034
I'm sorry.

1099
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,868
Nah,
that's all right.

1100
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:24,136
You were terrific,
doc.

1101
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:26,938
You hit it
square on the hose.

1102
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:31,242
Speaking of
snap analysis,

1103
01:02:31,245 --> 01:02:33,346
i owe you 25 cents.

1104
01:02:33,347 --> 01:02:33,613
Hmm?

1105
01:02:35,082 --> 01:02:38,150
You hit it
square on the nose about me, doc.

1106
01:02:45,593 --> 01:02:47,228
Sorry. Got to lock up.

1107
01:02:47,229 --> 01:02:49,830
Oh. We were just going.

1108
01:02:53,935 --> 01:02:56,737
Here. Go get yourself
analyzed.

1109
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:05,212
The chicago concert
season sounds just divine.

1110
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,149
Mrs. Hallerton and i

1111
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,517
have subscription
tickets to everything,

1112
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,286
but she always
has to go with her cousin minnie

1113
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:13,588
because old fatso
over there keeps me working too long.

1114
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:16,057
Who? Ha ha ha!

1115
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:19,429
How is dear
mrs. Hallerton?

1116
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:22,266
How should i know?
I'm married to her.

1117
01:03:22,267 --> 01:03:24,735
Does she still have
those awful headaches?

1118
01:03:24,736 --> 01:03:27,037
Yeah, and she's
tried everything-

1119
01:03:27,038 --> 01:03:29,607
pills, analysis,
astrology, witchcraft.

1120
01:03:29,608 --> 01:03:32,842
Nothing helps.
It's very simple- she's dying.

1121
01:03:33,145 --> 01:03:35,313
I'm boring her
to death.

1122
01:03:35,314 --> 01:03:35,680
Ha ha ha!

1123
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:37,148
She has a certain
look when she's with me.

1124
01:03:37,149 --> 01:03:40,417
It's a combination
of boredom, disgust, and pity.

1125
01:03:40,887 --> 01:03:44,187
I saw that same look
on ted and angie's faces today.

1126
01:03:44,624 --> 01:03:47,559
You know who's
looking at me right now

1127
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,028
with that same look?

1128
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,362
Not me?

1129
01:03:50,096 --> 01:03:52,798
No, not you,
4 eyes. Me.

1130
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:56,034
Hey, garcon! Hey!

1131
01:03:57,204 --> 01:04:00,639
Boy, i wouldn't have
any more of those if i were you, doug.

1132
01:04:02,376 --> 01:04:05,444
And i sneaked
5 on the side. That makes 8.

1133
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:05,980
Hey, you!

1134
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:09,683
Fielding: You've got
to stay in shape tonight, my boy.

1135
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:12,420
You're coming
to madeline's program, you know.

1136
01:04:12,421 --> 01:04:15,656
Do i have to witness
that maudlin, disgusting junk-

1137
01:04:16,024 --> 01:04:19,526
see some poor, helpless
surprised guest make an idiot of themself?

1138
01:04:21,364 --> 01:04:22,497
Well... ha ha ha!

1139
01:04:22,498 --> 01:04:25,600
There must be
some more dignified way to sell klenzrite-

1140
01:04:25,601 --> 01:04:28,903
like you taking a bath
stark-naked in macy's window.

1141
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:32,708
Well, why don't you
fire me?

1142
01:04:32,709 --> 01:04:35,044
I wouldn't dream
of it, my boy.

1143
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:38,313
I just want you
to stay in shape tonight, that's all.

1144
01:04:38,783 --> 01:04:41,951
Where do you get off
owning paintings like these-

1145
01:04:42,052 --> 01:04:44,887
picasso, braque,
rouault, renoir?

1146
01:04:45,357 --> 01:04:48,557
What do you know
about painting anyway, you old goof?

1147
01:04:48,726 --> 01:04:51,795
Your art appreciation
ended with mutt and jeff.

1148
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:52,631
Ha ha ha!

1149
01:04:53,866 --> 01:04:57,100
Do you have any idea
what it takes to be a great artist

1150
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,670
or even
an inferior one?

1151
01:04:59,671 --> 01:05:02,606
The dedication,
the sacrifice, the time?

1152
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,144
Come on, meathead.
Fire me.

1153
01:05:06,145 --> 01:05:09,079
Speaking of meatheads,
that reminds me.

1154
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:10,583
Dinner-

1155
01:05:10,985 --> 01:05:13,319
just a second.
Just a second.

1156
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,586
Doug. Doug!

1157
01:05:14,587 --> 01:05:17,455
This is a surprise
for ted and angie.

1158
01:05:19,092 --> 01:05:19,460
Ha ha ha!

1159
01:05:20,093 --> 01:05:23,028
It's a surprise
for ted and angie.

1160
01:05:34,443 --> 01:05:36,344
Voila! No mustache.

1161
01:05:36,345 --> 01:05:39,014
Huh? Ted and angie
would know me now.

1162
01:05:39,015 --> 01:05:42,183
Doug, i'm glad you're down.
We're a little late, dinner-wise.

1163
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:45,453
Dinner-wise. Gee,
i wish i'd have said that-wise.

1164
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:49,024
Whoop. Drink-wise.
Drink-wise, drink-

1165
01:05:51,595 --> 01:05:53,995
sorry-wise.

1166
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:54,498
Apologize.

1167
01:05:57,134 --> 01:05:59,801
Sorry-wise,
apologize.

1168

Sorry-wise,

and fatso-wise
and wise-and-wise

1176

1182
01:06:38,645 --> 01:06:41,780
i dream of jeanie
with the light brown hair

1183
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,253

1186
01:06:51,693 --> 01:06:54,995
be my love,
for no one else can end this yearning

1187
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:00,968
for you, i'll make
the sweetest music

1188
01:07:11,048 --> 01:07:13,814
time for the party-wise!

1189
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:18,721
Do do do do ha!

Do do, ooh ooh,

01:07:46,752 --> 01:07:48,654
sound retreat!

1194
01:07:48,655 --> 01:07:51,422
Damsel in distress!
Charge!

1195
01:07:51,591 --> 01:07:54,258
Follow me!
Over the moat!

1196
01:07:56,930 --> 01:08:00,065
Dinner-wise,
i'm with you, jerry-lewis-wise.

1197
01:08:09,143 --> 01:08:11,478
Stand back.
My old trick.

1198
01:08:11,479 --> 01:08:14,347
Nothing up my sleeves.
No mustache.

1199
01:08:32,168 --> 01:08:32,469
Max.

1200
01:08:32,836 --> 01:08:34,170
Think he'll win?

1201
01:08:34,171 --> 01:08:34,571
Sure. Hi.

1202
01:08:36,773 --> 01:08:37,041
Hi.

1203
01:08:37,508 --> 01:08:38,407
Well, if it isn't
ted riley.

1204
01:08:38,408 --> 01:08:41,678
Well, if it isn't
charlie culloran. What a nice surprise.

1205
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,480
What are you
doing here, charlie?

1206
01:08:43,481 --> 01:08:45,148
Just came over
to say hello to you

1207
01:08:45,149 --> 01:08:46,217
and wish the kid
good luck.

1208
01:08:46,218 --> 01:08:47,851
That's swell
of you, charlie.

1209
01:08:47,852 --> 01:08:49,186
He looks great.
Thanks.

1210
01:08:49,187 --> 01:08:50,822
Frankly,
when i lost him to you,

1211
01:08:50,823 --> 01:08:52,122
i thought he was
just nothing.

1212
01:08:52,123 --> 01:08:53,791
You've done
wonders with him.

1213
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:54,592
Thanks again.

1214
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:55,493
I'll see you
around.

1215
01:08:55,494 --> 01:08:57,495
A few things
i want to talk to you about soon.

1216
01:08:57,496 --> 01:08:58,163
Sure thing, charlie.

1217
01:08:58,164 --> 01:08:59,164
I want you
to come up to the house.

1218
01:08:59,165 --> 01:09:01,566
I'll have my wife cook us
a nice chicken dumpling dinner

1219
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,801
with all
the trimmings.

1220
01:09:02,802 --> 01:09:04,737
And bring
the young lady.

1221
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:06,038
Sure thing, charlie.

1222
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:06,439
Good luck.

1223
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:07,440
Thanks.

1224
01:09:09,075 --> 01:09:10,809
Who is that?

1225
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:14,112
That's little
miss fix-it and his crowd of debutantes.

1226
01:09:14,915 --> 01:09:15,215
Oh.

1227
01:09:16,183 --> 01:09:16,750
Ted: Hiya, kid.

1228
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:19,151
Where were you?
You're late, ted.

1229
01:09:19,152 --> 01:09:19,520
I get it.

1230
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,521
Good luck
tonight. Thanks.

1231
01:09:21,522 --> 01:09:23,390
Ok, georgie,
i'll finish here.

1232
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:24,892
Wait outside.
Thanks.

1233
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:25,993
Get a good rest?

1234
01:09:25,994 --> 01:09:27,027
Sure. I feel swell.

1235
01:09:27,028 --> 01:09:28,763
I'm glad,
because i got everything i own

1236
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:31,499
riding on you
tonight, kid, but i know

1237
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,034
i'm a cinch
to clean up on you.

1238
01:09:34,035 --> 01:09:34,336
Yeah.

1239
01:09:34,936 --> 01:09:36,504
You seem
a little nervous.

1240
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:37,605
Who, me? Uh-uh.

1241
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,708
You got nothing
to be nervous about.

1242
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:40,942
It's a big night.

1243
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:43,412
Yeah. It was
a big day today, too.

1244
01:09:43,413 --> 01:09:46,215
Remember that
date i had to keep at 12:00?

1245
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:46,549
Yeah.

1246
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:48,617
That wasn't
with a girl.

1247
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:50,853
It turned out
to be a date with myself.

1248
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:51,121
Huh?

1249
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,055
First time
i met up with myself

1250
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:54,457
in about
10 years.

1251
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,392
You sound nuts.

1252
01:09:55,393 --> 01:09:57,394
But i'm glad
i got you, kid.

1253
01:09:57,395 --> 01:09:59,229
You're my one
accomplishment.

1254
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:02,531
Yeah, you're right.
The boys are real proud of you.

1255
01:10:04,035 --> 01:10:06,202
Huh? What
did you say?

1256
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:09,105
I said the boys
are real proud of you.

1257
01:10:10,442 --> 01:10:10,809
The boys.

1258
01:10:15,414 --> 01:10:17,048
Look, kid,
remember what i told you

1259
01:10:17,049 --> 01:10:20,050
about keeping
your hands down? Come here.

1260
01:10:20,386 --> 01:10:23,487
See, you got them
down like this, all relaxed.

1261
01:10:30,897 --> 01:10:33,566
George: Come on, kid!
They're waiting for you!

1262
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:36,468
Ok, go ahead.
He'll be right up.

1263
01:10:37,138 --> 01:10:39,005
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1264
01:10:39,006 --> 01:10:42,174
You go on, georgie.
I'll bring him right up.

1265
01:10:48,951 --> 01:10:49,250
Taxi.

1266
01:10:50,452 --> 01:10:53,052
530 east 48th street.

1267
01:10:54,456 --> 01:10:55,823
Ted, you idiot,
what did you do?

1268
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:57,258
Those men
are going to kill you.

1269
01:10:57,259 --> 01:10:58,460
Between
the two of us,

1270
01:10:58,461 --> 01:10:59,461
we can handle
anybody.

1271
01:10:59,462 --> 01:11:01,463
But, ted,
aren't you in terrible danger?

1272
01:11:01,464 --> 01:11:04,498
Yeah. Yeah,
i'm in terrible danger.

1273
01:11:04,968 --> 01:11:07,268
I'm in danger
of believing

1274
01:11:07,269 --> 01:11:09,438
that look
on your face.

1275
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:10,939
You know,
10 years ago,

1276
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:14,109
i told myself
i'd never let this happen again.

1277
01:11:14,711 --> 01:11:15,078
And then-

1278
01:11:20,385 --> 01:11:20,685
oh!

1279
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:23,952
That's nothing,
darling. It's only the car.

1280
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,991
No, it isn't.
Remember?

1281
01:11:26,992 --> 01:11:29,326
It's my own invention...

1282
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:31,895
exploding in my face.

1283
01:11:36,902 --> 01:11:38,169
How's he coming,
swenson?

1284
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:38,904
Fine, mr. Fielding.

1285
01:11:38,905 --> 01:11:40,505
I'll have him
shipshape in half an hour.

1286
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:43,509
Good. We have to leave
for the telecast at 10:30.

1287
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:44,843
I'll give him
deep massage,

1288
01:11:44,844 --> 01:11:47,513
and he'll be
good as new.

1289
01:11:47,514 --> 01:11:48,813
Oh. Somebody stole
my mustache.

1290
01:11:48,814 --> 01:11:52,150
Fielding, i want
that mustache returned, every hair in place.

1291
01:11:52,786 --> 01:11:53,153
Ha ha ha!

1292
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:08,467
Miss leighton,
what on earth are you up to?

1293
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:08,937
Hmm?

1294
01:12:09,037 --> 01:12:10,837
You've been
living here two years.

1295
01:12:10,838 --> 01:12:13,241
You know our simple,
steadfast rules-

1296
01:12:13,242 --> 01:12:14,708
no men beyond this line.

1297
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:17,545
Couldn't you make
an exception in my case?

1298
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:18,446
I'm a traveling
salesman.

1299
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:20,582
I'm sorry.
And besides, miss leighton,

1300
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:21,816
what are you
doing here at this hour?

1301
01:12:21,817 --> 01:12:24,453
You're usually
at your broadcast by this time.

1302
01:12:24,454 --> 01:12:26,421
Oh, the broadcast!
Ted, will you please wait here for me?

1303
01:12:26,422 --> 01:12:27,722
I have to change.
I'll be down in 10 minutes.

1304
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:30,459
And listen, there's
something about the program i've got to tell you.

1305
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:33,362
I'll tell you
on the way over, and you can make up your mind.

1306
01:12:33,363 --> 01:12:33,829
About what?

1307
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,930
It's ridiculous,
and i'm sick of it,

1308
01:12:34,931 --> 01:12:38,200
and i'll explain it
on the way over. I'll hurry.

1309
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,869
I'll be here.

1310
01:12:49,647 --> 01:12:52,049
Have you a side
entrance here?

1311
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:52,883
Yes. There.

1312
01:12:52,884 --> 01:12:53,785
Tell miss leighton
i had to leave.

1313
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,053
I'll meet her
at the broadcast. Thank you. Good-bye.

1314
01:15:23,481 --> 01:15:26,382
Why am i feeling
so good?

1315
01:15:27,785 --> 01:15:30,853
Why am i feeling
so strong?

1316
01:15:31,923 --> 01:15:35,124
Why am i feeling,
when things could look black

1317
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:39,096
that nothing could
possibly go wrong?

1318
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,501
This has been
a most unusual day

1319
01:15:47,607 --> 01:15:50,808
love has made me
see things in a different way

1320
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:01,422
can it be

1321
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:05,791
i like myself?

1322
01:16:06,294 --> 01:16:09,261
She likes me,
so i like myself

1323
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,203
if someone wonderful
as she is

1324
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:20,841
can think i'm wonderful

1325
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:24,077
i must be
quite a guy

1326
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:28,382
feeling so
unlike myself

1327
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:34,523
always used to
dislike myself

1328
01:16:38,462 --> 01:16:41,530
but now my love
has got me riding high

1329
01:16:45,002 --> 01:16:47,636
she likes me, so

1330
01:16:48,172 --> 01:16:48,706
so do i

1331
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,401
she likes me, so

1332
01:17:15,402 --> 01:17:15,936
so do i

1333
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:29,880
ladies and gentlemen,

1334
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:33,382
in just 3 minutes,
midnight with madeline will start.

1335
01:19:33,451 --> 01:19:36,521
Now, don't forget,
we have a battery of television cameras

1336
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:39,923
cleverly concealed,
so be careful what you say to your neighbor

1337
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:44,127
or how affectionate you are
with your partner of the evening

1338
01:19:44,496 --> 01:19:47,364
because remember,
you may be on tv.

1339
01:19:57,277 --> 01:19:59,278
What am i doing here?

1340
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:01,248
Doug, if you stand
over here at the bar,

1341
01:20:01,249 --> 01:20:03,516
you'll be able
to see everything.

1342
01:20:03,517 --> 01:20:03,884
All right.

1343
01:20:04,418 --> 01:20:07,120
Host: If you look
up to the right of the monitor...

1344
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:09,289
right this way,
mr. Valentine.

1345
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:12,059
Host: Each time you see
the applause sign...

1346
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:12,893
yes, sir,
what is it?

1347
01:20:12,894 --> 01:20:15,162
I want to see
miss leighton. Tell her it's ted riley.

1348
01:20:15,163 --> 01:20:17,364
Oh, mr. Riley,
i'm trasker.

1349
01:20:17,365 --> 01:20:19,033
The show's
just going on.

1350
01:20:19,034 --> 01:20:20,234
Please step
over here.

1351
01:20:20,235 --> 01:20:21,936
She'll see you
right afterwards.

1352
01:20:21,937 --> 01:20:22,771
Oh, thank you.

1353
01:20:22,772 --> 01:20:25,073
Host: Yes, yes, yes,
it's 11:00,

1354
01:20:25,074 --> 01:20:28,409
and the makers of
klenzrite, dozerite, isrite, and wasrite,

1355
01:20:29,779 --> 01:20:32,580
also manufacturers
of h2o cola,

1356
01:20:32,816 --> 01:20:34,917
that effervescent cola
that's pure as water,

1357
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:38,720
as nonfattening as water,
but, oh, boy, that cola taste that zooms you up to the skies,

1358
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:45,427
presents midnight with madeline,
starring...

1359
01:20:47,331 --> 01:20:49,865
me. May i come in?

1360
01:20:53,338 --> 01:20:53,871
Remember

1361
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:58,975
that klenzrite is
the only washing soap

1362
01:21:00,346 --> 01:21:00,846
for you

1363
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:02,781
remember

1364
01:21:04,783 --> 01:21:06,618
that klenzrite
is the soap

1365
01:21:06,619 --> 01:21:09,520
that washes things
so new

1366
01:21:10,289 --> 01:21:12,957
please remember

1367
01:21:14,294 --> 01:21:17,462
the many things
that only klenzrite can do

1368
01:21:20,801 --> 01:21:21,301
remember

1369
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:26,805
to call your grocer
to send you

1370
01:21:28,309 --> 01:21:28,876
klenzrite

1371
01:21:38,287 --> 01:21:41,221
and now you dear
ladies and gentlemen,

1372
01:21:41,723 --> 01:21:43,892

going to do.

1373
01:21:43,893 --> 01:21:46,460
I'm going to
sing you a song.

1374
01:21:46,461 --> 01:21:49,830
It's my latest recording,
and i do hope you just love it.

1375
01:21:50,733 --> 01:21:53,868
But even if you don't,
i don't really mind,

1376
01:21:54,037 --> 01:21:56,671
as long as you love me.

1377
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:11,754

01:24:13,054 --> 01:24:16,088
and thanks for
the state of maine

1404
01:24:17,025 --> 01:24:20,360
and thanks for the autographed
picture of john wayne

1405
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:26,667
thanks a lot,
but no, thanks

1406
01:24:27,237 --> 01:24:30,003
thanks for the cruise

1407
01:24:30,906 --> 01:24:34,008
and thanks
for the oil wells that ooze

1408
01:24:35,345 --> 01:24:38,547
and thanks for that pair
of fred astaire shoes

1409
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:43,585
thanks a lot,
but no, thanks

1410
01:24:44,755 --> 01:24:47,723
for i am just
a faithful lassie

1411
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,328
waiting for
her faithful lad

1412
01:24:53,365 --> 01:24:56,465
and there's no gift,
however classy

1413
01:24:57,702 --> 01:25:00,704
by which this lassie
can be had

1414
01:25:02,608 --> 01:25:05,509
thanks for losing
your mind

1415
01:25:06,512 --> 01:25:09,679
and thanks for
fort knox, sealed and signed

1416
01:25:10,383 --> 01:25:14,184
but i've got a guy
who's clifton webb and marlon brando combined

1417
01:25:20,928 --> 01:25:23,962
thanks a lot,
but no, no, thanks

1418
01:25:37,613 --> 01:25:40,713
now, ladies and gentlemen,
our weekly featurette,

1419
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:44,217
the throb of manhattan.

1420
01:25:47,556 --> 01:25:48,757
Dear ladies and gentlemen,

1421
01:25:48,758 --> 01:25:52,159
we come to the part
of the program which is always my favorite

1422
01:25:52,929 --> 01:25:54,763
because it means something,

1423
01:25:54,764 --> 01:25:58,032
because it means
this big, cold canyon we call new york

1424
01:26:00,537 --> 01:26:01,471
really has a heart.

1425
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:05,006
Somewhere in this room
is the surprise guest or guests for this evening.

1426
01:26:07,645 --> 01:26:09,579
Could it be you?

1427
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:24,060
Yes, boys,
you're on television!

1428
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,334
Oh, the time has come
for parting

1429
01:26:29,335 --> 01:26:30,635
and the marching
music ends

1430
01:26:30,636 --> 01:26:32,371
no matter where
our lives may lead us

1431
01:26:32,372 --> 01:26:34,139
in our hearts,
we'll still be friends

1432
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:37,275
for friends we are now,
and friends we'll stay

1433
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:40,311
until we meet again
one wonderful day

1434
01:26:40,614 --> 01:26:42,115
let a million miles
divide us

1435
01:26:42,116 --> 01:26:43,316
let the years go
rolling by

1436
01:26:43,317 --> 01:26:45,284
although the time
has come for parting

1437
01:26:45,285 --> 01:26:47,654
we'll be friends
until we die

1438
01:26:47,655 --> 01:26:49,022
ladies and gentlemen,

1439
01:26:49,023 --> 01:26:52,290
10 years ago,
these 3 g.i. Joes returning from the war

1440
01:26:54,295 --> 01:26:57,230
made a solemn pledge
to meet again today.

1441
01:26:57,499 --> 01:27:00,433
They had their glorious
reunion at noon,

1442
01:27:00,703 --> 01:27:03,603
proving true friendship
never dies.

1443
01:27:05,341 --> 01:27:08,142
Yes, friends,
this is ted riley,

1444
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:10,545
angelo valentine,
and douglas hallerton.

1445
01:27:10,546 --> 01:27:12,715
Boys, this reception
is also being given to you

1446
01:27:12,716 --> 01:27:16,150
by millions of people
sitting in their homes all over the country,

1447
01:27:17,587 --> 01:27:19,855
and i know that
just like me,

1448
01:27:19,856 --> 01:27:22,724
they are all feeling
a wee bit misty.

1449
01:27:23,527 --> 01:27:23,894
Bless you.

1450
01:27:24,695 --> 01:27:27,596
Oh, look. Little angelo
is blushing.

1451
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:30,999
Bless him.
Isn't this wonderful?

1452
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:33,802
Isn't this
a great surprise?

1453
01:27:34,172 --> 01:27:35,239
It certainly is
for me,

1454
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,340
though i think
i was about to be tipped off.

1455
01:27:39,911 --> 01:27:43,180
This is why
you spent every minute of the day with me.

1456
01:27:44,216 --> 01:27:45,683
I should have
smelled a rat.

1457
01:27:45,684 --> 01:27:48,919
Hey, connie,
if you're watching, nothing happened!

1458
01:27:49,188 --> 01:27:51,056
Ha ha ha! Connie,
ladies and gentlemen,

1459
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:54,559
is little angie's
wife, who is watching the show from schenectady.

1460
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:01,634
And this is
douglas hallerton, everyone,

1461
01:28:01,635 --> 01:28:02,802
who knew nothing
about it,

1462
01:28:02,803 --> 01:28:06,137
even though he is
one of our own executive vice presidents

1463
01:28:07,308 --> 01:28:09,209
from chicago.

1464
01:28:10,411 --> 01:28:13,746
Now, really, doug,
isn't this a great moment for you,

1465
01:28:14,983 --> 01:28:18,117
being the surprise guest
on one of your own shows?

1466
01:28:18,253 --> 01:28:21,354
Madeline, sincerely,
i deserve every bit of it.

1467
01:28:21,556 --> 01:28:23,825
It's truly
a fitting climax

1468
01:28:23,826 --> 01:28:25,660
to 10 years
of self-degradation,

1469
01:28:25,661 --> 01:28:27,695
and if anyone interested
is watching,

1470
01:28:27,696 --> 01:28:30,599
i know what she meant,
change-wise, that is.

1471
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,601
Uh, yes, yours is a true
success story, doug.

1472
01:28:34,004 --> 01:28:37,072
But not all of us
can reach the top, ladies and gentlemen.

1473
01:28:37,073 --> 01:28:40,008
Some of us sometimes
need a helping hand.

1474
01:28:40,344 --> 01:28:42,945
Take mr. Valentine,
for instance.

1475
01:28:42,946 --> 01:28:45,947
Now, mr. Valentine
is a sweet, simple person,

1476
01:28:46,483 --> 01:28:48,551
one of the vast army
of little gray men

1477
01:28:48,552 --> 01:28:51,021
who struggle along
from day to day,

1478
01:28:51,022 --> 01:28:52,556
gallantly making
ends meet.

1479
01:28:52,557 --> 01:28:55,625
Angie, we are going to
give you, absolutely free,

1480
01:28:56,094 --> 01:28:59,162
a klenzrite washing machine
plus a 5-year supply

1481
01:28:59,965 --> 01:29:01,599
of fishmayer's
non-scuffle shoes

1482
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,468
for your poor, dear
little kiddies.

1483
01:29:05,003 --> 01:29:08,038
Bless you. Here is
your klenzrite guarantee

1484
01:29:08,874 --> 01:29:11,942
and mr. Fishmayer's
personal certificate.

1485
01:29:12,478 --> 01:29:14,112
Thanks a lot...

1486
01:29:14,113 --> 01:29:15,781
but no, thanks.

1487
01:29:15,782 --> 01:29:17,049
I'm not looking
for any handouts,

1488
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:20,352
and i'm not one
of any vast army of little gray men.

1489
01:29:20,854 --> 01:29:24,222
I'm doing all right,
and i can take care of my own family.

1490
01:29:25,325 --> 01:29:25,726
Thank you.

1491
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,061
Isn't that wonderful,
ladies and gentlemen?

1492
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:30,330
And you, mr. Riley.

1493
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:32,332
I understand that
you are engaged

1494
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:33,733
in the glamorous world
of sports.

1495
01:29:33,734 --> 01:29:35,736
Tell us about
yourself, won't you?

1496
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:38,405
There's nothing
to tell. I'm a bum.

1497
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:38,674
Hmm?

1498
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,508
A bum. You know,
a small-time operator.

1499
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:43,877
I'm mixed up with
some of the shadiest characters in town.

1500
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:45,113
As a matter of fact,

1501
01:29:45,114 --> 01:29:48,448
knowing the inspiring,
uplifting work you do on this program,

1502
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:51,351
i feel terrible
about showing my face

1503
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:53,455
in decent homes
all over the country.

1504
01:29:53,456 --> 01:29:56,691
Boys, don't be like me.
Live clean. Use klenzrite.

1505
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,195
Uh, why, thank you.

1506
01:29:59,196 --> 01:30:01,430
And now tell us
about your glorious reunion.

1507
01:30:01,431 --> 01:30:03,265
The three of you
walked into tim's bar-

1508
01:30:03,266 --> 01:30:05,501
look, madeline,
i'd like to help you out

1509
01:30:05,502 --> 01:30:06,102
and give you

1510
01:30:06,103 --> 01:30:07,470
all the phony
sentiment and corn you want,

1511
01:30:07,471 --> 01:30:10,672
but i'm afraid
i'll have to disappoint you.

1512
01:30:12,744 --> 01:30:14,645
When the three of us
met today

1513
01:30:14,646 --> 01:30:17,880
in tim's bar
for the big moment, it was horrible.

1514
01:30:18,483 --> 01:30:20,284
The years had-

1515
01:30:20,285 --> 01:30:21,886
the years had
made us strangers.

1516
01:30:21,887 --> 01:30:24,554
We-we hated
one another.

1517
01:30:25,991 --> 01:30:27,959
I know now
why i hated them.

1518
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,695
It's because
i hated myself.

1519
01:30:30,696 --> 01:30:32,830
But i'm glad
it happened

1520
01:30:32,831 --> 01:30:34,934
because i'd like
the guys to know

1521
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:36,635
that whatever
they think of me,

1522
01:30:36,636 --> 01:30:38,137
i don't blame them,

1523
01:30:38,138 --> 01:30:41,038
and i'd give several
arms and legs

1524
01:30:41,475 --> 01:30:44,477
to win their
friendship and respect again.

1525
01:30:44,478 --> 01:30:47,746
I'll try and spend
the next 10 years winning it back.

1526
01:30:48,282 --> 01:30:51,349
Good night,
madeline. It's been swell.

1527
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:55,423
Uh-

1528
01:30:55,823 --> 01:30:59,058
and now, ladies and gentlemen,
the klenzrite cakewalkers.

1529
01:31:14,811 --> 01:31:16,144
Hello, riley.

1530
01:31:16,145 --> 01:31:18,680
Charlie culloran.

1531
01:31:18,782 --> 01:31:19,183
Hi, rocky.

1532
01:31:20,484 --> 01:31:21,484
Dirty crook.

1533
01:31:21,485 --> 01:31:24,519
Ted: I'm sorry you feel
that way, rocky.

1534
01:31:24,989 --> 01:31:28,024
Charlie: We hate to
interrupt your evening of nightclubbing-

1535
01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:30,294
nightclubbing?
Why, this-

1536
01:31:30,295 --> 01:31:30,695
oh, yeah?

1537
01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:34,397
Yeah, but we'd like
to have you come along with us.

1538
01:31:34,398 --> 01:31:36,967
To your house
for that chicken dumpling dinner?

1539
01:31:36,968 --> 01:31:39,269
Ted, i'm afraid
you won't be able to enjoy

1540
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:41,205
a chicken dumpling
dinner for 3 or 4 years.

1541
01:31:41,206 --> 01:31:42,540
Cover ted riley
with number 3 camera.

1542
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:45,642
Get that mike
down closer and keep it there!

1543
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,981
Maybe after 5 or 6
months,

1544
01:31:49,982 --> 01:31:52,850
you can take
a little clear broth.

1545
01:31:57,857 --> 01:31:59,725
Oh, really?

1546
01:31:59,726 --> 01:32:00,960
I'm afraid so.

1547
01:32:00,961 --> 01:32:03,295
Well, why this
attitude, charlie?

1548
01:32:03,296 --> 01:32:06,431
Of course you know, ted,
there was no fight tonight.

1549
01:32:06,467 --> 01:32:07,800
When the kid
regained consciousness,

1550
01:32:07,801 --> 01:32:10,170
he told us how
you'd knocked him out.

1551
01:32:10,171 --> 01:32:12,239
When charlie culloran
fixes a fix,

1552
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,374
he wants it
to stay fixed.

1553
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:15,342
What was that,
charlie?

1554
01:32:15,343 --> 01:32:18,444
I say when i fix them,
i want them to stay fixed.

1555
01:32:19,447 --> 01:32:21,182
Oh, fixed? Oh.
Thank you very much.

1556
01:32:21,183 --> 01:32:22,716
Yes. Well, i can
understand that, charlie.

1557
01:32:22,717 --> 01:32:24,585
Pride in one's work
and all.

1558
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:26,354
Ted: I kind of felt
that tonight, too.

1559
01:32:26,355 --> 01:32:29,723
I was a little annoyed
at the kid for wanting to throw the fight

1560
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:31,158
after all the hard work
i had done with him,

1561
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:34,461
so i thought the best
thing to do was to incapacitate him

1562
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:36,398
and prevent the fight
from going on.

1563
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:38,433
Of course, if it was
just a matter of me being upset,

1564
01:32:38,434 --> 01:32:41,537
i'd forget about it,
but there are several other gentlemen involved,

1565
01:32:41,538 --> 01:32:44,374
and they'd like to have
a little chat with you.

1566
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:45,208
Who could they be?

1567
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:47,610
Barney gaber,
larry treadman, zeb o'flair-

1568
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:50,814
barney, larry, zeb?
They're all in on the, uh, fix?

1569
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,649
Yes, and i think
it would be a little rude

1570
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:53,750
to keep them
waiting.

1571
01:32:53,751 --> 01:32:56,852
I have a couple
of boys here to escort us out.

1572
01:32:57,688 --> 01:33:00,623
Say, charlie,
have you ever been on tv?

1573
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:01,626
What?

1574
01:33:01,927 --> 01:33:02,860
Have you ever
been on tv?

1575
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:05,563
You know,
you got a beautiful full face,

1576
01:33:05,564 --> 01:33:06,898
but let's see
your profile.

1577
01:33:06,899 --> 01:33:08,400
The profile
is very important

1578
01:33:08,401 --> 01:33:09,901
for love scenes
and so forth.

1579
01:33:09,902 --> 01:33:10,835
That's very,
very nice.

1580
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:14,105
Rocky, don't you think
charlie would be good on tv?

1581
01:33:14,608 --> 01:33:15,908
To tell you
the truth,

1582
01:33:15,909 --> 01:33:17,042
i never thought
about it before,

1583
01:33:17,043 --> 01:33:19,345
but up on the
screen, there's an actor there

1584
01:33:19,346 --> 01:33:20,712
who ain't
no prettier than charlie.

1585
01:33:20,713 --> 01:33:22,415
If i didn't
want to be deemed crazy,

1586
01:33:22,416 --> 01:33:23,816
i'd say
it was charlie.

1587
01:33:23,817 --> 01:33:24,751
What are you
talking about?

1588
01:33:24,752 --> 01:33:26,585
Yes, charlie,
you're on television.

1589
01:33:26,586 --> 01:33:28,588
You've just given
a nice, clear statement

1590
01:33:28,589 --> 01:33:31,356
before about
60 million people.

1591
01:33:33,561 --> 01:33:33,928
Why, you-

1592
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,067
ted, you all right?

1593
01:33:40,068 --> 01:33:42,303
Doug: Angie, cover me!

1594
01:33:42,304 --> 01:33:44,238
Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.

1595
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:45,473
Ready in the firing line.

1596
01:33:45,474 --> 01:33:48,041
Charge!
Charge!

1597
01:33:51,113 --> 01:33:53,614
Ted: Bombs away!

1598
01:34:11,035 --> 01:34:13,502
Hit the dirt!

1599
01:34:21,146 --> 01:34:23,713
Yay!
Yay! Yay!

1600
01:34:53,648 --> 01:34:54,015
Fire one!

1601
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:16,738
I'm coming, angie!

1602
01:35:49,374 --> 01:35:49,741
Hey, look.

1603
01:35:54,414 --> 01:35:57,782
Let's get out of here
before they ask a lot of questions.

1604
01:36:02,589 --> 01:36:05,857
Ladies and gentlemen,
your madeline has done it again.

1605
01:36:06,727 --> 01:36:10,028
You have witnessed
not only the reunion of the 3 ex-g.i. S,

1606
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:12,265
but also our additional
surprise guest,

1607
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:15,501
charles z. Culloran,
notorious racketeer and gambler,

1608
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:19,006
making a spontaneous
and unrehearsed confession

1609
01:36:19,007 --> 01:36:22,408
which will doubtless
send him up the river for 50 or 60 years!

1610
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:27,047
All this on our weekly
human-interest featurette, the throb of manhattan.

1611
01:36:35,658 --> 01:36:38,759
March, march,
march, april, may, june

1612
01:36:38,928 --> 01:36:42,096
june, june, june, july
and august, september

1613
01:36:42,533 --> 01:36:45,034
sept, sept, september,
october-

1614
01:36:45,035 --> 01:36:47,270
what happened
to the rover boys?

1615
01:36:47,271 --> 01:36:49,472
We've been
on television.

1616
01:36:49,473 --> 01:36:50,841
Come on, tim.
Set 'em up.

1617
01:36:50,842 --> 01:36:52,709
Sure got to
hand it to you guys.

1618
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:55,545
10 years, and
the same old pals.

1619
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:58,182
Nothing changed.

1620
01:36:58,183 --> 01:36:58,550
Ha ha ha!

1621
01:37:01,219 --> 01:37:02,619
Tim, we love you.

1622
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:03,453
You got a sharp eye.

1623
01:37:03,454 --> 01:37:05,823
Hello, dorothy?
It's me-doug.

1624
01:37:05,824 --> 01:37:07,392
I just wanted
to tell-

1625
01:37:07,393 --> 01:37:07,693
what?

1626
01:37:08,727 --> 01:37:11,328
Oh, you saw the program?

1627
01:37:12,098 --> 01:37:14,498
Oh, you do?

1628
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,602
Yeah, well, so do i.

1629
01:37:16,603 --> 01:37:19,605
Listen, darling,
i don't know how you stood me up till now.

1630
01:37:19,606 --> 01:37:19,972
Yes, i am.

1631
01:37:22,475 --> 01:37:24,410
But now i've got
a chance to show you-

1632
01:37:24,411 --> 01:37:27,278
listen, dot,
i know we can make it.

1633
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:31,817
Yeah. L-
well, i...

1634
01:37:32,953 --> 01:37:35,755
i can't say any more
right now.

1635
01:37:35,756 --> 01:37:36,057
Just-

1636
01:37:37,392 --> 01:37:39,791
i love you.

1637
01:37:40,061 --> 01:37:40,328
Bye.

1638
01:37:49,771 --> 01:37:51,406
To dorothy.

1639
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:51,741
Dorothy.

1640
01:37:54,877 --> 01:37:56,712
And one for connie
and the kids.

1641
01:37:56,713 --> 01:37:58,380
And the cordon bleu.

1642
01:37:58,381 --> 01:38:00,749
No. No more
cordon bleu.

1643
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,351
From now on,
it's just going to be

1644
01:38:02,352 --> 01:38:05,386
plain "angie and connie's
roadside diner."

1645
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:07,257
Well...

1646
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:09,926
hey, i remember
old bootsie.

1647
01:38:09,927 --> 01:38:10,993
The kid from the south

1648
01:38:10,994 --> 01:38:12,395
that was always
tripping all over himself?

1649
01:38:12,396 --> 01:38:14,364
Sure. His name
was george something-or-other.

1650
01:38:14,365 --> 01:38:15,298
Bootsie.
Brown?

1651
01:38:15,299 --> 01:38:16,634
No, no.
George barry.

1652
01:38:16,635 --> 01:38:17,735
Barry! That's it!

1653
01:38:17,736 --> 01:38:18,736
We were always
toasting him.

1654
01:38:18,737 --> 01:38:20,738
It was good luck
or something.

1655
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:21,038
Why?

1656
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,273
I don't know.
I remember.

1657
01:38:22,274 --> 01:38:23,474
When we landed
at anzio on the beachhead,

1658
01:38:23,475 --> 01:38:25,910
he fell over
his big feet and fell flat on his face.

1659
01:38:25,911 --> 01:38:27,445
We followed him down.
We thought it was orders.

1660
01:38:27,446 --> 01:38:29,881
The machine guns
opened up to let us have it,

1661
01:38:29,882 --> 01:38:31,182
but we were
down flat.

1662
01:38:31,183 --> 01:38:34,251
That's right.
That idiot saved our lives.

1663
01:38:36,422 --> 01:38:38,457
Gee.
Old bootsie.

1664
01:38:38,458 --> 01:38:40,992
Bootsie.
Bootsie.

1665
01:38:42,929 --> 01:38:44,129
Hey,
you remember

1666
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:45,564
corporal
zimmerman?

1667
01:38:45,565 --> 01:38:47,267
Corporal zimmerman!

1668
01:38:47,268 --> 01:38:49,802
All right, all right!
One more, and that's all.

1669
01:38:49,803 --> 01:38:51,104
I got a license
here, remember?

1670
01:38:51,105 --> 01:38:52,839
It's closing time.
It's late.

1671
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,541
We all got homes
to go to.

1672
01:38:54,542 --> 01:38:55,575
Pay up,
and let's go.

1673
01:38:55,576 --> 01:38:57,278
Let's see.
That'll be 4 bucks even.

1674
01:38:57,279 --> 01:38:58,945
I got it.
I got it.

1675
01:38:58,946 --> 01:38:59,314
Hey, hey!

1676
01:39:00,949 --> 01:39:03,284
Wait a minute.
The safe!

1677
01:39:03,285 --> 01:39:04,952
The safe.
The safe.

1678
01:39:04,953 --> 01:39:07,386
There it is.

1679
01:39:11,127 --> 01:39:11,494
4 even.

1680
01:39:12,261 --> 01:39:12,594
4 bucks.

1681
01:39:13,395 --> 01:39:16,130
Tim, that about
wraps it up.

1682
01:39:16,432 --> 01:39:18,933
Jackie: Not quite.

1683
01:39:19,569 --> 01:39:22,537
There's a little
unfinished business.

1684
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:33,048
I think everything's
going to be all right with you, too, ted.

1685
01:39:33,951 --> 01:39:35,485
What do you think,
angie?

1686
01:39:35,486 --> 01:39:36,820
Vote for riley.

1687
01:39:36,821 --> 01:39:39,989
Tim: Though the time
has come for parting

1688
01:39:42,627 --> 01:39:45,529
and the marching
music ends

1689
01:39:47,299 --> 01:39:50,334
no matter where
our lives may lead us

1690
01:39:52,637 --> 01:39:55,773
in our hearts,
we'll still be friends

1691
01:39:58,444 --> 01:40:01,512
though the time
has come for parting

1692
01:40:04,084 --> 01:40:07,018
and the future
lies unknown

1693
01:40:09,456 --> 01:40:12,524
although the years
may come between us

1694
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:19,398
we will never
feel alone

1695
01:40:23,605 --> 01:40:26,573
chorus: For friends
we are now

1696
01:40:29,044 --> 01:40:31,845
and friends we'll stay

1697
01:40:34,884 --> 01:40:37,585
until we meet again

1698
01:40:41,024 --> 01:40:43,691
one wonderful day

1699
01:40:47,164 --> 01:40:50,065
let a million miles
divide us

1700
01:40:52,269 --> 01:40:55,203
let the years
go rolling by

1701
01:40:57,642 --> 01:41:00,709
although the time
has come for parting

1702
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:08,151
we'll be friends
until we die
