'And when it's plessed...a
Woman appears.'

160
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,748
'And she gives you anything you Want.'

161
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,413
Sit, how can I help you?

162
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,970
Tataat! Tataat!

163
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,808
Tataat!

164
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,505
Did he fall in again?

165
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,408
Tataat! Tataat! Tataat!

166
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:34,380
'And this...is the most
important member of out band.'

167
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,806
'When he punches
son1eone...he gets shaken.'

168
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:42,644
'And when he strums the Banjo,
people still get shaken.'

169
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:45,470
'The Big B of Banjo world.'

170
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,008
Tammi.'

171
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,714
'Extorts money for Colpolatol Patil.'

172
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:58,909
'But he couldn't earn
his share of respect yet.'

173
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:03,375
Man, you guys play so well.

174
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,340
Everyone in 0111 area said...

175
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,936
"No one will bother to come down...'

176
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,440
"...if you guys don't play at Navlatri".

177
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,776
That song you guys
played on Gaupati festival.

178
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,369
Absolutely wonderful.

179
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,907
People are just dying
to shower money on you.

180
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,706
And now you demand double the fee.

181
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,605
I meaumyou guys charge double
if the client comes himself.

182
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,436
This isn't right.

183
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,411
Life gives you two choices.

184
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,409
'Either take whatever you get...'

185
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:39,343
'...ol...snatch what you like.'

186
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,608
Now, you decide.

187
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:43,944
I Want double.

188
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:47,541
It's flue.

189
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:49,210
See you.

190
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,445
How are you?

191
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,477
Please talk to him.

192
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,370
He's asking fol double the fees.

193
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,639
Why double?

194
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,474
We're just getting in demand.

195
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,769
That's exactly Why
We can demand double.

196
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,868
Say What?

197
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:07,669
You won't understand just yet.

198
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,210
I will when you're
old enough to understand.

199
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,406
Unbelievable, Tataat. Amazing.

200
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:16,313
What did you understand?
- I didn't...

201
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,541
But if Tania! is saying it,
it must he right.

202
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,340
Right...

203
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,713
I've been trying to explain you for
thlee days, do I look crazy to you'?

204
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,770
Can't you listen. . .01
you don't want to listen?

205
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,211
You go...you must be getting late.

206
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,313
Don't forget to call
after you reach, please.

207
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,511
Don't Worry, mom.
It's only fol a few days...

208
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,442
...and everything's been taken care of.

209
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,904
But he careful,

210
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:53,146
Mulnbai is a really nice place,
and so are its people.

211
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,611
But not everyone's too nice.

212
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,107
Gotya.
- Yeah.

213
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,339
How did I play?

214
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,270
Simply amazing.

215
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:23,207
But if you could play
a little better, then...

216
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,674
Then What?

217
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,313
You think Tania! plays hetlel than me.

218
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,409
That's not What I meant, but...

219
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,074
He took the Gaupati gig as Well.

220
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,710
It's just his good luck.

221
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,612
But soon 0111 time will change.

222
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,313
The biggest 'Navratri'
gig is 0111s after all.

223
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,136
Where will they go'?

224
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,612
Pakya...
- Yeah.

225
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,476
We lost the 'Navlatri' gig as Well.

226
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,569
They hooked Tania! and
his hand fol double the late.

227
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:53,643
What?

228
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,509
Boss...Double!

229
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,669
Tataat! Tataat! Tataat!

230
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,376
Bloody Iascals been
s**** me all the time.

231
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,103
I feel like strangling
the life out of him.

232
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:10,045
This time...I'm going to play
like no one's seen ol heard hefole.

233
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,410
Just let the festivals begin.

234
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,610
Mom, I've leached Mumhai.

235
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,044
It's so colorful.

236
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,735
Hey...

237
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,404
How many times have I told you...

238
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,070
".110! to pickup money with your mouth.

239
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,078
Shame, don't come.'

240
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,643
This is exactly why
people think we're beggars.

241
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,610
Does anyone tell the dllllllll. player
to pickup n1oney from the mouth'?

242
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,703
Does anyone tell a
Harmonium playel to do it?

243
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:16,313
This is Why I am ashamed to
tell anyone that I play the Banjo.

244
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,476
Sit. . .you_t order'?

245
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,477
Wasn't one enough?

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,072
Give it to him.
- Thank you.

247
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,941
Remember why you asked double charge?

248
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,305
So listen...

249
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,611
Half fol playing the banjo...

250
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,644
...and the other half
for the humiliation.

251
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,308
We're not going to get
any respect in this lifetime.

252
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,180
So Why don't We charge
double and make some extra money.

253
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,576
What say...

254
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,002
You're right, Talaat.

255
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,447
I didn't understand,
but since Talaafs saying"

256
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,638
...it must he right...

257
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:12,207
Hey wise-guy... trying to show-off
because you are paid double.

258
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:19,269
Life gives you two choices.

259
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,010
EiLhel you punch him in the them...

260
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,882
...ol you earn double of what
he does and punch him in the guts.

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,978
Come on.

262
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,638
"Round. . .Iou_nd. . . The world's round. "

263
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:02,405
"Carefree. . JSBIGIEGG. . .
Oul heart's carefree."

264
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:13,810
"Round. . .Iou_nd. . . The world's round. "

265
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:17,314
"Carefree. . JSBIGIEGG. . .
Oul heart's carefree."

266
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:21,474
"Abuses...abuses...
Vile abuses is what we like."

267
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:25,379
"We have all the fun We Want."

268
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:28,903
"We get drunk and dance around."

269
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,915
"We get drunk and dance around."

270
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,875
"We dupe the World..."

271
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:40,540
...and show them where it stands."

272
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,043
"We get drunk and dance around."

273
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,912
"We get drunk and dance around."

274
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:22,010
"We're a bit crooked...
and a bit different."

275
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:25,879
"We wander around on deserted
streets leaving out homes."

276
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:33,210
"We're a bit crooked...
and a bit different."

277
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:36,407
"We wander around on deserted
streets leaving out homes."

278
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:40,813
"Whoever tries to act smart..."

279
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:42,540
"We smack him..."

280
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,245
"We smack him...good."

281
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:48,208
"But whenever people clap...fol us."

282
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:52,340
"We give a big smile."

283
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,109
"We get drunk and dance around."

284
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:59,842
"We get drunk and dance around."

285
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,875

"wand show him Whele it stands."

287
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,076
"We get drunk and dance around."

288
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:14,910
"We get drunk and dance around."

289
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,871
5000 rupees...fron1 airport to here.

290
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,304
It happens.

291
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,006
This usually happens
with foreigners here.

292
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,247
Happened with me, too.

293
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,507
By the way,
the thing you were looking for.

294
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,145
The posters.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:56,846
Superb!

296
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,072
Well... at least there was
one good thing about you: trip.

297
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:00,806
Thank you very much.

298
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:04,771
Now can We discuss the plan?
- Ah, plan.

299
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:10,043
So basically, this Banjo
is a very unorganized sector.

300
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,304
There's no concept as
a professional 'Banjo' player.

301
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,806
Slulns. . . hutnlents. . . you will
find these people over there.

302
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:20,847
Basically,
amidst 40% of Mumhafs public.

303
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,941
Like finding coal in the dark.

304
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,368
Are you prep are d'?

305
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:14,771
Tm!

306
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:26,909
Slums in the city...

307
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,914
mate just like disease in 0111 body.

308
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,745
And even if that's not true...

309
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,741
...then you must show it that way.

310
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:35,369
Ex agg crate!

311
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,177
What happened?

312
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:42,243
What?

313
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:45,308
No need to get so emotional.

314
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,604
Afiel all we're running
a Research Agency.

315
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,172
We need to do these things.

316
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,334
You know"

317
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,910
Switch that off.

318
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,602

816
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:19,768
I will.

817
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:27,170
Look Chris, leave all this.

818
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,077
Just forget What happened.

819
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:30,738
We still have time.

820
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,777
Let's try one last time.

821
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,780
Yeah? - Cool!

822
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,077
"Your memories will haunt me..."

823
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,404
Chilled heel.

824
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:30,177
It's been a long day,
let's go home.

825
01:00:30,433 --> 01:00:34,472
Yeah...right, I'll go home too.

826
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,040
New Yolk.

827
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,844
What are you saying?

828
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:41,443
Back then I thought
I should find these guys...

829
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,570
...so I came here.

830
01:00:43,067 --> 01:00:45,707
Now I feel I'll never find them.

831
01:00:46,034 --> 01:00:47,172
So I want to go home.

832
01:00:47,434 --> 01:00:49,744
Chris, don't get so emotional.
- Actually, I am not.

833
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,108
I am being plactical.

834
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:55,413
If I go now, I can still
submit the alhum...try something else.

835
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:57,643
What's wrong with you all of sudden?

836
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,839
I even came here all of a sudden.

837
01:01:00,733 --> 01:01:02,007

853
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,905
Uncle, do you know Tami?
- Why Tammi?

854
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,745
Don't take his name

855
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:33,744

I asked T11R11...

He told me that I shouldn't
say that I am a Banjo playel.

864
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,177
He said it's not a good thing.

He said if you tell hel,
she will never like... - Yeah like...

We'll be there, madam.

884
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,740
They won't get here on time
if you keep looking at the watch.

885
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,774
We]I...at least they have
an attitude of a Ioekstat.

886
01:06:08,267 --> 01:06:10,042
And how do you know these
guys are the same guys.

887
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,170
You haven't seen them.

888
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:14,704
I've seen Lhemmwith my eats.

889
01:06:17,733 --> 01:06:20,543
Chris...keep seeing with you: ears.

890
01:07:08,167 --> 01:07:11,171
Guys, I Want to join your hand.

891
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:14,672
Don't we have enough problems already...

892
01:07:14,934 --> 01:07:15,503
...that she wants to join in too'?

893
01:07:15,567 --> 01:07:17,069
No, I am serious.

894
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,369
Are you having trouble
making ends meet'?

895
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:21,477
We play to make money.

896
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:24,210
When the money We earn isn't enough...

897
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,944
...We play to make mole money.

898
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:30,440
Okaymmayhe you played
till now to make money.

899
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,544
But now...play it for you: heart.

900
01:07:35,934 --> 01:07:38,505
The distance from you: stomach
to the heart is very short.

901
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,236
Chris, let's not complicate it.

902
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:41,512
We simply have to...

903
01:07:41,567 --> 01:07:44,548
Seems like they got separated
when they were kids...

904
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,943
...and finally reunited here.

905

Understood.

907
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,304
The diffelenee between you and me...

908
01:07:54,467 --> 01:07:56,037
...is the color of
my skin and the clothes.

909
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:58,176
Otherwise...even I
was a 'dude' like you.

910
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,977
What are you saying?

911
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:02,444
Can I continue?
- Of course.

912
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:06,306
Guys, we don't want
to join any circus.

913
01:08:06,467 --> 01:08:08,469

Half a Dollar.

927

Does he play at the Gaupati gig?

928
01:08:50,267 --> 01:08:52,975
No. . .he doesn't play
at the 'Ganpati' gig.

929
01:08:53,033 --> 01:08:54,910
But he was like you guys.

01:08:54,967 --> 01:08:57,140
And today he's a huge stat.

931

Vajya...he looks just like you.

933
01:09:02,967 --> 01:09:05,072
His father went thele
to play the trumpet...

934
01:09:05,134 --> 01:09:06,807
Guess he played a different
tune all together.

935
01:09:06,867 --> 01:09:07,902

Veneration...

01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,502
...and everything else goes down there.

984
01:11:52,967 --> 01:11:55,379
It's not a piece of cake.

985
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:57,004
I can't just hand it to you.

986

01:12:06,767 --> 01:12:09,976
But I don't sting my own people.

989
01:12:11,434 --> 01:12:13,710
That ground comes undel my area.

990
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,002
You can forget that area.

991

You Want me to leave it.

Okay... take care.

996
01:12:37,134 --> 01:12:40,081
Patil's too concerned
about the people.

997
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:46,408
Someone go and explain
that Worries can kill.

998

01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:04,840
She pulled the bucket
before I could open the tap.

1003
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:07,313
When I say start then you start.

1004
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:13,673
Stop! Stop!

1005

01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:58,139
And then watch...what we do.

1046
01:15:59,534 --> 01:16:00,877

1047
01:16:01,534 --> 01:16:02,706

1052
01:16:18,467 --> 01:16:22,005
Let's start tomorrow at...
11 o'clock.

1053
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:23,975
Yes, madam.

1054
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:29,643

1055
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:01,570
Hey. . Jelax.

1056
01:17:01,934 --> 01:17:03,880
Then-is no need to he so stressed.

1057
01:17:04,467 --> 01:17:07,607
Selection and rejection...
it's all a part of the game.

1058
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:09,044
You should know that.

1059
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:13,080
What's important is one
should he open to accepting both.

1060
01:17:14,534 --> 01:17:16,775
So...ale you going to saying no?

1061
01:17:17,034 --> 01:17:19,640
Unfortunately love, I'll have to.

1062
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:22,809
From where I stand...

1063
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:25,510
This... Banjo'.

1064
01:17:25,834 --> 01:17:28,110
This is the street music.

1065
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:31,608
And we don't allow street people here.

1066
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,907
But they can get one chance.

1067
01:17:36,467 --> 01:17:39,937
They can...but only to her.

1068
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,881
Look sunshine, its business.

1069
01:17:45,767 --> 01:17:48,714
You've credentials,
which works for n16.

1070
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,940
You've a presence, Wolks fol me.

1071
01:17:54,001 --> 01:17:58,279
And you are... beautiful.

1072
01:18:00,034 --> 01:18:02,640
And that definitely Wolks fol me.

1073
01:18:03,967 --> 01:18:08,677
But this 'Banjo' doesn't work for n16.

1074
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,811
Come solo...then we'll
give these guys a chance.

1075
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,937
Sorry MI. Nair, but we're a band.

1076
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:24,780
And We perform as a hand.
- Then What can I say?

1077
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,676
Hey What...I']I tell you What?

1078
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,702
I'll let you all know, yeah.

1079
01:18:30,901 --> 01:18:34,474
But quite honesflymyoul
chances are late.

1080
01:18:34,534 --> 01:18:37,811
How much'?
- 5 percent.

1081
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,638
I came from New York
to India on O percent.

1082
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:49,342
So 5 percent...is not that bad.
Thank you.

1083
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,210
Nice.

1084
01:19:19,767 --> 01:19:22,270
I guess your smile's missing.

1085
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:27,541
There are other things
in life other than rnusic.

1086
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:29,576
But this is the only thing I have.

1087
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:32,577
In fact, it should he fol you too.

1088
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:38,313
Itnagine...fi_tst time we won't
be playing someone else's music.

1089
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:39,775
It will he 0111 song.

1090
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,973
You need this stage.

1091
01:19:44,567 --> 01:19:47,741
Life... gives you two choices, madam.

1092
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,479
Either you keep abusing life...

1093
01:19:52,634 --> 01:19:56,411
...ol embrace the life that you have.

1094
01:19:57,634 --> 01:19:58,738
Meaning?

1095
01:19:59,767 --> 01:20:00,939
Mean-iJ18--'

1096
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,879
You know...I don't have a father.

1097
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:10,210
So I got myself a
father... who needed a son.

1098
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:12,344
When I couldn't have a home...

1099
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,438
...I made the sky my roof,
and the footpath my bed.

1100
01:20:24,334 --> 01:20:27,611
Tell me something...
do you have a gillfiiend.

1101
01:20:28,334 --> 01:20:29,506
Gillfriend?

1102
01:20:30,567 --> 01:20:32,444
Who will say yes to me?

1103
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,438
Why'? You're so nice.

1104
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,501
Who's going to say no?

1105
01:20:36,367 --> 01:20:37,505
What kind of a gill
are you looking fol?

1106
01:20:37,567 --> 01:20:38,409
Tell me.

1107
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,470

Tell me...what's your type?

1109
01:20:44,634 --> 01:20:47,672

Like me? - Yeah...

1112
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,274
A gill like n1e will never
make a good girlfriend.

1113
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:01,677
My dlealns are more important
than my relationships,

1114
01:21:05,134 --> 01:21:06,477
I don't know much, madam...

1115
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,473
But I do know...when
two lives become one...

1116
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:13,612
"Alley even have the same dleam.

1117
01:21:15,734 --> 01:21:17,714
If I ever have a situation
like this with my gillfiriend...

1118
01:21:18,467 --> 01:21:20,378
...I']1 never interfere with her drearns.

1119
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,339
In fact, I'll tell her...

1120
01:21:23,334 --> 01:21:27,305
"If you Want to fly...I']I
he your airplane."

1121
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,543
"If you Want to
sWim...I']I he your ship."

1122
01:21:32,467 --> 01:21:35,380
If she wants to faJ1...I
will never stop her.

1123
01:21:35,767 --> 01:21:36,802
In fact...

1124
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:38,811
You know that thingulike an umbrella.

1125
01:21:39,367 --> 01:21:40,345
Parachute.

1126
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,378
Yes...

1127
01:21:41,767 --> 01:21:43,678
I'll be her parachute.

1128
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,806
If she's sleepy, I'll be her pillow...

1129
01:21:47,367 --> 01:21:49,779
If not. . .I']1 be her lullaby.

1130
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,674
Maybe I said too much.

1131
01:21:56,067 --> 01:21:57,512
But I am not exaggemting.

1132
01:21:59,567 --> 01:22:04,448

Patil Wanted money.

1510
01:47:58,467 --> 01:48:00,140
He said it and I did it,

Thinking it will be
filled with drugs.

1544
01:50:21,634 --> 01:50:23,011
And as soon as Tania!

...the cops will raid the
place and arrest those two.

01:51:46,634 --> 01:51:48,545
Go away...go..go..go.

1568

Did you try talking to Grease?

1569
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:57,804
I don't think he's
in any mood to listen.

1570

Everything was going smooth.

1581
01:52:40,934 --> 01:52:43,278
No one thought this will happen.

1582
01:52:43,834 --> 01:52:46,815
But this was destiny, I guess.

1583
01:52:47,767 --> 01:52:53,774
Right, madam. What's done is done.

1584
01:52:54,834 --> 01:52:56,211

Just one song.

1593
01:53:30,967 --> 01:53:33,345
You're wasting you: time, madam.

1594

01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:44,277
This time then-is just one.

1609
01:54:49,901 --> 01:54:51,903
Go hack, madam.

1610
01:54:53,534 --> 01:54:57,414
0111 Banjo haudmhas closed down.

1611
01:54:58,267 --> 01:55:01,248
Today you don't know
what you're saying.

1612
01:55:01,534 --> 01:55:03,741
But one day you will realize...

1613
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,610
...that you cannot live without music.

1614
01:55:07,667 --> 01:55:08,668
Bye.

1615
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:17,578
You see this...

1616
01:55:19,234 --> 01:55:22,181
A gleat musician once gave me this.

1617
01:55:22,234 --> 01:55:25,477
Because he saw a
true artist inside me.

1618
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,574
And today I am going
to give it to you.

1619
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:36,243
For the artist that
I once saw inside you.

1620
01:55:40,567 --> 01:55:42,205
I hope you find him.

1621
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,535
Bye, Tami.

1622
01:56:14,134 --> 01:56:17,343
"Lold, why has my failed destiny..."

1623

1624

1625
01:56:24,234 --> 01:56:27,181
<i>" "hound me in u chain."</i>

1626
01:56:27,534 --> 01:56:30,743
"There's darkness before my eyes."

1627
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:34,107
"Why is the dawn upset with me?"

1628
01:56:34,401 --> 01:56:40,113
"Was that colorful
rainbow just an illusion?"

1629
01:56:40,167 --> 01:56:46,413
"Lord...what kind of blessing
in disguise is this?"

1630
01:56:47,034 --> 01:56:53,246
"Lord...what kind of blessing
in disguise is this?"

1631
01:56:53,567 --> 01:57:00,246
"Lord...what kind of blessing

1632
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:07,149
"Lord...what kind of blessing
in disguise is this?"

1633
01:57:07,201 --> 01:57:13,516
"Lord...what kind of blessing
in disguise is this?"

1634
01:57:21,634 --> 01:57:23,113
No..no..no...

1635
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,070
Tania! isn't involved.

1636
01:57:26,601 --> 01:57:28,342
<i>He's my boy.</i>

1637
01:57:29,967 --> 01:57:32,470
When he bent down to touch my feet...

1638
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:37,472
...tW0 unknown guys filed at me.

1639
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:47,243
"Those dleams that We used to see..."

1640
01:57:48,701 --> 01:57:55,277
'...ale now buried under tombs."

1641
01:58:02,267 --> 01:58:07,615
"Those dleams that We used to see..."

1642
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:15,212
'...ale now buried under tombs."

1643
01:58:15,634 --> 01:58:20,634
"Why my dlealns have
shattered to pieces?"

1644
01:58:26,167 --> 01:58:29,307
"Pain has sought refuge in my heart?"

1645
01:58:29,367 --> 01:58:32,280
"But your image hasn't faded away."

1646
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:38,350
"How do I keep my promise
with a broken heart?"

1647
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:45,215
"Lord...what kind of blessing

1650
01:58:58,867 --> 01:59:04,579
"Lord...what kind of blessing

1651
01:59:04,834 --> 01:59:12,514
Uncle... - "Lord...what kind of blessing

1652
01:59:13,234 --> 01:59:22,313

1653
01:59:23,034 --> 01:59:28,143
Ram! Hail Ram!

1654
01:59:33,301 --> 01:59:37,078

01:59:40,367 --> 01:59:41,846
So silently?

1657
02:00:47,167 --> 02:00:48,840
Forgive me.

1658
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:52,143
I made a big mistake.

1659
02:00:53,334 --> 02:00:55,245
How can I forget everything?

1660
02:00:57,201 --> 02:01:00,011
You talented a madman like me.

1661
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,780
You did so much fol me.

1662
02:01:06,067 --> 02:01:08,741
And the things I said
to you in a fit of rage.

1663
02:01:09,101 --> 02:01:12,082
And I hit you too.

1664
02:01:13,867 --> 02:01:18,043
'I shall not give horn...and
direct do accident with you.'

1665
02:01:20,834 --> 02:01:22,370
And all these problems.

1666
02:01:23,301 --> 02:01:24,780
Chris...

1667
02:01:25,334 --> 02:01:26,836
Chris . . . quit India.

1668
02:01:30,501 --> 02:01:31,912
Forgive me.

1669
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:33,305
Enough.

1670
02:01:37,234 --> 02:01:39,339
You can apologies if you like.

1671
02:01:40,367 --> 02:01:42,313
But enough with your English.

1672
02:01:45,467 --> 02:01:48,971
I am so happy...so happy...

1673
02:01:49,034 --> 02:01:52,846
Like someone kept 8 buckets
full of water outside my house.

1674
02:01:54,734 --> 02:01:56,907
Tania! hhai... Tania! hhai...

1675
02:01:56,967 --> 02:02:00,005
Manik si1...Pa.kya...Po]ice Station.

1676
02:02:00,068 --> 02:02:01,103
What?

1677
02:02:01,767 --> 02:02:03,110
Come on.

1678
02:02:04,867 --> 02:02:06,710
You must speak up...

1679
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:08,670
Who those guys were'?

1680
02:02:09,134 --> 02:02:10,272
Where can we find them'?

1681
02:02:10,334 --> 02:02:11,438
Sneak up and"

1682
02:02:18,067 --> 02:02:19,341
Sit, can I speak fol a minute?

1683
02:02:25,434 --> 02:02:29,712
Sorry. I exchanged those boxes.

1684
02:02:31,367 --> 02:02:34,075
I wished you
I Wanted to exceed you.

1685
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:38,039
I got one chance to do it
and pounced on it without thinking.

1686
02:02:38,734 --> 02:02:41,874
But honestly. . .I didn't
want such bad things for you.

1687
02:02:44,967 --> 02:02:47,140
Whenever I used to
see you play the Banjo...

1688
02:02:47,801 --> 02:02:49,872
...it would make me jealous,
it would he painful fol me.

1689
02:02:50,767 --> 02:02:55,273
But...now when you don't play
the Banjo...it pains even more.

1690
02:02:56,667 --> 02:02:58,010
Then I understood.

1691
02:02:58,934 --> 02:03:01,608
My victory isn't in
taking your Banjo away.

1692
02:03:02,368 --> 02:03:04,814
It's in defeating you
like a true Banjo player.

1693
02:03:07,801 --> 02:03:09,906
So I returned you: Banjo.

1694
02:03:11,034 --> 02:03:12,604
Go on, play.

1695
02:03:13,234 --> 02:03:15,805
If you stop play,
who is going to be my competitor'?

1696
02:03:17,134 --> 02:03:18,807
I will he hack soon.

1697
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:20,838
I will he hack soon.

1698
02:03:21,168 --> 02:03:23,079
And I will come prepared.

1699
02:03:24,101 --> 02:03:28,049
And I sWealml will defeat you.

1700
02:03:31,134 --> 02:03:32,169
See you.

1701
02:03:32,334 --> 02:03:34,041
If that's true, then...

1702
02:03:38,167 --> 02:03:39,612
Take this with you.

1703
02:03:40,301 --> 02:03:42,144
Someone gave this to me once.

1704
02:03:42,901 --> 02:03:46,041
She said then-is a
true Banjo playel in me.

1705
02:03:47,967 --> 02:03:50,675
For the filst time I
saw a Banjo player in you.

1706
02:03:53,101 --> 02:03:54,239
This is fol that.

1707
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,570
Forgive me.

1708
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,009
Forgive me.

1709
02:04:23,567 --> 02:04:25,103
Chris was right.

1710
02:04:25,734 --> 02:04:28,146
We earned more money with her.

1711
02:04:28,867 --> 02:04:31,040
And we never played for money.

1712
02:04:32,801 --> 02:04:34,678
She Wanted to make one mole song.

1713
02:04:35,067 --> 02:04:38,139
And she thought We could
make a song on 0111 own.

1714
02:04:40,001 --> 02:04:41,912
And We will make that song.

1715
02:04:42,667 --> 02:04:45,807
<i>310ml am leaky .</i>

1716

02:06:11,667 --> 02:06:13,476
Sit, it's them.

1742
02:06:13,901 --> 02:06:15,574
Do you know them?

1743
02:06:16,567 --> 02:06:20,515
They keep asking about you every day.

1744
02:06:26,768 --> 02:06:29,009

Chris would filst perform this,
and then Iecold.

1746
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:38,911
It was hel dleam to perform

1747
02:06:40,667 --> 02:06:42,874
Then consider that Chris

02:06:43,867 --> 02:06:44,971
So What should I do?

1749
02:06:46,767 --> 02:06:48,678
You're facing criminal charges.

1750
02:06:49,167 --> 02:06:52,774
If you Ieplesent us at
the Soho Musical Festival...
