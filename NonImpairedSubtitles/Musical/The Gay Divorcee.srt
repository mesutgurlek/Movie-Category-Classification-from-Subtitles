1
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,429
<i>Don't let it bother you</i>
<i>When things go wrong</i>

2
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:23,872
<i>If you're glum, just hum</i>
<i>And some good luck will come along</i>

3
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,406
<i>Don't let it bother you</i>
<i>If now and then</i>

4
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:34,212
<i>You may stumble, never grumble</i>
<i>Count from one to 10</i>

5
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:39,347
- A</i> <i>frown is a smile upside down</i>
- <i>So turn that frown upside down</i>

6
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:44,896
<i>And smile</i>
<i>And sing oh-la-la-la</i>

7
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:49,558
<i>Don't let it bother you</i>
<i>If skies are gray</i>

8
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,704
<i>Learn to grin</i>
<i>And take it on the chin</i>

9
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,396
<i>Then everything will be okay</i>

10
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,399
Oh, it's no use, Guy.
Mine has housemaid's knee.

11
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,129
Don't be discouraged, Egbert.

12
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:04,037
I think you show distinct tendencies
towards terpsichorean excellence.

13
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,770
You think so, really?
You know, as a matter of fact...

14
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:11,042
...my inner soul has always yearned
to express itself in the dance.

15
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,380
- lf you were I, what would you do?
- Stick to law.

16
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,254
Spoken like a real native.
Do you recognize it?

17
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,918
No.

18
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,391
What? Oh, yes.

19
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,298
Oh, my, Guy,
this is an expensive place here.

20
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,978
Guy, in the excitement of changing
my clothes on that train...

21
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,944
...I left my wallet in that other suit.

22
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,949
Egbert, what would you do without me?

23
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,084
I mean to say...

24
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,788
I've been in America
for several months with my friend.

25
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,128
We're passing through Paris on our way
to London. We're taking the boat tomorrow.

26
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,438
I am the proprietor.
What can I do for you?

27
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:12,135
Well, I'm afraid we'll have to mail you
the amount of the check.

28
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,605
Well, monsieur, I do not know you.

29
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,416
This gentleman's father
is Sir Frederick Fitzgerald...

30
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,677
...the distinguished London attorney.

31
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,947
Yes, and I'm a lawyer too.

32
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,784
You, monsieur?

33
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,227
My friend here is Guy Holden,
the American dancer.

34
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,230
Musical comedy and whatnot.
Certainly you've heard of Holden.

35
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,392
Oh, yes, I have heard of Guy Holden.

36
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,937
But, monsieur, have you any means
of identification?

37
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,100
Well, you see, we...

38
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,112
Left them in the other suit.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

39
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,210
Well, I...

40
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,909
I have it, I have it.

41
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,022
Look here, old chap,
if my friend dances like Guy Holden...

42
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,920
...that proves he is Guy Holden,
doesn't it?

43
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,091
Go ahead, Guy, dash them off
a bit of a minuet...

44
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,787
...or a polka or a schottische.

45
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:10,231
Now, wait a minute, I'm on my vacation.
I'm not going to do any dancing.

46
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,404
I've heard they make you
wash dishes in Paris.

47
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,515
There you are.

48
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,212
That means nothing.

49
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,414
Then you try it.

50
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,123
Suppose you do it over there.

51
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,856
- With all these people around?
- Well, if you are Guy Holden...

52
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,330
...people should not disturb you.

53
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,901
No.

54
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,800
French cooking must make the dishes
very difficult to wash.

55
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,159
Guy, never mind.

56
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,266
Thank you.

57
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,893
Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald.

58
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,464
Mr. Fitzgerald.

59
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,000
- Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Who is it? What's the matter?

60
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,261
What do you want?

61
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,665
- Mr. Fitzgerald?
- Yes.

62
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,205
- Mr. Pinky Fitzgerald?
- Yes.

63
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,707
Pinky? That's the first time
I've heard that one.

64
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,677
Must be from Father.
He's always called me Pinky.

65
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:12,250
Ever since I was a golden-haired little tot
paddling about in pale-pink pajamas.

66
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,386
What do you want?
Tip that boy, will you?

67
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,022
Read that for me.
I'm all involved here, Guy, please.

68
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,419
- Thank you, governor.
- Right you are.

69
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,654
Yes, it's from your father. He says:

70
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:27,322
"Leaving for Scotland. Stop.
Take charge of office in my absence. Stop."

71
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,627
Good. Father's placing everything
in my hands.

72
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,293
But I haven't finished yet. He also says:

73
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,634
"But don't do anything, just sit."

74
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,207
Let me see that.

75
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,539
Why, Pinky, evidently you've been
in charge of the office before.

76
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,181
- Excuse me. Can you help me in section D?
- What is it?

77
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,146
- I can't do a thing with her, sir.
- Who?

78
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,411
The lady in section D, sir.
She's an American.

79
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,521
You know how these Americans are, sir.

80
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,419
- When finished, look after that gentleman.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,583
Will you gentlemen come with me, please?

82
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,922
Excuse me, madam, I am the chief
inspector. Anything I can do for you?

83
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,363
You most certainly can.

84
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,298
This man wants to mess up my trunks...

85
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,166
...after I've packed the lovely things
I bought in Paris.

86
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,138
I'm very sorry, madam,
but we have to inspect all luggage...

87
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,504
...for dutiable merchandise.

88
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,579
Now, madam, how much
did you pay for this?

89
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,716
That? Oh, now, how much
did I pay for that?

90
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:21,375
I know I paid an awful lot. But I shouldn't
be telling you that, should I?

91
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:25,581
- Where did you buy it?
- Where did I buy it? Oh, now, let me see.

92
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,022
What was the name of that town?

93
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:34,390
- Paris?
- Paris? No. No, it wasn't Paris.

94
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,664
- Lyons?
- No. No, it wasn't Lyons...

95
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,771
...but you're getting warmer.

96
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,441
- Nice?
- Niece. Yes, that's who I'm waiting for.

97
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,977
- What?
- Yes, my niece, Mimi.

98
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,480
I sent her a cable to London
and told her to meet me here.

99
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,449
- Where is she?
- I'm sure I don't know, madam.

100
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,680
This is the only other place
she might be.

101
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,827
Oh, there she is.
Thank you very much.

102
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,394
- Hortense.
- Mimi, dear.

103
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,758
How are you?
Oh, you look perfectly marvelous.

104
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,194
Yes, don't I.

105
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,562
This is my niece, Mimi.
I told you about her.

106
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,000
The poor thing has had her life
all mixed up...

107
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,630
...but I've come over expressly
to straighten it all out for her.

108
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,870
Madam, we would appreciate it
if you'd straighten this matter out first.

109
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,844
Well, what is it you want me to do?

110
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,849
Come with me and we'll make
a declaration of all your purchases.

111
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,452
Everything's so topsy-turvy.

112
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,919
Will you put those things in
while I lock this?

113
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,318
- These?
- Yes, please.

114
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,688
Would you be good enough
to hold this for me? Thank you.

115
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,887
- Did you have a nice trip?
- I had a marvelous trip. I adore Paris.

116
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,431
It's so like Chicago.
I enjoyed every minute of it.

117
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,869
It's such a relief when you're traveling
to feel that you've never left home at all.

118
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,742
I shouldn't be long, dear.
Come along, men.

119
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,398
Porter. Porter.

120
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,594
- Oh, porter.
- Sorry, I'm busy, ma'am.

121
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,932
Porter.

122
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,278
Oh, porter. Porter.

123
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,880
Porter.

124
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:38,512
Porter. Porter.

125
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,450
Porter.

126
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,989
I beg your pardon.
Can I be of any assistance?

127
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,896
Why... Well, yes.

128
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,366
My aunt is in the inspector's office.
Would you call her for me?

129
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,902
- Well, yes, indeed.
- Thank you.

130
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,539
With pleasure.

131
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,640
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.

132
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:06,045
- So am I.
- So is my aunt.

133
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,880
You know, the one you were
going to call for me.

134
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,578
Oh, yes.

135
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,657
Is there anything special
you want me to tell her?

136
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,227
Well, you might tell her
that my dress is caught.

137
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,836
Your dress is caught.

138
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,133
My, my.

139
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,833
- Locked.
- Yes.

140
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,602
And you want me to call your aunt?

141
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,937
Yes.

142
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,745
You know, a third party
might spoil this.

143
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,818
Porter. Oh, porter.

144
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,784
Oh, porter. Porter.

145
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,389
There's no reason why I can't
handle this myself.

146
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,027
I pulled a cat out of a well once
when I was a boy.

147
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,924
Now, let me see...

148
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,161
- Maybe I should've called your aunt.
- Well...

149
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,034
Oh, I'm awfully sorry. Please take this.

150
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,379
- Please forgive me.
- I'm living in London.

151
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,242
Where can I return this to you?

152
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:15,581
Oh, I'm stopping in London too.
May I save you the trouble and call for it?

153
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,722
I'd rather you wouldn't.

154
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,524
Well, here's my address.

155
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,290
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

156
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,136
- You didn't say goodbye.
- No, I didn't.

157
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,205
Well, that's wonderful.
That means I'll see you again.

158
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,415
I'll pay it, but I want to know
how every cent is spent.

159
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,881
Oh, here you are, Hortense.

160
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,043
I just had the most embarrassing
experience.

161
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,688
A man tore my dress off.

162
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,120
My goodness. Anyone we know?

163
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,420
- Hortense.
- Here you are, madam.

164
00:14:56,595 --> 00:15:00,622
Oh, for me? And I do adore fruit baskets.

165
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,791
Oh, isn't he generous.
You shouldn't have been so extravagant.

166
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,733
After all, we've just met, you know.

167
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,739
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Have you time for an encore?

168
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,104
- Sorry, guvnor. My time's too valuable.
- Oh, so sorry.

169
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,404
Don't you want to ask me
who sent that, sir?

170
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,379
Oh, I see, the play spirit.
All right, tell me. Who sent it?

171
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,850
The young lady gave me 3 shillings,
sir, and asked me not to tell.

172
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:03,452
Oh, yes. I see.
"And asked me not to tell."

173
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,560
- Guy.
- Yeah?

174
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,462
- Package for you.
- A package?

175
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,433
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's my raincoat.

176
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,870
That must be her handwriting.

177
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,905
Let me see.
I used to study handwriting.

178
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,543
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's very neat.

179
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,612
Yes. The O's and the A's are open.
That means extravagance.

180
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,510
Look at the way she crosses her T's.
That denotes temper.

181
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:29,143
She makes little circles instead of dots.
Dreadful. It's an unfailing sign of vanity.

182
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,881
Yes. Of course, don't let me
discourage you. l...

183
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,754
Guy, what is the matter with you?
You seem to be under some sort of a spell.

184
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,988
I am, and for the first time in my life.

185
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,960
What are you looking for?

186
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,328
- Where's the note?
- Oh, no note.

187
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,935
- No note?
- No note.

188
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,038
- Did you talk to the messenger?
- I did.

189
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:51,165
And he said that she asked him
not to tell where it came from.

190
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,836
I wonder if she resented
my tearing her skirt.

191
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,006
Well, I wouldn't be at all surprised.
That's the usual reaction.

192
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,209
- What did you do that for?
- She couldn't move.

193
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,912
Sounds very unsporting of you.
Guy, really.

194
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,024
Well, you don't understand.
You see, she... It was an accident.

195
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,787
- It usually is. What's her name?
- I don't know.

196
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,693
- Where does she live?
- I don't know.

197
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,900
My, what an interesting romance.

198
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:20,471
I was in hopes that she'd send some note
with this raincoat, along with her address.

199
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,437
Well, without having the prophetic powers
of a seventh son...

200
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,067
...I would hazard that she doesn't want
to see you anymore.

201
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,008
Yes. Well...

202
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,845
...I'm going to rush off
to the office.

203
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,849
- What are you going to do, Guy?
- I'm going to start looking for her.

204
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,992
I'll find that girl, Egbert,
if it takes me from now on.

205
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,320
Well, it shouldn't be difficult. After all,
there are only 3 million women in London.

206
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:03,009
<i>It's just like looking for a needle</i>
<i>In a hay stack</i>

207
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,980
<i>Searching for a moonbeam in the blue</i>

208
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,846
<i>Still, I've gotta find you</i>

209
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:18,290
<i>It's just like looking for a raindrop</i>
<i>In the ocean</i>

210
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:22,594
<i>Searching for a dewdrop in the dew</i>

211
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,761
<i>Still, I've got to find you</i>

212
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,907
<i>I'll roam the town</i>
<i>In hopes that we'll meet</i>

213
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,569
<i>Look at each face</i>
<i>I pass on the street</i>

214
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,410
<i>For sometimes I hear</i>
<i>The beat of your feet</i>

215
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,746
<i>But it's just imagination</i>

216
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:49,589
<i>Oh, it's like looking for a needle</i>
<i>In a haystack</i>

217
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,060
<i>Still, I'll follow every little clue</i>

218
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,962
<i>'Cause I've got to find you</i>

219
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:05,107
<i>It's just like looking for a needle</i>
<i>In a haystack</i>

220
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:09,441
<i>Searching for a moonbeam in the blue</i>

221
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,641
<i>Still, I've got to find you</i>

222
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:20,418
<i>It's just like looking for a raindrop</i>

223
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,926

224
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,692

225
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:34,270
<i>I'll roam the town</i>

226
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:38,102

00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,982
<i>But it's just imagination</i>

229
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:51,750
<i>Though it's like looking for a needle</i>
<i>In a haystack</i>

230
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:56,122
<i>Still, I'll follow every little clue</i>

231
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,095
<i>'Cause I've gotta find you</i>

232
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,178
Hello, hello.

233
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,016
I've been looking for you.

234
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,649
Well, wait a minute.

235
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,862
Please stop. I want to talk to you.

236
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,825
Isn't it peaceful here?

237
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,927
Would you mind moving your car,
or don't you want it anymore?

238
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,036
Yes, Guy, it is peaceful, isn't it?

239
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,307
What a shame.
Two perfectly beautiful cars.

240
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,534
In a moment,
the air will be full of fenders.

241
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,440
Wait. Would you mind hitting it
just about there?

242
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,979
That cigarette lighter
never did work anyway.

243
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,674
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

244
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,418
Porter. Porter.

245
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,959
Can't do it.
I guess I'm too economical.

246
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,541
Now there.
Can I offer you something?

247
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,908
Frosted chocolate, Cointreau,
Benedictine, marriage?

248
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,681
What was that last?

249
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,653
- Benedictine.
- No, after that.

250
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,288
Oh, marriage.

251
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,323
Do you always propose marriage
as casually as that?

252
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,825
There's nothing casual about it.
I've given it a lot of sincere thought.

253
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,554
Matter of fact, I've lost sleep.

254
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,529
Do you realize I've spent
the last two weeks looking for you?

255
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,066
Didn't you get your coat all right?

256
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,204
Yes, but I missed something.

257
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,866
Some little note telling me
where I could get in touch with you.

258
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,507
I've got to know something
about you:

259
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,580
Whether you're happy,
what flowers you like...

260
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,240
...your favorite books and music.

261
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,783
Look, when do I see you again?

262
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,320
Won't you please tell me
where I can get in touch with you?

263
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,624
You can't.

264
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,926
I'm staying with friends, old friends.

265
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:11,159
You'd be much too upsetting. I wouldn't
know what you were going to do next.

266
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:16,665
Well, if you won't give me
your phone number, here's mine.

267
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,376
Just wasting paper.

268
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,122
I thought you were economical.

269
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,528
That's better.

270
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,062
May I go now?

271
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,832
All right. But you will try
and call me tomorrow, won't you?

272
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,301
I'll be waiting.

273
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,837
I'll be waiting every day.

274
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,238
And then I'll rest up at night
so I can wait some more.

275
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,879
I say, old chap, do you mind
letting us through here?

276
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,418
Oh, rather. Right you are. Cheerio.

277
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,817
Right you are, sorry.
Awfully sorry, folks. Right.

278
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,461
I bought this in a sporting goods store.

279
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,506
Wait. You didn't tell me your name.

280
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,108
Mimi.

281
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,514
Mimi?

282
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,282
Mimi.

283
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,865
- I'll tell Mr. Fitzgerald you're here, Mrs...
- Thank you very much.

284
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,731
Hortense, it's hopeless.
I don't know why we're here.

285
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,070
Darling, Egbert's
a very old friend of mine.

286
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,271
He doesn't know much about law.
It's his father who's the brains.

287
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:07,145
You know, all of his family
spent their entire lives at the bar.

288
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,750
Dear Egbert. He was nearly
my third husband.

289
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:16,792
He would have been, too, but he suddenly
left for India on an elephant hunt.

290
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:22,662
I wonder why he preferred to hunt elephants
when he could've married me.

291
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,633
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ditherwell, Mr. Fitzgerald
doesn't seem to recall your name.

292
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,673
Why, what do you mean, he doesn't?

293
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,571
Oh, of course, I've been married again.
He wouldn't know me as Ditherwell.

294
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,910
That was my third husband, my last.
Now, let me see.

295
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,280
What name did Egbert know me by?

296
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,921
Hortense, darling.

297
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,058
I didn't marry in 1929 or '30.

298
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,592
That was the year of the crash. Men
didn't know whether they had money.

299
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,094
Well... Well, I tell you
just what you say.

300
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:57,257
You say "peanuts." He'll know.

301
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,004
- Peanuts?
- Yes.

302
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,766
You know, the association of ideas.

303
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,708
Peanut, elephant. Elephant hunt, me.

304
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:12,248
- I'll tell him "peanuts," madam.
- Yes.

305
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,992
Yes, yes, yes.

306
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,126
She said to say, "peanuts."

307
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,496
Oh, did she?
Well, tell her I don't want any.

308
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:38,072
She also mentioned something about India.
Elephant hunting.

309
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,068
Well, that makes it,
"peanuts, India, elephant hunt."

310
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,443
That doesn't make sense. Horte...

311
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,880
Oh, no. No, it couldn't be.
Tell her I'm not here.

312
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,918
Tell her I'm in conference.
Tell her I'm out of town.

313
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,450
Egbert, darling.

314
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,357
Oh, darling.

315
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,120
Oh, you mustn't mind him.
He's so impetuous.

316
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,855
You do look wonderful,
and you look just the same.

317
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,262
The same sweet smile,
and the same dear little eyes.

318
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,795
I want you to meet my niece,
Mrs. Glossop.

319
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,959
Mrs. Glossop.

320
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,231
- How do you do, Mrs. Glossop?
- How do you do?

321
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,171
- Glad to know you.
- Thank you. Well, yes. Sit down.

322
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,571
- Sit down.
- Yes, thank you.

323
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,212
I'm here professionally, Egbert.

324
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,008
This poor little thing is married,
unhappily married.

325
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,844
Now, isn't that criminal?

326
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,315
It's no crime to be married.

327
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,115
Just shows a weakness on the part
of men that women take advantage of.

328
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,952
Egbert, are you proposing to me again?

329
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,686
No, no, no.

330
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,425
Mrs. Glossop, I presume, has a problem.

331
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,624
Yes, I have.

332
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:41,829
There are so many things in connection
with it that I hardly know where to begin.

333
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,770
- Oh, well...
- Sit down, Egbert.

334
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,501
I'll tell him all about it.

335
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,512
You see, she's been married two years
and she's scarcely ever seen her husband.

336
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,550
In fact, she never hears from him
unless he wants some of her money.

337
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,185
I met him at school.
He was one of my instructors.

338
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,587
Yes, he's a geometrist.

339
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,556
Oh, a geometrist.

340
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,959
- No, darling, a geologist.
- Oh, a geologist.

341
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,394
Well, all right, a geologist.

342
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,831
What difference does it make?
It's all the same.

343
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,936
- You know, rocks and things.
- He threw them?

344
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:20,235
No, he digs them, he digs them.

345
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,808
Well, have you asked your husband
for a divorce?

346
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,009
Repeatedly, but he refuses to even
discuss it with me.

347
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,017
Well, you understand that
obtaining a divorce in England...

348
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,389
...is a very difficult thing,
unless the husband agrees to grant it.

349
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,660
Oh, Egbert, I didn't know you like dolls.

350
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,072
He always had the mother instinct.

351
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:58,672
Ladies, as your legal adviser,
I would suggest that we resort to a...

352
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,178
- Thingamajig.
- Flagrante delicto.

353
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,344
- Why? Yes, yes, of course.
- Yes, yes.

354
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,820
You know, I had one
at my second divorce.

355
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,959
Yes. Of course, Mrs. Glossop...

356
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,992
...the details are very simple.

357
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:15,724
- A seaside hotel and...
- Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll do anything you say.

358
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,130
And leave the further details
to the two of you.

359
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,204
I think really it would be
much better for me if you remained.

360
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,967
No, no, run along, dear.
I'll fix everything.

361
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,476
Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald,
and I feel very comfortable in your hands.

362
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:32,707
Really? Well, Mrs. Glossop,
I'll work my brain to the bone for you.

363
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,284
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

364
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,059
Now, let's get right down to business.

365
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,657
Oh, Egbert.

366
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,496
I mean the hotel.

367
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,298
I know a very nice one
just opening at Brightbourne.

368
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,441
It's the hotel Bella Vista.

369
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,803
Oh, Bella Vista,
and so easy to remember.

370
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,811
I had a cook named Bella once,
or was it a masseur?

371
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,074
Well, anyway, I'll have my niece
drive down...

372
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,013
...and she'll meet you there tomorrow
at the Hotel Maryland.

373
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,813
No, no, no, that wasn't it, was it?

374
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,354
But it had something to do with
a girl's name.

375
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,388
Perhaps you'd better take this with you.

376
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,395
The Bella Vista. Of course.
That's what I said in the first place, isn't it?

377
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,361
Oh, goodbye, Egbert.

378
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:28,096
You know, divorces make me
so sentimental.

379
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,133
Don't you wish it was ours?

380
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,908
Yes, miss.

381
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,581
I understand, miss.

382
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,275
- Who was it? A man or woman?
- A lady, sir.

383
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,943
- Did she give you a message?
- Yes, sir.

384
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,885
Well, what is it, what is it? Tell me.

385
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,719
It's no use getting excited, sir.
It was the wrong number.

386
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:55,123
Well, get everything ready. Hurry, hurry.
I'm leaving for the seashore immediately.

387
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,164
What, did another woman
propose to you?

388
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,133
Yes, sort of... No, no, no, no.
I've got a case.

389
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,169
- Case of what?
- Oh, dear. A divorce case.

390
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,501
With father out of town,
this is my opportunity.

391
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,769
- I'm going to handle it all myself.
- That will be good.

392
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,074
Yes. Hurry, man. Pack my things.

393
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,875
And Mr. Guy's also, sir?

394
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,449
What's he got to do with it?

395
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,018
Of course, a splendid idea.
You've got to come along.

396
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,747
Change will do you good.
You look a little liverish.

397
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:22,484
It isn't liver, sir. It's love, sir.

398
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,422
I can't leave London.
I'm waiting for a telephone call.

399
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,000
Guy, you're not pining for that girl?

400
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:37,470
Pining? Men don't pine. Girls pine.

401
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,075
Men just...

402
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,234
...suffer.

403
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,377
Guy, she hasn't called you in
over a fortnight.

404
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,848
It's perfectly obvious
that she's not interested.

405
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,455
You pulled her gown.
She pulled your leg.

406
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,789
- Maybe you're right.
- Of course.

407
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,426
I never waited two minutes
for a girl in my life...

408
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,858
...and here I've waited two weeks
for this one.

409
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,032
- Where are we going?
- Brightbourne, a marvelous hotel.

410
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,498
To the Hotel Mabel...
The Margaret... The Nellie...

411
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,229
Confound that woman.
Why did she come back into my life?

412
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,169
It doesn't make any difference.
The change will do you good.

413
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,571
Sea air, sunshine, gaiety, girls.

414
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,193
<i>You're my type</i>
<i>Of a shy type of a beau, dear</i>

415
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,355
Beg pardon?

416
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,899
<i>So let's do things</i>

417
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,058
Well, really.

418
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,534
<i>I'll teach you a few things</i>

419
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,694
Are you talking to me?

420
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:45,639
<i>Now, who said just what you said</i>
<i>For I know, dear</i>

421
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,573
No, no, I've been reading. Look here.

422
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,646
<i>I'm not bashful</i>
<i>I'm mashful and pashful</i>

423
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,112
I'm beginning to sense that.

424
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:57,050
<i>When you're near I feel</i>
<i>So let's play house-y</i>

425
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:01,419
<i>Oh, you make me feel</i>
<i>So Mickey Mouse-y</i>

426
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,685
For a well-known lawyer,
at a place like this...

427
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:09,026
<i>You're sweet and so agreeable</i>
<i>And I feel so gosh-oh-geeable</i>

428
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,864
<i>Do warm me or I'll freeze</i>
<i>And let's k-nock k-nees</i>

429
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:19,271
<i>You are so bill and coo-able</i>
<i>And I'm so l-love-you-able</i>

430
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,308
<i>Come cuddle closer, please</i>

431
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,276
<i>And let's k-nock k-nees</i>

432
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,505
Is this sort of a game?

433
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,778
<i>They say make hay while the sun shines</i>

434
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,147
It's an agricultural term.

435
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:35,224
<i>So let's, oh, let's make hey-hey-hey</i>
<i>While the moon shines</i>

436
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,724
<i>My heart's so tick-tock-tick-able</i>

437
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,386
<i>Your lips are so lipstick-able</i>

438
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:45,161
<i>You know your ABCs</i>
<i>So let's k-nock k-nees</i>

439
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,860
Oh, Guy...

440
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:48,163
Never mind.

441
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:53,402
<i>It's so incomprehensible</i>
<i>It doesn't seem quite sensible</i>

442
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:58,675
<i>And yet I like it</i>
<i>Please, let's knock knees</i>

443
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:03,650
<i>It's almost hoi polloi-able</i>
<i>And yet it's quite enjoyable</i>

444
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,915
<i>Oh, I'm full of rhapsody</i>

445
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,854
Too many people here.

446
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:14,054
<i>Tripping, skipping, lightly bounding</i>

447
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:19,602
- <i>Stop it, knock it</i>
- <i>Really, this is most astounding</i>

448
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,330
<i>It makes one feel so thrill-able</i>

449
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,906
<i>Well, we've exhausted every syllable</i>

450
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,873
<i>I crave frivolity</i>

451
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,672
I've got one. Let's k-nock...

452
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,931
<i>Let's knock knees</i>

453
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,000
<i>Let's knock knees</i>

454
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,129
Hello, hello.

455
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,166
Thank you, thank you.

456
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,867
Well, I've been looking all over for you.

457
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,676
- Just dancing.
- Oh, is that what it was?

458
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,823
This is a marvelous place, isn't it, Guy?

459
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,586
Remind me to come down here the next
time I want my constitution undermined.

460
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,888
I think it's wonderful.

461
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,991
Oh, what is the matter with you?
Are you still moping over that same girl?

462
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,897
Why, the world is just full of girls.

463
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,060
I know, I know, but not like her.

464
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,571
She's music.
She's the buzzing of the bees in clover.

465
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,006
She's the rustle of the leaves
in the trees.

466
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,908
She's water lapping on the shore.

467
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,040
Yes. She sounds like
a series of strange noises to me.

468
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,915
Well, cheer up, Guy, cheer up.

469
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,352
You may chance across her
again some time.

470
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,116
I know I will.

471
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,091
And when I do,
it won't be chance.

472
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,026
Chance is the fool's name for fate.

473
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,465
What was that last?
"Chance is the fool's name for fate"?

474
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,901
Guy, that's marvelous.
Where did you get it?

475
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,301
Where did I get it?

476
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,909
It's just a line from my last show,
that's all.

477
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,302
It's wonderful.
Make a good title for a song.

478
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,041
<i>Chance is the fool's name for fate, my lad</i>
<i>Chance...</i>

479
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:30,551
Do you mind if I use it? Come in handy,
you know, to shoot into a conversation.

480
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,813
Go ahead, spring it on your father.
It may encourage him about you.

481
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,024
"Chance is the fool's name for fate."
I'll have to remember that.

482
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,597
I love the place.

483
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,204
Oh, if Father could only see...

484
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:53,867
...with what éclat I am upholding
the professional dignity of the firm.

485
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,376
Guy, I'm going to stay here
and wait for my client.

486
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,412
Without me, Egbert.
I'm going to my room.

487
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,107
- I'll see you later.
- Well, I'll be here.

488
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,345
Pardon, you rang, sir?

489
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,550
Who, me? Why, my dear fellow,
what is there here to ring with?

490
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,922
Pardon, sir, that's just a figure of speech.

491
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:20,335
Well, bring me...
Let me have a...

492
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,228
There. There, you see?

493
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:26,069
Your figure of speech has made me
forget entirely what I wanted.

494
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,870
Could it have been
that you required crumpets, sir?

495
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,040
No, no, no. I never ring for crumpets.

496
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:41,354
Would you be the kind of man
who'd ring for a toasted scone, sir?

497
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,855
Scone? Well, now...

498
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,055
No, no, try me again.

499
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,732
Well, then, can you imagine yourself...

500
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,199
...with a hankering
for a nice gooseberry tart?

501
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,464
Oh, what an acid thought. Please.

502
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:02,536
No crumpets, no scones,
no gooseberry tart.

503
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,639
Well, that lands both of us
in a cul-de-sac, doesn't it, sir?

504
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,314
Of course it does. I knew it would.

505
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,618
You know, I hate to leave you like this.

506
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,155
You, torn with doubts...

507
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,419
...and me with my duty undischarged.

508
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,393
Oh, well, cheer up, old man, cheer up.
It will come to me.

509
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,769
Was it animal or vegetable, sir?

510
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,460
No.

511
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:31,599
Well, that leaves us mineral, doesn't it, sir?

512
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,337
Now, sir, was it a bit of half-and-half?

513
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,037
A noggin of ale...

514
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,910
...a pipkin of porter...

515
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,915
...a stoup of stout...

516
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,714
...or a beaker of beer?

517
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,449
Tea.

518
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:55,924
Tea? Well, isn't it a small world, sir?

519
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,612
- Hello, Mrs. Glossop.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Fitzgerald.

520
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:16,913
Well, well, well.
All ready for graduation day?

521
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,048
Oh, hello, Egbert.

522
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:21,919
Oh, no. It can't...
Oh, it is. It's a stowaway.

523
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:25,061
I thought you might forget something,
so I came down to help you.

524
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,197
So good of you. Yes, yes.

525
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,855
Now, Mrs. Glossop, before you register...

526
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,935
...I'm very anxious to have just a few
last words with you.

527
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:36,595
- Last words?
- Yes, if you don't mind. Right here.

528
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,206
Thank you. Now...

529
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,536
Oh, Egbert.

530
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,339
Pardon.

531
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,913
Yes. Now...

532
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,712
I have come to the conclusion
that to expedite matters...

533
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,946
...it will be necessary for someone
to discover you with someone...

534
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:55,216
...other than your husband.
Just as a matter of form, of course.

535
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,924
Hortense, I don't think I can go
through with it.

536
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,462
Now, don't be silly. Get it over with.

537
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:04,965
Think of Cyril Glossop. Think hard.

538
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,534
I knew that would do it.

539
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,732
Good. Now, the young man
is on his way here.

540
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,934
You understand, of course,
it wouldn't be technically correct...

541
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,841
...for me to introduce you.
He will present himself to you.

542
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,983
Then we'll need a password.
It's too mysterious and wonderful.

543
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,118
Well, I have the password. I have it.

544
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:26,780
The young man will say to you,
"Chance is the fool's name for fate."

545
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,424
Shakespeare?

546
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,617
Nothing of the kind.
It's a thing of my own.

547
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,928
"Chance is the fool's name for fate."

548
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,565
Good. That's just it. Yes.

549
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,634
Now, it will be necessary
for you to have a name.

550
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:43,239
A name, of course, yes.
So your name will be Mrs. Green.

551
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,341
Green. I do adore green.

552
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,535
And, you know, the oculists say
it's very soothing to the eye.

553
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,441
Oh, Egbert, are you coming with us?

554
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,640
Why, Hortense. Oh, my, no.
You can't remain with her.

555
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,808
This is supposed to be
a clandestine affair.

556
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,580
You can't have a clandestine affair
between three people.

557
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,621
That's what you say.

558
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,444
By any chance, are you Mr. Tonetti?

559
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:32,117
Rudolfo Tonetti at your service.

560
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,756
Yes. Well, I am Mr. Fitzgerald.

561
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,628
Mr. Fitzgerald? I am delightful.

562
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,663
I shouldn't doubt it, old man.
I shouldn't doubt it.

563
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,995
But don't you think a corespondent
ought to come to work quietly?

564
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,137
Let's have more repose
and less <i>Rigoletto.</i>

565
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,671
I am ready for action
and I will do a first-class job.

566
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,105
Well, don't be too determined about it.

567
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:57,008
The lady in question is very sensitive
and you must treat her accordingly.

568
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,449
Whichever way the wind,
she is blowing, that is the way I sail.

569
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:04,519
- Yes. Well, sit down.
- Pardon, your tea, sir.

570
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,693
Your life, Mr. Tonetti...

571
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,354
...must be full of excitement.

572
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,397
Full of excitement and full of danger.

573
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,560
- Oh, yes, of course, from the husbands.
- No, from the ladies.

574
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:22,034
Oh, how interesting.

575
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,572
But, Tonetti, he know what to do.

576
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,006
Yes, sometimes the lady and I
have the conversations.

577
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,770
Sometimes I play the concertina.

578
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:34,577
Sometimes I play the solitaire,
but mostly I practice my singing.

579
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:39,381
At home, my wife
do not like me to sing.

580
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,316
Unquestionably, a woman
of great perspicacity.

581
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,287
You bet.

582
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:53,269
You're absolutely sure, Mr. Tonetti,
that my client will be safe?

583
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:57,635
Oh, <i>signor,</i> with me, strictly business.

584
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,173
My slogan:

585
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:03,939
"Your wife is safe with Tonetti.
He prefer spaghetti."

586
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,216
Now, listen.

587
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,353
- I'll give you the password.
- Yes.

588
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,647
When you see the lady,
you must go to her...

589
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:18,193
...and say, "Chance is
the fool's name for fate."

590
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,990
- "Chance is the foolish name..."
- "For fate."

591
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:23,394
"The fool's name for fate."

592
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,365
Yes. Well, tell me, please,
what she mean?

593
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,505
Well, you have to have some method.
You have to... When you...

594
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,573
Who? Oh, never mind.

595
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,972
- Never mind what it means. Just say it.
- Yes.

596
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,339
Now, Tonetti, remember...

597
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,914
...I want delicacy, tact,
assurance, finesse.

598
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,111
I have brought everything.

599
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:48,148
And now, <i>con permesso,</i> I go inside
to make the telephone call...

600
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,453
...to tell my wife I am safely arrive.

601
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,360
"Fate is no fooling..." No.

602
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,800
"Chances are a foolish..."
Oh, <i>scusi,</i> please.

603
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,941
"Taking the name of a foolish..."

604
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,311
Pardon, ma'am,
can I be of service to you?

605
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:13,613
I doubt it.

606
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,685
Let me have the menu.
I'm waiting for my niece.

607
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,579
What have you?

608
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,122
Crumpets, ma'am.

609
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,852
That's too bad, isn't it.
Does it run in the family?

610
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,528
Begging your pardon, ma'am,
but that's very "whumsical."

611
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,860
- What?
- Very "whumsical," ma'am.

612
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,504
You know, like Sir James Barrie.

613
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:38,368
You mean "whimsical," don't you?

614
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,305
In a manner of speaking, yes, ma'am.

615
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,707
Why not "whamsical," then?

616
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,110
Pardon, ma'am, but "whumsical" is
much more whimsical than "whamsical."

617
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:52,118
You know, you're beginning to fascinate me
and I resent that in any man.

618
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,517
I'm sorry, ma'am.

619
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,818
Oh, hello, darling.
I was just going to order.

620
00:49:58,595 --> 00:49:59,994
I really can't eat a thing.

621
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,566
But you must eat. After all, you can't
have a divorce on an empty stomach.

622
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,804
What's the matter?

623
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,143
You look as though
you'd seen your husband.

624
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,973
It's Guy Holden,
the man I told you about.

625
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,014
What have you done?
Sent out invitations for this affair?

626
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,348
Well, I didn't know he was here.
Oh, he mustn't see me.

627
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,090
Mimi. Mimi.

628
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,054
Mimi.

629
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,467
I've been chasing after you.
You mustn't run like that.

630
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,542
- Why not?
- It's bad for my health.

631
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,411
What are you doing here?

632
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,104
- Same as you.
- What?

633
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,944
I came down here
looking for pieces of my heart.

634
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:58,019
Oh, no. Mimi, do you know
what I've been doing?

635
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,021
Thinking of you, longing for you,
waiting to hear from you.

636
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,091
I haven't left my telephone.

637
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,787
Well, as I remember it,
you gave me a London number.

638
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,963
Well, I had to come down here
just overnight.

639
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,999
A little business.

640
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:17,230
Oh, yes, I saw quite a few of them
in bathing suits this afternoon.

641
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,274
Oh, no, Mimi. Nothing like that.

642
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,470
Why didn't you at least
just leave some message for me?

643
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,945
- I did.
- You did?

644
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,744
But they said that you'd left London.

645
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,586
Mimi, you did call. That's wonderful.

646
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,121
I'd better leave now.

647
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,589
Please don't go.
It's going to be grand here.

648
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,625
They're having a gala on the esplanade.

649
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,495
It's usually pretty terrible.

650
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,791
But think what it will mean
to miss seeing it.

651
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,230
It's worthwhile staying down here
just to miss it.

652
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,994
Please don't ask me to stay.

653
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,967
All right, I won't.

654
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:52,505
Don't go. I've so many things
to say to you.

655
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,270
<i>Like the beat, beat, beat</i>
<i>Of the tom-tom</i>

656
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,936
<i>When the jungle shadows fall</i>

657
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,549
<i>Like the tick, tick, tock</i>
<i>Of the stately clock</i>

658
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:03,618
<i>As it stands against the wall</i>

659
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,223
<i>Like the drip, drip, drip</i>
<i>Of the raindrops</i>

660
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,950
<i>When the summer shower is through</i>

661
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,387
<i>So a voice within me keeps repeating</i>

662
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,088
<i>"You, you, you"</i>

663
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:21,226
<i>Night and day</i>
<i>You are the one</i>

664
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:27,638
<i>Only you beneath the moon</i>
<i>And under the sun</i>

665
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:31,313
<i>Whether near to me or far</i>

666
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,678
<i>It's no matter, darling</i>
<i>Where you are</i>

667
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:39,982
<i>I think of you</i>
<i>Night and day</i>

668
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:46,224
<i>Day and night</i>
<i>Why is it so</i>

669
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:52,062
<i>That this longing for you</i>
<i>Follows wherever I go?</i>

670
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,130
<i>In the roaring traffic's boom</i>

671
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:59,275
<i>In the silence of my lonely room</i>

672
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:04,812
<i>I think of you</i>
<i>Night and day</i>

673
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:10,886
<i>Night and day</i>
<i>Under the hide of me</i>

674
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:17,050
<i>There's an oh-such-a-hungry yearning</i>
<i>Burning inside of me</i>

675
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:20,594
<i>And its torment</i>
<i>Won't be through</i>

676
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:24,291
<i>Till you let me spend my life</i>
<i>Making love to you</i>

677
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:28,995
<i>Day and night</i>
<i>Night and day</i>

678
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:27,874
Cigarette?

679
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,182
I still don't know
what you're doing down here.

680
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,224
I came down with my aunt.

681
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:45,094
Isn't that a coincidence.
I'm here with my aunt too. Aunt Egbert.

682
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,365
Egbert?

683
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:51,200
Yes, Egbert Fitzgerald,
lawyer friend of mine.

684
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,433
We're down here on a case.

685
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,939
Aren't you ever gonna stop
running away from me?

686
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,810
When two people are destined
to come together as we are...

687
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,179
...there's no use in struggling.

688
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:06,049
Do you believe in that kind of destiny?

689
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:10,249
Of course I do. In these things
there's no such a thing as chance.

690
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:14,022
"Chance is the fool's name for fate."

691
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,601
You?

692
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,431
You?

693
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,745
Me?

694
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,244
Why, yes, of course it is.

695
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,144
So you're the man I've been waiting for.

696
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,116
None other.

697
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,690
I'll be waiting for you
in my room, 216, at midnight.

698
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,880
My dear, it's 12:00.
I feel just like New Year's Eve.

699
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,284
Good luck to you.

700
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,858
Oh, don't leave me.
I can't bear to face him.

701
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,722
He seems so different.

702
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:24,094
Oh, there's nothing different
about any of them except the neckties.

703
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,703
Him, of all people.

704
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,732
Well, aren't you even astonished?

705
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:33,873
Me? Astonished?
I haven't been astonished since I was 8.

706
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:37,376
And mind you, I wasn't precocious,
just moderately intelligent.

707
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:42,450
I'll give him the most miserable night
of his entire business career.

708
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,211
A locked door between us.

709
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:48,088
You seem to be going to a lot of trouble
for a man you hate.

710
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,186
Could anything be more degrading?

711
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,952
Well, after all, my dear...

712
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,596
...a corespondent must be
something of an artist.

713
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,789
He has to have
a sense of balance, you know.

714
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,366
Rather like a mountain goat.

715
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:03,167
Well, I think I'll look up Egbert.

716
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:06,001
The poor darling
must be lost without me.

717
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,220
Oh, you needn't run away.
I knew you were coming here.

718
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:28,060
- You knew?
- Of course. I'm Mimi's aunt.

719
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,927
I know, but I have relatives myself.

720
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,534
This isn't exactly old-home week, is it?

721
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,501
Well, nothing is ever done without me.

722
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:39,174
You're not planning to be there.

723
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:40,741
Well, of course not.

724
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,310
Just a moment, please. You see...

725
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,572
...I don't know Mimi very well.

726
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,511
I wish you'd please tell me about her.

727
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:51,120
Well, I'll let her tell you.
After all, if she has to keep you here...

728
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:54,120
...she'll want something
to talk about, won't she?

729
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,618
Keep me here?

730
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:59,159
Well, she has to.

731
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,092
Say, which one of us is crazy?

732
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,630
Well, it's not me.

733
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,166
All of this is a bit of a shock to me.

734
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,804
Well, your being here
is a bit of a shock to Mimi too.

735
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,872
Yes, but it's Mimi's own doing.

736
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,203
Well, I think it's much better
to have this settled now, at once.

737
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:17,574
And then the poor girl
can start a new life.

738
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:19,806
A new life?

739
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:23,612
Brand-new. She's gonna make
a clean sweep of the old.

740
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,779
- I see.
- Yes. Yes, and you're the broom.

741
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,795
I'll be right out.

742
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,942
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting.

743
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,185
Mimi.

744
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,646
Mimi, there's something I wanna...

745
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,620
...get straight in my mind.
- Yes?

746
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,687
At first you were so shy
and so reserved...

747
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,625
...and then this evening you were...

748
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,526
Well, what was I?

749
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,168
- Lovely.
- Was I?

750
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:24,067
Yes, but that's not
what I'm trying to say.

751
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,401
Well, what are you trying to say?

752
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,841
Well, I'm trying
to describe the shock. You see...

753
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:35,546
Well, that negligee
is charming. Charming.

754
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:38,209
- From Paris, isn't it?
- You ought to know.

755
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,720
You've probably seen plenty of them.

756
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,888
Well, a few, of course.

757
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,961
Of course.

758
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:53,300
But never one like that.
Oh, Mimi...

759
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,834
- Stay where you are.
- What?

760
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:58,599
Keep away from me. Now, will you please
keep your distance and I'll keep mine.

761
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,402
I want you to sit there.

762
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,279
What's the matter with it?

763
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,123
Now, we're going through with this
in a dignified silence.

764
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,615
I'd really prefer it.

765
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,333
It's warm, isn't it?

766
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,573
Do you mind if I recite capitals?

767
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:38,941
- What?
- Capitals of states.

768
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,879
North Dakota: Bismarck.
Wyoming: Cheyenne.

769
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,543
Ohio: Columbus.
It's lots of fun. I used to do it as a boy.

770
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,814
I don't care what you did as a boy.

771
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:51,790
Well, I did nothing as a girl
so there goes my childhood.

772
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,331
- Oh, Mimi...
- Keep your place.

773
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:04,906
Oh, <i>scusi,</i> one moment, please.

774
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:08,407
Give me a name for chance
and I am a fool.

775
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:10,546
Captain. Captain!

776
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:13,273
Maybe I'm a mistake.

777
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,654
Oh, <i>signora.</i>

778
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:22,382
Fate is a foolish thing
to take chances with.

779
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:25,453
So are you.

780
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:30,760
Oh, <i>scusi.</i> You are not the lady.

781
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,578
Stay where you are.

782
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:53,517
Oh, Mimi, I mean to say...

783
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:57,284
...I thought that after the few
lovely moments we've had together that...

784
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,260
How can you have the impudence
to speak of that now?

785
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,761
But I suppose it's just the callousness
of your kind.

786
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,903
- My kind?
- Don't think you fooled me for a moment.

787
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,095
I knew what you were all along.

788
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,071
I knew how you made your living.

789
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:17,110
Oh, I'll admit I'm not proud of it,
but I hope to do better someday.

790
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,044
And in the meantime
it does bring me in a decent income.

791
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:22,184
Some people will do anything for money.

792
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:23,682
It's not as bad as all that.

793
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,185
After all, I bring pleasure
to thousands of people.

794
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,152
Thousands?

795
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:29,848
Yes, tens of thousands.

796
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:33,257
I bring romance to tens of thousands
of shop girls, servant girls...

797
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:37,126
...stenographers.
- You might spare me, Mr. Bluebeard.

798
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,802
Oh, Mimi, if I would...

799
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,805
Are you expecting someone?

800
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,771
Why, of course.

801
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,377
But not till morning.

802
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,312
- Who is it?
- Hortense.

803
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,915
I better get out of here.

804
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:02,719
I have something very,
very important to tell you.

805
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:05,588
Oh, dear, if I only could remember
what it was.

806
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:09,128
- It was something about that man.
- What man?

807
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:13,325
Oh, yes. Are you sure
you have the right one?

808
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:17,466
- Well, he gave me the password.
- Well, I met a man downstairs and he said:

809
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,837
"Fate is a foolish thing
to take chances with." I said, "So are you."

810
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,602
Then he said,
"You're not the lady."

811
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:24,507
Maybe he said, "You're not a lady."

812
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,706
I don't know, my darling.
I was so upset I can't be sure.

813
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:30,408
Oh, wouldn't it be too awful
if I've made a mistake?

814
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:31,848
Go and ask him.

815
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:36,458
But I'll have to confess
that I'm married and why I'm here.

816
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,822
Well, don't ask him then,
but find out everything you can.

817
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,625
But until I'm sure,
well, how shall I treat him?

818
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:47,565
Oh, I don't know. Be feminine and sweet,
if you can blend the two.

819
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:52,868
I really must go and find Egbert again
and tell him all about this.

820
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:57,936
You don't think Egbert is hiding
from me, do you?

821
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,782
May I run along now?

822
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,551
Must you go just yet?

823
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:17,665
Won't you come in
and sit down for a while?

824
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,200
I didn't do so well in here.

825
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:26,069
Well, of course,
if you'd rather stay out there.

826
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,245
Guy...

827
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:37,477
...do you think it was fair
not to tell me something of your work?

828
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:40,884
Well, I've been trying to forget about it.

829
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:43,014
Well...

830
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:47,424
...how did you get started in your career?

831
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:51,532
Oh, I was started by
a very well-known actress.

832
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:57,204
And the thousands
and thousands came later. I see.

833
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:58,601
Oh, well, in a way, yes.

834
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:02,141
You see, she encouraged me
from my very first step.

835
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:05,542
- Very first step?
- Yes.

836
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:10,845
Dance step. I'm a dancer by profession.
You knew that, of course.

837
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:13,587
Do you mind?

838
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,893
Why, no. No, I'm glad.

839
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,620
I'm glad.

840
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:25,397
You know, you're the most emotionally
unstable girl I've ever met.

841
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:35,435
<i>Scusi,</i> lady. I am fate to take
foolish chances with.

842
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,380
Tonetti?

843
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,676
Tonetti.

844
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:48,879
I cannot find the lady.

845
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:52,926
I give everywhere the passwords,
and everywhere I get the slaps.

846
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:57,156
Well, I don't under... Oh, by Jove.
I forgot to tell you the lady's name.

847
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,893
It's Mrs. Green. She's in room 216.

848
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:05,003
And listen, no more prowling around
this hotel like a hyena.

849
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:08,143
And be sure the lady doesn't leave
her room before morning.

850
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,973
Tonetti, he stays, do and die,
until the detective, she arrive.

851
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,241
That's right,
and when the detectives get...

852
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:19,683
Oh, my word,
I forgot all about the detectives.

853
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:24,617
Detectives or no detectives,
Tonetti, he gets paid. Tonetti, I am here.

854
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,317
Well, I'll rush up to London.

855
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,963
I'll bring the detectives
first thing in the morning.

856
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:30,758
Oh, dear.

857
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:35,028
- Egbert.
- Detectives... What?

858
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:38,173
- Where were you going?
- Why? I'm... No. I was just thinking...

859
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,604
- Looking for you.
- Yes, I've been looking for you.

860
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,539
I have something
important to tell you.

861
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,303
Not now. I've gotta rush to London.

862
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,970
No, but I must tell you now.

863
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,776
Yes. Well, what is it?
What is it? What is it?

864
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,613
Well, that's just it.
I can't remember what it is.

865
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,721
Egbert, you're so tempestuous.

866
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:56,016
You drive everything
right out of my head.

867
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,682
I'm sorry, but I can't wait.

868
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,761
- Well, then I'll go to London with you.
- What?

869
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:04,388
And maybe it will come back to me
by the time we get there.

870
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:08,094
Besides, you mustn't ride alone at night.

871
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,205
I'll bet you say that
to every man you marry.

872
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,536
- Oh, Egbert.
- Oh, well, come along, dear. Come along.

873
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:36,128
Aren't the shadows on the sand lovely?

874
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,357
Yes, they are. Lovely.

875
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:40,764
And the light on the water.

876
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:42,733
The edge of the cloud
crossing the moon.

877
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,773
Look, it's coming out.

878
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,571
Look, Guy, it's coming out.

879
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,044
It came out.

880
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:56,742
Oh, isn't it beautiful?

881
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,948
It's a honey.

882
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:03,683
I wonder what causes
that peculiar effect.

883
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:07,090
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

884
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:11,290
Mimi, who is that man
that just went into your room?

885
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,732
- Man?
- I saw a weird-Iooking individual go in there.

886
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,235
How many men
did you invite here tonight?

887
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,430
Mimi, are you married?

888
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,008
- What?
- Is it your husband?

889
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:24,077
- Husband?
- Yes, husb...

890
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:32,984
- Oh, <i>scusi,</i> please, <i>scusi.</i>
- What are you doing here?

891
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:36,124
Chances are that fate is foolish.

892
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:41,963
Will you please stay here just a minute?

893
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:47,730
- It's no one.
- No one?

894
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,666
Mimi, who is it? What's he doing here?

895
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:53,296
Well, he's here on business.

896
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,568
Business?

897
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,645
- Let's look at the moon.
- Not until I throw him out.

898
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,044
No, no, no. You mustn't. Oh, you can't.

899
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:02,979
Well, then please tell me who he is.

900
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:05,443
Well, he...

901
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,081
- I am married.
- You, married?

902
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,920
To a geologist.

903
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,024
Oh, then it is your husband.

904
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:16,391
Oh, no, no.
You see, I'm not really married.

905
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,260
That is, I won't be very long.

906
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,561
I'm getting a divorce right away...

907
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:23,261
...and he's here to help me get it.

908
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,065
Wait a minute.

909
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:30,473
Mimi, are you the women whose divorce
Egbert Fitzgerald is handling?

910
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:37,317
And you thought
I was your corespondent?

911
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:40,754
Oh, but now how could you
possibly think a thing like that?

912
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,587
Well, you said the right words.

913
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:46,387
What right words?

914
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,933
Oh, <i>scusi,</i> please, <i>scusi.</i>

915
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:56,400
Fate is the foolish thing. Take a chance.

916
01:12:57,573 --> 01:13:00,167
Are you the corespondent?

917
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:04,401
Rudolfo Tonetti, at your service.

918
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,776
- You are no longer needed.
- What?

919
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:11,544
I am taking your place.

920
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:14,285
Are you a union man?

921
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,062
Are you hired by Mr. Egbert too?

922
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,221
Oh, Mr. Tonetti, you don't understand.

923
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,425
This gentleman isn't to take your place.
He isn't going to stay.

924
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:29,264
- Then you need me.
- Nothing of the kind. You're intruding.

925
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,735
- Get out of here.
- But, Guy...

926
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,739
Think I'm gonna leave you with an Italian?
He might be a tenor.

927
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,072
Listen.

928
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,979
I was wrong.

929
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,149
- I'm gonna throw him out.
- Oh, but, Guy.

930
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,517
But I have a contract
and I sue for damages.

931
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,555
First for my ear, second for my honor...

932
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,785
...and third...
- Quiet, please, both of you.

933
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:57,261
This is my affair. I'm here for a divorce,
and Mr. Tonetti must stay.

934
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:02,626
Well, if he stays, I stay.
I feel crowded, but that's life.

935
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:08,434
At last my call, she come.
<i>Scusi,</i> please. I answer.

936
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,378
Hello? Oh, hello, hello, Maria.

937
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:18,415
Six times I call you and you are busy.

938
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,316
Gives always:

939
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:23,458
Yes, the busy signal.

940
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,494
Yes, yes, I'm all right.

941
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,819
No, blond.

942
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:32,163
Just a blond.

943
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,495
<i>Scusi, signora,</i> but I talk to the wife.

944
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,764
She want to know all about the lady.

945
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,739
Yes.

946
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:42,775
Yes, kiss the kiddies for me.

947
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,106
What?

948
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,874
What? Maria.

949
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,383
Maria, who is that speaking to you?

950
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,350
What?

951
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,325
What do you think?

952
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:04,797
My little son Rodolfo only 9 years old
and already his voice is changing.

953
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:13,539
Good night, sweetheart.

954
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:19,376
You stay, you do not stay.
Tonetti does not care.

955
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,210
But no monkey business.

956
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:25,911
And the lady must not leave the room
while Tonetti is on the case.

957
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,680
You mean we're prisoners?

958
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:30,120
You don't think I'm going
to take the lady away?

959
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,954
- I will see that you do not.
- That's awfully nice of you.

960
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:36,689
Oh, <i>scusi,</i> maybe you like to play
some three-handed bridge?

961
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,389
- No, thank you.
- No?

962
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:39,932
Not a bit.

963
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:43,070
All right, then I go inside
and play some solitaire.

964
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:47,504
And please remember not to leave.
I watch.

965
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:52,807
- Guy, I don't wanna drag you into this.
- But I wanna be in it. And from now on.

966
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:58,213
You know, I don't think it's gonna be
so bad being kept prisoner here.

967
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,256
Hello, hello.

968
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,850
That doesn't sound
like the prisoners' song to me.

969
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:12,230
That's not a bad tune.

970
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,399
- What is it?
- It's the newest thing here.

971
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,868
- It's called the Continental.
- The Continental?

972
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,266
I like it.

973
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:26,913
That's the second thing I've found
I'd like to take back home with me.

974
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:29,211
Do you know the words?

975
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,821
<i>It's beautiful music</i>

976
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,056
<i>Dangerous rhythm</i>

977
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,728
<i>It's something daring</i>
<i>The Continental</i>

978
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,799
<i>A way of dancing</i>
<i>That's really ultra new</i>

979
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,664
<i>It's very subtle</i>
<i>The Continental</i>

980
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,601
<i>Because it does</i>
<i>What you want it to do</i>

981
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:57,305
<i>It has a passion</i>
<i>The Continental</i>

982
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:59,470
<i>An invitation</i>
<i>To moonlight and romance</i>

983
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:02,549
<i>It's quite the fashion</i>
<i>The Continental</i>

984
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:06,085
<i>Because you tell of your love</i>
<i>While you dance</i>

985
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:10,816
<i>Your lips whisper so tenderly</i>

986
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:14,759
<i>Her eyes answer your song</i>

987
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,524
<i>Two bodies swaying</i>
<i>The Continental</i>

988
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,462
<i>And you are saying</i>
<i>Just what you're dreaming of</i>

989
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,536
<i>So keep on dancing</i>
<i>The Continental</i>

990
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:25,002
<i>For it's a song of romance</i>
<i>And of love</i>

991
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:31,305
<i>You kiss</i>
<i>While you're dancing</i>

992
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,504
That's not a bad idea.

993
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,012
<i>It's Continental</i>

994
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:36,878
<i>It's Continental</i>

995
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:41,113
<i>You sing</i>
<i>While you're dancing</i>

996
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:46,022
<i>Your voice is gentle</i>
<i>And sentimental</i>

997
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:50,790
<i>You stroll together</i>
<i>Arm in arm</i>

998
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:54,925
<i>You nonchalantly glide along</i>
<i>With grace and charm</i>

999
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:59,699
<i>You will find</i>
<i>While you're dancing</i>

1000
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,275
<i>That there's a rhythm</i>
<i>In your heart and soul</i>

1001
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:04,742
<i>A certain rhythm</i>
<i>That you can't control</i>

1002
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:10,078
<i>And you will do the Continental</i>
<i>All the time</i>

1003
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,827
Oh, can't we go down there
and join the fun?

1004
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:28,663
But what if our jailer should catch us?

1005
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:32,000
I forgot all about <i>"scusi,</i> please."

1006
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:42,945
What is it?

1007
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,985
An idea, an idea.

1008
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:49,118
Is this one of those?

1009
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:59,292
I think I know how we can get out of here
without our friend Tonetti missing us.

1010
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:03,237
This is something
I used to do as a boy.

1011
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:08,136
- I don't care what you did as a boy.
- "What you did as a boy." I know.

1012
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,738
This might work, though.

1013
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:14,672
Look, you've got me
cutting out paper dolls.

1014
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,010
Oh, I see.

1015
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,918
Well, I'll go change.

1016
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,870
- That's cute.
- That's beautiful.

1017
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:18,137
Come on.

1018
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:44,507
Look, Mimi. There he is...

1019
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:03,525
<i>Beautiful music</i>

1020
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:08,397
<i>Dangerous rhythm</i>

1021
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,561
<i>It's something daring</i>

1024
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:19,212
<i>Because it does</i>
<i>What you want it to do</i>

1025
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:22,976
<i>It has a passion</i>

1033
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:46,332
<i>So keep on dancing</i>
<i>The Continental</i>

1034
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:48,738
<i>For it's the song</i>
<i>Of romance and of love</i>

1035
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:56,979
<i>You kiss</i>
<i>While you're dancing</i>

1036
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:01,020
<i>The Continental</i>
<i>The Continental</i>

1037
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:05,319
<i>You sing</i>
<i>While you're dancing</i>

1038
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:10,453
<i>Your voice is gentle</i>
<i>So sentimental</i>

1039
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:14,591
<i>You'll know before</i>
<i>The dance is through</i>

1040
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:19,172
<i>That you're in love with she</i>
<i>And she's in love with you</i>

1041
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,436
<i>You'll find</i>
<i>While you're dancing</i>

1042
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:25,738
<i>There's a rhythm</i>
<i>In your heart and soul</i>

1043
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:27,882
<i>A certain rhythm</i>
<i>That you can't control</i>

1044
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:34,045
<i>And you'll do the Continental</i>
<i>All the time</i>

1045
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,941
<i>Dukes and lords</i>
<i>Of noble station</i>

1046
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:44,080
<i>Love the new sophistication</i>
<i>Of the Continental</i>

1047
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:48,320
<i>In a Belgian hall room</i>
<i>In the Monte Carlo ballroom</i>

1048
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:52,489
<i>You will see the Continental</i>

1049
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:57,762
<i>In a Paris bistro</i>
<i>Crowded with apache</i>

1050
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:02,205
<i>You will see the Continental</i>
<i>In the best French fashion</i>

1051
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:06,245
<i>Spain and Italy, Transylvania</i>
<i>Norway, Sweden and Romania</i>

1052
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:10,942
<i>Do the Continental</i>

1053
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,953
<i>On the dikes of Zuider Zee</i>
<i>The wooden shoes have found the key</i>

1054
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:19,082
<i>To Continental</i>

1055
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:24,427
<i>It's like a fever</i>
<i>It's like a plague</i>

1056
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:30,435
<i>It's swept all Europe</i>
<i>From Moscow to The Hague</i>

1057
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:38,973
<i>You kiss</i>
<i>While you're dancing</i>

1058
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,479
<i>The Continental</i>
<i>The rhythm is driving you wild</i>

1059
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,981
<i>The Continental</i>
<i>A meter that isn't so mild</i>

1060
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:49,112
<i>You sing</i>
<i>While you're dancing</i>

1061
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,520
<i>His voice is gentle, it thrills you</i>
<i>The touch of his hand</i>

1062
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:53,991
<i>The Continental</i>
<i>A meter that you understand</i>

1063
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:58,963
<i>You'll know</i>
<i>Before the dance is through</i>

1064
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:03,900
<i>That you're in love with her</i>
<i>And she's in love with you</i>

1065
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:08,771
<i>You'll find while you're dancing</i>

1066
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:11,377
<i>That there's a rhythm</i>
<i>In your heart and soul</i>

1067
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:13,707
<i>A certain rhythm</i>
<i>That you can't control</i>

1068
01:29:13,881 --> 01:29:16,645
<i>The Continental</i>

1069
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:19,184
<i>The Continental</i>

1070
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:23,984
<i>The Continental</i>

1071
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:04,081
He's gone. Come on.

1072
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:35,475
- Now, why did you do this?
- I wanted to be sure of you.

1073
01:33:38,713 --> 01:33:40,112
- Who is this?
- How do I know?

1074
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:43,114
This isn't my racket. You've been
through these things before.

1075
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:46,310
I know, but you've upset
my entire routine.

1076
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:48,546
- Find out who it is.
- Yes.

1077
01:33:54,595 --> 01:33:56,460
- Who is it?
- It's the waiter, sir.

1078
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:59,464
- It's the waiter.
- Ask him what he wants.

1079
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,226
- What do you want?
- Breakfast.

1080
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:02,699
Breakfast. What shall we do?

1081
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:04,770
Give him his breakfast.
No, wait a minute.

1082
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:08,204
- Oh, Mimi. Oh, Mimi.
- Yes?

1083
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:10,469
There's a waiter
who says he wants breakfast.

1084
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:11,942
- What?
- That's what he says.

1085
01:34:12,113 --> 01:34:13,944
The poor fellow may be hungry.

1086
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:16,583
Clown. That's our breakfast.
I just ordered it.

1087
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:19,185
- That's our breakfast, Tonetti.
- I open it.

1088
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,019
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1089
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:23,713
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1090
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:27,453
- Did you rest comfortably?
- Oh, yes, indeed.

1091
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:31,155
- Put that right here.
- Yes. May I?

1092
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:34,597
- Mr. Tonetti, you sit there.
- Thank you.

1093
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:37,465
And, Guy, you sit there.

1094
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,698
You know, I'd like to have breakfast
with you every morning.

1095
01:34:41,242 --> 01:34:43,301
Yes? Thank you.

1096
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:47,075
I hope you like what I ordered.

1097
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:50,445
You know, I've never had breakfast
with two gentlemen before.

1098
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:52,677
I've tried it. It's no fun.

1099
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:56,448
Now, now, when the detectives arrive,
we must be very careful.

1100
01:34:56,624 --> 01:34:59,354
Oh, I hope they don't arrive too soon.

1101
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:02,087
I've grown to like
both of you tremendously.

1102
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,454
That's so sweet.

1103
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,667
- Guy. Guy, you'd better hide.
- Let Tonetti hide.

1104
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:12,738
She's right. You'll ruin all. Go.

1105
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:15,034
Guy, please.
You want me to be free, don't you?

1106
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:17,336
- I'll hide, but call if you need me.
- Yes, yes.

1107
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:19,001
Go ahead.

1108
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:21,075
- No, not over here.
- Where?

1109
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:23,512
Over there. Anywhere. Just stay...

1110
01:35:26,787 --> 01:35:28,812
Coffee, ma'am.

1111
01:35:29,757 --> 01:35:32,658
I thought it best to keep it hot for you.

1112
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:35,787
- Guy.
- Yes, dear.

1113
01:35:35,963 --> 01:35:39,057
It's all right. It's just the waiter
with the coffee.

1114
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:41,997
Waiter, next time you knock,
let's have some sort of signal.

1115
01:35:42,169 --> 01:35:43,397
Like this, will you?

1116
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,971
I can't be dashing in and out,
coffee or no coffee.

1117
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,505
Oh, I see.
Knock each time.

1118
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:50,166
- I understand.
- Yes, you see, that's it.

1119
01:35:50,344 --> 01:35:54,542
Tell me, the gentleman in this case
is a scientist, is he not?

1120
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:57,582
A very distinguished scientist
in his own field.

1121
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:00,050
A fossil among fossils. A geologist.

1122
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:03,588
- Pardon, but are you discussing geology?
- Always and again.

1123
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:08,092
If you'll excuse me, sir,
I have an unnatural passion for rocks.

1124
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:10,457
Well, you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

1125
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:13,460
Oh, no, sir,
it's a wonderful thing, geology, sir.

1126
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:17,092
Do you know, geologically speaking,
this little island of Great Britain...

1127
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:21,469
...is 500 million
and 3 and one-half years old?

1128
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:24,410
How do you know it's exactly that old?

1129
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:28,781
Professor Brown told me it was
500 million years old when I first met him...

1130
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:30,917
...and that was
three and a half years ago.

1131
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:32,848
- Who was that?
- Professor Brown.

1132
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:35,011
- Professor Brown?
- Yes. He's a geologist.

1133
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:37,589
Him and his wife stopped
at the last place I worked.

1134
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:40,727
Do you know, sir,
it was Professor Brown who told me...

1135
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:47,061
...that this seacoast around here
is really an igneous intrusion?

1136
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:50,397
You know, you're somewhat
of an igneous intrusion yourself.

1137
01:36:50,571 --> 01:36:53,233
Oh, thank you, sir.

1138
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:03,506
Now, to return to the facts, we...

1139
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:07,917
Is that the way
you want me to knock, sir?

1140
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:10,056
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1141
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:12,624
I see. Thank you very much.

1142
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:16,461
Oh, what a day this is going to be.

1143
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:19,363
- Well, Mrs. Glossop.
- Hello, Egbert.

1144
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:22,502
Quiet, pl...
Oh, Guy, what are you doing here?

1145
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,969
Oh, Egbert, that's what I've been trying
to remember to tell you about.

1146
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,301
- Oh, was it?
- Yes.

1147
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:31,344
This is my Mimi.

1148
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:34,379
Oh, really? Yes. Well, this is my finish.

1149
01:37:34,548 --> 01:37:38,780
- Tonetti, if you have bungled this job...
- Now, <i>scusi, signor,</i> please, <i>scusi.</i>

1150
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:41,513
Now, Guy, get out.
You're messing up the whole thing.

1151
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,953
- You brought the detectives?
- Better than that.

1152
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:46,092
I've pulled a supreme coup.
A masterpiece.

1153
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,522
I'll bet this will be good.

1154
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:50,163
I have brought Mr. Glossop.

1155
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:51,559
- My husband?
- Yes.

1156
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:52,960
The husband is coming.

1157
01:37:53,133 --> 01:37:54,828
Shut up, Guy. You've got to get out.

1158
01:37:55,002 --> 01:37:57,971
- No more hiding.
- Oh, please, Guy. You promised.

1159
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:00,265
All right, I'll hide.

1160
01:38:01,342 --> 01:38:03,776
But please call if you need me.

1161
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,079
- Call anyhow.
- Yes, I will.

1162
01:38:08,249 --> 01:38:11,912
Mimi, it was my idea to have your
husband here. Wasn't it clever of me?

1163
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:15,715
Oh, Hortense, why did you do that?
Something terrible is liable to happen.

1164
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,881
- Courage, I don't think he'll shoot.
- Shoot?

1165
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:20,185
Is somebody going to shoot? Let's wait.

1166
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:24,695
Shoot? Mr. Egbert, never, never have I had
to come in contact with a husband before.

1167
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:28,426
I don't think it's fair to ask me to do so
now. Where are the detectives?

1168
01:38:28,602 --> 01:38:30,627
I demand the detectives.
It's in my contract.

1169
01:38:30,804 --> 01:38:34,103
I'm sorry. I can't do anything about that.
He's probably on his way up.

1170
01:38:34,275 --> 01:38:37,438
Do something. Do something.
Look amorous. Tonetti, look amorous.

1171
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:38,908
Hortense, look... Never mind.

1172
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:41,309
- Come on, come on.
- Yes, Egbert.

1173
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:44,383
Well, this is too much for Tonetti.

1174
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:47,209
Quick, quick. What shall we do?

1175
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:50,789
Well, Mr. Egbert said try
to look amorous. See, like this:

1176
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:53,426
Oh, you just look sick.

1177
01:38:55,663 --> 01:38:58,029
Well, try this:

1178
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:02,932
Come in.

1179
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:06,165
Pardon, madam,
I hope I knocked the right way.

1180
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:12,870
- Now you've spoiled everything.
- I'm sorry, sir. I came for the dishes.

1181
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:14,878
Oh, well, the dishes can wait.

1182
01:39:15,049 --> 01:39:17,279
- Can't we do something with him?
- Yes, here.

1183
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:19,476
- Go quickly there, please.
- Yes, hide him.

1184
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:21,518
- In the bedroom?
- Yes. Hurry. Hurry.

1185
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:23,350
- Yes, hurry.
- Oh, now, sir, please...

1186
01:39:23,524 --> 01:39:25,685
- Hi, waiter.
- How do you do, sir?

1187
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:28,453
- You hiding too?
- Yes, sir. They just shoved me in here.

1188
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,824
Now, once more.

1189
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:36,164
Come in.

1190
01:39:42,676 --> 01:39:44,439
Oh, Cyril.

1191
01:39:49,883 --> 01:39:51,851
Who is this fellow?

1192
01:39:52,686 --> 01:39:54,017
This is my husband.

1193
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:57,214
Oh, how do you do?
I'm so very pleased.

1194
01:39:57,758 --> 01:39:59,385
You haven't answered my question.

1195
01:40:00,761 --> 01:40:04,322
I must confess, he's my...

1196
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:06,693
This object?

1197
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:11,236
No, I don't believe it.
My dear child, he's nothing to you.

1198
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:14,806
He has all the earmarks
of a hired corespondent.

1199
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:20,072
That is not true.
She love me and I love she.

1200
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:24,816
Mimi, you amuse me.
I'd never believe it with him.

1201
01:40:24,985 --> 01:40:27,977
This...? This hairdresser?

1202
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:33,791
Guy! Guy!

1203
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:37,562
I'm sorry to ask you to do this,
but will you kiss me?

1204
01:40:37,731 --> 01:40:40,165
I'm not sorry.

1205
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:42,666
Bravo. Bravissimo.

1206
01:40:42,836 --> 01:40:45,532
And who, pray, is this new Lothario?

1207
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:48,864
After the divorce,
we're going to be married.

1208
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:51,406
What divorce?

1209
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:54,404
Why, aren't you going to divorce me?

1210
01:40:55,082 --> 01:40:58,779
Why, no, my dear.
I'm going to forgive you.

1211
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:01,443
Forgive her.

1212
01:41:06,126 --> 01:41:07,491
Enough of this nonsense.

1213
01:41:07,661 --> 01:41:10,061
Mimi, you pack up your things
and come home at once.

1214
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:13,597
At once, I tell you.
Why, you're just a little lamb who's strayed.

1215
01:41:14,101 --> 01:41:18,197
And you, sir,
are just an ineffectual little puppy.

1216
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:23,639
At last, I've got my chance
to throw somebody out.

1217
01:41:23,811 --> 01:41:25,938
Oh, no, no, Guy.
You mustn't, please.

1218
01:41:26,213 --> 01:41:29,205
Pardon me, ma'am.
May I go now? I've got my work to do.

1219
01:41:29,383 --> 01:41:30,714
Yes, yes, go ahead.

1220
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:32,545
Why, how do you do, Professor Brown?

1221
01:41:34,822 --> 01:41:36,449
Professor Brown?

1222
01:41:36,623 --> 01:41:39,183
How are you, professor,
if you don't mind my asking?

1223
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:42,351
Oh, is this your dear old friend,
the rock thrower?

1224
01:41:42,529 --> 01:41:44,121
Yes, sir, that's him.

1225
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:47,861
That's ridiculous.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

1226
01:41:48,035 --> 01:41:50,560
- I never saw this man in my life.
- Oh, come, professor.

1227
01:41:50,737 --> 01:41:54,104
Don't you remember all those little chats
we used to have about rocks?

1228
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:57,368
You and me and your wife?

1229
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:00,342
No, I do not.

1230
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:03,312
And would you know
the professor's wife if you saw her?

1231
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:04,815
Why, of course I would, sir.

1232
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:09,420
Am I Mrs. Brown?

1233
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:12,150
No, ma'am. You're Mrs. Green.

1234
01:42:12,759 --> 01:42:15,250
Well, strike me pink.

1235
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:21,299
You see, Mrs. Brown, she was French.
She couldn't speak a word of English.

1236
01:42:22,569 --> 01:42:27,597
Why, Buster Brown,
this is most "unfossilish" of you, sir.

1237
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:29,435
I've got to catch a train.

1238
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:31,669
- Let me pass, sir.
- I will not, sir.

1239
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:34,746
- Let me pass, I say.
- Never, sir.

1240
01:42:42,089 --> 01:42:44,182
Well, well, what happened? Did it work?

1241
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:46,292
Did it work?
Meet the future Mrs. Holden.

1242
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:49,020
Oh, now... Oh, I told you.
I told you.

1243
01:42:49,196 --> 01:42:50,754
Father will be so proud of me.

1244
01:42:50,931 --> 01:42:53,957
- Egbert and I are going to be married too.
- Yes.

1245
01:42:54,134 --> 01:42:55,863
Why, darling, why, what's the mat...?

1246
01:42:56,036 --> 01:42:58,937
We were married last night,
on our way back from London.

1247
01:42:59,106 --> 01:43:00,937
Last night? Were we?

1248
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:04,043
Why, of course, sir, we were.
Darling, I'd forgotten about it.

1249
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:06,577
Isn't it wonderful?
I'll tell you what we'll do.

1250
01:43:06,747 --> 01:43:09,079
We'll hurry back to London
to have a celebration.

1251
01:43:09,249 --> 01:43:12,685
Oh, <i>scusi, scusi,</i> I'm also very good
at parties.

1252
01:45:16,743 --> 01:45:18,734
