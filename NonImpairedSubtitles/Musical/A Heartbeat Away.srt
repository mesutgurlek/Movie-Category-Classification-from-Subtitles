00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,320
# Rock music

6
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,100
Kevin, cut that racket!

7
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,199
I could hear you from Gaffney Street!

8
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,860
Do you have to play so loud?!

9
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,340
Mum! It's rock'n'roll!

10
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,500
Your father's favourite music
to strangle someone by

11
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,019
and it's likely to be both of us.

12
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,399
Yeah, yeah.

13
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,139
And I think you'll find that last chord
is an A minor 6, not a D7.

14
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,240
The riff doesn't take off unless
you get the chord structure right.

15
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,600
Yeah, I knew that.

16
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
- Moron.
- Reject.

17
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,040
Loser!

18
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Margaret.
You're here early for your lesson.

19
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Keep going.

20
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,660
(Plays fumbling notes)

21
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,860
Just touch the keys, love.
No need to pound them to death.

22
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,100
Just try and keep breathing.

23
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,620
(Continues playing badly)

24
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,100
MAN: <i>Grace!</i>

25
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,819
<i>Where's my bloody baton?</i>

26
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,399
<i>I'm already late for rehearsal.</i>

27
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,280
(Sighs)

28
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,220
<i>Can't find a bloody thing</i>
<i>in this house!</i>

29
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Oh, hey, Dad.
Off to rehearsals then?

30
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,199
If there's anything left
of my hearing, Kevin.

31
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,500
I was just wondering
if you'd like me to drive you in?

32
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,379
Why would I want you to do that?

33
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,259
I just need the car for the arvo,
if that would be OK?

34
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,939
I can get back to pick you up.

35
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,699
The reason I have a car, Kevin,
is because I have a job.

36
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,259
It's an equation
that'll work for you too one day.

37
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,520
If you ever wake up to yourself.

38
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,899
Just tell him you'll take that job
down at the depot.

39
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,520
- Why can't he just...
- How badly do you want that audition?

40
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,100
Dad! Hey, Dad! Wait!

41
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,840

00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,160
# Forceful marching band music

50
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,399
Cut! Cut!

51
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,300
- Stop!
(All stop playing)

52
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,180
For God's sakes, George,
you've got a bloody euphonium, use it!

53
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,980
And, Dawn, the tenor horns
are the secret heart of the band.

54
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,779
If you're not solid,
nothing above it makes any sense.

55
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,899
Look, it's the melody in the chorus
that's important

56
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
and, trombones,
you've got the counter melody

57
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,060
but, Derek, we still have to hear
the bloody tune.

58
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,199
You're all playing
like a sack of drowning cats.

59
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,480
(Dog whines)

60
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,199
Look...

61
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,760
You've gotta play music
like your life depends on it.

62
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,199
With feeling.

63
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,439
Focus.

64
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,220
Concentration and heart.

65
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,959
There's no bloody point otherwise,
is there? Eh?

66
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:22,000
It's about precision
coupled with passion.

67
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,240
You've got to touch the human soul.

68
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,560
Tommy, I've heard you play
like an angel.

69
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,400
Now, I need to hear that again.

70
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,799
Now, this is the first time in 20 years

71
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,679
we get to play in front
of the home crowd.

72
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,940
And this is going to be our year!

73
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Our victory!

74
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,100
And nothing is bloody well
gonna stop us this time!

75
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,320
- Right?
ALL: Yeah!

76
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,360
Gino!

77
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,280
- Late again.
- Oops.

78
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,399
Sorry, mate.

79

Alright!

84

Whoa! Whoa!

85
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,139
You got a spot. I just need a few details for
the entrance form.

86
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,259
- Damien, is it?
- Yeah.

87
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,399
Uh, actually, it's my band.
I'm Kevin Flack.

88
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,279
- Ed Flack's kid?
- Yep. That's me.

89
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,539
Best electrician in town.

90
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,159
Did all my rewiring
when I took over this place.

91
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Decent bloke.

92
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,460
Fill out all your names
and a contact phone number.

93
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,879
Talent quest's a month on Saturday.

94
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,520
I may be a little bit late for the contest,
boys, on the night.

95
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,220
Might be out celebrating.

96
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,500
Well, wouldn't miss the marching band
regionals for quids.

97
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,740
Not after last time.

98
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,940
I can still see Tommy Dempsey
blowin' mud out of his trumpet.

99
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,140
And his nose! (Laughs)

100
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
And George McKilty, the fat bastard,

101
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,399
floundering in the water
like a beached whale

102
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,299
with a euphonium up his arse

103
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,859
and your dad... (Laughs)

104
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,380
Yeah, alright. Alright.

105
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,779
That was a long time ago.

106
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,760
Seems like yesterday, son.

107
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,799
Let's eat.

108
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,920
I can't. I gotta go pick up my dad.

109
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,620
Our simple mission,

110
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,759
to create a lifestyle experience for our
primary target demographic -

111
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,679
OG1s and 2s -

112
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,679
as well as provide subsidiary benefits for
other secondary stakeholders

113
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,720
according to clearly defined short-term and
long-term strategic goals.

114
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,139
So what you're saying, Tracey,

115
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,740
is that this development
will benefit everyone in Montague.

116
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,820
Particularly small business.

117
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,220
Absolutely. What we are planning
is a total makeover of Montague,

118
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,159
all centring around the old cannery,

119
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,539
which was once McPherson's Wharf.

120
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,220
This will provide, in the short term,

121
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,000
an estimated annual income to shareholders
and local businesses,

122
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,639
a guaranteed $3 million in the first year,

123
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,980
escalating to 10 times that amount within the
first decade.

124
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,019
And Montague goes
from an obsolete fishing village

125
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,039
to a state-of-the-art tourist destination.

126
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,980
TRACEY: Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you stage one.

127
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,440
Paradise Point at Montague.

128
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,100
And the "pièce de résistance",

129
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
a tribute to the fishermen
of this great town.

130
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,979
The Montague Lobster!

131
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,019
Oh, there hasn't been a lobster off Montague
since before I was born!

132
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Yes, Councillor Agnew,
that may be true.

133
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,700
However, I don't think we can let
a minor detail like that

134
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,340
get in the way of the tourist dollar.

135
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
There's just one small problem,
isn't there?

136
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,220
That thing seems to be standing

137
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
exactly where the Montague Band's
clubhouse is.

138
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,100
Hey, what's the difference between cutting
up an onion

139
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,539
and cutting up a trombone?

140
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,379
ALL: What is it?
(Laughs)

141
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,679
Nobody cries
when you cut up a trombone!

142
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,519
(All laugh)

143
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,139
MAM: <i>Here's Grizzly Guts.</i>

144
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
What's the story
with the council plans, Edwin?

145
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
They've already closed the cannery.

146
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,519
Our clubhouse will be the next to go.

147
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
No-one is throwing us out of our home.

148
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,399
Mark my words.

149
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,559
Legal problem?

150
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,740
Yes, it seems that
the clubhouse is built on land

151
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,620
bequeathed to the people of Montague by its
original owner.

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,300
Angus McPherson in 1927,

153
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,620
"for the exclusive use of the Montague
Municipal Marching Band."

154
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,059
Why the hell would he do that?

155
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
He was the first musical director
of this band

156
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,340
and it was in his will that they -
we - be allowed...

157
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,639
"Peaceful enjoyment
of the said property..."

158
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,379
"..for as long as the Montague Municipal
Marching Band..."

159
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,019
"..should on its own accord..."

160
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,020
"..and free will..."

161
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,179
"..continue to provide entertainment
for the good people..."

162

Well, that deserves another round.

his shout of the beer...again.

Home time, everyone.

173

- It's like sex with frets!

185
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
- I've never tried it.
- What...

186
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,900
Sounds interesting.

187
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200

No, no. Kevin will be here soon.

Flat tyre and no spare. So I...

Look what you've done!
My bloody conducting arm!

- Don't you tell me to calm down!

You've made a mess of everything.

221
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,339
Ever since you started playing
that senseless noise in the garage

222

day in, day out,

223
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,220

the kind of music you have a gift for.

- You wasted all that talent!

for a scholarship at
the Conservatorium of bloody Music.

229

You had it offered to you on a platter.

But, oh no, not for you.
Not for our Kevin, no.

Edwin...

232
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,200
What's the point of having a gift
if you don't use it?

I'm sorry, Dad.

Where did that come from?

265
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Trouble is, your father would have
a real problem with something like that.

266
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,059
- Why?
- We did it once.

267
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,839
- It was a...
- It was a disaster.

268
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,460
(Voice echoes) It was 1990.

269

Yeah, yeah. I know all about 1990.

- Disaster!
- Your father had the same idea as you.

"something now".

273
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,019
It was musically complicated,
a challenge to play technically.

274
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,859
Right up Edwin's alley.

275
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,619

It was the Regional Championships

So why do you all keep showing up?

295

Edwin is the best there is.

296

But for 20 years?!

297

301
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,819
The legal department has assessed
the contingency risk

302
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,460
and will only sign off on the development if
the band ceases to exist.

303
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,299
So we're stuffed, aren't we?

304
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,940
No, not yet, we're not.

305
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,900
Well, there's no way that fanatic
Edwin Flack and his merry men

306
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,139
are gonna disband.

307
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,819
But they might agree to a merger.

308
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,940
The band might. Flack won't.

309
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,120
Don't be so sure about that. (Laughs)

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,740
Call me when you get your act together.
I can't sing to that crap.

319
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,660
Yeah, and it's impossible
to follow a lead who can't keep time.

320
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,119
Keep time?!

321
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Is that a technical term you picked up from
your other secret band rehearsal?

322
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
- What other band?!
- It's a brass band.

323
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,799
(Laughs)

324
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,700
With a percussion section
full of false teeth and pacemakers.

325
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
- What?
- It's something I can't get out of.

326
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
While you boys sort out your priorities,

327
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,740
there's a hot babe just salivating
for what old Damo has to offer.

328
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,519
(Laughs)

329
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,120
Don't forget to lock up.

330
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,799
A brass band?!

331
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,720
Mate! That's so uncool.

332
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,500
(Novelty car horn honks)

333
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,379
(Tyres screech)

334
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
(Laughs) They don't call him Tripod
for nothing.

335
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
KEVIN: I can't believe
I got sucked into this.

336
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,599
You should see them.

337
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,339
Grumpy old farts waiting to die.

338
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,019
And the shit they play,
I'm going to look like an idiot.

339
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,079
I can't believe
your dad asked you to do it.

340
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,819
He didn't. He hates the idea.

341
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,039
- So why did you...
- Mate, don't ask.

342
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,740
(Laughs) I get it.

343
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,099
Your mum made you do it.

344
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,360
- Shut up, Simon.
(Laughs)

345
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,040
Oi, it's Tripod's car.

346
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,099
So where is dick brain?

347
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,560
(Laughs) Taking an aerobics class.

348
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,859
# Faint dance music

349
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,960
- Come on.
(Laughs)

350
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,400
Here. Here, come on.

351
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,599
Wow!

352
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,740
Where did she come from?

353
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,460
That's Mandy Riddick.

354
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,980
Oh, I'm randy for Mandy!

355
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,099
Yeah, I was just playing her
some of my music the other day.

356
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,839
(Laughs) Yeah, right, Kev. Dream on.

357
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,539
She's way out of your league.

358
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,800
Oh, and I hate to break your heart, Kev, but
Tripod's beaten you to her.

359
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,440
Oh!

360
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,899
A merger? Impossible.

361
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,980
I'm sorry, there isn't one of them
that comes even close

362
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,460
to meeting the high musical standards

363
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
required by the Diamond Vale
Marching Band.

364
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,799
- Mr Fyffe.
- I'm afraid it's out of the question.

365
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,579
We are about to embark on
a major building project for Montague

366
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,940
in the next 12 months.

367
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,220
And I see no reason why we couldn't include
in our portfolio

368
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,339
some major renovations to the Diamond Vale
grandstand and clubrooms.

369
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:05,839
I see.

370
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,359
At no cost to Diamond Vale, of course.

371
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,019
Well, there may be one...or two.

372
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,740
We do need a euphonium.

373
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,900
We would be in your debt.

374
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,199
How quickly can we move on this then?

375
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,059
Almost immediately.

376
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,519
Let's wait until after the competition.

377
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,139
Think about it,

378
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,940
with Edwin Flack's useless kid
leading them to guaranteed failure,

379
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,500
there won't be a voter in Montague who'll
support them.

380
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
What if they win?
We can't get rid of them then.

381
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Win?! I have no intention
of letting them win.

382
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Mr Flack's men don't stand a chance.

383
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,080
With or without him.

384
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,900
And with the appropriate spin, we sell the
idea to the ratepayers of Montague

385
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
that this was a necessary sacrifice,

386
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,799
given Edwin Flack's
unfortunate accident.

387
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,740
And you get your big lobster.

388
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,280
- Mmm.
(Laughs)

389
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,920
(Door opens, bell rings)

390
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Hey! I was wondering all day
if you'd show up.

391
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,119
I just came back to see the guitar.

392
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,560
Oh. Really?

393
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
It's still there.

394
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Um, no. Mandy!

395
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,960
That's not what I meant!

396
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,399
Idiot!

397
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,500
Merger, my arse!

398
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
It's for the good of
the entire community.

399
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
(Edwin scoffs)

400
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,099
Diamond Vale and Montague
united under one banner.

401
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,279
Which banner?

402
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,220
We know the band is due to play
at the Regional Championships

403
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,059
under the temporary leadership
of young Kevin, I hear.

404
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,359
I hope he makes a good fist of it for you.

405
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,140
You leave my son out of this.

406
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,519
And of course,
we're all behind him on that.

407
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,119
So to show the good faith of the council,

408
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,619
we have decided to support the band
through till then.

409
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,099
A sort of farewell performance.

410
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,380
(Laughs) It's the land, isn't it?

411
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:15,099
It's all about the land and a monument to
some overrated shellfish!

412
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,940
You thieving mongrel!

413
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,859
It's got nothing to do with me.
It's a council decision.

414
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,960
Montague has always had
a marching band

415
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,220
as long as anyone can remember.

416
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,940
But we've never farmed a bloody lobster in
this town and we never will,

417
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,420
so your scheme is absolute crap!

418
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,140
The truth is, Flack, you are in my way, you
and your bloody clubhouse.

419
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,220
And I can't have that.

420
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,220
So it's time to move over
and let progress take its course.

421
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,539
Well, you can't close us down.

422
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,139
Legally, you can't,

423
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,260
unless the band agree.

424
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,040
That's why I'll be contacting them.

425
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,559
Individually.

426
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,019
The Montague Municipal Marching Band will
never agree to disband.

427
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,740
That, I promise you.

428
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,099
In these tough economic times, Ed,

429
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,980
a few council concessions
can make a big difference

430
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,440
to those unfortunate families
without incomes.

431
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,099
None of this would have happened
if you had just, for once in your life,

432
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,040
turned up on time.

433
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,099
Hey, Mr Riddick. Mr Mayor, sir.

434
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,539
I want you to reconsider
about closing down the band.

435
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,339
- It's a done deal.
- Oh, please.

436
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,920
I know they're a bunch of old geezers but
they've got nothing else in their lives.

437
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,180
And everyone really likes them.

438
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,840
And didn't they
kind of, like, vote for you?

439
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,899
I don't like you, Kevin.

440
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,019
And I've never liked your father.

441
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,900
Except that he's a good electrician
and he would die for his band,

442
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,140
while you, well, you're not
really much good at anything

443
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
and there's not much
you genuinely care about.

444
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,280
You're a waste of space, Flack.

445
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,640
You can't close us down if we win.

446
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,700
OK, I tell you what I'll do.

447
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,859
If "we win", and I admire this new spark of
determination in you, Kevin,

448
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,019
if the band wins, they stay.

449
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,140
But if they lose, they're history.

450
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,800
And...you never see
my daughter again.

451
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
- Has she been talking about me?
- Not a word.

452
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,019
And let's keep it that way.

453
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,660
She's been seeing a lot of you lately.

454
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,579
I have big plans for my daughter

455
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
and I don't want her distracted
by the likes of you.

456
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,819
Oh, no, I think you mean the Tripod.

457
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,639
- Oh, cut the crap, kid.
- No, you see...

458
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,600
Now...have we got a deal?

459
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,000
Or haven't we?

460
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,900
Well, Dawn, what's it to be?

461
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
8 for continuing. 11 for disbanding.

462
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,440
Merging.

463
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,680
Right.

464
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,799
Well, I can't say I was expecting that.

465
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,800
But I guess we can't let 80 years
of history end in certain humiliation.

466
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,900
So, Tommy, I want you
to do one last duty for me.

467
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,799
Withdraw the band
from the Regionals this year

468
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:55,859
and inform the Mayor he can build
his bloody theme park on our land

469
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,759
because the Montague Municipal Marching
Band

470
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:05,120
has officially disbanded as of today.

471
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,880
I'm sorry, Edwin.

472
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,960
That's all, lads.

473
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,880
How long do you think it'll be
before he bulldozes all of our houses?

474
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,960
The band's just the beginning.

475
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,880
(Dog whines)

476
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,099
You could have convinced them.

477
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,600
Why didn't you give them
one of your speeches?

478
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,300
They'll do anything for you
when you crack the whip.

479
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,899
They'll follow you anywhere.

480
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,840
Christ! They've done everything
you told them for 20 years!

481
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,640
I think that's just the point.

482
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Well, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out who voted for disbanding.

483
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,980
You don't know what I voted.

484
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,539
- Traitor!
- We had no choice!

485
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Oh, well, perhaps it's just a lucky break. I
won't have to listen to you anymore.

486
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,900
Because if you call
what you do drumming,

487
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,500
I've got a 2-year-old grandson who can keep
a beat better than you can.

488
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,860
Probably plays a better trumpet
than you, out of his arse!

489
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,159
ALL: Ooh!

490
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,519
Well, at least he's got the wind for it.

491
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,299
I mean, you need a break
every 20 seconds

492
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,940
just to recharge your pacemaker!

493
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,959
I'm not the one holding up the bar.

494
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,059
- Hey, guys!
- What are you insinuating?!

495
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:37,879
Guys!

496
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,239
If you think that Diamond Vale would want a
geriatric fat bastard dick like you

497
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,460
backing up their brass band...

498
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,419
Right! That's it!

499
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,599
Hey! Hey! Hey!

500
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,780
What is wrong with you guys?

501
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
You're a great team.
You can't just give up now.

502
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
- Where's your fighting spirit?
- Right on!

503
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,120
(All yell)

504
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,700
(Elevator bell dings)

505
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,339
(All yell)
- Ahh!

506
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
(Comical marching band music plays)

507
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,960
Ahh!

508
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,640
So how did the meeting go?

509
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,300
Could have gone better.

510
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,360
I guess.

511
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
# Reflective music

512
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,640
(Electric guitar plays in distance)

513
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,200
# Melodic instrumental music

514
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
I suppose you've come back
to see the guitar.

515
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,420
- Uh...
- Well, it's not here.

516
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,059
Look, I'm really sorry about
what happened the other day, OK?

517
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,380
I thought what my father did
to the marching band was really mean.

518
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
I can't wait to see his face
when you win.

519
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,680
Yeah.

520
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,219
That's gonna be a little tricky

521
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
since they've all kind of given up
and gone home.

522
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,280
But you haven't given up.

523
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Have you?

524
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,459
So, what's the plan?

525
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,619
- The plan?
- You're far too smart to not have a plan.

526
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,960
I am?! I am.

527
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,320
(Novelty car horn honks)

528
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,840
I guess that means you've gotta go.

529
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,640
Quick. Quick.

530
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,500
(Banging on door)
DAMIEN: Mandy!

531
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,539
Yo! (Bangs on door)

532
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,459
(Footsteps recede)

533
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,660
(Bangs on window)

534
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,439
Oi!

535
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,560
Mandy!

536
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,320
# We'll always be together

537
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:03,120
# Whenever we're apart

538
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,300
# And until you know you're mine

539
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,239
# Oh, baby

540
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,260
# 'Cause every time I wonder

541
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,940
# When you'll be back in my life

542
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,080
Oh, my God.

543
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,480
That was Edwin's favourite.

544
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Put it on.

545
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,639
What, now?

546
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:41,899
Your father's not home.

547
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,699
Let's walk on the wild side.

548
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,840
# THE ANGELS: Take A Long Line

549
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
# He was selling postcards
from a paper stand

550
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,159
# A whisky bottle in his withered hand

551
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:03,019
# He put a finger on a photo
from an old magazine

552
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,119
# And saw himself in
the shadow of his dream

553
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,340
# They found him with his head
inside a tin-pot crown

554
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
# Told him his feet stank
and took him downtown

555
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:13,079
# Called him agitator, spy and thief

556
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
# Shut him up in solitary third degree

557
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,180
# Take a long line

558
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,360
# Take a long line, take a long line... #

559
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,240
Oh, yuck!

560
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,599
GRACE: I wish you'd met your father back
then.

561
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,260
That was the last time
those boys were really excited,

562
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,599
passionate.

563
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,960
Playing something
they really believed in.

564
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,320
And then it all changed.

565
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,500
I never knew how big it was.

566
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,280
To all of them.

567
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,019
Sometimes, my love,

568
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,960
one disappointment can shape
every day for the rest of your life.

569
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Is that why you stayed?

570
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,519
I told myself that I had no choice.

571
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,059
You know, I had two kids to bring up

572
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,659
and was stuck in a small town
in the middle of nowhere.

573
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,219
Better the devil you know.

574
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,419
But that's not it.

575
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,640
It's a question of whether
you give up on someone you love.

576
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,680
Or not.

577
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:34,739
Mandy, I've had a brainwave.

578
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:37,539
I need something that wasn't written before
the Second World War.

579
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,419
So this is your plan?

580
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:42,639
If we're going to win this competition,
I need to get these old guys to play.

581
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,079
And the only way to do that

582
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,739
is to get them excited about something
no-one thinks they can play.

583
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,680
- Not even them.
- What about this?

584
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,500
A genuine 5-star classic.

585
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,040
"An anthem for a whole generation."

586
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,800
Maybe.

587
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,600
(Comical melancholic music)

588
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
(Dog whimpers)

589
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,840
I would like to ram that lobster
right up the Mayor's ceremonial ring.

590
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,500
I've got a proposition for you.

591
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,300
Piss off, Kevin! We are finished!
Debunked! Kaput!

592
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,599
Yeah, but...

593
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:25,719
If you don't mind, I'd like to finish this beer
and follow it up with a few more.

594
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:27,739
But I'm talking about competing...

595
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,260
..with a few changes.

596
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,039
Changes?

597
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,860
Yes, we go out on a high,
playing something fantastic.

598
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,739
Kev, we'd just make fools of ourselves, like
last time,

599
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,980
only worse with this material.

600
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,060
That was in the past.

601
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:42,499
No, can't be done.

602
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,340
We'd never get George back.

603
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,080
(Plays Flight Of The Bumblebee)

604
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,300
I don't know how you're
gonna get trumpets to play this

605
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,980
and you won't have a euphonium,
it's gonna be very difficult.

606
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,660
Well, you're the man.

607
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,340
You still doing the talent night here
with your rock band?

608
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,200
Yep.

609
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,500
You know it's on the same night?

610
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
Yes, I know.

611
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,140
We're on late,
long after the Regionals are over.

612
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,459
So, what do you reckon?

613
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,300
Regionals? Our way.

614
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,400
What does your father say
about the changes?

615
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,560
- Mmm...
- I see.

616
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,299
Look, I just wanna give it one last shot.

617
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,480
Yeah, well, none of us
can orchestrate this.

618
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
Actually, I've got someone in mind.

619
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,160
# Up-beat brass band music

620
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:34,360
Now build it up even more.

621
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,280
Then bring in the trombones!

622
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
This is brilliant.

623
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:50,039
And now for the trumpets
cutting through it all!

624
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,320
# Triumphant crescendo

625
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
(Music stops)

626
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:58,619
Hey, Mum, you're really good at this.

627
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,160
(Sighs)

628
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,500
I've always been good at this.

629
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,520
It's just that nobody noticed.

630
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:13,560
- Come on, you guys.
MAN: Hope everybody turns up.

631
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,120
Kevin, hold that, will you?

632
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,500
- Quick, quick.
- Shh! Come on.

633
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,420
(Whispers) Go. Inside, come on.

634
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,840
(Man laughs)
- Shh!

635
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,880
Blimey!

636
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,120
This looks hard.

637
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,640
(Plays trumpet)

638
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,800
(Another instrument starts playing)

639
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:03,240
(More instruments join in)

640
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
I want everyone in this room to swear

641
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,719
nobody breathes a word of this
to anyone.

642
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,900
- Especially...
- Edwin.

643
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:10,760
..my dad.

644
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,699
Anyone know why we're here?

645
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,360
Where is he?
Anyone know where he is?

646
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,140
Ooph! Who is she?

647
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,760
OK. Alright, everyone. This is Mandy.

648
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:27,459
(Man wolf whistles)

649
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,099
I've asked her to help us out
with the marching routine.

650
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,119
And maybe give you guys
a whole new look.

651
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,320
(All cheer and applaud)

652
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,400
# AMII STEWART: Knock On Wood

653
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,139
# I don't want to lose you

654
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,260
# This good thing that I got

655

# 'Cause your love is better

659
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:12,859
# Than any love I know

660
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,500
# It's like thunder and lightning

661
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:19,719
# The way you love me is frightening

662
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,080
# You better knock, knock

663
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,400

# Whoo hoo hoo hoo

666
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,240
# Whoa

667
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,820
# I'm not superstitious about ya

668
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,760
# But I can't take no chance

669
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,500
# You got me spinnin', baby

670
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,340

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,060
# Than any love I know

00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,139

00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,980
# You better knock, knock... #

676
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,360
(All cheer)

677
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,620
Three cheers for Kevin!

678
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:09,019
- Hip-hip...
ALL: Hooray!

679
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,340
- Hip-hip...
ALL: Hooray!

680
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,340
- Hip-hip...
ALL: Hooray!

681
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,079
(All cheer)

682
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,099
- Over he goes!
- No! No!

683
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,880
(All cheer and laugh)

684
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,900
TOMMY: You can swim, can't you?

685
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,360
Oh, my God.

686
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:28,019
I'm gonna get you back so bad!

687
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,480
We love you, baby.

688
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,900
EDWIN: Haven't seen Kevin for a while.
What's he up to?

689
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,940
Found something useful to do?

690
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,900
Oh, he's been busy rehearsing.

691
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:26,679
Rehearsing?

692
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,980
His rock band.
Saturday night's the talent quest.

693
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,680
Waste of bloody talent.

694
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,120
Edwin, look at me.

695
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,880
I've got something
very important to tell you.

696
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,880
And I think
you're going to be very proud.

697
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,960
EDWIN: (Yells) No!

698
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,260
WOMAN: Mr Flack!

699
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:56,859
# Classical music

700
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,000
- See you, Dad.
- She was beautiful, you know?

701
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,960
Just like you.

702
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,520
She was the best part of me.

703
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:16,720
I miss her too.

704
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:20,640
You grow more like her every day.

705
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,099
Except...she would never have
thrown her life away

706
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:30,160
for the likes of that Flack kid.

707
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,700
I know what you're doing.

708
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,140
I'll be back later.

709
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,860
You're stuffing up our future
and the future of this town.

710
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:38,919
What?!

711
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,820
The only thing standing between us
and a $50 million building project

712
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,099
is that bloody brass band.

713
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:48,139
Their clubhouse sits right in the middle of
what we're planning.

714
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,139
They're just a bunch of harmless
old guys who love to play music.

715
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:53,319
They were quite happy
to go home and die

716
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,980
until that idiot boy decided
to pull them back from the brink.

717
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,859
With your help. And why?

718
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,940
Kevin's doing this for his dad.

719
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,880
Not according to the bet
he's got with me.

720
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,999
What?!

721
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
A little wager he suggested
involving you.

722
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,280
Me?

723
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,599
He demanded quite a big pay-out
if they win.

724
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:12,179
And he promised never
to see you again if they lose.

725
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:14,539
I don't believe you.

726
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,960
It's amazing what some people will do.

727
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,680
And who they'll use
to get what they want.

728
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,680
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.

729
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:37,640
(Band plays up-beat tune)

730
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,300
Kevin, you need to come to the hospital right
away. It's your father.

731
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,340
- What happened?
- He knows.

732
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,200
Bugger.

733
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,599
You went behind my back
and hijacked my band.

734
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:12,539
It's not your band. You let them
walk out of here and throw it all away.

735
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,320
I won't have 20 years of blood, sweat and
tears ending up in a total debacle!

736
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,580
But they want to play!

737
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:21,139
How dare you drag them out there
to certain public humiliation...

738
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,920
No. No-one's dragging them anywhere.

739
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,780
OK? They're doing it
because they love to play the music.

740
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:29,539
- You leave the music out of this.
- There's nothing you can do about it.

741
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:33,320
If you change one bloody note of it,
I'll bloody well kill you!

742
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,500
Mandy! Dad found out we're competing and
he went ballistic!

743
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:43,720
He has no idea we changed the music or the
routine.

744
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,080
Mandy.

745
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:49,739
What happens if you lose, Kevin?

746
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,640
- What? There's no way we're...
- What happens if you lose?

747
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Oh, shit.

748
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:56,659
You made a deal with my father.

749
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,700
You used me as a bet.

750
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,340
No, Mandy. I can explain.
Please, open the door, Mandy.

751
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,840
Mandy, please, open the door!

752
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,800
Mandy, please!

753
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,659
Please, open up the door.

754
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:18,159
I'm sorry!

755
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,859
Mandy, I'm sorry!

756
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,300
Please. Mandy, I didn't mean
to hurt you. I'm sorry.

757
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,320
(Band plays slow and sad melody)

758
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:58,720
Problem with the girlfriend, Kev?

759
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,099
I was thinking about dropping around
to see her later.

760
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,820
And I'll be giving her your love,

761
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:07,499
one way or another.

762
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,260
Hey, hey! Come on, guys. Cool it!

763
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:11,459
Why don't you shut up?

764
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:13,119
(Grunts)

765
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:16,160
(Drummer laughs)

766
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,080
We're cool, aren't we, Kevin?

767
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, I thought so.

768
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,480
See you tomorrow.

769
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,160
Come on, don't let him get to you, mate.
He's not worth it.

770
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,120
Oh, no! No, no, not the guitar!

771
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,160
Not the guitar.

772
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,400
(Plays pretty melody)

773
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,600
(Plays countermelody)

774
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,440
Big day tomorrow.

775
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,600
# THIN LIZZY: Jailbreak

776
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,920
# Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak

777
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,300
# Somewhere in this town

778
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:07,079
# See, me and the boys we don't like it

779
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:10,600
# So we're getting up and going down

780
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,599
# Hiding low, looking right to left

781
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,440
# If you see us coming I think it's best

782
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,760
# To move away do you hear what I say

783
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:22,600
# From under my breath

784
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
# Tonight there's gonna be
a jailbreak... #

785
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,260
This is it, men, the big day.

786
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:31,960
Get aboard, make it fast,
we haven't got much time.

787
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,720
- Deadly.
- You look pretty good yourself, Dawn.

788
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,160
- Anyone seen Kevin?
MAN: Not here.

789
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:00,799
MAN ON RADIO: <i>As we count down</i>

- Where's your suit?
- I'm not going.

799
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:30,539
- What?!
- I'm not going.

800
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:34,179
You're right, Tommy, competitions
bring out the worst in all of us.

801
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,159
I do not believe what I am hearing.

802
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,699
Will you snap out of it?!

803
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,660
You guys are gonna be fine without me.

804
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,340
Anyway, I'm supposed to
do this talent thing tonight so...

805
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,760
Kevin, for the first time in years,

806
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,980
this band feels like a group.

807
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:54,739
We all feel like a kid again.

808
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:57,139
And it's all because of you.

809
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:01,039
I haven't had this much fun since I took
Maria to see the Duran Duran concert

810
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
in 1985!

811
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:05,459
Come on, Kevin.

812
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,180
Come on, we can wing past your place, pick
up your suit.

813
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,860
Your first rock gig can wait.

814
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
We can't.

815
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,320
This may well be our last.

816
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,899
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

817
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
OK. That's it.

818
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,059
Come on, everybody off the bus.

819
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,660
Oh, what are you doing?

820
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,360
Well, if you're not going,
we're not going.

821
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,220
One out, all out.

822
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,680
If you stay, we stay.

823
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:51,599
(Laughs)

824
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:55,099
You know, you're all a bunch
of complete bastards.

825
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,640
Yeah.

826
01:00:57,079 --> 01:00:58,079
Old bastards.

827
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Now, let's bloody well get on with it!

828
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,400
(All laugh)

829
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,800
MAN: That's my boy!

830
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,400
To the bus!

831
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,560
ALL: To the bus!

832
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:13,679
Get back in that bed immediately,
Mr Flack.

833
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:16,039
You need another fortnight's convalescence

834
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:17,759
before you can go anywhere.

835
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,380
Now, we'll let you know the scores.
The whole ward has money on it.

836
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,200
Really?

837
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,079
That's nice.

838
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,940
Yes, we got fantastic odds.

839
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:27,819
2:1 on you losing.

840
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,920
What?! Get out of my way!

841
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,320
(All cheer and laugh)

842
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,400
MAN ON RADIO:

846
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,900
Honestly, Edwin, what you're doing
is terribly dangerous.

847
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:54,159
The doctors said you shouldn't be out.

848
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,320
And by the time we get there,
it will be all over.

849
01:01:56,719 --> 01:01:59,219
It's pathetic!
You're being completely ridiculous.

850
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,900
Can't you drive any faster?

(All cheer)

861
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Stop the bus!

862
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,760
Stop the bus!

863
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,900
- Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?
- Store's closing.

864
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,280
- Well...
- They're bulldozing the block.

865
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,119
- And I'm moving to Sydney.
- What?!

866
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,820
- To study law.
- What?!

867
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:47,519
- But why?
- It's Dad's idea, not mine.

868
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:49,419
And I need a change.

869
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,080
Look, I know you
never wanna see me again

870
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,360
but there's something
I really need to tell you.

871
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,560
- What?
- The truth.

872
01:02:58,199 --> 01:03:00,199
Mandy, I never
should have made that bet.

873
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,460
But you and I had only just met

874
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,800
and I didn't think
I would ever have a chance with you.

875
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:09,040
I only did it to help my dad.

876
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:12,099
(Sighs)
- Hey, Kevin, hurry up!

877
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,120
What are you doing?!

878
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,800
Look...

879
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:19,160
Tell her you love her and get on with it!

880
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,640
I think Tommy's right.

881
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,600
I think you better go.

882
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,379
Ladies and gentlemen,

883
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:11,139
welcome to the Regional
Marching Band Championships.

884
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,300
It's a beautiful night here in Montague

885
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,760
to mark the first time the competition's been
held on this field in 20 years.

886
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,760
Hi.

887
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,820
ANNOUNCER: Tonight's winner takes
home the ultimate reward,

888
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,659
the coveted championship cup.

889
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,800
And now,
to start off tonight's proceedings,

890
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,920
last year's winner and hot favourite to make it
an incredible 19 years in a row,

891
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,579
let's give it up for
the Diamond Vale Marching Band!

892
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,880
(Cheering and applause)

893
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,400
Diamond Vale, right and centre!

894
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:53,999
March!

895
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:57,720
(Band plays Semper Fidelis)

896
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,560
Still time to stop this lunacy.

897
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,300
No, you are not stopping anything.

898
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,260
You're going into the grandstand
to take your seat and watch!

899
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,180
Get out of my way.

900
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,780
Your son does have a gift
and tonight, he's going to use it.

901
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,220
Over my dead body!

902
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,900
You will sit there and shut up
and behave yourself.

903
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,760
And by the way,
they won't be playing your music

904
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,880
or doing your
old-fashioned marching steps.

905
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:49,439
What?

906
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,260
It was Kevin's idea.

907
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,820
And I supported him
because I am proud of our son

908
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,160
and I want to be here to see him win.

909
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:02,080
With or without you.

910
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:20,699
Right. Give us your wrist.

911
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,040
Yep. Thank you.

912
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,099
How long does it take to lose
a brass band competition anyway?

913
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,480
Oh, shut up!
He'll make it in time.

914
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:35,079
We should have got rid of him
months ago.

915
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:36,659
- He's so uncool!
- Yeah.

916
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:38,819
He's slowing us down.

917
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,820
You just can't let it go, can you?

918
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,420
Mandy chose him and not you.

919
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:44,159
(Laughs)

920
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,059
I dumped the slag weeks ago.

921
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:47,859
She's so bloody frigid.

922
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,220
Oh, so does that mean
she didn't wanna sleep with you?

923
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,660
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

924
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,360
(Grunts)
- Oh-ho!

925
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,099
Anyone else got anything to say?

926
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,800
Not me.

927
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,400
(Laughs)

928
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,400
Oh, shit!

929
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:09,640
Oh, man!

930
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:15,600
# Band plays

934
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,200
Now we come to the last performance of the
night,

935
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,860
the defending runners-up.

936
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,539
They have placed a credible second
for 19 of the last 20 years.

937
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:46,320
Please, welcome the Montague Municipal
Marching Band!

938
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,400
(Dog barks)

939
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,280
- I can't bear to look.
- Don't be such a baby.

940
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,840
(Marching drum beat)

941
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,400
What the hell?

942
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,680
Wow!

943
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:03,400
Don't they look great?!

944
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,300
(Drumming stops)

945
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,059
ANNOUNCER: <i>There is a hush</i>
<i>over the grandstand</i>

946
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:19,819
<i>as Field Marshall Hamilton</i>
<i>makes his inspection.</i>

947
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,640
<i>Once complete, the final routine</i>
<i>of the evening will commence.</i>

948
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,399
Let's rock!

949
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,800

951
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,360
(Crowd cheers)

952
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:17,920
He did it for you.

953
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,880
(Barks)

954
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,680
(Wild cheering and applause)

955

ANNOUNCER: The Montague Municipal
Marching Band

956
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,459
has dazzled the crowd!

957
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,539
Ladies and gentlemen, we've just witnessed
a sensational debut

958
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,560
for band leader Kevin Flack,
son of Edwin Flack.

959
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:15,579
He's proved tonight
that he's a chip off the old block.

960
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:18,859
It's been an astonishing performance from
the home team.

961
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,520
The crowd, as you can hear,
are going ballistic!

962
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,640
No-one has ever heard
a marching band

963
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,760
deliver such a challenging choice
of repertoire

964
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:29,479
as Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit.

965
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,500
This is a first! I wonder
how the judges will take to it.

966
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,199
But I can tell you,
ladies and gentlemen at home

967
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:36,979
listening to this broadcast,

968
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:40,040
if it were up to the crowd here,
this would be a win!

969
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:51,699
- Are you sure?
- Mmm.

970
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,100
We have the results.

971
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:59,480
Please welcome Mr Whit Bernard, chairman
of tonight's judging panel.

972
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,600
The results have come down
to two bands -

973
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:09,640
Diamond Vale...

974
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:12,659
..and Montague Municipal.

975
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:14,239
Yes! Yes!

976
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,200
Both teams played well.

977
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,140
In drill, Montague scored slightly higher than
Diamond Vale.

978
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,920
(Band members cheer)

979
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,500
However, Montague went over
their allocated time.

980
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:33,899
And as a result of this breach,

981
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:35,979
they have been awarded a penalty.

982
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
(Crowd groans)

983
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,500
I have therefore decided that a play-off will
decide the winner.

984
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,739
- A play-off?!
- Play-off?!

985
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:47,079
A play-off?!

986
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:49,359
Gentlemen, you have 15 minutes
to prepare.

987
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:51,819
- 15 minutes?!
- 15 minutes?!

988
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,319
15 minutes.

989
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,180
We're ready to go now.

990
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,060
(Glasses clink)

991
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,020
We've got nothing prepared.

992
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:00,899
Nothing but the old stuff.

993
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,699
- We can't do that.
- Stuffed.

994
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,560
Yep, we'll look like bloody idiots.

995
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,460
I'm sorry, guys, I should never
have gotten you into this.

996
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,180
What the hell was I thinking?
How could I be so stupid?

997
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,300
Dad is going to kill me!

998
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:14,320
OK, this has been the biggest mistake...

999
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,000
That was pretty impressive
playing, lads.

1000
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:33,560
And very fine leadership, Kevin.

1001
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,680
I was surprised.

1002
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,300
And very proud...

1003
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,560
..of the lot of you.

1004
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,300
What are we going to do?

1005
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Well, there's only one thing you can do.

1006
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,979
Play the number from 1990.

1007
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,639
- You've gotta be kidding!
- What?!

1008
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,880
Only this time, you're gonna get it right.

1009
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,520
- We can't do that!
- We haven't rehearsed it!

1010
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:02,419
Rehearsed?! (Laughs)

1011
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:04,159
19-bloody-90!

1012
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:07,319
How could you possibly have forgotten?

1013
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:09,899
It's a memory that's seared
into all of our brains forever.

1014
01:13:11,319 --> 01:13:13,319
We can't play that without a euphonium!

1015
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:14,699
You were robbed.

1016
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,640
You were at least 15 seconds
within time.

1017
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:20,579
Someone got to that timekeeper.

1018
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,960
And I won't play with cheats.

1019
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,040
And besides, I think you need my help.

1020
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:32,360
Since I bet I can guess what Edwin wants us
to play next.

1021
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,500
Even though I am...
a geriatric fat bastard dick.

1022
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,760
(All laugh)

1023
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:42,379
No, you're just a dick.

1024
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:45,579
- Especially in that uniform.
- You can't go out looking like that.

1025
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:47,520
Sorted.

1026
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:51,360
(Mobile phone rings)

1027
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,760
Oh, no! It's Simon.

1028
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,560
He's in the car park
to pick me up for the talent quest.

1029
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,100
Kevin, I don't think we can ask you
to stay with us this time.

1030
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,880
You've done your duty by us and more.

1031
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:12,800
There's nothing you can do
to help us out of this one.

1032
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,400
I hope you knock 'em dead, son.

1033
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:36,280
(Band plays The Washington Post
in background)

1034
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:42,399
Oh, yeah.

1035
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:44,720
Hurry, mate.

1036
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Look, I'm sorry, Simon, I'm not going.

1037
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:52,579
We're not playing. Damien threw
himself into your guitar head first.

1038
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,739
- I'm sorry, mate.
- Two minutes.

1039
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:56,579
What's going on?

1040
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,180
It's a play-off, us against Diamond Vale. I
gotta go!

1041
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:02,960
(Thunder)

1042
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,300
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,

1043
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,100
Diamond Vale have delivered
an outstanding play-off number.

1044
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,180
And now the question is

1045
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,880
can the Montague Municipal Marching Band
reply to that challenge?

1046
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,920
If they can only pull this off.

1047
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,560
You know you did a really good job.

1048
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:33,899
Helping Kevin with that arrangement.

1049
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:35,039
He told you?

1050
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:36,079
No.

1051
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:37,960
I could tell.

1052
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,640
(Crowd cheers)

1053
01:15:42,199 --> 01:15:45,200
(Band plays MacArthur Park
by Jimmy Webb)

1054
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,880
(Thunder)

1055
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,400
(Both laugh)

1056
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,040
# Dramatic music

1057
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,400
# Music rises to crescendo

1058
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:16,320
Hey, Kev. Look.

1059
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:22,960
Mandy, what are you doing here?

1060
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:27,899
I thought you might need this...
for the talent quest.

1061
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,560
You can borrow it for the night.

1062
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:35,200
It's getting real ugly out there, mate.
You don't wanna look.

1063
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,400
Mandy, will you wait here till I get back?

1064
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,560
- Then you have a plan.
- I have a plan.

1065
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:43,040
Simon, come on!

1066
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,100
And you're a dancer, not a lawyer.

1067
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,120
(Thunder)

1068
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,800
I know.

1069
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:58,680
# Slow, dramatic music

1070
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
(Kevin plays electric guitar)

1071
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,600
(Band joins Kevin)

1072
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:35,000
(Laughs)
- Yeah!

1073
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:44,120
(Laughs)

1074
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,560
(Laughs)

1075
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,320
Yeah! Rock on!

1076
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,600
(Silence)

1077
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,800
(All cheer and applaud)

1078
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:37,840
(Dog barks)

1079
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:52,760
(Mouths)

1080
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,440
Hmm!

1081
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:32,840
CROWD CHANTS: Montague! Montague!
Montague! Montague!

1082
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,320
(Crowd cheers and applauds)

1083
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:00,199
Kevin!

1084
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,280
Kevin, you did it! You did it!

1085
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:14,800
(Men argue)

1086
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:30,440
You could get disqualified for that.

1087
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
(Laughs)
