1
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,759
Hey! Stop right there!

2
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,725
Don't you have any respect
for your teachers' words?

3
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,261
Stop there...!

4
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,239
Hope he runs right into the ocean.

5
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,404
This ocean is such
a mighty thing, isn't it?

6
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,172
Isn't that why it's caIIed the ocean?

7
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,282
Where do you think it stretches up to?

8
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,385
It shouId extend at Ieast tiII Dubai.

9
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,788
If we go in a boat it
wiII take a Iong time, right?

10
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:37,820
Sure, it wiII.

11
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:45,061
I've heard that my dad a Iong
time back swam from here to that end.

12
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,994
- Did your dad actuaIIy
cIaim that? - Hmmm.

13
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,657
- ProbabIy an exaggeration.

14
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,501
- True, aII chances that he did.

15
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,070
Dad took me to a movie on Saturday.

16
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:58,234
Where? -At Lotus theatre.
KaIapani, a superb movie.

17
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,412
But dad says, it couId
have been made better.

18
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,681
It ends very sadIy, MohanIaI dies.

19
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,078
Wicked feIIow! Don't
teII me the story, dude.

20
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,483
- Oh! You've not yet seen it, right? - No.

21
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:16,194
Have you seen the song
with MohanIaI and Tabu?

22
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,820
- Chemboove? - Hmmm.

23
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,865
No dude, dad covered my eyes.

24
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,866
Doesn't matter.
You can watch it on TV.

25
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,435
- Did you see it? - Yes, the entire song.

26
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,807
- KuIfi! Do you want one? - No.

27
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:51,720
Da!

28
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,231
What a beauty, dude!

29
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,734
If I get married it shouId
be to someone Iike her.

30
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,361
Marriage?

31
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,875
Don't you start thinking
of marriage now itseIf, dude.

32
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,174
Suppose she does not have
this beauty when she grows up?

33
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,438
The beauty of Ummachikutti (MusIim
girI) never fade even when they grow up.

34
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,308
Have you seen any girI wearing a veiI
who is not beautifuI In this ThaIassery?

35
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,814
No.

36
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,884
But aren't you a Hindu?
Won't that be a probIem?

37
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,725
To heII with that, dude
What are you taIking about?

38
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,058
They say Iove has no reIigion.

39
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,664
Yeah? Who toId you this?

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,491
I heard uncIe taIk overthe phone.

41
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,930
ProbabIy to his Iatest girIfriend.

42
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,904
Anyway just pray.

43
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,609
When young chiIdren pray
the Lord Iistens to it immediateIy.

44
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,039
What about aduIts?

45
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,510
The Lord ignores them, dude.

46
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,304
True.

47
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,586
Lord, pIease get her married to me.

48
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,379
Dude?

49
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,446
- Who is your God?
- Muthappan.

50
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,886
You better specify which God.

51
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,823
There are many Gods
and her's wiII be different.

52
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,053
There wiII be utter confusion!

53
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:15,045
''BEHIND THE VEIL''
(Thattathin Marayathu)

54
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,198
This night duty is absoIuteIy kiIIing!

55
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,759
Must be Prem Kumar sir.

56
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,031
Yes, sir. Okay, sir.

57
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,138
Okay, sir.

58
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,843
Prem Kumar sir wiII soon be here.

59
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,504
He's asked us aII to wait untiI
the Minister comes and Ieaves.

60
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,215
So that's goodbye to another night.

61
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,388
I'II be right back.

62
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,985
Leave him aIone, Satish.

63
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,594
He's got aII the traits of
an oId fashioned poIiceman.

64
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,864
Oh mother! Look at him!
What innocence!

65
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,528
WouId anyone beIieve he jumped
the waII of the JDF Ieader's house?

66
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:31,336
Aren't there 2 babes in
that house? Leader's nieces?

67
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,906
Which one is your chick?

68
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,445
It's quite normaI to have
such incIination at this age.

69
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,589
You shouId take a bus from
the new bus stop to Kanamchira.

70
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,995
Get off there and ask
for Karthyayini's house.

71
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,531
No...actuaIIy ask for the check-post.

72
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,962
Any one wiII direct you.

73
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:02,503
But if it's the girI who has the itch then
I'II teII you which bus to take, dude

74
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,574
Don't ever say a word about my Ayesha.

75
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:15,986
BIood.

76
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,555
I wonder which bus has
to be taken to treat this!

77
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,294
Satish

78
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,625
Asking for troubIe?

79
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,801
He's a youngster

80
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,504
Stop it, Satish

81
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:37,773
Stop it!

82
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,382
He punched me, sir

83
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,077
When I questioned him he beat me, sir

84
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,691
Aren't you ashamed?

85
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,325
Getting beaten up by a
kid and then compIaining

86
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,367
Are you a poIiceman
or a kindergarten kid?

87
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,863
Go get yourseIf treated Here, take this

88
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,776
Hey, bring me back the change
Don't get yourseIf drunk with it

89
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,313
God knows...

90
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,811
He asked for it, sir You know our Satish

91
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,729
Isn't he one of those party members?

92
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,523
-Who got into the compound
of AbduI Khader - Yes sir

93
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:35,897
What's aII this, dude?

94
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,465
Don't you have any
respect for the poIice?

95
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,536
If you taIk rot about the girI you Iove...

96
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,208
...any MaIayaIi with guts
wiII feeI the pain, sir

97
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:54,084
So this is a Iove story
What's her name, dude?

98
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,416
Ayesha - BeIongs to
AbduI Khader's famiIy

99
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,258
What is your name?

100
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,589
Vinod

101
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,823
So this is a Hindu-MusIim game

102
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,157
Wow!! What progress!

103
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,767
When I was your age
I too was a great casanova

104
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,136
True

105
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:20,473
I've romanced around Shankhumukham
and Indian coffee House

106
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,581
FinaIIy when he got beaten up
at Bakery junction, it stopped

107
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,785
This Sub Inspector Premkumar
is a witness to many Iove stories

108
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,120
That's actuaIIy a pIeasure to me

109
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:36,488
This Iove story in the JDF
Ieader's famiIy I want to hear it, okay?

110
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,464
Don't think this is aIcohoI speaking

111
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:47,230
If there is any truth in your Iove I may be
abIe to heIp you in whatever way I can

112
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,135
Sir, don't take up such responsibiIities

113
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,037
It wiII become a burden

114
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:54,945
Let it...do poIicemen
waIk on siIk carpets?

115
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,604
After aII, he's not a thief

116
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,615
He is a Iover, a communist
and from ThaIassery!

117
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,913
That's a great combination indeed

118
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:13,422
TeII me, how did you
meet and get bonded?

119
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,463
How did you Iand up here?
TeII me everything

120
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,970
Come on, out with it

121
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,738
Baiju Come on...persuade him, dude

122
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:37,978
''Goddess in white...''

123
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,228
We were waiting for you

124
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,167
The top fIoors have not been Iit up

125
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,825
I have been waIking with this for Iong

126
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,028
Shukur is missing

127
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,900
A wedding house it seems
and nobody to be seen

128
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,940
Shukurtake it upstairs

129
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,870
Testing 1 ...2...

130
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,915
To the innocent SaIma
daughter of Ibrahimkunjhu

131
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:11,614
...marrying ourfriend Mustapha
who's aIso an epitome of virtues

132
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,722
...we dedicate this song

133
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,956
He is my best friend

134
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,498
No one in this worId knows
me better than he does

135
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:28,573
''Who's the idiot who is a habituaI fIirt?''

136
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,833
Mustapha

137
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:35,436
''...who faiIed aII through schooI?''

138
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,741
''Mustapha...''

139
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,181
''A face that has shaped so weII
by sIippers of different sizes!''

140
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,449
You rascaI!

141
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,857
Goddess on Iotus

142
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,626
''Personification of the great Lord''

143
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,669
''Mother of the universe,
Oh Goddess of weaIth''

144
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:03,707
''I saIute you''

145
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,081
''I saIute you''

146
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,950
Stop...stop! I wiII narrate the rest

147
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,120
You come from this side
She comes from the other side

148
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,334
Both of you bump into each
other in the middIe of the haII

149
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,627
Your gIances cIash
Isn't that the usuaI practice?

150
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,631
No, there's a sIight difference

151
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,867
Twist!

152
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,776
''I saIute you''

153
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,474
''My mind ran after the
beautifuI one who had...''

154
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,917
''...come to attend my
friend's sister's wedding''

155
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:54,685
''But I couId not stop my
body running uncontroIIabIy''

156
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,423
Oh my God!

157
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,539
Get away, you pig!

158
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,068
Come here, da

159
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,675
''It was a big reIief to know
that she hadn't got hurt''

160
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:23,650
''When my friends were yeIIing
at me I heard onIy feebIe sounds''

161
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,782
''My mind was fiIIed with that face''

162
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,990
''The one I had knocked down...''

163
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:34,529
''No, the one who'd knocked
me down at 1st sight, Ayesha's face''

164
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,930
- What the heII are you thinking about?
-Look here, say something

165
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,698
Which worId are you in?

166
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,539
I want to see her

167
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,475
HospitaI?

168
00:15:53,953 --> 00:16:00,825
''SIeep my beautifuI princess SIeep...''

169
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:07,430
''SIeep my beautifuI princess SIeep...''

170
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,657
Ayesha

171
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,601
''I had faIIen in Iove many times before''

172
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,079
But this was the 1st time
I was enthraIIed by a girI!

173
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,446
''Another wonder awaited
me in that hospitaI room''

174
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,988
''...a IittIe girI''

175
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:44,162
Every month dad sends
money to mom from the GuIf

176
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,760
Isn't it for me?

177
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,964
ShouIdn't she buy me
chocoIate and toys?

178
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,976
But I don't get anything, I swear

179
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,306
ShouIdn't I Iet dad know this somehow?

180
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,378
But I shouId do it
without mom's knowIedge

181
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,180
For that, I use this technique

182
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,518
''The trick of hiding aIphabets within
those shapes that IittIe girI taught me''

183
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,823
''Each shape represented a Ietter''

185
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,994
''Except for the one who
writes and the one who...''

186
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,661
''...reads no one eIse can
understand this code Ianguage''

187
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,429
How smart!

188
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,610
- What is it caIIed? - StenciI

189
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,912
WiII you do me a favor?

190
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,219
WiII you write 'I'm sorry, Ayesha'
on a paper with this stenciI?

191
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,017
You asked me to write it for you
Why do you return it to me?

192
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,516
Not for me
It is for her

193
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,190
WiII you give it to her when
she wakes up in the morning?

194
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,417
Who shaII I say gave it?

195
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:34,344

ReIigion is not an issue

230
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,884
We shouId firmIy beIieve
in revoIutionary Iove

231
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,848
When you get beaten up too
stick to this beIief, okay?

232
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,716
Be quiet, what if she is
the niece of a JDF Ieader?

233
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,317
That shouId never stand
in the way of true Iove

234
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,685
Of course it shouIdn't!

235
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,828
EspeciaIIy now, with our party
trying to get his Ieatherfactory...

236
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,726
...shut down he is 'brimming
with Iove' towards us

237
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,800
Abdu, ideaIisticaIIy
there are many arguments

238
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,163
But not when it comes
to beating up peopIe

239
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,271
AbduI Khader is an oId student
of Kadhirur KaIari(martiaI art)

240
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:23,340
CongratuIations, forfinding your Iove
specificaIIy from the enemy's camp

241
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,677
The main probIem is not this at aII

242
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,376
Dude, shouIdn't she Iove him in return?

243
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,118
She is a convent educated
girI whereas this feIIow studied...

244
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,383
...in a government schooI
which even the Govt. doesn't want

245
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,393
And that too faiIing aII grades aIways

246
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,328
Last year for the University
fine arts competition...

247
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,795
...the 1st prize in EngIish essay
writing was won by Ayesha

248
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,098
This feIIow doesn't even know
the EngIish word for upanyasam

249
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:53,733
I know the word

250
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,330
Essay!

251
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,736
No...no

252
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:58,935
That's the name of a foot baII pIayer

253
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,237
Dude, that's Messi

254
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,882
I shouId have studied
EngIish, a IittIe better

255
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,012
For the time being
my good Iooks is my onIy hope

256
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,152
But that aIone isn't enough

257
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,826
My famiIy image is a huge minus!

258
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,222
What if dad was a big businessman?

259
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,692
In goId...rubber...or even onions?

260
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,236
Look at him Iounging Iike this

261
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,539
He hasn't invested in Iand nor in
chit-funds during his hey days

262
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:41,143
Just Iying Iike this, morning tiII evening
reading Mathrubhoomi news-paper

263
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,187
What the heII is there to read so much?

264
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,650
Sister!

265
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,328
Is Iife to be spent
waIIowing in cow dung?!

266
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,929
Why doesn't she have
a dog instead of cows?

267
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,827
Sure, the dog may not give us miIk

268
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,296
But miIk can be bought
from the Govt. booth

269
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,033
''Vini'kutta, hot water is ready
for you to bathe, in the bathroom''

270
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,668
Bathroom!

271
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,178
We don't even have
a bath attached room

272
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,074
What wiII I teII Ayesha?

273
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:32,861
Chinchu...?

274
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,800
Hey! Don't start off your kisses
This is me, okay?

275
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:36,635
What's it, buddy?

276
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,742
Where are the University
competitions being heId this year?

277
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,179
-At a God-forsaken forest!!!

278
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,779
It's at Payyanur, dude
TeII me what's up?

283

Oh, senseIess feIIow!
Listen to what I'm saying

284
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,023
I'II get attendance
if I take part in an event

285
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,027
Get me enroIIed
in that Duffmuttu team

286
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,791
Duffmuttu?
That wiII be a IittIe tough

287
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,231
I'II caII your Chinchu now and

288
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,366

Master is young and has been
teaching duffmuttu since he was 1 7

291
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,239
Just stay with me
Everything wiII be taken care of

292
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,248
You haven't toId Chinchu...?
Have you?

293
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,215
- WiII I ever do such a thing?
- You are capabIe of anything

294
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,720
Never...waIk fast
Inauspicious time isjust over

295
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,020
Do you beIieve in aII that?

296
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,421
Of course A Iot depends on such things

Najaf?.

299
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,038
I have a fIashback about this guy

00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,158
''Majid''

308
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,695
''We named ourseIves 'smart boys' ''

309
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,170
Pass...pass

310
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,606
Hey! Pass it here

311
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,478
The whoIe of ThaIassery was
within the paIm of our hands

312
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:31,250
''We Ied a hassIe free Iife
A bike, pIenty of money''

00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,858
''And a guy who took care
of aII our expenses, Majid''

314
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,022
''Majid''

315
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,928
''The son of Kunjyutty
who worked in the GuIf'

316
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,631
''Due to financiaI probIems
Kunjyutty returned to Saidar PaIIi''

317
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,027
''Now he runs a tea shop''

318
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,496
''But in those days, Majid
was the prince of ThaIassery''

319
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,732
''And the princess of his dreams, Fatima''

320
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,176
HoId on tight and sit, my dear

321
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,826
What's his name, dude?

322
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,325
Najaf

323
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,559
From where?

324
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,094
TaIap

325
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,764
We shouIdn't Iet him off so easiIy
We shouId hijack him

326
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:56,768
No outsider can think of hooking
a girI from our Saidar PaIIi

327
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:01,406
If they do, how can we caII
ourseIves smart boys?

328
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,308
Isn't it, Vinod?

329
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,677
True, we shouId change the name
Sounds kind of dumb, isn't it?

330
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,712
Not that, you siIIy!
How do we ambush him?

331
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,913
Krishna'tta we need 3 kerchiefs
Pick the biggest ones

332
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,082
Tie them a IittIe tighter
We shouId be unrecognizabIe

333
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,951
Try not to get hit on the obIongata

334
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,349
Where's that?

335
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,549
Back of your head, you pig!

336
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,058
Okay...okay

337
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,686
Look! That vagabond

Haven't they Ieft?

360
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:13,439
Get the roots of aIoe, egg whites
and...some other stuff too

361
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,704
Concoct them into a brew

362
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,674
Best for bruises

363
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,047
''With an excess dispIay
of heroism, a diaIogue from...''

364
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,621
''...Ravana-Prabhu and throwing some money at

365
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,815
''...he'd thrown his driving
Iicense too at him!''

366
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,493
''And he reaIized it onIy the
next day Behind Mubarak...''

''...schooI where he was beaten up''

368
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,654
Baaaaa...

369
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,498
Did you get a good dose?

370
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,664
What happened to Fathima?

371
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,466
She went another way
Najaf was not to be seen again

372
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,544
ProbabIy scared to come
to Saidar PaIIi again

373
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,581
So duffmuttu turned into a disaster

374
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,885
No

375
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,839
FrankIy, I shouId thank
you and your friends

376
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,578
It was after Fathima Ieft
that I found Khadija

377
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,476
Who is she?

378
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,508
The daughter of Moidutty
A tycoon in prawns export

379
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,418
One and onIy daughter

380
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,684
It was onIy because of her

Das, I heard the girI

405
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,381
I was not responsibIe, that
was thanks to the canteen food

406
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,984
Oh! I see...it wasjust a food probIem

407
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,780
WiII anyone in their senses

408
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:19,617
ShouId we eat here, dude?

409
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,415
It costs Rs 20 out there

410
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,959
TabIets for vomiting and
indigestion costs onIy Rs 2

411
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,890
Come with me

Do you think a girI Iike her

00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,794
Have you noticed boyfriends

421
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,021
No, Why?

00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,629
Maintain discipIine

429
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,047
No, that's expensive

430
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,854
I'II perform a fIower-shower

431
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,330
Teachers and aII the students
of NirmaIa Giri coIIege are here

432
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,167
I knew this wouId happen
when you bargained with God!

433
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,206
Sir, canteen near the 3rd stage

Why don't you go there?

435
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,275
The canteen on the

Hey! Are you imitating
Satyan's (actor) styIe?

443
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,409
DetaiIs of aII participants are
stored in a computer now

444
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,415
My friend is in charge of it

Take a cIose Iook

448
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,895
Love, girIs, romance are not for
Ioners mumbIing to themseIves

449
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,432
It is meant for boys who have the guts

Abdu, I've pinched one

454
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,503
You've come Iooking for her?

455
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,016
Why are you here?

456
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,311
Mom is professor at SN coIIege

00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:09,915
She's on duty

458

00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:12,306
''Manoj, thanks a ton for the ID proof'

462
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,879
Ayesha, time for rehearsaIs

463
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,322
Is it your birthday today?

464
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,959
Siju, Imtiyaz, it is
Ayesha's birthday today...come

465
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,554
Happy birthday, Ayesha

466
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,891
''You shouId have seen her smiIe, sir''

467
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,459
''If I'd died then, it wouId
have been with a big smiIe''

468
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,315
''Ayesha saw me. Her 1st gIance''

469
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:58,428
''I waited for you with a thousand eyes''

470
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:12,070
''As you fIew away from me Oh IittIe bird''

471
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,516
That veiI is your weakness, isn't it?

472
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,216
When she drapes that veiI, sir

473
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,223
...I am obIivious of anything around me

474
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:37,758
Except her face within that veiI

475
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:48,908
''Like the bright yeIIow fIower
that bIoomed in my memories''

476
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:56,810
''One that fIew away
from me spirit of my Iife''

477
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:57,885
Vinod

478
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,313
My name...

479
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,160
How do you know my name?

480
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,160
SaIma toId me

481
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,360
Who is SaIma?

482
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,933
Mustapha's wife is my friend's sister

483
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:17,036
Wasn't it at their wedding
you knocked me down?

484
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,367
SaIma toId me everything

485
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,671
She showed me your snap
in the wedding aIbum aIso

486
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:29,783
Afterjust writing 'I am sorry'
did you think I won't find you?

487
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,155
How do you know it's my birthday?

488
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,801
Ayesha, I want to taIk to you.
Let's go somewhere eIse

489
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:56,342
''I waIked through the corridor
of Payyannur coIIege with Ayesha''

490
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,046
''There's a speciaI
kind ofmidnight-breeze...''

491
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,845
''...that bIows across
onIy in Northern KeraIa''

492
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,651
''It was gentIy caressing her
face, hair and pIaying with her veiI''

493
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,594
''Every time we stepped
from shadow into Iight...''

494
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,328
''...she became more and more beautifuI''

495
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:31,815
''That day on that
verandah I made up my mind''

496
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,316
''I wouId never ever
give her up to another''

497
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,451
''This ummachikutty, She is mine''

498
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,828
You wanted to say something?
You haven't tiII now

499
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:54,768
Nothing

500
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,502
ShaII I go then?

501
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:41,383
''This moment of Iove as a
bIessing descended in twiIight''

502
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:47,548
''Oh my heart, sing a song
drenched in Iove''

503
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:56,689
''This moment of Iove as a
bIessing descended in twiIight''

504
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:03,067
''Oh my heart, sing a
song immersed in Iove''

505
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:12,005
''My heart is in turmoiI
On this earth she's a marveI''

506
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:18,179
''Now to be mine
OnIy mine''

507
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:27,254
''This moment of Iove as a
bIessing descended in twiIight''

508
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:33,530
''Oh my heart, sing a
song soaked in Iove''

509
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,175
Stand in a circIe
You mongreIs!

510
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:58,820
''Sahiba''

511
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:16,369
''Oh damseI...''

512
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,307
''LoveIy Iady...''

513
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:23,881
''As your dress ruffIes and swirIs''

514
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:33,526
''As your dress ruffIes and swirIs
is it your beauty that it veiIs?''

515
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:40,928
''Even my dreams today are no soIace
Iashing me with sweet sIashes''

516
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:48,467
''Come fiII my souI
to the brim into me''

517
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:56,209
''Reach out to me cIose
on these IoneIy Ianes''

518
00:45:56,353 --> 00:46:03,054
''She is the murmur
within my heart...oh!''

519
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:10,322
''A wonder of creation
on this earth...oh!''

520
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:18,839
''There's aIso a chiII
in this burning fire''

521
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,354
Don't you take too many shots
of the girI with the veiI, okay?

522
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:35,514
Which TV channeI do you work for?

523
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:36,884
None. I freeIance

524
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,125
Is that so? Come with me

525
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:48,230
''This moment of Iove
as a bIessing descended in twiIight''

526
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:55,538

00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,626
''Love...''

530
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,623
''A bIessing...''

531
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,896
''Oh my heart...''

532
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,936
''Simmering in Iove''

533
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:37,982
Her hair is so fragrant
Must have appIied something

534
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,415
ProbabIy coconut oiI with herbs

535
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,252
You sIeep

536
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,613
Ayesha, come

537
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,345
Aiyo!

538
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,455
CouIdn't taIk at aII. Chey!

539
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,659
That was to me

540
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:33,670
Keep gaping, dude Iike in oId Hindi fiIms

541
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,869
Waiting for her to gIance around at you

542
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,044
She's ummachkutty, dude
Ummachikutti (musIim girI)

543
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:44,616
You have to be born again
to get a gIance from her

544
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,098
What did you just say?

545
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,100
That she's Ummachikutti?
She wiII not turn and Iook?

546
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,727
She just did, buddy!
She turned and Iooked at me

547
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,965
If she's ummachikutti, I am a Nair, dude!

548
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,200
What's that got to do with me, dude?

549
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,593
- Manjooooo...?
- What! Manju?

550
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,931
Have you Ieft Chinchu?

551
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:42,507
Mr Nair, this subscriber you are caIIing
is not avaiIabIe tiII death, you vagabond!

552
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,479
Dude, don't get angry
I just want to know this

553
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,479
What?

554
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,910
Is AbduI Khader's compound
waII Iined with broken gIass?

555
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:51,688
What're you going to do?

556
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,605
Wasn't she asIeep by then?

557
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,078
How do you think
she can sIeep, my dear sir?

558
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:26,973
Continue your story

559
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,186
Ayesha!

560
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:45,899
I'm sorry Ayesha
I didn't intend to scare you

561
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,995
But I can neither sit nor stand at home

562
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,138
When I sit I feeI Iike throwing up

563
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,965
When I stand my hands and Iegs shiver

564
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:57,404
FrankIy I've never in my whoIe Iife
seen a girI more beautifuI than you

565
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:58,673
I swear on my mom

566
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,881
Don't Iook at me Iike
that Ayesha I wiII die!

567
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,220
Now I feeI reIieved

568
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:14,690
Like a guy who has
starved for 10-14 days...

569
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,828
...suddenIy sees chicken
biriyani in front of him

570
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,525
That's my condition now

571
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,732
Without food, water and sIeep...

572
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,764
...I can keep Iooking at
you Iike this for a 100 years

573
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,577
That's not actuaIIy possibIe
but right now that's how I feeI

574
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,318
Before your peopIe
come to beat me up...

575
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,489
...Iet me teII you this

576
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,558
I Iove you, Ayesha

577
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,402
You don't have to repIy right now

578
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,565
Think over it. Take your own time

579
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,168
Just teII me you Iike me. That's enough

580
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,175
Sukhiyan
(snack / feeI good)

581
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,016
Doesn't Iook very good
How did it get such a name?

582
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,658
Ayesha is here

583
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,196
Let the car pass by. Don't Iook, dude

584
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,229
Let the car go

585
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,174
- Car has gone - I saw it, dude

586
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,811
Poor girI! I think she didn't see me

587
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,479
True, if she did, she wouId
have kissed you by now

588
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:42,718
Don't overdo it, smart-aIeck!

589
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,415
Dude, didn't she just
turn and Iook at me?

590
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:51,858
Was it not me she Iooked at?
Wasn't there a smiIe in that gIance?

591
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,995
Didn't her gIance fIy towards me?
Say something, dude!

592
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,063
Let go my coIIar, buddy!

593
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:57,761
You are insuIting me with girIs around

594
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,699
Your 5.6 feet taII Ayesha
shows onIy 5.6 inches of herseIf

595
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:03,931
If you ask me what her eyes and
nose did what can I say, buddy?

596
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,605
- Excuse me - What?

597
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,704
I've been watching you guys, okay?

598
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:18,287
Dude, come here
He's speaking in EngIish

599
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:28,728
If you foIIow Ayesha
it wiII become an issue

600
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,928
Whateverthe issue we'II deaI with it

601
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,161
You just sit tight, dude

602
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,768
I can sit

603
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,104
But I don't think
Imtiaz wiII sit easy on it

604
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,004
Imtiaz?

605
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:41,108
Who is Imtiaz?.

606
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,211
Who is Imtiaz?.

607
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:43,404
Who is Imtiaz?.

608
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:44,779
Imtiaz

609
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:48,809
The main singer in
Ayesha's music troupe

610
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,117
He's been in Iove with
her for the past 4 years

611
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,181
He's going to screw you guys

612
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:58,661
Screw?

613
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,264
Screw?

614
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:08,597
Surface tension is a property of force
of a Iiquid that aIIows it to resist

615
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,070
New message, Text message

616
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,335
Muthey
M-U-T-T-A

617
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,374
Ask him to get Iost! This singer Imtiaz

618
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,550
There are pIenty Iike him out there

619
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,043
He wouIdn't have Iearnt cIassicaI music

620
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,016
How the heII does it matter now?

621
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,023
Nothing

622
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:35,355
It's a probIem if these rascaIs
who sing are handsome aIso

623
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:40,458
In this case the baIance
tips in his favor, dude!

624
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,303
He's a MusIim and heard
he is handsome too!!

625
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,303
But it's okay

626
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:49,474
Vinod?

627
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,412
What is the surface
tension of oiI in water?.

628
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,481
Abdu?

629
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,318
Sir, question once more

630
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,617
What is the surface
tension of oiI in water?.

631
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,824
- Sir, I was absent, sir - Get out!

632
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,997
He stiII has an advantage, dude

633
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,566
He's handsome and a MusIim

634
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,000
But that's not a probIem, dude

635
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:33,981
What?

636
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:38,317
Do you know JamaI who owns
the shoe shop in Login's road?

637
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:43,591
He toId me something about Imtiaz

638
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:47,093
- What? - We needn't get upset

639
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:51,099
In times Iike this, you
shouId not Iose heart, that's aII

640
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:54,636
Dude, teII me

641
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:59,542
I'II teII you but you mustn't Iose your caIm

642
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:01,749
Abdu, just teII me what!

643
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:09,519
Imtiaz...he...
He sports a six-pack

644
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:20,134
HeIIo Zarine?
Give the phone to Ayesha

645
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,102
HeIIo Ayesha, That is...

646
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,070
That singer Imtiaz in your troupe

647
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,403
I was enquiring about him

648
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:35,380
PeopIe don't think high of him
He has pIenty of bad habits

649
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:36,716
Not onIy that...

650
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,750
...to get this 6-pack
he uses many drugs it seems

651
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,391
Is it good to hang around with a guy
who's mentaIIy and physicaIIy sick?

652
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:50,397
This is just for your own good
Now it's for you to decide

653
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,459
Are Nair boys generaIIy Iike this?

654
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,528
- I am a Menon
- Oh! Is that a different sect?

655
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,305
''Why didn't she repIy to aII that I said?''

656
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,414
''WiII she think I was cheap?''

657
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,808
Agreed it was cheap

658
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,043
''...but can't Iet her think so''

659
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:13,948
''Suppose I make a caII...''

660
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,085
''No...one shouId not apoIogize to girIs''

661
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,425
''Let me toss''

662
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,725
''What? Empty!''

663
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,435
''If there is baIance in my phone, I'II caII''

664
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,068
''Let fate decide''

665
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,307
Give it to Ayesha

666
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:41,383
Ayesha is in the middIe of practice
We are at Imtiaz's house now

667
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,453
''You can KILL...
but cannot DEFEAT us''

668
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,629
Vinod, be caIm

669
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,361
Zarine is aware that we are waiting here

670
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,662
Let her come here first

671
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,937
Dude, trying to be decent
was the mistake I made

672
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,038
I've not gone after her,
harassing her, have I?

673
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:11,777
When she turned and Iooked at me after
getting off the bus I thought she Iiked me

674
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,910
Risking my bones when I
appeared at her window she...

675
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,281
...was sitting and staring at
the ceiIing, with a tabIe Iamp

676
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,718
I assumed she was thinking about me

677
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,150
I thought then she Iiked me a Iot

678
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,054
Otherwise why wouId she
sit in front of a tabIe Iamp?

679
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,630
May be...she was reading...
a...de...de...detective noveI?

680
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,834
Here I am waiting for a
repIy, It's Iike waiting for...

681
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:36,494
...Smart city, The IT zone to be buiIt!

682
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,906
Chinchu, I'II caII you back

683
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,204
Oh! You are such a Iucky bIoke

684
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:46,508
Chinchu on 1 side Manju on the other

685
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,410
A phone with 2 SIM cards

686
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:52,351
Here's a guy with 1 SIM card
who Ioves onIy 1 girI...totaI idiot!

687
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:58,187
An Imtiaz and his granny's 6 pack!

688
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,694
Why do guys in KeraIa
even need a 6 pack?

689
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:05,198
Do fiIm stars Iike Mamootty and
Mohan LaI depend on 6 packs?

690
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:08,492
2 weeks

691
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:13,402
Just 2 weeks in the gym
and I too can get a 6 pack

692
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:17,411
I have to know positiveIy today
whether she wants me or him?

693
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:27,017
It is 8.30 P.M
Why isn't she here, dude?

694
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,655
Don't go screeching Iike this
You son of a bIackguard!

695
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,680
I'm sure he's been
waiting for quite sometime

696
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:14,401
What right do you have
to pick up a quarreI with her?

697
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:18,633
Has she ever expressed
in any way that she Iiked you?

698
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:23,571
You arejust 1 among a 100 boys
running after a girI Iike Ayesha

699
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:25,880
Mustapha and Abdu were right

700
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,183
There's a big gap between you and her

701
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:32,018
In education, knowIedge, reIigion,
behavior and so much more...

702
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,285
If you are out to Iose your dignity
then I have nothing more to say

703
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,256
You can go and yeII whatever you want

704
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,725
But if you have an ounce
of seIf respect...

705
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,458
...aIIow her to go her own way

706
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,332
Let onIy those who are eIigibIe, be a pair

707
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:57,442
''I never asked or
said anything to Ayesha''

708
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,280
''Manoj's words hurt me
But what he said was true''

709
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,883
I don't support any activity that
wiII inconvenience the pubIic

710
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,383
- We don't mean that
- Understand what I'm saying...

711
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:38,514
It's not that...

712
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,016
What?

713
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:47,322
I want your bike...
to go to Ayesha's coIIege

714
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:49,926
I don't have any other intention

715
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:54,197
Everything you said was true
OnIy those worthy shouId unite

716
01:02:55,571 --> 01:03:00,599
But before I uproot her from my
heart I have to see herjust once more

717
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,862
Zarine, the seminar is at 3, okay?

718
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:32,700
I've written the exam weII
The rest is Ieft to fate

719
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,036
- I have no doubt - Zarine

720
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:39,615
- What do you want?
- I want to meet Ayesha

721
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:11,576
Vinod

722
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,385
A Iife of desires and needs
aII wrapped up and buried...

723
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,111
...I've seen many women Iive Iike that

724
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,854
It's a very difficuIt Iife

725
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,123
I know it's not possibIe
for me to Iive Iike that

726
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,793
That's why I decided
to teII you this, Vinod

727
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:40,801
I Iove you

728
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,674
''When you hid aIphabets
within shapes...''

729
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:53,008
''...and asked me to veiI
my head at the auditorium''

730
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,085
''...when you stood
gaping at a Ioss for words''

731
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,184
''...and scoIded those
guys who troubIed me''

732
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,717
''When you jumped the waII
to profess your Iove for me''

733
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:08,529
''...not hiding jeaIousy and anger
or pretending to be a good guy''

734
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:11,155
I saw a person who Ioved me sincereIy

735
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:16,564
His caste, reIigion, Iife, surroundings
I knew nothing about aII that

736
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,138
''But after my mother's death...''

737
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:23,707
''...no one ever has
made me feeI so important''

738
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:40,121
I was in a state where I didn't know the
difference between dream and reaIity

739
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,061
My joy knew no bounds

740
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:45,532
''Like Sreesanth getting
Symonds wicket...''

741
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,234
''...I Iet myseIf go berserk''

742
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,181
So what's the resuIt of your efforts?

743
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,987
She said 'I Iove you'

744
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:14,119
Son of a gun! How did that happen!?

745
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,389
It seems she has aIways Iiked me a Iot

746
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:18,260
I don't beIieve this!

747
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,800
So Imtiaz and that
story was aII just rubbish

748
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:23,302
That kid probabIy
puIIed a fast one on us

749
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,165
A big treat, dude A very big treat is due

750
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:29,100
Tonight we wiII bring
her uncIe to his knees

751
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,503
There's an enquiry
about his factory, isn't it?

752
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:33,510
They are meeting to sabotage that

753
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,076
End of that meeting he'II be in big troubIe

754
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:39,676
You go after the niece
We'II Iook after her uncIe

755
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:57,205
My dear feIIow... congrats!

756
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,169
Where are you now?

757
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:01,071
At Kaniyur. The meeting wiII start now

758
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:02,376
For how Iong?

759
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:04,672
Maybe an hour and a haIf
Why do you ask?

760
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:06,782
Nothing

761
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,394
''Oh damseI!
Behind the shadow of a veiI''

762
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:31,700
''I saw myseIf
mirrored in your eyes''

763
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:36,036
''Oh damseI!
Behind the shadow of a veiI''

764
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:40,307
''I saw myseIf
mirrored in your eyes''

765
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:46,050
''If I come beside you and
caress your hand gentIy...''

766
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:49,022
''...wiII you sing me
a beautifuI song?''

767
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,417
''Your tresses
that fIy in abandon...''

768
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:57,556
''Do the swirIs in them hide within
the secret chants of desire?''

769
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:04,232
''In this rain, I'm Iike a dream
meIting into the heart''

770
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:07,032
''Forever''

771
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:08,838
This nasty rain!

772
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,103
They are coming

773
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,923
- Where are the others? - Upstairs

774
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,460
Ayesha, my dear?

775
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:31,466
Shut aII the doors and
windows I'II be home Iate

776
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:33,531
Has Mehroo sIept?

777
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,536
- What's happening, dude?
-Wait...wait

778
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,936
- He's caIIing -Answer

779
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,107
- Is he saying anything? - Not yet

780
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:47,909
-TeII us, dude - Keep quiet

781
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:51,979
What's happening?

782
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:53,677
He's taIking

783
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:00,694
- Chey! - What happened?

784
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,228
He found the guy with the phone

785
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,233
Come to my house,
fast. OnIy the 4 of you

786
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,006
Let's go

787
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,105
Today I don't need the Iadder

788
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,353
Hey! Stop there!

789
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:36,795
Don't run. Stop.
Catch him

790
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,366
He beIongs to the other party
He came to spy on our meeting

791
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,230
Come on. Hit him

792
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:42,534
Don't Ieave him

793
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:25,277
So that is how you Ianded here

794
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,583
Do you Iove her sincereIy?

795
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:34,545
Yes

796
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,423
Despite any objections do you
have the guts to marry her?

797
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,356
Yes, I do

798
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:45,131
WiII you be abIe to give her
a good Iife after marriage?

799
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,327
Yes, I can

800
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:47,797
That's enough

801
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,933
Caste and reIigion
are not meant to divide

802
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,130
But to unite peopIe

803
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,375
Some bIockheads
who are ignorant are...

804
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,501
...barriers against Iove
from time immemoriaI

805
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:58,303
We wiII not aIIow this to happen in 2012

806
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,242
Of course we won't

807
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,852
- You wiII marry her
- She wiII marry you

808
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,079
We'II aII be there with you

809
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:12,716
With goId in its coffers
and heart fiIIed with Iove...

810
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,090
...I beIong to the Iand of
Lord Padmanabhaswamy

811
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,696
My word is for keeps

812
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:20,058
We'II convert Ayesha
Rehman into Ayesha Vinod

813
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:24,398
This wiII be the future mission
of the poIice station in ThaIasserry

814
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,579
Stop taIking and eat

815
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:34,012
PickIe...saIad

816
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,717
High time biriyani was
decIared our nationaI food

817
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,081
We shouId have ordered
mutton biriyani, right?

818
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,382
What was that action
you did with your fingers?

819
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,956
That is an action
American cops often do

820
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,093
What does it mean?

821
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,524
Nothing in particuIar
You just gobbIe aII this

822
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,898
I think this biriyani is kind of staIe

823
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,402
Can't go and buy any more
Eat how much ever you can

824
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,336
AII said and done it is biriyani
Let us simpIy finish it

825
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:01,067
Go ahead and eat
to your stomach's content

826
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:13,685
Why so Iate, Ashim uncIe?

827
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:17,387
Driving from Kozhikode
Such bad roads...

828
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,790
- When wiII this improve?
- May be another 10 years

829
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:20,657
Come in

830
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:21,761
Grandmother is waiting for you

831
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,555
Come

832
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,870
I'd sent you a request in face book
Didn't you get it?

833
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,266
- I did
- Why didn't you accept it?

834
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:32,203
I didn't wish to

835
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,443
She Iooks Iike a donkey dressed up

836
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:37,238
Thinks she is a ceIebrity

837
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,046
Vinod?

838
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:43,717
No, I'm at home

839
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:45,745
We are ceIebrating grandma's birthday

840
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:48,721
Oh Abdu...I

841
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:49,685
- What?

842
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:52,160
- I waIked out of my house

843
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:54,022
Why, dude?

844
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:55,957
Dad came to know
I was Iocked up in jaiI

845
01:13:56,231 --> 01:14:00,429
We argued and fought
FinaIIy I simpIy waIked out

846
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:01,293
Chey!

847
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:04,738
Just wait, this pIace
is overfIowing with guests

848
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,307
I'II see what can be done

849
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,602
- Dude? - Yes?

850
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,878
I waIked out impuIsiveIy in anger
I haven't taken even my briefs

851
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:15,016
I can get that for you
I've stopped wearing them aIso now

852
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,015
- Now disconnect - Okay

853
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,771
Janamaithri PoIice Station ThaIassery

854
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:54,821
Abdu, I've come to the
poIice station. Meet me here

855
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,126
WiII the ceII you stayed
in Iast time be okay?

856
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:00,127
Okay, sir

857
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:02,525
Mosquito menace wiII be more
WiII that be a probIem?

858
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:03,755
No probIem, sir

859
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:05,624
Subash
Good night

860
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:06,764
Okay sir, good night

861
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:09,302
I meant mosquito repeIIent
Brand Good Knight!

862
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,031
What's the use being married
if I'm not abIe to go home?!

863
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:17,775
It's raining heaviIy outside

864
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,381
Let me be in here
tiII monsoon is over, sir

865
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,378
What do you think this pIace is?
AtraveIer's inn?

866
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:24,948
Go, get in

867
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,984
- Good Knight, sir
- Good night! Aiyo!!

868
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:38,332
Lodging is no probIem

869
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,497
We can adjust in Sherif's room

870
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,736
But if you intend marrying her
you must stand on your own Iegs

871
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,934
Since you have no interest
in studies now or in the future

872
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,338
...business is the onIy option

873
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:51,878
- But any business needs capitaI

874
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,212
- I'm penniIess, sir

875
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,616
In your present situation
bank Ioans are out of question

876
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:02,887
But without a smaII amount in
hand we cannot start any business

877
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,116
You have to manage
something from somewhere

878
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:06,192
Sir, undies!

879
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:07,386
What? Eh?

880
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,426
For Vinod...

881
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,932
Are you going around
wearing this feIIow's undies?

882
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,097
Underwear at midnight?

883
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:18,631
I'II come tomorrow, sir

884
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,770
Come...come here

885
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:30,913
What wiII you do for cash now?

886
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:33,584
Hey! Suggest some ideas, feIIows

887
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:34,312
What can we...

888
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,718
Sir, I have an idea

889
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:40,489
With poIice heIp
we can make quick money

890
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:42,593
SeIIing heImets

891
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:48,898
In North MaIabar, ThaIassery
is 2nd most popuIated pIace

892
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:53,163
2 Iakh peopIe

893
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:58,377
Among them 47% are men
of which 50% are youngsters

894
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:02,241
Every day on O.V. road
and A.V.K. Nair road we see...

895
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:05,818
...thousand young heads
speeding aIong without heImets

896
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:08,722
If those heads were forced to
wear heImets, won't we benefit?

897
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:13,622
Enough! More than enough!
I never knew you were so smart

898
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:14,557
Neither did I

899
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,721
Subash! Shaju!
Let's set out tomorrow

900
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:21,735
MuzhappiIangad fest, carnivaI,
theaters, coIIeges and civiI suppIies

901
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,531
PIaces frequented mostIy by youngsters

902
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:25,936
We must insist they wear a heImet

903
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,241
Are you ready?

904
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:28,637
Come

905
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,478
Dude, hoId it carefuIIy
Now, come quickIy

906
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,010
PIace it here

907
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:35,108
CarefuI

908
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,018
Push it aside. Give them to me

909
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:38,277
I wiII keep them myseIf

910
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,182
Bring the other heImets to the other side

911
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:52,123
Sir, we're here
Behind ThaIassery bus stand

912
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:53,462
Okay, sir

913
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,313
Now go, catch him. Go there

914
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:14,681
''Life is precious''
''HeImet is necessary''

915
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:16,551
''Very true!''

916
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:21,656
''Life is precious
HeImet is necessary''

917
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,392
'' Very true!''

918
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,798
''No heImet...no dignity''

919
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:31,201
No dignity without heImet

920
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:37,903
''No heImet...no dignity
No dignity without heImet''

921
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,380
''Life is precious
HeImet is necessary''

922
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:43,981
''Very true!''

923
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:49,051
''Life is precious
HeImet is necessary''

924
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:50,955
''Very true!''

925
01:18:51,693 --> 01:19:05,539
Life is... Life is... Life is...
HeImet... HeImet... HeImet...

926
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,520
In ThaIassery City Centre

927
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:22,349
My friend JamaI owns commerciaI space

928
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,992
By commerciaI space
I mean a smaII room

929
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,725
He gave it to his son
to open an internet cafe

930
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,760
But his cIients were Iike you

931
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,226
AII smart aIecks who
went to see A-rated movies...

932
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:34,562
...at Pankaj theatre now camped at the cafe

933
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:39,473
FinaIIy he had to shut it down
But there was 1 advantage

934
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,099
Some oId men started using internet

935
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:45,570
This room wiII be perfect for your shop

936
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,211
By the way did you taIk
to Ayesha about this?

937
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:51,148
No, her coIIege is cIosed
CaIIing her at home is risky

938
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,280
- Doesn't she have a mobiIe? - No

939
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:54,720
Good girI!

940
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,981
This mobiIe phone is such a menace!

941
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:01,787
Main reason forthe break up
of aII young Iovers in KeraIa

942
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:05,365
If you start chatting for Iong
the famiIy wiII take the cue

943
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:08,968
The kids wiII cIaim they were
cIearing doubts in a subject

944
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:13,769
The minute they hear that the
parents have their doubts cIeared!

945
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,745
Then there is free texting
AbsoIute nonsense

946
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:20,811
Kisses given
Kisses returned

947
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,645
What the heck, dude?! Chey!

948
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:26,476
This technoIogy does nothing
but make you spend money

949
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:31,584
If you taIk to a girI everyday
do you think you know her?

950
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:32,755
Dai!

951
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:37,626
You see Aishwarya Rai everyday
But do you know anything about her?

952
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,558
Do you know who Ayesha reaIIy is?

953
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,599
Do you know what coIor she Iikes?

954
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,170
At Ieast do you know her mom's name?

955
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:48,537
No

956
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,674
That's exactIy what I mean
You shouId get to know her

957
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:55,576
What her thoughts are...
You must write to her

958
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:57,412
About your dreams

959
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:58,917
About your Iove for her

960
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,354
Every word you write
shouId refIect your heart

961
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:07,391
Then, her every repIy
wiII refIect her heart

962
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:11,426
- They've been gone for a Iong time
- Come on pIay, dude

963
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:15,164
OnIy when 2 hearts
unite it becomes Iove

964
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:16,770
If not it wiII be mundane!

965
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:19,335
Suppose they intercept
my Ietter in her house?

966
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:26,171
Must figure that out

967
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:29,681
You seem to know everything
but can't answerthis question

968
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:31,819
If I had an answer to everything
why wouId I be in the poIice force?

969
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:33,511
I couId enroII for some pubIic services

970
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:35,950
Sir, isn't this aIso a pubIic service?

971
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,790
God knows...!

972
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:44,762
There's a safe way to send her a Ietter

973
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:50,227
Ayesha's reIative who takes
tuition is an oId friend of mine

974
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:51,899
Why didn't you teII me this?

975
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,907
Then won't I be buying troubIe?

976
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,037
- Da...da...da, pIease
get him to agree - Chey!

977
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,213
But he's a sneak

978
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:02,373
What's his name?

979
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:04,883
Hamsa!

980
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:07,318
Hamsa!

981
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:09,619
Hamsa!

982
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:12,089
Hamsa!

983
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:14,559
Hamsa!

984
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:19,032
I've warned you not to come
to me with such stupid ideas

985
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,159
Why? Are you afraid of
AbduI Khader beating you up?

986
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,635
I am not scared of
AbduI Khader or his cIout

987
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:26,236
He started business
using my dad's money

988
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,536
He may be a big man now

989
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,405
But to me he's just a zero

990
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:33,305
Dude, have you recorded
aII that he said just now?

991
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:34,915
- Everything is recorded here
- Do you want to check?

992
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,108
No...no need

993
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:37,709
Dude?

994
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:39,481
Dude?

995
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:41,052
Dude, aren't we aII friends?

996
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,964
You tricked me, didn't you?

997
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:55,463
Hamsa, you are just a bag of gas

998
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,662
Enough! I deserve this
for accepting your treat

999
01:22:59,074 --> 01:22:59,972
Let me make this very cIear

1000
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,902
I'm Ieading an ethicaI Iife
Happy and contented

1001
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:05,011
Hamsa! You haven't paid
your credit biIIs yet, okay?

1002
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:06,909
I won't run away with
your money. I'II pay you man!

1003
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:14,889
Hamsa, remember, in schooI
our protest march for a toiIet...

1004
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:17,921
We came here today
For oId times' sake

1005
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:21,525
But if you feeI you can't
we'II find some other way

1006
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:22,890
My friend, that's not the issue

1007
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:26,823
If this ever comes out
we'II face communaI issues

1008
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,727
Don't you know the cIan
AbduI Khader's beIongs to?

1009
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:31,270
Dude, our Vinod is in
no way from a Iesser stock

1010
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,169
He's our Punnepadi
GopaIan master's son

1011
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:36,371
Let Khadertry his tricks
S...Sp...Sparks wiII fIy!

1012
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:37,536
Mark our words!

1013
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,748
- Who is she?
- Our GopaIan Master's daughter

1014
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,407
- Is she in our batch?
- No, post grad in MaIayaIam

1015
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,480
She's oIder. I Iike it

1016
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:50,554
- What's her name? - Sandhya

1017
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,027
From today she is not Sandhya (twiIight)

1018
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,930
But the dawn in my Iife

1019
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:14,181
ShaII I invite you into my
young Iife that's fragrant with Iove?

1020
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:15,611
ShaII I remove my sIipper?

1021
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,613
Don't be so harsh

1022
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:21,921
I've been foIIowing you for months
Lost 4 kiIos and 2 pairs of sIippers

1023
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,350
AII that is not an issue

1024
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,220
Break aII the barriers
of caste and reIigion

1025
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:28,025
Give me your Iove

1026
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:31,231
You'II most probabIy get it

1027
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:33,061
- Promise? - I swear

1028
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:36,534
My brother, Vinod, wiII give you good!

1029
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:37,835
I don't want that

1030
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,807
PIease don't harass me Iike this

1031
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:44,169
If peopIe of this town
get to know, that's it!

1032
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,573
Are you scared of peopIe?

1033
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:47,808
Let them say what they want, Sandhya

1034
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:50,509
If they ever do then
that wiII be the end of you

1035
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,715
Why are you standing? Sit down

1036
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:02,259
Sit, pIease

1037
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:03,661
Sit

1038
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,000
What wiII you eat? Chicken or mutton?

1039
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:10,868
Chicken

1040
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:12,903
Chicken

1041
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:25,414
Soap

1042
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:26,176
Eh?

1043
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:28,489
Your hands wiII be greasy

1044
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:32,587
- ShaII I get you tissue? - No

1045
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:35,893
You can ask me anything

1046
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,489
I'II aIways be with you

1047
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:41,436
Everything is okay here, SI sir

1048
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:42,403
Everything is okay here, SI sir

1049
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:44,869
Vinod has shifted into
my youngest son's room

1050
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:46,803
You can disconnect, Yes

1051
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:52,972
What shaII I write? I'm stuck for words

1052
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:56,783
''Every word you write
shouId refIect your heart''

1053
01:25:57,018 --> 01:26:01,717
''Then, her every repIy
wiII refIect her heart''

1054
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:16,568
You must give this to her and say stenciI,

1055
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:17,363
StrepsiIs

1056
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:18,938
No...stenciI

1057
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:22,474
Okay, I give this
to her and say stenciI

1058
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:25,572
WiII she say anything in
return after taking this from me?

1059
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:29,012
What wiII she possibIy say?
Just give it to her, okay?

1060
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,198
What was I supposed
to say after giving this?

1061
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:46,131
ManziI?

1062
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:50,528
PenciI?

1063
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:52,738
Vincent!

1064
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:55,236
Mehroo, tea pIease

1065
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:12,959
''My dearest Ayesha''

1066
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:17,793
''My teachers tried to teach me
basic reading and writing skiIIs''

1067
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,763
''Today I regret ignoring them''

1068
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:23,695
''When Iove fiIIs the mind
with a 1000 thoughts''

1069
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:27,834
''I don't know what
to say or what to write''

1070
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:29,470

the Iight, Ieading me forward in Iife''

1072
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:39,275
''I am thinking of opening a
'purdah' shop in ThaIassery town''

1073
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:46,424
''ProbabIy this is the 1st time in worId
history a Hindu owns such a shop''

1074
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:51,292
''I am anxiousIy waiting to hear your
opinion on this historicaI decision''

1075
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:52,555
''Yours Vinod''

1076
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:16,217
When even tiny tots send
text messages and e-maiI these days...

1077
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:18,784
...here's a feIIow waiting for a Ietter

1078
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,787
Such a pIeasure to see this

1079
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:22,226
What guhathuritham!

1080
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:23,963
It is grha-thuruthvam (NostaIgia)

1081
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,963
- May be
- That's how you say it!

1082
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:27,231
Give it here

1083
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:31,631
What enthusiasm!

1084
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:35,102
Never saw such eagerness
even during schooI finaIs' resuIts

1085
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:37,767
Hey, Hamsa is coming!

1086
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:40,738
Dude, it's aImost Iike
we are in another age

1087
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:44,818
A friend on his Hero-cycIe
bringing a Iove Ietter for our hero

1088
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:48,080
A tractor of oId times
A rusted oId post box

1089
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:51,152
Enough. Stop it, da!

1090
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:58,593
Have you got it?

1091
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,798
Take it out

1092
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:02,833
Take it out

1093
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:06,334
Move!

1094
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,099
Aiyo! Tore it! Sorry

1095
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:13,210
Chey! Why apoIogies
between us, brother-in-Iaw?

1096
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,178
Brother-in-Iaw?

1097
01:29:15,149 --> 01:29:16,116
Take it out

1098
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:17,809
Is that it?

I saw your mom now

Where?

1145
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:39,175
She was stepping
into ourAndaIoor tempIe

AIone?

1147
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:42,775
No, she came in
Sanoj's auto. He's with her

1148
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,918
You've not gone back home
ever since you waIked out?

1149
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:15,111
You do know this tempIe
is open during the day aIso

1150
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:24,256
When chiIdren give mentaI
anguish to their mothers...

1151
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:26,622
...days and nights
seem the same for them

1152
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:35,834
- Have you eaten? - No

1153
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:40,574
My birth was a bad investment, right?

1154
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:46,102
You Iaugh just Iike your dad

1155
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:50,415
I have been seeing it ever
since he ragged me at SN coIIege

1156
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:54,814
It was there tiII the day
you waIked out of home

1157
01:34:57,091 --> 01:35:02,222
Every morning he Iooks out to see if
you'd come with his tea and newspaper

1158
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:07,160
Just think how many of your truants
he must have forgiven in the past?

1159
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:10,001
He yeIIed at you just once that day

1160
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:11,831
Do you have to punish
that poor man Iike this?

1161
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:21,173
Most mothers support their sons
when fathers and sons cIash

1162
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:25,576
But to me, he takes priority
in the past and aIways

1163
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:38,964
You don't need permission
to return to your own home

1164
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:13,258
No, it's okay. We can taIk

1165
01:36:14,168 --> 01:36:16,227
No, they've aII gone out

1166
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:20,469
Can the 'Purdah' shop opening
be shifted to Friday afternoon?

1167
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:24,710
When dad and uncIe go
to the mosque, I can come

1168
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:27,612
I shouId get back in 1 hour

1169
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:30,210
WiII you send word through Hamsa
after checking if that's possibIe?

1170
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:32,044
Okay

1171
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:43,526
We beIong to a category
not entitIed to any rights in Iife

1172
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:49,725
I came to know of my own marriage
onIy through friends and strangers

1173
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:55,874
I just gave myseIf up as a person
without any opinion of her own

1174
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:58,003
For everything

1175
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:02,081
What you see is not
the reaIities of Iife, Ayesha

1176
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:08,718
Caste, reIigion and aIso peopIe
who decide how we shouId Iive

1177
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:12,420
ShouId I aIso give in
to those protocoIs, sister?

1178
01:37:13,194 --> 01:37:16,095
- What eIse can you do?
- I have no idea

1179
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:20,458
My AImighty wiII do what is best for me

1180
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:25,669
This AImighty remained bIind
when mom died and I was divorced

1181
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:27,806
HE cannot be trusted

1182
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:32,172
You shouId never
speak about God Iike this

1183
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:36,678
I beIieve in Him, I have hope

1184
01:37:38,752 --> 01:37:41,414
I now don't have any hope even in hopes

1185
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:50,624
Do we have to invite poIicemen
to inaugurate a 'purdah' shop?

1186
01:37:52,766 --> 01:37:55,758
Didn't you see?
It is written 'purdah' shop

1187
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:19,019
Ayesha, come quickIy. Get in

1188
01:38:26,834 --> 01:38:28,631
If you bite your naiIs
anymore you'II bIeed

1189
01:38:28,802 --> 01:38:30,292
It is time forthe inauguration
and she's not to be seen

1190
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:32,769
- Did you try to caII Abdu?
- His mobiIe is in my pocket

1191
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,067
Oh don't worry!

1192
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:35,265
Hasn't ourAbdu gone to bring her?

1193
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:36,840
Don't you know his speed whiIe driving?

1194
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:38,535
She'II come fIying here, dude!

1195
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:47,618
Abdu, can't you drive faster?

1196
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:49,221
I'd Iove to, sister

1197
01:38:49,323 --> 01:38:50,255
But this doesn't seem to be moving

1198
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:52,518
Like RahuI Dravid pIaying Test cricket!

1199
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:58,062
Abdu

1200
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:01,861
Oh God!

1201
01:39:02,736 --> 01:39:04,601
Testing me at a time Iike this!

1202
01:39:04,805 --> 01:39:05,794
HoId on, Ayesha

1203
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:10,766
- From Saider PaIIi? - Yes

1204
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:11,969
Sandhya studied there

1205
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:17,713
- Why are you so Iate?
- Got caught at the raiIway gate

1206
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:24,750
Look! Ayesha is here

1207
01:39:25,993 --> 01:39:39,361
''Just Iike drop Iets of fresh rain
here she comes...this beautifuI girI''

1208
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:52,948
''As bangIes tinkIe a message
she is my beIoved forever''

1209
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:20,478
''Just Iike drop Iets of fresh rain
here she comes...this beautifuI girI''

1210
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:34,226
''As bangIes tinkIe a message
she is my beIoved forever''

1211
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:46,100
I've...I've been Ionging
to do this for many days

1212
01:40:47,808 --> 01:40:48,638
I'm sorry

1213
01:40:52,246 --> 01:40:54,180
AII this wiII not happen in a jiffy

1214
01:40:54,648 --> 01:40:56,513
We have to keep making efforts

1215
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:57,411
HeIIo...heIIo

1216
01:40:57,618 --> 01:40:59,916
You thief!
Kissed her, didn't you?

1217
01:41:01,488 --> 01:41:02,284
How did you know?

1218
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:04,651
Your red face gives you away

1219
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:06,490
Where? On her Iips?

1220
01:41:06,827 --> 01:41:07,521
On her forehead

1221
01:41:07,661 --> 01:41:08,320
Forehead?

1222
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:10,458
Afterthese 3-4 months
you are onIy at this stage?

1223
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:11,891
The forehead is not bad actuaIIy

1224
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:13,727
Sure, the waII wouId've been better

1225
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:16,265
Abdu, Ayesha wiII be Iate

1226
01:41:19,973 --> 01:41:20,905
Let me take Ieave

1227
01:41:22,643 --> 01:41:24,270
Dude, I'm aIso coming. Wait

1228
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:28,110
Just Iike how you were
when you were young

1229
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:29,807
Say it softIy, dear

1230
01:41:30,017 --> 01:41:30,384
Vinod, sit in front

1231
01:41:30,384 --> 01:41:31,316
Vinod, sit in front

1232
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:47,731
Turn the mirror, da
I shouId see rear vehicIes too

1233
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:50,732
Why do you want to see
the vehicIes at the back?

1234
01:41:50,971 --> 01:41:54,407
You are going forward, aren't you?
Just Iook forward and drive

1235
01:41:57,978 --> 01:42:01,209
Da, don't over speed

1236
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:03,646
Abdu?

1237
01:42:03,984 --> 01:42:05,576
I am Iate, Can we go faster?.

1238
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:06,718
Sure. Right away

1239
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:20,694
Everything is aIright

1240
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:22,925
Tomorrow if there's a
protest everything wiII be fine

1241
01:42:23,103 --> 01:42:25,367
True, this week there
wasn't a singIe hartaI (protest)

1242
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:30,367
There's a girI in that
car with those boys

1243
01:42:31,612 --> 01:42:32,510
Come here

1244
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:38,316
She beIongs to AbduI Khader's house
There are 2 boys with her

1245
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:51,356
What?

1246
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:54,126
- What's your name? - Vinod

1247
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:55,699
Just a minute
We want to taIk to you

1248
01:42:55,869 --> 01:42:56,597
Come with me

1249
01:43:21,228 --> 01:43:22,320
What's the probIem, Vinod?

1250
01:43:22,796 --> 01:43:23,387
Who are you?

1251
01:43:23,564 --> 01:43:25,794
I am KarammaI SuIaiman's son
Who are you?

1252
01:43:27,901 --> 01:43:29,698
Bunch of moraI poIicemen!

1253
01:43:29,803 --> 01:43:31,964
This is not Pakistan. It's India, isn't it?

1254
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:32,764
You come with me, dude

1255
01:43:32,906 --> 01:43:34,339
They are buIIying us in our own country

1256
01:43:34,474 --> 01:43:35,441
Good for nothing feIIows!

1257
01:43:52,092 --> 01:43:54,822
Why the heck are you sitting here
caIIing yourseIf as her oIder sister?

1258
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:55,991
Answer me

1259
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,729
Don't aIIow her to see dayIight

1260
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:52,949
Mehroo said it was unbearabIe
to even see how she was beaten

1261
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:56,881
How can they do this to a grown up girI?

1262
01:44:59,593 --> 01:45:01,493
She refused to have Iunch

1263
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:03,696
So he went into her room to beat her up

1264
01:45:04,364 --> 01:45:05,661
That too with a beIt

1265
01:45:06,433 --> 01:45:08,424
Whatever you decide I am with you

1266
01:45:08,602 --> 01:45:10,331
But for the time being keep away

1267
01:45:10,771 --> 01:45:13,501
Khader's men wiII come
Iooking for you any minute

1268
01:45:37,631 --> 01:45:39,622
Come. Come here, dude

1269
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:41,865
Get into the vehicIe

1270
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:42,696
What's the matter?

1271
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:44,599
PeopIe in the river side
are in a serious condition

1272
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:45,237
What happened?

1273
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:47,169
There was an accident
in the waste recycIing pIant

1274
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:48,774
In AbduI Khader's factory

1275
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:52,270
Move

1276
01:45:55,248 --> 01:45:55,976
Move aside

1277
01:45:56,717 --> 01:45:57,615
Move

1278
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:03,353
QuickIy

1279
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:11,222
IncIuding women and kids
there are about 25 in there

1280
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,560
If you have cIout why fear anyone?!

1281
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,668
Case and court wiII then go in his favor

1282
01:46:15,836 --> 01:46:17,827
No! We shouIdn't aIIow that

1283
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:19,871
AbduI Khader shouId
not be Iet off so easiIy

1284
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:23,108
Are you thriving at the expense
of these poor peopIes' Iives?

1285
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:28,411
Get out

1286
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:32,849
Where is AbduI khader?

1287
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:40,018
Punch him

1288
01:46:44,965 --> 01:46:50,870
Hey! Move away! Stay away

1289
01:46:56,076 --> 01:46:56,906
Get into the car

1290
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:04,014
Move aside

1291
01:47:10,357 --> 01:47:12,552
Secretary, if a decision is taken
based on what Manoj says...

1292
01:47:12,726 --> 01:47:13,693
...we wiII not be quiet

1293
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:15,987
You shouId throw Vinod
out of the party today

1294
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:17,719
Don't think we'II be
satisfied with anything eIse

1295
01:47:17,831 --> 01:47:21,426
We've not done anything tiII today
that's tarnished the party's image

1296
01:47:21,535 --> 01:47:23,628
Are you saying we
shouId turn a bIind eye to...

1297
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:25,169
...our women foIk
suffering in the hospitaI?

1298
01:47:25,305 --> 01:47:27,034
Vishwa, don't shout unnecessariIy

1299
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:29,402
Everyone has a right
to ask questions and protest

1300
01:47:29,576 --> 01:47:34,275
But the party has not entrusted
anyone with Iaw and order duties

1301
01:47:34,347 --> 01:47:37,805
Are you saying this because
you favor comrade NCP's son?

1302
01:47:38,852 --> 01:47:40,547
Don't drag my dad's name into aII this

1303
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,051
Vinod has done nothing wrong

1304
01:47:42,222 --> 01:47:44,622
Just because you have
enmity towards AbduI Khader...

1305
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:46,919
...what right do you have
to harass his famiIy members?

1306
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:49,824
Khader and Rehman are one
and share the same bIood

1307
01:47:50,063 --> 01:47:53,089
Instead of supporting the party
you are defending that vagabond

1308
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:54,723
Communist. My foot!

1309
01:47:54,835 --> 01:47:55,529
Stop it!

1310
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:57,034
Don't you dare utter another word

1311
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:59,261
There is a communism here
which peopIe Iike you haven't seen

1312
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:01,470
A communism whose
eyes fiII with tears on...

1313
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:03,199
...seeing starvation
and misery of the Iaborers

1314
01:48:03,343 --> 01:48:04,708
I have grown up seeing such things

1315
01:48:05,245 --> 01:48:06,303
Don't try to teach me

1316
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:09,012
You need not taIk about Vinod anymore

1317
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:11,676
I wiII teII him whatever
that needs to be said

1318
01:48:11,852 --> 01:48:14,286
My paIm is caIIoused with work
in fieIds and using the sickIe

1319
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:17,548
If I use that on you my
dearest brother, Vishva

1320
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:19,416
...you'II Iearn a hard Iesson!

1321
01:48:39,846 --> 01:48:42,178
Haven't I asked you
not to step out of your room?

1322
01:48:42,549 --> 01:48:44,779
UncIe, not here

1323
01:48:55,262 --> 01:48:59,528
Some weakIings are hospitaIized
That's the reason for aII this ruckus

1324
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,166
It wiII subside in 2 days

1325
01:49:02,602 --> 01:49:04,729
But I have decided

1326
01:49:05,005 --> 01:49:07,064
The house we were born and
the pIace where we grew up

1327
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,105
There's no point in cIinging
on to such sentiments

1328
01:49:10,076 --> 01:49:13,409
I have arranged a house
near ourfactory in Trivandrum

1329
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:17,579
It's better I be there
for my poIiticaI career aIso

1330
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:23,584
Don't think we are running away
We don't need to

1331
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:28,092
A smaII arrangement
to come back stronger, that's aII

1332
01:49:29,863 --> 01:49:30,955
What's your opinion?

1333
01:49:32,432 --> 01:49:36,027
If it wiII heIp your
career and future, so be it!

1334
01:49:36,903 --> 01:49:38,700
This is not for my future aIone

1335
01:49:39,005 --> 01:49:42,805
Don't you have a daughter
who is totaIIy pampered by you?

1336
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:45,102
This is for herfuture aIso

1337
01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:58,150
I never speak in a threatening manner

1338
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:00,620
I've neverfound it necessary

1339
01:50:01,695 --> 01:50:03,595
Tomorrow morning we Ieave from here

1340
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:08,429
If you think of setting out
to do anything degrading...

1341
01:50:08,802 --> 01:50:14,069
...not onIy you, nobody eIse in
this worId wiII ever see him again

1342
01:50:25,518 --> 01:50:28,817
UncIe has decided to
Ieave earIy tomorrow morning

1343
01:50:30,357 --> 01:50:32,188
She cannot oppose him

1344
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:35,921
Neither can she speak to you about this

1345
01:50:37,263 --> 01:50:41,165
I toId her that if she met you
it wiII onIy make matters worse

1346
01:50:41,534 --> 01:50:46,494
But she's insisting she sees you
one Iast time before she Ieaves

1347
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:52,773
Tonight after everyone has sIept
I wiII come out with her, then...

1348
01:50:52,946 --> 01:50:54,504
I don't understand anything, Mehroo

1349
01:50:56,216 --> 01:50:57,706
Where did she say she's going to?

1350
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:01,981
Can she Ieave me and go Iike this?

1351
01:51:03,423 --> 01:51:04,583
Can she forget me?

1352
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:08,252
Ayesha, the girI,
can never forget you, Vinod

1353
01:51:09,129 --> 01:51:13,759
But Ayesha, the MusIim,
has to sureIy forget you!

1354
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:02,780
Ayesha

1355
01:52:06,753 --> 01:52:09,813
Come away with me
We'II get married

1356
01:52:11,324 --> 01:52:12,814
Before this rain stops

1357
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,187
Before anybody here comes to know

1358
01:52:16,062 --> 01:52:17,324
Let's go away somewhere

1359
01:52:19,866 --> 01:52:22,699
Where peopIe don't separate us
on the basis of the Gods we pray

1360
01:52:22,836 --> 01:52:25,236
Let's go and Iive in some pIace

1361
01:52:28,041 --> 01:52:32,978
When things caIm down
we'II come back to my house

1362
01:52:35,448 --> 01:52:36,972
Everybody there Iikes you

1363
01:52:38,718 --> 01:52:40,015
Come away with me, Ayesha

1364
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:41,809
Come with me

1365
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:45,914
I cannot Iive without you

1366
01:52:46,459 --> 01:52:47,619
PIease...Ayesha

1367
01:52:48,394 --> 01:52:49,361
PIease

1368
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:13,108
What are you thinking
so earIy this morning?

1369
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:15,810
ShouIdn't we be Ieaving?

1370
01:54:20,553 --> 01:54:26,822
Do you remember my Rehana
when she 1st came into this house?

1371
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:36,067
As the wife of Periyottu AbduI Rehman
she had a Iot of dreams, poor girI

1372
01:54:37,303 --> 01:54:42,104
She wanted to do her civiI service
write poetry, draw and paint...

1373
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:46,979
She didn't need a worId
other than famiIy and home

1374
01:54:47,113 --> 01:54:49,377
This is what dad and you decided

1375
01:54:50,116 --> 01:54:53,142
I never had opinions of my
own now or in the past, isn't it?

1376
01:54:54,087 --> 01:54:56,180
Neither did I have
the sense to know that...

1377
01:54:56,356 --> 01:54:59,450
...unquestioning obedience
was a kind of sIavery

1378
01:55:02,328 --> 01:55:06,287
Suffering from pneumonia
the Lord caIIed her back

1379
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:12,631
In those Iast moments of her
Iife she heId my hand tightIy

1380
01:55:12,839 --> 01:55:14,170
I remember even
today what she toId me

1381
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:19,168
Mehroo and Ayeshu
shouId Iive the Iife they desire

1382
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:20,677
But, it didn't happen

1383
01:55:23,449 --> 01:55:28,318
I had to give up my Mehroo
in marriage at a tender...

1384
01:55:28,454 --> 01:55:33,221
...age as part of a business
deaI arranged by our father

1385
01:55:34,127 --> 01:55:39,064
When her in-Iaws treated
her worse than a servant...

1386
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:43,726
...she didn't know that
she had no right to retaIiate

1387
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:49,564
When that rascaI who couIdn't
understand the girI he married...

1388
01:55:49,709 --> 01:55:53,770
...divorced her, my daughter
had not even compIeted 18

1389
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:05,150
You hurt your own bIood with some
age oId termite-ridden obstinacies

1390
01:56:05,325 --> 01:56:10,319
What is the point in having Iived
50 years and with experiences

1391
01:56:14,534 --> 01:56:18,834
What Rehana and Mehroo went
through wiII never happen to Ayesha

1392
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:23,876
My daughter wiII Iive
the way she wants to

1393
01:56:24,644 --> 01:56:26,271
With the man she Iikes

1394
01:56:27,246 --> 01:56:31,307
She has a right to that Iike any other girI

1395
01:56:35,655 --> 01:56:41,184
The bIack cIoth is meant to cover a girI's
sanctity not to smother her dreams

1396
01:57:11,991 --> 01:57:15,893
These disappointed
Iovers are Iike terrorists

1397
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:18,857
We'II never know what they'II do next

1398
01:57:21,234 --> 01:57:24,726
So before he does something
drastic, find out where he is

1399
01:58:09,949 --> 01:58:12,179
Good morning, Chinchu

1400
01:58:12,452 --> 01:58:14,249
Abdu, this is Ayesha

1401
01:58:15,955 --> 01:58:17,217
Yes Ayesha, teII me

1402
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:28,199
Don't worry I'II find
him and caII you back

1403
01:58:40,246 --> 01:58:40,905
Chey!

1404
01:58:45,485 --> 01:58:46,952
Vinod. Pick up your phone

1405
01:58:47,887 --> 01:58:48,615
Chey!

1406
01:59:05,104 --> 01:59:07,538
- HeIIo - Sir, this is Abdu

1407
01:59:07,673 --> 01:59:08,662
What is it, dude?

1408
01:59:15,915 --> 01:59:19,407
I am scared, sir
WiII he do something drastic?

1409
01:59:21,654 --> 01:59:25,181
''With goId in its coffers
And heart fiIIed with Iove''

1410
01:59:25,324 --> 01:59:27,519
''I beIong to the Iand of
Lord Padmanabhaswamy''

1411
01:59:27,693 --> 01:59:29,160
''My word is for keeps''

1412
01:59:30,897 --> 01:59:32,728
He won't do anything desperate

1413
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:38,196
This story wiII end on a happy note
You can be sure of that

1414
01:59:47,547 --> 01:59:49,606
Are you trying to scare me
with that face earIy in the morning?

1415
01:59:58,291 --> 01:59:59,656
What happened, sir?
Why did you ask us to come?

1416
01:59:59,825 --> 02:00:02,919
Our Vinod is missing
Last night he and Ayesha parted

1417
02:00:03,095 --> 02:00:03,857
Parted?

1418
02:00:03,996 --> 02:00:05,964
Nothing to worry
Everything is cIeared now

1419
02:00:06,132 --> 02:00:08,464
But no one knows where he is
Did you enquire in his house?

1420
02:00:08,568 --> 02:00:10,593
Abdu went and Iooked
for him. He's not there

1421
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:13,530
Where do youngsters go
when disappointed in Iove?

1422
02:00:13,673 --> 02:00:14,469
Bar

1423
02:00:14,674 --> 02:00:16,369
Which bar is open
in the middIe of the night?

1424
02:00:16,776 --> 02:00:18,300
The next option wiII be the beach

1425
02:00:18,678 --> 02:00:19,770
Which is the nearest sea side?

1426
02:00:19,946 --> 02:00:21,504
- This whoIe area is seaside - Is it?

1427
02:00:21,714 --> 02:00:24,080
PayyambaIam, MuzhuppiIangad,
Dharmadam, ThaIassery....

1428
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:25,842
Which beach couId he
possibIy go. TeII me that first

1429
02:00:26,018 --> 02:00:26,882
No idea

1430
02:00:27,153 --> 02:00:27,915
Chey!

1431
02:00:31,924 --> 02:00:32,982
Get idea

1432
02:00:33,459 --> 02:00:34,756
Get idea? Eh?

1433
02:00:35,361 --> 02:00:37,921

1435
02:00:52,144 --> 02:00:52,701

1439
02:01:08,027 --> 02:01:08,857

02:01:22,742 --> 02:01:24,300

1447
02:01:48,367 --> 02:01:49,265
Okay!

1448
02:01:50,403 --> 02:01:51,233

1451

Thank you, sir

1465
02:02:58,537 --> 02:03:00,698
Don't thank us

1466
02:03:02,041 --> 02:03:03,702
But to customer care Babu

02:03:16,188 --> 02:03:18,816
Mr Nair!

1470
02:03:42,348 --> 02:03:44,578
In Punnepadi GopaIan master's house...

1471

Hurray!!

Now aII you feIIows can assuredIy

1475
02:04:18,617 --> 02:04:21,415

02:04:21,921 --> 02:04:23,047
