<i>A girl's got to live, ain't she?</i>

156
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:51,439
<i>(WOMAN) Hello, sugar.</i>
<i>(MAN) Hello, yourself...sugar.</i>

157
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:54,075
- <i>Would you like...?</i>
- <i>Champagne, toots.</i>

158
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:56,715
<i>Oh, yes. Of course...</i>

159
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,718
<i>Of course...</i>

160
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:03,718
<i>Of course...</i>

161
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,964
(MOANS)

162
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,686
Oh, God!

163
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:30,000
Cigarette. I want a cigarette.

164
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:35,406
Cigarette, sugar? Toots?

165
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,445
Faggy-waggy, nursey.

166
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,397
Ali. Ali!

167
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:48,083
- What do you want?
- Get my cigarettes for me, will you?

168
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,397
- Please.
- What?

169
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,843
Say ''please'', not ''what'',
thank you very much.

170
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,646
Oh, for Christ's sake!

171
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,765
- No cigarettes.
- All right, then - please.

172
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:03,203
Please...you bastard.

173
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:09,164
Doctor say if something wrong here
and you bloody smoking cigarettes,

174
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:12,080
there's something wrong here as well.

175
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:16,718
- No cigarette.
- That's you heart patients, nig-nog!

176
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:20,237
I'm skin, Ali. Skin.
How many more times?

177
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:24,281
I must stay in bed.

178
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:28,486
Doctor say, ''Stay in bed, nig-nog!''

179
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:30,638
(LAUGHS)

180
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:36,079
He said that? The doctor said that?

181
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:41,957
Ah, I've seen you padding about
half the night, you sly old sod.

182
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:47,002
- Talking to Allah or somebody.
- Oh, no. Bloody God, no.

183
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:51,445
Look, Ali, don't be a hypocrite.
I'm dying for a cigarette.

184
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:54,075
Love your little brown chops.

185
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:57,922
OK, OK. Bloody dog, me.

186
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:06,436
They keep putting them on my locker.
''Tidying my trolley.''

187
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,598
All morons with a mania for order

188
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:11,884
put everything you want
where you can't get it.

189
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:16,723
Do you know how many ''O'' levels
you have to fail to be a nurse?

190
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,447
Blessings on your head, old son.

191
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:23,441
No bloody flame.

192
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:27,156
Conviction. Do it with conviction!

193
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,638
Oh, my God.

194
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:33,561
(LAUGHS) Turn it down!
The wheel! The little wheel, Ali.

195
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,886
Good.

196
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:39,039
I could see the headlines -
''Another Asian Burnt to Death.''

197
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:45,285
No. That wouldn't
make the headlines any more.

198
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:49,520
Not now the National Front
are investing in tandoori ovens.

199
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:58,684
- Good?
- Good? It's bloody marvellous!

200
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:01,998
All my hopes and desires
and fondest aspirations

201
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:06,046
have finally been reduced
to their true dimensions, my old son.

202
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,641
Yes. Your lungs.

203
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:11,446
Look at that blue smoke, Ali.

204
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,075
See the way it coils and drifts...

205
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,527
just like every human hope.

206
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:21,042
Yes, yes. Very bloody wise.

207
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:26,082
I used to think that all I wanted was
the good opinion of honourable men

208
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:29,637
and the ungrudging love
of beautiful women.

209
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:33,117
Now I know that all I really want
is a cigarette.

210
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:37,519
- Just one more cigarette, Ali.
- Poison. It's poison.

211
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:40,997
One thing about this place,
it strips away the unimportant stuff,

212
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:45,604
like skin, like love, like loyalty,
like passion and belief...

213
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,758
Oh!

214
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,235
Oi! I know I'm boring,
but surely not that much!

215
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:03,164
Were you out of bed? Excuse me.
I said, were you out of bed?

216
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:07,115
- No, Doctor Finlay, sir. No.
- Yes, you jolly well were!

217
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:10,723
- What is the point of my...?
- It's my fault.

218
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,600
- Oh?
- I asked him to get me a cigarette.

219
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:19,359
You shouldn't. And he shouldn't.
You're taking advantage of him.

220
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:24,476
- In any case, you shouldn't smoke.
- You're not MY doctor. Thank God.

221
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:29,798
Whether I am or not, don't encourage
this man to get out of bed.

222
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,958
- You're being selfish.
- Listen...

223
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:35,358
- You're putting his health at risk.
- Look here...

224
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:40,243
- If he dies, you'll be responsible.
- It'll be one less, then, won't it?

225
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,120
- What are you talking about?
- Immigrants, sunshine.

226
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:53,083
- Are you having trouble with him?
- Yes, sir. I am, Doctor. Please.

227
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:56,045
Has he been making offensive remarks
about your origins?

228
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:59,796
- Sorry. Origins, please?
- Your, er...race or...?

229
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,439
- Sorry. Race, please?
- Yes. Your race.

230
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:06,679
Go on. Tell him, you brown bugger!

231
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:08,559
(BOTH LAUGH)

232
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:11,238
(PAGER BEEPS)

233
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:22,360
Jumped up little snot. Go on.
You get out of bed, Ali, old pal.

234
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:25,724
- No, no.
- Well, why not? What's the point?

235
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:28,799
Why endure one moment more
than you have to?

236
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,845
Go on, get of bed. Jump up and down.

237
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:36,239
Then hold a pillow over my face,
and we'll go together. Come on.

238
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:48,400
At first, comma,

239
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:54,722
the only sound is the slap hyphen
slap of the water

240
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,878
against the boat, comma,

241
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:01,245
which has its engine switched off.
Double space.

242
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:06,435
The other, comma, natural noises
increase

243
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:11,635
as the naked, drowned body
of a beautiful woman is slowly pulled...

244
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,525
What are you talking about,
Mr Marlow?

245
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:21,320
I had on my best pyjamas,
the ones with blue forget-me-nots.

246
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:25,799
I was all dressed up.
A million dollars was about to call.

247
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:29,277
- I was ready for it.
- High temperature again, have we?

248
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:31,438
When she moved her lips like that,

249
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:36,044
I felt like a tulip when
the first raindrop smacked into it.

250
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:41,804
I decided to open up.
Boy, was I green...or do I mean wet?

251
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,357
- Oh, I see.
- Your eyes are not for seeing,

252
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:47,518
they're for being looked at.

253
00:21:47,687 --> 00:21:51,680
We're in a good mood.
We're actually talking today.

254
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:53,963
What do you mean?

255
00:21:54,127 --> 00:22:00,236
According to the report, you didn't say
one word yesterday. Not for the first time.

256
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:02,244
- Me?
- Yes, you.

257
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,120
They put that sort of thing
on report?

258
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,683
Oh, yes. Everything.

259
00:22:08,847 --> 00:22:11,315
- Is that why they...?
- Go on, ask.

260
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:14,923
Is that why they think
I'm a bit touched? Loopy?

261
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,199
- No!
- What, then?

262
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,200
- Depressed.
- Tranquillisers.

263
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,403
No, worse - those antidepressants.

264
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:27,719
Brain-drainers. Is that why
they try to make me swallow them?

265
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:31,084
- If they help people...
- I'm not taking them!

266
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:35,160
I've got thinking to do. If I don't
think, I'll never get out. I'll...

267
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:40,523
- Are you going to grease me?
- If you're ready.

268
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:44,081
Ready as a back-axle.

269
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:49,080
- Nurse? Nurse?
- What is it, Mr Hall?

270
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:51,847
Could you spare a moment,
Nurse, here?

271
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:55,323
- No. Tell me.
- Nurse, please.

272
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,637
(WHISPERS)
Could you come here, please?

273
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:05,246
You're going to wear us out,
aren't you?

274
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:07,398
Now, what is it?

275
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:14,882
Beg pardon, my dear. I need
the, er...you know...very badly.

276
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:19,723
- The...contraption. You know.
- Contraption? What contraption?

277
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:21,878
Tuppence. I want to spend tuppence.

278
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:26,285
Reginald, would you get a bedpan
for Mr Hall and close his curtains?

279
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:31,006
Got the shits again, Pop?

280
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:45,081
Bit like being in a tent in here,
isn't it, with the curtains shut?

281
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:47,920
Yeah. And the desert all around.

282
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:54,323
- Shall I do the top or bottom first?
- I don't mind.

283
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:57,564
- Still can't get your pyjamas off?
- No.

284
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:01,197
All right.
I'll start down below first.

285
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:08,005
Right, let's get these trousers off.

286
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:19,476
I'll try not to hurt. Up you come.

287
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:22,838
(GRUNTS)

288
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:34,917
- Thanks.
- All right.

289
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:39,886
Relax. We can start now.

290
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:55,362
<i>(THINKS) Oh, cock, do not crow.</i>

291
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,121
<i>Poor cock, do not stir.</i>

292
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,318
I'll be as gentle as I can.

293

<i>Think of something boring,</i>
<i>for Christ's sake.</i>

<i>Think of something very, very boring.</i>

295

<i>A speech... A speech by Ted Heath.</i>

296

<i>A sentence, a long sentence,</i>

297
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,718
<i>A quiz by Christopher Booker. Oh!</i>

298
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,799
<i>No, no.</i>
<i>Think. Think. Think. Really boring.</i>

- Vomiting.

- Finally withdrawn.
- Ten years of occlusive dressings,

437

corticosteroid ointments each night.

438

- Also cytotoxic.

None around.
It is half past three in the morning.

There'll be one. There's always

- No. Of course not.
- Or do you labour under the delusion

00:54:52,127 --> 00:54:56,040
that it consists solely and entirely

Mr Marlow, do you think you have
the right attitude towards your illness?

682
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:49,520
Do you? I mean, that's the really
interesting question. Your attitude.

683
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:51,962
Partly, yes.
But you should also consider...

684
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:56,006
- Will I ever be free of it?
- Well, that's something...

685
00:55:56,207 --> 00:55:58,801
Will I ever be able to move properly?

686
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:03,398
Will I ever be able
to hold a pen again? Tell me that.

687
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:07,924
Come on. Never mind the blather.
I can get that from a doctor, Doctor.

688
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:13,006
You ask as though someone else
was responsible for your condition,

689
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:18,878
but no one is, or at least,
in the unlikely event that anyone is,

690
00:56:19,047 --> 00:56:22,960
then that someone cannot be
anyone other than yourself, can it?

691
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:28,366
Oh, what are you talking about?
It's not your job to be cryptic.

692
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:32,082
I have occasionally seen patients
who are just as bad,

693
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:34,238
sometimes worse than you are,

694
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:40,243
but it's fair to say that none of them
reacts with such aggression...

695
00:56:40,407 --> 00:56:44,844
- What do they do? Sing madrigals?
- They don't rail against the world

696
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:47,965
or behave like they've fallen
into a sewer.

697
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,881
Are you trying to say
I should take the tranquillizers?

698
00:56:52,047 --> 00:56:55,835
Or is it a deodorant
you've got in mind?

699
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,357
I think you should take
the tranquillizers for a while.

700
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:04,162
- No! I won't!
- That's up to you.

701
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:07,524
No one's going to ram them
down your throat.

702
00:57:08,447 --> 00:57:12,486
But where are you going
to find any equanimity?

703
00:57:12,647 --> 00:57:14,638
What?

704
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:19,403
It's an embarrassing question,
even between husbands and wives,

705
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:23,196
but what do you believe in?

706
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:25,835
- Malthusianism.
- Come again?

707
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:28,242
Malthus, but mandatorily.

708
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:32,241
Compulsory depopulation
by infanticide, suicide, genocide

709
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,398
or whatever other means
suggest themselves.

710
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:38,082
AIDS. That'll do.
Why should queers be so special?

711
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,715
- I see.
- I also believe in cigarettes,

712
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:43,003
cholesterol, alcohol,

713
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:47,001
carbon monoxide,
masturbation, the Arts Council,

714
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:49,761
nuclear weapons, the Daily Telegraph

715
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,162
and not properly labelling
fatal poisons,

716
00:57:52,327 --> 00:57:55,763
but above all else,
I believe in the one thing

717
00:57:55,927 --> 00:57:59,920
that can come out
of people's mouths - vomit.

(SIGHS)

719
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:08,524
I want you to think carefully
about what I'm going to say.

720
00:58:08,687 --> 00:58:11,804
There's a very good man
at the hospital.

721
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:17,121
Very alert and sympathetic.
I'd like you to talk to him.

722
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:20,723
What? Alert and what?
What are you talking about?

723
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:24,357
- Who is he? He'll get struck off.
- Dr Gibbon.

724
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:29,561
Doctor of what?
Skin? Joints? Monkeys?

725
00:58:29,727 --> 00:58:32,241
The decline and fall
of the Roman Empire?

726
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:35,763
What's he got to be alert
and sympathetic about?

727
00:58:35,927 --> 00:58:40,239
He's a...
Well, he's a psychotherapist.

728
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:44,486
- Very good man. You'd get on with him.
- Get stuffed!

729

Y-You are out of order.

- Christ Almighty. Where? Handsworth?

738
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:21,281
Didn't he say when?
When you go out, hey?

739
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:27,562
We're never getting out. This is
our home on the range, old pal.

740
00:59:27,727 --> 00:59:29,877
Well, the hotplate, anyway.

741
00:59:30,047 --> 00:59:34,325
Don't talk rubbish. We are.

742

We are. Any bloody time now.

743
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:43,160
Yeah, we will, one day.

744
00:59:43,327 --> 00:59:46,603
Arm-in-arm, together, eh?
Like Alcock and Brown.

745
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:52,437
You can be Brown.

746

We're never going to get out
of this bloody place.

- You're right. Never!
- Yes, we are, Ali.

Come on.
We'll break a popadom together.

749

Call the Samaritans, would you?

- How about sour?

- That's more my line.
- You want sweet?

No, thanks, Ali. My jaws hurt.
Thanks, Ali. Thanks all the same.

01:00:38,127 --> 01:00:40,118
Some other time, eh, sweetheart?

756

You have sweet.
I have a lot of sweets.

You have sweet, I have sweet,
and we say up the arse, eh?

758
01:00:50,687 --> 01:00:52,917
Yeah. Up the arse.

759
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:58,484
(WHEEZES)

760
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:05,164
Ali?

761
01:01:05,607 --> 01:01:07,404
Ali?

762
01:01:07,687 --> 01:01:09,484
Ali!

763
01:01:10,487 --> 01:01:12,284
Ali!

764
01:01:12,447 --> 01:01:14,244
Ali!

765
01:01:14,927 --> 01:01:17,202
God! Nurse!

766
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,925
Nurse!

767
01:01:20,087 --> 01:01:21,566
Nurse?

768
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:29,202
Ali? Ali? Call 199.

769
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:45,118
Hurry!

770
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:54,360
(SISTER) Plug that in.
Get that headboard off.

771
01:01:55,607 --> 01:01:57,996
I'll take over. Put his arms down.

772
01:02:04,807 --> 01:02:06,798
(DOCTOR) Thank you, Nurse.

773
01:02:11,287 --> 01:02:13,642
Please set up a drip.

774
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:24,637
(2nd DOCTOR) What's the rhythm?
Give me the paddles.

775
01:02:27,607 --> 01:02:29,723
(DOCTOR) Set it for 2O.

776
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,358
Stand clear, everyone.

777
01:02:36,807 --> 01:02:38,957
Give me 4O.

778
01:02:39,807 --> 01:02:41,843
Stand clear, everyone.

779
01:02:45,727 --> 01:02:48,287
(2nd DOCTOR) Set up a drip.
Give me the adrenalin.

780
01:03:14,287 --> 01:03:16,847
(DOCTOR) One last try.
Stand clear, everyone.

781
01:03:23,407 --> 01:03:26,797
(NURSE)
Fixed and dilated, I'm afraid.

782
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:33,319
OK. That's it.

783
01:03:33,487 --> 01:03:37,116
- Time, Staff?
- 14.37.

784
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:40,245
(DOCTOR)
Record that as time of death.

785
01:04:18,527 --> 01:04:22,679
- Oh, you are untidy!
- (MARLOW) Who is? What?

786
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:26,282
Dropping your sweeties
all over the place.

787
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:30,326
- Oh, they're not...
- Try and be more careful, shall we?

788
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:32,478
Yeah, I'm sorry.

789
01:04:34,207 --> 01:04:37,085
- Shall I unwrap one?
- I'd prefer a cigarette.

790
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:41,035
- I'm not giving you one of those...
- You shouldn't smoke.

791
01:04:41,207 --> 01:04:46,884
- I don't know why they allow it.
- Yes. They might make me ill.

792
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:55,195
- Have you been greased yet?
- No.

793
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:58,325
You should have been.
Why tell us now?

794
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:02,366
Did I say anything? Did I?
Jesus Christ on a bike.

795
01:05:02,527 --> 01:05:07,317
It's all right, Staff.
I'll do it before I go off.

796
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:11,162
It makes you a bit more comfortable,
doesn't it...eventually?

797
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:16,727
I'm... All right. I will
have a sweet now, Nurse, please.

798
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:26,998
What's the matter?

799
01:05:28,727 --> 01:05:30,126
Nothing.

800
01:05:31,687 --> 01:05:34,520
Do you want something for the pain?

801
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:38,680
(WHIMPERS) They're very nice,
these sweets, Nurse.

802
01:05:38,847 --> 01:05:42,396
Very nice indeed. (SOBS)

803
