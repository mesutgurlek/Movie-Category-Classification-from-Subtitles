00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:41,127
Raju! I'm here!

2
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:09,391
"Neither to the fair-skinned
nor to those dark..."

3
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:13,490
"the world belongs to the selfless"

4
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,322
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

5
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:22,062
"The world belongs to the selfless"

6
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:30,798
"Guys like us live
and die for a smile"

7
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:35,333
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

8
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:39,450
"The world belongs to the selfless"

9
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:08,959
"Our songs echo in every street"

10
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:13,468
" We deal in songs"

11
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:17,469
"Our songs echo in every street"

12
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:21,956
" We deal in songs"

13
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:26,008
" We love neither gold nor silver"

14
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:30,099
" We love songs"

15
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,805
" We love neither gold nor silver"

16
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:36,972
" We love songs"

17
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:41,327
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

18
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:45,350
"The world belongs to the selfless"

19
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,638
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

20
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:53,981
"The world belongs to the selfless"

21
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,158
" Life is very short
Live and be happy"

22
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,682
" Do all that you wish to"

23
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:42,727
" Life is very short
Live and be happy"

24
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:47,091
" Do all that you wish to"

25
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:55,410
" Forget about what
belongs to you or me"

26
00:06:55,874 --> 00:07:02,143
" Forget about what
belongs to you or me"

27
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:06,350
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

28
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:10,335
"The world belongs to the selfless"

29
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:18,461
"Guys like us live and
die only for a smile"

30
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,303
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

31
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,362
"The world belongs to the selfless"

32
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:31,645
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

33
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:36,191
"The world belongs to the selfless"

34
00:07:57,672 --> 00:07:59,230
- Here you are, mother.
- You' re back?

35
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:02,366
Why did you bring Raju's guitar?

36
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:03,485
His mother is unwell.

37
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:06,544
He gave me the guitar
and left for his village.

38
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:09,189
He asked me to tell you,
not to worry.

39
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,236
To write to him if
anything is needed.

40
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:14,083
But he didn't give his address.

41
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:16,810
Doesn't matter.
I have his address.

42
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,161
Your father belonged
to the same village.

43
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,156
Mom! What did he do?

44
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:24,471
Raju and your father sang together.

45
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:30,694
Anil, your father wanted
you to become a famous artist.

46
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:33,549
I will. I will definitely
fulfill my father's wish.

47
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,516
First wash up and eat dinner.

48
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,944
I'll wash up after dinner.
I am famished.

49
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,463
But how will I go to work alone?

50
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:44,040
I'll come with you.

51
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,608
Why don't you eat?

52
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:50,103
You know I'll eat
only when you feed me.

53
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:14,887
Come inside.

54
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:23,985
You sing very well.

55
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:28,473
My father told me to sing
from the heart not throat.

56
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:30,184
- Do you play this?
- Yes.

57
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,011
Play it.

58
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,065
- Will you sing?
- Yes.

59
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,578
I have memorized your song.

60
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:35,892
Let's begin.

61
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,179
Why do you laugh?

62
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,172
You can't play the guitar.

63
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:48,393
You don't learn just by
Buying it. Give it to me.

64
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,759
Let's play inside.

65
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:25,608
"Grandiose castles and
Inheritance means nothing"

66
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:29,918
"Those who have the wealth
of the heart are truly wealthy"

67
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,518
"Grandiose castles and
Inheritance means nothing"

68
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:38,728
"Those who have the wealth
Of the heart are truly wealthy"

69
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:47,394
" My friend, follow
The call of the heart"

70
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:52,092
" Neither the dark nor the fair.."

71
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:56,022
"The world belongs to the selfless"

72
00:10:56,313 --> 00:11:04,266
"Guys like me live
and die for a smile"

73
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,176
" Neither the dark nor the fair.."

74
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:13,361
"The world belongs to the selfless"

75
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,830
" Neither the dark nor the fair.."

76
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:22,357
"The world belongs to the selfless"

77
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:54,597
Hey! You Bastard!
What are you doing?

78
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:00,176
Get lost! Out!

79
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:21,340
Daddy, doesn't he sing well?

80
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:23,574
You shut up! Take her in!

81
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:28,887
Scoundrel, now I'll hear you sing.

82
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:31,677
Don't abuse me.
We came for your daughter..

83
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:33,882
Chit of a boy, arguing...!

84
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,484
Leave me, mother.

85
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:03,802
Sir, what happened?

86
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,637
Beat this rascal so hard
That he never comes here!

87
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:08,318
Please leave him!

88
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:12,138
Please save my son!

89
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:13,721
They will kill him!

90
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:17,430
Please spare him!

91
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,264
You're just in time.

92
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,191
This boy stole my guitar.

93
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,054
He is lying!

94
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,633
My son is not a thief!

95
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:35,259
Inspector, my life is miserable
because of these lousy people.

96
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:36,438
Take him away.

97
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:39,633
I'll send somebody
to write the FIR.

98
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:41,923
I stole the guitar.

99
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,721
He's a poor child.
It caught his fancy.

100
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:47,674
I couldn't bear it.

101
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:49,073
Arrest me.

102
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,647
Take the guitar away.

103
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:56,855
Go home, child.

104
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:02,079
I won't let them take my mother!

105
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:04,440
inspector, this is a lie!

106
00:14:04,474 --> 00:14:07,272
Neither my mother
nor I am a thief!

107
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:12,857
I made this bread for you.

108
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:19,493
Mother...

109
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,358
Here, eat.

110
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:29,956
Don't worry.

111
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:31,593
I'm waiting outside the prison.

112
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:36,183
I've decided to grow up real fast.

113
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:39,146
I won't spare the man in the house.

114
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:52,669
Mother and son are thieves!

115
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:53,721
Look at the two thieves.

116
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,412
Why didn't you steal
something precious?

117
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:11,496
Shut up! My mother isn't a thief!

118
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,811
Then why was she in jail?

119
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:33,560
Leave this place and go away!

120
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,966
I'll chop off every wagging tongue!

121
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:58,385
No, my son.

122
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,785
It won't help.

123
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,322
One can hold a raised hand.

124
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:04,063
But not a wagging tongue.

125
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:04,965
But mother...

126
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:07,966
Mother, you didn't commit theft.

127
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:14,453
You know it. That's all.

128
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,567
Let them speak.

129
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,015
We' ll leave this city.

130
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:46,135
" My friend has come from Bombay"

131
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:47,987
"Greet my friend"

132
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:52,022
" Eat and drink at night,
catch up with sleep in the day"

133
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,043
" My friend has come from Bombay"

134
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,713
"Greet my friend"

135
00:16:56,867 --> 00:17:01,270
" Eat and drink at night,
Catch up with sleep in the day"

136
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:18,798
" Dance and make merry
for it is a holiday"

137
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:24,246
" Dance and make merry
for it is a holiday"

138
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:29,879
" Dance and make merry
for it is a holiday"

139
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:36,316
" Dance and make merry
for it is a holiday"

140
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:38,900
" My friend has come from Bombay"

141
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:41,504
"Greet my friend"

142
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:43,824
Very hard.

143
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:47,121
Young man, you are very lucky.

144
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,057
This is my first marriage
since I was born.

145
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:52,912
Congratulations.

146
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:56,150
Hundred rupees!

147
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:08,985
Here...

148
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,872
Don't feel disheartened.

149
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:23,445
The day I make it big,
you' ll be rolling in wealth.

150
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:29,709
You've grown so big but
Want mother to feed you.

151
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:31,010
Have you no shame?

152
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:34,976
The food is tastier
When you feed me.

153
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,096
The day I make it big...

154
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:43,023
That heartless city
of ours will honor me.

155
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,811
I'll still ask you to feed me.

156
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:51,312
That day I'll remind
That heartless city....

157
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:53,752
..That I am the same child

158
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:58,474
...whose mother they humiliated.

159
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:01,729
Why don't you forget this?

160
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,486
How can I forget? Never.

161
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:11,416
That day is like a
fresh wound on my soul.

162
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:14,998
When that man abused you...

163
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:21,806
The roads, trees, the breeze...
Nobody said a word.

164
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:23,537
Not one word.

165
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:26,604
That city will have to honor you.

166
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:29,791
I have my music.

167
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:35,146
I will sharpen it like a sword.

168
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,312
And stab the city's heart with it.

169
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:46,222
Hi! Dad

170
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,842
Hi.Son!
- I'm leaving.

171
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:49,973
When will you return?

172
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:53,413
Can't say. I'm going to Pune.

173
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:57,055
Then to Goa. if I feel like it,
I might stay back after the show.

174
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:58,999
Okay! All the best!

175
00:20:18,598 --> 00:20:20,828
"Somebody dances here"

176
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:24,277

" Don't hurt me or
Hide anything from me"

196
00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:44,893
" No false excuses"

197
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:51,509
"Joys abound here
Plunder it all"

"The flame dances"

199
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,169
"The smoke dances"

200
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:02,475

" I love you!

221
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,695
Who are these bastards?

222
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:03,793
Sam! I am David Brown.
Your Manager.

223
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:08,556
You should know you must knock
Before entering anyone's room.

224
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:13,243
You should know the difference
Between the green room and bedroom.

225
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:16,106
I'm not in the mood
to listen to your speech.

226
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,877
Deliver your lecture and let me rest.

227
00:26:21,192 --> 00:26:23,631
Get ready when you finish.

228
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,606
You have a show in Chandigarh.

229
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:27,078
You go to Chandigar

230
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:32,465
Learn how to talk to your boss.

231
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:35,530
if Chandigarh wants
Sam's music...

232
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:39,108
Let them come to him.

233
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:45,147
The audience that will wait for you
Tomorrow is more precious than her!

234
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:50,257
You will have to come.

235
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:56,350
What will you do if
I say I'm not in the mood?

236
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:00,884
Then I will assume
your bad days..

237
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:01,718
Shut up!

238
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:09,314
Sam can never have bad days.

239
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:19,952
Sam is the heartbeat
of minions of girls.

240
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:27,610
Then find yourself another manager.

241
00:27:28,086 --> 00:27:28,856
Listen..!

242
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,469
Sam can find managers
like you a dime a dozen.

243
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:38,828
But a star like Sam is
born once in a few centuries.

244
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,097
And dies in a day or two.

245
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:48,878
Yes, Dad.

246
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,319
Come here.
I want to talk to you.

247
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:53,675
Mr. Rahul! Mr. Rahul!

248
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,645
You've made a big mistake
by leaving superstar Sam.

249
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,845
Think about my show.
I will be ruined!

250
00:27:58,877 --> 00:27:59,866
Don't worry.

251
00:28:00,365 --> 00:28:02,408
Dad, you called?

252
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:04,267
I've left Sam.

253
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:07,665
- That's a daily story.
- No, the truth of the day.

254
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:11,210
That tinned man!
Hopes of a disco dancer!

255
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,876
He wants me to be
Secretary to a superstar!

256
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:17,436
After leaving me only
will he find out what I am!

257
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:22,656
I will create a new superstar
on the sky of the disco!

258
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:25,423
Sam will drown in his light!

259
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:12,300
I've already told you,
you are just first grade!

260
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,738
But...

261
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:16,299
You' re probably thinking
Sammy's manager is crazy.

262
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:19,200
By the way, I'm no longer
Sammy's Manager.

263
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:20,335
My mother...

264
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,470
Good day.

265
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,553
Your son's Manager.

266
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:27,603
Please be seated.

267
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:28,808
Yes, mother.

268
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:31,800
This is Ghuiam Nabi. He wants
to do a program with Anil.

269
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,964
He is a trifle worried.

270
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:37,928
But I assured him I'll
cover up the losses in the show.

271
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,118
This should prove to you how
much I trust you and your talent.

272
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,199
Will Nicky come?

273
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:00,485
Of course, she's my daughter!

274
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:09,444
Why aren't you here?

275
00:32:09,517 --> 00:32:11,706
Sorry Dad, I can't come.

276
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:13,588
You must come. My honor is at
stake.

277
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:17,873
Sam...
-To hell with Sam!

278
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:24,849
What's wrong?

279
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,823
Sam cut the line.

280
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:31,415
Now what..?

281
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:35,586
Don't worry.
The show will go on!

282
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:41,519
What are you thinking?

283
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:44,819
Wondering about the show.

284
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:46,604
Shall I tell you?

285
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:50,723
My sister, Rita and her friends....

286
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:55,132
must be getting ready to throw
their shoes at this new artist.

287
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:13,226
I, David Brown am
excited by the thought..

288
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:21,388
...I am instrumental in
bringing a great artist to you!

289
00:33:32,115 --> 00:33:44,332
- We won't listen...
-..to the Street Smart!

290
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,762
Throw me the other foot.
it will make a pair.

291
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,847
Boo!!

292
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:16,092
We don't want him!

293
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,514
"Turn around.."

294
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:14,093
"...and meet my eyes"

295
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:17,323
"I've come for you"

296
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:19,521
" Turn around and

297
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:21,414
look into my eyes"

298
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:24,398
"I've come for you"

299
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:29,155
" I have come for you, only you"

300
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:23,678
"This opportunity has come
for the first time in life"

301
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,504
" Honey, I am falling for you"

302
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:35,648
"This opportunity has come
for the first time in life"

303
00:36:36,523 --> 00:36:40,884
" Honey, I am falling for you"

304
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:48,180
" Don't break my heart
once it is yours"

305
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:05,256
"Turn around and look into my eyes"

306
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,766
" I have come for you"

307
00:37:09,457 --> 00:37:12,449
"Turn around and look into my eyes"

308
00:37:13,001 --> 00:37:16,994
" I have come for you"

309
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:08,348
"The decision of my
heart has to be taken"

310
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:14,922
"Only in death will we be apart"

311
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,129
"The decision of my
heart has to be taken"

312
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:25,015
"Only in death will we be apart"

313
00:38:25,248 --> 00:38:32,313
" I'll follow you everywhere"

314
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:49,869
"Turn around and look into my eyes"

315
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:53,192
" I have come for you"

316
00:38:53,522 --> 00:38:56,753
"Turn around and look into my eyes"

317
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,051
" I have come for you, only for you"

318
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,227
What do you want?

319
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:59,004
I can see you are pretty.

320
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:04,474
But there's more arrogance
and less delicacy in it.

321
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:06,705
You probably have a brain too.

322
00:41:07,642 --> 00:41:11,009
But the brain stinks of wealth.

323
00:41:11,632 --> 00:41:14,863
I am beautiful and proud of it.

324
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,904
My brain stinks of wealth
because my Dad is a millionaire.

325
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:23,274
What are you?
A roadside singer?

326
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:24,780
....and dancer.

327
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,819
Roadside singer and a dancer....

328
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,194
That's what you screamed last night.

329
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,548
Listen baby...whatever
your name be..

330
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:36,832
I've come to answer you.

331
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:42,603
A rich man like your father
condemned my art to the road.

332
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,958
I learnt music from
every footpath of Goa.

333
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,562
I learnt pitch from each road.

334
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:55,337
Last night you tried to
wash away my hopes and dreams.

335
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:59,224
But my mother's blessings
gave me success.

336
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,785
I swear by that same mother...

337
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:04,252
One day I will be so successful...

338
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:07,686
You will ask this roadside
singer for his autograph.

339
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:09,793
Not on a paper..

340
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:11,451
On your lips.

341
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:15,694
I'm not sure whether
I will give the autograph.

342
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:17,811
How dare....!

343
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:32,129
Yes, I got the cash.

344
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,719
Book 3 tickets to Bombay.

345
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:44,666
Let him get to Bombay.

346
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:46,957
Everything will carry his name.

347
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:50,674
Jimmy ice-cream, Jimmy
chocolate, Jimmy fabrics,

348
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,286
Jimmy T-shirts...Jimmy
this, Jimmy that..

349
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:55,219
What tea does he drink?

350
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:56,749
Which cream he uses?

351
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:58,606
What color does he like?

352
00:42:58,717 --> 00:42:59,877
What does he hate?

353
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:04,022
No, I won't let Anil go to Bombay

354
00:43:06,776 --> 00:43:07,708
No, mother.

355
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,114
We will go.

356
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:17,569
That city has to clear
old debts it owes me.

357
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:21,165
We will go to Bombay.

358
00:43:32,722 --> 00:43:36,089
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

359
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:40,188
"The world belongs to the selfless"

360
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:48,992
"Guys like us live
and die with a smile"

361
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:52,467
This is the house of
your enemy and mine.

362
00:43:55,031 --> 00:43:56,230
How do you know?

363
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:13,333
I hear music.

364
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,541
Practicing for the show?

365
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:20,768
Don't tire yourself.

366
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,020
I have bought your program.

367
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:29,879
And David Brown doesn't like
third grade man like yourself!

368
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:34,100
Jimmy will dance in your place.

369
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,336
Do you follow?

370
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:41,591
I'll file a suit against you for
defamation and breach of contract!

371
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:43,656
Sure.

372
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:48,424
When you sue me for defamation
my attorney will ask you...

373
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:49,623
What name?

374
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:52,843
As for the breach of contract...

375
00:44:53,753 --> 00:44:55,448
if you have honored mine,

376
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:58,301
You will get your money.

377
00:45:09,612 --> 00:45:11,546
You want to ruin me!

378
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:13,325
I will deal with you!

379
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:16,466
I will also sort out
that artist of yours!

380
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:28,385
I want to meet Vasco. Now.

381
00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:36,134
Don't you worry.

382
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:38,402
For this much money...

383
00:45:38,977 --> 00:45:43,311
I will destroy the
boy and his family.

384
00:45:43,613 --> 00:45:45,205
No...No...No....

385
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:49,114
Just see that he doesn't
make it to the show tonight.

386
00:45:49,718 --> 00:45:53,210
Don't worry. it will be done.

387
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:58,436
Mother, bless me.

388
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:01,017
This is my first show in Bombay.

389
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:03,346
Bless you.

390
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,759
I have been waiting for this day.

391
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:10,022
May God look after
you and your music.

392
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:29,957
What's wrong?

393
00:46:30,028 --> 00:46:30,756
The car stalled.

394
00:46:30,941 --> 00:46:31,999
I have a show!
I must be in time.

395
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:33,163
Take another car.

396
00:46:59,434 --> 00:47:00,401
What do you guys want?

397
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,500
I have nothing.

398
00:47:05,382 --> 00:47:08,647
- I am very poor.
- We know you are broke.

399
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:11,825
Then let me go.

400
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:15,007
- You can't.
- But why?

401
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,658
Want an answer?

402
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:20,786
You are mistaken.

403
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:23,727
This is my first show. Let me go.

404
00:47:26,168 --> 00:47:28,830
Why don't you understand?
I will lose everything!

405
00:47:31,733 --> 00:47:34,668
I apologize if
I've made a mistake.

406
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,686
Beat him black and blue
so he's knocked senseless.

407
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,014
No!

408
00:48:15,328 --> 00:48:19,424
Pardon? But he left long ago.

409
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:20,973
But he hasn't reached here.

410
00:48:22,158 --> 00:48:24,752
if he doesn't make it,
everything will be ruined!

411
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:27,565
No......!

412
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:24,708
Lord Krishna...

413
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:27,071
please protect my son....!

414
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:43,564
"Krishna..."

415
00:51:44,237 --> 00:51:46,778
"Come to Earth"

416
00:51:48,683 --> 00:51:50,309
"Krishna..."

417
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:54,003
"Teach us to love"

418
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:57,733
"Krishna...."

419
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:00,735
"Come to Earth"

420
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:04,480
"Krishna...."

421
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:08,410
"Teach us to love"

422
00:52:31,685 --> 00:52:36,247
" Life is nothing but pain and thirst"

423
00:52:38,874 --> 00:52:44,073
" Every joy lies at your feet"

424
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:50,970
" Life is nothing but pain and thirst"

425
00:52:53,245 --> 00:52:58,444
" Every joy lies at your feet"

426
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:02,087
"Come...down to us"

427
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:05,365
"Dear Krishna..."

428
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,994
"Krishna..."

429
00:53:21,738 --> 00:53:23,738
"Krishna...."

430
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:27,012
"Come to Earth"

431
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,830
"Krishna...."

432
00:53:31,439 --> 00:53:34,431
"Teach us to love"

433
00:54:24,817 --> 00:54:30,016
" Play songs of love on your flute"

434
00:54:32,074 --> 00:54:37,034
" We lose our hearts
and live with love"

435
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:44,133
" Play songs of love on your flute"

436
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:51,649
" We lose our hearts
and live with love"

437
00:54:53,247 --> 00:54:55,943
"Come...down to us"

438
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,063
" Dear Krishna.."

439
00:55:33,168 --> 00:55:37,332
" Why should we live
here without you?"

440
00:55:40,147 --> 00:55:45,016
" Why consume the venom of
agony day and night?"

441
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,517
" Why should we live
here without you?"

442
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:59,830
" Why consume the venom of
agony day and night?"

443
00:56:01,652 --> 00:56:04,352
"Come and erase it"

444
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:08,365
"Dear Krishna..."

445
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:25,490
"Krishna!"

446
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:28,878
"Come down to earth"

447
00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:32,609
"Krishna!"

448
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,450
"Teach us to love"

449
00:58:50,997 --> 00:58:53,124
I present you Rs. 50000.

450
00:58:53,774 --> 00:58:55,867
For our next show...

451
00:58:55,922 --> 00:58:58,234
as an advanced payment....

452
00:58:58,972 --> 00:59:01,895
You possess everything.
What else do you want from life?

453
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:06,145
I wanted nothing but
happiness for my mother.

454
00:59:07,995 --> 00:59:13,524
Even today I want nothing
from life but my mother's joy.

455
00:59:15,234 --> 00:59:16,826
As for mother's joys...

456
00:59:18,327 --> 00:59:19,726
Ask her.

457
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:22,073
Please lift your head.

458
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,156
Speak out.

459
00:59:26,245 --> 00:59:29,146
What could a mother want?

460
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:34,853
I want him to sing
as long as the sun exists.

461
00:59:35,027 --> 00:59:36,527
And the world dances to his tune.

462
00:59:42,866 --> 00:59:43,890
Stop it, Sam.

463
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,286
it doesn't affect me.

464
00:59:50,123 --> 00:59:53,786
What does his song have
that I am lacking?

465
01:00:10,513 --> 01:00:11,673
- How are you?
- Fine.

466
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:21,416
I want to know why
this man has come here.

467
01:00:22,922 --> 01:00:24,082
Why is he here?

468
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:27,964
He ruined me and now
wants to watch the fun!

469
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:31,030
No. You were meant to be ruined.

470
01:00:31,777 --> 01:00:33,039
I have come to meet my daughter.

471
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:34,061
At her house.

472
01:00:48,632 --> 01:00:49,894
in the world of music..

473
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:52,974
Sam is finished.

474
01:00:53,386 --> 01:00:54,785
People will forget him in a few days.

475
01:01:08,183 --> 01:01:10,014
You used to have a life.

476
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:11,211
Didn't you....?

477
01:01:12,892 --> 01:01:16,123
Don't throw away your
talent in this trash bin.

478
01:01:17,128 --> 01:01:18,288
Join Jimmy.

479
01:01:27,957 --> 01:01:28,790
See you, dear.

480
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:56,374
May you live long.

481
01:01:58,735 --> 01:02:05,376
Once I'd said, I'll make you
wealthy when I strike it big.

482
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,238
Here.

483
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:08,351
Take it.

484
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,012
- I don't want money.
- Why?

485
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:16,865
I want to drink with you.

486
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:18,961
No liquor.

487
01:02:19,296 --> 01:02:20,024
No liquor?

488
01:02:21,141 --> 01:02:24,702
Scotch abounds in the
direction you've set off.

489
01:02:25,112 --> 01:02:27,239
Taste some simple liquor.

490
01:02:27,814 --> 01:02:30,282
Later you might not get it.

491
01:02:32,285 --> 01:02:33,217
That's not true.

492
01:02:33,613 --> 01:02:35,740
You get high on country.

493
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,919
So be it. I still want it.

494
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:40,153
- Us too...
- All right.

495
01:02:41,027 --> 01:02:44,690
But we'll drink at the
place we started from.

496
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:47,726
- Let's go!
- This way.

497
01:02:48,287 --> 01:02:49,992
Country liquor, foreign car!

498
01:02:52,672 --> 01:02:53,788
Hit you?

499
01:02:54,444 --> 01:02:57,398
My friend has come from Goa.

500
01:02:58,617 --> 01:03:01,518
Citizens of Bombay, salute him.

501
01:03:09,522 --> 01:03:22,390
Mother and son are thieves!

502
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,014
What's up, boss?

503
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:27,899
This is the same locality..

504
01:03:29,075 --> 01:03:34,274
...where people called me
and my mother thieves.

505
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:37,879
Am I a thief?

506
01:03:41,716 --> 01:03:42,774
I'm not a thief.

507
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,180
Neither is my mother.

508
01:03:48,139 --> 01:03:49,265
Then why did they...?

509
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:54,795
I'm not a thief.

510
01:03:56,702 --> 01:03:59,136
My mother isn't a thief.

511
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:04,938
I'm not a thief!

512
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,534
I'm not a thief!

513
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,651
I'm not a thief!

514
01:04:16,348 --> 01:04:18,680
My mother isn't a thief!

515
01:04:19,881 --> 01:04:22,042
My mother isn't a thief.

516
01:04:23,128 --> 01:04:24,390
Wake up!

517
01:04:26,732 --> 01:04:28,859
I'm not a thief!

518
01:04:29,711 --> 01:04:33,340
My mother isn't a thief!

519
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,686
My mother isn't a thief!

520
01:04:36,342 --> 01:04:38,786
I...I....

521
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:00,339
it's Jimmy, the famous artist!

522
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:04,240
I. Jimmy..

523
01:05:05,211 --> 01:05:06,371
The same child...

524
01:05:07,902 --> 01:05:13,306
...you branded a thief
and threw us out of here.

525
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:18,311
Son, I'm Uncle Rahim.

526
01:05:18,565 --> 01:05:19,623
I'm Uncle Rahim..

527
01:05:21,554 --> 01:05:25,786
You are a religious man

528
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:29,316
Ask your Maker...

529
01:05:30,614 --> 01:05:32,775
-...if I am a thief.
- No...

530
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,064
- is my mother a thief?
- No.

531
01:05:35,534 --> 01:05:38,199
She's a saint.

532
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:44,075
She sacrificed only to see you
scale the pinnacle of success.

533
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:45,662
She's responsible for your success.

534
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,677
You are right.
She is an angel.

535
01:05:49,414 --> 01:05:51,439
Yes, she is.

536
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:54,246
Every person has
to pay for his deeds.

537
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,722
These people accused you
and your mother of theft.

538
01:05:59,424 --> 01:06:02,951
But today Oberoi's men
are evicting them.

539
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:04,571
Son. son...

540
01:06:05,865 --> 01:06:08,425
God knows when this
place will be ruined.

541
01:06:16,289 --> 01:06:18,849
Sir, this is the man.

542
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:21,208
He's killed 7 guys in London.

543
01:06:22,548 --> 01:06:24,140
He's a famous singer.

544
01:06:24,282 --> 01:06:25,442
I don't know his name.

545
01:06:26,331 --> 01:06:27,696
He murdered him too.

546
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:30,004
The chap is a top class criminal.

547
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:43,498
This year's net profit
is Rs. 3654219

548
01:06:43,902 --> 01:06:46,564
We' re paying income
tax only on 600000.

549
01:06:48,607 --> 01:06:52,703
We haven't been successful
in evicting the slum dwellers.

550
01:06:54,501 --> 01:06:57,890
- Why?
- Sathe is an independent MLA

551
01:06:58,326 --> 01:07:00,886
He is constipated.
He doesn't eat a thing.

552
01:07:01,729 --> 01:07:03,321
He has created a problem.

553
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:06,012
in such a state, the
police won't help us.

554
01:07:08,129 --> 01:07:10,495
If the life line of the
independent MLA is long..

555
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:13,278
Of what use is Vasco?

556
01:07:14,608 --> 01:07:17,941
The slum should be
vacated in 3 weeks.

557
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:25,161
Have mercy..

558
01:07:32,151 --> 01:07:34,278
Scoundrels! Fear God!

559
01:07:39,082 --> 01:07:41,525
God will punish you!

560
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:49,904
For God's sake...
Help us, dear God!

561
01:07:58,721 --> 01:07:59,312
Stop!

562
01:08:07,972 --> 01:08:09,237
Son...

563
01:08:09,364 --> 01:08:11,059
Rescue us from these demons!

564
01:08:25,883 --> 01:08:28,545
if anyone touches another thing..

565
01:08:29,584 --> 01:08:31,279
I will break his hand.

566
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:33,692
Put the stuff down.

567
01:08:36,515 --> 01:08:37,777
Why did you stop?

568
01:08:39,209 --> 01:08:41,040
Throw everything out.

569
01:08:42,054 --> 01:08:44,512
And raze the huts to the ground!

570
01:08:44,557 --> 01:08:46,787
it's not so simple.

571
01:08:48,193 --> 01:08:53,256
The soil has turned to rock
with the sweat of their brow.

572
01:08:55,746 --> 01:08:57,941
Your welfare lies in returning.

573
01:08:58,809 --> 01:09:00,834
I haven't come to go back.

574
01:09:09,273 --> 01:09:11,833
I don't think you understand
words spoken with love.

575
01:10:03,602 --> 01:10:04,432
Who sent you?

576
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:05,798
Answer me!

577
01:10:06,581 --> 01:10:07,519
Speak up!

578
01:10:15,893 --> 01:10:19,653
Go and tell him,
his Pop is no longer a kid.

579
01:10:20,191 --> 01:10:21,158
He has now grown up.

580
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,879
Go!

581
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:24,570
Good God!

582
01:10:25,557 --> 01:10:27,047
Thank you so much.

583
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:42,510
Remind me we have to go to
Mayor's house for a party.

584
01:10:42,745 --> 01:10:43,871
But, Dad!

585
01:10:52,032 --> 01:10:53,212
Sure, I'll come!

586
01:10:53,388 --> 01:10:54,985
Do bring your mother too.

587
01:10:55,522 --> 01:10:57,353
Yes, I'll bring mother.

588
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,189
Where are you taking me?

589
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:02,018
The Mayor is throwing a party
for this daughter's birthday.

590
01:11:02,192 --> 01:11:03,022
He has invited you too.

591
01:11:03,412 --> 01:11:04,696
What will I do there?

592
01:11:05,897 --> 01:11:12,663
Come only to see how the rich
of this town hover around me.

593
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:15,430
Just to get a picture taken.

594
01:11:16,695 --> 01:11:17,525
Will you come?

595
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:14,691
He has stolen my fans.

596
01:12:14,992 --> 01:12:17,984
He has stolen my future!

597
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:30,061
Please come..

598
01:12:45,422 --> 01:12:47,253
Sister, please come along.

599
01:12:52,758 --> 01:12:54,919
I present a gift for you..

600
01:12:55,495 --> 01:12:57,963
..on the occasion on my
daughter, Dolly's 18th birthday.

601
01:13:18,867 --> 01:13:20,027
Are you crying?

602
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:23,651
Yes.

603
01:13:24,469 --> 01:13:27,905
I've cried after 18 years.

604
01:13:29,206 --> 01:13:33,540
But there's a difference in these
tears and those 18 years ago.

605
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:39,368
Those were the tears of
an orphaned poor boy.

606
01:13:40,266 --> 01:13:41,324
But today's tears...

607
01:13:42,111 --> 01:13:44,579
...are the tears of
a popular famous artist.

608
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:47,477
Amongst the guests of the evening...

609
01:13:48,914 --> 01:13:52,261
..is the man who made me cry.

610
01:13:53,285 --> 01:13:56,277
Humiliated my mother and my
childhood

611
01:13:58,087 --> 01:13:59,111
Seeing him again..

612
01:14:00,466 --> 01:14:01,956
...has refreshed the wound.

613
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:04,615
So I can't sing today.

614
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:11,557
" Follow your heart"

615
01:14:12,017 --> 01:14:16,044
" Neither the dark nor the fair.."

616
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:19,982
"The world belongs to the selfless"

617
01:14:20,244 --> 01:14:25,113
I'd like you to meet
both my mothers today.

618
01:14:26,234 --> 01:14:27,394
This lady is one mother.

619
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:29,169
Her name is Radha.

620
01:14:30,282 --> 01:14:32,606
For 18 long years..

621
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:36,950
She waited for the Krishna
of my future in her eyes.

622
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:38,921
The pain in my voice..

623
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:41,738
...has reached my heart from hers.

624
01:14:43,218 --> 01:14:44,480
And my other mother..

625
01:14:46,453 --> 01:14:48,322
...is the web of this city's roads.

626
01:14:49,373 --> 01:14:51,170
My childhood played in her lap.

627
01:14:52,715 --> 01:14:55,183
I walked barefoot in the blazing sun.

628
01:14:55,313 --> 01:14:57,582
But they never questioned me..

629
01:14:58,358 --> 01:15:01,486
Orphan! Stop singing!

630
01:15:04,432 --> 01:15:06,383
Today from the Mayor's home,
I pay..

631
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:11,649
...obeisance to the roads
of Bombay that mothered me.

632
01:15:13,546 --> 01:15:20,032
On your 18th birthday,
Dolly, I present you..

633
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:23,231
...with my tears.

634
01:15:26,674 --> 01:15:28,186
Please cut the cake for me.

635
01:15:53,124 --> 01:15:55,149
The day I strike it real big..

636
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:58,995
The same heartless city will honor
me

637
01:16:00,206 --> 01:16:02,436
That day too I will
ask you to feed me.

638
01:16:08,513 --> 01:16:11,093
Great. in today's world..

639
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:12,463
The mother feeds the son.

640
01:16:17,017 --> 01:16:21,676
I'm fulfilling the promise
given to my mother years ago.

641
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:32,494
I didn't know you are him.

642
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:34,561
Yes, I am..

643
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:38,271
I still have the guitar.

644
01:16:38,591 --> 01:16:39,523
Which guitar?

645
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:43,302
Meet him...

646
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:59,005
The hand that slapped
my mother's cheek...

647
01:16:59,999 --> 01:17:01,933
I can't take that hand in mien.

648
01:17:02,732 --> 01:17:03,756
Don't worry.

649
01:17:04,337 --> 01:17:06,567
Today you are not the
mother of an orphan.

650
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,174
He can neither slap you in public.

651
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:14,987
Nor send you to jail
on charges of theft.

652
01:17:15,732 --> 01:17:17,029
My wealth has bought...

653
01:17:17,809 --> 01:17:20,619
Honor and name.

654
01:17:20,965 --> 01:17:23,229
Today I'm a good citizen of this city.

655
01:17:24,492 --> 01:17:26,187
I'm sorry to ruin your party.

656
01:17:31,573 --> 01:17:34,841
You ruined my party
by calling this man.

657
01:17:34,953 --> 01:17:36,113
I'll kill this man!

658
01:17:36,514 --> 01:17:37,981
Apologize or I won't spare you!

659
01:17:38,304 --> 01:17:39,271
Leave him!

660
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:42,967
Go away..

661
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:44,406
Sorry, she's really stupid.

662
01:17:44,656 --> 01:17:45,588
I won't spare you!

663
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:51,616
Clean up.

664
01:18:03,158 --> 01:18:04,112
Mother..

665
01:18:06,039 --> 01:18:07,529
These are tears of joy.

666
01:18:08,186 --> 01:18:11,644
I'd told you to
forget the insult.

667
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:16,619
it wasn't as if I'd forgotten.

668
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:19,139
That was a burden on my heart.

669
01:18:21,038 --> 01:18:23,363
Today you have erased it.

670
01:18:24,163 --> 01:18:26,961
Now I can die in peace.

671
01:18:28,353 --> 01:18:30,378
This city owes me nothing.

672
01:18:31,202 --> 01:18:33,136
Nor do I owe it a thing.

673
01:18:37,681 --> 01:18:42,904
You'll pay for
insulting PN Oberoi...

674
01:18:43,793 --> 01:18:45,385
A heavy price.

675
01:19:31,721 --> 01:19:33,068
I've come for the autograph.

676
01:19:33,293 --> 01:19:34,351
Where is the book?

677
01:19:40,756 --> 01:19:43,020
That night when I found out..

678
01:19:43,963 --> 01:19:45,312
...at the Mayor's party
that you are the same..

679
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:52,576
I could feel the pain
of your years old wounds.

680
01:19:54,213 --> 01:19:55,343
I couldn't sleep.

681
01:19:58,095 --> 01:19:59,255
Wounds do heal.

682
01:20:00,275 --> 01:20:01,765
But the marks remain.

683
01:20:05,774 --> 01:20:10,207
I'll erase them with my love.

684
01:21:35,662 --> 01:21:38,220
It's a promise....

685
01:21:39,348 --> 01:21:42,205
You are my heart, my life.

686
01:21:54,230 --> 01:21:55,498
My life is with you.

687
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,050
I'll give my life for you.

688
01:21:59,596 --> 01:22:01,757
Nothing matters without you.

689
01:22:29,865 --> 01:22:30,695
I must go.

690
01:22:30,954 --> 01:22:32,785
- When do we meet?
- Tomorrow.

691
01:22:33,195 --> 01:22:35,129
Tomorrow is faraway.

692
01:22:35,662 --> 01:22:37,254
Learn to wait for tomorrow.

693
01:22:37,297 --> 01:22:39,390
Tomorrow won't come the
day after but tomorrow.

694
01:22:58,047 --> 01:23:01,710
Give me a sweet memory
to wait for the morrow.

695
01:23:23,823 --> 01:23:24,949
Where had you gone?

696
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,297
Out.

697
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:29,237
- With whom were you?
- With Jimmy.

698
01:23:29,716 --> 01:23:32,708
Have you no shame going
around with our enemy?

699
01:23:34,724 --> 01:23:37,750
First of all why would I go
with him if I felt shame?

700
01:23:38,145 --> 01:23:40,449
Secondly he's not Sam's enemy.

701
01:23:40,731 --> 01:23:43,161
He's a far superior disco dancer.

702
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:49,397
Someday you must watch him,
listen to him...he is a dream

703
01:23:52,789 --> 01:23:54,186
Girls from good families..

704
01:23:54,518 --> 01:23:56,736
...don't dream without
the parent's permission.

705
01:23:58,216 --> 01:24:00,059
Don't you know he's
using you as a step..

706
01:24:00,083 --> 01:24:01,715
..to get my wealth and honor.

707
01:24:02,017 --> 01:24:04,190
An orphan without a
name or a family...

708
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:05,733
..who grew up in the
ditches and slums..

709
01:24:06,427 --> 01:24:08,691
I don't like my daughter meeting him!

710
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,307
if you must, cry in your
room with the door shut!

711
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,123
Another thing...

712
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:19,346
Henceforth you won't
meet anyone like Jimmy

713
01:24:31,443 --> 01:24:34,241
- Yes?
- I can't come to meet you.

714
01:24:34,692 --> 01:24:35,719
Why?

715
01:24:36,496 --> 01:24:38,930
Mother has cooked for you.

716
01:24:39,643 --> 01:24:40,701
I can't come.

717
01:24:43,588 --> 01:24:45,055
You can't or don't want to come?

718
01:24:47,731 --> 01:24:50,680
My Daddy doesn't want me to see
you.

719
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:55,056
Do you love me?

720
01:24:59,858 --> 01:25:02,112
Then be ready. I'm on my way.

721
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:14,374
Where is Rita?

722
01:25:16,519 --> 01:25:19,120
You! How dare you step in my house!

723
01:25:19,133 --> 01:25:20,623
The answer to this is pretty long.

724
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:24,349
When I mustered up courage to live
coming here was no big deal.

725
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:25,872
This is the home of a coward.

726
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:26,871
Where are you going?

727
01:25:29,209 --> 01:25:31,803
A cruel father has
hidden his daughter here.

728
01:25:32,421 --> 01:25:33,479
She loves me.

729
01:25:33,983 --> 01:25:34,915
I've come for her.

730
01:25:35,493 --> 01:25:37,723
I love her and will marry her.

731
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:39,751
You may come to bless us
if you have the time.

732
01:25:41,476 --> 01:25:44,902
You are Rita's father.
I won't raise my hand.

733
01:25:47,633 --> 01:25:48,463
Come along.

734
01:25:50,628 --> 01:25:51,851
You won't step out of this house

735
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,470
I will go.

736
01:25:54,556 --> 01:25:55,967
This is no longer my home.

737
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,058
it's a prison.

738
01:26:02,633 --> 01:26:05,705
- The matter is..Mr. Jimmy...
- I know.

739
01:26:06,385 --> 01:26:08,080
He called you in my presence.

740
01:26:09,783 --> 01:26:11,898
Explain this rule to Daddy.

741
01:26:12,055 --> 01:26:16,821
Adults aren't kidnapped.
They leave of their own will.

742
01:26:18,854 --> 01:26:20,638
We're getting engaged on Monday.

743
01:26:21,283 --> 01:26:22,588
You must attend.

744
01:26:22,633 --> 01:26:23,763
With the family.

745
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:30,281
Mother, are you happy?

746
01:26:31,828 --> 01:26:36,051
The auction of Vijay Mill
begins. Rs. one million.

747
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:37,901
Two million.

748
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:38,966

Six million.

752

Six million...once!
Six million...twice!

753
01:26:52,194 --> 01:26:52,922
Seven million.

754
01:26:55,886 --> 01:26:58,912
He wants me to lose face in business

755
01:26:59,898 --> 01:27:01,593
Do join in and take a seat.

756
01:27:09,108 --> 01:27:10,268
Eight million.

757
01:27:11,252 --> 01:27:12,082
Nine million.

758
01:27:13,485 --> 01:27:14,213
Ten million.

759
01:27:15,575 --> 01:27:16,507
Fifteen million.

760
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:18,911
Twenty million

761
01:27:21,024 --> 01:27:22,286
Twenty five million.

762
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:25,027
Thirty million.

763
01:27:28,127 --> 01:27:29,151
Thirty five million.

764
01:27:31,967 --> 01:27:32,776
Forty million.

765
01:27:35,864 --> 01:27:36,897
Fifty million.

766
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,042
Sixty million.

767
01:27:47,019 --> 01:27:48,179
Seventy million.

768
01:27:49,685 --> 01:27:50,826
Good price...!

769
01:27:53,704 --> 01:27:54,637
You take it.

770
01:27:55,659 --> 01:27:59,387
Seventy million.... once
Seventy million....twice

771
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:01,190
Seventy million...thrice

772
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,122
What have you done?

773
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,474
Bought goods worth
10 million for 70!

774
01:28:05,756 --> 01:28:07,675
You will lose everything this way!
- Yes!

775
01:28:10,037 --> 01:28:11,582
That's what I want.

776
01:28:12,547 --> 01:28:15,311
I want you to walk
barefoot on the streets.

777
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:18,754
That's why I came to the auction.

778
01:30:12,386 --> 01:30:15,287
" Dancing is my life"

779
01:30:19,494 --> 01:30:22,622
" I love singing"

780
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:29,158
" Dance and sing with me"

781
01:31:15,406 --> 01:31:16,373
" Friends...."

782
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:19,768
" My life is indebted to songs"

783
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:22,997
"That's why I was born"

784
01:31:24,367 --> 01:31:27,495
" People say, I could sing..."

785
01:31:27,769 --> 01:31:30,465
"..even before I could speak"

786
01:31:31,409 --> 01:31:34,845
" My feet would tap..."

787
01:31:35,111 --> 01:31:37,909
"...when I couldn't' walk"

788
01:31:38,568 --> 01:31:41,991
" My youth bears the
passion of my songs"

789
01:31:42,153 --> 01:31:45,714
" And the pain of my wounds"

790
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,218
"This is my defeat"

791
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:53,820
"This is my conquest"

792
01:31:55,993 --> 01:31:57,551
"These songs of mine"

793
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:00,952
"So sing and dance with me"

794
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:20,823
" What does D stand for?"

795
01:32:26,367 --> 01:32:28,733
" D stands for Dance"

796
01:32:29,895 --> 01:32:32,557
" I signifies Item"

797
01:32:33,442 --> 01:32:36,434
"S is for the Singer"

798
01:32:37,142 --> 01:32:39,770
"C is for the Chorus"

799
01:32:40,412 --> 01:32:42,846
" And O stands for the Orchestra"

800
01:32:52,295 --> 01:32:53,353
What's your name?

801
01:32:55,093 --> 01:32:58,893
" Do you know what youth is?
- No, I don't"

802
01:33:11,077 --> 01:33:13,773
" Youth is a wave"

803
01:33:14,379 --> 01:33:17,439
" Youth is exhilaration"

804
01:33:18,226 --> 01:33:24,961
"Only the young know what it is"

805
01:33:26,931 --> 01:33:30,059
"There is an age of amour
In every moment of youth"

806
01:33:30,215 --> 01:33:33,116
" Rebellion youth"

807
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:40,781
"The youth meet the world
Like water and fire"

808
01:33:41,042 --> 01:33:44,465
" Why don't we do as
We please at this age?"

809
01:33:44,688 --> 01:33:48,317
" And cross all limits"

810
01:33:51,707 --> 01:33:53,402
" Where you find love.."

811
01:33:55,099 --> 01:33:56,896
"There, my friend.."

812
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:00,665
"..Is where you lose your heart?"

813
01:34:00,716 --> 01:34:03,742
" So sing and dance with me"

814
01:34:15,451 --> 01:34:18,682
" Singing is my life"

815
01:34:22,163 --> 01:34:25,621
" I'm crazy about it"

816
01:34:28,863 --> 01:34:32,321
"Sing and dance with me"

817
01:36:05,036 --> 01:36:05,926
What's the matter?

818
01:36:05,966 --> 01:36:06,932
Why did you call me?

819
01:36:07,445 --> 01:36:10,972
I can't bear to see the
State Sam is in. I feel...

820
01:36:12,922 --> 01:36:13,547
There he is.

821
01:36:31,341 --> 01:36:32,501
What have you done to yourself?

822
01:36:32,531 --> 01:36:33,361
Come to your senses.

823
01:36:37,339 --> 01:36:40,331
Come to my senses? For what?

824
01:36:44,165 --> 01:36:46,497
To put up with
Disgrace and humiliation?

825
01:36:52,616 --> 01:36:55,220
Son, be brave.
I will set everything right.

826
01:36:55,927 --> 01:36:59,488
Nobody can do anything for me.

827
01:37:00,219 --> 01:37:02,585
Your wealth, honor and power..

828
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,840
That slum dweller
Has wrecked everything!

829
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,157
He took your daughter away
And you could do nothing.

830
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:15,403
Now because of him,
You will lose your son.

831
01:37:15,977 --> 01:37:17,342
And you'll be able to do nothing!

832
01:37:21,591 --> 01:37:23,286
I won't let you be hurt.

833
01:37:25,558 --> 01:37:27,719
Even if I have to take his life.

834
01:37:28,315 --> 01:37:30,410
Tomorrow Jimmy is going to a party.

835
01:37:31,462 --> 01:37:34,590
People will ask him to
Play the electric guitar.

836
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:37,648
And he will play.

837
01:37:38,772 --> 01:37:43,573
Just as he is about to
Touch the electric guitar..

838
01:37:46,421 --> 01:37:53,386
My man will connect the strings
Of the guitar to 5000 Volts.

839
01:37:55,049 --> 01:37:58,041
Then our enemy will be demolished.

840
01:38:17,896 --> 01:38:19,119
Who is she?

841
01:38:20,425 --> 01:38:22,450
A friend of my son.

842
01:38:22,549 --> 01:38:23,914
- Mother.
- What?

843
01:38:24,309 --> 01:38:25,165
Come with us.

844
01:38:25,393 --> 01:38:26,474
Are you mad?

845
01:38:26,636 --> 01:38:29,332
Are you a kid to walk?
Holding mothers' finger?

846
01:38:29,658 --> 01:38:30,577
Mother, please come.

847
01:38:30,647 --> 01:38:33,673
I would if it weren't
For Krishna's birth prayers.

848
01:38:33,848 --> 01:38:35,280
- You go on.
- Mother, you..

849
01:38:37,872 --> 01:38:38,600
Live long.

850
01:38:40,987 --> 01:38:41,919
Here...

851
01:38:48,551 --> 01:38:52,510
Move back. Jimmy is coming!

852
01:39:08,917 --> 01:39:10,016
Is Jimmy there?

853
01:39:10,082 --> 01:39:11,403
He's gone out.

854
01:39:12,837 --> 01:39:14,858
The guitar Jimmy will
Play in the party...

855
01:39:15,132 --> 01:39:16,064
...It carries a current.

856
01:39:16,595 --> 01:39:17,828
There's a conspiracy to kill him.

857
01:39:17,891 --> 01:39:18,532
What?

858
01:39:22,747 --> 01:39:24,078
No!

859
01:39:24,831 --> 01:39:28,062
You have given me
So many honors here.

860
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:31,828
This is the same place
Where as a child...

861
01:39:32,321 --> 01:39:36,985
I'd sing with my master,
Raju for merely 10 paise.

862
01:39:37,065 --> 01:39:38,532
Jimmy, you'll sing today too!

863
01:39:44,713 --> 01:39:46,102
Yes, I will sing today.

864
01:40:21,338 --> 01:40:24,330
Now you must strum
A song on the guitar.

865
01:40:40,093 --> 01:40:43,824
Mother!

866
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:29,936
Did you sleep last night?

867
01:41:33,287 --> 01:41:34,777
How long will you stay awake?

868
01:41:35,978 --> 01:41:37,486
Why did she die my death?

869
01:41:41,977 --> 01:41:44,207
Mothers have always sacrificed
Themselves for their sons.

870
01:41:44,969 --> 01:41:47,870
Will her soul find peace
seeing you in this state?

871
01:41:51,846 --> 01:41:53,336
But what can I do?

872
01:41:56,710 --> 01:42:00,612
Spread the music that is
in your voice and your fingers.

873
01:42:13,674 --> 01:42:16,618
I can't sing..

874
01:42:23,777 --> 01:42:27,213
Jimmy, everyone lives their lives.

875
01:42:28,099 --> 01:42:29,464
And dies their own death.

876
01:42:30,558 --> 01:42:34,460
if you think you loved
mother as much as you think..

877
01:42:35,873 --> 01:42:37,670
Don't consider her a corpse.

878
01:42:38,647 --> 01:42:40,404
She's with you every moment.

879
01:42:40,714 --> 01:42:41,874
With you.

880
01:42:42,811 --> 01:42:46,269
in the dreams she dreamed for you.

881
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:52,789
She wanted your music to
pulsate like a heartbeat.

882
01:42:52,968 --> 01:42:54,799
keep her alive through your music.

883
01:42:56,699 --> 01:42:58,291
Treat your music like your mother.

884
01:43:00,865 --> 01:43:03,013
Sing, Jimmy.

885
01:43:03,193 --> 01:43:04,455
Please sing.

886
01:43:11,949 --> 01:43:12,737
Friends...

887
01:43:13,885 --> 01:43:15,819
That night some part of my...

888
01:43:17,112 --> 01:43:23,624
...music, my soul must have
got burnt with my mother.

889
01:43:24,686 --> 01:43:27,951
Hence if you find
more pain in my song..

890
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:34,312
Or see tears in my melody..

891
01:43:36,799 --> 01:43:38,391
Forgive me.

892
01:43:44,174 --> 01:43:45,004
No!!

893
01:43:45,607 --> 01:43:48,201
No! Mother!

894
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:48,847
No....

895
01:44:09,256 --> 01:44:10,086
Good news.

896
01:44:10,216 --> 01:44:11,148
is Jimmy dead?

897
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:14,595
Now he'll never sing.

898
01:44:14,865 --> 01:44:16,127
He's got guitar phobia.

899
01:44:18,582 --> 01:44:21,039
I mean he has a fear for the guitar.

900
01:44:21,148 --> 01:44:22,638
A guitar killed his mother.

901
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,297
Now he can never touch a guitar.

902
01:44:25,757 --> 01:44:27,479
if ever he does get well...

903
01:44:28,006 --> 01:44:30,566
Vasco won't spare him.

904
01:44:31,113 --> 01:44:33,121
He's following him like a shadow.

905
01:45:02,246 --> 01:45:05,477
The prey is walking into the trap.

906
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:35,638
Stop.

907
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:38,011
Break his legs.

908
01:47:10,999 --> 01:47:12,159
Throw him into the bushes.

909
01:48:40,101 --> 01:48:41,123
One by one.

910
01:48:43,045 --> 01:48:44,774
Will he ever be able
to perform on stage?

911
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:46,133
Of course.

912
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:50,162
Will Jimmy participate in the
international disco competition?

913
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:51,027
Sure, he will.

914
01:48:51,219 --> 01:48:52,819
- Will he win?
- No doubt.

915
01:48:53,685 --> 01:48:55,277
- Can you tell me...
- No more.

916
01:48:55,407 --> 01:48:56,465
One last question.

917
01:48:59,148 --> 01:49:03,846
Sir, we bought this for Jimmy
by collecting donations.

918
01:49:04,505 --> 01:49:08,066
Uncle, tell him he has to get better.

919
01:49:08,562 --> 01:49:12,555
All the girls and boys living on
the footpath of Bombay prays for him.

920
01:49:13,062 --> 01:49:14,757
He is one of us.

921
01:49:15,758 --> 01:49:18,693
Like us he grew up on
the footpath of Bombay.

922
01:49:20,764 --> 01:49:21,750
I'll tell him.

923
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:24,433
He will have to get better for you.

924
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:28,980
He will sing for you on the 10th.

925
01:49:29,069 --> 01:49:30,900
- Will he?
- Yes.

926
01:50:38,115 --> 01:50:39,275
Jimmy won't sing.

927
01:50:40,882 --> 01:50:42,474
He will die when alive.

928
01:50:43,895 --> 01:50:47,763
I don't want to see
Jimmy alive before I die.

929
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:49,620
I understand.

930
01:50:50,456 --> 01:50:51,514
Jimmy won't sing.

931
01:50:52,086 --> 01:50:56,331
if he does, it will
be his last song.

932
01:51:04,561 --> 01:51:09,326
in the international
Disco Competition..

933
01:51:10,262 --> 01:51:14,358
Participants from many countries
are demonstrating their prowess.

934
01:51:18,112 --> 01:51:23,201
Now you'll enjoy the dance of
Disco king and Queen of Africa.

935
01:51:54,993 --> 01:52:00,324
Now...disco king and
queen of Paris....

936
01:53:16,645 --> 01:53:19,205
Mother!

937
01:55:04,382 --> 01:55:11,550
"Jimmy, come to me"

938
01:55:11,681 --> 01:55:15,014
"Jimmy, come close to me
The night is young"

939
01:55:15,192 --> 01:55:19,028
" it calls out your name
to sing out the song"

940
01:55:19,253 --> 01:55:22,484
"Jimmy, come"

941
01:55:26,463 --> 01:55:34,057
"The night cries out to you
to sing the same song"

942
01:56:11,086 --> 01:56:18,318
" Why are you soundless?
Break the silence"

943
01:56:18,522 --> 01:56:25,360
" No point living like a loser
Give up this craziness"

944
01:56:26,024 --> 01:56:32,657
" Why are you soundless?
Break the silence"

945
01:56:33,571 --> 01:56:40,374
" No point living like a loser
Give up this craziness"

946
01:56:40,782 --> 01:56:44,183
"Come to me
The night is young"

947
01:56:44,352 --> 01:56:47,788
" Listen to it call out to you
sing the song for the night"

948
01:56:48,265 --> 01:56:55,330
"Jimmy.....Come to me"

949
01:56:55,534 --> 01:57:02,599
"The night cries out to you
to sing the same song"

950
01:57:02,937 --> 01:57:06,395
"Jimmy, come on"

951
01:57:06,637 --> 01:57:10,300
"Jimmy....Come"

952
01:57:12,411 --> 01:57:15,209
"Come on Jimmy"

953
01:57:16,156 --> 01:57:19,387
"Come on Jimmy"

954
01:57:19,731 --> 01:57:28,196
"The night cries out to you
to sing the same song"

955
01:57:35,793 --> 01:57:39,251
I had no idea that
you were so weak.

956
01:58:06,701 --> 01:58:10,831
" What is yours?"

957
01:58:11,309 --> 01:58:15,211
" What is mine?"

958
01:58:15,677 --> 01:58:22,810
" Forget it my friend"

959
01:58:23,618 --> 01:58:25,108
"Sing, my son"

960
01:58:45,203 --> 01:58:49,765
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

961
01:58:50,178 --> 01:58:54,774
"The world belongs to the selfless"

962
01:58:55,283 --> 01:58:59,811
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

963
01:59:00,288 --> 01:59:04,576
"The world belongs to the selfless"

964
01:59:04,666 --> 01:59:14,564
" We guys live and die with a smile"

965
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:19,276
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

966
01:59:20,309 --> 01:59:25,679
"The world belongs to the selfless"

967
01:59:35,206 --> 01:59:39,768
" Neither gold nor silver.."

968
01:59:40,165 --> 01:59:44,932
" We love songs"

969
01:59:45,283 --> 01:59:49,720
" Neither gold nor silver.."

970
01:59:50,068 --> 01:59:54,732
" We love songs"

971
01:59:55,470 --> 02:00:00,347
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

972
02:00:00,657 --> 02:00:04,867
"The world belongs to the selfless"

973
02:00:05,218 --> 02:00:15,116
" We guys live and die with a smile"

974
02:00:15,497 --> 02:00:19,934
" Neither the fair nor the dark.."

975
02:00:20,435 --> 02:00:25,634
"The world belongs to the selfless"

976
02:00:30,884 --> 02:00:32,283
Sing!!!

977
02:00:36,717 --> 02:00:38,981
Sing!!!

978
02:00:40,967 --> 02:00:42,730
I said, sing!!!

979
02:00:47,795 --> 02:00:54,151
Sing! Toss the screams of
your mother in your songs!

980
02:00:54,770 --> 02:00:56,260
Sing.

981
02:01:00,133 --> 02:01:01,791
if you don't sing...

982
02:01:01,844 --> 02:01:03,120
...your mother will really die!

983
02:01:03,145 --> 02:01:04,703
No!!!

984
02:01:08,190 --> 02:01:09,885
Here, sing!

985
02:01:50,462 --> 02:01:57,300
" I remember..."

986
02:01:58,232 --> 02:02:02,328
"...your love"

987
02:02:22,573 --> 02:02:31,709
" Memories of your
love come flooding back"

988
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:35,692
" I am here, but where are you?"

989
02:02:36,068 --> 02:02:38,810
" Come to me just once"

990
02:02:39,707 --> 02:02:48,979
" Memories of your
love come flooding back"

991
02:02:49,817 --> 02:02:53,041
" I am here, but where are you?"

992

" All left me, I am all alone"

1007

" Whom do I call out to?"

1008
02:05:28,806 --> 02:05:37,805
" Memories of your
love come flooding"

1009

you are my life"

sacrifice my life for you"

1015

You don't leave me.

Don't leave me.

1023
02:08:34,348 --> 02:08:36,049
Even if I'm not with you...

1024
02:08:38,411 --> 02:08:39,681
it won't matter.

1025
02:08:42,370 --> 02:08:46,107
My songs will always be with you.

1026
02:08:46,811 --> 02:08:49,205
Neither gold nor silver.

1027
02:08:53,148 --> 02:08:57,015
Sing a lullaby...

1028
02:08:58,653 --> 02:09:01,746
And put my life to sleep.

1029
02:09:02,192 --> 02:09:04,558
Yes, sing.

1030

" I am crazy about songs"

1034
02:14:00,786 --> 02:14:04,347
