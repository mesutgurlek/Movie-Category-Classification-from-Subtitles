1
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,686
- Good-day, sir.
- Your juice, sir.

2
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,762
Good-day, sir.

3
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,658
Stop here. Drop me near my vehicle.

4
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,729
Get the AC repaired and phone me
at six in the evening, okay?

5
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,397
Hey, what's this?
Take your car ahead.

6
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,631
- My madam wants to alight.
- Which madam?

7
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,916
Ask your driver to
take the car ahead. Hurry!

8
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:29,747
- Driver.
- Yes?

9
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:34,086
Tell the gentleman's driver
to ask his boss to talk politely.

10
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,754
Hey, driver! Ask your boss
to talk politely with my madam.

11
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:38,931
What!

12
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,764
Tell her that it is their fault,
she need not advice me.

13
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,493
- Driver.
- Yes, madam?

14
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,762
Tell the gentleman's driver...

15
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,840
... to ask his boss why he's
getting off from the wrong side.

16
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:54,910
Driver, tell her that it is my car.
l'll get off from any side l want to.

17
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,112
Driver, tell him that
this is my car too.

18
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,581
Even l will stop it
wherever l please.

19
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,284
That's it! Now speak!

20
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,522
Sir... say something.

21
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,958
Tell her that there is
no need to talk impudently.

22
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,457
And to display the false pride
of wealth before me!

23
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,798
One also requires etiquette
to move in big cars!

24
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,303
Sir, that's a long sentence.
Tell her directly.

25
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,731
- What did l say?
- Let it be, driver.

26
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,135
l do not have time to argue
with such worthless people.

27
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,469
- Take my Mercedes in the front.
- Yes, madam.

28
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,876
Whom did you call worthless?

29
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,151
- Sir, she called me worthless.
- She did?

30
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,875
- Yes, sir.
- Then it's okay.

31
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,146
Take the car to office.

32
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,755
- Sir, l can't spot your vehicle.
- lt's in the front.

33
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,954
- Get the AC repaired.
- Yes, sir.

34
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,231
Hey, quickly move
your junk aside! Hurry!

35
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,636
lt had to stall now!

36
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,476
Will matters end by saying sorry?
lt certainly won't do.

37
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,578
Constable, how are you?

38
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,253
- What happened?
- She has no licence.

39
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,584
Then how can she ride?

40
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,389
Think coolly. Would you stop
a lady driving a Mercedes?

41
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,758
- No.
- Then?

42
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,092
Hey, l would stop!

43
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,264
So stop a lady driving a Mercedes.
Why are you harassing this poor girl?

44
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,735
Hey, poor girl, apologise. The
constable is our protector, Bela.

45
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,279
How is father? Has the
operation been done?

46
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,882
Her father is very ill.
The poor man's kidneys have failed.

47
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,411
- What are you saying!
- Both his hearts too have failed.

48
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,120
- What are you saying!
- The truth.

49
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,917
You should go to the hospital
at the earliest.

50
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,286
You are noble.

51
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,893
Hey, what are you doing?

52
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,029
Let's go?

53
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,295
My name is Rahul.
What is your name, Bela?

54
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,109
l was roaming in my company's car.
Whose car were you in?

55
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,814
lt belonged to the person, whose
company l had gone to for some work.

56
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:17,983
l see.

57
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,717
What's wrong?
Has the Mercedes given way?

58
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,819
l'll fix it. l'm used to it. My
scooter keeps giving way at odd times.

59
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,057
There's petrol, isn't there?

60
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,329
There is... Where were you going?

61
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,599
To the hostel. l stay in a hostel.

62
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,737
l see.

63
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,868
Your scooter is repaired,
and my hand...

64
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,170
Take this.

65
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,077
Please don't feel bad if l said
something offensive in a fit of fury.

66
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,179
Thank you. Bye. See you again.

67
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,353
ln a Mercedes, huh?

68
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,752
On these very roads.

69
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,855
Hey, Reema, your kerchief.
No... Seema, no...

70
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,863
What was her name?

71
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,540
Mrs. Joshi, how often have
l told you not to take any tension?

72
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,369
All the tests have been done.
So has the ECG.

73
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,547
You are afraid of tests
the way a school child is.

74
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,378
Doctor, my mother will
be fine, won't she?

75
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,382
Well, what l feared has happened.
She needs a bypass surgery.

76
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,382
ls there any risk involved?

77
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:37,119
No, there is no risk but it is
very essential to take precautions.

78
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,263
Okay.

79
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,127
Dr. Pathak is the city's
most eminent cardiologist.

80
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,928
He'll come from America next month.
The surgery will be performed then.

81
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,865
ln the meantime, l'll prescribe
some important medicines.

82
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,410
Can l take my sister to Nasik
until the operation date gets fixed?

83
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,579
Uncle, you're...

84
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,409
No. By the way, it's a good idea.

85
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,212
She'll also get some rest, away from
the hustle and bustle of the city.

86
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,414
But bear one thing in mind.

87
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,253
She should not undergo
any trauma or tension.

88
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,352
Hurry, the train will leave.

89
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,154
Don't roam around much
for the wedding.

90
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,695
That boy is, anyway,
of a loose character.

91
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:16,028
He will find himself a bride but
when are you going to get married?

92
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,330
My bride has come home long back.
You have not even blessed her today.

93
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,039
Come on, first bless her.

94
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,832
Okay, l have blessed her!

95
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,443
You know that l have
been wedded to my dreams.

96
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,447
To this advertising agency of mine.

97
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,017
Look, how huge and
beautiful the office is!

98
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,311
- How often will you show it to me?
- Every now and then!

99
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,113
l will continue to do so until the
advertising office becomes mine.

100
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,721
Someone has rightly said,
first acquire a status, then a wife.

101
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,658
You're really crazy.

102
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,294
l remained a bachelor,
searching for a job like this!

103
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,796
Dear uncle! The heart
has very little space.

104
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,796
lt can accommodate
either money or love.

105
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,270
You'll never know when a girl
will walk into your heart.

106
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,306
- A girl... a girl!
- What happened?

107
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,808
Oh, l forgot! l had
an appointment at six.

108
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,010
l have to go to office
after that. l'll leave, mother.

109
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,478
Take care, mother...
Uncle, look after her.

110
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,616
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Bless you.

111
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,879
- l mean, you say...
- Bless you!

112
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,348
The scooter keys.

113
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,425
- Why are you so beautiful?
- Get going now!

114
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,155
Our whole family is beautiful!

115
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,327
Fraud?

116
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,904
Yes... fraud! All men
are alike! Liars!

117
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,906
What were the words?
...'lt is an eternal bond!'

118
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,667
You misunderstand me.

119
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,509
- l don't want it!
- Listen to me, please!

120
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,312
Everything's been said!

121
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,183
Scoundrel, cheater...

122
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,059
Not tire, boss... crook, rascal...

123
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,934
She was very invective.

124
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,534
l didn't know that the poor girl
was so madly in love with me.

125
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,882
Anyway, there are many
fishes in the sea!

126
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,152
The beauty contest arrangements
are going on in full swing.

127
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,551
l've given the details to Shukla
and told Mr. Sharma for the VlP...

128
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,950
Where are you going, boss?

129
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,891
Rahul, l am going to meet Tina.

130
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,720
But, boss, you are
forgetting something.

131
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,559
What am l forgetting?

132
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,561
lt's your wedding anniversary today.

133
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:34,832
Oh yes! l forgot! And l also
forgot to get a gift for Sheela.

134
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,774
When will l be of help? l have
already bought a gift for your wife.

135
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,414
And, boss, when she sees that gift,
she will remarry you!

136
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,411
- Are you speaking the truth?
- Yes, boss.

137
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,846
This is why you are
my right-hand man.

138
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,587
Boss, this is my left hand.
The right hand...

139
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,860
Come in, Mr. Shukla.

140
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,335
- You've come at the right time.
- Really?

141
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,604
l was going to give Rahul
some good news.

142
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,601
The advertising agency
l had spoken to you about...

143
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,267
... its plan has been passed. Your
dream is going to be realised soon.

144
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:17,277
You will sit on the boss' chair.
Success will touch your feet.

145
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,608
There will be many people
working under you.

146
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,947
And l will fulfil
this dream of yours, Rahul.

147
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,882
Let's go, Mr. Shukla.

148
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,221
Boss, there's a problem.

149
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,624
l'll give the gift to
your wife but for that...

150
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,498
- ln this pocket, boss.
- How do you know?

151
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,811
l mean, you generally keep it here.

152
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,779
Boss, thank you for the office.

153
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,504
My share?

154
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,679
Hey, don't you feel ashamed,
repeatedly asking for money?

155
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,210
Do you feel ashamed?

156
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,678
You don't, right? Then neither do l.

157
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,276
After all, l am your disciple!

158
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,845
l have only one ambition in life.
To become your stooge.

159
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,148
- Hey! Don't butter me so much!
- l'm not...

160
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,489
Take your share
and get ready soon.

161
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,561
We have to take
a gift for Mrs. Sheela.

162
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,098
- A gift?
- Not with your money but with this.

163
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,165
Come on!

164
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,075
- How are you?
- Show us the dance from 'Rangeela'.

165
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,151
Take it easy. Now, turn around.

166
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,591
Slowly open your eyes.

167
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,000
What's this?

168
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,398
From this angle,
it looks like a piano.

169
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,505
Actually, this is your
wedding anniversary gift.

170
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,466
Sent by Mr. Siddarth
with lots of love.

171
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,877
But where is Siddarth?

172
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,846
He must be on his way. l think, he
must be held up with some urgent work.

173
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,053
He's too busy these days!

174
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,418
But how is this gift?

175
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,490
lt's very nice, isn't it? And see
what else he has sent for you.

176
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,757
Look at what's written.

177
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,804
This piano is made of seven notes.

178
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,173
Similarly, may our relationship
also last for seven lives!

179
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,909
- Has Siddarth written this?
- l have.

180
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,713
l'm joking, madam.

181
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:37,820
Mrs. Sheela, perhaps you are
not aware that in some corner...

182
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,855
... of the heart of Mr. Siddarth,
the businessman, lies a hidden poet.

183
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,560
- Really?
- Yes.

184
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:48,897
Anyway, you're so lovely that anyone
who sees you will become a poet.

185
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,336
- Right, Johnny?
- Yes, of course. Let me say...

186
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:58,234
Not now... Beauty, brains,
bank balance - all in one woman!

187
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,876
Where do you find one nowadays?

188
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:06,480
Where?... where is
your father, my big boss?

189
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,752
- Upstairs.
- l'll go and seek his blessings.

190
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,489
Here.

191
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,420
What's wrong, Bhushan?
Where are you lost?

192
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,757
How to make someone happy!

193
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,428
One should learn this from
your dear son-in-law Siddarth!

194
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,901
Why did you entrust
your entire empire to him?

195
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,235
After all, he is my son-in-law.

196
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,110
Well, l am your nephew.
Even l have a right.

197
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,446
Uncle, just give me one chance.
l'll do better than Siddarth.

198
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,783
That's provided, he gives me
a chance to complain.

199
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,114
Sometimes,...

200
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,391
What is my able son-in-law doing?

201
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:56,123
He is making very elaborate
arrangements for the beauty contest.

202
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,637
Really? l had phoned
the office just now.

203
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,470
Siddarth is not in the office.

204
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,941
When did l say that he was?

205
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,738
l told you, he's making elaborate
arrangements for the beauty show.

206
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,949
Sir, you know, a lot of meetings
are held for the preparations.

207
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,544
First, a meeting with the sponsors,
then with the photographers,...

208
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,811
... then, the models, and with
the photographers again...

209
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,012
... to talk
of the models' meeting,...

210
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,488
... and then with the sponsors to
talk of the photographers' meeting!

211
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:27,624
And it's my boss who's doing
the job with love and sincerity.

212
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:34,903
This is for you on my behalf.

213
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,705
lt's such a lovely necklace!

214
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:43,337
No, this is not a necklace
but an eternal bond.

215
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,178
Now, two hearts,
two lives, two bodies,...

216
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,849
... will become one forever.

217
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,787
Johnny, for the first time,
l have liked a girl.

218
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,061
- Does the girl stay in this hostel?
- Yes, she does.

219
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,666
Tell me what the matter is!

220
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,136
Nothing. l'm just getting nervous.

221
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,737
You are nervous! Whom should
you fear when you are a boy?!

222
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,372
- A girl!
- That's also right.

223
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,005
l have to return her kerchief.

224
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,213
Hey, mister! What are you
doing here at night?

225
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,039
- Nothing.
- We...

226
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,681
- Come here!
- Coming.

227
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,876
Why are you roaming here?
What is it?

228
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,213
- How are you?
- Fine.

229
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,015
- Hey, at least, salute!
- Hello.

230
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,747
l want to meet her...

231
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,759
Whom?

232
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,721
- What was her name?
- How do l know? You should!

233
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,496
Tell me the name of the
most beautiful girl here.

234
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,397
Hey, what's her name?

235
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,096
- She is Seema.
- Seema is the one l wanted to meet.

236
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,936
- Sir!
- He'll come.

237
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,972
- But where are you going?
- l'll be back.

238
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,111
Hi! You?

239
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,254
Did you recognise me?
Mercedes, constable... remember?

240
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,455
Yes, of course, l remember.

241
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,584
My name is Johnny. l work
at your office, remember?

242
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,257
He is Johnny, he works
with me. She is Seema.

243
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,993
You had to return
Mr. Verma's file, right?

244
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,534
l returned it long back.

245
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,009
You had to send the design
for 'Sweety sherbet', right?

246
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,271
l'll send it tomorrow.
What's the hurry?

247
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,440
The Kotak file?

248
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,446
The Kotak file?
l gave it at 4 o'clock.

249
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,482
But you had to give it
to Mr. Malhotra. Go.

250
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:29,847
Kotak will give it to Malhotra.

251
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,283
Kotak will give it... Yes?

252
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,558
- Give the file to Malhotra now.
- l will, right away.

253
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,128
Come with me.

254
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:48,468
He's in a hurry.

255
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,913
l have come to return your kerchief.

256
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,976
Oh yes! l had forgotten. l am crazy!

257
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,913
- That you are.
- What!

258
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,988
l mean, you should remember
that forgetting is a bad habit.

259
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,122
- Where is my kerchief?
- lt's here.

260
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,318
Then give it.

261
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,521
lt's your kerchief. Take it.

262
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,325
l'm sorry, it had fallen.
l'll wash it and return.

263
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,170
- No problem, l'll wash it.
- No.

264
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,170
My mother says that one's character
and kerchief should be immaculate.

265
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,177
- No problem, l'll wash it.
- No, it's my fault.

266
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,744
l have dirtied it. lt becomes
my duty to wash and return it.

267
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,746
Okay.

268
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,085
Anything else?

269
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,694
l'll wash, dry and iron the kerchief
and return it within 2-3 days.

270
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,360
Will you come out with me?

271
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,369
What! What did you say?

272
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,969
Will you come out with me?

273
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,644
So, you want to become a big shot?

274
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,721
Yes, very big.
And l have many dreams too.

275
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,126
Let alone me,...

276
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,387
... everyone walking on this road
wants to reach somewhere, right?

277
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,889
Yes. Do you know
where l want to reach?

278
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,069
Where?

279
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,269
There. Galaxy Tower.

280
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:34,000
Goodness me! lt's said that
each flat here costs Rs. 10 million.

281
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,407
l want a palatial house there.

282
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,682
Assume that you won't
get all this. Then what?

283
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,156
Then l will marry a man
who has all this.

284
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,827
Assume that this won't happen.
But in the midst,...

285
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:56,763
... you fall in love with
a simple, working boy.

286
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:04,434
No, it's impossible. Two weak
people cannot make a successful life.

287
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,447
What's wrong?

288
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:20,116
You are very frank. You spoke
the bare truth so easily.

289
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,722
Rahul, it's no crime
to dream about being happy?

290
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,326
No, certainly not.

291
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,466
Then, will my dream come true?

292
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,132
What's the time?

293
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,466
What's the time in your watch?

294
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,469
- 7.30.
- 7.30. What's the day today?

295
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,073
- Monday.
- lt's a Full Moon night?

296
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,483
Yes!

297
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,385
Whatever you sincerely ask for
on Monday at 7.30,...

298
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,351
...on a Full Moon night,
on this road, will be granted.

299
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,152
Who said so?

300
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,824
Me.

301
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,029
This evening, in the name
of Venus Fashion Show!

302
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,915
They come out of balloons
like they've come from a saloon!

303
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,110
- Shall l give 4 points?
- lt's your wish. Our show is a hit!

304
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,328
Bhushan, they want to take
an interview. Where is Siddarth?

305
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,932
He must be pursuing some models!

306
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,597
How many points do l give?

307
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,863
She wants no points
but a Mercedes car.

308
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,738
Watch, someday, l'll have a row
of Mercedes cars for her.

309
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,065
Hey, when you buy
a Mercedes and...

310
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,407
Rahul, l want this girl.

311
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,874
Me too.

312
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,880
l too was thinking that we should
sign her for our ad campaign soon.

313
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,783
You know that l am not
talking about only work.

314
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,617
How's she?

315
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,786
Why are you looking there?
You know your job.

316
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:28,111
Hey, Johnny, why don't
you understand...

317
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,305
... that for the first time
in life, l have loved a girl?

318
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,310
And my boss had to be an impediment!

319
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:37,849
Hey, fool, what is
your aim in life?

320
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,051
Your agency, your office,
your dream!

321
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,193
Who can fulfil your dream?

322
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,459
Only your boss can, understand?

323
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,658
Just think about what you want.
The girl or the office?

324
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,502
l came to Mumbai with only one dream.

325
00:32:56,174 --> 00:33:01,806
To earn money. To make
an office of my own.

326
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,943
Then go and fulfil your
dream about your office.

327
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,284
Go and tell her that the boss has
signed her for a new advertisement.

328
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,455
Call her for the shooting.

329
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,358
Can't l get both of them?

330
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,700
Get going.

331
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,530
l told you once not to go!
That's final!

332
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,176
l don't want to go inside.
l only want to give a message.

333
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,105
No giving any message to girls
at this hour of the night.

334
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,180
Do l look a masseur to you? l want
to give a message, not a massage.

335
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:44,211
l know what a message is.
All the boys give me a message.

336
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,190
l go in and personally
give the girls the messages.

337
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,925
l have to give so many
messages for the day.

338
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,393
Okay. Now sit down.

339
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,734
- Don't try to talk me into it!
- l won't.

340
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,400
- l can give a message, can't l?
- Yes.

341
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,966
Give me a piece of paper.

342
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,900
Should l give the paper too?

343
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,596
Let it be. l'll find one.

344
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,571
Turn around.

345
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,072
- Suppose you go in, then?
- Hold this.

346
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,315
Hold it.

347
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,280
- Why are you moving?
- l'm getting tickled.

348
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:22,085
Sit straight for a while!
... Just for a minute... lt's over.

349
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,427
Give it to Miss Seema.

350
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,593
What should l tell her
about the sender?

351
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,960
She will understand
when she sees the kerchief.

352
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,601
Oh, l see! This kerchief
is the code word?

353
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,369
lt was the code word.

354
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,438
Here's your dress.

355
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,239
- What's this?
- Your dress.

356
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,249
- Where's the rest?
- This is it.

357
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,143
But l was told that it's an
advertisement for ready-made clothes.

358
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,684
This is the ready-made product.

359
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,621
Today's woman, until yesterday,
would feel coy to wear this.

360
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:57,954
Wear this.

361
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,296
l do not wear such clothes!

362
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,803
When Sona can wear... l'm sorry...
When Sona and Mona can wear it,...

363
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,810
When both of them can
wear it, why can't you?

364
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,412
Aren't they humans?
Don't they have a heart?

365
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,607
- Why don't you understand?
- You don't understand, madam,...

366
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,614
The shorter the clothes,
the greater the success!

367
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,378
l will not wear it!
Call your producer.

368
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:28,986
Madam, l will suffer a loss if
you refuse. l will have to wear it.

369
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,659
l will not listen anymore!
l am leaving!

370
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,833
Wait! You want more money,
don't you? You will get it.

371
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,102
This is not the question
of money! l...

372
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,634
-Who the hell is it?
-What's going on! Stop this nonsense!

373
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,506
Who's talking in the dark?...
Hey, throw the spotlight on him!

374
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,313
Sir, you?

375
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,743
l couldn't identify your voice in
the dark, l mean, l couldn't hear it.

376
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,020
Then listen now!

377
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:03,015
A man who does not respect a woman
in this company, isn't fit to be here!

378
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,029
A woman's body is not something
meant to be exposed!

379
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,722
And you should know that we are
making an ad film, not a blue film!

380
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,729
Blue film!... l have never
seen a blue film, sir!

381
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,273
But a bikini is the
product of our film, sir!

382
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,069
l know.

383
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,341
A product can be changed
but not a model.

384
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,711
Henceforth, learn to respect
the beauty of a woman, understand?

385
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:28,886
Yes.

386
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,884
The film will feature only Seema.

387
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,892
Didn't you hear?

388
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,906
We will not be able to
shoot in this atmosphere.

389
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,078
You ruined your mood
because of me.

390
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,147
No, sir.

391
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,446
l can understand your hesitation.

392
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,761
We will work well tomorrow
in a new mood.

393
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,324
l cannot come tomorrow.

394
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,331
Any special reason?

395
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,097
The reason is a bit personal.

396
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:26,467
No problem. We'll shoot when you
get time off from personal matters.

397
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:29,738
May l leave now?

398
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,280
Listen, Seema.

399
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,547
When you smile, you look very lovely.

400
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:50,233
You acted brilliantly. You spoke
better than how l had asked you to.

401
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,827
- lt was good, wasn't it?
- lt was very good, boss.

402
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,564
Assume that 90% of your job is done.

403
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,835
Forget the performance, but what
could this personal matter be?

404
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,246
ls she involved...

405
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,517
Look, it's written
in this bio-data...

406
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,845
... that it's her birthday tomorrow
on the 25th.

407
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,158
Yes! Now, plan number two.

408
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,986
Boss, l have such
a fantastic idea that...

409
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:20,659
Can l have some money?

410
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,332
ln this pocket, boss.

411
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,334
Let it be. l'll return the rest.

412
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,279
The flower's are beautiful!

413
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,025
And look at this!

414
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,885
Rahul! What's all this?

415
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,693
Mr. Siddarth has sent you
all these flowers.

416
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,766
But how did he know
that it's my birthday?

417
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,369
Mr. Siddarth finds out all the
details about a person he likes.

418
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,905
And yes! He's sent you a message too.

419
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,047
Look.

420
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:14,914
From here to there and everywhere,
you are all l see, Seema.

421
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,448
- Has he written this?
- l have.

422
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,217
l'm joking.

423
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:25,392
Actually in some corner of the heart
of Mr. Siddarth, the businessman,...

424
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,722
... lies a hidden poet too.

425
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,794
Seema, here's a little flower
on my behalf.

426
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,729
There's a call for you.
Mr. Siddarth is on the line.

427
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,662
Mr. Siddarth's phone!

428
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,413
-lt's Mr.Siddarth's phone for you.
-Hold this.

429
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,034
For you.

430
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,375
You are very shrewd, sir.

431
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,515
You send a message to one person
and take a kiss from someone else!

432
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,226
Hats off to you, sir! One should
learn from you how to win over a girl!

433
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,637
No, Shukla. The matter is
slightly complicated this time.

434
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,104
She is a middle class girl.

435
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,970
What are you saying! You know
that the girl is ambitious.

436
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,744
She wants to earn name and fame.

437
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,249
And who else but me
can fulfil this dream of hers?

438
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,856
l am leaving. l have a meeting
with her in half an hour's time.

439
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:49,592
lt isn't luck. You have to
work hard to acquire this.

440
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,260
What's wrong?

441
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,070
Summon everybody from all
departments to the conference hall.

442
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:58,932
l want to hold an urgent meeting.

443
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,268
Sir, now?

444
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,740
- Sir, l had some appointments.
- Then cancel them.

445
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,479
The big boss does not attend
office daily. Right, uncle?

446
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,112
Okay. l'll arrange everything
and return. Please sit.

447
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,425
Look,...

448
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,153
Hurry! Uncle has no time!

449
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,626
- Bhushan.
- Yes?

450
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,304
l'm here!

451
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,139
You?

452
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,570
What are you doing here?

453
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,313
Job, madam. Livelihood...

454
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,582
- Where is Siddarth?
- He is doing his duty elsewhere.

455
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,588
And he has sent me to abide my
duty with a beauty like you.

456
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,986
Can you tell me when he will come?

457
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,329
He must be on his way.
Until then, l'm here.

458
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,725
Don't worsen my mood.
As it is, l am very...

459
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:01,003
Angry. Yes, you are angry!

460
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:04,000
l realise that you are angry.
Okay, l won't worsen your mood.

461
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,740
l'll settle my accounts, okay?

462
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,341
lf a man keeps a daily account,
then a lot of money can be saved.

463
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,740
Popcorn for Rs. 100,
Rs. 400 for petrol,...

464
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,880
... Rs. 200 for flowers...

465
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,345
- Just a minute!
- Rs. 250...

466
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,349
- Rs. 200 for flowers?
- Yes.

467
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,190
- For these rotten flowers?
- Yes.

468
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,188
You are royally looting your boss!

469
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,368
l have the rate card for all these,
and my prices are fixed.

470
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:34,169
Look at my rate card.
Rs. 200 for flowers...

471
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,373
... Rs. 100 for roaming with
the girl for half an hour.

472
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:40,236
Rs. 10 for holding her hand and
Rs. 100 for flattering her beauty.

473
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:45,780
And if the bill for all this mounts
to Rs.500, then she gets a kiss free.

474
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,248
Should l give it to you now
or should l wrap it?

475
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,387
l don't want your disgusting service!

476
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,124
No problem. l have a complaint book
too where you can pen your complaints.

477
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,855
l'm leaving! There is
no need! Keep sitting here!

478
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,798
Hey, wait! Listen!

479
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,399
Tell him that l left!

480
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,168
And Rs. 1000 for singing
a song with the girl.

481
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,873
Listen to me. l know
that it is my fault.

482
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:49,208
lt isn't so. Rahul's company
is fine to share a laugh or two.

483
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,515
But l was waiting for you.

484
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,449
Will you do the same
even after marriage?

485
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,489
Marriage? Yes... l mean, no!

486
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:05,296
l mean that you will never get
a chance to complain after today.

487
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,307
- You're listening, aren't you?
- Yes, l am. Go on.

488
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,034
Only you will come tomorrow, right?

489
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,711
Only l will come for the meeting
tomorrow. l won't send Rahul.

490
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,716
Listen, before keeping
the receiver down, won't you...

491
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,585
Before keeping the receiver down,
won't you say something?

492
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,314
- What?
- Anything.

493
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,992
Why not? Who else
will l tell if not you?

494
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:50,076
The phone got cut. Mumbai's rains
and telephones are unpredictable!

495
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:51,739
Never know when they let you down!

496
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,946
Just like you.

497
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,553
Like me?... lmplying?

498
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:01,088
l appear beautiful to you, don't l?

499
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,760
Of course! You look very beautiful!

500
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:09,158
Remember one thing. Whatever you
are today, is because of me.

501
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,560
The day these eyes covet
someone else other than me,...

502
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,964
... then you know
its consequence, don't you?

503
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:20,235
Why are you speaking like this?
Don't you trust me?... Me?

504
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,377
Come closer. Come on!

505
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,380
Please stop the car
here for a minute.

506
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,787
- Why here?
- l want to do a little shopping.

507
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,447
- What do you want to shop here?
- l want to buy a gift for Susie.

508
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,388
- You can shop tomorrow.
- No, it's her birthday tomorrow.

509
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,960
l won't get time then. Please.

510
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,524
- Come soon.
- l'll be back in a jiffy.

511
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,469
Yes. l too liked it.

512
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,802
Carry on. l'll be back soon.

513
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,547
Seema is with me. l think,
my work will be done today.

514
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:04,480
Not 3 o'clock. Make it 8 o'clock.
l'll be there at the dot of 8.

515
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,289
-What are you doing here?
-l was shopping here with my friends.

516
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:15,156
- What are you doing here?
- Even l came here to shop.

517
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,830
Shopping? With whom?

518
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:20,166
With... what's his name?... Rahul.

519
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:21,836
Oh Rahul? l see.

520
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:27,037
l'll leave. Come home soon.
You have been coming late these days.

521
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,010
l'll come home at the dot of 8
and we'll also dine out today, okay?

522
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,384
Okay.

523
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,739
Look, what l've got
for you. Cuff-links.

524
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,376
Are they nice? Do you like them?

525
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,671
They are nice but what was the need?

526
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,876
Why not? lt's...

527
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,750
Aren't you getting late now?
Come on, let's go.

528
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:17,485
Just a minute, Seema.
... Meet her. She is my wife.

529
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,557
Darling, she is Seema.

530
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,269
You said that you have
come with Rahul.

531
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:32,568
Yes, l have come with Rahul.
She is Rahul's wife.

532
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:33,809
What!

533
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,912
Rahul's wife?
When did Rahul get married?

534
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:42,915
Darling, he got married
and didn't even inform us!

535
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,812
They have even had a fight
within two days of their marriage.

536
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,682
l am trying to patch them up.

537
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,801
Where is Rahul?... He must
be shopping inside.

538
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,403
Really?

539
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,766
Darling, 8 o'clock. Dinner.

540
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,816
- Seema, listen to me.
- Don't touch me!

541
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:33,764
But, boss, why did you tell
Mrs. Sheela that Seema is my wife?

542
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,370
Because of this,...

543
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,701
What could l do, Rahul? Sheela got
suspicious of me a day earlier.

544
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:42,378
She threatened me.

545
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:47,780
And when she suddenly stood before
me,... l couldn't think of anything.

546
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,981
l said whatever came to my mind.

547
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:54,721
l accidentally took your
name, Rahul. What do l do now?

548
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:59,452
Because of the
blunder you have made,...

549
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,722
Please listen to me.
Go and explain to Seema.

550
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,791
Explain to her. Ask her
to meet me just once.

551
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,667
l'll handle the rest.

552
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,274
l can do anything for you, boss.

553
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:18,003
But your wife, Seema,...
please keep me out of this mess.

554
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:25,844
Mess? You can't
do it, right? Don't!

555
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:31,182
You were right. l ought
to tell Sheela the truth.

556
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:35,031
l will tell her everything.
What will happen?

557
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,197
At the most, what will happen?!

558
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:41,560
What will happen? My honour
will be at stake, right?!

559
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,296
Boss, what are you doing?

560
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,703
So be it! Let everything
be destroyed!

561
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,040
This business will come to an end,
and so will this life, right?

562
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:55,214
The luxuries will cease to exist and
this office will be finished, right?

563
00:55:55,485 --> 00:56:00,445
So be it! Let it be destroyed!
l don't want anything!

564
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,583
l'll be left nowhere, right?!

565
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:08,064
l shall break everything!
Everything, Rahul!

566
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,067
And this dream of yours!

567
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:15,801
This ad agency! The dream
which we had seen together.

568
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,073
When everything is being finished,
then let it perish too!

569
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,678
Why do l need it? l will break it!
Let it be finished!

570
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,081
No, boss! No!

571
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,750
- Move aside! l'll break it!
- No, boss!

572
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,752
Rahul, move aside! l am
really enraged! Move aside!

573
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,889
No, boss! l will not let you do this!

574
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:40,824
Please don't be furious.
Let go of this. l'm here.

575
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:45,261
l'm here. Relax.
Sit down. Don't get worried.

576
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:47,500
l'm here. l will talk to Seema.

577
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,699
l will talk to Seema.
Don't be furious.

578
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,710
- Do you want some money?
- No, boss, l don't.

579
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,382
Keep this. l'll go to Seema...

580
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,120
Unnecessarily...

581
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:32,605
Hats off to you! Terrific!

582
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:36,880
You saw that this
formula always works.

583
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:42,147
ln this world, if you speak the
truth softly, then none will heed you.

584
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:47,994
And if you scream and shout
a lie, then everybody listens!

585
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,636
l don't want to meet him!
l don't!!

586
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:56,699
And you have also cheated me, Rahul!

587
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,776
How much money had Mr. Siddarth
given you to keep shut?

588
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,909
No, Seema, it certainly isn't so.

589
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,978
Well, Mr. Siddarth...

590
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:12,721
Mr. Siddarth! Mr.Siddarth!!
Don't mention his name!

591
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,453
Seema, just listen to me once.

592
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,326
Rahul, go away! l say, go away!

593
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,592
- l will leave...
- l don't want to listen to anything!

594
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:38,009
- Fine, l'll go.
- No. You are hurt.

595
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:42,014
No... l'll leave.

596
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,386
No, Rahul. lt's bleeding.
Please wait for a while.

597
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:53,627
l was unable to stop myself.

598
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:02,398
Seema, l can understand
what you are going through.

599
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,774
Actually, l may have also done
the same, had l been in your place.

600
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:15,081
But why did this happen to me?

601
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:20,416
lt will be better if you
meet Mr. Siddarth just once.

602
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,853
Why should l meet him? Why?!

603
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,060
To hear another lie?

604
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:37,098
Seema, everything in life is
not just either the truth or a lie.

605
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,106
All of us have some drawbacks.

606
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,607
Which at times, compels us
to do something...

607
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,950
... that hurts somebody or the other.

608
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:57,960
All of us are incomplete.

609
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:06,132
l only wish to say,
meet Mr. Siddarth once.

610
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,304
Give him a chance to explain.

611
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:14,641
After that,... adhere to
whatever decision you make.

612
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,493
- But listen...
- l don't want to listen to anything!

613
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,921
- You have cheated me!
- l have not!

614
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:39,490
You have not cheated me? Why didn't
you tell me that you were married?

615
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:45,000
lf l were to tell you that l was
married, would you have loved me?

616
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,842
No! Never!

617
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,343
Did you see? This is why
l never told you!

618
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,179
Because, Seema, l do not
want to lose you at any cost.

619
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,016
l cannot live without you!

620
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,351
No! Siddarth, you have
misunderstood me.

621
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,057
Will l settle down by
breaking somebody else's home?

622
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,018
Never! This is a sin!

623
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,358
No, Seema. This is not a sin.

624
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,965
How can you break
my already shattered home?

625
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,164
Yes! My marriage to Sheela was
a big mistake! lt was my fault!

626
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,769
But l am soon going to divorce her.

627
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:22,374
- Yes, this is the truth.
- lt's a lie! Another lie!

628
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,372
Look into my eyes!

629
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,907
Can't you see the truth
in them? Answer me, Seema.

630
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,220
No.

631
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,182
- Come with me.
- Where have you brought me?

632
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:37,257
You want to know the truth,
don't you? That is the truth!

633
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:41,386
Do you see that woman?
That is Sheela, my wife.

634
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:46,399
And can you see that man there who's
walking with his chest jutting out?

635
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,870
He is my wife's paramour!

636
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,902
This is the truth
about my married life!

637
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,410
Look at what's happening there!

638
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,412
See for yourself, Seema.

639
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,947
l cannot bear it
any longer. l'll go crazy!

640
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,588
Let's go from here. Please!

641
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,589
- Who are you?
- Aren't you Dolly?

642
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:15,764
No.

643
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:22,699
Foolish man!

644
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,442
- How was it?
- You are right, sir!

645
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,978
lf you yet consider
my marriage to be valid,...

646
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:37,180
... and our love to be
a sin, then it's okay!

647
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:40,854
l'll accept whatever
decision you make.

648
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,285
But l will only
love you all my life.

649
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,858
l can't understand anything.
What's the problem now?

650
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:54,860
Susie, he is married.

651
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:59,965
His home is broken. You have seen
it for yourself, haven't you? Then?

652
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,875
Yes, but...

653
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,477
Seema, he loves you.

654
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:11,342
What is he asking you for?
Only a few days time.

655
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,348
So that he can divorce
his wife. That's all!

656
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:22,493
Had l been in your place, l would
have given him another chance.

657
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,134
Yes.

658
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,174
You sent Seema to
your boss, didn't you?

659
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:46,085
You knew that he'd explain to her
and convince her with his talks.

660
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,855
But you weren't ashamed!

661
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,857
l was deeply ashamed.

662
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:57,688
But how could you be? You want
money, your commission and the office!

663
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,698
And then, you have to even
get mother operated, right?

664
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:06,705
But what about Seema?

665
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:12,537
What about Seema? What about her?!

666
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:17,542
She also wanted to make it big,
earn money, drive a Mercedes...

667
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,881
... so what could l do?

668
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:23,554
And look, l'll tell you too.

669
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,721
You also quietly keep saying...

670
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:47,572
l cannot fathom how an ambitious
girl like Seema got married to Rahul.

671
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:53,421
Yes!... l too was
surprised. But love...

672
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:57,084
Darling, you know that a person
can do anything in love.

673
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,858
l think, we should
give them a wedding gift.

674
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:10,801
l'll send someone to their house
tomorrow itself with a nice gift.

675
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,441
No! We will personally go
and give them a gift.

676
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,404
We, go to their house?...
Darling, will we go to their house?

677
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,378
Why? ls there a problem?

678
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:23,619
No, there's no problem...

679
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,621
Then we will go to
their house tomorrow itself.

680
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:28,624
Okay.

681
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:35,228
What! No, Siddarth!
What kind of a joke is this!

682
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:39,897
To appease your wife,... we'll
have to pretend to be man and wife?!

683
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:43,798
Try to understand.
lt's a matter of just a day.

684
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,367
Siddarth, it's not
the question of days.

685
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,803
How many lies to hide one truth?!

686
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,642
Seema, l have
already promised my wife.

687
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,814
Why don't you tell Mrs. Sheela
that we have gone for our honeymoon?

688
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,062
Seema, what do you want? That my
wife always be suspicious of me?

689
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:11,665
Yes, l did make a mistake.
What do l do now?

690
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,332
Go to the gallows?! Shoot myself?!

691
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,676
l mean, yes, you are
absolutely right.

692
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:25,807
Why should you shoot yourself, boss?
Just tell us what we have to do.

693
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:29,014
Seema, you don't
have to do anything.

694
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,853
Sheela and l will
come home for dinner.

695
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:33,689
Yes.

696
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,356
And we will give
the two of you, a small gift.

697
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,559
Small gift?

698
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:43,489
Both of you have to only pretend
to be a happy family. Nothing more.

699
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:44,700
Understand?

700
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,526
- There is one problem.
- What is it now?

701
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:51,298
My house does not appear a
married couple's home from any angle.

702
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,872
Go and do up your house!

703
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:57,568
Yes. But for a house to look like
a married couple's home,...

704
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:58,907
... there should be a double bed.

705
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,877
Rahul! This is no time to joke!

706
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,882
No... excuse me...
Seema, l am not joking.

707
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,112
These things are needed.
Boss, l think,...

708
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,985
... l'll also buy sofas, curtains,
bedsheets and a washing machine.

709
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,125
- Fine.
- As you wish.

710
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,120
One minute... l want to
talk to Seema alone.

711
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,063
l feel very odd doing all this.

712
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,994
But what do l do?
lt's the question of our future.

713
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:24,306
lt's a matter of only 2 hours.
For the first and last time. Please!

714
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,608
Yes, boss. l'm here. l think,
even the painting of the house...

715
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,144
- You are...
- Let it be.

716
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,615
Seema, go with Rahul.
... Hurry, Rahul.

717
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:35,751
Hurry!

718
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,503
How did you like my house?

719
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:02,778
lt's nice.

720
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:08,243
l always tell Siddarth that you're
a very honest and hard working boy.

721
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,384
Since childhood.

722
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,253
- But l dislike one habit of yours.
- What's that, madam?

723
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:15,290
- You are very discreet.
- Meaning?

724
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,391
You got married and we
didn't even know!

725
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:20,126
Even l didn't know!

726
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:21,963
What!

727
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:26,795
l mean, it all happened so fast
... without any fanfare.

728
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:29,971
You have done up your
small house quite well.

729
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,063
That too, in such a short time.

730
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,670
Meaning?

731
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,409
Did you see that painting?

732
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,345
Seema has painted a replica.
She does all this.

733
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,717
Fool!

734
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:44,615
- Does Seema paint too?
- Yes.

735
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,322
- She's painted the whole house too.
- She's painted?

736
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,656
Where is your Seema?

737
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:58,633
She's getting ready. l'll fetch
her. You watch the painting.

738
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,249
ls my attire okay?

739
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:23,257
l am feeling very strange.
... Will everything be okay?

740
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,130
Everything will be okay.

741
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,337
Do l look all right?

742
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:41,274
You look very beautiful
in these wifely clothes.

743
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:47,280
A typical lndian wife.

744
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,883
- No.
- Yes. l'm speaking the truth.

745
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,631
Boss, you aren't eating anything.

746
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:11,703
Please pass me the curd dish.

747
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:15,502
Eat everything you want.
lt's all yours!

748
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,505
Where did you go for your honeymoon?

749
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,910
We went for our honeymoon
... where did we go?

750
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,651
W...where did we go, boss?

751
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:35,089
Both of you went for a honeymoon.
How would l know?

752
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:36,594
Of course, it was our honeymoon.

753
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:39,333
l really wanted to go but boss
held me back due to some work.

754
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,736
Anyway, what would we have done?

755
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:47,943
What!

756
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:52,414
l mean, what would Seema have
done all alone?... Right, Seema?

757
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,115
Seema, will you quit modelling
after marriage?

758
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:08,759
Why should she quit? She will
continue modelling... Right, boss?

759
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,360
Yes, she will continue modelling.
Why should she quit?

760
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:16,805
The boss' word is final.
Discussion over!

761
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,167
- Why don't you eat something?
- No, there's too much oil in this.

762
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:21,433
Anyway, we have to
go for another party.

763
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:23,706
Nowadays, you have
to be figure conscious.

764
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:24,980
Yes.

765
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,842
Have some. There's no oil in this.

766
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:33,651
Mrs. Sheela is right.

767
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:36,321
Anyway, beautiful women
should maintain their figures.

768
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,589
By the way, why don't you model?

769
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:44,722
Ask Siddarth.

770
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,592
Boss is very fond of models.

771
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,670
What's wrong, boss?

772
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,601
- l'll get some sweets.
- Yes. l'll give boss some water.

773
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,534
Have some water.

774
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,014
Excuse me, she's newly married.
l'll go and help her.

775
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,017
l'm here.

776
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,351
What's wrong, darling? We'll leave
as soon as they come.

777
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:11,348
Why don't you eat something?

778
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,761
Above that, you also said that
we have to go for another party.

779
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,864
You had said that we'd leave early!

780
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:23,038
Enough, Sheela! Stop it!
Now, don't fight with me!

781
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:24,836
l think, they are having a tiff.

782
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,433
Sheela, sit down! Listen to me!

783
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:31,371
Hey, you're leaving?
At least, have some sweets.

784
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,374
No, let it be. We'll leave.

785
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:35,650
l'll have it packed!

786
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:39,917
Darling, what about the gift
we had brought for them?

787
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:44,219
Oh yes! This is a wedding gift
for both of you on our behalf.

788
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,887
- What was the need for this?
- Yes, what was the need?

789
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:49,860
Of course, there was.
We too have a right.

790
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:52,590
- Yes, you do, boss.
- Let's leave?

791
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,325
What a lovely couple they make!

792
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:56,901
l'm very angry with you!

793
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:58,603
Why? What now?

794
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:02,077
lt's so wrong. You started a
fight with me in front of them.

795
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:05,209
What must they be thinking?
That we don't get along.

796
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,473
No, it's nothing like that.

797
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:13,088
The things one has to do for a
livelihood! You too acted very well!

798
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,960
Hey, you're crying!

799
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:24,823
lf l have erred, then...

800
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:30,503
No! There is no need
for you to say sorry.

801
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,103
l am very upset with myself.

802
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:39,705
Who am l deceiving?

803
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:42,984
Myself?

804
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:47,716
What will l gain?...
These lies? This pretense?

805
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,523
Why did l do all this?

806
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,791
Despite being a woman, l staged
a charade of being married!

807
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,466
lt's so cheap!

808
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,467
l have stooped so low!

809
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,873
This was not my dream, Rahul.

810
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,153
Seema, why are you asking
yourself so many questions? Why?

811
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:22,619
Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

812
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:28,730
Don't cry.

813
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:30,826
Shall l tell you something?

814
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:35,562
l have not been able to understand
many questions in my own life.

815
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:41,436
But l have realised one thing.
That you are a very nice girl.

816
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:46,347
And good people always get the best.

817
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:27,309
Spray this on the moon,
and even its spots will disappear!

818
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:42,256
Hey, where are you going?
Are you very busy?

819
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,995
No. l was going to keep this there.

820
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,732
Angry with your wife?

821
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:49,604
l had forgotten.

822
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:56,406
This is the first time that a girl
is not coming into my clutches.

823
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,474
You are making such a big ad film
and spending so extravagantly.

824
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:04,611
l say, why don't you take her
for an outdoor shooting?

825
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,617
She will be in front
of your eyes for 24 hours.

826
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,023
Sir, your work will be done.

827
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,891
All of us are going for an outdoor
shooting. Make preparations for it.

828
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:23,636
We are going to Switzerland
by tomorrow morning's flight.

829
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:26,101
But all this, so suddenly?

830
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,433
Yes. l spoke to the party just now.

831
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:30,811
Come on! There's very little
time and a lot of work!

832
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:44,253
l thought, it's a joyous occasion.
So why not celebrate in a good place?

833
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:45,493
Sit.

834
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:47,184
Joyous occasion? What is it?

835
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:51,926
Darling, Advocate Shukla has
given my divorce papers to the Court.

836
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,667
l've told her.

837
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,140
lt's a question of 3-4 months.
Then l will be free!

838
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:09,684
What's it?

839
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,847
lt's too much, Johnny!

840
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:17,020
l don't know why l'm hiding
all this from Seema.

841
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:20,323
Have you really become serious,
in the course of pretending?

842
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:24,695
Look at how happy she is!

843
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:27,700
Can you give her all this?

844
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:29,495
Can you?

845
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:31,867
She does not want only love.

846
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,836
She wants the love of a rich man
like Mr. Siddarth, understand?

847
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:37,442
You don't know Mr. Siddarth.

848
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:40,715
You don't know why
Mr. Siddarth is taking her.

849
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:44,214
And even though you know, what
can you do? What can you do?!

850
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,718
Just think about your agency!

851
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:52,156
What is your status? You are a joker!

852
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,190
You can liven up the lives
of these affluent people.

853
01:23:57,232 --> 01:24:00,895
But without them, you alone have
no value. Understand? No value!

854
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,748
- Hey, Johnny.
- Yes?

855
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:17,141
Mrs. Sheela is not coming with us
for the outdoor shooting, is she?

856
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,617
From where did
Mrs. Sheela enter the picture?

857
01:24:19,788 --> 01:24:21,016
Look there.

858
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,029
Why won't Mrs. Sheela come?

859
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:30,761
lf she is invited,
she will surely come.

860
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:34,431
But why will she be invited?
lt's an outdoor shooting.

861
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:35,569
Yes, it is.

862
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,635
- The boss is alone.
- Yes, he is.

863
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:39,501
With him will be beautiful models!

864
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:42,108
Yes. Why will he invite her if
there are beautiful models with him?

865
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:43,767
- He won't.
- He won't!

866
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,183
- He's gone.
- Yes.

867
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:52,785
- Did he hear?
- He must have heard.

868
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:56,450
You were calling me a joker,
weren't you? Now watch!

869
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:00,256
lf a joker can
liven people's lives,...

870
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:04,198
... then he can ruin lives too!

871
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:18,672
Ask him to give me
a room facing the sea.

872
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:22,817
There is no sea
in Switzerland, sir.

873
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:27,052
There isn't? Okay, but
you can at least try!

874
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:30,154
You straightaway refuse. No wonder,
all of you are so backward!

875
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,224
How far is Hollywood from here?

876
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:36,328
l'm not asking about Mumbai's
Film City, but about Hollywood.

877
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:38,658
Your room number is 503.

878
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:41,359
Listen, how far is
Hollywood from here?

879
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,428
lt's next to your room.

880
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:46,704
- Next to my room?
- ln fact, it's in your room.

881
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:18,066
They are in adjoining rooms.

882
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:19,734
Problem!

883
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:27,004
- Who's it?
- Your admirer.

884
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:32,042
What does my admirer want
at this hour?

885
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:36,550
He wants to come inside
at this hour. Open this door.

886
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:42,059
No, not now. Certainly
not now at this hour.

887
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:45,098
Please open. l know that
you will open the door.

888
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:48,229
All right, l'll count
till five, okay?

889
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:53,237
One... Two...

890
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:56,773
Three... Four....

891
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:02,644
Oh? You are coming from
the main door? No problem!

892
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,921
Coming! l'm coming!

893
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:17,796
- You here?
- Saw how l caught you!

894
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:21,127
Caught? What have you caught?
What are you saying?

895
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:23,102
Aren't you happy to see me here?

896
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:28,201
Happy?... Yes, l am very happy.
... This... This is for you.

897
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:29,310
Take it.

898
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:33,277
Now, quickly thank Bhushan.

899
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:35,609
Why Bhushan?

900
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:39,943
lt was Bhushan's idea that l come
here and give you a surprise.

901
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:42,083
Oh, it was Bhushan's idea?

902
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,295
l take care of you, or Siddarth....

903
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:52,956
What are you saying? Go from here.

904
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:54,965
Darling, come in.

905
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,705
Your timing is superb!

906
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:06,380
Meaning?

907
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:09,641
We were at the office and
suddenly it was decided...

908
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:11,419
... that we have to
make a very big film.

909
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:13,819
We have to go outdoors to
Switzerland. But you were in Delhi.

910
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:17,152
So l could not inform you.
But it's very good that you came.

911
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,594
- lt's a very beautiful place!
- lt is, isn't it?

912
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:23,493
We should have come here
for our honeymoon.

913
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:26,730
Of course, we should have.

914
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:29,199
Oh, by the way, where is
the honeymoon couple?

915
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:32,272
- Which honeymoon couple?
- Rahul and Seema.

916
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,608
Rahul and Seema?...
Oh, our Rahul and Seema?

917
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:38,207
- They must be in their room.
- Let's go to their room.

918
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:41,173
Yes. Let's meet them.
... No, just a minute.

919
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,018
You have come from such a
long journey. You look very tired.

920
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:48,488
- Two minutes.
- Okay.

921
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:51,484
Not there... What are you doing?

922
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:54,890
- l'm going to the bathroom.
- Darling, the bathroom's over there.

923
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,038
Rahul, save my skin!

924
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:11,568
Mind your leg!

925
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:15,614
Come on! Come on, Rahul!
Pick up the phone!

926
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,086
Hey, the phone is ringing.

927
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:19,451
Let it!

928
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:24,653
Why isn't he picking up the phone?
Hey, pick it up!

929
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:26,555
l'll pick it up.
Why are you shouting?

930
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:31,531
Yes, boss, indeed!
Why did you take so long?

931
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:36,069
-We were settling the accounts.
-Okay! Explain later. Sheela's here.

932
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,535
- Here, boss?
- Yes, here!

933
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:41,268
She wants to meet
Seema and you right now.

934
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,738
Come to Seema's room with
all your luggage. lmmediately!

935
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:48,879
No, boss. The state we are in...
We can't come now. l...

936
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:53,079
l don't want to hear anything! Come
to Seema's room in the state you are.

937
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:54,688
Now!

938
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:09,962
Come on! Once you come out,
you don't get scared.

939
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,813
- What's it?
- Do l look okay?

940
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:05,955
Hi. l'm here.

941
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:08,685
You? And that too,
only in a towel?

942
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:12,695
l couldn't come wearing only
an underwear, could l?

943
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:14,327
That's also a point.

944
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:17,164
Don't you have any shame?
You're standing before me in a towel!

945
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:18,572
Go away!

946
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:20,774
l'm leaving. Here's the baggage.

947
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:24,437
- You've even brought the baggage!
- lt's not mine, it's his.

948
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:27,181
- l'm leaving.
- No! Where are you going?

949
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:31,507
What's happening?
l'll call the manager.

950
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:34,177
Don't call the manager. We have
to manage everything now.

951
01:31:34,388 --> 01:31:37,687
Mrs. Sheela is here and she
wants to meet us right away.

952
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:39,018
- What?
- Yes.

953
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:42,658
- This is the room.
- Hey, it's just next door!

954
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:50,869
Rahul's there! Come in, darling.

955
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,077
Hello, madam.

956
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,215
Amazing! You're still in bed?

957
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:09,690
Boss didn't schedule any shooting
since morning. So l...l mean,...

958
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,087
... we thought of making the most
of this opportunity. Right, darling?

959
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:16,890
Sure!

960
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:21,226
l'm sorry, l cannot get up
and welcome you. l mean...

961
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:22,629
Why? What's wrong?

962
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:23,963
l'm naked.

963
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:27,073
Have you worn anything? No?

964
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:28,242
That's okay.

965
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:32,246
No problem, we'll meet later...
Let's go?

966
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:36,375
l have some urgent work
with you. Come immediately.

967
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:37,982
Yes, l will. Carry on.

968
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:48,825
l'm sorry, l can't get up and
welcome you. l mean, l'm naked.

969
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:49,930
Yes, l am.

970
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,065
Stupid! Couldn't you
have said something else?

971
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,268
What could l say? l said
whatever l thought of then!

972
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:57,860
Get out of the bed! l say get out!

973
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:01,501
Why have you worn my nightie?

974
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:05,479
You kept shouting, l was shameless
and should change. So, here l am!

975
01:33:06,047 --> 01:33:07,810
By the way, how do l look in this?

976
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,409
- Absolutely stupid!
- Then should l remove it?

977
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,677
No!

978
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:19,126
We need such a location...

979
01:33:19,327 --> 01:33:22,990
... from where we can get
a beautiful view from any angle.

980
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:26,125
What a beauty! What a figure!

981
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:33,432
Would you work for an
advertising film with me?

982
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,903
- Me?
- She is our madam!

983
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:38,475
So, when did l say that she
is my wife?... What a figure!

984
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:40,473
Will you come to lndia with me?

985
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:42,578
Sir, she's Mr. Siddarth's wife.

986
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:45,919
Madam?

987
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:47,654
Madam!

988
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:51,052
- Who is he?
- He is Madhav Advani.

989
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:52,553
He's the director of our company.

990
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:57,497
- That, you do look!
- No, he is!

991
01:33:58,032 --> 01:34:00,057
l apologise on his behalf.

992
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,535
Looking at you, he...

993
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:05,330
l remembered my mummy.

994
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:10,538
ln her youth, she used to also wear
a swimming costume like this and swim.

995
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:13,480
Let's go.

996
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:18,011
The audio of the TV too is spoilt!

997
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:21,154
Neither the hero nor the heroine are
talking. l'll speak for both of them.

998
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:22,954
Hello, Rita. How are you?

999
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:26,087
Raju, l have become
a fish in your love.

1000
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,353
No, don't become a fish.
l cannot swim.

1001
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:31,221
But l have already become
a fish. Please learn to swim.

1002
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:33,765
Rahul... Girls don't
say such dialogues.

1003
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:36,368
Really? How else do they speak?
lf you know, then go ahead.

1004
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:38,362
- l'll say it better than you.
- Let's see.

1005
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:41,370
l'll say the boy's dialogue,
you, the girl's. Speak.

1006
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:44,173
l've been waiting
for you since Friday.

1007
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:46,380
What do l do?
My clock stopped working.

1008
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:49,375
One should learn to
make excuses from you!

1009
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,653
l'm not making excuses. l want the
evening to come to a standstill.

1010
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,380
The time to cease existing.

1011
01:34:54,755 --> 01:34:56,586
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

1012
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:58,391
Where will we get
such a chance again?

1013
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:03,059
Enough now, darling.

1014
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:06,195
No, just a little more.
lt's such great fun!

1015
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,397
Yes, it is fun but...

1016
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,800
Look, if both of us are enjoying...

1017
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:12,802
- What's happening inside?
- They are married.

1018
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:16,239
One moment, l'll go inside.

1019
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,537
Hey, they have come for their
honeymoon. What are you doing?

1020
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,203
They have come for a honeymoon!
What about the shooting then?

1021
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:22,679
- Shooting will go on!
- Hey, it's at 7 in the morning!

1022
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:31,153
- Don't do all this now!
- lf it's happening...

1023
01:35:31,325 --> 01:35:32,758
... then don't control
yourself. Go on.

1024
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:35,262
Go on.

1025
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:38,091
Go on, indeed! l'll...

1026
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:40,290
Listen, you can hear
their voices in here!

1027
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:42,663
Even l can hear! l am not deaf!

1028
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,098
Now what?

1029
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:49,239
Your intoxicating eyes, your pointed
nose, luscious lips, your long neck...

1030
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,908
Something's happening to me,
listening to them.

1031
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:57,680
A lot is happening to me!

1032
01:35:58,552 --> 01:36:00,713
Really?... Really?

1033
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:05,181
After many days, something's
happening to you today. Sit down.

1034
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:07,921
Place your feet up.

1035
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,458
- Don't go anywhere.
- Okay.

1036
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,465
l'll be back soon... close your eyes!

1037
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:20,470
Don't change your mood.

1038
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:28,743
lt was fun, right?

1039
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:33,350
- Seema, are you all right?
- Yes.

1040
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:35,985
What was happening?

1041
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:38,492
Nothing. We were watching TV.

1042
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,397
Were you watching TV?

1043
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:48,760
- Then watch.
- Okay, boss.

1044
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:50,771
Watch.

1045
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:59,844
Strange man! First, he was worried
due to his wife, now due to the TV!

1046
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:03,910
Don't know!!... Do you know
anything or not?!

1047
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:06,114
You want proof, right?

1048
01:37:06,554 --> 01:37:09,318
Do not go out with Siddarth today.

1049
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:13,527
He will not give up his habit
and we will catch him red-handed.

1050
01:37:14,094 --> 01:37:17,188
-What are you saying, Bhushan?
-Siddarth's involved with the models.

1051
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:19,533
- But...
- After all, l am your relative.

1052
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,392
- Your elder brother.
- But...

1053
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:23,196
l know. l know it all.

1054
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:25,531
What do you know?

1055
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:29,376
Nothing.

1056
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:35,272
Do you ever know anything?
Look at your face!

1057
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:41,418
l won't be able to
come out with you today.

1058
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:44,356
- Why?
- l am not feeling too well.

1059
01:37:44,592 --> 01:37:46,560
- What's wrong?
- Her head is aching.

1060
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:48,961
- Head is aching?
- She has fever too.

1061
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:52,962
You have fever too? Can l do
anything for you? Fetch a doctor?

1062
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:58,894
Okay. l had to wind up
a meeting today.

1063
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:15,182
Today, you...

1064
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:18,023
Are you going out somewhere?

1065
01:38:18,959 --> 01:38:21,257
Yes. Siddarth suddenly phoned me.

1066
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:23,259
We are going sightseeing.

1067
01:38:25,099 --> 01:38:28,068
lt's a very nice city.
Mr. Siddarth must be coming?

1068
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:29,933
ln a while.

1069
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:31,938
- l'll leave.
- Where?

1070
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:36,610
- l have to make a phone call.
- To whom, Rahul?

1071
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:37,936
No...

1072
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:42,946
- l have to phone my mother.
- Phone later. Sit.

1073
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:44,447
Talk to me.

1074
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:46,876
l am missing my mother a lot.

1075
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:57,626
- How are you?
- l'm fine. Who are you?

1076
01:38:57,865 --> 01:39:00,356
l am Yakub...Yu..Yunus... Yusuf...

1077
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:05,831
l'm Aapus Aamwala. l have a
flourishing business of mangoes.

1078
01:39:07,174 --> 01:39:09,438
l want you to make a good ad film.

1079
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:13,636
A film which a layman will watch
and then buy my mangoes,...

1080
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:15,974
... thereby resulting in my income
being more than the common man!

1081
01:39:17,017 --> 01:39:19,247
l can understand
everything you say...

1082
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:21,820
... but right now,
l have to meet somebody else.

1083
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:24,521
- Meet somebody else?
- Yes.

1084
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:27,490
Okay. Then l'll phone Mr. Bhushan.

1085
01:39:27,861 --> 01:39:31,092
No, sir. l'm ready to meet you
right away. Tell me where.

1086
01:39:31,699 --> 01:39:33,997
ln front of Park Hotel
within 20 minutes.

1087
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:36,169
But how will l identify you?

1088
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:39,201
There will be two mangoes
in my hands.

1089
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:43,006
And how will you recognise me?

1090
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:46,009
You will also have two mangoes
in your hands, obviously!

1091
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:47,678
l'll be there in a jiffy.

1092
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:52,082
From where will l get
mangoes in Switzerland?

1093
01:39:54,722 --> 01:39:56,189
l have to do this, boss.

1094
01:39:56,724 --> 01:39:58,692
l have to save an lndian girl
in a foreign land!

1095
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,289
lt's the question of
the country's honour!

1096
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:23,713
A fair, chic maiden.

1097
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:39,466
One minute.

1098
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:41,467
- l want to ask you a question.
- Yes?

1099
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:44,329
Could you tell me where
l can get mangoes now?

1100
01:40:44,571 --> 01:40:48,063
Mangoes?... Where will you
get mangoes from now?

1101
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:49,242
Mangoes?

1102
01:40:50,778 --> 01:40:52,006
On the tree.

1103
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:55,343
- What did you say?
- Tree.

1104
01:40:55,649 --> 01:40:56,274
Fool!

1105
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:00,014
On the tree!

1106
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:02,153
Where else do mangoes grow?

1107
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:04,420
The boss has gone to
buy mangoes. Let me do my job!

1108
01:41:06,794 --> 01:41:08,762
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1109
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:13,096
- Siddarth is not coming.
- So what's new? His work is such.

1110
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:16,628
But don't spoil your mood.
l'll take you around the city today.

1111
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:19,568
Don't try to appease me.

1112
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:21,769
l won't bore you.

1113
01:41:22,476 --> 01:41:25,934
l can see you get angry
or shout at me.

1114
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:28,378
But l cannot see you
sad like this.

1115
01:41:29,983 --> 01:41:31,280
Will you take me?

1116
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:34,583
l will take you out today.

1117
01:41:36,156 --> 01:41:40,786
l am a nice man, my intentions are
noble and the weather is first class.

1118
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:45,765
- Shall we?
- Yes, let's go.

1119
01:46:53,974 --> 01:46:56,499
- Aren't you coming?
- No, l'll stay down for a while.

1120
01:46:57,644 --> 01:47:00,306
-Your coat.
-Keep it with the rest of my clothes.

1121
01:47:01,148 --> 01:47:03,844
Okay. Keep this... on my behalf.

1122
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:22,734
Are you back after roaming out with
your wife or the boss' girlfriend?

1123
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:27,004
- Look, sir,...
- l've seen, heard...

1124
01:47:27,174 --> 01:47:28,402
... and understood it all.

1125
01:47:28,675 --> 01:47:30,472
You are exceeding your
limits slightly, sir.

1126
01:47:34,514 --> 01:47:37,005
How much are you paid
for speaking this lie?

1127
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:40,016
l'll pay you more than that
if you speak the truth...

1128
01:47:40,187 --> 01:47:43,350
... to Mr. Arvind about his
son-in-law's involvement with Seema.

1129
01:47:43,523 --> 01:47:44,888
l'll make you rich.

1130
01:47:45,192 --> 01:47:47,558
- Who do you think l am?
- A broker.

1131
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:50,591
Brokerage is what you want.
Be it money or the agency.

1132
01:47:50,797 --> 01:47:52,162
Be it Siddarth who gives it or me.

1133
01:47:52,365 --> 01:47:54,026
We will share everything.

1134
01:48:22,429 --> 01:48:23,726
l'll see you!

1135
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:37,369
That's it. Stop here.

1136
01:48:41,748 --> 01:48:42,874
l'll manage.

1137
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:46,475
Hey, Rahul.

1138
01:48:47,654 --> 01:48:49,417
You're forgetting your tie here.

1139
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:56,628
There is somebody's wedding going
on. Let's have an ice-cream for free.

1140
01:48:58,098 --> 01:49:00,225
Will you have an ice-cream
for free? You are crazy!

1141
01:49:01,268 --> 01:49:02,633
Carry on. l won't come.

1142
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:25,258
What's wrong?

1143
01:49:27,027 --> 01:49:29,996
Seema, come out. You cannot go now.

1144
01:49:30,463 --> 01:49:31,430
Why?

1145
01:49:31,798 --> 01:49:33,857
This is a function
celebrating our marriage.

1146
01:49:35,302 --> 01:49:37,270
- What!
- Yes, look. My mother is there.

1147
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:38,835
So is Bhushan.

1148
01:49:42,175 --> 01:49:44,200
You mean, we have to stage
this charade once more?

1149
01:49:44,377 --> 01:49:47,141
- Yes, we'll have to. Come on.
- No, Rahul, l won't come.

1150
01:49:47,314 --> 01:49:48,872
- Please, Seema.
- Don't be silly. l...

1151
01:49:49,049 --> 01:49:50,539
This is not the time to argue.

1152
01:49:57,591 --> 01:49:59,286
- My mother.
- Welcome, dear.

1153
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:03,026
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

1154
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:05,289
Don't say a word.

1155
01:50:07,734 --> 01:50:10,965
So, she is my daughter-in-law?
She's so beautiful.

1156
01:50:12,839 --> 01:50:16,900
An angel has come into our house.
You fool, you didn't even tell me!

1157
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:20,040
- But...
- Fortunately, you told me everything.

1158
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:26,719
Come in, dear.
l'll ward off evil eyes.

1159
01:50:27,754 --> 01:50:31,190
And yes! Nobody will leave the
place today without having food, okay?

1160
01:50:34,227 --> 01:50:37,663
- My job's done!
- No, sir! Have food and leave.

1161
01:50:38,531 --> 01:50:41,932
Anyway, charity is given at our
house during such joyous occasions.

1162
01:50:43,036 --> 01:50:45,334
Give away charity
for your well-being!

1163
01:50:46,873 --> 01:50:50,741
l'll teach you such a lesson
which you will remember for life!

1164
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:12,522
Come. You may have been coming
to this house many times before.

1165
01:51:13,733 --> 01:51:15,701
But you have actually
entered this home today.

1166
01:51:16,803 --> 01:51:19,363
May all your misfortunes
become mine. Come.

1167
01:51:47,434 --> 01:51:50,267
What was the need to
do all this? Look,...

1168
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:54,269
No, son. Don't try to stop me today.

1169
01:51:55,642 --> 01:51:58,076
You don't realise
how happy you have made me.

1170
01:51:59,946 --> 01:52:01,413
l am the groom's mother.

1171
01:52:11,925 --> 01:52:13,586
Enough, Rahul! Enough!

1172
01:52:14,527 --> 01:52:18,588
l am tired! Come what may, l will
not stage this pretense anymore!

1173
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:23,636
Wait until my mother gets operated.

1174
01:52:27,073 --> 01:52:28,438
After that, l'll...

1175
01:52:30,543 --> 01:52:31,840
l'll find some other way.

1176
01:52:32,645 --> 01:52:35,705
Doing this repeatedly,
... l feel ....

1177
01:52:35,882 --> 01:52:38,783
Strange, right? l know that.

1178
01:52:40,487 --> 01:52:42,648
Yet, you will have
to stage this charade.

1179
01:52:43,823 --> 01:52:48,055
Didn't you see, my mother was
unable to control herself?

1180
01:52:49,562 --> 01:52:51,530
Didn't you see the
immense joy in her eyes?

1181
01:52:54,501 --> 01:52:57,061
And l cannot bear to see
my mother shed tears.

1182
01:52:58,505 --> 01:53:03,943
lf anyone,... anyone even
tries to hurt her,...

1183
01:53:04,978 --> 01:53:06,468
... then l will not spare him!

1184
01:53:08,515 --> 01:53:09,675
Say yes.

1185
01:53:10,517 --> 01:53:14,078
Please don't compel me
to become a beast! Say yes!

1186
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:30,495
Seema, in this world,...

1187
01:53:31,938 --> 01:53:33,838
... l have nobody else
other than my mother.

1188
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:40,769
Please do not shatter
this illusion of hers.

1189
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:43,449
l...

1190
01:53:45,552 --> 01:53:47,520
l implore you!

1191
01:53:54,861 --> 01:53:56,522
Forgive me. Please do
not cry, Rahul.

1192
01:53:58,064 --> 01:53:59,531
Please sit.

1193
01:54:05,305 --> 01:54:08,331
Actually, l never thought about you.

1194
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:17,710
What do l do? lt may be because
l have never got a mother's love.

1195
01:54:20,186 --> 01:54:22,552
You are the only person
whom l can call my friend.

1196
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:25,956
And l hurt you!

1197
01:54:29,596 --> 01:54:33,293
Now, l'll do exactly
what you ask me to.

1198
01:54:35,602 --> 01:54:36,569
Really?

1199
01:54:41,207 --> 01:54:42,572
Forgive me at least now.

1200
01:54:48,615 --> 01:54:50,446
Tell me...

1201
01:54:52,218 --> 01:54:54,584
Should l call her mother or mummy?

1202
01:55:00,627 --> 01:55:01,594
Answer.

1203
01:55:22,649 --> 01:55:25,083
Here, this is your 'mangalsutra'.

1204
01:55:25,985 --> 01:55:28,283
What's the matter?
Did he say something?

1205
01:55:28,988 --> 01:55:29,955
No.

1206
01:55:31,124 --> 01:55:32,284
No, l...

1207
01:55:32,659 --> 01:55:34,627
You look so lovely!

1208
01:55:35,662 --> 01:55:38,028
The weariness of my life
has disappeared looking at you.

1209
01:55:55,081 --> 01:55:56,514
You haven't had anything. Eat little.

1210
01:55:56,683 --> 01:55:58,480
l'm not hungry. Let's leave?

1211
01:55:59,485 --> 01:56:01,112
- Can l eat an apple?
- Yes.

1212
01:56:01,854 --> 01:56:04,482
-But wash it first.
-l had washed my face in the morning.

1213
01:56:05,692 --> 01:56:07,785
Let's go before mother comes.

1214
01:56:08,027 --> 01:56:10,325
She'll ask questions again
for which we'll have no answers.

1215
01:56:10,496 --> 01:56:13,659
She will. But don't worry. There's
yet time for her prayers to end.

1216
01:56:13,866 --> 01:56:16,357
Eat this sweet dish. Mother's
prepared it very well. Have some.

1217
01:56:16,703 --> 01:56:18,068
Eat the apple on the way.

1218
01:56:18,705 --> 01:56:21,833
Let's go, please. Just a minute.
Tell mother bye.

1219
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:25,678
Let's go. Give me the coat.

1220
01:56:26,713 --> 01:56:28,271
Hey, wait. Where are you going?

1221
01:56:28,715 --> 01:56:32,014
Wow, Rahul! Now that your wife's
here, you've forgotten your mother!

1222
01:56:32,185 --> 01:56:33,948
Which wife?... l'm joking.

1223
01:56:34,587 --> 01:56:35,884
- What's this?
- My diary. Give it to me.

1224
01:56:36,055 --> 01:56:38,683
- l know that. What's written?
- Only a couple of phone numbers.

1225
01:56:38,891 --> 01:56:41,951
No! You've written the
expenses spent on your wife.

1226
01:56:42,729 --> 01:56:46,165
Rs. 5 for juice, Rs. 20 for
breakfast, Rs. 100 for a gift...

1227
01:56:47,066 --> 01:56:48,033
What a shame!...
Over that, a commission!

1228
01:56:48,468 --> 01:56:49,696
What's this commission?

1229
01:56:50,903 --> 01:56:54,862
He is very stingy. He writes
the account for anything that l eat.

1230
01:56:55,074 --> 01:56:57,542
You are a spendthrift!
Mother, she spends a lot of money!

1231
01:56:57,744 --> 01:56:59,302
Okay, do not fight.

1232
01:56:59,746 --> 01:57:02,442
Come home soon. Do you
remember what l had told you?

1233
01:57:02,615 --> 01:57:03,582
Yes.

1234
01:57:05,752 --> 01:57:07,185
You're forgetting something.

1235
01:57:15,495 --> 01:57:18,396
- Can l take back this diary?
- No, let it be with me. Go!

1236
01:57:30,443 --> 01:57:32,240
- Will you have something to drink?
- No.

1237
01:57:36,149 --> 01:57:38,743
- Some soft drink?
- No.

1238
01:57:39,786 --> 01:57:41,754
Damn! What's wrong
with you, Seema?

1239
01:57:46,259 --> 01:57:48,159
And why are you
wearing a 'mangalsutra'?

1240
01:57:49,662 --> 01:57:50,629
This...

1241
01:57:50,797 --> 01:57:54,756
l know that we had staged
this charade once to deceive Sheela.

1242
01:57:55,468 --> 01:57:57,231
The charade is over!
Remove it!

1243
01:57:58,805 --> 01:58:01,137
But Rahul has helped us all along.
Now, when he's in trouble,...

1244
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:02,274
Just a minute!

1245
01:58:03,342 --> 01:58:07,642
Rahul did not help us. He did
everything only for his benefit.

1246
01:58:08,314 --> 01:58:11,511
He has struck a deal with himself,
whose price he will get!

1247
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,288
Siddarth, do you set
a price for every man?

1248
01:58:19,325 --> 01:58:20,292
Even me?

1249
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:25,121
Your way of thinking has changed
staying with them for just two days!

1250
01:58:28,968 --> 01:58:30,333
What are you thinking of now?

1251
01:58:31,337 --> 01:58:32,964
Rahul must be waiting
for me at the bus stop.

1252
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:37,401
Rahul must be waiting at
the bus stop! Let him wait forever!

1253
01:58:38,845 --> 01:58:40,278
He will get his overtime!

1254
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:01,359
You must have never had
such food before in Mumbai!

1255
01:59:01,601 --> 01:59:03,091
l am fasting today.

1256
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:04,837
Fasting?

1257
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:09,308
Since when did you start
believing in all this, huh?

1258
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:13,842
The question is not of me believing
it or not, but of mother's devotion.

1259
01:59:14,247 --> 01:59:17,011
What! Mother's devotion?

1260
01:59:17,617 --> 01:59:19,107
To hell with mother's devotion!

1261
01:59:20,219 --> 01:59:23,120
Seema, you are getting confused
between reality and lies!

1262
01:59:24,223 --> 01:59:27,192
Forget Rahul, mother,
that house, the 'mangalsutra'!

1263
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:30,688
All these are lies!
l am the only truth!

1264
01:59:34,433 --> 01:59:37,266
Siddarth, you always think only
about yourself, not about others.

1265
01:59:37,904 --> 01:59:38,871
What!

1266
01:59:39,438 --> 01:59:40,598
You are very selfish!

1267
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:42,597
Where are you going?

1268
01:59:42,909 --> 01:59:45,707
- Seema, where are you going?
- Let me go! Please!

1269
01:59:45,912 --> 01:59:49,040
-You can't leave me and go anywhere!
-Siddarth, do not be stubborn!

1270
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,545
Seema, listen to me!

1271
02:00:06,933 --> 02:00:07,900
Take.

1272
02:00:12,939 --> 02:00:15,305
l'm so sorry,
l got late. Let's go.

1273
02:00:15,508 --> 02:00:19,467
One minute! ls this any time to
return? You are also too much, Seema!

1274
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:21,906
- What could l do...
- You should have thought of mother!

1275
02:00:22,582 --> 02:00:24,914
She'll think that my wife
stays out till 9 in the night!

1276
02:00:25,284 --> 02:00:27,047
l was going to leave but...

1277
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:30,519
Yes, but what to do? The service
at these 5 star hotels are so slow!

1278
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:32,187
lt does take time!

1279
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:35,325
What would you have lost
if you hadn't gone out for a day?

1280
02:00:35,761 --> 02:00:37,592
Anyway, it's matter of a few days.

1281
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:40,257
Perhaps, you have begun to think
that you are doing me a favour.

1282
02:00:42,301 --> 02:00:44,269
Sometimes, learn to
think of others too!

1283
02:00:44,971 --> 02:00:48,065
Actually, you have become blind...
blind in love!

1284
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:49,606
Stop it, Rahul!

1285
02:00:50,476 --> 02:00:52,444
l too had some problems! Siddarth...

1286
02:00:52,645 --> 02:00:53,942
Yes Siddarth!

1287
02:00:55,715 --> 02:00:57,114
l don't want to argue with you now!

1288
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:05,149
Why have you made such a long face?
Will you go like this before mother?

1289
02:01:05,658 --> 02:01:06,818
Bear one thing in mind!

1290
02:01:06,993 --> 02:01:10,224
My mother should feel that
we had gone out together!

1291
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:12,823
And we are very happy
with each other!

1292
02:01:22,008 --> 02:01:23,976
Why are you wasting
more time now? Come on!

1293
02:01:24,176 --> 02:01:25,575
Rahul, leave my hand!

1294
02:01:28,414 --> 02:01:29,972
lt hurts.

1295
02:01:48,868 --> 02:01:52,167
You are here? l've been
waiting for you since long.

1296
02:01:52,571 --> 02:01:53,868
Why did you get so late?

1297
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:56,008
- There was some work at office.
- l see.

1298
02:01:57,043 --> 02:01:58,840
What's this? Even you
haven't yet eaten?

1299
02:01:59,045 --> 02:02:01,878
How could l have eaten alone
without you and my daughter-in-law?

1300
02:02:02,715 --> 02:02:04,273
Why are you standing there?
Come here.

1301
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:07,610
Forget about my wife. She must have
eaten something at a 5 star hotel.

1302
02:02:08,054 --> 02:02:10,852
She's a model. Your daughter-in-law
is no ordinary girl. Let's eat.

1303
02:02:11,057 --> 02:02:13,025
No, my daughter-in-law
cannot break her fast.

1304
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:15,857
Fast? For what?

1305
02:02:16,062 --> 02:02:18,622
Fool, do you know,
it's 'Karvachauth' today!

1306
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:28,597
Take this and do the rituals.
l'll be back soon.

1307
02:02:45,091 --> 02:02:46,786
Have you really not eaten today?

1308
02:03:03,242 --> 02:03:04,800
Let's complete the rituals.

1309
02:03:28,134 --> 02:03:29,567
Why are you looking at me like this?

1310
02:03:31,137 --> 02:03:32,434
Please, Seema, l...

1311
02:03:38,477 --> 02:03:39,774
lt's so strange!

1312
02:03:41,714 --> 02:03:44,114
We worship the moon which
is miles away from us.

1313
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:49,117
But the one that's so close...

1314
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:52,118
... so near...

1315
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:55,993
... isn't even recognised.

1316
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:58,797
Seema, l...

1317
02:04:06,172 --> 02:04:07,537
Will you forgive me?

1318
02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:17,749
No.

1319
02:04:22,188 --> 02:04:25,885
Hey! What's been happening?
Are the prayers over?

1320
02:04:26,792 --> 02:04:30,159
Then let's eat. You must
also be hungry. Come on.

1321
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:36,998
- l'll get it.
- No! l'll get it. Seema, you eat.

1322
02:04:39,205 --> 02:04:40,172
Come.

1323
02:04:44,944 --> 02:04:45,911
Come.

1324
02:04:47,546 --> 02:04:52,176
Hey, what's wrong? Why do
you look so worried?

1325
02:04:54,019 --> 02:04:55,646
Are you hiding something from me?

1326
02:04:56,555 --> 02:04:57,522
No.

1327
02:04:57,890 --> 02:05:00,859
You are happy with
my Rahul, aren't you?

1328
02:05:02,127 --> 02:05:05,096
My son is a little crazy.

1329
02:05:06,232 --> 02:05:11,465
What to do? He has become a bit
irritable, keeping pace with life.

1330
02:05:12,805 --> 02:05:17,208
But watch, someday, my Rahul is
going to become very successful.

1331
02:05:17,776 --> 02:05:21,473
He has a boss - Mr. Siddarth.

1332
02:05:22,581 --> 02:05:24,606
He has taken my Rahul
under his patronage.

1333
02:05:25,251 --> 02:05:28,084
He says that they
will open a huge agency.

1334
02:05:29,121 --> 02:05:31,749
Look there! That's the
model of Rahul's company.

1335
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:34,554
Rahul watches it day and night.

1336
02:05:36,795 --> 02:05:37,090
Someday,...

1337
02:05:46,272 --> 02:05:47,569
Don't cry.

1338
02:05:49,942 --> 02:05:53,639
Rahul will surely become successful.
His dream will surely be realised.

1339
02:05:54,613 --> 02:05:59,983
Do you know, good people
always get the best?

1340
02:06:07,693 --> 02:06:09,593
Rahul! Come out!

1341
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:12,258
- What's happening?
- What, boss?

1342
02:06:12,498 --> 02:06:14,125
What's going on
between Seema and you?

1343
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:17,428
- Talk softly. My mother will hear.
- So what! Call her!

1344
02:06:17,636 --> 02:06:19,263
She should also know what's
happening in this house!

1345
02:06:19,838 --> 02:06:21,271
Rahul, what's happening?

1346
02:06:22,708 --> 02:06:26,269
Mr. Siddarth, you? Has my Rahul
done anything wrong?

1347
02:06:26,779 --> 02:06:28,679
No, mother. Go in.
There's nothing wrong.

1348
02:06:28,847 --> 02:06:30,872
Nothing's wrong? l'll tell her!

1349
02:06:31,483 --> 02:06:34,111
Your son and this girl
are deceiving you.

1350
02:06:35,321 --> 02:06:37,152
- Do not interfere!
- Don't do this!

1351
02:06:37,323 --> 02:06:39,291
Do not interfere!... She is
not your daughter-in-law.

1352
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:42,821
The vermilion on her head, this
'mangalsutra',...everything's a farce!

1353
02:06:43,028 --> 02:06:46,623
They had staged this pretense at
my behest. You are being made a fool.

1354
02:06:51,604 --> 02:06:54,300
Mother, please go inside. Go in!

1355
02:07:06,085 --> 02:07:07,643
Mother!

1356
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:13,925
Come here!

1357
02:07:15,761 --> 02:07:16,989
What's wrong?

1358
02:07:18,364 --> 02:07:19,331
Nothing.

1359
02:07:19,531 --> 02:07:22,728
- Are you okay, mother?
- Don't call me that! Go away!

1360
02:07:23,369 --> 02:07:25,166
- What's the matter?
- Be quiet!

1361
02:07:25,371 --> 02:07:27,339
- Listen to me.
- Do not touch me!

1362
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:31,669
l say, get out! Go away!

1363
02:08:49,788 --> 02:08:51,813
What's wrong, Siddarth?
You look worried.

1364
02:08:53,692 --> 02:08:57,890
l cannot understand
why l tolerate you!

1365
02:08:58,731 --> 02:09:02,428
Because we are related. And we
have the same objective too.

1366
02:09:03,469 --> 02:09:04,834
The wealth of this family.

1367
02:09:06,071 --> 02:09:07,436
Why don't we unite?

1368
02:09:09,141 --> 02:09:10,438
Suppose l refuse, then?

1369
02:09:12,044 --> 02:09:16,777
You'll stand to lose because Rahul
has really fallen in love with Seema.

1370
02:09:18,150 --> 02:09:20,778
Love should exist between
a married couple, right?

1371
02:09:23,155 --> 02:09:25,453
But if Seema also
reciprocates Rahul's...

1372
02:09:28,627 --> 02:09:29,594
Hands off.

1373
02:09:32,698 --> 02:09:34,461
l too can raise my hand.

1374
02:09:35,501 --> 02:09:38,470
But l have come to extend
a hand of friendship.

1375
02:09:42,508 --> 02:09:43,805
lt's your wish.

1376
02:09:45,844 --> 02:09:51,009
lf you don't act soon,
then Rahul will take Seema away.

1377
02:09:51,183 --> 02:09:52,946
l am saying this
because l am your relative.

1378
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:55,086
Rahul and Seema...

1379
02:10:06,532 --> 02:10:08,500
Where were you? l've been looking
out for you since long.

1380
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:12,893
- ls the work done?
- l've added this to Seema's drink.

1381
02:10:13,071 --> 02:10:14,368
Keep it in.

1382
02:10:14,807 --> 02:10:16,775
ln a short while,
she will fall in your arms.

1383
02:10:18,877 --> 02:10:20,970
She has tormented me
a great deal. Where is she?

1384
02:10:21,547 --> 02:10:22,912
Behind, in the hall.

1385
02:10:26,118 --> 02:10:27,983
- Don't talk to us.
- We are depressed.

1386
02:10:28,554 --> 02:10:30,715
What's happening? Show me
what you're drinking.

1387
02:10:34,092 --> 02:10:36,925
Something is fishy. Who gave
it to you?... Did you?

1388
02:10:37,563 --> 02:10:39,531
- l am very depressed.
- Precisely why l'm asking you.

1389
02:10:40,098 --> 02:10:43,795
Don't drink that! And don't move
from here. l'll go and fetch Rahul.

1390
02:10:44,102 --> 02:10:46,798
- Can l move?
- You are totally shaken, sir.

1391
02:10:47,573 --> 02:10:48,801
Yet don't move.

1392
02:10:52,177 --> 02:10:53,542
Sad statue!

1393
02:11:02,588 --> 02:11:03,953
What's the matter with you?

1394
02:11:04,156 --> 02:11:06,681
We are statues - sad statues.

1395
02:11:06,925 --> 02:11:08,893
Sad statues? What childishness
is this!

1396
02:11:09,461 --> 02:11:11,361
Come on, Seema. l want
to show you something.

1397
02:11:12,297 --> 02:11:14,822
l will not move until Rahul comes.

1398
02:11:18,670 --> 02:11:20,695
l will not move until Rahul comes.

1399
02:11:20,939 --> 02:11:23,066
Rahul will not come. l know that.

1400
02:11:24,009 --> 02:11:25,738
- He won't come?
- No. He's gone elsewhere. Come.

1401
02:16:29,247 --> 02:16:30,214
You?

1402
02:16:30,916 --> 02:16:32,281
You're looking for Seema, right?

1403
02:16:33,919 --> 02:16:36,410
No secret of yours is hidden from me.

1404
02:16:37,923 --> 02:16:39,481
Seema is not in the party right now.

1405
02:16:40,926 --> 02:16:42,894
l know where Seema is.

1406
02:16:49,067 --> 02:16:50,557
What does the moon mean to us?

1407
02:16:51,536 --> 02:16:53,504
Why does it stay up
the whole night for us?

1408
02:16:57,742 --> 02:16:59,903
By the way, what do you mean to me?

1409
02:17:03,949 --> 02:17:06,713
l don't know.
Drink this. Let me help you.

1410
02:17:07,352 --> 02:17:08,910
- Drink.
- No, you drink.

1411
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:10,747
- You drink, it's good for you.
- You drink.

1412
02:17:10,956 --> 02:17:12,651
- Seema, drink.
- No, you drink...

1413
02:17:13,825 --> 02:17:15,122
Are you hurt?

1414
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:17,760
No, l'm not. First, you hit
and then ask if l am hurt!

1415
02:17:18,029 --> 02:17:20,327
The other day, you hit my lip.
Today, it's my eye. What is all this!

1416
02:17:20,498 --> 02:17:23,058
l didn't do it intentionally.
Just turn for a minute.

1417
02:17:23,235 --> 02:17:24,725
For what! Don't do anything now!

1418
02:17:27,973 --> 02:17:29,941
Are you hurt here?... Just a minute.

1419
02:17:30,242 --> 02:17:31,470
Relax... No.

1420
02:17:43,388 --> 02:17:44,821
ls it okay now?

1421
02:17:48,827 --> 02:17:49,122
Yes.

1422
02:17:50,795 --> 02:17:52,092
Do it again.

1423
02:17:59,738 --> 02:18:00,705
Go on.

1424
02:18:01,139 --> 02:18:02,766
First close your eyes.

1425
02:18:33,505 --> 02:18:36,338
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1426
02:18:53,058 --> 02:18:54,355
Let's go?

1427
02:18:59,664 --> 02:19:01,029
There they are.

1428
02:19:03,068 --> 02:19:05,036
Wait. Don't spoil the game.

1429
02:19:08,573 --> 02:19:10,040
Perhaps, you are right, Bhushan.

1430
02:19:11,476 --> 02:19:13,842
So, are we partners from today?

1431
02:19:20,085 --> 02:19:21,518
You will get what you want.

1432
02:19:24,089 --> 02:19:27,058
And l will acquire what l want!

1433
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:30,728
This tale will end tomorrow!

1434
02:19:37,502 --> 02:19:38,867
Do you see this office?

1435
02:19:40,105 --> 02:19:41,333
How is it?

1436
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:44,908
lt's quite big.
Whose office is it, boss?

1437
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:46,475
lt is your office.

1438
02:19:51,116 --> 02:19:52,481
- My office, boss?
- Yes.

1439
02:19:53,852 --> 02:19:56,480
And this is your cabin.

1440
02:20:04,129 --> 02:20:05,426
How do you feel here?

1441
02:20:07,132 --> 02:20:08,429
Very good.

1442
02:20:09,134 --> 02:20:10,601
This was your dream, wasn't it?

1443
02:20:13,571 --> 02:20:16,665
The biggest surprise
is going to come now.

1444
02:20:18,476 --> 02:20:19,443
Look.

1445
02:20:46,237 --> 02:20:49,468
lt's such an auspicious day today.
Each one has got what he wanted.

1446
02:20:50,175 --> 02:20:52,973
Rahul has got the office,
and Seema and l have got each other.

1447
02:20:58,049 --> 02:21:01,314
lf Seema and l are together today,
then it's only because of you.

1448
02:21:03,188 --> 02:21:06,487
So, both of us have decided
to give you this office.

1449
02:21:08,193 --> 02:21:10,718
l am sure that you will be
very pleased to receive...

1450
02:21:10,895 --> 02:21:13,159
... the keys of your
new office from Seema's hands.

1451
02:21:14,132 --> 02:21:19,502
But Seema will be more pleased to
give them to you. Right, Seema?

1452
02:21:26,211 --> 02:21:29,180
Hey, why are you staring
at each other? Hurry.

1453
02:21:29,547 --> 02:21:33,506
Seema, give Rahul the keys.
... Rahul, take them.

1454
02:21:33,885 --> 02:21:35,182
Take the keys.

1455
02:21:37,222 --> 02:21:41,784
Now we ought to leave Rahul
alone with his happiness.

1456
02:21:50,502 --> 02:21:51,469
Let's go.

1457
02:22:21,266 --> 02:22:23,826
- l don't want this office.
- What! What are you saying!

1458
02:22:24,269 --> 02:22:27,033
Hey, sit glued to this chair!

1459
02:22:27,272 --> 02:22:28,830
No! This is only a bribe.

1460
02:22:29,007 --> 02:22:29,974
For what?

1461
02:22:30,108 --> 02:22:31,905
lt's a price for not letting Seema
know the truth about Mr. Siddarth.

1462
02:22:32,277 --> 02:22:33,642
- l am going!
- Where to?

1463
02:22:33,811 --> 02:22:35,779
l am going to tell Seema
about Mr. Siddarth's intentions.

1464
02:22:35,947 --> 02:22:36,572
- Listen!
- l'm going!

1465
02:22:37,282 --> 02:22:39,910
Listen! Do you know
if Seema loves you or not?

1466
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:43,385
But at least, l love her.

1467
02:22:47,292 --> 02:22:49,123
This hero has made everyone a zero!

1468
02:22:49,894 --> 02:22:52,658
lt looks like l will have to
manage the climax of this story.

1469
02:23:18,389 --> 02:23:19,879
Hey, hero, do you want to die?

1470
02:23:30,201 --> 02:23:33,170
- l'll go.
- But l called out first.

1471
02:23:33,338 --> 02:23:34,635
But l sat first.

1472
02:23:35,139 --> 02:23:37,699
- Hey, who is standing?
- He is.

1473
02:23:37,875 --> 02:23:39,172
- Who is sitting?
- He is.

1474
02:23:39,344 --> 02:23:41,107
Okay. The one seated, will remain so.

1475
02:23:41,346 --> 02:23:43,314
And the one standing will
continue to stand! Good-day!

1476
02:23:43,681 --> 02:23:45,649
Sorry. Maybe, next time.
l'm in a hurry.

1477
02:23:57,962 --> 02:23:59,156
Let's go.

1478
02:23:59,364 --> 02:24:01,525
- Which place is this?
- Come on!

1479
02:24:02,367 --> 02:24:05,996
This is a place where l bring
only my special friends.

1480
02:24:06,971 --> 02:24:08,939
Just a minute.
l'll come in the front.

1481
02:24:09,374 --> 02:24:12,832
l'll get very late. lt's a matter
concerning the heart. Please hurry.

1482
02:24:13,044 --> 02:24:15,512
Heart? ls that the
name of some vegetable?

1483
02:24:15,713 --> 02:24:18,944
No, it's a matter concerning love.
l have to reach my girlfriend soon.

1484
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:20,683
- Love?
- Yes.

1485
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:24,620
Then watch how fast l move!

1486
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,901
Seema, what will you drink?

1487
02:24:39,404 --> 02:24:41,031
- l won't take anything.
- l will tell you.

1488
02:24:41,406 --> 02:24:42,896
We will drink champagne today.

1489
02:24:43,408 --> 02:24:45,376
To celebrate the occasion
of Rahul getting his office.

1490
02:24:46,944 --> 02:24:48,172
l'll get the champagne.

1491
02:24:52,817 --> 02:24:55,115
l want to talk to you. Should l
come in or will you come out?

1492
02:24:55,553 --> 02:24:57,384
One minute. l'll come.

1493
02:24:58,823 --> 02:25:01,053
- lt's good you came.
- l never thought you...

1494
02:25:01,426 --> 02:25:02,654
Come with me.

1495
02:25:07,432 --> 02:25:12,870
Siddarth, if you try to deceive me,
then l shall destroy you!

1496
02:25:13,037 --> 02:25:16,666
How can l deceive you? l know that
you have learnt everything about me.

1497
02:25:49,474 --> 02:25:51,237
You were thinking about me, right?

1498
02:25:52,310 --> 02:25:53,277
Yes!

1499
02:25:53,478 --> 02:25:54,706
Here l am!

1500
02:25:58,483 --> 02:25:59,711
Rahul, do you know...

1501
02:26:11,662 --> 02:26:13,630
- To hell with Rahul!
- Listen to me, Bhushan.

1502
02:26:13,831 --> 02:26:18,791
l don't want to listen to anything.
Siddarth, what had we agreed to?

1503
02:26:19,637 --> 02:26:21,127
That we are partners.

1504
02:26:21,506 --> 02:26:24,202
And the basis of the partnership
was that you'd give me the office.

1505
02:26:24,509 --> 02:26:26,136
Then how can you give
that office to Rahul?

1506
02:26:26,511 --> 02:26:29,207
How often have l told you
that giving the keys to Rahul...

1507
02:26:29,380 --> 02:26:32,008
... does not make the office his?
lt is only yours.

1508
02:26:32,517 --> 02:26:35,213
All this was done to silence him.
Let him play with the keys.

1509
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:38,284
We can take back the keys
just the way we gave it to him.

1510
02:26:48,533 --> 02:26:50,364
Seema! Where are you going?

1511
02:26:50,802 --> 02:26:55,296
l have heard it all. l never
thought that you could stoop so low!

1512
02:26:55,873 --> 02:26:57,500
No! Wait, Seema!

1513
02:26:58,209 --> 02:26:59,767
You are snatching Rahul's
office from him?

1514
02:27:00,344 --> 02:27:02,312
Do you know what it means to him?

1515
02:27:03,281 --> 02:27:04,680
lt is his life!

1516
02:27:05,550 --> 02:27:06,778
Let me go!

1517
02:27:08,820 --> 02:27:12,847
Only l can fulfil all
your dreams and desires.

1518
02:27:13,090 --> 02:27:14,853
l do not want these dreams!

1519
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:16,925
l'm going to tell Rahul everything.

1520
02:27:17,094 --> 02:27:19,119
Which Rahul are you talking about?!

1521
02:27:19,797 --> 02:27:23,198
The one who took the keys in a jiffy
and didn't even think about you!

1522
02:27:23,901 --> 02:27:27,530
lf he loved you even a little, he
would have never accepted the office!

1523
02:27:33,077 --> 02:27:34,009
l do not know if he loves me or not.
But l have begun to love him.

1524
02:27:38,082 --> 02:27:39,208
What did you say!

1525
02:27:40,117 --> 02:27:42,677
Yes, l love Rahul, and l am leaving!

1526
02:27:44,589 --> 02:27:46,557
lt's good that you have
realised my true colours!

1527
02:27:47,225 --> 02:27:50,353
Anyway, l am tired of staging
this charade of being decent!

1528
02:27:51,195 --> 02:27:52,560
Come with me!

1529
02:27:53,598 --> 02:27:55,429
Come on! Enough of being decent!

1530
02:27:58,603 --> 02:27:59,831
What will you do now?

1531
02:28:00,238 --> 02:28:02,570
Will you scream, huh?... Go ahead!

1532
02:28:03,341 --> 02:28:05,775
There's nobody to hear
your voice here. Nobody!

1533
02:28:06,878 --> 02:28:10,109
And if you think that some hero
is going to break through the glass...

1534
02:28:10,615 --> 02:28:11,775
... to save you, then forget it!

1535
02:28:17,455 --> 02:28:21,186
Bhushan, you? Why have
you come here? Why?

1536
02:28:21,626 --> 02:28:23,856
- He pushed me.
- Who?

1537
02:28:24,629 --> 02:28:25,596
He did.

1538
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:29,766
l did.

1539
02:28:35,973 --> 02:28:38,999
l came to say that
this man is cheating you.

1540
02:28:39,310 --> 02:28:41,335
- He certainly won't marry you.
- l too wanted to tell you...

1541
02:28:41,512 --> 02:28:43,480
... that he's cheating you.
He won't give you the office.

1542
02:28:43,648 --> 02:28:45,616
- Rahul, get out!
- Please don't go!

1543
02:28:45,816 --> 02:28:46,783
Be quiet!

1544
02:28:47,385 --> 02:28:49,615
- Stop ordering!
- Rahul, l shall sack you!

1545
02:28:49,787 --> 02:28:52,881
You cannot sack me. l myself do not
accept you as my boss anymore!

1546
02:28:53,224 --> 02:28:54,623
- What did you say!
- Leave my hand!

1547
02:29:00,998 --> 02:29:02,465
Rahul, l will not spare you!

1548
02:29:02,667 --> 02:29:04,965
Hey, Bhushan,
l am Siddarth Chowdhry!

1549
02:29:05,403 --> 02:29:07,496
- Why did you come here?
- Why didn't you stop me?

1550
02:29:07,672 --> 02:29:09,640
- My scooter gave way.
- lt always does!

1551
02:29:09,874 --> 02:29:12,502
But why did you give me the keys?
You should have told Siddarth that...

1552
02:29:12,677 --> 02:29:14,804
... you don't like him
and won't give me the keys!

1553
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:16,647
Don't shout!

1554
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:23,048
But you wanted the office.
You wanted to become a big shot.

1555
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:31,651
l wanted to make it big,
but you didn't, right?

1556
02:29:32,396 --> 02:29:34,057
Just come there.

1557
02:29:36,233 --> 02:29:39,669
Seema, you had once said that
two weak people... what had you said?

1558
02:29:39,904 --> 02:29:41,667
- ... cannot make a successful life.
- Then?

1559
02:29:41,839 --> 02:29:44,399
But l had also said that
you can please any girl.

1560
02:29:44,575 --> 02:29:46,543
But you should have told me
that you meant yourself.

1561
02:29:46,711 --> 02:29:47,678
You're...

1562
02:29:49,213 --> 02:29:50,680
You only remember my mistakes.

1563
02:29:50,881 --> 02:29:53,406
Remember, l had kept a fast
for you during 'Karvachauth'.

1564
02:29:53,617 --> 02:29:54,914
l remained hungry the whole day.

1565
02:29:55,119 --> 02:29:57,849
You kept a fast! But don't forget
l had sung a song for you abroad!

1566
02:29:58,923 --> 02:30:00,686
- Both of you even sang a song?
- Yes, we did.

1567
02:30:00,891 --> 02:30:02,859
- What was l doing then?
- You were selling mangoes.

1568
02:30:03,060 --> 02:30:04,357
l was selling mangoes?

1569
02:30:18,009 --> 02:30:20,443
- You aren't hurt, are you?
- Yes, l am.

1570
02:30:20,945 --> 02:30:24,711
You sang such a long song. But
couldn't you say that you love me?

1571
02:30:25,149 --> 02:30:27,208
Even you could have
said that you love me.

1572
02:30:27,618 --> 02:30:30,451
Yes, l could have but
you should say it first.

1573
02:30:30,755 --> 02:30:32,120
Why should l say it first?
You say.

1574
02:30:32,757 --> 02:30:34,554
l... You say first!

1575
02:30:34,759 --> 02:30:36,454
- You say first.
- Look,...

1576
02:30:36,627 --> 02:30:39,118
- You say first.
- Let's say it together?

1577
02:30:41,999 --> 02:30:43,296
Close your eyes.

1578
02:31:40,691 --> 02:31:41,658
No!

1579
02:31:50,101 --> 02:31:51,068
What's it?

1580
02:32:41,485 --> 02:32:42,850
But just think, Rahul.

1581
02:32:43,888 --> 02:32:46,857
When your traditional and orthodox
mother learns that...

1582
02:32:47,691 --> 02:32:51,593
... this girl, at my behest,
at the behest of a married man...

1583
02:32:51,762 --> 02:32:53,525
... staged a charade
of being married to you,...

1584
02:32:53,898 --> 02:32:56,196
then will she accept her?
... No!

1585
02:32:57,067 --> 02:32:59,592
Never! Why are you quiet?
Answer me.

1586
02:33:00,104 --> 02:33:01,401
l will answer.

1587
02:33:03,174 --> 02:33:04,141
You?

1588
02:33:04,909 --> 02:33:08,345
l have brought her here.
l knew this question would arise.

1589
02:33:11,649 --> 02:33:17,884
Mother, l... l was going to tell
you that Seema and l...

1590
02:33:31,268 --> 02:33:32,565
Look at me.

1591
02:33:40,945 --> 02:33:42,913
There is no need to feel ashamed.

1592
02:33:46,951 --> 02:33:52,184
lf my son, dreaming to make it big,
can get misled by wrong people,...

1593
02:33:53,624 --> 02:33:54,591
... then why can't you?

1594
02:33:56,360 --> 02:34:00,091
Why this discrimination?
Only because you are a girl?

1595
02:34:03,968 --> 02:34:05,936
lt isn't your fault at all.

1596
02:34:06,971 --> 02:34:10,600
The fault lies with people
like him who should be punished.

1597
02:34:14,979 --> 02:34:20,349
Being a woman and a mother,
l accept you as my daughter-in-law.

1598
02:34:52,549 --> 02:34:53,516
Let's go.

1599
02:35:03,494 --> 02:35:06,986
The office is mine! lt is mine!!

1600
02:35:11,035 --> 02:35:13,003
No problem. Let's go?

1601
02:35:34,058 --> 02:35:39,018
Seema, remember the Mercedes,
the constable, the kerchief?

1602
02:35:40,064 --> 02:35:43,591
No. l only remember your scooter,
the diary...

1603
02:35:43,801 --> 02:35:45,496
... and the flowers
worth Rs.200.

1604
02:35:46,503 --> 02:35:49,529
But watch, someday, l will
bring you a Mercedes like this.

1605
02:35:50,074 --> 02:35:52,565
With my hard earned money
because...

1606
02:35:53,811 --> 02:35:56,041
Good people always get the best.

1607
02:36:00,123 --> 02:36:30,321
