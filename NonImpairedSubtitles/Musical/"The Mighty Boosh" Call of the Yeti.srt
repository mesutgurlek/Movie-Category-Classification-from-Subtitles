1
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:06,446
Come with us now on a journey
through time and space!

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,743
To the world of The Mighty Boosh!

3
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,475
What about this?

4
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,043
Good.

5
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:37,565
-How about this?
-Also good.

6
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:39,263
What about this - to travelling?

7
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:41,291
Oh.. manifique!

8
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,362
The funky inuit?

9
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:45,249
Very good.

10
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,153
-What about this cape?
-A bit last week..

11
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:49,511
I'll put that in the maybe-pile.

12
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:50,862
Vince, you ready?

13
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:54,077
Almost there, yeah. Narrowed it down to
these two piles.

14
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:57,717
You are joking, aren't you? We're going
to a cabin in the woods.

15
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,046
-So?
-For one weekend!

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,524
Yeah, I suppose.

17
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:03,400
Let's try and narrow it down, okay?

18
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:05,332
Do you need this tie?

19
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:11,187
Yeah! The tie is a multipurpose accessory.
You know, belt, schoolboy, Rambo.

20
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:12,912
All right, what about this Jacobean ruff?

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,506
Listen. I've got a strong feeling the Tudor look's
going to comeback in while we're away.

22
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:19,511
-I don't want to get left behind.
-You'll be in the wilderness. Who's going to know?

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,670
What if someone's photographing animals,
yeah, and I'm the back of the shot?

24
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:24,902
The Internet's a powerful took these days.

25
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:27,726
Vince, you've got to be more economical, like me.

26
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:32,253
You see what I've got going on here? The multipurpose
tweed utility suit - it's all I'm taking and it's all I need!

27
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:34,966
-Yeah, what if you wanna go swimming?
-It zips down to trunks.

28
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,812
Well it's easy for you, isn't it?
You haven't got any style.

29
00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:41,061
Do you mind? I don't buffet about on the
winds of fashion.

30
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:44,625
Fashion may come and go, Howard Moon
remains where he is.

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,576
Clothes avalanche!

32
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:54,968
All right, that's it! One suitcase!

33
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:59,431
-Naboo, are you ready?
-Nearly, what do you think - red or blue?

34
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:03,466
I don't care. We're supposed to have set off by now! What is
the matter with everyone?! Did you get my itinerary?

35
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:05,834
Look, chill out, we're going on holiday, it's suppose to be relaxing'!

36
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:07,502
I'm going to have to type out a new one.

37
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:11,074
-What about you? Have you packed?
-Yes I have! This is everything I need right here.

38
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:15,525
-I'm wearing it! The multipurpose tweed utility suit!
-What if you want to go swimming?

39
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:21,215
Happy? Now get ready!

40
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:23,539
Oh, I didn't need to see that..

41
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:26,271
-Okay Bollo. You ready?
-Hm, yeah.

42
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:27,582
-Let's do it!
-Okay.

43
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,693
Go on Bollo!

44
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:32,695
-Use your monkey strength!
-Come on, baby!

45
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:39,400
Get your primate arms out! Put your back into it!
Bit more, bit more, come on!

46
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,735
-Yes!
-Quickly, quickly!

47
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,728
Go!

48
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:57,602
Nice!

49
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,348
Can't you put your suit back on?

50
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:06,669
The zip broke.

51
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:14,889
-I hate wildness. Can't we go to Euro Disney?
-I'm not spending another summer in a Goofy lounge, okay?

52
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,955
-I've booked us a cabin, deep in the woods.
-Great.

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,502
-Is good for me actually.
-Is it really?

54
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:25,641
I'm running low on supplies. As a shaman I can put it
down as a business trip and claim it all back.

55
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:26,626
Nice.

56
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,082
-Where you find out about this cabin?
-A little advert in the Global Explorer.

57
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:33,144
A magazine I subscribe to.

58
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:36,064
-Global Explorer?
-Very inspiring stuff.

59
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:41,008
I hate that magazine. It's a sepia nightmare!
I tried to read it once, it get me a panic attack.

60
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:43,392
-You heard of this?
-Huh?

61
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:44,616
-Cheekbone?
-No.

62
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:49,229
It's the most up to-date magazine around. It's so
cutting-edge, it goes out of date every three hours.

63
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:52,868
-Really?
-You can't get it in shops. It's delivered by ninjas.

64
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:54,713
Yeah, well, the Global Explorer never
goes out a date.

65
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,175
There's photographs in there, that are eternally
relevant to our life and times, Vince.

66
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,446
One day I intend to be on the cover of that magazine.

67
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,835
-What, with a tropical disease?
-No!

68
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,165
-With one of my photographs.
-What photographs?

69
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:09,730
I'm building up quite a portfolio, I'll have you know.

70
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:12,401
-What, are you a photographer now?
-Yes, sir.

71
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:15,825
-I thought you were jazz poet.
-I do many things.

72
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:19,029
That you don't know about. I span the genres, Vince.
They call me the Genre Spanner.

73
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,800
They call you the Spanner.

74
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:30,883
-Cheekbone.
-Cheers!

75
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:46,154
Here's a poem for I'm the Moon. Neil
Armstrong walking on my face.

76
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:57,032
Buzz Aldrin, he walking on my face. And then
the third one, a spaceman walkin' on my face.

77
00:04:57,132 --> 00:05:05,235
All on the surfaces, and they looking at all
the stuff that the Moon has got to offer.

78
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,222
Hehe.. yeah.

79
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,163
Here we are. What do you think of that?

80
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:26,712
Is this the garage?

81
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:29,027
No, this is it, Vince.

82
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:38,162
Woow, check these out! A true hunters cabin, eh?

83
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:42,225
Aah..

84
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,241
Sorry Bollo..

85
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:57,554
That was Chinque. He was my friend. As
children we played together in forest.

86
00:05:57,616 --> 00:06:04,577
My father warn us, "No go too far, for
there are hunter at edge of forest."

87
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:13,312
But Chinque curious. He always say: 'Bollo, please. Please
let us go to edge of forest!' over and over and over..

88
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:20,296
And so finally, one day, I chopped his head off.

89
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,263
Cup of tea, anyone?

90
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:33,844
Ah yes, this is more like it.

91
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:40,452
A roaring fire, cup of tea, what more do you need, eh?

92
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:42,435
Mtv?!

93
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:46,595
We're getting away from all that, Vince.
Getting away from the noise of the city.

94
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,898
Listen - what can you hear?

95
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:54,114
Your cells dying.

96
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:57,689
-Tranquillity, Vince. The sound of nature.
-I'm bored!

97
00:06:57,928 --> 00:07:02,183
Yeah, well I knew you would be, which is why,
if you turn to page three of your itineraries,

98
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:07,073
you'll find I've prepared a short introductory lecture on the
wildness, just to get you into the spirit of things, okay?

99
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:14,273
I've gotta bad feeling about this.

100
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,030
No kidding, let's get out of here.

101
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:18,589
-Oi, where are you two going?
-Shaman business.

102
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:21,214
-Well can I come with you?
-No, you've got to stay here with him.

103
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:23,358
Aah, you're joking, he's insane!

104
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:29,029
Look at him, he's all excited, you can't leave him.

105
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:31,452
Thanks a lot.

106
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:34,447
-Hey guys, what's happening?
-We're going to get some supplies.

107
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:36,547
It's ten o'clock at night! You're going miss the lecture.

108
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,378
It's the best time, there's no one around.

109
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,187
-Oh.
-Do you want anything?

110
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:43,442
-No, I'm fine, thanks.
-I'm getting some owl beaks, if you're interested.

111
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:45,409
Owl beaks? What for?

112
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:49,576
The thing is about owl beaks is they can restore
man's fire, if you get my drift..

113
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:51,665
-I'm fine, thanks.
-Sure? A man of your age?

114
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,620
-I said I'm fine.
-I get you, Vince is in the room.

115
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,608
Just get out, will you, if you're going.

116
00:07:57,556 --> 00:07:59,734
Right, where were we?

117
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:02,199
Get you a couple, yeah?

118
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,871
Okay.. There you go.

119
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,159
What's this for?

120
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,138
Take notes and then we can do a Question & Answer 
session in the interval.

121
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,034
-Interval?
-Yes, sir.

122
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:14,619
-Are you out of your mind?
-Simmer down.

123
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:21,237
Now the life cycle of the frog. The frog is 
an amphibian and he lays eggs...

124
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:25,852
They're called spawn, which then become 
tadpoles... dormant... hibernation...

125
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:31,561
Now the brown bear, differing from the black bear,
will hibernate for up to three and a half months,

126
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:34,611
the brown bear, obviously, three months. You can
have a look at your notes on that one.

127
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:39,892
Interesting fact about those two bears, the black bear sometimes
can be brown and the brown bear can sometimes be..

128
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,503
..black! Haha..
Yes!

129
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:53,850
-Well well, lookie here!
-Keep back, I know Wing-Chun!

130
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:55,251
-You only had one lesson.
-Shut up!

131
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:02,961
Cool your jets, I'm Kodiak Jack, I own this cabin, I'm just
checking in to see how you're all settling in.

132
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:05,872
Kodiak, it's Howard Moon! We spoke on the
phone this morning.

133
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:08,336
-The what?
-The telephone.

134
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,981
Ooh, oh the talkiestick! Your voice was trapped
in there this morning!

135
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:15,396
-Yeah, Howard Moon.
-Hello!  -Well hello.

136
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:22,177
And hello! What's your name sugar dumpling?

137
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:23,354
Vince.

138
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:25,522
Hm.. beautiful name.

139
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:33,527
Well, we were just doing a lecture on the wildness here,
and you're welcome to sort of stick around and join us.

140
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:34,514
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah!

141
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:37,081
What do you know about that, Mr City balls?

142
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:44,416
-Well uh.. I have read this rather large book on the wildness.
-Book?!? That's all you people know!

143
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:47,710
Let me tell you something. It's all about experience.

144
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:55,080
Have you ever had a mountain goat grab you by the scrotum
and run away with it? Then sell it on ebay a day later?

145
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:56,271
-Huh?
-No.

146
00:09:56,014 --> 00:10:02,063
-Have you ever been rohypnoted by a swan? Woke up in Cancun?
-No.

147
00:10:02,096 --> 00:10:08,607
You ever been to a tea party with a herd of rhino?
Well, I HAVE! And it ain't purdy!

148
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:12,302
-Right..
-I've had run-ins with all these animals and I killed 'em all.

149
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:19,198
I killed that one. I killed that one! I...
killed that one.

150
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,357
Well.. I've had some pretty hairy moments myself, sir, yes sir.

151
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:27,037
Oh yeah? You got any scars to prove it?

152
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,931
-Emotional scars? Yes..
-Yeah? Check this out!

153
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,058
Moose bite, 1973. Ain't nothing emotional about that.

154
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:44,781
Check this out! Horn of a wildebeest ripped it wide open.
Had to tie it up with my own shoestring!

155
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:51,377
Yeah? Big deal! See that? Straighteners, Nicky Clarke. Hottest
you can get. Fell asleep on them while I was pissed.

156
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,861
-Jiminy Christmas!
-Now, can you get out please? 'Cause I want to go to bed.

157
00:10:55,926 --> 00:11:05,215
Oh.. yes. Pardonnez-moi.  Of course. I hope we meet
again sometime under different circumstances.

158
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:12,152
-What a character!
-What a freak!

159
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:19,500
Uuh, mister, I was wondering if you'd care to join
me for a drink and possibly a smoke on the porch?

160
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:22,711
-Man to man, so to speak.
-Don't mind if I do, sir.

161
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:27,283
Me and Jack are just going to have a little
bit of a wildness chat, check you in a bit.

162
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:28,735
Yeah, whatever..

163
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,089
Get some of that for me, will you, Bollo?

164
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,861
Hm.. okay.. Oh, three for two. Bargain!

165
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:53,571
And when the spaceman come, they did experimentens
with a hammer and the feather.

166
00:11:53,779 --> 00:12:02,489
to see which one would land first. And, do you know, on the
moon's surface, they land at exactly the same time!

167
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:12,074
They could have done that with anything - beach ball,
peg, magnet.. Little drawing of some chicken..

168
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:18,249
It don't make no difference. When you on the
Moon, everything lands the same.

169
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:26,185
Beautiful view, huh?

170
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:27,931
Oh yeah..

171
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:33,787
You know, when I see a view like that I'm always
aware of the terrifying insignificance of mankind

172
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:38,821
and yet, at the same time, the irrevocable connection 
that we all have with the universe..

173
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,268
You know what I think about?

174
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:46,706
All the tiny animal penises all over! Anyway,
 I've got a question for you.

175
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:49,197
You two out here on your honeymoon?

176
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:52,282
Uh.. no Jack.. I think you've got the wrong 
end of the stick there. Hahaha..

177
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:55,522
Well uh.. what are you doing out here in these parts, then?

178
00:12:55,681 --> 00:13:00,825
Well I'm a wildlife photographer by trade. 
Just building myself up a portfolio, sir..

179
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,392
-Ah, picture box!
-That's me, it's in my blood, you know?

180
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:06,767
Well uh.. maybe I can help you with that.

181
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:11,199
-How?
-Well you know, left to your own devices out here in the forest,

182
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:15,727
you'd be lucky to get a picture of a chip 
muck or a piece of moss.

183
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:22,277
But I know the whereabouts of a creature, 
that's never been seen by human eyeballs.

184
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:30,284
You get a photograph of that, you'll be famous! 
On a cover of some fancy magazine!

185
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:37,076
You see this map right here? Leads directly 
to the creature's lair, out on Piney Ridge.

186
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,211
-Can I have a look at that?
-Maybe you can and maybe you can't.

187
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:43,058
Can I?

188
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:47,089
Well, maybe I've got something you want and 
maybe you've got something I want.

189
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:50,058
-What?
-Well you know..

190
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:53,888
..man does get lonely out here in the woods.

191
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:59,432
Uh.. no Jack, I'm sorry.. I mean I'm a liberal guy,
but I will draw the line there, I'm afraid.

192
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:06,386
Not you, you dickbrain! I'm talking about hoochie-coochie 
pants in there. Man does have his standards.

193
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:10,745
We don't often get a little cute, nubile 
princess like that around here.

194
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:13,671
Usually old, weather-beaten types like yourself..

195
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:17,477
Look, I could never do that, okay? Vince's a friend 
 of mine, so I bid you good night!

196
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:24,277
Well that's a shame, I guess you won't be needing 
a photo of the one and only, the legendary - Yeti!

197
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,163
How long would you need him for? 

198
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:49,470
Excuse me. Are these supposed to be like this?

199
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:50,998
Oh, sorry it's burst..

200
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:56,652
-Bollo get us some more jaguar tears, will you? 
They're going everywhere.  -Okay.

201
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:04,210
-Just by horns and hooves.
-Oh, okay.

202
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:09,948
-You all right, Barry?
-All right Naboo.

203
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:15,274
I haven't seen you for ages! When was it? 
Whikkam caves. Quite a night.

204
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:17,977
Yeah, I was out of my head that night - sick in 
my turban. You were all over the shop.

205
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:24,666
I know, it was my birthday. I was off my chops!  
I had two Mick Jaggers and a line of cheap whizz.

206
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:27,578
-Anyway, what are you up to these days?
-Oh, I've gone freelance.

207
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:30,528
-You've still got Bollo?
-Yeah, he's over there getting me some stuff.

208
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,625
-All right Bollo!
-Huh.

209
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:34,196
Where's your familiar?

210
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:36,672
Ah! This is Chrissie.

211
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:43,703
- Oh, he's lovely, this one. I thought you had a black cat.
- I did. Doing my head in. Got myself an upgrade.

212
00:15:43,787 --> 00:15:48,711
- I wish I could get an upgrade.
- Well, you should. He's tiny, got all the latest features.

213
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:51,501
-Got a points card?
-Bollo?

214
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:56,561
-Oh, sorry. I forgot it.
-See what I mean? That's worth fifty magic carpet miles.

215
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:58,924
- Upgrade.
- See ya later Barry.

216
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:01,558
Here, Naboo, can I have a word?

217
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,924
If I was you, I'd keep yourself indoors 
tonight. Avoid the forest.

218
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:08,076
-Oh yeah?
-Apparently it's breeding night for the Yeti.

219
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:11,523
- I thought they were hibernating?
- They are, but every 25 years they come out.

220
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:18,074
Look for a man to breed with. They're bloody
rampant. If I was you, I'd avoid Piney Ridge.

221
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,538
-How did you find out about this?
-Chrissie, gets all the latest, he's got sonar.

222
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:26,112
-Why didn't you tell me about this, Bollo?
-Well, I told you I had a bad feeling.

223
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:28,929
Any details?
See you later, Barry.

224
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,898
All right there, gorgeous. When do you knock off?

225
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:15,437
~No, please don't go ~ Come in!
-Well hello there!

226
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:20,744
-What do you want?
-Well, I brought you some flowers. Picked 'em myself.

227
00:17:21,443 --> 00:17:22,555
Where's Howard?

228
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:27,788
Oh, he's fine. He just went for a walk on 
Piney Ridge. Left us alone for a while.

229
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,833
-What are you eating?
-Owl beaks. Do you want some?

230
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:33,506
-No, I'm fine.
-Gets you in a mood.

231
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:38,818
-Mood for what?
-Purdy little thing like you and a big old mountain man like me...

232
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:41,203
-Get away from me!
-But I loves you, Vincey!

233
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:44,891
-You're weird, get off me!!
-I love my little Vincey!

234
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:55,094
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!....

235
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:58,449
There you go, Nicky Clarke - hottest you can get!

236
00:17:58,532 --> 00:17:59,265
What's going on?

237
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:03,096
I'll tell you what's going on. I've just narrowly
avoided a bumming from Grizzly Adams!

238
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:08,024
-Where's Howard?
-He went for a walk or something out a Piney ridge.

239
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:11,854
What? Have I got a shit on my face?

240
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:18,441
-Do you think Howard will be all right, Naboo?
-We're going to have to move fast, before the Yetis get him.

241
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:22,529
-What are they going to do to him if they catch him?
-I don't even want to speak it's name.

242
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,411
-All right, we'd better get to Piney ridge quick smart.
-Well, let's get to move on then!

243
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:30,250
-Yeah.. I can't drive.
-I can't drive, either!

244
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:33,089
-I thought you could!
-I thought you could!

245
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:34,737
-Aaaaah...
-Idiots...

246
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:38,537
-Did you bring your magic carpet?
-Howard wouldn't let me pack it - 'one suitcase'!

247
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:41,216
-Oh what are we gonna do?
-Bollo?

248
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:44,215
Come on Bollo, get your monkey anus up at 
the steering wheel.

249
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:46,406
-Bollo no drive.
-You're joking, why not?

250
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:49,111
-Bollo lose licence.
-When did that happen?

251
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:55,198
Long time ago.. It was Chinque. As teenager we 
would drive about down together.

252
00:18:55,242 --> 00:19:01,597
My father warn us, "no drive too fast, for there 
are speed camera on A49."

253
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:09,564
But Chinque crazy. He dangerous. He always say:
 "Please, Bollo. Please let us go faster."

254
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:15,763
-Yeah, yeah, so you chopped his head off, right?
-No. I chopped his feet off. Stopped him pressing accelerator.

255
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,594
Have you got any more stories about Chinque, Bollo? 
Do you mind we should get Howard?

256
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:24,414
-Uh. What are we going to do? Piney Ridge is about 5 hours away on foot.
-Mini cab?

257
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:31,405
-Cheekbone.
-Ooh, cheers! Haha, new issue!

258
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:36,572
The Jacobean ruff's back in. I knew it. Genius!

259
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,661
-Hey, mate, you can't drive, can you?
-Yes.

260
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:40,868
Yes!

261
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:45,126
-Aaaaaaah..
-Speed camera!

262
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:57,354
Howard! Howard!

263
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:03,314
Jeez, I thought Bollo had big feet, look at this!

264
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:06,696
Shit.

265
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:21,918
Now don't panic anyone. I'm a shaman - we've studied Yeties,
 haven't we, Bollo? There's something they don't like, what is it?

266
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:23,343
-Uuuh.. cheese?
-No.

267
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:24,830
-Uuuh.. lipstick?
-No..

268
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,951
-Uuh.. connect-four?
-No!

269
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:32,405
Uuuh.. mirrors! They're scared of their own 
reflection! If only we had a mirror..

270
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,189
-What size do you need?
-What?

271
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:37,984
Well, do you want a hand held, full length, make-up 
mirror, this one's good for close-ups.

272
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:39,436
Great, give me that.

273
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,963
-Actually, I think that was unicorns..
-Nice try.

274
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:55,918
Kalamalooo...Cachoola, Panto, Tatsita, Sacoolo, Fanto.

275
00:20:55,969 --> 00:21:00,720
-We thougt you've been killed!
-What? By these guys? They're peaceful.

276
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:05,672
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with 
your eyes? You look weird, Howard.

277
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:15,542
Howard? Oh yes, I remember him. Paranoid. At odds 
with himself. He's gone now. Say hello to Parsley.

278
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,493
-Parsley? What's the matter with you?
-I feel free inside.

279
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:24,469
-That's great Parsley, let's get out of here.
-Whoa there, what's the rush? Stay a while.

280
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,532
-This is my home now.
-What - in the woods?

281
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:32,597
-Come! Let me show you.
-You've gone insane!

282
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:38,763
I resisted at first, but now the rhythms of the forest 
flow through me, and they can flow through you, too.

283
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:47,557
~ Follow me, forget the world. 
Look around at the wonders of nature ~

284
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:58,867
~ Never fear, everything is here. 
And you don't need your friends or family ~

285
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:03,636
~ We are family ~

286
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:13,820
~ Come with me and then you will see.
 Everything you need within life ~

287
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,913
~ Hey, ho, it's easy letting go.
When nothing before was real ~

288
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:31,288
~ Look into our eyes, you can see the future. 
Look into our eyes, we can see your soul ~

289
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:35,223
~ We will be together. 
Everything is here ~

290
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:37,470
-He's gone wrong!
-I know, he's in a trance.

291
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:40,621
It's all part of the ritual - it's what they 
do before they breed with you.

292
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:43,125
-What's Bollo doing?!
-Aah, he's gone too..

293
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:49,620
Listen, Vince, this is Yeti magic, don't listen to the hippie
nonsense. You're a punk, stay punk, think of Johnny Thunders.

294
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:52,266
-Right.
-Mick and Keith. Block it out.

295
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:57,219
-Okay, but what about you, Naboo?
-Don't worry about me, I'm a shaman. My minds like a fortress.

296
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:05,049
~ Listen to your heart, everything is good here.
Nothing before was real ~

297
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:15,312
~ Never fear, everything is here. 
And you don't need your friends or family ~

298
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:23,446
~ Listen to your heart, it's easy letting go.
 We are family, we are family ~

299
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:32,556
~ Look into our eyes, you can see the future. 
Look into our eyes, we can see your soul ~

300
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:40,853
~ Hey, ho, it's easy letting go. 
When nothing before was real ~

301
00:23:41,372 --> 00:23:48,691
~ Listen to your heart, everything is good here. 
Nothing before was real ~

302
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:58,569
~ Listen to your heart, everything is good here. 
Listen to your heart, everything is good.. ~

303
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,697
-Huh?
-Run for your lives!

304
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,514
-Where am I?
-Aaaaargh! I've got bunches!

305
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:05,889
Where's my turban?

306
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:13,232
It's the gueen and she's horny as hell! 
Run little Vincey, I'll save you!

307
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,663
Come here, you little Yeti-biatch!

308
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:19,702
Biatch?!

309
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:27,204
No, no... uh.. aaaargh!

310
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:34,411
Aaaargh, oh little to the left, oh yeah..
Vince I didn't get your email!

311
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,054
Wait for me!

312
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:20,043
Security to aisle seven, please.

313
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:12,172
-Sorry..
-Aaaaargh..

314
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:24,498
-Malt loaf.
-What?

315
00:26:24,546 --> 00:26:26,970
-Malt loaf.
-What are you talking about?

316
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:31,441
-It's what the Yeties are afraid of!
-Great, just in time there, Naboo.

317
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:34,821
I had some of as well, it's on the GI diet.

318
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:38,544
-Can we go to the Goofy lounge next year?
-That's fine by me.

319
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:46,255
-Thank you!
-Good day sir.

320
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,511
New Global Explorer's in. Hahahaaa..

321
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,279
I don't believe it!

322
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:58,623
Vince Noir finds Yeti! Hahaha cool!

323
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,874
I say, old bean, would you be kind enough 
to sign a copy for my wife?

324
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,718
-No problem.
-Make it out to Allan.

325
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:10,470
-There you go.
-Thank you.

326
00:27:12,982 --> 00:27:14,805
Oh dear...
