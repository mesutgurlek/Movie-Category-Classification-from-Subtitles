1
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:38,513
- Hi.
- Hello.

2
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,954
- Who'd you come to see?
- You!

3
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:47,518
Oh, that's swell.

4
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:51,064
- What do you people want?
- Pictures!

5
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:53,759
- Do we have any pictures?
- Well, why don't one of us go see?

6
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:55,165
Okay, I'll be back in a week.

7
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,931
No, he'll be right back.
He'll be right back.

8
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:00,165
Here. Look, Joe. You all ready?

9
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:02,105
All right, now get set.

10
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,437
There they go.

11
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:06,038
Here they...

12
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,445
I'm all right. I'm all right.

13
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:10,477
Go get them!

14
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:18,990
- Goodbye.
- What a town!

15
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:21,584
Boy, you'd think we had made
the first flight to the moon and back.

16
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:23,630
And after every show
the crowds get bigger.

17
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,665
Yeah, remember
when I used to be scared of crowds?

18
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,165
- Yeah.
- No more. I like them.

19
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:29,429
- They're only people.
- That's nice.

20
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:31,628
Hark! Someone's knocking at the door.

21
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,139
- Answer it. Answer it.
- All righty.

22
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:37,108
- Oh, hi, Eddie.
- Well, hello, Eddie.

23
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,235
What's happened to you?

24
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:41,508
It took three cops and a squad of ushers
to get us into the theater.

25
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,014
Boys, I'd like you to meet Miss Lorelei.

26
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,414
- How do you do?
- Hello, Miss Lorelei.

27
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:45,985
How do you do?

28
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:49,356
Oh, that's our boy, the biggest agent
in town and the easiest laugher.

29
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:50,788
Here, watch this.

30
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,855
Miss Lorelei,
I want you to meet my mom and pop.

31
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:57,328
- How do you do?
- I'd like you to meet my mom and pop.

32
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:58,989
They ain't here.

33
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,394
Miss Lorelei's doing a story
for the <i>American Weekly.</i>

34
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:03,402
You boys seem to have more fun
than the customers.

35
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:04,471
Oh, we do.

36
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,267
Isn't it wonderful
when people love their work?

37
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:08,739
- The food is ready.
- Oh, can I fix you a sandwich?

38
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:11,209
- No, I'll just take some notes.
- That's not very nourishing.

39
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:13,712
Here, why don't you try
some of this terrific corned beef

40
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:14,872
- and salami and...
- Now, about my story...

41
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:16,347
Oh, yes, well, sit right down here,

42
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,611
and we'll find out
just how everything came about.

43
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,186
Now, how long have you been
in the business?

44
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,380
- About 12 years.
- 12 years. And where were you born?

45
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,684
- Scranton.
- Scranton?

46
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,156
Oh, that is a coincidence.

47
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,750
- Were you boys born in Scranton?
- No.

48
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,690
Is this your first engagement
at the Paramount?

49
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:32,789
- Oh, I don't work here.
- Then what are you doing here?

50
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,333
I came to get an interview from you.

51
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:36,266
Well, you better hurry up.
We're almost on, dear.

52
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,235
- Now, what would you like to know?
- Hey, fellows, two minutes.

53
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:39,636
Two minutes?
What happened to the time?

54
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,799
You and Pop, you want to go
in the wings and watch the show?

55
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:43,900
Did you leave the props on the piano
in the last show?

56
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:45,569
- Come on.
- I got the horns, Joe.

57
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,806
- What else do we have, we...
- We don't use the horns this show.

58
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:50,213
- Oh, well, hold these, Mama.
- Come on, Miss Lorelei, with us.

59
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:52,217
But I want to know
how you boys got together.

60
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,617
- Well, what about it?
- Well, what do you expect to do next?

61
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:56,121
Oh, we're going to play
some more theaters

62
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:57,690
and keep working, that's all.

63
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,225
- Come on. Jump, jump, jump!
- Come on.

64
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:00,520
This way. Come on through here.

65
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:01,686
Jump. Come on. Don't be...

66
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:03,423
- We gotta go on. Jump!
- Right.

67
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:06,022
- Come on, jump off. Come on!
- That's a good girl.

68
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,532
- Oh, you fraidy cat.
- No, no.

69
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,660
What are you afraid of? Well, we're on!

70
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,102
- You enter from that side.
- And you enter from that side.

71
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:14,401
- And are you ready, Mr. Anthony?
- I sure am, Mr. Miller.

72
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:15,975
- Here we go.
- Right-o.

73
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,644
So here he is, Harvey Miller.

74
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:35,519
Hello.

75
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:41,361
Come on, step to the rear of the bus.
We're coming into 34th Street.

76
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,799
I'd like to say
how very happy and thrilled we are,

77
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:45,929
ladies and gentlemen,

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,167
to be appearing here
at the Paramount Theater,

79
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:50,140
and how nice it is
to see all you nice people.

80
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,438
I could stay out here for hours,

81
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:53,376
but the Italian street singer
is getting old.

82
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,347
So I would like to introduce my buddy,
pal and partner, Mr. Joe Anthony.

83
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,781
Here he is.

84
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,883
Don't you want me to sing a song?

85
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:09,792
Oh, yeah, but I thought you and I
could do a song together both.

86
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:12,695
- Together both?
- Yeah, wouldn't that be splendid?

87
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:14,692
Yeah, that would be peachy.

88
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:15,860
- Oh, shall we do one?
- Yes.

89
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,001
Oh, thank you, Great White Father.

90
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,038
<i>What would you do without me</i>
<i>What would you do, boy</i>

91

<i>What would you do without me</i>

92
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,443
<i>I'd sell my car and hock my ring</i>

93
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:36,387
<i>That's what I'd do without you</i>
<i>That's what I'd do</i>

94

<i>What would you do without me</i>
<i>when I'm gone</i>

97
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:48,262
<i>I'd have no trouble replacing you</i>
<i>I'd just go down to the nearest zoo</i>

98
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:51,338
<i>Oh, that's what I'd do without you</i>
<i>That's what I'd do</i>

99
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:52,427

<i>What would you do without me</i>

105
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,483
<i>When my bankroll's gone</i>

106
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:13,253
<i>You're always telling me where to go</i>

107

117
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:09,543

00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,294
Then it must be Mr. Miller's family
has the theatrical background?

121
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:33,737
No, no, but you ask me, I tell you.

122
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:35,809
When Harvey is younger,

123
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,504
his papa is number one golf champion
in the whole country.

124
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:42,275
One day it was the final match,

125
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:44,681
Father and Son Tournament.

126
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:47,515
<i>Harvey Miller, Sr., wanted his son to be</i>

127
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:51,523
<i>great golf champion, too,</i>
<i>and follow in his footprints.</i> Capisce?

128
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:53,955
I'll do my best, Dad.

129
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:05,466
- I'm sorry, Dad. I missed the cup.
- That was a great drive, Harvey.

130
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:06,869
Thank you.

131
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,945
Remember, they're only people.

132
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,116
What's the matter with you? Hit it.

133
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:28,991
- Those people are staring at me, Dad.
- Don't look at them. Look at the ball.

134
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:30,654
- Look at the ball?
- Yes.

135
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:39,671
- Now, what's the matter?
- It looked back.

136
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:41,968
Now, Harvey, hit that ball.

137
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:46,808
Hit it! Hit it!

138
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:48,142
Hit it! Hit it!

139
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:49,806
Hit it! Hit it!

140
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,477
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

141
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:54,918
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

142
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:01,887
Now what about your son, Mr. Anthony?

143
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:04,463
Well, I feel like Harvey's papa.

144
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:07,125
<i>I want Joe to follow in my footprints.</i>

145
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,702
Jump in, Joe. We're gonna cast off.

146
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:12,169
Pop, I don't want to fish anymore.
I get seasick.

147
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:13,466
You crazy.

148
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:15,235
Your grandpapa don't get seasick,

149
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:18,505
your papa don't get seasick,
you don't get seasick.

150
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:20,370
I don't feel so good already.

151
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:22,574
But, Joe, we don't leave the dock yet.

152
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:24,651
Here, you eat something.

153
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,616
- You'll feel better.
- Oh, Pop.

154
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,745
You may be the sickest fisherman
in the ocean,

155
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,551
but you're gonna be a fisherman.

156
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,125
Look, Pop,
you can't treat me like a kid any longer.

157
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:34,524
I'm grown up.

158
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:36,994
From now on,
I'm gonna stand on my own two feet.

159
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:38,655
But on dry land!

160
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:43,066
- Joe! Joe! You come back here!
- Joe, Joe.

161
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,607
<i>Four years later, Joe is a big boy,</i>
<i>but his sea legs no good.</i>

162
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:47,266
<i>Four years later, Joe is a big boy,</i>
<i>but his sea legs no good.</i>

163
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:49,535
<i>He wanna try his land legs.</i>

164
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:52,742
<i>So he leave home</i>
<i>to take all kind of job.</i>

165
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:56,179
<i>He work very hard,</i>
<i>but he don't like digging ditch.</i>

166
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:00,553
Anthony, you're through.

167
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:02,417
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

168
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:04,650
<i>And the boss is always picking on him.</i>

169
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:08,353
<i>Joe finally know</i>
<i>just what he want to do with life.</i>

170
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:10,487
I wanna go home to San Francisco.
How about it?

171
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:12,155
Hop in.

172
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,664
<i>He was plenty smart.</i>

173
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:19,302
<i>In four years,</i>
<i>Harvey grow up into a big boy, too.</i>

174
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:21,636
<i>He hope some day</i>
<i>to marry my daughter, Lisa.</i>

175
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:24,370
<i>But that golf, it was still in his blood.</i>

176
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:27,276
- What time is it, Mr. Fisher?
- Two minutes to 12:00, Harvey.

177
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:28,405
Wow.

178
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:30,749
- Mr. Miller.
- Yes, Mr. Baxter?

179
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:32,819
Take lunch one hour later today.

180
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,286
Oh, but, Skin...
But, Mr. Baxter, I got tickets to see...

181
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:38,085
No buts, Miller. Your lunch is at 1:00.

182
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,852
- Lisa...
- Harvey, did Mr. Baxter speak to you?

183
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:45,830
- Yeah, come on, we're going to lunch.
- Oh, but, Harvey, we can't. Mr. Baxter...

184
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,195
I don't care what Mr. Baxter said, Lisa.

185
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,461
We've got tickets to see
Ben Hogan play,

186
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:50,503
and we're going to see him play.
Now, come on.

187
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:51,798
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

188
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:53,930
<i>This is Wendell Niles bringing you</i>
<i>a play-by-play account</i>

189
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,737
<i>of the San Francisco Open.</i>
<i>It's a beautiful California day</i>

190
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,435
<i>and everybody's having</i>
<i>a wonderful time.</i>

191
00:10:58,545 --> 00:11:00,479
<i>Ben Hogan is stepping up</i>
<i>to the ball now.</i>

192
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:01,878
<i>There's the back swing.</i>

193
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:04,542
<i>The ball is in the air and it's beautiful!</i>
<i>It's underneath that...</i>

194
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:08,178
It's funny, Lisa. Crowds don't seem
to bother Mr. Hogan.

195
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:12,488
I don't want to be a killjoy,
Harvey, darling,

196
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:15,585
but I'm worried about our jobs
at the store.

197
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:17,755
You know how Mr. Baxter is
about employees

198
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:20,458
taking too much time for lunch.

199
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:23,593
Harvey, I'm worried about Mr. Baxter.

200
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:24,898
Why, has he shot yet?

201
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:27,565
Mr. Baxter, our boss, who could fire you

202
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:30,302
just like all the other Mr. Baxters
in your life.

203
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,571
And then we'll never be able
to get married.

204
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,010
Oh, don't worry about money, Lisa.

205
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:36,139
I bet a whole two weeks' salary
on Mr. Hogan.

206
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,410
Harvey, you didn't!

207
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:40,008
<i>... right through that clump of trees</i>
<i>or under a low-hanging bow.</i>

208
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,712
<i>What a tough break for Ben.</i>

209
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:44,916
How about us? Two weeks' salary.

210
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:48,391
Harvey, what are we going to do?

211
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:52,998
Come with me, Lisa.

212
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,360
Give me a nine-iron, please.

213
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:03,673
Mr. Hogan.

214
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:10,177
Mr. Hogan,
this is a very important shot to me.

215
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:11,308
And to me.

216
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,852
Well, this is a very fast green,
Mr. Hogan,

217
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:15,319
and you're gonna need
a lot of backspin.

218
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:16,855
So I suggest you use your wedge.

219
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,357
Well, if you don't mind,
I'll use the nine-iron.

220
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:22,656
I just thought I'd mention it.
My name is Harvey Miller, Jr.

221
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:24,594
- How are you, Harvey?
- I'm fine. How are you, Mr. Hogan?

222
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:26,893
- How's the family?
- Fine, thank you.

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,991
- That's swell.
- Come on, son. Let Mr. Hogan shoot.

224
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:30,865
All right.

225
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,235
That's a wedge shot, Mr. Hogan.

226
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:43,846
- See what I mean, Mr. Hogan?
- You're so right.

227
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,783
You see, I played this course
many times with my Dad and I...

228
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:48,252
- Come on, boy, off...
- You're not Mr. Hogan.

229
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:50,050
Now take your hands off me.

230
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,658
Hurry up and change.

231
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:05,103
I'll just push the clock back a little bit,
so old Skinhead won't know.

232
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:07,469
Old Skinhead does know.

233
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:09,906
Well, don't tell... Mr. Baxter!

234
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,841
Miller. Miller.

235
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:14,611
Miller!

236
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:17,749
- Miller?
- Yes, Mr. Baxter.

237
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:19,614
We're having a terrific run
on birds today.

238
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,381
- Birds?
- Badminton birds.

239
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:23,353
Miller, why?

240
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:26,654
Why did you take three hours for lunch?

241
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,954
Well, you see, Mr. Baxter,

242
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:31,087
I go to this terrific little restaurant
in Dallas, Texas.

243
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,933
Dallas, Texas! You...

244
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,206
- Miss Anthony.
- Yes, Mr. Baxter?

245
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:46,779
You're fired.

246
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,847
Oh.

247
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:49,272
Oh, Mr. Baxter.

248
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:56,746
- Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson.
- Hello, Harvey.

249
00:13:56,857 --> 00:13:59,951
- It's a nice day, ain't it, Mr. Johnson?
- Yes, it is, Harvey.

250
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:04,792
Watch where you're going, boy.

251
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:06,160
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Phillips.

252
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:08,393
I guess I was going
where I wasn't looking.

253
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:10,163
- Miller.
- Oh.

254
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,931
Look out! Help, help!

255
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:14,640
Put that ladder back there, you...

256
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,315
Miller!

257
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:35,583
Miller!

258
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:44,197
Miller!

259
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:46,272
Mr. Baxter, please don't hit me.

260
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:48,307
I didn't do nothing, Mr. Baxter.

261
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:50,000
I was just out and I...

262
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,772
All right, reach, Baxter.

263
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:58,375
Now, now, now, Miller.

264
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:02,054
It's a different story now, ain't it, Baxter?

265
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:04,555
Yeah, we...
We were just having a little fun.

266
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:07,627
You were having a little fun, Skinhead.

267
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:09,718
Skinhead... Yes.

268
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,958
It's a different story now.
The shoe's on the other foot.

269
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,694
All right,
you had your chance then, Baxter.

270
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:18,202
- Now, Miller!
- Mr. Baxter!

271
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:26,075
Oh, I'm sorry.
You look just like a rhinoceros.

272
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:30,314
Wait, I did it and I'll fix it.

273
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:31,742
Here.

274
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:34,814
Miller.

275
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:36,912
- One second, Mr. Baxter.
- Yeah.

276
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,820
- Miller, Miller, Miller.
- No, it's all right.

277
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:41,155
No, I got it. Now, just... That's fine.

278
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:42,785
Miller.

279
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:47,390
- I'm going to get it now.
- Miller.

280
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,731
Here it comes, Mr. Baxter. All right.

281
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:55,473
We got it, didn't we?
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

282
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,202
Mr. Baxter!

283
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:00,336
Got off those skates! Miller!

284
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,106
Come back here.

285
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:05,207
Now, listen, Miller...

286
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,121
Miller, that's not funny.

287
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:12,191
Miller!

288
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:17,227
Get off of there, Miller! Get off of there!

289
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:21,792
Not the China Department!
Not in the China Department!

290
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:24,666
It's all right, Mr. Baxter.
I won't hit anything!

291
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:36,343
Miller.

292
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:38,007
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter!

293
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,033
- Mr. Baxter?
- Yes?

294
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:59,902
- I'd like to give my two weeks' notice.
- Well, that will be...

295
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:01,207
Get out.

296
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:01,502
Get out.

297
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,206
- Harvey.
- Yeah?

298
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,144
Where's that winning smile?
Come on, let's see that dimple.

299
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:11,445
No, I'm no good for anything, Lisa.
I'll never smile again.

300
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:13,746
Harvey Miller, is that any way to talk?

301
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:15,718
It's the only way I know how.

302
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:18,823
Look, all great men
have had to go through bad times.

303
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,859
You've read about them in books.

304
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:24,897
Then when you're famous,
why you'll... You'll look back and laugh.

305
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:26,699
Ha, ha, ha.

306
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,731
Just say I'm no good for anything.

307
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:31,269
I let you down.

308
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:33,566
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

309
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,436
Harvey Miller,
you're no good for anything.

310
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,373
You've let me down.

311
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:40,171
Gee, it sounds <i>awful</i> when you say it.

312
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:43,346
I wish my brother Joe was here.

313
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,352
He's had a lot of experience in business
and he could help you find yourself.

314
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,354
I ain't even lookin' for myself.

315
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:51,390
All I know is golf.

316
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,391
And I sure wish I could forget it.

317
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:55,593
- Hey.
- What?

318
00:17:55,695 --> 00:17:57,185
Why forget it?

319
00:17:57,297 --> 00:17:58,730
- Huh?
- Teach it.

320
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:02,563
Why, with all you know about golf,
you'd be a cinch to open a school.

321
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:05,805
You can stand people one at a time,
can't you?

322
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:07,163
Yeah.

323
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:09,769
Gee, that's a good idea, Lisa.

324
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,206
Boy, if I ever amount to anything,

325
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:17,249
you'll be the woman behind the man
that made the man behind the gun

326
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,081
who loved the woman behind the man
behind the gun.

327
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:24,785
I got carried away.

328
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:27,386
- Goodnight, Harvey.
- Goodnight, Lisa.

329
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,821
Goodnight, Lisa.

330
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:32,854
You know what?

331
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:35,867
The first thing in the morning,
I'm gonna get organized.

332
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:37,300
Goodnight, Lisa.

333
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:39,236
Goodnight, Harvey.

334
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:52,216
Mama reserved the church for February,
but she can postpone it again.

335
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:53,945
Maybe she won't...

336
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:57,348
Maybe she won't have to.
Once I get my school started...

337
00:18:57,457 --> 00:18:58,947
- That's right, Harvey.
- Uh-huh!

338
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:07,360
Goodnight, Harvey.

339
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,233
Goodnight.

340
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:15,905
Excuse me.

341
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:17,977
I got carried away again.

342
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:01,613
Thanks a lot, pal.

343
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,985
Don't make too much noise.
Don't want to wake the folks.

344
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,251
I haven't been home in years.

345
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,103
Hey.

346
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:03,573
This is my room.

347
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,009
You're in my bed.

348
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:08,518
Excuse me.

349
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:11,924
Hey!

350
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:45,421
See you tonight, Lisa.

351
00:21:52,198 --> 00:21:53,825
Ma! Pop!

352
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:55,730
Ma! Pop! Lisa!

353
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:57,598
Joe! Hey, Mama!

354
00:21:57,704 --> 00:21:59,194
Joe!

355
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:02,671
Joe, it's wonderful you're back.

356
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:05,706
You know,
there's somebody in this house.

357
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:08,474
- You wait, I get my harpoon gun.
- Come on, let's...

358
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:11,979
- I found him in my bed. He looks nutty.
- Oh, no, Joe.

359
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,584
I don't know who he is.

360
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:16,780
That's it.

361
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:20,482
- That's Harvey.
- That's Harvey.

362
00:22:20,593 --> 00:22:21,582
Harvey?

363
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:23,855
You're away from home
so we rent him your room, Joe.

364
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:26,397
- Yes. He's nice boy.
- Sure, he's a nice boy.

365
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:28,160
Come on, we fix Joe something to eat.

366
00:22:28,268 --> 00:22:29,394
Yes, yes.

367
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:30,929
Harvey.

368
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:39,343
- Oh, I've seen this before.
- Goodnight, Harvey.

369
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:46,611
Not me.

370
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:49,846
Goodnight, Lisa.

371
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,683
Lisa, what is that?

372
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:56,159
Better get used to him, Joe.
He's going to be your brother-in-law.

373
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:57,490
That's nice.

374
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:00,392
My brother-in-law?

375
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:04,202
You want some coffee?

376
00:23:04,304 --> 00:23:06,363
- Real hot coffee?
- Warm him up.

377
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:09,873
- Who makes better coffee than Mama?
- Not nobody.

378
00:23:09,976 --> 00:23:11,841
- Papa sometimes.
- Here you are, all finish.

379
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:14,311
It's just like new.
Here, you, you try it on?

380
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:16,604
- There we go.
- Look good, Mama.

381
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:17,978
- How's it look, Pop?
- Very good.

382
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,381
- Good?
- Nice, nice.

383
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:22,010
Oh, Mama,
she's good to have Joe back?

384
00:23:23,556 --> 00:23:27,424
Now, you're home, Joe,
we're gonna throw all these tables out.

385
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:32,455
Pop, here's $5. Buy yourself a new pipe.

386
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:35,728
Oh, Joe.

387
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:39,162
But, Mama, you could buy a new dress?

388
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:48,638
Hey, by the way, Pop,
what does Harvey do for a living?

389
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:51,546
Oh, he's a good boy.
He's no working now.

390
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:54,677
See?

391
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:57,712
Let's try it.

392
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:07,057
Now, take the club back slow and easy.

393
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,796
You should keep your head down, Lisa.

394
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:16,405
Now swing straight out
and follow through.

395
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:22,837
Will you please keep your head down?

396
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:26,483
Let me show you, Lisa.
You stand over there.

397
00:24:31,691 --> 00:24:33,215
$10,000!

398
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:43,936
Hey.

399
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,868
What's going on here?
What're you doing?

400
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:49,840
Harvey's going to be a golf instructor.
I'm his first pupil.

401
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:51,603
Oh, Harvey, this is my brother, Joe.

402
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:53,611
- Oh, hello, Joe.
- Hi, Harvey.

403
00:24:53,713 --> 00:24:55,544
- Hey, you're pretty good.
- Oh, thanks.

404
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:58,412
- He's wonderful.
- Yeah, but why teach?

405
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:01,146
Why don't you play?
You ever read the sports sections?

406
00:25:01,254 --> 00:25:03,222
You can make a lot of money
in those tournaments.

407
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:08,990
- Tournaments, tournaments.
- Tournaments.

408
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:11,655
No, I can't play in front of people.

409
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:14,597
Oh, no, people make him very nervous.
He's high-strung.

410
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,668
Yes, I'm strung very high.

411
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:18,737
Well, you won all those trophies,
didn't you?

412
00:25:18,838 --> 00:25:21,033
Oh, no, those are my father's.
Harvey Miller, Sr.

413
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,698
He was a great golfer.

414
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:27,443
- Are these your father's?
- No. Those are my baby shoes.

415
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:29,912
- Oh, you won these?
- No, I wore them.

416
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:31,677
- You wore them?
- Yeah, I never won anything.

417
00:25:31,784 --> 00:25:35,276
- I tighten up.
- Oh, Harvey, you shouldn't tighten up.

418
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,048
You got to relax.

419
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:40,523
- Don't be jerky.
- I can't help it.

420
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:42,652
Wow.

421
00:25:45,164 --> 00:25:46,358
Wow!

422
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:47,592
Joe, you're good, too.

423
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,691
You think I spend all my time
in poolrooms?

424
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:51,292
You're a natural, just like my Dad.

425
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:54,567
He won $5,000 at Pinehurst,
and $7,000 at Tam O'Shanter,

426
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:56,574
and $20,000 at Inverness,
and besides that,

427
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:59,509
there's sporting goods companies with
endorsements and exhibition games.

428
00:25:59,612 --> 00:26:01,477
- Go ahead.
- I'm out of breath.

429
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:02,980
You'd make a wonderful combination.

430
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:05,915
Yeah, and there's a tournament opening
in Santa Barbara in a couple of weeks.

431
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:07,508
You could be the player
and I could be the caddy.

432
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,144
There's a $500 prize.

433
00:26:09,622 --> 00:26:11,180
Gee, that'd buy us a lot of furniture.

434
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,951
It would mean work, work
and more work.

435
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:14,287
You have to bear down.

436
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:16,520
You know, I think you're running a fever.

437
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:19,689
- I'm no golfer.
- All you have to do is practice.

438
00:26:22,702 --> 00:26:24,101
Hey, what's the matter?

439
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:27,036
I'm gonna get the police
and make you pay for the mess!

440
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,332
He's coming, he's coming.

441
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:34,136
Ma?

442
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:38,709
Ma? Will you sew a button on for me?

443
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:45,788
Harvey, hurry up with the cake.
Hurry up.

444
00:26:49,162 --> 00:26:50,424
- Oh.
- Hey.

445
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:54,458
- Hey, what's going on here?
- It says "Welcome home, <i>Joe. Amore."</i>

446
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,034
- That means...
- Love.

447
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:59,534
- It's Italian. How'd you know?
- I used to work here.

448
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:03,267
Take back the cake.
He used to work here.

449
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:06,707
Home from your triumphal tour, Joe?

450
00:27:06,913 --> 00:27:09,279
And this time is for good, too.

451
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,851
Joe, like old time,
you sing a song for Mama.

452
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:15,318
Oh, no, Mom.
Not in front of all these people.

453
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:17,514
Joe! You sing for Mama.

454
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:24,192
<i>In Napoli where love is king</i>

455
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:29,166
<i>When boy meets girl</i>
<i>here's what they sing</i>

456
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:39,604
<i>When the moon hits your eye</i>
<i>like a big pizza pie</i>

457
00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:41,441
<i>That's amore</i>

458
00:27:43,382 --> 00:27:47,341
<i>When the world seems to shine</i>
<i>like you've had too much wine</i>

462
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,861

Oh, Joe.

509
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:41,751
Everybody sit down!

510
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:44,526
- Come on.
- It's getting cold.

511
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:48,563
You eat, you eat.

512
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,897
I got to make important announcement.

513
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,434
Tonight, I tell you,

514
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:56,997
is the finest night in the whole life
of me and Mama.

515
00:30:58,277 --> 00:31:00,768
Like my papa and me,

516
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,747
soon there gonna be another fisherman
in the family.

517
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:08,009
Congratulations, Mama.
Do you feel all right?

518
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,055
Oh, Harvey. You're crazy.

519
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,720
We're gonna have back with us

520
00:31:15,828 --> 00:31:19,264
the second most finest fisherman
in all California.

521
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:20,525
My son, Joe.

522
00:31:22,668 --> 00:31:24,932
But last night I got to thinking,

523
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:28,302
old boat not big enough
for two big fishermen like us,

524
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:31,399
so I talk to Mr. Spezzato this afternoon.

525
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,139
And I'm proud to say
he sold me the <i>Santa Clara.</i>

526
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:37,306
And I give Papa a good trade-in, Joe.

527
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:41,682
What's the matter, Captain?
All we owe is $500 cash.

528
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:46,455
$500? But, Pop,
why didn't you ask me first?

529
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,617
But you come home.

530
00:31:47,726 --> 00:31:49,591
You stop running around the country
like a hobo.

531
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:51,060
You come home for good, no?

532
00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:54,155
Well, even if I did,
I don't want to be a fisherman.

533
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:56,257
Then what you gonna do?

534
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:02,340
I'm gonna play golf.

535
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:03,931
He's gonna play golf?

536
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:06,603
Golf? What's a golf?

537
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:09,442
What's a golf? I mean, what's golf?

538
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,610
You hit a little ball with a stick.

539
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:14,117
You don't want be a fisherman, huh?

540
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,814
You want to hit a little ball
with a stick? Why?

541
00:32:16,922 --> 00:32:18,184
There's a lot of money in it.

542
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,814
Sure, Pop.
If I win a couple tournaments,

543
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:22,257
I could fish for ten years
and never make that kind of money.

544
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:23,726
And I bet you never heard
of Ben Hogan.

545
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:25,854
He won $10,000 in two days
at Pinehurst.

546
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:28,729
You want to make a living
hitting a little ball with a stick?

547
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:31,530
And Harvey's father
won $20,000 at Inverness.

548
00:32:31,637 --> 00:32:33,571
And Jimmy Thomson won $5,000
at Tam O'Shanter.

549
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:35,765
Oh, they won all this money, huh?
For what?

550
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,309
- For hit a little ball with a stick.
- Harvey.

551
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,674
- Well, that's what he said.
- Well, he knows how to say it.

552
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,713
- Papa, Joe could be a great golfer.
- <i>Si...</i>

553
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:44,214
I can see it all now.

554
00:32:44,316 --> 00:32:47,717
We're on the course at Pinehurst.
There's a thousand people following us.

555
00:32:47,987 --> 00:32:51,150
We're ready to tee off on the last hole.
Now, I hand Joe the club.

556
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:53,691
He walks up to the ball
very nonchalantly.

557
00:32:54,026 --> 00:32:56,358
He takes aim, he swings

558
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:58,396
and it's a screamer
right down the fairway.

559
00:32:58,497 --> 00:32:59,521
Fore!

560
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,462
Then I hand him his niblick.

561
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:04,593
- What's a niblick?
- That's a littler stick.

562
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:06,466
Now, he hits the ball right up
on the green.

563
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:08,096
It's about 25 feet from the cup.

564
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:10,732
Now, if he sinks this, he beats Hogan.
He'll be the new champ.

565
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:14,074
He aims, he putts
and the ball is going right for the cup.

566
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,774
It's at the cup and it rims the edge
and goes around,

567
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:21,546
and around and around and around...

568
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:25,322
- But it doesn't go in.
- It don't go in?

569
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,289
But, wait. Hogan putts.

570
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:32,226
He hits his ball, and it knocks
Joe's ball right into the cup!

571
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:35,767
- It's in, it's in. We won.
- Sure we won. He's my son, no?

572
00:33:36,735 --> 00:33:38,293
And they take him up
to the Judge's Stand

573
00:33:38,404 --> 00:33:40,531
and they give him this trophy.
He's the new champion.

574
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:42,732
Then they present him
with a $10,000 check.

575
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:44,069
- Bravo.
- I take it,

576
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:46,906
and, Pop, I give you some money
to pay off the new boat.

577
00:33:47,012 --> 00:33:51,415
I buy Mom a mink.
And you two send your kids to Harvard.

578
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,815
They'll be doctors.

579
00:34:02,094 --> 00:34:04,153
You trying to kill me, Joe?

580
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,831
That's enough for today, Joe.

581
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,538
Here we are, Joe.
Let's go in and register.

582
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,970
Okay with me.

583
00:34:20,312 --> 00:34:22,837
Hey, dig this rug.
They really live it up here, huh?

584
00:34:22,948 --> 00:34:24,540
Oh, yeah, my Dad used to take me
to all these places

585
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,414
when I was a kid, and he said
it's very important to socialize.

586
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,952
So mix, mingle.

587
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:30,043
- Hello.
- Hello.

588
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,986
- Hi.
- Names, please.

589
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:34,889
This is Joe Anthony,
and I'm Harvey Miller, Jr.

590
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:37,588
Joe Anthony.
Yes, entered from San Francisco.

591
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,663
Uh-huh.

592
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:42,229
But I don't see any Harvey Miller, Jr.

593
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,323
No.

594
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:45,630
Oh, that's right. Joe's the player.
I'm his caddy.

595
00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:47,662
The caddy house is next door, son.

596
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:52,035
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- Wait a minute. We're partners.

597
00:34:52,144 --> 00:34:54,635
- Lf he can't stay, I don't stay.
- Oh, no, Joe.

598
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:56,305
Will you excuse me just a second?

599
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:58,883
Now, Joe, don't worry about me.
I'll be all right.

600
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:01,282
We caddies have
an <i>awful</i> lot of fun together.

601
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:05,585
And you belong here and I belong there.
We'll be together.

602
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:08,717
- Thank you very much, sir.
- The caddy house is that way.

603
00:35:09,895 --> 00:35:11,590
You told me before.

604
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:16,767
- I'd better go along with him.
- Take my word for it. He'll be all right.

605
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:19,269
Come on, I'll introduce you around.

606
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:23,507
Mr. Anthony, Bruce Reeber.

607
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:24,667
- How are you?
- Hi.

608
00:35:24,777 --> 00:35:26,267
- Gaston Leron.
- How do you do?

609
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:28,175
- Sidney Benthall.
- How do you do?

610
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:32,282
Jonathan Preen and Harry Bell.

611
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:33,373
How are you?

612
00:35:33,485 --> 00:35:35,316
- I'm Kathy Taylor.
- Hi.

613
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:38,583
Mr. Anthony is from San Francisco.

614
00:35:38,691 --> 00:35:40,921
Say, if you're from San Francisco,
you must know Ted Kohler

615
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:43,517
- of Kohler, Heisler and Dodge.
- No, I don't.

616
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:45,790
Oh, but you must,
if you play at the Bay City Country Club.

617
00:35:45,898 --> 00:35:46,990
I don't.

618
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:49,001
- What club do you represent up there?
- None.

619
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:49,990
- What club do you represent up there?
- None.

620
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:52,900
I know now. You played
in the Phoenix Open, didn't you?

621
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:56,497
- No.
- Anthony. Anthony. San Francisco.

622
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:58,542
- What business is your family in?
- Fish.

623
00:35:58,644 --> 00:35:59,941
Importing or exporting?

624
00:36:01,013 --> 00:36:02,241
- Catching.
- Oh.

625
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:08,887
I beg your pardon,
I would like to know if I could...

626
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:13,053
I beg your pardon, I would...

627
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:15,860
I beg your pardon!

628
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:19,027
I'm sorry.

629
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:25,630
I would like to know
if I can have a locker.

630
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:28,400
Hey, you're quite a tomboy, aren't you?

631
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,440
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah?

632
00:36:36,215 --> 00:36:38,080
Well, sticks and stones will
break my bones,

633
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:40,242
and names'll never harm me.

634
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,918
- Could I have a locker?
- Yeah, down that way, buddy.

635
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:46,582
- Thank you, sir. You're a gentleman.
- Thank you.

636
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:51,091
Come on, we got a pigeon. Come on.

637
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:57,996
Well, look at skinny-boy.

638
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:01,063
- Is it alive?
- You get out of here!

639
00:37:01,173 --> 00:37:02,936
- All right.
- No, it's not.

640
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:06,237
Oh, brother.

641
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:38,209
Boo.

642
00:37:40,012 --> 00:37:41,570
Go on, get out of here!

643
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:43,475
Go ahead.

644
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:02,500
Hello, fellas.

645
00:38:43,242 --> 00:38:44,573
Wise guy.

646
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:46,771
Smart aleck.

647
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:52,641
Soap.

648
00:39:01,894 --> 00:39:04,055
Towel. Towel.

649
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:08,228
Towel. Towel.

650
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:11,261
- I didn't even finish.
- I didn't even enter.

651
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:15,170
Won't you...

652
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,602
Hey, buddy, you got a towel?
Somebody took mine.

653
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,813
Oh, thanks.

654
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:25,281
You got <i>awful</i> small caddies here.

655
00:39:25,684 --> 00:39:27,242
I got soap in my eyes.

656
00:39:28,153 --> 00:39:31,350
I went over to get some water
and there wasn't any.

657
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:34,559
It's murder when you get soap
in your eyes

658
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,926
and you can't get to the water to wash

659
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:41,431
and I'm in my...

660
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,694
- Young man!
- I know, it's this way.

661
00:39:44,703 --> 00:39:46,898
Oh, that kid! I love him! He...

662
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:49,473
<i>Those of you who tuned in late,</i>
<i>this is Tom Harmon</i>

663
00:39:49,574 --> 00:39:52,566
<i>reporting on the Santa Barbara Open,</i>
<i>with Joe Anthony...</i>

664
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,146
Again, Papa.
I told you we need a new one.

665
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:59,979
You wait. I make fix. Work like a charm.

666
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:02,849
<i>Joe Anthony approaches the ball.</i>

667
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:06,482
<i>His caddy is down behind the ball,</i>
<i>lining it up on his stomach.</i>

668
00:40:09,094 --> 00:40:11,221
<i>He goes over to the golf bag,</i>

669
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,321
- <i>gets out a whisk broom.</i>
- Wait one second, Joe.

670
00:40:13,432 --> 00:40:15,161
- <i>He starts to brush a path to the cup.</i>
- Take it easy now.

671
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,997
Harvey? Will you
get out of the way, Harv?

672
00:40:18,103 --> 00:40:20,264
<i>Anthony waits very patiently.</i>

673
00:40:21,473 --> 00:40:24,135
<i>He's now by the hole</i>
<i>and he's lining up the...</i>

674
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:26,676
It's about two feet on your right.
Don't be nervous.

675
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,805
<i>He approaches the ball.</i>

676
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:31,974
<i>He putts.</i>

677
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:34,484
<i>There it goes. It's rolling, rolling.</i>

678
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:37,612
It goes round and round and in!

679
00:40:37,723 --> 00:40:39,247
Attaboy, Joe!

680
00:40:43,428 --> 00:40:45,259
Nice going, Anthony, old boy.

681
00:40:45,364 --> 00:40:46,831
- Nice putt, Joe.
- Congratulations.

682
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:48,832
- We'll see you at the party, Kathy?
- I'll be there.

683
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:51,198
Oh, Mr. Anthony,
won't you join us at the party?

684
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:52,668
- Well...
- No?

685
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:55,638
- Yes.
- Hey, Joe, you were absolutely...

686
00:40:55,741 --> 00:40:57,470
- Oh, very nice officialing, sir.
- Yes.

687
00:40:57,576 --> 00:40:59,168
Will you get out of here?

688
00:40:59,277 --> 00:41:00,972
Oh, all right.
I don't want to disturb anything, Joe,

689
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,706
so I'll see you back at the...

690
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:04,714
At the home.

691
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:07,250
- You thought I was going to say motel.
- Okay, goodbye, Harvey.

692
00:41:07,352 --> 00:41:08,785
Nice round, Mr. Anthony.

693
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:10,184
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

694
00:41:10,288 --> 00:41:13,018
- Give us one more, Joe.
- Turn on the charm, Mr. Anthony.

695
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,650
Give them the full force
of your personality.

696
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:16,887
Fine.

697
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:24,565
"Welcome Home, Champ."
Wonder who that's for?

698
00:41:24,669 --> 00:41:27,263
Oh, that's for Joe.
We gotta celebrate, don't we?

699
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:29,033
- Joe! Hi.
- Hi.

700
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:32,477
- That smells good.
- It is good.

701
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:35,512
Just like Mama makes. She taught me.

702
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:38,014
"For Joe." Hey, what is this?

703
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:41,309
Open it up, Joe.

704
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:48,690
- Oh, a new cap.
- No, that was my Dad's.

705
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:51,558
- But it's yours now.
- Thanks.

706
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:52,925
Try it on.

707
00:41:58,904 --> 00:42:02,237
- Fits just like a glove.
- It sure does. Thanks, Harvey.

708
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,741
Oh, that's okay.
And here's something else.

709
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:09,712
I want you to have this.
My Dad won this at Inverness.

710
00:42:09,815 --> 00:42:11,612
You know the old saying
"money comes to money,"

711
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:13,980
- maybe cups will come to cups.
- Thank you.

712
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:15,075
That's all right.

713
00:42:15,187 --> 00:42:17,587
- Yeah, but I have a party...
- Yeah, it is sort of like a party, Joe,

714
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:19,657
and I got the wide noodles
you like so well.

715
00:42:19,758 --> 00:42:21,157
No, you shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble.

716
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:22,226
Oh, it's all right, Joe.

717
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,920
A man that's under pressure
should have things he likes.

718
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,588
And it's good for the stomach, too.

719
00:42:26,698 --> 00:42:27,858
After this, we'll have a couple of scoops

720
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:30,560
of that terrific chocolate crunch
ice cream and we'll hit the sack.

721
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:34,261
Yeah, but Kathy Taylor invited me
to the club dance.

722
00:42:34,372 --> 00:42:35,600
Kathy Taylor?

723
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:37,302
Kathy Taylor.

724
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,704
Oh, that nice girl from the country club.
Oh, yes.

725
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:44,470
Oh, no! You can't go out, Joe.
You're in training.

726
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,608
Well, all the other fellows are going.

727
00:42:46,718 --> 00:42:48,913
Well, gee, Joe. I'm supposed
to be your manager, isn't that right?

728
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,987
Yeah.

729
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:53,090
And I'm supposed to specify
whether you can go out or not.

730
00:42:53,191 --> 00:42:54,158
Sure.

731
00:42:54,526 --> 00:42:57,427
Oh, Harvey, I wouldn't do anything
to hurt our chances.

732
00:42:57,529 --> 00:42:59,895
You'll dance until your legs are wobbly.

733
00:43:00,365 --> 00:43:03,596
You're right. I'll sit out every dance.

734
00:43:03,702 --> 00:43:05,602
That's twice as tiring.

735
00:43:05,704 --> 00:43:07,968
Oh, Harvey, I'll be home early.

736
00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:12,075
- 11:00?
- 11:00.

737
00:43:12,177 --> 00:43:13,940
- Scout's honor?
- Uh-huh.

738
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:15,535
And if you're not home,
can I come after you

739
00:43:15,647 --> 00:43:18,172
- and bring you home?
- Scout's honor.

740
00:43:18,283 --> 00:43:19,341
Okay.

741
00:43:20,218 --> 00:43:23,051
Oh, Harvey. I'm sorry about all this.

742
00:43:23,155 --> 00:43:24,918
Oh, that's all right.

743
00:43:25,524 --> 00:43:27,549
What's the difference, Joe?

744
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:30,321
All I have to do is take off one plate.

745
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:34,130
Anyhow, it'll be good for you to relax.

746
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:35,824
Have some laughs.

747
00:43:36,301 --> 00:43:39,828
- But don't forget your promise.
- 11:00.

748
00:43:39,938 --> 00:43:41,496
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

749
00:44:21,213 --> 00:44:22,544
Excuse me.

750
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,618
- Hello.
- Hello.

751
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,984
Don't you remember me? Kathy Taylor.

752
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:33,319
Girl receptionist. Belle of the links.

753
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:36,155
Oh, yeah. Well, good evening.

754
00:44:36,261 --> 00:44:38,252
I better make that goodnight.
I'm out of uniform.

755
00:44:38,363 --> 00:44:40,058
You're positively stunning.

756
00:44:40,165 --> 00:44:42,599
So what if you left your dinner jacket
at home?

757
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:44,259
I left it in Kansas City.

758
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:46,803
- But I can show you the pawn ticket.
- I believe you.

759
00:44:46,905 --> 00:44:48,805
- Shall we dance?
- Only if I lead.

760
00:44:48,907 --> 00:44:50,340
You can lead.

761
00:44:54,112 --> 00:44:55,545
Good evening.

762
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:07,685
What's the matter?

763
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:10,488
I'm worried about that dinner jacket
in Kansas City,

764
00:45:10,595 --> 00:45:13,564
waiting for you to come back
and you never do.

765
00:45:13,665 --> 00:45:14,927
Don't let that upset you.

766
00:45:15,033 --> 00:45:17,433
I used to wear that
when I was a singing waiter.

767
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:19,162
It's full of beer stains anyhow.

768
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:22,434
And powder, too. And probably tears.

769
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:27,107
Some poor girl waiting for you
to come back and you never do.

770
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:31,310
Better make that plural. Girls.

771
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,340
Here we go again.

772
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,648
The subtle female approach.
"Is he attached or unattached"?

773
00:45:36,755 --> 00:45:40,350
Okay, so you don't like my approach.
What's yours?

774
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:41,618
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

775
00:45:42,294 --> 00:45:45,354
Step number one:
Shall we get a breath of air?

776
00:45:45,964 --> 00:45:47,192
We shall.

777
00:45:50,602 --> 00:45:53,332
I'm worried about step number two.

778
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:55,770
Step number two:
He sings a song at her.

779
00:45:55,874 --> 00:45:56,966
Well.

780
00:45:57,876 --> 00:45:59,810
I'll brace myself.

781
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,980
- Promise to catch me if I faint?
- I promise.

782
00:46:04,182 --> 00:46:08,551
<i>You're the right one</i>

783
00:46:08,653 --> 00:46:12,453
<i>Yes, the right one</i>

784
00:46:12,557 --> 00:46:16,425
<i>I have never been so sure</i>

785
00:46:16,528 --> 00:46:19,520
<i>of anyone before</i>

786
00:46:20,498 --> 00:46:24,332
<i>You're the first time</i>

787
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:29,497
<i>and the last time</i>

788
00:46:29,607 --> 00:46:33,304
<i>You're the one time</i>

789
00:46:33,411 --> 00:46:36,938
<i>there'll be no more</i>

790
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,547
<i>You're the star</i>

791
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,480
<i>That always seemed so far</i>

792
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:53,597
<i>But, darling, here you are</i>

793
00:46:54,165 --> 00:46:58,363
<i>For all the world to see</i>

794
00:47:00,138 --> 00:47:04,802
<i>So, if you love me</i>

795
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:09,571
<i>say you love me</i>

796
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:16,754
<i>For I know that you're the right one</i>

797
00:47:17,856 --> 00:47:20,791
<i>for me</i>

798
00:47:23,228 --> 00:47:26,823
<i>You're the star</i>

<i>that you're the right one</i>

806
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:07,529
<i>The right one</i>

807
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:09,971
<i>For me</i>

808
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:14,374
<i>Know that you're the right one</i>

809
00:48:14,479 --> 00:48:17,209
<i>for me</i>

810
00:48:19,584 --> 00:48:21,711
It's after 11:00.

811
00:48:33,064 --> 00:48:34,088
Joe.

812
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,598
Gee, Joe,
if the Rules Committee ever saw you...

813
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:39,329
Now, get in here.

814
00:48:44,442 --> 00:48:48,173
Come on, Joe.
You can't sleep with your clothes on.

815
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:49,303
How could you do this, Joe?

816
00:48:49,414 --> 00:48:51,609
With the second round
coming up tomorrow.

817
00:48:51,716 --> 00:48:54,480
Don't worry about me,
I'll come out fighting.

818
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:57,384
You're so drunk
you don't even know you're a golfer.

819
00:48:57,489 --> 00:48:59,753
Now, look, if it's golf you want, okay,

820
00:48:59,858 --> 00:49:02,691
but just don't nag, Emma.

821
00:49:03,428 --> 00:49:05,953
Emma? I'm Harvey.

822
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:07,898
Hiya, Harvey.

823
00:49:09,334 --> 00:49:11,802
Well, I thought you was Emma.

824
00:49:13,104 --> 00:49:15,834
- And who are you?
- I'm Emma's husband.

825
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,498
- Oh.
- Don't tell her, though.

826
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:20,043
No. Where do you live?

827
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:24,046
Harvey, my boy, if I tell you,
will you promise not to take me there?

828
00:49:24,148 --> 00:49:27,640
- No.
- Good. I live next door.

829
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:32,849
- Come on, let's go.
- Now, look, Harvey, I insist...

830
00:49:33,725 --> 00:49:37,422
Come on, mister, will you please?
Here. Easy.

831
00:49:37,529 --> 00:49:40,396
Take your pants and your shoes.

832
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:42,932
Easy now. Come on.

833
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:52,471
Hi, Emma.

834
00:49:53,878 --> 00:49:54,936
I don't know where you've been,

835
00:49:55,046 --> 00:49:57,537
but at least you came home
with first prize.

836
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:02,678
Joe.

837
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:08,891
Sing it again.
How about another chorus?

838
00:50:08,993 --> 00:50:11,393
- Sing it again.
- More. Sing it again.

839
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:15,426
<i>Not a cloud in sight</i>

849
00:50:38,957 --> 00:50:42,393
- Harvey.
- Joe, do you realize it's after 11:00?

850
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:45,360
- So what?
- Well, you promised, Joe!

851
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:46,521
Promised what?

852
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:48,394
Well, you promised you'd be home
at 11:00.

853
00:50:48,499 --> 00:50:51,730
- Now, it's after 11:00!
- Harvey, I'm in the middle of a song.

854
00:50:51,836 --> 00:50:54,396
Well, I'm sorry, Joe.
You said you were gonna come home.

855
00:50:54,505 --> 00:50:57,474
Stop the music. Stop the music.

856
00:50:57,575 --> 00:50:59,668
Now, say goodnight to everyone.

857
00:50:59,777 --> 00:51:02,473
Goodnight to everyone.
Goodnight, you all.

858
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:05,071
- Goodnight, everyone.
- Harvey!

859
00:51:05,183 --> 00:51:07,447
Goodnight...

860
00:51:09,554 --> 00:51:13,752
You're very rude and impolite, sir.
What're you laughing at?

861
00:51:13,858 --> 00:51:15,826
- You.
- Well, don't.

862
00:51:15,927 --> 00:51:17,690
You may have a child of your own
some day.

863
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:20,593
What's the matter with you, Harvey?
You shouldn't yell at these people.

864
00:51:20,698 --> 00:51:21,892
They belong here and you don't!

865
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,297
Yeah? Well,
they shouldn't laugh at me, Joe

866
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:25,062
'cause I'm trying
to take good care of you.

867
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:27,603
I appreciate that, Harvey,
but I have to finish the song.

868
00:51:27,705 --> 00:51:31,038
- We can't be impolite and leave now.
- You could if you wanted to.

869
00:51:31,142 --> 00:51:32,200
The music.

870
00:51:33,711 --> 00:51:37,875
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Stop pulling. Let me go.

<i>of the pin.</i>

One putt and he's in,
and there goes the old ball game.

Oh, don't you believe it, Joe.

894
00:52:54,726 --> 00:52:56,660
It just takes a little courage
plus a cool head.

895
00:52:56,761 --> 00:52:58,922
- Now lay one up there.
- You can do it, champ.

Hey, Anthony, it's your shot.

897
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:04,962
Wait a minute, Joe.

898

Come on, Anthony,
you're holding up the game.

899

- Now see here, boy. That's not allowed.

August 23rd, 1886,
at Inverness, Scotland.

- Is there such a rule?
- Well, certainly there is.

Now if you'll excuse us, please?

Please.

Go ahead, Joe.

<i>He lines up the shot. He shoots.</i>

As the winner of our tournament,
you are invited to compete

00:54:04,695 --> 00:54:05,719
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

920
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:06,819
Thanks.

921
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:08,956
Until then you'll be my houseguest
at Carmel.

922
00:54:09,066 --> 00:54:11,159
- No or yes?
- Yes.

923
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:13,635
And last, but certainly not least,

924
00:54:13,738 --> 00:54:17,265
- the Club's check for $500.
- Thank you.

925
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:23,247
Bravo! $500. Paid in full.

926
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:27,849
For the last 10 years,
it has been the custom for the winner

927
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:30,546
to turn over the check
to our charity fund.

928
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,682
I know Mr. Anthony would insist
on following this noble tradition.

929
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:39,085
- Certainly.
- Thank you from all of us.

930
00:54:44,135 --> 00:54:46,695
And, boy, when you sank it
that was really something, Joe.

931
00:54:46,804 --> 00:54:48,101
My dad couldn't have done better.

932
00:54:48,206 --> 00:54:50,606
Oh, it was nothing. It was really nothing.

933
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:53,700
But how is charity gonna get Pop
off the hook for the $500 he owes

934
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:57,269
on the new boat?
And furthermore, how we gonna eat?

935
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,349
But, Joe,
money's not the important thing.

936
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,247
It's the fact that now you're on your way.

937
00:55:01,352 --> 00:55:02,785
I sure am.

938
00:55:02,887 --> 00:55:04,445
And now we're invited to play
in the tournament,

939
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:06,853
and that's $10,000 we can keep.

940
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:10,587
- Joe Anthony?
- Yeah.

941
00:55:10,695 --> 00:55:12,390
Sign this, please.

942
00:55:12,496 --> 00:55:14,623
See, already, autograph hunters.

943
00:55:14,732 --> 00:55:15,721
What is this?

944
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,996
Compliments of the Santa Barbara
Businessmen's Association.

945
00:55:20,238 --> 00:55:21,330
Look.

946
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:28,171
- Hey, Joe, look at these golf balls.
- You look at them.

947
00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:30,679
Look at this complete outfit.

948
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:35,115
- Give those boys a handsome tip.
- Here you are. No, keep it.

949
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:38,313
- And thanks very much for your trouble.
- Thanks for the gift.

950
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:39,980
Wise guy.

951
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:42,958
Anthony, you old hound dog, you.

952
00:55:44,328 --> 00:55:46,262
See, Joe, what golf can do for you?

953
00:55:46,364 --> 00:55:48,127
And back in San Francisco
we can live at home,

954
00:55:48,232 --> 00:55:49,790
and practice with all these golf balls.

955
00:55:49,901 --> 00:55:51,596
We're gonna have to catch up
on our short game.

956
00:55:51,702 --> 00:55:54,034
Remember, you can't count on luck
all the time.

957
00:55:54,138 --> 00:55:56,606
- What do you mean "luck?"
- Oh, I'm sorry.

958
00:55:56,707 --> 00:55:57,674
Luck?

959
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:01,843
"Travelwell Deluxe."
I certainly intend to.

960
00:56:01,946 --> 00:56:04,039
- Harv.
- Oh, yeah.

961
00:56:05,082 --> 00:56:08,609
And by the way,
I'm not going to San Francisco.

962
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:10,186
You're not going home?

963
00:56:10,288 --> 00:56:13,052
I'll practice every day.
The country club is right nearby.

964
00:56:13,157 --> 00:56:16,649
- Nearby what?
- Kathy Taylor's home in Carmel.

965
00:56:16,761 --> 00:56:19,958
Joe, we can't take a vacation now.
Our whole future's at stake.

966
00:56:20,064 --> 00:56:23,795
- I just won a tournament, didn't I?
- Yeah, but not against Hogan or Snead,

967
00:56:23,901 --> 00:56:25,698
and that's who you're gonna have
to play at Monterey.

968
00:56:25,803 --> 00:56:29,739
Look, Harvey, I've never met
a Kathy Taylor before, and I like her.

969
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,171
I'm human.

970
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,870
Okay. We'll go to her place.

971
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:37,914
But remember, Joe,
you have to practice every day.

972
00:56:39,116 --> 00:56:43,143
Harvey, one of us has to go home
and tell the folks how we're doing.

973
00:56:43,254 --> 00:56:46,018
Well, gee, Joe, San Francisco's out of
the way if we are going to Carmel.

974
00:56:46,123 --> 00:56:47,647
We ought to...

975
00:56:51,963 --> 00:56:53,760
I guess you're right.

976
00:56:54,966 --> 00:56:58,561
One of us will have to go home
and let the folks know how we're doing.

977
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:01,763
I'll meet you in Monterey
the morning of the qualifying round.

978
00:57:01,872 --> 00:57:05,103
Okay, you take the clubs
and I'll give the folks your love.

979
00:57:06,177 --> 00:57:07,838
You take the rest.

980
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:13,074
- Oh, that's Kathy.
- Sounds like she has a cold.

981
00:57:13,184 --> 00:57:16,312
- Well, I'll see you in a week.
- Okay.

982
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,887
That's yours.

983
00:57:22,593 --> 00:57:23,787
Thanks.

984
00:57:25,296 --> 00:57:28,026
Okay, now you send the rest
of my things home, huh?

985
00:57:28,132 --> 00:57:30,293
- Okay.
- Bye.

986
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:32,926
- Goodbye.
- Hi, Kathy.

987
00:57:33,037 --> 00:57:35,232
- Let's go, champ.
- Be right with you.

988
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:40,667
Well, let's go.

989
00:57:41,112 --> 00:57:45,674
How do you like that? I almost ran off
without giving any money to my caddy.

990
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:49,317
I knew you'd change your mind.
We're still buddies.

991
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,150
Sure, we're buddies.
How much money we got?

992
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:53,256
Oh.

993
00:57:53,758 --> 00:57:57,387
We have $10, $20, $30, $35,

994
00:57:57,495 --> 00:58:01,192
- $36.50.
- We're rolling in dough.

995
00:58:01,298 --> 00:58:03,198
- Where'd you get all this?
- Oh, I had you in the caddies' pool.

996
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,269
But I spent $3.69 on the party for you.

997
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:10,602
Look, Harvey. I can't go up there broke.
I'll hang onto the $30,

998
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:13,905
and you keep the rest for food
and bus fare.

999
00:58:14,645 --> 00:58:18,046
Don't mention it. You're entitled to it.
Enjoy yourself.

1000
00:58:18,149 --> 00:58:20,947
- Joe...
- Don't thank me. Have a good time.

1001
00:58:21,886 --> 00:58:23,649
- Bye.
- Bye.

1002
00:59:17,408 --> 00:59:19,774
Kathy, is this Carmel or Indianapolis?

1003
00:59:19,877 --> 00:59:21,970
What would your mother say
if she saw you driving like that?

1004
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,070
- I don't know. Why don't you ask her?
- Hello, dear.

1005
00:59:24,181 --> 00:59:26,411
Hello, Mother. Say hello to Joe Anthony.

1006
00:59:26,517 --> 00:59:28,280
- Hello, Joe Anthony.
- Hello, Mother.

1007
00:59:28,385 --> 00:59:29,716
Oh, don't you dare.

1008
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,288
My name is Grace,
and I lie about my age.

1009
00:59:32,389 --> 00:59:34,152
- Hello, Grace.
- Hello.

1010
00:59:34,258 --> 00:59:35,418
Joe just won the tournament.

1011
00:59:35,526 --> 00:59:38,427
Well, good for Joe. Wonderful.
Come along.

1012
00:59:51,642 --> 00:59:53,701
Can't you piggies be quiet?

1013
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:01,947
This is the Taylor estate.

1014
01:00:02,052 --> 01:00:04,384
Oh, just a second. I'll get my things.

1015
01:00:09,493 --> 01:00:10,824
Thank you, Mr. Farmer.

1016
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:23,131
Joey!

1017
01:00:41,192 --> 01:00:42,159
Joey?

1018
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:49,724
Joey?

1019
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:55,633
Joey! Joey!

1020
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,102
I'm not a robber, I'm looking for Joey!

1021
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,794
Hello. Hello, doggies.

1022
01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:24,392
I'm poor and skinny.

1023
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:27,493
Leave me alone.
I wouldn't taste good anyhow.

1024
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:41,082
What are you complaining about?

1025
01:01:41,185 --> 01:01:44,416
You belong here. You're an animal.
I'm a human.

1026
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:47,013
And I'm hungry.

1027
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:02,667
Well, don't be selfish.

1028
01:02:02,773 --> 01:02:05,105
I don't want any of your hay.
You can have that.

1029
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:07,643
Can't I just please have a carrot?

1030
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:10,572
Thank you. You're very kind.

1031
01:02:18,922 --> 01:02:20,514
Won't you have a little scrambled egg?

1032
01:02:20,624 --> 01:02:22,683
You have absolutely nothing
on your plate.

1033
01:02:22,793 --> 01:02:23,760
Well, I could hardly...

1034
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,131
Yes, Lisa?

1035
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:41,973
8:30! Oh, thanks, Rodney,
for waking me up.

1036
01:02:42,346 --> 01:02:45,110
I gotta get these clubs to Joe
right away.

1037
01:02:47,584 --> 01:02:49,051
Good morning.

1038
01:02:56,393 --> 01:02:58,827
Thanks again, Rodney.
I'll see you soon.

1039
01:02:58,929 --> 01:03:01,762
Watch my things, huh? Thanks.

1040
01:03:05,269 --> 01:03:07,897
Oh, how am I going to get out of here?

1041
01:03:39,737 --> 01:03:42,297
Hello, how do you do?
I'm looking for Mr. Anthony.

1042
01:03:42,406 --> 01:03:45,034
He forgot his clubs, so I brought them
to him so he could practice.

1043
01:03:45,142 --> 01:03:47,576
Mr. Anthony is out cycling
with Miss Taylor.

1044
01:03:47,678 --> 01:03:49,270
I'll take them.

1045
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,938
No, I wanted to see... l...

1046
01:04:39,797 --> 01:04:41,628
Nice doggies.

1047
01:04:41,732 --> 01:04:44,963
Hello, doggies. I'm not the same fella.

1048
01:04:45,536 --> 01:04:49,199
If you don't believe me, take a...
Take a sniff.

1049
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:52,002
See, the guy you want is still inside.

1050
01:04:53,444 --> 01:04:56,004
Hey! What are you doing out here?

1051
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,245
You're not supposed
to be with a guest.

1052
01:04:58,348 --> 01:04:59,940
Come on with me.

1053
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:07,522
I can hardly lift it now.

1054
01:05:07,624 --> 01:05:09,888
Well, forget all about
your diets, everybody.

1055
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:10,982
Food.

1056
01:05:12,529 --> 01:05:13,496
Food.

1057
01:05:31,982 --> 01:05:35,247
- Good morning, Mr...
- Good morning, sir. Splendid morning.

1058
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:38,150
Splendid. Wonderful morning,
and it's the best time to get up,

1059
01:05:38,255 --> 01:05:40,485
- is in the morning, isn't it?
- Breakfast, sir?

1060
01:05:40,591 --> 01:05:44,118
Sure! I mean, yes,
I suppose I might have a bite.

1061
01:05:44,228 --> 01:05:48,221
- Yes. What might I serve you, sir?
- Oh, the sausages are fine.

1062
01:05:48,732 --> 01:05:49,824
Wonderful.

1063
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:54,170
And ham.
Ham in the morning is just wonderful.

1064
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:59,802
Eggs with it.
Nothing like eggs with it in the morning.

1065
01:06:00,344 --> 01:06:04,280
And a muffin. That is very nourishing.
Bacon. Bacon's wonderful.

1066
01:06:05,015 --> 01:06:08,178
Oh, wonderful. Fine.
How about just one more for the road?

1067
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:09,343
One more.

1068
01:06:09,953 --> 01:06:13,980
Oh, lamb chops
are very nourishing in the morning.

1069
01:06:14,091 --> 01:06:16,025
I'll take that, and thank you.

1070
01:06:16,126 --> 01:06:17,753
Oh, buns.

1071
01:06:18,462 --> 01:06:19,429
Buns.

1072
01:06:20,497 --> 01:06:24,194
Little buns. Little ones. Yes, I love them.
Baby buns.

1073
01:06:24,668 --> 01:06:28,126
And we missed something. You're cold.
You're getting warmer.

1074
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:30,297
No, you're cold. You were warm.

1075
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:34,309
Hot! Kippers! I just adore kippers.

1076
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:37,073
- Potatoes, sir?
- Potatoes?

1077
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:40,110
- Want me to ruin my waistline?
- Oh, sorry, sir.

1078
01:06:40,217 --> 01:06:42,185
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

1079
01:06:48,025 --> 01:06:50,892
- Shall we start over?
- Oh, no.

1080
01:06:50,994 --> 01:06:53,462
No. No, I'll have to get
some warm plates.

1081
01:06:53,564 --> 01:06:55,862
Warm plates? I'll be here.

1082
01:06:55,966 --> 01:06:57,058
I'll be here, waiting.

1083
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,561
Hearty appetite.

1084
01:07:01,672 --> 01:07:03,663
- How do you do?
- Hello.

1085
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:05,708
In all the excitement
of arriving yesterday,

1086
01:07:05,809 --> 01:07:07,436
- I don't believe we've met.
- Thank you.

1087
01:07:07,544 --> 01:07:09,705
Although you do look familiar.

1088
01:07:09,813 --> 01:07:12,247
My name is Benthall, Sidney Benthall.

1089
01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:15,512
The name is Miller. Harvey Miller, Jr.

1090
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:17,917
May I present Miss Carlton,
Miss Kennedy.

1091
01:07:18,021 --> 01:07:20,182
- Miss Carlton, Miss Kennedy.
- Mr. Miller.

1092
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:22,850
- How do you do...
- Oh, no, that's Mr. Leron.

1093
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,192
- Awfully pleased to know you. Awfully.
- But I have seen you somewhere before.

1094
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:31,859
- I have never been there before.
- At the golf tournament dance.

1095
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:34,836
- At Santa Barbara.
- Santa Barbara?

1096
01:07:34,938 --> 01:07:37,133
You are right, it was Santa Barbara.

1097
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,176
- It could not have been Santa Barbara.
- Well, who are you?

1098
01:07:41,278 --> 01:07:43,712
- Who am I?
- Where are you from?

1099
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:45,338
Where am I from?

1100
01:07:45,449 --> 01:07:48,941
Gentlemen, from Miami to London,

1101
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:51,145
from London to Boston

1102
01:07:51,254 --> 01:07:54,519
I'm known as the gay continental.

1103
01:07:57,728 --> 01:08:01,687
<i>Continent, continent, continental</i>

1104
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:05,495
<i>And I got this way quite accidental</i>

1105
01:08:05,602 --> 01:08:07,797
<i>All my people have riches</i>

1106
01:08:07,904 --> 01:08:09,667
<i>And velveteen britches</i>

1107
01:08:09,773 --> 01:08:12,833
<i>And white tie and tails and top hats on</i>

1108
01:08:12,943 --> 01:08:16,743
<i>And top hats and top hats</i>
<i>and top hats on</i>

1109
01:08:16,847 --> 01:08:20,977
<i>And they breakfast in bed</i>
<i>with their spats on</i>

1110
01:08:21,084 --> 01:08:24,110
<i>Life's a bore</i>

1111
01:08:24,221 --> 01:08:28,351
<i>Having cocktails and tea around four</i>

1112
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:31,154
<i>Whee, fiddle-dee-dee</i>

1113
01:08:31,261 --> 01:08:34,526
<i>I keep drinking as long as they're free</i>

1114
01:08:35,098 --> 01:08:37,225
<i>Now my old family tree</i>

1115
01:08:37,334 --> 01:08:38,926
<i>Is so precious to me</i>

1116
01:08:39,036 --> 01:08:42,172
<i>It is the sturdy old tree</i>
<i>I was sprung from</i>

1117
01:08:42,172 --> 01:08:42,501
<i>It is the sturdy old tree</i>
<i>I was sprung from</i>

1118
01:08:42,606 --> 01:08:46,201
<i>I was sprung, I was sprung</i>
<i>I was sprung from</i>

1119
01:08:46,309 --> 01:08:49,904
<i>'Tis the tree that my grandpa</i>
<i>was hung from</i>

1120
01:08:50,013 --> 01:08:52,277
<i>Though I can't pay my rental</i>

1121
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:55,681
<i>A gay continental am I

1122
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,412
<i>Hi, ho, hum</i>

1123
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:03,748
<i>I'm a high-class society crumb</i>

1124
01:10:03,854 --> 01:10:06,755
<i>C'est la vie</i>

1125
01:10:06,857 --> 01:10:09,849
<i>Now in French</i>
<i>that means nothing to me</i>

1126
01:10:10,527 --> 01:10:12,392
<i>My old family estate</i>

1127
01:10:12,496 --> 01:10:14,293
<i>Is so big and sedate</i>

1128
01:10:14,397 --> 01:10:17,764
<i>If you happen my way, give a look in</i>

1129
01:10:17,868 --> 01:10:21,429
<i>Give a look, give a look, give a look in</i>

1130
01:10:21,538 --> 01:10:25,167
<i>On the Rue de la Flatbush in Brooklyn</i>

1131
01:10:25,275 --> 01:10:27,300
<i>I'm a wee temperamental</i>

1132
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:29,037
<i>At times, detrimental</i>

1133
01:10:29,146 --> 01:10:31,011
<i>My money's parental</i>

1134
01:10:31,114 --> 01:10:32,581
<i>My attitude's mental</i>

1135
01:10:32,682 --> 01:10:34,843
<i>My upper plate's dental</i>

1136
01:10:34,951 --> 01:10:38,785
<i>A gay continental am I

1137
01:10:48,865 --> 01:10:51,959
- Harvey, what are you doing here?
- The breaststroke.

1138
01:10:52,068 --> 01:10:55,128
- I never learned to crawl.
- Come out of there.

1139
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:02,071
Now I know who you are.

1140
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:03,737
- Why, you're...
- I'm his caddy.

1141
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:05,906
Caddy? Sorry.

1142
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:08,041
You're supposed to be
in San Francisco.

1143
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:10,051
Don't you know these people
are all invited guests?

1144
01:11:10,153 --> 01:11:12,621
Consider yourself invited, Harvey.
I'm glad you're here.

1145
01:11:12,722 --> 01:11:14,917
- Oh, thank you.
- We can use you.

1146
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:16,925
- Can't we, Mother?
- Why, of course.

1147
01:11:17,027 --> 01:11:19,723
Until the tournament starts
you can earn some money.

1148
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:23,231
Charles, with so many extra guests,
we'll need another man.

1149
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,767
Charles will take care of you.

1150
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:27,894
Oh, you don't understand. Joe and I...

1151
01:11:28,004 --> 01:11:31,405
Well, I think that's very sweet
of Mrs. Taylor.

1152
01:11:31,508 --> 01:11:34,500
- But, Joe, we gotta practice.
- You're very conscientious, Harvey,

1153
01:11:34,611 --> 01:11:37,307
- but, don't overdo it.
- Come along, boy.

1154
01:11:38,682 --> 01:11:40,411
Now, go along, boy.

1155
01:11:43,453 --> 01:11:46,356
- He's really a very nice guy.
- Of course, he is.

1156
01:11:46,356 --> 01:11:46,651
- He's really a very nice guy.
- Of course, he is.

1157
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:50,083
Listen to this part of the letter
from Harvey.

1158
01:11:50,193 --> 01:11:54,323
He say, "Joe won at Santa Barbara

1159
01:11:54,664 --> 01:11:58,600
"and we play again soon
at the $10,000 Monterey tournament."

1160
01:11:58,702 --> 01:12:01,102
- So who say he's gonna win?
- I say so.

1161
01:12:01,204 --> 01:12:03,331
I don't believe you. I attach!

1162
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,840
Wait, Mr. Spezzato.

1163
01:12:05,942 --> 01:12:08,740
- I'll get Harvey on the phone.
- That's a good idea, Lisa.

1164
01:12:16,453 --> 01:12:19,115
Would you like
something to eat, ma'am?

1165
01:12:19,723 --> 01:12:23,352
Why not try one of these?
They're very good. I just had one.

1166
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,950
You might as well take a handful, lady.

1167
01:12:25,061 --> 01:12:27,120
Supper ain't gonna be ready
for at least a half-hour.

1168
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:29,289
I don't know how you can fill up
on these tiny sandwiches.

1169
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:32,197
- Would you like to have one?
- No, thank you.

1170
01:12:32,302 --> 01:12:33,564
No, thank you.

1171
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:36,230
Phone call for Mr. Harvey Miller, Jr.

1172
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:39,300
Oh, that's me.
Would you please pass these around?

1173
01:12:39,409 --> 01:12:42,742
Thank you.
And watch the man with the beard.

1174
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:46,907
He's already had seconds.
Push the celery. We can't get rid of it.

1175
01:12:48,718 --> 01:12:52,313
- You can't use that phone.
- Hello? It works.

1176
01:12:52,422 --> 01:12:55,323
Hello, Lisa! How are you?

1177
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:59,087
You'll have to talk a little louder,
sweetheart, we're having a party here.

1178
01:12:59,195 --> 01:13:02,187
Mr. Spezzato's here
and he's worrying about his money.

1179
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:05,894
He wants either his $500
or the restaurant.

1180
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:08,633
Hello, Mr. Spezzato?

1181
01:13:09,272 --> 01:13:12,332
Oh, Joe's a cinch. It's in the bag.

1182
01:13:13,009 --> 01:13:16,968
- Oh, yes, sir, he's in great shape.
- Would you give me that phone?

1183
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,069
Lisa,

1184
01:13:19,616 --> 01:13:21,550
this phone call is SWAK.

1185
01:13:26,656 --> 01:13:27,748
SWAK?

1186
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:30,953
S-W-A-K.

1187
01:13:31,061 --> 01:13:33,655
Sealed with a kiss.

1188
01:13:33,763 --> 01:13:37,790
Here, give me that.
Take this and get in there with it.

1189
01:13:37,901 --> 01:13:39,368
You're nasty.

1190
01:13:42,272 --> 01:13:43,637
Cheers.

1191
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,607
Just 68-and-a-half more hours
before a certain tournament.

1192
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:50,476
- I'll take this glass for you, sir.
- What's that look like, a finger bowl?

1193
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,741
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I thought it was empty.

1194
01:13:52,849 --> 01:13:54,578
I'll get you a fresh finger bowl.

1195
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:56,618
- The heat's on.
- Shut it off.

1196
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:00,212
How about a sandwich, sir?
Lt'll be much better for you than a drink.

1197
01:14:00,323 --> 01:14:02,689
- Vitamins, you know.
- I'd much rather have a drink.

1198
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:06,319
- We're all out of gin, sir.
- That's impossible. There's plenty.

1199
01:14:06,429 --> 01:14:09,830
Oh, what do you... Yes, we're...

1200
01:14:11,134 --> 01:14:15,230
- Is that boy one of our regular servants?
- He's my caddy, Mr. Taylor.

1201
01:14:15,338 --> 01:14:18,034
- Kathy gave him a temporary job.
- Caddy?

1202
01:14:18,141 --> 01:14:21,474
Oh, you're the lad who won
the tournament at Santa Barbara.

1203
01:14:21,578 --> 01:14:23,705
Grace told me all about you.

1204
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:27,815
Here's luck.

1205
01:14:29,452 --> 01:14:30,749
Thank you.

1206
01:14:34,224 --> 01:14:37,853
Oh, I'm sorry. Your glass is empty.
I'll send Charles.

1207
01:14:39,095 --> 01:14:41,723
You better leave
the whole tray here, Charles.

1208
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:46,097
Been off my game for quite a while now.
Shooting in the 90's.

1209
01:14:47,203 --> 01:14:49,728
- Oh, will you have a cigarette?
- Thank you.

1210
01:14:49,839 --> 01:14:51,238
Here's a light.

1211
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:04,011
- I filled this glass, didn't I, Kathy?
- Yes, you did.

1212
01:15:10,393 --> 01:15:14,056
- I put the tray down there, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

1213
01:15:58,041 --> 01:16:00,407
- Oh, I'll take that, Jane.
- Very well.

1214
01:16:01,511 --> 01:16:03,411
- Seafood, madam?
- Hey, Charlie.

1215
01:16:05,215 --> 01:16:08,912
- You idiot!
- I'm freezing.

1216
01:16:09,953 --> 01:16:11,250
Keep cool!

1217
01:16:11,788 --> 01:16:16,384
Oh, you clumsy, clumsy boy.

1218
01:16:17,727 --> 01:16:20,560
Oh, you kill me.
I love that... With the tray...

1219
01:16:22,398 --> 01:16:24,491
- Oh, not that face.
- Harvey.

1220
01:16:25,735 --> 01:16:29,671
- Harvey, get out of here. You're drunk.
- That's funny, Joe.

1221
01:16:29,772 --> 01:16:33,139
Every time you start to drink,
you think everybody else is drunk.

1222
01:16:33,243 --> 01:16:35,143
If you'd have gone to San Francisco
like I told you to,

1223
01:16:35,245 --> 01:16:39,204
- this wouldn't have happened to me.
- I'll apologize to everybody.

1224
01:16:40,016 --> 01:16:43,144
- I know I embarrassed you.
- You certainly did.

1225
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:46,180
Well, tell them all I'm not a servant.

1226
01:16:46,823 --> 01:16:48,124
I'm your friend, Joe. I'm your pal.
I'm gonna be your brother-in-law.

1227
01:16:48,124 --> 01:16:51,753
I'm your friend, Joe. I'm your pal.
I'm gonna be your brother-in-law.

1228
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:54,720
- Brother-in-law?
- Naturally.

1229
01:16:54,831 --> 01:16:56,924
That's why I wanna protect him.

1230
01:16:57,033 --> 01:17:00,298
That's why I want him
to win the tournament, naturally.

1231
01:17:00,403 --> 01:17:02,803
- For Lisa's sake.
- Lisa?

1232
01:17:02,906 --> 01:17:04,305
Naturally.

1233
01:17:04,407 --> 01:17:06,602
Oh, boy, Joe.
Lisa called on the telephone,

1234
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:08,404
and she sent you her love.

1235
01:17:10,813 --> 01:17:13,941
- I spoke out of turn?
- Just in time.

1236
01:17:14,684 --> 01:17:17,744
Charles... Charles, announce dinner
at once, please.

1237
01:17:17,854 --> 01:17:19,014
Dinner is served.

1238
01:17:20,023 --> 01:17:22,958
I hope they have frankfurters.
I'm gonna take care of...

1239
01:17:23,059 --> 01:17:25,960
- Dinner is served. Hurry up, everybody!
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

1240
01:17:26,062 --> 01:17:30,396
Come on, it's gonna get cold. Hurry up.
Last one in's a rotten egg.

1241
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,900
- I can't have this.
- Come on. Everything's gonna get cold

1242
01:17:33,002 --> 01:17:34,970
- and you won't have nothing to eat.
- What am I going to do?

1243
01:17:35,071 --> 01:17:36,936
- Everybody hurry!
- There goes my job.

1244
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,100
- Hello, Charlie.
- Will you get out of here?

1245
01:17:46,849 --> 01:17:48,749
Now, come on, get out of here.

1246
01:17:51,087 --> 01:17:52,054
Really.

1247
01:17:53,856 --> 01:17:56,154
Look, honey.
I told him not to come up here.

1248
01:17:56,259 --> 01:17:57,920
Harvey's got things all mixed up.

1249
01:17:58,027 --> 01:17:59,756
He's going to be
your brother-in-law, isn't he?

1250
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:00,829
Well, sure.

1251
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,363
And Lisa is going to be
the blushing bride?

1252
01:18:02,465 --> 01:18:03,454
Yes, but you don't...

1253
01:18:03,566 --> 01:18:05,557
He doesn't have things mixed up
as far as I'm concerned.

1254
01:18:07,637 --> 01:18:10,435
Your faith in me
is very touching. Thanks.

1255
01:18:29,559 --> 01:18:30,992
Come in, Joe.

1256
01:18:32,562 --> 01:18:33,688
Harvey?

1257
01:18:34,697 --> 01:18:36,961
Oh, Miss Taylor, hello.

1258
01:18:37,066 --> 01:18:39,864
- Oh, you shouldn't have done it.
- Take this.

1259
01:18:39,969 --> 01:18:41,197
Thank you.

1260
01:18:44,774 --> 01:18:46,298
And then this.

1261
01:18:49,212 --> 01:18:51,737
- Thank you.
- What's all this?

1262
01:18:52,382 --> 01:18:55,044
Oh, I've caused you enough trouble,
Miss Taylor.

1263
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:57,381
Well, it's not your fault, Harvey.

1264
01:18:57,487 --> 01:19:00,854
I hope that Joe and Lisa
will be very happy together.

1265
01:19:01,591 --> 01:19:04,355
Oh, they will be. She likes him.

1266
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:07,429
It's always, "My big brother this,"
and "My big brother that."

1267
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:11,022
Well, I've never thought of him
as the big brother type.

1268
01:19:11,534 --> 01:19:14,765
Well, you would if you were his sister,
like Lisa.

1269
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:19,069
- Her sister? Joe's her sister?
- No, Joe's her brother.

1270
01:19:19,175 --> 01:19:23,236
- You're all confused, Miss Taylor.
- My dear brother-in-law.

1271
01:19:25,882 --> 01:19:28,146
Charles? Where's Mr. Anthony?

1272
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:31,278
Oh, are you sure?

1273
01:19:32,422 --> 01:19:33,719
Thank you.

1274
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:39,052
- Joe's gone.
- Joe's gone?

1275
01:19:39,162 --> 01:19:41,096
- Yes.
- He can't be.

1276
01:19:41,197 --> 01:19:44,689
What about the tournament?
What are we gonna do?

1277
01:19:45,635 --> 01:19:49,867
I'll help you find him, Harvey.
But then it's every man for himself.

1278
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:09,553
Thanks. You heading
for San Francisco?

1279
01:20:09,659 --> 01:20:11,991
- Your name Joe Anthony?
- Yeah, what's wrong?

1280
01:20:12,095 --> 01:20:14,655
Let's take a look at that bag.

1281
01:20:14,764 --> 01:20:17,324
Hey, what are you doing? That's mine.

1282
01:20:19,936 --> 01:20:24,202
"Inverness Open Tournaments.
Winner: Harvey Miller, Sr."

1283
01:20:24,307 --> 01:20:26,798
- I thought your name was Anthony.
- It is. That cup was given to me.

1284
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:29,571
This is my bag
and these are my clothes.

1285
01:20:38,354 --> 01:20:42,484
- This isn't my cap.
- We can see that. Come on, get in.

1286
01:20:48,398 --> 01:20:50,263
Oh, do come in, please.

1287
01:20:53,903 --> 01:20:57,805
Well, here he is, miss. We found him.
He had Mr. Miller's suitcase, all right.

1288
01:20:57,907 --> 01:20:59,397
Yes.

1289
01:20:59,509 --> 01:21:02,706
Kathy, will you tell them the truth?

1290
01:21:02,812 --> 01:21:05,872
I think you gentlemen had better speak
to Cousin Harvey.

1291
01:21:05,982 --> 01:21:07,574
Cousin Harvey?

1292
01:21:09,819 --> 01:21:12,583
Yes, Kathy, darling. Coming, my dear.

1293
01:21:15,391 --> 01:21:17,154
Oh, visitors. Very nice.

1294
01:21:19,729 --> 01:21:22,789
Scotland Yard.
I see you've collared the crazy kid.

1295
01:21:22,899 --> 01:21:24,628
Splendid. Splendid.

1296
01:21:25,468 --> 01:21:27,629
Good heavens. It's Joe, the gardener.

1297
01:21:27,737 --> 01:21:31,400
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Miller,
but he tried to tell us it was his bag.

1298
01:21:31,507 --> 01:21:32,872
Ridiculous, ridiculous.

1299
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,636
Watch him. Watch him.

1300
01:21:35,745 --> 01:21:38,475
He's not a bad boy, Officer.
He's just mischievous.

1301
01:21:38,581 --> 01:21:40,742
I don't think Cousin Harvey
wants to prosecute,

1302
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,215
do you, Cousin Harvey?

1303
01:21:42,318 --> 01:21:44,343
As long as he doesn't give me
any trouble.

1304
01:21:44,454 --> 01:21:46,649
- I'll give you plenty.
- You got your gun?

1305
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:47,745
Keep your eye on him.

1306
01:21:47,857 --> 01:21:49,017
You'd better behave yourself,
young man,

1307
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:52,561
or these nice police officers
will throw you in the pokey.

1308
01:21:52,662 --> 01:21:53,856
You can run along, gentlemen.

1309
01:21:53,963 --> 01:21:56,056
Leave him here
and I'll give him a stern talking to.

1310
01:21:56,165 --> 01:21:57,894
- Well, I don't know...
- It's all right,

1311
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,468
and send me a dozen tickets
to the Policemen's Ball.

1312
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:03,471
- Thank you, Mr. Miller.
- That's all right. Bully, bully.

1313
01:22:03,573 --> 01:22:04,938
Splendid.

1314
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:06,235
Help!

1315
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:07,866
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

1316
01:22:07,977 --> 01:22:09,171
Good evening.

1317
01:22:10,213 --> 01:22:12,977
- Make that two dozen tickets.
- Thank you, sir.

1318
01:22:13,082 --> 01:22:15,448
- That's all right. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1319
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:21,051
- Joe, if you could only see your face.
- Very funny.

1320
01:22:21,157 --> 01:22:25,617
- Now that you've had your fun, can I go?
- Wait, Joe. Everything's straight.

1321
01:22:25,862 --> 01:22:28,695
Kathy knows it's me
Lisa was gonna marry and not you.

1322
01:22:28,798 --> 01:22:32,632
- Everybody's happy. I'll get your clubs.
- I'm very sorry.

1323
01:22:32,735 --> 01:22:34,862
- It was just a misunderstanding.
- Oh, sure.

1324
01:22:34,971 --> 01:22:36,529
You'll need these.

1325
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,073
What good are they gonna do me
on a fishing boat?

1326
01:22:39,175 --> 01:22:41,905
- Oh, but I didn't tell you the bad news.
- No, you didn't.

1327
01:22:42,011 --> 01:22:44,206
About Mr. Spezzato.
He's gonna take Mama's restaurant

1328
01:22:44,313 --> 01:22:46,713
and Papa's boat away,
if they don't pay him the $500.

1329
01:22:46,816 --> 01:22:49,114
We gotta win the $10,000.

1330
01:22:50,419 --> 01:22:51,818
I'll get it.

1331
01:22:53,122 --> 01:22:54,749
Wait, Joe. We're a team.

1332
01:22:56,025 --> 01:22:59,051
We were a team.
And you stay away from me.

1333
01:23:00,997 --> 01:23:02,123
Joe.

1334
01:23:19,315 --> 01:23:22,580
I thought it took at least two
to make a team.

1335
01:23:22,685 --> 01:23:24,243
That's what I thought.

1336
01:23:26,055 --> 01:23:28,853
Do you break up a team
by just walking out?

1337
01:23:29,825 --> 01:23:31,156
I'm very sorry, Harvey.

1338
01:23:36,532 --> 01:23:38,966
Well, if it isn't the little hitchhiker.

1339
01:23:42,705 --> 01:23:44,935
So you're stealing golf bags now.

1340
01:23:46,008 --> 01:23:49,239
- Oh, no, not again.
- All right, Sticky Fingers.

1341
01:23:50,146 --> 01:23:51,511
Ladies and gentlemen,

1342
01:23:51,614 --> 01:23:55,277
I welcome you
to the Monterey Invitational Tournament.

1343
01:23:55,384 --> 01:23:57,909
I don't see him anywhere, Harvey.

1344
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:00,250
Leading off from the first foursome,

1345
01:24:00,356 --> 01:24:03,291
the winner of the first
Los Angeles Open Tournament,

1346
01:24:03,392 --> 01:24:05,553
"Light Horse" Harry Cooper.

1347
01:24:08,664 --> 01:24:10,928
Urgent message for Miss Kathy Taylor.

1348
01:24:11,033 --> 01:24:14,230
Miss Kathy Taylor,
report to the clubhouse telephone.

1349
01:24:14,337 --> 01:24:15,634
- Miss Taylor?
- Yes, I am.

1350
01:24:15,738 --> 01:24:19,299
- Telephone.
- Hello. Yes, I'm Kathy Taylor.

1351
01:24:19,408 --> 01:24:22,275
You're Kathy Taylor,
I'm Joe Anthony and I'm in jail.

1352
01:24:22,378 --> 01:24:23,845
- Joe!
- Joe?

1353
01:24:23,946 --> 01:24:26,938
- He's in jail.
- Jail!

1354
01:24:27,049 --> 01:24:29,108
Joe, Joe! Oh!

1355
01:24:30,753 --> 01:24:32,584
Quiet, please!

1356
01:24:32,855 --> 01:24:36,814
Now, listen, if this is another one
of your gags, it isn't funny.

1357
01:24:37,493 --> 01:24:39,085
Tell it to them.

1358
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:41,060
Yes, ma'am.

1359
01:24:42,264 --> 01:24:43,231
Yes, ma'am.

1360
01:24:45,134 --> 01:24:48,331
- Oh, I see. Well, I'm sorry.
- He's sorry.

1361
01:24:49,338 --> 01:24:50,703
Well, hurry.

1362
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:55,374
- They can get him here in 15 minutes.
- He tees off in the next foursome.

1363
01:24:55,478 --> 01:24:58,038
He can't possibly make it.
He'll be disqualified.

1364
01:24:58,147 --> 01:24:59,448
- Disqualified?
- On the tee,

1365
01:24:59,448 --> 01:25:01,143
- Disqualified?
- On the tee,

1366
01:25:02,184 --> 01:25:04,448
Slammin' Sammy Snead!

1367
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:11,884
On the tee...

1368
01:25:11,994 --> 01:25:13,894
If we could only do something
to delay them.

1369
01:25:13,996 --> 01:25:15,429
Jimmy Thomson.

1370
01:25:15,531 --> 01:25:17,863
What if I fainted or had a spell
right on the tee?

1371
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:20,492
Oh, no, that's no good.
You don't know professional golfers.

1372
01:25:20,603 --> 01:25:23,629
They're like killers.
They'd play right over your body.

1373
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,371
That gives me an idea.

1374
01:25:27,476 --> 01:25:30,377
Hey, mister. Excuse me, sir.

1375
01:25:31,847 --> 01:25:34,873
- Mr. Thomson, is this your ball?
- Yeah.

1376
01:25:35,451 --> 01:25:39,751
- It's undersized. Against regulations.
- It couldn't be. I just bought it inside.

1377
01:25:39,855 --> 01:25:40,822
Oh.

1378
01:25:41,824 --> 01:25:43,724
- Do you have a knife?
- No.

1379
01:25:43,826 --> 01:25:45,453
No. How about you?
Do you have a knife?

1380
01:25:45,561 --> 01:25:47,529
- Yeah.
- May I borrow it?

1381
01:25:47,897 --> 01:25:51,424
Could you open it, please. Just open it.

1382
01:25:51,534 --> 01:25:54,970
I'd like to examine it.
Thank you very much.

1383
01:25:55,071 --> 01:25:57,198
It's getting late, isn't it?

1384
01:26:14,223 --> 01:26:18,387
.3962. Perfect.
Here you are, Mr. Thomson.

1385
01:26:18,694 --> 01:26:19,956
Hit away.

1386
01:26:21,397 --> 01:26:24,366
- Is he with you?
- I thought he was with you.

1387
01:26:24,467 --> 01:26:26,662
Who are you with?

1388
01:26:26,769 --> 01:26:30,068
- Oh, I'm with you.
- Get off the tee!

1389
01:26:34,543 --> 01:26:36,010
Ball, please.

1390
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:45,680
- No funny stuff while I drive, please.
- Certainly not, Ben, certainly not.

1391
01:26:45,788 --> 01:26:49,383
On the tee, Bantam Ben Hogan.

1392
01:27:06,175 --> 01:27:08,143
- Here he is, Miss Taylor.
- Thank you.

1393
01:27:08,244 --> 01:27:10,940
- Oh, Joe, I'm so glad you're fine.
- It all right if I take my clubs now?

1394
01:27:11,046 --> 01:27:13,344
- Sure.
- On the tee,

1395
01:27:13,449 --> 01:27:16,816
Joe Anthony from San Francisco.

1396
01:27:18,554 --> 01:27:20,784
- I'm Joe Anthony.
- You're just in time.

1397
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:23,882
- You're on the tee right now.
- Can I have a caddy?

1398
01:27:23,993 --> 01:27:25,961
Well, I'm sure
there's been one assigned to you.

1399
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:27,460
- Hello.
- Look, I don't want...

1400
01:27:27,563 --> 01:27:29,087
He doesn't want to delay the game
any longer,

1401
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:31,666
so we'll tee off in just a minute.
Would you excuse us, please?

1402
01:27:31,767 --> 01:27:34,031
We have work to do.
Would you, please?

1403
01:27:34,136 --> 01:27:35,933
- Thank you very much.
- Look, Harvey, will you...

1404
01:27:36,038 --> 01:27:37,266
Yes, I've been examining
the course, sir.

1405
01:27:37,373 --> 01:27:38,772
Yes, sir, and this is a very narrow hole

1406
01:27:38,874 --> 01:27:41,342
and I suggest we start
with the three-wood.

1407
01:27:43,245 --> 01:27:46,578
- Give me the driver.
- All right, here you are.

1408
01:27:49,118 --> 01:27:51,143
I'm sorry,
it was your wash from the motel.

1409
01:27:51,253 --> 01:27:53,585
- I had nowhere to put it.
- Give me a ball, Harvey.

1410
01:28:01,397 --> 01:28:04,093
- No ball.
- Why don't you try your pocket?

1411
01:28:06,769 --> 01:28:08,862
Here you are. Sorry, Joe.

1412
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:18,673
Be quiet. This is not funny.

1413
01:28:27,089 --> 01:28:30,115
- That's an eight-iron, Joe.
- I don't want the eight-iron.

1414
01:28:30,226 --> 01:28:33,662
- You better listen to him, Joe.
- Will you give me the six-iron?

1415
01:28:36,365 --> 01:28:40,665
- Harvey, this is the eight-iron.
- That's the club you should use!

1416
01:28:40,769 --> 01:28:42,464
Give me the six-iron!

1417
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,808
Joe, that's the wrong club, Joe.

1418
01:28:46,909 --> 01:28:49,901
- That is not the right...
- One more disturbance, Mr. Anthony,

1419
01:28:50,012 --> 01:28:52,674
and I'll be forced to disqualify you.

1420
01:28:52,781 --> 01:28:55,682
I'm sorry, sir. It was all my fault.
I won't make any more noise.

1421
01:28:55,784 --> 01:28:57,775
Well, see that you don't.

1422
01:29:02,057 --> 01:29:04,617
It's Fisherman's Wharf!
They brought everything but the dock.

1423
01:29:04,727 --> 01:29:06,194
$10,000.

1424
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:11,894
Look, Mama, there's Harvey and Joe.
Wave to them.

1425
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:21,141
Joe, we've come all the way
from San Francisco to see you win.

1426
01:29:21,243 --> 01:29:23,507
Pop, why did you drive
on the golf course?

1427
01:29:23,612 --> 01:29:27,104
I see big sign on the house.
It says, "Driving Range." So I drive in.

1428
01:29:27,216 --> 01:29:30,743
Anthony, I warned you.
You're disqualified!

1429
01:29:30,853 --> 01:29:32,150
Oh, no, wait, please.

1430
01:29:32,254 --> 01:29:34,085
Joe's gotta play,
or we'll lose the <i>Mama Mia,</i>

1431
01:29:34,189 --> 01:29:37,158
and Mama Anthony's restaurant.
You can't disqualify Joe.

1432
01:29:37,259 --> 01:29:39,693
You cannot throw my Joe
out of the game.

1433
01:29:39,795 --> 01:29:42,286
They're not gonna play without Joe.

1434
01:29:43,699 --> 01:29:45,394
Come on.
We'll move the trucks out ourselves.

1435
01:29:45,501 --> 01:29:48,026
You no move nothing!
We wanna see our Joe play!

1436
01:29:48,137 --> 01:29:51,538
- Harry, call the police.
- All right, call the police, big shot.

1437
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:55,132
- Now, you get off the course.
- Hey, don't you push me.

1438
01:29:59,181 --> 01:30:02,207
You're not gonna let them
disqualify Joe, are you, Mr. Hogan?

1439
01:30:02,318 --> 01:30:04,081
Well, I'm sorry, that's up to the officials.

1440
01:30:04,186 --> 01:30:06,211
Oh. Well, if Joe's not gonna play,

1441
01:30:06,322 --> 01:30:08,813
nobody's gonna play. Come on, Mama.

1442
01:30:16,665 --> 01:30:18,724
Look, we've had just about enough...

1443
01:30:18,834 --> 01:30:21,803
- Don't you hit Harvey!
- Lady, please.

1444
01:30:25,074 --> 01:30:27,508
- Mama, let's go in the car.
- But, where's Papa?

1445
01:30:27,609 --> 01:30:28,576
Papa! Papa!

1446
01:30:33,482 --> 01:30:35,074
This ain't funny.

1447
01:30:35,184 --> 01:30:37,311
You're crazy to waste your time
playing golf.

1448
01:30:37,419 --> 01:30:39,444
We've had just about enough...

1449
01:30:39,555 --> 01:30:41,750
You know, you guys could have
a great future in show business.

1450
01:30:41,857 --> 01:30:44,121
- Show business?
- Come on!

1451
01:30:44,226 --> 01:30:46,524
Here, take my card, look me up.

1452
01:30:46,662 --> 01:30:49,460
All right, come on. Let's get out of here.

1453
01:30:49,698 --> 01:30:50,722
Joe.

1454
01:30:55,304 --> 01:30:56,703
Joe, I did it!

1455
01:30:56,805 --> 01:30:59,171
Joe, I ain't scared of people.
I did it, Joe.

1456
01:30:59,274 --> 01:31:01,538
Officers, it was those two.

1457
01:31:02,211 --> 01:31:04,645
- Come on!
- I ain't scared.

1458
01:31:04,747 --> 01:31:06,612
They did this!

1459
01:31:07,016 --> 01:31:09,075
Hang on, Joe. Hang on!

1460
01:32:59,661 --> 01:33:00,923
They kill me.

1461
01:33:02,564 --> 01:33:05,795
<i>Oh, I like the way I'm feeling</i>
<i>with the one that I adore</i>

1462
01:33:05,901 --> 01:33:09,029
<i>Yes, I like this funny feeling</i>
<i>that I've never felt before</i>

1463
01:33:09,138 --> 01:33:12,073
<i>But if you should say you like it</i>
<i>then I'd like it even more</i>

1464
01:33:12,174 --> 01:33:15,337
<i>There's so many, many little likes</i>
<i>I'm always dreaming of</i>

1465
01:33:15,444 --> 01:33:17,207
<i>And it takes a lot of little likes</i>

1466
01:33:17,312 --> 01:33:18,973
<i>to make one</i>

1467
01:33:19,081 --> 01:33:23,984
<i>big love</i>

1468
01:33:29,191 --> 01:33:31,955
<i>What would I do without you</i>
<i>what would I do, boy</i>

1469
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:35,154
<i>What would I do without you</i>
<i>what would I do</i>

1470
01:33:35,264 --> 01:33:36,492
<i>I need a partner, you're the one</i>

1471
01:33:36,598 --> 01:33:38,327
<i>I'll be right there</i>
<i>when the show goes on</i>

1472
01:33:38,433 --> 01:33:39,593
- <i>I'm for you</i>
- <i>I'm for you</i>

1473
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:41,430
<i>From California to Kalamazoo</i>

1474
01:33:41,537 --> 01:33:44,097
<i>What would I do without you</i>
<i>when you're gone</i>

1475
01:33:44,206 --> 01:33:47,232
- <i>When you're gone, when you're gone</i>
- <i>When you're gone, when you're gone</i>

1476
01:33:47,342 --> 01:33:50,903
<i>Oh, what would I do without you</i>
<i>what would I do</i>

1477
01:33:52,681 --> 01:33:54,649
Let's hurry, boys.
Ten minutes before the train comes.

1478
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:56,342
Go up and change.

1479
01:33:57,119 --> 01:33:59,417
- I've got my story.
- Oh, that's swell. Thank you.

1480
01:33:59,521 --> 01:34:00,749
- Bye.
- Goodbye, everyone.

1481
01:34:00,856 --> 01:34:03,757
- Let's go, fellows, train time.
- You can pick up your keys at the desk.

1482
01:34:03,859 --> 01:34:05,554
You got a tough act to follow.

1483
01:34:05,661 --> 01:34:07,856
Hurry, Joe, we haven't got much time.
We'll miss the train.

1484
01:34:07,963 --> 01:34:10,761
- Lisa and Kathy'll meet us backstage.
- What are your names?

1485
01:34:10,866 --> 01:34:14,165
- I'm Dean Martin.
- And I'm Jerry Lewis. Martin and Lewis.

1486
01:34:14,269 --> 01:34:17,363
Here, close the door.
I'm in my birthday suit.

1487
01:34:20,309 --> 01:34:22,777
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

1488
01:34:35,424 --> 01:34:37,517
- You were wonderful.
- I was?

1489
01:34:37,626 --> 01:34:41,289
- Well, how about me?
- So were you, Joe. You were marvelous.

1490
01:34:48,537 --> 01:34:50,266
- Joe?
- That's me.

1491
01:34:54,009 --> 01:34:56,102
- Harvey?
- That's me.

1492
01:35:05,854 --> 01:35:07,947
How lucky can two guys get?

1493
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:10,317
Yeah, we got it real bad,
ain't we, Dean?

1494
01:35:10,425 --> 01:35:11,619
Yeah, Jer.
