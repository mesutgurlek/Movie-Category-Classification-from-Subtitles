1
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,632
How's that, Kitty?

2
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,212
To your left, George.

3
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,473
That's good, that's good.

4
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,862
Come on, get your back in it.
Come on, stupid!

5
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,595
- Come on!
- What are you doing to Jumbo?

6
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,898
- Work ain't gonna hurt him...
- I told you to leave him alone.

7
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,235
Jumbo is a star, not a laborer.
Come on.

8
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,640
A bull's a bull. The way
you spoil this one burns me up.

9
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,906
Oh, really?

10
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,449
Let me tell you.
I don't know the shows you've been with.

11
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,645
But in this show, you're gonna
do it our way. He's a star.

12
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,650
- Cool him off, Jumbo.
- Hey, what are you doing?

13
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:35,062
Put me down, you crazy...! Put me down!
Put me down, you idiot! Put me down!

14
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,930
- Don't you drop me, you big baboon!
- All right.

15
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,230
Hey, don't you drop me...!

16
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,066
Come on, Jumbo. Come on, come on.

17
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,577
- I quit!
- Too late. You're fired.

18
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,614
I hate to let him go. He is
a good canvas man. Come on.

19
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,220
Nobody's gonna treat you that way.

20
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,491
Don't you worry, baby.
Never happen again.

21
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,358
Trouble is, he thinks
you're an elephant.

22
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,122
Well, that'll give you an idea
of his mentality.

23
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,698
Oh, what a nerve! Imagine
working a person before breakfast.

24
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,928
As soon as rehearsal's over,
I'll let you hay up.

25
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,096
Well, Beauty, you're almost
as pretty as your picture.

26
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,573
You just stay right here in the
sunshine and get dry, you hear?

27
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,302
All right, baby?

28
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,046
Come on, Jumbo, rehearsal time.

29
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,616
- Harry, I'm sorry I'm late.
- Morning, Kitty.

30
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,780
Do you have Jumbo's new music?
Oh, good.

31
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,585
Good morning, Jumbo.
And what key would you like it in?

32
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,294
B flat?

33
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,500
Very well. B flat.

34
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,659
- All right.
- Ready?

35
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,322
Very good. Wasn't it, Harry?

36
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,392
Let's try it again, boys, huh?

37
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,959
Excuse me.

38
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,916
I've been looking all over
the place for you. Where you been?

39
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,887
All over the place. How about you, Pop?

40
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,518
Oh, I just moseyed into town
for a while...

41
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,091
...to take a look around,
get the local color.

42
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,725
- You know.
- Yeah, I know.

43
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,797
How you can find a crap game in a
strange town before breakfast beats me.

44
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,960
Crap game? Me?
What makes you think that?

45
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:57,638
Well, for one thing, Eddie told me
that the cash box was empty this morning.

46
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,772
How much did you lose?

47
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,105
I'll level with you, Kitten.

48
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:08,276
I run a hot 300 bucks
into a cool 30 cents.

49
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,916
- Oh, Pop.
- Don't worry, honey.

50
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,525
We'll make it back tonight.
We'll be sold out.

51
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,957
What's the good
of being sold out, now, Pop?

52
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,997
We owe bills from here
to Kansas City and points east.

53
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,764
Do you know how much money
we owe right here in this town?

54
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:36,544
All right. I guess we can stall them again.
We've had enough practice.

55
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,050
That's my Kitten.

56
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,279
Come on, Jumbo! Mush!

57
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,952
All right, boys and girls, get to work.
The boss is here.

58
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,824
Everybody does what they want.
No management.

59
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,728
Come on, Jumbo.

60
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:07,979
Mary. Come on, get back up there.

61
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,739
What are you, a quitter?

62
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,544
I'll never be able to do it, Kitty.
I've tried and I've tried.

63
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,711
And you'll keep trying
and trying and trying.

64
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,683
- Here you are, Leona.
- Thank you, Kitty.

65
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,713
Hey, Kitty! Kitty!

66
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,194
- George! You did it. Oh, I knew you could.
- Thanks, Kitty.

67
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:10,661
You see what hard work does?
Oh, George.

68
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,324
All right, hold it.

69
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,255
Stop this show!

70
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,069
Hold it!

71
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,671
- Yes?
- Where's Pop Wonder?

72
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,781
Oh, well, Pop's busy right now.
I'm his daughter, Kitty.

73
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,473
- Can I help you?
- Very simply.

74
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,517
- Just cross my palm with $260.
- I'll take 150.

75
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,656
- Make mine 70.
- Would you mind stepping outside, please?

76
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,884
We can talk better out here.
You know how sensitive artists are.

77
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,553
I'm a little sensitive myself,
particularly about not being paid...

78
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,529
...for enough chow to feed an army.
- Ten tons of hay.

79
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,727
I've been swindled
out of 300 feet of prime lumber.

80
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,835
Gentlemen, please,
no one's been swindled.

81
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,966
You mean so far. Well, I'm taking
my food back to town right now.

82
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,147
Oh, well, you wouldn't
do a thing like that.

83
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:14,308
No? Just watch me. I've had dealings
with you circus people before.

84
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,249
Well, I know you have.

85
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,549
And think of all the nice profits
you've made too.

86
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:25,252
I'll bet you don't get a bunch of suckers
like us every day, now do you?

87
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,664
Paying those top prices you charge us.

88
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,201
- I declare.
- So far you haven't paid us anything.

89
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,963
- Oh, but we're going to.
- When?

90
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:38,269
Tonight. Gentlemen, we'll be sold out.
Every seat.

91
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:42,345
So if you come back after the performance,
you'll all be paid in full.

92
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:48,245
Well, all right, Miss Wonder.
I'll take your word for it this time.

93
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,753
- It's against my better judgment...
- Thank you very much, sir.

94
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,188
We'll dang well be back tonight.

95
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,684
I know you will.

96
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,396
I'll be looking forward to seeing you.

97
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,535
They gone?

98
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,902
For now, yes. But they'll
dang well be back tonight.

99
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,908
You did it, again, Kitten.
I'm proud of you.

100
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,739
I wish I was.

101
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,008
Oh, Pop, how long
can we go on like this?

102
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,815
One day, they'll come along
and attach every asset we've got.

103
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,616
- Including Jumbo.
- Jumbo? They wouldn't dare.

104
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:30,490
Why, he's like a son to me.
You can even see the resemblance.

105
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,860
Oh, Pop, let's hope we're still laughing
on the way to jail.

106
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,769
See you at the parade.

107
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,033
Go hay up, you beautiful beast.

108
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,490
Hold it.

109
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,253
- We had a dinner date last night.
- I'm sorry, Lu. I got tied up.

110
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,195
Yeah. So did I.
Cooking a 12-course dinner.

111
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,802
I figured around 1 you
weren't gonna show up...

112
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,494
...so I ate it myself.

113
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,572
- Gee, Lu, l...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

114
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,175
You ever try eating
a 12-course dinner for two?

115
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,243
Not that I mind, no.

116
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,642
It's just that I'm...
I'm a lousy cook.

117
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,178
- You gonna help me with this or ain't you?
- Of course.

118
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,255
Incidentally, you know what today is?

119
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,359
Certainly I know what today is.

120
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,397
It's your birthday.
Happy birthday, Lulu.

121
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,669
"Happy birthday, Lulu." It ain't
my birthday. I don't have birthdays.

122
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,567
- It's our 14th anniversary.
- No fooling?

123
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,608
No fooling. Today we've been engaged
exactly 14 years.

124
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,713
No. It seems like yesterday.

125
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,076
Not to me, it doesn't.

126
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,215
Lulu, tell you what.

127
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,679
You and I'll have dinner tonight.
We'll celebrate.

128
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:10,055
And I'll do the cooking.
It'll be just you and me and Jumbo.

129
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,932
I sure wished I knew
what was gonna happen.

130
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,837
Kitty?

131
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,945
Coming.

132
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,288
- Yes, Joey?
- Murph and Gogo just quit the show.

133
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,755
We're gonna be short on clowns.
Do you think you can fill in?

134
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,987
- Here we go again. I'll try.
- Good girl.

135
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,977
Anybody home?

136
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,915
Yes?

137
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,717
My name is Sam Rawlins.
I'm looking for a job.

138
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,751
- Oh? Doing what?
- Anything and everything.

139
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,723
- They told me to see you.
- You've been with it before?

140
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,919
- All my life.
- What shows?

141
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,463
You name it, I've worked it.

142
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,001
Here today, gone tomorrow, huh?

143
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,797
Sorry, we're full up.

144
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,596
Not from what I hear.

145
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,574
You must be pretty short-handed
when a girl has to double a clown.

146
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,309
Look, would you excuse me, please?
I have a parade in 10 minutes.

147
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,083
Hey, that's quite an improvement.

148
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,486
I could be a big help to you, Miss Wonder.
Take me on for a week.

149
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,892
Lf, at the end of that time,
you don't like me, I'm on my way.

150
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,532
I'm sorry, but we don't hire sunshiners.

151
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,294
I'm just a circus bum, huh?

152
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,967
Okay.

153
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,275
Wait a minute. If you're hungry,
go by the cookhouse.

154
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,608
- Tell them I said it's all right.
- Thanks.

155
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,114
I'm looking for a job, not a handout.

156
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,726
- Did you hear that applause, Kitten?
- I sure did.

157
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,699
Did you ever think
in a few days...

158
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,464
...we'll be miles away,
but they'll remember...

159
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,473
...this night at the circus
the rest of their lives.

160
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,204
That's kind of a nice thing
to be able to do for people.

161
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,540
Yep.

162
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,724
It went great, Al. Why don't you
try the traveling triple tomorrow?

163
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:02,032
I can do better than that.
Tomorrow I'm traveling to Cincinnati.

164
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,639
Cincinnati?

165
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,776
The John Noble show offered me money.

166
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,912
Money. That's all they think about.
Money, money.

167
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,877
He hasn't been paid in two months.

168
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,483
Never mind, let him work for Noble.
Who cares?

169
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,552
I'm almost ready with the cannon act
I been perfecting.

170
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,714
It's going great, Hansel.

171
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,826
I think we could stand another spot
in that second half.

172
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,521
What's that supposed to mean?

173
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,928
He says he won't work
with a hungry bear.

174
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,864
He did? Why, you can't quit.

175
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,197
- Where's your loyalty?
- Don't get excited.

176
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,170
There's nothing you can do.
If he leaves, he leaves.

177
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,708
Why, if it wasn't for me, you'd be a rug.

178
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,614
- What's going on?
- They're quitting.

179
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,274
- Quitting.
- Quitting?

180
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,250
Oh, Gretel, I'm gonna miss you.

181
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:58,020
I'd like to know where we're gonna find
another bear act in Willow Falls, Iowa.

182
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,692
What a night!

183
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,773
Ladies and gentlemen, the Wonder Circus
takes enormous pleasure and pride...

184
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:18,007
...in presenting to you now,
the mightiest monster in the whole world.

185
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,948
Stolen from the Rajah of Rangoon...

186
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:27,122
...8 thousand pounds
of pulchritudinous pachyderm...

187
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,691
...the one and only...

188
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,852
...Jumbo!

189
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,838
Ladies and gentlemen...

190
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:03,174
...may I have your attention, please.

191
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,784
One of the most spectacular acts
ever presented anywhere in the world...

192
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,786
...high over the center ring,
walking the high wire...

193
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:16,017
...with his face completely hooded,
with no net beneath him...

194
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,185
...with any misstep a dive to death...

195
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:23,925
...the great, the incomparable, Mantino!

196
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,637
The great Mantino!

197
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,145
Where is he?

198
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,610
The great Mantino.

199
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,448
- Have you seen him anywhere?
- Not since the parade.

200
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,819
- I bet he's quit too.
- Oh, no.

201
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,014
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

202
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,602
Ladies and gentlemen...

203
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:11,037
...during the next few dangerous minutes,
I ask that each and every one of you...

204
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,234
...be absolutely silent.

205
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,345
The great Mant...

206
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:42,623
And now, my friends,
the Wonder Circus proudly presents...

207
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,860
...the grand finale of the show.
- Hey, Kitty, who's he?

208
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,096
- Who's who?
- The tourist who just walked the high wire.

209
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,902
Don't be silly, Lulu. Mantino.

210
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:57,707
- And all the other lovable characters
out of Mother Goose.

211
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,044
- What were you doing on...?
- What about that job?

212
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,450
Where is Mantino?

213
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,957
Last I saw of the great man,
he was hotfooting it to the train.

214
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,254
- Oh, that John Noble show.
- That's right.

215
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,729
What are you doing in his wardrobe?

216
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,427
I convinced him the least he could do
was leave his gear behind.

217
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,637
You didn't tell me
you were a high-wire man.

218
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,537
I've done the trick on the low.
The only difference is a few feet.

219
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,274
Do you know you could've been killed?

220
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,679
I could also be run over by a beer wagon
crossing Main Street.

221
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,116
But I always look both ways.

222
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,151
Don't miss your cue, Miss Wonder.

223
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,709
Just a minute, you.

224
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,682
I don't know who you are,
young fella...

225
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:18,055
...but nobody works this show
without the owner's permission.

226
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:22,255
And from now on,
you've got my permission.

227
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,901
Come on, let's talk it over.
What's your name?

228
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,970
- Sam Rawlins.
- The job pays 40 bucks a week, Sam.

229
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,106
Some weeks.

230
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,939
Tina.

231
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,075
Tina, what are you...?
Where are you going?

232
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,047
I wanted to sneak out.
I couldn't bear to say goodbye.

233
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,052
- Oh, Tina.
- It's not my idea, it's Harry's.

234
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,520
Well, I hope Harry has some more ideas.

235
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:52,389
Like how are we gonna find
a trumpet player in Willow Falls, Iowa.

236
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:56,294
Sorry. I'm not supposed to tell you,
but some of the other musicians...

237
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,934
...are walking too. Come on.

238
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:01,765
Wait a minute. Stay here, please.
I'll have your money in two minutes.

239
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:05,705
- Listen...
- Please! You'll get every cent, I promise.

240
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:11,342
- Oh, I could just cry.
- You probably will.

241
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,141
Eddie!

242
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,651
- Oh, hi.
- Get me the cash box, would you?

243
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,255
- We sure had a good night.
- We sure can use it.

244
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,517
- Eight hundred dollars.
- Thanks.

245
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,459
- Pop!
- I tried to talk him out of it.

246
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,862
He said he was gonna win back
what he lost to surprise you.

247
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,629
- How much of a head start does he have?
- Not much.

248
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,294
That's enough.

249
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:59,390
Well, look what the wind blew in.
Interested in a little snooker, honey?

250
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:05,333
- Where do you hide the crap game?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

251
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,367
There's no crap game here.

252
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,473
Come on, lady luck,
for your old buddy Pop.

253
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,370
Let's see that natural.

254
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,238
Thank you.

255
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,346
- Here goes. Double or nothing.
- Nothing!

256
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,913
- Kitten.
- Nothing, Pop.

257
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:22,746
I happened to be strolling through town
when I ran into a brother Elk.

258
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,182
So I see.

259
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,948
Well, the game is over, Pop.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

260
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,560
I'm sorry too, but that's not your father's.
That's his stake.

261
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,356
Fifty! That's all you have left?

262
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,464
That's the situation that prevails.

263
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,532
Oh, Pop.

264
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,997
Pop. I came to tell you to get back
to the lot. There's trouble.

265
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,698
- What trouble? What's the matter?
- Jumbo's sick.

266
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:49,209
- Jumbo! I can't leave you in no pool hall.
- It's all right, Pop.

267
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,678
Mr. Rawlins will see me safely home.
Now, be careful.

268
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,284
- You permit ladies to play?
- Your money's good.

269
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,046
- Roll for the 50.
- Hold it. Why don't you go home?

270
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,553
Because I...

271
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:04,752
- I wanna win back some of that money.
- You've got 50. Hang on to it.

272
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,591
Fifty dollars is about as much use to me
as three cigar-store coupons.

273
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,199
You know what you're doing?

274
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:14,531
While other little girls were dressing dolls,
I was rolling fours the hard way.

275
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,138
Now give me those dice.

276
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,264
All right.

277
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,903
Place your bets, men.

278
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,340
- Right there
- There's 20.

279
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:23,775
Easy money.

280
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,916
- Come on.
- Rub off snake eyes, boxcars, trey.

281
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:30,110
Rub on sevens any day.

282
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,949
- Hey, she did it.
- Beginner's luck.

283
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,920
- Never do it again.
- Shoot the 100.

284
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,684
- I got 50 of it.
- I'll take 10.

285
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,192
- Forty.
- All down? All down?

286
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:44,130
Four and a three or a five and a two,
even a six and one will do.

287
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,292
- It did!
- Oh, no.

288
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,698
Is that fortunate?

289
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:50,431
I wouldn't say that.

290
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,871
- Shoot the 200.
- I'll take part.

291
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,739
- All right.
- There's 10 right there.

292
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,144
- Sixty dollars says she can't.
- You seem to be the big winner.

293
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:03,412
- Don't you feel like covering the rest?
- The lady asked a question. Be polite.

294
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,316
- Paid it.
- Thank you.

295
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,687
All good children go to heaven,
all good dice will roll a seven.

296
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,262
- Not a seven, just an eleven.
- Four in a row.

297
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,591
- Told you not to let her...
- Gentlemen.

298
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,961
I'll give you all a chance to recoup.

299
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,069
- Shoot the 400.
- No, I gotta get...

300
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,171
Now, just a minute.

301
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,866
In nice games, nobody walks out a winner
unless the loser quits.

302
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,874
And this is a nice game, isn't it?

303
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,706
Or it was until now.

304
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,575
Get it up, boys.

305
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,716
I said, get it up!

306
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,719
That's 15.

307
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,553
There's 155.

308
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,591
- That's the rest of it.
- Shoot, Miss Wonder.

309
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:47,321
Dice, I need $800 and I need it bad.

310
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:51,763
Come on, dice, once more.
Once more. All the way.

311
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,130
- You forgot the rhyme!
- Read them and weep!

312
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,469
Let's get out of here.

313
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,809
Eighty, 90, 800.

314
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,919
I wanna thank you for your help too.

315
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:16,153
With my luck, I ought to give up the circus
and hang around poolrooms.

316
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,591
Yeah. I'd keep these with me, though,
if I were you.

317
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:22,357
- Why?
- Sort of special.

318
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,930
- How special?
- They're loaded.

319
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,197
- Loaded?
- You've been playing with loaded dice.

320
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,705
- What?
- That's all right. So was your father.

321
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,571
They rang a pair of cheaters on him
the second roll.

322
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:38,613
I was trying to figure a way to ring in mine,
when you solved the problem.

323
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,079
Well...

324
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:45,020
- You mean when you gave me those dice...?
- I switched in the specials.

325
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,418
I thought they did pretty good.

326
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,321
- You've got a touch of larceny in you.
- A little.

327
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:58,362
Old magician friend of mine
gave me these on my 9th birthday.

328
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:02,301
"Boy," he said, "don't use them
unless the other fellow draws first."

329
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,039
So tonight was one of those nights.

330
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,778
Wait a minute.
You bet against those dice.

331
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,541
I thought it might look a little better.

332
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,048
- How much did you lose?
- Thirty-five dollars.

333
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,311
I'll take care of that right now.

334
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,182
Oh, dear.

335
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,086
There you are. Thank you.

336
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,860
And I do mean thank you.

337
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:39,603
Twenty, 40, 60. Right, Harry?
Six weeks' salary.

338
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:43,234
- Please, don't say anything to anybody.
- Money! Money! Payday!

339
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:46,746
Money. Hey, come on,
I haven't been paid for seven weeks.

340
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,249
And they took every dime of it too.

341
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:59,262
Of course, everybody's paid off now,
but we can't expect miracles every night.

342
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,919
She means you, Diamond Jim.

343
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:04,033
Kitten, I swear it'll never happen again.

344
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,364
If I ever go near that little ticket wagon,
so help me...

345
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:11,974
...I'll have myself arrested for petty arsony.
- Well, we'll talk about that later.

346
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,975
Right now, we have to come up
with acts for Chatsburg.

347
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:18,808
- Alonzo ain't gonna be easy to replace.
- He sure isn't.

348
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,144
Say, what about Borzoni?

349
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,287
- He does a pretty good turn.
- Borzoni's with John Noble.

350
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,479
Signed up last week.

351
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,520
- How do you know that?
- I'm a scholar. I read Billboard.

352
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:35,591
John Noble. That name, why,
it sticks me like a crow in the throat.

353
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,566
Hiring away my talent.
Stealing acts out from under my very nose.

354
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:41,727
And why should he do that, Mr. Wonder?

355
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,332
- Because he wants Jumbo.
- Oh, now, Pop.

356
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,100
But he'll never get him.

357
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:50,542
I haven't got my crystal ball with me,
but I think we're going on a long voyage.

358
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,581
- The creditors!
- I forgot about them.

359
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,015
Just tell them I was mauled
by a wild camel.

360
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,916
Well, here we go again.

361
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,784
Good luck, Kitten.

362
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:09,631
Evening, Miss Wonder.
I suppose you know why we're here.

363
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,961
I have the most wonderful news.

364
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:14,626
We're gonna need triple the supplies
we ordered.

365
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,864
- That so?
- We have to stay extra days...

366
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,769
...by popular demand.
- Our money?

367
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,933
- We'll need 50 tons of hay.
- Our money?

368
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,579
- Food for these people.
- Do you have our money?

369
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,239
- Well, not just this minute. But tomorrow...
- Marshal!

370
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,214
Marshal? Oh, marshal.

371
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,685
- You'd better tell her.
- I have a writ here against the circus.

372
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,221
A writ?

373
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,692
Gentlemen, I'm just a woman.

374
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,159
I don't know anything about these things.
What does that mean?

375
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,163
Means you're out of business
till we get paid.

376
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,525
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

377
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,762
Oh, gentlemen, you can't do this to us.

378
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,375
You can't put all these dear people
out of work.

379
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,010
Why, the circus is their whole life.

380
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,112
And think what it is they're doing.

381
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,841
They're bringing joy and laughter
to little children.

382
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,417
Shouldn't your band play
"Hearts and Flowers"?

383
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,350
All right, so you hate kids.

384
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,922
But the law is the law
and you can't touch us.

385
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:11,925
Under the State Penal Code, Section 372,
and I quote...

386
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:15,462
You can quote the law to Judge Ellis.
He's my brother.

387
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,965
Help! Mad elephant! Mad elephant!
Run for your lives! Help!

388
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,626
Lulu, what happened?

389
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,864
Call out the militia! Call out the militia!

390
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,008
- Pop?
- Jumbo. He's on a rampage again.

391
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,303
- What?
- Mad elephant. Take to the wagons.

392
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,743
- There's no mad elephant.
- Ask the three he trampled to death.

393
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,440
- Get me the elephant gun.
- You can't kill Jumbo.

394
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,109
- It's him or us!
- Mister, I'm a little too...

395
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:56,238
We did it. All right, Jumbo,
start cleaning up.

396
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:59,967
You naughty boy,
I'm gonna give you a kiss.

397
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:04,638
Good Jumbo. Harry, flag's down.
Start loading.

398
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:08,946
Flag's down. Start loading.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

399
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,611
Relax, they won't find us this soon.

400
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,647
Certainly not.
Besides, we're gonna pay them, ain't we?

401
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,808
- When?
- We'll discuss that at intervals.

402
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,546
Anyway, my intentions are honorable.

403
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,850
- They always are, Pop.
- Yeah.

404
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:52,256
Say, who are you knitting that for?
Me or Jumbo?

405
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,420
Lu, do you want another doughnut?

406
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,465
Well, I don't wanna see them
go to waste.

407
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,501
Say, Pop. What about this Sam Rawlins?

408
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,661
I like him. No, thanks.

409
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,206
He's a very nice, talented young man.

410
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:10,836
Don't you think it's kind of funny
that he just popped up out of nowhere?

411
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,276
Why?

412
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:15,077
You know darn well he could get twice
what we pay.

413
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,686
- Yeah. If we pay him.
- Yeah.

414
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:20,789
What's funny about it?
He's circus, like us.

415
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:24,449
Why, we'd die if we weren't with it.
Same with him.

416
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,459
Maybe so.

417
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,191
I must admit,
he's not the usual sunshiner.

418
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,460
No, he isn't, dear.

419
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,366
Say, what have you got
against sunshiners?

420
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,940
Why, I was a circus bum myself once.

421
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,807
And that'll be just about enough
out of you.

422
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,845
- Can I see you a minute, Pop?
- Sure.

423
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:49,679
Yeah, we were just talking about you.
Kitty was saying that we have...

424
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:53,118
- Would you like some coffee and doughnuts?
- Nothing, thanks.

425
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,226
If you're worried about anyone following,
there's a side road a mile ahead.

426
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:59,954
It's a few hours longer,
but it might be safer.

427
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:05,033
My boy, that's a masterpiece of strategy,
and we thank you for the suggestion.

428
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,896
Right, Kitten?

429
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,068
Right.

430
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,286
Wanna tell Whitey about the turnoff?

431
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,183
Yeah. And I wanna talk to you
about an act.

432
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,654
It's about shooting a guy
out of a cannon.

433
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,919
It'll be the biggest thing
in show business.

434
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:35,424
- What were you two looking at?
- Your palm.

435
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,828
- You embarrassed me.
- Let me see your palm.

436
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,229
That's for suckers.

437
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:43,168
Well, you know what Barnum always said:
"There's one born every second."

438
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,867
- Hey, you know what?
- No. And don't tell me, I don't wanna know.

439
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:50,012
It's witchcraft. Any intelligent person...

440
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,808
- "Wow" what?
- "Wow" wow.

441
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,882
- You really see something?
- Yeah.

442
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:58,077
I see a man. He's tall, dark...

443
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,279
...and handsome.
- And handsome.

444
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,085
You are such a faker.

445
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,591
Did you ever see anyone short,
fat and ugly?

446
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,525
Yep. In the mirror.

447
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,825
I don't have to read your palm,
it's written all over your face.

448
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,561
- What's written all over?
- He's a good-looking guy, don't you think?

449
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,638
- Yes.
- See, see?

450
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,933
He's young, healthy and smart.

451
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,973
- You know something else?
- No, what?

452
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,238
He likes you too.

453
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:28,145
- Oh, Lulu. For heaven's sake.
- But he does too like...

454
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,617
Kitten, don't you ever think
of getting married?

455
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:36,519
Not more than three or four times a day.

456
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,991
With me, it's on the hour.

457
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,187
You know, Lu, I figured it out.

458
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:45,733
The trouble with us is,
we move too fast. We do.

459
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:49,838
Before we can find out the color
of a man's eyes, we're in the next town.

460
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:54,033
Well, that may be all right with you,
but don't forget I'm no spring chicken.

461
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,644
Oh, fiddle. You're not old.

462
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,110
Yeah, I know.

463
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,772
As a matter of fact,
the day before yesterday...

464
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,215
...I had a growing pain. It went sideways.

465
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,247
Oh, gosh.

466
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:26,150
Well, Sam, how are things with you?

467
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:28,688
- Pretty good.
- And with the Wonder Circus?

468
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:30,389
Perfect.

469
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:35,361
Every night when we pull up stakes,
I stick around and pay off the creditors.

470
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:39,365
They sign the receipts and
credit the payment to you.

471
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,031
Good, good.

472
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:45,834
- There you are, Richards. All paid.
- They don't care as long as they get money.

473
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:49,843
In three or four weeks, we'll successfully
have stolen the Wonder show.

474
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,140
- Stolen?
- Excuse me.

475
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,782
Absorbed.

476
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,919
Sam, what's it like over there?

477
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,752
What do you do, really?

478
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:07,692
Little of everything. Repair rigging,
collect tickets, take a few leaps.

479
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:11,300
- I also double as the Great Mantino.
- On the high wire?

480
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:14,834
You haven't worked it for years.
You do use a net, of course?

481
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,871
A net's no use unless you fall.
I don't intend to fall.

482
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:22,535
I didn't send you there to break your neck.
From now on, you use a net...

483
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,680
...or give up the turn. Understand?

484
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:28,544
Suppose I don't? What'll you do?
Send me to bed without my supper?

485
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:33,781
Sam, there's something about your attitude.
Something that puzzles me.

486
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,321
What is it?

487
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:37,925
Well, I'll tell you, Dad.

488
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:42,224
- I don't like the way you call me "Dad."
- All right, I'll call you "Father."

489
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:44,195
That's better.

490
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,358
Go on.

491
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,362
I don't like what I'm doing.

492
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:54,174
All we want is Jumbo,
why ruin a whole circus?

493
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,437
I tried to buy Jumbo. You know that.
They won't sell.

494
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:59,581
Pop Wonder is a sentimental old fool.

495
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,013
That doesn't make it any easier for me.

496
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,450
I never made things easy for you, Sam.

497
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:09,113
I brought you up in the roughest,
toughest way I could think of...

498
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:13,251
...and when you could stand on your feet,
I threw you to the wolves.

499
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,227
Why? So when the time came,
you'd have the strength...

500
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,299
...to do the things required of you.

501
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:22,165
- Meaning to do what you want.
- Meaning to carry on where I leave off.

502
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:27,002
We're building something here.
The greatest show on the face of the earth.

503
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,667
- I wonder about that.
- What?

504
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,872
What is this big drive of yours?

505
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,485
"The greatest show on the face
of the earth." Why?

506
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,552
Why does it have to be?

507
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:43,588
I don't know, Sam. Maybe because
I wanna bring something to people.

508
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,251
More than just a show. A spectacle.

509
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,522
No, more than that.

510
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,426
A miracle.

511
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:56,638
One miraculous, shining hour,
that they couldn't forget if they tried.

512
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,133
You know, it's funny...

513
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,768
...you and Pop Wonder,
you both want the same thing.

514
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,508
You just go about it differently.

515
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,482
I've gotta get my train.

516
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:15,419
Better take some more money.

517
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,151
Sam...

518
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,990
...you're not going to let me down.

519
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,465
I guess not.

520
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,667
Cash on the line, that's my motto.

521
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,901
- When Old Man Wonder says...
- Sign that.

522
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:38,137
Yes, sir. When Old Man Wonder says
I'll pay you tomorrow...

523
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,613
...I says tomorrow, this stuff is gonna be
back under the shed.

524
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,479
- Sam!
- That's what I said.

525
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,717
Dave, you can unload now.

526
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,199
How did you manage that?

527
01:03:57,366 --> 01:04:01,826
- Pop said he wouldn't leave the supplies.
- Passes to the show plus a little charm.

528
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:06,270
- You must have a pretty good line of talk.
- Yeah, I'm a conversational wizard.

529
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,581
- Morning, Sam.
- Morning.

530
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,218
What's the matter with him?

531
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,660
I don't know.

532
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:28,888
Every time I try to speak to him lately,
he runs out on me.

533
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,499
Yeah? Maybe he's just playing
hard to get.

534
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,832
Who wants him?

535
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,231
You do.

536
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:39,204
- I think he knows it too.
- Well, I'm certainly not going to chase him.

537
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,036
Why not?

538
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,407
What do you think I am, Lulu?

539
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,242
A red-blooded American girl.
Now, go get him.

540
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,977
Well, go on.

541
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,622
Happy hunting.

542
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,884
I'm not hunting.

543
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,553
I'm just stalking him a little.

544
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:14,976
Need any help?

545
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,529
Need any help?

546
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,690
We could use a good rigger.

547
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:42,565
We had one. He quit in Kansas City
to join the John Noble show.

548
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:46,105
- I'd better check the traps.
- Next season we're gonna have...

549
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:16,103
As I was saying, next year
we're going to have all new equipment.

550
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:19,708
- New canvas, new rigging, costumes...
- Where did you learn to fly?

551
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,775
My mother taught me.

552
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:25,072
Pop says everything new, down
to the horses on the carousel.

553
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:28,546
- How old is that dream?
- A few years.

554
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,652
I thought so.

555
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,679
Where would you be without dreams?

556
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:37,087
- You just wait and see.
- Don't count on me.

557
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:40,353
I may not be around to drink in
all this beauty.

558
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,890
- Are you going to leave?
- I'm a sunshiner, remember?

559
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:48,696
- I like to keep on the move.
- Well, people do change, you know.

560
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,675
- People do change.
- Yeah.

561
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,213
Did you get a better offer?

562
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,154
The Noble show, maybe?

563
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,584
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.
You'll hate them.

564
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,022
- Wanna know what's wrong with them?
- No, tell me.

565
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,495
- They're only in it for the money.
- Yeah.

566
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,726
- I can't say the same for the Wonder Circus.
- That's right.

567
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:58,704
The way you run this outfit is an invitation
for someone to walk in and take over.

568
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,748
Looks pretty good, huh?

569
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,829
You have a very
successful love life.

570
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,095
- I see a proposal soon.
- Hiya, chief.

571
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,529
He's mad about you.

572
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,301
- Oh, you lucky, girl, you.
- Who?

573
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,808
Look at that love line.

574
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,483
Dirt. Morning, Anthony.
I knew I couldn't be that lucky.

575
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:39,917
You're luckier than you think.
I got something for you, poopsie.

576
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:43,016
- It wouldn't be a wedding ring?
- Wedding ring?

577
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,059
Lulu, I'm gonna give you the world.
Come on.

578
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:47,889
Thanks. I'd rather have a ring.

579
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:51,464
For years you've been asking for an act
under the big top, right?

580
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,362
- Yeah.
- Well, you got it.

581
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,299
- You wouldn't fool me, would you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

582
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:58,872
- You mean, an act of my own?
- Yeah, yeah.

583
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,238
Oh, Anthony, I'm so excited.
Well, what do I do?

584
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,603
Bye!

585
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:10,284
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing yet, and that's the way I like it.

586
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:13,910
Are you out of your mind?
I'm offering you a chance of a lifetime.

587
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:18,420
The golden opportunity
to be shot out of a cannon.

588
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,289
Where's your gratitude?

589
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,896
Where my heart is. In my throat.

590
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,124
- Okay.
- Okay.

591
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,029
Forget it.

592
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:29,227
I guess you just ain't circus, Lulu.

593
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,805
No sawdust in your veins.

594
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:34,875
I'll perform the trick myself.

595
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,495
Give me that.

596
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,359
Don't tell me I ain't circus.

597
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,592
I'm just as full of sawdust as anybody.

598
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:02,202
And nobody's gonna do my trick
except me.

599
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:04,464
Even if it is only once.

600
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,336
- Good girl.
- Good girl.

601
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:12,110
Oh, Anthony, are you sure it's safe?

602
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,977
Would I do anything to hurt you?

603
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,880
I'm gonna make you a star.

604
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,783
A shooting star.
How high do I go?

605
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,356
Thirty-four feet,
10 and three-quarter inches.

606
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:25,550
I figured it out mathematically.

607
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,854
- And where do I land?
- Right over there.

608
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,158
- Yeah. Right over...
- Like a babe in a downy crib.

609
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,761
Boys, move that crib three feet back!

610
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:40,138
What goes up, must come down.

611
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,573
You sure you're right about
your arithmetic?

612
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:47,078
- What marks did you get in school?
- Will you please stop worrying? Please?

613
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:49,479
This is scientific.

614
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:53,012
A smidgen to the left, boys.

615
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:59,084
- Put yourself in my hands.
- Okay, Anthony. Anything you say, dear.

616
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,786
That's it. No, no.
You gotta get in backwards.

617
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:04,865
- Backwards!
- Yes. This is scientific.

618
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,864
This is gonna be great for you.

619
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,367
- Really great.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

620
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:12,666
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Good luck, Anthony.

621
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,604
Thank you.

622
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,988
Hey. What am I doing in a cannon?

623
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:34,959
Don't lose faith, Lulu.
Think of your name in lights.

624
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,566
- What happened to my lifeline?
- It's just stuck.

625
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,300
Don't breathe.

626
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:51,602
A snip to the right.

627
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,408
No, I mean the left.

628
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:59,620
Now, this may mean
the difference of success and calamity.

629
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,955
Ready out there, boys?

630
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:06,357
Here comes Lulu.

631
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,491
Lulu, Lulu, you're going on a trip.

632
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,966
Anthony, dear.

633
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,373
I've changed my mind.

634
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,109
Help.

635
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:28,548
Lulu?

636
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:35,248
I disintegrated her.

637
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,426
Lulu, speak to me.

638
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:49,633
I can't figure out what went wrong.
Maybe I didn't use enough gunpowder.

639
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,964
She had enough in her hair
to hold her own Fourth of July.

640
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,836
And next time you try it, use a dummy.

641
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,638
He already did.

642
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:00,213
I apologized, didn't I?
What more can I do?

643
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:03,783
- Pop?
- Come in, Sam, but don't light any matches.

644
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,920
I heard you shot Lulu
out of a cannon.

645
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:10,650
That's a lie. Due to a small miscalculation,
she slid out backwards.

646
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:13,954
- You all right, Lulu?
- She's as sound as a bell. Tell him.

647
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:16,256
Ding-dong.

648
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:17,796
What did I tell you?

649
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,230
You know better
than to fool with gunpowder.

650
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:23,838
You could've blown her out of the big top.
Don't try that again.

651
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:27,339
- All right, all right.
- Yeah, and it's all right with me too.

652
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,773
There's enough trouble
without looking for it.

653
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:31,606
We've got a busted generator...

654
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,214
...a torn main top
and a lion with a toothache.

655
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,874
A perfectly normal day.

656
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:41,148
- I like that boy.
- I saw him first.

657
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,518
There you are.
Completely non-inflammable.

658
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:45,250
- Okay. Thanks, Kitten.
- Pop?

659
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,861
The toot box on the carousel
won't play a note.

660
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,861
- Hear that, Kitten?
- I heard it.

661
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:52,865
- Perfectly normal day.
- You know what I think, Lu?

662
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:56,102
Whatever it is, no.

663
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,566
I can't see anything wrong.

664
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,473
You can't see nothing
because you ain't no toot-box expert.

665
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:07,410
- And neither am I.
- Well...

666
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:11,412
I think you better go get Sam.
Maybe he could...

667
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:14,312
- Hi, Sam.
- Watch it.

668
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:18,059
- Think you could fix this thing?
- Well, I can try.

669
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:29,199
You're very chipper this morning,
Mr. Rawlins.

670
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:33,202
Any special reason?
Or are you just tired of being a grouch?

671
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,275
I feel okay.

672
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:39,811
- What's that you're whistling?
- A song.

673
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:46,618
- Well, I thought it might be. What song?
- "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World."

674
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:17,747
Sam?

675
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,558
Sam?

676
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:35,867
I'm going into town,
and I thought maybe...

677
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:44,309
- It's a beautiful day and l...
- I can't. I'm working.

678
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,509
Hand me that screwdriver, will you?

679
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,916
Here. Here.

680
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:08,434
- Here.
- Thanks.

681
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,969
You better take an umbrella.
It might rain.

682
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:15,773
And there I was, covered with mud,
and all he did was laugh.

683
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:20,080
- You don't have to be so sore about it.
- I'm sore at myself.

684
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:24,956
- Did you ever throw yourself at a man?
- Yeah.

685
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:28,186
Lots of times.
And, boy, was my aim bad.

686
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:26,551
Everybody stay in your seats!

687
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:30,815
Hold it!
Everything's gonna be all right!

688
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:33,290
Everybody stay in your seats!

689
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,532
Help us, please.

690
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:49,574
Come on, I need some help.

691
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:53,145
Hurry up. Come on.
Get them down! Get them down!

692
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:58,214
- Come on, come on! Get them down!
- They won't unfold!

693
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,411
Get the catch net, quick.

694
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:04,484
Hold on. Hold on.

695
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:08,459
- Get us down!
- We can't. The ropes are fouled.

696
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:10,063
We're getting a catch net.

697
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:13,792
All right, come on, guys, get it in here.
Get it in here.

698
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:17,737
Okay, fellas, come on.
Straighten it out.

699
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:21,532
All right, girls,
you'll have to jump, one at a time.

700
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:25,338
I'm all right. Get the others first.

701
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,845
Joan. Come on.

702
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:30,945
All right, Joan. All right.

703
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:33,977
All right, Mary.

704
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:35,851
Mary.

705
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:42,824
- All right, Lulu.
- Here I come!

706
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:46,365
- The net's broken.
- The net's busted.

707
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:47,762
That's all right, Lulu.

708
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:50,302
- What happened?
- Easy now. Slide out.

709
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:53,031
- Here, now, all right.
- Lift it up, fellas.

710
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,233
Easy, boys. Easy.

711
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,038
- You all right, Lulu?
- Yeah.

712
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,807
- Are you all right, Bud?
- We got trouble here.

713
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:02,449
Hold on, I'm coming up.

714
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:31,636
Can you make it?

715
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:37,545
I can't reach. You'll have to jump.

716
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,550
Take it easy.

717
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:46,655
Next time.

718
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,588
Now!

719
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:53,900
Good girl. Throw up a rope!

720
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:31,031
- Get her to her tent.
- You all right?

721
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,799
- To her wagon.
- Sam, we're in trouble over here!

722
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,772
Sam! Come on!

723
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:42,978
- You all right, Pop?
- Do I look all right?

724
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,449
What a way to end a brilliant career.

725
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,247
- Where's the big crane?
- Busted.

726
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:50,550
- Don't worry, Pop, we'll get you out.
- Everything's busted.

727
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:53,060
Don't pull so hard, it hurts.

728
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:56,253
- Where is he? Let me through.
- Get this pole off of me.

729
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:59,332
Let me through. Oh, Anthony. Anthony.

730
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:03,659
Don't cry, honey.
My number had to come up sometime.

731
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:06,238
You can't die. You just can't die.

732
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:07,806
- Lu?
- What?

733
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:11,001
Will you see that they bury me
in full clown makeup?

734
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:16,116
- With a big smile painted on my face?
- Oh, Anthony. I love you, Anthony.

735
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:17,911
- There, there.
- I love you.

736
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:21,681
I love you too, Lulu.
You know my one regret?

737
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:25,155
- What? What?
- That we never got married.

738
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:27,317
Honestly?

739
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:30,157
And, you know,
if I had it to do all over again...

740
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:33,300
...we'd get married tomorrow.
- Come on, boys. Get it up.

741
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:34,730
- Oh, Anthony.
- Get it up.

742
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:37,393
That's the most beautiful
proposal a girl ever had.

743
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:40,939
- Pick it up. Pick it up. Steady. Steady.
- Please, Anthony.

744
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:42,440
Steady.

745
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:48,179
- Let me down. Let me down from here.
- You all right, Pop?

746
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:51,375
Not a scratch. I was just a little numb.

747
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:54,453
- My husband!
- Particularly in the head.

748
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:57,352
I talked in my delirium.

749
01:29:57,525 --> 01:30:01,518
- And we're gonna get married tomorrow.
- That's right.

750
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:06,827
And all it took was a small hurricane.
Everything is gonna be all right.

751
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:08,992
Yes, darling.

752
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:19,435
Come on, give me a hand
with this canvas.

753
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:37,063
Oh, Sam, I was scared.

754
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:40,792
For the first time in my life,
I was really scared.

755
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:43,630
For the first time in my life, so was I.

756
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:47,539
I thought I was going to lose you, Kitty.

757
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:05,182
Oh, Sam.

758
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:11,231
- We have so much to talk about.
- Some of it will have to wait, I'm afraid.

759
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:13,629
I'm catching the 2:00 train
out of here.

760
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:18,968
It's not what you think.

761
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,736
There's something...
Some business I have to clear up.

762
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:26,402
I'll be back tomorrow, I promise.

763
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:31,115
- You trust me, don't you?
- Oh, yes, I do.

764
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:34,812
And, Sam,
I want you to know something.

765
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:38,584
I'll never be any trouble to you,
or tie you down.

766
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:42,024
You can go where you want,
and when you want.

767
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:50,536
I wouldn't mind at all
being a sunshiner's wife.

768
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:54,732
That sounds very much like a proposal,
Miss Wonder.

769
01:31:56,644 --> 01:32:00,011
I guess I meant it that way.

770
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:05,512
If you don't mind, I'm sort of old-fashioned.
I'll do the proposing, all right?

771
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,887
- All right.
- Kitty...

772
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:12,822
- Yes, Sam.
...will you marry me?

773
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:18,255
What's the matter with you pushers?
You gotta drop everything you pick up?

774
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:22,562
I always figured when I got around to this,
I'd pick a nice romantic setting.

775
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:29,074
Moonlit night, soft summer breeze,
and somewhere a night bird chirping.

776
01:32:29,243 --> 01:32:31,473
Get a look at this.

777
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:06,096
Bridge washed out
below the junction, mister.

778
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:09,236
Won't be a train
out of here before tonight.

779
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:10,631
Thank you.

780
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:15,305
To tell you the honest truth, I don't know
whether this will fly 100 miles.

781
01:35:15,476 --> 01:35:19,537
- Why don't you walk? It'd be a lot safer.
- Because I'm crazy. Let's go.

782
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,079
It's your neck.

783
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:23,009
Contact!

784
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:38,631
Richards, where's my father?

785
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:40,867
Why are you here?
Anything wrong?

786
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:44,232
Everything's wrong. The whole deal is off.
Now, where is he?

787
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:48,171
- In Vinedale, taking over the Wonder Circus.
- Taking over...?

788
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,917
Where's Lulu?

789
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:10,359
- Pop, she'll be here.
- Is the minister here?

790
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:13,364
- You spoke with him. He's right there.
- What'd I say?

791
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:15,593
You sure I'm supposed to
look like this?

792
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:19,968
- You look beautiful.
- I feel like an undertaker at my own funeral.

793
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:23,542
- Where's Sam? I don't see Sam.
- Sam will be here. Don't worry.

794
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:26,737
I suppose you and him
will be doing this pretty soon, huh?

795
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:31,146
- You'll have to ask Sam about that.
- Just don't be nervous about it, that's all.

796
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:34,549
Look at the time already.
Half past something.

797
01:36:34,722 --> 01:36:37,316
- You don't think Lulu's...?
- Here she comes.

798
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:40,125
Well, look at that.

799
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:45,061
- Look at that girl. A vision!
- Isn't she pretty?

800
01:36:45,232 --> 01:36:49,601
And all this time, I thought
she looked like George Washington.

801
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:11,848
Hey, put that back.
What do you think you're...?

802
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:26,761
- What are you doing to my circus?
- Nothing. I'm taking down my circus.

803
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:28,526
What kind of a joke is this?

804
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:34,072
Mr. Wonder, I have here $30,000
worth of bills against the Wonder Circus.

805
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:37,972
- What?
- You can't have it. We don't owe a cent.

806
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:40,841
- Where did you get these?
- That is not the point.

807
01:38:41,015 --> 01:38:44,473
They've been signed over
to John Noble Enterprises for collection.

808
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:47,587
- I'm collecting.
- This is the foreclosure notice.

809
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:51,384
- You can't do this.
- But you can't take my circus away.

810
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:53,651
I'm Pop Wonder.

811
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:56,219
Where's Sam?

812
01:38:56,397 --> 01:38:58,592
- Sam?
- Sam?

813
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:03,635
- Yes, yes. He ought to be here.
- What would he have to do with you?

814
01:39:03,804 --> 01:39:05,066
Well, he's my son.

815
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:11,041
I'm sorry
it had to be done this way...

816
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:14,977
...but would you like me to make the
announcement to your crew?

817
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:18,482
No. No, I'll make it myself.

818
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:21,120
Tell them they'll all have jobs
with my show.

819
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:23,381
And that goes for you too, Mr. Wonder.

820
01:39:23,557 --> 01:39:25,184
Yeah.

821
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:34,931
It's not so bad for me,
all I lost was a circus.

822
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:40,064
But you, Kitten,
how could he do this to you?

823
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:44,634
It was easy. She was in love with him.

824
01:40:04,264 --> 01:40:07,427
- Pop, what's going on?
- Pop?

825
01:40:07,601 --> 01:40:11,162
- Listen. Listen.
- Quiet, everybody. Quiet.

826
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:13,738
The groom's gonna make a speech.

827
01:40:17,478 --> 01:40:21,107
I got some real good news for you.

828
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:24,307
You know we've had
a little trouble making ends meet.

829
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:29,548
Sometimes they meet in the middle,
sometimes they don't meet at all.

830
01:40:29,823 --> 01:40:34,658
Well, today, through a stroke of
business genius, I got...

831
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:40,164
I got John Noble
to buy out the Pop Wonder Circus.

832
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:43,800
Wait a minute.
He's got jobs for all of you.

833
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:46,906
- What about you, Pop?
- Me?

834
01:40:47,074 --> 01:40:52,535
I'm taking my share and settling down
on a little farm I got my eagle eye on.

835
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:58,117
Besides, I'm getting
sort of old to be a clown.

836
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:01,417
I don't feel so funny anymore.

837
01:41:06,927 --> 01:41:09,896
Pop, you got a minute?

838
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:13,660
How about Jumbo?
Does he go along with this deal?

839
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:17,361
Jumbo. Why, that poor pachyderm
would die without me.

840
01:41:17,538 --> 01:41:19,529
I gotta get him out of here. Fast.

841
01:41:19,706 --> 01:41:22,197
But even if you do,
where you gonna hide him?

842
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:24,344
Hide him?

843
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:30,608
I got a friend in Detroit
with a basement.

844
01:41:32,186 --> 01:41:36,885
Easy now, old boy.
Just make yourself inconspicuous-like.

845
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:42,051
Just walk natural,
as if you were out for a stroll. Not a word.

846
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:44,959
- Not a word.
- Hold it!

847
01:41:45,132 --> 01:41:48,397
Hold it right there!
Where are you going with that elephant?

848
01:41:48,569 --> 01:41:50,560
What elephant?

849
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:55,465
- Come on, men.
- Come on, Jumbo.

850
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:07,177
Yes, sir, mister. Someday people are
gonna be flying all over in these things.

851
01:42:07,521 --> 01:42:10,752
Clear across the continent,
clear across the world.

852
01:42:10,924 --> 01:42:12,687
Someday.

853
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:16,660
But not tonight.

854
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:23,699
- All right, Jumbo.
- Let's go, Jumbo.

855
01:42:34,248 --> 01:42:38,116
Jumbo, hey.
Come on, Jumbo, get up in there.

856
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:47,992
Oh, no, no, no!

857
01:42:48,362 --> 01:42:50,694
No, no...

858
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:05,808
It's all right, Jumb.

859
01:43:06,113 --> 01:43:08,479
Everything's gonna be fine.

860
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:12,216
You just have to do what they tell you,
that's all.

861
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:14,513
And then you won't get hurt.

862
01:43:16,323 --> 01:43:18,985
We don't want you to get hurt, baby.

863
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:22,188
Are you gonna be a good boy?

864
01:43:23,764 --> 01:43:25,823
I love you, Jumb.

865
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:29,232
I love you.

866
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:35,334
And I'm gonna miss you, Jumb.

867
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:39,970
Now, come on. Now, be a big boy...

868
01:43:40,147 --> 01:43:44,743
...and get in there.
Now, come on, Jumbo.

869
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,159
Don't you touch him.

870
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:11,062
Good morning, Mr. Bones.

871
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:14,632
Good morning, Mr. Tambo.
Look at that lovely sun.

872
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:19,534
- Isn't it a scrumptious day for starving?
- Indubitably. But I got a problem.

873
01:51:19,706 --> 01:51:23,699
- And what's that?
- I hate to starve on an empty stomach.

874
01:51:26,813 --> 01:51:29,213
You know, we gotta earn
some money, Mr. Bones.

875
01:51:29,382 --> 01:51:30,747
And how do we do that?

876
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:36,014
- Well, if I had some ham I'd play Hamlet.
- Lf I had some eggs I'd join you.

877
01:51:36,723 --> 01:51:38,588
That's a knee-slapper.

878
01:51:39,893 --> 01:51:43,659
And you know something?
If we had a tree we could have a trio.

879
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:48,164
Yeah. Yeah. But where
can we find a tree?

880
01:51:52,405 --> 01:51:53,963
You idiots.

881
01:54:26,259 --> 01:54:27,590
Kitty.

882
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:32,389
- Wait a minute!
- Take your hands off me!

883
01:54:32,565 --> 01:54:35,227
- Listen! Please listen!
- I listened to you once...

884
01:54:35,401 --> 01:54:38,097
...and you stole a circus.
Did you forget something?

885
01:54:38,271 --> 01:54:40,637
- I want to explain!
- Let go of me!

886
01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:42,230
Put them up!

887
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:45,172
Pop, stop it. Stop it, Pop.
He's not worth it.

888
01:54:45,345 --> 01:54:47,472
Don't hit him, Anthony.
Let me hit him.

889
01:54:47,647 --> 01:54:48,909
Lu!

890
01:54:49,582 --> 01:54:52,779
Now why don't you get out of
here and go back to your father?

891
01:54:52,952 --> 01:54:54,749
I left my father.

892
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:59,858
I know how you feel.

893
01:55:00,326 --> 01:55:03,727
There isn't anything you can say
to me I haven't said to myself.

894
01:55:09,836 --> 01:55:13,602
Please. I want to come back.

895
01:55:15,808 --> 01:55:17,366
I need you.

896
01:55:22,715 --> 01:55:25,047
I need all of you.

897
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:30,882
From the looks of things
around here, you need me.

898
01:55:32,025 --> 01:55:35,722
You call this two-bit carnival a circus?

899
01:55:36,329 --> 01:55:39,628
This isn't even a broken-down sideshow.

900
01:58:32,572 --> 01:58:34,335
Jumbo!
