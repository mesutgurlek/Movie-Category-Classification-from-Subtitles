2
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,791
Bra. Caution.

3
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,500
We go back, Tom.
The storm is coming.

4
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,944
It looks pretty scary,
right?

5
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,195
I'm sitting here behind you, Tom.

6
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,720
E minor.

7
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,687
Proper chord.

8
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:05,204
- Hello?
<i> - Ms. Whitman? Dr. Jansson. </ I>

9
00:03:01,306 --> 00:02:10,377
<i> I have bad news. </ i>

10
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,914
What is it, Princess?
Why not spin?

11
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,125
<i> We must receive your dad again. </ i>

12
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:10,871
<i> Seizures
only comes closer. </ i>

13
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:17,134
<i> This time
it seems pretty serious. </ i>

14
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:09,792
I understand.

15
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:11,955
Mr. Whitman?

16
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:16,127
Tom?

17
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:09,855
<i> - I'll discuss it with you. </ i>
- I will as soon as possible.

18
00:04:01,742 --> 00:03:11,859
<i> Can you hear my voice,
Mr. Whitman? </ i>

19
00:04:04,703 --> 00:03:17,112
<i> Matthew realized the hopelessness.
Nothing had any meaning. </ I>

20
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,367
<i> Mr. White fused
Matthews face. </ i>

21
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,558
<i> Snowman did not talk anymore. </ i>

22
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,711
<i> happy face that Matthew
had loved, was now just slush. </ i>

23
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:12,373
<i> Matthew looked up in the sky </ i>

24
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:16,586
<i> - then last winter snowflakes
descended. </ i>

25
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:19,731
<i> Man said that its touch was magical, - </ i>

26
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:12,374
<i> - but Matthew
no longer believed in fairy tales. </ i>

27
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:17,579
<i> When snowflake touched
Mr. White's hand, - </ i>

28
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:12,377
<i> - disappeared fresh hoar frost
and the pond under the snowman </ i>

29
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:15,564
<i> - crackled when it froze. </ i>

30
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:17,602
<i> Matthew was happy </ i>

31
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:11,389
<i> - when he saw
Mr. White come to life. </ i>

32
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:14,500
<i> last snowflake fairy
was real. </ i>

33
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:18,648
<i> Troll Winter
would never end. </ i>

34
00:05:02,928 --> 00:04:12,389
<i> Bedtime, kids. </ i>

35
00:05:05,430 --> 00:04:14,501
Are you the new kid, Tom?

36
00:05:09,768 --> 00:04:19,655
You built the snowman
in the backyard.

37
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,022
My name is Ann.

38
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,167
What's that? She is beautiful.

39
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:14,916
- Can not you talk?
- I can talk.

40
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:18,110
Are they your parents?

41
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:13,886
It's my mother.
She was sick and ...

42
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:16,037
She's dead now.

43
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:19,108
My father is a pilot.

44
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:22,260
- Is he dead?
- He's not!

45
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:14,933
My father is Theodore Whitman,
a hero.

46
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:19,087
He saved all the passengers
away from the tornado.

47
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:22,270
But he had to make an emergency landing.

48
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:15,976
When he is rescued,
he comes and gets me.

49
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:20,192
- No one here has parents.
<i> - Turn off the light! </ i>

50
00:06:03,572 --> 00:05:12,909
Good night, Tom.

51
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,450
Sleep well, Princess.

52
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:19,081
This should get you melt.

53
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:18,993
Well, well, what have we here?

54
00:08:02,691 --> 00:07:23,188
Nice to see an old friend.

55
00:08:08,488 --> 00:07:20,060
I stood there
in the backyard for myself -

56
00:08:13,452 --> 00:07:24,232
- When I felt a twinge in his arm.
How to say?

57
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,618
It was enough that little thing.

58
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,752
We take a trip
and see where we end up.

59
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,942
Maybe we encounter some
of your old friends.

60
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:22,644
We find such
you've only dreamed about.

61
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:26,809
I must be dreaming.

62
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:29,958
Therefore everything is so strange.

63
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:22,687
Come on, it'll be fun.

64
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:25,815
You're safe with me.

65
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:24,708
Dude,
If you are afraid to join, -

66
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:26,859
- I understand that.

67
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:21,603
Maybe you're not like your father.
Do not worry, keep dreaming.

68
00:09:04,294 --> 00:08:25,745
Or are you with me
on adventures.

69
00:09:12,970 --> 00:08:22,645
It feels real.

70
00:09:15,264 --> 00:08:25,751
Ice and genuine oak.

71
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,188
Come on!

72
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:24,142
There was something
to rest your eyes on!

73
00:10:04,980 --> 00:09:27,289
- What is it?
- Only rotten wood and steel.

74
00:10:09,776 --> 00:09:29,358
Should we look for?

75
00:10:15,407 --> 00:09:25,207
Behold, your father.

76
00:10:26,835 --> 00:00:04,212
Are not you glad
to see him again?

77
00:10:30,005 --> 00:00:06,316
This is just a dream.

78
00:10:32,508 --> 00:00:09,481
More real than it
are not.

79
00:10:47,523 --> 00:00:02,181
Ms. Whitman ...

80
00:10:50,108 --> 00:00:06,332
Your father suffers
vascular dementia.

81
00:10:53,403 --> 00:00:09,462
It comes from repeated infarctions.

82
00:10:56,532 --> 00:00:02,148
We have often talked about the case.

83
00:11:00,160 --> 00:00:06,357
It has.
But considering the state of ...

84
00:11:03,747 --> 00:00:09,415
You will stop treatment.

85
00:11:07,835 --> 00:00:04,233
It is not so.
He is not a machine.

86
00:11:12,214 --> 00:00:07,396
His heart
stopped twice.

87
00:11:15,425 --> 00:00:02,166
- We revived, but now ...
- How am I supposed to sign?

88
00:11:28,146 --> 00:01:04,747
You are making the right choice.

89
00:11:31,358 --> 00:01:07,807
It is best
to let him go.

90
00:11:35,737 --> 00:01:02,597
He has already
lived in a fantasy world for a few years.

91
00:11:38,949 --> 00:01:06,743
He is childhood again.
It had been bad ...

92
00:11:47,124 --> 00:01:04,728
Can I get you home with your father
if we should talk?

93
00:11:54,464 --> 00:01:10,985
You're not flying back
in this weather?

94
00:11:58,719 --> 00:01:02,603
No.

95
00:12:01,555 --> 00:01:07,815
Like that. I'll leave you alone.

96
00:12:38,383 --> 00:02:05,167
Nothing has changed?

97
00:12:43,847 --> 00:02:10,437
I'm not even a memory,
or what?

98
00:12:47,935 --> 00:02:14,571
I'm just a blur, as always.

99
00:12:53,482 --> 00:02:10,431
I waited so long for
you should consult.

100
00:12:57,945 --> 00:02:14,584
This was a mistake.
I've done enough for you.

101
00:13:27,850 --> 00:02:12,460
Oh no!
We must turn back!

102
00:13:31,562 --> 00:03:07,762
It's too late, I can not!

103
00:13:41,154 --> 00:03:17,134
Help!

104
00:13:43,198 --> 00:03:08,832
- No!
- Hold on!

105
00:14:23,322 --> 00:03:07,707
Now what? What is this?

106
00:14:27,326 --> 00:03:11,872
You are just yourself.

107
00:14:30,537 --> 00:03:16,063
Hey, Tom.
It was a long time ago.

108
00:14:33,999 --> 00:04:10,353
- Do I know you?
- Of course.

109
00:14:37,461 --> 00:04:14,484
We've known each other
since childhood.

110
00:14:40,380 --> 00:04:17,568
- You are crazy.
- I was once.

111
00:14:44,593 --> 00:04:11,313
Come,
I'll patch it together.

112
00:14:50,474 --> 00:04:16,565
You wonder where you are.

113
00:14:53,352 --> 00:04:19,733
I'm in a dream.
With a mad woman.

114
00:14:57,648 --> 00:04:14,432
If I am,
it provides no good picture of you.

115
00:15:01,610 --> 00:04:16,600
In many different ways.

116
00:15:04,321 --> 00:04:10,332
Before I was your voice of reason.

117
00:15:08,283 --> 00:04:13,440
You really needed one.

118
00:15:11,453 --> 00:04:16,526
You were good at many things -

119
00:15:14,540 --> 00:04:10,284
- But not on
to cope with reality.

120
00:15:19,461 --> 00:04:14,520
This is not seized.

121
00:15:22,589 --> 00:04:16,560
It should.

122
00:15:25,926 --> 00:04:11,368
I'm just waiting for you.

123
00:15:29,304 --> 00:04:14,498
<i> Friend! Hello, how are you? </ I>

124
00:15:32,432 --> 00:04:18,647
- Hey! I am here.
- Quiet! He finds you.

125
00:15:42,609 --> 00:05:20,143
Let it be.
It just brings back memories.

126
00:15:46,572 --> 00:05:12,828
You are crazy. Let me be!

127
00:15:49,408 --> 00:05:17,019
Selfishness and plump.
The Tom I know.

128
00:15:55,622 --> 00:05:22,271
A snowman
is not the best guide.

129
00:15:59,334 --> 00:05:14,993
He is not the
he appears to be.

130
00:16:01,753 --> 00:05:18,039
Let him take the rest of you.

131
00:16:05,799 --> 00:05:21,214
<i> I can not see you, buddy! </ i>

132
00:16:08,302 --> 00:05:12,887
- I am ...
<i> - Shout as loud as you can! </ i>

133
00:16:13,682 --> 00:05:19,083
<i> Damn young!
You're hiding. </ I>

134
00:16:16,935 --> 00:05:22,274
Now he is not so nice anymore.

135
00:17:00,979 --> 00:06:15,458
Hey, you there!

136
00:17:02,940 --> 00:06:20,601
Beware, the tracks are unstable.
They could collapse at any time.

137
00:17:08,195 --> 00:06:24,841
- Why is this here?
- No idea.

138
00:17:11,698 --> 00:06:17,536
Some thought it was
a good idea to build here.

139
00:17:16,286 --> 00:06:20,631
Hey, wait!

140
00:17:17,913 --> 00:06:24,796
Do you know where the music comes from?
It sounds familiar.

141
00:17:22,084 --> 00:06:16,517
Have you heard it?
We've all heard it.

142
00:17:24,962 --> 00:06:21,650
It is played daily,
same tune. I get nauseous.

143
00:17:34,012 --> 00:06:17,543
Oh no!

144
00:17:37,349 --> 00:06:21,715
Damn!
Why do I care?

145
00:17:41,103 --> 00:07:18,021
This can not be repaired.

146
00:17:46,483 --> 00:07:24,268
What will you do, Gem?

147
00:17:50,445 --> 00:07:26,339
Gem?

148
00:17:54,449 --> 00:07:20,061
Let it be. It is lifeless.

149
00:17:57,286 --> 00:07:24,247
Right. Thank you. Let it rot.

150
00:18:08,422 --> 00:07:24,231
Be careful.

151
00:18:35,115 --> 00:07:20,038
A song about me?

152
00:18:45,959 --> 00:08:25,756
Worthless crap! A moment without
eye and saw all this.

153
00:18:53,133 --> 00:08:29,941
The scoundrel
provides too many worries.

154
00:18:56,470 --> 00:08:21,605
Damn!

155
00:18:58,347 --> 00:08:25,809
- Wow, I missed a spot.
- What are you doing?

156
00:19:04,895 --> 00:08:20,562
Nothing. I was looking just for you.

157
00:19:09,191 --> 00:08:24,731
And now I found you.

158
00:19:12,778 --> 00:08:27,899
Come here.
Let me take a look at you.

159
00:19:16,448 --> 00:08:20,596
What? This?

160
00:19:19,034 --> 00:08:24,671
I got a little criticism
in the storm.

161
00:19:22,663 --> 00:08:27,880
Do not worry about me.

162
00:19:26,500 --> 00:08:21,585
Hey! Skalvi have some fun?

163
00:19:30,128 --> 00:08:26,834
No! What is it with you?
First we crashed, and now this?

164
00:19:34,550 --> 00:08:20,520
- Stupid dream, I'm out.
- Hold on, buddy! Calm down.

165
00:19:39,471 --> 00:08:25,728
I have something for both of us.
Two circus tickets.

166
00:19:44,184 --> 00:08:28,944
It is just around the corner.
I'll show you.

167
00:19:47,855 --> 00:09:25,229
No, let me be.
This is too weird.

168
00:19:51,900 --> 00:09:28,292
You will not leave me!

169
00:20:02,452 --> 00:09:29,353
<i> - Come out! See what's here. </ I>
- Go away!

00:21:09,019 --> 00:00:09,465
What happened? What have you done?

174
00:21:11,313 --> 00:00:01,082
<i> Reveal me - </ i>

175
00:21:13,357 --> 00:00:06,277
<i> - wizard who never
has failed ... </ i>

176
00:21:21,782 --> 00:00:01,094

178
00:21:29,122 --> 00:00:09,445
Hey, Tom. So good that you got away.

179
00:21:34,253 --> 00:00:05,231
- What did you do with my arabesque?
- Before calling it your princess.

180
00:21:39,675 --> 00:00:00,078
Could she actually spin,
as you said?

181
00:21:44,429 --> 00:00:03,149
Or was it also
a foolish lie?

182
00:21:48,058 --> 00:00:07,299
Excuse me. A different story.

183
00:21:55,148 --> 00:01:05,766
A silver platter?

184
00:21:57,985 --> 00:01:10,965
Did you really think it
would arrange everything between you?

185
00:22:03,365 --> 00:01:04,703
You would not
arrange it in reality.

186
00:22:06,660 --> 00:01:06,749
I do not want it.
It is destroyed.

187
00:22:09,538 --> 00:01:08,915
What do you do? It's mine.

188
00:22:12,499 --> 00:01:11,980
I'll have the same thing.

189
00:22:18,630 --> 00:01:10,921
<i> Castles of glass,

Before you played so beautifully,
Tom.

203
00:25:04,922 --> 00:04:17,621
You had a song
for everything in your life.

204
00:25:09,635 --> 00:04:10,329
What a pity
that it must end.

205
00:25:12,304 --> 00:04:12,349
I understand.

206
00:25:14,306 --> 00:04:15,559
Do not call me Tom.
You do not know me even.

207
00:25:17,976 --> 00:04:18,632
It is you who
know people, Tom.

208
00:25:21,355 --> 00:04:12,375
It's your fault.
Because you fed him.

209
00:25:33,659 --> 00:04:13,441
Do not let him take all of you.

210
00:25:47,130 --> 00:04:15,526
Wait!

<i> Doors

212
00:26:12,030 --> 00:05:22,280
Dad ...

213
00:26:14,283 --> 00:05:13,868
I had nightmares.

214
00:26:20,080 --> 00:05:19,172
What do you do?

215
00:26:22,165 --> 00:05:12,894
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

216
00:26:28,422 --> 00:05:18,128
Go back to bed.

217
00:26:31,216 --> 00:05:21,210
- But Dad ...
- Is it about your mom again?

218
00:26:46,982 --> 00:05:14,933
The circus ...

219
00:26:50,068 --> 00:05:19,152
It is not until tomorrow.

220
00:26:53,530 --> 00:05:22,211
Go to bed.

221
00:27:02,706 --> 00:05:20,168
Dad ...

222
00:27:06,251 --> 00:06:16,432
What is it?

223
00:27:09,421 --> 00:06:19,628
Are you afraid?

224
00:27:12,049 --> 00:06:23,771
How can you be afraid?
Without having seen it.

225
00:27:20,682 --> 00:06:21,706
Look. Only clowns.

226
00:27:28,148 --> 00:06:18,521
Trapeze artists in costume.

227
00:27:34,404 --> 00:06:23,736
That's all.

228
00:27:36,782 --> 00:06:16,434
Do you understand, dear?

229
00:27:42,079 --> 00:06:21,668
Crawl back to bed now.

230
00:27:47,417 --> 00:06:16,495
Thomas ... Yes, Dad?

231
00:27:57,553 --> 00:06:15,458
Nothing.

232

Go to bed.

Hello ...

241
00:29:01,491 --> 00:07:20,107
But look at you, you.

242
00:29:06,079 --> 00:07:26,357
- You are beautiful.
- Ann. Of course.

243
00:29:12,002 --> 00:08:23,732
- How did you get in?
- With witchcraft.

244
00:29:15,881 --> 00:08:27,877
I can not reveal more
than a brick belonged.

245
00:29:20,886 --> 00:08:20,561
Nice to see you.

246
00:29:23,180 --> 00:08:24,772
How are:
"You ruined my life, bitch"?

247
00:29:27,643 --> 00:08:28,901
You ruined nothing.
You did what you wanted.

248
00:29:31,730 --> 00:08:21,555
Everyone took care of itself.

249
00:29:34,483 --> 00:08:23,682
That was unfair.

250
00:29:37,194 --> 00:08:28,856
- It was not so?
- How was it? Because ...

251
00:29:42,449 --> 00:08:23,684
The band, tours and money
and all the stupid shit-

252
00:29:47,120 --> 00:08:27,799
- Felt important for Dad
than me or my mom.

253
00:29:51,917 --> 00:08:23,722
At home, he was also always
immersed in his own thoughts.

254
00:30:00,217 --> 00:08:29,982
Enough is enough. You may have-

255
00:30:03,512 --> 00:08:22,667
- Unresolved stuff with Tom,
but it has not.

256
00:30:06,849 --> 00:08:25,791
Yep. It makes me.

257
00:30:10,477 --> 00:08:29,960
I have never been
part of his life.

258
00:30:15,190 --> 00:09:27,252
You were the most important in his life.

259
00:30:22,281 --> 00:09:32,481
It was better.

260
00:30:29,746 --> 00:09:31,479
Understand why
He also saved on the bad.

261
00:30:34,668 --> 00:09:24,122
He could not let go.

262
00:30:44,469 --> 00:09:23,077
So cute ...

263
00:30:47,139 --> 00:09:26,285
You were a happy child.

264
00:30:50,851 --> 00:09:31,416
There I was.
But no thanks to him.

265
00:30:56,607 --> 00:09:27,271
He just wanted to forget everything -

266
00:31:01,486 --> 00:09:30,419
- And continue on with you.

267
00:31:04,907 --> 00:09:24,140
But it's not successful.

268
00:31:10,120 --> 00:09:29,361
It was a long time ago, Ann.

269
00:31:14,708 --> 00:09:32,528
You could leave it alone.

270
00:31:17,377 --> 00:00:05,288
At a certain age you stop fear
death and begin to wait for it.

271
00:31:22,841 --> 00:00:09,484
After a while one longs,
although one can not say that.

272
00:31:27,221 --> 00:00:03,191
Do you know why? To
Lose your mind before you die -

273
00:31:31,600 --> 00:00:06,273
- Is worse than death itself.

274
00:31:35,020 --> 00:00:02,097
You want to go away
before brain just gets mash.

275
00:31:41,777 --> 00:00:06,272
You seem still quite sharp.

276
00:31:44,780 --> 00:00:09,415
I'm talking about your father.

277
00:31:49,409 --> 00:00:03,139
He is a gloomy place now.

278
00:31:53,872 --> 00:00:09,462
Does it bother you not when you do not know
how he remembers you?

279
00:31:58,210 --> 00:00:02,167
No. I think
it bothers you more.

280
00:32:01,547 --> 00:00:07,358
If he at all remember,
then it is damaged and repaired.

281
00:32:06,927 --> 00:00:00,072
He was not good at repairing.

282
00:32:09,721 --> 00:00:03,143
He did his best.

283
00:32:14,726 --> 00:00:07,402
I'm tired.

284
00:32:22,943 --> 00:01:10,924
Watch it, buddy. Otherwise, do
this a nightmare.

285
00:32:29,408 --> 00:01:03,666
No! You're hurting me.

286
00:32:31,451 --> 00:01:07,814
You know I do not.
I just want your best.

287
00:33:15,704 --> 00:01:08,836
That's the way it should be.

288
00:33:19,625 --> 00:02:06,209
- Dude, what are you doing there?
- Come here, it begins.

289
00:33:31,303 --> 00:02:07,243

No, that's wrong.
Do not change anything!

325
00:38:35,691 --> 00:07:20,037
You're ruining it!

326
00:38:50,956 --> 00:07:25,318
<i> Thomas ... </ i>

327
00:43:22,644 --> 00:01:09,896
Damn ...

328
00:43:41,538 --> 00:01:09,881
How many numbers
these tend to have?

329
00:43:46,001 --> 00:02:05,222
No idea.

330
00:43:48,378 --> 00:02:08,356
Do not try to violence,
it did not succeed.

331
00:43:51,590 --> 00:02:13,501
We must open
this stupid thing.

332
00:43:57,179 --> 00:02:05,139
Why, Ann?

333
00:43:59,681 --> 00:02:09,398
When Tom hide something is important.

334
00:44:04,269 --> 00:02:13,487
He has no money,
you wasted it all.

335
00:44:07,940 --> 00:02:07,252
Are you a little bitter?

336
00:44:11,860 --> 00:02:11,437
For that I must
pay care, yes.

337
00:44:17,658 --> 00:02:07,249
Well done.
You let him get home

338
00:44:21,411 --> 00:02:09,377
- With their memories.

339
00:44:24,706 --> 00:02:13,522
Not bad
for one who blows his father.

340
00:44:28,418 --> 00:02:06,263
What else could I do?

341
00:44:30,754 --> 00:02:09,356
Family friends
would have accused me.

342
00:44:34,883 --> 00:02:12,443
Nonsense.

343
00:44:37,135 --> 00:02:06,226
The family has not had
some friends for years.

344
00:44:41,390 --> 00:02:09,397
What is it?
Tom cares about people.

345
00:44:48,063 --> 00:03:09,773
That's what I say.
He cared.

346
00:45:08,417 --> 00:03:17,173
Another trick!

347
00:45:12,171 --> 00:03:11,913
He chose something
he would not forget.

348
00:45:15,757 --> 00:03:14,046
What a cliche!

349
00:45:22,055 --> 00:03:09,787
What's that?

350
00:45:40,199 --> 00:03:07,728
"... But I am
only an illusion ... "

351
00:45:50,000 --> 00:04:10,329
It's all about him.
As surprising!

352
00:46:15,567 --> 00:04:14,494
"Miracles come in small packages."

353
00:46:18,237 --> 00:04:19,697
"It takes little to make a child
the world's happiest creature ... "

354
00:47:32,561 --> 00:05:20,125
No, stop!

355
00:47:40,277 --> 00:05:19,100
- Go away, I hate you!
- Wait! Who are you?

356
00:48:17,564 --> 00:06:15,473
Wait!

357
00:49:04,069 --> 00:07:23,245
Are you happy now?

358
00:49:08,031 --> 00:07:19,079
Yes. For this
is my childhood environment.

359
00:49:12,619 --> 00:07:24,206
Loose-leaf, songs, words of wisdom.
Adventure around me.

360
00:49:19,168 --> 00:07:19,039
Do you see it?
His precious arabesque.

361
00:49:23,088 --> 00:07:23,249
His princess.
He said the dancer spun-

362
00:49:27,509 --> 00:07:27,383
- If I played well
the piano lesson.

363
00:49:31,013 --> 00:07:22,167
- Listen, Gem ...
- I grew up with wishful thinking-

364
00:49:36,226 --> 00:07:26,356
- And bizarre monologues.
Everything was just a show.

365
00:49:40,939 --> 00:07:20,061
He did the same with my mother.
Watched her.

366
00:49:44,860 --> 00:07:24,209
He gave promises that he broke.
And always she thought. Always!

367
00:49:49,114 --> 00:07:19,056
Dad was always a disappointment
because you always come first.

368
00:49:53,952 --> 00:07:22,182
So she died, because of you.

369
00:50:01,168 --> 00:08:20,581
Hope it was worth it.

370
00:50:06,924 --> 00:08:25,769
Damn!

371
00:50:11,220 --> 00:08:29,923
Good morning, General.

372
00:50:14,598 --> 00:08:24,703
I was so small-

373
00:50:18,644 --> 00:08:27,832
- In his magical music world.

374
00:50:21,688 --> 00:08:21,583
He wrote songs
to everyone around him.

375
00:50:25,526 --> 00:08:24,728
Perhaps also
this little shit.

376
00:50:28,570 --> 00:08:26,767
But never to my mom or me.

377
00:51:04,606 --> 00:09:23,159
One, two, three, four!

378
00:51:10,320 --> 00:09:31,420
Good morning, Herr General.
Lucky you found it.

379
00:51:14,950 --> 00:09:23,083
What is this?

380
00:51:17,202 --> 00:09:27,271
- Where am I?
- You are on the battlefield, sir.

381
00:51:21,206 --> 00:09:31,438
You have fought for years
in this room.

382
00:51:24,751 --> 00:09:24,158
I am ashamed because I
hurt you. In vain.

383
00:51:29,089 --> 00:09:29,330
- I do not understand.
- Do not save my feelings.

384
00:51:32,968 --> 00:09:24,143
I dealt a violent blow.
I can only ask for your forgiveness.

385
00:51:39,016 --> 00:09:28,287
- I stomped on you.
- I attack you.

386
00:51:43,312 --> 00:09:32,509
But my motive was noble.

387
00:51:46,565 --> 00:09:26,287
I tried courageously to prevent your departure
with the cursed snowman.

388
00:51:51,486 --> 00:09:29,419
The ugly bastard!

389
00:51:55,991 --> 00:09:23,158
It's about memories, sir.

390
00:51:58,994 --> 00:09:28,315
He takes them.
He takes you deeper into the darkness.

391
00:52:06,251 --> 00:09:32,503
But why?

392
00:52:08,712 --> 00:00:05,291
You were old.
But you win for now.

393
00:52:15,552 --> 00:00:09,400
The best memories hurt him.

394
00:52:18,514 --> 00:00:02,100
You have chased the best memory.

395
00:52:23,268 --> 00:00:08,342
- The girl?
- Yes, your daughter.

396
00:52:28,565 --> 00:00:04,182
A girl like that!
Such a memory! Brilliant!

397
00:52:33,820 --> 00:00:09,418
You probably remember her childhood with
using common toy -

398
00:52:38,575 --> 00:00:02,188
- That I or the beautiful lady-

399
00:52:42,454 --> 00:00:04,266
- Where the glass ball.

400
00:52:45,749 --> 00:00:09,479
You love us,
that your daughter too.

401
00:52:50,254 --> 00:00:02,101
- I remember her.
- Very well ...

402
00:52:53,465 --> 00:00:06,290
There is nothing to do.
<i> C'est la vie! </ i>

403
00:52:57,052 --> 00:00:09,484
Longer than here, we will not.

404
00:53:01,390 --> 00:00:03,144
- Do not ...
- Sir?

405
00:53:08,146 --> 00:00:09,465
I need your help.

406
00:53:10,649 --> 00:01:05,751
I will remember her.

407
00:53:15,112 --> 00:01:08,852
I will find her.

408
00:53:18,782 --> 00:01:11,965
Comrades!

409
00:53:27,374 --> 00:01:10,983
Forward, march!

410
00:53:41,597 --> 00:01:04,663
You still have precious memories.

411
00:53:44,558 --> 00:01:07,850
We know where you hid them.
Not so far away.

412
00:53:48,312 --> 00:01:10,987
- I do not have many left.
- Oh no ...

413
00:53:51,773 --> 00:01:04,690
I do not even know who I am.

414
00:53:54,693 --> 00:01:06,793
We are all wounded.

415
00:53:57,362 --> 00:01:11,957
- I apologize for that.
- I'm a soldier, injured by war.

416
00:54:02,701 --> 00:01:04,706
You'd have given us -

417
00:54:05,245 --> 00:01:06,813
- But you gave us your daughter-

418
00:54:07,873 --> 00:01:10,944
- And underlined the importance of
we are. Hooray!

419
00:54:34,775 --> 00:02:07,312
We must hurry, sir.

420
00:54:39,446 --> 00:02:14,572
Did Tom come before the
evening when your mother was perished, -

421
00:54:43,825 --> 00:02:07,270
- Could all have been different.
- He was with you, Ann.

422
00:54:47,579 --> 00:02:09,329
You have misunderstood.

423
00:54:49,873 --> 00:02:13,540
My life was a mess then.

424
00:54:54,253 --> 00:02:08,329
It was crazy, with the band ...
It was too much for me.

425
00:55:01,343 --> 00:02:06,267
I did not take enough pills,
for I woke up and Tom was there.

426
00:55:06,932 --> 00:02:09,350
It was not how I planned it.

427
00:55:10,352 --> 00:02:13,504
- I do not want to hear this.
- He was with me -

428
00:55:14,857 --> 00:03:09,789
- But did not look at me
after what I had done.

429
00:55:19,069 --> 00:03:14,045
Your little tricks
must have corrupted the band.

430
00:55:22,990 --> 00:03:07,765
No, no.
It was probably the band's end -

431
00:55:27,327 --> 00:03:10,911
- It is true, but ...

432
00:55:29,872 --> 00:03:12,960
What I did was-

433
00:55:32,541 --> 00:03:17,110
- How shall I say it ...
too personal for him.

434
00:55:39,756 --> 00:03:12,985
- You do not seem to.
- You know what?

435
00:55:43,927 --> 00:03:09,815
Do not you know,
that Tom's father committed suicide?

436
00:55:51,602 --> 00:03:15,000
Theodore Whitman
shot himself in the head-

437
00:55:54,897 --> 00:03:17,130
- While Tom watched.

438
00:56:00,444 --> 00:03:13,959
What I did was too heavy for him.

439
00:56:05,449 --> 00:03:08,786
The evening
accident happened to your mother.

440
00:56:11,330 --> 00:03:12,938
The band split.

441
00:56:14,291 --> 00:03:16,102
He did not care about it -

442
00:56:16,960 --> 00:04:11,368
- But did
that he would lose you too.

443
00:56:22,174 --> 00:04:18,686
- Why tell you this?
- Because you do not know your father.

444
00:56:27,971 --> 00:04:13,476
He worshiped his father,
even if he was bleak.

445
00:56:33,143 --> 00:04:18,653
Tom said that he
could really be bad.

446
00:56:37,689 --> 00:04:13,451
When Tom started to go
in the same direction, -

447
00:56:43,862 --> 00:04:17,586
- He pushed you away.

448
00:56:49,034 --> 00:04:12,416
I know. He pushed properly.

449
00:57:32,536 --> 00:05:16,015
We're here, sir.

450
00:57:54,516 --> 00:05:15,961
I remember!

451
00:58:04,693 --> 00:05:18,042
I hid them jo. They are here!

452
00:58:09,823 --> 00:05:13,895
May I say
It was a pleasure to serve you.

453
00:58:45,400 --> 00:06:18,562
"Miracles come in small packages.

454
00:58:48,028 --> 00:06:23,775
It takes so little to make a child
the world's happiest being.

455
00:58:53,325 --> 00:06:17,557
It was not so much to the circus.
Uncouth, limp and tired.

456
00:58:58,080 --> 00:06:20,646
Still excited about the show-

457
00:59:00,958 --> 00:06:23,794
- And she pressed laughing
my hand.

458
00:59:04,586 --> 00:06:17,563
I felt like a father
then she laughed. "

459
00:59:12,302 --> 00:06:24,816
Why could not he
tell it to me?

460
00:59:15,347 --> 00:06:18,556
He did it
the only way he could.

461
00:59:20,769 --> 00:06:22,758
I always hoped-

462
00:59:23,605 --> 00:07:19,036
- That it would be
something valuable in the safe, -

463
00:59:28,360 --> 00:07:22,150
- Not such a waste.

464
00:59:31,280 --> 00:07:24,194
Mild powers!

465
00:59:32,906 --> 00:07:18,011
These are not only spread
thoughts or feelings. See!

466
01:00:02,227 --> 00:07:25,293
Partially finished, but the rest ...

467
01:00:06,523 --> 00:07:19,002
Words ending or derails.

468
01:00:11,236 --> 00:07:23,231
Openings, empty rooms ...

469
01:00:28,212 --> 00:08:24,709
"She's a picture of his mother,
my broken, lost beloved ...

470
01:00:34,092 --> 00:08:28,938
So small,
but as wise and beautiful.

471
01:00:40,474 --> 00:08:23,681
I am proud of love.

472
01:00:44,144 --> 00:08:27,820
Now I push her away. "

473
01:00:47,064 --> 00:08:20,597
"She will not share my gloom.

474
01:00:50,734 --> 00:08:24,726
I hope
she understands a beautiful day. "

475
01:00:55,697 --> 00:08:28,862
Hid you all good things here?

476
01:01:02,204 --> 00:08:26,817
What then, this?
I got a little bank.

477
01:01:07,167 --> 00:08:29,980
You should see your little friend.

478
01:01:09,670 --> 00:08:23,664
- I know what you want.
- Congratulations. What did we learn?

479
01:01:14,550 --> 00:08:28,938
Your father got tired of you,
took his life. Song Bird tried.

480
01:01:19,471 --> 00:08:22,685
And your little girl hates you.
There is nothing left.

481
01:01:23,642 --> 00:08:26,794
- Not for you either.
- I have a thing.

482
01:01:28,230 --> 00:08:28,945
Magic.

483
01:01:30,691 --> 00:09:26,264
The light brings darkness. Delicious irony.

484
01:01:36,613 --> 00:09:31,438
Your world, your rules.

485
01:01:40,576 --> 00:09:24,205
Who could have dreamed it together?

486
01:01:47,624 --> 00:09:31,457
Here it comes.

487
01:01:50,377 --> 00:09:24,158
Like watching
their greatest fears come to life.

488
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:34,838
<i> A crow flew to me,
but stopped at a distance. </ i>

489
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:40,024
<i> being so proud. </ i>

490
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:33,855
<i> I saw its soul,
envied pride. </ i>

491
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:39,064
<i> But I did nothing
who heard it. </ i>

492
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:33,826
<i> Then came an owl,
so old and so wise. </ i>

493
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:37,945
<i> needed straight
in my youth. </ i>

494
01:03:00,697 --> 01:02:33,813
<i> I learned its manners,
envied sins. </ i>

495
01:03:05,577 --> 01:02:38,023
<i> But I did nothing
who heard it. </ i>

496
01:03:10,207 --> 01:02:33,790
<i> A dove came to me,
without fear. </ i>

497
01:03:15,879 --> 01:02:38,007
<i> It rested on my arm. </ i>

498
01:03:20,843 --> 01:02:43,233
<i> I touched the quiet,
envied love. </ i>

499
01:03:25,848 --> 01:02:37,958
<i> But I did nothing
who heard it. </ i>

500
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:36,391
<i> A swan so white,
it came to me. </ i>

501
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:41,611
<i> Sea mirror
its quiet beauty. </ i>

502
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:45,760
<i> Its neck I kissed,
I admired its grace. </ i>

503
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:41,583
<i> But I did nothing
who heard it. </ i>

504
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:45,739
Ann. Ann ...

505
01:03:58,422 --> 01:03:39,478
See ...

506
01:04:09,892 --> 01:03:40,581
It is your father.

507
01:04:14,271 --> 01:03:45,740
See, he did everything by hand.

508
01:04:18,025 --> 01:03:39,478
Where there are empty
uncompleted sections.

509
01:04:21,945 --> 01:03:42,669
He started writing things down, -

510
01:04:25,490 --> 01:03:36,329
- When he realized
he lost his mind.

511
01:04:31,330 --> 01:03:40,541
Where is the last page?

512
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:44,152
What was it?

513
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:45,216
All these pieces, the memories ...

514
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:48,296
This is his life.

515
01:04:59,107 --> 01:04:41,038
- Superbly.
- I'll see if the fuse went.

516
01:05:14,414 --> 01:04:46,196
Yes, the power went out.
The phone is obviously dead.

517
01:05:26,051 --> 01:04:45,170
I go there.

518
01:05:32,391 --> 01:04:43,127
Damn!
I can not call a taxi.

519
01:05:35,769 --> 01:04:46,238
- I have a car.
- Have you? Then we go.

520
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:45,687
Sorry, old man.

521
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:49,865
Your daughter does not take the phone.

522
01:06:01,170 --> 01:05:42,558
It must be because of the storm.

523
01:06:15,559 --> 01:05:46,697
No! I'm not finished yet!

524
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:47,167
It is immediately over.

525
01:07:03,899 --> 01:06:46,152
Are you running away?
You are on the tracks, you idiot!

526
01:07:08,237 --> 01:06:50,300
I know what's down there.
You do not like it!

527
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:48,753
I will not let you do that!

528
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:47,668
You do not just luck next time!

529
01:08:33,906 --> 01:07:52,884
E minor!

530
01:08:36,658 --> 01:07:46,629
I was right. She twirled!

531
01:09:55,863 --> 01:09:58,004
Hurry in, so I parked the car.

532
01:10:00,701 --> 01:09:51,729
I'll be right there.

533
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:00,044
I got you!
I am your future mate!

534
01:10:32,149 --> 01:09:53,819
You should not
take my life from me again!

535
01:10:36,695 --> 01:09:58,049
I do remains
into a living hell.

536
01:10:40,657 --> 01:09:52,837
You probably know why.
Your music and your dreams-

537
01:10:45,495 --> 01:09:55,878
- Is just
ruins and empty canvas now.

538
01:10:48,290 --> 01:09:59,052
You think only of me.
Tell us why!

539
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:55,380
- I can not help it!
- You always knew I was married.

540
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:58,486
You could have chosen her
by making me less.

541
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:01,630
- But you gave me strength each year.
- I had to!

542
01:11:02,221 --> 01:10:54,357
I would not forget you.

543
01:11:05,599 --> 01:10:58,506
I deleted
bad dreams and memories -

544
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:00,609
- You little shit!
- Dad, stop!

545
01:11:12,147 --> 01:10:55,332
- I'm going down with me!
- You knew that. Dad!

546
01:11:17,653 --> 01:10:57,439
Stop it!

547
01:11:29,248 --> 01:10:59,543
I have to let you go.

548
01:11:52,437 --> 01:11:01,615
Katie: Daddy? </ i>

549
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:01,006
Thanks for the ride.

550
01:13:49,847 --> 01:02:34,872
Sleep well, Princess.

551
01:14:29,511 --> 01:03:44,672
I am here.

552
01:14:35,350 --> 01:03:39,520
I'm sorry.

553
01:14:44,026 --> 01:03:37,414
Dad?

554
01:14:55,662 --> 01:03:39,478
Is this what you want?

555
01:15:08,717 --> 01:04:44,127
What?

556
01:15:28,946 --> 01:04:44,127
Princess ...

557
01:16:58,285 --> 01:05:43,559
<i> I did see that I hear
chords again. </ i>

558
