00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,855
Where? 

3
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,566
# Hei

4
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,378
# Why are you telling me
I cut my hair? 

5
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,536
I'm glad you came. 

6
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:54,280
# They say I should try and match
I do not mind 

7
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,623
# Live my life that I like  

8
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,555
# They say I'm a little rebellious 

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,686
# Try to classify, analyze 

10
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,891
# But I never lower the tone

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,961
# They say I quit,
but I say below 

12
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,368
# Do not tell me what to do 

13
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,741
# It's me who must choose who will 

14
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:25,375
# There were no rules
Because I have time 

15
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,577
# Do not tell me what to do 

16
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,953
Therefore I choose, do not you

17
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:37,758
# If I go insane
Nothing will stop this evening 

18
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,258
# Oh, no 

19
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,425
# Yes

20
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:45,895
# Hei

21
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,006
# Why do I need to be
someone I do not?

22
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:56,181
# They said it
I can get a real job

23
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,811
Line is not so. That's not what I write.

24
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,116
# Will not risk my personality
Aligning

25
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:08,957
# They want to be stereotyped
But it lost

26
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:15,426
# They said yes, I said no

27
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,594
# Do not tell me what to do

28
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:22,106
# It's me who must choose who will

29
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,507
# No more rules
Because I have time

30
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,274
FLUX - NIKKO ALEXANDER
with special guest

31
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,949
# Do not tell me what to do

32
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,315
Therefore I choose, do not you

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,551
# If I go insane
Nothing will stop this evening

34
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,921
# Oh, yes

35
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,129
I do not see what a big problem.

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,368
Joey used to destroy the Roman guitar
in this club in the eighties.

37
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,503
Yes? Difference
Joey Roman rock star.

38
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,978
And herringbone has a hit album.

39
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,641
There students
they buy their own equipment.

40
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,015
- Come on.
- No, this amp is broken, Nikko.

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,680
But you must admit
great performance.

42
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,087
It's all about him.
We talked about it at the meeting.

43
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,217
This proud, too late, breaking the team ...

44
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,296
- Wait, what meeting?
- We had a meeting with the band.

45
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,661
"Without me? It's my band!

46
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,234
No, this is your band. Yes? No.

47
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,666
We agreed that if damaged,

48
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,069
will kick you out of the band,
for the good of all.

49
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,602
C'mon! This has been our dream
from third grade!

50
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,234
The songs, my voice!

	
51
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,905
I do what is best for the band.

52
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,749
Okay. Do what you want.

53
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,785
I still have the best voice
and the prettiest girl in town.

54
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,453
- Come on, honey.
- Nikko.

55
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,719
Who do you think called the meeting?

56
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:55,166
If it makes you feel better,
will break too.

57
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:01,030
Double ouch rejection.
Bride and bands in a single blow.

58
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,535
"Nils?

59
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,567
Excuse me.

60
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:13,147
Anyway, I'm better as a solo artist!
you make me grow!

61
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,392
Wow. Well, it hurts.

62
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,894
What?

63
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,462
What do I betray my band

64
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,860
or my girlfriend have been getting worse?

65
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,192
Either.

66
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,268
Both. I'm Courtney Lane.

67
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,071
Can you speak briefly,
please?

68
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,074
I'm in the mood
to socialize, thanks.

69
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:41,545
Just five minutes. Please?
you have something better to do.

70
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,543
That's not what I meant.

71
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,208
I know you want to get to the point

72
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,582
I'm not going to say I believe in destiny,
but I believe,

73
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,087
But is not it amazing
you have missed your band

74
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,419
The same night I came to find
singer?

75
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,652
- Yes, it was amazing.
- I know this is a difficult time,

76
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,525
but you're the right person.
Well, you're so perfect

77
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,619
because you are not disciplined,

78
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,925
but I'll put you online.

79
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,434
Ms. Lane, do not be offended,
but I'm fed up with the bands.

80
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,163
There was a band! It's a group.

81
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,570
group. Best.
The best of the best. Spectacular!

82
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,576
All right, calm down.
What band?

83
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,168
I told you. Spectacular!

84
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,940
So the band called?

85
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,515
Did they lose a bet?

86
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,050
I do not expect you to accept
until you see us in action.

87
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,017
Tomorrow will be a show at the fair.

88
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,554
Unfortunately, you have to do
Our competitors, Ta-Da.

89
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,283
- How?
- Ta-Da.

90
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,655
Sounds, "ta-da."

91
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,353
I appreciate the offer,

92
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,952
but why move your hands like that?

93
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,794
This event is at 5 pm.
I make maps.

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,294
I want to see the battle
bands with strange names.

95
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,031
Nikko Alexander is now solo.

96
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,269
Nikko Alexander more than one soloist.
Nikko Alexander a star.

97
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,402
Alternatively,
with public support and adequate.

98
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,241
We attract the public, and you're impressed.

99
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:53,081
Hundreds of fans singing your name.
"Nikko! Nikko! Nikko!"

100
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,747
you're a fan of this band?

101
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,186
There was a band! It's a group.
C'mon, it'll be fun!

102
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,588
Is the show! Bumper cars
snow cones, cake.

103
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,387
- I know what is fair.
- And the show!

104
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,758
you will not forget ... How?
Does double rejection?

105
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,423
Double rejection.
And thanks for mentioning again.

106
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,399
Come and see us. Please. Say yes.

107
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,333
I would think.

108
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,669
You will not regret it!
I swear I've never seen anything like this.

109
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,582
Get ready to impress!

110
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:36,691
# This tiger eye
Ready to fight

111
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,994
# Rose to challenge rival

112
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,366
# And the last survivors
Trunk prey at night

113
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:52,070
# And everyone watching us
With the eyes of the tiger

114
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,218
# Go straight to the top

115
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,656
# Are the courage and the glory

116
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,858
# Traverse the distance, I'm not going to stop

117
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,730
# Only one girl and wishes to survive

118
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,004
- You okay? Here you go.
- Thanks.

119
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,968
Was it spectacular?

120
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,873
I know. The mighty have fallen, right?

121
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:29,038
# And the last survivors
Trunk prey at night

122
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:35,781
# And all the people who see with eyes

123
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,015
# The tiger

124
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,391
Just kidding!

125
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,935
# Eye tiger

126
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,536
# Eye tiger

127
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:08,885
Addons Ladies and gentlemen,
Praising Spectacular </ i> </ i>

128
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,588
Addons Yes </ i> </ i>

129
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:17,760
Addons Second National Championship
Jazz Federation Coral </ i> </ i>

130
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,157
Want to see the correct interpretation?
Look at this.

131
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,958
Addons - Events not over.
- Okay. </ I> </ i>

132
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,867
Thank you. Substitution late
a pas de bourrée, sync

133
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,462
and high-detuned,

134
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,406
but you can feel the talent.
Is it true?

135
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,709
Addons - obviously saw something.
- The champions of the Federation, </ i> </ i>

136
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,112
Addons Ta-Da. </ I> </ i>

137
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,852
# Too many broken hearts
has fallen into the river

138
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,996
# Too many lonely souls
has drifted

139
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,163
# You do gambling,
but then pays the price

140
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,298
# The things we do for love
The things we do for love

141
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:07,570
# How to walk in the rain and snow
When there is no place to go

142
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,548
# And you feel a part of you is dying

143
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:16,581
Royce used to be a soloist, but Tammi,
as a liar, put it to Ta-Da.

144
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,690
Do not go into detail on the subject.
I will introduce the band.

145
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,159
Nikko, they are spectacular.
Spectacular, it was Nikko.

146
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,354
Hello.

147
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,691
What do you think?

148
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,163
You know, my grandmother once told me:

149
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:31,168
"If you can not say something nice,
say nothing ", so ...

150
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,568
Maybe I'm too much with our fans,

151
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,506
but the county fair
requires the trial, Nikko.

152
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,668
Yes How to compete
hot dogs and cattle?

153
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,509
Let him go, Courtney. Clear
not happy with our interpretation.

154
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,779
Whatever they do,

155
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,944
whether the people
much better than you.

156
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,522
Ta-da we won Nationals

157
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,723
Royce left the stage because
sing to the judges.

158
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,799
We are well Ta-Da
the show rocks.

159
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,333
Yes

160
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,565
What's wrong with your hands?
And by the way, what's that choir?

161
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,203
This choir competition

162
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,606
with elements of dance
and theatrical dress.

163
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,145
This is an art that combines music,

164
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,237
interpretation and choreography.

165
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,045
Just know, I feel worse.

166
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,618
Nikko, I offer the opportunity
to represent our school.

167
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,020
- Are we going to go to the same school?
- Yes!

168
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,455
There's money involved.

169
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,586
The Nationals award $ 10,000.
We need a soloist men.

170
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,965
you can offer a room.

171
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:37,058
Let's see. "$ 2500 for public humiliation
and silly life?

172
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,729
- No
- Half! $ 5000!

173
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,104
Awesome. I'm still a rock star,
And what do you want me to sell?

174
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,076
No, thank you. I do not want money,
I do not want to join the group

175
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,477
I do not want to dress like that.
Okay?

176
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:55,382
Well. Who needs you, Nikko?
And of course, this jazz hands.

177
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,215
# The things we do for love

178
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,557
# The things we do for love
The things we do for love

179
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,464
# The things we do for love

180
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,899
Addons What was found,
ladies and gentlemen? Ta-Da! </ I> </ i>

181
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,601
Addons Are not they beautiful? Very nice. </ I> </ i>

182
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,043
I told you.
There was a man perfect soloist.

183
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,774
Mr. sound a myth.

184
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,941
Like the Loch Ness monster.

185
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,714
Loch Ness Monster real.

186
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,553
Give Addons for the champions! Ta-Da! </ I> </ i>

187
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,956
Addons There. </ I> </ i>

188
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,463
Addons Tammi and Royce, not funny? </ I> </ i>

189
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,332
Addons free land </ i> </ i>

190
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:48,032
Addons And the brave home! </ I> </ i>

191
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,908
I thought I was invited
slumber party.

192
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,275
There should be no popcorn
and calls to the hot guys?

193
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,248
The choir is more important
cute guys.

194
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,477
- Except if you know how to sing.
- Hi, girls.

195
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,487
No time to talk, Mom.
We are officially in trouble.

196
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,183
I have divided the proposal
in three categories:

197
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,853
Ear zero, two left feet
and less spectacular.

198
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,396
less spectacular
best.

199
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,523
I think we will
using the Caspian.

200
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:15,930
They will do well, but Courtney ...

	
201
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,402
Mom! Quite
if you just want to be a finalist.

202
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,939
I need a star. I need to Royce!

203
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,933
Only that you mentioned.

204
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,940
- Once again.
- Tammi, have it all.

205
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,676
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

206
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,384
- What are you doing?
- Courtney. Hello.

207
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,950
Royce! Do not talk.

208
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,623
Not enough
steal our solo

209
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,889
also
our clothes off?

210
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,192
Ta-Da does not rob anyone.

211
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,425
He made a career change

212
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,503
Based on the best places
to show their talent unmatched.

213
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,901
I almost won last year.

214
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,200
Yes, but it
not win trophies, Courtney.

215
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,365
And unless you and I,

216
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,410
Spectacular best members
graduated last year.

217
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,810
You can not blame
to bet on another horse.

218
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,745
Royce! you're talking about.

219
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,011
We need our clothes.
We won last semester.

220
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,953
- Car wash, sale of jams.
- Come on.

221
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,652
You think I won $ 3,000 in clothes

222
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,694
sell only $ 300 from a cookie?

223
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,356
Yes, my parents bought.

224
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,490
Wake up, Courtney. This is how
in the big leagues.

225
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:27,299
Lacs du donated them.
And now back to donate.

226
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,565
Hey! No, no! Hoods, no!

227
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,438
We bought our cookies!

228
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,704
Royce!

229
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,908
"Tammi? Really?

230
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,818
Forget the cute guys.

231
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,882
What they do spoil the liver
and take everything, even the roof of the car.

232
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,119
Ta-da!

233
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,124
Unfortunately, everything will be fine.

234
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:00,103
No, Mom! We lost to Royce.
And now we lost our clothes.

235
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,108
How does Tiger's Eye
tiger without pants?

236
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,838
you will find a better song
and a better singer than Royce

237
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,972
because you can do anything
to achieve your goals.

238
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,380
I believe in you. And Janet, too.

239
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,080
Of course, Janet believes in Big Foot.

240
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,480
In Nepal, they call it Yeti.

241
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,987
Hello.

242
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,521
Hello.

243
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,663
In the closet or in your room.

244
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,097
I'm not a servant.

245
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,939
There you go. It's in my room. Happy?

246
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,175
Today rebosas joy.

247
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,471
- What happened?
- No.

248
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,184
They kicked me out of the band.

249
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,417
Yes!

250
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,822
Thanks Stavros.
You move my sympathy.

251
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,833
Look, I know it hurts,
but believe me, that's better.

252
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,028
Now you can focus on your future.

253
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,867
Great! Can I get garbage
Work like you?

254
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:12,069
Hey, this crap to pay rent
and health insurance.

255
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,611
Do not criticize unless you start
to help at home.

256
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,805
I know you're my brother,

257
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,442
but at least you can get rid of garbage
sometimes.

258
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,381
Sorry, Stavros.

259
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,854
I know you give up many things for me.

260
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,020
But we talked about my future.

261
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,063
Do you know what the most likely
you become a musician?

262
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,291
"Even if you do not get kicked out
your own band?

263
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,594
I do not care.

264
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,728
It's much easier to give an audition
solo for Dickinson Rich.

265
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:43,535
Do you have a hearing with the Dickinson Rich?
Are the producers?

266
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,973
Well, yes.

267
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,473
Namely, practical.

268
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,539
How can it be hard?

269
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,242
It's true! He sat in his office

270
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:57,050
waited for high school students
is brought in front of her experience.

271
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,720
I'm sure there's nothing better
to do with their time. Let's eat.

272
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,597
Hello. I saw Rich Dickinson.

273
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,264
No one saw Mr. Dickinson without an appointment.

274
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,864
I have an appointment. In one.

275
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,412
- Are you sprinkled Brains?
- Yes, that's me!

276
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:33,156
Listen, Tackies!
I have good news for everybody.

277
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,919
Caspian, forward and left.

278
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,987
Yes, Captain!

279
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,230
Not that respects
decision you, Courtney,

280
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,359
but Caspian sure
The best option for the Tiger eyes?

281
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,960
Not going to do more song.

282
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,006
Suddenly, our clothes
no longer available.

283
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,975
Immediately began
looking for a replacement

284
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,705
the www.compradevestuario.com.

285
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:58,078
And how do we pay?
I can not wash the car, Courtney.

286
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,650
- I can not the cast wet.
- Okay.

287
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,813
I'm trying to solve
with our consultants. True, Mr. Romano?

288
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,049
What? Yes, it ...

289
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,989
- Yes, what ...
- I do not believe my eyes!

290
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:11,153
Some scoundrel has stolen the famous
Our jewelry to their advantage.

291
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,992
Look! There's a place!

292
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,264
Addons Hello, fans Ta-Da!
As you know, </ i> </ i>

293
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,861
Addons Du Lac Royce has joined with Ta-Da
And has brought us with an incredible voice </ i> </ i>

294
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,942
Addons For your daily dose of the best choirs
throughout the world, </ i> </ i>

295
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,206
Addons showcoraltada visit. Com. Ta-da! </ I> </ i>

296
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,576
Royce sun star
Spectacular rotating around.

297
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,085
Should not be pessimistic,

298
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,885
but maybe it's time
Spectacular to end.

299
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:44,053
You're right. Show choir
A good way to see you

300
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,132
without risking your neck
in a pyramid of cheerleaders dumb.

301
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,291
And disturbing include the requirements
of choice

302
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:54,031
without having to join the band
discussion groups or sports.

303
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,442
But also a way to shine
to be the center of attention.

304
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,778
It's about having
The best record or the website,

305
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,905
but who's better on stage.

306
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:08,077
We can beat Ta-Da. Win.
Who's with me?

307
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,056
Why are you standing? Essay.

308
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,261
Come. Come. Ready.
I collect portfolio.

309
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,535
Good speech.

310
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,263
But even so, we will disqualify
act naked.

311
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,599
We'll find a costume.

312
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:32,970
# Will not risk my personality
Aligning

313
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,046
Addons Well, son. Okay. Come here. </ I> </ i>

314
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,743
What do you think?

315
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,651
Dotted Brain "?

316
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:47,851
Now I call Nikko Alexander.
It's my new name.

317
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,556
Well. I remember
the glory days of stone,

318
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,598
when Iggy Pop, Joey Rome and the Clash
best.

319
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,133
- Bands true.
- Thank you, sir.

320
00:18:56,235 --> 00:19:00,035
Unfortunately, I need more
My nostalgia to sell you.

321
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,767
- You need a very good demo.
- A demo?

322
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,139
No, the demo is very good.
I may have a good ear,

323
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,940
but the
their checkbook.

324
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,844
Addons Is Mr. Dickinson?
Dotted brain here. </ I> </ i>

325
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,953
Wow, you have the attitude, girl.

326
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,790
- Got a band?
- I have. I had to separate.

327
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,881
They are not too good.

328
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,984
Well, do not worry.
I will give some benefits.

329
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,360
Let's see, the studio, musicians,
engineer, mixer.

330
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,729
I can connect less than five.

331
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,301
Five hundred?

332
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,735
Five thousand?

333
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,733
What if I bring his own band?

334
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,108
They are not good?
No, thank you. I gather the band.

335
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,272
Can you get the money?

336
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,182
Yes I think there's a way.

337
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,390
I made a matrix of all the songs
why the judges have chosen

338
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,018
the last four years.

339
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,862
Hall & Oates recurring theme
Wham and as a song from Top Gun.

340
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,432
I enjoyed these scenes of aerial combat.

341
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,732
I do not want to bother with this puzzle,

342
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,670
but what he will sing on these issues?

343
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,970
I told Janet, we'll rotate him

344
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,806
whose voice is more like a song.

345
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,539
Or they could let me sing to me.

346
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,447
Bids have now been passed, but thanks for coming.

347
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,581
I think you need.
But if the treatment is not until ...

348
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,715
If you pass,
can introduce yourself next year.

349
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,593
From the beginning.

350
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,897
Well. Step, tap.

351
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,022

00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:56,419
Step, tap, step, tap,
kick, shift and slide.

356

When slipping, extend their arms.
, Slide. Well.

357
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,395
# You girl
I heard a rumor

358
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,829
# You have all the children at your feet

359
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,198
# A sweet heartbreaker

360

# If you play
I want to be a player

# There is no problem with me

00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,913

364
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,248
# Do suffer

365
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:33,882
# Come on, put your best, no less
Once again, that's what I want

366
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,460
# Why do not you break my heart?

367
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,964
# I feel good

368
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:47,801
# Do it again and again
That's what I need

369
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,369
# Why do not you break my heart?

370
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,773
# Yes

371
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,715
# See intimídame fixed

372
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,084
# Please, darling, I've never broken

373
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:07,317
# Is it because I could tolerate

374
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,452
# It's great the way you play

375
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:14,157
# You can do whatever you want

376

383
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:49,026
# Why do not you break my heart? Yes!

384
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,373
# Tear

385
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,007
# Come on, take heart

00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,377
# Why do not you break my heart?

# I feel good

388
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:18,490
# Do it again and again
That's what I need, yes

389
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,229
# Why did not break me ...?
Why not break me ...?

390
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:27,328
# Why do not you break my heart?

391
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,235
Yes

392
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,751
Okay, okay.

393
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,657
- Logged.
- Very well done.

394
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,323
It's just a test.

395
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,596
"The deal still stands?
"Half of the money?

396
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,169
If we win.

397
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:05,503
And that means you will work.
All practice. Every day.

398
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:11,245
And not just singing, Nikko.
We also danced.

399
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,247
Are you going to come?

400
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,788
Stay back and follow us.

401
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,354
Five, six. Five, six,
seven, eight. Keep.

402
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,024
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

403
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,500
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

404
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:35,369
And one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

405
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,342
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Y. ..

406
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,513
Problems?

407
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,818
This routine easier.
Five, six, seven, eight,

408
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:58,021
step, kick, pas de bourre,
pace of change, pull soutenu.

409
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,992
Nikko.

410
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,430
Nikko!

411
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,571
This is very difficult!
Why can not we just dance?

412
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,664
Do not know. Why can not you?

413
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:14,040
Maybe I'm not a robot dancer!

414
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,171
In the eighties rockers put
snake in pants

415
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,682
learn to wiggle their hips.

416
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,749
No matter. It's another era.

417
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,990
Since the beginning, please.

418
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,233
Let's start with something indie,
and more commercial

419
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,742
more public stadium.

420
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,814
Sorry, can we talk for a minute?

421
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,579
Advertiser.

422
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,709
I am humbled in the practices

423
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,082
And now you ruin my reputation?

424
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,179
Are you lazy reputation
undermining the authority

425
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,259
- And do not listen to people?
- Yes, that.

426
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,884
You can do whatever you want
with dance steps.

427
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,429
Choral events based on precision.
In the form of ...

428
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,499
Just trying to give
a touch of spontaneity.

429
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,761
Spontaneity that practice served if

430
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,860
and interpreted the same way.

431
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,269
Did you receive improvisation
if approved in advance?

432
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:19,139
Yes, Ferndale Show Choir Competition
very important to us ...

433
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,506
What?

434
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:24,173
Show Choir Contest Ferndale.
Do not you read the leaflet?

435
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,909
It was pink. He hoped to be alone.

436
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,484
Is this your first appearance in public,

437
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,578
and I need to do
What crazy.

438
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,453
Last year, Royce has overreached
and we lost Nationals.

439
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,119
Wait a minute. I'm Royce.
I'm not going to lose Nationals.

440
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,718
And I'm higher.

441
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,758
- Courtney! Nikko!
- Great. More than you.

442
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,596
Good news! Tajid solved
wardrobe malfunction.

443
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:48,764
My family has proudly joined the ranks
franchise restaurants.

444
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,704
And as the proud owner
from the thief's Depot,

445
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,902
Has agreed to complete the costume!

446
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,842
- Is not it great?
- You can enter a name.

447
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,642
Wait!
Costumes will wave, right?

448
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,376
- Totally.
- Yeah Come on.

449
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,781
They'll wave.

450
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,885
Are you coming or you will do your part of the bus?

451
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,520
Is the choice?

452
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,456
- No
- This is sad.

453
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,555
No, synthetic.

454
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,170
You're kidding.

455
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,262
"This is an event? No

456
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,269
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

457
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:28,637
I think you want to go back to the place
the gym with your band.

458
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,944
- Do not forget a hat!
- Lupi!

459
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,950
- Come on, guys.
- Come on.

460
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,217
Great!

461
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,850
Great! Perfect.

462
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,028
Thief's Depot.

463
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:50,500
Can I order a chicken wing
with a ration of potatoes?

464
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,832
They look great.

465
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,166
"Nikko?

466
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,911
- Hello.
- Nils. Eric. Amy.

467
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,180
What are you doing?
Why are you wearing?

468
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,444
Because I like it.

469
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,851
I've always wondered
who had stolen my Little Ponies.

470
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,250
do.

471
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,623
- You are very funny.
- Yes

472
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,992
Nikko band fool you let go.

473
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:22,328
This will rock the crowd
with an incredible voice.

474
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,959
Please help me quit.

475
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,362
Okay, okay. Let's go.

476
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,276
- Good luck, Nikko.
- Bye, Nikko.

477
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,875
They look fantastic.

478
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,882
- Do not even know what they are ...
- Caspian.

479
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,713
Did you see that?

480
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,886
I need a very good demo.
I need a very good demo.

481
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,984
I need a very good demo.
I need a very good demo.

482
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,862
# I heard that song

483
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,629
# And still we can imagine two

484
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,572
# Do not know what's wrong

485
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,009
# Maybe love is not always enough

486
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:13,908
# Just know I miss you
Are we better?

487
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:20,950
# Listen to the radio
And I see your face

488
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:24,452
# What a love song lonely?

489
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,360
"Something sad, but true

490
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:33,867
# The words and melody
still remind you

491
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,874
Great. Again.

492
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,668
Not only him, that's it.

493
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,842
Tammi Dyson can sweet and innocent
such as candy,

494
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,439
Ta-Da but led by hatred in his heart.

495
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,416
His name is spelled with two "M",

496
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,080
by the evil in your veins.

497
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,885
# Love

498
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,593
# Try to convince

499
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,630
# But I heard that song

500
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,593
# And do not feel good

501
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:11,204
# If you can start again
Never released

502
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,073
- I think her voice is terrible.
- Royce Is?

503
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:19,945
Royce's best solo Du Lac
in the history of rock shows.

504
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,050
"Something sad, but true

505
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:30,651
# The words and melody
still remind you

506
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:35,756
"He came out with a brave leader?

507
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,767
Why? Are you jealous?

508
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,233
How seed from cardboard? I think not.

509
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:46,374
# I remember where you are going tonight

510
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:52,346
# Try to resume my life
I do not know how

511
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,548
I forgot they were so good.

512
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:58,918
# Try to be strong
But it was not useful

513
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,390
# There's always something that reminds me of you

514
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:05,758
# A picture that took me back to the past

515
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:11,325
# And the memories flooded my
I still

516
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:15,433
# If we have a second chance

517
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,566
# What is the song of love?

518
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,440
# It's a long goodbye

519
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,080
# Voice on the radio

520
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:29,745
# I remember where you are going tonight

521
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,551
We have to beat them.

522
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,534
Why are they so normal?

523
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,631
Not supposed to be in the auditorium
dance with the music?

524
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:29,372
This test vowel. And Queen
have a meeting with their advisers.

525
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,243
Well, all standing.

526
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,976
Why do not we start without it?

527
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,611
- It's Courtney, not Darth Vader.
- Is there a difference?

528
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:41,282
Come on, everyone stood up.
Singing. To have fun.

529
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:52,026
# Yes, yes, all now

530
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,661
# Yes, yes

531
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:01,043
# Adjust or escape
This was a difficult decision

532
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:05,705
# Do what you like
Every person doing something

533
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,011
# At this moment, in this place

534
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,954
# Inhibition
Do not press this time

535
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:18,626
Because we do not need an invitation

536
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,723
# To break the rules

537
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,597
# I say yes
Do what you do

538
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,400
# Say what you mean

539
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,975
# Do it the way you

540
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,705
# I say yes
Do what you do

541
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,577
So, take a chance that you want

542
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,915
# Do it the way you

543
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,680
Who's going to bring anything? Nobody?

544
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,918
Come on, do not leave me alone.

545
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,034
Tajid, to imitate the sound? Well. Who else?

546
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,775
Come on, everybody. C'mon!

547
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,642
- Nikko, Courtney would not like it.
- Why not?

548
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,814
He always said ...

549
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:13,110
# Playing it safe

550
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,412
# Tell me why you have to do

551
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,011
# This is so boring and Common

552
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,987
# Come on, try something

553
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,286
# Free yourself once

554
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,293
# Why are the others?

555
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,956
# If you can be original

556
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,901
Because we do not need an invitation

557
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,337
# Let us break the rules

558
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,870
# I say yes
Do what you do

559
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,674
# Say what you mean

560
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,272
# Do it the way you

561
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,751
# I say yes
Do what you do

562
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,988
So, take a chance that you want

563
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,891
# Do it the way you

564
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,662
What are you doing?

565
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,066
Sorry, Mr. Romano.
We're kidding.

566
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,658
No, no, that sounds great.

567
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,900
I know. Are you listening to imitate the sound Tajid?

568
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,141
And Janet! Did not know you have a record.

569
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,575
Me too!

570
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,271
They should use this.

571
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,439
In the show? Lnsondable!

572
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,382
- We can not sing very well in the competition.
- Why not?

573
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:26,082
Leaving the limits can be good.
So I heard.

574
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,388
Courtney likes to remain
on the boundary.

575
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,053
Neat,
without even approaching them.

576
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:34,893
- Courtney is only interested in winning, right?
- Yes

577
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,159
Worth a try.

578
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,792
We will show a small sample
our creation.

579
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,929
Where are we going to do? And when?

580
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,402
As what?

581
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,535
When we start with the trial?
We're waiting.

582
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,205
They can start without me, Nikko.

583
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,078
you would think more than anyone else
want to take this seriously, right?

584
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,448
Tomártelo Why do you want? I do not understand.

585
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,817
From the beginning, please! Y. ..

586
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,154
Stop singing. Well.

587
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,370
Should not do homework
or what?

588
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,379
I'm doing something.
I was watching a video.

589
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,309
This is very funny.

590
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,281
Come on, Nikko. you have to put effort
and learn the value of work.

591
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,685
Life is ...

592
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,883
Hold that thought. OR REJECT.
What do you want.

593
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,001
Not Thai restaurant.

594
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,631
We really enjoy this day
and thinking about coming for more.

595
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,268
Caspian And he was an inspiration
for testing.

596
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,045
- How do you know where I live?
- What?

597
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,412
- Hello. We are your ...
- Study group!

598
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,251
- Really?
- Yes, I'm trying.

599
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,783
Great! I'll leave you alone.

600
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,984
No, no. Study on the terrace.

601
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,921
I will open.

602
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,270
Study Group.

603
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,269
Hey, look at the steps.
-Heart.

604
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,808
- Hello.
- Hello.

605
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,934
Hello.

606
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,342
I'll leave the door open.

607
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:36,887
If you can tell how to come,
will be extraordinary.

608
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:47,227
Well apparently they all.

609
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:53,329
We'll learn a little bit outside.

610
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,133
I thought I had a full deck.
Well, boys, let's do it.

611
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,982
- Janet? Would you join?
- Do not know.

612
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,884
Courtney's best friend.
Do not do it behind her.

613
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,252
We are not doing their backs.

614
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:17,088
Why not consider
surprise party?

615
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,757
Okay.

616
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,291
Oh God.

617
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,761
Open up a bit.
This is not a rigid practice of choral performance.

618
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,710
Well, the first rule
Nikko terrace ...

619
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,474
There are no rules.

620
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,776
Except one: There will be jazz hands.

621
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,553
Well. Hey Taj, whether you choose it?

622
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,146
Yes, I chose the song.

623
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,692
Well, let's see what we have.

624
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,794
Okay.

625
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,927
I think they are a bit more than that.

626
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,258
Well, try this.

627
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,368
Come.

628
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,671
Well, Cas. Look at him.

629
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,373
They understand it.

630
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,248
Hop.

631
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,220
Jazz hands, please. Thank you.

632
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,124
It goes forward to the music!

633
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,890
OK, kids!

634
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,832
Excuse me. What are you doing?

635
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,470
Thank you.

636
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,509
No, no.

637
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:58,819
Do not say, but I want to learn
part of the Tiger Eye.

638
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,298
Male.

639
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,676
C'mon, very important to us.

640
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,375
I think we have to work
a little harder.

641
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:23,545
And the Caspian, do not have to raise the tone
in each record, right?

642
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,784
You can download a little.

643
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,793
Rest.

644
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,195
What happened, Casp?

645
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,201
View.

646
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:51,041
I know my voice a little theatrical.

647
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,308
I can not help it.

648
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:58,019
I'm not a stereotype theater group,

649
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:02,525
only I can play the triangle,
so the band was not for me ...

650
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,128
And I think

651
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,626
maybe for once, the Spectacular,

652
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,301
all eyes will be on me.

653
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,534
I knew it was stupid.

654
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,308
Friends, I want to be a rock star.

655
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,674
Do not think it's stupid.

656
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,238
People just as we need
public attention.

657
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,847
Okay.

658
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,154
- Sing.
- Come on.

659
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,353
What?

660
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,847
Do not ask me what happened.

661
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,018
We talked about growing up and responsible,

662
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,790
How do you you join another band?

663
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:18,192
- What? No, not really.
- I hope that other bands.

664
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,429
What is this? "Disco music cowboy?

665
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,166
Yes, Stavros, disco cowboys.
You wave.

666
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,801
- I do not care what the waves ...
- I joined another band. Believe.

667
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:27,935
I ...

668
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,111
I have a job.

669
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,913
Are you working on the thief's Depot?

670
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:39,080
Yes, I work there.

671
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:44,288
I'm thinking what you're saying
about not taking my responsibility.

672
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,556
I know now just waiting for a table,

673
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,600
but I want to start paying you for everything ...

674
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:55,070
Nikko, Nikko, I am very proud of you.

675
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,269
I'm very proud of you.

676
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,197
That's fine. Well.

677
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,761
Listen to all.

678
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,602
We will meet here tomorrow
at 9 tonight.

679
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,005
Tomorrow night?

680
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,944
But do Cosmic Bowling
spectacular traditions.

681
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,072
So what? We start a new one.

682
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,947
Come. She was my friend.
I know you'll like it.

683
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,714
Janet was right. Courtney will love.

684
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,551
They are ready.

685
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,318
you're full of surprises, Ms. Lane.

686
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,557
Did not know you like so many bowling.

687
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,464
Well, not really bowling, ...

688
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,136
No matter.

689
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:03,069
No, tell me. What's that?

690
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,003
Promise you will not laugh at me.

691
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:10,308
I'm not going to laugh. But I know
Where this tradition.

692
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:16,584
I know it makes sense,
but I did the same thing since the first year.

693
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,553
I need something more than that.

694
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,150
Okay.

695
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,584
Before the concert,
I became very nervous,

696
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:29,860
so my dad brought me here
for me to calm down a bit.

697
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,758
I would love it.

698
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,771
My brother encouraged me stage fright
to stop him from singing.

699
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:40,468
you should try something else
for not working.

700
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,968
I know.

701
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,115
When I took leadership Spectacular,
carry on this tradition.

702
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:50,414
And a week before the big show,
we all come together here.

703
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,920
A little silly, is not it?

704
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,388
Not a bit.

705
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,822
- Hello.
- Hello.

706
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,994
Where is everybody?

707
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,065
Placement test has Tajid,
and Emily French.

708
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,192
Robin can not bowl
with plaster.

709
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,269
Zack something familiar.

710
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,704
So we all ignored
only spectacular traditions.

711
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,875
Hey! We're here.

712
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,641
- Keep the tradition alive.
- Let's play bowling!

713
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,980
Thank you.

714
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,750
Thank you.

715
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:28,013
- I have a split.
- What do I ask?

716
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,592
Do I share a bet? No, I say full.

717
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,024
- Royce!
- House.

718
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:34,291
What are you doing here? You know that
spectacular traditions!

719
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,958
- Come on, Courtney.
- But I like bowling.

720
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,262
Yes, you know what channel.

721
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,269
Please you can not even knock
bolus.

722
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,965
You know what? Leave them to it.

723
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,538
I have a better idea.

724
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,303
Typical. you can not handle ...

725
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,280
Talk to the hand of jazz.

726
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:01,715
Let's start a new tradition
with my favorite game: Rock the World!

727
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,520
What do you think?

728
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,921
What do I think?

729
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,732
Let's do it separately!

730
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,164
Okay.

731
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,164
The first victim!

732
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,536
Random!

733
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,449
you have to sing what he looks!

734
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,149
Courtney, you have to do it.

735
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,222
I'll change it.

736
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,654
Do not be silly. Okay. I sing.

737
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:37,818
This duo of Courtney and Royce.

738
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,589
# Sometimes it is hard to see

739
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,397
# What's always been there

740
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,506
# Sometimes we are sure all

741
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:58,945
# Until we find our mistakes

742
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,612
# Now we are here

743
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,245
# Head Head

744
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:10,258
# There is no similar

745
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:16,660
# For the first time, I realized

746
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:22,103
# Of something not seen before

747
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,834
# For the first time

748
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,843
# When I see your eyes

749
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:32,678
# I see more

750
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:40,850
"Something that we feel in our
first

751
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:47,625
# How do we end it?

752
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:54,136
# Do not know, but it feels good

753
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:59,141
# The last thing I expected

754
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:04,647
# It happened, you and me

755
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,444
# It's real

756
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,213
# I can not explain

757
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,087
# There is no similar

758
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:20,892

00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,965

# I see more

763
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:45,184
"Something that we feel in our
first

764
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:52,085
# There are no words to express
I feel for you

765
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,926
# Only want to be with you

766
00:48:56,033 --> 00:49:00,060
# - I never imagined
- Yes

767
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:05,039
# Someone can make me feel so

768
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,512

# For the first time

773
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,851
Come. I've got something to show you.

774
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,584
Okay.

775
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,829
- Be careful.
- Okay.

776
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,701
Where are you taking me?
I'm not good with surprises.

777
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,740
Would you believe me?
And keep your eyes closed.

778
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,037
- I've got them.
- Okay.

779
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,045
Listen, Courtney,
I know we started with the left foot

780
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,116
I speak not only
my dance moves.

781
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:26,247
both are very excited
and we care about the same thing.

782
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:32,521
So we gather this presentation to you.

783
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,223
What? Who?

784
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:39,769
# Yes, yes, all now

785
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,030
# Yes, yes

786
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,332
What is this?

787
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:48,934
# - Adjust or escape
- It's a difficult decision

788
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,378
# Do what you like

789
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,540
# All of them do something

790
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,845
# At this moment, in this place

791
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,079
# Inhibition

792
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,521
# - Do not press this time
- No, no, no

793
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:06,392
Because we do not need an invitation

794
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:10,660
# To break the rules

795
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,825
# I say yes

796
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,460
# Do what you do

797
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,199
# Say what you mean

798
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,798
# Do it the way you

799
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,968
# I say yes

800
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,546
# Do what you do
	

801
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,275
So, take a chance that you want

802
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:29,181
# Do it the way you

803
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,984
# Now it's time to fix

804
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,079
# Soluciónalo

805
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,215
# Show the world

806
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:36,349
# Show the world

807
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,121
# From what you made

808
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,855
# - Let it go
- Remove

809
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:43,194
Because you know you are ready

810
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,828
# The choice is yours

811
00:51:56,513 --> 00:52:01,212
# No need invitation

812
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,550
# To break the rules

813
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:06,747
# I say yes

814
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:12,090
# Do what you do
Say what you mean

815
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,663
# Do it the way you

816
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:15,856
# I say yes

817
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:21,165
# Do what you do
Taking the opportunity that you want

818
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,069
# Do it the way you

819
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,141
# Yes

820
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,540
# - Do what you do
- What do you want to do

821
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,374
# - Say what you mean
- What do you want to say

822
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,971
# - Make your property
- Your way

823
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,141
# I say yes

824
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,719
# - Do what you do
- What do you want to do

825
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,651
So, take a chance that you want

826
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:43,624
# Do it the way you

827
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,190
- What do you think?
- What?

828
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:55,567
Do I keep the knife in the back
or give me the knife?

829
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,373
Why, Nikko? Money Why?

830
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,670
What do you mean by money?

831
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,612
Is their new leader did not tell them
who just joined us

832
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,209
because I promised
half of the prize money?

833
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,288
Is that true?

834
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:16,052
Courtney, not just your money.
It is spectacular.

835
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,754
I know. Anyway,
bad decision.

836
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,093
The deal behind us.

837
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,826
Congratulations, Nikko.

838
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:30,737
I never thought I could feel much worse
Royce than when he left, but it can handle.

839
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,768
you stole dreams.

840
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:47,787
We ... We believe you.
And you betrayed us.

841
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,326
Both surprise party, Nikko.

842
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,496
- Hello, Courtney.
- Royce?

843
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,399
What are you doing here?
Should not you be in bowling?

844
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:40,670
Yes, but not the same.
That's our trail. That's our song.

845
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,969
It's a little late for nostalgia.

846
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,107
Really?

847
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,810
I do not know what it was, Courtney,

848
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:53,685
but when we sang together,
was magical.

849
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:59,361
We have chemistry. Still have it.

850
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,959
Remember you have a girlfriend?
Her name is Tammi, with two "M".

851
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:06,297
We make beautiful music together!

852
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,871
Come. You're not serious.

853
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,099
Nikko, I can improve.

854
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:15,200
- I'm not afraid, rocking.
- Get lost, troll.

855
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,304
If you get me
I'll sing like a soprano.

856
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:22,613
Too much gossip for those who
her "kids show".

857
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,853
Can you? Can they stop?

858
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,686
No matter. It would be very easy to beat you.

859
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:35,095
Embarrass you in public. In the Nationals.
Want to see a show?

860
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,758
Ta-Da you showed,

861
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:41,325
will show what the output
and show you how.

862
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:49,473
The most stupid
I've heard in my life.

863
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,617
If you come to restore your settings and songs,

864
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,252
You can give them to Mr. Romano.

865
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:10,828
Look, I know what you think about it on the porch.

866
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,596
Like if you want to steal Spectacular?

867
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,796
But this is not possible.

868
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:22,471
Because you're Spectacular.
your heart and soul. Without you,

869
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:27,573
Spectacular group of deaf
no rhythm and two left feet.

870
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,514
I guess I wanted to show
what else Tackies know.

871
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:37,025
From now on, we do it right.
you.

872
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:43,360
The way I was not as good as you think.

873
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,731
What do you mean?

874
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,573
- Strengthening Show Choir?
- Page 2.

875

881
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,278
- Courtney, it was just a bad review.
- They were right.

882
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:43,223
I was so afraid of change
I was bland classic.

883
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:46,225
And to see you tonight ...

884
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:53,393
Do not know Tackies
can do that. He's very good.

885
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:58,604
But unfortunately, many
the choreography will be disqualified ...

886
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,806
Ms. Lane! Sorry, we passed the time ...

887
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:06,405
Okay. I'm glad
you do not Royce. Listen.

888
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,179
Courtney, you live, eat and breathe
by the show choir.

889
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,447
If anyone knows how to modify the rules

890
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,614
without breaking, you.

891
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:21,455
And you, follow your instincts.
Push until he said yes.

892
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:28,128
This could work.
I believe Tackies Except ...

893
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,798
A dictator is not flexible and narrow?

894
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,030
Okay. I am ...

895
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,770
A greedy selfish and dangerous?

896
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,415
You can not say we do not know.

897
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,491
Addons Mr. Dickinson, you ...</ i> </ i>

898

I do not want to call

00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:57,155
Addons Mr. Gage. </ I> </ i>

900
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,931
Tony! What?

901
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,134
Yes No, no, no. Clear.

902
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:10,644
Yes, yes. I found ...
I found a new talent.

903
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,544
Yes No, no. Hey, wait, wait.

904
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:15,948
I have one. Yes, I have someone here.

905
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,451
Of course you can hear it!

906
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,620
Look who's here!
We are dangerous and cunning.

907
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:29,858
- Hide lunch money.
- Sorry.

908
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,330
I took the unilateral decision
and I was wrong.

909
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,028
Nikko helped me to see is not always ...

910
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:38,767
Nikko was a charlatan and scoundrel.
This Spectacular destruction.

911
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,742
He's only interested in himself, Courtney.

912
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,041
Thank you! Thank you very much.

913
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,480
- Oh no!
- Wow.

914
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:56,222
- What do you think about my new look?
- It's nice.

915
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,692
Maybe you can use
to make new costumes.

916
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,387
Or to conquer the potatoes.

917
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:11,963
Although we now have the fashion sense,
do not forgive you.

918
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,839
- Yes
- Okay.

919
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:20,705
Well. Listen. When I accepted the offer,
do not want to get money

920
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:24,344
for pizza and video games.
The need for a demo.

921
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,150
And the only reason Courtney
I made the offer

922
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:31,317
because he loves the wild Spectacular

923
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,919
and want to win.

924
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,090
We can ask. Namely,

925
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,259
we will be happy to help with the demo.

926
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,270
Now I know it's true.
But I do not care.

927
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:44,465
I'll see how I managed.

928
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,641
After winning the Nationals.

929
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:51,703
Yes! Together. Okay?
No more dictatorship.

930
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,748
The tiger can not change their stripes.

931
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,445
But we will use our skills,
your voice and your registration, Janet.

932
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:00,283
And Mr. Romano, his ...
Must be good at something, right?

933
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,915
I'm glad you mention it
because I have ...

934
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:06,291
The words you are right,
but I refer to the test.

935
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,626
Come on, guys! C'mon!

936
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,723
Tajid right. Courtney will not change.

937
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,029
Hey! I can have fun!

938
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,532
Okay? Yes

939
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,673
Down. Down.

940
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,242
Shopping. Shopping.

941
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,210
Ah, yes. Yes, yes.

942
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,705
We will work with him.

943
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,009
- Yes
- Wow.

944
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:30,449
If you start a new era
of Spectacular

945
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:34,990
new costumes
and with a new and spastic Courtney

946
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,082
I think we need one more thing.

947
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,218
He was right.
We need a new song.

948
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,488
Yes, but it must be good.

949
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,086
Something that is not bland.

950
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:45,861
From the eighties. That was the last time
almost all the judges buy CDs.

951
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:49,597
- When doves cry.
- In the eighties, I have a song ...

952
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,038
I have ...
I have a song. Got a song!

953
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:59,006
That was the eighties.
This is called Something to believe.

954
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,582
I love that song!

955
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:04,847
Addons find in my heart
And I understand from the beginning </ i> </ i>

956
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:07,787
- That's it! That song. The!
- It's herringbone, right?

957
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,450
Is the most famous
last presentation of the group.

958
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,825
Yes, subject to final presentation.
They did not get to record it.

959
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,728
If the band has the right,
How can we get permission?

960
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,063
I can get it.

961
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,500
- How?
- I know the band.

962
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,037
I grew up with few members.

963
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:28,475
It's wonderful. Well done!
We have our songs.

964
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,911
And six days to practice performance.

965
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,376
What's the plan, boss?

966
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:41,690
We a. .. fun!

967
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:22,950
Stavros! I'm home.
I brought a sandwich ...

968
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,887
Both held on the saddle, cowboy.
you will have your life's journey.

969
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:30,227
Mr. Dickinson! What are you doing?

970
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:34,030
Mr. Dickinson and I'm talking
the extraordinary talent.

971
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,696
Your voice, appearance and attitude

972
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,297
a member
the music industry.

973
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,171
Thank you, sir, but what about the demo?

974
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:44,337
Company owners want to hear
certain hearings in private.

975
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,312
You're lucky, son. Take it.

976
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:50,215
I connected with old band.
They were very happy, of course.

977
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,876
But he said he did not use it.

978
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:55,515
Nikko, use it to audition,
then you can get rid of them.

979
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:58,651
How do we know that real?

980
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:05,158
This real numbers do you think?
That's if you like Mr. Gage.

981
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:08,897
You should be here, ready to Roque,
on Saturday night.

982
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:12,830
Thank you. Wait!
This Saturday night?

983
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:15,433
This day will be in town. Why?

984
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,570
Well ... Work that night.

985
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,148
someone to cover shifts.

986
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:25,084
All the work on that day.
This is the big event. Celebrations Fajitas!

987
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:30,149
I admire the dedication to the thief's Depot,

988
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:35,196
and I know I've sat back too,
but this opportunity only given once.

989
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:37,090
Waiver.

990
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:43,564
This is your chance. Do not miss.
But, you know, there is no pressure.

991
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,369
All right, gentlemen.

992
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,013
Yes!

993
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:04,183
Great. Leave it
for technical testing.

994
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,282
Can we talk, Courtney?

995
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,692
Is not this interesting?
Everything went well.

996
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:12,257
And it marks the solo.
Are intuitive, spontaneous, Let go!

997
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,630
- Important ...
- Who would have thought

998
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,966
improvisation which will give
a lot of energy to the group?

999
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:19,269
"Mr. Romano? Let us consider the control
lights.

1000
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:32,709
Hello, Stavros. I came to collect
our singer for the exam.

1001
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,189
I do not think you're here, Amy.
Must be at work.

1002
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:39,254
So you call strut
in ridiculous costumes

1003
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,125
with this group of strangers?

1004
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:45,599
That's good of you, Amy.
Forcing their leaders to use it,

1005
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,927
and I believe their colleagues
good people.

1006
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:52,235
Are you the boss? Does your colleagues?

1007
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,801
Nikko said what he did?

1008
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:04,175
# I used to see the world as a cold
Very cool

1009
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:09,556
# I always feel so alone

1010
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:19,061
# How do you know
you'll be here? Yes

1011
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:26,530
# How do you see
water behind my eyes? Yes

1012
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:32,072
# I never realized how ...

1013
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:36,140
What are you doing?
Is this a job you and your study group?

1014
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,719
I wondered about the lack of books!

1015
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,186
- Stavros, I can explain. Can we?
- You lie!

1016
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:43,554
Why? To pavonearte do ...

1017
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,085
What are they doing?

1018
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:49,494
This is called a choir.
This has a rich history!

1019
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,566
This happens Nikko will help us

1020
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,727
to win the championship tomorrow night!

1021
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,103
Well, Nikko.
Is there anyone who does not have to lie?

1022
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:01,802
Sorry to break your dreams,

1023
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,540
but tomorrow will be a hearing Nikko
to the owner of Apex Recordings.

1024
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:06,637
- What?
- What?

1025
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:10,344
Nikko ... Is that true?

1026
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:14,816
Yes Rich Dickinson considered himself
Flux that will be successful!

1027
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:18,454
"Flux? What bands throw?

1028
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:23,624
Nikko has never done anything like that.

1029
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,637
- I try to tell you.
- I do not understand.

1030
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:33,769
you've dreamed of this all you life.

1031
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:38,011
Talk later
you lies and deceit,

1032
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,345
but now we go from here
and get ready for tomorrow.

1033
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,179
Wait, Nikko!

1034
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:50,248
And you want to dance?
First, you must learn to walk.

1035
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,328
Nikko, greet your friends.

1036
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,294
Sorry guys.

1037
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:10,977
Me too.

1038
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:19,250
I can not imagine why you do not want to act
with professionals.

1039
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,919
From the beginning.

1040
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,475
Nice view.

1041
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:56,118
Your brother said I'd find you here.

1042
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:03,129
If you come to give me advice,

1043
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:09,301
'But it will be grateful.

1044
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,609
Some time ago I was a music teacher,

1045
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,775
and never admitted to the student
because they violate the liver,

1046
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:27,322
but the show has never coral
part of the job that I liked.

1047
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,752
- I think you know, Mr. Romano.
- Really?

1048
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:35,962
Yes

1049
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:41,401
Nikko, when you came,

1050
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,641
you really enter.
I saw the talent, skill, and you remind me

1051
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:53,144
myself. A long time ago.

1052
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,076
Why?

1053
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,349
Was in a band?

1054
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:01,787
Remember how I said ...
I grew up with a fish bone?

1055
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,118
Yes

1056
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:08,026
- It is not entirely correct.
- Why not?

1057
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,558
Wait, wait a minute. ye ...

1058
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:16,564
you do not grow with herringbone.
Herringbone you!

1059
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,867
Joey ye Romans! Joey Rome!

1060
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:21,602
He knew he was dead
or who lived on a desert island.

1061
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,234
Internet lie! All crazy.

1062
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:26,576
No, no. you can not tell anyone.

1063
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,344
I said because I think
You can receive advice

1064
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,851
above
and then destroying it.

1065
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:36,084
"Damage? What are you talking about?
These icons of music integrity.

1066
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,385
Everyone knows who resigned

1067
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:39,120
should not be dominated by companies ...

1068
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,788
Or because they do not play in the stadium
before 40,000 fans?

1069
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:45,128
- Because they are not going to sell.
- Because I'm afraid.

1070
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,635
Nikko, after the success of
Our first song,

1071
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:53,231
small clubs to be
in large places. I can not do it.

1072
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:57,912
I like being a musician, I enjoy it,
but I hate to be a rock star.

1073
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:03,781
And I blame the company, I changed my name
and here I am.

1074
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,552
Why do I say that?

1075
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:14,925
Because you only have one chance
do it well.

1076
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:21,327
No offense, Mr. Romano, Rome,
You are old, not dead.

1077
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:23,596
You know, I'm not too old.

1078
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:26,174
I gave up on it.
If you missed it, you can start again.

1079
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:30,644
Nikko, my window is now closed.
Your turn.

1080
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,311
And you have to make the right decision
for the right reasons.

1081
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:38,318
What can I do?
What band preference for a Spectacular?

1082
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,548
Nikko, do not tell you what to do.
I just say at the end of the day,

1083
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:43,215
you have to live with your choices.

1084
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:48,285
Whatever you decide,
make sure what you want.

1085
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,698
Nikko ... Nikko ...

1086
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,734
Think about it.

1087
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,340
Is everything okay, honey?

1088
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:39,479
I smoothed.
Every detail counts!

1089
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,547
I'm not talking about the costumes.

1090
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:49,887
The wrong time,
and the show choir is a team effort ...

1091
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,829
Honey,
because I think he has changed.

1092
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,866
Spectacular, but it will do very well without it!

1093
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:04,866
How about you, dear? Oh, dear.

1094
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:12,236
Okay. Okay. Remove. I know.

1095
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:19,614
Why am I crying?
I do not care about the show choir,

1096
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:24,925
Spectacular or not anyone else. I hate it!

1097
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:30,491
I know. In addition, there must be so tired
All trials

1098
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:34,558
- He will do poorly in audition.
- No, Mama! This will do great.

1099
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:38,006
Did you dream!

1100
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,042
Oh, dear.

1101
01:14:57,259 --> 01:15:00,990
It's heavy. My back hurts.
I feel like I'm your father.

1102
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:02,889
He was armed.

1103
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:08,191
Well, what Nikko truck load?
Media Alert!

1104
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:10,861
I got it!

1105
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,806
You see, Nikko? Echarte of the band
for your own good.

1106
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:16,969
You have reached the bottom,
and if the show choir is not the bottom ...

1107
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:19,843
- I mean, it's sad.
- No, it was synthetic.

1108
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,182
Not listening.

1109
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,279
If you like riding with these people,

1110
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:28,947
wave should be good.

1111
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:30,684
Yes, they are. Thank you.

1112
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,096
Dickinson said very supportive.

1113
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,190
Yes, that's not true.

1114
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,970
I could have done. But I do not.

1115
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:48,474
- Okay, that was understandable.
- It's ancient history.

1116
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:49,566
- Thanks, Eric.
- Ready?

1117
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:52,772
Nikko, can talk for a minute?

1118
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,379
Yes, but you can do it quickly.

1119
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:59,784
- What important actions ...
- I can handle it. Thank you.

1120
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:06,794
Courtney, I know how you feel.
And do not blame you.

1121
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:12,957
But this is not the choir.
It's only one way to ...

1122
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,401
Good luck.

1123
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,270
- Come on, Nikko.
- Roque.

1124
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,345
Come on, Nikko.

1125
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:57,268
22 ANNUAL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
JAZZ FOR CORAL FEDERATlON

1126
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:07,212
Courtney total chaos.
And two years ago elasticity.

1127
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:10,052
Okay. Relax. Okay.

1128
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,993
Well, I do not believe
they come after us.

1129
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,530
Do not envy them.

1130
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,567
Are they before? you'd better comb
and wear make-up.

1131
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:22,193
I've done it!

1132
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,667
Where is the rocker?

1133
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:31,440
Oh God. I'm out
and still dating.

1134
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:33,343
They're professionals.

1135
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,376
Tammi Dyson true.

1136
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,081
Nikko sin, we will fail
epic failure.

1137
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,919
Not listening.
I know they are disappointed.

1138
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:47,826
But life is full of disappointments.
Get up and go to the stage

1139
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:51,990
Nikko looking for his dream.
And now it's time to find our own.

1140
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:55,103
# Live my life that I like

1141
01:17:55,337 --> 01:18:01,298
# They say I'm a little rebellious
# Try to classify, analyze

1142
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,504
# But I never lower the tone

1143
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:07,377
Well, well, I heard too.

1144
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:13,778
Addons Sorry. We are not interested. But thank you.
Have fun at prom. </ I> </ i>

1145
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:20,784
Rich, you know it better than that.
Is warming. Come.

1146
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:29,998
Hey, kid. I heard before
and I know you much better. What went wrong?

1147
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:33,472
- What do you mean?
- Where is your heart?

1148
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:38,539
- Not in the song. An empty dream.
- I know, you're right.

1149
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:42,272
Mr. Dickinson, Mr. Gage,

1150
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:44,509
please,

1151
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,246
let me show where my heart.

1152
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:07,106
# There was a fever in me
He consumes

1153
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:13,138
# If tried, I can not hide

1154
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:16,911
# I hear the song

1155
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,007
# A song

1156
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,520
# This is the first time I heard it

1157
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:27,490
# I thought I would take the opportunity tonight

1158
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:34,260
# At the moment I'm waiting
To turn the key and opened the door

1159
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:37,597
# Everything is clear before me

1160
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:41,073
# I finally found a way

1161
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:47,077
# Here's an invitation
My own conclusions

1162
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:51,747
# On the wings of a dream

1163
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,912
# I can fly so high in the eyes

1164
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,956
# On the wings of a dream

1165
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,955
# See how to touch the sky

1166
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:02,586
# This is the night tonight

1167
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:04,392
# My dreams become reality

1168
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:07,866
# Always say this will

1169
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:12,872
# See how many flights

1170
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:14,899
# On the wings of a dream

1171
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,443
# On the wings of a dream

1172
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,172
# If only creyeras

1173
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,408
# On the wings of a dream

1174
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:26,954
# This is the burning of coal
It has become a fire

1175
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:32,559
# Now we have a light that guides us

1176
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:40,028
# Every day of my life
I cling to my faith

1177
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:47,332
# Do not ever think to let you go
or surrender

1178
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:51,140
# The game continues, and I want to play

1179
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:53,237
# I'll take my position because I will stay here

1180
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,977
- Boys we'll do well.
- I hope so.

1181
01:20:57,385 --> 01:21:01,116
# The stars are visible

1182
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:06,286
# Do not ever look down
# Do not touch the floor

1183
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:13,458
# On the wings of a dream
# I can fly so high in the eyes

1184
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:16,969
# On the wings of a dream

1185
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,836
By the way, thank you
by letting them use your song.

1186
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,578
- Did you know?
- Are you kidding?

1187
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:26,875
I covered the wall
Poster herringbone.

1188
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:30,042
I knew from the first meeting
between parents and teachers.

1189
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:34,281
# ... far
On the wings of a dream

1190
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,821
# On the wings of a dream

1191
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:37,585
# On the wings of a dream

1192
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,387
# On the wings of a dream

1193
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:41,018
# Life is more than it seems

1194
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:42,619
# On the wings of a dream

1195
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,289
# On the wings of a dream

1196
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,094
# On the wings of a dream

1197
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:49,261

1199
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,566
# On the wings of a dream

1200
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:20,960
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1201
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,667
What are you doing?

1202
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,439
I could have made another bow.
I worship.

1203
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,139
- Very good.
- I know.

1204
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:40,850
Come here. It's our turn
and whatever happens, remember ...

1205
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:46,724
- Oh, no. Will tell us we want.
- Shut up! I love you.

1206
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:49,956
Addons ... Spectacular! </ I> </ i>

1207
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:56,199
- Let's have fun.
- I thought I would throw up.

1208
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:13,244
# I used to see the world as a cold
Very cool

1209
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:18,659
# I always feel so alone

1210
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:26,060
# How do I know you're going to be here?

1211
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:27,992
# Yes

1212
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:33,403
# How do you see through my tears?

1213
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,107
# Yes

1214
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:39,639
# I never realized

1215
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:44,151
# How can anyone do everything so well

1216
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:50,588
# A heart so sad
You made me turn

1217
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:59,757
# You give me something to believe

1218
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:03,326
# After all we went through

1219
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:08,398
# The love you gave me
Back to you

1220
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:16,749
# You give me something to believe
you can see how I really

1221
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:23,288
# And here with you
# This is where I belong

1222
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:29,095
- What is happening with your hearing?
- I thought it would be better here.

1223
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:36,300
# I do not need to imagine more

1224
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:37,872
# None

1225
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:43,341
# All the time I was waiting

1226
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:51,145
# And now we are together, the other side

1227
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:52,742
# Yes

1228
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:57,484
# No one seems impossible tonight

1229
01:24:58,726 --> 01:24:59,988
# - Yes
# - Yes

1230
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,428
# - Search on in my heart

We feel so alive

# We need love
To find us, to guide us

1243
01:25:54,749 --> 01:26:01,678
# All the way
In this case we believe

1244

but you lost, sorry
so they will not win trophies.

I think it must comply with
with a recording contract delicious!

Thank you, sir,
