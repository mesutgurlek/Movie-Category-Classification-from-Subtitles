1
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,880
(Squawks)

2
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,760
It's taking so long.

3
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,320
(Chuckles) Look at yourself, Father.

4
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,680
You'd think
this was your first child.

5
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,240
Tell me, were you this nervous
when I was born?

6
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,800
Well, yes and no.
It was different with your mother.

7
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,040
But with Rachel, we gave up hope.

8
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,960
We were told
she could never have children.

9
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,080
- Father! It's a boy!
- Father.

10
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,320
- Father, it's a boy!
- It's a boy.

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
(Baby crying)

12
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,560
My boy!

13
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
(Crying continues)

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,480
Can you believe it?
Rachel had a baby.

15
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,920
I guess it is a miracle.

16
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,800
(Baby coos)

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,640
O God, who is the father of us all,

18
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,280
you have blessed me
with a gift beyond all measure.

19
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,520
Within a barren wife,

20
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,560
amid the twilight skies of my life,

21
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,880
you've placed a treasure.

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,440
# A brightly shining star
where there was none

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,960
# You have granted us a son

24
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
(Rachel) # Dreams do come true.

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,760
- # Look at you
- (Father) # Joseph

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,400
(All) # Our baby brother
(Father) # He is special

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,880
# He is one of us,
we'll keep him from harm

28
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,360
# And we will teach him

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,040
# I will teach him
all he needs to know

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,760
# He'll stand apart from other men

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,080
# We'll stand beside him and together

32
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,840
# We will show him
what it means to be a family... #

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Ah. Ooh.

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,880
# You are a miracle child

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,400
# You are the best

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,960
# You shine the brightest... #

37
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,720
- (Laughs)
- Joseph.

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,840
Come on. Come to Papa.

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
# Your trails be blessed

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,760
# Your trials the lightest

41
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
# You were made for better things

42
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,320
# You will share the air of kings

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,800
# You were born and fortune smiled

44
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,200
# For you are a miracle child

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,920
(Rachel) # The sun will rise

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,080
# Within your eyes

47
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,840
# The moon will light your smile

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,160
# And Heaven grace your gentle face

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,960
- # With power to beguile... #
- Good night, Joseph.

50
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,880
# You will wade through
the river of sorrows

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,960
# Warm and dry

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
(Father) # And angels
will guide your tomorrows

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,960
# This I prophesy

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,480
(Both) # For you are a miracle child

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,240
# You are the best

56
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,760
# You shine the brightest

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,840
# Your days will be cloudless
and mild

58
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,160
# Your trails be blessed

59
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,280
# Your trials the lightest

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,240
# You were made for better things

61
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,680
# You will share the air of kings

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,360
# You were born and fortune smiled

63
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,400
# For you are a miracle child

64
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,520
# Dearest Mother

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,640
# Beloved Father

66
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,200
# A coat of colours
bright as butterfly wings

67
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,200
# To remind me

68
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,440
# Things you've told me all my life

69
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,440
# I am special, I am smart

70
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,920
# I am somehow set apart

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,600
# Petty rules and limitations
don't apply

72
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,240
# For I

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,120
# Am a miracle child

74
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
# I can't be harmed

75
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,920
# I'm wrapped in rainbows

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,160
# Though fate
can be heartless and vile

77
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,640
# My life's been charmed

78
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
# And shall remain so

79
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,200
# I was made for something more

80
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,080
# Not to struggle but to soar

81
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,480
# To my fortune reconciled

82
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,440
# For I am a miracle child

83
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,640
# You won't see me bent over double

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,600
# In darkness and rubble

85
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,080
# Where mountains of trouble
are piled

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,080
# I was destined to fly

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,720
# Watch me light up the sky

88
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,760
# For I am a miracle child #

89
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,120
(Insects chirping)

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,000
(Bleating)

91
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,120
(Thunder rumbles)

92
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,080
(Growling)

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,880
(Barks)

94
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,960
(Wolves barking)

95
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,680
- (Jingles)
- (Sheep bleating)

96
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,080
- (Whispers) Hey...
- (Growls)

97
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,560
- No! Stop!
- What's wrong?

98
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,840
- What's going on?
- What did he say?

99
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,320
- Oh, it's Joseph.
- It was wolves!

100
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,320
Coming out of the shadows.
I was surrounded.

101
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,840
- They were all around...
- That's it?

102
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,840
- You woke us...for a dream?
- Ooh!

103
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,520
Quiet! You want to scare the sheep?

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,400
- The sheep. The ram.
- (Brothers murmuring)

105
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,320
- The wolves killed the ram.
- (Bleats)

106
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,320
It was dead. I... I don't understand.
It all seemed so real.

107
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,480
- Everything is fine, Joseph.
- It's over. Don't worry.

108
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,880
Boys, since you're up,
make yourselves useful.

109
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,880
Get to work before sunup.

110
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,200
(Brothers groan)

111
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,200
Thanks(!)

112
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,520
(Grumbling)

113
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,200
- Joseph, where are you going?
- Um, I...

114
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,760
You have studies.

115
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,240
But, I wanna go with them.

116
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,280
- They have their work and you yours.
- But why?

117
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,560
Because you do.
Because you're a miracle child.

118
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,040
For you things are different.

119
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,600
I don't want to be different.
I want to be like them.

120
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,480
Joseph, God has a plan
and a purpose for you.

121
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,160
- You're not like the rest of us.
- (Sighs)

122
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,880
I've worked this earth all my life,
just as my father and grandfather did

123
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,120
and your brothers will after me.

124
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
That won't be your future.

125
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,960
Jacob, even God
rested on the seventh day.

126
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,360
He'll find his future soon enough.

127
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,400
- Let him be with his brothers.
- Please?

128
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,800
(Sighs) Go on.

129
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
Thanks.

130
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,240
Be safe!

131
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,360
(Sheep bleating)

132
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,200
(Joseph) Judah! Simeon!

133
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
- Hmph! Look who's here.
- The miracle child.

134
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,160
What are you doing?
Don't you have some scrolls to read?

135
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Here, let me do that.

136
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,360
Wait, wait!
You have to be very careful.

137
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,160
- You'll cut your hands on the fur(!)
- Get away!

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,640
- (All laughing)
- I... I just want to help.

139
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
Thanks to you, we'll have to
work an extra hour today.

140
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,280
You're tired
because you were out all night.

141
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,640
Why, you little sneak...
What do you know?

142
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,640
Everything.
The women and the drinking...

143
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,800
- There's a lot Father doesn't know.
- You wouldn't?

144
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,680
He would, the brat.

145
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,960
- One word and I'll wring your neck.
- Stop it!

146
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,400
We should be happy for his help.

147
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,960
Maybe he can do your work, Simeon.
Somebody should.

148
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,480
(Laughter)

149
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,080
And there is something Joseph can do.

150
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,040
- What's he doing?
- Shh!

151
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,640
While we round up the strays,
can you watch the herd?

152
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
- Of course.
- Good.

153
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,600
We'll be back soon. Let's go.

154
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,640
Maybe we should split up.
You go over there.

155
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
- I'll go this way.
- (Chuckles) Hey! What are you doing?

156
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,080
(Laughs)

157
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,640
- (Bleats)
- (Laughs)

158
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,200
(Brothers laughing and chattering)

159
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,040
- Whoo-hoo!
- (Shouting)

160
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,360
- Get him.
- You're too heavy.

161
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,400
- (Laughing)
- (Sighs)

162
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,480
(Groans)

163
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,360
- (Bleats)
- What?

164
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,280
Are you making fun of me too?

165
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,280
- (Bleating)
- (Laughs)

166
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,600
- (Bleats)
- Hey! Hey, come back!

167
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,160
- (Growling)
- Huh?

168
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,480
- (Growling)
- (Gasps)

169
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,400
Get away! Get away!

170
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,120
(Bleating)

171
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,520
(Wolves barking)

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,560
- Gotcha!
- (Wolves snarling)

173
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,840
(Whimpers)

174
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,720
Back! Back!

175
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,840
- Get away!
- (Growling)

176
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,840
(Sighs)

177
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,960
Joseph, are you hurt?

178
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,560
Father! (Panting)

179
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,440
Your brothers, where are they?

180
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,440
I asked you a question!

181
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,320
They're...they're, uh...

182
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,920
They...they went swimming.

183
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,640
- Swimming?
- (Panting)

184
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,960
- What happened?
- This is how you take charge?

185
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,320
I expect you to watch out for Joseph,
but you abandoned my son!

186
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,040
- My son!
- Aren't we your sons too?

187
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,520
- The ram!
- (Bleats)

188
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,400
- (Jingles)
- (Brother) It's Joseph's dream!

189
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,000
Wolves kill sheep.
It happens all the time.

190
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,160
No! I understand.

191
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,680
God sent you a vision of the future.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,360
Joseph didn't really
see the future, did he?

193
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,520
Let's get back to work.

194
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,800
(Insects chirping)

195
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,880
(Grunts)

196
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,960
(Squawking)

197
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Why do we wash before work?

198
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,040
We don't want the sheep smelling you!

199
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,840
(Laughing) Look who finally woke up.

200
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,440
- Look what the sun brought up.
- Nice of you to join us.

201
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Good morning, Joseph.

202
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,960
Mom, last night I had another dream.

203
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,000
- Oh, another dream!
- Ooh!

204
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,840
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Please, why don't you share it?

205
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,760
Who'd the wolf get this time?

206
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,320
You can laugh, but it was about you.

207
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,120
Oh, please, you must tell us
our future, great Joseph!

208
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,880
- Leave me alone!
- Come on, tell us.

209
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,600
We're dying to hear about it.

210
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,040
We were carrying sheaves of wheat.

211
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,680
I was among you,

212
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,280
but then all of a sudden I was above
you and your wheat bowed to me...

213
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,920
- I wonder what that means.
- Nothing, that's what.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,320
Hey, you asked to hear the dream.

215
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,960
What happened next?

216
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,760
The sky was dark
and all around me were stars

217
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,480
- They were bowing to me too.
- Ooh! Let's all bow down to Joseph!

218
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,560
We can't ignore these dreams.
After all, his last one came true.

219
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,200
Are you saying that Joseph belongs
above all of us, even Judah?

220
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,280
I'm not saying that,
but there could be a message here.

221
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,080
Judah's led the herd for years,
brought in the wheat...

222
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,720
He comes first before any of us -
especially Joseph.

223
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,200
Judah, it's not up to me.

224
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,280
God may be telling us
something of our future.

225
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,720
- Then my work doesn't matter.
- Watch your tongue.

226
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,920
Jacob, Judah, please!

227
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,760
- I've had enough of this.
- Let's go.

228
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,880
(Sighs) Look at
what your dreams have done.

229
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,600
Don't get mad at me.
I didn't ask for them.

230
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,360
- Or this either, brother!
- Half-brother!

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,280
Joseph! Boys!
Apologise to each other!

232
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,320
Let me talk to Joseph.

233
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,840
(Jacob) He's just a boy.
You're too harsh on him.

234
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,880
You're always defending him!

235
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,360
(Jacob) His dreams come from God.

236
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,320
Joseph, you need to be
more understanding of your brothers.

237
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,440
Life is harder for them
than it will be for you.

238
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,200
Why do you defend them?
They're not even your sons.

239
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,480
They're no less my sons than you are.

240
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,360
We're family, all of us.

241
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,120
If we break apart,
we have nothing left.

242
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,000
# You've seen the damage words can do

243
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,080
# When full of thoughtless pride

244
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,680
# Now heed the wiser voice in you

245
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,440
# That calls to be your guide

246
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,760
# The flowers reaching for the sun

247
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,320
# Are all uniquely blessed

248
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,240
# But though each is special

249
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,120
# Not a one is better

250
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,800
# Than the rest

251
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
# Bloom, bloom, may you know

252
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,360
# The wisdom only time breeds

253
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,280
# There's room, bloom and you'll grow

254
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,400
# To follow where your heart leads

255
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,400
# Bloom and may you bring

256
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,360
# Your colours to the vast bouquet

257
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,520
# There's room, bloom,
learn one thing

258
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:29,240
# Your gifts are meant to give away #

259
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,760
Thanks, Mom.

260
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,400
Judah! Simeon!

261
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,280
Levi! Reuben!

262
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,240
Where are you?

263
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,960
- (Judah) Joseph couldn't lead sheep.
- (Reuben) But he's our brother.

264
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,280
(Simeon) Half brother.
Judah should take over.

265
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,960
- But...
- Do you want Joseph in charge?

266
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,400
We agree that something
has to be done about Joseph?

267
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,840
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

268
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,760
- Hey! The spy is back!
- I wasn't spying!

269
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,600
- Did Father tell you to check on us?
- No!

270
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,280
- I want to...
- Report on us to Father?

271
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,440
- You're his favourite.
- N-no.

272
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,320
You look at scrolls all day
while we sweat.

273
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,120
Why is that? Is it because
we don't have pretty coats?

274
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,960
- I have mine.
- (Grunts) That's my coat!

275
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,280
Step aside.
I'm the new head of the family.

276
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,920
Bow before me,
you sheaves of wheat!

277
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,800
Oh, yes, Master Joseph,
ruler of the world.

278
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,480
Give it back, now!

279
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,240
If you want your coat,
why don't you go get it?

280
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,480
- Levi's got it.
- No, I don't. Judah does.

281
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,400
- Come on!
- I've got it!

282
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
(Screams)

283
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,480
(Laughing)

284
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,440
- I've had enough of this game!
- Joseph!

285
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,440
Who says this is a game?

286
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,520
What are you doing? Leave me alone!
No! Stop it!

287
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,480
(Gasps)

288
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,720
Oh! Ohh!

289
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,680
(Coughing)

290
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,120
What do we do now?

291
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,560
Are we just going to leave him there?

292
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,720
- We'll think of something.
- Somebody!

293
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,200
- Just get out of here.
- Maybe he can dream his way out.

294
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Don't leave me here alone!

295
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,880
(Sighs)

296
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,600
(Wolf howling)

297
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,040
(Shivering)

298
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,920
Aah! Aah!

299
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,760
(Whoosh)

300
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,760
I knew you'd come back.

301
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,720
(Grunts)

302
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,320
You think this is funny?
Father won't be laughing when...

303
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,320
- Who are you?
- Get him.

304
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Ow!

305
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Let me go! You don't understand.
I'm from the house of Jacob!

306
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,920
- Scrawny, isn't he?
- It's hard to tell.

307
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,920
(Groans)

308
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,880
- Hmm.
- No, no, no, don't take my...

309
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,800
- (Groans)
- Get up!

310
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,440
- (Grunts)
- Looks like he's never worked a day.

311
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
- That'll change.
- (Laughing)

312
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,680
My brothers will come for me. Judah!

313
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,960
- Simeon! Levi! Please help me!
- Joseph!

314
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,600
We're right here.

315
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,800
(Sighs) Judah.

316
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,440
I told you they'd come for me.

317
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,000
As agreed, 20 pieces of silver.

318
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,000
J-Judah... Why...?

319
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,680
No! Help me!

320
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,560
Levi, please. Issachar.

321
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,560
Simeon. Stop them.

322
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,400
Judah. Judah, help me, please.

323
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,360
Please!

324
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,800
Judah, please!

325
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,000
Judah, we can't turn back now.
We've gone too far.

326
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,240
- Aah!
- Hut, hut!

327
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,200
- (Brays)
- (Chuckles)

328
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,720
I'm your brother!

329
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,160
I'm your brother!

330
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,840
Half-brother.

331
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,480
- (Slaver) Yah!
- (Saddle jingling)

332
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,560
(Wind whistling)

333
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,480
(Wolf howling)

334
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,400
(Slavers talking)

335
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,640
(Shivers)

336
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,000
(Gasps)

337
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,760
- Where could he have gone?
- Don't worry.

338
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,520
I'm sure he's all right.

339
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,880
The boys will find him.

340
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,200
(Judah) Father.

341
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,880
This is all we found.

342
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
(Gasps) Joseph!

343
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,720
- No! Joseph!
- Joseph!

344
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,440
(Gasping)

345
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,920
- Oh, Rachel.
- (Sobbing)

346
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,360
- (Grunts)
- Hey, wake up.

347
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,400
(Laughter)

348
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,720
# Behold the glory
behold the wonder

349
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,320
# What we have made
shall not be torn asunder

350
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,160
# Such vast achievement
stone and papyrus

351
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,960
# Beneath the gaze
of Isis and Osiris

352
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,160
# Land of majesty

353
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,080
# Where the heavens smile

354
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,520
# Jewel of history shining

355
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,840
# By the Nile #

356
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,680
- Exquisite, aren't they?
- Yes.

357
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,560
- Where's the slave market?
- By the docks.

358
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,360
(Camel brays)

359
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,360
# Serve and be silent

360
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,000
# You who are chattel

361
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,000
# We think of you
as little more than cattle

362
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,000
# This is your lot now
and we advise you

363
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,240
# To bow before
whatever master buys you

364
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,600
# Feel the power here

365
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,360
# Power has its price

366
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,520
# Some can live like gods

367
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,280
# Some must sacrifice... #

368
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,240
- What do you have?
- A Canaanite.

369
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,880
# Through the centuries
many backs have bent

370
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,800
# Many dreams are built

371
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,840
- # Many lives are spent #
- Move, slave!

372
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,720
Get in line.

373
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,080
(Trader) Slaves for sale!
Buy this one!

374
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,400
(Buyer) Let's have a look.
Let me see his teeth.

375
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,360
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

376
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,120
He's too skinny.

377
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,800
This is more like it.

378
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,640
The captain of the guard
needs a slave for his household.

379
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,280
I have one he might like.

380
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,760
Thirty pieces? Hmm.

381
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,880
He looks healthy enough.
Lord Potiphar!

382
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,560
- He'll do.
- Looks like we have some work to do.

383
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,800
# Look and be humbled
learn what your place is

384
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,760
# Egyptian slave
no matter what your race is

385
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,720
# This is your future
your life suspended

386
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,760
# And everything
you knew before has ended

387
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,920
# You are Egypt's now

388
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,280
# We have all control

389
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
# From your every step

390
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,440
# To your very soul #
- Hold still.

391
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,080
You're done. He's ready for work.

392
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,600
It's not for your face.
It's for the floor.

393
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,480
(Grunting)

394
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,080
Ow!

395
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,200
(Laughter)

396
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,240
- 'Hey, Joseph, you missed a spot.'
- (Laughing)

397
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,720
(Levi) 'Real work's different.'

398
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,800
- 'No more baby soft hands.'
- 'Who bows now, little brother? '

399
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,680
(Brothers laughing)

400
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,440
(Grunting)

401
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,520
- You there.
- (Laughter stops)

402
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,000
Have you cleaned
this entire courtyard yourself?

403
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,800
- Yes.
- (Woman) He's a hard worker.

404
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,280
Hmm.

405
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,960
We could put him
to better use inside?

406
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,680
My wife thinks you should work
for her. What do you say?

407
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,960
I cannot say.

408
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,080
A slave is not his own master.

409
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,040
Well said.

410
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,080
Find him some new clothes.
Then get someone else to finish.

411
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,800
- (Yowling)
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Come on.

412
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,240
- (Yowling)
- Who brought the cat?

413
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,960
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- Stop!

414
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,200
- (Chuckles)
- Come down!

415
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,240
Aunt Zuleika, I'm sorry.
I'll get it down.

416
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,600
- (Miaows)
- Please come down.

417
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,760
Come here. Look at this.

418
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,920
- Oh.
- (Women chuckling)

419
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,200
- Hmm. She seems to like you.
- (Miaows)

420
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,360
- (Chuckles)
- Thank you.

421
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,240
I haven't seen you here before.

422
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
- Oh, I'm new.
- Asenath.

423
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,160
Coming, Aunt Zuleika. Goodbye.

424
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,200
(Sighs)

425
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,120
(Horse whinnying)

426
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,760
(Woman) Joseph, come here.

427
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
I'm waiting.

428
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,880
I'm coming!

429
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,040
Oh! Sorry, Asenath.

430
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,840
- Oh! (Giggles)
- What?

431
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,200
You don't want my aunt
seeing you like this.

432
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,280
- That's better.
- Thanks.

433
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,400
- (Horse whinnies)
- Slave.

434
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,720
- (Flies buzzing)
- Oh, yes, of course.

435
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,200
- (Galloping hooves)
- Hyah! Hyah!

436
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,160
(Zuleika) What a magnificent animal.

437
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,440
- (Potiphar laughing)
- Slave, I'm in the sun.

438
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,760
(Laughing) Whoa!

439
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,720
- Well?
- You were right.

440
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
He's all that you promised.

441
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,640
I haven't seen a finer horse
in all of Egypt.

442
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,360
I'm glad Your Excellency is pleased.

443
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,720
- There is still one small matter.
- Oh, yes. As we agreed.

444
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,720
(Coins jingling)

445
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,240
Forgive me,
but something is not quite right.

446
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,240
Hmm. I thought
I brought the right amount.

447
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,440
You're a busy man.
Anyone can make a mistake.

448
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,640
He's yours.
Pharaoh himself would be jealous.

449
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,920
(Potiphar) Yes, he's a fine horse.

450
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,360
Hmm.

451
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,920
Master, I think you should see this.

452
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,400
Uh... Get away from that.
Don't touch it!

453
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,440
Well, look at that.

454
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,880
Well, i-it's broken.

455
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,240
- Your Excellency, I had no idea.
- Of course not.

456
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,360
You're a busy man.
Anyone can make a mistake.

457
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,880
Yours will cost you your freedom.

458
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,520
Please, keep the stallion as a gift.

459
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,360
No. Take him away.

460
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,000
I have a dozen more horses!
Take them all! Please, anything!

461
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,240
Potiphar, you should keep it.

462
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,840
You said it was
the finest in all Egypt.

463
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,200
Own a horse taken from a thief?
What would that say about me?

464
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,720
You and your honour!

465
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,080
- You've done well. What's your name?
- Joseph.

466
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,440
Joseph. You're an educated slave.

467
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,680
- Where did you learn?
- My father taught me.

468
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,600
Ah. He taught you well.

469
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,680
- What else has your father taught?
- I can read and write Egyptian.

470
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,320
(Man) # A boy looks up

471
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,560
- # And sees a golden gift of chance
- What a mess.

472
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,800
Good luck.

473
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,400
# To prove his worth

474
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,280
# And make the best
of what might seem

475
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,920
# A dire circumstance

476
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
# Onward and onward
the slow and steady climb

477
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,480
- Master.
- Let's have a look.

478
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,040
# Task upon task that can lift him

479
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,360
- # To the summit over time
- Well done, Joseph.

480
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,280
# You've got to take
whatever road's at your feet

481
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,720
# You've got to make
whatever progress you can

482
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,760
# Although the map you hold
is far from complete

483
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,800
# You've got to take
whatever road's at your feet

484
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
(Laughing)

485
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,400
To a good year, and to your friend.

486
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,960
(Both laughing)

487
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,600
(Crickets chirping)

488
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,720
(Sighs)

489
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,160
(Judah) 'My neck is killing me.

490
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,560
- 'It's too early for this.'
- (Brothers grunting and laughing)

491
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,360
(Water sloshing)

492
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,040
- (Jacob) 'Rachel.'
- Joseph.

493
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,080
- Huh?
- Shh!

494
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,280
W-why are you here?

495
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,200
- Is something wrong?
- No.

496
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,800
This land...it's not Egypt.

497
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,360
Is this your home?

498
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,920
- Canaan.
- Please, tell me more about Canaan.

499
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,840
(Sighs)

500
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,120
This is the place where I was born.

501
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,440
These are the sunflowers
my mother planted.

502
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,720
This is my, uh...

503
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,120
- My...
- Family?

504
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,240
You miss them, don't you?

505
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,280
My brothers.

506
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
They betrayed me!

507
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,720
- Joseph, we are your family now.
- Huh?

508
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
We care for you here.

509
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,120
We... I feel you are special.

510
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,680
What? No.
W-why have you come here tonight?

511
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,360
- To be with you.
- No. This is not right.

512
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,000
- Look at me.
- I won't betray my master.

513
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,040
- I'm talking to you.
- No!

514
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,040
- Wait! I order you to stay.
- No!

515
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,600
Everything you are, you owe to me!

516
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,920
(Panting)

517
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,760
(Zuleika screams)

518
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,400
You stood apart
from the other slaves.

519
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,080
I let you work in my home.
I kept you from hard labour,

520
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
and you did well for me.

521
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
- Or so I thought.
- Master...

522
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,840
No other slave was ever given this
opportunity! I gave you my trust.

523
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,400
- What do you say?
- I did nothing wrong.

524
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,080
Still you insult me
with your denials!

525
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,040
- What am I to make of this?
- (Sobbing)

526
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,840
It's not what it seems.
I could never betray you, master.

527
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,760
Such insolence! Am I to believe
a slave over my own wife?

528
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,440
I swear. I did nothing to betray you.

529
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,520
Silence! For what you have done,
you must be put to death.

530
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,040
- See to it.
- No, Master, I beg you. Tell him!

531
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,840
Help me! Tell him that... (Groaning)

532
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,480
Help me! Please!

533
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,760
- Stop. He doesn't deserve to die.
- Why?

534
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,600
I see.

535
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,400
Take him to prison.

536
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,280
Wait, master. No! Please!
Believe me! I- I did nothing wrong!

537
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,440
This is a mistake! Uh!

538
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,800
I did nothing wrong.

539
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,560
Yeah, we know you're innocent.

540
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,160
(Squeaking)

541
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,520
I know it sounds crazy,
but it was so real.

542
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,040
I was up all night
with my own dreams.

543
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,600
Now you wanna take up
my day with yours?

544
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,640
No. Just listen.
I was back at Pharaoh's palace

545
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,760
in a garden of grapes
that had three old vines.

546
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,520
A tear fell from my eye,
and the vines drank it in.

547
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,960
They became so thick with grapes...

548
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,920
that I squeezed them into a cup
and served it to Pharaoh.

549
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,600
That is quite a dream.

550
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,440
- I know what your dream means.
- You do? H-how could you?

551
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,760
I just do. It's some kind of gift.

552
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,520
The three vines signify three days.

553
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,480
Then Pharaoh will bring
you back to the palace a free man.

554
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,040
- (Sighs) If only it were true.
- It is true.

555
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,200
And when you're free, tell Pharaoh
about my gift. Please.

556
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,720
Some gift. To make up fairy tales
and give hope to the foolish.

557
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,360
- Maybe he's not making it up.
- All right, then.

558
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,280
Here's one I've had every night
for a week.

559
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,080
I'm taking three baskets of bread
to Pharaoh when the baskets fall.

560
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,000
I go to pick up the bread,

561
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,240
when suddenly
a swarm of birds attack me.

562
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,600
They keep pecking at me
in the face and the eyes.

563
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,080
What does it mean?

564
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,640
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. Tell me.

565
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,360
Tell me!

566
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,800
(Sighs) The three baskets
also signify three days.

567
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,920
In three days,
Pharaoh will behead you,

568
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,680
and birds will feed on your flesh.

569
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,000
What? You're lying. You're lying!

570
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,800
- Stop it!
- Uhh! No!

571
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,680
Don't pay any attention to him.
We're not going anywhere.

572
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,120
(Squeaking)

573
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,600
(Door opens)

574
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,440
Take him.

575
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,480
Get up.

576
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,520
You knew. You knew!
That's not a gift!

577
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,200
- That's a curse!
- Pharaoh has summoned you.

578
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,600
- Why? What did I do?
- Let's go.

579
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,880
It's gonna be all right. You'll see.

580
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,120
- Tell Pharaoh about me.
- I will.

581
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,600
Don't forget me!

582
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,360
Don't forget me!

583
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,400
Guard! Tell them I'm still here!

584
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,200
Answer me!

585
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,840
(Sighs)

586
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,800
No one cares.

587
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,640
(Rain falling)

588
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,760
Asenath!

589
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,040
(Guard) Halt! Who's there?

590
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,440
No!

591
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,360
- (Thunder)
- (Squeaking)

592
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,840
(Roars)

593
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,640
(Spitting and panting)

594
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,600
God, why are you doing this to me?

595
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,640
Do you hear me?

596
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,960
Any kindness, you take away.

597
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,640
You gave me the dreams.
You brought me the gift!

598
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,480
Some gift! My dreams are lies.
What have I done to deserve this?

599
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,360
(Thunder)

600
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,760
# I thought I did what's right

601
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,960
# I thought I had the answers

602
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,440
# I thought I chose the surest road

603
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,600
# But that road brought me here

604
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,080
# So I put up a fight

605
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,360
# And told you how to help me

606
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,680
# Now, just when I have given up

607
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,880
# The truth is coming clear

608
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,600
# You know

609
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,400
# Better than I

610
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,360
# You know

611
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,840
# The way

612
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,800
# I've let go

613
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,600
# The need to know why

614
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,560
# For you know better

615
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,400
# Than I

616
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,360
# If this has been a test

617
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,240
# I cannot see the reason

618
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,840
# But maybe knowing "I don't know"

619
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,440
# Is part of getting through

620
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,840
# I try to do what's best

621
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,120
# And faith has made it easy

622
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,360
# To see the best thing I can do

623
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,320
# Is put my trust in you

624
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,400
# For you know

625
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,960
# Better than I

626
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,920
# You know

627
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,760
# The way

628
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,520
# I've let go

629
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,720
# The need to know why

630
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,160
# For you know better

631
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,640
# Than I

632
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,840
# I saw one cloud
and thought it was the sky

633
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,840
# I saw a bird and thought

634
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,520
# That I could follow

635
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,840
# But it was you
who taught that bird

636
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,440
# To fly

637
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,800
# If I let you reach me

638
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,440
# Will you teach me

639
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,600
# For you know

640
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,560
# Better than I

641
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,960
# You know the way

642
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,200
# I've let go

643
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,120
# The need to know why

644
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,960
# I'll take what answers

645
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,760
# You supply

646
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,240
# You know better

647
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,120
# Than I #

648
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,480
(Sighs)

649
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,520
Potiphar?

650
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,920
Pharaoh's butler
said you interpret dreams.

651
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,280
That is true. And?

652
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,760
Pharaoh is tortured by a dream.
None of his wise men can explain it.

653
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,680
I'm to bring you to the palace.

654
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,040
Potiphar?

655
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,560
It's good to see you again.

656
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,920
How could I
have allowed this to happen?

657
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,080
- My wife...
- I understand.

658
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,520
Let's go.

659
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,000
For the sake of Egypt,
relieve my suffering.

660
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,600
(Groans)

661
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,680
- Is this the one you spoke of?
- Yes, Excellency.

662
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,800
I'm told you merely need to hear
a dream and you can explain it.

663
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,880
Not me, Your Excellency.
The explanation comes from God.

664
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,400
None of my wise men or magicians,
none of my gods could help me.

665
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,240
What makes you think
your god is any different?

666
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
Tell me your dream, Pharaoh.

667
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,640
Every night it's the same.

668
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,120
I am standing by the Nile.

669
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,400
Seven healthy cows
graze peacefully on the banks.

670
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,760
(Thunderclap)

671
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,440
But then seven horrible,
sickly cows come from the same river,

672
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,000
the most wretched
I have ever seen in Egypt.

673
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,800
Suddenly they begin to devour
the healthy cattle,

674
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,800
and yet the cows remain
as sickly as before.

675
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,200
And then I wake up.

676
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,800
- Is there more?
- Yes. Another dream always follows.

677
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,520
Seven ears of grain, full and golden,
grow from a single stalk.

678
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,040
(Rumbling)

679
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,360
Suddenly, seven ears,
hardened and scorched,

680
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,600
spring up on the same stalk...

681
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,000
and swallow the seven good ears.

682
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,760
All that remains
are shrivelled grains unfit to eat...

683
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
and nothing else.

684
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,320
Well?

685
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,440
Pharaoh's dreams are one.

686
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,040
The healthy cows and ears of grain
are seven years of abundance.

687
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,360
The sickly cows
and the withered grain...

688
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,080
mean seven years of famine
will follow...

689
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
and destroy the land.

690
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,040
Egypt may not survive.

691
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,120
Can this be stopped?
What can be done?

692
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,400
You must find a man you can trust.

693
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,480
During the years of plenty,

694
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,360
have him collect one-fifth
of the grain from every field

695
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,200
and store it under guard.

696
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,000
Then, during the famine,
give it back to the people.

697
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,960
Potiphar, you trust this man?

698
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,520
With my life, Excellency.

699
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,280
(Crowd cheering)

700
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,800
(Crowd silences)

701
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,200
Through this man,
I have seen the future of Egypt.

702
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,840
And through his deeds,
we shall prosper.

703
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,800
(Crowd cheers)

704
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,240
I am giving him power over all Egypt.

705
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,920
Only Pharaoh will be greater.

706
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,440
You shall call him Tzafenat Paneah.

707
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,480
The God speaks and He lives.

708
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,840
(Crowd cheering)
Tzafenat Paneah! Tzafenat Paneah!

709
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,880
- (Miaows)
- Hey.

710
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,480
Kia, come back here. Hmm.

711
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,360
(Joseph clears throat)

712
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,640
(Gasps)

713
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,120
Tzafenat Paneah.

714
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,760
Joseph.

715
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,320
(Cheering)

716
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,760
# A single voice

717
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,800
# Is joined by multitudes in song

718
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,560
# With every verse

719
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,760
# They're finding harmonies
that rise to Heaven

720
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,160
- # Sure and strong
- (Asenath) Hey.

721
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,360
- We've come to help.
- # Richer and richer

722
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,280
- # The soil on which they thrive
- Great.

723
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,440
# Higher and higher

724
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,360
# A hymn of what it means to be alive

725
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,240
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

726
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,240
# You've got to leave
a little more than was here

727
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,600
# You may be prideful
of the strides you will make

728
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,600
# But keep one thing clear

729
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,880
# You're just a player
in a much bigger plan

730
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,960
# And still you have
to give it all that you can

731
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,680
# The very measure
of your soul is at stake

732
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,960
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

733
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,400
(Woman) # The seasons fly

734
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,560
# A man stands where a boy once stood

735
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,360
# His path unfolds

736
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,080
# And unafraid he walks in service

737
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,960
# Of a greater good

738
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:49,640
(Both) # Deeper and deeper
the lessons he has known

739
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,720
# Over and over

740
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,160
# The message
he is surely being shown

741
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,120
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

742
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,160
# You've got to leave
a little more than was here

743
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,000
# You may be prideful
of the strides you will make

744
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,960
# But keep one thing clear

745
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,560
# You're just a player
in a much bigger plan

746
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,680
# And still you have
to give it all that you can

747
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,560
# The very measure

748
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,280
# You've got to give

749
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,480
# The very measure

750
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:43,000
# You've got to give

751
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,480
(Wind whistles)

752
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,840
(Cawing)

753
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,200
(Straining)

754
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,080
Next. How many in your family?

755
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,400
- Five.
- Five.

756
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,440
Thank you, my lord.

757
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,000
(Potiphar) Next, please.

758
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,960
- A long life for you, Excellency.
- And for you.

759
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,960
Ah, here's a responsible young man.

760
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,280
- How many in your family?
- Four, my lord.

761
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,200
Very good.

762
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,400
- Hi there. What's your name?
- Menna.

763
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,960
And this is my sister Nyla.
I'm looking after her.

764
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,520
- Are you here for some grain too?
- (Gasps)

765
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,800
(Laughs)

766
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,800
- Thank you!
- Bye!

767
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,360
(Cries out)

768
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,160
- Here you go.
- (Potiphar) Who's next?

769
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,720
We are, my lord.

770
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,040
- You are not Egyptian.
- No, sir.

771
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,280
My brothers and I
have travelled far, from Canaan.

772
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,040
- Joseph, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

773
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,560
Look at you. You're shaking.

774
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,920
I-it must be the sun. I'll be fine.

775
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,280
(Judah) Our families are hungry.

776
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,240
You haven't contributed
to our supply.

777
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,760
We don't ask for charity.
We'll pay you with silver.

778
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,800
(Potiphar) How many are there?

779
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,360
12. 10 here and at home we have
our father and youngest brother.

780
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,480
- (Gasps)
- (Potiphar) Give them...

781
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,560
(Joseph) Nothing!

782
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,160
10 foreigners asking
for grain, no ties to Egypt.

783
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,920
Are you thieves, hoping to see
where we store our grain?

784
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,760
I don't know what you are,
but I don't believe your story.

785
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,880
Your Excellency,
everything we say is true.

786
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,960
Prove it!
Produce this youngest brother.

787
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,520
- But what would that prove?
- That you're not lying.

788
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,400
If it's the truth,
I'll let you buy grain.

789
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,000
Till then, arrest this one!

790
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,080
- (Gasps)
- Until you produce this brother.

791
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,360
- Take him.
- (Grunting)

792
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,360
- (All shouting)
- Stop!

793
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,080
- Judah, help me!
- (Guard) No!

794
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,040
- (Simeon) No! No! No!
- (Guard) Let's go.

795
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,080
(Door slams)

796
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,720
Joseph, what are you doing?

797
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,080
They're only feeding their families.

798
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,880
They're thieves,
here to steal our grain.

799
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,320
They needed food and they would pay.

800
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,240
How can you say they're thieves?
They've done nothing to you.

801
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,360
(Scoffs)

802
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,640
Nothing?

803
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,120
(Sighs)

804
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,400
- They're my brothers.
- What?

805
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,800
They sold me.
They sold me into slavery.

806
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,320
They took me away from my home.

807
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,120
I never got
to say goodbye to my mother.

808
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,560
I never got
to see my father grow old.

809
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,960
Joseph, I... I didn't know.

810
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,600
You're here now. You have a home,
a wife who loves you,

811
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,240
everything you could want.

812
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,840
No. Not everything.

813
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,920
I thought you learned something
in that cell.

814
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,600
Remember when
I would bring food to you?

815
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,440
Yes. It kept me going.

816
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,840
(Simeon) Hey! You won't keep me here.

817
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,080
My brothers will come for me.

818
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,600
(Echoing) My brothers will come...

819
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,320
Joseph.

820
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,600
# How long must there be anger here

821
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,000
# Before we can rejoice

822
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:04,000
# Embracing love instead of fear

823
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,760
# Is but a simple choice

824
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,400
# It's hard for me to see you fall

825
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,120
# So bitter and so blind

826
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,920
# When the truest nature of us all

827
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,920
# Invites us to be kind

828
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
# Bloom, bloom, may you know

829
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,920
# The wisdom only time breeds

830
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,920
# There's room, bloom and you'll grow

831
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,720
# To follow where your heart leads

832
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,360
# Bloom and may you live

833
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,640
# The way your life was meant to be

834
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,240
# There's room,
bloom and forgive... #

835
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,920
Tzafenat Paneah...

836
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,160
The family of Canaanites...
They've returned.

837
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,880
Thank you.

838
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,080
Maybe they've suffered
these last 20 years as well.

839
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,200
- Maybe they've changed.
- No.

840
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,280
I don't think so.

841
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,600
(Door closes)

842
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,800
(Murmuring)

843
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,120
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.

844
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,040
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

845
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,520
Welcome.

846
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,320
- You've done what I've asked?
- Our brother, Benjamin.

847
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,040
You kept your word.
Bring out the other brother.

848
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,480
So, Benjamin,
tell me of your mother and father.

849
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,120
My mother is no longer alive.

850
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,040
Oh. I- I'm sorry.

851
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,360
And your father?

852
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,520
- He's worried I'm here.
- Why is that?

853
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:19,920
- I'm a long way from home.
- Oh? Doesn't he trust your brothers?

854
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,480
He likes me to stay close by.

855
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,320
Really? Why is that?

856
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,000
A long time ago,
h-he lost his youngest son.

857
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,360
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

858
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,000
- He was killed.
- Killed? How?

859
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,880
By wolves.

860
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,840
- Wolves?
- Yes.

861
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,560
It broke my father's heart.

862
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,800
Well, it must have been very hard
on your brothers too.

863
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,040
- They never speak of it.
- Don't they?

864
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,160
- Benjamin!
- (Brothers) Simeon!

865
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,480
- I was beginning to worry.
- (All murmuring)

866
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:03,920
You must be hungry
after your journey. Come.

867
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,840
You'll be my guests.

868
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,640
(Traditional music)

869
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,200
- A toast...
- (Music stops)

870
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,960
to brothers.

871
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,760
(All) To brothers!

872
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,640
(Music resumes)

873
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,560
(Brothers arguing and protesting)

874
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,160
Stop this. You have no right.
We've done nothing wrong.

875
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,640
What's going on?
Why have they been arrested?

876
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,640
- Joseph, what are you doing?
- You'll see.

877
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,440
Get back in place. Get back in...

878
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,680
I give you food.
I take you into my home.

879
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,560
And this is how you repay me,
by stealing?

880
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,520
We wouldn't steal from you!

881
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,240
- And now you insult me by lying.
- What?

882
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,320
One of you has stolen from me.

883
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,000
Benjamin.

884
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,640
- (Murmuring) No...
- The favoured one.

885
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,480
- I didn't!
- Arrest him.

886
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,360
For this you will be punished.

887
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,680
- Someone put it there!
- Stop! Take me instead.

888
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,680
- No, take me.
- Take me!

889
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,680
- (All) Take me!
- Take any of us, your grace,

890
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,120
but, please, let the boy go.

891
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,800
You would sacrifice yourselves
for a spoiled half-brother?

892
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,240
Yes.

893
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,960
Why should you care if I take him,
beat him, make him a slave?

894
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:30,080
Because I will not
make my father suffer...again.

895
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,360
Again? What do you mean, "again"?

896
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,800
Our brother was not killed by wolves.

897
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,960
We were blinded by jealousy
and sold him into slavery.

898
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,080
For 20 years
we have lived with that guilt.

899
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,880
We can't go back without the boy.

900
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,720
My father could not bear it
a second time.

901
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,360
And neither could we.

902
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,120
If anyone is to be punished,
it should be us.

903
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,880
(Sighs)

904
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,440
I will not harm any of you
or our father.

905
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,920
I am your brother, Joseph.

906
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,480
- Joseph?
- I can't believe you're here.

907
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,000
How can it be?

908
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,440
Joseph?

909
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,040
I have so much to tell you,
so many questions to ask.

910
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:46,000
Oh, Joseph, can you ever forgive us?

911
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,320
I already have.

912
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,960
Can you forgive me for thinking
I was some miracle from God?

913
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,080
But you are a miracle.

914
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,480
God sent you to save our family
and all of Egypt.

915
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,600
- And you did.
- Asenath?

916
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:07,200
Please. I'd like you
to meet my brothers.

917
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,920
(All) Welcome. Pleasure to meet you.

918
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,840
You will join me here,

919
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,880
all of you, with your families.

920
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,040
Look!

921
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,400
- I see him! There he is!
- It's him! There he is!

922
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,200
- Joseph!
- Father.

923
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,320
Father! Father!

924
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,960
- Father!
- Joseph.

925
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,520
My boy. My boy.

926
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,000
Your mother prayed
this day would come,

927
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,160
that we'd all be together again
as a family.

928
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,400
- It's a miracle.
- Yes, Father. It is a miracle.

929
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,160
# Oh, you know

930
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,920
# Better than I

931
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,560
# You know

932
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,560
# The way

933
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,520
# I've let go

934
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,680
# The need to know why

935
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,640
# I'll take what answers

936
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,960
# You supply

937
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:46,000
# You know better than I #

938
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,240
(Man) # A single voice

939
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,160
# Is joined by multitudes in song

940
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,080
# With every verse

941
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,480
# They're finding harmonies

942
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:04,200
# That rise to Heaven sure and strong

943
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:09,400
# Richer and richer,
the soil on which they thrive

944
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,800
# Higher and higher

945
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,880
# A hymn of what it means
to be alive

946
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,160
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

947
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:26,040
# You've got to leave
a little more than was here

948
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,960
# You may be prideful
of the strides you will make

949
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,600
# But keep one thing clear

950
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,920
# You're just a player
in a much bigger plan

951
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,880
# And still you have
to give it all that you can

952
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,800
# The very measure of your soul
is at stake

953
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:50,720
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

954
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,680
(Woman) # The seasons fly

955
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,760
# A man stands where a boy once stood

956
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,280
# His path unfolds

957
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,960
# And unafraid he walks in service

958
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,680
# Of a greater good

959
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:16,160
(Both) # Deeper and deeper
the lessons he has known

960
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,800
# Over and over

961
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,880
# The message
he is surely being shown

962
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,880
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

963
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,720
# You've got to leave
a little more than was here

964
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,960
# You may be prideful
of the strides you will make

965
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,160
# But keep one thing clear

966
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:44,760
# You're just a player
in a much bigger plan

967
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,640
# And still you have
to give it all that you can

968
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:52,600
# The very measure of your soul
is at stake

969
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:58,080
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

970
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,120
# The very measure of your soul
is at stake

971
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:10,040
# You've got to give
a little more than you take #
