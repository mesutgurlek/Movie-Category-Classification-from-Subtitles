1
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:40,958
Liberty is the happy man's due

2
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:51,499
He enjoys love and skies of blue

3
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,877
But then there are some

4
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,575
Who no worse crimes have done

5
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,646
It's the sad story we tell

6
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:19,832
From a prison cell

7
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,549
What's your problem?

8
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,844
Shut up!

9
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,459
Another day in hard labor spent

10
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,896
Like all the other yesterdays went

11
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,532
With just one horizon in sight

12
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,068
Iron bars morning till night

13
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,842
Ah, pity those who dwell

14
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,418
In a prison cell

15
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,961
In life liberty is all that counts

16
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,998
But man invented the prison cell

17
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,534
Codes and laws, do's and don'ts

18
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,104
Work, offices and houses as well

19
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,773
Don't you agree...
What life can be?

20
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,619
My old friend, life is great

21
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,356
When you're free to be yourself

22
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,859
So come on, let's emancipate

23
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,666
Fresh air is good for the health

24
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,604
Everywhere, if you take a chance,

25
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,673
Everywhere, life is a melody

26
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,005
Everywhere, it's wine and romance

27
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,778
So here's to us two and liberty!

28
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,739
Run for it, Louis!

29
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,816
Forget about me!

30
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,057
Thanks, Emile!

31
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,542
Look there we can see
It's he, it's really he.

32
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:20,012
Let us follow rapidly
This way, it's he

33
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:25,183
The finish line's in sight
Pedal with all your might

34
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:29,226
We're almost home, all right
The finish line's now in sight

35
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,027
Here he comes, yes it's he

36
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,331
He's the victor, the celebrity!

37
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,711
Do they fit?

38
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,971
Like a glove.

39
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,476
Excuse me, sir.

40
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,311
How much?

41
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,713
I'll let you have it...
for 8 francs.

42
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,222
Much too much.

43
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,753
7 francs 50.

44
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,360
7 francs.

45
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,890
Only because it's you.

46
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,194
1 0 francs.

47
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,194
7, 8, 9 and 1 0, thank you.

48
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,134
Good day, sir.

49
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,428
Say, mister...

50
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,901
Got any hankies?

51
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,670
New ones.

52
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,178
I'll go check.

53
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,293
Help! Help!

54
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,041
- I can't breathe!
- What happened?

55
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,210
Which way did he go?

56
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,883
Thataway.

57
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:39,356
Stop, thief! Stop, thief!

58
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,058
- What happened?
- I've been robbed.

59
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,155
Which way'd they go?

60
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,388
Thataway.

61
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,171
You dropped your wallet.

62
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,574
Thank you, it's really kind of you!

63
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,941
Looking for a phonograph?

64
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,810
Our latest model's inside.

65
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,976
It doesn't cost anything to look.
See for yourself.

66
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,239
PALACE OF RECORDS

67
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,627
Not at work?
Don't you know that...

68
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,738
Work is mandatory.

69
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:37,515
Because work means liberty.

70
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:42,781
Work is mandatory

71
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:48,219
Because work means liberty.

72
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,392
Let me out!

73
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:15,644
There are moments when we ponder

74
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:21,116
The love we have yet to know

75
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:27,723
The lover who is yet to show

76
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:34,428
Though silently we hope him yonder

77
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,163
Will I meet this lover some day?

78
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:48,141
At what time, in what way?

79
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:55,913
Come, my lover to be

80
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:01,990
I've loved you since an early date

81
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:08,864
I've loved you,
though your name is a mystery

82
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:14,394
It's you I call, it's you I await

83
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:21,109
Love thrives on hope
And a touch of folly

84
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,409
All it takes is one look

85
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,348
forjoy to start

86
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:34,823
Come and erase my melancholy

87
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:42,195
Come and enchant my heart

88
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:52,134
Come, let me love you
and you will love me

89
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:57,340
Let me read deep in your eyes

90
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,376
Those lines of timeless poetry...

91
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,084
My uncle's coming.

92
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,313
When can I see you?

93
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,734
Can't you watch out?

94
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,929
Put your potatoes elsewhere.

95
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,471
Who asked you?

96
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,370
You don't know who I am.

97
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,137
That will do. That will do!

98
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:10,873
Excuse me, sir...

99
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:15,383
Out of my sight!
I forbid you to address my niece.

100
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,208
...walk in formation.

101
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:17,538
We will give you a job of worth

102
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,487
You who seek an occupation

103
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,146
State your name and date of birth

104
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,656
Leave fingerprint identification

105
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,260
About-face in formation

106
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:35,760
We will give you a job of worth

107
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,506
Where are you going?

108
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,774
I want to leave.

109
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,212
So why'd you come?

110
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,010
Don't know what you want, do you?

111
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,682
Get in line with the others.

112
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,135
Don't move!

113
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,738
- You're still here?
- Let go.

114
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,999
Get going, since you want to leave!

115
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,331
Halt!

116
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,376
Forward, march!

117
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,170
One, two!

118
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,441
It's not my fault, pal.

119
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,249
- Let me...
- I'll get chewed out.

120
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,528
Hold on, you'll see.

121
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,719
Jeanne!

122
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,321
Leave me alone.

123
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:21,114
Come now, child,
you have to be nice to me.

124
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,534
Look, miss, they've gone crazy!

125
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,244
What's wrong?

126
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,581
You're crying.

127
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,092
What's going on?

128
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,394
I don't know.

129
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,797
You don't know.

130
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,228
Did you see anything?

131
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,430
I don't get it.
They all jumped on me.

132
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,332
What d'you have to say?

133
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,340
I couldn't place my part...

134
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,672
So I ran after the belt...

135
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,481
What's your version?

136
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,080
He got in my way. I couldn't work.

137
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,218
What about you?

138
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,083
The three of 'em rushed me.

139
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,621
The three of them?

140
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,950
So you're one of them?

141
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,118
It was those two.

142
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,695
They mixed me up.

143
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,258
- So it's you?
- Me?

144
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,161
Not at all. He started it.

145
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,858
He started it all.

146
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,559
Where'd he go?

147
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,395
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

148
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,482
Go on!

149
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,513
- Hello, old man.
- Hello, my good man.

150
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,714
Can I help you?

151
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,323
Don't you recognize me?

152
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,025
Not at all.

153
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,030
This must be some joke.

154
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,728
Who is this?

155
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,674
Don't remember Emile?

156
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,708
I get it.

157
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,041
You don't want them finding out.
- Enough!

158
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,516
Move along!
There's no time to lose.

159
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,916
Just a minute.

160
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,524
This fellow must have something
to tell me.

161
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,760
This is quite amusing.

162
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,693
Come with me.

163
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,599
I'm in a hurry. I've got to go.

164
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:35,869
There's one more thing
we need to know.

165
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,235
Just a minute, gentlemen.

166
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,373
Isn't this something!

167
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,743
Unheard-of!

168
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,249
What are you doing standing here?

169
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,644
Run along.

170
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,351
Run along, you two.

171
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,354
And you? Will you run along!

172
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,894
Get a move on!

173
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:56,854
How's this open?

174
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,147
What for?

175
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,120
- To return a hankie.
- Want to start a scandal?

176
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,226
- That's not it!
- Listen, Emile!

177
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,629
Stay here.

178
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:16,030
If you don't stop by the count of 3,
I'll blow your brains out.

179
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,408
1... 2... Will you stop?

180
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,072
3.

181
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,142
Come on.

182
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,943
You hurt yourself.
What did you expect?

183
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,388
Keep quiet!

184
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,250
Take it.

185
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,297
Not enough? You want more.

186
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,097
What are you waiting for?

187
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,167
Let this be the last of you.

188
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,683
So here's to us two and liberty!

189
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,830
A good likeness.

190
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,466
What a fool!

191
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,937
Not so loud.

192
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,606
What a fool!

193
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,672
What do you think?

194
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,679
Our friend looks splendid.

195
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,007
Simply splendid!

196
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:40,916
Doesn't he?

197
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,211
How does Louis look to you?

198
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,319
Magnificent!

199
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,914
Do you mean it?

200
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,095
This is an outrage.

201
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,692
While her husband works!

202
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,024
They're not married.

203
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,890
- Not married?
- She's a floozy.

204
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,000
And he's a parvenu.

205
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,633
They're watching us.

206
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,068
I'm so sorry, Louis isn't home yet.

207
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,840
But, dear Madam, we can wait.

208
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,834
It's late.

209
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:11,079
You must forgive him.
He works so hard.

210
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,119
Everywhere, life is a melody

211
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,481
Everywhere, it's wine and romance

212
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,423
So here's to us two and liberty!

213
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,565
Not eating?

214
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,996
- I am.
- How's that?

215
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,664
You sit there staring into space.

216
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:59,615
Like a wound is my desire

217
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:04,390
My sorrow knows no bounds

218
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:12,396
I am so sad I shall expire

219
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:09,920
You clumsy oaf!

220
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,925
Hold this!

221
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,229
You, too?

222
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,899
I didn't get any cake.

223
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,738
I didn't have any cake.
Nothing at all.

224
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,610
I'm so sorry, believe me.

225
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,139
Good help is hard to find.

226
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,582
It won't stain.
It's only sugar and milk.

227
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,169
Don't go.

228
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:58,991
That's enough.

229
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,764
It stopped raining.

230
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:04,965
Go on.

231
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,906
I'm so sorry for what happened.

232
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,213
I'm fed up, fed up!

233
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,114
Listen, darling...

234
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,759
It's all set then. See you tomorrow.

235
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,195
Say, my suit looks good on you.

236
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,907
As if it were made for you. Almost.

237
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,572
But it doesn't beat that!

238
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,173
Hey, you!

239
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,613
Who d'you think you are?

240
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,010
Just you wait!

241
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,217
If I wanted to catch you...

242
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,461
Your behavior tonight...

243
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,461
Spare me!
What d'you want, money?

244
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:05,700
Boor!

245
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,235
Just take it and get off my back!

246
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,600
Did you see that?

247
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,058
So you don't like it?

248
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,787
Wait and see.

249
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,166
My turn!

250
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,431
Watch this.

251
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,610
You win!

252
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,112
Everywhere, if you take a chance,

253
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,081
Everywhere, life is a melody

254
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,186
Everywhere, it's wine and romance

255
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,592
So here's to us two and liberty!

256
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,841
What are you doing here?

257
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,641
Joseph!

258
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,552
How are things?

259
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:36,978
Just fine.

260
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,250
Don't you recognize a friend?

261
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,951
Coming out of there?

262
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,422
A friend's house.

263
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,027
A friend?

264
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,088
Shall I awaken the master?

265
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,459
No need to.

266
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,028
See you soon, I hope...

267
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,829
Sure, but I gotta run.

268
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,471
Where's the fire?

269
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,955
Is that the mistress... leaving?

270
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,223
Yes, sir.

271
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,730
You don't say!

272
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,204
What are you standing there for?

273
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,999
Get inside!

274
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,656
Is this yours?

275
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:59,188
We inaugurate
our new plant tomorrow.

276
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,151
In the first month,

277
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:05,090
it will turn out daily
2000 models like this one.

278
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,224
In the second month, 3000...

279
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:09,262
What is it?

280
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,227
What do you want?

281
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,567
All right.

282
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:19,668
Gentlemen...

283
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,309
We'll continue this later.

284
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,542
He's overstepped all bounds!

285
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,515
Just who is that man?

286
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,211
This can't go on!

287
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,254
What did I tell you?

288
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,626
Will you get off my back?

289
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,260
Know who they are?

290
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,693
Now get out and stay away
from the plant.

291
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,805
What do you want? Money?

292
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:52,964
What then?

293
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,501
It's like this...

294
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,103
I want to stay at the plant.

295
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,512
You can't.
It's the one place I can't have you.

296
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,119
Why do you want to stay?

297
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:08,484
I'm in love.

298
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,449
Who with?

299
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,995
A girl who works at the plant.

300
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,592
Step up, my friend.

301
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,335
Sir...

302
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:01,936
Where's he going?

303
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,938
- I'm right here, sir.
- Not you, him! Step up.

304
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,167
You, too.

305
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,081
Is this your niece?

306
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:15,684
Yes, sir.

307
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,649
This gentleman wishes to marry her.

308
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,654
This gentleman is my friend.

309
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,519
Do you understand?

310
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,498
Perfectly, sir.

311
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,996
The director wants you.

312
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,694
Director?

313
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,396
The big director.

314
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,037
Don't worry about money.

315
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,541
Here's her dowry.

316
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,012
Thank you, sir.

317
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,480
Excuse me.

318
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:02,891
May I?

319
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,793
What is it you want?

320
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,838
Listen. I just wanted to tell you...

321
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,633
Nothing.

322
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,381
Would you like to get married?

323
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,922
Of course she would, sir.

324
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,426
A friend of mine
would like to marry you.

325
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,962
Oh, no, sir.

326
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,465
Only the other day, you said so.

327
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,932
I never said...

328
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:18,541
Please excuse her, sir.
She's feeling a bit intimidated.

329
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,006
- It'll work out.
- I count on you.

330
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:27,441
You needn't worry.

331
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,084
My friend's charming.

332
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:30,510
I know him.

333
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,087
I'm sure you'll change
your mind, miss.

334
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,781
I doubt it, sir.

335
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,722
Come along.

336
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:42,788
It'll work out.

337
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:49,202
I can't understand you.
The chance of a lifetime!

338
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:52,404
Come along, my dear.

339
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,734
Have no fear,
she'll agree to everything.

340
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,703
- Relax. It'll all work out.
- Thanks.

341
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,132
I've seen the girl.

342
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:23,700
I'll tell you later.

343
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:24,840
Isn't that so?

344
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,498
Of course, sir.

345
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,110
My niece can't wait to meet you.

346
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,507
I'm so glad.

347
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,114
If you'd care to come tonight...

348
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,145
Do you mind, sir?

349
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,112
Come tonight...

350
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,780
That was him!

351
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,712
Yes, your fiance.

352
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,900
Having dinner here?

353
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,229
No, I have my date.

354
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,094
And I've got guests.

355
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:30,269
See you tomorrow.

356
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:34,475
Tomorrow's the great day.
I inaugurate my new plant.

357
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,908
And I celebrate my engagement,
I hope.

358
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,411
So everything's fine?

359
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,888
Firmin! Joseph!

360
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,525
Where is everyone?

361
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:11,903
Dear friends!

362
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,541
What's going on here?

363
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,321
You thought of everything!

364
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:12,064
Going already?

365
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,942
Let's do some serious talking.

366
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,738
That's what we came for.

367
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,518
Will that do?

368
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,424
It'll do.

369
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,266
Don't bother!

370
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,742
If we blab, you lose everything.

371
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:57,971
Your status. Your fortune.

372
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,809
That's what you're gonna
share with us.

373
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,245
So that's it! Is that all?

374
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,735
What brings you gentlemen here?

375
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:04,777
How's that?

376
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,772
We received a report
on a housebreaking.

377
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:13,047
Housebreaking! But it's a practical
joke played by my friends.

378
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,052
You came for nothing.

379
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,249
Please forgive them.

380
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,195
But I was tied hand and foot!

381
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,797
I was doing my duty.

382
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,229
As you always do.

383
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,626
- What are you doing here?
- Papers!

384
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,672
Is this a joke?

385
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,034
We're done for.

386
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,646
He took us for a ride.

387
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,283
We can't get out.

388
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:29,509
Trapped like rats!

389
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:27,709
We can't stay here!
Isn't there a combination?

390
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:29,737
Things look bad.

391
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,411
- What is it?
- They'll blow the whistle on me.

392
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:33,445
So what?

393
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:35,641
We have to get ready to run.

394
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,649
- What was that?
- The police are after me.

395
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,387
You idiot! Shut the door, quick!

396
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:51,463
May I help you?

397
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:57,705
It's nothing, sir,
but a man's slipped into the plant.

398
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,306
A man?

399
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:00,532
We're looking for him.

400
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,199
I haven't seen a soul.

401
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,812
But be my guest,
have a good look.

402
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,661
You took the case?

403
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:54,853
The case I put here.

404
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,789
I just saw a guy with it!

405
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:53,819
What are you doing here?

406
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:57,718
We're friends of the director.

407
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,190
Sure!

408
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,851
We came with him tonight.

409
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,596
That's right.

410
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:03,561
Isn't that right?

411
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,228
- He's a pal.
- Aren't you?

412
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,809
Is that all you have to say?

413
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:18,273
If you don't speak up,
they'll arrest us.

414
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,448
But you'll be joining us soon.

415
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,750
Be seeing you, then.

416
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,516
Goodbye.

417
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,687
Here, Inspector, look at this.

418
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,396
We'll look at it later.

419
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,466
Take 'em away!

420
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:20,935
Let's move it!

421
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,463
In our new plant,

422
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:19,761
men will have no other task
other than supervising the machines.

423
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:23,564
The machines will do all the work.

424
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,072
They will manufacture
our phonographs.

425
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:31,677
"Organization and progress,"
that is our motto.

426
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,283
This explains the success
of our earlier factories.

427
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:38,677
It will be the same
under our new enterprise,

428
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,379
which will now start up
before your very eyes.

429
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,959
Won't you cut the garland?

430
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,860
Won't you cut this garland?

431
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,869
Cut it?

432
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,479
Step over here.

433
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:19,589
All hail Progress, child of Science

434
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:25,861
Which extends its hand to the future

435
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:31,469
The golden torch of hope...

436
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,511
It's very simple:
We introduce the materials there.

437
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:41,413
We stand back and then...
There you have it!

438
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:47,514
It guides its sister,
Human Intelligence,

439
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:50,550
Towards the sunlight...

440
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:57,755
My congratulations! It's marvelous!

441
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,194
Ladies and gentlemen...

442
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:07,200
On this solemn occasion,

443
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:10,010
when the Machine has proven

444
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:12,647
that if it can replace
the hand of man,

445
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,512
it cannot replace his brain,

446
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:20,613
allow me first to pay homage
to the brilliant creator

447
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,758
behind the destiny
of this magnificent factory.

448
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:25,726
This man who,

449
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:30,024
despite humble beginnings,
forged a place for himself,

450
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:32,827
and earned the respect
of his contemporaries,

451
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:38,166
whose name is forever
linked with phonograph history,

452
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:40,869
this philanthropist,
this great citizen...

453
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:45,102
This scoundrel! This riffraff!
It's him, all right.

454
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:48,075
- You recognize him?
- You bet I do.

455
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,808
I arrested him.

456
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:53,216
If you want to arrest him again,
you'd better hurry.

457
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,682
He's been tipped off.
He'll make a run for it.

458
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:59,151
All right. Get down there.

459
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:04,125
This historic moment,
when the fiery gaze of the future

460
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:07,526
Iooks back on the dazzling flame
of the present.

461
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,389
I haven't said everything.

462
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:42,402
Gentlemen,
the opening of this factory

463
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:44,603
is my crowning achievement.

464
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,232
I have nothing more to do
among you.

465
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:50,408
I am leaving you.

466
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,810
I hereby make a gift of my factories

467
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:57,008
to all whose
who have worked with me.

468
01:15:57,586 --> 01:16:00,851
The machines will now work
for them.

469
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:07,157
Destiny beckons me to other paths.

470
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:52,570
As a great poet once wrote:

471
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,403
"Let us raise our souls
and our hearts

472
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:58,444
"As the mother raises her child."

473
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:01,572
These words come to mind

474
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,547
on this day when I wish...

475
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:45,617
We can lift our heads high
and declare

476
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:51,432
that the future destiny of mankind

477
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:54,327
seems to bear great promise.

478
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,472
We will soon taste the fruit...

479
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:56,482
When all things around us operate

480
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:01,782
Friends, let us enjoy our idleness

481
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:06,486
Beneath sunny skies
what a sweet fate

482
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:11,489
To laze about and sing like this

483
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:17,467
Let's indulge
in this infinite elation

484
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:23,540
It takes one kiss for it to start

485
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:29,546
My whole being finds exhiliration

486
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:35,954
In the gentle beating of your heart

487
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:44,221
You must never think of marrying

488
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,267
When you were born
to live on the road

489
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:52,429
While awaiting the wisdom
age may bring

490
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:56,668
Think of love as a mere episode

491
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:58,505
That's our fate

492
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,046
Old mate

493
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:06,047
My old friend, the Earth is round

494
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,946
There are women wherever you go

495
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:14,119
When we finally run out of ground

496
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:18,029
That's the time to take it slow

497
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,664
Everywhere, if you take a chance

498
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:24,767
Everywhere, life is a melody

499
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:28,337
Everywhere, it's wine and romance

500
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:33,041
So here's to us two and liberty!
