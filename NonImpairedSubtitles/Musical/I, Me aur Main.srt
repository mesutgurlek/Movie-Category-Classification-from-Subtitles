You are strong.

00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:25,268
You are such an idiot.
- A sexy idiot.

72
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,734
My idiot.

73
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:37,281
All the contracts are ready, right?

00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,408
Pertect. l'm going to go
over each one of them.

75

Yes.

76
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,684
Hmm.

77
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:48,283
And the documents from the
Bangalore office? Yeah. Okay.

78
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:49,858
Hi.
- Just a second.

79
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:51,757
lshaan, where is your wallet?

80
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:53,754
Milkman's dues.

81
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:55,621
Why should l pay him?

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,932
l don't even drink milk.

83
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,460
ln fact, l even have my coffee black.

84
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:03,237
Listen, l'll just call you back.

85
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:05,005
lshaan, please.

86
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:06,541
l mean it.

87
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:09,002
How can you be so cheap?

88
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,448
l make your breakfast everyday.

89
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:13,712
And your black coffee
as well, by the way.

90
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:16,650
Sweetheart, l am so good that..

91
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:20,618
..not just you, any girl l
know would do anything for me.

92
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,592
Bye.

93
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:24,759
Sir.

94
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,562
Sister-in-law, shall l come tomorrow?.

95
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,796
What sister-in-law?.!
Which sister-in-law?.!

96
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,771
l am no one's sister-in-law, okay?

97
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:36,303
Sister-in-law!

98
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,804
Hi, Sweetheart.
- Good morning, sir.

99
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:55,921
Good morning, sir.
- Hi. - Your bag? - Good morning.

100
00:08:58,295 --> 00:08:58,929
ls she in?

101
00:08:58,929 --> 00:08:59,987
Yeah, she is just waiting.

102
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:01,764
Good. Good. Good.

103
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,962
Hey Beena.

104
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:08,469
What's up?

105
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:14,934
Come on, lshaan. This is no
time to walk in. You are late.

106
00:09:15,246 --> 00:09:16,304
Of course not.

107
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,381
Our meeting is scheduled for
10:30am and its only 10:15am.

108
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:21,252
Oh, one second.

109
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:23,516
You don't have the
confidence to work without me.

110
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:27,255
Anyway, this is a music company
and not a multinational bank..

111
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:29,391
..where l've to land up
early in the mornings.

112
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:30,290
Okay?

113
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,692
So, don't even expect that.

114
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:34,254
l don't expect anything from you.

115
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:35,730
You are not worthy of it.

116
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,865
Look, in spite of you being with them..

117
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:44,874
..this company has hired me on a
higher salary with more perks.

118
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:47,737
So that l can put you in your place.

119
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,812
A fair chance has to be given, right?

120
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:52,748
Can you just help me with this, please?

121
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:08,328
lshaan, the sooner you know
your position, the better.

122
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:18,365
Look baby, without me this
company's and your state..

123
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,701
..will be same as a ship without a
captain in the middle of the sea.

124
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,313
You'll be caught seesawing like this.

125
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:26,317
With a SOS board around your neck.

126
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,306
You understand?

127
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:29,309
We'll see.

128
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,513
And what shit are we
listening to, today?

129
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:37,051
What's in store for
today's crappy audition list?

130
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:39,328
Here are some photographs.

131
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:40,420
Like this one.

132
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:42,565
She can modulate
really well and l like..

133
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,897
We aren't looking for a
model for a fairness cream.

134
00:10:46,003 --> 00:10:47,698
Auditions, please.

135
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:52,003
And do you know what he told me?

136
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:54,811
''Why should l pay him? ln fact,
l even have my coffee black.''

137
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:56,804
Can you believe it?

138
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,346
''l even have my coffee black.''

139
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:01,910
l was like.. - Just leave him,
Anushka. You deserve much better.

140
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,056
Yeah, l know. Sometimes
l really feel l should..

141
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,724
But l love him.

142
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:17,827
Oh he's..

143
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,733
Fine then, suffer.

144
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:25,832
Anyway, hows aunt? l
haven't met her since ages.

145
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:27,032
She's good.

146
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:29,412
l'm going to Pune
next week. Come with me.

147
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:31,544
No.

148
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:33,607
l'll go with lshaan.

149
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,614
To talk about our marriage..

150
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,321
Just grow up, girl!

151
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:42,650
Shivs. Come on.

152
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:44,723
How can you be so negative about him?

153
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:45,961
You are his sister.

154
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,396
l know him well because l am his sister.

155
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:50,326
And l am not negative.

156
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:54,769
All l know is that he is not
at all prepared for marriage.

157
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:58,364
You know Shivani, all
guys are commitment phobic.

158
00:11:58,575 --> 00:11:59,507
All of them.

159
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:02,876
But after marriage
everything figures itself out.

160
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,538
And.. lshaan too will change.

161
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:09,880
Hey, nice bag.

162
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:12,513
Beautiful.

163
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:15,288
Really?
- Yeah. - Me or the bag?

164
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:21,990
l spoke about you yesterday..

165

Please, baby?

Then we can relax and talk.

Someone who wants to talk
to me about my feelings.

And perhaps someday make a life with me.

294

What's wrong with it, lshaan?

295

331
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:47,862
lt's his fifth birthday.

332
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:49,660
And he loves live pertormances.

333
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,360
You are insulting a talent, Beena.

334
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:52,891
For a dog's birthday party?

335
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:56,401
l'm giving your ''Find'' a chance.

336
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:57,938
lt's going to be a big party.

337
00:21:57,974 --> 00:21:58,941
A lot of dogs with be there..

338
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:00,340
To wag their tails.

339
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,611
And yes, you addressed me as ''baby''.

340
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:06,882
l can sue you for that.

341
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:08,011
Just saying.

342
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:11,946
What!

343
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:16,687
Hey, Rishi, give me. Give it to me.

344
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:19,393
Mom's here.

345
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,497
Good that Anushka dumped you.

346
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,493
Rishi, if you are done eating, you
can go inside and wash your hands.

347
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:29,767
You are done.
- Okay, Mom.

348
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:35,539
Shivani, you know, you have
started behaving just like mom.

349
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:36,442
And have started
looking like her as well.

350
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,639
Absolutely. Ditto copy.

351
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,379
Actually, it's my fault that
l introduced you to Anushka.

352
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:47,448
l lost our friendship
because of your deeds.

353
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,646
Deeds?!

354
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:52,550
You know..

355
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:55,456
Anushka deserves much better.

356
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:59,927
Someone who is a grown up and
doesn't pass okra under the table.

357
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,636
Shall l remind you that you
stopped your law practice five years ago?

358
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,469
And what do you do?

359
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,637
You fill this world with cheap music.

360
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:12,040
Wow lshaan, so impressive.

361
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:12,976
How d..

362
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:17,546
And anyway, Anushka didn't dump me.

363
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,277
lt's just a small misunderstanding.

364
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:20,354
That's all.

365
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,640
She changed the lock.

366
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:40,769
You changed the lock!

367
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,674
How d..

368
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,649
Did you call Anushka?

369
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:52,515
She changed the lock, man.

370
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:53,647
Oh really?

371
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:58,487
Do you love her?

372
00:23:58,528 --> 00:23:59,495
Huh?

373
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:00,789
Oh, shit!

374
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:03,359
l was on level 5. Did
you see what you just did?

375
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:06,266
lshaan, Do. You. Love. Her?

376
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:07,965
We looked good together.

377
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:09,565
We were good together.

378
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,739
l wonder why she
wants to ruin everything.

379
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,402
She wants to ruin it?

380
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,275
Have you seen the condition l'm in?

381
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:17,344
l'm on your sofa.

382
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:18,746
l don't have a toothbrush.

383
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:19,976
Pizza's over.

384
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,781
And your beer isn't cold either.

385
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:23,911
lshaan, this situation
is a little serious.

386
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:27,320
You'll have to reverse it.
And this is what you do.

387
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,685
This is what you are
good at. Come on, man.

388
00:24:29,726 --> 00:24:31,353
You'll have to do something.

389
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,638
Hey Anushka, it's me, Tarun.

390
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,976
Please open the door.

391
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:58,543
l called. You didn't answer it.

392
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:10,960
Shoes. Shoes. Clothes.
Clothes. DVDs. Protein powders.

393
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:14,959
And your 42 inch life
support system is also packed.

394
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,965
And my lazy boy?

395
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,797
That is all that belongs to you, right?

396
00:25:18,942 --> 00:25:21,001
Take it. l hate it anyway.

397
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:22,637
Okay?

398
00:25:33,356 --> 00:25:34,414
Keep it.

399
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:43,957
So sir, are you staying
alone for the first time?

400
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:45,894
Total freedom.

401
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:48,730
No one to nag you. No one to talk to.

402
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:51,831
So l'll get the agreement
ready and send it to your office.

403
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,672
Okay? Bye.

404
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:07,456
Who's the best? Who's the best.

405
00:26:07,824 --> 00:26:09,416
lshaan! lshaan! lshaan!

406
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:13,560
So..

407
00:26:15,932 --> 00:26:17,399
You are my new neighbor.

408
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:28,534
lshaan Sabharwal.

409
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,974
Music producer. CMC records.

410
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:32,803
Gauri Dandekar.

411
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:35,409
Stylist and.. part time electrician.

412
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:36,983
Part time electrician?

413
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:39,986
Yeah. The wiring of
this building is bad.

414
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,554
lf fuse ever blows out,
don't hesitate to call me.

415
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:45,392
Don't worry. l won't charge you.

416
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:47,889
lt's not my profession. lt's my passion.

417
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:51,058
Oh hey..

418
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:52,798
Welcome to the building.

419
00:26:55,939 --> 00:26:56,803
What is this for?

420
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,431
Keeps the noise out.

421
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:09,774
Are you going to make me do a
lifetime's exercise in a day?

422
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:11,582
This problem is being caused by Anushka.

423
00:27:11,621 --> 00:27:13,851
That movie is out of the theatre, boss.

424
00:27:14,524 --> 00:27:17,254
Yes. Because l've
shut down that theatre.

425
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,019
How long should l run after her?

426
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,535
By the way, Your neighbor,
what's her name?

427
00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:30,003
Gauri.
- Yes. Hows she?

428
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,568
She's average.

429
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:34,735
Oh really? - Yes. - Then
what are those earplugs for?

430
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:37,411
l don't know. She must be
doing acrobatics at night.

431
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:39,542
Who cares?

432
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:56,354
What the..

433
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,294
Hello! What's happening?

434
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,307
Hello! Can't you hear me?

435
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:09,672
Hey, l'm asking you guys.

436
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:11,540
What are you guys doing?

437
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:13,247
What's happening?

438
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:16,851
They can't hear you.

439
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:17,853
Simple physics.

440
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:20,947
That drill's volume is
much louder than your voice.

441
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:23,282
What the..

442
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:29,362
Hey! Whoa! Where are you going?

443
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,593
Are you going to stop them?

444
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:31,827
What's so funny?

445
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:33,360
Nothing.

446
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,993
You know this is the
problem with people.

447
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,269
l mean when these guys don't work,
people cause a commotion.

448
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:41,635
And when these guys work,
people aren't happy.

449
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:44,971
Come on, it's not like they
enjoy working all night long.

450
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,914
They are not partying, right?

451
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,442
That's not my problem.

452
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:51,382
What an attitude!

453
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:52,681
''lt's not my problem.''

454
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:56,052
lf l knew the broker was going
to get such a grumpy neighbor..

455
00:28:56,392 --> 00:28:57,825
..then l would have shifted out of here.

456
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:00,587
You called me grumpy?

457
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:02,556
You called me grumpy?

458
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,333
There's no one else here
other than me and you.

459
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:11,673
So it's obvious, isn't it,
that l called you grumpy.

460
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,001
Don't worry.

461
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,972
l'm going to call you all
kinds of things in the future.

462
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:22,541
And you know what, slowly
you'll start to like my blabbering.

463
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:26,744
Like, right now, l'm blabbering..

464
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:29,791
..and you can't even
hear the noise outside.

465
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:36,354
You know what, just use
the earplugs and go to sleep.

466
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,665
Oh, by the way..

467
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:42,561
Nice boxers.

468
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,477
Yeah?

469
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:02,389
lshu..

470
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,687
How are you?

471
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:04,986
l hope you're fine.

472
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:05,959
Mom? What are you doing here?

473
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:07,895
Your sister told your dad everything.

474
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:09,998
He even came to know about Anushka.

475
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:11,522
No one tells me anything.

476
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:13,728
But good that you left that girl.

477
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,498
l never liked her.

478
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:18,836
What's wrong, lshu? You look unwell.

479
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:19,864
l hope you are feeling fine.

480
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:20,967
Mom, l..
- Yes?

481
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,742
Don't worry. Now that l'm here,
everything will be fine.

482
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:25,312
Come on, move aside now.

483
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:26,645
Mom..

484
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,317
Your dad must be up by now.

485
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:32,919
He must be wondering where l am.

486
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:34,380
You didn't tell dad?

487
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:35,856
Your favorite bread.

488
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,727
Mom, you got this plate
and cup from home, from Pune?

489
00:30:40,763 --> 00:30:44,529
Then what. l got all the
plates and cutlery with me.

490
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:48,363
lshu, what's this? There's no water.

491
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:50,429
ls this building like
those places where..

492
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,031
..there is water only
at a particular time.

493
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:54,070
Oh, no. l should've
brought a bucket as well.

494
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,873
Kitchenware is available in Mumbai.

495
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:56,936
You know that, don't you?

496
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,105
At double the cost.

497
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,881
Anyway your dad is
staying alone in Pune.

498
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,874
How many plates will he use?

499
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:06,881
lf he could have his way, he would
never let me out of the kitchen.

500
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:08,356
After all, l'm just his servant.

501
00:31:08,391 --> 00:31:09,722
Mom, what are you saying?

502
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,623
Think before you speak.

503
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,555
Ever since your dad has retired..

504
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:14,624
..he has made my life miserable.

505
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:16,831
lt's either a pain in the
head or a pain in the neck.

506
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,695
Sometimes he wants to have
fritters and sometimes it's porridge.

507
00:31:19,735 --> 00:31:22,602
lf your dad can retire
then why can't l? - Mom..

508
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:24,328
Let your dad go to hell.

509
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:25,533
Now l'm not going to move from here.

510
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:26,906
From where?

511
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,599
From here.

512
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,313
From Mumbai. From your flat.

513
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:32,474
And dad?
- l've left him.

514
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,447
What!

515
00:31:33,816 --> 00:31:35,374
Oh no! What have you done!

516
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:36,982
You dropped everything.

517
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:41,713
See, the melamine plates
we get in Pune are so good!

518
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:42,949
Unbreakable.

519
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,388
Look, lshu, you are all grown up now.

520
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:52,995
You can understand.

521
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:56,465
l will not go back to your dad in Pune.

522
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:59,033
l'll stay here, with you.

523
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,759
So you can sing.

524
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,832
Anything else?

525
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:30,802
Excuse me?

526
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:36,309
Fashion sense. Style. Sex appeal.

527
00:32:36,512 --> 00:32:38,503
All these are necessary
to become a hit singer.

528
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:40,939
Right?

529
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:43,551
l'm just a singer.

530
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:45,578
l don't know anything else.

531
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:47,721
l don't understand.

532
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:53,056
Shona.

533
00:32:53,963 --> 00:32:54,930
Yes.

534
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:56,363
Big star.

535
00:32:56,732 --> 00:32:57,596
l know.

536
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:58,998
Do you listen to her music?

537
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:01,636
Yes.
- She also didn't know anything before.

538
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,829
l made her a big star.

539
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,800
Do you know how?.

540
00:33:10,012 --> 00:33:16,349
Amala, do you want to see
your poster in a music store?

541
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:20,653
Your billboard at every crossing?

542
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,355
Do you want people to buy your music?

543
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:26,324
Yes.

544
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:28,830
Good. Then from now on, stop thinking.

545
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:31,465
l'll do the thinking for you.

546
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,529
Are you with me?

547
00:33:35,671 --> 00:33:36,968
Are you with me?

548
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,034
Yes.

549
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,842
Yes.

550
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:42,844
Good.

551
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,410
Sir..

552
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:47,444
Keep it. lt's yours.

553
00:33:56,592 --> 00:34:00,790
Farhad. What is this ''Save the
tiger'' donkey doing with Anushka?

554
00:34:00,863 --> 00:34:03,832
Agastya? He came with her.

555
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:06,325
You okay?

556
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:07,269
Yeah.

557
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:09,464
Last week he caught four
tiger poachers, all by himself.

558
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,934
lndian Rambo, man.

559
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:12,305
Too good.

560
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:14,841
Here, have a drink.
- Thanks.

561
00:34:15,277 --> 00:34:16,676
lt will ease the heartache.

562
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,378
Cheers.

563
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,382
Bastard. He's
encroaching on my territory.

564
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:29,516
Last week you said that
it's all over for you.

565
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:30,684
And now you are feeling jealous.

566
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:31,750
Don't think.

567
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,556
Anyway you are not used to it.

568
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:35,689
l'm going there. Hold this.
- lshaan.

569
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:37,694
Forget it. lshaan.

570
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,028
Really, l swear.

571
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:42,301
Hi, lshaan.

572
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,835
You remember Agastya, right?

573
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,569
Can l talk to you?
- Yeah.

574
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:53,612
lshaan..
- What is Agastya doing here?

575
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,715
l thought you are
through with the tiger project.

576
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:59,546
Look, l volunteer with his organization.

577
00:34:59,588 --> 00:35:00,782
And l do legal work. You know that.

578
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:04,657
Since when? What else? Have you
turn into a vegetarian as well?

579
00:35:06,295 --> 00:35:07,489
Actually, yes.

580
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:11,765
You inviting him for my
friend's party, what does that mean?

581
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:13,860
Look, Farhad is also my friend, lshaan.

582
00:35:14,003 --> 00:35:15,800
And l don't mean anything by it.

583
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:18,274
l mean l was going to a
party to l brought him with me.

584
00:35:18,274 --> 00:35:19,298
That's all. Just a friend.

585
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:20,000
Friend?

586
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:23,507
Really? Miss. Meerut? That's so modern.

587
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,005
So how does he pertorm?

588
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:27,975
Better than me?

589
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:30,545
l can't talk to you.

590
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,712
You are such a child!

591
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,058
Anushka, shall we?

592
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:39,951
Yeah, l think l'm done here.

593
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,654
Let's go.

594
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:56,436
What are we doing here?

595
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:59,042
We are men, Tarun. Men.

596
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:01,350
We are marking our territory.

597
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,282
Oh really?

598
00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:03,916
Even dogs do that, don't they?

599
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:06,778
They pee under a tree
and mark their territory.

600
00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:08,518
What a life l have!

601
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:11,485
Look! That lying..

602
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,461
No, lshaan, let it be. Let's go.

603
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:54,766
Be careful, dear.

604
00:36:57,306 --> 00:36:58,432
What's happening, Mom?

605
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:00,836
lshu, you know that serial..

606
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,570
The serial, ''Stars and
the moon, for you''..

607
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:05,273
''Dark nights for me''.
- Yes. - Today is its final episode.

608
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:09,011
Yes, so l thought we'll have
a serial party in our house.

609
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:10,479
l've even made 'Samosas' (snacks).

610
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,884
You didn't have a cable connection.

611
00:37:11,987 --> 00:37:14,251
Look at Gauri, she's
getting the cable down.

612
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,855
She is pulling a connection
from the junction, for me.

613
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,756
Mom! Mom, what's wrong with you?

614
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:20,455
You are stealing a cable connection!
- No! No! No!

615
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:21,997
They will throw me out
of the flat in two days!

616
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:23,760
l'm not stealing it,
son. lt's just for today.

617
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:26,858
You don't have to do this.

618
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,336
lt's okay.

619
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,372
No, it's not okay. Please..

620
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:37,274
Gauri.
- Gauri.

621
00:37:40,783 --> 00:37:41,875
l'll handle it.

622
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,384
Let men do the manly jobs.

623
00:37:43,485 --> 00:37:46,613
Okay.
- Okay, Mr. Man.

624
00:37:49,491 --> 00:37:51,789
Do you always yell at aunt
in this manner? - Sorry?

625
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:54,759
Not to me, say it to aunt. ''Sorry.''

626
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:59,834
Oh, by the way, l like your style.

627
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:01,994
lt was a nice act,
you forgetting my name.

628
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:06,969
''Mr. Man.'' ''The act
for forgetting my name.''

629
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,375
Early morning blabbering.

630
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:11,908
Didn't even let me have coffee.

631
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:13,642
Whose house is it, huh?

632
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:18,914
Hello?

633
00:38:19,822 --> 00:38:22,757
Yes? Do you want something?

634
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:25,757
The ladder. Sorry, l kept it inside.

635
00:38:26,662 --> 00:38:27,924
Should l get it? -The ladder?

636
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:30,961
Please. What will l do with it?

637
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:32,862
lt's hardly 10 feet.

638
00:38:32,968 --> 00:38:34,595
l jump from a height
of 10 feet every day.

639
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:39,405
So, why did you call me?
- l brought the cable down.

640
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,805
Wow! Ten out of ten!

641
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,691
What happened?
- Nothing.

642
00:39:02,398 --> 00:39:04,389
Ouch!

643
00:39:11,907 --> 00:39:14,467
''Move a little, shake a little.''

644
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,740
''Come into my arms.''

645
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:22,314
''Don't you wanna know, what's
the secret hiding in my eyes?''

646
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,313
''What are you thinking about?''

647
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:34,556
lshaan, change her track.

648
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,254
How will this poor girl sing this?

649
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:37,557
lt's just not her.

650
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,862
l'll do something.

651
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,771
lshaan..

652
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:46,036
Amala..

653
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:47,937
Why are you so nervous?

654
00:39:47,976 --> 00:39:49,637
lshaan, l can't do it. Please.

655
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,643
Amala, your voice is good.

656
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:52,781
You just need to modulate a little.

657
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:53,679
l can't do it.

658
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:55,775
lshaan, l'm.. l'm just a flop..

659
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:58,579
Listen, just imagine..

660
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:00,945
That this is the only
chance you have to sing.

661
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:04,517
You'll never get such a chance again.

662
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,554
This is your only chance.

663
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:08,527
This is it.

664
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,289
You got it? You will do it?

665
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,391
Yes.
- Good. Go for it.

666
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:20,298
Synthesize a little
and add some more beats.

667
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:23,604
Then it will be same as the
song Shona sang last time.

668
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:25,306
That ''Life..'' song.

669
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:30,580
That was last year's best track.

670
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:32,317
And l had cracked it.

671
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,922
That's true. Somehow your
decisions have always worked.

672
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,788
Fine then. Let's begin.

673
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,530
Awesome.
- Was it?

674
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:48,399
Yes.
- Oh, my God.

675
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:49,728
Yeah.

676
00:40:49,872 --> 00:40:51,464
Yes, Tarun.
- Who is this?

677
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,868
Behave yourself.

678
00:40:52,941 --> 00:40:53,737
Can you hear me?

679
00:40:53,776 --> 00:40:55,038
Hey!
- Hey! How are you?

680
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,578
Good to see you.
- That's for you.

681
00:40:56,578 --> 00:40:57,567
Thank you so much.

682
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,442
Good. Yeah, everybody is inside.

683
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:00,641
Oh, are they?
- Yeah. - Good.

684
00:41:00,682 --> 00:41:02,479
Hey! Hi!
- How are you? - How are you?

685
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:05,613
Are you guarding the door?

686
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:08,423
Join us, we don't bite.

687
00:41:08,457 --> 00:41:09,651
l mean all the time.

688
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:11,416
Only sometimes.

689
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:15,693
Guys. This is my neighbor, lshaan.

690
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:17,631
Hi.
- Hi. - These are my friends Not again!

691
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:18,963
Make yourself comfortable.
- Yeah.

692
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:21,435
Hey, Gauri. You got to hear this.
- Yeah?

693
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:24,035
He just dated a random guy off the net.

694
00:41:24,072 --> 00:41:26,040
No way!
- Really.

695
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,007
That's aunt Sakina from the
fourth floor, when she was two.

696
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:38,509
And l have cut all these
photographs from magazines.

697
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:41,984
What?
- They are my photographs, stupid.

698
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:44,049
Anyway. That's my dad.

699
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:46,526
His rum chicken is to die for.

700
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:48,819
Ex-boyfriend.

701
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,329
Another ex.

702
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:53,460
And before you say anything, let me
tell you there were only two exes.

703
00:41:53,502 --> 00:41:54,730
So, shut up.
- Yeah!

704
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,032
That's my best friend.

705
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:59,335
Whom l have not spoken to in ten years.

706
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:00,875
My assistant.

707
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,672
Gauri, your turn.

708
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:05,002
Hold on. Coming. Come on.

709
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:07,574
Come on, Gauri. Ready to lose?

710
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:09,876
Hey, lshaan.
- Hi.

711
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:11,442
Hows it going?
- Good. Good. Good.

712
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:13,818
Drinks?
- No! No! No! - Whiskey on the rocks.

713
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:14,947
Yeah!

714
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,758
Cheater! l won't play with you.

715
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,824
Third knockout!

716
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:20,327
ls there anyone who can defeat me?

717
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:22,523
There is. This handsome.

718
00:42:23,298 --> 00:42:24,526
l don't play with girls.

719
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:25,726
Why, Mr. Man?

720
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:28,900
Oh really!

721
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:31,997
Oh!

722
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,907
Come on.
- He's gone. Let's go.

723
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,374
Come on, Gauri.

724
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:37,639
Come on. Come on, you can do it.

725
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:38,771
Oh, my God.
- Come on.

726
00:42:38,814 --> 00:42:39,803
Come on, lshaan. Come on. Come on.

727
00:42:39,982 --> 00:42:42,007
Go for it, lshaan. Go. Go.

728
00:42:42,384 --> 00:42:44,784
Go! Go! Go!
- Oh God!

729
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,845
Hey, go for it. -Oh, no!
- That's it. Yes.

730
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:48,948
You can do it.
- l am trying.

731
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:50,790
Come on!
- Come on! - Oh God!

732
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:51,952
Watch out! Come on!
- Go! Go, lshaan!

733
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:52,983
Yes, lshaan! Go! Go! Go!

00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:57,833
Go! Go! lshaan, go! lshaan, go!

735
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:58,993
lshaan! lshaan!

736
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:13,503
She was cheating! Was cheating.
- Okay, time for dinner!

737
00:43:22,357 --> 00:43:24,291
Thank you so much for coming.
- Thank you.

738
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,884
Bye, loser.
- Cheater!

739
00:43:27,696 --> 00:43:29,664
Hey.
- So cheating, huh?

740
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:31,826
l like to win.

741
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:32,959
Rematch?
- Why?

742
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,468
Want to get thrashed again?

743
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,435
Who's the best? Who's the best?

744
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,705
lt's Gauri. Gauri. Gauri.

745
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:43,777
Good night. -Thanks for coming.

746
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:01,894
So?

747
00:44:02,698 --> 00:44:03,960
What do you want to do?

748
00:44:06,335 --> 00:44:09,532
Agastya, you're my friend. You tell me.

749
00:44:10,906 --> 00:44:13,340
l can't understand anything.
l'm confused.

750
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:16,010
Anushka, there's nothing to understand.

751
00:44:16,345 --> 00:44:17,369
Just tell him.

752
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:18,674
Tell him.

753
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,339
l should tell him?

754
00:44:20,382 --> 00:44:21,576
Excuse me, sir.

755
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,480
Thank you.

756
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:27,289
What should l tell him?

757
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,416
That, ''l know you
don't want to marry me.''

758
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:32,055
''You don't want children.
But guess what?''

759
00:44:32,561 --> 00:44:33,994
''l'm pregnant.''

760
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:37,490
''We are going to have a child.''

761
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,630
Anushka, you know that
he has a right to know.

762
00:44:42,371 --> 00:44:43,861
He has no right.

763
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,898
lt's over between us.

764
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:51,437
He.. He doesn't even love me.

765
00:44:52,848 --> 00:44:56,511
Anushka, he deserves to know.

766
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,719
Tell him. Give him one last chance.

767
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,721
He does.

768
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:13,291
Okay.

769
00:45:15,536 --> 00:45:17,766
Oh, my God. Anushka.

770
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:21,607
Did you.. Did you tell lshaan?

771
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:25,406
No. Not yet.

772
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:27,248
You know him.

773
00:45:27,248 --> 00:45:28,772
l wonder how he will react.

774
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:30,545
What do you mean by how will he react?

775
00:45:30,718 --> 00:45:33,380
lt's his child. He'll
have to act responsible.

776
00:45:33,755 --> 00:45:35,245
You must tell him.

777
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:41,587
Careful, Ms. Beena.

778
00:45:42,664 --> 00:45:44,461
Fasten your seatbelt.

779
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:48,594
Otherwise, chances are that what
you'll hear will blow you away.

780
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:52,865
Wow. l'm really excited!

781
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:55,298
Clap. Clap.

782
00:45:55,777 --> 00:45:56,766
Amala.

783
00:45:57,779 --> 00:46:00,680
''Look at the way l move my body.''

784
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:02,740
''Look at the way l groove.''

785
00:46:03,418 --> 00:46:04,851
''This is intoxicating.''

786
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:08,720
''ln this inebriety,
everybody let your body loose.''

787
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:11,589
''Move a little, shake a little.''

788
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:13,821
''Come into my arms.''

789
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:19,355
''Don't you wanna know, what's
the secret hiding in my eyes?''

790
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,333
''What are you thinking about?''

791
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,361
''Expunge this distance.''

792
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:27,236
''Don't let this night go waste.''

793
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:30,469
''Don't lose this moment.''

794
00:46:31,346 --> 00:46:34,282
''Look at the way l move my body.''

795
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:36,341
''Look at the way l groove.''

796
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:38,480
''This is intoxicating.''

797
00:46:41,689 --> 00:46:43,714
l don't think she has a promising voice.

798
00:46:53,668 --> 00:46:54,566
So?

799
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:57,897
l definitely cannot
sign on Amala's contract.

800
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,535
You'll have to.

801
00:47:08,316 --> 00:47:09,010
Yes, Shivani.

802
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,678
Excuse me. - lshaan, why do you
always take so long to answer?

803
00:47:11,919 --> 00:47:12,943
Can't speak now.

804
00:47:12,987 --> 00:47:14,511
Dinner at my place. Tonight.

805
00:47:14,555 --> 00:47:15,852
Yeah, okay. Dinner. Fine.

806
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:31,668
Thank you.

807
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:34,832
Here you go.

808
00:47:36,577 --> 00:47:38,875
You must've said thank you
and l must not have heard you.

809
00:47:38,913 --> 00:47:39,845
So, you're welcome.

810
00:47:40,882 --> 00:47:42,713
Thank you. Sorry.

811
00:47:43,684 --> 00:47:46,482
So many?
- There's a scientific logic behind it.

812
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:48,284
See, l want to have three shots.

813
00:47:48,556 --> 00:47:50,717
So, for company sake you'll
have three pegs of whiskey.

814
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:53,256
But because you are a man..

815
00:47:53,394 --> 00:47:55,362
lf you would've gone to get them,
you would've gone thrice.

816
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:57,656
l've done it in one go.

817
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,291
Simple female logic.

818
00:48:00,668 --> 00:48:02,363
All you do is give
everyone a piece of your mind.

819
00:48:05,373 --> 00:48:06,567
What's wrong with you?

820
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:08,298
Don't be such a cry baby.

821
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:09,400
Have a drink.

822
00:48:13,347 --> 00:48:15,815
You know what, you should
have confidence in yourself.

823
00:48:16,818 --> 00:48:17,842
Confidence.

824
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:29,260
What?! She's hot.

825
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,689
To understand beauty you need to see it.

826
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:32,756
Look at her.

827
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:40,707
So, won't you flirt with her?

828
00:48:40,975 --> 00:48:42,499
No. Not my type.

829
00:48:42,643 --> 00:48:46,010
So you won't mind if l
flirt with her, right?

830
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:47,545
What!

831
00:48:49,383 --> 00:48:51,874
Whoa. Wow.

832
00:49:01,362 --> 00:49:02,420
Hi.

833
00:49:07,602 --> 00:49:08,762
You know what?

834
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:10,498
My friend there..
- Yeah?

835
00:49:10,538 --> 00:49:11,937
He thinks you're really hot.

836
00:49:13,274 --> 00:49:14,263
Check him out.

837
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,206
Hi!

838
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:22,617
Yeah, Shivs?

839
00:49:22,617 --> 00:49:23,743
lshaan, where are you?

840
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:25,341
You were going tojoin us
for dinner, weren't you?

841
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:28,479
Actually, Shivs..
- Listen. Anushka is also here.

842
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:30,286
And she wants to talk to you.

843
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:31,617
Sojust come here.

844
00:49:31,926 --> 00:49:33,223
Now!

845
00:49:38,332 --> 00:49:39,959
She so wants me back.

846
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,947
Finally!

847
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:56,745
What took you so long?!
- Hi! Your sister?

848
00:49:57,251 --> 00:50:00,778
Nice to meet you. Nice house.

849
00:50:02,523 --> 00:50:03,683
Oh hey.

850
00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:04,656
Anushka, don't rush him.

851
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:05,781
Hi, guys.

852
00:50:05,826 --> 00:50:08,260

- Hi.

853
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,263
Do you want a drink?

854
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,730
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

855
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:12,330
Beautiful wall.

856
00:50:12,366 --> 00:50:13,390
Hey, lshaan.

Oh, my God, Paris. lshaan..

00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,531
l've always wanted to go.

859
00:50:17,738 --> 00:50:19,831
Gauri, look, what a beautiful wall.

860
00:50:19,874 --> 00:50:21,307

- Come on.

861
00:50:21,876 --> 00:50:23,400
Okay, we start from here.
- Cheers.

862
00:50:23,444 --> 00:50:25,378
Thanks.
- How do we go to Paris from here?

863
00:50:25,413 --> 00:50:25,970
See this!

864
00:50:27,281 --> 00:50:30,444
Straight down and then take a
turn left.. - Left and then right.

865
00:50:30,484 --> 00:50:31,610
What..
- Hey, we meet here.

866
00:50:33,521 --> 00:50:34,647
Gauri..

867
00:50:34,689 --> 00:50:36,384
You're so cute.
- Me?

868
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:39,722
Okay, now we start again.

869
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,727
Good idea.
- Okay. - Are you coming with me?

870
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:42,752
Now from Paris we go back to London.
- Let's go.

871
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,231
And from London to New York.

872
00:50:44,231 --> 00:50:45,960
No, wait. Let me handle it.
- Then? Go back, back, back..

873
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:47,291
lshaan.

874
00:50:47,802 --> 00:50:50,270
Just a minute, please.
- You okay?

875
00:50:51,238 --> 00:50:55,265
l'll see you.
- Yeah. Yeah. Go. Go!

876
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:04,448
Shivani will take care of the situation.

877
00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:05,349
She knows her brother well.

878
00:51:05,386 --> 00:51:07,377
lshaan, Anushka wants to talk to you.

879
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:08,649
About Agastya and herself?

880
00:51:09,624 --> 00:51:11,785
Shivs, you continue
with your friendship.

881
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:13,759
l'm done with her.

882
00:51:15,196 --> 00:51:17,494
And tell her l've forgiven her.

883
00:51:17,632 --> 00:51:21,466
And if she is jealous to
see me happy.. l don't care.

884
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:23,331
Please lshaan, what are you saying..

885
00:51:23,504 --> 00:51:25,597
l'm not used to sulking.

886
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,229
Just look at her.

887
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:30,575
lshaan.
- Shivs, she's really boring.

888
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:31,635
As boring as ever.

889
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:33,442
Listen, Anushka..
- lshaan..

890
00:51:33,581 --> 00:51:35,344
lshaan.. Sorry. Brother-sister talk.

891
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,943
Yeah. - l'll go and
entertain your other friends.

892
00:51:37,985 --> 00:51:39,220
Yeah. l'll come with you.

893
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,221
But lshaan..
- Really? - Yeah. Yeah.

894
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:41,518
Come. Come.
- lshaan, l'm very hungry.

895
00:51:41,555 --> 00:51:42,886
Come on, l know a place.
- Yeah?

896
00:51:42,923 --> 00:51:43,753
Come. Come. Come on.

897
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:46,386
Okay, guys.

898
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:48,285
She can't stay hungry for long.

899
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:50,229
Bye. Bye. Bye.

900
00:51:51,532 --> 00:51:52,430
Come on.

901
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,998
Just a minute. - Come on. - Bye.
Bye guys. Nice seeing you all

902
00:51:55,236 --> 00:51:56,794
Bye, Sister.
- Angry sister.

903
00:51:56,837 --> 00:51:57,826
Come on, let's go.

904
00:51:59,874 --> 00:52:01,774
l told you. Leave him.

905
00:52:02,977 --> 00:52:04,569
l'm so sorry, Anushka.

906
00:52:04,945 --> 00:52:05,912
Relax.

907
00:52:12,286 --> 00:52:13,617
l don't need him.

908
00:52:16,323 --> 00:52:18,416
Not just him, l don't need anyone.

909
00:52:19,694 --> 00:52:22,219
Come on, Anushka. How will
you handle it all by yourself?

910
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:24,194
Yeah, l mean.. Why?

911
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,594
l am successful.

912
00:52:28,803 --> 00:52:29,827
l earn well.

913
00:52:33,307 --> 00:52:34,604
What's the problem?

914
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:40,572
l.. l need a family.

915
00:52:43,517 --> 00:52:45,212
And now my family will consist of me..

916
00:52:46,654 --> 00:52:47,814
And my child.

917
00:52:49,757 --> 00:52:51,281
Come on, let me help you.
- No. No.

918
00:52:51,325 --> 00:52:52,724
Let me help you.
- No.

919
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,928
Okay.
- l'm fine.

920
00:52:55,262 --> 00:52:56,820
One, two.
- Okay. You are fine.

921
00:52:59,233 --> 00:52:59,858
Gauri..

922
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,959
No. l'm not drunk. See.

923
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:04,337
One, two, three.

924
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,899
Hey!

925
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:09,307
What?

926
00:53:13,314 --> 00:53:14,246
lshaan..

927
00:53:16,917 --> 00:53:19,442
l know l am drunk and all that.

928
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:23,182
But it doesn't mean that
l've lost all my senses.

929
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:28,489
l.. l mean we are friends..

930
00:53:28,896 --> 00:53:31,456
..but that doesn't mean
l'm going to sleep with you.

931
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:33,798
So when would you sleep with me?

932
00:53:34,301 --> 00:53:35,325
What!

933
00:53:37,972 --> 00:53:38,961
What's so funny?

934
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,740
Day after tomorrow?. How about Monday?

935
00:53:44,945 --> 00:53:46,970
Or Wednesday?

936
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:50,516
l mean isn't there anything
else in life other than this?

937
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,543
Yeah right.

938
00:53:53,654 --> 00:53:56,817
lshaan. lshaan, don't behave like this.

939
00:53:59,593 --> 00:54:00,821
Come on, lshaan.

940
00:54:01,328 --> 00:54:03,262
Hey! lshaan.

941
00:54:03,664 --> 00:54:05,632
Let's be mature about this.

942
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,429
Oh seriously?

943
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:22,841
Hello?

944
00:54:24,285 --> 00:54:25,217
Yes.

945
00:54:25,486 --> 00:54:27,283
Yeah. Yeah, l'm very busy right now.

946
00:54:27,855 --> 00:54:29,823
Exactly. l told you. l'm busy.

947
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:31,783
Like l was saying that, you know..

948
00:54:31,959 --> 00:54:33,426
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

949
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:41,794
Hello?
- A human heart weighs only 250 grams.

950
00:54:43,304 --> 00:54:45,602
lt pumps 5 liters of blood every minute.

951
00:54:45,806 --> 00:54:46,864
Any extra pressure
causes high blood pressure..

952
00:54:46,907 --> 00:54:50,206
..while ultimately
leads to cardiac arrest.

953
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:51,711
Commonly known as heart attack.

954
00:54:51,846 --> 00:54:53,336
What do you mean?
- Simple.

955
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:56,816
Don't feel guilty and try to
run away, and say sorry. - Sorry.

956
00:54:56,851 --> 00:54:58,409
Sorry that..
- Sorry that..

957
00:54:58,452 --> 00:55:00,386
l left you alone in
the middle of the night.

958
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:02,284
l left you alone in
the middle of the night.

959
00:55:02,323 --> 00:55:03,984
l didn't even ask you
how you reached home.

960
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:05,689
How did you reach home?

961
00:55:06,293 --> 00:55:07,658
l took a rickshaw.

962
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:12,529
l am really, really, really sorry.

963
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:16,503
lt's okay.

964
00:55:16,537 --> 00:55:19,734
But the next time we go out,
l keep the car keys.

965
00:55:19,773 --> 00:55:20,671
Okay?

966
00:55:21,542 --> 00:55:23,339
Okay.
- Dumbo.

967
00:55:25,813 --> 00:55:27,248
We have some options.

968
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:29,716
This works best.
- Six more layouts. - Okay.

969
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,775
Why haven't you still
signed Amala's contract?

970
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:33,253
Why don't you get it?

971
00:55:33,654 --> 00:55:34,643
She's the voice.

972
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:37,847
l didn't like her voice. Remember?

973
00:55:38,259 --> 00:55:39,521
That's why l am launching..

974
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:41,686
Sukanya.

975
00:55:45,366 --> 00:55:46,765
l brought her here.

976
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:49,828
And you invited her to
your dog's birthday party.

977
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,863
Sharp memory.

978
00:55:52,339 --> 00:55:55,467
She attended the party and
my Bugsy and his friends..

979
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:57,270
..loved her singing.

980
00:55:58,279 --> 00:55:59,906
You can't launch her.

981
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:01,746
Sukanya's my find.

982
00:56:02,016 --> 00:56:05,008
Really? Then why didn't you pursue her?

983
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:07,983
You brought ten more girls after her.

984
00:56:08,422 --> 00:56:10,014
And then you started pushing Amala.

985
00:56:10,691 --> 00:56:12,318
l will launch Sukanya.

986
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:17,297
You can help me if you want.

987
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,531
Help? You can't handle it alone?

988
00:56:23,237 --> 00:56:25,637
l am sorry, Beena, but
if you have decided..

989
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:29,803
..to take this company
down then l'm not with you.

990
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,375
l'm not with you.

991
00:56:31,812 --> 00:56:33,302
Not even for a minute.

992
00:56:34,248 --> 00:56:36,580
Okay. As you wish.

993
00:56:36,984 --> 00:56:39,612
l've never bossed you around.

994
00:56:40,254 --> 00:56:41,881
So l can't force you to stay.

995
00:56:44,925 --> 00:56:46,256
All the best.

996
00:56:51,265 --> 00:56:53,563
All the best to you and your company.

997
00:56:54,568 --> 00:56:55,500
We quit.

998
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,564
Come on, guys.

999
00:57:14,455 --> 00:57:15,513
Sleeveless blouse.

1000
00:57:15,689 --> 00:57:17,213
She wears her sari below the navel.

1001
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:18,349
A falling veil.

1002
00:57:18,392 --> 00:57:19,586
She thinks she's hot shit.

1003
00:57:19,994 --> 00:57:22,758
You have observed her very closely.

1004
00:57:22,796 --> 00:57:24,491
Please, that's not true.

1005
00:57:24,932 --> 00:57:26,900
l've done so much for CMC music.

1006
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:29,767
l was the biggest
producer in that company.

1007
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,465
No one noticed my sacrifices.

1008
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,674
l told her bye.

1009
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:35,936
See you around. l quit.

1010
00:57:36,944 --> 00:57:38,741
l, me, myself.

1011
00:57:38,946 --> 00:57:39,844
Will you just keep talking or will you..

1012
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,973
..give others a chance
to praise you as well.

1013
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:48,583
You like Amala?
- Yeah. l think she's a sweet kid.

1014
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:51,381
But it's not like l find
her attractive or something.

1015
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:52,551
You know.

1016
00:57:53,027 --> 00:57:54,494
Hey, Mr. One-Track-Mind.

1017
00:57:54,528 --> 00:57:56,758
l meant Amala, the singer.

1018
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:57,919
Yeah, of course.

1019
00:57:57,965 --> 00:58:00,593
You believe in her?
- Then what!

1020
00:58:01,268 --> 00:58:02,735
Would l spend so much
time on her otherwise?

1021
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:05,396
Then just go for it, lshaan.
- Huh?

1022
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:11,642
l mean you are interested in her
so it's okay if CMC music isn't.

1023
00:58:11,979 --> 00:58:13,276
Launch her.

1024
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,711
''Launch her?''
- Yeah.

1025
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:16,280
Are you crazy, Gauri?

1026
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,475
You don't know anything
about the music industry.

1027
00:58:18,752 --> 00:58:20,721
l'll have to do a lot of hard work.

1028
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:22,450
l'll have to spend a lot of money.

1029
00:58:22,656 --> 00:58:24,419
''Launch her.'' Crazy.

1030
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:27,921
Well, Mr. Music-Executive..

1031
00:58:28,262 --> 00:58:29,923
Work instead of crying.

1032
00:58:30,464 --> 00:58:31,362
Take risks.

1033
00:58:31,532 --> 00:58:33,295
Put your money where you mouth is.

1034
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,862
Lazy ass.

1035
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,800
l'm not talking to you.

1036
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:42,669
Really?
- Really.

1037
00:58:42,876 --> 00:58:44,605
But you are.
- No.

1038
00:58:44,845 --> 00:58:46,745
No?
- l..

1039
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:55,383
Gauri, l think my son is upset with you.

1040
00:58:55,422 --> 00:58:56,320
Hmm.

1041
00:58:58,292 --> 00:58:59,589
All the boys are the same.

1042
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,786
Yeah, l am an idiot, right?

1043
00:59:01,295 --> 00:59:03,729
Yes, you are.
- Yes. Thank you.

1044
00:59:04,264 --> 00:59:08,598
Papa is too. Mummy called
papa an idiot in the car.

1045
00:59:08,902 --> 00:59:09,926
Huh?

1046
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:13,603
Son, don't tell your mummy
that you had pizza here, okay?

1047
00:59:14,374 --> 00:59:15,932
My baby.

1048
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,300
He is also my baby.

1049
00:59:18,645 --> 00:59:19,612
And what about me?

1050
00:59:19,913 --> 00:59:21,380
You are my baby as well.

1051
00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:23,645
All three of you are my babies.

1052
00:59:37,831 --> 00:59:39,298
lshaan..

1053
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:40,867
You can do it.

1054
00:59:40,901 --> 00:59:42,334
Everything will be fine.

1055
00:59:42,903 --> 00:59:43,892
Thanks.

1056
00:59:44,638 --> 00:59:48,836
Uncle lshaan, l had a bad dream.

1057
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:52,678
A bad dream? ln my house?

1058
00:59:52,846 --> 00:59:55,246
But l've already called
the Monster control unit..

1059
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:57,450
..and banished all the monsters.

1060
00:59:57,484 --> 00:59:59,611
No, they are still there.

1061
00:59:59,753 --> 01:00:00,947
Oh really?
- Yeah.

1062
01:00:01,288 --> 01:00:02,983
Granny is sleeping?
- Yes.

1063
01:00:03,524 --> 01:00:05,754
She's making loud noises.
- Really?

1064
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:08,261
Louder than papa's.

1065
01:00:08,695 --> 01:00:11,255
Do you know what l do if l
feel scared of anything?

1066
01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:14,267
What?
- l box it.

1067
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:16,927
Like this.

1068
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:20,898
Take this, bad dream!

1069
01:00:21,241 --> 01:00:22,367
Take this, you monster!

1070
01:00:22,409 --> 01:00:23,210
Who's the best?

1071
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,404
Who's the best? Rishi is the best.

1072
01:00:24,444 --> 01:00:26,878
Rishi is the best.
- Uncle lshaan, l love you.

1073
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,745
You are a super hero.

1074
01:00:29,216 --> 01:00:30,274
l love you, too.

1075
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:41,727
Beautiful. Awesome.

1076
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,319
She's looking good, right?

1077
01:00:44,364 --> 01:00:45,228
You are happy.

1078
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:47,232
Lean in forward.

1079
01:00:48,669 --> 01:00:50,500
Chin up. Gauri.
- Chin up.

1080
01:00:51,338 --> 01:00:52,305
Excuse me.
- Lovely.

1081
01:00:52,406 --> 01:00:53,270
lshaan.
- Listen,

1082
01:00:53,307 --> 01:00:54,672
l wanted to talk to you.

1083
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,409
Not now. l'm working.
- Turn to me.

1084
01:00:56,443 --> 01:00:58,638
But..
- Yes. - Wait for me over there.

1085
01:00:58,679 --> 01:00:59,771
Hold.
- Please.

1086
01:01:00,013 --> 01:01:01,571
Okay.
- Little on your right.

1087
01:01:03,483 --> 01:01:04,279
Lovely.

1088
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:05,717
That's nice. Very good.

1089
01:01:31,278 --> 01:01:32,575
You play the piano?

1090
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,278
Sojust like that?

1091
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:36,909
l always wanted to learn.

1092
01:01:37,618 --> 01:01:39,518
As a child l had a dream
of becoming a musician.

1093
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:42,345
Then?
- l grew up.

1094
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:45,222
And?
- Dreams changed.

1095
01:01:45,392 --> 01:01:46,950
Like?
- Like you know..

1096
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:51,261
Money, success, etcetera, etcetera.

1097
01:01:51,632 --> 01:01:53,463
Well, then it's
never too late, you know.

1098
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,468
You should always do what you like.

1099
01:01:55,602 --> 01:01:56,728
No regrets.

1100
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:59,598
Today, l'll give you
your first piano lesson.

1101
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,629
You play the piano?

1102
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:02,808
l know one music piece.

1103
01:02:02,943 --> 01:02:04,877
Do you wish to learn or not?
- Okay.

1104
01:02:05,312 --> 01:02:07,906
Okay. Left hand.

1105
01:02:08,815 --> 01:02:10,783
Yeah. Ready.

1106
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:31,261
Gauri, you are right.

1107
01:03:33,867 --> 01:03:35,494
l should launch Amala.

1108
01:03:36,303 --> 01:03:37,429
And l will.

1109
01:03:38,472 --> 01:03:39,461
That's good.

1110
01:03:40,907 --> 01:03:41,839
And..

1111
01:03:42,743 --> 01:03:44,438
l didn't quit my job.

1112
01:03:45,579 --> 01:03:48,639
l was bluffing about my
resignation and she caught it.

1113
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,681
So basically, l was fired.

1114
01:03:57,257 --> 01:04:01,751
So.. you need my help with Amala?

1115
01:04:01,895 --> 01:04:03,795
Yes. Yes, please.

1116
01:04:05,532 --> 01:04:06,726
Okay.

1117
01:04:12,272 --> 01:04:13,569
Just go.

1118
01:04:14,908 --> 01:04:16,341
Oh God.

1119
01:04:16,843 --> 01:04:18,178
Give me that.
- But..

1120
01:04:18,178 --> 01:04:19,941
l'll hit you.
- Okay. - Go. Go!

1121
01:04:24,284 --> 01:04:26,878
''l'm so into you, it's frightful..''

1122
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,616
''lt makes every moment delightful.''

1123
01:04:29,723 --> 01:04:31,918
''You immortalize my heart..''

1124
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:33,858
''My love.''

1125
01:04:35,262 --> 01:04:37,787
''l'm so into you, it's frightful..''

1126
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:40,527
''lt makes every moment delightful.''
- At least say it now.

1127
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,830
''You immortalize my heart..''

1128
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:44,894
''My love.''
- Master, you are great!

1129
01:04:44,938 --> 01:04:48,897
''Without you..''
- Come on.

1130
01:04:49,209 --> 01:04:53,236
Working, right?
- ''My life seems incomplete.''

1131
01:04:55,916 --> 01:04:58,476
''Without you..''

1132
01:04:59,886 --> 01:05:05,222
''l'm estranged with myself.''

1133
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:11,429
''Come, touch with your eyes..''
- Come on! Gauri.

1134
01:05:11,531 --> 01:05:13,624
Gauri. What are you doing? Gauri.

1135
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:16,500
''My dreams..''
- Gauri.

1136
01:05:16,536 --> 01:05:18,527
Gauri!
- ''My love.'' - Shhh! Be quite

1137
01:05:18,572 --> 01:05:19,630
Come in the pool.

1138
01:05:19,673 --> 01:05:26,909
Okay. Okay. Coming. Coming.
- ''Come, keep your smiles on my lips.''

1139
01:05:27,481 --> 01:05:30,473
''Let me live the moment.''
- Come.

1140
01:05:30,684 --> 01:05:32,948
Wow!
- ''My love.''

1141
01:05:32,986 --> 01:05:35,546
Good boy.
- You wanna play?

1142
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:39,259
No! No! No!
- ''My love.''

1143
01:05:39,259 --> 01:05:41,750
You know, when l was in Sophia college..

1144
01:05:42,696 --> 01:05:45,665
..l used to skip college and
come here with my friends.

1145
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,901
Mom, did you ever have a boyfriend?

1146
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,801
l mean before dad.

1147
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:53,806
Your dad wasn't my boyfriend.

1148
01:05:54,841 --> 01:05:56,604
From being a strange,
he became my fiance.

1149
01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:01,938
And then we got married. Mom.
- Yes?

1150
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:04,541
Do you not love dad anymore?

1151
01:06:04,718 --> 01:06:06,310
Of course l love him.

1152
01:06:07,287 --> 01:06:09,585
But sometimes, just love isn't enough.

1153
01:06:09,923 --> 01:06:10,787
What do you mean?

1154
01:06:10,824 --> 01:06:15,420
Look lshu, all relationships
have to have a two-way traffic.

1155
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:17,796
You should get as
much as you give, right?

1156
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:21,527
Love is so awesome.

1157
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:23,828
You don't say a word to each other..

1158
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:27,496
..and yet you are so
close to each other.

1159
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,635
That kind of a silence is bliss.

1160
01:06:34,848 --> 01:06:37,681
''You are my reason to live.''

1161
01:06:37,784 --> 01:06:40,446
''You are the morning to my night.''

1162
01:06:40,487 --> 01:06:42,689
''You are my home.''

1163
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:44,748
''My love.''

1164
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:48,726
''Without you..''

1165
01:06:48,929 --> 01:06:52,831
''My life seems incomplete.''

1166
01:06:55,769 --> 01:06:59,705
''Without you..''

1167
01:06:59,873 --> 01:07:04,401
''l'm estranged with myself.''

1168
01:07:18,224 --> 01:07:21,557
lshaan. Meet Taruni,
my girlfriend. And..

1169
01:07:22,262 --> 01:07:24,287
We wanted you to be the
first person to get this news.

1170
01:07:24,664 --> 01:07:26,291
We are engaged.

1171
01:07:26,466 --> 01:07:31,665
''Come, touch with your eyes..''
- Sexy.

1172
01:07:31,805 --> 01:07:34,933
''My dreams.''
- Hey! What? lshaan!

1173
01:07:35,408 --> 01:07:37,399
''My love.''
- You think l'm sexy?

1174
01:07:37,911 --> 01:07:41,904
''Come, keep your smiles..''

1175
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:42,846
Come on. Leave.

1176
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:46,283
''On my lips.''
- l told you. l told you.

1177
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,787
''Let me live the moment.''

1178
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:54,359
''My love.''

1179
01:07:55,028 --> 01:07:57,792
''My love.''

1180
01:07:57,831 --> 01:08:00,391
''Make your every dream come true.''

1181
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:03,459
''My love.''

1182
01:08:08,008 --> 01:08:11,273
Heavy looks are being exchanged.

1183
01:08:11,945 --> 01:08:13,037
Tarun, l really like her, dude.

1184
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:14,746
Yes, l can see that.

1185
01:08:14,781 --> 01:08:17,409
No, l mean, l seriously, really,
really like her.

1186
01:08:18,218 --> 01:08:18,980
Well done, man.

1187
01:08:19,219 --> 01:08:20,481
l'm really proud of you.

1188
01:08:38,438 --> 01:08:39,769
One, two, three.

1189
01:08:39,906 --> 01:08:40,964
One, two, three.

1190
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:43,738
One. Two. Three. Go.

1191
01:08:46,513 --> 01:08:47,313
Cut. Cut.

1192
01:08:47,313 --> 01:08:48,439
Cut. Cut. Cut.

1193
01:08:48,548 --> 01:08:50,573
Guys, please take five minutes, okay?

1194
01:08:50,817 --> 01:08:52,307
Amala, just relax.

1195
01:08:53,687 --> 01:08:56,247
Amala, what's happening?

1196
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,983
Can't you even pertorm
two steps while singing?

1197
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:01,824
lt's not so, lshaan.

1198
01:09:01,861 --> 01:09:03,726
For me this song is..
- What?

1199
01:09:07,767 --> 01:09:10,793
lshaan, Rafiq and l
have tried something new.

1200
01:09:10,904 --> 01:09:12,269
Would you like to hear it?

1201
01:09:13,473 --> 01:09:14,269
Okay.

1202
01:09:21,481 --> 01:09:26,714
''lmpressions on the heart..''

1203
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,816
''lmpressions on the heart..''

1204
01:09:32,692 --> 01:09:34,216
''lmpressions on the heart..''

1205
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,591
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1206
01:09:38,565 --> 01:09:39,657
What is wrong with you?

1207
01:09:40,767 --> 01:09:42,758
Your launch show is in three days.

1208
01:09:43,536 --> 01:09:45,265
And you think this is ajoke.

1209
01:09:46,706 --> 01:09:49,834
l know the market
better than all of you.

1210
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:52,239
Now come on, get on with your work.

1211
01:09:53,246 --> 01:09:54,873
Okay, everybody. From the top.

1212
01:10:06,893 --> 01:10:08,656
Hi, lshaan.

1213
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,896
We don't need the
formality of an interview.

1214
01:10:12,465 --> 01:10:13,955
l'll hire you straight away.

1215
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,594
l know you..

1216
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:17,566
You have come here
looking for ajob, right?

1217
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:22,839
Who will need ajob..

1218
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:24,975
Who's business will go bust..

1219
01:10:26,412 --> 01:10:28,209
Amala's launch will tell it all.

1220
01:10:36,556 --> 01:10:37,648
Do come!

1221
01:10:45,799 --> 01:10:46,993
Not bad, Shivs.

1222
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,326
Staying with Adil you've
learnt to cook good food.

1223
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:54,431
Thank you. - But Mom, she still
can't make fritters like you do.

1224
01:10:54,774 --> 01:10:56,901
l don't need to. Mom is here.

1225
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:58,902
By the way, Mom, what is the plan?

1226
01:10:59,345 --> 01:11:00,539
Papa is all alone.

1227
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:01,543
Yeah, Mom.

1228
01:11:01,581 --> 01:11:02,980
You need to take care of dad.

1229
01:11:04,984 --> 01:11:05,951
Sorry. One second.

1230
01:11:06,452 --> 01:11:07,384
Hello?

1231
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:09,512
Hi, where are you?

1232
01:11:09,656 --> 01:11:11,021
l couldn't get through to your phone.

1233
01:11:13,259 --> 01:11:15,693
Yeah. No, l tried even earlier.

1234
01:11:16,763 --> 01:11:17,752
Hows your shoot going?

1235
01:11:17,797 --> 01:11:18,855
Gauri.

1236
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,666
Our neighbor.
- ls everything okay?

1237
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,724
lt's her call.

1238
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:23,232
She is a very nice girl.

1239
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:27,200
Yes, we both. We both. - Ever
since she has come into his life..

1240
01:11:30,643 --> 01:11:31,667
Excuse me.

1241
01:11:32,545 --> 01:11:34,536
Mom, you should stop daydreaming.

1242
01:11:35,481 --> 01:11:39,247
lshaan has never taken anyone
seriously, and he never will.

1243
01:11:39,452 --> 01:11:40,714
Shivani.

1244
01:11:48,294 --> 01:11:50,922
Tell him. About Anushka.

1245
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:54,859
But if Anushka doesn't
want to tell him, how can l?

1246
01:11:55,869 --> 01:11:58,929
And look at him. He is talking
over the phone like a Romeo.

1247
01:11:59,372 --> 01:12:00,930
What should l tell him?
- Yes.

1248
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:03,600
But to be fair to everyone,
he needs to know.

1249
01:12:04,477 --> 01:12:06,342
When will you tell him if not now?.

1250
01:12:10,016 --> 01:12:11,574
l'll pick you up later, at nine.

1251
01:12:11,784 --> 01:12:13,274
For sure. Don't worry.

1252
01:12:13,786 --> 01:12:15,845
Okay, Gauri. l need to hang up.

1253
01:12:16,456 --> 01:12:17,889
l'll call you back. Bye.

1254
01:12:21,561 --> 01:12:22,823
lshaan.

1255
01:12:22,962 --> 01:12:24,589
l need to tell you something.

1256
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,531
Anushka is pregnant.

1257
01:12:31,204 --> 01:12:32,262
That's quick.

1258
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:34,501
She didn't invite me for her wedding?

1259
01:12:35,475 --> 01:12:37,568
lshaan, it's your child.

1260
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:41,480
And that's what she wanted to tell
you the other day, over dinner..

1261
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:42,772
..but you were just so..

1262
01:12:42,815 --> 01:12:45,215
Oh. She has stooped so
low to have me back?

1263
01:12:45,718 --> 01:12:46,844
And have you lost it?

1264
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,346
She said it's my child
and you believed her?

1265
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,550
Oh, come on.

1266
01:12:51,858 --> 01:12:53,621
What's the proof that it's my child?

1267
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,325
Yeah?

1268
01:12:56,262 --> 01:12:58,457
lshaan, are you out of your mind?

1269
01:12:58,631 --> 01:13:00,223
What are you saying?

1270
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:02,530
How can you even ask me this?

1271
01:13:02,702 --> 01:13:03,964
Shivani..

1272
01:13:04,637 --> 01:13:05,797
Why are you yelling?

1273
01:13:06,406 --> 01:13:07,566
What's wrong?

1274
01:13:07,707 --> 01:13:09,231
Say something at least.

1275
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,736
Mom, your son.. lshaan.

1276
01:13:13,546 --> 01:13:15,707
You know what he has done?
- l haven't done anything, Mom.

1277
01:13:15,748 --> 01:13:17,375
Anushka is after me.

1278
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:18,406
After you?!

1279
01:13:18,651 --> 01:13:20,585
Mom, they were together for three years.

1280
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,652
Okay?

1281
01:13:22,288 --> 01:13:24,779
Anushka tried to meet you
and papa a number of times..

1282
01:13:24,824 --> 01:13:26,257
..but he never let it happen.

1283
01:13:26,893 --> 01:13:28,690
Why, lshaan? You were having fun?

1284
01:13:28,895 --> 01:13:32,194
Shivani, is this the way
you talk to your brother?

1285
01:13:33,733 --> 01:13:35,223
What has lshu done?

1286
01:13:35,601 --> 01:13:40,231
Shivs.. - Mom, Anushka is pregnant.
With lshaan's child.

1287
01:13:40,506 --> 01:13:43,304
And he is asking me for proof.

1288
01:13:47,747 --> 01:13:49,339
Shivani..

1289
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:52,580
lshaan cannot make such a big mistake.

1290
01:13:52,852 --> 01:13:56,720
Mom! Stop taking his side at least now.

1291
01:13:57,457 --> 01:13:58,947
How many more years will you and l..

1292
01:13:58,992 --> 01:14:00,653
..keep forgiving him for his mistakes?

1293
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,227
lshaan..

1294
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:09,965
ln college when you used to
party all night and come home..

1295
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:13,804
Mom and l used to lie to papa
that you are sleeping upstairs.

1296
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,702
And your report cards..

1297
01:14:15,908 --> 01:14:19,435
You used to get caught
forging papa's signatures..

1298
01:14:19,645 --> 01:14:25,174
And Mom, you used to tell
papa that you forged them. Wow!

1299
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:28,414
You have always been wrong, lshaan.

1300
01:14:28,688 --> 01:14:30,747
And we have been worse than you.

1301
01:14:32,692 --> 01:14:33,716
Mom, just ignore her.

1302
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,196
You know Shivani has a habit of
making a big issue about everything.

1303
01:14:43,636 --> 01:14:45,399
l wouldn't have to face this

1304
01:14:46,372 --> 01:14:48,272
if l would've done this earlier.

1305
01:14:51,411 --> 01:14:56,314
You'll have to learn to
accept your mistakes, lshu.

1306
01:16:26,572 --> 01:16:27,630
Why?

1307
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,639
When we have parted ways..

1308
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,408
When l am leading my
life well without you..

1309
01:16:39,852 --> 01:16:42,787
When for once my career
seems to be on a high..

1310
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:47,721
Why all this? Tell me.

1311
01:16:48,794 --> 01:16:50,853
lf this is my child..

1312
01:16:52,431 --> 01:16:53,625
lf it is?

1313
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:56,732
lshaan, this is your child.

1314
01:16:58,804 --> 01:17:00,465
Then why didn't you tell me?

1315
01:17:03,976 --> 01:17:05,341
l tried.

1316
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:07,303
A number of times.

1317
01:17:07,413 --> 01:17:10,280
But you..
- Don't give me all that shit.

1318
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:16,318
Why.. Why can't you hear
someone out for once, lshaan?

1319
01:17:16,856 --> 01:17:18,551
Why is it always about you? You..

1320
01:17:22,228 --> 01:17:25,459
You were never actually
involved with me or my life.

1321
01:17:25,498 --> 01:17:27,693
Oh. Poor Anushka.

1322
01:17:28,401 --> 01:17:30,528
She can do everything by herself.

1323
01:17:31,804 --> 01:17:33,294
What do you want to prove?

1324
01:17:33,472 --> 01:17:34,632
Prove?

1325
01:17:36,976 --> 01:17:41,310
lshaan, actually the truth is,
that l don't want you here right now.

1326
01:17:42,648 --> 01:17:43,945
And l am happy.

1327
01:17:44,383 --> 01:17:45,941
l am happy here without you.

1328
01:17:45,985 --> 01:17:47,885
Oh, l can see that.

1329
01:17:48,487 --> 01:17:49,886
You are so great.

1330
01:17:51,757 --> 01:17:54,658
Anushka doesn't need anyone.

1331
01:17:54,694 --> 01:17:56,662
Oh, wait a second. Wait a second.

1332
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,564
You finally got Agastya, right?

1333
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:01,826
Where is he? Agastya?

1334
01:18:02,335 --> 01:18:04,394
lshaan, stop it. He is not here.

1335
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,438
Then why did you cry
over Shivani's shoulder?

1336
01:18:11,544 --> 01:18:12,841
What were you hoping?

1337
01:18:13,546 --> 01:18:14,376
Hope?

1338
01:18:16,749 --> 01:18:18,774
lshaan, l lost hope the day when..

1339
01:18:18,818 --> 01:18:20,809
The day when you threw
me out of the house.

1340
01:18:25,391 --> 01:18:26,619
Today, mom..

1341
01:18:28,227 --> 01:18:29,819
Mom said that l was wrong.

1342
01:18:31,264 --> 01:18:32,561
All these years.

1343
01:18:33,966 --> 01:18:35,695
Mom and Shivani..

1344
01:18:37,436 --> 01:18:39,404
They all are blaming me.

1345
01:18:39,905 --> 01:18:40,872
All..

1346
01:18:51,517 --> 01:18:52,848
lshaan..

1347
01:18:56,722 --> 01:18:58,713
You can never change.

1348
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:04,292
Perhaps, that's why we are not together.

1349
01:19:04,764 --> 01:19:08,860
''When l became a part of your dream..''

1350
01:19:09,969 --> 01:19:14,269
''ls when l woke up.''

1351
01:19:15,408 --> 01:19:24,806
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1352
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:30,820
''l can hold you..''
- Hi!

1353
01:19:31,457 --> 01:19:35,518
''But you aren't in my destiny.''

1354
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:46,570
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1355
01:19:55,681 --> 01:19:56,841
lshaan..

1356
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:04,918
''Without you..''
- lshaan.. Wake up.

1357
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:10,258
''May l not spend a single night.''

1358
01:20:11,364 --> 01:20:15,596
''Close to you..'' -lshaan.
Wake up, let's go.

1359
01:20:16,669 --> 01:20:21,902
''l should spend all my days.''
- Come on. Please, let's go.

1360
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:31,548
''May l not spend a single night.''

1361
01:20:32,718 --> 01:20:36,848
''Close to you..''

1362
01:20:37,923 --> 01:20:42,951
''l should spend all my days.''

1363
01:20:43,496 --> 01:20:48,593
''When l became a part of your dream..''

1364
01:20:48,768 --> 01:20:52,966
''ls when l woke up.''

1365
01:20:54,240 --> 01:21:02,011
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''
- Sorry.

1366
01:21:04,817 --> 01:21:09,015
''l can hold you..''

1367
01:21:10,322 --> 01:21:14,383
''But you aren't in my destiny.''
- lshaan, l didn't know this is how..

1368
01:21:14,527 --> 01:21:25,199
l'll get a chance to get so close to you.
- ''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1369
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:30,535
Sometimes l feel as if l
don't know you at all.

1370
01:21:47,526 --> 01:21:52,657
''When l became a part of your dream..''

1371
01:21:52,832 --> 01:21:57,235
''ls when l woke up.''

1372
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:07,577
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1373
01:22:08,848 --> 01:22:13,979
''l can hold you..''

1374
01:22:14,253 --> 01:22:19,190
''But you aren't in my destiny.''

1375
01:22:19,558 --> 01:22:29,194
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1376
01:22:31,837 --> 01:22:32,826
Morning.

1377
01:22:33,506 --> 01:22:35,838
One shouldn't have
caffeine early in the morning.

1378
01:22:36,542 --> 01:22:41,536
But to put an end to a few nights
and for a fresh start to a new day..

1379
01:22:41,614 --> 01:22:43,514
..one cup of coffee is a must.

1380
01:22:43,549 --> 01:22:45,210
So, here you go.

1381
01:22:46,886 --> 01:22:50,378
By the way if you want
to talk about last night..

1382
01:22:50,422 --> 01:22:52,447
..then l won't refuse to hear it.

1383
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:04,893
Thank you.

1384
01:23:07,806 --> 01:23:09,000
Anushka.

1385
01:23:10,876 --> 01:23:12,571
She is my ex-girlfriend.

1386
01:23:16,348 --> 01:23:17,679
And that child is mine.

1387
01:23:22,221 --> 01:23:23,210
What happend?

1388
01:23:23,622 --> 01:23:25,214
She wanted to marry.

1389
01:23:26,191 --> 01:23:28,352
And i was not ready for commitment.

1390
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:31,889
She wants you back now?.
- No.

1391
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:34,495
She is very happy.

1392
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:36,667
She's very happy without me.

1393
01:23:40,606 --> 01:23:44,235
So, do you want to go back to her?

1394
01:23:45,744 --> 01:23:48,406
lt's not about Anushka anymore.

1395
01:23:50,649 --> 01:23:52,207
lt's about us.

1396
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:54,978
You and me.

1397
01:23:56,622 --> 01:23:59,921
That's why when l came to know
about the baby from Shivani..

1398
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:03,226
..l don't know why l was
so angry with Anushka.

1399
01:24:03,729 --> 01:24:07,631
l thought my life has gone back
to the place l've come out of.

1400
01:24:09,702 --> 01:24:11,397
Because of you.

1401
01:24:14,807 --> 01:24:18,334
And l also felt angry thinking
about why she didn't tell me.

1402
01:24:18,744 --> 01:24:20,371
Male ego.

1403
01:24:32,524 --> 01:24:34,185
Will you go to Paris with me?

1404
01:24:34,493 --> 01:24:37,792
Paris?
- l had applied for a course.

1405
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:39,561
l received a letter yesterday.

1406
01:24:39,598 --> 01:24:41,327
l have to go for a year.

1407
01:24:41,834 --> 01:24:44,428
You know, we could start afresh.

1408
01:24:44,937 --> 01:24:48,532
We can stay there in a studio apartment.

1409
01:24:49,308 --> 01:24:52,641
l'll go for my classes and of
course you'll make breakfast.

1410
01:24:52,745 --> 01:24:55,646
You will drop me and you know..

1411
01:24:55,814 --> 01:24:59,807
You can pick me up. We can
go for long walks. Lunch!

1412
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:03,945
You can try the music Scene over there.

1413
01:25:04,957 --> 01:25:06,788
We can settle there.

1414
01:25:10,696 --> 01:25:14,223
l mean only if you want to.

1415
01:25:14,533 --> 01:25:16,501
l cannot force you.

1416
01:25:26,745 --> 01:25:28,474
Love you.

1417
01:25:28,881 --> 01:25:30,712
Wait. What about aunt?

1418
01:25:31,517 --> 01:25:32,848
She'll stay here alone?

1419
01:25:32,885 --> 01:25:33,977
Oh, shit!

1420
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:35,843
l had to arrange for a
taxi to Pune for mom.

1421
01:25:36,021 --> 01:25:37,249
l'll meet you later, okay?

1422
01:25:37,289 --> 01:25:39,280
She'll be really angry. Bye. Bye. Bye.

1423
01:25:39,591 --> 01:25:42,355
Oh, wow! Paris!

1424
01:25:50,903 --> 01:25:52,928
l agree that l've spoilt you..

1425
01:25:56,341 --> 01:26:02,337
But if l've done anything
right in your upbringing..

1426
01:26:03,315 --> 01:26:08,480
Then you, too, do what
is right, otherwise..

1427
01:26:10,489 --> 01:26:15,859
..it will be a difficult old age.

1428
01:26:19,498 --> 01:26:26,461
l'm going back to the
responsibility l've left behind in Pune.

1429
01:26:33,912 --> 01:26:35,243
lshu..

1430
01:26:36,949 --> 01:26:39,577
Son, if possible..

1431
01:26:39,618 --> 01:26:43,987
..try to understand
your responsibilities.

1432
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:47,552
Okay?
- Okay.

1433
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,543
lshaan has sent an invite for his event.

1434
01:27:14,486 --> 01:27:15,817
How sweet.

1435
01:27:17,623 --> 01:27:19,614
l'll be late returning from Melghat.

1436
01:27:20,425 --> 01:27:21,449
Will you go for it?

1437
01:27:23,395 --> 01:27:24,327
No.

1438
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:57,828
Hi.
- Hey.

1439
01:27:57,863 --> 01:27:58,989
Hi. Hi.

1440
01:27:59,965 --> 01:28:02,627
Hey, lshaan. Congratulations, bro.

1441
01:28:02,668 --> 01:28:04,636
You've finally done it.
- Thanks, bro.

1442
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:06,399
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1443
01:28:08,674 --> 01:28:10,335
Come on, l want to grab good seats.

1444
01:28:10,542 --> 01:28:11,736
Dude, l'm really looking
forward to this. - Yeah.

1445
01:28:11,877 --> 01:28:13,310
See you.
- How about an interview, ma'am?

1446
01:28:13,345 --> 01:28:14,279
No more questions.
- One question, ma'am.

1447
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:15,473
Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

1448
01:28:15,514 --> 01:28:16,446
Hello.
- Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am..

1449
01:28:16,481 --> 01:28:19,382
lt's always a pleasure to
listen to new singers. - Ma'am..

1450
01:28:41,406 --> 01:28:42,703
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1451
01:28:42,741 --> 01:28:44,402
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1452
01:28:44,643 --> 01:28:46,235
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1453
01:28:46,278 --> 01:28:47,745
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1454
01:28:53,485 --> 01:28:58,650
'But if l've done anything
right in your upbringing..'

1455
01:28:59,258 --> 01:29:02,455
'Then you, too, do what is right.'

1456
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:12,730
'Ladies and gentlemen. The show is
about t o begin in two minutes.'

1457
01:29:13,405 --> 01:29:15,202
Rafiq. Change in plans.

1458
01:29:15,474 --> 01:29:17,840
lshaan, such a big change? Right now?.

1459
01:29:17,876 --> 01:29:18,774
Just do it.

1460
01:29:19,544 --> 01:29:22,308
'We request you to please
switch off your phones now.'

1461
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:24,778
Guys, there's a change in plans.

1462
01:29:24,816 --> 01:29:26,511
We are doing the new track.

1463
01:29:27,386 --> 01:29:28,910
Listen, don't worry.

lshaan, l haven't even
rehearsed on this song.

1467
01:29:33,759 --> 01:29:35,624
And you were right.

1468
01:29:36,228 --> 01:29:38,662
You know better about the market.

1469
01:29:39,231 --> 01:29:41,722
And you know yourself
and your talent better.

1470
01:29:42,434 --> 01:29:44,493
You and show them what a
superstar you are, Amala.

1471

Okay?

Okay, guys. Let's go.

Let's move and no noise backstage.

01:29:53,312 --> 01:29:54,643
Come on, all the best.

1476

lshaan.. relax.

1477

This shows going to be a big hit.

1478
01:30:04,022 --> 01:30:04,954
lt will be.

1479
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:06,414
Thanks.

1480
01:30:06,758 --> 01:30:07,850
lshaan..

1481
01:30:10,862 --> 01:30:12,352
Paris is waiting.

1482
01:30:14,633 --> 01:30:15,600
Come on.

1483
01:30:19,905 --> 01:30:21,270
Hey, where are you guys going?

1484
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,673
The show is about to begin.

1485
01:30:25,944 --> 01:30:27,775
lshaan, Anushka's
contractions have started.

1486
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:30,244
She is all alone. We really should go.

1487
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:35,982
Let's go.

1488
01:30:36,388 --> 01:30:37,514
Shivani..

1489
01:30:40,926 --> 01:30:44,521
Not you, l should go.

1490
01:30:52,504 --> 01:30:53,664
l'm sorry.

1491
01:31:15,193 --> 01:31:20,460
''lmpressions on the heart..''

1492
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:25,499
''lmpressions on the heart..''

1493
01:31:26,471 --> 01:31:31,534
''Heart is full of impressions.''

1494
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:39,480
''There are a lot of
impressions on the heart.''

1495
01:31:43,355 --> 01:31:48,952
''Your memories are those impressions.''

1496
01:31:51,897 --> 01:31:57,233
''To support a fallen twig there's wind.''

1497
01:31:57,469 --> 01:32:02,372
''To support a falling
star there's prayer.''

1498
01:32:03,341 --> 01:32:08,335
''What's to support a broken heart?''

1499
01:32:08,447 --> 01:32:11,280
''Everywhere, there's God.''

1500
01:32:11,316 --> 01:32:13,944
''Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious.''

1501
01:32:13,985 --> 01:32:16,715
''Everywhere, there's a companion.''

1502
01:32:16,755 --> 01:32:18,746
''Everywhere, there's a destination.''

''Everywhere, there's a destination.''

1507
01:32:52,924 --> 01:32:58,726
''What if we keep the loose ends untied?''

1508
01:32:58,763 --> 01:33:04,463
''What if we assume that you are right?''

1509
01:33:04,503 --> 01:33:09,964
''What if there was no
differences or grudges between us?''

1510
01:33:10,308 --> 01:33:15,644
''What if there was no fear
of a possible heartbreak?''

1511
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:18,615
''We have thought so much about it.''

1512
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:21,175
''But it never happens.''

1513
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:22,718
''Everywhere.''

1514
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:24,619
''Everywhere, there's God.''

heart is oblivious.''

1533
01:34:39,264 --> 01:34:40,458
Congratulations.

1534
01:34:40,732 --> 01:34:42,461
She had a healthy baby girl.

1535
01:34:45,203 --> 01:34:46,192
Thank you.

1536
01:35:22,307 --> 01:35:23,638
Hi, baby girl.

1537
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,368
l'm your papa.

1538
01:35:29,347 --> 01:35:32,248
l thought l should
prepare you a little about me.

1539
01:35:33,952 --> 01:35:36,250
Everyone says that l'm very selfish.

1540
01:35:37,956 --> 01:35:39,287
They are right.

1541
01:35:42,594 --> 01:35:45,654
Someone once told me that
l can change if l want to.

1542
01:35:46,965 --> 01:35:49,297
That l should never stop trying.

1543
01:35:53,805 --> 01:35:57,571
Today, after seeing you l feel,
that that person is right.

1544
01:35:59,678 --> 01:36:01,441
Today, l have got another chance.

1545
01:36:04,516 --> 01:36:07,917
l promise.. l will never stop trying.

1546
01:36:10,522 --> 01:36:11,511
l'll be good.

1547
01:36:12,624 --> 01:36:13,556
l promise.

1548
01:36:15,827 --> 01:36:16,851
l'll be better.

1549
01:36:18,363 --> 01:36:19,455
l promise.

1550
01:36:20,865 --> 01:36:22,298
l'll be the best.

1551
01:36:25,303 --> 01:36:26,292
For you.

1552
01:36:28,707 --> 01:36:34,373
One day l'll make you so
proud that you'll happily say..

1553
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:38,676
''lshaan Sabharwal is my papa.''

1554
01:36:41,753 --> 01:36:42,845
And l love you.

1555
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:48,986
Would you like to hold her?

1556
01:37:06,611 --> 01:37:07,635
Hi, baby.

1557
01:37:12,317 --> 01:37:13,341
lshaan..

1558
01:37:14,886 --> 01:37:15,853
Here you go.

1559
01:37:20,825 --> 01:37:22,850
She needs her papa.

1560
01:37:26,765 --> 01:37:28,232
She needs you.

1561
01:37:36,674 --> 01:37:38,539
After all, she has only one father.

1562
01:37:41,713 --> 01:37:43,647
l think it's a bit too
late to escape that now.

1563
01:37:45,884 --> 01:37:46,816
Thank you.

1564
01:37:47,285 --> 01:37:50,015
l heard that you were
going to go to Paris.

1565
01:37:52,323 --> 01:37:55,554
No. lt's important for me to be here.

1566
01:37:58,263 --> 01:37:59,389
With her.

1567
01:38:01,433 --> 01:38:02,491
With you.

1568
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:10,931
lshaan, our time is over.

1569
01:38:12,777 --> 01:38:14,574
What will we gain even
if we do get married?

1570
01:38:15,814 --> 01:38:18,339
Fights, arguments, divorce?

1571
01:38:21,753 --> 01:38:23,516
Think about what she will go through.

1572
01:38:26,357 --> 01:38:30,293
We need to build a
world for our daughter..

1573
01:38:30,762 --> 01:38:34,425
..where in spite of knowing
that her parents aren't together..

1574
01:38:34,466 --> 01:38:35,364
..she knows that they are happy.

1575
01:38:37,335 --> 01:38:41,897
Where she knows that even if
our worlds are different, she..

1576
01:38:46,444 --> 01:38:47,843
She is our universe.

1577
01:38:53,384 --> 01:38:54,248
Yeah.

1578
01:38:58,456 --> 01:38:59,821
lf you love her..

1579
01:39:01,559 --> 01:39:02,924
..then don't let her go.

1580
01:39:06,998 --> 01:39:07,862
Hey.

1581
01:39:16,341 --> 01:39:17,273
Wow.

1582
01:39:34,325 --> 01:39:35,485
Thank you. -Thank you, sir.

1583
01:39:40,832 --> 01:39:42,732
Yeah, Anushka?
- Yes, lshaan. Where are you?

1584
01:39:42,901 --> 01:39:44,801
Anushka, l look after
her better than you do.

1585
01:39:44,836 --> 01:39:45,894
Yeah, yeah, l know.

1586
01:39:46,237 --> 01:39:47,295
Anyway, just chill.

1587
01:39:47,438 --> 01:39:48,871
lt's my turn, today.
- Hey, but..

1588
01:39:48,907 --> 01:39:53,241
Good morning, sir.- So it would be better if
you and your husband disturb me a little less.

1589
01:39:53,344 --> 01:39:54,311
But listen, don't be late.

1590
01:39:54,345 --> 01:39:55,243
Okay, bye.
- Listen..

1591
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,269
Okay, bye.

1592
01:39:56,414 --> 01:39:57,540
Okay. Bye.

1593
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:26,438
Hi, Diya. How are you, little one?

1594
01:40:26,711 --> 01:40:28,406
Diya, look who's there, baby.

1595
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:29,512
Hi, lshaan.

1596
01:40:30,682 --> 01:40:31,671
When are you coming back?

1597
01:40:35,386 --> 01:40:38,287
Hey Diya, how are you?

1598
01:40:38,323 --> 01:40:39,950
Look..
- You know what?

1599
01:40:40,458 --> 01:40:43,723
lf your papa says, ''l'm the best.

1600
01:40:43,895 --> 01:40:44,862
l'm the best'' to you..

1601
01:40:45,296 --> 01:40:46,923
..you shouldn't listen to him at all.

1602
01:40:47,432 --> 01:40:48,399
You know why?

1603
01:40:48,933 --> 01:40:51,265
Because.. because you are the best.

1604
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:55,600
You really are the best
thing that's happened to him.

1605
01:41:00,979 --> 01:41:02,742
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1606
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:03,712
Diya is the best.

1607
01:41:07,885 --> 01:41:11,286
Who's the best? So cute. Look..

1608
01:41:11,623 --> 01:41:12,885
Bite your fingers?

1609
01:41:55,233 --> 01:41:56,461
''Who's that sexy boy?''

1610
01:41:56,501 --> 01:41:57,729
''Everybody wants you.''

1611
01:41:57,769 --> 01:41:58,793
