1
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,583
Help

2
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,459
Nothing

3
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:49,300
''Did he call?
- No, he came while you were asleep''

4
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,298
''He was going to the club,
he'll be back late''

5
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,360
When did you come?
Are you all right?

6
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,097
Why do you do this to me?
- What did l do? l came for you

7
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,342
You were asleep. What's the matter?
- You know l hate seeing you with Anita

8
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,276
What do l lack in?
What do seek in Anita?

9
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,117
Anita and her husband are
my business partners

10
00:05:55,288 --> 00:06:01,716
ls kissing necessary in business?
- We cracked a good deal

11
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,861
''Just celebrating, what's wrong?''

12
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:10,660
Such an old-fashioned outlook.
- Your father liked my outlook...

13
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,873
when he came to see me in Mumbai.
And you too. What did you see in me?

14
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,934
A pretty woman who was working
for an art gallery

15
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,471
Someone who was interacting
with intelligent folks

16
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,140
l took you for one of those girls
who move with the times

17
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,318
We're standing in the 21st century.
l want to take you ahead

18
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,547
And you're holding me back?
Why don't you change

19
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:38,821
''lf it strengthens our relationship,
l'm willing. But not a change...''

20
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:43,094
that brings us to shame before
each other. l can't become Anita

21
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,115
l love this place

22
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,123
l love you very much

23
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,127
Very much

24
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,141
And l love my independence
just as much

25
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,077
That's why l stay far away
from my father

26
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:39,581
Why don't you understand Vaidehi?
Just understand. Then you won't mind

27
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,086
Let go.
- l'm your husband

28
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,093
You didn't think of that when
you were kissing Anita?

29
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,331
Forget Anita. l'm not in love
with Anita. l'm in love with you

30
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:56,339
''What was that? Lust? Love one,
lust for someone else?''

31
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,500
''Someone at home,
someone outside?''

32
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,109
Let go

33
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,783
Leave me

34
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,457
''Raghu, leave me''

35
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,591
''l may be your husband's family
doctor. But to me, you're a sister''

36
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,162
''When you called me to say that
you have a fever, l felt...''

37
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,330
''from the tone of your voice,
something else is bothering you''

38
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,837
That's why l asked you to see me
here instead of coming to the clinic

39
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,166
To let you talk your heart out
to your brother

40
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,905
Just give me a prescription
for an ache and a fever

41
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,512
l've informed the nurse.
Go down to the clinic

42
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,622
Take an injection and leave blood
and urine samples for testing

43
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:22,517
''But tell me, do your parents know
that Raghu assaults you?''

44
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,461
No

45
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,928
Hurry up! l've chosen a fur coat
for you. The shop will close down

46
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,135
l don't want it?
- Don't want it? l select...

47
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,468
''a 40,000 dollar furcoat for you
and you say you don't want it?''

48
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:41,138
''Nice dresses, expensive jewellery,
big homes, London-America''

49
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,547
That's what parents look for when
they give their daughters away

50
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,144
But is that all a woman expects
from her husband?

51
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,150
''What else? Poverty, suffering?''

52
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,057
''Must you always talk in riddles?
Anyway, pack some woollens''

53
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,496
lt'll be cold where we're going.
- l've packed for you

54
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,425
l'm talking about you.
- l'm not coming

55
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,133
Over and over again!
Never happy

56
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,500
''When he was a child of ten,
his mother passed away''

57
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,412
''Grew up in boarding school, became
stubborn. Been like this ever since''

58
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:21,178
Just like his father.
Your mother-in-law too...

59
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,414
found it difficult when she came
to America for the first time...

60
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:29,358
after getting married.
But she adapted to my lifestyle

61
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,354
''You too will adapt, and Raghu will
get to understand you''

62
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:40,136
Once he begins to understand that
l'm human. He thinks l'm a machine

63
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,136
''Like his car, to drive anywhere,
anytime, at will''

64
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,945
He ignores my feelings

65
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:59,489
''Minor incidents. Happen. You are
Raghu's wife, the honour of our family''

66
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,816
You will carry the lineage forth

67
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,428
''lf you don't accompany him,
people will talk''

68
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,164
lt's important that you
accompany him and you shall

69
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:23,514
''Lost in love...''

70
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:31,388
''he's benumbed''

71
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:41,132
''l pine for him...''

72
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:48,132
''he's unaffected''

73
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,411
''Come''

74
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,674
''Come to me''

75
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,116
''Oh come to me''

76
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:53,798
''Don't make me pine like this''

77
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,309
''Why is the fire so chilling?''

78
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,814
''Why is pain so sweet?''

79
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,146
''Why are stars so mischievous?''

80
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,377
''Tell me''

81
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,620
''Why is the breath so hot?
Why are these lips so soft?''

82
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,332
''Touch me, my love''

83
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:29,866
''Tell me''

84
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,835
''My tousled tresses...''

85
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,099
''caress''

86
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,437
''Don't spurn me, my love''

87
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,114
''Take...''

88
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,282
''take away...''

89
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:52,117
''take may heart away''

90
00:14:53,325 --> 00:15:01,130
''Don't make me thirst''

91
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,844
''Someone's thirsting...''

92
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,113
''with hopes in the heart...''

93
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,120
''looking for a lover...''

94
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,625
''my love''

95
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,126
''ln midnights' past...''

96
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,462
''we'll talk...''

97
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,137
''when every moment,
l have...''

98
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,637
''my love''

99
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,945
''This love...''

100
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,138
''do not spurn''

101
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,147
''My love...''

102
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,319
''give me one bright moment''

103
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,088
''Don't...''

104
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,951
''make me so pensive''

105
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:45,435
''Don't leave me aching''

106
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,969
''Come''

107
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,114
''Come to me''

108
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:01,912
''Oh come to me''

109
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:10,119
''Don't make me pine like this''

110
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,578
Raghu and Anita know
how to live it up

111
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:43,494
You don't mind your wife with
my husband? Like this...?

112
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:51,765
l love my wife dearly. lf l mind it
if she's happy in Raghu's company...

113
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:59,103
''what love would that be? l say,
forget religion. Join me''

114
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,979
''We too could, like Raghu and Anita...''

115
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,936
''Where are you going, Vaidehi?''

116
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,538
What is the matter?
- Let's go home

117
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,144
And desert my own party?

118
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,147
''l don't like this crowd,
with people like Rahul and Anita''

119
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,922
What problem do you have with Rahul?
- He was suggesting

120
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:49,150
Just like you go around
with his wife...

121
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,159
l too...

122
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,160
''could, with him''

123
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,042
''When he said whatever he said,
he was in his senses''

124
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,609
''Whatever he might say, nothing's
happening without your consent''

125
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,744
My consent?

126
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,178
You have no objections?

127
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,183
Your friend! Someone who ought to
consider me his sister-in-law...

128
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,692
''speaks to me in this mien,
and you have no objections?''

129
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,634
Every man wants to have
a relationship with a pretty woman

130
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,298
''You're exotic. He gave it a try,
he failed''

131
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,942
''Sure, l'm old-fashioned. But...''

132
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:42,375
''your outlook is filthy, despicable!
- Let's discuss outlook later''

133
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,676
Everyone's waiting.
- l'm not going anywhere with you

134
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,949
What face will l have left if
l stand out there all alone?

135
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,492
l'm not going anywhere near
folks like Rahul and Anita

136
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,732
We've invited Rahul and Anita.
How can l throw them out?

137
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,166
That's up to you

138
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,164
l'm not going

139
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,978
''Over every little issue,
you try to blackmail me?''

140
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,184
Twenty first century!

141
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,124
Regret you will

142
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,400
No place in my home for someone
who doesn't care for my prestige

143
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,554
Mr Raghu has asked you
to return to lndia

144
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,324
His father doesn't wish
to discuss this with you

145
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,159
Please come

146
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,944
How is Raghu?

147
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,846
Out of danger. But...
- What...?

148
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,384
ls he married?
- Yes

149
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,478
Any children?
- Not yet

150
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:10,157
He might lead a normal married life.
But he will never become a father

151
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,165
You should not have returned.
- ls this not my home?

152
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,399
''No, once married, the woman's home
is her husband's home''

153
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,609
Your Daddy is right

154
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:35,576
''The home a woman enters after marriage,
she ought to leave only in death''

155
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,914
''She's troubled as it were, and you...
- Shut up Pinky''

156
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,855
''Had your sister cared for you,
she wouldn't have returned like this''

157
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:51,132
Who will marry you after this?
- People will point fingers

158
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:59,375
They will talk. You must go back.
The honour of our family...

159
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,936
is in your hands.
- As also your husband's honour

160
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:09,143
''l understand. ln every family, it's
the woman who shoulders the honour''

161
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,312
But the woman has no honour

162
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:21,162
''Such a vast property, and
l have no heir after Raghu''

163
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,160
What are you saying?
Your daughter-in-law is pregnant

164
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,166
Vaidehi is pregnant?

165
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:33,440
l tested her blood and urine.
You didn't see the report?

166
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,779
l don't see Vaidehi.
Where is she?

167
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,577
Have you called Vaidehi?
- No

168
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,308
Why haven't you called her?
- Why should l call her?

169
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,113
Won't you inform her about
your accident?

170
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:52,654
Forget it Dad. She doesn't care for me.
Why tell her about my accident?

171
00:23:53,131 --> 00:24:00,594
''Don't talk like that, son. Call her up.
- lt's over between us''

172
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,137
She's your wife. Don't you talk
like that of her

173
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,539
Vaidehi isn't returning

174
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,675
''l'll marry ten times over,
if that's what you want''

175
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,482
But not an heir.
Only Vaidehi can deliver that

176
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:39,635
''l didn't want to tell you this way,
but doctors say, you can't father''

177
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:52,322
''Son, l've just come to know that
Vaidehi is pregnant''

178
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:59,691
''She's carrying your child. That's
why l suggested, you call her over''

179
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,130
Save our family from extinction

180
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:13,701
''Let her have the baby. Once we have
our child, and if she insists...''

181
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:18,579
''on disobeying her, divorce her.
Marry again. Live as you like''

182
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,143
Who's stopping you? lf she raises
a hue and cry over the child...

183
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,155
we can have her bumped off

184
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:55,849
''Raghu my boy! Yes, l'm fine son.
How are you? Bless you, son''

185
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,122
''Yes Vaidehi is here, right here.
One minute''

186
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,118
Raghu is calling. Come on

187
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,930
''Vaidehi, l know you're cross,
very cross''

188
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,133
''l've made you suffer,
and God has punished me''

189
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,940
l met with an accident

190
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,810
What...? When...?

191
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,743
''Are you all right?
- Yes, l'm alive''

192
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:31,880
All by dint of your virtuosity

193
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,825
l'm coming

194
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,088
Tomorrow

195
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,258
Tomorrow...?
- Yes tomorrow

196
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,100
l've organised everything.
My manager in Mumbai will escort you

197
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,382
She's coming

198
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,053
Send Vaidehi over with Fakhruddin.
Tomorrow

199
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,564
''Fakhruddin is an idiot, and he
has never been abroad''

200
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,262
Send him. She will enjoy
Fakhruddin's company

201
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,702
That's important

202
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,808
Why are you crying?

203
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,274
''Fakhru, don't go away''

204
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,681
Don't leave us

205
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,417
''Shut up! l'm not leaving
this world, am l?''

206
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,812
''For the first time, l'm going
abroad! To America!''

207
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,889
Send me off with a smile.
Crying...?

208
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,086
What's it?
- lt's a long journey to America

209
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:52,267
''How will you travel alone?
- l'm flying, not walking''

210
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,101
Shut up!

211
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,767
My baby...

212
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,634
''Bless you, son''

213
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:09,109
''Whom are you leaving me with?
- Salma dear, don't overact. Shut up''

214
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:15,920
''Fakhru my son, mark my words, never
break a woman's heart''

215
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:23,300
''Ominous is a woman's curse.
- Sure mother, l'll be back''

216
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:31,939
''My baby, my sweet boy!''

217
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:36,136
l'll miss my plane. l'll buy you
a shopful of sweets when l return

218
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,479
Farewell

219
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:47,147
This is scared vermilion.
Have Raghu put it on you

220
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,966
Be happy

221
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:03,167
Just remember that he means
everything to you

222
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,842
That's your home. Not this

223
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,173
''Come, my child''

224
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,848
Where's the New York check-in counter?
- New York check-in counter?

225
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,949
Yes

226
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,529
Looking for a platform?
Worked the railways before this?

227
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,473
''Vaidehi, where are you calling from?
- Airport, Mumbai''

228
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,134
''l'm coming to New York.
- No, don't come here now''

229
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:46,743
Why...?
- You tested positive

230
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,576
You're pregnant

231
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,153
''Have you told Raghu?
- Yes, and now it has become...''

232
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:00,163
''a big problem for you.
- What are you saying, doctor?''

233
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,593
''After the accident, we've come to know
that Raghu can never father a child''

234
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,837
Raghu and his father want
your baby for an heir

235
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,970
That's why they are calling you.
They are very powerful

236
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,842
They can do anything here

237
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:23,184
''What am l to do, doctor?
- Take my advice. Don't come here''

238
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,515
And don't take any steps before
you consult a good lawyer over there

239
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,132
Have you had a chat with the boss?
- Yes

240
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,806
Shall we? lt's time for the flight.
- Sister-in-law! Congratulate me!

241
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,305
l've just seen an international
boarding card for the first time

242
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,141
Now no one's stopping me
from going to America

243
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,414
l'm feeling sick.
l can't go today

244
00:30:55,153 --> 00:31:00,147
''No, we must. lt's time for the flight.
- No, l'll go later''

245
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:05,155
No problem. Just relax. l'll go over
and tell Mr Raghu

246
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,962
Quiet! l'm going over.
l'll explain to the boss

247
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,728
''Fakhru, you are accompanying the lady.
Please come. Boss' orders''

248
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,834
We'll put a doctor on the flight

249
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,166
Let me use the washroom

250
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,170
''Fakhru, get a wheelchair''

251
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,411
This baby is mine

252
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,141
l have a right to it

253
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,649
l'm not giving this baby to anyone

254
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,153
Never

255
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,689
What do l do? Where do l go?

256
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,030
''Once married, the woman's home
is her husband's home''

257
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,660
''No place in my home for someone
who doesn't care for my prestige''

258
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:27,172
''Raghu and his father want
your baby for an heir''

259
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,927
''Has Vaidehi boarded the plane?
- No sir, she...''

260
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,119
''Why not?
- She spoke you, didn't she?''

261
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,797
l didn't speak to her.
- But she did speak to someone

262
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,734
''Then she suddenly says she's unwell,
and she'll go after a couple of days''

263
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,370
''l'm reasoning with her,
but she isn't willing''

264
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,804
Where is she?
- ln the toilets. l'm waiting outside

265
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,403
lt's the ladies'

266
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,949
''Come on, sit''

267
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,155
''Fakhru, this isn't for me.
Go to the ladies' toilet''

268
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,495
l respect you for being my superior.
But you needn't dictate...

269
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:23,158
my toilet-using habits. Why Ladies?
l'll use the Gents

270
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,501
We only got to see whether
madam is in there or not

271
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,124
Let the truck leave

272
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,466
The lady is making trouble.
The boss is going on calling

273
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:04,132
l don't know what to do...
- Forget her! l fell because of you

274
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:09,512
Have you seen a woman hereabouts?
- You call her a lady

275
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,480
Have you seen the lady?
We're travelling to New York

276
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:17,553
Have you seen a woman in blue?
- Not here

277
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,014
Have you seen any vehicles leave?
- Our trucks just left for Nagpur

278
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,817
Carrying oranges?
- No

279
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,325
''l see, they bring oranges from there''

280
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,993
''Give the phone to Vaidehi.
- Sir, we're looking for him''

281
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:40,337
We came to the cargo section
looking for her. Seems that...

282
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,575
some trucks just left for Nagpur.
She might've taken one of them

283
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,914
Go to Nagpur right away

284
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,121
l'm coming to lndia

285
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:56,116
What did he say?
- We're going to Nagpur

286
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,119
Go on. l'll carry the information
to New York

287
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,129
Nagpur is 26 hours away.
New York is 16 hours. l'll be back

288
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,928
l'm not doing ajob
that takes me to Nagpur

289
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,465
Coming

290
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,095
''On which road...''

291
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,098
''to which city...''

292
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,394
''are you going?''

293
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:46,102
''Gazing into the distance...''

294
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,578
''with tired eyes;
home is far away''

295
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,707
''Lonely...''

296
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,744
''moments...''

297
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,384
''after leaving the caravan...''

298
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,914
''on which road...''

299
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,854
''to which city...''

300
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,721
''am l headed?''

301
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:20,137
''Officer, check each
and every vehicle''

302
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,935
Unload them

303
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:26,549
Stop staring at me. Tell your
constables to get to work

304
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,816
We must find the lady

305
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,246
Forget the horses.
Find the lady

306
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:36,491
''Check all the trucks, down to the
last one. l repeat, search it''

307
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,088
Can't l board another flight
on this card?

308
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,894
No.
- Then what to do with this?

309
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,608
There she is

310
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,850
She's running away

311
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,819
''Not to fear. l'm not the police,
l'm a thief''

312
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:53,298
What are you trying to get away with?
- Nothing stolen. l'm trying to save...

313
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,268
what's mine

314
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,780
''Not to worry. He's alive,
just knocked out''

315
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,510
Half a biscuit knocked him out

316
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,919
My special biscuit

317
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,615
Laced

318
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,721
Cost-effective and reliable.
By the time you're halfway through...

319
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,127
you're asleep. My Biscuit Number One

320
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,624
You got a pin?

321
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,537
Yes

322
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:37,140
''He's a colleague. l steal by night,
he steals by day''

323
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,141
Wonderful! Opened up

324
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,144
Your pin just worked a wonder

325
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,491
''All of 50,000! Makes my life''

326
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,432
You get a cut. Ten percent.
Keep five thousand

327
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,168
Hire charges for your pin. Keep it.
- No! l'm not taking this

328
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:11,506
''Then l'll owe you a favour,
and l hate that''

329
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,973
''No, l'm not taking.
- Take it, please''

330
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,179
Open each and every shop. Check.

331
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,718
My boss is connected right up
to the prime minister

332
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,186
Come with me

333
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,520
l'll run. l'll divert their attention.
You just have to walk out

334
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,933
''We owe each other nothing,
score settled''

335
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,180
You... here...?
- l'm looking for a girl

336
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,807
This is another policeman.
He won't recognise you

337
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,478
''He's a freeloader. He'll eat,
take a tip and leave''

338
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:58,478
''At weddings, thieves sneak in too.
No, l'm just doing time-pass here''

339
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,151
''Hello, Aunt.
- Bless you son''

340
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,153
Are you staring at my coat?
lt's two-in-one

341
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,325
Black inside for black deed.
Social checks out here

342
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:12,969
''Would you like a cold drink?
Hey, won't you offer the lady a drink?''

343
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:18,335
''At weddings, cold drinks are fun.
Everyone having a good time?''

344
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:23,341
A relative's wedding?
- l don't believe in relationships

345
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:26,606
''l got an appointment at two.
Until then, time-pass''

346
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,177
''And to keep suspicions at bay,
a bit of conversation''

347
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,851
We're still the same
we were. Strangers

348
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,457
''How did you know who's from the boy's
family, and who's from the girl's?''

349
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,688
''Simple. Those going around
with folded hands, bowing...''

350
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:42,288
are from the girl's family.
The proud ones belong to the boy's

351
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,126
You don't believe? Take a look

352
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:54,135
l can even tell you who
the girl's father is

353
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,138
Tell me.
- The fellow with a drooping moustache

354
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,015
The peak of his urban is askew
like a cock's crown

355
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,408
And he sports a smile despite being
as helpless as a sacrificial goat...

356
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:08,820
and goes around apologising
to everyone is the bride's father

357
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:13,827
''Forgive me, the journey must've
been tiresome. Burt what could l do?''

358
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,394
l booked the hall right besides
Sudama Hall near the railway station

359
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:20,560
Sudama Hall? Sounds so depressing.
What might it be like?

360
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:26,006
''No, the venue was fine. But
the bridegroom's father insisted...''

361
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:31,343
on Laxmibai Hall. lt cost me thrice
as much. But l'm satisfied

362
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:36,919
This place is grand! The bride's room
is grand. And the bridegroom's...

363
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,784
Want to know who
the bridegroom's father is? Ask me

364
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:46,792
Tell me.
- His whiskers point at 11:05 am

365
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:52,527
''He wears a turban poised like a snake,
and he's chesting out at 45 inches''

366
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,403
''He's strutting about as if he's
constipated, and if...''

367
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,667
''he's threatening people over everything,
then he's the bridegroom's father''

368
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,072
There

369
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,147
Shall we leave the wedding?
- Forgive me

370
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,479
The chairs have been organised.
- Why didn't you order...

371
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:14,489
''a few hundred more beforehand?
Look, my guests are standing''

372
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:20,324
''Forgive me, you gave me a list of
500 guests. l ordered 700 chairs''

373
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,490
Looks like some more have arrived.
- You expect them to get their chairs?

374
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,502
''Tell me, you expect them to bring
their food along too?''

375
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:31,341
Please do not say that...
- lf you can't afford as little...

376
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,433
why did you enter into
an alliance with us?

377
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,369
''No dearth of girls for my son,
was there, Damodar?''

378
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,448
Yes brother-in-law...?
- Any dearth of girls for my son?

379
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:44,450
Not at all. There was a long queue!
Each better than the other

380
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,613
And their fathers were rich!
- Heard that?

381
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,348
''Say, do we leave?
- Shall we...?''

382
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,452
''Excuse me, the chairs are coming.
Let me see''

383
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,130
Why aren't the chairs here yet?

384
00:43:55,466 --> 00:44:00,130
l guess l'm in the right place!
ls this a wedding?

385
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:05,465
''No, they're mourning their dead.
- Wrong venue again''

386
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:13,311
''Nekchand makes me run all over town!
Where do l find you, Nekchand?''

387
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:17,577
''Hey, where are you off to?
- To find my friend Nekchand''

388
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,955
''Hey, that's you Nekchand!
- Lay the chairs. You're late''

389
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,360
People are leaving.
- Leaving...?

390
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,953
ls the bridegroom's father
Mr Hazarilal?

391
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,064
''He is, and how many times
do l tell you that?''

392
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:33,102
l know all about him! He has deserted
weddings twice already

393
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,262
''l'm not letting him do it again,
don't you worry''

394
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,537
l'll have his guests glued to their
chairs. Anyone who gets up is dead

395
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:46,549
The bridespeople must behave.
- Who the hell are bridespeople?

396
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,312
We're the bridespeople.
- Bridespeople? Are we...?

397
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,444
Yes.
- Then l'll behave myself

398
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,922
This is for Mr Damodar

399
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,452
Brother...
- Yes sister?

400
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,662
This is for you.
- For me?

401
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:06,660
Oh l forgot your maidservant's name...
- You mean Basanti?

402
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,132
''Yes...
- Basanti, take this''

403
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:13,137
And this is for you.
Two sarees and a shawl

404
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,835
May l take a look?
- Certainly. Please see

405
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:19,138
l selected them personally. For you.
- l see

406
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,148
That's bronzed silk. From Benares

407
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:31,958
Not by the looks of it. l only wear
Kanjivaram silks

408
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:37,090
''Basanti, keep these for yourself.
And the shawl too''

409
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,793
''Your father works as a nightwatchman,
right? lt'll be useful for him''

410
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,299
Being put to good use.
- Why of course...

411
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,707
l'll buy another pair for you.
Nice ones

412
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:56,111
''You're too hesitant. Eat.
- No, you go on''

413
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,511
''ln the first place,
let's get informal''

414
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,451
''And eat, enjoy, like everyone else''

415
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:08,121
You think all these people are here
to bless the couple?

416
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:13,129
''Everyone has a purpose to be here.
Look, over there''

417
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,834
l don't want this rotten suit!
And also return your saree

418
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,737
We're leaving.
- Why should l leave?

419
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,140
l like the saree. You leave
if you want to

420
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,040
You'll ditch your husband
for a saree?

421
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,441
You're insulting me!
- Goodness!

422
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,089
What happened?
- What's the matter with her?

423
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,887
l don't know. Suddenly...
- Fetch a glass of water

424
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,554
l'll take care of her

425
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,091
''Drink up, you'll feel fine.
- Shall l take her to a doctor?''

426
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:48,500
She doesn't need a doctor.
She isn't sick

427
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,533
''One minute, aren't you Bansidhar's son?''

428
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,774
The one who runs the flour mill

429
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:03,450
''l tell myself, why does he look
so familiar?''

430
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:10,458
''Like father, like son. Careless.
The poor thing is pregnant''

431
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,592
''And he drags her here,
makes her stand in a crowd''

432
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:18,295
Let her be comfortable.
Give her the goodies

433
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,127
''Of all the father's duties,
do some at least''

434
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,130
Moron

435
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:31,075
''l'm sorry, because of me...
- Never mind. But in this condition...''

436
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:39,486
Does your husband know you're carrying?
- Yes. That's why l'm here

437
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:56,099
l read somewhere that cigarette smoke
is injurious for babies

438
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,671
Let me get you some fruit

439
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,775
Forgive me

440
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:07,106
''Why are you apologising to me?
l'm your wife. Well, what's up?''

441
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:11,787
''Got to dish out another 20,000 for
the reception. Get me the cash. Quick''

442
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,114
''No way! We've already spent 20,000
out of the amount for the dowry''

443
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:22,463
What are you doing? Wasting money?
Refuse him. Don't touch the dowry

444
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,124
That devil warned you at the outset.
He will walk out...

445
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,396
''if he isn't given 500,000 before
the conclusion of the wedding''

446
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,528
There's a lot of time to go
for the conclusion of the wedding

447
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,140
''lf he isn't given 20,000
he'll walk out right now''

448
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,937
''Let him walk.
- Saroj, listen! Give me 20,000''

449
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:39,411
l'll make good the shortfall.
l'm borrowing from someone. Hurry

450
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,815
l'm not going to spare you!
l've conned the whole world

451
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:47,956
You don't get away with conning me!
No sparing you!

452
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,752
Forgive me...
- No sparing you!

453
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:54,158
''l'll find him, somewhere l will!
No sparing you!''

454
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,024
ls it organised?
- lt will be organised

455
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:03,829
Will be organised? Not organised yet?
- You could say it's nearly organised

456
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:09,171
You better get one thing clearly.
The money should be in my hands...

457
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,510
exactly at quarter to five.
Only then the wedding is concluded

458
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:17,176
''Else, we're leaving. We're walking out.
- Why are you joking?''

459
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:24,993
l am not joking. Perhaps you don't know
that l walked out twice before

460
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,995
My father walked out thrice.
You understand?

461
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,133
Yes.
- How much did l say?

462
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,132
500000
- ln...?

463
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,964
Cash.
- ln currencies of...

464
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,537
Five hundreds.
- Brilliant

465
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,376
Make sure you eat coconut.
My mother used to say...

466
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:46,141
eating coconut gives you fair babies.
You eat too. Your son will be fair

467
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,944
What if it's a daughter?
- Eat even more coconut

468
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:53,384
''ln this country, the ugliest of men
look for the fairest of brides''

469
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:03,159
Wonderful! What a lovely gathering!
- That's what worries me

470
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,333
What...?
- Maybe you haven't provided for so many

471
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,838
But don't you water down the curries.

472
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,507
''lf you do, we leave.
The lovely gathering vanishes''

473
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,977
You're lucky to be watching
my last performance

474
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:24,177
''ln a while, l'll be collecting
my passport, visa and air ticket''

475
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,720
''a friend is giving me ajob in Dubai.
Tomorrow morning, l'm in Mumbai''

476
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:32,124
The evening flight takes me to Dubai.
And l'll try never to return

477
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,956
Forgive me! Thank God the bottles
didn't break

478
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,932
The bridegroom's friends ordered it.
- You...?

479
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,128
l'm Bansidhar's son.
- Who's Bansidhar?

480
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:44,933
''The flour miller.
- Hey, you're one of us!''

481
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,406
Will you please deliver it?
- l'll be back

482
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:52,405
Bansidhar's son? Grow so tall
in six months?

483
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,474
Greetings.
- Bansidhar's daughter-in-law?

484
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:58,477
Bless you. Now where was l going...?

485
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:05,959
Same song. Boring.
- You've sung it twice already

486
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:10,159
l'll sing it over and over again!
- You're creating a scene

487
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,961
Will you mar my wedding?
- What to do friend? l'm ruined

488
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:20,405
What happened? Tell me.
- No! lf l speak...

489
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:26,312
the skies will be rent asunder!
The earth will weep! May l have a drink?

490
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,784
No! Booze is over.
- Here's as much as you want

491
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,785
Why did you have to walk in now?
- You should've come earlier

492
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,117
l just found out you're short of beer.
- Who are you?

493
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,792
Bansidhar's son.
- Bansidhar...?

494
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:43,395
Flour miller. What's your problem?
- My friend is drunk

495
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,392
l hope he doesn't create a scene.
- What's his name?

496
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,128
Gulshan

497
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,463
''You take care of this,
l'll take care of him''

498
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:58,013
Friend is friend no more.
- Why are you getting so emotional?

499
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:03,482
''The girl l was in love with,
is going to my friend''

500
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:09,153
She has betrayed you?
- Not exactly

501
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:16,161
She didn't know l was in love with her.
- Your friend stabbed you in the back?

502
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:23,504
Not exactly. He didn't know
that l fell on the sword

503
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,498
What's your problem?

504
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,907
''How are you, my child?''

505
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,908
Have you eaten?
- Yes

506
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:35,914
Where's your husband?
- Oh let me tell you...

507
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,852
Say what? You're getting bored
sitting alone

508
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,456
Take this and come with me
to the bride's room

509
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,682
You're looking so pretty

510
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,695
''What's going on?
- Look aunt, she's so pretty''

511
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:52,128
Oh l'm glad! Our bride looks
so pretty

512
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:58,633
''This is Nekchand's daughter, Maithili.
And she's... what's your name my child?''

513
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,304
Vaidehi

514
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:05,141
What a wonderful coincidence!
Two girls named after Sita together!

515
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,143
She's Vaidehi...
- Oh yes! And l'm Maithili

516
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,475
Both named after Sita

517
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:13,311
Hello sister! Never met you before.
- She's Bansidhar's daughter-in-law

518
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,152
Bansidhar who...?
- The flour miller

519
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:24,562
Girls! Listen. Take good care of her.
Keep feeding her. She's pregnant

520
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,938
''What do you want? Boy or girl?
- Boy, of course''

521
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:33,269
''Shut up! Let me ask her.
- No, we do the asking''

522
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:37,536
No! Who's getting married?
You get to ask at your wedding

523
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,342
l get to ask her today

524
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:43,449
Why can't we ask her?
- Just because you're the bride?

525
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:49,449
Yes. Today's my day.
- Only today. After the wedding...

526
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:53,461
the days and nights will be his.
- That's just what l want

527
00:53:54,130 --> 00:54:00,126
''Come on girls, are you singing or not?
Come on, take the drums''

528
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,466
The queen mother's orders.
- Play the trumpets

529
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:09,373
''lf l curse you, you'll end up with
blind and deaf husbands''

530
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:14,810
Come on.
- You must sit with me

531
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:20,546
Was yours a love marriage too?
- ls yours a love marriage?

532
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:24,953
Not entirely. Fifty-fifty.
- What do you mean?

533
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:30,098
We were in college together.
We started liking each other

534
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,834
''The families got to know,
an alliance was talked about''

535
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,904
''And today, l'm getting married.
- Are you glad?''

536
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:42,534
''Elated! What more does a girl want?
A good husband, a nice home''

537
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,207
And a lovely child.
- Just one child?

538
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:50,576
''You too are glad, aren't you
about becoming a mother?''

539
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,023
''Your husband must be
loving you dearly, no?''

540
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:14,571
''lf you wanted me to become
a stranger to you...''

541
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:22,142
''tell me Mother, why did you
endear me so?''

542
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,594
''Henna on my hands''

543
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,426
''The dot on my forehead''

544
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,136
''l've hennaed my hands''

545
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,866
''l'm wearing a dot''

546
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,874
''My bangles are chiming''

547
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,740
''My anklets are clinking''

548
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:29,141
''l want to sing the song of love''

549
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:39,895
''l want to go
to my beloved's house''

550
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:43,497
''Yes, l want to go
to my beloved's house''

551
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,383
''At birth to our parents...''

552
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,990
''we are estranged''

553
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,990
''Oh what fate is the daughter's''

554
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,880
''ln a moment, l'll sever
all relationships''

555
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,423
''l'm leaving my father's house''

556
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:55,100
''The rest of my life l'll spend
in the land of my beloved''

557
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:58,899
''l'm leaving for
my beloved's house''

558
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:02,509
''Yes, l'm leaving for
to my beloved's house''

559
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,898
''But it's a daughter's destiny...''

560
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,940
''that makes them weep''

561
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:40,147
''The child they bore will be
borne away by someone''

562
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:51,483
''l'm leaving for
my beloved's house''

563
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:55,357
''Yes, l'm leaving for
to my beloved's house''

564
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:04,329
What would've happened had l eaten
an entire biscuit?

565
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,337
He wants biscuits! Would you
like some biscuits?

566
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,512
You'll feed me biscuits?!
Scoundrel!

567
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:20,782
Let go! Why are you fighting?
- l was trying to be of help

568
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,517
l offered him biscuits.
- Not biscuits again!

569
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,725
No mentioning biscuits!
- No mention

570
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,460
''Mr Gulabchand, why are so worked up
over biscuits?''

571
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:37,937
''This evening, while
l was locking up my shop...''

572
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:42,942
''in walks a boy who looks like
a filmi hero, and he says...''

573
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:46,948
''he's Dewanchand's man.
Maybe l said, and l said...''

574
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,742
Come in. Sit

575
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,752
Show me the necklace.
How much do you need?

576
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:57,049
''50,000 or so.
- This belongs to Dewanchand''

577
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,158
Have a biscuit.
- Biscuit...?

578
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,160
lt's his too.
- He makes biscuits too?

579
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,662
Yes

580
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,428
Eat

581
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,162
Tasty.
- lt is...?

582
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:26,187
''When l came around, l saw my safe
flung open, cleaned of 50,000''

583
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,181
And the necklace?
- lt was a fake

584
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,386
But this biscuit is real.
That's why l assaulted him

585
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:39,831
l'm going to make mincemeat of you!
- Bridespeople ought to be humble

586
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,460
What bridespeople?
- We're the bridespeople

587
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:49,472
''Oh yes, hit me.
- l feel like it, but l won't''

588
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,638
Hit me!
- We're the bridespeople

589
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,946
l'll spare you.
- You hit me! Or l hit you

590
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,146
What happened?

591
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:02,948
What's the problem?

592
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,822
Him...

593
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,154
''He's the biscuit-wallah,
the scoundrel!''

594
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,426
Where did he go?

595
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:18,172
What happened Mr Gulabchand?
- Have you seen the biscuit-wallah?

596
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,399
You'd like some biscuits?
- No

597
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:24,376
No biscuits! Biscuit-wallah! Police!

598
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,351
Where's the biscuit-wallah?

599
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,856
Found it!
- Where?

600
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:40,118
''Got myself a sweet.
- No, the biscuit-wallah''

601
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,598
Must be upstairs

602
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,126
Where is he... where?

603
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,146
Don't scream. l'm a thief.
But you needn't be afraid

604
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:11,492
''l needed 50,000 to buy ajob in Dubai.
So l robbed a moneylender''

605
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:14,154
Knocked him out with a laced biscuit.
But bad-luck's very bad

606
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:19,495
And he's right here with the police.
l'll leave once he's gone

607
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,431
l hope you aren't afraid anymore

608
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,639
Blink if you mean yes.
Promise me not to scream

609
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:33,372
l'll be out in a while

610
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,111
Gulshan... you?
- Yes Maithili

611
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,447
What are you doing?
- What l am doing?

612
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:48,655
''What have you done Maithili, and why?
- What have l done?''

613
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:58,334
''Maithili, you broke my heart! l failed
college thrice, just to be with you''

614
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:01,609
''And today, you marry Atul?
- What nonsense is this?''

615
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:08,147
''Actually Maithili, l love you.
l've always loved you''

616
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:12,410
And today l'm marrying you.
- Get out this moment!

617
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:16,959
''Else, l'll scream!
- Call everyone, the whole world...''

618
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,152
for me to bare my soul
before everyone

619
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:23,626
Only one goddess reigns
in my heart. Maithili

620
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:32,107
My friend! We've met.
But what are you doing here?

621
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:38,103
l went to fetch biscuit for you.
You haven't had a bite all day

622
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:40,108
Eat a biscuit

623
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,314
Tasty

624
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:47,115
One for my wife

625
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,754
Cost-effective. Reliable

626
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,558
By the time you're halfway through
you're asleep. My Biscuit Number One

627
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:02,127
There were no other options.
- But what do we do with him now?

628
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:04,796
What will folks say
if they get to know...

629
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,307
''that there are two men with me,
one standing, one in bed...?''

630
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:13,141
First let's take care of the man
in bed. Let's take care of you

631
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:25,152
He's taking a comfortable ride
in civic waste

632
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,020
l'll be on my way.
- One minute...

633
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,154
What happened?
- Let me see if anyone's around

634
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,102
They're picketing right outside.
- Then where to go?

635
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,009
Wait here for a while
- You won't scream?

636
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,100
No

637
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:54,954
''Get me paper, pen and an envelope.
- For writing?''

638
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:56,614
To eat

639
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:02,390
What are you saying?
No! Don't say that! Not at this time

640
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,527
What happened?
- Deven just refused me

641
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:12,135
He was my last hope!
My heart is sinking

642
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,470
''Time l left, Vaidehi''

643
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,477
''Want me to drop you somewhere?
Where will you go, what will you do?''

644
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,645
''Haven't given it a thought, am l right?
- Yes...''

645
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,884
''Will you do something for me?
- Sure, tell me''

646
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:35,090
My mother lives in Haripur.
Deliver this envelope to her

647
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,430
''lt contains offerings to God,
and a letter addressed to her''

648
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,901
''And here, keep some money.
- No, l don't need money''

649
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,403
lt'll be useful for the trip.
lf you don't spend it...

650
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,703
''give it to my mother,
and tell her l'm fine''

651
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,111
The name and address are
on the envelope. One more thing

652
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,911
Don't forget to eat coconut

653
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,351
Where are you taking me?
- On moment...

654
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,115
''Tell me, what's the matter?
- Will you step inside please?''

655
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,118
Say it right here

656
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,124
Here's your money?
- All of it?

657
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:16,127
''You see, some extra expenses...''

658
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,004
''there's a shortfall of 50,000''

659
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:23,138
l've telephoned a friend.
He'll give it before the wedding

660
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:28,139
''lf he doesn't, l'll deliver the money
to you personally in two days. l swear''

661
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:33,421
Let the wedding happen after two days.
- No! Please don't do that

662
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:39,425
This is a matter of my honour!
lt's going to kill me

663
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:44,260
''l've said it so many times,
now l tell you for the last time''

664
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:48,096
Five minutes before the bridegroom
sits down for the wedding...

665
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:52,230
the entire money must be in my hands.
Else we're walking out

666
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,433
l understand.
- How much?

667
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:58,103
500000
- ln...?

668
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,908
Cash.
- ln wads of...?

669
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,914
Five hundreds

670
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,865
''l'll be leaving now, Vaidehi.
- But what happens now?''

671
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,577
''How will he get 50,000?''

672
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,877
Why are you staring at me?

673
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:39,580
''You expect me to give up 50,000?
l can't do it! Question doesn't arise''

674
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:45,493
He was saying he'll pay up in two days.
- By then someone else will have my job

675
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:49,488
l committed this robbery for the job.
You want me to thieve all my life?

676
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:54,799
Maithili's wedding is at stake. Think!
- Why should l think?

677
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:58,665
And why are you thinking? We walked
in here to evade the police

678
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:03,101
Doesn't make us their family members.
l belong to none of them. Farewell

679
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,466
''Maithili, hush''

680
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:34,474
l think there's only one option.
- l can't bear to see...

681
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:38,479
my father being humiliated like this.
- What kind of a boy is Atul?

682
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:40,877
He's nice

683
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,381
He loves you?
- Yes

684
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,751
''Then talk to him. lf he talks reason,
his father will surely agree''

685
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,691
Come in Atul.
- You wanted to see me?

686
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:01,163
Sit

687
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,171
''What is the matter, Maithili?''

688
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:11,578
There's a small problem.
l'm apprehensive about telling you

689
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:16,641
''Apprehensive about telling me?
ln a while, we'll be married''

690
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:22,180
''We're going to become life partners.
lf not me, whom will you tell?''

691
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,188
''You've taken a burden off my mind.
- Tell me, what is the problem?''

692
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:33,933
Papa has provided for whatever
your father demanded for the wedding

693
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:37,333
''Yes, l've seen. He has given
each and every thing''

694
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:41,138
Only one thing is lacking.
- What's lacking?

695
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:46,147
''He had demanded 500,000.
450,000 has been organised''

696
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:51,142
''There's a shortfall of 50,000.
My father wants a 2-day grace''

697
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,378
But your father refuses to agree.

698
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,147
You are the only one who
can reason with him.

699
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,818
''This is a huge problem, Maithili''

700
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:09,165
''Where's the problem? Papa isn't
refusing. Look, he's suffering from...''

701
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:12,729
blood pressure. So much tension is no
good for him. He's asking for 2 days

702
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:17,039
''Not a question of 2 days or 4 days,
it's a matter of principles''

703
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:21,114
''lf your father has promised to pay
500,000 today, he ought to pay up''

704
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:26,980
''And in our family, it's a tradition.
The elders decide the give-and-take''

705
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:33,128
''Youngsters have no say in the matter,
and l advise you not to say anything''

706
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:38,790
Leave everything to your father.
l'm sure he will find the money

707
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,999
l should be leaving

708
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:46,801
''And yes, l've finalised our honeymoon
in Mauritius. Everything will be fine''

709
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:51,478
Bye

710
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:05,883
''Have you brought the money?
- All of 50,000. Count it''

711
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,895
''l trust you, l do''

712
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:14,567
Sign these papers

713
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:17,836
You got a pen?

714
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,164
You got a pen right there

715
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:34,279
''You're beautiful too.
- Writes lovely, it's my lucky pen''

716
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,357
''Pen, change my luck''

717
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:40,926
Hurry up. We got to set out
for Bombay in an hour

718
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,530
Now you're settled in life

719
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:48,134
Leave the bottle. Out with the cash.
- Bitch! You've been after me...

720
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:51,638
''for an hour! Get lost, get laid.
- l'm not leaving without my money''

721
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,831
You bargain for one man
and you bring in four over

722
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,874
And you can't pay for it?
Out with the cash

723
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:59,378
Teaching me how to count?
Take what you've got and get lost

724
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,473
Or l'll snatch it away. Get lost.
- Snatch it? Like it's yours?

725
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,817
You know who l am?
l'll haul you in

726
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,823
You're a policeman. How can you
take sides with them?

727
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,062
''l left nothing undone to please you,
and when it comes to money...''

728
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,325
''you'll shortchange a poor girl?
Come on, let me have my money''

729
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,831
Just sign it. lt's routine here.
You want to take the flight or not?

730
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,562
l want it right now.
- l can't pay you right now

731
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,467
Why not?
- You want to get thrashed?

732
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,838
l'm not going unless
l'm given my money

733
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,704
What will you do with
so much money? Marry?

734
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:35,441
''No such luck, question being the same.
Money. What man marries without money?''

735
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:40,116
A poor girl has only two choices.
Poison yourself or get into the trade

736
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:44,120
''l'm doing this filthy job for my
sister's wedding, for her dowry''

737
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:49,928
Please let me have my money.
- First bring your sister here

738
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:53,329
''l'll pay you double rate.
- Why not your sister, you pimp?''

739
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:14,145
''You'll pay her. All of it.
- Who are you, brother?''

740
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:17,554
''Whoever l may be, you will
pay her right now''

741
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:21,025
l take care of her bookings.
Let me know if you need

742
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,961
''Hey, you don't know me?''

743
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,938
Clean out your pockets.
Give her the money

744
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,043
That chain too.
- lt's mine

745
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:24,483
Go back to your village.
- Thank you

746
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,927
''Listen, where are you off with the cash?
You won't find anotherjob like this''

747
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,497
Excuse me...

748
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,660
Looks like he's looking for someone
too. And he's more worked up than l am

749
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:39,997
''Excuse me, l'm looking for this woman.
- l'm out of this business''

750
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:44,376
Helping someone isn't bad business.
lt's a pious deed

751
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:47,106
Enough of piety for me.
l'm going to wash my sins

752
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:51,252
''l'm a troubled man, l've been troubled
all day. l must find this woman''

753
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:53,377
Don't talk of another woman

754
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:58,786
Help! Police!
- A policeman is beating you up

755
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,118
Goodness!

756
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:06,457
Robbers! Goons! Mafia! Underworld!
Brothers! Help!

757
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:14,133
We saw her getting off a truck at the
checkpost. After that we lost her

758
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:19,144
What did you do next?
- We informed the police

759
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,648
''They're combing the city.
Railway stations, bus stands, everywhere''

760
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:29,251
Waiting for you beside a phone booth
near Rani Laxmibai Hall

761
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:31,082
Stay there. l'm coming

762
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,768
Where's Mr Hazarilal?
- There. Seated

763
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,110
Where are you going?
- Nowhere

764
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,916
Yourjewellery?
- None of your concern

765
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,614
You aren't giving yourjewellery
away to Hazarilal

766
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:00,778
Who are you to stop me?

767
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,648
Tubelight

768
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:08,622
''Yes, tubelight. Takes me
a while longer to understand''

769
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,122
This time l took
a little longer to light up

770
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:15,126
And yourjob?
- You want the wedding to happen?

771
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:20,541
l want the same. Wear yourjewellery.
l'll give the money to Nekchand

772
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:23,477
What would you like?

773
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,041
Forgive me.
- Forgive you? l'm the one...

774
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:31,085
who ought to apologise.
- But the mistake was mine

775
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,416
''lrrespective, the bridespeople
are the ones who have to apologise''

776
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:37,922
''That's the rule, we apologise until
the bride has been sent off''

777
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,890
''Until the send-off,
we'll be grovelling''

778
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,825
l'm one of the bridespeople too.
- You too?

779
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,756
''l regret meeting you,
but who are you?''

780
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:49,366
l'm Bansidhar's son.
- Who's Bansidhar?

781
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,098
The flour miller.
- Bansidhar the miller?

782
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,332
''l'm the one,
the one and only''

783
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:08,285
Nice meeting. How is your son?
- My son is a disgrace

784
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:12,289
''He married a girl he wanted,
and he's gone. lf l find him...''

785
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,123
l'll put him through my grindmill!
- Do that. Bye

786
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,126
Where are you going? Who are you?
- l'm Bansidhar's father

787
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,733
''Now son, now father?
Goodness! Who are you?''

788
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:25,473
What goes on between father and son?
- l'm in a maze! Who am l?

789
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:28,007
Who are you? Who is he?
- Look Bansidhar...

790
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:32,341
your son is back home.
He isn't a prodigal

791
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:34,878
What else do you call him?
- You explain that to him

792
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:38,883
''Let me go and fetch my wife, Daddy.
- Daddy...? Wife...?''

793
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:41,078
l've met your daughter-in-law.
She's very nice

794
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:44,089
He isn't my son! So much for my
daughter-in-law. Who are you?

795
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:46,384
Have you met Mr Nekchand?
- l'm in trouble

796
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:48,552
What happened?
- Happened to meet my father

797
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,096
''Father...?
- Yes, Bansidhar''

798
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:53,096
''Luckily Mr Nekchand barged in.
Else, l would've been exposed''

799
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,259
Stop looking in that direction.
Come on

800
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,429
Whatever you can let me have
will be of great help

801
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:02,433
''l'll be obliged to you.
Whatever you can, please''

802
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,107
''Forgive me my child,
what is the matter?''

803
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:09,114
''Uncle, l'd like to speak to you.
- Yes, my child?''

804
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,987
l noticed something...
- l'm so confused about the wedding

805
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,988
l can't make out anything...

806
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,459
l just wanted to tell you that
l've never seen such a grand wedding

807
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:35,871
''No, you're saying that to please me.
- No uncle, really''

808
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:39,941
''You've taken care of everything,
right down to the smallest detail''

809
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,478
''Great food, great...''

810
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,810
''What happened, uncle?''

811
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,389
The first words of appreciation
ever since...

812
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:59,161
''l set out organising this wedding.
Else, everyone has been...''

813
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:05,165
Why only me? Every parent
starts preparing for this day...

814
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:11,974
''as soon as his daughter is born.
This decor, all this arrangement...''

815
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:18,176
wasn't done in four days. lt's a dream
l built moment by moment...

816
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:26,920
as l watched Maithili grow up.
l wouldn't leave anything lacking

817
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,793
''l'd give her everything,
and l've given her everything''

818
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:40,372
All except this... you see this doll?
l bought it for her...

819
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:45,310
when Maithili was three.
She looked exactly like it

820
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:54,316
''For me, she's still the same.
And this is all l'm keeping''

821
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:57,148
lt's all l'll be left with

822
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:06,658
''Mr Nekchand, it's time. Come.
- Please proceed. We'll join you''

823
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,833
''Come on, take the bag.
- The entire money isn't there''

824
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,837
Everything will work out fine.
Come along. Come

825
01:20:18,382 --> 01:20:19,713
Only then will the
wedding take place.

826
01:20:19,883 --> 01:20:22,374
May l sit in the mandap?
- Not yet the right time..

827
01:20:23,053 --> 01:20:24,384
lt's come.

828
01:20:24,788 --> 01:20:27,154
Give it to him.
- You took your own time.

829
01:20:28,392 --> 01:20:29,723
This..

830
01:20:30,127 --> 01:20:31,389
Total?

831
01:20:32,396 --> 01:20:34,057
Yes...no...

832
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,393
l tried my level best..
- No problem.

833
01:20:40,737 --> 01:20:43,001
We're not stone-hearted.

834
01:20:43,407 --> 01:20:47,070
They may not be 500 notes
but the money is all there.

835
01:20:47,744 --> 01:20:49,336
''Priest, start the chants.''

836
01:20:51,081 --> 01:20:52,343
Sit down.

837
01:21:29,386 --> 01:21:31,377
Sit with your beloved.

838
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:41,394
Count the notes in this bag.
Should be Rs. 500000.

839
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:44,890
The bank bundles too
have missing notes.

840
01:21:47,337 --> 01:21:48,668
Happy?

841
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:57,074
Found it! l've found my money!

842
01:21:57,681 --> 01:21:59,774
Found your stolen money?
- Yes! - Where?

843
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:02,009
ln the bag.
- My bag?

844
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:03,683
That's my money.

845
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:07,084
Your Rs. 450000 is in the bag.

846
01:22:07,357 --> 01:22:09,086
But these 5 bundles
of Rs. 100 are mine.

847
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:13,352
How do you know?
- The note had vermilion.

848
01:22:13,764 --> 01:22:15,356
Do you see it or not?

849
01:22:15,432 --> 01:22:17,366
Yes..
- Then it is mine!

850
01:22:18,035 --> 01:22:20,868
Thank you. Here's your bag.
- Just a minute.

851
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:23,095
Now what? - Nekchand!
- He's calling you.

852
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,366
He's calling you.
- Excuse me!

853
01:22:29,379 --> 01:22:32,871
Forgive me.
- Forgiveness comes later.

854
01:22:33,383 --> 01:22:35,647
''First tell me, the
500000 that you gave me..''

855
01:22:35,986 --> 01:22:38,181
He says 50000 in it is his.

856
01:22:38,388 --> 01:22:40,049
l only gave 450000.

857
01:22:41,391 --> 01:22:42,881
Drama..?

858
01:22:44,394 --> 01:22:47,329
Rs. 50000 was in this bag.
Stolen money.

859
01:22:47,664 --> 01:22:49,791
They are not mine.
l know nothing about it.

860
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,130
We'll know soon enough.
Priest stop the ceremony.

861
01:22:52,335 --> 01:22:54,326
No..
- Why did they stop the chants..?

862
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:57,738
Son Atul...

863
01:22:58,008 --> 01:22:59,339
Get up.

864
01:23:00,343 --> 01:23:02,675
Don't do this.
Don't stop the marriage.

865
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:05,678
This matter will be solved.
- lt's got more complicated.

866
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,344
Till we find out where
the stolen money came from..

867
01:23:09,619 --> 01:23:10,950
This marriage won't take place.

868
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:15,085
Also tell us where the
remaining 450000 came from.

869
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,123
My lodging and boarding
for 6 months has been fixed.

870
01:23:19,696 --> 01:23:21,186
Time to go to jail.

871
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:22,854
Do meet mother.

872
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:26,164
l swear by my daughter...

873
01:23:28,038 --> 01:23:31,371
l pawned everything l
owned to collect this sum.

874
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:35,367
l know nothing about the 50000.

875
01:23:35,712 --> 01:23:37,703
You are lying!
- He is speaking the truth.

876
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:39,814
l kept the money in the bag.

877
01:23:40,717 --> 01:23:43,151
Who is he? - Who knows?
- How did he come here?

878
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,052
Found him! He's the
one with the biscuit!

879
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:48,323
Are you Bansidhar's son?

880
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,652
l am nobody's son.

881
01:23:51,995 --> 01:23:53,326
l am a thief.

882
01:23:55,065 --> 01:23:58,330
l stole his money and gate crashed
into this wedding to escape the cops.

883
01:24:01,338 --> 01:24:05,001
''l come here to see that in the name
of customs, respected people of...''

884
01:24:05,342 --> 01:24:09,005
..society fleece the vulnerable
father of this innocent girl.

885
01:24:10,347 --> 01:24:11,780
l thought of helping them.

886
01:24:12,015 --> 01:24:13,346
He was short of 50000 in the dowry.

887
01:24:14,017 --> 01:24:17,009
l placed my loot in his bag.
He knows nothing about it.

888
01:24:17,354 --> 01:24:20,346
Enough! We've seen this
stale story in many films.

889
01:24:20,857 --> 01:24:22,188
Tell us the truth!

890
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:24,691
''Uncle, l'll tell the truth.''

891
01:24:25,962 --> 01:24:27,953
He's having an affair with Maithili!

892
01:24:28,098 --> 01:24:29,360
What nonsense!

893
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:32,167
l saw it myself!
He was in her room.

894
01:24:32,369 --> 01:24:34,360
They have a thing going!

895
01:24:35,372 --> 01:24:37,363
One more word and l'll..!

896
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,104
One minute...

897
01:24:40,777 --> 01:24:43,803
How did you know this thief
has something on with her?

898
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:46,645
l saw it myself.
- Listen..

899
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,041
He was in Maithili's room.

900
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,981
A stranger in the bride's room!

901
01:24:52,322 --> 01:24:54,813
For a whole hour!
- Listen to that!

902
01:24:55,325 --> 01:24:56,815
And the door was shut.

903
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:58,823
Now what can one say?
- lts a lie!

904
01:24:59,329 --> 01:25:01,092
He is lying! Accusing!

905
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:02,821
May maggots crawl over you!

906
01:25:03,066 --> 01:25:04,328
Ask the thief if l'm lying!

907
01:25:05,335 --> 01:25:07,326
Why ask the thief?
Ask this girl!

908
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,331
So? ls Gulu speaking the truth?

909
01:25:12,843 --> 01:25:14,834
Was the thief in your
room for a whole hour?

910
01:25:17,347 --> 01:25:19,076
What..are you saying?

911
01:25:19,749 --> 01:25:21,341
Now what do you say?

912
01:25:21,852 --> 01:25:24,343
Why are you bent on
reviling my little honour?

913
01:25:24,688 --> 01:25:27,020
You have no honour left.
Lost it all.

914
01:25:27,357 --> 01:25:29,348
Down the drain!
- That's enough.

915
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,828
Maligning a truthful girl
without knowing the truth!

916
01:25:34,364 --> 01:25:37,356
l hid in her room
to escape Gulabchand.

917
01:25:39,035 --> 01:25:40,366
l had no clue it was the bride's room.

918
01:25:41,371 --> 01:25:43,362
''Before this day, she had
never set eyes on me!''

919
01:25:43,707 --> 01:25:45,834
The poor thing doesn't
even know my name!

920
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:53,043
Maithili is a girl of good character.

921
01:25:54,651 --> 01:25:56,642
l beg you with folded hands..

922
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,651
Punish me anyhow.

923
01:25:58,989 --> 01:26:00,320
But complete the wedding formalities.

924
01:26:01,324 --> 01:26:03,815
We don't need a thief's
certificate to clear the girl!

925
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:08,320
Now the matter is of slander.

926
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:14,133
A stranger sat in your
daughter's room for an hour.

927
01:26:14,337 --> 01:26:15,929
And left leaving behind 50000.

928
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,103
Now what do we make of it?

929
01:26:19,342 --> 01:26:20,673
The same..

930
01:26:21,344 --> 01:26:23,175
One can't swallow a fly consciously.

931
01:26:24,347 --> 01:26:28,340
Still we feel sorry for you and
are ready to accept your child.

932
01:26:32,022 --> 01:26:33,353
Atul...

933
01:26:33,857 --> 01:26:35,188
Sit down.

934
01:26:38,695 --> 01:26:40,754
You are an angel! God!

935
01:26:43,033 --> 01:26:46,901
So we were already
short of 50000 bucks.

936
01:26:49,306 --> 01:26:52,969
Another 50000 will be spent
on prayers to purify this girl.

937
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,971
That makes it a lakh.

938
01:26:56,313 --> 01:26:59,111
No...l don't want the cash now.

939
01:26:59,316 --> 01:27:01,648
We're not stone hearted.
The marriage will be performed.

940
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:04,787
But after a couple of days...

941
01:27:04,988 --> 01:27:08,651
Send the girl to our house
along with Rs. 100000.

942
01:27:09,326 --> 01:27:11,157
Where will l get the money?

943
01:27:11,328 --> 01:27:12,818
''Agree to him, Papa.''

944
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:14,729
What?

945
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:16,159
Accept his demands.

946
01:27:16,733 --> 01:27:19,725
What is wrong with you?
Where will l get the money?

947
01:27:20,337 --> 01:27:21,827
Like Mr. Hazarilal said..

948
01:27:23,006 --> 01:27:24,667
A stranger sat in my room.

949
01:27:25,342 --> 01:27:26,934
He left behind 50000.

950
01:27:27,344 --> 01:27:30,336
Tomorrow l'll get 2.
We'll get a lakh.

951
01:27:31,014 --> 01:27:35,348
''Ask him if he wants more,
l'll take in 4 or 5 men.''

952
01:27:35,685 --> 01:27:37,812
''Good God!
- Shameless girl, what did you say?''

953
01:27:37,954 --> 01:27:39,353
Mind your tongue!

954
01:27:40,357 --> 01:27:43,155
Do you want this marriage
or should we get up?

955
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,691
Get up.

956
01:27:45,028 --> 01:27:47,292
What did you say?
- Get up!

957
01:27:48,298 --> 01:27:50,289
Get out this very moment! Now!

958
01:27:56,306 --> 01:27:58,035
''Be quiet, dear.''

959
01:27:58,308 --> 01:28:00,970
l won't be quiet!
This is the limit!

960
01:28:01,311 --> 01:28:04,303
My ears are hurting
hearing this man's threats!

961
01:28:04,647 --> 01:28:06,308
Shall we get up? Get up?

962
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:09,140
''Now when l told them to go, why
don't they leave? Why're they here?''

963
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:11,981
Why don't they leave?
- What is she saying?

964
01:28:13,323 --> 01:28:15,314
''You worm, crawling on
your Pop's directions!''

965
01:28:15,658 --> 01:28:17,990
Why are you sitting there? Get up!

966
01:28:18,061 --> 01:28:20,996
Talk to me with respect.
l'm going to be your husband!

967
01:28:21,164 --> 01:28:23,826
Mouse! l'd rather sit on the pyre!

968
01:28:26,002 --> 01:28:27,333
Get a move on!

969
01:28:28,338 --> 01:28:30,135
My marriage...!

970
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:33,070
''Don't worry, son.
l'll fix you 10 marriages!''

971
01:28:33,343 --> 01:28:35,140
And she'll remain a
spinster! l'll see...

972
01:28:35,345 --> 01:28:37,142
What will you see?

973
01:28:37,347 --> 01:28:39,338
Now the world will watch you!

974
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:43,177
''You, your wife, all your relatives..''

975
01:28:43,353 --> 01:28:45,344
''The servants, everyone
who came with you..''

976
01:28:45,855 --> 01:28:48,346
''The clothes, boots, turban...''

977
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:52,692
Even the vest and underwear
has been given by my Papa!

978
01:28:54,097 --> 01:28:57,362
lf you're here for another 2 seconds
l'll strip and send you home nude!

979
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,859
''Sister, we're completely disrobed.''

980
01:29:01,104 --> 01:29:03,038
Nothing remains.
Let's make a run for it.

981
01:29:03,373 --> 01:29:04,772
''Uncle, what are you murmuring?''

982
01:29:04,974 --> 01:29:06,373
Bacteria of rabies!

983
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:10,042
Sister...!
- God! She's gone mad!

984
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,177
You are mad. So is
your entire family!

985
01:29:12,382 --> 01:29:13,781
Greedy old hag!

986
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:15,381
You buffalo clad in a Kanjeevaram
sari of Kanjeevaram House!

987
01:29:15,785 --> 01:29:17,377
Be grateful l didn't become
your daughter-in-law!

988
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:21,053
Else you'd burn in the kitchen and
your photo would appear in the paper!

989
01:29:22,392 --> 01:29:23,882
Sister..

990
01:29:27,397 --> 01:29:29,388
My poor Papa...

991
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,063
He was begging each person
for forgiveness as if..

992
01:29:36,406 --> 01:29:39,398
He's committed a grave sin
by giving birth to a girl.

993
01:29:42,412 --> 01:29:43,743
l spit on all of you!

994
01:29:44,747 --> 01:29:46,078
Get out of here!

995
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:50,148
Out!
- l'll throw them out!

996
01:29:50,687 --> 01:29:53,019
With a kick on their backsides.

997
01:29:53,356 --> 01:29:55,347
''Aunt, help me.
- Show us, advance!''

998
01:30:01,364 --> 01:30:03,696
You think you bought us!

999
01:30:06,369 --> 01:30:08,030
''Okay, we are leaving.''

1000
01:30:09,372 --> 01:30:10,771
You son of your Daddy! Get out!

1001
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,371
My turban!

1002
01:30:18,214 --> 01:30:20,375
Where is Gulabchand?
- Why do you want him?

1003
01:30:20,717 --> 01:30:22,048
My bag is with him.

1004
01:30:24,387 --> 01:30:26,787
You were asked to leave.
Where are you taking the bag?

1005
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:28,389
lt was lying there.

1006
01:30:28,725 --> 01:30:31,057
One touch and you'll be lying here.

1007
01:30:31,394 --> 01:30:33,385
Get lost!
- l am leaving.

1008
01:30:34,397 --> 01:30:35,796
You thief!

1009
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,890
Where are you going?
Come to the police station.

1010
01:30:40,403 --> 01:30:43,395
Just a second. Let me return this.

1011
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:45,139
Please come here.

1012
01:30:45,408 --> 01:30:47,342
Give this bag to Nekchand.

1013
01:30:48,344 --> 01:30:49,743
With great difficulty
we finally nabbed you.

1014
01:30:50,346 --> 01:30:52,337
l'm not sorry to be caught.

1015
01:30:53,349 --> 01:30:54,839
But l'm glad that...

1016
01:30:55,351 --> 01:30:59,014
...has been released from the
rotting customs of our society.

1017
01:30:59,355 --> 01:31:02,347
To celebrate have...
- Bribing us!

1018
01:31:02,759 --> 01:31:04,693
lt's a biscuit.
- Give me one too.

1019
01:31:05,028 --> 01:31:06,359
Have one.

1020
01:31:06,763 --> 01:31:08,355
Quite tasty.
- Yes.

1021
01:31:14,037 --> 01:31:16,198
Hazarilal was running
away with your cash.

1022
01:31:16,372 --> 01:31:18,135
The thief saved it.

1023
01:31:18,374 --> 01:31:21,366
Nothing is saved. Nothing!

1024
01:31:22,378 --> 01:31:24,710
Everything is ruined. Spoilt.

1025
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:30,375
Now who will marry her?

1026
01:31:33,389 --> 01:31:34,879
lt's all my mistake.

1027
01:31:35,391 --> 01:31:37,723
l wish l had died before
giving Papa this sorrow!

1028
01:31:39,128 --> 01:31:40,390
l am to be blamed for it!

1029
01:31:41,397 --> 01:31:44,889
''No, dear. lt isn't your fault.''

1030
01:31:46,402 --> 01:31:47,994
lt's our fault.

1031
01:31:49,105 --> 01:31:51,835
What you said today..
what you did..

1032
01:31:52,075 --> 01:31:54,134
lf we'd said it in our times..

1033
01:31:54,344 --> 01:31:58,144
''lf we'd done this,
you wouldn't have to face it.''

1034
01:31:58,348 --> 01:32:01,340
You might have to face troubles.

1035
01:32:02,352 --> 01:32:04,343
But woman kind will find courage.

1036
01:32:05,355 --> 01:32:07,346
''A lot of courage.
Bravo, my dear.''

1037
01:32:31,381 --> 01:32:32,871
''Madam, here's your ticket.''

1038
01:32:33,383 --> 01:32:36,181
The train is an hour late.
Rest in the waiting room till then.

1039
01:32:47,330 --> 01:32:49,730
Good day lnspector.
Gopal the porter here.

1040
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:52,994
The woman you described is here.

1041
01:33:09,352 --> 01:33:11,343
Vaidehi shall we leave?

1042
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:31,204
''When you've found out all,
l want to be frank with you.''

1043
01:33:33,042 --> 01:33:34,839
For me you are only an incubator.

1044
01:33:35,378 --> 01:33:36,777
lt's a matter of a few months.

1045
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,211
The moment l get my child..

1046
01:33:39,716 --> 01:33:41,377
You are free..

1047
01:33:41,784 --> 01:33:43,217
The child is mine.

1048
01:33:44,387 --> 01:33:46,218
You can't take my child away from me!

1049
01:33:48,324 --> 01:33:50,053
Even the law is with the mother.

1050
01:33:50,326 --> 01:33:52,123
And if the mother is no more..

1051
01:33:55,331 --> 01:33:56,730
What if the mother is no more..

1052
01:33:59,335 --> 01:34:02,327
You and your law can't stop me.

1053
01:34:10,346 --> 01:34:11,836
Long live the Workers Union!

1054
01:34:22,024 --> 01:34:23,355
What is the trouble?

1055
01:34:31,033 --> 01:34:32,364
Teaching us the law!

1056
01:34:32,702 --> 01:34:34,033
We'll set you right!

1057
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:36,361
We'll see for how long
you can keep us locked!

1058
01:34:36,873 --> 01:34:39,967
You will have to meet our
demands! lt's no joke!

1059
01:34:40,376 --> 01:34:43,368
What is the meaning of this?
- We'll strike!

1060
01:34:55,324 --> 01:34:56,916
You love eating apples?

1061
01:34:57,326 --> 01:34:59,988
lt's required.
Keeps you healthy.

1062
01:35:00,329 --> 01:35:02,991
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

1063
01:35:03,332 --> 01:35:04,993
You must be throwing it
away after eating it.

1064
01:35:05,334 --> 01:35:07,131
''Yes indeed, if it's spoilt.''

1065
01:35:07,336 --> 01:35:09,327
Do you throw it anywhere
or mind where it falls?

1066
01:35:10,006 --> 01:35:12,338
How funny. Of course
l am careful of where l throw it.

1067
01:35:49,312 --> 01:35:52,975
''You are like the river''

1068
01:35:53,316 --> 01:35:56,080
''But there's no sea in sight''

1069
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:00,653
''There are many turns''

1070
01:36:01,657 --> 01:36:04,125
''But not your destination''

1071
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:09,324
''You are flowing like the river''

1072
01:36:09,999 --> 01:36:12,331
''But there's no sea in sight''

1073
01:36:13,803 --> 01:36:17,000
''There are many turns''

1074
01:36:18,341 --> 01:36:20,332
''But not your destination''

1075
01:36:22,345 --> 01:36:25,337
''Storm up ahead, dying desires..''

1076
01:36:28,351 --> 01:36:31,343
''Storm up ahead, dying desires..''

1077
01:36:32,355 --> 01:36:34,687
''Smoke filling the eyes''

1078
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:40,022
''What path, which city?''

1079
01:36:40,363 --> 01:36:43,025
''Where are you proceeding?''

1080
01:36:44,367 --> 01:36:47,803
''Tired eyes hunt for..''

1081
01:36:49,305 --> 01:36:51,136
''A home of your own''

1082
01:36:51,641 --> 01:36:53,632
How much further?
How far is Rang Mahal?

1083
01:36:53,809 --> 01:36:55,140
There it is.

1084
01:36:57,313 --> 01:37:00,646
''When there's no veil
from the Almighty..''

1085
01:37:02,318 --> 01:37:05,310
''When there's no veil
from the Almighty..''

1086
01:37:06,322 --> 01:37:08,313
''Why hide from humans?''

1087
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:11,316
''When in love, do not fear''

1088
01:37:12,328 --> 01:37:14,819
''When in love, do not fear''

1089
01:37:15,331 --> 01:37:18,323
''When in love, do not fear''

1090
01:37:19,335 --> 01:37:21,667
''l have fallen in love,
not committed a theft''

1091
01:37:22,338 --> 01:37:25,068
''Why must l hide my sighs?''

1092
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:28,071
''When in love, do not fear''

1093
01:37:33,349 --> 01:37:35,180
Your fearless love..

1094
01:37:36,352 --> 01:37:40,345
Your style and your
mischievous manner...

1095
01:37:41,023 --> 01:37:43,082
Surely it deserves my reward.

1096
01:37:44,026 --> 01:37:45,357
My good fortunes.

1097
01:37:46,362 --> 01:37:49,126
This is what the chattel
expected from the royal sire.

1098
01:37:52,301 --> 01:37:55,099
Guard of..
- Get some tea!

1099
01:37:55,304 --> 01:37:57,033
lt's too much.
- Janki..!

1100
01:37:58,307 --> 01:37:59,968
Lights off!

1101
01:38:00,309 --> 01:38:04,109
Tea!
- This is our final dress rehearsal.

1102
01:38:05,982 --> 01:38:07,313
She is here to see you.

1103
01:38:09,318 --> 01:38:10,979
Good day.

1104
01:38:12,321 --> 01:38:15,313
l am Mr. Purushottam.
Owner of Rang Mahal Drama Co.

1105
01:38:17,326 --> 01:38:18,759
l understand..

1106
01:38:19,328 --> 01:38:25,665
l act as well as teach acting.

1107
01:38:27,336 --> 01:38:29,167
Have you come to learn acting?

1108
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:32,830
Actually my name is Vaidehi.

1109
01:38:33,342 --> 01:38:35,833
l've come to meet Savitri.
- Savitri? - Yes.

1110
01:38:36,078 --> 01:38:37,943
She passed away 2 years ago.

1111
01:38:38,347 --> 01:38:40,008
What?
- Yes.

1112
01:38:42,351 --> 01:38:45,684
But her son sent a letter for her..

1113
01:38:46,022 --> 01:38:47,353
Who? Raju?

1114
01:38:48,357 --> 01:38:51,190
He himself cremated her.

1115
01:38:51,861 --> 01:38:53,351
How strange.
Show me the letter.

1116
01:39:04,373 --> 01:39:05,738
Dear Vaidehi..

1117
01:39:06,776 --> 01:39:08,368
This is addressed to you.

1118
01:39:10,379 --> 01:39:11,778
There's another one.

1119
01:39:13,049 --> 01:39:14,380
This one is for me.

1120
01:39:18,387 --> 01:39:19,979
The mental state you are in..

1121
01:39:20,389 --> 01:39:22,380
You need rest and security.

1122
01:39:23,392 --> 01:39:24,791
That is why l had to do this.

1123
01:39:26,128 --> 01:39:28,392
Else you wouldn't come
so far to my village.

1124
01:39:29,398 --> 01:39:31,798
You may stay in my house
for as long as you wish.

1125
01:39:32,401 --> 01:39:33,800
''Your friend, Raju.''

1126
01:39:34,136 --> 01:39:35,398
You will like the house.

1127
01:39:36,405 --> 01:39:37,895
Yes.
- Just a minute.

1128
01:39:38,407 --> 01:39:40,875
Praise be to the Holy Mother.

1129
01:39:43,412 --> 01:39:45,073
Praise be..

1130
01:39:47,349 --> 01:39:51,183
Here is Savitri's house.
Now your home.

1131
01:39:51,687 --> 01:39:54,679
Think of me if you need anything.

1132
01:39:55,024 --> 01:39:56,355
l live right here...

1133
01:40:03,032 --> 01:40:04,363
My wife Lata.

1134
01:40:05,034 --> 01:40:06,365
She knows nothing.

1135
01:40:06,769 --> 01:40:09,033
She's very shy. Good family.

1136
01:40:09,705 --> 01:40:11,036
l'll take leave. Good day.

1137
01:40:15,377 --> 01:40:16,867
You know nothing!

1138
01:40:18,047 --> 01:40:20,379
How often have l told you
not to stand at the window!

1
01:40:20,713 --> 01:40:22,908
Don't stand there!
But you never listen!

2
01:40:23,716 --> 01:40:26,082
lt doesn't behove women
of good families.

3
01:40:27,987 --> 01:40:29,318
Today you stand at the window.

4
01:40:30,322 --> 01:40:32,313
Tomorrow you'll meet
another man's eyes.

5
01:40:33,793 --> 01:40:36,091
The day after you'll bring
shame to yourself and elope.

6
01:40:36,996 --> 01:40:38,657
The day after that
people will spit on me!

7
01:40:38,831 --> 01:40:40,162
And the day after that..

8
01:40:40,599 --> 01:40:43,830
That is why l say
you know nothing at all.

9
01:40:44,336 --> 01:40:46,133
The world is full of bad men.

10
01:40:47,273 --> 01:40:51,073
Theirjob is to wile
innocent girls like you.

11
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:53,009
And ruin their lives!

12
01:40:54,013 --> 01:40:56,277
l want to protect you from these evils

13
01:40:57,283 --> 01:40:59,274
l want to make you an ideal wife.

14
01:40:59,785 --> 01:41:03,619
Who won't even look at
the face of a strange man.

15
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:07,020
Did Tiku come?

16
01:41:09,295 --> 01:41:11,889
l have to present it
at Mr. Agarwal's wedding.

17
01:41:12,298 --> 01:41:14,960
You don't worry.
l'll get one made for you too.

18
01:41:20,306 --> 01:41:23,298
Did you cover your face
when Tiku had come?

19
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:25,641
Bravo...

20
01:41:26,312 --> 01:41:27,802
ldeal wife.

21
01:41:30,316 --> 01:41:32,807
Good day.
- And that's Putanbaba.

22
01:41:32,985 --> 01:41:34,714
Good day.
- Slightly hard of hearing.

23
01:41:35,321 --> 01:41:38,119
''And that's the hero of
my drama, Manish. - Hello.''

24
01:41:38,758 --> 01:41:41,659
''And that's the heroine
of Rang Mahal, Janki.''

25
01:41:41,827 --> 01:41:43,317
Hello. - Hello.
- And this is Vaidehi.

26
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:45,820
Do people have such names today?

27
01:41:47,266 --> 01:41:49,257
Vaidehi not Kaikeyi!

28
01:41:52,271 --> 01:41:53,932
They are the same name.

29
01:41:54,273 --> 01:41:57,936
l saw your rehearsal.
l loved it. - Thank you.

30
01:41:59,278 --> 01:42:00,939
l trained Janki.

31
01:42:01,614 --> 01:42:03,275
l held her finger and taught her all.

32
01:42:04,283 --> 01:42:06,683
Eat some more..
- She obeyed me when she was little.

33
01:42:08,287 --> 01:42:11,723
''Since she attained
maturity, she obeys others.''

34
01:42:13,292 --> 01:42:14,953
Where are you going? Stay put.

35
01:42:15,294 --> 01:42:16,955
''Have one more morsel..
- No, l'm stuffed,''

36
01:42:18,297 --> 01:42:20,288
''Open your mouth.
- Yes, son. Eat it.''

37
01:42:23,702 --> 01:42:25,294
But this action will
bring you disgrace.

38
01:42:27,306 --> 01:42:28,967
''l want Vaidehi, at any cost!''

39
01:42:29,308 --> 01:42:30,798
All the newspapers in this area..

40
01:42:32,311 --> 01:42:35,303
Print this photo in all.
The informer gets 100000 reward.

41
01:42:37,316 --> 01:42:38,977
What month?

42
01:42:39,652 --> 01:42:41,984
Mr. Purushottam said you're pregnant.

43
01:42:42,721 --> 01:42:44,313
l'm in the second
month of my pregnancy.

44
01:42:46,325 --> 01:42:48,054
What are you looking for?
Symbols of marriage?

45
01:42:48,694 --> 01:42:50,093
l'm not yet married.

46
01:42:50,262 --> 01:42:51,593
But we'll be married next month.

47
01:42:52,765 --> 01:42:54,665
''Here, use this to wipe. Go on.''

48
01:42:57,269 --> 01:42:59,066
Hurry and get a packet of Panama.

49
01:42:59,271 --> 01:43:02,263
We've finished lunch.
Manish will want a smoke.

50
01:43:02,942 --> 01:43:04,273
Deliver my stuff home.

51
01:43:04,677 --> 01:43:05,336
l understand.
- Come...

52
01:43:06,278 --> 01:43:10,271
''You know Manish, the hero..
He's going to be my ...''

53
01:43:12,618 --> 01:43:14,017
Have you run away from home?

54
01:43:15,287 --> 01:43:17,118
Have you had a scrap with your man?

55
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:21,282
Tiku said you had no bags.

56
01:43:21,694 --> 01:43:24,686
l too wondered how you wore
the same clothes after a bath.

57
01:43:25,631 --> 01:43:27,064
But don't you worry.
l'll give you a sari.

58
01:43:27,299 --> 01:43:29,290
No..it's not really...
- l have plenty of clothes.

59
01:43:29,635 --> 01:43:30,966
''Come home with me.
- No, l don't need..''

60
01:43:32,304 --> 01:43:34,636
Coming...
You stay here. l'll be back.

61
01:43:36,308 --> 01:43:38,071
Yes?

62
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:39,800
Did you call me?
- Come in.

63
01:43:40,312 --> 01:43:41,745
l am already in.

64
01:43:43,315 --> 01:43:44,907
What do you think of this necklace?

65
01:43:45,317 --> 01:43:47,842
Exquisite. Beautiful.

66
01:43:48,254 --> 01:43:51,246
What a design!
Bought it for Lata?

67
01:43:52,925 --> 01:43:55,587
l often told you
don't address her thus.

68
01:43:55,928 --> 01:43:57,589
''What should l call her?
- Elder sister, silly girl.''

69
01:43:58,264 --> 01:44:01,756
Sister..?
- l got this made specially for you.

70
01:44:02,268 --> 01:44:07,262
Really? But l think there's
a lot of time for Rakhi!

71
01:44:08,941 --> 01:44:10,272
You play the fool all the time!

72
01:44:11,277 --> 01:44:13,268
''Mr. Purushottam, you fool around.''

73
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,271
l've often told you
l don't approve of this.

74
01:44:16,615 --> 01:44:18,276
But you don't seem to understand.

75
01:44:18,617 --> 01:44:21,609
l do. My mind has understood.

76
01:44:22,288 --> 01:44:25,746
But here..how do l
convince my heart?

77
01:44:26,292 --> 01:44:27,725
You are all it wants.

78
01:44:27,893 --> 01:44:31,294
How do l convince my heart
which only wants Manish?

79
01:44:31,463 --> 01:44:32,794
You are a fool!

80
01:44:33,799 --> 01:44:37,291
On one hand you have me who
wants to give you all l have.

81
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:39,301
And you reject me!

82
01:44:39,905 --> 01:44:42,897
And you side with him
who lives off you!

83
01:44:43,309 --> 01:44:44,799
The scavenging dog!
- That's enough.

84
01:44:45,044 --> 01:44:48,241
Stop it. l won't hear
a word against Manish.

85
01:44:48,747 --> 01:44:50,078
''However he is, he is mine.''

86
01:44:50,249 --> 01:44:51,580
He means everything to me.

87
01:44:51,984 --> 01:44:54,851
What a temper!
My employee growls at me!

88
01:44:55,254 --> 01:45:00,248
''Sweet pie, don't forget
you signed a contact with me.''

89
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,751
Now you will have
to dance to my tune.

90
01:45:06,265 --> 01:45:07,926
Just Purushottam?
No respect...?

91
01:45:08,267 --> 01:45:09,598
Cut away.

92
01:45:09,935 --> 01:45:13,598
You were never great. Talk too
much and you won't remain a man!

93
01:45:13,939 --> 01:45:16,271
l am lightning.
l don't dance at anyone's tune.

94
01:45:16,675 --> 01:45:19,269
''ln fact, when l strike
your tunes go out of tune.''

95
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:21,940
As for the contract...

96
01:45:22,281 --> 01:45:26,081
Someday l'll make a kite out of
it and fly it from your terrace.

97
01:45:26,285 --> 01:45:28,014
And you'll stand with the string.

98
01:45:33,559 --> 01:45:34,890
Come in..

99
01:45:39,031 --> 01:45:40,293
You have a nice home.

100
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,700
''Hardly a home, more like a room.''

101
01:45:43,969 --> 01:45:45,300
We have to set up our home.

102
01:45:45,704 --> 01:45:47,228
l'm getting ready for it.

103
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,901
l have so many saris.

104
01:45:53,912 --> 01:45:55,243
l have all of them.

105
01:45:55,581 --> 01:45:57,242
''Honest, l have every kind of sari.''

106
01:45:57,649 --> 01:45:59,913
''You have quite a collection.
- Sure, why not...''

107
01:46:00,252 --> 01:46:02,914
''Even if of the stage,
but l am a heroine.''

108
01:46:03,255 --> 01:46:04,586
l have to maintain.

109
01:46:05,591 --> 01:46:08,253
''By the way, if a couple of men
don't turn round to stare at me..''

110
01:46:08,761 --> 01:46:10,251
l can't sleep at night.

111
01:46:11,263 --> 01:46:12,662
Which sari...?

112
01:46:13,766 --> 01:46:15,097
Here...Wear this.

113
01:46:15,267 --> 01:46:17,929
''This!
- Yes, l bought it for Navratri.''

114
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:20,261
''lt will suit you.
Come on, wear it.''

115
01:46:20,606 --> 01:46:21,937
You'll look like Karishma.

116
01:46:22,274 --> 01:46:24,606
That is nice but..
- What?

117
01:46:24,777 --> 01:46:28,110
You won't be sullied by
wearing my sari. Take this off.

118
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:31,943
l'll wear it but you go there.

119
01:46:33,619 --> 01:46:35,052
You are so shy..?

120
01:46:36,288 --> 01:46:38,279
You want me to wear this?
Then please go.

121
01:46:40,292 --> 01:46:42,624
What...? What are you doing?

122
01:46:46,098 --> 01:46:47,224
l think the guy is sleeping.

123
01:46:48,233 --> 01:46:50,224
You can't make out
anything in 2 months.

124
01:46:50,969 --> 01:46:52,231
ls it your second month?

125
01:46:53,238 --> 01:46:55,229
Wow! Same name and same time!

126
01:46:55,574 --> 01:46:56,905
Give me five.

127
01:46:57,576 --> 01:47:00,238
''No way, Mr. Purushottam.
Janki and l'd already told you..''

128
01:47:00,746 --> 01:47:03,237
This would be our last
play for your company.

129
01:47:03,982 --> 01:47:06,041
Now you want us to
enact Valmiki's Ramayana!

130
01:47:07,986 --> 01:47:10,580
What can we do if you've signed
the contract and taken the money!

131
01:47:12,257 --> 01:47:14,054
''No, sir. We are going to Delhi.''

132
01:47:14,259 --> 01:47:16,591
''Sure, my son. Go with pleasure.''

133
01:47:17,262 --> 01:47:20,254
''Go to Delhi, Bombay.
ln fact go to Hollywood!''

134
01:47:21,266 --> 01:47:23,257
l want you to rise very high.

135
01:47:24,269 --> 01:47:28,262
And one day l will rest only
after you've gone right up.

136
01:47:29,942 --> 01:47:33,275
''But before you leave,
forget about me...''

137
01:47:34,279 --> 01:47:36,770
Take the blessings of the
Ultimate Male God Rama.

138
01:47:37,616 --> 01:47:40,779
Dumping the Ramayana
is the worst thing to do.

139
01:47:41,286 --> 01:47:42,947
Yes!
- Sir...

140
01:47:43,288 --> 01:47:46,018
You got this precious necklace
made for Janki with such love...

141
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:47,553
Why did you return it?

142
01:47:48,227 --> 01:47:50,218
l returned it because...

143
01:47:50,562 --> 01:47:52,621
The heart you made in the necklace...

144
01:47:53,232 --> 01:47:56,565
''Like your brain, you left it empty.''

145
01:47:57,903 --> 01:48:02,237
Janki wants P & J carved in it.

146
01:48:03,242 --> 01:48:05,005
l'll carve it in red.

147
01:48:05,244 --> 01:48:06,734
That's great.

148
01:48:08,247 --> 01:48:09,737
P & J.

149
01:48:09,982 --> 01:48:11,244
l got that.

150
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:13,050
You were saying...

151
01:48:14,253 --> 01:48:16,244
ls there...something
between you and Janki?

152
01:48:17,256 --> 01:48:18,985
My dear son...

153
01:48:19,925 --> 01:48:25,261
Some questions give peace
of mind when left unanswered.

154
01:48:26,265 --> 01:48:28,256
lf you want me to act in your play..

155
01:48:29,601 --> 01:48:31,262
Tell me the truth.

156
01:48:32,271 --> 01:48:34,262
What is the relation
between you and Janki?

157
01:48:35,274 --> 01:48:37,265
Son...my son..

158
01:48:47,953 --> 01:48:49,284
Does Manish love you?

159
01:48:51,290 --> 01:48:52,780
What's this if not love?

160
01:48:53,292 --> 01:48:54,953
He loves me a lot.

161
01:48:55,294 --> 01:48:56,955
We're getting married next month.

162
01:48:57,296 --> 01:48:58,786
Then we're going to Delhi.

163
01:48:59,298 --> 01:49:01,289
My hero has got a role in a serial.

164
01:49:03,302 --> 01:49:05,293
Then he will earn and l'll blow it.

165
01:49:06,305 --> 01:49:07,897
l mean l'll run the house.

166
01:49:12,978 --> 01:49:15,310
''Must be Tiku.
Come in, the door is open.''

167
01:49:16,315 --> 01:49:18,306
Tiku used to be a barber
now he's an actor.

168
01:49:18,650 --> 01:49:20,982
Matter of time.
- Sister...here's your stuff.

169
01:49:21,987 --> 01:49:23,818
And your change.
- Keep it.

170
01:49:24,656 --> 01:49:26,988
Aren't you going to
watch a film today?

171
01:49:27,326 --> 01:49:29,317
The film has changed.
- Which one is playing?

172
01:49:33,332 --> 01:49:35,323
''l am full of life.
Control your senses''

173
01:49:36,335 --> 01:49:38,326
''Don't glare at me!''

174
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:41,332
What man? Get 3 tickets
Use my name. - Okay.

175
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:43,731
''We'll all go. You, me
and Manish. What fun!''

176
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:49,611
Do you drink?
- Yes.

177
01:49:51,283 --> 01:49:53,615
l try to give it up but can't.

178
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:56,281
But this is harmful to the baby.

179
01:49:56,788 --> 01:49:59,086
l know that is why l've reduced
from half to a quarter bottle.

180
01:50:00,692 --> 01:50:03,286
The problem is..
l can't sleep at night.

181
01:50:04,296 --> 01:50:05,786
All kinds of worries badger me.

182
01:50:07,299 --> 01:50:08,766
How did you fall in this vice?

183
01:50:09,301 --> 01:50:10,734
Thanks to Purushottam.

184
01:50:11,303 --> 01:50:12,793
He wanted to make me a heroine.

185
01:50:13,305 --> 01:50:15,296
But the stage scared me.

186
01:50:16,308 --> 01:50:18,833
One day he tricked me into
drinking and pushed me on stage.

187
01:50:20,312 --> 01:50:22,712
l got over the fear of stage
but got hooked to this.

188
01:50:23,315 --> 01:50:24,907
Didn't your parents prohibit you?

189
01:50:25,317 --> 01:50:26,841
They passed away when l was little.

190
01:50:27,319 --> 01:50:28,877
l'm working here since l was a kid.

191
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:31,983
Do you know all of us
artists live in this house.

192
01:50:32,324 --> 01:50:33,723
Even Manish?

193
01:50:33,992 --> 01:50:35,323
Downstairs.

194
01:50:36,328 --> 01:50:39,764
''That is why, sweet..
That is why l said..''

195
01:50:40,332 --> 01:50:44,132
lt's best not to know
the answers to some questions.

196
01:50:44,336 --> 01:50:47,271
You are lying!
- l'm lying?

197
01:50:47,939 --> 01:50:49,270
But the holy books don't lie.

198
01:50:50,609 --> 01:50:53,100
And the holy book
says in huge letters..

199
01:50:53,545 --> 01:50:56,070
The woman who crosses
the threshold of her home..

200
01:50:56,682 --> 01:50:59,276
The character of that
woman can't be trusted.

201
01:50:59,951 --> 01:51:01,282
''To top it, an artist.''

202
01:51:02,287 --> 01:51:07,281
The face that is caked in
make-up can never be loyal.

203
01:51:09,961 --> 01:51:11,292
What do you mean to imply?

204
01:51:12,297 --> 01:51:16,290
You are a good human being
and an even better artist.

205
01:51:16,768 --> 01:51:19,293
On going to Delhi will
you look after your career?

206
01:51:20,305 --> 01:51:21,636
Or look after the baby?

207
01:51:22,307 --> 01:51:24,969
And God knows whose child it is.

208
01:51:31,316 --> 01:51:32,977
No!!!

209
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:36,719
''Darling, what an entry!''

210
01:51:39,324 --> 01:51:40,916
Thrash them! Beat them all up!

211
01:51:41,326 --> 01:51:43,317
Beat them so much that they
rip the screen and fall here!

212
01:51:48,667 --> 01:51:49,998
You too must whistle.

213
01:51:51,269 --> 01:51:52,702
l can't.

214
01:51:53,271 --> 01:51:54,761
''Look, it's so easy.''

215
01:51:55,273 --> 01:51:56,672
Purse your lips together in style.

216
01:51:58,710 --> 01:52:00,268
And gently blow out.

217
01:52:02,013 --> 01:52:03,275
lsn't it simple?

218
01:52:08,286 --> 01:52:10,277
Can only guys whistle?
Can't girls do the same?

219
01:52:11,289 --> 01:52:13,018
l did it!
- You did???

220
01:52:13,291 --> 01:52:14,781
l whistled!
- Whistle some more!

221
01:52:31,309 --> 01:52:33,300
This is such a serene
and tranquil place.

222
01:52:34,312 --> 01:52:36,041
l like this place
the best in this town.

223
01:52:37,315 --> 01:52:38,805
''Come, let's sit here.''

224
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:41,041
''Right here.
- No, let's go home.''

225
01:52:41,319 --> 01:52:43,810
There's such a pleasant breeze
blowing. Let's enjoy it.

226
01:52:44,322 --> 01:52:45,812
''No, let's go home.''

227
01:52:46,324 --> 01:52:48,849
We'll sit at home too.
Might as well sit here.

228
01:52:49,928 --> 01:52:51,259
ls there a problem?

229
01:52:52,264 --> 01:52:53,663
What?

230
01:52:54,266 --> 01:52:56,257
That's no problem.

231
01:52:56,601 --> 01:52:58,091
lt's a clear road.
Sit down anywhere.

232
01:52:58,437 --> 01:52:59,995
Behind the boulder or bush..

233
01:53:00,272 --> 01:53:02,263
Are you mad?
- l do it.

234
01:53:02,541 --> 01:53:03,872
You too can do it.
- You are shameless!

235
01:53:04,276 --> 01:53:06,744
You're a scream. l made
you whistle in the theater.

236
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:08,712
Now you're acting all coy.

237
01:53:09,281 --> 01:53:11,112
''ln such matters,
it's best to be shameless.''

238
01:53:11,283 --> 01:53:13,877
Look at the men.
They piddle anywhere.

239
01:53:14,286 --> 01:53:16,777
They are not worried
about who is walking past.

240
01:53:17,289 --> 01:53:20,281
And there's nobody here
A long solitary road.

241
01:53:20,625 --> 01:53:22,616
Go and squat. l'll stand guard.

242
01:53:23,295 --> 01:53:27,629
Let's please go home.
- Do it or go home alone.

243
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,291
You'll never advance in life.

244
01:53:30,702 --> 01:53:33,296
lf peeing on the road
helps one progress...

245
01:53:33,805 --> 01:53:35,295
l wonder where lndia
would have gone!

246
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:36,971
And where are you!

247
01:53:37,309 --> 01:53:40,142
l'm at the stage where
l take my own decisions.

248
01:53:40,312 --> 01:53:41,711
lsn't that achievement enough?

249
01:53:42,314 --> 01:53:44,305
Now you decide.
Doing it or leaving?

250
01:53:44,716 --> 01:53:48,243
l'm going! l'll show you!
Now stand guard!

251
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:51,245
Bravo! Spoken like a man!

252
01:53:58,263 --> 01:53:59,992
Doesn't the moon look lovely?

253
01:54:01,266 --> 01:54:03,029
lt relieves the eyes.

254
01:54:05,003 --> 01:54:06,595
lt grows by the day.

255
01:54:07,606 --> 01:54:09,267
And is complete one day.

256
01:54:10,275 --> 01:54:12,266
Our children too must be
growing up like this.

257
01:54:14,012 --> 01:54:15,274
One day they will take birth.

258
01:54:17,282 --> 01:54:18,749
l wonder where you will be.

259
01:54:19,618 --> 01:54:20,949
And where l will be.

260
01:54:22,954 --> 01:54:24,285
Will you think of me?

261
01:54:26,291 --> 01:54:27,952
l'll never forget you.

262
01:54:32,697 --> 01:54:36,292
''Like we have similar names,
let's give some name to our kids.''

263
01:54:36,368 --> 01:54:37,699
What do you say?

264
01:54:38,303 --> 01:54:39,770
''What do you want,
a son or a daughter?''

265
01:54:41,306 --> 01:54:43,774
''Considering my state,
l think it will be a boy.''

266
01:54:44,309 --> 01:54:45,776
The poor girl...

267
01:54:47,245 --> 01:54:48,906
Don't pity the girl.

268
01:54:50,248 --> 01:54:53,581
God filled girls with everything
in this universe that is good.

269
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:58,583
''lf she wishes, she'll give
everyone a run for their money.''

270
01:54:59,257 --> 01:55:02,249
Whether it be God lndra
or the saint Vishwamitra.

271
01:55:02,761 --> 01:55:06,253
''Rambha, Urvashi and Menaka,
stop your stage acting.''

272
01:55:07,265 --> 01:55:08,926
Today l'll make you also dance.

273
01:55:09,267 --> 01:55:12,259
Come along. - Where?
- l have enough admirers.

274
01:55:54,245 --> 01:55:56,236
''Bangles, bangles..''

275
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:01,241
''Ear rings, ear rings..''

276
01:56:05,256 --> 01:56:07,247

lsn't this Vaidehi's picture?

323
02:00:19,043 --> 02:00:23,537
''Silly oaf, this isn't a picture
of Vaidehi. lt's a bearer cheque.''

324
02:00:25,116 --> 02:00:28,313
Her husband says whosoever
gives information about her...

325
02:00:28,486 --> 02:00:31,455
he will get a cash
reward of Rs. 100000.

326
02:00:32,056 --> 02:00:34,718
So what do you think?
- l am thinking...

327
02:00:36,327 --> 02:00:38,318
Should l encash it or have some fun?

328
02:00:38,997 --> 02:00:41,522
Better still to have fun
and then cash it in.

329
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:46,668
What was he saying?
- He said Vaidehi is a bearer cheque.

330
02:00:47,005 --> 02:00:49,838
First he will have some fun
then he will cash her in.

331
02:00:50,174 --> 02:00:51,436
Small change!!

332
02:00:52,010 --> 02:00:56,674
Book another ticket to Delhi. Vaidehi
will accompany Manish and myself.

333
02:00:57,982 --> 02:00:59,745
Let that chap come!

334
02:01:00,184 --> 02:01:03,950
Here he comes.
- Janki? You are home?

335
02:01:04,289 --> 02:01:08,453
Who else would be in my house?
- Vaidehi. You've kept her...

336
02:01:09,894 --> 02:01:13,295
You've kept her with yourself.
- Yes. So...?

337
02:01:13,498 --> 02:01:17,093
l'd gone to the market.
To buy some saris for Lata.

338
02:01:17,435 --> 02:01:20,302
l thought l'd get a
couple for Vaidehi too.

339
02:01:20,438 --> 02:01:23,430
The poor thing is all alone..
- She's neither alone nor helpless.

340
02:01:24,442 --> 02:01:27,707
Her sister is with her.
Take your saris and get lost!

341
02:01:28,046 --> 02:01:32,710
Have you forgotten to be polite?
- l remember everything.

342
02:01:33,384 --> 02:01:36,012
You couldn't have me so
you're trying to ensnare her!

343
02:01:36,321 --> 02:01:39,484
l'm trying to settle not ensnare her.

344
02:01:40,325 --> 02:01:42,316
Be like Gandhi and
give me the other cheek.

345
02:01:44,929 --> 02:01:47,056
The first one because
you abused my sister.

346
02:01:47,265 --> 02:01:50,598
And the second...?
- For wearing dark glasses at night.

347
02:01:52,003 --> 02:01:53,994
Lord Rama be praised!

348
02:01:54,339 --> 02:01:56,933
Laxman be praised!

349
02:01:57,875 --> 02:02:01,276
Valiantly Laxman killed lndrajit.

350
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:03,269
Brother!

351
02:02:04,015 --> 02:02:06,074
''Bravo, Laxman!''

352
02:02:07,085 --> 02:02:11,545
''After the death of Ravana's son
lndrajit, it is now certain that...''

353
02:02:11,956 --> 02:02:14,447
victory will be ours.

354
02:02:15,293 --> 02:02:17,625
Hail Lord Ramchandra!

355
02:02:23,868 --> 02:02:24,892
Yes?

356
02:02:25,303 --> 02:02:28,864
''We have got 3 tickets to Delhi for
tomorrow evening, with berths.''

357
02:02:29,207 --> 02:02:30,299
3 tickets?
- Yes.

358
02:02:30,475 --> 02:02:33,569
Didn't l say Vaidehi too
would come with us?

359
02:02:35,113 --> 02:02:38,048
l was thinking of
going alone to Delhi.

360
02:02:38,449 --> 02:02:41,577
Alone?
- Yes. Uncle said...

361
02:02:41,919 --> 02:02:45,320
until the serial starts it would be
better for me to live alone.

362
02:02:45,456 --> 02:02:47,583
What will l do here by myself?

363
02:02:49,394 --> 02:02:53,262
You have Mr. Purushottam.
He'll take good care of you.

364
02:02:54,265 --> 02:02:55,994
Take a look at my wig!

365
02:03:06,010 --> 02:03:08,376
''Janki, it's your entry. Hurry up.''

366
02:03:14,285 --> 02:03:15,445
Hurry up.

367
02:03:28,699 --> 02:03:29,757
Stop it.

368
02:03:30,501 --> 02:03:32,696
''Stop shrieking, evil Ravana!''

369
02:03:34,005 --> 02:03:37,304
ln your anger l clearly
see your annihilation.

370
02:03:37,575 --> 02:03:40,305
Rama is the one who
will be annihilated!

371
02:03:40,445 --> 02:03:44,313
Then there will be nobody to save
you from the clutches of Ravana!

372
02:03:44,515 --> 02:03:46,449
''Shut up you diabolic, fiendish demon!''

373
02:03:48,386 --> 02:03:52,049
Just as you can't separate
the sun from its' rays..

374
02:03:52,256 --> 02:03:56,249
Similarly l can't be
separated from Shri Rama!

375
02:04:04,268 --> 02:04:07,567
Think about this.
lt's now 2 months.

376
02:04:08,272 --> 02:04:11,901
Another month and
my stomach will show.

377
02:04:12,276 --> 02:04:16,804
How...what..?
- That's just what l was thinking.

378
02:04:18,015 --> 02:04:21,280
What's the hurry for the child?

379
02:04:22,286 --> 02:04:23,275
What...?

380
02:04:24,288 --> 02:04:28,622
''l thought once the house is
settled, the kids will happen.''

381
02:04:29,093 --> 02:04:31,823
Kids are appreciated better then.

382
02:04:33,097 --> 02:04:35,622
That is why...
- That is why...

383
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:38,291
l must abort the baby?

384
02:04:57,155 --> 02:04:59,055
The baby is our love child.

385
02:05:00,057 --> 02:05:03,993
We dreamed of it together.
We had decided that..

386
02:05:04,262 --> 02:05:06,992
''Look, l'm not sure of what
my family will think.''

387
02:05:07,999 --> 02:05:13,266
And what people will say.
- Family...people...?

388
02:05:14,272 --> 02:05:15,933
From where have they come?

389
02:05:16,274 --> 02:05:18,469
Did you fall in love
with me after asking them?

390
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:21,274
Did you take their permission
before taking me to bed?

391
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:24,771
Tell me..
Give me an answer!

392
02:05:27,285 --> 02:05:28,946
You have the answer.

393
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:32,287
Do you know what everyone
says about you and Purushottam?

394
02:05:33,157 --> 02:05:35,284
They go so far as to
saying..the child is...

395
02:05:36,294 --> 02:05:39,593
Why did you stop?
Complete what you're saying.

396
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:45,294
We will get married.
But without the child.

397
02:06:01,252 --> 02:06:04,244
Foolish demon!
Blinded by arrogance...

398
02:06:04,822 --> 02:06:07,256
You have brought your death
in the form of Vaidehi's beauty!

399
02:06:07,558 --> 02:06:12,325
''Banished Ram, this trident is as
powerful as the Vajra!''

400
02:06:12,997 --> 02:06:15,989
l will pulverize both
brothers with its' aid!

401
02:06:16,267 --> 02:06:18,064
Face my arrow given by Brahma!

402
02:06:27,878 --> 02:06:31,746
What are you doing? The play is
going on. You have to go on stage.

403
02:06:33,284 --> 02:06:34,683
l am very upset.

404
02:06:36,053 --> 02:06:38,544
''What is wrong?
- You know, Manish...''

405
02:06:40,024 --> 02:06:43,289
He says... he doesn't want
this child now.

406
02:06:44,295 --> 02:06:46,525
He wants me to abort it.

407
02:06:48,966 --> 02:06:51,298
See..even you are upset.

408
02:06:52,803 --> 02:06:57,240
These men say anything.
They don't even spare a thought.

409
02:07:03,014 --> 02:07:07,417
Manish is possibly planning something.
For the future with you.

410
02:07:07,985 --> 02:07:10,579
He must be wanting to
first stand on his feet.

411
02:07:10,988 --> 02:07:12,649
That's not the truth.

412
02:07:14,258 --> 02:07:15,657
He suspects...

413
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:18,519
that this child isn't his.

414
02:07:21,265 --> 02:07:24,462
l'd agree if it were a matter
ofjust terminating the pregnancy.

415
02:07:26,270 --> 02:07:29,364
But... this is about my character.

416
02:07:30,941 --> 02:07:32,602
My self-esteem.

417
02:07:34,278 --> 02:07:38,476
''He wants evidence...
of my loyalty, of my love.''

418
02:07:40,484 --> 02:07:42,281
He wants to put me to test.

419
02:07:45,289 --> 02:07:49,623
But today he will have to give
the test of how much he loves me.

420
02:07:51,962 --> 02:07:56,626
''lf l am chaste, then l'm chaste
with this child. Not otherwise.''

421
02:07:58,035 --> 02:08:02,028
''lf he accepts me, it has to be
with the baby. Or not at all.''

422
02:08:02,473 --> 02:08:04,236
Get ready for the ordeal through fire.

423
02:08:04,375 --> 02:08:06,366
Long live Lord Ramchandra!

424
02:08:06,644 --> 02:08:08,236
Long live Mother Sita!

425
02:08:26,063 --> 02:08:30,659
''Sita, l rescued you by
waging a war with the enemy.''

426
02:08:31,068 --> 02:08:34,435
l did not wage war to acquire you.

427
02:08:35,373 --> 02:08:39,935
ln fact to prove my gallantry...
protect goodness..

428
02:08:40,411 --> 02:08:43,278
And to eliminate the stigma
on my illustrious family!

429
02:08:44,281 --> 02:08:48,081
You lived with a stranger in Lanka.

430
02:08:49,286 --> 02:08:52,346
Hence there is a doubt
on your integrity.

431
02:08:53,190 --> 02:08:55,818
Hence l cannot accept you.

432
02:08:57,061 --> 02:09:01,293
''Wherever you wish to go,
with whomsoever you wish to go..''

433
02:09:01,565 --> 02:09:03,362
you may go.
- Enough.

434
02:09:04,368 --> 02:09:07,565
''Oh valiant one, why do you
utter such bitter words?''

435
02:09:08,706 --> 02:09:11,300
lt's not my fault that
Ravana kidnapped me.

436
02:09:12,410 --> 02:09:16,540
l did not let him touch my
physical or mental self.

437
02:09:17,448 --> 02:09:20,417
And you suspect me?
- l can't help it.

438
02:09:21,318 --> 02:09:24,116
Having a divine woman like
yourself in his palace...

439
02:09:24,321 --> 02:09:27,813
The evil Ravana must not have
been able to keep his hands off you.

440
02:09:28,325 --> 02:09:31,317
Hence l forsake you.

441
02:09:32,329 --> 02:09:34,126
Oh pride of the Raghu lineage...

442
02:09:34,398 --> 02:09:37,128
Every moment l spent in Lanka
felt like eternity

443
02:09:37,334 --> 02:09:39,894
But l took your name and survived.

444
02:09:41,038 --> 02:09:45,475
And the outcome is that...
you question my chastity.

445
02:09:47,278 --> 02:09:51,374
''You worry about your family,
goodness and gallantry..''

446
02:09:52,283 --> 02:09:54,444
But nary a thought about
your life partner.

447
02:09:56,086 --> 02:09:58,281
You were sent to exile not me.

448
02:09:59,089 --> 02:10:02,752
l too could have stayed in
the royal palace like Urmila.

449
02:10:03,761 --> 02:10:07,788
But l considered you God.
And came to the forest with you.

450
02:10:08,432 --> 02:10:12,425
l did my duty as a wife.
And you are punishing me!

451
02:10:14,104 --> 02:10:18,302
Tell me one thing..
do you love me or not?

452
02:10:18,909 --> 02:10:20,968
lf you love me then
why don't you trust me?

453
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:25,806
''Princess of Mithilesh, the society...
- l married you not society.''

454
02:10:27,318 --> 02:10:30,310
''You tell me, are you with me or not?''

455
02:10:31,889 --> 02:10:33,117
What is she saying?

456
02:10:33,324 --> 02:10:34,313
Tell me...

457
02:10:35,326 --> 02:10:37,123
Are you with me or not?

458
02:10:38,696 --> 02:10:41,392
Answer me. Go on...

459
02:10:41,732 --> 02:10:44,326
Prompt her fast. She's
saying the wrong dialogues.

460
02:10:46,403 --> 02:10:47,768
She's right.

461
02:10:48,272 --> 02:10:52,606
''Princess of Mithilesh,
calm down, dear one of Janak...''

462
02:10:53,444 --> 02:10:56,379
Brother is angry with you.
- What for?

463
02:10:57,214 --> 02:11:01,617
l should be angry. Because the
question is about my integrity.

464
02:11:02,386 --> 02:11:04,547
lt's a matter of my self-esteem.

465
02:11:05,089 --> 02:11:09,082
And the truth is you are the
root cause of all my problems!

466
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:12,090
l...?
- You chopped Suprankha's nose.

467
02:11:12,429 --> 02:11:15,455
And Ravana kidnapped me!
He should have kidnapped you!

468
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:19,100
He demonstrated his manly
prowess only on a woman.

469
02:11:24,975 --> 02:11:25,805
Stop muttering.

470
02:11:26,010 --> 02:11:27,102
What crap!
- Nonsense!

471
02:11:27,311 --> 02:11:30,303
You brothers fought Ravan
with an army of monkeys.

472
02:11:31,315 --> 02:11:35,479
l battled him alone in Ashok Vatika.
l had broken his spirit!

473
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:40,313
l shattered his self-confidence!
l had defeated him right there.

474
02:11:41,525 --> 02:11:46,462
Your valiant brother knocked down
a dead man in the battlefield!

475
02:11:48,265 --> 02:11:50,392
lf l'd given in to Ravana's wish..

476
02:11:51,368 --> 02:11:54,064
Both of you would lose
the war without fighting. Then...

477
02:11:54,271 --> 02:11:57,570
''what would happen to your gallantry,
your lineage, righteousness?''

478
02:11:59,310 --> 02:12:04,077
''This is the payment l get for my love.
My bravado, my patience, my trust.''

479
02:12:06,283 --> 02:12:11,346
That in public l'm being humiliated...
forsaked.

480
02:12:14,792 --> 02:12:18,284
''Princess of Mithilesh,
daughter of Janak...''

481
02:12:18,562 --> 02:12:21,793
''My mother, Janki you
digress from the issue.''

482
02:12:22,299 --> 02:12:24,290
Light the fire.

483
02:12:28,105 --> 02:12:31,302
There! The fire is lit!
Enter.

484
02:12:32,309 --> 02:12:35,005
There is no doubt that you are chaste.

485
02:12:35,379 --> 02:12:38,473
You just have to step
in the fire and get off.

486
02:12:38,782 --> 02:12:42,047
''That will make brother happy,
you and we too will be happy.''

487
02:12:42,319 --> 02:12:45,015
Sing praise of...
- Sita's groom Ramchandra!

488
02:12:45,322 --> 02:12:46,789
Praise be to...
- Mother Sita!

489
02:12:46,991 --> 02:12:49,050
''Enter the fire, and prove..''

490
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:51,351
l don't want to prove a thing!

491
02:12:52,262 --> 02:12:57,325
Not to a man who doesn't trust me
or my words.

492
02:12:57,668 --> 02:12:58,930
What nonsense!

493
02:12:59,269 --> 02:13:03,262
''As for the test, both of us
have stayed away from each other.''

494
02:13:03,974 --> 02:13:06,272
Both of us should undergo
the ordeal by fire.

495
02:13:07,011 --> 02:13:08,603
Squat in the fire.

496
02:13:10,014 --> 02:13:12,949
This is an insult to religion!
- Stop this show!

497
02:13:14,284 --> 02:13:16,275
Please calm down.

498
02:13:17,955 --> 02:13:20,287
Drop the curtain!

499
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:32,495
Mr. Purushottam! Terrible news!

500
02:13:33,303 --> 02:13:35,294
Janki refused to go
through the ordeal of fire.

501
02:13:43,881 --> 02:13:45,974
There goes Delhi!
To hell with the wedding!

502
02:13:47,251 --> 02:13:48,878
All men are alike!

503
02:13:49,453 --> 02:13:52,911
''The words that soothe their ears,
pleases their hearts..''

504
02:13:53,057 --> 02:13:56,925
utter them and they will pamper you.
They'll call you a goddess!

505
02:13:57,695 --> 02:14:01,756
''The day you speak your heart, they'll
brand you a whore. Has no character!''

506
02:14:02,266 --> 02:14:05,929
''The caretakers or society
are screaming! Ask them! Go on, ask!''

507
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:08,861
For centuries woman
gave her life for man.

508
02:14:09,006 --> 02:14:12,407
Has any man ever died
for his woman on the pyre? Ask them!

509
02:14:13,077 --> 02:14:14,942
ls there any fast for them?

510
02:14:15,946 --> 02:14:17,277
Double-faced!

511
02:14:18,916 --> 02:14:23,444
l'm glad l got rid of the rancour
in my heart. l forgot l was on stage.

512
02:14:25,089 --> 02:14:27,455
l thought it was Manish before me.
- You made a big mistake...

513
02:14:27,624 --> 02:14:30,422
by trusting Manish.
- What mistake had you committed?

514
02:14:30,894 --> 02:14:34,557
You married in the eyes of the world.
As per tradition and customs.

515
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:38,564
But today you too stand there
where l am.

516
02:14:40,070 --> 02:14:42,095
Exiled with child in womb.

517
02:14:43,073 --> 02:14:46,099
And poor Mother Sita... even after
the ordeal through fire..

518
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:48,244
what did she get? Banishment?

519
02:14:48,645 --> 02:14:51,239
She wandered in the forest
with Luv and Kush in he womb!

520
02:14:52,449 --> 02:14:57,580
Alas! Had Sita done what you did...

521
02:14:58,255 --> 02:15:01,588
no man today would dare
ask woman to prove herself.

522
02:15:01,925 --> 02:15:04,553
Forget it.
Let all men go to Hell!

523
02:15:06,130 --> 02:15:09,588
We give them the status of a father.
And they clamber on our heads!

524
02:15:11,668 --> 02:15:13,260
We'll see what happens.

525
02:15:14,404 --> 02:15:17,271
Down with Janki!
- Fie on Janki!

526
02:15:17,574 --> 02:15:19,542
Shame on Purushottam!!

527
02:15:21,278 --> 02:15:24,076
Down with Janki! Shame!

528
02:15:24,481 --> 02:15:27,279
Shame on Purushottam!!

529
02:15:33,056 --> 02:15:37,390
Manish escaped overnight.
He has left you alone here.

530
02:15:38,428 --> 02:15:41,295
Now there are only two options
for you.

531
02:15:42,299 --> 02:15:45,427
Do you hear?
Only one place for Janki.

532
02:15:46,303 --> 02:15:48,464
Prison or mental asylum.

533
02:15:49,406 --> 02:15:54,400
''Yes, there can be another option.
lf you agree to me.''

534
02:15:55,479 --> 02:15:57,242
Become your mistress?

535
02:16:00,250 --> 02:16:03,242
Other than your wife does
every woman look like a whore?

536
02:16:04,254 --> 02:16:07,815
Pay someone and have her.
Take advantage of another get laid.

537
02:16:09,259 --> 02:16:12,251
What? Woman leaves home to earn
a livelihood.

538
02:16:12,563 --> 02:16:15,964
And every man assumes
she's his property! Why?

539
02:16:16,266 --> 02:16:20,566
Understand the gravity of
the situation. They want you dead!

540
02:16:21,271 --> 02:16:24,263
You have slighted religion!
- l haven't slighted religion.

541
02:16:25,008 --> 02:16:26,532
l just raised a question.

542
02:16:26,677 --> 02:16:28,941
Which has been rising
in woman's mind for centuries.

543
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:33,006
They want me dead because
they have no answer!

544
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:39,950
l'd prefer the madhouse to
living with such illiterate heretics!

545
02:16:42,192 --> 02:16:44,285
Janki is a witch!

546
02:16:44,995 --> 02:16:48,226
Here comes the blatant!
- She has slandered the Ramayana!

547
02:16:48,565 --> 02:16:51,557
She is a prostitute!
- Janki is a slut!

548
02:16:53,503 --> 02:16:56,233
The only place for Janki..
- Prison or madhouse!

549
02:16:56,473 --> 02:16:57,565
Calm down...

550
02:17:00,244 --> 02:17:01,905
''Excuse me, calm down.''

551
02:17:02,646 --> 02:17:06,912
''Janki is not in her senses.
See, the ambulance has come.''

552
02:17:07,251 --> 02:17:11,517
She's going to the hospital.
Please give her way. Let her go.

553
02:17:16,526 --> 02:17:20,519
Where are you going?
Have you gone mad? You stay here.

554
02:17:22,332 --> 02:17:25,563
She's experienced everything!
- She even smokes!

555
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:30,001
''Slut! Go, drown yourself!
- She has maligned herself everywhere!''

556
02:17:30,274 --> 02:17:33,072
She boozes!
- Whose child are you carrying?

557
02:17:33,343 --> 02:17:35,937
Must be Purushottam's!
- Coming with me?

558
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:38,874
Move on! What are you glaring at?

559
02:17:38,949 --> 02:17:39,938
No!

560
02:17:41,018 --> 02:17:42,849
Don't!
- What are you doing?

561
02:17:44,788 --> 02:17:46,483
She's pregnant!

562
02:18:17,854 --> 02:18:20,049
''Vaidehi, l lost my baby...''

563
02:18:21,058 --> 02:18:24,255
''No, Janki...
- l've lost it!''

564
02:18:38,008 --> 02:18:39,805
Janki had lost her senses.

565
02:18:40,277 --> 02:18:43,940
''lf she were right in the head,
would she do this on stage?''

566
02:18:44,448 --> 02:18:47,281
She had to go to the asylum
and so she's gone.

567
02:18:48,485 --> 02:18:51,283
Scoundrel! You should
be sent to the asylum!

568
02:18:54,024 --> 02:18:56,788
''No, not even there...''

569
02:18:58,295 --> 02:19:00,286
You won't even spare the lunatics.

570
02:19:01,298 --> 02:19:05,792
A bestial monster like yourself
should be bound in a cage at zoo!

571
02:19:07,104 --> 02:19:09,095
Don't you have any shame
talking to elders like this?

572
02:19:09,306 --> 02:19:13,106
When you have no shame marrying a wife
half your age why should l be ashamed?

573
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:15,535
''Good gracious.
Lata, go upstairs.''

574
02:19:15,879 --> 02:19:17,972
Women of good homes
shouldn't even hear such words.

575
02:19:18,315 --> 02:19:21,113
''And men of good families,
even with a wife at home...''

576
02:19:21,318 --> 02:19:24,446
have the liberty
to ogle at other women!

577
02:19:25,756 --> 02:19:30,125
You men don't trust your own selves.
That is why you keep women in veil!

578
02:19:30,494 --> 02:19:33,986
You hide her in corners!
lmprison her behind bars!

579
02:19:34,331 --> 02:19:38,631
Keep quiet!
- l won't. l know everything!

580
02:19:39,336 --> 02:19:42,430
Those were your hired goons
who hurt Janki!

581
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,331
l'll tell the police!

582
02:19:46,343 --> 02:19:48,277
Where are you going?

583
02:19:49,079 --> 02:19:50,944
l have called up your husband.

584
02:19:51,281 --> 02:19:54,273
He must be on his way with
the reward and the cops.

585
02:19:54,985 --> 02:19:56,953
Let me go!
- Does one let go of a lakh of rupees?

586
02:19:57,287 --> 02:19:59,084
Leave her.
- Who spoke?

587
02:19:59,356 --> 02:20:01,085
l said let her go!

588
02:20:01,291 --> 02:20:03,521
You know nothing...
- l know everything!

589
02:20:05,228 --> 02:20:09,096
Leave her. Or should l fling this?
And blow your skull to pieces?

590
02:20:09,966 --> 02:20:11,627
Move back! Move!!

591
02:20:16,306 --> 02:20:17,637
Come with me.

592
02:20:19,509 --> 02:20:22,967
l forgive you. Do not return.
Assume your husband is dead.

593
02:20:23,313 --> 02:20:26,305
How can l let my Godlike
husband die so easily?

594
02:20:26,917 --> 02:20:29,317
l still have to take my revenge.

595
02:20:30,754 --> 02:20:35,487
l've fasted for you for so many years.
l too should get some reward for it.

596
02:20:37,127 --> 02:20:39,118
l will return.
Come with me.

597
02:20:39,596 --> 02:20:43,430
She will take revenge.
And the other will lock me in a zoo.

598
02:20:48,405 --> 02:20:51,533
What man? Boozed to the gills?
We've been knocking for so long!

599
02:20:51,975 --> 02:20:54,273
''Are you Purushottam?
- Yes, l am.''

600
02:20:54,544 --> 02:20:57,012
l am Raghuveer. Where is my wife?
- With my wife.

601
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:59,942
And your wife?
- With your wife.

602
02:21:00,283 --> 02:21:04,982
lf l hit you with my broken arm
your head will split wide open!

603
02:21:05,288 --> 02:21:07,153
Speak the truth!
- That is the truth.

604
02:21:07,290 --> 02:21:09,952
My wife ran away with his wife.

605
02:21:10,293 --> 02:21:13,285
Bad times! l've heard of men
eloping with women.

606
02:21:13,430 --> 02:21:16,092
But for the first time
l'm hearing of women running away!

607
02:21:16,299 --> 02:21:18,290
Devastation! lt's true.
The bell proves it.

608
02:21:21,104 --> 02:21:22,093
Coming.

609
02:21:22,572 --> 02:21:24,972
Vaidehi was seen
in the Awadh Express.

610
02:21:25,442 --> 02:21:26,636
Listen...
- Yes?

611
02:21:26,977 --> 02:21:28,842
lf you find my wife...
- We'll send her.

612
02:21:29,079 --> 02:21:32,879
No! Take her along.
- For what? Rent her out?

613
02:21:33,216 --> 02:21:34,615
Stupid jerk!

614
02:21:58,275 --> 02:22:04,271
''The impish breeze was
flowing in its' own way''

615
02:22:06,283 --> 02:22:10,049
''Somebody gave it agony''

616
02:22:10,420 --> 02:22:12,411
''And took the wings away''

617
02:22:14,858 --> 02:22:20,296
''The impish breeze was
flowing in its' own way''

618
02:22:22,699 --> 02:22:26,294
''Somebody gave it agony''

619
02:22:27,037 --> 02:22:28,971
''And took the wings away''

620
02:22:31,308 --> 02:22:34,641
''The weather changed.
The song broke''

621
02:22:35,011 --> 02:22:38,310
''Silence permeated''

622
02:22:39,115 --> 02:22:42,983
''What path, which city...''

623
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:46,312
''where are you headed?''

624
02:22:47,257 --> 02:22:54,060
''Tired eyes look for its' home''

625
02:23:30,567 --> 02:23:31,966
Hail Mother!

626
02:23:32,302 --> 02:23:35,100
You? Here? Don't interfere.

627
02:23:35,472 --> 02:23:38,305
l warn you or you
won't leave unscathed!

628
02:23:40,977 --> 02:23:44,310
''Mother, don't worry.
Bulwa is here. He will save us.''

629
02:23:44,714 --> 02:23:46,306
Hear that?

630
02:23:46,449 --> 02:23:50,249
The kid understood.
But you didn't.

631
02:23:52,956 --> 02:23:57,120
Return everyone's stuff.
And quietly jump out the back door.

632
02:23:59,296 --> 02:24:03,062
Don't act too smart!
This isn't your territory!

633
02:24:03,366 --> 02:24:08,770
Dogs have their territories.
Storms and typhoons have no area!

634
02:24:09,406 --> 02:24:13,843
Quickly take your pick.
Do you want to escape or die?

635
02:24:14,177 --> 02:24:18,079
l warn you once again.
- Why are you wasting time arguing?

636
02:24:18,281 --> 02:24:22,081
''lf we chop off his head,
we'll get Rs.200000 as reward!''

637
02:24:22,419 --> 02:24:25,388
Manliness isn't measured
by the length of your moustache.

638
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:31,818
Those who are men
never hurt women and kids.

639
02:24:32,295 --> 02:24:37,289
''And those who do,
Bulwa loves to hunt such beasts.''

640
02:24:38,368 --> 02:24:40,097
Shut your eyes.

641
02:25:12,502 --> 02:25:14,595
''You, here? Who is this?''

642
02:25:14,938 --> 02:25:17,270
She fainted in the train.
She's also running fever.

643
02:25:17,974 --> 02:25:20,408
Take her to Aunt Dulaari.
- Yes.

644
02:25:22,011 --> 02:25:23,000
Gently...

645
02:25:26,282 --> 02:25:28,011
Keep this.
- No...

646
02:25:28,284 --> 02:25:29,273
Keep it.

647
02:25:29,419 --> 02:25:32,684
Shall l come along?
- No. l'll take her.

648
02:25:33,022 --> 02:25:36,958
''Along with the cops, Gajendra
is looking for you.''

649
02:25:38,428 --> 02:25:43,957
l met Gajendra's dogs in the train.
l cut the tickets for 5 of them.

650
02:25:52,475 --> 02:25:54,238
Feeling very sleepy?

651
02:25:55,245 --> 02:25:56,576
Press properly.

652
02:25:56,846 --> 02:26:00,304
Think of it as my neck
not my leg and press.

653
02:26:00,917 --> 02:26:04,409
''Then your arms will find the strength.
- Master, that's enterprising.''

654
02:26:04,754 --> 02:26:10,249
Only you take advantage of hatred.
You are indeed admirable.

655
02:26:15,131 --> 02:26:17,565
Yes master?
- Has the train arrived?

656
02:26:17,867 --> 02:26:20,267
''Yes, master.
- Whom are you taking?''

657
02:26:21,271 --> 02:26:23,603
A female patient.
- l see.

658
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:26,272
''Taking her to Dulaari?
- Yes, master.''

659
02:26:26,743 --> 02:26:28,472
Carry on.
- Good day.

660
02:26:36,286 --> 02:26:41,019
She treats everyone.
But she won't treat me.

661
02:26:42,058 --> 02:26:43,787
Congratulations.

662
02:26:45,895 --> 02:26:47,692
The mother and child are fit and fine.

663
02:26:48,031 --> 02:26:51,899
Congratulations.
- ls it a son?

664
02:26:52,368 --> 02:26:56,031
Why do you harp on about
a boy? lt's a goddess.

665
02:26:56,339 --> 02:27:00,241
Girl again!
- Why are you holding your head?

666
02:27:00,643 --> 02:27:02,907
As if it's a problem not a girl.

667
02:27:03,246 --> 02:27:05,646
Have you forgotten
when you were unemployed?

668
02:27:05,982 --> 02:27:10,442
Only after Dhaniya's birth
was your house built.

669
02:27:10,987 --> 02:27:13,478
Damn fool! You've made
so much progress since!

670
02:27:14,057 --> 02:27:17,254
Thank God and sing His praise.

671
02:27:31,274 --> 02:27:34,266
Keep lying. Consider this your house.

672
02:27:35,411 --> 02:27:39,279
''Tell me, where are you going?''

673
02:27:40,283 --> 02:27:45,084
And all alone?
Neither husband nor parents.

674
02:27:48,224 --> 02:27:51,216
All right. Don't talk
if you don't want to.

675
02:27:51,928 --> 02:27:56,661
But don't worry.
Worry harms the baby.

676
02:27:58,234 --> 02:28:02,898
How do you know?
- Listen to her! l'm the midwife here.

677
02:28:04,974 --> 02:28:07,408
Aunt! Hurry!!
- What happened?

678
02:28:07,744 --> 02:28:10,042
Papa and Uncle are drowning
Pooja in milk!

679
02:28:10,313 --> 02:28:11,439
Good God!!

680
02:28:12,248 --> 02:28:14,239
They are out of their minds!

681
02:28:14,584 --> 02:28:17,576
What's the matter?
- The baby that was just born..

682
02:28:17,921 --> 02:28:20,651
Her father wants to kill her
by drowning her in milk!

683
02:28:21,257 --> 02:28:24,749
Dear God! Send her back as a boy!

684
02:28:25,828 --> 02:28:27,523
Accept her back!

685
02:28:28,264 --> 02:28:30,255
''Take her back, dear God!!''

686
02:28:33,002 --> 02:28:33,991
No!

687
02:28:36,839 --> 02:28:40,605
You sinner! What were you up to?

688
02:28:42,278 --> 02:28:47,978
What has this little thing done
to you? She is a gift of God!

689
02:28:48,284 --> 02:28:51,378
But she won't carry brother's name!
The first born is already a girl!

690
02:28:52,689 --> 02:28:54,486
Shut up! Dowry mongers!

691
02:28:55,091 --> 02:28:57,082
You men are a burden to earth!

692
02:28:58,027 --> 02:29:02,361
''lf this was done to your mother,
how would you take birth?''

693
02:29:05,301 --> 02:29:07,030
Murderers! This is a latent mother!

694
02:29:07,637 --> 02:29:11,232
What will remain in the
world if you kill a mother?

695
02:29:12,308 --> 02:29:13,969
My baby...!

696
02:29:21,317 --> 02:29:23,979
You remember 6 dead bodies!
And you're filing the report.

697
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:27,988
But one living girl is missing
and you know nothing about it!

698
02:29:29,325 --> 02:29:30,986
''Just a minute, Mr. Raghunath.''

699
02:29:31,127 --> 02:29:34,324
They are scared out of their wits
because of the bloodshed.

700
02:29:35,031 --> 02:29:38,990
''But their talk proves this without
doubt, your wife is in this area.''

701
02:29:39,335 --> 02:29:40,927
We will find her.

702
02:29:42,338 --> 02:29:43,669
You will.

703
02:29:44,841 --> 02:29:46,001
You will.

704
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:53,271
''What is the reward sum?
- 100,000.''

705
02:29:53,383 --> 02:29:56,284
''lncrease it.
Hike it by 200,000 or 5000000''

706
02:29:57,053 --> 02:30:02,685
So much so that whoever has given her
refuge feels greed instead of mercy.

707
02:30:05,094 --> 02:30:08,291
What's the matter?
Why are your hands trembling?

708
02:30:11,034 --> 02:30:16,438
''lf you hadn't reached there in time
they would've killed the child, no?''

709
02:30:18,007 --> 02:30:20,305
They are butchers.

710
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:22,873
A girl is a burden for them.

711
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:26,038
Look over there.

712
02:30:26,315 --> 02:30:30,649
That 10 year old girl
is carrying double her weight.

713
02:30:31,521 --> 02:30:35,321
''Now tell me, who is the
burden and who is carrying it!''

714
02:30:37,126 --> 02:30:39,458
And look at 7 year old Kajri.

715
02:30:40,730 --> 02:30:43,528
She stands holding her
little brother on her waist.

716
02:30:44,467 --> 02:30:47,402
lsn't this her age to be playing?

717
02:30:47,737 --> 02:30:51,434
But how will she play? She's
half a mother at this tender age!

718
02:30:51,774 --> 02:30:55,471
When did her childhood
come and leave..? Nobody knows.

719
02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:00,010
ln 2 years she'll be
cooking for her father.

720
02:31:00,283 --> 02:31:06,085
Another 2 years and she'll cook
for her husband and family.

721
02:31:06,422 --> 02:31:08,481
As well as work in the fields.

722
02:31:09,292 --> 02:31:12,955
''ln a short time, she'll bear
a couple of kids and grow old.''

723
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:19,595
That's a woman's life in our country.
Serve man and die!

724
02:31:20,303 --> 02:31:25,605
And men have the gall to say
that a woman is the door to Hell!

725
02:31:26,309 --> 02:31:30,302
You stupid men have come
to earth via that very door!

726
02:31:31,481 --> 02:31:33,506
Yet they refer to her as a burden!

727
02:31:34,117 --> 02:31:38,520
''Not a burden, woman is the
force that carries burdens!''

728
02:31:39,122 --> 02:31:41,317
Take my own daughter-in-law's example.

729
02:31:42,091 --> 02:31:47,529
''Yes, she is my daughter-in-law.
And my son, her husband...''

730
02:31:47,864 --> 02:31:53,063
''he left his mother, child and wife
and ran away. ln search of God.''

731
02:31:53,402 --> 02:31:56,929
Excrete of a cat!
Of no use to anyone!

732
02:31:57,273 --> 02:32:00,731
''Wretch! Ominous fellow!
- Mother, now stop it.''

733
02:32:01,277 --> 02:32:06,613
Why? Have you ever heard of a
woman running off in search of God?

734
02:32:07,016 --> 02:32:08,950
Deserting her husband and child?

735
02:32:09,452 --> 02:32:13,946
My daughter-in-law performs
the duties my son should have!

736
02:32:14,423 --> 02:32:18,689
''Looked after the house, worked
day and night for her son, Prakash.''

737
02:32:19,028 --> 02:32:21,758
Sent him to school.
- Then to college.

738
02:32:22,031 --> 02:32:25,967
Graduation and now
law studies. L.L.B.

739
02:32:26,102 --> 02:32:28,093
And a computer expert.

740
02:32:28,504 --> 02:32:31,632
He is coming tomorrow
with a computer for me.

741
02:32:32,308 --> 02:32:37,712
Oh yes. lt will be the first computer
in 20 villages! First and only.

742
02:32:38,648 --> 02:32:43,312
''Aunt, you're very fond of English.
- Not fond of..''

743
02:32:43,719 --> 02:32:45,448
l can't help it.

744
02:32:45,621 --> 02:32:48,249
Our own language isn't
appreciated in our nation.

745
02:32:48,391 --> 02:32:50,916
''All around, it's only English.''

746
02:32:51,494 --> 02:32:54,588
So l thought let me learn it.

747
02:32:54,997 --> 02:32:57,056
l memorised huge thick books.

748
02:32:57,400 --> 02:32:59,925
Start to finish.
Just like that only.

749
02:33:12,114 --> 02:33:13,843
Did l say something wrong?

750
02:33:21,090 --> 02:33:23,684
What is the matter?
No work in the fields?

751
02:33:23,993 --> 02:33:29,056
There is but Phoolmati
didn't come to work for 2 days.

752
02:33:29,298 --> 02:33:33,530
''l asked her today and she
says, she won't work anymore.''

753
02:33:35,304 --> 02:33:37,534
Phoolmati has full liberty.

754
02:33:37,974 --> 02:33:43,606
She's the only one in the village
who wears flowers in her hair.

755
02:33:44,313 --> 02:33:49,250
From tomorrow you'll work in my house
not the fields. Serving me. Okay?

756
02:33:49,652 --> 02:33:52,780
''Master, l can't come.''

757
02:33:54,257 --> 02:33:57,658
l... l'm working for Aunt Ram Dulaari.

758
02:33:58,527 --> 02:34:02,588
l'm paid more there.
- Chop it!

759
02:34:02,865 --> 02:34:06,767
Chop her hair off!
And darken her face!

760
02:34:07,270 --> 02:34:13,800
''Lord Ram is the groom.
Music plays all around''

761
02:34:14,176 --> 02:34:16,576
This assignment is ready.

762
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:21,080
How much for Shahjahanpur?
- l'll tell you tomorrow.

763
02:34:21,517 --> 02:34:24,953
lt is 5 o'clock.
Your shift ends now.

764
02:34:25,288 --> 02:34:28,485
Now go home and cook
dinner for your menfolk.

765
02:34:29,058 --> 02:34:33,290
''And all those who want
advance, take it today.''

766
02:34:33,596 --> 02:34:35,291
l don't want any.

767
02:34:36,365 --> 02:34:38,833
''l want Rs. 100.
- Okay, take it.''

768
02:34:41,304 --> 02:34:43,295
Sign this voucher.

769
02:34:50,246 --> 02:34:54,580
What is this? l've been
teaching you for so long...

770
02:34:54,917 --> 02:34:59,581
and you're still using the thumb?
Sign or l won't give the money!

771
02:34:59,855 --> 02:35:04,315
l can't sign properly as yet.
- No problem. Take your time.

772
02:35:19,275 --> 02:35:20,606
That's better.

773
02:35:25,281 --> 02:35:28,079
''Honestly aunt, you are
doing a darn good job.''

774
02:35:28,417 --> 02:35:33,514
lt's necessary. There's
only one way to reform women.

775
02:35:33,856 --> 02:35:35,517
Education.

776
02:35:36,292 --> 02:35:38,089
And what do they call it...?

777
02:35:43,299 --> 02:35:46,291
You speak quite good English.

778
02:35:52,041 --> 02:35:53,906
What happened to her?

779
02:35:54,243 --> 02:35:58,646
She refused to work in Gajendra's
field. And this is what Birendra did!

780
02:35:58,981 --> 02:36:02,041
What? May vultures feast on
the scoundrel's flesh!

781
02:36:05,054 --> 02:36:07,522
Don't worry.

782
02:36:07,957 --> 02:36:10,391
Wash her face.

783
02:36:11,994 --> 02:36:15,555
Don't you worry. Consider that
you've evaded a problem.

784
02:36:17,266 --> 02:36:21,259
What happened? Who did this?
- Gajendra and Virendra.

785
02:36:22,371 --> 02:36:26,432
These two marauders were
born when 100 demons died!

786
02:36:27,276 --> 02:36:34,079
He was lucky that Bulwa missed.
Or he'd have lost his neck!

787
02:36:35,017 --> 02:36:37,781
He only lost an arm. Nothing else.

788
02:36:38,287 --> 02:36:43,281
The village faced a severe drought
when Bulwa was about 7 years old.

789
02:36:44,026 --> 02:36:48,224
Not a drop of water in the village.
Bulwa's throat was parched.

790
02:36:48,531 --> 02:36:52,228
Gajendra had water in his well.
Bulwa's mother pleaded with him..

791
02:36:53,035 --> 02:36:56,232
The scoundrel put his hand in
her blouse in return for water!

792
02:36:56,906 --> 02:36:59,898
Then his mother threw
the pitcher at his head.

793
02:37:01,577 --> 02:37:04,239
Gajendra accused her of theft.

794
02:37:04,580 --> 02:37:07,572
And sentenced her hands
to be doused in boiling oil.

795
02:37:13,389 --> 02:37:15,914
''Time has changed, not the situation.''

796
02:37:17,960 --> 02:37:20,861
From Bulwa's mother to Phoolmati..

797
02:37:22,431 --> 02:37:25,264
Woman remains in
exactly the same place.

798
02:37:26,402 --> 02:37:28,393
lt will change.

799
02:37:30,005 --> 02:37:32,940
When woman learns to
appreciate herself.

800
02:37:34,009 --> 02:37:38,412
When she respects herself.
Only then will others honour her.

801
02:37:44,286 --> 02:37:47,016
''Are your results out?
- Yes, second division.''

802
02:37:48,457 --> 02:37:52,894
But we had bribed for first division.
- These professors are cheats.

803
02:37:53,229 --> 02:37:56,892
Tomorrow itself l'll beat them up
The next exam will be in hospital.

804
02:37:58,033 --> 02:38:01,230
Let it be. But do warn them.

805
02:38:01,570 --> 02:38:05,904
Next time if my child doesn't
top. l'll open up his top.

806
02:38:08,010 --> 02:38:10,001
So what's the news about
my darling daughter?

807
02:38:10,246 --> 02:38:11,440
l'm fine.

808
02:38:12,414 --> 02:38:17,784
You've come at the right time.
Write me a speech for the election.

809
02:38:18,254 --> 02:38:20,916
Ask Prakash to write.
He's very smart.

810
02:38:21,257 --> 02:38:24,590
Who is he? Pandey's son?
- No..

811
02:38:24,927 --> 02:38:29,728
''He must be Harpat's son.
- No, Aunt Ram Dulaari's son.''

812
02:38:31,267 --> 02:38:34,964
Ram Dulaari's son?
- Son of a low caste! lmpossible!

813
02:38:35,271 --> 02:38:40,675
He's very capable. He's getting a
computer from the city for his mother.

814
02:38:41,010 --> 02:38:44,275
What's that? Spare part of a tractor?

815
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:49,949
A computer is a miracle.
lt alone can do the work of 10 men!

816
02:38:50,286 --> 02:38:51,844
Really?
- Yes.

817
02:38:52,087 --> 02:38:54,282
Can it lift my tractor by itself?

818
02:38:56,091 --> 02:39:00,027
Dimwit! This is why
l'd tell you to study.

819
02:39:02,031 --> 02:39:04,022
Take your uncle to see the computer.

820
02:39:04,300 --> 02:39:08,862
Check what Ram Dulaari intends
doing with the computer here.

821
02:39:15,511 --> 02:39:17,308
Bless me.
- God bless.

822
02:39:20,249 --> 02:39:23,309
''Okay, now put this away
and you sit here.''

823
02:39:24,320 --> 02:39:26,481
Now inaugurate it.

824
02:39:27,122 --> 02:39:29,784
''Do you remember how?
- Yes, l know all.''

825
02:39:30,125 --> 02:39:34,323
You taught me. First..
l press this button. Right?

826
02:39:46,008 --> 02:39:47,771
This is a miracle!

827
02:39:51,447 --> 02:39:53,540
See that?
- This really is a miracle!

828
02:39:57,853 --> 02:40:00,413
How is it?
- Beautiful.

829
02:40:01,290 --> 02:40:02,518
Glorious.

830
02:40:03,525 --> 02:40:08,292
l've never seen this lady before.
- We've come to see the computer!

831
02:40:11,300 --> 02:40:12,289
lt's nice.

832
02:40:13,869 --> 02:40:16,099
Nice... let's leave.

833
02:40:16,972 --> 02:40:18,303
What a wonder!

834
02:40:23,045 --> 02:40:24,945
There! Gone again.

835
02:40:25,614 --> 02:40:27,707
The light goes more
often that it remains.

836
02:40:29,018 --> 02:40:33,580
You will laugh. You have electricity.
Only my home is dark.

837
02:40:35,024 --> 02:40:36,013
l'll leave.

838
02:40:36,325 --> 02:40:41,524
You just came. The city was better.
We'd meet more often.

839
02:40:41,864 --> 02:40:43,991
''We'd go out, watch films.''

840
02:40:44,333 --> 02:40:46,995
Here you stay aloof.
You don't meet at all!

841
02:40:47,269 --> 02:40:52,366
Meeting is fine but what next?
lf somebody finds out...

842
02:40:53,275 --> 02:40:55,743
The very thought scares me.
- There you go again!

843
02:40:56,078 --> 02:41:00,071
''l told you, when you stand first in
the state and your photo...''

844
02:41:00,282 --> 02:41:04,776
is published then nobody will object
and l'll convince Papa too.

845
02:41:05,220 --> 02:41:07,450
So this is the plan?

846
02:41:08,424 --> 02:41:10,585
May God fulfill your wish.

847
02:41:11,060 --> 02:41:14,086
Now l better leave or l'll
miss the last bus to Makhanpur.

848
02:41:14,296 --> 02:41:18,096
When will you return?
- Friends' wedding is at night.

849
02:41:18,434 --> 02:41:20,629
l'll return by the morning bus.
- Sure?

850
02:41:20,803 --> 02:41:21,792
Yes.

851
02:41:25,874 --> 02:41:30,368
Special announcement.
A lady named Vaidehi Bajaj..

852
02:41:30,713 --> 02:41:32,010
Brother!
- Yes?

853
02:41:32,314 --> 02:41:36,444
l saw this woman.
- Really? Where?

854
02:41:36,785 --> 02:41:39,310
At Ram Dulaari's.
- Dimwit. You are drunk.

855
02:41:39,621 --> 02:41:43,489
What would a girl from
the city do in the village?

856
02:41:43,826 --> 02:41:48,923
Birendra can't be wrong
where women are concerned.

857
02:41:49,264 --> 02:41:51,630
Just a minute.
- What are you up to?

858
02:41:51,967 --> 02:41:54,401
A reward of Rs. 10 lakhs.
- 0... 9..

859
02:41:59,241 --> 02:42:04,543
''Birendra, younger brother of
Gajendra from Bhawanipur here.''

860
02:42:04,947 --> 02:42:06,676
Yes?
- Your madam...

861
02:42:06,949 --> 02:42:10,282
the photo on television..
Are you listening?

862
02:42:12,287 --> 02:42:16,690
l heard it in the garden! Was he born
with a loudspeaker? What says he?

863
02:42:18,293 --> 02:42:22,627
ls what you're saying right?
- Cent per cent.

864
02:42:22,898 --> 02:42:27,096
Bring the money and take the girl.

865
02:42:28,837 --> 02:42:32,102
Fine. We'll meet at the
address you said tomorrow.

866
02:42:32,474 --> 02:42:36,808
l've arranged for you
to win the election!

867
02:42:37,112 --> 02:42:39,103
We'll kidnap the city girl.

868
02:42:40,315 --> 02:42:42,647
''Master, l've cut the connection.
- Well done.''

869
02:42:42,918 --> 02:42:46,319
What connection?
- Ram Dulaari's electric connection.

870
02:42:46,555 --> 02:42:53,051
She has been teaching computer to
the oafs. Now let's see her teach!

871
02:42:53,962 --> 02:42:58,399
lt's only the electric
connection that's been cut. But..

872
02:42:59,268 --> 02:43:04,604
The connection of this house
is tightly connected to hers.

873
02:43:07,476 --> 02:43:10,934
What do you mean?
- Sushma is slipping.

874
02:43:12,981 --> 02:43:16,508
What the heck are you saying?
l'll chop your tongue to pieces!

875
02:43:16,852 --> 02:43:21,084
My tongue and eyes belong to you.

876
02:43:21,523 --> 02:43:26,790
l did see Sushma with Ram
Dulaari's son Prakash.

877
02:43:36,405 --> 02:43:38,965
Where will that boy be found? Where?

878
02:43:39,308 --> 02:43:41,970
He has gone to Makhanpur.
For a friend's wedding.

879
02:43:42,911 --> 02:43:45,209
He will return by the morning bus.

880
02:43:52,988 --> 02:43:56,719
Brother... don't worry one bit.

881
02:43:59,261 --> 02:44:00,751
Don't worry one bit.

882
02:44:02,264 --> 02:44:05,427
Prakash who dared to
lay his eyes on Sushma...

883
02:44:05,601 --> 02:44:08,001
l'll kill him and
bury him in the field!

884
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:10,465
No... no little one.

885
02:44:12,274 --> 02:44:16,438
Such an easy death won't
give my heart any solace.

886
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:20,942
Nor will that lowly
caste learn a lesson.

887
02:44:22,284 --> 02:44:23,273
No.

888
02:44:24,286 --> 02:44:25,878
Castrate the rascal!

889
02:44:27,189 --> 02:44:28,952
Chop and hurl his weapon away!

890
02:44:32,294 --> 02:44:34,421
Seems like a long drawn affair.

891
02:44:36,031 --> 02:44:37,293
Nothing new.

892
02:44:41,470 --> 02:44:42,630
What happened?

893
02:44:44,473 --> 02:44:47,533
Once there was a
wedding in our village.

894
02:44:48,243 --> 02:44:50,575
Suddenly the lights went out.

895
02:44:51,046 --> 02:44:57,042
Do you know whom the groom
garlanded instead of the bride?

896
02:44:57,953 --> 02:44:59,716
His own mother-in-law!

897
02:45:09,264 --> 02:45:11,061
Hang on.

898
02:45:14,536 --> 02:45:17,994
What happened? Why
are you so frightened?

899
02:45:18,273 --> 02:45:23,677
Do something fast! Send message
to Prakash not to return.

900
02:45:24,012 --> 02:45:25,741
Why?
- His life is in danger!

901
02:45:25,948 --> 02:45:31,284
Good God! What are you saying?
Why would his life be in danger?

902
02:45:32,955 --> 02:45:36,948
What has he done? Tell me.
Who wants to kill him?

903
02:45:37,459 --> 02:45:38,619
Tell me!

904
02:45:40,529 --> 02:45:41,791
My Papa.

905
02:45:43,465 --> 02:45:44,489
Why?

906
02:45:46,969 --> 02:45:49,904
Why?
- He has found out..

907
02:45:50,238 --> 02:45:52,900
Prakash and l love each other.

908
02:45:56,244 --> 02:45:57,575
Love?

909
02:45:58,947 --> 02:46:02,041
Wretch! Why did you do this? Why?

910
02:46:02,484 --> 02:46:06,921
Why did you do this? Oh why?

911
02:46:11,393 --> 02:46:13,258
Woe upon us!

912
02:46:14,496 --> 02:46:18,592
Woe upon us!
We will be destroyed!

913
02:46:20,135 --> 02:46:21,932
We are ruined!

914
02:46:22,404 --> 02:46:29,071
''All my efforts, my penance....
she shattered all my dreams!''

915
02:46:32,280 --> 02:46:33,679
We are ruined!

916
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:39,750
Couldn't she find anybody other
than my son in this world?

917
02:46:41,356 --> 02:46:44,291
We are ruined! Ruined!

918
02:46:48,296 --> 02:46:51,390
''Child, l beg you...''

919
02:46:51,967 --> 02:46:55,528
l beseech you
spare his life!

920
02:46:56,972 --> 02:47:01,568
Don't take him away from me!
l have nobody but him!

921
02:47:04,946 --> 02:47:09,383
Forget him. Please.
- l'll forget everything.

922
02:47:11,253 --> 02:47:13,483
But save his life!

923
02:47:13,989 --> 02:47:17,049
l'll go to Makhanpur if you won't.

924
02:47:17,559 --> 02:47:18,548
No!

925
02:47:19,061 --> 02:47:21,256
No! You don't go there!

926
02:47:22,064 --> 02:47:27,263
l will go but l won't
let you go there. never.

927
02:47:45,387 --> 02:47:47,878
''As soon as dawn breaks,
that boy will be...''

928
02:47:53,228 --> 02:47:54,752
''My respects, master.''

929
02:47:57,766 --> 02:48:02,362
The child had a tummy ache.
l've given her the medicine.

930
02:48:04,473 --> 02:48:08,375
lt was quite late in
the night so l thought..

931
02:48:09,244 --> 02:48:11,371
l'll escort the child home.

932
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:13,238
Go to your room.

933
02:48:21,990 --> 02:48:25,983
''l'll take leave, master.
- Won't you take your fees?''

934
02:48:28,997 --> 02:48:31,591
''No master, there's no need.''

935
02:48:31,933 --> 02:48:35,596
''Are you doing me a favour?
- No, master. That's not true.''

936
02:48:35,937 --> 02:48:40,033
Take it if brother
gives it with love.

937
02:48:40,075 --> 02:48:41,542
Come...come here.

938
02:49:06,301 --> 02:49:08,292
You're no human but a beast!

939
02:49:12,307 --> 02:49:14,104
Shut up.
- No yelling.

940
02:49:14,709 --> 02:49:17,439
We'll parade both of you
naked through the village!

941
02:49:17,779 --> 02:49:20,475
She's the woman l told you about!

942
02:49:22,317 --> 02:49:27,050
Lock Ram Dulaari in her own house.
And lock this woman upstairs.

943
02:49:27,389 --> 02:49:31,792
''No, master! Let her go!
She has nothing to do with this.''

944
02:49:32,127 --> 02:49:35,324
She's in grave trouble!
- We'll erase her troubles.

945
02:49:35,497 --> 02:49:38,466
Her husband is coming
with 10 lakhs tomorrow.

946
02:49:39,634 --> 02:49:42,228
''Master, no..!
- Take her away!''

947
02:49:42,504 --> 02:49:44,335
''Let her go, master.''

948
02:49:44,906 --> 02:49:46,601
Take her away!
- Master!!

949
02:49:51,747 --> 02:49:55,148
Listen...!
Sushma isn't in her room.

950
02:49:55,484 --> 02:49:57,213
The city woman too is missing.

951
02:50:02,858 --> 02:50:06,157
The city lady has kidnapped Sushma!

952
02:50:06,495 --> 02:50:08,963
l'm sure they've gone
to the bus station!

953
02:50:14,569 --> 02:50:16,434
Stop! Stop the bus!

954
02:50:18,907 --> 02:50:21,102
What's the matter?
- You can't go to the village!

955
02:50:21,310 --> 02:50:24,370
We must go back to the city.
- Why to the city?

956
02:50:24,713 --> 02:50:27,705
No questions. We must leave. Pronto!
- What's wrong?

957
02:50:27,849 --> 02:50:30,010
''ls everything all right back home?
- Yes, come on!''

958
02:51:03,418 --> 02:51:04,749
Praise the Mother!

959
02:51:08,056 --> 02:51:12,755
Our enmity is different
from this matter here.

960
02:51:12,894 --> 02:51:16,261
Ram Dulaari's son has
kidnapped Sushma!

961
02:51:17,432 --> 02:51:19,696
And this city lass supported him!

962
02:51:20,702 --> 02:51:22,499
''No, l came of my own accord!''

963
02:51:22,704 --> 02:51:25,502
''Whatever it be, now it's a
matter of Gajendra's honour!''

964
02:51:25,807 --> 02:51:27,798
Hats off to your Gajendra!

965
02:51:28,443 --> 02:51:31,173
He has no concern for
the honour of the poor.

966
02:51:31,513 --> 02:51:34,505
''Whenever he feels like it,
rubs and snuffs it!''

967
02:51:34,716 --> 02:51:37,514
''When it comes to himself,
he screams in anguish!''

968
02:51:37,853 --> 02:51:41,380
When he has sown bitterness
how can he reap sweetness?

969
02:51:41,523 --> 02:51:47,393
Once again we warn you hand them over
to us! Gajendra will settle scores.

970
02:51:47,729 --> 02:51:51,529
Will he do justice? The one
who starves his employees...

971
02:51:51,733 --> 02:51:54,725
to fill his godowns?
Will he do justice?

972
02:51:56,071 --> 02:52:00,804
The one who sheds the blood of
innocents in the name of caste?

973
02:52:01,877 --> 02:52:06,541
Tries to dishonour a poor woman
asking for water in times of drought.

974
02:52:06,748 --> 02:52:10,741
Will that Gajendra do justice?
l will do justice now!

975
02:52:11,420 --> 02:52:15,550
This boy kidnapped the girl.
l will bring the father here!

976
02:52:15,891 --> 02:52:20,351
l'll rip his skin and make a poor
man wear the shoe made from it!

977
02:52:21,496 --> 02:52:23,487
What are you waiting for?
He's alone. Kill him!

978
02:52:23,698 --> 02:52:24,687
Bravo!

979
02:53:30,499 --> 02:53:34,367
''Fine, now suffer the consequences
of Gajendra's fury! Now he will..''

980
02:53:34,703 --> 02:53:35,692
Quiet!

981
02:53:36,037 --> 02:53:39,495
He wets his pants when l roar here!

982
02:53:39,908 --> 02:53:41,102
His fury?

983
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:44,035
He won't go to shit
without four gun-toting men!

984
02:53:44,446 --> 02:53:46,243
Threatening me with him!

985
02:53:58,727 --> 02:54:05,223
''Prakash, Sushma and the girl
have gone to the woods. To Bulwa.''

986
02:54:15,010 --> 02:54:19,674
This morning my niece eloped
with a boy from a low caste.

987
02:54:20,682 --> 02:54:22,479
Vaidehi too left with them.

988
02:54:22,951 --> 02:54:25,010
''Yes, terribly dammit!''

989
02:54:25,554 --> 02:54:27,681
The entire house is
dammit with sorrow.

990
02:54:28,690 --> 02:54:31,853
Yours is a professional runner.
Ours eloped for the first time.

991
02:54:32,427 --> 02:54:35,487
See my elder brother
He's furious with anger.

992
02:54:37,299 --> 02:54:40,359
''Any other time, we'd
have burnt down the village!''

993
02:54:40,702 --> 02:54:42,693
But what can we do?
lt's election time.

994
02:54:43,038 --> 02:54:45,506
With great difficulty
brother got the ticket.

995
02:54:45,941 --> 02:54:48,842
''Have you found out where she is?
- She's with our enemy, Bulwa.''

996
02:54:49,711 --> 02:54:53,704
He's a very dangerous man.
- Where will l find this danger?

997
02:54:54,015 --> 02:54:58,952
Where and how and when and if
at all he'll be... He decides that.

998
02:55:09,531 --> 02:55:11,055
Praise the Mother.

999
02:55:12,467 --> 02:55:16,301
''Are you Bulwa?
- Yes, l am.''

1000
02:55:17,405 --> 02:55:20,169
Where is Vaidehi?
Call her. l want to see her.

1001
02:55:20,675 --> 02:55:22,404
l'll have to ask her.

1002
02:55:22,677 --> 02:55:26,169
She's my wife!
- This too l must confirm.

1003
02:55:33,989 --> 02:55:38,358
Can't blame you for this.
Times are bad.

1004
02:55:39,494 --> 02:55:45,194
But not here. We are much
behind time and low in society.

1005
02:55:45,700 --> 02:55:48,032
But a little higher in principles.

1006
02:55:48,703 --> 02:55:52,366
Honesty in my pockets and l risk
my life... that's my asset.

1007
02:55:53,041 --> 02:55:56,704
Every woman is my mother
and l don't sell my mother!

1008
02:55:57,045 --> 02:55:58,569
Blessed is the Mother.

1009
02:56:00,415 --> 02:56:02,383
You talk of high ideals.

1010
02:56:02,717 --> 02:56:05,447
Whereas you keep another
man's wife by force...

1011
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:10,287
Mind your tongue!
Else l'll chop it off right here!

1012
02:56:10,525 --> 02:56:12,584
And you won't be able
to convey a word to Gajendra!

1013
02:56:13,428 --> 02:56:15,225
Look..
- Meeting adjourned.

1014
02:56:17,165 --> 02:56:20,862
l'll get her to Malai Ghat tomorrow
morning. Come and meet her.

1015
02:56:21,670 --> 02:56:25,470
But no use of force.
And come all alone.

1016
02:56:26,374 --> 02:56:28,842
The sentence for
being untrue is death!

1017
02:56:29,477 --> 02:56:31,138
Blessed is the Mother.

1018
02:56:44,392 --> 02:56:47,850
What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

1019
02:56:48,963 --> 02:56:51,488
Because at this moment our daughter..

1020
02:56:51,866 --> 02:56:55,859
is ravaging her honour
lying with that low caste boy.

1021
02:56:56,971 --> 02:57:00,031
And her crazy father
is cremating her.

1022
02:57:02,711 --> 02:57:06,112
She died the day she
shamed us by leaving!

1023
02:57:07,849 --> 02:57:09,214
Offer flowers!

1024
02:57:09,718 --> 02:57:11,049
She is dead!

1025
02:57:12,721 --> 02:57:13,710
Go on!

1026
02:57:17,592 --> 02:57:20,823
Send all our men with
this man to Malai Ghat.

1027
02:57:21,429 --> 02:57:24,796
Bulwa and all his men should be
hacked and thrown in the river!

1028
02:57:27,869 --> 02:57:29,666
We're helping each other because..

1029
02:57:29,804 --> 02:57:33,672
you want Bulwa dead
and l want my wife. Safe

1030
02:57:33,808 --> 02:57:37,437
Two minutes. Two minutes
is all you have.

1031
02:57:37,812 --> 02:57:41,339
Either by force or
anyhow save your wife.

1032
02:57:41,683 --> 02:57:43,674
l'm not responsible for anything.

1033
02:58:13,715 --> 02:58:17,116
Do not be afraid.
Go ahead and meet him.

1034
02:58:33,735 --> 02:58:37,728
''Go on. Sit in the launch.
- Now look, Raghu. Don't use force...''

1035
02:58:38,540 --> 02:58:39,734
We have no time.

1036
02:58:40,742 --> 02:58:44,371
That man you're banking on
is going to be dead in 2 minutes.

1037
02:58:47,248 --> 02:58:49,148
Bulwa! Run away!

1038
02:59:00,762 --> 02:59:04,163
Glory to the Goddess!

1039
03:00:19,040 --> 03:00:22,100
Betrayal will be punished
with death. l told you.

1040
03:00:23,378 --> 03:00:25,710
But you couldn't get it
in your skull...

1041
03:00:33,721 --> 03:00:35,951
You women are your
own worst enemies!

1042
03:00:36,524 --> 03:00:37,718
Go to hell!

1043
03:00:38,726 --> 03:00:42,526
You ought to be thankful you
haven't married an alien...

1044
03:00:42,864 --> 03:00:45,389
you have married a girl
from your own country.

1045
03:00:45,733 --> 03:00:49,726
''Only she could be horrified at your
death, despite all your atrocities.''

1046
03:00:50,271 --> 03:00:54,367
''Or else, your head would have
rolled off your shoulders!''

1047
03:01:03,751 --> 03:01:07,949
''lt isn't just about the baby, Raghu.
lt's about my self-respect.''

1048
03:01:09,757 --> 03:01:11,748
And that's what l'm
trying to protect.

1049
03:01:44,192 --> 03:01:46,057
What a slur on our name!

1050
03:01:49,464 --> 03:01:52,126
lf we don't do something
about it even now...

1051
03:01:52,233 --> 03:01:55,896
the community is going to
call us a bunch of eunuchs.

1052
03:01:57,739 --> 03:02:01,140
What are we to do?
What...?

1053
03:02:01,342 --> 03:02:03,242
We must humiliate Bulwa...

1054
03:02:03,544 --> 03:02:06,138
and teach the lower-castes
a lesson!

1055
03:02:08,983 --> 03:02:12,749
Ram Dulaari!

1056
03:02:13,254 --> 03:02:14,243
No!

1057
03:02:23,231 --> 03:02:24,698
No!

1058
03:02:24,766 --> 03:02:27,826
Give that to me... Give it!
- No!

1059
03:02:33,508 --> 03:02:35,703
Don't anyone dare come closer!

1060
03:02:41,015 --> 03:02:45,042
''Mother! Save me, Mother!''

1061
03:02:50,725 --> 03:02:55,719
''Samariya! Aunt Laxmi...
save me, someone!''

1062
03:02:57,732 --> 03:02:59,723
l have done no harm to anybody!

1063
03:03:00,735 --> 03:03:05,229
Spare me...!
Please let me go!

1064
03:03:05,807 --> 03:03:07,399
Mother!

1065
03:03:11,546 --> 03:03:13,980
Let me go! Please leave me alone!

1066
03:03:14,549 --> 03:03:15,538
Don't!

1067
03:03:20,888 --> 03:03:25,086
Nathu...? You?
You've been a brother to me!

1068
03:03:26,494 --> 03:03:29,691
''Let me go, my son...
Please leave me alone!''

1069
03:03:30,431 --> 03:03:33,093
God! What am l to do...?
Where am l to go?

1070
03:03:35,703 --> 03:03:38,900
''Mangal!
What are you doing, my son?''

1071
03:03:39,440 --> 03:03:41,499
l've always been an aunt to you!

1072
03:03:41,876 --> 03:03:45,710
''Spare me...
Please let me go, my son!''

1073
03:03:46,714 --> 03:03:48,648
Let me go... Nandu!

1074
03:03:50,718 --> 03:03:53,915
''Mother! Birju...
come to my rescue, someone!''

1075
03:04:03,931 --> 03:04:05,398
Hold her down!

1076
03:04:55,983 --> 03:04:57,883
''Last night, Gajendra and Virendra...''

1077
03:04:58,719 --> 03:05:03,713
raped Ram Dulaari
and burnt her alive!

1078
03:06:15,930 --> 03:06:20,333
Master! We have captured Bulwa!
We bring him here in chains!

1079
03:06:34,682 --> 03:06:35,671
Bravo!

1080
03:06:36,684 --> 03:06:40,017
''With the lion bound in chains,
Gajendra comes out in the open!''

1081
03:06:40,421 --> 03:06:42,446
lt's exactly after 14 years...

1082
03:06:43,424 --> 03:06:44,413
6 months...

1083
03:06:44,692 --> 03:06:45,818
8 days...

1084
03:06:46,694 --> 03:06:50,892
''and 4 hours, that l get
to see you again.''

1085
03:06:51,933 --> 03:06:53,764
l remember everything.

1086
03:06:57,705 --> 03:07:00,697
You were bound to remember
every moment!

1087
03:07:01,275 --> 03:07:04,369
l left you with a single hand...
to wash and feed yourself!

1088
03:07:06,113 --> 03:07:09,708
Throw him at my feet!
l'm going to carve him to pieces!

1089
03:07:10,017 --> 03:07:13,714
They aren't your men.
They're my men.

1090
03:07:15,523 --> 03:07:18,515
''To ferret a snake like you out of
its pit, this was the only way!''

1091
03:07:19,660 --> 03:07:24,063
''With a dagger held to his back,
man will do anything he's asked to!''

1092
03:08:41,742 --> 03:08:43,073
Bravo!

1093
03:08:43,844 --> 03:08:46,074
l looked for you among the men...

1094
03:08:47,548 --> 03:08:49,413
''and here you were,
hiding behind the women''

1095
03:08:49,750 --> 03:08:50,910
Bloody eunuch!

1096
03:08:51,252 --> 03:08:56,918
Had you attacked me in a sari...
l might yet have spared you.

1097
03:09:08,536 --> 03:09:10,265
Bulwa! Where are you going?

1098
03:09:10,771 --> 03:09:12,898
''Bulwa! Kill me, before you leave!''

1099
03:09:13,441 --> 03:09:16,433
Know what? l was the one
who raped Ramdulaari!

1100
03:09:16,777 --> 03:09:19,507
''For your mother's sake, Bulwa...
Kill me, before you go!''

1101
03:09:22,850 --> 03:09:27,048
Bulwa! The para-military forces
are here. Gajendra has fled.

1102
03:09:27,221 --> 03:09:28,711
Let's escape! C'mon!

1103
03:09:55,749 --> 03:09:57,740
Hurry up! Quick!

1104
03:10:09,763 --> 03:10:13,426
Behind the hillock is an
army camp. Go ahead safely.

1105
03:10:13,767 --> 03:10:17,100
There's no danger there. Go on!
- How about you?

1106
03:10:17,571 --> 03:10:20,404
You're badly hurt! You must go
to a hospital. Come with us.

1107
03:10:20,708 --> 03:10:23,939
l'm okay. But your life
is in danger. Go on!

1108
03:10:24,445 --> 03:10:28,438
Who do you think you are? What will
you achieve in this condition?

1109
03:10:28,716 --> 03:10:32,049
''All your men are dead!
And you will die, too!''

1110
03:10:39,727 --> 03:10:41,388
l'm the jinxed one

1111
03:10:43,497 --> 03:10:46,125
l bring misfortune to everyone.

1112
03:10:47,601 --> 03:10:50,399
''Maithili, Janki,
Ramdulaari...''

1113
03:10:52,740 --> 03:10:54,401
''and now, it's you.''

1114
03:10:55,476 --> 03:11:00,243
Do not hold yourself responsible.
And do not grieve for them.

1115
03:11:01,415 --> 03:11:05,408
They were brave women
who fought the hypocrites.

1116
03:11:05,953 --> 03:11:08,547
They took on a system
fraught with evil customs.

1117
03:11:08,889 --> 03:11:12,154
And suffering is a
part of one's struggle.

1118
03:11:12,493 --> 03:11:16,520
Have faith in them. Their sacrifice
will not go in vain.

1119
03:11:19,433 --> 03:11:21,196
And do not worry about me.

1120
03:11:21,902 --> 03:11:25,895
Death cannot claim me.
Bulwa is immortal.

1121
03:11:26,473 --> 03:11:30,204
Whenever someone raises a cry
against atrocities and injustice...

1122
03:11:30,511 --> 03:11:32,445
''be sure, Bulwa is somewhere around.''

1123
03:11:34,715 --> 03:11:36,376
l know only this much...

1124
03:11:37,518 --> 03:11:41,386
Humans are those who raise their
voice against injustice.

1125
03:11:41,722 --> 03:11:43,383
They're among the living.

1126
03:11:49,897 --> 03:11:51,728
Glory to the Goddess.

1127
03:11:56,070 --> 03:11:57,401
Glory to the Goddess.

1128
03:12:13,754 --> 03:12:17,918
No praise is enough
for Gajendra Babu.

1129
03:12:18,259 --> 03:12:22,025
''Despite the tragedy back home,
he's here to take part...''

1130
03:12:22,196 --> 03:12:24,687
in the annual day celebrations
of our organization.

1131
03:12:25,165 --> 03:12:26,689
That speaks for his greatness.

1132
03:12:26,834 --> 03:12:31,498
l now request the retired
Chief Justice Mr Srivastava...

1133
03:12:31,839 --> 03:12:35,206
to come to the stage and
felicitate Gajendra Babu.

1134
03:12:47,721 --> 03:12:48,710
Thank you.

1135
03:12:57,731 --> 03:12:59,926
A man who rapes women...

1136
03:13:00,734 --> 03:13:03,259
has no right to beget such honour.

1137
03:13:03,737 --> 03:13:06,900
Go away. You don't know who l am.

1138
03:13:07,241 --> 03:13:12,178
l know. A man who can
rape a pregnant woman...

1139
03:13:12,413 --> 03:13:14,404
can rape his own mother too.

1140
03:13:15,749 --> 03:13:19,344
And you know what you call
such people in your own words.

1141
03:13:25,893 --> 03:13:26,917
Who are you?

1142
03:13:30,698 --> 03:13:34,429
This... this is the
real Gajendra Singh!

1143
03:13:35,703 --> 03:13:38,433
l wanted to expose him
to all of you.

1144
03:13:38,706 --> 03:13:41,436
He's the man who raped Ramdulaari.

1145
03:13:43,177 --> 03:13:44,872
He burnt her alive!

1146
03:13:45,479 --> 03:13:47,709
And you folks are felicitating him...
- She's lying!

1147
03:13:49,049 --> 03:13:51,882
She's a whore!
A woman having loose-moral.

1148
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:55,518
''She's pregnant, but she's
running away from her husband.''

1149
03:13:56,090 --> 03:13:58,081
She has illicit relations
with the bandit Bulwa!

1150
03:13:59,026 --> 03:14:03,224
''He has instigated her and sent her
here, to level accusations at me!''

1151
03:14:03,731 --> 03:14:05,562
What are you watching?
Throw her out.

1152
03:14:05,666 --> 03:14:06,598
Get out...
- Hold it.

1153
03:14:07,201 --> 03:14:08,463
What do you wish to say?

1154
03:14:08,736 --> 03:14:11,398
You're a woman! And you lie in
the presence of so many men.

1155
03:14:11,739 --> 03:14:13,934
Don't you feel any shame?
- l do!

1156
03:14:17,878 --> 03:14:21,678
l do feel a sense of shame!

1157
03:14:22,916 --> 03:14:29,685
A land where womenfolk are given
the exalted position of Goddesses...

1158
03:14:31,825 --> 03:14:36,353
a land where people
scale mountains...

1159
03:14:36,697 --> 03:14:38,824
singing glories to
the Goddess Mother...

1160
03:14:40,701 --> 03:14:44,762
''a woman, a mother, was
raped and burnt alive.''

1161
03:14:46,407 --> 03:14:48,705
And no one even bothered to enquire.

1162
03:14:51,044 --> 03:14:54,036
Such is the hypocrisy of a nation
in which l was born.

1163
03:14:55,716 --> 03:14:57,911
l'm ashamed of that.

1164
03:14:59,720 --> 03:15:02,382
To see my menfolk remain mute
spectators to atrocities...

1165
03:15:02,723 --> 03:15:04,714
''perpetrated in their presence,...''

1166
03:15:05,726 --> 03:15:09,423
l feel ashamed to acknowledge
their impotency.

1167
03:15:11,732 --> 03:15:15,896
l feel ashamed when l see
womenfolk rendered helpless.

1168
03:15:18,539 --> 03:15:22,669
''This is what women should do.
And this, they mustn't.''

1169
03:15:24,411 --> 03:15:27,676
''This is right for her,
and this is wrong.''

1170
03:15:29,550 --> 03:15:33,350
''To those who shackle the minds
of the womenfolk, l ask...''

1171
03:15:34,688 --> 03:15:39,182
how many more sacrifices do you need?
How many of us will you kill?

1172
03:15:41,695 --> 03:15:44,926
''Even today, in several villages...''

1173
03:15:46,900 --> 03:15:50,495
the female child is killed at birth.

1174
03:15:53,507 --> 03:15:56,374
''Several unmarried girls
kill themselves,...''

1175
03:15:56,710 --> 03:15:59,873
for fear of not taking enough dowry
to their in-laws.

1176
03:16:01,215 --> 03:16:03,945
And yet others are burnt alive
after marriage.

1177
03:16:05,719 --> 03:16:08,517
Even before a girl
can think for herself...

1178
03:16:08,922 --> 03:16:10,787
she is married away...

1179
03:16:11,859 --> 03:16:16,296
as if she were a burden
they want to get rid of.

1180
03:16:17,965 --> 03:16:20,798
A woman who has not borne a child...

1181
03:16:22,402 --> 03:16:25,064
is spurned with the label
of a barren woman.

1182
03:16:26,273 --> 03:16:30,175
ls a woman only a
baby-producing machine then?

1183
03:16:31,845 --> 03:16:34,473
Does she have no personality
of her own?

1184
03:16:35,682 --> 03:16:37,673
Does she have no identity
she can call her own?

1185
03:16:40,687 --> 03:16:45,090
There are people who raise a storm
in the name of culture and religion.

1186
03:16:46,293 --> 03:16:49,228
Why don't they raise a voice
against these evils?

1187
03:16:51,398 --> 03:16:56,028
l have no witnesses
against this man.

1188
03:16:56,703 --> 03:16:57,863
None

1189
03:16:58,705 --> 03:17:03,165
''ln a society where the one who
speaks the truth is declared ''mad''...''

1190
03:17:03,510 --> 03:17:05,842
''and the one who remains silent
is called ''wise''...''

1191
03:17:06,713 --> 03:17:08,442
who will ever speak the truth?

1192
03:17:10,517 --> 03:17:16,012
''l have spoken the truth. And l know,
l will be burnt alive today.''

1193
03:17:16,723 --> 03:17:20,989
And why not?
Because this is the nation...

1194
03:17:22,329 --> 03:17:25,457
''where Sita, who returned safely
from the clutches of Ravana...''

1195
03:17:25,832 --> 03:17:30,166
''was forced to stand a test by fire
by her own husband, Rama!''

1196
03:17:31,672 --> 03:17:36,006
From Sita to Maithili
to Janki to Ramdulaari...

1197
03:17:36,276 --> 03:17:39,803
so many women are being
charred in vicious fires!

1198
03:17:40,414 --> 03:17:42,405
And they will continue
to burn in the future!

1199
03:17:42,883 --> 03:17:45,374
Because we do not feel
a sense of shame anymore!

1200
03:17:46,820 --> 03:17:50,688
Every trace of shame and
humanity is dead for us.

1201
03:17:52,492 --> 03:17:55,427
Proof is this man here!

1202
03:17:55,796 --> 03:17:59,095
He raped a mother.
And he set her on fire!

1203
03:17:59,433 --> 03:18:02,095
And you are today felicitating him
on this high platform!

1204
03:18:03,570 --> 03:18:06,869
Cut the melodrama!
...throw her out!

1205
03:18:07,374 --> 03:18:09,001
Haven't you heard? Get lost!

1206
03:18:38,739 --> 03:18:40,730
''Do not worry, sister.
We are with you.''

1207
03:18:40,874 --> 03:18:43,468
Yes! We are with you.
- So am l.

1208
03:18:43,744 --> 03:18:46,474
''We will stand testimony!
- Yes, sister...''

1209
03:18:46,747 --> 03:18:48,977
l will stand testimony
against my husband.

1210
03:18:50,083 --> 03:18:51,414
Step back... Move!

1211
03:18:51,752 --> 03:18:54,516
''You can't hold me in prison
for even seven hours, lnspector.''

1212
03:18:54,888 --> 03:18:56,879
l have connections
right to the top.

1213
03:19:16,777 --> 03:19:19,712
''l,...''

1214
03:19:22,449 --> 03:19:26,215
could you consider me worthy
of forgiveness?

1215
03:19:36,463 --> 03:19:39,125
l'm fortunate to have you
for my wife.

1216
03:19:47,874 --> 03:19:49,466
''Come, sit in my taxi.''

1217
03:19:51,545 --> 03:19:53,445
Treat it like your own car.
Please get in.

1218
03:19:53,747 --> 03:19:54,736
You...?

1219
03:19:55,749 --> 03:19:58,081
''l told you, l met him at the wedding!
- The biscuit-seller?''

1220
03:19:59,753 --> 03:20:03,018
l've given up all that.
l drive a cab in New York now.

1221
03:20:03,356 --> 03:20:05,153
''This is my husband, Raghu.
- Hello.''

1222
03:20:05,459 --> 03:20:07,154
Daughter or son?
- Daughter.

1223
03:20:07,494 --> 03:20:09,428
What have you named her?
- Ramdulaari.

1224
03:20:09,896 --> 03:20:12,421
Nice name.
- And nice to have met you too.

1225
03:20:12,766 --> 03:20:16,031
Here's a pass for the charity show
l'm doing. Make sure you come.

1226
03:20:16,770 --> 03:20:18,863
''Janki?
- My friend, she's a fabulous dancer.''

1227
03:20:19,206 --> 03:20:21,868
''One pass won't do, madam.
We're two of us.''

1228
03:20:22,209 --> 03:20:25,508
''Have you got married, you mean?
- You think l'd remain a bachelor?''

1229
03:20:26,713 --> 03:20:28,840
Take a look at this.
- Maithili!

1230
03:20:29,716 --> 03:20:32,048
lt's Maithili... look!
He has married her!

1231
03:20:32,285 --> 03:20:35,516
''We'll discuss the rest in the cab,
or they'll give me a ticket. C'mon!''

1232
03:20:37,124 --> 03:20:39,388
We're all here now.
So we can keep meeting.

1233
03:20:39,726 --> 03:20:41,887
l've actually brought Janki here
for a charity show.

1234
03:20:42,062 --> 03:20:44,394
''With the fund we collect,
we will help the organizations...''

1235
03:20:44,531 --> 03:20:46,522
working towards the
upliftment of women.

1236
03:20:46,733 --> 03:20:48,724
Raghu's helping me too.
- l'm not alone.

1237
03:20:48,935 --> 03:20:52,393
All my colleagues and...
- What is most important is that...

1238
03:20:52,739 --> 03:20:55,731
women have begun
to realise at last that...
