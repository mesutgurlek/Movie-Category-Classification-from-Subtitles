# While shadows are creeping #

3
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,700
Got a card?

4
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,601
My name's Bliss.
I'm a friend of Joe's.

5
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:14,002
Said he'd leave word.

6
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,103
Okay.

7
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,604
Be careful.
This is a nervous business.

8
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:24,105
Hello, Bliss.

9
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:26,000
What's with you coming to my joint?

10
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, I heard you were
packing them in, Georgie,

11
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,600
I thought I'd take a night off
from my place,

12
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:31,101
come over and see why.

13
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,800
Well, do I get in or don't I?

14
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,101
Thank you, Georgie.

15
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:43,102
# While shadows #

16
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:45,603
# They are creeping #

17
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:51,500
# In a little cottage cozy #
# the world seems rosy at sundown #

18
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:57,205
# Where a loving smile will greet me #
# and always meet me at sundown. #

19
00:02:57,206 --> 00:03:03,300
# I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven, #

20
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:11,407
# When night is falling #
# and love is calling me home. #

21
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:30,208
# I cried for you #

22
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,800
# Now it's your turn to cry over me. #

23
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:41,400
# Every road has a turning. #

24
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,901
# That's one thing you're learning. #

25
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:51,400
# I cried for you #

26
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:56,001
# What a fool I used to be. #

27
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:02,000
# Now I found two eyes #
# just a little bit bluer #

28
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:07,001
# And I found a heart #
# just a little bit truer, #

29
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:12,000
# I cried for you #

30
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:16,701
# Now it's your turn to cry over me. #

31
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:23,000
# I cried for you #

32
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:27,501
# What a fool I used to be. #

33
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:33,602
# Now I found two eyes #
# just a little bit bluer #

34
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:38,803
# And I found a heart #
# just a little bit truer, #

35
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:44,004
# I cried for you #

36
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:52,305
# Now it's your turn to cry over me. #

37
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:06,006
Hi, Joey.

38
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:07,950
Whew, what a contraption.

39
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:09,151
Austin!

40
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:10,652
Do I see you later?

41
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:12,253
I may be a little crazy...

42
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,700
- ...but I gotta talk business tonight.
- Oh, Joey!

43
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:17,700
- Oh, I know I'm crazy.
- When then?

44
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,500
Tomorrow night.

45
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,200
- I'll see you tomorrow night, okay?
- Oh, sure.

46
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,201
Austin!

47
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:24,900
What's with those tricks
on that last song tonight?

48
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:28,000
You were sure playing fast and loose
with the composer's notes there, Pappy.

49
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,601
And that wild finish.

50
00:05:29,602 --> 00:05:31,402
Oh, what's the use?

51
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:34,000
You know, I wish I had
a camera right now?

52
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,600
Because I could get the perfect picture

53
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,500
of a guy with his two feet
in his mouth.

54
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:40,350
I was just so bad tonight

55
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,540
that next week
I open at the Valencia.

56
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,700
Oh, the Valencia.

57
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:46,200
Yeah, that classy joint
where they carry the drunks out,

58
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:48,250
- ...they don't toss them out in the street.
- I thought you didn't drink,

59
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,750
I see the teapot's finally got you.

60
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,051
Mr. Mack, listen to me very carefully.

61
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,900
There was a man in the audience tonight
by the name of Bliss.

62
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,201
Mr. Bliss is from the Club Valencia.

63
00:05:58,202 --> 00:06:00,999
And during my performance,
he gave me a signal like this.

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Which meant,
'Joe, next week you open in our club.'

65
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:08,950
And because you're so great,
you can take along your piano player,

66
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,700
providing he promises not to spit
on the floor during the show.

67
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:12,900
- You're kidding!
- No, that's part of the deal,

68
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:15,200
- You can't spit on the floor...
- Cut it out, cut it out.

69
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,801
- Was Bliss really here?
- Hm-hmm.

70
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:18,700
And we really got a deal?

71
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,401
Oh, no!

72
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:22,200
From now on we work
to great audiences

73
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:24,300
not like these reunion clubs
from Leavenworth.

74
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,550
We're gonna be in the company
of Sophie Tucker, Eddie Cantor, Al Jolson,

75
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,202
they all work there,
you know one time or another...

76
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,200
And me, I'm really set to go with you?

77
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:34,250
Oh, you're such a lunkhead.
You think I'd go without you?

78
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,700
- Oh, Joe, that's...
- Mr. Joe!

79
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:37,400
Georgie wants to see you right away.

80
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:41,700
Sure, why not?
I'm good company.

81
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,701
You know, Georgie might not like
you leaving h...

82
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,802
What do I mean, 'might not like it'?

83
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:47,203
He's gonna hate it.

84
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,604
You know your trouble, Mr. Chopin?

85
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:51,800
You spent too much time
in a conservatory.

86
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,800
- You're a little stir crazy.
- Hey, Joe.

87
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:56,401
Take it easy, huh?

88
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:59,800
You know me, pal.
Waltz time all the time.

89
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,801
Hi, Georgie.

90
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:06,502
Tim, how you been?

91
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:12,803
Looks like everybody
paid their tab, huh?

92
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:15,804
I saw you passing signals
with this guy Bliss.

93
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,405
If you're figuring on going
to work for him, forget it.

94
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:23,146
Well, to tell you the truth,
Georgie, I...

95
00:07:23,147 --> 00:07:24,347
Hey, Joe...

96
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:26,748
Tell us the truth.

97
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:29,949
You're not going nowhere,
not till I fire you, get it?

98
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,850
But the engagement is up Saturday night.

99
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:35,200
I'll tell you
when the engagement is up here.

100
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:45,100
The last time I checked,
I was still an American citizen.

101
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:47,701
What's that got to do with it?

102
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:49,902
Well, it means I got a right
to work anywhere I want to.

103
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:55,300
What you got a right is to be buried
anywhere you want to.

104
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:58,204
You don't mean that, Georgie.

105
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:00,115
He means it.

106
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,606
I'm sorry you take it so personal.

107
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,607
Sorry?

108
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:09,308
Anybody quits me to work for Bliss,
this I take personal.

109
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:10,509
Now beat it.

110
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,510
Aw, you gotta be kidding, George.

111
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:17,311
This is my big break.
You don't wanna hold me back.

112
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,512
You can get hundreds singers.

113
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:23,013
Come on, wish me luck.

114
00:08:25,614 --> 00:08:28,000
Nobody ever walks out on me.

115
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,501
I can work anyplace I want to.

116
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:46,802
Oh, what happened?

117
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:48,999
- Oh, Georgie?
- Hm-hmm.

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,500
Oh, nothing much.

119
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:53,001
You know how he is.
He's a little sorry to see us go.

120
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:55,902
Cried a little bit.
Got me right there.

121
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:56,903
Sure.

122
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:00,000
You know that under that icy exterior
there's really a warm guy.

123
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,404
I'll bet he does a lot of church work.

124
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:07,405
Joe.

125
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:13,206
You got a twin brother
or something, Coogan?

126
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,107
I could have sworn
I just left you inside.

127
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,200
I uh...

128
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:19,999
didn't want to make a scene in front
of the young lady just now, but...

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,200
I got to thinking maybe Georgie and me
didn't make our point.

130
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:27,301
You made your point several times.

131
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:28,502
Come on, Austin.

132
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,603
Piano player,

133
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,850
your friend hasn't been
in town very long,

134
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:35,600
he doesn't know how things are.

135
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,201
If you're really a friend,
explain it to him.

136
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:40,502
What I mean is...

137
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,803
he won't live to open at the Valencia.

138
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:50,600
You want to get something
to eat right away

139
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:51,701
or do you want to go to the hotel?

140
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:53,402
I want to go
and have your head examined.

141
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:54,900
Do you know what Coogan said?

142
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,501
- Will you listen to me!
- I'm listening.

143
00:09:57,502 --> 00:10:00,802
You're not back in high school now
singing soprano in Pinafore.

144
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:03,400
It was The Mikado.
And I was very big in it, too.

145
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:05,201
Keep it up.

146
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:08,602
Keep it up. you'll be the funniest
stiff in the morgue.

147
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:11,803
Mr. Mack, you read
too many newspapers,

148
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:13,804
you believe too much
in what you read.

149
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:16,405
Look, the joint is doing good
and they didn't want me to leave.

150
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:18,806
They're not gonna kill me
for a lousy couple of bucks.

151
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:21,707
Joe, these guys kill people
just to keep in practice.

152
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:23,808
Joe, I know them.

153
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:25,709
They like to kill people.

154
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's go get some Chinese food.

155
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,000
- No, we're going to the police.
- Oh, fine...

156
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:32,801
so that Bliss thinks
that when he hires us

157
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,600
he's gonna get mixed up
in a gang war?

158
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,350
Coogan didn't say
he was gonna kill Bliss.

159
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,151
Yours was the name he mentioned.

160
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:44,252
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- Oh, don't tell me.

161
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:45,853
We won't go to a Chinese restaurant.

162
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,154
You'd be looking under the table
for a Tong war.

163
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:49,855
We'll go to a Mexican place.

164
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:53,700
Oh, you're probably one of those guys
who still thinks that Pancho Villa'a alive.

165
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,101
You know what I think?

166
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,202
I think you're as good as dead.

167
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:01,303
Well then stop lousing up
my last few moments.

168
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:02,304
Joe!

169
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,105
I'm not going to open
at the Valencia with you.

170
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:11,800
Are you quitting on me?

171
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,200
That's right.

172
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:15,900
Maybe I can't stop you
from getting killed but...

173
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,701
I'm not gonna play the accompaniment.

174
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:20,500
Now, look, I know
you're trying to be a pal,

175
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:22,901
but if you don't go in there
with me, I'll go it alone.

176
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:25,800
If you open at the Valencia,
we split up for good.

177
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:31,250
Austin, I can see us busting up
over a broad, but not Tim Coogan.

178
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,602
Use your head!

179
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:34,503
Tell Coogan you're staying.

180
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:40,604
You're asking me to do
the one thing I can't do.

181
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:46,505
All right, you'll just have
to get yourself another piano player.

182
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,106
Good luck, kid.

183
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:26,700
You know it's real weird,
you without Austin.

184
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,501
Just like walking around on one leg.

185
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:31,700
How about this, Swifty,
pretty jazzy?

186
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:34,300
Yeah, it's jazzy and razzamatazzy.

187
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:37,202
With a suit like that
I could pick up girls like lead.

188
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:38,400
That's the first thing.

189
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:41,500
But without the proper accessories
you're just like an unfinished painting.

190
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:44,701
Now... I have some pinky rings here

191
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:46,302
Elegant, soigné...

192
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:48,800
You sold me this ring, remember?

193
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,201
Want me to grow another pinky?

194
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,502
I know you'd do it for me
if you could, Joe.

195
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:54,200
But uh... how about some watches?

196
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:57,500
I have a fine display here,
never seen in Chicago until...

197
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:01,201
Stick pins?

198
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:02,999
Tie clips?

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,700
Well, I got some elegant frippery,
finery and haberdashery.

200
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,600
Frippery, finery and haber...
all right, Swifty.

201
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,401
What's it gonna cost me this time?

202
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,700
Well uh...
twenty would dry my tears, Joe.

203
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:17,300
Wipe your eyes.

204
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:19,201
Come in, come in.

205
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:22,000
For you, Joe...

206
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:36,101
Maybe it's from Austin, you know...

207
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:38,202
a joke.

208
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,903
Remind me to send
a thank you note to Coogan.

209
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm getting worried, Joe.
Maybe you oughta blow this joint.

210
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:49,701
- Look, with Austin leaving you and...
- Austin, Austin.

211
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:51,800
It's just temperament,
that's all it is, Swifty.

212
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,000
I bet you the same twenty
he's waiting outside that door

213
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,400
and when I walk out he'll say,
'Do you know your lyrics?'

214
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,500
Just in case,
I got something for you.

215
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,000
Here, will you carry this?

216
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,900
Get that thing out of here!

217
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:05,000
What do I know from guns?
I'd shoot my toe off.

218
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:06,700
How do I look?

219
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:12,701
A little pale,
no roses in the cheeks.

220
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:16,000
Please, I'm not in the morgue yet.
Bite your tongue.

221
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:20,200
Get rid of this thing.
Throw it out the window.

222
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,900
- You know your lyrics?
- Hm-hmm.

223
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:36,802
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
I am.

224
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:39,603
Still scared?

225
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:41,200
Listen, you pea-brain,

226
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:44,101
I'm so scared I'll have to tie my hands
to the piano so's I can play.

227
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:45,550
I knew you'd be here.

228
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,000
Sure, how can I pass up
all that money I make off of you?

229
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,552
Welcome here, Joe.

230
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:54,600
When the machine-gun fire starts,
I'll meet you under the piano.

231
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:07,700
# If I could be with you #
# I'd love you strong #

232
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:11,201
# If I could be with you #
# I'd love you long #

233
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,102
# I want you to know #

234
00:15:13,103 --> 00:15:14,903
# That I wouldn't go #

235
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:18,404
# Until I told you, honey, #
# why I love you so #

236
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:21,800
# If I could be with you #
# one hour tonight #

237
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:25,501
# If I were free to do #
# the things I might #

238
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:27,400
# I'm telling you true... #

239
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:28,902
Hello, Coogan.

240
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:30,900
Well, Captain McCarthy.

241
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,900
Want to play cops and robbers tonight?

242
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,500
Or do you wanna have fun?

243
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,900
Hm... let's play cops and robbers.

244
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:41,001
Go ahead, don't be bashful.

245
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:43,400
# ...that I wouldn't go #

246
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,800
# Until I told you, honey #
# why I love you so #

247
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:50,201
# If I could be with you #
# one hour tonight #

248
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:52,100
# If I were free to do #

249
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:54,501
There's nothing in her garters
but her legs.

250
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:56,202
Why don't you take my word for it?

251
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:58,203
Oh, I'll take your word for it.

252
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:00,999
Bliss... at my table?

253
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,700
Right  this way, Mr. Coogan.

254
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,900
No, no, not in the middle
of Joe's number.

255
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,900
It's not nice.

256
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,700
# I want you to know #
# That I wouldn't go #

257
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:15,100
# Until I told you, honey #
# why I love you so #

258
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:18,601
# If I could be with you #
# one hour tonight #

259
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:22,250
# If I were free to do #
# the things I might #

260
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:26,151
# I'm tellin' you true #
# I'd be anything but blue #

261
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,352
# If I could be with you #
# for just an hour #

262
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:37,353
# If I could be with you. #

263
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:39,800
I'll show you to your table.

264
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:59,101
Please, Mr. Mack, no knuckles.

265
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:05,700
# When somebody loves you #

266
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:09,600
# it's no good unless he loves you #

267
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:14,801
# All the way #

268
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,902
# Happy to be near you #

269
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:22,103
# When you need someone to cheer you #

270
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,004
# All the way #

271
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:33,905
# Taller than the tallest tree is #

272
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:38,700
# That's how it's got to feel #

273
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:45,901
# Deeper than the deep blue sea is #

274
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:48,602
# That's how deep it goes #

275
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:51,200
# If it's real #

276
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:54,781
# When somebody needs you #

277
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,882
# It's no good unless he needs you #

278
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:04,283
# All the way #

279
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,004
# Through the good or lean years #

280
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:11,205
# and for all the in-between years #

281
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:16,906
# Come what may #

282
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:23,207
# Who knows where the road will lead us #

283
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:27,508
# Only a fool would say #

284
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:31,209
# But if you let me love you #

285
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,210
# It's for sure I'm gonna love you #

286
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:39,911
# All the way #

287
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:49,412
# All the way. #

288
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:07,913
Very good, Joe.

289
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:13,514
Thanks.

290
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:15,850
Well, Joe, you gave yourself
quite a thrill

291
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,300
and you've made your point.

292
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:18,701
You opened.

293
00:19:19,502 --> 00:19:21,602
Now you'd better
come back with us.

294
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,800
I'm sorry, but I'm staying here.

295
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:26,101
- Sure?
- Sure.

296
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:30,302
You forgot to thank me
for the flowers.

297
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,403
Oh... thanks.

298
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:35,804
Okay... citizen.

299
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:47,705
Joe, now will you be serious?
Tell me the truth.

300
00:19:47,706 --> 00:19:50,706
Coogan doesn't come to see
anybody just for auld land syne.

301
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:52,500
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

302
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:54,450
He told me I was strictly
from hunger tonight

303
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:56,251
and he's glad I left the other joint.

304
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:57,800
And by the way...

305
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,601
he didn't think
you were so hot either.

306
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:01,202
Joe... say, Joe...

307
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:03,203
A card for you.

308
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,004
What did he say?

309
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,050
I would appreciate it
if you would be good enough

310
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:09,300
to call me at my office
tomorrow morning.

311
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,301
Is that from Coogan?

312
00:20:10,302 --> 00:20:13,300
Frank Marshall, president
of the Blue Label record company.

313
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:14,999
There you are, Mr. Mack,

314
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,800
if you have to worry about something,

315
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:19,701
worry about what songs
we record for Mr. Marshall.

316
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,202
Yeah, you know, record...

317
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:25,203
those little black things
that go round and round...

318
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:26,904
Ehhh...

319
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,050
You know it's pretty frightening
to hear yourself

320
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:41,401
as other people can hear you?

321
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:44,200
Sounds like a mating call
of a moose with a tin ear.

322
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,101
Three minutes ago that was
the greatest record ever made.

323
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:49,999
Now I know why Coogan
wanted me killed.

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
This boy's got public spirit.

325
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:55,101
Please don't mention it.
Let sleeping dogs lie.

326
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:57,902
Weeks passed and we haven't
heard from him. Say nothing.

327
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:02,703
I'll meet you at the music publisher's
at three, huh?

328
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:03,704
Hm-hmm.

329
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:06,105
Enjoy yourself.

330
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,006
What else?

331
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,707
- Who's there?
- Captain McCarthy.

332
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,308
Hey, what the...

333
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:09,200
Number, please.

334
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,101
Hello?
Hello.

335
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:14,402
Mr. Lewis?

336
00:22:14,603 --> 00:22:16,003
Hello.

337
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:17,004
Hello.

338
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:25,605
For Joe Lewis.

339
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,506
Look at that.

340
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,300
Coogan's laughing in our faces.
Yours.

341
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:34,201
Yeah, and there not a thing
I can do about it.

342
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:35,802
He had a perfect alibi.

343
00:23:35,803 --> 00:23:38,650
- I couldn't hold him for 15 minutes.
- I don't care about his alibi.

344
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,351
He told me he was gonna get Joe.

345
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, maybe Joe can identify him.

346
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,801
What did the doctor say?

347
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:46,300
When can I talk to Joe?

348
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,601
A month, maybe a year, I...

349
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:49,900
How bad is it?

350
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:53,801
They slashed his vocal cords,
they bashed in his skull.

351
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:56,800
He was in surgery for six hours.

352
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:00,901
I'd like to bash in that Coogan skull
with a baseball bat.

353
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:03,002
There's a long line ahead of you.

354
00:24:03,003 --> 00:24:06,203
Be sure and let me know
when I can talk to Joe.

355
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:14,104
Why don't you go home and get
some rest, Austin? I'll stick around.

356
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:15,900
No, I want to be here
when he wakes up.

357
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:18,800
You go on,
I can take care of things.

358
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:20,801
I'll be back later.

359
00:25:09,202 --> 00:25:10,600
Au...

360
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:19,201
Au...

361
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:24,202
Hey...

362
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,403
Au...

363
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:58,204
Hey...

364
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,905
I...

365
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:13,606
- Ow!
- Joe... Joe!

366
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,507
Joe, get back in bed.

367
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,508
Joe!

368
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,309
Joe, don't!

369
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,000
You're gonna hurt yourself, Joe...

370
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:23,401
Joe, Joe, don't!

371
00:26:23,402 --> 00:26:26,002
Don't... stop it, stop it...

372
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:27,803
Help me!

373
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:30,704
Somebody, in here!
Help me!

374
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:36,740
I was working for this jerk
for two months

375
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:37,891
and he doesn't even pay me.

376
00:26:37,892 --> 00:26:40,050
On top of that
he called me a dumb broad.

377
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:42,900
All right, keep it down, please,
keep it down, huh?

378
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,300
Now, he'll be here any minute.

379
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:46,140
Remember, he's not supposed to talk yet.

380
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:48,040
The doctor wants him to take it real easy

381
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,999
and don't stare at his scars.

382
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,700
For he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good...

383
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:55,500
- Where's Joe?
- I don't know.

384
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:58,301
Nobody knows. He walked
out of the hospital early this morning...

385
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:00,999
He just disappeared.

386
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,900
He left this note.

387
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,401
So long, Austin, thanks for everything.

388
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:10,202
Find yourself another singer.
Good luck... Joe.

389
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:13,000
What a crazy thing to do.

390
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:14,601
Why should he run away?

391
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:16,500
How's he gonna live?
He can't sing.

392
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,950
Why, he can hardly talk.

393
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:20,800
What will he do?
All he knows is show business.

394
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,700
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

395
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:24,500
- But I gotta find him.
- I'll go with you.

396
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:25,601
Austin.

397
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,402
Do you think he'll ever
get his voice back?

398
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,050
Will he ever be able to sing again?

399
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:31,600
There's more to him than a voice.
He's a human being.

400
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:33,901
He's a man. I gotta help him.

401
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:37,500
- I gotta find him.
- Poor Joe. How awful he must feel.

402
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,601
How would I feel if they chopped off
all of my fingers?

403
00:27:58,702 --> 00:27:59,702
Come in.

404
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:04,303
- Captain McCarthy, the papers...
- Relax, Austin.

405
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:06,404
We know who did it
and it wasn't Joe.

406
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,505
Have you heard anything?

407
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:20,506
Well, I got word that someone saw him
getting on a train for New York.

408
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:22,907
I'll let you know if I get any real lead.

409
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,208
See you, Boys.

410
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:30,209
You know, I really hate
that crummy joint I'm playing at now.

411
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,110
I'm going to New York.

412
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,500
They got plenty of pianos there.

413
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:36,501
That's some haystack, New York.

414
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:38,000
Seven million people.

415
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:41,101
Let's go look for the needle.

416
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:27,450
Joe! Joe!

417
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:28,451
Joe!

418
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:31,452
Joe!

419
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,753
Joe! I can't believe it,
after all these years.

420
00:29:41,554 --> 00:29:45,554
It's me, Swif...
Swifty Morgan, don't you know me?

421
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:48,455
Sure I know you,
are you kidding or something?

422
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,600
How's business?

423
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,301
How's business? That's all you can say
after a hundred years?

424
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:52,802
We looked all over for...

425
00:29:52,803 --> 00:29:55,403
The voice,
Can you still sing, Joe?

426
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:58,104
Never stopped.
What do you want to hear. Stardust?

427
00:29:58,105 --> 00:29:59,505
Stars and Stripes Forever?

428
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,000
A Wand'ring Minstrel I?

429
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:03,401
I want to hear you with Austin,
that's what I want to hear.

430
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,402
Hey, let's hop a cab
and surprise him, huh?

431
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:09,700
He's here in New York now?

432
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:13,101
Sure, we'd be there in 20 minutes.
You know, he's doing pretty good.

433
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,802
He's playing piano for Sophie Tucker.

434
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:18,403
Boy, when you walk in
he's gonna keel right over.

435
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:21,804
Yeah, we could surprise him...

436
00:30:21,805 --> 00:30:23,800
I'll tell you what,
where are you staying, Swifty?

437
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:24,801
The Clinton.

438
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:27,402
Well, I gotta run along
and do a couple of things,

439
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:28,803
so I'll give you a call.

440
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:30,104
Wait a minute.

441
00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:33,600
What's with the brush off,
what did I do?

442
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:37,401
What brush off, Swifty?
I told you, I got an appointment.

443
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,102
With a booking agent.

444
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,400
So I'll call you back.

445
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:44,500
What can I tell Austin?
I can't just tell him I saw you.

446
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:47,000
At least where are you staying,
where are you working?

447
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:49,340
I'm right in the middle
of things now, Swifty.

448
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:51,201
But as soon as I get a new address,
I'll call you, huh?

449
00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:53,702
And tell Mr. Steinway
I said everything's fine.

450
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:54,903
Just fine.

451
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,600
Come on, Bozo, this is the place
I told you about.

452
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,900
Don't worry about a thing,
play that real good and loud...

453
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:07,400
we'll make plenty of money,
people'll be along and give it to us.

454
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:10,700
A drink?
You want a drink.

455
00:32:10,701 --> 00:32:12,301
Oh, later.

456
00:32:12,602 --> 00:32:14,102
Let's tune it up.

457
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:18,603
Is his voice really okay?

458
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,704
I told you, he even wanted
to sing for me.

459
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:39,105
The shamus is here.

460
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:41,000
All right, boys, knock it off.

461
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,701
It happens to be a quiet zone.

462
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,700
There's a hospital right down the street.

463
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,900
No more noise, you understand?
And you...

464
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:49,300
you're the worst offender.
Don't play!

465
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,201
Don't you play.

466
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:53,102
Who's gonna stop me?

467
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:55,050
Who's gonna stop it?
I'm gonna stop it...

468
00:32:55,051 --> 00:32:58,400
I said don't play around here
and I mean don't play.

469
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:00,501
Like to see you do that again.

470
00:33:00,502 --> 00:33:02,900
So, you'd like to see me do it again.

471
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:04,341
Well. I'm doing it again.

472
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:06,651
Now, don't p-l-a-y play.

473
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:11,600
- Come on, let's go.
- You wanna go backstage?

474
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:13,101
Oh, no, no...

475
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:16,702
He wouldn't want to see me now,
not like that.

476
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm gonna talk to Sophie about him.

477
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,601
Come on, let's get out of here.

478
00:33:48,202 --> 00:33:49,902
I'd like to see you do it again.

479
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:53,903
So, you'd like to see me do it again.
Well, I'm doing it again.

480
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:56,104
Don't p-l-a-y play.

481
00:34:08,305 --> 00:34:10,105
Go ahead and play.

482
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:19,306
All right, Austin.
I'll take care of it.

483
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:21,707
Get back to the piano.

484
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:26,008
Young man, I do believe there's
something wrong with your hearing.

485
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:29,400
I told you not to play
and I mean don't play.

486
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,101
Raspberry blue coat,
can't catch your nanny.

487
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:33,702
This time you're really going
down to the station.

488
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:35,850
Wait a minute...
Oh, you want a drink, Bozo?

489
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:38,400
Why, sure, Bozo,
here you are.

490
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:51,200
- Hey, sonny.
- Yes, Miss Tucker.

491
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:52,501
- Come with me.
- Where to?

492
00:34:52,502 --> 00:34:54,999
Don't ask any questions.
Come with me.

493
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

494
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:07,000
a few years ago, a young singer

495
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:10,501
refused to let a bunch
of gangsters tell him

496
00:35:10,502 --> 00:35:13,400
where he could perform
and where he couldn't.

497
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:17,000
That courage cost him a great deal.

498
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:20,601
He was badly beaten,
he was almost killed.

499
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:26,202
But to this day, no one can tell him
where he can perform

500
00:35:26,203 --> 00:35:27,703
and where he can't.

501
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:29,704
Excepting me, of course.

502
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,105
Ladies and gentlemen,

503
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:35,600
here he is,
hiding behind his fright wig.

504
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,999
Joe E. Lewis.

505
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,000
What would you like him
to sing now?

506
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:44,701
Just One More Chance.

507
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:46,302
Falling in Love Again.

508
00:35:46,303 --> 00:35:47,903
Beyond the Blue Horizon.

509
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:50,204
How about All The Way?
All The Way.

510
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:53,305
All The Way.

511
00:35:53,306 --> 00:35:56,206
Go to it, boy.
All The Way.

512
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,700
# When somebody loves you #

513
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:32,000
# It's no good unless he loves you #

514
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:35,000
# All... #

515
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,401
Maybe those guys in Chicago
weren't gangsters, after all.

516
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,402
Maybe they were music critics.

517
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:55,103
Might as well give it up, Austin.
I can't even talk in that key.

518
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:02,904
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd be happy
to finish the song, but...

519
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:06,500
it might be one of your favorites
and I'd like to leave it that way.

520
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:09,601
But nothing's been lost because...

521
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:14,702
after all, tonight you've heard
Al Jolson, George Jessel,

522
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:16,303
Sophie Tucker...

523
00:37:16,304 --> 00:37:19,804
three of the greatest baritones
in the business.

524
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:24,999
You know, this is the first time
I've tried to sing in...

525
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,400
in many years.

526
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:29,700
As a matter of fact, since that
little set to in Chicago.

527
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:33,601
Yeah, they didn't fool around
in those days.

528
00:37:33,602 --> 00:37:36,302
It was, well, a different kind
of show business.

529
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:40,200
if they didn't like you,
they didn't throw you out of the show,

530
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:42,601
they threw you out of a speeding car.

531
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:52,500
But that's all behind me now, it's past,
it's all in the past...

532
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm doing pretty good these days,
with Mr. Zig's Playhouse...

533
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:58,901
and this week we're doing Shakespeare.

534
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:01,200
It's one of the great classics.

535
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:04,201
It's called, 'This Must Be The Place.'

536
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:09,602
And the costumes, you should see
the costumes in the show.

537
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:13,203
The leading lady comes out
on the stage with a gown and...

538
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:15,000
I wish you could see this gown...

539
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,901
It's backless, it's frontless and it's...

540
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:19,302
strapless.

541
00:38:19,303 --> 00:38:21,703
Come to think of it, it's a belt.

542
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:25,800
If I knew where the bar was,
I'd go get one.

543
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:33,701
But before I go, ladies and gentlemen,

544
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:35,700
I'd like to pay a tribute...

545
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:37,701
to an old friend...

546
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:39,302
Mr. Austin Mack.

547
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:47,403
Mack plays a great piano.

548
00:38:47,404 --> 00:38:49,604
I think it's a Steinway.

549
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,005
By the way, ladies and gentlemen,

550
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:55,706
I came out here in kind of in a hurry

551
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:58,007
and I didn't have time
to dress properly

552
00:38:58,008 --> 00:39:02,908
so, I'd like to thank Miss Tucker
for lending me a pair of her slacks.

553
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:11,650
Most of all, I want to thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

554
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:15,451
for being so kind and so understanding.

555
00:39:16,352 --> 00:39:18,252
Thank you, and good night.

556
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,553
Good to see you, Joe.

557
00:39:40,554 --> 00:39:41,554
Real good.

558
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:44,855
Been a long time, huh?

559
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:47,156
Done a lot of clickers
over that keyboard.

560
00:39:48,057 --> 00:39:50,257
I'll tell you one thing, though.
You've still got it.

561
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:52,558
The way you wrapped up
that audience out there,

562
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:53,900
you had them laughing...

563
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:54,901
Why not?

564
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:56,502
A guy trying to sing with his throat cut,

565
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:57,900
that's always good for a big laugh.

566
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:00,001
Forget about the singing, Joe.
I'm talking about the jokes.

567
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,402
You were terrific.

568
00:40:01,403 --> 00:40:03,503
You know, I think this could be
a real break for you.

569
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:06,200
I got a break. Just had an offer
out there, thanks to you.

570
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:07,800
You have?
What, doing what?

571
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:10,401
Oh, some big musical show.

572
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:12,300
I walk out in the middle
of the stage...

573
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:13,740
they surround me with
forty or fifty people

574
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:15,541
but the trick is
I never make a sound.

575
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:17,342
You see, I'm billed as the silent singer.

576
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,450
If you want to be sore, be sore

577
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,950
but don't forget you're the one
that told Swifty you could still sing.

578
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:23,451
All right, so I was lying.

579
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:25,252
Joe, I heard you out there

580
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:27,000
and I'm telling you, I know
what you need, a couple of good...

581
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:28,701
I got what I need, Austin.

582
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:32,102
Let me run my own life, will you?

583
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:33,203
And do me another favor.

584
00:40:33,204 --> 00:40:36,104
If I ever bust a leg, don't book me
in the dance act, okay?

585
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:38,905
Now... I got things to do.

586
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:41,200
- Why can't you get along...
- Austin.

587
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:42,700
Leave him alone.

588
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:44,201
- Wait a minute.
- For what?

589
00:40:44,202 --> 00:40:45,702
How many years
have you been looking for him?

590
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:46,803
Worrying about him?

591
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:49,100
All I ever hear from you is,
'I wonder what Joe's doing'.

592
00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:50,601
'I wonder what's gonna become of Joe.'

593
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:52,202
Joe, Joe, Joe.

594
00:40:52,203 --> 00:40:53,803
Now what do you get for it?

595
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:56,800
'Let me run my own life.'

596
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:58,501
Who's the talky dame?

597
00:40:58,502 --> 00:41:01,200
This is Cassie, my wife.

598
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:05,901
The party's about to begin.
They want you to start the music.

599
00:41:05,902 --> 00:41:07,202
I'm coming.

600
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,003
Listen, Joe...

601
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:21,700
We're in the telephone book.

602
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:02,201
Mr. Lewis.

603
00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:05,502
I'm Johnny Allen of the William Morris
Booking Agency.

604
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:06,903
I'm a friend of Austin's.

605
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:08,750
I wish you'd drop around
to my office sometime,

606
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:10,600
- Maybe we could do something for you.
- Sure.

607
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:12,201
Here's my card.

608
00:42:12,502 --> 00:42:14,702
Call my secretary, will you?

609
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:15,803
Anytime.

610
00:42:24,104 --> 00:42:32,004
# It's June in January #

611
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:35,805
# Because I'm in love #

612
00:42:37,506 --> 00:42:42,306
# Yet there's always spring in my heart #

613
00:42:42,307 --> 00:42:45,507
# With you in my arms. #

614
00:42:47,008 --> 00:42:53,308
# The snow is just white blossoms #

615
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:57,600
$ That fall from above. #

616
00:42:57,601 --> 00:42:59,101
Hello.

617
00:43:01,002 --> 00:43:02,102
Hi.

618
00:43:04,003 --> 00:43:05,700
Do you mind if I join you?

619
00:43:07,801 --> 00:43:09,000
Help yourself.

620
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:11,700
Of course, if I'm intruding, I...

621
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:14,201
Free country.

622
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm afraid I am intruding,
excuse me.

623
00:43:17,801 --> 00:43:19,600
Wait a minute, don't go,
I'm sorry.

624
00:43:20,101 --> 00:43:23,101
I've been bouncing around
like a foul ball all night long.

625
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:28,200
It's all right.
I have days like that myself.

626
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,600
Only on you it doesn't show.

627
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,901
You're Joe Lewis, aren't you?

628
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:36,700
Hm-hmm, that's the way it is.

629
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:42,201
What are you doing
back here, hiding?

630
00:43:42,802 --> 00:43:45,602
Hiding.
Stolen goods.

631
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:48,103
And a hot pair of baggy pants.

632
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:57,904
# It's June in January #

633
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:01,505
He's wonderful, isn't he?

634
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:04,999
Yeah.

635
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,500
Everyone thought
you were very good, too.

636
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:12,301
Oh, when it comes to the seltzer
and the kisser bit, I'm very big.

637
00:44:12,302 --> 00:44:15,150
No, I meant later,
when you were on by yourself.

638
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:16,951
The audience thought
you were wonderful.

639
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:20,200
There's an unwritten law
that says it's not nice to

640
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:22,000
throw rocks at a benefit.

641
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:25,300
Well, nice to see you.

642
00:44:25,301 --> 00:44:27,300
Don't go.
The party's just beginning.

643
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:28,901
There'll be dance music.

644
00:44:28,902 --> 00:44:29,902
See?

645
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,203
You know what this reminds me of.

646
00:44:43,104 --> 00:44:45,700
- Have you ever been to India?
- No.

647
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:47,450
Well, in some of the
movie houses there, they...

648
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:51,051
the screen is in the middle
of the theater to divide the audience.

649
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:53,300
The untouchables sit on one side

650
00:44:53,301 --> 00:44:55,000
and on the other sit the...

651
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:57,201
Touchables?

652
00:44:57,802 --> 00:45:00,202
Yes, I guess you could
call them that.

653
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:06,103
Gee, he plays a great piano.

654
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:07,700
A Steinway, I think.

655
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,200
What's that curtain called?

656
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:15,000
You're not in show business?

657
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:17,600
No, I just did a little work
for the benefit committee.

658
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:26,500
It's called a cyclorama.

659
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:27,501
Cyc.

660
00:45:28,802 --> 00:45:30,902
Do you always hide behind cycs?

661
00:45:31,703 --> 00:45:35,003
Well, I was really
on my way out, but...

662
00:45:35,004 --> 00:45:36,704
I didn't want to fight that crowd.

663
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:40,405
Looks like a pleasant pastime,
doesn't it?

664
00:45:40,406 --> 00:45:42,206
It's called dancing.

665
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,307
Really nothing much.

666
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,108
You just kinda walk around
with a girl in your arms.

667
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:51,200
The way you put it,
it sounds pretty good.

668
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:54,999
They seem to be having a lot of fun.

669
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,450
You sure you don't want
to join them?

670
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,200
I've been waiting for you
to ask me.

671
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:07,601
You know...

672
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:11,102
even in India they're giving up
the idea of untouchables.

673
00:46:20,503 --> 00:46:21,803
What's your name?

674
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:23,304
Letty Page.

675
00:46:24,405 --> 00:46:26,800
I've never been in back
of one of these before.

676
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:29,301
It's rather beautiful and strange.

677
00:46:30,702 --> 00:46:33,200
That's because we're the only
real people here.

678
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:35,401
The rest of them, they're only shadows.

679
00:46:39,002 --> 00:46:40,802
So then, the second banana says...

680
00:46:40,803 --> 00:46:42,500
What am I running for?

681
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:45,201
I'm running to stop the fight
between the big fellow and me.

682
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,700
That's what the second banana said.

683
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:49,001
But... what's a second banana?

684
00:46:49,002 --> 00:46:50,202
The second banana is the fellow

685
00:46:50,203 --> 00:46:52,103
who sets up the jokes
for the first banana.

686
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:53,750
- He's the top comic.
- I see.

687
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:55,105
There's really nothing to it.

688
00:46:55,106 --> 00:46:57,400
I could make you a second banana
just like that.

689
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:59,000
- You could?
- Sure.

690
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:02,501
Whatever I say to you,
you say 'that's good' and 'that's bad',

691
00:47:02,502 --> 00:47:03,502
That's good and that's bad.

692
00:47:03,503 --> 00:47:06,603
For instance, I say, I'm married now
and you say, that's good.

693
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,104
Okay, now we start.

694
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:10,905
- I'm married now.
- That's good.

695
00:47:10,906 --> 00:47:12,706
That's bad, my wife nags me.

696
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:13,707
That's bad.

697
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:15,108
Not so bad.
She's got a lot of money.

698
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:16,109
That's good.

699
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,710
Not so good.
She never gives me any.

700
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:18,711
That's bad.

701
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:20,812
- Not so bad. She's got a big house.
- That's good.

702
00:47:20,813 --> 00:47:23,213
- Not so good. It burned down.
- Oh, that's bad.

703
00:47:23,214 --> 00:47:24,700
Not so bad, she was in it.

704
00:47:28,301 --> 00:47:30,401
Anything else you want to know
about burlesque?

705
00:47:32,202 --> 00:47:34,900
Oh well, for one thing...

706
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:36,800
You don't seem very happy in it.

707
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:38,601
Why did you get into it
n the first place?

708
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:40,900
When they cut my throat, I had to eat.

709
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:42,901
So, I went into burlesque.

710
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,802
I got pie on my face five times a day

711
00:47:44,803 --> 00:47:46,903
and the service was
fast and furious.

712
00:47:48,304 --> 00:47:51,204
I... I don't know why I'm laughing.

713
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:53,605
It must have been awful
being cut up like that.

714
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,506
Well, let's put it this way,

715
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:57,807
one time is enough.

716
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:58,908
Yeah.

717
00:48:00,509 --> 00:48:03,400
You know, I've had
the most wonderful evening.

718
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:12,601
Mmmm, that's good.

719
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:16,302
Not so good. The cab has stopped.

720
00:48:16,303 --> 00:48:18,003
I think the driver knows
where you live.

721
00:48:18,004 --> 00:48:20,904
- Oh, that is bad.
- Not so bad.

722
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:24,505
Say uh, pal, how much does it cost
to drive to Fairbanks, Alaska?

723
00:48:24,506 --> 00:48:26,000
That's a buck and a half
you owe me.

724
00:48:26,001 --> 00:48:28,501
There's a straight man
for you all the time.

725
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:40,102
What are you doing
living in a public library?

726
00:48:40,103 --> 00:48:42,903
It's more convenient
than belonging to a book club.

727
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:48,404
Would you like to come in
and have a nightcap, Joe?

728
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:50,705
Not until I get my shoes half-soled.

729
00:48:50,706 --> 00:48:53,800
Oh, thank you, Samuel,
but you needn't wait.

730
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:56,000
Thank you, Sam...

731
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,701
I was hoping you'd say
'Thank you, Dad.'

732
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:01,502
Sorry I'm not the butler's daughter.

733
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:03,203
- You're the cook.
- Hm-hmm.

734
00:49:03,504 --> 00:49:04,804
- Upstairs maid?
- No.

735
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:06,205
Downstairs maid.

736
00:49:06,406 --> 00:49:07,606
Got it.

737
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:09,676
You're a little girl from a poor family

738
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,500
and these nice rich people
took pity on you

739
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:13,701
and decided to raise you like you were
their own daughter.

740
00:49:14,302 --> 00:49:15,700
Nice people.

741
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,701
I don't know why
I'm impressed, though.

742
00:49:17,702 --> 00:49:19,500
I've lived in bigger buildings
than this, you know.

743
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:21,600
YMCA...
Good night, Letty.

744
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,040
You know, I've always wanted
to go to a burlesque show,

745
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,600
but nobody would ever take me.

746
00:49:27,901 --> 00:49:29,601
Believe me,
you won't want to go to this one.

747
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:31,102
But I do, Joe.

748
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,600
We could meet sometime
after the show.

749
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:37,000
All right, when?

750
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:39,200
Oh, I'll call you sometime,
maybe tomorrow...

751
00:49:39,201 --> 00:49:40,801
Tomorrow would be just fine.

752
00:49:43,502 --> 00:49:46,502
All right, you got yourself a date
with a red-nosed comic.

753
00:49:46,503 --> 00:49:49,200
I'll meet you in the little bar
across the street from the theater.

754
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:51,901
When I meet you there, we'll get out
like the place is contaminated.

755
00:49:51,902 --> 00:49:53,402
Which it is.

756
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:55,103
I'll be there.

757
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:00,999
Good night, Joe.

758
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,800
Prost time.

759
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:21,501
Hey, Joe.

760
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,102
What do you like in this one?

761
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,050
Give me a chance to get organized.

762
00:50:25,051 --> 00:50:27,451
I got some real live ones,
There's Parkway...

763
00:50:27,452 --> 00:50:29,652
- Philamon, Lala, Baby...
- How about Barnaby?

764
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:32,100
- Everybody's a handicapper.
- How about that?

765
00:50:32,101 --> 00:50:34,800
Couple of weeks ago she thought
a parlay was a conversation in French.

766
00:50:34,801 --> 00:50:37,501
A parlay is a conversation
in French, silly.

767
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:39,702
Besides, Barnaby's
my father's middle name.

768
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,603
Say, how about putting two bucks
on her old man's nose?

769
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:43,604
On her old man's nose, five.

770
00:50:45,105 --> 00:50:46,505
Put me down, will you?

771
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:51,806
It's amazing how we keep
running into your father.

772
00:50:51,807 --> 00:50:53,607
Running into him?
You haven't even met him yet.

773
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:54,900
Well, I haven't, huh?

774
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:56,450
Walking up Broadway the other day

775
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:58,550
he introduced me to one
of the skyscrapers he built.

776
00:50:58,551 --> 00:50:59,851
Then, coming out of Lindy's last week,

777
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,850
there was another one of his buildings
looking down on us.

778
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:03,951
Or was it the same one
following us around?

779
00:51:03,952 --> 00:51:05,800
I have to introduce him second hand.

780
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:07,500
You won't come to the house
and meet him.

781
00:51:07,501 --> 00:51:09,101
Why would he want to meet me?

782
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:11,502
Why not? I think you two
might hit it off.

783
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,200
That architect who won't touch
anything under sixty stories

784
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:18,401
and a pie-in-the-face comic.
What a great meeting of the minds.

785
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:21,300
Well, since you won't
come to meet him,

786
00:51:21,301 --> 00:51:23,000
he's going to come and see you.

787
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:25,600
In fact, we're both going to
come down to the theater tonight.

788
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:27,400
- Why would you...
- I've been waiting for you to invite me...

789
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:29,401
- ... but obviously...
- Invite you to what?

790
00:51:29,402 --> 00:51:30,402
To see what?

791
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:33,203
A bunch of strippers working
with one eye out for the cops?

792
00:51:33,204 --> 00:51:35,270
And a lot of tramps sleeping
in the place

793
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:36,700
sleeping off their hangovers?

794
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:37,701
Agh!

795
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:39,702
Joe, we're coming to see you.

796
00:51:39,703 --> 00:51:42,503
Whatever it is you do there,
I'm sure you do it very well.

797
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:47,450
Look, we've been seeing each other
almost every day for a month now.

798
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:50,251
We... we meet under
a clock in a restaurant...

799
00:51:50,252 --> 00:51:51,252
in a bar.

800
00:51:52,053 --> 00:51:53,453
Honestly,

801
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:56,154
don't you think it's a little silly
to go on like this?

802
00:51:58,455 --> 00:51:59,999
Yeah...

803
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,900
I guess it is.

804
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:06,000
I'll leave a couple of tickets
for you at the box office.

805
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:07,900
Get my baggy pants pressed.

806
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:10,401
And tell everybody to take a bath.

807
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:26,502
Why... it hasn't changed a bit
since my college days.

808
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:28,103
- Here you are, son.
- Thanks.

809
00:52:29,204 --> 00:52:31,904
Dad, remember I told you
how sensitive Joe is about...

810
00:52:31,905 --> 00:52:34,450
Now, Letty, if I were a snob
about these things

811
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,951
you would be too.

812
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:38,152
- All right, Dad.
- I'll get the tickets.

813
00:52:40,153 --> 00:52:41,170
You have two tickets for Page?

814
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:44,300
Page?
Oh, yeah... here you are.

815
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:46,601
You're all paid for.

816
00:52:47,002 --> 00:52:48,102
Oh, uh...

817
00:52:48,103 --> 00:52:50,200
What time does Mr. Lewis go on?

818
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:52,701
He don't.
He blew the show an hour ago.

819
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:53,999
Just walked out.

820
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,100
He always was a crazy banana.

821
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:05,501
Let's go home, honey.

822
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:11,402
No, you go on, Dad.
I think I know where to find him.

823
00:53:11,403 --> 00:53:14,503
- Letty, maybe it's better to...
- Please, dad.

824
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:18,604
All right, honey.

825
00:53:31,705 --> 00:53:32,705
Yeah.

826
00:53:36,406 --> 00:53:37,806
Hello, Joe.

827
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:41,107
You must be lost, young lady.
You don't belong here.

828
00:53:41,408 --> 00:53:43,208
But I do.

829
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:45,909
The wrong hotel.
You must have made a mistake.

830
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:48,000
I have a friend here.

831
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:49,601
Forget about your friend.

832
00:53:50,302 --> 00:53:53,602
That's all?
What happened to all the jokes?

833
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:54,703
The laughs...

834
00:53:55,504 --> 00:53:57,700
When I think of you and your father
sitting out there in the audience

835
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,350
I laugh so hard I could nearly die.

836
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:02,000
Joe, what are you ashamed of,
Burlesque?

837
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:04,050
Me? Oh, no.

838
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:06,500
I wear my fright wig
like a badge of honor.

839
00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:08,750
Just that I thought before
I met your father

840
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:10,800
I should do something
about my dressing room.

841
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:13,300
Dress it up a little bit,
get some architectural magazines...

842
00:54:13,301 --> 00:54:14,801
clean out the whisky bottles...

843
00:54:14,802 --> 00:54:17,500
- Sober up the mice and spray...
- Stop it, Joe!

844
00:54:17,501 --> 00:54:18,901
Please go, Letty.

845
00:54:19,702 --> 00:54:22,600
Maybe we'll meet again
at another benefit behind the cyc.

846
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:25,501
Only behind the cyc?

847
00:54:25,502 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah.
There everything looks good.

848
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:29,901
Even me.

849
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,900
- Look at me, Joe.
- I know what you look like, Letty.

850
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:36,101
But you don't know what I am like.

851
00:54:36,802 --> 00:54:39,802
Joe, don't you know I don't care
about your being in Burlesque?

852
00:54:39,803 --> 00:54:41,200
I don't care.

853
00:54:41,201 --> 00:54:43,200
Be anything,
be a tightrope walker,

854
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:46,101
sell vacuum cleaners
from door to door, do anything!

855
00:54:46,102 --> 00:54:49,200
I don't care.
Only just stop running.

856
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:53,801
Please look at me, Joe.

857
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:59,402
Do I have to do a striptease
to get you to look at me?

858
00:55:13,003 --> 00:55:14,503
Please go away.

859
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:19,104
Joe, that's not a nice way
to say I love you.

860
00:55:27,005 --> 00:55:29,305
What kind of a life
do you think it would be?

861
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:32,706
It could be any kind of a life
you want to make it, Joe.

862
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,707
I'm sorry.

863
00:55:37,408 --> 00:55:38,808
Never.

864
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:46,800
You know, not a single one of those holes
in your head even shows.

865
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,600
Express to the 8th floor, this way.

866
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:23,701
Eighth floor.

867
00:56:30,502 --> 00:56:31,700
Joe!

868
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:38,200
- How are you, Austin?
- I'm okay, I'm okay, and you?

869
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:42,100
Pretty good.
How's your wife... Cassie?

870
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:44,000
Swell, Joe...

871
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,701
You know, you shouldn't
have sent her that present.

872
00:56:46,702 --> 00:56:49,302
- She wasn't really sore.
- Well, I...

873
00:56:49,303 --> 00:56:52,203
Hey, you still with Sophie Tucker?

874
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:55,004
No, her regular man's back.
It was a temporary thing, you know.

875
00:56:56,305 --> 00:56:58,200
You still following the horses?

876
00:56:58,201 --> 00:57:00,999
Yeah, and the horses I follow
follow the horses.

877
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,800
Uh, what are you gonna do?

878
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:05,901
Oh, I'm going in here.
Kind of an audition.

879
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:08,000
Some new comic
they're trying to develop.

880
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:10,200
They think he might need
an accompanist.

881
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:14,000
I hope this guy likes me.

882
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:22,001
Come on, you new comic, you.

883
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:23,402
Make me laugh.

884
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:36,703
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

885
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,104
I know you're ladies and gentlemen

886
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:40,805
because this club only caters
to a select clientele

887
00:57:40,806 --> 00:57:42,000
- Hm-hmm?
- Yeah.

888
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:45,800
You can't get in here without money
and you can't get out with it.

889
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:50,701
I might add
you can't get out with it.

890
00:57:50,702 --> 00:57:52,000
Some joke.

891
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,501
You can't get out with it.

892
00:57:53,802 --> 00:57:55,600
- How's he doing?
- Letter perfect.

893
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:58,101
_ I should have had more rehearsal.
- Don't worry about your throat.

894
00:57:58,102 --> 00:58:00,402
Just take it easy on the high ones.

895
00:58:02,403 --> 00:58:04,303
You better lay off of that stuff.

896
00:58:05,604 --> 00:58:07,104
What happens if I lay an egg?

897
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:08,605
You're not gonna lay an egg.

898
00:58:08,606 --> 00:58:10,506
If I do, I'll color it
and use it for Easter.

899
00:58:10,707 --> 00:58:12,107
Prost time.

900
00:58:17,108 --> 00:58:19,400
I'm all right, Letty.
Honest, I'm fine, just fine.

901
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:20,901
I didn't say a word, darling.

902
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:22,800
Here you are, Cassie.

903
00:58:22,801 --> 00:58:25,000
- Anybody out there?
- The joint is packed!

904
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,801
Eight to five I empty it
in ten seconds.

905
00:58:26,802 --> 00:58:28,400
Did you get those bets down today?

906
00:58:28,401 --> 00:58:30,301
Bookies'll be around to collect them
in the morning.

907
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:31,900
Where did you get a suit like this?

908
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:33,200
You know, you should
have checked with me...

909
00:58:33,201 --> 00:58:35,401
Swifty, please, would you mind
waiting outside?

910
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:37,600
I'd like to be alone. Would you all
mind waiting outside for a minute?

911
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,401
- Please, you too, Letty.
- Yes, darling.

912
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:41,999
You only got a minute.

913
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,300
Baby.

914
00:58:47,401 --> 00:58:48,801
I'm sorry, I...

915
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:51,500
I don't know what it is.
I just feel like...

916
00:58:51,801 --> 00:58:54,900
well, like there are a thousand
Tim Coogans sitting out there.

917
00:58:54,901 --> 00:58:56,500
It's crazy, huh?

918
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:01,701
I love you, Joe.

919
00:59:13,402 --> 00:59:15,202
- Hey!
- Put it on my tab.

920
00:59:15,603 --> 00:59:17,903
- Here's to Burlesque.
- That's a good way to get there.

921
00:59:32,304 --> 00:59:34,004
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

922
00:59:34,005 --> 00:59:36,005
I know that you're ladies and gentlemen

923
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:39,400
because this club only caters
to a special clientele.

924
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:41,901
You can't get in with money...

925
00:59:41,902 --> 00:59:45,000
and I might add that you can't out
without money either.

926
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,900
Well, uh...

927
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:54,001
Guess I loused that one up pretty good.

928
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:57,102
You see, a joke is a delicate thing.

929
00:59:57,103 --> 01:00:00,103
If you breathe on it too heavy,
it dies.

930
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:01,904
Boy, am I a heavy breather.

931
01:00:06,805 --> 01:00:08,505
Will one of the waiters
please kill himself,

932
01:00:08,506 --> 01:00:10,706
because I don't feel
like dying up here alone.

933
01:00:15,307 --> 01:00:17,007
I seem to have a knack

934
01:00:17,008 --> 01:00:19,500
of taking a joke that can't
possibly get a laugh

935
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:20,701
and proving it.

936
01:00:25,202 --> 01:00:26,902
Please, I know you're not laughing,

937
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:28,703
but let us not make it a crusade.

938
01:00:29,704 --> 01:00:31,904
I don't have to do this for a living.

939
01:00:31,905 --> 01:00:35,405
I got oil wells.
Five hundred barrels a day.

940
01:00:35,406 --> 01:00:38,106
No oil. Just barrels.

941
01:00:40,507 --> 01:00:43,007
Boom-boom...
Oh, before I sing a little song,

942
01:00:43,008 --> 01:00:46,308
I'd like to introduce my pianist,
Mr. Austin Mack.

943
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:54,809
There's a guy can brighten up
a room by just leaving it.

944
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:01,110
You know, this is my first appearance
in a nightclub in a long time.

945
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:03,850
And it doesn't just mean
only applause, it means...

946
01:01:03,851 --> 01:01:05,351
well, it means money.

947
01:01:05,512 --> 01:01:07,712
But money isn't everything,
believe me.

948
01:01:07,713 --> 01:01:09,313
It can't buy poverty.

949
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:13,314
You see, being a comedian
is just a hobby with me.

950
01:01:13,815 --> 01:01:15,915
My real business is horses.

951
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:19,416
So I'm just a comedian so I can
put money back in my business.

952
01:01:23,017 --> 01:01:24,317
Mr. Mack.

953
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:31,018
# My bookie came #

954
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:34,719
# From out of nowhere. #

955
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,820
# He held out his hand #

956
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:44,521
# I offered mine. #

957
01:01:48,422 --> 01:01:50,422
# He whispered Joe #

958
01:01:50,723 --> 01:01:52,723
# Up with the dough #

959
01:01:53,024 --> 01:01:57,024
# Or you'll go where #

960
01:01:58,425 --> 01:02:01,225
# You'll never need a cent. #

961
01:02:02,426 --> 01:02:06,000
# And bet to your heart's content. #

962
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:13,401
# You know a guy making bets #
# without a dime in his kick #

963
01:02:14,302 --> 01:02:17,402
# is liable to wind up very sick. #

964
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:23,303
# You can't collect #
# the day your horse comes in #

965
01:02:24,504 --> 01:02:28,204
# and sing a ballad when it doesn't win #

966
01:02:28,205 --> 01:02:32,605
# Besides, I ain't in the mood #
# to take a loss #

967
01:02:34,406 --> 01:02:37,900
# My friend, you'd better come across. #

968
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:42,501
# Would you like to swing from a star? #

969
01:02:43,202 --> 01:02:45,402
# Carry moon beams... #

970
01:02:45,403 --> 01:02:48,303
Please, Mr. Mack, what are you
pushing me into a song like this?

971
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:51,800
Why are you crowding me? Be fair.
I'll pay the creeper's money.

972
01:03:20,701 --> 01:03:23,301
How's the uh...
weather in New York?

973
01:03:23,302 --> 01:03:24,802
Stormy.

974
01:03:24,803 --> 01:03:25,803
Your father?

975
01:03:26,204 --> 01:03:28,104
He's so terribly hurt and upset.

976
01:03:28,105 --> 01:03:30,600
He's never talked to me
in my life the way he did tonight.

977
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:33,501
He said my behavior is no better
than that of a camp follower.

978
01:03:33,502 --> 01:03:35,300
- Now, don't...
- Oh, Cassie.

979
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:38,300
We've always been so close.
The things he said, they...

980
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:40,201
He's just upset because he loves you.

981
01:03:41,102 --> 01:03:44,702
Maybe more to the point
because he thinks Joe doesn't.

982
01:03:44,703 --> 01:03:46,303
He's a parent, Letty.

983
01:03:46,304 --> 01:03:47,304
You know how parents are,

984
01:03:47,305 --> 01:03:49,905
they're short on moonlight
and long on marriage.

985
01:03:51,306 --> 01:03:53,406
Joe goes on in a minute.
We'd better go to the table.

986
01:03:55,307 --> 01:03:57,407
I just don't feel like it tonight, Cassie.

987
01:03:57,408 --> 01:03:59,108
Will you tell him
I'll meet him on the train?

988
01:03:59,109 --> 01:04:00,109
Please?

989
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:01,700
Yeah, sure.

990
01:04:01,999 --> 01:04:03,201
Thanks.

991
01:04:25,502 --> 01:04:26,800
Thank you.

992
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:28,601
Thank you very much.

993
01:04:28,602 --> 01:04:30,702
Thank you, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

994
01:04:35,303 --> 01:04:37,803
And uh, good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

995
01:04:37,804 --> 01:04:41,400
Excuse me for being a little late,
but I just walked back from the track.

996
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:45,400
What a day, what aggravation.
Most aggravating day.

997
01:04:45,801 --> 01:04:48,501
There was one race I bet on
could be a photo finish.

998
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:50,450
By the time my horse came in

999
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:52,251
it was too dark to take the pictures.

1000
01:04:54,952 --> 01:04:56,352
I can tell you this,

1001
01:04:56,353 --> 01:04:59,953
that if Paul Revere had ridden this horse
that I bet on today

1002
01:04:59,954 --> 01:05:02,954
today we'd be all speaking
with a British accent.

1003
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:06,855
This horse drove me to drink.

1004
01:05:06,856 --> 01:05:09,300
But, uh, I was going
in that direction anyway,

1005
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:10,701
it wouldn't have taken too long.

1006
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:13,690
As a matter of fact, I woke up this morning
at the crack of ice

1007
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:15,491
and I've been half stiff all day.

1008
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:21,000
But I don't believe in all these stories
about drinking being harmful.

1009
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,301
Not at all.

1010
01:05:22,302 --> 01:05:24,802
I had an uncle drank
half a quarter whisky every day of his life.

1011
01:05:24,803 --> 01:05:27,503
And he lived to be 28.

1012
01:05:32,604 --> 01:05:33,604
Boom-boom-bum...

1013
01:05:33,605 --> 01:05:36,405
I'd like to sing a nice little song
for you, ladies and gentlemen.

1014
01:05:36,406 --> 01:05:38,500
But before I do, uh...

1015
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,801
say hello to my pianist,
Mr. Austin Mack.

1016
01:05:44,302 --> 01:05:46,302
Mr. Mack is a very close
friend of mine.

1017
01:05:46,303 --> 01:05:48,303
He only plays like an animal.

1018
01:05:49,804 --> 01:05:52,604
What do you expect?
He has to listen to your jokes every night.

1019
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:58,900
Ladies and gentlemen, this young man
is doing the town tonight,

1020
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:00,501
and just between you and me,

1021
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:02,102
he ain't doing it much good.

1022
01:06:03,103 --> 01:06:04,103
Hey, Lewis,

1023
01:06:04,104 --> 01:06:07,400
I hear when you opened here
the management cut out the amusement tax.

1024
01:06:10,501 --> 01:06:13,301
Last time I saw a mouth like that
it had a hook in it.

1025
01:06:14,902 --> 01:06:16,602
Sssssss.

1026
01:06:18,003 --> 01:06:20,203
Oh, you'd better get yourself
vulcanized, buddy,

1027
01:06:20,204 --> 01:06:21,700
you're losing air.

1028
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:25,400
Now, if there are no more interruptions
from Austin's relatives,

1029
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,701
Boom-boom...

1030
01:06:30,402 --> 01:06:32,802
Those horses, they kick up
a lot of dust all day.

1031
01:06:32,803 --> 01:06:35,303
Open up your heart
and give a fellow a drink.

1032
01:06:36,904 --> 01:06:38,704
I'm thirsty, not dirty.

1033
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:42,000
She'll uh...
She'll meet you at the train.

1034
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:45,801
Well, it's prost time.

1035
01:06:55,002 --> 01:06:56,000
Come in.

1036
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:01,501
This must be the place.

1037
01:07:10,002 --> 01:07:14,002
Sorry, baby, I had to go over
the new routine with Austin...

1038
01:07:14,003 --> 01:07:15,603
it took a little longer than I figured.

1039
01:07:17,004 --> 01:07:20,300
Austin stuck his head in to say
good night over an hour ago.

1040
01:07:24,001 --> 01:07:26,901
He doesn't have to close up
the bar every night like I do.

1041
01:07:40,002 --> 01:07:43,502
Cassie was telling me
about the telephone call...

1042
01:07:43,503 --> 01:07:44,803
from your father.

1043
01:07:51,104 --> 01:07:52,950
Joe, I'm not going to stay in Chicago,

1044
01:07:52,951 --> 01:07:54,850
I'm going right on to New York
tomorrow morning.

1045
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:56,251
I think it's better this way.

1046
01:07:56,852 --> 01:07:59,052
- Why...
- Don't say any of the usual things, I...

1047
01:07:59,053 --> 01:08:02,553
I haven't forgotten that I'm here
because I wanted it that way.

1048
01:08:02,554 --> 01:08:07,154
You made no promises,
so no promises have been broken.

1049
01:08:08,955 --> 01:08:10,255
Good-bye, Joe.

1050
01:08:10,556 --> 01:08:13,456
I guess it really is good-bye.

1051
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,700
Good-bye?

1052
01:08:27,101 --> 01:08:29,500
That's not a nice way
to say I love you.

1053
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:31,401
- Oh, please, Joe.
- Letty.

1054
01:08:31,602 --> 01:08:33,700
Give me a little time.

1055
01:08:36,001 --> 01:08:38,401
I feel like I still have
a foot in Burlesque...

1056
01:08:38,402 --> 01:08:41,102
and the other foot
on a slippery nightclub floor.

1057
01:08:42,603 --> 01:08:45,103
I know no promises
have been made aloud but...

1058
01:08:45,904 --> 01:08:47,804
promises have been made.

1059
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:53,100
I just couldn't figure a way to tell you

1060
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:54,901
and get a laugh at the same time

1061
01:08:56,402 --> 01:08:59,102
I still haven't had a laugh,
I have told you.

1062
01:09:04,103 --> 01:09:06,603
You don't really want
to cancel me out, do you?

1063
01:09:14,604 --> 01:09:16,000
Oh, baby.

1064
01:09:16,501 --> 01:09:18,900
You had me scared good
there for a while.

1065
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:22,101
You had me talking
like a straight man.

1066
01:10:10,102 --> 01:10:11,502
Thank you very much.

1067
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:13,503
Thank you, thank you.

1068
01:10:13,504 --> 01:10:15,404
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1069
01:10:15,405 --> 01:10:19,105
As you know, tonight we wind up
our engagement here in Miami,

1070
01:10:19,106 --> 01:10:21,106
and the manager's been very kind.

1071
01:10:22,107 --> 01:10:25,007
He's invited us back next season
with a much better deal.

1072
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:26,408
We're gonna get paid.

1073
01:10:28,209 --> 01:10:29,700
And I really shouldn't complain

1074
01:10:29,701 --> 01:10:31,201
because during this engagement he told me

1075
01:10:31,202 --> 01:10:33,602
that I was allowed to drink
all the liquor I could possibly hold

1076
01:10:33,603 --> 01:10:35,800
and that was a thousand bucks
right there, you know.

1077
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:40,100
I'd like to thank my accompanist,
Mr. Austin Mack, at the piano.

1078
01:10:43,301 --> 01:10:45,300
Mr. Mack has been dead for a week now,

1079
01:10:45,301 --> 01:10:47,301
but I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

1080
01:10:53,902 --> 01:10:55,602
I'd like to uh...

1081
01:10:55,603 --> 01:10:57,303
have the girls come out
and say good-bye to you,

1082
01:10:57,304 --> 01:10:58,850
the girls of our line.
Girls, come on out...

1083
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:00,200
say good night to the audience.

1084
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:01,501
There they are.

1085
01:11:03,502 --> 01:11:04,802
Isn't that sweet?

1086
01:11:05,703 --> 01:11:06,803
Oh!

1087
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:08,804
Hold it, hold it.

1088
01:11:10,205 --> 01:11:11,505
Martha...

1089
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:13,066
You don't mind, do you?

1090
01:11:13,067 --> 01:11:15,800
I'd just like to remind you that
I'm doing all the comedy in the show.

1091
01:11:15,801 --> 01:11:17,001
I'm sorry, Mr. Lewis.

1092
01:11:17,002 --> 01:11:19,502
I mean, let's be fair,
I don't come out here in tights.

1093
01:11:19,503 --> 01:11:22,203
Well, maybe you should.
Then you'd really get laughs.

1094
01:11:25,004 --> 01:11:28,504
Pretty brave kid, coming out here
and ad-libbing with me and my three writers.

1095
01:11:29,105 --> 01:11:31,705
Swell, thanks for showing
all that courage, honey.

1096
01:11:31,706 --> 01:11:34,000
And I hope you don't have
too much trouble finding a new job.

1097
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,201
Here, here, here...

1098
01:11:37,102 --> 01:11:38,802
What is that, what is that...

1099
01:11:38,803 --> 01:11:40,303
what is all of that,
what does it mean?

1100
01:11:40,304 --> 01:11:42,604
Come on, speak up.
You're among friends uh...

1101
01:11:42,705 --> 01:11:44,305
temporarily.

1102
01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:47,006
Well, that's what they used to call
a skull in old vaudeville.

1103
01:11:47,007 --> 01:11:49,707
- Skull...
- I was born in a trunk.

1104
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:55,108
Looks more like you came
out of a violin case.

1105
01:11:58,009 --> 01:12:00,209
Go back in the paddock
with the rest of the fillies,

1106
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,410
thank you very much.

1107
01:12:03,711 --> 01:12:05,800
If I may get serious with you,
ladies and gentlemen,

1108
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:08,501
I'd like you to share with me
a piece of wonderful news.

1109
01:12:08,502 --> 01:12:10,602
In a couple of weeks, the entire cast...

1110
01:12:10,603 --> 01:12:12,403
the girls, Austin Mack and myself,

1111
01:12:12,404 --> 01:12:15,504
we'll all open in New York City
at the world famous Copacabana.

1112
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:19,600
When did all this happen?

1113
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,101
I don't know. He didn't say a word
about it, but it's wonderful.

1114
01:12:22,802 --> 01:12:25,002
Girls, wait a minute,
hold it, hold it, please...

1115
01:12:25,003 --> 01:12:28,603
Martha, not in front
of the future Mrs. Lewis, please.

1116
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:30,905
Be fair.

1117
01:12:32,006 --> 01:12:33,606
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

1118
01:12:33,607 --> 01:12:35,607
Behind every man, there's a woman.

1119
01:12:35,608 --> 01:12:37,308
Antony and Cleopatra,

1120
01:12:37,309 --> 01:12:39,209
Napoleon and Josephine,

1121
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,510
Heinz and the tomato,

1122
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:43,911
And now I want you to meet
the woman behind Joe Lewis.

1123
01:12:43,912 --> 01:12:46,612
She's a wonderful woman,
She's got a hole in her head...

1124
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,613
but she's a wonderful woman,

1125
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:49,814
Miss Letty Page.

1126
01:12:56,015 --> 01:12:58,315
We would like to invite all of you
to the wedding, but...

1127
01:12:58,316 --> 01:13:01,000
it's only for the immediate family,
the bride and the groom

1128
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,501
and the bookmakers.

1129
01:13:02,502 --> 01:13:04,402
What a way to propose.

1130
01:13:04,403 --> 01:13:07,503
Cassie, I don't care,
just so he proposed.

1131
01:13:08,004 --> 01:13:09,900
And until I see you again,
ladies and gentlemen,

1132
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:11,401
may the good Lord take a liking to you

1133
01:13:11,402 --> 01:13:12,802
but not too soon.

1134
01:13:23,903 --> 01:13:25,403
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen,

1135
01:13:25,404 --> 01:13:27,204
how about everybody
getting up to dance?

1136
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,765
You picked a winner, Joe,
and I think it's wonderful.

1137
01:13:31,766 --> 01:13:34,066
You kidding? I saw this coming
a long time ago.

1138
01:13:48,267 --> 01:13:50,367
By the way, I accept.

1139
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:55,868
Thanks, baby.

1140
01:13:56,469 --> 01:13:58,269
Thanks for a lot of things, too.

1141
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,470
You said that...

1142
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:24,671
I think if you look at these x-rays, Joe,

1143
01:14:24,672 --> 01:14:26,772
it'll be a little easier
for me to explain.

1144
01:14:27,473 --> 01:14:28,473
Doc,

1145
01:14:28,474 --> 01:14:31,374
don't ask me to look at the x-rays
and I won't ask you to tell any jokes.

1146
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:33,675
Just tell me what I'm supposed to do.

1147
01:14:34,476 --> 01:14:35,976
Stop drinking.

1148
01:14:36,577 --> 01:14:39,177
Oh, you gotta come up
with a better offer than that.

1149
01:14:40,278 --> 01:14:42,178
It's the only offer I've got.

1150
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:45,500
And if I were you,
I'd grab it while I still can.

1151
01:14:46,101 --> 01:14:48,000
Aw, come on, Doc,

1152
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:50,100
I look around and I see
a lot more old drunks

1153
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:51,900
than I see old doctors, you know.

1154
01:14:54,301 --> 01:14:57,901
Joe, at the rate you're going,
you'll never be an old drunk.

1155
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,302
Or a middle-aged one either.

1156
01:15:03,403 --> 01:15:05,903
I tried to stop drinking, Doc,
and I can't.

1157
01:15:06,604 --> 01:15:08,504
Millions of people have.

1158
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,600
I don't know about millions of people

1159
01:15:11,601 --> 01:15:13,201
I just know about me.

1160
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:15,402
If I couldn't get a drink

1161
01:15:15,403 --> 01:15:17,503
I wouldn't be able
to get out there on that floor.

1162
01:15:17,504 --> 01:15:19,204
I might as well just be dead.

1163
01:15:19,505 --> 01:15:22,905
Joe, I have lots of patients
in show business.

1164
01:15:22,906 --> 01:15:26,500
I can understand a man living
just to be an entertainer.

1165
01:15:26,901 --> 01:15:28,501
But dying for it?

1166
01:15:33,202 --> 01:15:35,702
This comes at a pretty
inconvenient time, Doc.

1167
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,703
I was planning on getting married.

1168
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:43,704
You're not doing the girl any favor.

1169
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,000
Not unless you have
a lot of insurance.

1170
01:15:49,101 --> 01:15:53,401
Well, lots of people have died.
It didn't kill them.

1171
01:15:53,902 --> 01:15:55,202
Some joke.

1172
01:15:56,903 --> 01:15:59,103
Joe, I'm sorry if a sound cruel.

1173
01:15:59,904 --> 01:16:02,404
I just want you to realize
how serious this is.

1174
01:16:04,005 --> 01:16:05,800
Here, here's a prescription

1175
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:08,501
It should relieve the pain anyhow.

1176
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,302
She's a wonderful girl, Doc.

1177
01:16:16,503 --> 01:16:17,803
Very wonderful.

1178
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:21,304
Well, I guess I can quit drinking.

1179
01:16:22,705 --> 01:16:25,905
Shouldn't be too tough. I've done
it a hundred times before.

1180
01:16:32,506 --> 01:16:35,406
- Hey, Jack.
- Two hundred, the first one down.

1181
01:16:35,407 --> 01:16:37,540
- You got a bet.
- Gotta keep it lively.

1182
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,108
- Hot dog?
- No, thanks.

1183
01:16:39,109 --> 01:16:40,000
- You want one, Joe?

1184
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:41,601
You know I never eat
on an empty stomach.

1185
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:44,301
What's the pill for, Joe?

1186
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:47,002
A little heartburn.

1187
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:48,403
That's all?

1188
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:50,904
Wanna make it three hundred?

1189
01:16:50,905 --> 01:16:52,705
No, two is enough.

1190
01:16:53,106 --> 01:16:54,306
Chicken.

1191
01:16:54,307 --> 01:16:56,307
Colonel Donovan, report to the office.

1192
01:16:56,308 --> 01:16:59,608
Colonel Donovan, report to the office.
Urgent.

1193
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,800
I don't know what you're
looking for in that bottle.

1194
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:05,700
But the faster you run after it,
the farther away it seems to get.

1195
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:08,271
If you want to give a lecture
in temperance

1196
01:17:08,272 --> 01:17:10,272
why don't you go and use
the public address system?

1197
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:14,000
- Look, Letty, I...
- Joe, what's wrong?

1198
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:16,301
I don't know,
I just don't know.

1199
01:17:16,302 --> 01:17:18,450
But for weeks now, I feel like
I've been split down in the middle

1200
01:17:18,451 --> 01:17:21,351
and going in two directions
at the same time. I don't know.

1201
01:17:22,252 --> 01:17:23,952
How about the three hundred, Jack?

1202
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,253
Okay, you're down.

1203
01:17:26,754 --> 01:17:28,354
Good boy, live dangerously.

1204
01:17:30,155 --> 01:17:31,600
Joe, as soon as you're through
with the Copa,

1205
01:17:31,601 --> 01:17:33,501
you've got to take a little rest.

1206
01:17:33,502 --> 01:17:36,600
- I'm not tired, Letty.
- Yes, you are. We both are.

1207
01:17:36,601 --> 01:17:38,930
Wouldn't it be nice to get away
from the crowd for a while

1208
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:40,331
just the two of us?

1209
01:17:40,332 --> 01:17:41,600
Attention, please.

1210
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:43,601
All Army and Navy personnel

1211
01:17:43,602 --> 01:17:46,602
report to the office immediately.
Urgent.

1212
01:17:46,603 --> 01:17:49,603
- What do you suppose is going on?
- Maybe Hitler invaded New York.

1213
01:17:49,604 --> 01:17:52,400
Impossible. Where could he find
a place to park?

1214
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:56,000
Ladies and Gentlemen. We interrupt
this game for a special announcement.

1215
01:17:56,901 --> 01:17:58,801
President Roosevelt has just announced

1216
01:17:58,802 --> 01:18:02,102
that the Japanese have attacked
Pearl Harbor by air.

1217
01:18:19,803 --> 01:18:21,203
Pretty creepy.

1218
01:18:21,204 --> 01:18:22,504
The street's so dark.

1219
01:18:22,505 --> 01:18:24,990
I suppose I'll be hearing
from the draft board.

1220
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:26,591
Not with your back.

1221
01:18:26,592 --> 01:18:27,692
Good evening.

1222
01:18:27,693 --> 01:18:29,900
They hung a closing notice
on us, Mr. Lewis.

1223
01:18:29,901 --> 01:18:32,200
Well, like Sherman said, war is hell.

1224
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:34,700
Maybe you'll have
to take a rest now, Joe.

1225
01:18:36,701 --> 01:18:39,501
What's going on here?
I thought he said the place was closed.

1226
01:18:39,502 --> 01:18:40,900
Say, did you hear the news?

1227
01:18:40,901 --> 01:18:42,900
Martha's marrying
that new head waiter.

1228
01:18:42,901 --> 01:18:44,100
I didn't know she had a reservation.

1229
01:18:44,101 --> 01:18:46,000
Anyway, it's a great excuse
for a party.

1230
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:48,001
She probably wants to get him
before the draft does.

1231
01:18:48,002 --> 01:18:50,400
Come on, the whole gang's here.
Champagne, caviar...

1232
01:18:50,401 --> 01:18:52,501
How about that?
Those two kids getting married.

1233
01:18:52,502 --> 01:18:54,402
Well, people still do...

1234
01:18:59,003 --> 01:19:00,653
Hi, Joe.
Hi, everybody.

1235
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:02,100
Whoa, whoa...

1236
01:19:02,101 --> 01:19:03,800
Congratulations.

1237
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:06,401
- So, let him live a little.
- Thanks.

1238
01:19:06,702 --> 01:19:07,900
Anyone else?

1239
01:19:07,901 --> 01:19:09,701
- Congratulations, Martha.
- Lots of happiness.

1240
01:19:09,702 --> 01:19:10,902
All the best, honey.

1241
01:19:12,703 --> 01:19:14,400
Gee, that was nice.

1242
01:19:14,401 --> 01:19:17,201
- But all the best to what?
- All the best to married life.

1243
01:19:17,202 --> 01:19:20,302
Oh, no, I'm not the one
that's getting married.

1244
01:19:20,303 --> 01:19:21,999
It's the other Martha.

1245
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,900
But I'm ready any time.

1246
01:19:23,901 --> 01:19:25,900
Come on, Mr. Piano Player,
let's go make some music, huh?

1247
01:19:25,901 --> 01:19:28,999
- Let's live a little.
- Well, just don't forget your back.

1248
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,600
Well, to our greatest ally.

1249
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:09,901
Scotland.

1250
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:16,800
Dad's going to work
for the War Production Board.

1251
01:20:16,801 --> 01:20:18,700
He asked me to close
our place here in town...

1252
01:20:18,701 --> 01:20:20,801
and keep house for him
in Washington.

1253
01:20:22,202 --> 01:20:23,402
Are you going?

1254
01:20:24,303 --> 01:20:26,103
Might as well, don't you think?

1255
01:20:26,104 --> 01:20:28,104
I thought I'd leave
tomorrow morning.

1256
01:20:29,605 --> 01:20:31,200
So soon, huh?

1257
01:20:32,301 --> 01:20:33,501
I guess so?

1258
01:20:37,502 --> 01:20:39,302
I guess you think it's kind of funny

1259
01:20:39,303 --> 01:20:42,200
that I made no further mention
about our getting married.

1260
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,600
Funny isn't exactly
the word I would have used.

1261
01:20:47,701 --> 01:20:49,601
It's not really what I meant.

1262
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,602
I uh... just don't know.

1263
01:20:54,203 --> 01:20:55,503
Joe...

1264
01:20:56,404 --> 01:20:58,504
you don't need to say anything.

1265
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:00,999
Think about it...

1266
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,100
when I'm not around
to make you feel guilty.

1267
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,701
I'll let you know where I am.

1268
01:21:06,502 --> 01:21:08,500
Whatever it is you decide,

1269
01:21:08,501 --> 01:21:10,601
just make sure
it's what you really want.

1270
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,602
Don't look so sad.

1271
01:21:17,003 --> 01:21:19,803
Come on, better join the kids.

1272
01:21:19,804 --> 01:21:21,304
They'll be hurt if we don't.

1273
01:21:36,805 --> 01:21:38,405
Well, I'm ready.

1274
01:21:39,306 --> 01:21:41,106
Take care of yourselves, you two.

1275
01:21:41,107 --> 01:21:43,407
Look, what can happen
on a U.S.O. tour?

1276
01:21:43,408 --> 01:21:45,708
I might fall on my accordion?

1277
01:21:46,209 --> 01:21:48,700
Joe... Joe, why isn't Letty here?

1278
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:51,101
Aren't you worried about her?

1279
01:21:51,602 --> 01:21:53,002
Austin, would you call the airport

1280
01:21:53,003 --> 01:21:55,250
and find out what happened to that plane.
He's in some kind of a fog.

1281
01:21:55,251 --> 01:21:58,251
Don't bother, Austin.
She's not coming, Cassie.

1282
01:21:59,652 --> 01:22:01,352
Not coming to say good-bye?

1283
01:22:01,353 --> 01:22:02,700
Why not?

1284
01:22:03,401 --> 01:22:06,101
Who knows why not.
She's just not coming, that's all.

1285
01:22:08,402 --> 01:22:09,802
Joe.

1286
01:22:11,203 --> 01:22:14,703
Joe, you never even told her
you were going overseas, did you?

1287
01:22:16,204 --> 01:22:18,400
Don't you even think she has
a right to know?

1288
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:19,800
Cassie, this is none of our business.

1289
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:22,400
Since when? Everything else in his life
seems to be our business.

1290
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:23,401
That's not fair...

1291
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:25,600
All right, hold it, Austin.
She's got a right to ask the question.

1292
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:28,201
Well then, why, Joe?
Why are you running out on her?

1293
01:22:28,702 --> 01:22:30,602
I don't understand this.

1294
01:22:30,999 --> 01:22:33,203
I'm doing her the greatest favor
I know how.

1295
01:22:33,504 --> 01:22:34,800
Joe...

1296
01:22:36,401 --> 01:22:38,999
Look, what kind of a marriage
do you think it would be, Cassie?

1297
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,400
A few fast years
in a cocktail shaker?

1298
01:22:41,401 --> 01:22:43,301
Why a few fast years?

1299
01:22:44,402 --> 01:22:47,202
Do you think she could take
to my brand of living?

1300
01:22:47,203 --> 01:22:48,700
Getting to bed at 6 o'clock
in the morning

1301
01:22:48,701 --> 01:22:51,201
and getting up at 2:30
in the afternoon and...

1302
01:22:51,202 --> 01:22:53,702
hanging around a lot of
smoke-filled joints...

1303
01:22:53,703 --> 01:22:55,700
with a bunch of drunks like me.

1304
01:22:55,701 --> 01:22:58,150
Listen to the same material,
the same jokes, the same songs

1305
01:22:58,151 --> 01:22:59,999
year in and year out,
it's no good.

1306
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,300
You can make it good
if you love her.

1307
01:23:05,201 --> 01:23:06,801
Don't you love her, Joe?

1308
01:23:10,802 --> 01:23:12,502
I guess you don't.

1309
01:23:15,003 --> 01:23:17,003
Cassie, you got a chip
on the wrong number.

1310
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:19,404
You couldn't possibly be
more wrong.

1311
01:23:20,005 --> 01:23:22,305
Letty's the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

1312
01:23:25,006 --> 01:23:27,106
Don't tell us, Joe.

1313
01:23:27,107 --> 01:23:28,807
Tell her.

1314
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:30,808
Yeah.

1315
01:23:32,309 --> 01:23:33,909
It wouldn't get a laugh.

1316
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:53,210
Dear Cassie,

1317
01:23:54,311 --> 01:23:56,811
we arrived at
(censored)

1318
01:23:59,012 --> 01:24:02,812
and took off right away
to entertain the troops at (censored)

1319
01:24:02,813 --> 01:24:05,513
(censored) (censored)

1320
01:24:05,514 --> 01:24:07,314
where we (censored)

1321
01:24:07,315 --> 01:24:09,015
So much for details.

1322
01:24:10,016 --> 01:24:12,116
Joe and I are scared stiff of flying

1323
01:24:12,117 --> 01:24:15,557
but Joe had a long talk
with this (censored) officer.

1324
01:24:15,608 --> 01:24:19,918
Major, I refuse to fly in anything
smaller than a four-motor plane.

1325
01:24:19,919 --> 01:24:21,999
See, it's against my religion.

1326
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,700
I'm a devout coward.

1327
01:24:26,701 --> 01:24:30,501
But Major, the Army promised us
nothing but four motors.

1328
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:36,002
Joe, you don't look well.

1329
01:24:36,003 --> 01:24:40,103
Look well... I'm beginning to look
like my passport picture.

1330
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:45,704
What a night this turned out to be.

1331
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:48,395
Joe Lewis in a flying electric fan,

1332
01:24:48,396 --> 01:24:50,196
accompanied by Austin Mack.

1333
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,397
Hey, Joe, it's hot in here.

1334
01:24:56,398 --> 01:24:59,298
Yeah, maybe we oughta ask
the captain to open one of the windows.

1335
01:25:15,299 --> 01:25:17,899
I've been with the U.S.O. now
for quite a few months...

1336
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,100
and I've seen plenty of action.

1337
01:25:20,101 --> 01:25:22,601
But I still like
the American broads better.

1338
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:26,702
If you wonder why I'm not
in the service, it's simple.

1339
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,503
They classified me 5-F.

1340
01:25:28,504 --> 01:25:30,504
That's a coward with dependence.

1341
01:25:33,005 --> 01:25:34,605
Well, I got an uncle.

1342
01:25:35,206 --> 01:25:37,606
This guy's got scrambled eggs
on his cap.

1343
01:25:37,607 --> 01:25:40,999
He's got fruit salad on his chest,
hash marks all over his arms.

1344
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,500
He's no hero, he's a sloppy eater.

1345
01:25:47,001 --> 01:25:50,301
'General quarters.'
'General quarters.'

1346
01:25:50,302 --> 01:25:52,902
'Now all men back
to their battle stations.'

1347
01:25:52,903 --> 01:25:53,999
You boys stay down here.

1348
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,700
'All men man your battle stations.'

1349
01:25:55,701 --> 01:25:58,201
'Enemy aircraft sighted.'

1350
01:26:18,002 --> 01:26:21,102
It don't...
don't look so good, does it?

1351
01:26:21,103 --> 01:26:22,803
We ain't winning.

1352
01:26:25,604 --> 01:26:26,904
What are you thinking about?

1353
01:26:26,905 --> 01:26:27,905
Cassie.

1354
01:26:27,906 --> 01:26:29,999
What are you thinking about?

1355
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,800
Letty.

1356
01:26:38,001 --> 01:26:39,601
You should have married her.

1357
01:27:05,602 --> 01:27:07,402
Well, it won't be long now.

1358
01:27:09,103 --> 01:27:10,803
What are you smiling about?

1359
01:27:12,604 --> 01:27:14,504
I was just thinking
what Cassie's gonna say

1360
01:27:14,505 --> 01:27:16,205
when I tell her
I'm gonna marry Letty.

1361
01:27:16,206 --> 01:27:19,306
Cassie? What do you think
Letty's gonna say?

1362
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,207
- Who is it?
- It's me, honey.

1363
01:27:34,608 --> 01:27:38,408
Austin!
Austin, wait just a minute!

1364
01:27:38,809 --> 01:27:41,600
Oh, Austin, darling!

1365
01:27:41,601 --> 01:27:44,601
How wonderful to see you!
I thought you'd never get here.

1366
01:27:45,102 --> 01:27:46,500
Joe!

1367
01:27:46,501 --> 01:27:48,800
What took you so long?
I waited for you at one o'clock.

1368
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:51,600
Oh, darling, it's so wonderful
to have you back.

1369
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:54,101
I missed you so much I couldn't sleep
just thinking about you.

1370
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,200
I won't be here long,
unless you get me a sleeping pill.

1371
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:57,601
I'm gonna make a call.

1372
01:27:57,602 --> 01:28:00,402
Here, I got some champagne
for you all. Darling, open it.

1373
01:28:02,603 --> 01:28:04,403
Operator, get me long distance.

1374
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,304
Who are you calling
at this time of night?

1375
01:28:06,305 --> 01:28:07,305
Letty.

1376
01:28:07,306 --> 01:28:08,506
How's she been?

1377
01:28:10,007 --> 01:28:12,607
I don't know.
We haven't kept in touch.

1378
01:28:13,008 --> 01:28:15,108
What are you calling her about?

1379
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:16,909
I'm gonna marry her.

1380
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:21,010
Austin, will you open
that champagne and...

1381
01:28:22,011 --> 01:28:23,611
pour Joe a drink.

1382
01:28:23,612 --> 01:28:24,812
No, I don't want any,
thank you.

1383
01:28:26,013 --> 01:28:27,613
I think you will.

1384
01:28:29,114 --> 01:28:31,014
Letty got married, Joe.

1385
01:28:31,615 --> 01:28:33,415
Two weeks ago.

1386
01:28:34,316 --> 01:28:36,216
I read it in the paper.

1387
01:28:44,217 --> 01:28:45,607
Got married, huh?

1388
01:28:49,008 --> 01:28:51,008
I can't say that I blame her.

1389
01:28:52,809 --> 01:28:55,409
Two years, hanging around...

1390
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:58,210
Pretty tough on her, too.

1391
01:29:00,511 --> 01:29:03,111
She's right,
she's absolutely right.

1392
01:29:05,412 --> 01:29:07,700
I sure don't need anybody
to cut my throat.

1393
01:29:07,701 --> 01:29:09,400
I do a good enough job.

1394
01:29:09,401 --> 01:29:11,200
Joe, look, it's done now...

1395
01:29:11,201 --> 01:29:12,601
Why can't you just...

1396
01:29:13,802 --> 01:29:15,302
Happy New Year.

1397
01:30:06,603 --> 01:30:09,903
Ladies and gentlemen, a great big
round of applause

1398
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:11,999
for Martha, she deserves it.

1399
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,900
She deserves it because this kid

1400
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:18,401
kicks herself in the head
forty times a day.

1401
01:30:18,402 --> 01:30:20,402
And that's
what's the matter with her.

1402
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:24,503
- Would you get me a refill, please?
- Are you sure, Joe?

1403
01:30:24,504 --> 01:30:27,404
Don't worry about me,
I only drink to steady my nerves.

1404
01:30:30,005 --> 01:30:32,105
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
I only drink to steady...

1405
01:30:32,106 --> 01:30:34,800
and I wanna tell you something.
Sometimes I get so steady,

1406
01:30:34,801 --> 01:30:36,201
I can't move.

1407
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,302
And I'm very happy, ladies and gentlemen,
to be back here in the Copacaboo

1408
01:30:43,403 --> 01:30:46,703
and I'm very pleased to see that
so many of my friends are here tonight.

1409
01:30:46,704 --> 01:30:49,004
Plus a few sober people.

1410
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,605
Uh... I can't wait to see
what I'm gonna say next.

1411
01:30:57,206 --> 01:31:01,786
Mr. Mack here, he took up drinking
when he was overseas.

1412
01:31:01,787 --> 01:31:03,187
You know, there were some days

1413
01:31:03,188 --> 01:31:05,300
he was so drunk
I could hardly see him.

1414
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:16,900
This kid reminds me
of a school teacher I once had.

1415
01:31:16,901 --> 01:31:19,201
She used to keep me
after school every day.

1416
01:31:19,202 --> 01:31:21,902
We were both expelled
at the same time.

1417
01:31:23,203 --> 01:31:26,003
Your cocktail, Mr. Lewis.
Would you like me to shake it?

1418
01:31:26,004 --> 01:31:27,704
Yeah, if you please, yes.

1419
01:31:31,805 --> 01:31:34,105
You want it to curdle?
Thank you.

1420
01:31:38,306 --> 01:31:40,906
It's been said many times that

1421
01:31:40,907 --> 01:31:42,807
whisky improves with age.

1422
01:31:42,808 --> 01:31:44,808
The older you get,
the more you like it.

1423
01:31:47,309 --> 01:31:48,909
Prost time.

1424
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:54,410
Hey, that's tea.

1425
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:59,911
You know, there are certain people
who think I drink too much.

1426
01:31:59,912 --> 01:32:03,912
Well, I resent it.
I do not deny it, I resent it.

1427
01:32:09,413 --> 01:32:10,413
Joe...

1428
01:32:10,414 --> 01:32:12,214
I can handle it.
Everything's fine.

1429
01:32:17,415 --> 01:32:19,415
You might be interested to know
that my doctor told me

1430
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:21,800
that I would have to cut down
on my drinking, smoking,

1431
01:32:21,801 --> 01:32:23,900
and running around with a lot of girls.

1432
01:32:23,901 --> 01:32:26,801
Well, there was only one thing
I could do about that.

1433
01:32:26,802 --> 01:32:28,000
And I did it.

1434
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,601
I changed doctors.

1435
01:32:30,202 --> 01:32:34,300
He asked me how I got in this kind of
rundown condition that' I'm in

1436
01:32:34,301 --> 01:32:35,501
so I told him.

1437
01:32:35,502 --> 01:32:38,000
He thought about it
for a while and he said,

1438
01:32:38,001 --> 01:32:40,101
Ask her if she's got a friend for me.

1439
01:32:42,502 --> 01:32:44,890
Prost time, Joe, prost time.

1440
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:45,973
Yeah!

1441
01:32:45,974 --> 01:32:46,974
Ne'er wait.

1442
01:33:04,575 --> 01:33:08,575
I seem to be having trouble
getting away from the prost.

1443
01:33:14,176 --> 01:33:15,276
Uh...

1444
01:33:16,777 --> 01:33:20,000
Do you mind if I sit down
doing this, because uh...

1445
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:28,501
I don't like the room
spinning around while I'm standing up.

1446
01:33:33,002 --> 01:33:35,702
I used to be a very romantic fella.

1447
01:33:36,703 --> 01:33:39,603
When I look around
at all these young fellas, I...

1448
01:33:39,604 --> 01:33:41,204
realize I'm an old man.

1449
01:33:42,305 --> 01:33:45,805
An old man is somebody
who can't take yes for an answer.

1450
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,600
I used to go dancing a lot, too.

1451
01:33:55,001 --> 01:33:57,501
And I learned dancing
from Arthur Murray.

1452
01:33:57,802 --> 01:34:00,502
But I found out
it was more fun with a girl.

1453
01:34:05,403 --> 01:34:08,903
Don't worry about my staggering
when I walk, ladies and gentlemen,

1454
01:34:08,904 --> 01:34:11,704
because I always manage
to fall in a straight line.

1455
01:34:18,805 --> 01:34:21,605
Not so loud, pal.
They might here you out front.

1456
01:34:24,006 --> 01:34:27,306
But I've seen enough
of this married life, you know.

1457
01:34:27,307 --> 01:34:29,207
I had a friend
who was married and...

1458
01:34:29,208 --> 01:34:32,100
the first time
he came home at 8 a.m.,

1459
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:34,701
his wife hit the ceiling.

1460
01:34:35,602 --> 01:34:38,902
She uh... she hit the ceiling.

1461
01:34:40,303 --> 01:34:41,303
She...

1462
01:34:41,304 --> 01:34:44,100
she was a poor shot,
that's the joke.

1463
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:45,401
She was a poor shot.

1464
01:34:45,402 --> 01:34:48,702
But... that's enough of that.
Let's have a song, Mr. Mack.

1465
01:34:48,703 --> 01:34:50,703
Uh... All The Way.

1466
01:35:00,704 --> 01:35:03,204
# When you find a lover #

1467
01:35:03,205 --> 01:35:07,205
# It's no good unless you love her #

1468
01:35:08,706 --> 01:35:11,106
# All the way. #

1469
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:14,907
# Never just a little #

1470
01:35:15,208 --> 01:35:18,608
# Don't go dealing from the middle #

1471
01:35:20,909 --> 01:35:23,409
# All the way. #

1472
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:30,210
# Stay there for the full nine innings #

1473
01:35:30,211 --> 01:35:33,811
# And pitch with all your heart. #

1474
01:35:35,612 --> 01:35:40,512
# Stay there, double up your winnings #

1475
01:35:41,813 --> 01:35:44,500
# Don't let go of her. #

1476
01:35:45,001 --> 01:35:47,201
# If you're smart. #

1477
01:35:49,102 --> 01:35:52,000
# You won't find another #

1478
01:35:52,999 --> 01:35:56,601
# who is in your corner. #

1479
01:36:03,002 --> 01:36:05,202
Hey, pal,
you were left of the prost!

1480
01:36:13,603 --> 01:36:16,303
I should have drunk
to the bride and the groom.

1481
01:36:33,104 --> 01:36:35,600
Joe, what is it? Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

1482
01:36:37,401 --> 01:36:38,701
It's all right.

1483
01:36:46,002 --> 01:36:48,500
- Help him to the bed...
- What's the matter, Joe?

1484
01:36:48,501 --> 01:36:49,801
Put him up here.

1485
01:36:50,302 --> 01:36:52,000
Just take it easy, Joe.

1486
01:36:52,001 --> 01:36:53,200
Lie still there.

1487
01:36:53,201 --> 01:36:56,300
I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just
you people are spinning around...

1488
01:36:56,301 --> 01:36:58,701
Everybody out, come on!
How do you feel, Joe?

1489
01:36:58,702 --> 01:37:00,102
Just great, great.

1490
01:37:00,103 --> 01:37:02,203
My arteries are as hard as rocks.

1491
01:37:02,204 --> 01:37:04,204
I got blood on my alcoholic system.

1492
01:37:04,205 --> 01:37:07,105
Please don't joke, Joe.
I'll get you some coffee.

1493
01:37:07,106 --> 01:37:10,106
- I'd better call him a doctor.
- Don't call me a doctor, call me a drunk.

1494
01:37:14,807 --> 01:37:16,807
I got the answer.

1495
01:37:16,808 --> 01:37:19,200
I'm gonna go to Florida
and settle down

1496
01:37:19,201 --> 01:37:21,400
and take it easy.
I'm gonna quit alcohol.

1497
01:37:21,401 --> 01:37:23,301
Would you like some coffee, Joe?

1498
01:37:23,302 --> 01:37:27,002
Yeah, Cassie's right,
I may even get married.

1499
01:37:27,403 --> 01:37:31,203
Everybody gets married.
I guess I ought to find a nice girl

1500
01:37:36,704 --> 01:37:38,604
Get married...

1501
01:37:47,805 --> 01:37:49,905
I just don't understand it.

1502
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:52,906
How can it rain in Florida
in the middle of the season?

1503
01:37:52,907 --> 01:37:55,607
Just a spell of California weather.

1504
01:37:56,508 --> 01:37:59,808
Suddenly I'm all goose-pimply
and weak in the knees.

1505
01:37:59,809 --> 01:38:01,709
Relax, it comes with the trousseau.

1506
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,910
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Cassie.

1507
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:06,400
You'll do all right,
just so you two love each other.

1508
01:38:06,401 --> 01:38:09,701
I know how I feel.
I'm just crazy about him.

1509
01:38:09,702 --> 01:38:11,902
Sure you are, honey,
but do you love him?

1510
01:38:12,403 --> 01:38:15,403
Cassie, to me he's more fun,

1511
01:38:15,404 --> 01:38:17,804
more excitement than anyone
I ever knew.

1512
01:38:17,805 --> 01:38:20,005
And we like the same people,
the same things,

1513
01:38:20,006 --> 01:38:22,006
work all night, sleep all day...

1514
01:38:22,007 --> 01:38:23,900
It's gonna be a ball.

1515
01:38:23,901 --> 01:38:26,401
Well, just so it's a marriage too.

1516
01:38:26,702 --> 01:38:29,702
Say, you think
I'm making a mistake?

1517
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:33,603
I'm betting on you
live happily ever after.

1518
01:38:33,604 --> 01:38:34,704
Thanks, honey.

1519
01:38:35,705 --> 01:38:39,105
I know Joe's
always been stuck on Letty.

1520
01:38:40,306 --> 01:38:42,306
But I've always been stuck on him.

1521
01:38:42,307 --> 01:38:45,000
A lot of people would say
there isn't much sense in that.

1522
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:46,701
But there really is.

1523
01:38:46,999 --> 01:38:48,502
Sure there is.

1524
01:38:48,503 --> 01:38:51,403
And Joe's been on the wagon
almost two months.

1525
01:38:51,404 --> 01:38:53,504
That should prove something.

1526
01:38:53,505 --> 01:38:54,905
Sure it does.

1527
01:38:55,106 --> 01:38:56,406
Well...

1528
01:38:59,007 --> 01:39:00,407
I'm ready.

1529
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,108
This marriage is going to be
a wonderful thing.

1530
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,400
Just what I needed.

1531
01:39:12,401 --> 01:39:14,701
- Prost time, Joe.
- Yeah.

1532
01:39:15,302 --> 01:39:17,102
Kind of sloppy track though, uh?

1533
01:39:17,103 --> 01:39:19,903
- We're a winning entry.
- I'm giving you out. Let's go.

1534
01:39:24,004 --> 01:39:25,800
That's bridal music?

1535
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:27,801
Get married on a Muskrat Ramble?

1536
01:39:27,802 --> 01:39:30,802
Don't get excited. They parlay this
until 'Here Comes the Bride.'

1537
01:39:35,403 --> 01:39:37,803
Martha and Joe,
you are now man and wife.

1538
01:39:37,804 --> 01:39:40,104
Joe, now you may kiss the bride.

1539
01:39:49,505 --> 01:39:51,505
Hey come on,
we gotta cut the cake.

1540
01:39:55,806 --> 01:39:58,606
Oh, honey, hold my hand
like they do in the advertisements.

1541
01:40:00,107 --> 01:40:02,107
Joe, where are they going
with the cake?

1542
01:40:02,108 --> 01:40:03,708
They're running it out.

1543
01:40:04,509 --> 01:40:06,609
Hey, who catered this wedding,
Nick, the Greek?

1544
01:40:06,610 --> 01:40:08,650
Here, the bride and groom
have the first roll.

1545
01:40:08,651 --> 01:40:10,300
Come on you gotta hurry
or you'll miss our plane.

1546
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:13,300
Oh, my beautiful cake...
Bye, everybody.

1547
01:40:14,352 --> 01:40:16,652
- Joe!
- So long, bye, bye...

1548
01:40:16,653 --> 01:40:18,700
- Bless you both.
- Bye-bye, Austin, thank you so much.

1549
01:40:18,701 --> 01:40:20,999
Oh, the flowers!

1550
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,400
You're all set.

1551
01:40:29,301 --> 01:40:31,500
I got your luggage at the airport.

1552
01:40:31,501 --> 01:40:33,999
And I got your tickets
in the side pocket there, Joe.

1553
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
And your reservation at the Hotel Bermuda.
Now, good luck, kids.

1554
01:40:37,001 --> 01:40:39,300
- Thanks, Swifty.
- Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1555
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:41,750
- A telegram.
- We'll read them when we get back.

1556
01:40:41,751 --> 01:40:43,551
Wait a minute. Look,
there's one important here.

1557
01:40:43,552 --> 01:40:45,552
It's for you, Martha.
You gotta answer this.

1558
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,253
Joe!

1559
01:40:49,254 --> 01:40:51,150
Oh, Joe, honey,
it's from my agent.

1560
01:40:51,151 --> 01:40:52,950
He wants me to come
to Hollywood right away.

1561
01:40:52,951 --> 01:40:55,051
He's got a wonderful part
in a movie for me.

1562
01:40:55,452 --> 01:40:57,650
Congratulations, baby.
When are you supposed to be there?

1563
01:40:57,651 --> 01:40:58,800
It says Wednesday.

1564
01:40:59,101 --> 01:41:00,601
But what am I talking about?

1565
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:02,302
We'll be on our honeymoon
on Wednesday.

1566
01:41:03,403 --> 01:41:05,903
Oh, Joe, I wanna go
and I don't wanna go.

1567
01:41:05,904 --> 01:41:08,400
I'm like a Dr. Jeckel and a Mr. Hyde.

1568
01:41:08,401 --> 01:41:10,701
Yeah, I know, Mr. Hyde
with a split personality.

1569
01:41:11,802 --> 01:41:14,402
No, our honeymoon is more important.

1570
01:41:15,503 --> 01:41:17,300
- Swifty, you send him an answer.
- Yeah.

1571
01:41:17,301 --> 01:41:19,801
Tell him I...
What'll I say?

1572
01:41:21,002 --> 01:41:23,202
What does any girl
tell a Hollywood producer?

1573
01:41:23,503 --> 01:41:24,603
No.

1574
01:41:26,704 --> 01:41:28,404
For a memento?

1575
01:41:28,405 --> 01:41:29,750
So long, Swifty.
- Bye-bye, Swifty.

1576
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:30,999
Good luck, kids.

1577
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,400
Prost time, ladies and gentlemen

1578
01:41:52,101 --> 01:41:53,901
It's nice to be in Hollywood.

1579
01:41:57,002 --> 01:41:58,102
I needed that.

1580
01:41:58,103 --> 01:41:59,500
I've been on the wagon for two months

1581
01:41:59,501 --> 01:42:01,100
and I think I was pretty thirsty.

1582
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:06,150
You know, there's a big federal tax
on whisky these days

1583
01:42:06,151 --> 01:42:08,000
and that's the only reason
why I drink.

1584
01:42:08,001 --> 01:42:09,301
I'm patriotic.

1585
01:42:11,102 --> 01:42:13,600
Believe me, I'm so patriotic
I get up every day

1586
01:42:13,601 --> 01:42:15,500
with red, white and blue eyes.

1587
01:42:16,901 --> 01:42:18,701
If you think they look bad
from where you are

1588
01:42:18,702 --> 01:42:20,402
you should be
on this side of them.

1589
01:42:22,103 --> 01:42:24,403
My thought for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen,

1590
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:26,504
marriage is a wonderful thing.

1591
01:42:26,505 --> 01:42:28,605
After all, without marriage,

1592
01:42:28,606 --> 01:42:31,306
husbands and wives
would have to fight with strangers.

1593
01:42:33,707 --> 01:42:35,127
It's a funny thing, though,

1594
01:42:35,128 --> 01:42:37,800
a man never realizes
what happiness really is

1595
01:42:37,801 --> 01:42:39,301
until he gets married.

1596
01:42:39,302 --> 01:42:40,502
And then it's too late.

1597
01:42:42,203 --> 01:42:45,103
You know that Martha and I only knew
each other for a few weeks

1598
01:42:45,104 --> 01:42:48,404
and after we were married,
we were complete strangers.

1599
01:42:51,205 --> 01:42:53,300
You see, we got a little problem.

1600
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:56,101
I work all night
and Martha works all day.

1601
01:42:56,302 --> 01:42:59,602
And uh... this is not
my idea of a honeymoon.

1602
01:42:59,603 --> 01:43:01,900
Let's face it, ladies and gentlemen.

1603
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:05,800
You know, the last time I kissed Martha
was the day we were married.

1604
01:43:05,801 --> 01:43:08,001
It's beginning to worry me
a little bit now.

1605
01:43:09,302 --> 01:43:10,702
This morning, she went to work,

1606
01:43:10,703 --> 01:43:13,303
she left me a little note
started out, 'Dear sir'.

1607
01:43:17,204 --> 01:43:19,204
We better have a song, Mr. Mack.

1608
01:43:19,205 --> 01:43:21,600
I'd like to dedicate this little song,
ladies and gentlemen,

1609
01:43:21,601 --> 01:43:22,701
to my bride.

1610
01:43:22,702 --> 01:43:23,702
Mr. Mack.

1611
01:43:28,603 --> 01:43:32,103
# I got married to a girl #

1612
01:43:32,704 --> 01:43:34,304
# Naturally.

1613
01:43:35,605 --> 01:43:39,505
# I know cause she was dressed up #
# like a bride #

1614
01:43:40,806 --> 01:43:43,606
# Up to now it's pretty tame #

1615
01:43:43,607 --> 01:43:46,707
# All I did was change her name #

1616
01:43:46,708 --> 01:43:49,708
# At least I know my folks #

1617
01:43:49,709 --> 01:43:51,609
# are satisfied. #

1618
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:56,110
# She became a movie star #

1619
01:43:57,211 --> 01:43:58,711
# Naturally. #

1620
01:43:59,012 --> 01:44:03,212
# And the hours don't quite #
# coincide for us #

1621
01:44:04,513 --> 01:44:07,613
# So the only time we meet #

1622
01:44:07,614 --> 01:44:10,614
# is when I give her my seat #

1623
01:44:10,615 --> 01:44:15,015
# as she gets on #
# and I get off the bus. #

1624
01:44:18,016 --> 01:44:20,716
# Martha, Martha #

1625
01:44:20,717 --> 01:44:23,817
# Where is Martha? #

1626
01:44:24,618 --> 01:44:27,818
# Are we making any dough? #

1627
01:44:28,219 --> 01:44:29,819
# Naturally. #

1628
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:34,720
# Even more than just #
# our ordinary pay #

1629
01:44:35,701 --> 01:44:38,921
# We endorse a lot of things #

1630
01:44:38,922 --> 01:44:42,122
# Like that bed with in it springs #

1631
01:44:42,123 --> 01:44:46,323
# That you see in all #
# the magazines today #

1632
01:44:48,024 --> 01:44:51,924
# The one on the left side is she #

1633
01:44:54,025 --> 01:44:57,825
The one on the right side, #
# that's me. #

1634
01:44:59,326 --> 01:45:04,126
# It's the only time we got together #

1635
01:45:04,627 --> 01:45:08,727
# Naturally. #

1636
01:45:20,028 --> 01:45:22,428
I got a great cure
for a hangover, Swifty.

1637
01:45:22,829 --> 01:45:25,329
You take a juice
and a bottle of scotch,

1638
01:45:25,330 --> 01:45:26,430
You better get to bed, Joe.

1639
01:45:26,431 --> 01:45:27,431
Hey, I got an idea.

1640
01:45:27,432 --> 01:45:29,832
How about having one for O'Grady
and one for my load.

1641
01:45:29,833 --> 01:45:31,999
No thanks, good night.

1642
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:35,700
Wake up Martha.

1643
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:40,801
That's a very nice idea.

1644
01:45:51,202 --> 01:45:53,550
Come down off your tippy toes,
I'm not asleep.

1645
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:54,650
Hi, honey.

1646
01:45:54,701 --> 01:45:55,999
Hello, stranger.

1647
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,000
No, no, you'll smudge my lipstick.

1648
01:46:01,201 --> 01:46:04,001
That's the dream of every clean-cut
American boy.

1649
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,800
Would you say that we
are turning out to be

1650
01:46:14,801 --> 01:46:17,000
like two ships
that pass in the night?

1651
01:46:17,901 --> 01:46:20,301
That's a very familiar smoke stack.

1652
01:46:29,002 --> 01:46:31,602
Isn't it pretty light
to be coming in even for you?

1653
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:34,003
Funny...

1654
01:46:34,004 --> 01:46:35,704
I was thinking that...

1655
01:46:35,705 --> 01:46:37,905
it was pretty early to be leaving.

1656
01:46:37,906 --> 01:46:39,406
Even for you.

1657
01:46:40,807 --> 01:46:43,307
I have to be at the studio
by six, honey.

1658
01:46:50,708 --> 01:46:53,608
I knew I had a reason
for not coming home earlier.

1659
01:46:55,309 --> 01:46:56,600
I'd have wakened you...

1660
01:46:56,601 --> 01:46:58,901
you'd have had dark circles
under your eyes,

1661
01:46:59,102 --> 01:47:01,202
and it would have been
no good for your close ups.

1662
01:47:01,203 --> 01:47:03,803
You mustn't spoil
the lady's close ups.

1663
01:47:05,204 --> 01:47:07,604
Have you decided
about playing Las Vegas?

1664
01:47:10,705 --> 01:47:12,005
Hm-hmm.

1665
01:47:13,006 --> 01:47:15,100
Yeah, the boys are coming around
in a month or so

1666
01:47:15,101 --> 01:47:16,701
to start working on the act.

1667
01:47:17,602 --> 01:47:20,602
But I sure would like
to skip Vegas.

1668
01:47:21,003 --> 01:47:23,203
Maybe go on a vacation.

1669
01:47:24,704 --> 01:47:26,004
Together.

1670
01:47:27,805 --> 01:47:31,105
I'd like that, Joe,
but I don't think I can get away.

1671
01:47:33,006 --> 01:47:37,706
Oh, well, we'll bump
into each other from time to time.

1672
01:47:39,107 --> 01:47:41,107
Anyway, when your pictures
start coming out

1673
01:47:41,108 --> 01:47:42,700
I can get to see you
whenever I want to.

1674
01:47:42,701 --> 01:47:45,900
All I got to do is have the price
of a ticket to the matinees.

1675
01:47:52,301 --> 01:47:54,301
Don't drink anymore, Joe.

1676
01:47:55,502 --> 01:47:58,402
Get a good day's sleep, huh?
And eat some breakfast.

1677
01:48:00,803 --> 01:48:01,903
Bye.

1678
01:48:11,004 --> 01:48:13,204
Seems I came in here for something.

1679
01:48:32,405 --> 01:48:35,305
Joe, got the opening
for the Las Vegas show.

1680
01:48:35,306 --> 01:48:38,106
After only two weeks?
Congratulations.

1681
01:48:38,107 --> 01:48:39,607
Fifty dollars.

1682
01:48:49,708 --> 01:48:51,770
- Hello, Martha.
- Just in time, Martha.

1683
01:48:51,771 --> 01:48:54,171
Hi, honey,
how's my big movie star?

1684
01:48:55,772 --> 01:48:59,272
Joe, I left you a note this morning.
I said I'd be home early.

1685
01:48:59,273 --> 01:49:00,600
Didn't you even read it?

1686
01:49:00,601 --> 01:49:02,350
Yeah, I did, honey,
but when you were a little late

1687
01:49:02,351 --> 01:49:04,251
I figured I'd have the boys come up
for a few laughs.

1688
01:49:04,252 --> 01:49:05,252
Well, what happened was...

1689
01:49:05,253 --> 01:49:06,800
Joe, do you want to hear
the Belmont results?

1690
01:49:06,801 --> 01:49:08,501
Yeah, turn it up.
Hold it, Freddie.

1691
01:49:08,502 --> 01:49:09,502
- Joe...
- Shh.

1692
01:49:09,503 --> 01:49:11,999
- Eight sixty, five forty and three twenty.
Why don't you sit down?

1693
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,900
Second Purvey, sixteen eighty
and twelve sixty.

1694
01:49:14,901 --> 01:49:16,801
Third Beavis, three twenty.

1695
01:49:20,502 --> 01:49:22,900
Okay, Sleeping Beauty!
Up!

1696
01:49:23,301 --> 01:49:25,101
- Come on, come on!
- Huh?

1697
01:49:25,102 --> 01:49:29,300
Oh, Martha, I lay down I guess
I must have slipped right off.

1698
01:49:29,301 --> 01:49:30,600
You know, it's a nice comfortable bed.

1699
01:49:30,601 --> 01:49:31,750
Thanks for the testimonial,

1700
01:49:31,751 --> 01:49:33,851
but next time I want
a bed tester, I'll call you.

1701
01:49:33,852 --> 01:49:37,052
- You'll be getting the best.
- Will you please go.

1702
01:49:37,053 --> 01:49:40,253
Sure, okay, excuse me.

1703
01:49:50,854 --> 01:49:52,854
What are you doing here?

1704
01:49:52,855 --> 01:49:54,550
Hello, lady, am I in the way?

1705
01:49:54,551 --> 01:49:57,051
Oh, no,
what ever gave you that idea?

1706
01:49:57,052 --> 01:49:58,452
We'll shave together.

1707
01:49:58,853 --> 01:50:01,353
Come on, get out of my bathroom.

1708
01:50:01,354 --> 01:50:03,900
I got all this lather on my face,
What'll I do?

1709
01:50:03,901 --> 01:50:07,250
Sing Jingle Bells.
Come on, get out, Santa!

1710
01:50:07,251 --> 01:50:10,551
All right, okay, okay, okay,
sweetie pie.

1711
01:50:12,552 --> 01:50:15,000
Oh, I want all of you to get out!

1712
01:50:15,401 --> 01:50:18,501
This isn't a bar or a gambling casino,
it's my home.

1713
01:50:18,502 --> 01:50:21,402
It's not a horse room.
It's my home.

1714
01:50:22,803 --> 01:50:25,403
Baby, what's a home
without a horse room?

1715
01:50:26,204 --> 01:50:28,204
- Relax.
- Relax?

1716
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:31,505
Will you please tell me how to relax
to standing room only.

1717
01:50:31,506 --> 01:50:35,406
If I wanted to take a nap,
I'd have to do it standing up!

1718
01:50:35,407 --> 01:50:38,107
What are we doing here, Joe,
selling tickets?

1719
01:50:38,108 --> 01:50:42,608
I would like a little privacy
in my own home with my own husband.

1720
01:50:42,609 --> 01:50:47,309
I'm not asking for a lot.
Now get out, all of you.

1721
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:49,600
- She's right, Joe...
- No, hold it, hold it.

1722
01:50:51,301 --> 01:50:53,701
baby, these people are my friends
and they're not leaving.

1723
01:50:53,702 --> 01:50:57,502
If they're so near and dear to you
that you can't bear to be without them,

1724
01:50:57,503 --> 01:50:59,503
why don't you go with them?

1725
01:50:59,504 --> 01:51:01,504
Come on, let's go.

1726
01:51:07,505 --> 01:51:09,905
I'll just get to Vegas
a few days earlier.

1727
01:51:09,906 --> 01:51:12,006
Swifty can pick up
the rest of my things.

1728
01:51:12,007 --> 01:51:14,707
Don't you want custody
of the poker chips, too?

1729
01:51:15,808 --> 01:51:17,550
I thought we were having
a family argument,

1730
01:51:17,551 --> 01:51:19,100
not a property settlement.

1731
01:51:46,801 --> 01:51:49,600
Which is Mr. Lewis's suite, please?
I'm his wife.

1732
01:51:49,601 --> 01:51:53,601
Oh, yes, Mrs. Lewis. 204.
But try the crap table on the left.

1733
01:51:56,602 --> 01:51:57,700
Thank you.

1734
01:52:04,201 --> 01:52:05,700
Hello, Joe.

1735
01:52:06,001 --> 01:52:08,201
- Hiya, baby.
- Hi, Martha.

1736
01:52:08,202 --> 01:52:09,602
What are you doing
here in Vegas?

1737
01:52:09,603 --> 01:52:11,700
Just came up to see my husband.

1738
01:52:11,701 --> 01:52:13,401
Maybe you brought me some luck.

1739
01:52:13,402 --> 01:52:16,102
- How you been?
- All right.

1740
01:52:17,703 --> 01:52:19,603
I'm sorry about the argument, Joe.

1741
01:52:19,604 --> 01:52:21,000
Oh, forget it.

1742
01:52:21,501 --> 01:52:23,801
Two aces, crap.

1743
01:52:24,002 --> 01:52:26,402
We're not doing so good,
are we, Joe?

1744
01:52:26,903 --> 01:52:28,603
Sure we are, baby.

1745
01:52:29,504 --> 01:52:33,504
We have a fight, we have a reconciliation,
it's better than breaking even.

1746
01:52:34,105 --> 01:52:36,405
And anyway, now that you're here
in Las Vegas

1747
01:52:36,406 --> 01:52:38,900
it's a wonderful place to have
our long postponed honeymoon.

1748
01:52:41,101 --> 01:52:42,701
I'd love that, Joe.

1749
01:52:42,702 --> 01:52:45,400
Only I have to be back
at the studio tomorrow.

1750
01:52:49,001 --> 01:52:51,901
I read somewhere
that the picture was finished.

1751
01:52:51,902 --> 01:52:55,202
This is a new one.
It's in Technicolor.

1752
01:52:57,603 --> 01:52:58,703
Oh.

1753
01:52:59,004 --> 01:53:01,304
It'll be finished in eight weeks.

1754
01:53:01,305 --> 01:53:05,700
Seven.
Joe, it's your dice now.

1755
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,850
Joe, maybe we could go
someplace quiet

1756
01:53:07,851 --> 01:53:09,500
and talk for a little while, huh?

1757
01:53:09,501 --> 01:53:11,001
Yeah, it's a good idea, honey.

1758
01:53:11,002 --> 01:53:13,502
Look, you go to the bar.
I'll be there in about ten minutes.

1759
01:53:13,503 --> 01:53:15,900
Swifty, take Martha over
and buy her a drink.

1760
01:53:15,901 --> 01:53:18,001
- Come on, Martha.
- Thanks.

1761
01:53:18,002 --> 01:53:20,602
- Coming up. Hands up there, Buddy.
- I can buy my own drink,

1762
01:53:24,003 --> 01:53:25,603
- Martha!
- Hey!

1763
01:53:25,604 --> 01:53:28,400
Hi, honey, it's always wonderful
to see you.

1764
01:53:28,401 --> 01:53:30,100
- Come on, sit down.
- Did you see Joe?

1765
01:53:29,451 --> 01:53:32,800
Yeah. And for a minute
I thought he saw me.

1766
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:34,153
What'll you have, folks?

1767
01:53:35,154 --> 01:53:37,454
- I'll take them all.
- You're kidding.

1768
01:53:37,555 --> 01:53:38,800
Oh no, I'm not.

1769
01:53:38,801 --> 01:53:41,701
I want to find out what's in that stuff
that's more fun than a wife.

1770
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:43,702
- Keep the change, honey.
- Thank you.

1771
01:53:48,903 --> 01:53:51,103
Look, Martha, that's not
going to do any good.

1772
01:53:57,004 --> 01:53:58,004
Uh... excuse me.

1773
01:54:04,005 --> 01:54:06,805
- Eight wins.
- Joe, Joe...

1774
01:54:06,806 --> 01:54:08,500
Martha's pretty upset.

1775
01:54:08,501 --> 01:54:11,350
I ain't exactly relaxed.
I'm stuck $20.000.

1776
01:54:11,351 --> 01:54:13,581
Joe, the crap table
will be here tomorrow.

1777
01:54:13,582 --> 01:54:15,782
Come on, talk to her now.
You've got a performance...

1778
01:54:15,783 --> 01:54:17,983
Give me a break, Austin.
I'll be there, I tell you.

1779
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,484
I'll be right there.

1780
01:54:20,685 --> 01:54:22,885
Go on... ten.

1781
01:54:24,886 --> 01:54:27,900
Please, Martha, that's not
going to prove anything.

1782
01:54:27,901 --> 01:54:30,301
It's gonna prove
I'm the wife of Joe E. Lewis.

1783
01:54:31,402 --> 01:54:34,000
No... don't tell me, I know.

1784
01:54:34,901 --> 01:54:37,401
He's too busy to talk to me now.

1785
01:54:38,802 --> 01:54:41,302
He's being held over
at the crap table.

1786
01:54:45,503 --> 01:54:47,503
Who am I kidding?

1787
01:54:49,004 --> 01:54:51,004
It's been my fault
from the very beginning

1788
01:54:51,005 --> 01:54:53,205
for getting our marriage
off to such a...

1789
01:54:53,706 --> 01:54:55,506
nothing start.

1790
01:55:01,207 --> 01:55:02,607
Prost time.

1791
01:55:04,708 --> 01:55:06,708
What's the matter?
Nobody laughing?

1792
01:55:10,909 --> 01:55:13,709
Everybody laughs when Joe does it.

1793
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:37,010
Remember me?

1794
01:55:37,311 --> 01:55:39,411
I said I'd be right there.

1795
01:55:40,612 --> 01:55:41,712
Joe...

1796
01:55:42,213 --> 01:55:45,213
Can't you stop for just
a few minutes and talk to me?

1797
01:55:45,214 --> 01:55:49,314
Honey, don't shield for the place.
I'm stuck twenty-five gees.

1798
01:55:49,815 --> 01:55:52,115
I guess that tells me.

1799
01:55:52,616 --> 01:55:53,900
Tells you what?

1800
01:55:53,901 --> 01:55:56,701
I know you don't care that
about money.

1801
01:55:56,702 --> 01:55:59,702
So now I know you care
less than that about us.

1802
01:55:59,703 --> 01:56:00,900
Loser seven.

1803
01:56:04,501 --> 01:56:07,950
Look, baby... Swifty, take her
to the suite, will you?

1804
01:56:07,951 --> 01:56:08,951
Come on, Martha...

1805
01:56:08,952 --> 01:56:11,152
I'm not going
to any suite with you!

1806
01:56:11,153 --> 01:56:12,953
You're not my husband.

1807
01:56:12,954 --> 01:56:14,954
He's my husband.

1808
01:56:14,955 --> 01:56:16,655
You, mister.

1809
01:56:16,656 --> 01:56:19,156
You, you're the one
I'm talking about.

1810
01:56:19,157 --> 01:56:22,757
You're gonna stop right now
and listen to what I've got to say.

1811
01:56:24,758 --> 01:56:26,758
All right, I'm listening.
What have you got to say.

1812
01:56:30,009 --> 01:56:31,459
Good-bye, I guess.

1813
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:33,860
That's what I want to say.

1814
01:56:34,261 --> 01:56:35,761
Just good-bye.

1815
01:56:35,762 --> 01:56:39,162
- Martha, baby...
- You can't trust me anymore.

1816
01:56:39,163 --> 01:56:42,963
I'm the girl who was
almost married to you, remember?

1817
01:56:42,964 --> 01:56:43,964
Martha...

1818
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:47,765
I know I haven't been
much of a wife.

1819
01:56:48,566 --> 01:56:49,999
But you?

1820
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
You know who you
should have married?

1821
01:56:52,167 --> 01:56:53,867
Seabiscuit!

1822
01:56:53,868 --> 01:56:56,298
Seabiscuit with a bartender
on his back,

1823
01:56:56,299 --> 01:56:58,899
that's a perfect mate for you.

1824
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:03,999
Joe.

1825
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,350
Let's get a divorce so we can go back

1826
01:57:06,351 --> 01:57:08,851
to liking each other
the way we used to?

1827
01:57:10,752 --> 01:57:13,552
We've got to get a divorce,
Joe, because...

1828
01:57:13,553 --> 01:57:14,553
darling...

1829
01:57:16,454 --> 01:57:19,999
I'm still so crazy about you
I can't see straight.

1830
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:24,000
Joe...

1831
01:57:28,401 --> 01:57:30,601
Eight to five
she doesn't make it to the door.

1832
01:57:34,002 --> 01:57:36,000
Joe, Joe, Joe!

1833
01:57:41,101 --> 01:57:42,500
Cassie went after her.

1834
01:57:43,001 --> 01:57:44,900
Do you want to skip the performance?

1835
01:57:46,001 --> 01:57:47,999
What would I do instead?

1836
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:47,800
I'm sorry, Joe. I wish there was
something I could do.

1837
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:50,701
You could get me her stomach.

1838
01:59:01,702 --> 01:59:03,502
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen,

1839
01:59:03,503 --> 01:59:05,900
and to those of you
who have seen me before,

1840
01:59:05,901 --> 01:59:07,101
I say welcome.

1841
01:59:07,502 --> 01:59:09,502
And to those of you
who have never seen me,

1842
01:59:09,999 --> 01:59:11,700
I say, cowards.

1843
01:59:13,601 --> 01:59:15,000
Prost time.

1844
01:59:18,001 --> 01:59:20,301
I'm very glad to be back,
ladies and gentlemen,

1845
01:59:20,302 --> 01:59:23,502
but I only come to Las Vegas
for sentimental reasons.

1846
01:59:23,503 --> 01:59:25,203
I come to visit my money.

1847
01:59:26,804 --> 01:59:30,704
And Las Vegas is the only place
I know where money really talks.

1848
01:59:30,999 --> 01:59:32,800
It says good-bye.

1849
01:59:34,701 --> 01:59:37,600
That's a good idea.
Why don't you say good-bye, too?

1850
01:59:40,301 --> 01:59:42,701
Of all the open manholes
in this town,

1851
01:59:42,702 --> 01:59:45,602
my luck he had to fall in this one.

1852
01:59:47,703 --> 01:59:49,303
Mr. Mack,

1853
01:59:49,304 --> 01:59:51,304
ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Austin Mack,

1854
01:59:51,305 --> 01:59:52,605
my accompanist,

1855
01:59:52,806 --> 01:59:53,806
uh...

1856
01:59:54,307 --> 01:59:55,607
thank you...

1857
01:59:56,708 --> 02:00:00,400
Recently Mr. Mack has had
many offers to leave me, and I know...

1858
02:00:00,401 --> 02:00:02,201
because I made most of them.

1859
02:00:03,002 --> 02:00:05,502
Get off, Lewis, you're holding up
the entertainment.

1860
02:00:07,703 --> 02:00:09,850
Don't look now, pal,
but the war is over

1861
02:00:09,851 --> 02:00:11,851
you can get new parts
for your head.

1862
02:00:14,152 --> 02:00:15,600
That's a good joke,
where did you get that,

1863
02:00:15,601 --> 02:00:17,000
in a cut-rate store.

1864
02:00:18,301 --> 02:00:19,601
Ladies and gentlemen,

1865
02:00:19,602 --> 02:00:21,502
don't let him bother you,
don't pay too much attention,

1866
02:00:21,503 --> 02:00:23,103
because in a little while
he'll be leaving

1867
02:00:23,104 --> 02:00:25,104
soon as they clean up his cage.

1868
02:00:27,705 --> 02:00:30,405
Funny, funny, this guy's funny.

1869
02:00:31,606 --> 02:00:34,450
No hard feelings, pal,
no hard feelings.

1870
02:00:34,451 --> 02:00:36,150
Just meet me at the pool
tomorrow morning

1871
02:00:36,151 --> 02:00:37,851
and I'll give you a lesson
in drowning.

1872
02:00:39,052 --> 02:00:41,752
I hear you and your wife
give drunk lessons, too.

1873
02:01:06,153 --> 02:01:07,553
Are you all right?

1874
02:01:08,554 --> 02:01:10,154
- Hm?
- Yes.

1875
02:01:30,355 --> 02:01:32,655
All right, Cassie,
get it off your chest.

1876
02:01:32,656 --> 02:01:33,856
All of it.

1877
02:01:33,857 --> 02:01:37,157
All the things you've wanted to say
all these years.

1878
02:01:42,358 --> 02:01:45,199
You'd better get yourself
another piano player, Joe.

1879
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:44,400
# When somebody loves you #

1880
02:02:44,401 --> 02:02:47,901
# It's no good unless he loves you #

1881
02:02:49,002 --> 02:02:53,602
# All the way. #

1882
02:02:54,103 --> 02:02:57,103
# Happy to be near you #

1883
02:02:57,104 --> 02:03:00,999
# When you need someone to cheer you #

1884
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:05,800
# All the way. #

1885
02:03:05,801 --> 02:03:07,401
Aw, shut up.

1886
02:03:14,102 --> 02:03:16,002
Your cocktail, Mr. Lewis.

1887
02:03:16,003 --> 02:03:17,603
Do you want me to shake it?

1888
02:03:18,304 --> 02:03:19,804
Just a little?

1889
02:03:31,205 --> 02:03:32,805
Ladies and gentlemen,

1890
02:03:33,606 --> 02:03:35,806
a girl with a hole in her head.

1891
02:03:35,807 --> 02:03:38,007
What a wonderful girl.

1892
02:04:05,708 --> 02:04:08,400
You didn't have to give Cassie
that fancy present.

1893
02:04:08,401 --> 02:04:10,201
She's not sore anymore.

1894
02:04:11,002 --> 02:04:12,802
See you at the opening.

1895
02:04:19,503 --> 02:04:20,703
Hey.

1896
02:04:22,404 --> 02:04:24,999
You thinking of taking a few belts
before you go on?

1897
02:04:25,305 --> 02:04:28,405
Yeah, I'm always thinking about having
a few belts before I go on.

1898
02:04:29,106 --> 02:04:31,900
Three months in the hospital
wasn't enough punishment, huh?

1899
02:04:31,901 --> 02:04:34,101
You want to play a return engagement.

1900
02:04:35,202 --> 02:04:37,602
Who are you, an advance man
for Alcoholics Anonymous?

1901
02:04:38,203 --> 02:04:40,403
I just don't like hospitals.

1902
02:04:40,904 --> 02:04:41,804
So?

1903
02:04:41,805 --> 02:04:44,205
So, so face up to it.

1904
02:04:44,206 --> 02:04:46,700
Liquor won't change
what happened with Letty.

1905
02:04:46,701 --> 02:04:47,901
Or with Martha.

1906
02:04:47,902 --> 02:04:50,602
And it won't bring back your voice,

1907
02:04:50,603 --> 02:04:54,903
And speaking of the voice,
Caruso you would never have been.

1908
02:04:54,904 --> 02:04:57,704
You know,
you'd make a perfect stranger.

1909
02:05:00,505 --> 02:05:01,505
Hey.

1910
02:05:03,306 --> 02:05:05,806
This is one heckle you're not
gonna lose too easily.

1911
02:05:06,307 --> 02:05:08,100
Why don't you face up to it?

1912
02:05:08,101 --> 02:05:10,401
All you can get out of a bottle
is a phony dream.

1913
02:05:10,402 --> 02:05:12,002
Yeah, sure.

1914
02:05:12,003 --> 02:05:13,800
What do you got to offer?

1915
02:05:13,801 --> 02:05:15,401
Everything you already have.

1916
02:05:15,402 --> 02:05:17,502
Life's pretty good, you know.

1917
02:05:17,503 --> 02:05:20,003
You entertain people,
you make them laugh.

1918
02:05:20,004 --> 02:05:21,804
It's what you really want.

1919
02:05:24,405 --> 02:05:26,805
Pssst.
Hey, funny man.

1920
02:05:27,306 --> 02:05:29,000
You make everybody else laugh.

1921
02:05:29,001 --> 02:05:30,801
How about making me laugh
for a change?

1922
02:05:36,302 --> 02:05:37,702
I'll try.

1923
02:05:39,003 --> 02:05:40,503
I'll really try.

1924
02:05:55,504 --> 02:06:05,000
