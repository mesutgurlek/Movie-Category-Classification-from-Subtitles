1
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,524
Fresh fish here, caught this morning!
It's a bargain!

2
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,865
Look what I've got to show you here.
I have 12 wonderful plates for one shilling.

3
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,997
Here's a bargain you'll not see
in this market for years to come.

4
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,041
The late Lord Marsbury wore this.

5
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,732
Farthing. Thank you, Miss.

6
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,568
Sir, join the army? Queen's shilling.

7
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,576
Matches! Spare a farthing!

8
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,624
Lady, give us a farthing!

9
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,489
Just a farthing for the baby!

10
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,100
Fresh rabbits, caught today!
Come along, now!

11
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:35,578
- Here we are, some lovely Yorkshire hams!
- Lovely pies!

12
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,608
Pies!

13
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,882
York pies!

14
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,782
Hot pies!

15
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,720
Come on, now! Get your pies!

16
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,993
Ha'penny a pie!

17
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,636
I repeat, for the first time,
you have your last chance to see...

18
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,337
...Madame Doasyouwouldbedoneby
in her greatest role...

19
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,573
...the head of an Indian princess.

20
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,708
Just the head! A living head!
Not the body, just the head!

21
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,448
A miracle of our time! Roll up!
Only a penny a ticket!

22
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,014
A penny a ticket! Roll up!

23
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:58,029
For the first time in your fair city
see Madame Doasyouwouldbedoneby...

24
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,068
Come on now. Keep moving.

25
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,538
Only a face. Move on.

26
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,570
No body.

27
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,170
- Come on, sir. Keep moving.
- Fantastic.

28
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:19,446
Sensational. Move on, laddie. Move on.
Come on, keep moving.

29
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,519
Go on, son. Keep moving.

30
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,824
Keep moving.

31
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,426
Come on now. Keep moving.

32
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,932
Keep moving.

33
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,194
Only a head.

34
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,333
Move on, move on!

35
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,501
Roll up! Roll up!
For the first time in your fair city!

36
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,071
I repeat, for the first time,
you have your last chance to see...

37
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,880
...Madame Doasyouwouldbedoneby
in her greatest role...

38
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,217
...the head of an Indian princess.

39
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,718
Where hast you been, Thomas?

40
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,191
Where hast you been?

41
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,297
Hast ever seen such an ungrateful wretch
as this, Mr. Masterman?

42
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,394
Can't say as I ever had wished to,
Mr. Grimes.

43
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,804
What happens to apprentices
what dodge their masters, Damiel?

44
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,672
They're flogged
and deported to Botany Bay.

45
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,413
Is our young cockney whelp aware of that?

46
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,986
- Work, is it, Mr. Grimes?
- Aye, work, very important work.

47
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,648
We have an appointment at Harthover Hall.

48
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,685
High cockalorum?

49
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,657
Very high cockalorum!

50
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,154
Come on, Wilfred.

51
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,663
Harthover Hall?

52
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,063
- High cockalorum, indeed!
- Indeed!

53
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,125
Get your pies! York pies!

54
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,434
Pies! York pies!

55
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,873
Lovely pies!

56
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,167
Ha'penny a pie!

57
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,343
York pies!

58
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,556
Foolish.

59
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,323
It's dangerous, Damiel.

60
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,052
Yes, but do you want to be
a chimney sweep...

61
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,064
...all your life, Mr. Grimes?

62
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,795
Or a toff with a coach and four
and a pack of servants?

63
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,705
Or a snapped neck if they catch us.

64
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,837
You know what they say
about Harthover Hall, Mr. Grimes?

65
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,247
What do they say about Harthover?

66
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,153
Speak up, lad, or I'll knock thy eyes out.

67
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,484
They say it's got more chimneys...

68
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,356
...than I've had clouts across me ear,
old Mr. Grimes.

69
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,819
And here's another one.

70
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,261
Stay down there till I tell thee!

71
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,027
Here.

72
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,970
Have a good swig of that, and get to sleep.

73
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,803
It's a long day tomorrow.

74
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,215
If this works tomorrow...

75
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,707
...we're made men.

76
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,953
Made men!

77
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,902
Good night, boy.

78
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,534
5:00 in the cold, wet morning!

79
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,806
It's time you were up, Mrs. Crodgely.

80
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,481
5:00 in the cold, wet morning.

81
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,272
Come on. Good boy.

82
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,008
Where's this then, Mr. Grimes?

83
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,178
"Where's this then?"

84
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,512
China.

85
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:50,517
Where dost thou think?
Yorkshire. Can't thou see it's Yorkshire?

86
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,990
I know it's Yorkshire, Mr. Grimes.

87
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,126
Well, then...

88
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,560
I've never seen it clean before.

89
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,102
We're in the country.

90
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,230
Is that what they call it?
Lovely, isn't it, Mr. Grimes?

91
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,910
- I shall retire here.
- Shut up.

92
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,976
Walk on, Wilfred.

93
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,748
Come on, you, take this dog!

94
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,220
Get a hold of this.

95
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,659
And keep up!

96
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:48,902
Get!

97
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,107
Come on, Wilfred.

98
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,704
There you are.

99
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,377
Harthover Hall.

100
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,394
I shall retire there instead.

101
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,465
Don't be daft.

102
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,567
Young Thomas,
that enough chimneys for thee?

103
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,773
I shan't be through sweeping those
before Christmas, Mr. Grimes.

104
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,349
Wilfred, come.

105
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,017
Next year.

106
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,623
This ain't no burial ground.

107
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,556
What's your business?

108
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,791
What's our business?

109
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,773
We've come to clean chimneys.
What's it look like?

110
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,809
I thought you was the undertaker,
going to bury him.

111
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,368
He is dead, isn't he? Walking dead?

112
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,613
And see you don't come out
with more than you went in with!

113
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,243
What does he mean?

114
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,652
We've got no time for poachers.

115
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,289
Poaching? Perish the thought!

116
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,850
A nasty suggestion,
killing poor, dumb beasts.

117
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,793
It's nasty, very nasty.

118
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,726
And just remember...

119
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,760
...Squire Harthover
is the Justice of the Peace.

120
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,030
And it's the gallows in these parts...

121
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,232
...for fellows that take things
that don't belong to them.

122
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,841
So think on.

123
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,977
We'll do that. We'll think on.

124
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,845
Come on. Come on, Wilfred.

125
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,589
Not front.

126
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,485
Around back.

127
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,413
What a disgusting,
filthy disgrace to humanity you are.

128
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,824
I'm Grimes, missis.

129
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,556
You're drunk, sir.

130
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,160
Nevertheless, I'm Grimes.

131
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,939
Now, does thou want
the chimneys swept...

132
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,171
...or does thou not want
the chimneys swept?

133
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,135
Ta.

134
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,878
Come in.

135
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,383
You can leave that thing outside
for a start.

136
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,422
Hurry up, quick. Here.

137
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,089
Mr. Grimes, baskets and bags.

138
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,466
Now then, listen to me, all of you.

139
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,494
I've just sheeted all the rooms
where there's chimneys to be swept.

140
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,098
You brought plenty of soot bags, I see.

141
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,735
- Aye.
- Use them!

142
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,275
Because I warn you...

143
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,544
...one speck of soot
in any of those rooms...

144
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,015
...and not a penny piece
will you get from me.

145
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,452
Yes, ma'am.

146
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:27,053
- Missis.
- Come on, get on with it then!

147
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,721
I'll wait outside, Mr. Grimes,
to collect the soot bags.

148
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:32,889
Right.

149
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,004
Mr. Grimes...

150
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,011
Come on.

151
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,746
No dust covers.

152
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,663
Come on.

153
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,744
Take the brush.

154
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,679
On the way and earn the keep.

155
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,747
It's dark up here, Mr. Grimes.

156
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,485
Get up there!

157
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,993
Else I'll light a fire and burn the bum.

158
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,619
No, Mr. Grimes!

159
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,596
Please, no. Not me bum.

160
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,344
Upsy-daisy, Thomas, lad.

161
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,582
It's wonderful what a bit of kindness
will do for them young wretches.

162
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,689
It's dark. I can't see a blooming thing.

163
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,779
Shut up!

164
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,125
Keep going, lad.

165
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,845
Cor blimey!

166
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,924
Me brush! Where's me brush?

167
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,460
I'll get a clout if I can't find me brush.

168
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,938
- Thomas?
- Yeah?

169
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,600
- Come on, lad, down this way!
- What way, Mr. Grimes?

170
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,336
This way!

171
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,543
- This way, and sharp about it!
- Right-o, Mr. Grimes!

172
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,121
Hurry up, lad!

173
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,967
Coming, Mr. Grimes.

174
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,335
Thomas, what are thou up to?

175
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:43,380
I can't find me way, Mr. Grimes!
What way should I go?

176
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,313
I'm lost!

177
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,321
I've lost meself!

178
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,791
Then find thyself, and quick about it!

179
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,572
Cor!

180
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,948
Who are you?

181
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,683
Blimey!

182
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,552
Who are you, boy?

183
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,318
Don't shout, please.

184
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,415
I'm not.

185
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,757
I'm only a chimney sweep,
come down the chimney. See?

186
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,761
I lost me way.

187
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,163
You've come down the chimney, boy?

188
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,359
Yeah.

189
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,767
But how terrible for you.
Aren't you frightened, being in the dark?

190
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,372
Sometimes,
but I'm more frightened of Mr. Grimes.

191
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,268
- Mr. Grimes?
- He clouts me.

192
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,569
- Clouts you?
- Hits me regular, across the earhole.

193
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,445
- Why don't you tell your parents?
- Me what?

194
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,143
Your mother and father.

195
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,812
I ain't got no mum or dad. Never did.

196
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,618
Grimes said I was hatched out
in the London gutter by the sun.

197
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,993
You got a mum or dad?

198
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,326
No.

199
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,098
They died in Vienna last year on holiday.

200
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,325
Not much of a holiday?

201
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,363
Sorry.

202
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,731
You've got no mum or dad, like me.

203
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,267
Same sort of difference.
Who looks after you, then?

204
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,746
My uncle and aunt.
Sir John and Lady Harriet.

205
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,782
Blimey. Royalty!

206
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,213
This is their house.

207
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,046
Must be worth a few bob.

208
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:07,454
Paradise, this is. My idea of paradise.

209
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,256
What did they do that to him for?

210
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,994
- Who is he?
- Jesus.

211
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,095
- Who?
- God.

212
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,237
He's got the right room for it, hasn't he?
Paradise.

213
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,042
What's your name, boy?

214
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,572
Thomas.
Thomas Aquinas something-or-other.

215
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:33,982
"Something-or-other"?

216
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:37,078
You don't get no last name
if you ain't got no mum or dad.

217
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,282
It's the rules. I'm just Tom.

218
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,459
- Who are you?
- I'm Ellie.

219
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,589
Ellie? That's a very pretty name, miss.

220
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,798
Highly classy.

221
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,295
But it would be, living here.

222
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,407
You couldn't be a Gertie or a Ruby,
could you, living here?

223
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,437
- What was that?
- I don't know.

224
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,709
But you see,
noise is not allowed in this house.

225
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,917
Tom!

226
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,923
Be careful.

227
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,955
Mr. Grimes! What you doing?

228
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,294
Thieving?

229
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,490
Ellie?

230
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,696
Ellie! Are you all right?

231
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,666
What's going on there?
What's all that noise?

232
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,644
Are you all right, Ellie?

233
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,512
Miss Ellie!

234
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,781
Why, the young thief!

235
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,450
What do you mean, Mr. Grimes?

236
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,321
- The boy's a thief!
- I'm not!

237
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,794
- No, he's not!
- Ellie...

238
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,330
- But he isn't!
- That's enough.

239
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,423
I'll have him hanged for thee.

240
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,279
Stop, thief!

241
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,823
- Will you come back here?
- Nobody ever listens to me!

242
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,689
I've something very important to tell you!

243
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:31,928
Toby!

244
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,346
Sir John! Lady Harriet!

245
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,610
Let me go! You can't push me around!

246
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,752
Let me go!
I have to tell you! Leave me alone!

247
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,414
Ellie, be quiet, child.
What is it, Mrs. Tripp?

248
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:52,955
What is it, Mrs. Tripp?

249
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,649
Hang fire, dear heart, I've just asked that.

250
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:58,723
So have I, dear. I have a right to know.

251
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,824
What is it, Mrs. Tripp?

252
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,163
A thief, milady.
Pinched all the silver, milady.

253
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,999
Pinched the silver?

254
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,202
Really? What's "pinched," dear?

255
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,942
Purloined, my love.

256
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,677
Somebody's stolen the silver!

257
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:19,042
God save the mark. Call the justice, John.

258
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,447
Call the justice!

259
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,110
I am the justice, dear.

260
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,955
Are you really, dear?
No one tells me anything.

261
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,486
Morning.

262
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,750
Stop, thief!

263
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,587
Stop, thief!

264
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,866
Stop, thief.
Someone has pinched me silver.

265
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,162
Stop, thief!

266
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:42,129
It wasn't the boy. It wasn't Tom.
It wasn't him. He isn't a thief.

267
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,937
It was the old man Mr. Grimes!
It wasn't him!

268
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,408
Stop, thief!

269
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,373
Masterman?

270
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:51,942
Yes, Mr. Grimes?

271
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,452
Find that boy, Mr. Masterman.

272
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,215
He's been stealing off Sir John's property.

273
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,448
Quick as you like, Mr. Grimes.

274
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,820
Stop, thief!

275
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,273
Who in particular are we looking for?

276
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,642
Mr. Masterman, please, shut up.

277
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,317
A boy, sir.

278
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,085
A wicked boy.

279
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,315
Indeed? A boy?

280
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,222
There was a lad, minutes ago,
running across the fields.

281
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,385
It were your lad. I saw him.

282
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,127
He shan't escape.

283
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,596
I shall find him
and make an example of him.

284
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:44,101
We'll hunt the young scoundrel,
if necessary, across all Yorkshire!

285
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,295
To horse!

286
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,470
Me lip! Mr. Grimes!

287
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,324
Stop, thief!

288
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,697
Come on, Wilfred boy.

289
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,735
Come on! That's right.

290
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,641
Come on, Mr. Grimes!

291
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,050
They went back the other way. Get up.

292
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,229
Blasted boots! I'll tell Uncle John.

293
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,425
He'll listen to me. It wasn't Tom.

294
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,134
Ellie, come back here this minute!
Come back here, I say!

295
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,606
Run, boy. Run!

296
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,609
<i>Run, boy, run!</i>

297
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,659
It's me war wound.

298
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,064
Get up.

299
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,863
Wilfred's giving out.

300
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,915
I hope that nag throws her
and breaks her neck.

301
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,251
How did she cross you, Mr. Grimes?

302
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,147
She saw me throw the swag to Thomas.

303
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:59,353
Here. If she can convince Squire,
it'll be... for me.

304
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,163
We best get going, then!

305
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,733
I don't mind looking like a corpse,
but I don't want to die like one.

306
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,134
Come on, Wilfred. Come on, lad.

307
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,299
Up you get, Joshua. Come on.

308
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,036
Come on now, Wilfred.

309
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,907
Go on, Wilfred, lad.

310
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,004
Come on.

311
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,642
Giddy up.

312
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,047
Mr. Grimes...

313
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,613
...who is he?

314
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,418
Ignore him.

315
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,900
There, sir. There he is.

316
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,804
There he is, sir.

317
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,269
Come back, lad!

318
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,614
Come back! You'll fall!

319
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,671
By George!

320
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,437
He may be a thief,
but he's a plucky little beggar.

321
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,221
Uncle John!

322
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,519
I've something very important
I must tell you!

323
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,889
It wasn't Tom! It was the sweep!

324
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,726
- What?
- The sweep, Mr. Grimes!

325
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,128
Good Lord!

326
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,726
If he slips, he'll kill himself.

327
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,668
He's like a frightened little rabbit.
We mustn't scare him.

328
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,766
No, Sir John. Don't try it.
It's too dangerous. Follow me.

329
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,398
I know a better way down.

330
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,538
Don't try and jump, lad.

331
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,042
It's not called Dead Man's Pool for nothing.

332
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,342
You jump in there, son,
and you won't come up.

333
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,813
Steady, now.

334
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,348
We can't save you if you fall.

335
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,490
He's right, my dear boy.
Now, you listen to me very carefully.

336
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,925
No harm will come to you, I promise.

337
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,287
But, for goodness' sake, stay still!

338
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,195
Stay perfectly still!

339
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,030
Tom! They know it wasn't you.

340
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,478
Tom!

341
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,918
Tom, don't!

342
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,260
<i>Jesus.</i>

343
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,256
<i>I've killed the child.</i>

344
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,797
<i>Tom.</i>

345
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,520
I've gone all clean.

346
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,051
Here, Toby! Look, I'm clean!

347
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,294
I thought you were a goner.

348
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,929
You know what?

349
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:38,466
I've got a funny feeling we're underwater!

350
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,044
What's going on here?

351
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,841
Having trouble, Mister?

352
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,575
What's it look like?

353
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,881
What exactly are you trying to do?

354
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,079
Can't you see? Swim!

355
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,846
- Get off!
- What is he?

356
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,653
What sort of fish are you?

357
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,393
What are you?

358
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,027
I'm Tom.

359
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:09,629
- Tom? But what's a Tom, then?
- A boy, that's what!

360
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,195
- A human!
- And what might that be?

361
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,899
Just the highest form of animal life,
that's all.

362
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,237
It doesn't look much like it
from where I'm floating.

363
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,506
Know his trouble?
He doesn't know how to swim!

364
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,810
Doesn't know how to swim?

365
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,346
Isn't my fault.

366
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,877
- Things as don't swim...
- Got no right to be here.

367
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,184
No!

368
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,416
Why don't you go back
where you came from?

369
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,955
Blimey, I wish I could,
but I don't know how, do I?

370
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,892
Why don't you leave me alone?

371
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,729
Go on! Swing your hook.

372
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,201
Now, no need for that kind of language.

373
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:51,208
In underwater society, young creature,
we try to avoid words like "hook."

374
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,834
Particularly amongst mixed company.

375
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,243
- Lady wife.
- Thank you, dear.

376
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,338
Sorry, missis.

377
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,747
Now, do I understand
you've never swum before?

378
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:03,753
- I've never had a bath before!
- Quite. Don't look so miserable about it.

379
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,116
All it takes is a little perseverance.

380
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,090
I have... What's it, missis.

381
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,183
Look.

382
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,421
- Whoops! There you go.
- I just sink!

383
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,392
Then you must keep on persevering.

384
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,723
Leave off!

385
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,561
"When you're sinking fast

386
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,466

No, I ain't.

Otters!

Hold up.

423
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,302
What?

424
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,971
Take a switch at that.

425
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,778
- Food!
- Food!

426
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,051
Charge!

427
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,717
Every fish for himself!

428
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,858
Get out of my way!

429
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,710
Stay right there, Scout.

430
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,343
Come here, you.

431
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,482
You, in that funny shirt.
I'll soon sort you out.

432
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:47,877
Come on. Lay off!

433
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,353
Where's he gone?

434
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,581
Hello, what have we here?

435
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,284
Me nose!

436
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,231
Hey, chubby chops!

437
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,002
- You in the soppy hat!
- Soppy hat?

438
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,202
Why don't you go for
someone your own size?

439
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,109
Soon sort you out.

440
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,602
Right!

441
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,970
It comes to something
when a fellow's dinner starts fighting back.

442
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,338
You must be one of those
downstream mob.

443
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:25,212
- No, I come from up there.
- Up there? You're a long way from home.

444
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,374
Don't I know it.

445
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,941
But someone like you,
who knows his way about...

446
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,681
...perhaps you could show us
the way to get back up.

447
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,254
No argument there, son.

448
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,656
- Only thing is the dangers.
- What dangers?

449
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:39,855
Otter hounds. Only one sniff of me,
and it's, cheerio, here comes supper!

450
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,361
- Who can help me?
- Your best chance'd be the water babies.

451
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:48,098
- Water babies? Never heard of them.
- They're not from around these parts.

452
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,763
Right out at sea, they are.

453
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,432
Which way is right out at sea?

454
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,737
Downstream.

455
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,005
That's for us, then, Toby. Come on, boy.

456
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,679
Thanks, Mr. Otter.

457
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,413
That's the last anyone'll see of them.
Serves them right.

458
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,155
That'll teach you to fight fur.

459
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,818
The way I see it...

460
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,989
...these water babies must have
more sense than all them fish.

461
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,898
And if they can put us on the road back,
I can see Ellie again.

462
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,462
What's that?

463
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,789
Turn back!

464
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,921
Rapids!

465
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,310
Help!

466
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,290
Toby, where are you?

467
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,522
Help!

468
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,857
I feel rotten.

469
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,750
How about you?

470
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,991
Let's find some clean water.

471
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,592
Never heard of being under-the-seasick.

472
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,669
They ought to put milestones down here.

473
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,205
No way of telling where you are.

474
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:17,884
What an idiot!

475
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,790
That's what I am.
A right prune, if you know what I mean.

476
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,793
I feel such a dafty!

477
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,694
Stuck here like a pound of crabmeat,
know what I mean?

478
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,889
Swum these waters for 40 years...

479
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,867
...lad and lobster, 40 years,
and what do I do?

480
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:36,068
Fall for a wee trap. What a talent.

481
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,071
Jimmy, what are you staring at?

482
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,702
Just wondering,
why are you holding on to that thing?

483
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,539
Why am I holding on?

484
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,304
That's great, that is.

485
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:46,815
Do you not see
the daft thing is holding on to me?

486
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,785
- Perhaps I can help.
- That's downright offensive.

487
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,684
If I can't do it with my strength...

488
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,155
...what use would be a poor,
wee soggy like you?

489
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:58,654
Maybe your head's loose,
but your wee heart's in the right place.

490
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,823
Give us a hand, then.
Take a grip on that bar. Now!

491
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,657
Heave! Heave!

492
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,096
Heave hard!

493
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,406
It's useless, know what I mean?

494
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,339
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah, what is it?

495
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,643
The lobster snatcher.

496
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:22,483
Haul away, then! I'll be boiling tonight.

497
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,747
No!

498
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,386
Give up, Jimmy, I'm dead.

499
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,685
Not yet, you're not!

500
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:31,125
Leave go, or they'll be serving you up
with mayonnaise and all.

501
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,422
- One last try. Heave!
- Pipe clay up the lum!

502
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,061
We've done it! We beat them!

503
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,231
Not we, you.

504
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,699
Jimmy, you saved my life.

505
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:45,969
I'm Tom.

506
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,637
Give us your hand, then.

507
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,942
You're greetin'. What's that for?

508
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:55,280
It's just,
I never saved a lobster's life before.

509
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,387
You have now. Jock of the Orkneys.

510
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,447
Come on, laddie, let's come away deeper.

511
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,728
The water babies, is it?

512
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,390
As I've heard tell...

513
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,196
...they're the wee 'uns got that place
in the middle ocean.

514
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,760
- Yeah?
- And I have it on good authority...

515
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,837
...it's great there, you know what I mean?

516
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,273
But where is it?
Where is the middle ocean?

517
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:22,403
It's too far for a wee scruff like you
to be going on your own.

518
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,970
Apart from the normal hazards
of sea travel...

519
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,642
...there's that hairy great killer shark.

520
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,022
<i>Enormous, evil beast.</i>

521
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,155
<i>Real hard case.</i>

522
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:41,856
<i>Roams around the ocean</i>
<i>looking for water babies to enslave.</i>

523
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,829
<i>How do you mean "enslave"?</i>

524
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,496
<i>Takes them back to Shark Castle.</i>

525
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:51,939
<i>What he does to them there,</i>
<i>I've heard it's terrible.</i>

526
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,442
<i>Just terrible!</i>

527
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,637
Them water babies are my only chance.

528
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,874
If I don't reach them,
I'll never get back up there to Ellie.

529
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,213
You'll not do it
on your own wee, silly self...

530
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,913
...not without someone reliable
to be your guide.

531
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,351
- Yes, but who?
- That's no problem.

532
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:09,950
You'll come along with us?
High cockalorum, Toby!

533
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:13,793
- What's "high cockalorum"?
- For me, it's pies to eat, free beer...

534
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:16,094
...and somewhere to sleep warm
when it rains.

535
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,068
That high cockalorum. I ken that word.

536
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,798
"High cockalorum

It's certainly no giggle, this place.

564
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,002
It's what they call the Sargasso Sea.

565
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,271
There ain't no sign of any water babies.

566
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,903
They'll not be far now.

567
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,848
- Blimey! Take a look at that boat!
- Aye, a right ship's graveyard.

568
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:45,321
All the buccaneers and the privateers
that searched for gold of the Spanish Main.

569
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,358
This is where they all ended,
down in the depths, drowned.

570
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,757
Don't you know any funny stories?

571
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:53,923
What's that?

572
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,334
That's the haunter.

573
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,208
I'm getting out!

574
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,791
It can't get in here, can it?

575
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,522
No chance.

576
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,868
Hello!

577
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:39,942
That about frightened you, didn't it?

578
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,969
For years, I've been patrolling these wrecks
waiting for somebody to terrify.

579
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,009
We was terrified, very.

580
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,946
Some was, some wasn't.

581
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:51,980
That is kind of you.
Tell me, what brings you here?

582
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,090
- No, my wee chum here, you see...
- It's the water babies.

583
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,592
If I find 'em, I can go back up there to Ellie.

584
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,290
- You still got a way to go.
- Not that far. We just carry on due east.

585
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,026
- Due west.
- That's due south.

586
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,466
We'll be there in no...
What do you mean, "south"?

587
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,902
South's where I hear them singing from
sometimes when I'm lonely.

588
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,963
You can come with us
and show us the way.

589
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,010
I'd love to.
I can't tell you what a change it'll be...

590
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,802
...to have companionship.

591
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,381
Steady now. Pipe clay up the lum.

592
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,174
Pleased to meet you.
And mine's Terrence, dear.

593
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,983
You know what, Terrence, dear,
you are high cockalorum!

594
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,456
Nice of you to say so. Now, listen.

595
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,889
This is what high cockalorum means to me.

I'm keeping my eyes open for seamarks.

I'm keeping my eyes open

Right into our trap.

Right into it.

629

Very.

631

Why are you laughing?

632
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,614
I'm thinking about it.

633
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,521
Bit creepy, isn't it?

634
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:12,528
I think perhaps we should turn back.
I'm getting foreboding.

No matter how many bodings you get,
we're keeping on!

- Get into single file.
- Can't we get into single file together?

00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:22,064
Take them!

638
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,071
What's happening? Let go!

639
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,776
Put me down!

640

Get away!

...how nice to see
your dirty little mug again.

643
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:45,088
But calm down, I'm not eating you yet.

644
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,890
You'll be kept prisoners, all of you...

00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:51,727
...till we get the entire
water baby kingdom in chains...

646
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,671
...ready to be my slaves in Shark Castle!

647
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,411
And don't think you can escape.

648
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,242
Our seabed friends are
going to hold you fast!

649
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:13,250
Blimey, Jock.
Looks like I'll never see Ellie now.

650
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,292
<i>Never see Ellie now.</i>
<i>See Ellie now, Ellie now...</i>

651
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,895
<i>Ellie...</i>

652
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,869
<i>Feeling very miserable.</i>

653
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:29,771
<i>Can't believe that Tom is dead.</i>

654
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,342
<i>The river has been dragged.</i>

655
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,677
<i>Still, no trace.</i>

656
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,132
<i>Ellie.</i>

657
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,381
<i>Don't shout, please.</i>

658
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,883
<i>I'm only a chimney sweep.</i>

659
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,087
<i>Ain't got no mum or dad.</i>

660
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,126
<i>Blimey. Royalty!</i>

661
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,333
<i>My idea of paradise.</i>

662
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,496
He's alive!

663
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:18,939
Mrs. Tripp!

664
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,209
Tom's alive!

665
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,083
He's still alive!

666
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,712
Yes, my dear.

667
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,725
I'm sure he is.

668
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,766
Go on, Terrence.

669
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,626
Don't let 'em get you down.

670
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,229
How can they get me
further down than this?

671
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,706
Nothing ever goes right for me!

672
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,478
That's it, have a good weep, Jimmy.

673
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,345
- It's nature's release.
- Talking about release!

674
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,439
Help!

675
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,055
Look!

676
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:06,190
But what is it?

677
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,162
Something that looks very wrong.

678
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:10,493
It is, sir.

679
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,967
They've got us prisoners,
and we need help, sir.

680
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,560
A cry for help.

681
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:19,264
<i>Le chevalier</i> Claude, the bold cavalier.

682
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:24,006
He puts his sword at your disposal.
<i>Courage, mes amiss!</i>

683
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,606
<i>En garde!</i>

684
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:39,092
<i>Et maintenant, mes amis,</i> for one of my...

685
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,060
...best-known numbers.

686
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,630
I am going to enjoy this.

687
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,835
That's the way to do it!

688
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,894
Lovely!

689
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,372
And I love that hat.

690
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,733
Get 'em!

691
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,173
Here we go!

692
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,081
Take that, that, that, and that!

693
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,820
Very good!

694
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,963
They're running away.

695
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:17,522
If there's one thing I despise, it's a coward.

696
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:21,197
Stand and fight, you yellow, lily-livered...

697
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,498
No need to take everything personally.

698
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,777
High cockalorum!

699
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,081
High cockalorum?

700
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,416
You know that song?

701
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,654
I'll show you, my little ones...

702
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,251
...what it really means to me.

703
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,294

That's the first time

How did you know?

766
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,381
Water babies just do,
the way you know our names.

767
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,183
You're Alfred.

768
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:05,855
And you're...

769
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,560
...Ariadne.
- You see?

770
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:10,894
You're saying I'm a water baby?

771
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,696

On our way down here, we met this pair.

779
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:39,317
A flipping great shark,
and this sort of lighted-up eel...

780
01:01:39,895 --> 01:01:42,557
...and the things they were swearing
they was gonna do.

781
01:01:42,631 --> 01:01:45,794
While we stay on this playground,
there's nothing that can harm us.

Glad to hear it.

783
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,494
Mind if I ask you about
something else now?

784
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,834
Whatever you want to know.

785
01:01:50,906 --> 01:01:53,238
Where I come from,
there's a girl called Ellie.

786
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:56,474
Come to think of it,
she looks a bit like you.

787
01:01:56,545 --> 01:01:59,013
- Do you think she's pretty?
- You wouldn't believe it!

788
01:01:59,081 --> 01:02:00,105
Good.

"Music..."

796
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:27,306
What I'm trying to find, see,
is some way of getting back to her.

797
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,807
So I was wondering...

798
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,813
There's only one being who can decide
if a water baby may return up there.

799
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,213
The Kraken.

800
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:37,446
The Kraken's terrifying.
He's the Lord of the ocean.

801
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,250
And he lives in a place called
"The other end of nowhere."

802
01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:42,051
Has any water baby ever got to see him?

803
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:43,648
Yes.

804
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:46,752
A long time ago,
two of them set out to find him.

805
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,626
But they never came back.

806
01:02:48,697 --> 01:02:50,324
That's the way they set off...

807
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:52,629
...because it's the only way
to reach the Kraken.

808
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:55,693
- Through the tunnel.
- That's where we've got to go, then.

809
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:57,534
Terrence is on his travels again.

810
01:02:57,606 --> 01:02:59,130
Not till you're rested.

811
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:01,169
Won't tomorrow do?

812
01:03:01,243 --> 01:03:02,471
I suppose so.

813
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,638
I personally am very sleepy.

814
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,489
Tom, you must wake up!

815
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,088
- What's up?
- Wake up!

816
01:03:23,165 --> 01:03:24,757
- What's happening?
- Wake up!

817
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,692
- It's terrible!
- I knew it!

818
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,738
I've been struck down in me prime!

819
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:31,896
- It's too awful.
- Before me prime!

820
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:36,068
Everybody's gone! Everybody!
They've been taken.

821
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,080
There was a blue light from the cave,
the gate opened.

822
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,480
Then we heard the voices
of our two lost friends.

823
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,486
So all the babies rushed off towards them.
I warned them not to.

824
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,713
But they went on and...

825
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:57,859
When they were all inside the cave,
I heard this awful laughter.

826
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,264
That shark's got them.

827
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:21,287
All of our friends. What can we do?

828
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,523
- We must get help from that Kraken.
- Yes, the lad is right.

829
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:28,962
<i>Mes amis,</i> adventure is calling us!
<i>Au revoir!</i>

830
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:31,199
Good-bye! Good-bye!

831
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:35,769
Don't worry, we'll find 'em!

832
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,407
I reckon this is it.

833
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,507
Certainly doesn't look like anywhere else.

834
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:50,882
The other end of nowhere.

835
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,780
High cockalorum.

836
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:57,291
This looks like the other end of nowhere.

837
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:58,953
<i>Voila!</i>

838
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:01,823
<i>Fantastique.</i>

839
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:04,559
Think that's here to help us climb up?

840
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:07,769
Eternity.

841
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:12,407
- <i>Allons, mes enfants.</i>
- Hang about!

842
01:05:12,474 --> 01:05:13,873
On top of that ice, it's air.

843
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,104
Only me and Toby can breathe air.

844
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,636
It's got to be us on our tod.
We'll be back with lots of help.

845
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:23,242
And we'll not budge from here,
but be awful careful.

846
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,320
'Cause that's what we'll be. Good-bye.

847
01:05:25,387 --> 01:05:28,379
- Good-bye.
- <i>Au revoir,</i> my brave ones.

848
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,271
Wonder what that says.

849
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,346
What's happening?

850
01:05:55,951 --> 01:05:58,249
How dare you!

851
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:00,521
How...

852
01:06:00,956 --> 01:06:02,048
...dare you!

853
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,922
- Excuse me, guv!
- How...

854
01:06:05,427 --> 01:06:06,917
...dare you!

855
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:10,799
Out, lad, out! Trespassers will be petrified.

856
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:14,391
I want to see the Kraken!
You listen to me, you great hearth rug!

857
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,028
I demand to see the Kraken!

858
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,331
"Demand"?

859
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:23,670
You just might amuse his Lordship.

860
01:06:24,346 --> 01:06:26,871
"Demand," if you don't mind.

861
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:32,583
Is this him?

862
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,588
Come on. Morning to you, Cyril.

863
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,183
Archie?

864
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:40,988
This young tearaway
wants to see the Kraken!

865
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,063
- Put his name on the waiting list.
- But nobody's waiting!

866
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:45,157
He is.

867
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,997
- How long do I wait?
- Till I say so.

868
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:48,866
- When will that be?
- When I've decided.

869
01:06:48,937 --> 01:06:51,201
- When will you decide?
- When I say you can go.

870
01:06:52,674 --> 01:06:55,666
- Toby! Come on!
- Come back, you imp!

871
01:06:56,011 --> 01:06:58,172
Have you got no respect for formalities?

872
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:02,581
And what are you laughing at?

873
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,482
"Demand," he said!

874
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:07,221
The sprat said "demand"!

875
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,891
High cockalorum!

876
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,389
What...

877
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:32,978
Is there anyone there?

878
01:07:34,716 --> 01:07:36,240
Anybody inside?

879
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:41,284
Some know me as Neptune...

880
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,719
...Father of the Seas.

881
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:46,853
Some know me as Poseidon,
the Thunderer.

882
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:51,624
But most know me as Kraken,
the Earth Shaker.

883
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:55,230
Not many know me at all. I'm Tom.

884
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:58,430
Unknown? Uninvited?

885
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,466
Yet you come to me for my help?

886
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,909
- It's two helps, really.
- Two helps?

887
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,614
It's hard, see?

888
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:09,981
I've got these friends called water babies
trapped in Shark Castle...

889
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,316
...and I want to be allowed
to go back up there.

890
01:08:12,387 --> 01:08:15,686
One choice, and only one.

891
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:19,120
And it is you who must choose.

892
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:23,495
If it be the right one,
all will be well with you.

893
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:24,793
If I pick the wrong one?

894
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:27,563
You will remain forever captive
in my realm!

895
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:31,238
So make the choice!

896
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,006
Is it to be this...

897
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:43,846
...or this?

898
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,247
Make your choice, boy!

899
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,051
Set the water babies free!

900
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:50,551
So be it!

901
01:08:53,595 --> 01:08:55,426
But they ain't free.

902
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:59,364
Not yet, for there is one condition.

903
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:03,060
One condition? That's not fair!
You should've said that first!

904
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:07,172
I am the Kraken!
I can say things last if I wish!

905
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:10,678
- What is it, then?
- I, the Kraken, put you to test!

906
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:15,741
I must see you defeat the shark
and the eel.

907
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,216
What, by meself?

908
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,481
You may make use of your friends...

909
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,987
...your courage, and your wits.

910
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,158
Funny way of going about things, guv.

911
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,895
I shall be watching, boy.

912
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,107
Here.

913
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:41,876
Listen!

914
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:44,572
What the governor said
you've got to do is help me.

915
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:48,782
To beat the shark? He said that?

916
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:51,785
I don't think that comes
within my polar region.

917
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:53,616
Not to beat the shark.

918
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,886
- It cannot be done.
- It cannot be done.

919
01:09:57,125 --> 01:10:00,856
Mind you, bit of planning...

920
01:10:01,196 --> 01:10:03,528
Yes, a bit of planning.

921
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:05,290
Putting heads together?

922
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:08,832
Respecting the formalities.

923
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,196
Right-o, then! Heads together!

924
01:10:13,308 --> 01:10:15,435
And then, of course, all we have to...

925
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,011
Can we do that?

926
01:10:22,317 --> 01:10:25,343
- Of course, we can!
- But will you do it?

927
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,216
Try keeping us out!

928
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:27,110
Whoever did that, I'll have him kippered!

929
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:40,118
To your posts, you miserable ninnies!
Guard the outpost! Sound the...

930
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:44,831
I'll reduce the lot of you to the ranks!

931
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,663
I'll snap your spines! I'll desiccate you!

932
01:11:47,769 --> 01:11:50,101
I'll have your fins for fritters!

933
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,400
This is no way to run a navy.

934
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:57,107
Trajectory and distance bang on!

935
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:06,347
- How was that?
- Right! Our turn, now!

936
01:12:06,988 --> 01:12:08,387
Left, left.

937
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,023
Right a bit. Right a bit.

938
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:14,026
Who was supposed to be standing guard?
Eel!

939
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,160
- Where are you?
- Just coming, sir!

940
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,133
- At the double!
- I'm on me way, sir!

941
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:22,565
You overdeveloped worm!

942
01:12:22,637 --> 01:12:24,969
Get up to battlements,
and see what's happening!

943
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,508
Immediately, sir! Like a flash.
A moving blur!

944
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,608
There she goes!

945
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:36,351
He does irritate me, that shark!
He really does!

946
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:39,446
No consideration for other fish's feelings.

947
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:42,047
Self, self, self.

948
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:49,761
To the battlements, you scum!
Go on! Shake a tail!

949
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:53,896
Dear!

950
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,001
I'm right behind you!

951
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,444
I said, up, not down, you dunderhead!

952
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:10,717
Invasion!

953
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:28,267
- How did we do with that one?
- Right where it hurt!

954
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,505
All together, men!

955
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,434
One moment, if you please.

956
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:38,236
Let's not have any sloppiness,
not when neatness is possible.

957
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,706
You're an artist, Cyril.

958
01:13:42,517 --> 01:13:44,007
Pride in one's craft.

959
01:13:44,619 --> 01:13:45,984
Push!

960
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:50,948
On top of the situation, milord?
Sir? Captain?

961
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,788
No!

962
01:14:06,174 --> 01:14:07,971
Now for the big attack!

963
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,701
You go in front. I'll lead.

964
01:14:10,111 --> 01:14:11,578
Hooray!

965
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:16,981
Charge!

966
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:19,752
Hooray!

967
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,229
Lose your fear!

968
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,055
Claude is here!

969
01:14:31,566 --> 01:14:35,798
One skillful flick of the nose, <i>et voila!</i>

970
01:14:36,571 --> 01:14:39,404
<i>Libert, mes amis!</i>

971
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,634
Come on out, before the shark catches us!
Quick!

972
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,235
That's right! Quick!

973
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:47,210
Get me out of here!

974
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,350
I'm surrounded by incompetents!

975
01:14:50,418 --> 01:14:54,047
Go after those invaders! Annihilate them!

976
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,049
You'll never guess what I've found.

977
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:58,882
- What?
- How about...

978
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:02,158
Go on! Great stupid toady!

979
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:03,822
That's gratitude!

980
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:07,067
Mutiny, is it?

981
01:15:07,602 --> 01:15:09,832
Yes, it is! What about that, big mouth?

982
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:13,568
When the boot's on the other foot,
it doesn't taste so good, does it?

983
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:20,709
I didn't mean it, sir!
I was only trying to cheer you up!

984
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,682
No, it was only in fun! Please!

985
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:25,409
Get a move on!

986
01:15:27,455 --> 01:15:30,856
- Sharks at the rear!
- It is fighting time!

987
01:15:34,529 --> 01:15:35,553
<i>En garde!</i>

988
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:42,132
Jock! There are too many for him!
Hold on, Claude!

989
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:44,068
- See that gate?
- Aye, the portcullis.

990
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:47,472
- Lf we drop it, they'll be trapped.
- But it'll take some doing.

991
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:49,874
- I'm going through!
- Watch it here, Tom!

992
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,535
Easy in there!

993
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:52,944
Looks like a big drum!

994
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:54,606
- And a lever!
- That'll be it!

995
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:58,676
The brake on the capstan!
If you can free the brake...

996
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,783
It's stuck!

997
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,856
There must be a way!

998
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,219
Here!

999
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:19,435
You've done it, laddie!

1000
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:23,100
That should keep 'em busy for a wee while!

1001
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:25,806
Enough for us to escape ourselves!

1002
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:33,686
- Very satisfactory effort.
- A job well done!

1003
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:37,191
You'll just never believe
what's happening down below!

1004
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:40,959
Get off! Stop it!

1005
01:16:41,062 --> 01:16:43,292
I'll cut your current off or whatever that is!

1006
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,128
No, you mustn't touch me current!

1007
01:16:47,702 --> 01:16:50,933
No, please! Don't cut me current off!
That's nasty!

1008
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:54,373
- I wouldn't do that to me worst enemy!
- I'll defuse you!

1009
01:16:54,442 --> 01:16:58,139
No, don't defuse me! Please!
I don't want to be defused!

1010
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:02,513
I like being alive!
What shall I do when the nights get dark?

1011
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,282
Mummy! Stop him!

1012
01:17:27,108 --> 01:17:30,305
- A mighty victory!
- Pipe clay up the lum!

1013
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:31,709

I did keep an eye on you, Tom.

By choosing to plead for others,
rather than yourself...

...I can now grant you your own plea.

You may go back up there.

1060
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:36,227
You gonna leave us, Tom?

1061
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:43,611
But there is still the matter
of <i>cherchez la femme!</i>

1062
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,370
We shouldn't keep him
from young Ellie and that.

Good-bye, then, Claude.

than you!

you may think you're a bit of a seaweed...

1066

...but when it's needed, you give your all.

1067
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:57,090
I do, don't I?

1068
01:19:57,158 --> 01:19:58,625
And you, me old mate...

1069
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:01,662
One friend I'll never forget
is Jock of the Orkneys.

1070
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,491
Get away home.

1071
01:20:03,998 --> 01:20:05,693
Pipe clay up the lum!

1072

Blimey! Harthover!

1084
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:27,345
Hello?

1085
01:21:28,983 --> 01:21:31,076
There's got to be someone about.

1086
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:33,916
Somebody is about, young jailbait!

1087
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:41,120
Who would have thought
to see this wretch again, Damiel?

1088
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:43,058
Not I, Mr. Grimes.

1089
01:21:44,465 --> 01:21:46,899
Not I. And his little pup, as well.

1090
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,497
Be quiet, Wilfred!

1091
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,303
Why aren't you two hanged, then?

1092
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:59,977
Growing up,
back-answering the elders and betters?

1093
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,877
Thou hast got a lot of punch and gall...

1094
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:08,582
...but I'll bring thee back to heel
soon enough.

1095
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:12,151
Not so hasty, young fella!

1096
01:22:12,393 --> 01:22:15,055
Thy master's still got work for thee!

1097
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:22,730
Get outside of that!

1098
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:33,403
More?

1099
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:42,979
It was Providence what sent thee tonight,
Thomas.

1100
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:47,620
For we mean to sweep out Harthover Hall
good and proper.

1101
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:49,456
You ain't!

1102
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:50,959
Not after last time!

1103
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,325
They think it was thee.

1104
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:58,797
If he gets troublesome,
he'll have his neck stretched.

1105
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:00,602
Now, pay attention.

1106
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:05,112
After one try, they won't expect another.

1107
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:09,314
So we clean up,
and then we're away to London.

1108
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,013
Thou'll get thy share, Thomas.

1109
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:14,312
Old Grimes was never stingy...

1110
01:23:14,722 --> 01:23:16,053
...was he, Damiel?

1111
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:17,716
Not ever, Mr. Grimes!

1112
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:25,060
No, never, Mr. Grimes.

1113
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:32,938
Now, give me the dog,
and get up the drainpipe.

1114
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:40,605
And move along.

1115
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,881
And up to that there window what's open.

1116
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:49,415
Then go downstairs,
and let us in by this here back door.

1117
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:52,024
Don't be thinking of warning anybody.

1118
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:54,918
Because I've got your little pup here!

1119
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:58,687
And if you cross us,
I'll break his neck as quick as you like!

1120
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:00,966
Keep moving!

1121
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,296
Come on.

1122
01:24:55,189 --> 01:24:56,781
Go on!

1123
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,475
Pipe clay up the lum!

1124
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,478
Tom!

1125
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:03,380
Stay exactly where you are!

1126
01:26:03,724 --> 01:26:06,158
Stay exactly where you are!

1127
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:07,861
I just said that, dear.

1128
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:10,329
So have I, dear. Say it again.

1129
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:13,767
Stay exactly where you are!

1130
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:16,864
That's him, Uncle John!

1131
01:26:17,171 --> 01:26:18,832
That's Mr. Grimes!

1132
01:26:25,179 --> 01:26:28,080
This time,
I believe we have the real thieves.

1133
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:32,350
And this time, you will not escape!

1134
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:40,492
Won't escape?

1135
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:42,759
Damn his eyes.

1136
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:44,860
I believe he's right.

1137
01:27:23,437 --> 01:27:24,563
Blimey!

1138
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:31,476
Mrs. Tripp, you've done a splendid job.

1139
01:27:31,545 --> 01:27:33,445
Quite a transformation.

1140
01:27:33,814 --> 01:27:35,839
Hardly recognized him.

1141
01:27:38,452 --> 01:27:40,386
Highly classy!

1142
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:42,648
What's it say?

1143
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:52,594
Quiet, please, everyone.

1144
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:56,131
On your chair, young Tom, on your chair.

1145
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,708
The time has come. Deep breath.

1146
01:28:02,643 --> 01:28:05,612
Don't be shy. Speak up. Now, Tom...

1147
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:09,377
We want to know what happened to you
after you jumped into the water.

1148
01:28:09,483 --> 01:28:12,543
We were all so distressed
when we could find no trace of you.

1149
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,384
Now, you tell us. Tell us the whole story.

1150
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:21,959
There was a lobster.

1151
01:28:22,029 --> 01:28:24,497
First of all, a salmon.
He taught me how to swim.

1152
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,897
And we went to find the water babies.

1153
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:30,596
Then we met Terrence, and he took us to...
Terrence was a seahorse.

1154
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:34,971
Then we were captured by the evil forest,
and found the water babies' playground...

1155
01:28:35,309 --> 01:28:38,403
I don't know about you,
but I can't understand a word he's saying.

1156
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:42,313
To be honest, Mrs. Kennedy, neither can I,
but there again, he's a Londoner.

1157
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,380
Anyway, Claude rescued us.

1158
01:28:51,058 --> 01:28:53,993
Tom, I can't help thinking
that those two rascals...

1159
01:28:54,061 --> 01:28:56,962
...must have given you
a bit of a clout on the head!

1160
01:28:57,098 --> 01:29:01,091
Never mind.
True or not true, it was a good story.

1161
01:29:01,168 --> 01:29:04,899
But perhaps it is just a fairy tale,
and only fun and pretense.

1162
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:08,601
Therefore, we mustn't believe a word of it,
even if it's true.

1163
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:12,641
Be that as it may, the important thing is...

1164
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:15,044
The most important thing, dear.

1165
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:17,550
The most important thing...

1166
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:20,047
- Didn't I say that?
- Yes, dear.

1167
01:29:22,289 --> 01:29:27,022
The most important thing is that we,
Lady Harriet and I...

1168
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:31,665
...want you to treat this good house,
Harthover Hall, as your home.

1169
01:29:37,204 --> 01:29:38,603
Quite so, sir...

1170
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,766
...and the invitation is extended
to your friend.

1171
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:47,609
Tom, we shall look after you
as if you were our own son.

1172
01:29:48,949 --> 01:29:51,611
So welcome to the family, Thomas...

1173
01:29:52,486 --> 01:29:54,249
What's the rest of it, Ellie?

1174
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:59,553
Thomas Aquinas something-or-other.

1175
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,992
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast.

1176
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:11,598
Ladies and gentlemen,
Thomas Aquinas something-or-other.

1177
01:30:11,872 --> 01:30:14,067
Thomas Aquinas something-or-other.

1178
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:19,075
Sounds as far-fetched as his story.

1179
01:30:19,146 --> 01:30:21,478
Boy has a fertile imagination.

1180
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:25,349
Undoubtedly a dream,
but his recall is fascinating.

1181
01:30:25,419 --> 01:30:29,287
They don't believe me, Ellie.
They don't believe it really happened.

1182
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:33,618
You don't believe me, Ellie, but it did.

1183
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:35,318
It honestly did.

1184
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:36,624
Come on.

1185
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:38,092
Come on!

1186
01:30:39,366 --> 01:30:40,594
Come on, boy!

1187
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:44,796
Yes, he made it up,
but it was really very endearing.

1188
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:46,499
A lobster, dear?

1189
01:31:55,242 --> 01:31:56,834
Bonne <i>chance, Tom.</i>

1190
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:59,012
<i>Welcome back, lad.</i>

1191
01:31:59,413 --> 01:32:01,278
<i>Pipe clay up the lum, boy.</i>

1192
01:32:01,815 --> 01:32:03,578
<i>But who's the young lassie?</i>

1193
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:05,417
<i>Is it Ellie?</i>

1194
01:32:05,619 --> 01:32:07,746
<i>She's a wee cracker.</i>

1195
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:10,783
Now do you believe, Ellie?

1196
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:12,189
Now do you believe?

1197
01:32:12,259 --> 01:32:13,419
I do!

1198
01:32:14,728 --> 01:32:17,629
<i>'Tis good to see you again, Tom.</i>

1199
01:32:18,098 --> 01:32:22,797
<i>On behalf of all the water babies,</i>
<i>we'd like to say, "Welcome back!"</i>
	
1200
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:27,503
Wait till I tell Uncle John and Aunt Harriet!

1201
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:30,939
It wasn't a story! It was true!

1202
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:32,672
I told you, didn't I?

1203
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:34,978
There are water babies!

1204
01:32:35,215 --> 01:32:36,842
There really are!
